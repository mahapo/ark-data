Butenjoyment of this gift requires a certain degree of understanding—an informedawareness of our bodies’ needs that is more crucial today than ever before.Let me explain why this informed awareness is so important now. Among the manyaccomplishments of American civilization, none is more impressive than the factthat virtually no one in the United States is starving to death, which was nottrue in centuries past and is hardly the case even today in many parts of theworld. Throughout much of history, human beings had little choice but to eatwhatever they could find, hunt, or grow. This had many drawbacks, but it didcause the evolution of our remarkably flexible human digestive system, which isnot only capable of processing a wide variety of foods but is actually bestsuited to doing so.After tens of thousands of years, the parameters of human nutrition changedquite suddenly. At least in the United States, most of us no longer have to eatwhatever we can get. On the contrary, we may eat whatever we want—but what weseem most often to choose is an ever-narrowing range of foods that are mostlysweet, or high in fat content, or low in dietary fibers. Our digestive system,which evolved to deal with scarcity and variety, is now called upon to handleabundance and nutritional uniformity. In other words, although we have enough toeat today, we’re not really taking advantage of the foods available to us. We’reeating too much of the wrong things, and we’re often doing it in such a rushthat more stress than nutrition is delivered to our bodies and our cells. WhileWestern society has largely solved the problems of making food available, wehave yet to learn how to make the choices that are best for us. In terms oflearning about the foods we eat and understanding how our bodies process them,we have yet to recognize our true needs.Although the larger purpose of this book is to bring you a more enlightenedinterpretation and a more comprehensive understanding of your physiology as awhole, our explicit focus here is on the gastrointestinal tract. It certainlydeserves our attention. According to Ayurveda, the traditional Indian science ofhealth, most diseases originate as an imbalance in the digestive system. In thepages ahead we look at how the gastrointestinal tract is constructed, how itworks when healthy, and how to restore health when ideal functioning has beenlost through imbalance or disease.Our discussion of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract will be concerned especiallywith the tract’s lower end, which includes the intestines and the colon.Naturally, these are not topics that most people take up in casual conversation.Yet even as far back as the time of the ancient Greeks, when the philosopherEpicurus declared that sound digestion was the basis of all human goodness,people have recognized the importance of the gastrointestinal tract. It’sinteresting that Epicurus, who celebrated the pleasures of good digestion (andwhose name brought us the term epicurean), also believed that poor digestion wasso morally destructive that everything possible should be done to avoid it. Hehimself eventually converted to a diet of water and grain in order to minimizethe risk of stomachache.When functioning as it should, your GI tract converts food into energy andnutrition to build, repair, and sustain your body—a big job that continues everyminute of every day throughout your lifetime. Over seventy years an averageAmerican’s digestive system will process about twenty-three thousandpounds—nearly twelve tons—of solid food. When you’re in a state of good health,food passes through the twenty-seven feet of digestive canals linking throat torectum without any conscious effort on your part and without any significantdiscomfort. Yet comfort is by no means common to everyone. Studies show that asmany as one in every three Americans experiences frequent and significantdiscomfort related to the lower intestinal tract. Indeed, during the course ofany given day almost everyone has gastrointestinal symptoms of some kind, andstudies indicate that at least 20 million Americans suffer from a well-definedconstellation of symptoms known as Irritable Bowel Syndrome, or IBS.IBS has had other names throughout the years: spastic colon, nervous stomach,mucous colitis, irritable colon, and many more. Although it is commonly referredto as “chronic colitis,” this is actually incorrect since the word colitisimplies inflammation of the bowel, which does not exist in true IBS. The factthat Irritable Bowel Syndrome has so many names suggests that it is not really adisease at all, but a collection of signs and symptoms that have becomecommonplace in modern medicine. So commonplace, in fact, that more peoplepresent themselves in the offices of gastroenterologists—specialists in the GItract—with symptoms of IBS than with any other complaint.In this book we will consider in detail such manifestations of IBS asconstipation, diarrhea, and gas. Although not generally life-threatening, thesecan cause a great deal of discomfort, inconvenience, worry, and even greatemotional turmoil. We will also look briefly at some of the more seriousproblems that can afflict the gastrointestinal tract. Severe conditions such asulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease, and diverticulitis are beyond our primaryfocus here, but familiarity with their early symptoms is vital in order to dealwith them effectively."},{"pageContent":"1THE QUANTUM MECHANICS OF DIGESTIONFrom a holistic point of view, understanding any aspect of the humanbody—whether it’s digestion and elimination or the way we process sights andsounds—must begin with a view of the body as a single integrated system in whichall the parts are designed to function in a unified manner.Although the gastrointestinal tract is itself a fascinating and marvelouslycomplex apparatus, it is still only one aspect of the intricate and oftenbewildering entity that is our physical self. For this reason, I believe it’sappropriate to begin by offering you a new understanding of your body as awhole—one could even say a new vision of it. I believe that once you’ve viewedyourself from this new perspective, you will see yourself as you did before, butwith an important foundation on which to build a program of truly perfecthealth—that is, a healthy GI tract and a healthy body overall.The new perspective is derived from Ayurveda, so in a sense it’s not really anew perspective at all, because Ayurveda is the oldest health care system knownto man. Remarkably, this ancient approach to understanding the body, which hasbeen tested and proven over thousands of years, is also completely compatiblewith our contemporary understanding of how nature works. In fact, Ayurvedasimply uses a different terminology to express some of the most advanced ideasof molecular biology and quantum physics.The first principle of this new/old perspective is that the human body is not asolid, particulate, static, fragmented, “frozen sculpture” that exists inisolation from the rest of nature. Rather, Ayurveda recognizes the body as partof the natural continuum. From this point of view, the human body is a dynamicfield of energy. It is constantly participating in an exchange with the largerof field of energy that surrounds it, which comprises the rest of the universe.Most remarkably of all, as a result of his continual exchange, your body isbeing renewed and replaced every moment of your life!If you could see your body as it really is at the most basic level, you wouldrealize that 98 percent of the atoms in your anatomy were not there a year ago.For example, scientific research has shown that your bones—which seem so solidand which support your entire frame—are re-created brand new every three months.This means that while the configuration of the bone cells remains constant, thebillions of atoms that comprise the bones and pass freely back and forth throughthe cell walls are constantly undergoing change and replacement. As a result,you acquire a new skeleton every three months.The same processes are at work throughout the rest of your body. The cells inyour liver turn over very slowly, but new atoms still flow through them, likewater in a stream, creating a new liver every six weeks. Your skin is new everymonth. Even within the brain—where cells do not regenerate when they die—thespecific atoms of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen are totally differenttoday from what they were one year ago. In the digestive tract, you construct anew stomach lining every four days, and the surface cells that actually come incontact with digesting food are renewed every five minutes. Basically, your bodycompletely re-creates itself down to the last atom over a period of four or fiveyears.It is as if you live in a building whose bricks are constantly being taken outand replaced. From one day to the next it looks like the same building, but infact it’s fundamentally different. A human body also looks much the same fromday to day, but it is forever in a process of change and exchange with theuniverse around it. And this process includes the basic physiological functionsof metabolism, digestion, and elimination.All the renewing and re-creating I’ve mentioned is very carefully controlled. Itmust be, in order to rebuild the body in recognizable form rather than as ahaphazard collection of parts. Where does this careful control originate? In aword, it originates with intelligence.This brings us to the first and perhaps the most important Ayurvedic principle:Our physiology itself is inherently intelligent, and the many physiologicalfunctions guiding the replacement of cells and molecules and even atoms aredependent on the inherent intelligence that inhabits the human body.In recent years, quantum physics has provided us with these same basic insightsinto the nature of human functioning. The body is made up of atoms. And what areatoms? It may be easiest to think of them as particles whirling at lightningspeed through vast empty spaces—colliding, disintegrating, darting back andforth—but atoms are not really particles in the sense that a pebble is aparticle of rock or a twig is a piece of tree. Rather, they are minutefluctuations of energy in the infinite expanse of energy that modern physicscalls the unified field. It is from the unified field that all natural forcesemerge, giving rise to an entire material universe, including your body.Fundamentally, your body is as void of matter as is intergalactic space. It maybe surprising to realize that an apparently solid mass of living, breathingmatter is in reality mostly empty space—nothing more than a perceptual illusion,a reflection of the more basic underlying intelligence that structures theentire universe. It may indeed be surprising, but nature’s truth often is.This perspective on human physiology, which recognizes intelligence as the basicfabric from which the body is structured, gives rise to the concept of thequantum mechanical body. This phrase pays homage to another crucial principle:that the body’s inner intelligence is the ultimate and supreme genius thatmirrors the intelligence of the universe as a whole.These lofty notions may seem somewhat removed from the explicit focus of thisbook. In order to bridge that gap, let us first try to locate the mechanisms ofthe body that are responsible for healing—or, as I prefer to express it, forre-creating health. Obviously, no single organ is responsible; every part of thebody is able to recognize when it is damaged and is capable of initiatinghealing. This in itself is an astonishing miracle, and as yet we have no simpleanswers to explain how it is even possible. Every one of the thousands ofprocesses involved in healing even a superficial wound is incredibly complex andincompletely understood. Although countless articles have been written about theclotting process of blood, for example, it remains true that no medicalintervention can reproduce the healing action that takes place in a tiny cut onyour finger.According to Ayurveda, the ability to heal is the primary and most significantquality of the body. Ayurveda defines healing as a process of returning the bodyto its natural functions. This is accomplished by enlivening the intelligenceinherent in every cell of the body. When Hippocrates declared thousands of yearsago that only nature itself can bring about healing, he was expressing a truththat is still valid today, despite all our technological advances.Consider, for example, the case of a broken arm. A skilled physician will alignthe bone fragments in such a way as to minimize the effort nature needs toeffect healing. The wise doctor creates conditions that help to support therestoration of health, but he or she always recognizes that something beyond thephysician’s power performs the actual work of healing.Digestion plays a critical role in the natural healing process. The constantrenewal of every part of the physiology is dependent on proper digestivefunctioning, which Ayurveda sees as a means of extracting intelligence from foodand then processing it to support the intelligence inherent in the entirephysiology. In this way, the process of digestion plays a pivotal role inmaintaining overall homeostasis and healing power. It is through digestion thatintelligence, in the form of nutrients from the body’s surrounding environment,is extracted, broken down, and then combined again in such a way as to re-createevery cell, every organ, every tissue of the human body.Let me emphasize this point. To many people, it may seem strange to finddigestion discussed in terms of intelligence. After all, in the West we’re usedto associating intelligence with the brain, not with the stomach or theintestines. But Ayurveda recognizes the intelligence that exists in every organ,in every cell, of the body.All the functions of your body have inherent balance points, which are set bythe natural intelligence we’ve been discussing. This is really quite remarkable:The millions of molecules in your bloodstream, for example, travel where they’reneeded with unerring accuracy; the pupils of your eyes are always adjusting tochanging light conditions with greater flexibility than any camera lens youcould ever hope to buy; your body temperature is constantly falling or rising asyour internal thermostat reacts to the temperature of the air, to the time ofday, and to your level of exertion. And all the while, your digestive system ismoving along with the efficiency of an assembly line in a well-run factory.It is only when this balance is disrupted for some reason, when the set pointsof your physiology are disturbed, that symptoms begin to occur. When thathappens, your task is not so much to defeat or suppress the symptoms as it is torestore balance to your system, whereupon the symptoms will disappear bythemselves.For digestion and metabolism to perform with their natural precision andefficiency, a well-balanced lifestyle is the first prerequisite. Unhealthfulfood, poor sleeping habits, negative emotions, or physical and mental strain allcan cause the body to deviate from natural functioning. Perhaps it is thecentral role that digestion plays in the constant restoration of the body’sintelligence that makes it so exquisitely sensitive to all of the influencesthat comprise modern life. It may be for this reason that “gut” problems areamong the most common complaints in contemporary health care.From an Ayurveda perspective, then, there are no well-defined edges to ourbodies—no borders, no boundaries. The study of digestion is inseparable from anunderstanding of the neurological and cardiovascular systems, just as the humanbody itself is inseparable from its environment.The body is part of the larger unified field, and our being extends beyond theconfines of this bag of skin and bones to the far reaches of the cosmos. Ourthoughts, imaginations, feelings, desires, and energies are as much “us” as areour fingernails, our blemishes, and our digestive tracts. Why should we givemore regard to physiological artifacts? Why should we think that anyimperfection in them is more a part of us than is our infinite awareness, whichis capable of reaching the stars in the blink of an eye? In fact, we are thestars. We are the rivers, we are the storms, we are the floods, we are thegalaxies. These are all projections of our awareness.But to fully experience this awareness, we need our physiology. Seeing, hearing,feeling, smelling, digesting—we need all of these in order to sense andunderstand the universe we live in. Therefore, our intention in this book is tore-create healthy balance not only in every cell of the intestinal tract but inevery aspect of the quantum mechanical body.Now you’re ready to take some practical actions toward fulfilling thatintention. You should begin by keeping a record of any gastrointestinal symptomsyou have during the day, together with your feelings before and during theoccurrence of the symptoms. This will help reveal any patterns to your symptomsand any relationships that exist between them and fatigue, stress, and otheremotional factors.At the end of this chapter, you’ll find several IBS Tracking Sheets on which torecord your symptoms. Keep a copy of this form with you throughout the day, anduse it anytime you undergo discomfort in the intestinal tract.One point that will quickly become evident is that the triggers for yoursymptoms may be accumulating over a period of days or even an entire week ratherthan coming on suddenly within hours or minutes. Events that took place days agomay be causing the discomfort you’re experiencing right now. While a given foodor beverage may produce diarrhea and cramping within a few hours, feelings suchas stress or anger can have a more long-term effect. You may find that severalstressful days or sleepless nights cause your symptoms “suddenly” to get muchworse. But after reviewing your tracking sheets, you’ll discover that thepattern was actually quite clear.Perhaps the most important function of this record keeping is to document yourimprovement as you begin implementing the recommendations in this book. For thisreason, in addition to using your tracking sheets each time you have a symptom Iwould like you to make a record each time you have a bowel movement, notingwhether it is normal or abnormal in its nature. Over time, as you observeimprovement, you will be tracking your own growth toward perfect health.IBS TRACKING CHARTThe following chart can help you understand the characteristics and causes ofIBS symptoms you may be experiencing. This understanding is an important firststep toward making changes that will eliminate the problems. If you notice, forinstance, that your symptoms always occur after a large evening meal, you maywant to begin eating less substantial dinners. And simply making yourself awareof your symptoms in an organized way can have powerful therapeutic benefits.The chart, however, should not be used as a tool for self-diagnosis or as asubstitute for medical evaluation of health concerns. If your symptoms persist,see your doctor. Do so immediately if you experience rectal bleeding or unusualweight loss.Use the IBS Tracking Chart for at least four weeks. If it’s convenient,photocopy the chart and continue to use it for a more extended period. With theinsights you’ll gain into the specific nature of your IBS complaints, you’ll beable to use the information in this book much more effectively.A brief explanation of the chart’s categories:Type of Symptom Did you experience diarrhea, constipation, cramping, gas, orsome other IBS complaint? Severity Rate your degree of discomfort on a 1–10scale. If you’re consistently experiencing the same symptom, does it seem to begetting better or worse over time? What variables may be affecting this?Duration Did the symptom come on suddenly and then disappear, or did it persistfor a period of time? Last Meal What did you eat or drink prior to symptom’sonset? How long ago? Stress Level How were you feeling emotionally when the IBSsymptom appeared? If you were under stress—at work, for example—what was thecause? (As you continue to use the chart over a period of days, look forpatterns in this category that suggest changes you can initiate.) Comments Atthe end of each week, write down pertinent observations. What factors seemed toaffect your digestion? Consider influences that may have taken place before theactual appearance of symptoms, since stress does not always manifest itselfimmediately. Think about how you can alter specific behaviors to benefit yourdigestion. If you make changes, note any effects on the following week’s chart.[images/Chop_9780307558985_epub_001_r1.jpg][images/Chop_9780307558985_epub_002_r1.jpg][images/Chop_9780307558985_epub_003_r1.jpg][images/Chop_9780307558985_epub_004_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"2DIGESTION AND THE AYURVEDIC DOSHASIn chapter 1 [Chop_9780307558985_epub_c01_r1.htm] we saw how Ayurveda provides aunique foundation on which to build an understanding of the human body—afoundation that makes intelligence the basis of the entire physiology. Ayurvedabreaks down the notion of a rigid separation between mind and body, and thewisdom of this should be obvious, for clearly any mental or emotional eventgives rise to a corresponding event in the body. Ayurveda even has its ownvocabulary for defining these mind/body conjunctions, and for describing thequantum mechanical principles that control the relationships betweenconsciousness and physiology.Ayurveda describes these principles in terms of three important governing agentscalled “doshas.” These are ultimate, irreducible metabolic principles thatregulate the flow of intelligence throughout the physiology. The names of thethree doshas are Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each dosha has its own function in thebody: Vata dosha controls all movement, Pitta is responsible for metabolism anddigestion, and Kapha governs the structure of the body.Every cell in your body must contain all three doshas in order to sustain life.Your body must have Vata—or motion—in order to breathe, to circulate the blood,pass food through the digestive tract, and send nerve impulses to and from thebrain. It needs Pitta—or metabolism—to process food, air, and water through theentire system and to facilitate proper intellectual functioning. It requiresKapha—or structure—to hold cells together and to form muscles, fat, bones, andsinew.In Ayurveda, the whole process of digestion is described through metaphors ofheat and fire. When we say that Pitta is primarily responsible for digestion, weare referring to Pitta’s control over agni, the digestive fire, and over theother metabolic processes necessary for the absorption of nutrients throughoutthe gastrointestinal tract. But the physical movement of food through thedigestive tract is governed by Vata dosha, while the digestive fluids aregoverned by Kapha. Proper balance of all three—Vata, Pitta, and Kapha—isessential for ideal digestion and elimination.Your psychophysiological individuality is defined by the amount or proportion ofeach dosha that you naturally contain. If we say that someone is a Vata type, wemean that the Vata qualities are more evident in that individual. Similarly, ifwe say that someone is a Pitta type or a Kapha type, it means that the Pitta orKapha dosha is more dominant in that individual’s nature. Basically, everyonehas all three doshas, but we have them in combinations that are unique to eachof us.Knowing your body type will help you understand more about who you are and whyyou are experiencing any gastrointestinal symptoms. Below is the Body-TypeQuestionnaire, which will allow you to identify your dominant dosha. You shouldtake a few minutes to complete it before reading any further.AYURVEDA BODY-TYPE QUESTIONNAIREThe following quiz is divided into three sections. For the first 20 questions,which apply to Vata dosha, read each statement and mark, from 0 to 6, whether itapplies to you.0 = Doesn’t apply to me3 = Applies to me somewhat (or some of the time)6 = Applies to me mostly (or nearly all of the time)At the end of the section, write down your total Vata score. For example, if youmark a 6 for the first question, a 3 for the second, and a 2 for the third, yourtotal up to that point would be 6 + 3 + 2 = 11. Total the entire section in thisway, and you will arrive at your final Vata score. Proceed to the 20 questionsfor Pitta and those for Kapha.When you are finished, you will have three separate scores. Comparing these willdetermine your body type.For fairly objective physical traits, your choice will usually be obvious. Formental traits and behavior, which are more subjective, you should answeraccording to how you have felt and acted most of your life, or at least for thepast few years.SECTION 1: VATA[images/Chop_9780307558985_epub_005_r1.jpg][images/Chop_9780307558985_epub_006_r1.jpg]SECTION 2: PITTA[images/Chop_9780307558985_epub_007_r1.jpg][images/Chop_9780307558985_epub_008_r1.jpg]SECTION 3: KAPHA[images/Chop_9780307558985_epub_009_r1.jpg][images/Chop_9780307558985_epub_010_r1.jpg]HOW TO DETERMINE YOUR BODY TYPENow that you have added up your scores, you can determine your body type.Although there are only three doshas, remember that Ayurveda combines them inten ways to arrive at ten different body types.• If one score is much higher than the others, you are probably a singledoshatype.Single-Dosha TypesVataPittaKaphaYou are definitely a single-dosha type if your highest score is twice as high asthe next highest dosha score (for instance, Vata—90, Pitta—45, Kapha—35). Insingle-dosha types, the characteristics of Vata, Pitta, or Kapha predominate.Your next highest dosha may still show up in your natural tendencies, but itwill be much less distinct.• If no single dosha dominates, you are a two-dosha type.Two-Dosha TypesVata-Pitta or Pitta-VataPitta-Kapha or Kapha-PittaVata-Kapha or Kapha-VataIf you are a two-dosha type, the traits of your two leading doshas willpredominate. The higher one comes first in your body type, but both count.Most people are two-dosha types. A two-dosha type might have a score like this:Vata—80, Pitta—90, Kapha—20. If this was your score, you would consider yourselfto be a Pitta-Vata type.• If your three scores are nearly equal, you may be a three-dosha type.Three-Dosha TypeVata-Pitta-KaphaHowever, this type is considered rarest of all. Check your answers again, orhave a friend go over your responses with you. Also, you can read over thedescriptions of Vata, Pitta, and Kapha on pages 19–22 to see if one or twodoshas are more prominent in your makeup.VATACharacteristics of Vata Type * Light, thin build * Performs activity quickly * Irregular hunger and digestion * Light, interrupted sleep; tendency toward insomnia * Enthusiasm, vivaciousness, imagination * Excitability, changing moods * Quick to grasp new information, also quick to forget * Tendency to worry * Tendency to be constipated * Tires easily, tendency to overexert * Mental and physical energy comes in burstsIt is very Vata to * Be hungry at any time of the day or night * Love excitement and constant change * Go to sleep at different times every night, skip meals, and keep irregular habits in general * Digest food well one day and poorly the next * Display bursts of emotion that are short-lived and quickly forgotten * Walk quicklyChange is the basic theme of the Vata personality. Vata people are unpredictableand much less stereotyped than either Pittas or Kaphas. Variability—in size,shape, mood, and action—is their main characteristic. For a Vata person, mentaland physical energy appears suddenly. Vatas tend to walk quickly, to be hungryat any hour, to love excitement and change, to go to sleep at a different timeevery night, to skip meals, and to digest food well one day and poorly the next.PITTACharacteristics of Pitta Type * Medium build * Medium strength and endurance * Sharp hunger and thirst, strong digestion * Tendency to become angry or irritable under stress * Fair or ruddy skin, often freckled * Aversion to sun, hot weather * Enterprising character, likes challenges * Sharp intellect * Precise, articulate speech * Cannot skip meals * Blond, light brown, or red hair (or reddish undertones)It is very Pitta to * Feel ravenous if dinner is half an hour late * Live by your watch and resent having your time wasted * Wake up at night feeling hot and thirsty * Take command of a situation or feel that you should * Learn from experience that others find you too demanding, sarcastic, or critical at times * Have a determined stride when you walkThe theme of the Pitta type is intensity. Anyone with bright red hair and aflorid face contains a good deal of Pitta, as does anyone who is ambitious,sharp-witted, outspoken, bold, argumentative, or jealous. The combative side ofPitta is a natural tendency, but it does not have to be blatantly expressed.When in balance, Pittas are warm and ardent in their emotions, loving, andcontent. A face glowing with happiness is very Pitta. It is also very Pitta towalk with a determined stride, to feel ravenously hungry if dinner is half anhour late, to wake up at night feeling thirsty, to live by the clock, and toresent having your time wasted.KAPHACharacteristics of Kapha Type * Solid, powerful build; great physical strength and endurance * Steady energy; slow and graceful in action * Tranquil, relaxed personality; slow to anger * Cool, smooth, thick, pale, and often oily skin * Slow to grasp new information, but good retentive memory * Heavy, prolonged sleep * Tendency toward obesity * Slow digestion, mild hunger * Affectionate, tolerant, forgiving * Tendency to be possessive, complacentIt is very Kapha to * Mull things over for a long time before making a decision * Wake up slowly, lie in bed a long time, and need coffee upon arising * Be happy with the status quo and preserve it by conciliating others * Respect other people’s feelings (with which you feel genuine empathy) * Seek emotional comfort from eating * Have graceful movements, liquid eyes, and a gliding walk, even if overweightRelaxed is the best word to describe the Kapha type. Kapha dosha, the structuralprinciple in the body, brings stability and steadiness. It provides the physicalstrength and stamina that have been built in to the sturdy frames of typicalKapha people. Kaphas are considered fortunate in Ayurveda because as a rule theyenjoy sound health. Moreover, their personalities express a serene and happyview of the world. It is very Kapha to mull things over for a long time beforemaking a decision, to awaken slowly after lying in bed a long time, to seekemotional comfort from eating, to be happy with the status quo and to preserveit by conciliating others, and to genuinely empathize with other people’sfeelings.While knowing your body type provides insight into your natural constitution andyour physiological tendencies, you also need to consider whether the threedoshas are balanced or unbalanced in your body. In general, Vata types are morelikely to have Vata imbalances, Pitta types Pitta imbalances, and so on.However, this is not true in every case.When an Ayurvedic doctor looks at any person, he or she sees signs of the threedoshas everywhere. Although the doshas themselves cannot literally be seen,their effects can be recognized in all the physical characteristics of the body.And even though the doshas are invisible, they are tangible enough to beregulated, increased, decreased, and restored to balance.When you watch a color television set, the screen appears to be filled withpeople, trees, animals, or buildings. But if you look more closely, it becomesclear that the images are made up of three kinds of dots, called “phosphors.”The phosphors—which are red, green, and blue—are constantly shifting to form newimages. Whether you see intact images or merely colored dots depends entirely onhow close you are to the screen. Both perspectives are valid, but the dots aremore fundamental because they are the raw material of the images. Therefore, ifthe picture goes bad, it is the phosphors that the repairman must adjust.You can think of Vata, Pitta, and Kapha as three kinds of dots that compriseyour entire body and every aspect of its functioning. The way your liver,kidneys, and heart work, your levels of insulin and other hormones, and thefunctioning of your digestive tract are all patterns formed by the shiftinginterplay of the three doshas. The role of the Ayurvedic physician is to adjustthe body’s functioning by returning the doshas to their natural state ofbalance. Any approach to a health problem depends on how the problem isperceived or understood, and even something as apparently “physical” asgastrointestinal complaints can be successfully approached through the doshas.The Ayurvedic perspective is so comprehensive that it can account for all thepossible combinations of symptoms to which different individuals may be subject.As a result, a physician trained in Ayurveda is able to individualize apatient’s treatment program. The purpose of this book, however, is to offerrecommendations that are simple and helpful to the greatest number of people.Recognizing and understanding your Ayurvedic body type is the first,all-important step toward recognizing which recommendations will be of thegreatest benefit to you."},{"pageContent":"3UNDERSTANDING YOURDIGESTIVE TRACT:AN AYURVEDIC PERSPECTIVEWe have seen that GI tract is one of the most important parts of the humanphysiology, yet it usually does its job virtually unnoticed, with very littleconscious attention required. Although digestive processes are very complex,they are almost entirely automatic.But what happens when things go wrong in the GI tract, and what are the factorsmost likely to cause disturbance? Of all of the things that can happen to thedigestive tract, by far the most common is that constellation of symptomsdiscussed in chapter 1 [Chop_9780307558985_epub_c01_r1.htm], collectively calledIrritable Bowel Syndrome. In fact, IBS is sometimes referred to as the “commoncold of the intestinal tract.”The first thing to realize about IBS is the tremendous variation in the symptomsthat individuals can experience. Let’s start with the most frequent indications.• Abdominal pain, relieved by having a bowel movement. The pain is most commonlyexperienced in the lower left part of the abdomen, but its location andintensity may vary. Some individuals describe the pain as cramps, while othersexperience steady, dull, sharp, or even burning pain.• A bloated or distended abdomen. This symptom also is commonly relieved by abowel movement.• Loose and frequent bowel movements along with abdominal pain. It is notuncommon for loose bowel movements to alternate with constipation.• A feeling of incomplete evacuation. This is usually described as a sensationthat, in spite of having had a bowel movement, you have not completely emptiedyour bowel.While these are the most common symptoms, many others can occur as part of theIBS complex. Your symptoms, for example, may include chronic constipationwithout pain. Many individuals experience difficulty in passing stools, whichmay be small and hard or thin and “pencil-like.” Or, like millions of people,your principal symptom may be too much gas, without any other seriouscomplaints. Many people move from one symptom to another over a period of hours,days, or weeks. The important message of this chapter is that, from an Ayurvedicperspective, all IBS symptoms are related and can be understood as variations ona common theme.Most people with IBS have at least two of the symptoms described above. Asymptom that should not be present, however, is rectal bleeding. If youexperience this symptom, you should immediately consult a physician. It isimportant for anyone having symptoms in the GI tract—or in any other part of thebody—to receive professional care. I strongly urge you to consult your familyphysician for proper evaluation and diagnosis of your symptoms. The ideas inthis book are intended as a supplement to Western medicine, not as areplacement.In order to consider how symptoms arise in the GI tract, it is helpful first tohave an overview of your digestive tract and the workings of its various parts.As I describe the different organs and their functions, you can refer to thedrawing below.[images/Chop_9780307558985_epub_011_r1.jpg]Let’s begin our discussion of the digestive process where the process itselfactually begins—in the mouth. As you chew a piece of food, digestive enzymes aresecreted by the salivary glands located in your cheeks and under your tongue.Then, when you swallow, complex neuromuscular mechanisms ensure that the foodenters your esophagus—the tube that takes the food to the stomach—rather thanyour trachea, which leads into the lungs. Although it’s normally aided by theforce of gravity, the muscular action of your esophagus is capable oftransporting food to your stomach even if you’re standing on your head (not arecommended posture for eating).From the esophagus, food enters the stomach, where bacteria are killed bypowerful acidic secretions and food storage takes place. Indeed, the smallintestine, which follows the stomach in the GI tract, is largely a sterileenvironment as a result of the stomach’s activities, although a number ofparasites—such as tapeworms and hookworms—have the ability to pass through thestomach intact. Along with bacterial cleansing of swallowed food, digestioncontinues in the stomach by two means: mechanical grinding of the food takesplace through the stomach’s muscular action, while at the same time strongdigestive enzymes are breaking the food down into its component parts.It’s interesting to note that although the hydrochloric acid and digestiveenzymes in the stomach are powerful enough to attack and dissolve heavy proteinsand meats, under normal conditions these acids do not harm the lining of theorgan itself. When this natural protection is compromised, however, erosions ofthe stomach lining may result. These are known as peptic ulcers.Ayurveda teaches that the digestive processes of both the mouth and the stomachare dominated by Kapha dosha. Kapha regulates liquids throughout the body,including saliva and the various secretions of the stomach lining. When thephysiology of a Kapha individual is unbalanced, there may be nausea brought onby excessive production of stomach acids; an overabundance of mucus may also bepresent, both in the GI tract and in the respiratory system. Attacks of vomitingare seen more frequently among Kapha types than in other individuals, as aresult of mucus accumulating in the stomach. This can be brought on byoverindulgence in Kapha-dominated foods, especially fatty meats and dairyproducts.Upon leaving the stomach, food passes into the small intestine, which is in manyrespects the most important part of the entire digestive tract. This area isdominated by Pitta dosha, which controls the secretion of the small intestine’sdigestive enzymes.The small intestine is not really small. It is narrow in diameter, but it’sfully twenty feet in length. It is divided into sections, each of which has itsown role in the digestive process. The interior is lined with millions of tinyprojections called “villi,” which, by greatly increasing the surface area, allowthe intestine to absorb nutrients and to transport them into the bloodstream.Some of the most dangerous conditions that can afflict the small intestineinvolve an inability to absorb nutrition even though food may have been properlydigested.Michael Oppenheim, M.D., author of The Complete Book of Better Digestion, haspointed out that Western medicine tends to regard the small intestine as aremarkably disease-free organ. Although stomach cancer and especially coloncancer are common, malignancies of the small intestine rarely develop, and thesmall intestine is commonly exempt from the bleeding and irritation thatfrequently occur in other areas of the GI tract. In its wisdom, Nature seems tohave given the small intestine a kind of special immunity, perhaps because it’sthe most vital of all the digestive organs.From the Ayurvedic perspective, however, the small intestine can be the site ofa great many disorders, particularly since it is the seat of agni, the digestivefire, which is discussed in detail in chapter 4[Chop_9780307558985_epub_c04_r1.htm]. In Sanskrit, the small intestine is calledgrahani, meaning “that which grasps things.” In other words, the smallintestine, by process of absorption, “grasps” the essence of foods, and it ishere that food is metabolized on the level of its nutritional intelligence.Poor functioning of the small intestine can have many consequences, ranging fromdiarrhea, fatigue, and poor appetite to the more serious problem ofmalabsorption. Many Ayurvedic physicians view intestinal malabsorption as muchmore widespread than Western medicine acknowledges; since it is difficult todiagnose at low levels, it simply goes unrecognized by many people, as well asby their doctors, according to the Ayurvedic view.An unhealthy diet is often the cause of intestinal malabsorption, particularlywhen one type of food is emphasized at the expense of all the others. In theUnited States, this usually means too many sweets or too much meat. But eatingalmost anything exclusively can damage the digestive fire. Ill-advisedmedications, such as laxatives and pain killers, or stimulants, such ascaffeine, can also bring on this problem. Vata types, since they tend to drink agreat deal of coffee, are especially prone to malabsorption.The solution to intestinal malabsorption is a varied diet that avoidshard-to-digest foods or extremes of any kind. Meals should be of moderate size.Foods should be neither overcooked nor raw, and extremely hot or cold foodsshould be avoided. Buttermilk is very beneficial for this problem, as we’ll see.When the small intestine is functioning well, the nutritional intelligence itabsorbs enters the circulatory system to nourish the entire physiology. Manynutrients travel to the liver, where intricate metabolic processes help convertthe food into energy. The liver is also very active in removing toxic impuritiesfrom the system.As a Pitta organ, the liver gives rise to such “hot” emotions as anger, envy,and ambition. As a result, Ayurveda teaches that the liver is prone tooverheating, which is the cause of many inflammatory diseases.Organs such as the pancreas and the gallbladder also assist in the complex jobof digesting food. The pancreas plays an important role in digestion through theproduction of insulin and other hormones, while the gallbladder stores andsecretes bile, an oily green liquid that is produced by the liver and assists indigestion of fats. All these functions are under the control of Pitta, whichliterally means “bile” in Sanskrit.Normally, it takes three to five hours for food to pass through the smallintestine, during which time many of the nutrients needed to support the bodyare absorbed. The remaining mixture of undigested food, mostly in liquid form,is now ready to pass into the colon, a muscular tube about four feet in length.The colon is also referred to as the “large intestine” because its diameter isapproximately the size of your fist, whereas the small intestine has a diameteronly about the size of your big toe. Within the colon, nutrients are absorbedthat are vital to the brain and to the body’s entire neurological system. Thisthird and final stage of digestion is controlled by the Vata (air) dosha.Unbalanced Vata types are likely to suffer from gas or constipation owing topoor function of the colon.From the esophagus to the beginning of the colon the gastrointestinal tract isalmost free of bacteria. But the colon contains more than four hundred distinctbacterial species that play an active role in absorbing excess water andnutrients and in passing stools through the colon for eventual evacuation. Infact, about one-third of the material present in the colon is bacterial innature, and it is estimated that up to half of the stool we pass each day isbacterial.Depending on the individual, waste material may spend anywhere from four hoursto three days moving through the colon before entering the last twelve inches ofthe digestive tract, which is the rectum. Once the material enters the rectum,it stretches the walls of the bowel and stimulates a reflex urge to have a bowelmovement.A person’s pattern of elimination, as well as the physical characteristics ofthe stool itself, are key indicators of the quality of his or her digestion.It’s important to pay attention to these very meaningful signs of physiologicalhealth or imbalance. If, for example, your stools have a consistently bad odor,this suggests the presence of toxins in your GI system as a whole, andparticularly inadequate digestion in your large intestine. Ayurveda prescribes anumber of spices for improving colonic absorption, the most common of which areblack pepper, ginger, and nutmeg.I hope this description conveys something of the wondrous complexity andprecision of the digestive process as well as the relationships among itsvarious parts. It is because of these integral relationships that a symptomrelated to the function of the colon—such as diarrhea, pain, or constipation,for example—may in fact have originated much farther up the digestive tract, oreven outside the tract altogether. Other than the brain and the central nervoussystem, no other part of the human body is as sensitive to the numerousinfluences of environment and everyday living as is the digestive system."},{"pageContent":"4HOW TO MAKE FRIENDSWITH YOUR GUTSince Ayurveda sees good digestion as one of the pillars of perfect health, itfollows that poor digestion is a major factor in the production of disease. Infact, Ayurvedic medicine considers nothing to be more important to your overallhealth than the quality of your digestion. There is a saying in Ayurveda that ifyou had to choose between a proper diet along with poor digestion or a poor dietaccompanied with ideal digestion, the latter choice would be the wiser. Ofcourse, it’s best to have both perfect digestion and proper diet, but theimportant point is that for a balanced diet to have its proper effect, digestionmust be strong enough and balanced enough to properly assimilate the nutrientscontained in that diet. Remember that every cell in your body has been createdfrom the foods you’ve eaten. If the food has been used well, the cells will bebuilt well. But if the food has been badly used, the process of disease hasalready started. Ayurvedic sages liked to say that if you could digest itproperly, even poison could be good for you, while with poor digestion, a personcan die from drinking nectar.Because the process of digestion is described in Ayurveda as a heating process,one of the most important principles in Ayurvedic medicine is called agni, whichtranslates as “digestive fire.” Agni is nothing less than a divine power thatexists within you and that governs the health of your physiology. When thisinternal fire is appropriately nourished and kept burning at proper intensity,all the systems of your body will flourish. Your GI system will digest foodefficiently and distribute all the necessary nutrients to every cell, while atthe same time burning off waste products without leaving deposits of toxins.Your whole body will be in tune. But neglect of the digestive flame can show upin any number of ways, from unpleasant breath and body odor to a weakened immunesystem and vulnerability to infection.Ayurveda recognizes four distinct conditions of agni—too high, too low, toovariable, or in perfect balance. To a great extent, these conditions are relatedto specific doshas. Pitta types, for example, tend to experience excessiveappetite as a result of a digestive flame that burns too high. Kapha, the waterdosha, can suffer from low agni, resulting in low energy levels and a tendencyto put on weight even if food consumption is not excessive. Vata types, for whomchange is characteristic in every area of life, are likely to undergo theextremes of hunger and loss of appetite that result from an excessively variabledigestive flame. In general, agni can be strengthened and increased by mostforms of exercise, or even by just breathing deeply for several minutes—anexercise that Ayurveda calls Pranayama. Agni is diminished by long periods ofsleep, withdrawal from physical activity, and by large portions of heavy, oily,or sweet foods.[images/Chop_9780307558985_epub_L02_r1.jpg]When you’re hungry, the burning sensation you feel in your gut occurs becausethe agni is burning hotter. This burning should be understood as a signal thatyour body is ready to accept and process food. If you eat only at these times,your food will be properly digested. Many physiological problems are caused byeating at times when the digestive fires are not really calling out for fuel.Consequently, the food is converted into fat and toxins rather than energy. Thisis the basis for much of the overweight so common in the West.When all of the body’s systems are functioning in a normal and healthy way, thedigestive tract produces as an ultimate result a substance known as ojas. Ojasis described in Ayurveda as a biochemical located at the meeting point betweenconsciousness and physiology, like a bridge connecting intelligence and matter.Ojas serves to integrate the entire physiology at the point of mind/bodyjunction.Cherak, the ancient sage who was one of the first Ayurvedic physicians,described ojas this way: “It is ojas which maintains all living beings by itssaturation, and without ojas no life of creatures exists. Ojas is the initialessence of embryo and also the essence of its nourishing material. It entersfirst into the cardiac cycle and if it is destroyed it leads to destruction. Itis the sustainer of life in the heart, it is the cream of the nutrient fluids inthe body.”Ayurveda teaches that when ojas is energetically produced by the body, there isa sense of overall lightness, excellent energy, strong appetite, balanced andcomfortable digestion, regular elimination, strong immunity, superb physicalstrength, and great stamina. But perhaps the most important sign of the presenceof ojas is a sense of emotional well-being and happiness. According to Ayurveda,ojas is literally the biochemical equivalent of bliss. This has enormouslysignificant implications. By increasing the presence of ojas in your body, youcan rebuild yourself into the physical manifestation of strength and goodhealth.There is another substance described in Ayurveda that is the opposite of ojas inevery way. This chemical, ama, is of a sticky nature and has a marked tendencyto obstruct the channels through which ojas normally flows.Ama can result from improper dietary habits, a self-destructive lifestyle,imbalances in digestion, or many other factors. The most obvious differencebetween ojas and ama is that ojas makes you feel well, while ama makes you feelsick; in fact, ama is the precursor of most diseases. In addition, there aresome specific signs of ama’s presence in the body: a feeling of heaviness,weakness, or lethargy, increased susceptibility to infectious diseases, problemswith digestion and elimination, fatigue, and fluctuations in appetite, energylevels, and emotional stability.Many symptoms of Irritable Bowel Syndrome—constipation, for example—are causedby the production of ama. As ama accumulates, digestion becomes disturbed andmore ama is produced in turn. If you have experienced IBS symptoms in your lowergastrointestinal tract, you very likely have experienced other ama-relatedsymptoms as well, such as fatigue or frequent colds. There is also a veryvisible sign of ama that you may have noticed without recognizing itsimportance. This is a white coating on the tongue, which appears most often inthe morning. This coating is quite literally ama, and when it is present on thetongue it is also present throughout the digestive canals of your body. Andremember that Ayurveda recognizes these channels as existing not only asconduits for blood, lymph, and nutrients derived from food, but for the flow oflife energy itself.Elimination of ama from your physiology is an important first step in solvingintestinal problems. There are two basic strategies for accomplishing this:First, you can strengthen your overall digestion, which will naturally retardthe formation of further ama; second, you can begin to apply some gentlepurification procedures in order to eliminate ama that may already haveaccumulated in your body.Let’s look at some Ayurvedic techniques for strengthening digestion. Bymobilizing the body’s own inner intelligence, these simple techniques can makedigestion a comfortable and efficient process that will foster ojas and retardama. Some of these procedures will require changes in your current habits, but Ithink you’ll find that the benefits are immediately apparent.Eat in a Settled and Quiet AtmosphereThis is one of the most important principles for the treatment of IrritableBowel Syndrome and related complaints. In fact, it’s one of the most importantrecommendations in this entire book. Few things contribute more to bowelirritability than such habits as eating on the run, eating while you’re working,or engaging in arguments at mealtime. It is very important that you take yourmeals during a settled and pleasant time of day when you can be free ofdistractions. This is almost always possible, even if you’re very busy and haveonly twenty or thirty minutes in which to eat.You really must set everything else aside at mealtime in order to allow yourbody to focus only on eating and digesting. With your attention exclusively onthe meal in front of you, you can savor all of the flavors and properly extractthe intelligence from the food.Take a Few Minutes to Rest Quietly After Your MealBy relaxing at the completion of a meal, before returning to another activity,you can allow the digestive process to begin in an effortless way. But you maybe in the habit of hurrying out the door just as you finish your last bite—or,worse, taking some of the food with you to eat on the run. Remember that anothername for IBS is “nervous stomach,” so resolve to be more calm and sensible aboutyour eating habits.While Ayurveda recommends that everyone spend a few minutes relaxing after ameal, I suggest that anyone with Irritable Bowel Syndrome should actually liedown for a few minutes after eating whenever possible. It’s not necessary ordesirable to go to sleep during this time, but lying on your back or on yourleft side for five to ten minutes allows the digestive process to begin morecomfortably and naturally.Many people also find it helpful to settle down for a few minutes before eating.Try sitting quietly by yourself for about five minutes before you begin yourmeal, and do so at the meal’s conclusion, before returning to work or otheractivities. You’ll find that this small investment of time can return majorbenefits to digestion and general health.Always Sit Down to EatSitting down relaxes the digestive tract, helps focus your awareness on theprocess of eating, and enhances enjoyment of your food. Even if you’re justhaving a snack of a few grapes or raisins, take the time to sit down at a table.Don’t Eat When You’re UpsetMost people with Irritable Bowel Syndrome have already discovered that eatingwhen you’re emotionally upset can trigger symptoms. If you’re upset at mealtime,wait a few minutes or more until you’re feeling calmer.In his book Gastrointestinal Health, Steven Peiken, M.D., refers to someremarkably graphic demonstrations of the relationship between stress andsatisfactory digestion. During the nineteenth century, an army surgeon was ableto study a patient who, as a result of a gunshot wound, had developed apermanently open passage between the interior of his stomach and the surface ofhis body. Over the course of prolonged observation it became obvious that thepatient’s emotional state caused variations in the coating that protects thestomach lining, the “mucosa.” When the patient was emotionally upset, there wasalso an increase in the production of acid and a slowing of normal stomachcontractions, so that acid-rich secretions remained in the stomach longer thanusual. Severe irritation resulted.All this, of course, has been known to Ayurveda for thousands of years. As aKapha organ, the stomach is fundamental to the structure and stability of thebody in a physical sense; it is also closely tied to emotional equilibrium. InAyurveda the stomach is sometimes referred to as the “mother” of the entirebody.Here is a technique that can help you settle down and minimize stress. Sitquietly and close your eyes for twenty or thirty seconds. With your eyes closed,you may become aware of uncomfortable physical sensations in your body thataccompany your emotional distress, because every mental sensation has acorresponding physical effect. Just keep your eyes closed and simply allowyourself to experience the uncomfortable physical sensation for a few seconds.Don’t try to resist it, just experience it. Within a minute or so, the sensationwill usually weaken or even disappear. When you open your eyes, you may findthat your emotional discomfort has also diminished. Once you’re comfortable,proceed with your meal.Avoid OvereatingAyurveda says that we should eat to about three-fourths of our actual foodcapacity. Eating beyond this point doesn’t leave enough room for the stomach tofunction properly, and ama is the result.Three-fourths capacity is actually the point of maximum eating comfort, whichgives a feeling of satisfaction without any sensation of having overeaten. Itmay take a bit of practice to end your meals at this point, especially if you’reused to overeating, but in a short while you’ll feel much more comfortable whenyou end your meals before you feel full.Avoid Cold Foods and Iced DrinksCold foods and drinks tends to freeze the digestive fires and thereby make theproduction of ama more likely. In Ayurvedic terms, this problem may be describedas a Vata imbalance, since Vata is cold and dry by nature. To remedy this, youshould favor foods and drinks that are well cooked, warm, and soothing.Many people find that it takes some effort to give up iced cold drinks, whichmay be a lifelong habit, particularly in warm weather. But within a few weeksmost people no longer miss the cold drinks and actually feel better withoutthem. An Ayurvedic herbal tea blend, called Vata tea, is an ideal substitute forthe cold drinks you’ve been having. It’s not only warm and soothing in itsnature, but it’s specifically formulated to help pacify Vata.Don’t Talk While Chewing Your FoodWhile chewing and swallowing, you should allow your senses to go inward andenjoy the taste, sight, and smell of the food. Not speaking while you have foodin your mouth will help accomplish this. You can still have conversations at thedinner table, of course, but they should be of a settled and light nature.Mealtime is not an occasion for dealing with emotionally sensitive issues. Forthe same reason, business lunches should be avoided.Eat at a Moderate PaceBy taking time to chew thoroughly, you’ll enjoy your food more, and you’llenhance the process of digestion. If you’re a fast eater, I recommend a simpletechnique that, over time, can help you regulate your eating speed. After eachbite of food has entered your mouth, simply put your fork or spoon down anddon’t pick it up again until that bite has been swallowed. After a week or twoof doing this, you’ll find that your pace of eating has naturally become moremoderate.Don’t Eat Until the Preceding Meal Has Been DigestedContinuous snacking produces ama. Suppose you were cooking bean soup but youkept adding a new batch of beans every thirty minutes. The soup would never becompletely cooked! When you snack throughout the day, your digestive tract isnever able to properly process the food you’ve eaten.How long should you wait between meals? For most people, complete digestionusually takes from three to six hours. If you feel like having a snack duringthat time, make it something light, like a piece of fruit or a warm beverage.Favor Meals Made with Freshly Cooked FoodsBecause fresh foods have the greatest intelligence value, they facilitate theproduction of ojas. Conversely, leftovers are harder to digest and are morelikely to produce ama.Although many people believe that raw foods are a good source of dietary fiber,Ayurveda points out that raw foods are harder to digest and are more likely toirritate the colon. While a certain amount of raw food, such as salad, is fineto include in your diet, cooked foods in general are easier to digest.It may require a bit of effort to incorporate all these suggestions into youreating patterns. Lifelong habits may be difficult to amend even when you knowthat they’re not beneficial to your health. But it’s important to remember thatthese very patterns helped to create your digestive problems.The checklist on pages 42–43 is based on the suggestions we’ve discussed. Bymaking copies of the list and filling them out each day, you can change youreating habits in an organized and stress-free way. If you begin by incorporatingjust one suggestion, then add another each week, you can easily improve yourdaily eating routines.Now that we’ve strengthened digestion, let’s explore several strategies topurify the body, specifically designed to eliminate ama.The first technique involves devoting one day each week to an entirely liquiddiet. By liquefying all your food in a blender, you’ll ensure that your mealsare of a light consistency and are easily processed by the digestive tract. Thisstrengthens digestion and at the same time eliminates ama from the system. Tryfollowing this liquefied diet once a week for one or two months, then decidewhether you want to continue it. If you feel comfortable and notice obviousbenefits, you can use the liquefied diet every week for an indefinite period, oryou may want to cut back to just once a month. You’ll probably find that it’seasiest to follow this routine on days when you don’t have manyresponsibilities, such as on the weekend.Remember, this is not a fast. Anything can be included in your diet as long asit’s liquefied. To liquefy a food, simply place it in a blender and add warmwater. You may take the liquids or liquefied foods as often as you like duringthe day. Soups, herbal teas, fresh fruit or vegetable juices, and grains thathave been blended with water are obviously very well suited to this routine,while meat, fish, and poultry are definitely much less so. Proceed according toyour appetite. Some people will feel strong and energetic even while taking onlyfresh fruit juices all day. Others, who find that they need more substance inthe diet, can liquefy grains and vegetables in order to feel more at ease.BODY INTELLIGENCE TECHNIQUES CHECKLIST[images/Chop_9780307558985_epub_012_r1.jpg][images/Chop_9780307558985_epub_013_r1.jpg]Always let comfort be your guide. When you use the liquefied diet properly, youshould feel light and energetic throughout the day.The second recommendation for eliminating ama from the system is a very specialAyurvedic purification technique. It sounds very simple, but you’ll find that ithas a powerful influence in purifying and strengthening the gastrointestinaltract.All you have to do is sip hot water frequently throughout the day. As mentionedearlier, ama is sticky and greasy by nature. Hot water can dissolve ama fromyour system just as it dissolves grease from dirty dishes, and it can accomplishthis gradually and comfortably. There is, however, a specific routine that youmust follow in order to gain maximum benefit from this technique.First, the water should be very hot—ideally, so hot that you’ve got to blow onit before you sip. But if you have difficulty drinking water this hot, adjustthe temperature accordingly.Second, be aware that the quantity of water you drink is less important than thefrequency with which you drink it. For best results, the water should be sippedabout every thirty minutes. If this seems too much for you, take at least one ortwo sips every hour.You may have other liquids during the day as well—herbal tea, for example—butalways take the hot water. And remember to do so as often as comfortallows—three or four times a day definitely is not enough. Perhaps the easiestway to accomplish this is to buy a good quality thermal container, fill it inthe morning with boiling water, and use it throughout the day. In a short timeyou’ll begin to appreciate the soothing and balancing effect of this technique.Once they’ve gotten used to it, most people even look forward to drinking thewater on a frequent basis.During the first few weeks you may urinate more frequently, and your urine mayincrease by even more than the amount you’ve increased your fluid intake. Thisis because the body is beginning to flush out ama and other impurities. It’s asign that something beneficial is happening to your system. Gradually, thefrequency of urination should return to normal, but the ama will continue to bedissolved from the system.In the West, we have grown accustomed to looking for chemical remedies for ourhealth concerns. Many people expect or even demand that some form of medicationbe prescribed whenever they visit a doctor’s office, regardless of what broughtthem there. This is not the Ayurvedic way. While recognizing that drugs can beof great benefit in many areas of health care, particularly in acute situations,Ayurveda teaches us to look elsewhere for solutions to chronic conditions thathave developed from fundamental imbalances in the physiology. The herbalsupplements that Ayurveda does recommend are not intended simply to alleviatesymptoms; rather, their purpose is to strengthen the mind/body constitution atbasic levels and to rectify the imbalances that underlie all symptoms. In anycase, Ayurvedic herbs are not “drugs” in the sense that we’ve come to understandthat word. Unlike the highly concentrated, mass-manufactured pills that comprisemost of the prescriptions dispensed in pharmacies, herbs are simply derivativesof plants. Ultimately, they are manifestations of the sun’s radiant energy,which has been transformed by the process of photosynthesis into a physicalobject. By taking the sun’s energy into your body in herbal form, you are makingcontact with the source of all life. Be conscious of this profound connectionwhenever you take herbal supplements. Your high level of awareness will make theherbs even more effective.Below are some Ayurvedic herbs that can benefit digestion. Although eachperson’s needs are unique, combinations of these herbs have generally provedbeneficial to digestive processes. They are available through Ayurvedicresources, whose addresses are provided at the back of this book. * Amalaki relieves irritations throughout the gastrointestinal system and stabilizes the blood-sugar irregularities that underlie cravings for unhealthy foods. * Bibihitaki, which has strong but safe laxative properties, is useful for expelling Kapha accumulations in the digestive organs. * Chitrak reduces hyperacidity and ama accumulation. By facilitating absorption, it prevents stagnation in the GI system. * Dhanyaka, known in the West as coriander, benefits Pitta conditions in the GI tract for which most spices and herbs are contraindicated. * Lavanga, or cloves, have heating and energizing effects that stimulate digestion.In this chapter we’ve covered a number of simple but effective techniques forstrengthening digestion, for cleansing ama from the body, and, in short, for“making friends with your gut.” In chapter 5[Chop_9780307558985_epub_c05_r1.htm], we’ll look in detail at the foods anddietary regimens most helpful for the elimination of symptoms and for creatingperfect health."},{"pageContent":"5DIET AND THE ART OFDETERMINING WHAT TO EATWithout proper diet medicine is of no use, and with proper diet medicine is ofno need.This is an old Ayurvedic precept, and it should come as no surprise to anyonesuffering digestive problems that diet is of primary importance. It seemsobvious that what we eat will have a basic effect on how we digest and how weeliminate, yet most doctors don’t give sufficient attention to diet in thetreatment of IBS and other bowel complaints. Perhaps one of the reasons for thisis the complexity of dealing with the many variations in individual responses tospecific dietary measures. Yet, from an Ayurvedic perspective, these variationsare perfectly understandable; how one responds to a given dietary instructionwill depend to a great extent on which doshas have become unbalanced in thebody.The main distinction between modern Western nutrition and the Ayurvedicperspectives can be expressed very simply. It is the distinction between astrictly materialist view of reality and a view that encompasses values at otherlevels as well. Western nutritionists believe that we can best understand ourfood by evaluating its material qualities. Think of the broad range ofnutritional terminology that has become familiar to us all: protein,carbohydrates, fats, minerals, cholesterol, vitamins, calories, and many more.Each of these terms describes a particular material quality of the food; acalorie, for instance, is a unit of energy that a food produces when it’s burnedor metabolized by the body.While there’s no doubt that analyzing food according to its material qualitiesis a worthwhile method of evaluation, Ayurveda also considers a food’sintelligence value. While recognizing the material value of food, Ayurveda alsoacknowledges that an even more basic influence exists in every substance. Thisinfluence, located at the point of mind/body junction, is what Ayurvedicintelligence really means.Recognizing the central importance of intelligence is like recognizing that atree is comprised of different structural elements such as branches, bark,leaves, and seeds. The most effective way to strengthen the tree is not bydealing individually with each part but by making a more basic approach throughthe sap, which carries nature’s intelligence to each and every area of the tree.By calling our attention to this basic fact of a food’s intelligence, Ayurvedasimplifies the use of dietary measures in the treatment and prevention ofdisease, whether it’s Irritable Bowel Syndrome or any other complaint.Ayurveda provides a number of means for locating and identifying the qualitiesof intelligence in food. Perhaps the most interesting technique is based on thetaste of the food itself.When food speaks to your doshas it says many different things, but the primaryinformation is contained in taste. As your taste buds greet a bite of food, anenormous amount of useful information is delivered to your body. By working withthis information and following your instincts, you can eat a balanced dieteasily and naturally.Ayurveda recognizes six distinct tastes. Sweet, sour, salty, and bitter are thefour with which you are probably familiar, but there are two others: pungent andastringent. All spicy, hot-tasting food is pungent, while astringent is a tastethat has a drying quality and causes the mouth to pucker. Pomegranates and beansare both examples of the astringent taste.Here are some further examples of each taste:Sweet: sugar, honey, rice, pasta, milk, cream, butterSour: lemons, cheese, yogurt, plums, vinegarSalty: any salty foodPungent: chili peppers, cayenne, ginger, any hot spiceBitter: greens such as endive, spinach, romaine lettuceAstringent: beans, lentils, pomegranates, apples, pearsWith the elegance that is characteristic of so many natural functions, the sixtastes are digested in an orderly progression. Sweet is metabolized first,followed by sour, salty, pungent, bitter, and astringent. It is interesting tonote, however, that this sequence does not parallel the order in which our foodsare typically eaten. Sweets, in the form of desserts, are virtually always takenat the end of a meal, but it’s really healthier—and better for weight control—ifsweets are eaten first. Similarly, salads are easier to digest if they’re takenlast (which is quite common in Europe). It’s important to look at a mealholistically. As we’ve discussed, the sequence of foods comprised in each mealis particularly important. Good digestion and good nutrition are more than amatter of simply knowing what to eat and in what quantity.The six tastes play an important part in balancing a diet and in creating afeeling of satisfaction after eating. These tastes are exquisite indicators ofthe intelligence of our physiologies. We can detect sweet taste in a dilution of1 in 200. Salt can be perceived in a dilution of 1 in 400; and bitter can bedetected in a solution of 1 in 2 million. Nature has evolved and refined oursense of taste in order to allow food to speak to our doshas, and the dietaryrecommendations given in this chapter are derived from Ayurvedic knowledge ofthis exquisite sensitivity.In the following pages we’ll consider a number of dietary recommendations, someof which will be more useful depending on your particular symptoms. As you putthe suggestions into practice, be sure to continue filling out the daily BodyIntelligence Techniques Checklist provided in chapter 4[Chop_9780307558985_epub_c04_r1.htm] in order to determine what effect thesechanges are having on your digestion. Bear in mind that changes in your dietwill exert their influence not just in the hours after the food is taken butover the next few days or even weeks.The first recommendation is to try to include foods from all six tastes in yourdiet every day. A balanced diet will always have the six tastes present, butindividual needs may require them in different proportions. For example, mostpeople with IBS should avoid very hot spices such as curry, garlic, pepper, ormustard. Yet there is one pungent spice—ginger—that tastes hot but actually hasa soothing effect on many IBS symptoms. A bit of ginger can be included duringcooking, but a special blend of ginger, lemon juice, and salt can also be takenseparately to stimulate digestion. To prepare this mixture, cut a thin slicefrom the end of a fresh ginger root, remove the peel, chop until very fine, andadd a few drops of lemon juice and a pinch of salt. Ideally, the mixture shouldbe eaten thirty minutes before lunch and dinner, but it can also be takenimmediately before the meal to aid in digestion and soothe the large bowel.For most people who experience IBS symptoms, spices such as turmeric, fenugreek,mint leaves, and coriander leaves will also be helpful. Mint has been used forthousands of years as a part of the treatment of IBS, and it’s still a popularremedy in many parts of Europe in the form of peppermint oil capsules. Usingfresh mint leaves is a very pleasant and effective way to utilize this herb, andthe leaves can be incorporated into many foods or beverages. In addition, aspecial blend of spices and herbs is available that is soothing to both Vata andthe digestive tract. This blend is called Vata churna (“churna” simply meanspowder). Vata churna can be sprinkled onto your food at the table or used incooking. Vata churna will simplify your choice of spices, and most people enjoyits pleasant taste. It can be ordered from the Ayurvedic sources listed at theend of this book.What foods should you avoid? Obviously, you should stay away from any food thathas caused you frequent problems. But as you gradually strengthen yourdigestion, you may find that certain formerly difficult foods no longer affectyou. Most people should avoid heavy dairy products such as milk, cream, icecream, and butter, at least until their IBS symptoms are brought under control.However, many patients with IBS can benefit from ghee, or clarified butter.Taken in small amounts, you may find that ghee actually is soothing to yourdigestive tract. Information about purchasing ghee or preparing it at home isincluded at the end of the book.Ayurveda also recommends avoiding cucumbers, green leafy vegetables such asspinach and kale, sprouts of any sort, and grapes. Deep fried, oily, or verygreasy foods are difficult to digest and are also best avoided.Since caffeine disturbs both Vata and Pitta, it’s best to avoid coffee, tea,chocolate, and caffeine-containing soft beverages. Also, carbonated beverages ofany sort irritate the digestive tract, as do alcohol and cigarettes.In deciding which foods to include in your diet, the first important principleis: The fresher the food, the better. But remember that fresh does notnecessarily mean raw. You should favor freshly cooked, balanced, wholesomemeals, with plenty of freshly cooked vegetable and whole grains. As much aspossible, avoid packaged foods and foods prepared with artificial chemicals andpreservatives.GRAINSRice, barley, corn, millet, buckwheat, and rye are all perfectly acceptable.These should be unsweetened, and if possible they should be organically grown.HONEYHoney is an ideal sweetener, although sugar can also be used in moderatequantities. It’s worth mentioning that Ayurveda recommends never cooking with orheating honey, as this changes the structure of the honey and produces a toxiceffect.FRUITSFruits such as apples, pears, and oranges can be included in your diet, but onefruit that is often especially recommended for the treatment of IBS is thepomegranate. Pomegranates have an astringent taste, which for many peoplesoothes the cramping and diarrhea associated with IBS.LASSIThis traditional Ayurvedic beverage also has many benefits, and it is easilyprepared from yogurt and water. Lassi has a very soothing and nourishing effecton the entire digestive tract and can be taken with lunch every day, as a snackin the late afternoon, or whenever you like. When made properly, most peoplealso find it delicious. A specific lassi recipe for treating IBS is included atthe end of this book.FIBERIn recent years dietary fiber has become part of the treatment and prevention ofmany disorders, so it merits some detailed discussion.Modern interest in dietary fiber began with the pioneering studies on indigenousAfrican populations conducted by D. R Burkett, M.D. He discovered that thetypical African tribesman produced more than three times the quantity of stoolper day than the typical Englishman. At the same time, he found that theincidence of appendicitis, colon cancer, diverticulosis, hiatal hernia, andother bowel problems was much lower in the African population. Dr. Burkettconcluded that the reason for this was related to the large quantities ofnatural fiber in the diet of the African population. Conversely, more recentstudies have linked low levels of dietary fiber to digestive complaints rangingfrom constipation to colon cancer.Although fiber has become a buzzword for both the public and the medicalprofession, the average daily consumption of dietary fiber in the United Statesis still less than half that of many so-called underdeveloped nations, and it isalso significantly less than the official recommendation of the National CancerInstitute.Perhaps fiber consumption has remained low because of the focus on fibersupplements. While most physicians provide their patients with lists of highfiber foods, many people turn to supplements in order to avoid making basicchanges in their eating habits. But since supplements have little or no tasteand are unappealing as food, people generally do not stay with them for verylong.Ayurveda teaches that fiber and every other nutrient should come to us throughthe whole foods we eat, not through supplements. It simply isn’t possible toacquire the full nutritional benefits of any substance once it has been removedfrom its natural context and turned into a pill or a powder.MEATYears ago vegetarian diets were considered food fads, and adhering to them wasthought to indicate a degree of mental imbalance. But today, of course, manynutritionists tell us that a well-balanced vegetarian diet is the best coursefor good health and longevity. Although Ayurveda has always recognized thebenefits of a meatless diet, it’s not necessary for you to become a vegetarianin order to gain the benefits of Ayurvedic techniques. In fact, since mostAmericans are committed to meat as a regular part of their diet, it’s importantto find a way to accommodate Ayurveda to this fact.Ayurveda by no means recommends making sudden or dramatic changes in a diet thatyou may have been following for many years. Rather, changes should be madegradually and intelligently. Therefore, while you do not need to set a goal ofbecoming a vegetarian, I do recommend that you begin to increase the amount offresh fruits, vegetables, and grains in your diet and that you diminish theamount of meat. You might try eating fewer meals containing red meats such asbeef and pork, favoring chicken and fish instead. Then gradually adjust yourdiet so that one or two days each week are entirely vegetarian. In any case,always be sure that your meals are balanced, wholesome, and appealing. Manyexcellent vegetarian cookbooks are available that can help you achieve this.The information above can be useful to anyone, but you can further individualizeyour choice of foods by giving consideration to your Ayurvedic body type.If your primary symptom is constipation, for example, and you don’t have any ofthe other symptoms associated with Irritable Bowel Syndrome, you may benefitfrom the Vata-balancing diet, which appears at the end of this chapter. Noticethat the Vata-balancing diet encourages a number of relatively heavy foods; thisis because Vata is light by nature. The Vata diet also allows all dairyproducts. It includes oils because the drying quality of Vata is a common causeof constipation.If loose and frequent bowel movements are your primary symptoms, either with orwithout abdominal discomfort, you may find that following the Pitta-balancingdiet is most useful for you. Or the Kapha diet may be indicated by yoursymptoms. If you’re not sure which diet is best for you, follow the instructionprovided in this chapter for one or two months. Then, if you’re not satisfiedwith your progress, try switching to one of the specific dosha regimens asdictated by your symptoms and your body type.There is one more important point to cover before we leave the area of diet, andthat is how to eat your meals. Chapter 4 [Chop_9780307558985_epub_c04_r1.htm]provided some recommendations for making mealtimes calmer, quieter, and moresettled. But there is another technique that is very helpful in treatingIrritable Bowel Syndrome, and it’s related to what I said earlier about theorder in which the six tastes are taken during a meal. This technique involveseating each meal in a specific sequence, and taking care to eat only one food ata time. There are two main reasons why this sequence diet can be useful forpeople with IBS. First, eating foods one at a time makes the work of digestion alittle less difficult for your body. Second, by eating the foods in a particularsequence that mimics the order in which the body actually digests them, you canfurther minimize the amount of digestive work your body has to do to accomplishthe task thoroughly. The sequence diet, then, is basically an ama-reducing diet,because ama is the residue of incomplete digestion.Ayurveda relies on several factors to determine the optimum sequence of foods,but the most important point is that heavier foods should be eaten earlier inthe meal and lighter foods toward the end.A simply analogy should make this principle clear, and it’s based on the factthat agni is described as a “digestive fire.” Imagine that you are building afire and that you’ve already put into it the quantity of wood that the fire canconsume within a reasonable period of time. Then, suddenly, someone dumps atruckload of heavy lumber on top of the fire. The fire will most likely besmothered as a result. This dumping of a truckload of wood at the end isanalogous to taking a heavy dessert at the end of a meal. When we eat until weare quite full and then proceed to add something that is sweet and difficult todigest for the final course, ama results.For this reason, I want to point out benefits of taking dessert at the beginningof a meal rather than at the end. You may find, as many children do, that eatingdessert first is actually a delightful experience. And if you still desiresomething sweet later, a piece of fruit can be taken at that time. Bear in mindthat since lunch should be the main meal of the day, it’s especially importantto follow the sequence diet at lunchtime. Even if you actually consume more foodthan usual, you will most likely be able to follow this regimen with nodiscomfort at all in your GI tract.VATA-BALANCING DIET 1. Favor foods that are warm, heavy, and oily. Minimize foods that are cold, dry, and light. 2. Favor foods that are sweet, sour, and salty. Minimize foods that are spicy, bitter, and astringent. 3. Eat larger quantities, but not more than you can digest easily.SOME SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS * Dairy. All dairy products pacify Vata. * Sweeteners. All sweeteners are good (in moderation) for pacifying Vata. * Oils. All oils reduce Vata. * Grains. Rice and wheat are very good. Reduce barley, corn, millet, buckwheat, rye, and oats. * Fruits. Favor sweet, sour, or heavy fruits, such as oranges, bananas, avocados, grapes, cherries, peaches, melons, berries, plums, pineapples, mangoes, and papayas. Reduce dry or light fruits, such as apples, pears, pomegranates, cranberries, and dried fruits. * Vegetables. Beets, cucumbers, carrots, asparagus, and sweet potatoes are good. They should be cooked, not raw. The following vegetables are acceptable in moderate quantities if they’re cooked, especially with ghee or oil and Vata-reducing spices: peas, broccoli, cauliflower, celery, zucchini, and green, leafy vegetables. It’s better to avoid sprouts and cabbage. * Spices. Cardamom, cumin, ginger, cinnamon, salt, cloves, mustard seed, and small quantities of black pepper are good. * Nuts. All nuts are good. * Beans. Reduce all beans, except tofu and split mung-bean soup. * Meat and fish (for nonvegetarians). Chicken, turkey, and seafoods are all right; beef should be avoided.PITTA-BALANCING DIET 1. Favor foods that are cool and liquid. Minimize foods that are hot in temperature. 2. Favor tastes that are sweet, bitter, or astringent. Minimize spicy, salty, or sour tastes.SOME SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS * Dairy. Milk, butter, and ghee are good for pacifying Pitta. Reduce yogurt, cheese, sour cream, and cultured buttermilk (as their sour tastes aggravate Pitta). * Sweeteners. All sweeteners are good except honey and molasses. * Oils. Olive, sunflower, and coconut oils are best. Reduce sesame, almond, and corn oil, all of which increase Pitta. * Grains. Wheat, white rice, barley, and oats are good. Reduce corn, rye, millet, and brown rice. * Fruits. Favor sweet fruits, such as grapes, cherries, melons, berries, avocados, coconuts, pomegranates, mangoes, and sweet, fully ripened oranges, pineapples, and plums. Reduce sour fruits, such as grapefruits, olives, papayas, persimmons, and sour, unripe oranges, pineapples, and plums. * Vegetables. Favor asparagus, cucumbers, potatoes, sweet potatoes, pumpkins, broccoli, cauliflower, celery, okra, lettuce, beans, green beans, zucchini, and green leafy vegetables such as lettuce. Reduce hot peppers, tomatoes, carrots, beets, onions, garlic, radishes, spinach, and mustard greens. * Beans. Reduce all beans, except tofu and split-mung dhal. * Spices. Cinnamon, coriander, cardamom, and fennel are good. But the following spices strongly increase Pitta and should be eaten only in small amounts: ginger, cumin, black pepper, fenugreek, cloves, celery seed, salt, and mustard seed. Chili peppers and cayenne should be avoided. * Meat and fish (for nonvegetarians). Chicken, pheasant, and turkey are preferable. Beef, seafood, and egg yolk increase Pitta and should be avoided.KAPHA-BALANCING DIET 1. Favor foods that are light, dry, and warm. Minimize foods that are heavy, oily, and cold. 2. Favor foods that are spicy, bitter, and astringent. Minimize foods that are sweet, salty, and sour.SOME SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS * Dairy. In general, avoid dairy products, except low-fat milk. * Fruit. Lighter fruits, such as apples and pears, are best. Reduce heavy or sour fruits, such as oranges, bananas, pineapples, figs, dates, avocados, coconuts, and melons, since these fruits increase Kapha. * Sweeteners. Honey is excellent for reducing Kapha. Reduce sugar products, as these increase Kapha. * Beans. All beans are fine except tofu, which increases Kapha. * Nuts. Reduce all nuts. * Grains. Most grains are fine, especially barley and millet. Avoid wheat and rice, as they increase Kapha. * Vegetables. All are fine, except tomatoes, cucumbers, sweet potatoes, and zucchini, as they increase Kapha. * Spices. All spices are good except salt, which should be avoided, as it increases Kapha. * Meat and fish (for nonvegetarians). White meat from chicken or turkey is fine, as is seafood. Reduce red meat."},{"pageContent":"6THE ROLE OF YOUREMOTIONSOne of the most important factors in Irritable Bowel Syndrome is therelationship between your emotions and your gut. For most people with IBS, thisrelationship is very soon made clear both by their physicians and by theirexperiences in life. There simply is no doubt that mental turmoil, toxicemotions, and the effects of stressful situations play a critical role incausing and exacerbating IBS and other lower-tract problems.But the fact that this relationship exists actually raises more questions thanit answers. How is it possible that mere feelings—of which you may not even beconsciously aware—can give rise to these very tangible and uncomfortablesensations in the body? It is indeed puzzling. Most physicians describe IBS as a“psychosomatic disease” and accompany this diagnosis with the unsettlinginformation that, although it’s not serious or life-threatening, IBS appears tobe incurable. In other words, patients are told that they must learn to livewith it.To most people, “psychosomatic” means it’s all in the head. If that’s so, whydoes it hurt so much in the belly?Answering such a question involves unraveling some of the ultimate mysteries ofhuman physiology. It requires an understanding of the integrated nature of thehuman body—of how nature has sewn us together using threads of intelligence ininfinite variety. On a less abstract level, it means identifying therelationships among neurochemicals located in the brain and throughout thephysiology, which influence every one of our thoughts, feelings, and bodilyfunctions.Let’s begin our investigation where the ancient Ayurvedic teachers startedtheirs, by asking the ultimate question about human health: Must we become sickand grow old at all?Their answer was an emphatic no!The ancient sages knew that if the forces inside us are kept in harmony and inbalance with the surrounding environment, we can become immune to illnessaltogether. This is truly the state of perfect health. But how can we create itin the everyday world?Perfect health is possible only through perfect balance. In order to prevent anydisorder, the physiology must be balanced in its nature, and in order for anydisorder to be treated, we must first correct the underlying imbalance thatcaused it. In this chapter we’ll focus on restoring balance as a solution to theunsettling feelings and toxic emotions that can cause IBS or any other boweldisease, and we’ll explore a number of approaches that can help establishharmony at the most fundamental level of life.In the West, instead of focusing on health and physiological balance we’ve beenpreoccupied with disease and dying for many centuries. This says much more aboutour particular view of life than it does about life’s essential nature. Intruth, life is immensely flexible, and the forces that cause it to endure are atleast as strong as those that cause it to decay.If you plant a pine tree on a downtown lot in a polluted city, it may live forfifty years; if you plant it in the country, its life span may increase to twoor three centuries; in another location, perhaps in the Rocky Mountains, itmight survive more than a thousand years. Which life span, then, is natural forthe pine? It depends entirely on the situation; some forces are always workingto preserve the tree’s life while others are opposing it. The tree’s ultimatedestiny—a long life or a short one—depends on the balance or imbalance amongthose forces.What’s true for trees is also true for animate creatures. If the caloric intakeand body temperature of a laboratory mouse are carefully controlled, the mouse’slife span can be extended two or even three times beyond what would otherwise bethe case. Yet a second mouse, exposed to abnormal stress, will very likely diein just a few weeks. It’s important to note that at the time of their respectivedeaths all the internal organs of both animals will have aged to the samedegree. The worn-out heart, liver, and kidneys will be uniformly “old” eventhough the first mouse lived perhaps fifty times longer than the second.As human beings, we can choose and control our environment, which gives our lifespan enormous variability. At the time of the Roman empire, adult lifeexpectancy was about twenty-eight years, while many experts estimate that by theyear 2000, life expectancy may rise to ninety years for a healthy American. Thishuge change demonstrates a great deal of societal progress as well as animpressive response to a more biologically hospitable environment.The control center for this flexibility is located in the genetic materialcontained in every one of the 50 trillion cells that make up your physiology.Actually, to speak accurately about any individual’s life span, we must refer tothe many life spans that are always taking place inside a human body. Rememberthat a typical cell in the lining of your stomach lives only a few days, atypical skin cell only two weeks, a red blood cell perhaps two or three months …while some cells in the heart and brain appear to last a lifetime without everreproducing!The amazing thing about these various life spans is that the very same geneticmaterial—DNA—controls all of them, from the very shortest to the very longest.Somehow your DNA is able to create all kinds of specialized cells, each with itsown function and life expectancy. Skin cells and brain cells, in other words,are genetically identical despite the fact that one lasts much longer than theother. You can’t even tell which cell’s life span will be long or short byexamining the cells themselves: The neurons in your brain, which last alifetime, are all but identical to the olfactory cells in your nose, yetolfactory cells are replaced every few weeks.It appears that life is so flexible and dynamic that one may legitimately askwhy we don’t survive even longer and live entirely free of disease. The answer,according to Ayurveda, is that we could do just that if we would only learn howto handle and balance the various forces that are at work in and around us. Infact, this can be accomplished simply by tapping in to our basic impulses towardgrowth and health—toward the sense of balance inherent in every cell of ourphysiology. In the West, scientists now refer to the state of optimum balance as“homeostasis.” Ayurveda identified the same balancing principle of naturethousands of years ago, but even today the relationship between health andphysiological balance remains largely unknown to most people. As a result, alltoo often the forces acting against balance and health gain the upper hand, andthe body has no choice but to give way to the ravages of disease.If we could really learn to live in balance at every level of our physiology,then our inner growth would have no foreseeable limits. The key insight, whichAyurveda emphasizes, is that such growth is intended by nature to be automatic.It’s programmed into our very cells. Experiencing it is only a question offollowing the silent river of intelligence to its source. Truly, this is thefinal secret of creating perfect health.[images/Chop_9780307558985_epub_L02_r1.jpg]How is all this related to finding a practical mind/body approach for resolvingphysical problems such as IBS? The answer resides in a deep understanding of theprinciple of balance. In order to create balance, we must simultaneously focusboth on the many localized elements of the body as well as on the organism as awhole. To clarify this point, just look at your hand. The palm is like the rootof the physiology, which binds the organism together into a whole. The fingersrepresent the localized parts, but all of the parts join together at the root toconstitute one holistic organism. Our bodies are exactly like this, comprised ofan infinite variety of aspects, all bound together by the source ofintelligence. Because the fingers of your hand are all joined to the palm, asensation experienced by any one of them will influence the hand as a whole, buta more fundamental sensation would occur at the level of the palm itself, whichis the “root” of the whole hand. The dual principles are actually very simple.We balance the whole body by balancing the parts—and we balance the parts bystabilizing the body at the most fundamental level.Since balance is the key, here are some practical steps you can take to createthis balance from the most basic levels of your existence.Begin with a process known in Ayurveda as “self-referral.” This simply meansthat you look inward, inside yourself, in order to influence your next behavioror action. In our society, self-referral is very uncommon. One generallyencounters “object-referral” instead, in which an individual relies on externalcues to determine behavior. To free ourselves from object referral and tostructure self-referral activity, we must begin by placing our attention on ourinternal cues. These are literally messages and signals provided by yourphysiology to move you in the direction of creating perfect health.Nature has really provided us only two types of signals—a sense of comfort and asense of discomfort—and either of these can be physical, emotional, orpsychological. When you are feeling perfect in every respect, your behavior isthat of self-referral. It is directed toward honoring the internal cues providedby the physiology. This behavior will produce not only success on the materiallevel but balance from the deepest level of being.When you experience emotions such as fear, anxiety, unhappiness, or anger, tryto understand that these cues are indications that you’ve come “out of yourself”and are behaving according to object referral. This should not be confused withthe sudden adrenaline surge that has come to be known as the “fight-or-flight”response. Fight-or-flight, at least under certain dire circumstances, can servea genuine survival imperative. Object-referral behavior, however, derives fromfrustration and misplaced emotional discomfort. Behavior of this sort will notonly fail to be successful on the material level, it can also create damageanywhere and everywhere in the physiology.Obviously, everyone experiences negative emotions on a regular basis, but muchcan be done to free you from the grip of these sensations and to return you toyour true self. The first step is an awareness of the fact that every emotionincludes both a thought and a physical sensation. Every emotion, no matter howweak or strong, has these two components because every impulse at the level ofthe mind has a simultaneous impulse in the physiology.When you feel overwhelmed by any feeling, try turning your attention to theemotion’s physical component. When you feel upset, pause for a moment and allowyour attention to settle on the sensations occurring in your body. If you closeyour eyes for a few seconds, your mind will immediately be attracted to someparticular area of the physiology, perhaps your stomach or your heart. Justallow the attention to remain on that area for perhaps half a minute. Graduallyyou’ll discover that the physical sensation begins to moderate. When you openyour eyes, you’ll find that the emotional component has also diminished.The most powerful approach for dealing with negative emotions is to structure alevel of awareness that is self-referral at all times, so that the perfectlycorrect response becomes a spontaneous and automatic part of the mind/bodysystem. Even if negative emotions arise because of stressful situations in yourlife, you can become like a silent witness to them, with a firm balanceremaining deep inside.Meditation is one of the best ways to accomplish this, as has been confirmed bycontemporary studies in America as well as by the accumulated experience of manygenerations in other parts of the world. Meditation can take many forms. Someinvolve the use of mantras—that is, sounds that are repeated silently or aloudin order to bring the mind to a new state of awareness. These sounds are notwords in the usual sense; they do not refer to anything in the physical world,for example, in the way that the word dog refers to a four-legged animal. Butmantras can have a powerful spiritual impact. They resonate very deeply in themind at a basic level where sound itself can have meaning that is separate fromlanguage. Mantras can best be described as primordial, meaning “foundation” or“original.”We give instruction in primordial sound meditation at the Center for Mind/BodyMedicine in California, but it is by no means the only meditative form that canbe of benefit. The Breathing Meditation technique introduced here is very simplebut can be extremely effective in freeing both body and mind from the effects ofnegative emotions.Breathing Meditation 1. Set aside some time when you’re free from work or family responsibilities. Find a quiet place where you will not be disturbed. 2. Sit quietly on the floor or in a straight-backed chair. Close your eyes. 3. Begin by simply exhaling and inhaling as you normally do, but gradually focus your awareness on the process of your breathing. But don’t try to control or influence it in any way. Just be aware of the coming and going of your breath. 4. If you notice your breath speeding up or slowing down—even stopping for a moment—simply observe this. Don’t try to resist it or encourage it; rather, allow it to pass. 5. Similarly, if your attention wanders or you become distracted in any way, don’t resist. Just allow your attention to gradually and naturally return to your breathing. 6. Continue the Breathing Meditation technique for fifteen minutes. Allow yourself another few minutes for withdrawal from the technique, still sitting with your eyes closed. Then open your eyes and resume your normal activities.A certain level of commitment is required in order to gain the benefits ofmeditation, but the results will more than justify the time and self-disciplinerequired. I urge you to practice Breathing Meditation for twenty or thirtyminutes in the morning and in the evening. Morning meditation should take placebefore breakfast, although if you’re very hungry it may be best to eat somethingin order to prevent distraction. Evening meditation should be performed afteryou’ve had a chance to wind down from work but before the evening meal. As yousettle in to this routine, the experience of restful alertness that is theessence of meditation will begin to have positive effects on your stress leveland on your general state of mind throughout the day; this in turn willalleviate many emotionally based gastrointestinal symptoms. Indeed, you willgain access to resources of self-referral that can be of enormous benefit inevery area of your life.[images/Chop_9780307558985_epub_L02_r1.jpg]There are several other factors you should be aware of in order to keep youremotions in balance. Ayurveda identifies a type of behavior that is destructiveto self-referral living, and to the intestinal tract in particular. This can bedescribed as “stressed activity hurriedly done.” Unfortunately, those four wordssummarize the lives of too many individuals—moving from one thing to the next,completely object-referral, without even full awareness of living, much lessenjoyment of it.In a sense, your body is always “digesting” the environment in which you live,and this is accomplished through your senses. So, balancing the senses is animportant aspect of creating balance for the whole physiology. Ayurvedic musictherapy, called gandhama veda, can help achieve this. Gandhama veda uses melodicsequences of sound to create balance in the individual mind and body as well asin the surrounding environment. There’s no doubt that sound has an extremelypowerful effect on any physiology. Research has shown, for example, that plantsgrow better when exposed to beautiful music and don’t grow as well whensubjected to loud, jarring sounds. Listening to music before bed or duringstressful moments during the day can help to reset the senses into theself-referral mode. Information on sources for gandhama veda recordings can befound at the back of this book.Ayurveda also recommends utilizing the sense of smell to create balance. Each ofthe five senses is actually formed by a different vibration in the quantummechanical body, and each of these vibrations, or “languages,” has a particulareffect on the doshas. The language of aromas is quite complex. The human nosecan identify as many as ten thousand different odors, and olfactory cellslocated on the membranes inside the nose pass straight to the hypothalamus,which is located in the brain. These olfactory cells are actually nerves—theonly ones in the whole body that are exposed to air—and they’re protected onlyby their thin covering of mucus. They are also the only nerves that regenerate,replacing themselves about once every three weeks.The fact that smells go straight to the hypothalamus is very significant, forthis tiny area of the brain is responsible for regulating dozens of bodilyfunctions, including temperature, thirst, blood-sugar levels, growth, sleeping,waking, emotions, and digestion. To smell anything is to send an immediatemessage to the hypothalamus, hence to the whole body.Specific aromas can be used to balance the three doshas. Aromas such as basil,orange, and clove influence Vata; Pitta is balanced more by sweet, cool aromaslike sandalwood, rose, mint, and cinnamon. Special blends of aromas can bedesigned to benefit individual needs. Again, information regarding sources ofAyurvedic materials is available at the end of this book.There are many other factors in your daily life that you must consider in orderto reduce stress and balance your emotions. Are you trying to juggle too manyresponsibilities? Are you working too many hours? Do you bring home theanxieties of your job at night? In order to relieve any of these stresses, youmust begin paying attention to your internal cues. The goal is certainly worthachieving: not only years added to your life, but full enjoyment of those yearsin whatever way you choose to define it. Regardless of whether you truly want towork twelve hours a day, or would deeply appreciate more time with your family,or would simply like to go off by yourself for a period of time, the first stepis to “know thyself.” The reward is perfect health through perfect balance inevery facet of your life."},{"pageContent":"7BIOLOGICAL RHYTHMS:RIDING NATURE’S WAVESThe continuity of the body and the universe is one of the most basic principlesof Ayurveda. Each rhythm and cycle of nature is understood to have acorresponding cycle in the human physiology. Collectively, these cycles arereferred to as our “biological rhythms.” There is a beautiful Ayurvedic aphorismthat describes this relationship:As is the atom, so is the universe; as is the microcosm, so is the macrocosm; asis the human body, so is the cosmic body; as is the human mind, so is the cosmicmind.In order to correct any imbalance in the body, it’s essential to realize thatour internal biological rhythms are dependent on and must be in harmony with the“external” rhythms in nature. Actually, these internal and external rhythms arejust two expressions of the same natural cycles.Every day the sun rises, the sun sets, and billions of different things happenin between. Nature is so beautifully arranged that no matter how different thesethings are, they are part of a single unifying rhythm—although, speaking moreprecisely, there are really rhythms nestled inside one another, like wheelswithin wheels. Modern medicine has disclosed many of the obvious cycles in ourbody: the heart beating every three-quarters of a second, the lungs swelling toinhale air ten to fourteen times a minute. But many of the body’s changes remainmysterious. Why does a person typically weigh more in the evening? Why are ourhands hottest at around two in the morning? Why is it that certain medicaltreatments may be more beneficial if given at specific times of day?Ayurveda’s answer is that each of us has master cycles governed by the quantummechanical body and that the body is constantly trying to synchronize itsrhythms with those of nature. Every day we pass through the various cycles, andwe feel their influence through alterations in the function of Vata, Pitta, andKapha. Ayurveda defines three phases of cycles that take place from sunrise tosunset and then repeat themselves between sunset and sunrise. The approximatetimes are as follows: * From 6:00 to 10:00 (A.M. or P.M.) an influence of Kapha is predominant in the environment. * From 10:00 to 2:00 (A.M. or P.M.) an influence of Pitta is predominant. * From 2:00 to 6:00 (A.M. or P.M.) Vata is predominant.One of the most basic aspects of living in tune with nature is to know andrespect these master cycles that support our physical existence. We are meant toride nature’s waves, not to fight against them. In fact, our bodies are alreadyriding them, or at least doing the best they can in the face of our contraryhabits.In the wild, animals instinctively follow natural signals. But nature has givenhuman beings a unique ability to choose the times and places of our actions.Whenever we make these choices, we are at the very same moment receiving signalsfrom our quantum mechanical body, and these signals tell whether we are inharmony with the rhythms of nature. As we’ve discussed, these signals appear inonly two forms: comfort or discomfort. When we experience any degree ofdiscomfort in the intestinal tract, or anywhere else in the body, it’s a suresign that we are fighting against nature’s waves rather than riding them.I’m sure you can think of many different rhythms in nature. For our purposeshere, the twenty-four-hour cycle of day and night is most important. This cyclehas a corresponding rhythm in the body, which scientists call the “circadianrhythm.” While the most obvious expression of the circadian rhythm is thesleep/wakeful cycle, many other neurological and endocrine functions follow atwenty-four-hour cycle as well, including temperature fluctuations, hormone andenzyme production, and electrolyte excretion. The processes of digestion andelimination are also part of this twenty-four-hour tempo.Animals in the wild exhibit cycles of hunger and elimination that for the mostpart are consistent within a given species. These patterns repeat themselves dayafter day. Although humans eat at many different times and manifest widevariation in other natural functions as well, Ayurveda teaches that there areideal times when these activities can be undertaken in a natural and beneficialway.The chart at the end of this chapter sets forth an ideal Ayurvedic dailyroutine. Each aspect of the routine is designed to help synchronize yourbiological rhythms with the rhythms of nature. Throughout the balance of thischapter, we want to choose some of the most important points of that dailyroutine that can help put your entire physiology in harmony with nature, whileat the same time strengthening digestion and eradicating intestinal problems.The morning is a special time in Ayurveda. This is the time when nature sendsout its most delicate messages; it’s also the time when you are most sensitiveto these signals. Your nervous system has been constructed so that the sight ofthe dawn, the feel of still air on your skin, the sounds of birds and animalsawakening, all set the stage for your full and active participation in lifeduring the coming day.The best time for arising, therefore, is an important consideration. Inreviewing the master cycles of the day, you’ll notice that 6:00 A.M. is apivotal point. This is the junction between the Vata and Kapha periods of themorning. It’s the growing influence of Vata during the early morning hours, infact, that causes the birds and other animals to begin to awaken, because Vatais an active dosha, providing alertness, energy, and preparation for activity.For this reason, Ayurveda recommends arising at or even before this pivotal timeof 6:00 A.M. By doing so, the mind and body will be under maximum influence ofVata, so you’ll awaken feeling light, lively, and energetic.From 6:00 to 10:00 A.M., however, the qualities of Kapha begin to become moreevident in the environment. Some qualities of Kapha are heaviness, dullness, andslowness. So if you sleep until the middle of the Kapha period—around 8:00A.M.—your mind and body will be primarily under Kapha influence as you awaken.This is one of the reasons why many people wake up feeling dull and groggy,needing many hours and sometimes several cups of coffee before they feel alertenough to face the day. Yet, just by arising early, you can become more alertand feel more in harmony with nature.There is another important benefit of arising while the influence of Vata isstill strong. Remember that it’s Vata which is primarily responsible for thefunctions involved in having a bowel movement. For this reason, Ayurveda saysthat the ideal time for a bowel movement is in the early morning, soon afterarising, while the influence of Vata is still lively. It will be easier tocreate a habit of having a regular bowel movement at this time of day than itwill at any other time. It will also be more in accord with the natural rhythmsof the body.Conventional medical wisdom states that having as few as two bowel movements aweek is still within normal range. According to Ayurveda, however, one shouldideally have at least one bowel movement each day in order to eliminate wasteproducts and toxins from the day before. If this is not currently yoursituation, there’s no need to worry, for the body is tremendously flexible inits ability to tolerate variations from the ideal routine. But it’s wise tobegin structuring a routine that will encourage this natural habit.Drinking a glass of warm water soon after rising can gently encourage a morningbowel movement. Warm water activates the gastrocolic reflex, which simply meansstimulating the bowel by placing something warm in the stomach. After drinkingwarm water, allow yourself five minutes or more in the bathroom to determine ifyour body is ready. Just sit comfortably with your awareness settled and seewhat happens. If after a few minutes nothing does, don’t worry, and definitelydon’t strain. With time, many people find that this practice creates a habit ofregular morning elimination. Once you form this habit, it will be easy to keepit for the rest of your life. Even if you are regular in your bowel movements atanother time of day, try this routine for a few weeks and see whether your bodynaturally begins to shift to it.It’s best not to read while sitting on the toilet. Without becoming tootechnical, this is because reading involves subdoshas of Vata that govern mentalfunctions, which are also responsible for Vata’s upward flow. Since the subdoshaApana is responsible for the downward flow, mixing these two activities willconfuse the physiology and create strain on Apana.After the bowel movement, Ayurveda recommends a sesame oil massage as part ofthe daily routine. Most people find this one of the most enjoyable activities oftheir day. Requiring only a few minutes, the morning massage works by soothingthe body’s two master systems, the central nervous system and the endocrinesystem. Perhaps it’s for this reason that Cherak, one of the original authors ofAyurveda, lavished praise on the practice of daily oil massage known asabhyanga. Cherak taught that abhyanga rejuvenates the skin, tones the muscles,eliminates impurities, and promotes youthfulness.Abhyanga is also a good technique for beginning the day in a relaxed manner,both physically and mentally, which Ayurveda considers extremely important.Remember that people who view the day as a race against time hardly have theideal approach for achieving perfect balance.Instructions for performing the daily massage are provided on pages 76–77.During the massage, I advise that you spend a few extra minutes gently massagingyour abdomen with the warm oil. If you follow this with a warm bath, both youand your bowel will be much less irritable throughout the entire day.You should take your heaviest meal at lunchtime; this is an extremely importantAyurvedic recommendation. Moreover, you should try to take lunch atapproximately the same hour each day. The best time is in the middle of thePitta period, about noon or 12:30 P.M. The reason for this is quitestraightforward. Since every cycle in the body has a corresponding cycle innature, this is also true of Pitta, which is primarily responsible for agni, thedigestive fire. The presence of Pitta in the body corresponds to the influenceof the sun in nature. That’s why the midpoint of the Pitta cycle is around noon,when the sun is also at its peak. It’s also at this time that the digestivefires are most prepared to process food. In most cultures in the world, lunchhas traditionally been the main meal of the day. It’s really only since nationshave become industrialized, with people bending their basic biological routinesaround their work, that heavy dinners have become popular.You can think of the sun as a kind of support for the processes of digestion.When the sun is high in the sky there will be greater assistance for thedigestive processes in the body, because the sun’s energy will be synchronizedwith the physiological influence of Pitta. But when the sun is rising in themorning and setting in the evening, digestive capacity is weakened, becausethere is less support from the environment for the Pitta in the body.AYURVEDIC OIL MASSAGEHOW TO DO AYURVEDIC OIL MASSAGE 1. Start with cold-pressed sesame oil, available from your health food store. Ideally, the oil should be cured (purified) before using. (Instructions for curing are given below.) The oil should be warmed each day before you use it. One easy way to do this is to keep the oil in a small plastic bottle with a flip-top lid. Warm the oil by placing the bottle in a sink or container filled with hot water for a few minutes. 2. Use the open part of your hand, rather than your fingertips, to massage your entire body. In general, use circular motions over rounded areas (joints, head) and straight strokes over straight areas (neck, long bones). Apply moderate pressure over most of your body and light pressure over your abdomen and heart. 3. Start with your head. Pour a small amount of oil on your hands and vigorously massage it into your scalp. With the flat part of your hands, use circular strokes to cover your whole head. Spend more time massaging your head than other parts of your body. 4. Next, massage your face and outer ears, remembering to apply a small amount of oil as you move from one part of your body to the next. Massage this area more gently. 5. Massage the front and back of your neck and the upper part of your spine. At this point you may want to cover the rest of your body with a thin layer of oil to give maximum time for the oil to soak in. 6. Vigorously massage your arms, using a circular motion on your shoulders and elbows and long, back-and-forth strokes on your upper arms and forearms. 7. Now massage your chest and stomach. Use a very gentle, circular motion over your heart and abdomen. You can start in the lower right part of your abdomen and move clockwise toward the lower left part, to gently massage your intestines. 8. Massage your back and spine. You may have trouble reaching your entire back. Just do the best you can. 9. Massage your legs vigorously, using circular motions over your hips, knees, and ankles. Use long, straight strokes over your thighs and calves. 10. Finally, massage the bottoms of your feet. As with your head, this important area of your body deserves more time. Use the palm of your hand to massage your soles vigorously. 11. Follow your oil massage with a warm bath or shower, using a mild soap.HOW TO PREPARE SESAME OIL FOR AYURVEDIC OIL MASSAGEAyurveda recommends using unprocessed, cold-pressed sesame oil, which isavailable at health food stores. Before using the sesame oil, it’s best to cureit by following these simple steps. Curing increases the oil’s ability topenetrate the skin. 1. Heat the oil to about the boiling temperature of water (212°F). To know when the oil is hot enough, simply add a single drop of water to the oil before you heat it. When the water crackles or boils on top of the oil, you can remove it from the heat. Or just observe the oil as it heats. When it begins to move and circulate in the pan, remove it from the burner. 2. If you like, you can cure up to one quart of oil at a time. This should be enough for at least two weeks. 3. Caution: Because all oils are flammable, be sure to observe proper safety precautions. Use low rather than high heat, never leave the room while the oil is heating, and remove it promptly once the proper temperature is reached. Be sure to store it in a safe place when cooling, out of the reach of children.By eating your lunch between noon and 12:30 P.M., you can take in even largequantities of food and still digest it properly. This will preclude the need totake a large meal near bedtime, which would be more difficult to digest.This one simple recommendation can make a dramatic difference in your metabolismand elimination. Because digestion is stronger in the middle of the day, foodwill be more efficiently converted into energy, and your body will ultimately bemore comfortable during the later stages of digestion.Lunch should be taken in a settled environment, and every effort should be madeto ensure that it’s wholesome, nutritious, balanced, and tasty. The meal shouldbe freshly cooked and taken in accord with all the principles you are learningin this book. Of course, I realize that eating a substantial lunch may bedifficult for people who must cope with demanding work schedules. A healthylunch may not be as convenient as a quick sandwich followed eventually by aheavy dinner. But a little creativity in this area definitely provides immensebenefits in resolving all intestinal complaints. If you think it’s impossible toarrange a good lunch each day, do your best with it for a couple of weeks andthen decide whether it’s worth continuing. I’m confident you’ll notice benefitsthat extend well beyond the digestive tract.Ayurveda also has recommendations for breakfast and dinner.In the morning, when the sun is rising, there is less support from theenvironment for digesting heavy foods. Therefore, breakfast is an optional mealand does not even need to be taken. In any case, breakfast should be a lightmeal, such as milk and cereal, or herbal tea and toast.The most important principle is to avoid producing any discomfort in the body.Individuals who have stronger appetites, especially those who have Pittaconstitutions, may require more food for breakfast than do the other types.Kapha types, on the other hand, may find that they can easily skip breakfast andstill feel very comfortable waiting for lunch. If you are currently in the habitof eating a heavy breakfast, I recommend that you try switching to a lighterone, which will provide you with more appetite at lunchtime.At dinnertime, as the sun is setting, there is less digestive power than in themiddle of the day, but more is present than at breakfast. For this reason,dinner should be taken on a regular basis, but it should be lighter than theluncheon meal. If you’ve been taking a balanced and solid lunch, you just won’tbe very hungry at dinner. If you eat only a sandwich or a light salad for lunch,you’ll still be hungry later, and a heavy dinner followed within a few hours bysleep will strain your digestive tract and produce ama.Your food at dinner should not be heavy, so take meats and cheeses sparingly andin general eat less than at lunch. Some examples of dinners that you may findvery satisfying, perhaps to your surprise, are hot soup and bread, hot cereals,and assorted vegetables.A final important point about the daily routine concerns bedtime. A tired bodyis not alert to its inner needs and is consequently more vulnerable to stressand imbalance. You may have noticed that when you allow yourself to becomefatigued, you’re more likely to react by internalizing stress in the form ofgastrointestinal symptoms. We’ve already recognized the importance of risingearly in the morning as a way of feeling fresh and alert all day, and as an aidin establishing a regular morning-elimination pattern. It follows that if youstart to get up earlier but continue to go to bed at the same time, you arelikely to be tired all day.Another pivotal junction in the twenty-four-hour cycle occurs at 10:00 P.M. Thisis the meeting point between the Kapha and Pitta periods of the evening. Theinfluence of Kapha during these hours is very evident. In the evening, afterwe’ve completed our work and the sun is setting, it seems like the wholeenvironment is quieter, as if all of nature is settling down. Most peopleinstinctively feel like sitting back and relaxing. Of course, if you live in alarge metropolitan area you may wonder where this natural silence may be as youlook out on the frantic activity of an urban night. But this is not theinfluence of nature itself; rather, it is an aspect of our modern lifestyle,which often brings us into conflict with nature’s intention.Observing nature, we find deepening silence and calm throughout the environmentas night falls. If we allow it in, this settling effect will be reflected in ourbodies, which by the end of the Kapha period, at 9:00 or 10:00, will begin toprepare for sleep. Remember that the qualities of Kapha are heaviness, dullness,and slowness—ideal qualities for bringing rest.If you don’t go to bed by 10:00 P.M., the environmental influence of Pittabegins to grow. Remember that Pitta is an active dosha whose qualities arelightness, sharpness, and heat. Most people find that staying up until 10:30 orlater brings a new rush of alertness, which can remain strong late into thenight. But what has really happened? By removing sleep from synchrony with therhythms of nature, the sleep we eventually do experience will be shallow andrestless. For those with sleep problems, sleep will be more difficult to come byduring these later hours. So Ayurveda recommends taking adequate rest andchoosing the hours of sleep for maximum accord with nature. Bedtime should be asclose to 10:00 P.M. as possible, and then it will be natural and effortless toarise earlier in the morning.Bringing your biological rhythms into accord with nature is an important part ofestablishing overall balance in your general physiology, which will then be ableto produce these same balancing effects in the gastrointestinal tract.AYURVEDIC DAILY ROUTINEAccording to Ayurveda, an ideal day naturally structures itself into four timeperiods, as indicated below.6:00 A.M. TO NOON * Wake up not long after 6:00 a.m. Gradually train yourself to do so without an alarm clock. * Drink a glass of warm water to stimulate the GI system and to encourage a bowel movement. * Urinate and have an unforced bowel movement. * Brush your teeth, including your tongue if it is coated. * Perform sesame oil massage. * Perform breathing meditation. * Bathe or shower using warm water, not hot or cold. * Exercise (see chapter 8 [Chop_9780307558985_epub_c08_r1.htm]). * Eat a light breakfast. * Try to take a 30-minute midmorning walk.NOON TO 6 P.M. * Eat an early lunch; this should be the largest meal of the day; avoid rushing or eating at your desk. * Take a few moments to sit quietly after eating, then walk for 5 to 15 minutes to aid digestion. * Perform breathing meditation in late afternoon or early evening.6:00 P.M. TO 10:30 P.M. * Eat a moderate dinner. * Sit quietly for a few moments after eating, then walk for 5 to 15 minutes to aid digestion. * Engage in light, stress-free activities during the evening. * Bedtime at least three hours after dinner, but not later than 10:00 p.m. Don’t read, eat, or watch television in bed.10:00 P.M. TO 6:00 A.M. * Sleep."},{"pageContent":"8UNDERSTANDING EXERCISEFrom an Ayurvedic standpoint, many of today’s exercise techniques are very farfrom ideal. To understand why, let’s begin with the purpose of exercise intraditional Indian medicine. Cherak, the great Ayurvedic physician, wrote:By physical exercise one gets lightness, capacityto work, firmness, tolerance of difficulties,diminution of physical impurities, and strengtheningof digestion and metabolism.Cherak went on to say that exercise is suitable for everyone, but that too muchcan be as damaging as too little. Also, since the proper amount and type ofexercise varies from person to person, any activity should be properly suited tothe individual.The most important principle of exercise is that it should enhance rather thandiminish energy, strength, and vitality. No matter which program of activity youare following, you should feel lively, strong, and energetic both during theexercise and afterward. If you feel exhausted and strained at any point,something is wrong with your particular exercise routine.Regarding exercise, the three common mistakes people make are these: 1. Performing too little exercise or none at all 2. Performing exercises that don’t suit them 3. OverexercisingExercise can have many benefits related to IBS. In addition to reducing stress,healthy activity has a massaging effect on the colon, which soothes intestinalproblems. But excessive, extremely demanding exercise can increase Vata andactually make an irritable bowel worse. This is especially true for Vata andPitta types. Pittas enjoy competition and may choose exercise that is highlycompetitive in nature. Ideally, exercise should provide relaxation for the Pittatype, who tends to be highly driven, rather than serve as one more opportunityto make intense demands on the body.As you might expect, physical training is an important means of communicatingwith your doshas, but each of the body types responds differently to exercise.Kapha types, who tend to have more muscular physiques and greater stamina, needregular exercise in order to feel lively and energetic, and they tolerate morevigorous exercise than either the Vatas or Pittas. Vata types tend to havesmaller builds and are best suited to milder activities. Pitta falls betweenVata and Kapha.If you are a two-dosha type, let your physique be your guide in determiningwhich exercise is best for you. If you are a Kapha-Vata type, for example, andhave the typical muscular, athletic Kapha physique, then the Kapha category ofexercise should be most suitable. Another Kapha-Vata type, however, may have themore modest physical build of a Vata and will respond better to therecommendations for that dosha. Here are some exercises that are best suited toeach of the body types:Vata: dance aerobics, walking, short hikes, light bicyclingPitta: skiing, walking or running, hiking, mountain climbing,swimmingKapha: running, walking, weight training, aerobics, rowing,dancingYou shouldn’t feel restricted to the activities on the list above. The bestcriterion for judging any exercise is whether you enjoy it. Find the activitythat makes you feel good.Walking is an exercise that suits all three doshas, and it’s an ideal part ofyour treatment program for intestinal problems. Vary the speed and intensity ofyour walking according to your individual needs. A Kapha type may find thatquick, aerobic-type walking feels best, while the Vata type will prefer more ofa continuous stroll. An ideal addition to your daily routine would be at leastthirty minutes of walking in the morning. Within a week or two, you’ll begin tonotice the benefits.Ayurveda offers some other specific guidelines regarding exercise: In general,utilize about 50 percent of your capacity. If you can swim twenty laps, do onlyten; if you can bicycle twenty miles, bicycle half that. Your capacityrepresents the total amount of energy available at a given time, beyond whichyou’re completely tired and can’t go any farther. The purpose of exercise is notto drain all your energy but to produce more of it. For this reason, never workout to your full capacity; stop while you still feel energetic and comfortableboth mentally and physically. Of course, the principle of utilizing 50 percentof your capacity does not ignore the benefits of physical conditioning. As timegoes on and your total capacity grows, 50 percent of that capacity will also beincreasing.Ayurveda recommends regular daily exercise, preferably seven days a week. Thereason many aerobics programs recommend only three or four days of exercise perweek is that they demand all the available energy of the physiology. This makesa recuperation period of several days necessary. The Ayurvedic principle is not“no pain, no gain” but “no strain produces maximum gain.”Your breathing and perspiration are good indicators of your response toexercise. Heavy breathing and a great deal of perspiration mean you’re strainingyour body. Perhaps with more conditioning this level of exercise will suit you,but for now it’s better to cut back.The best time of day to exercise is during the Kapha periods, especially between6:00 and 10:00 A.M. This is when the structure of the physiology is strongestand most tolerant of activity. And remember always to exercise on an empty ornearly empty stomach.So far we’ve been discussing conventional types of exercises with which mostpeople in the West are familiar. Ayurveda, however, includes a broad range ofexercise that comes to us from the yoga tradition. We refer to these exercisesas “neuromuscular integration,” because they benefit not only the muscular,cardiovascular, and metabolic systems but also serve to integrate mind and bodyin order to create specific and predictable physiological effects.How is it possible for physical exercise to integrate mind and body? To fullygrasp this, you need to understand the Ayurvedic view of your physical self.Imagine that you’re an architect designing a new skyscraper. As part of thatdesign, there will be certain junction points that bear more of the stress orweight of the structure than other points. Proper design of these points will becrucial to ensuring the stability of the building. In the same way, your bodyhas certain junction points that Ayurveda refers to as marmas. These areextremely vital areas. If they are damaged, they can cause excruciating pain orsevere imbalance. But if well balanced and enlivened, they can support healthand bliss.Marmas are described in Ayurveda as the meeting places of consciousness andphysiology. Because of this, influencing a marma automatically influences manyother parts of the mind/body system which have arisen from that junction point.There are 107 marmas. Of these, three are the most basic, serving as centralswitching points that connect together all of the others. These extremely vitalmarmas are called mahamarmas, or “great marmas.” Their names are shiramarma,hridayamarma, and bastimarma—and they are located in the head, the heart, andthe lower abdominal region, in that order. Shiramarma, the mahamarma located inthe head, plays a critical role in all mental functions, especially thoseinvolving understanding and discrimination. Hridayamarma, located in the heart,is important for maintaining the balance of the emotions. The heart, accordingto Ayurveda, is not only an organ to maintain circulation. As the poets havetold us for thousands of years, it’s also the center of all of our most intimatefeelings.Our focus in this book, of course, is on the third mahamarma. Bastimarma isresponsible for many of the body’s basic physical processes, including thenormal functioning of the gastrointestinal tract.Many of the recommendations made earlier act principally through the marmas. Forexample, the benefits of abhyanga, the daily oil massage, are achieved through agentle stimulation of all the marmas on the skin. The skin’s contact with thesesame oil has an immediate effect on the entire nervous system and a powerfulsalutary effect on Vata, Pitta, and Kapha.The exercises described at the end of this chapter are derived from the yogatradition. They provide a gentle, balancing, stimulating effect on the marmas,an effect caused by the stretching motion inherent in the yoga postures, as wellas by focusing attention on the junction points of your physiology. Because themarmas are the meeting places of consciousness and physiology, they respond toawareness as well as to physical activity.While you’re doing these exercises, be aware that the intention is to produce agentle effect on the marmas, not to create any sort of strain. Never exertyourself to the point of discomfort. Also, because attention is important inenlivening the marmas influenced by a particular posture, you will get the besteffects from doing these exercises in a quiet place and from allowing yourawareness to be innocently drawn to the vital points on your body.I recommend making these exercises a part of your regular routine. They requireonly fifteen or twenty minutes per day, and the postures I’ve chosen are simpleones—but they do have powerful benefits for gastrointestinal health.[images/Chop_9780307558985_epub_015_r1.jpg]THE YOGIC SEALYOGA MUDRASit in a comfortable, cross-legged position on the floor. Move your hands behindyour back and take your right wrist in your left hand. Now bend slowly forward,as if to press your chest against the floor. If you can, touch the floor withyour forehead and then with your chin. But don’t force; just bend as far as youcomfortably are able, and take care to breathe normally throughout the exercise.Try to time your breathing so that you exhale as you bend forward, and theninhale as you slowly come back up.Repeat three to seven times, holding the forward position for ten seconds duringeach repetition. As you progress, try to reduce the number of repetitions whileincreasing the duration of the forward bend, to a maximum of two minutes.This pose is quite easy and is excellent for toning the digestive organs andrelieving constipation.STOMACH LIFTUDDHIYANA BANDHAWith your feet slightly more than shoulder width apart, bend forward and placeyour hands on your knees. Now contract your stomach muscles, drawing them in toform a hollow as you exhale, completely emptying your lungs. Do not inhale whilemaintaining the contraction of your stomach muscles, but be careful not to gobeyond the point of discomfort. Then relax your muscles and inhale slowly.Repeat this exercise three to seven times. Your stomach muscles should remaincontracted for five to thirty seconds with each repetition.This exercise benefits constipation and indigestion. If properly executed, itrequires little effort and can be used by anyone.[images/Chop_9780307558985_epub_016_r1.jpg]PELVIC POSEVAJRASANAKneel with your knees together.

In this chapter we’ll look at three of these commonproblems—constipation, diarrhea, and gas—which at the very least are unpleasant,and which can sometimes be precursors of a more serious imbalance.While we can discuss these conditions separately, please bear in mind that froman Ayurvedic standpoint they are all variations on a single theme. They allarise from disturbances in the various doshas and subdoshas that governdigestion and elimination. Different intensities and qualities of thesedisturbances will produce variations of symptoms, but many of the treatmentswill be the same.CONSTIPATIONConstipation can occur for a number of reasons. Some of these are very simple,such as insufficient fluid intake or inadequate exercise. Long stays in bed aredefinitely bad for regular bowel habits, as are many widely prescribedantibiotics. Ask your doctor whether constipation should be anticipated as aside effect of any of your medications.These last two causes of constipation are particularly widespread among elderlypeople, for whom the problem can become something of a preoccupation. Anyphysician who treats aging patients can attest to the high degree of attentionmany of them devote to their bowel movements. Although a certain degree ofvigilance is appropriate to all our physiological functions, it is also truethat “a watched pot never boils”—and there are certainly many other things tothink about while waiting for nature to take its course. Let me mention onceagain the role medication plays in slowing the colon function of older people,many of whom take heart or high blood pressure medicines. These can causeconstipation. If the medication can be changed or withdrawn, the situation willmost likely improve.For the majority of middle-aged or younger people, Western medicine considersconstipation a dietary problem, arising from foods that lack “bulk” or“roughage.” These terms refer to material such as dietary fiber, which is ableto pass through the small intestine without being digested and is therefore ableto provide the large intestine with a stool of sufficient size to be easilymoved along by contractions of the colon’s walls. If the stool lacks bulk, itenters the colon as a small, hard object that requires extreme contractions bythe colon in order to pass through it. The patient experiences thesecontractions as painful cramps.Ayurveda teaches that a healthy human being should have a regular daily bowelmovement to eliminate waste products from the preceding day. For those withlong-standing chronic constipation, it may require some time to achieve thisgoal even after adding more fiber to the diet and following the otherrecommendations in this book. Gradually, however, the body will readjust itselfin order to correct imbalances. While this readjustment process is taking place,moderate constipation is usually not something you need to be overly concernedabout. The human digestive system is tremendously flexible, and it can toleratechronic constipation without showing any obvious damage. Indeed, Ayurvedabelieves that the presence of a stool in the large intestine has a positive,stabilizing influence on the body, because it prevents air from rising too highin the GI tract. Therefore, powerful treatments such as enemas or stronglaxatives should be undertaken only with caution. They can result in sideeffects such as insomnia, heart palpitations, and anxiety, particularly the Vatamind/body type.In most cases you should be able to resolve the problem of constipation simplyby the gradual alterations of your diet we’ve discussed. But if you’ve triedthis for some time and your constipation is still not completely resolved, thereare a number of further suggestions that apply specifically to this problem.According to Ayurveda, the underlying cause of constipation is a Vata imbalance.One of the characteristic qualities of Vata is dryness, and this often cancontribute to the creation of small, hard, dry stools. To correct this, Ayurvedarecommends making ghee a part of your daily diet. Ghee is the Sanskrit name forclarified butter, and at the end of this book you’ll find information about howto prepare it at home. You can add ghee to foods at the table or use it asreplacement for other oils when you are cooking.Be sure to follow the morning routine of drinking warm water upon rising,followed by spending some time in the bathroom. This will help you to establisha regular bowel habit. If your constipation is severe in the morning, try takinga tea-spoonful of almond oil shortly after you wake up. It is not necessary tocontinue this procedure indefinitely, but taking almond oil for one month willhelp begin to lubricate your bowel. You can also try eating a small handful ofraisins at night before bed, which will stimulate normal elimination in themorning.The best way to provide sufficient fiber in your diet is by eating freshlycooked vegetables, whole grains, and fresh fruits. However, the benefits oftaking dietary fiber will not be felt immediately; it usually takes two or threeweeks to see results. Ayurveda also mentions several specific foods for thetreatment of constipation, such as grape juice, beets, split mung beans, andprunes or prune juice. Since everyone’s system is unique, try experimenting tosee which foods are most helpful to you in producing regular elimination.A note of caution regarding fiber. Never ingest large amounts of commerciallysold fiber supplements on the theory that “more is better.” Unless fibersupplements are mixed with sufficient amounts of water, they form an inert massthat can actually make constipation worse. Be sure to drink at least severallarge glasses of water for every teaspoon of fiber supplement you ingest. Or,better, don’t rely on supplements at all; instead, adjust your diet to includewhole foods that are naturally rich in fiber.As much as possible, stay away from laxatives. It’s very easy to becomedependent on them, which only creates more difficulty in establishing a routineof natural bowel movements. If, however, you are feeling very constipated andhave not had a bowel movement for several days, an enema may be helpful. Irecommend using sixteen to twenty-four ounces of body-temperature water. As withlaxatives, frequent use of enemas is best avoided in order to establish naturalbowel function.DIARRHEAConsidered alone, diarrhea is a difficult symptom to interpret. It can indicatea serious bacterial infection or other gastrointestinal disorder, but much moreoften it originates from simple stress, a poorly prepared meal, or even frommedications taken for other problems. Diarrhea can also develop when themoisture in food, for whatever reason, is insufficiently absorbed by thedigestive system and by the small intestine in particular. This can be a seriouscondition. In some cases, the intestine may actually be secreting fluids aswell.Most of the time diarrhea is a self-limiting symptom; it goes away by itself. Ifyou’re struck by a sudden attack of diarrhea, and this is not something thatoften happens to you, avoid the temptation to take a commercially sold medicine.Instead, eat lightly or not at all for the rest of the day and lie down for awhile in order to give your system more time to absorb moisture. Bear in mindthat an acute episode of diarrhea is often your system’s way of restoringequilibrium after excessive or unhealthy intake of food. If that’s the case,there’s certainly no benefit to suppressing diarrhea. Let it do its job. Oncethe attack has passed, make sure you drink more water than usual in order toovercome the dehydration that diarrhea brings on. Exasperating as it is, thisdehydration can frequently cause an episode of constipation immediately after adiarrhea attack.Dehydration brought on by diarrhea is often seen in very young children. Someresearchers believe infant diarrhea is more common among bottle-fed breast-fedbabies, but it can be brought on by a wide variety of infections and even byteething. Whatever the cause, in young children the problem should be takenseriously. An infant under six months of age who experiences diarrhea for evenone full day should be seen by a physician, as intravenous replacement of fluidsmay be necessary. Although today this can easily be accomplished, a century agodehydration brought on by diarrhea was the leading cause of infant death in theUnited States, and it still takes the lives of many children in other parts ofthe world.If you have diarrhea that comes on suddenly and persists for more than a fewdays, you should consult a physician. And you should definitely do so if you’vealso experienced any rectal bleeding or weight loss.If you have chronic diarrhea, and you’ve been evaluated by a physician withoutany specific medical cause being discovered, I believe the diagnosis ofIrritable Bowel Syndrome should apply. If this is your situation, you canbenefit by following all the recommendations provided in this book. But becauseloose stools can be a symptom of Pitta imbalance, I especially recommend thePitta diet. Also, ingesting psyllium husks on a daily basis can help to tone thebowel. This is often useful in the treatment of both diarrhea and constipation.INTESTINAL GASWhile everyone belches or passes gas from time to time, in some individuals gascan become a troublesome, uncomfortable, and embarrassing problem. Yet gas isnormally present in the gastrointestinal tract. In fact, gas plays an importantrole in assisting the transit of matter through the intestine and colon.Basically, gas in the GI tract derives from three sources: 1. Air swallowed from the atmosphere 2. Carbon dioxide formed in the first part of the small intestine as a result of a chemical interaction between acids produced in the stomach and bicarbonate formed in the pancreas 3. The action of the more than four hundred different bacterial species that normally live in the large bowelGas derived from the first of these categories is usually released in the formof a belch, while the second and third types account for what is politely termedflatulence. Let’s consider the two problems separately.BELCHINGMost people talk while they eat, and many people chew with their mouths open;both of these activities are inevitably accompanied by swallowed air. Belchingsoon follows, but not all belches are the same. For example, there is thespontaneous belch, which simply comes and goes. The belcher hardly gives athought to his or her spontaneous belch, which often brings a feeling of mildrelief, and in some countries is even considered a compliment to the cook!However, there is also habitual belching. Here a preoccupation with belching hasdeveloped, often accompanied by a constant feeling of bloatedness that demandsrelief. However, in reality habitual belchers generally have no more air intheir stomachs than do other people; they have simply made themselves more awareof air’s presence as a way of manifesting anxiety. The best remedy to thissituation clearly lies in lowering the stress level, but the physical sensationof bloating can also be diminished by reducing the amount of swallowed air. Justeat more slowly and with less conversation.Last, but quite significant, everyone should be aware that an overwhelming urgeto belch is frequently a symptom of heart attack. If the urge to belch is feltas a strong tightening sensation in the area of the diaphragm, which may beaccompanied by pain in the arm or jaw, get help quickly.FLATULENCE AND GAS PAINSharp abdominal pain and persistent passing of wind are commonly perceived assymptoms of excessive intestinal gas. Yet, as with habitual belching, the realcause may lie elsewhere.For example, people who suffer from “gas pain,” which can be excruciating, oftenhave no more gas in their systems than does anyone else—but their bowels may beirritated and as a result may be more sensitive to even a normal volume of gas.For these individuals, the problem of gas pain is very often an aspect of thelarger problem of IBS.This has been demonstrated by research studies in which balloons have been usedto distend the colons of a group of IBS patients together with a control group.The IBS patients reported discomfort at a significantly lower level of ballooninflation than did the controls; what’s more, the IBS patients experienced painin a generalized, diffuse pattern that could include the entire abdomen and eventhe back. People with IBS just seem to be more sensitive to their “gutfeelings,” and to some degree this may account for the difficulties of treatingthe condition with conventional medications. Increased sensitivity may alsocause IBS patients to experience the side effects of drugs more intensely thando other people. Consequently, they may be inclined to depart from prescribeddosages or even to discontinue medication entirely.The problem of flatulence usually originates in the colon and is largely afunction of what you eat. If your diet contains a great deal of protein, forinstance, most of your digestion will take place in the small intestine; therewill not be much left for the colon to do. But if you eat lots of carbohydrates,such as beans or nuts, sweets, or large amounts of meat, the task of digestionfalls largely upon the many bacteria living in your large intestine. Moreover,these foods can alter the number and type of bacteria that are present. It isthe action of these bacteria that produces gasses, several of which—hydrogensulfide, for example—are foul-smelling. So if you and those around you aretroubled by your flatulence, you can probably benefit from a reduction incarbohydrates, sweets, and possibly red meat if you have been eating it in largeportions.If you’ve been taking antibiotics, you should be aware that these can also bringon intestinal gas. Food allergies are another possibility. Chapter 10[Chop_9780307558985_epub_c10_r1.htm] discusses the problem of food allergies ingreater detail.Here are some further suggestions for dealing with intestinal gas: 1. In general, follow a Vata-pacifying diet. 2. When gas is a problem, it’s especially important that meals be taken in a settled environment. Too much hurry, activity, or excited conversation will result in more swallowed air and, ultimately, more gas. Try not to speak while you are chewing or swallowing, and be sure not to eat too fast. Thoroughly chewing your food allows more saliva to accompany it to the stomach, and the saliva triggers the production of other digestive substances. 3. Avoid eating combinations of food that are likely to cause intestinal gas. Also avoid breakfasts that include citrus with starch—fresh orange juice and toast is a good example. These two food categories make contradictory demands upon your GI system and are almost certain to reach your colon in undigested form, with a predictably flatulent result. 4. Lassi, the beverage made from yogurt that was mentioned earlier, should be taken once or twice each day to help eliminate gas from the system. 5. A cup of ginger tea with honey can be taken five or ten minutes before every lunch and dinner. Aside from this, it’s a good idea to drink as little as you can with your meal (especially avoid milk); if possible, try to drink nothing at all. This is because liquids dilute and weaken the GI tract’s digestive substances. 6. End your meal by thoroughly chewing and swallowing about a quarter of a teaspoon of fennel seeds, which are very helpful in eliminating gas. 7. Last, be sure to take a few minutes of rest after each meal, before returning to your regular activities.For controlling any or all of the symptoms discussed in this chapter, Irecommend seeing a physician who has taken special training in Ayurveda. Oftenthere are specific recommendations that can be made only after an individualexamination."},{"pageContent":"10OTHER GASTROINTESTINALPROBLEMSULCERSUlcer medications such as Tagamet, Zantac, and Pepcid are among the most widelyprescribed drugs in the United States. Pharmaceutical companies have workedovertime to develop them, and they are indeed effective for many people. Ofcourse, it would be better never to have developed an ulcer in the first place,but since the precipitating causes are not always easy to isolate, preventioncan be difficult.Two types of ulcers commonly occur: gastric ulcers, which are inflammations ofthe mucus lining of the stomach that have developed into open sores; andduodenal ulcers, similar inflammations in the uppermost portion of the smallintestine, known as the duodenum.Duodenal ulcers are generally the less dangerous variety. Furthermore, theirincidence in the United States has been declining for several decades, perhapsbecause of changes in dietary habits. Most duodenal ulcers heal within a fewmonths, but once you’ve had one it’s almost certain to reappear. Stomach acid isclearly a factor in causing duodenal ulcers, since people who don’t produce itdon’t get them. But an excess of stomach acid doesn’t mean an ulcer willnecessarily appear. The critical variable seems to be the ability of theduodenum to sustain the presence of stomach acid in any amount at all.Gastric ulcers, which occur in the stomach itself, are different in severalimportant respects. They are less common, the patient is typically older, andtheir incidence has not declined in recent years. In general, gastric ulcer isthe more serious of the two varieties. The cause is again tied to stomach acid,though too much of it is not necessarily the problem, since many gastric ulcerpatients actually produce less acid than the population as a whole. Thestomach’s inability to cope with its own secretions seems basic to thiscondition.For many years, stress has been considered an important ulcer-producing factor.Acute stress can produce the “fight-or-flight” response, one aspect of which isa shutting down of the digestive processes. When this happens, acidic secretionsas well as undigested food can remain in the stomach for dangerously longperiods of time, and inflammation can result. It’s interesting to note thatulcer surgery, particularly for the duodenal variety, often includes deliberatesevering of the vagus nerve, whose functions include transmission of thefight-or-flight response from the brain to the stomach.In many cases Ayurveda diagnoses ulcers as a Pitta problem, related to heat inseveral possible manifestations. These can include emotional heat in the form ofanger or stress, biological heat in the form of excess or poorly processedstomach acid, or even dietary heat derived from heavily spiced foods. But evenif there is no imbalance of heat in any form, ulcers can still develop from aKapha-based condition in which the mucus secretions of the stomach areinsufficient to protect the tissue.Ayurvedic treatment recommends a bland diet to promote easy digestion. Irritantssuch as caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco should definitely be avoided. Despite thefact that many ulcers are associated with Pitta imbalance, and consequently withheat, cold or raw foods should not be taken. Do not skip any meals. Eat on aregular schedule in order to keep food in your system and prevent the directexposure of tissues to acidic secretions. And always do your best to avoidconflict or worry during mealtimes.INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASEInflammatory Bowel Disease sounds similar to Irritable Bowel Syndrome, whichwe’ve been discussing throughout this book. This similarity can be deceptive.IBD is a separate category of more serious gastrointestinal disorders, includingulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease, which to some extent can be consideredtogether. Although the clinical diagnosis and treatment of Inflammatory BowelDisease is beyond our scope here, it is important to devote some space to theseconditions. They affect the lives of a great many people, particularly in theUnited States and Europe.Despite much research, Western medicine has not come to a firm conclusionregarding the causes of Inflammatory Bowel Disease. There seems to be acombination of genetic and environmental factors: The conditions often reappearamong succeeding generations of certain families—especially, though notexclusively, among Jewish families—and they almost never occur among indigenouspeoples in parts of the world where a high fiber diet is still the norm. As thenumbers of such people diminish, however, the incidence of Inflammatory BowelDisease has grown. Obviously, this suggests that diet is an important factor.The highly refined, low fiber foods common in the West can leave deposits ofundigested material on the lining of the bowel, particularly of the largeintestine. Just as a wood splinter can lead to an infection on the surface ofthe skin, residues adhering to the delicate gastrointestinal membranes can giverise to the ulceration, bleeding, and other symptoms of Inflammatory BowelDisease.Without going into great detail, the distinction between the two forms of IBDrests on the fact that ulcerative colitis generally begins in the rectum, withbleeding as the most frequent symptom. The primary condition does not extendbeyond the surface of the colon, though in severe cases that entire surface maybe involved. Depending upon the point of origin and the extent to which thedisease has spread, people with ulcerative colitis may tolerate it for longperiods of time without consulting a doctor, or they may become very illquickly, with diarrhea and severe pain.Crohn’s disease involves the whole wall of the bowel rather than just thesurface. In other words, the ulcers in Crohn’s disease are deeper. It oftenappears first as pain in the lower right side of the abdomen, and it isfrequently mistaken for appendicitis. Diarrhea can occur, as in ulcerativecolitis, but this is usually not accompanied by bleeding. When bleeding ispresent, it can be alarmingly severe owing to the depth of the inflammation.This can penetrate through the colon into other organs and even the surface ofthe skin.Both ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease can be severely debilitating andeven life threatening. Conventional treatment includes powerful drugs as well assurgery, which can include removal of affected organs.Ayurveda’s understanding of IBD is characteristically insightful. It relates theproblem to the chakras, or concentrations of energy that control every aspect ofour being. Unlike our physical organs, chakras do not exist as tangible objectswithin our flesh-and-blood bodies; rather, they are part of the subtle body,which exists on a separate plane and is connected to the physical body atseveral psychic junction points. There are seven chakras, with the firstsituated at the base of the spine and the seventh located at a point about fourinches above the top of the head.Ayurveda finds the origin of IBD in the first of these focal points, which isknown as Muladhara, the “root” chakra. It is located at the base of the spine.This chakra is associated with the earth; it governs our ability to feel secureand “grounded” and to resist emotional disharmony. When problems such as Crohn’sdisease or ulcerative colitis appear, they indicate a weakening of support atthe point of the first chakra. In other words, IBD derives from the presence offear at a very basic level, and Ayurveda teaches that any successful treatmentmust take this into account. Once this fundamental problem is addressed, realgrowth and healing become possible both physically and emotionally.Once the most severe symptoms of IBD have been brought under control, Ayurvedaprescribes the herb asafoetida as particularly effective for maintaining colonichealth. Asafoetida cleanses undigested food from the system and therebyeliminates ama. It is particularly useful in breaking up toxic accumulationsthat have resulted from excessive consumption of red meat or junk foods.DIVERTICULOSISDiverticula are a form of hernia. They are outcroppings, like little pouches,that develop along the wall of the large intestine. They’re like balloons thatoccur at the weak points of a bicycle tire. “Diverticulosis” refers simply tothe presence of these pouches; when they become inflamed or infected, thecondition is known as “diverticulitis.”Like many of the gastrointestinal conditions we’ve discussed, diverticulosis ismore common in the West than in the less industrialized areas of the world. Infact, the condition was almost unknown in America until the introduction ofrefined flour and sugar late in the nineteenth century. As diet in the UnitedStates became more and more denatured, diverticulosis became increasinglycommon. Today it is estimated that more than half of all Americans haveexperienced this condition to some extent.A high fiber diet throughout your life is the best way to prevent diverticulafrom forming. The fiber gives more bulk to your stool and prevents your colonfrom having to squeeze down extremely hard in order to move the stool forward. Astraining colon is much more likely to develop diverticula than one whose jobhas been made easier by a high fiber diet.Once diverticula have formed, they don’t go away. But fiber can still minimizethe chances of their becoming inflamed or possibly rupturing. When they dobecome inflamed (diverticulitis), it’s often because a tiny piece of undigestedfood becomes lodged inside them—a condition often revealed by sudden rectalbleeding. In many cases surgery is necessary to correct the problem. The mucheasier course is to keep a healthy volume of fiber in your diet and to avoidhighly refined, constipating foods.APPENDICITISThe appendix resembles a diverticulum at the lower right end of the colon. Diethas nothing to do with its presence, however; everyone is born with an appendix.Although the appendix performs useful digestive functions in other animals, itspresence in the contemporary human anatomy is difficult to justify. Likediverticula elsewhere in the colonic wall, the appendix is vulnerable toclogging by bits of fecal matter. And since the appendix can be almost a footlong, it can even develop a kink. The infection that results is known as“appendicitis,” and if not treated the inflamed appendix can rupture, spillingbacteria into the abdominal cavity.Appendicitis usually occurs in children and young adults up to the age of 30. Itoften begins with moderate pain around the navel, which gradually moves to thelower right abdomen while at the same time becoming more severe. There may befever, but not necessarily.If you suspect you have appendicitis, it’s important to consult a doctorimmediately.HEMORRHOIDSOnce again, here is a common GI tract problem that can usually be prevented bymaintaining adequate fiber in the diet. If bulk is lacking in the stool, theresulting strain when having a bowel movement can cause enlargement of veins inthe rectum or at the anus. If the affected vein is higher up in the rectum,where no nerve endings exist, there will be no pain, but bright red blood mayappear on your toilet paper or on your stool. If the vein is lower down, paincan definitely be felt and bleeding may also accompany it. A clot may form inthe broken vein, exacerbating the pain and irritating the surrounding analtissue. Eventually these clots disappear by themselves, but meanwhile yourdiscomfort may be considerable.Hemorrhoids are easier to avoid than to cure. In addition to unhealthy diet,nervous temperaments seem more vulnerable to hemorrhoids, and many people reporttheir onset at periods of stress or intense worry. Since they can also bebrought on by poor posture and a sedentary lifestyle, exercise is important… butnot too much, since heavy lifting or the strain of extremely arduous running orclimbing can also cause hemorrhoids.Western medicine prescribes commercially sold ointments, hot baths, andsometimes surgery for hemorrhoids. Unfortunately, even an operation cannotguarantee that the problem won’t reappear. There are many, many veins in theanal area, and every one of them is a potential hemorrhoid. Ayurvedic treatmentsinclude externally applied washes made from astringent herbs such as haritakiand alum and from pomegranate, along with an avoidance of alcohol and spicyfood.If you feel a painful lump in your anus after a bowel movement, you almostcertainly have a hemorrhoid. But if you experience rectal bleeding, do notattempt to diagnose yourself. You should see a doctor regardless of whetherswelling is present.FOOD ALLERGIESAn allergy is a specific reaction produced by your body after exposure to acertain substance. More precisely, it is a misdirected response by your immunesystem. A distinction should be made between a food allergy and a foodintolerance. The symptoms of these two categories may be similar, but a foodintolerance does not include an immune system response; therefore, it usuallyappears more slowly. An intolerance to clam sauce, for instance, may occur anhour after eating or perhaps not until the next day. But a true allergy usuallypresents itself strongly and immediately.When a food allergy is present, your body mobilizes to reject the designatedfood in the same way it would reject dangerous bacteria. Your cells producedefensive toxins intended to neutralize the invader; these toxins also give riseto the sneezing, swelling, and itching that characterize allergies. If you areallergic to nuts, your immune system ferociously attacks any nuts you haveeaten. Since the nuts are just inert material, they’re unaffected, but you stillexperience the side effects of your body’s defensive reactions.Why does one person’s immune system mobilize against nuts while another person’sdoes not? There is no clear answer to this. There does seem to be a relationshipbetween allergic reactions and stress. An individual may show an allergicresponse to a food or other substance for a number of years, after which theallergy can disappear for an equally long period of time. Then it may suddenlyreappear, usually when some other form of stress is present, such as difficultyin a job or a relationship. This stress puts the immune system in a state ofheightened or even hyper-alertness, and the system produces an allergicreaction. Here the immune system is reacting like an overly sensitive mousetrap,which mistakes the slamming of a door for the presence of a mouse.Milk, wheat, and eggs are common precipitators of allergic reactions. Ayurvedahas identified other substances that cause allergies in specific doshas. Beansand corn, for instance, bring on reactions in Vata types; tomatoes, peaches, andstrawberries do so for Pittas; and dairy products for Kapha types. If thesefoods are introduced into the system too early in life (which is frequently trueof wheat or eggs), or if their introduction takes place in an atmosphere ofanger or fear, the immune system can be incorrectly programmed, and an allergymay result. There are several remedies for this, the most obvious of which is tostay away permanently from the food in question. This will work, but it’s reallyavoiding the problem rather than solving it. There are allergy shots, which workby desensitizing the immune system to certain stimuli, such as bee stings, butthese are not effective for food allergies. I believe the best course includestemporarily withdrawing the problematic food while at the same time pacifyingthe immune system with such herbs as nutmeg, cardamom, fennel, cumin, andginger.These herbs will not weaken the body’s defenses against genuine bacterialthreats, but they will moderate the hair-trigger immune responses that are thebasis of allergic reactions. The herbs will also have a generally calming effecton the emotions, which will be reflected in the mind/body system as a whole."},{"pageContent":"[images/Chop_9780307558985_epub_L01_r1.jpg]IN CLOSINGThe most important aspect of digestion is its absolutely central role inphysical and emotional well-being. You are not only what you eat, as has oftenbeen pointed out, you are what happens to what you eat while it’s inside yourbody. If what happens causes you pain or discomfort, your entire experience ofliving is diminished.Food and the act of eating should be genuinely enjoyable. This is extremelyimportant to health; it’s very likely the most important of all diet-relatedissues. But don’t let yourself be fooled about the true nature of enjoyment. Thefeeling that comes from daily overindulgence in sweet or greasy foods may becomea habit, perhaps even an addiction, but it isn’t really enjoyable—and anyone whohas developed these food dependencies will surely attest to this if they’rehonest with themselves. For one thing, eating in this way no longer includes anelement of choice; you simply know that you’re going to eat fast food or candytoday because it’s what you ate yesterday and it’s what you’re going to eattomorrow. This is not what I mean by enjoying food.In order to take real pleasure in eating, and to give yourself all the benefitsof gastrointestinal health, you must assume genuine control. Once you beginchoosing a variety of foods—ideally, all six Ayurvedic tastes should berepresented—you’ll begin to notice positive changes in every area of your life,and you’ll continue to develop a healthier diet. You’ll do this easily andnaturally, without straining. Indeed, strain itself is a major adversary ofgastrointestinal health: Straining to eat a great deal of certain foods,straining to stay away from others, strain on the part of the digestive organs,even strained bowel movements are all symptoms of digestive imbalance. Bydiscovering the real areas of strain in your diet—and in your life—and by makingmeaningful changes to eliminate them, you can achieve perfect health.There’s no reason you should settle for anything less."},{"pageContent":"[images/Chop_9780307558985_epub_L01_r1.jpg]RECIPESHOW TO PREPARE GHEEGhee is clarified butter, which means that the butter has been purified. It is avery refined food and is considered highly energizing. Ghee can be used insteadof butter on toast and other foods. It is also ideal as a cooking oil, because,unlike butter, it does not burn. Ghee can be purchased in many groceries andhealth food stores, or you can make it yourself: 1. Place one or more pounds of unsalted butter in a deep stainless steel pan on medium-low heat. Watch carefully to be sure that the butter doesn’t scorch while melting. 2. As the butter heats, its water content will begin to boil away. After thirty to forty minutes, milk solids will appear on the surface of the liquid and also at the bottom of the pan. 3. Be alert to remove the liquid ghee from the heat as the milk solids turn golden brown at the bottom of the pan. You may notice tiny bubbles rising from the bottom of the pan. Be careful that the ghee doesn’t burn. 4. While the ghee is still hot, pour it through a stainless steel strainer that has been covered with a cotton cloth. Use a stainless steel or glass bowl to catch the ghee as it pours through the strainer. Be careful not to splash any of the hot liquid on your hands. It is not necessary to refrigerate ghee, but you may do so if you prefer.HOW TO PREPARE LASSITo make four servings, place % teaspoon of cardamom, a pinch of saffron threads,and three tablespoons of hot water in a blender. Blend for ten seconds. Now addtwo cups of plain yogurt, two cups of cool water, and two tablespoons of sugar;blend until smooth. Lassi should be refrigerated until use."},{"pageContent":"[images/Chop_9780307558985_epub_L01_r1.jpg]BIBLIOGRAPHYFrawley, Dr. David, and Dr. Vasant Lad. The Yoga of Herbs.
