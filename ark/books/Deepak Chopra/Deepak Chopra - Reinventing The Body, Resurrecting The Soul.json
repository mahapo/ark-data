Pulling back that sheet was shocking—anddefinitely exciting as well. I took my scalpel and cut a fine line down the skinover the breastbone. The mystery of the human body was about to reveal itself.At that moment I also stripped the body of its sacred nature. I crossed a linethat is nearly impossible to recross ever gain. Thanks to science, a huge amountof factual knowledge has been gained, but at the same time a wealth of spiritualwisdom has been lost.Why can’t we have both?It would take a leap of creative thinking, a breakthrough. I’m calling thisbreakthrough the reinvention of the body. You may not realize it, but your bodyis an invention to begin with. Pick up any medical journal, and you come awaywith a host of concepts that are purely man-made. One day I sat down and listedthe articles of faith I was taught in medical school. It came to a long list ofdubious propositions, as follows:The body is a machine assembled from moving parts, and like all machines itwears out over time.The body is at constant risk for contamination and disease; a hostileenvironment teems with invading germs and viruses waiting to overwhelm thebody’s immune defenses.Cells and organs are separate from each other and should be studied separately.Random chemical reactions determine everything that happens in the body.The brain creates the mind through a storm of electrical impulses combined withbiochemical responses that can be manipulated to alter the mind.Memories are stored in brain cells, even though no one has ever discovered howor where this occurs.Nothing metaphysical is real; reality comes down to atoms and molecules.Genes determine our behavior; like microchips, they are programmed to tell thebody what to do.Everything about the body evolved as a matter of survival, the ultimate goalbeing to find a mate and reproduce.I used to find this list very convincing. The bodies that I examined and treatedin my medical practice conformed to it. Patients came to me with parts that werewearing out. I could pare their symptoms down to treatable problems. Iprescribed antibiotics to fend off invading bacteria, and so on. And yet everyone of these people lived lives that had nothing to do with machines breakingdown and needing repair. These lives were full of meaning and hope, emotions andaspirations, love and suffering. Machines don’t lead such lives. Neither docollections of organs. Before long I began to see that the body as seen throughthe lens of science was inadequate and artificial.Without a doubt, the body needs reinventing. To have a meaningful life, you haveto use your body—you can’t experience anything without one—and so your bodyshould be meaningful, too. What would give your body its highest meaning,purpose, intelligence, and creativity? Only the sacred side of our nature. Thisled me to the phrase “resurrecting the soul.” I am hesitant to use religiousterms because they are loaded with emotional baggage, but soul is unavoidable.Ninety percent of people believe they have a soul, and that it gives their livesultimate meaning. The soul is divine; it connects us to God. Insofar as lifecontains love, truth, and beauty, we look to our soul as the source of thosequalities; it’s no accident that a perfect love is called a soul mate.There is constant feedback between the soul and the body. We invented theseparation between the two, and then came to believe that separation was real.You may object that you’ve never felt ecstatic or sensed the presence of God.This simply reflects our narrow conception of the soul, confining it toreligion. If you look into the wisdom traditions of every culture, you find thatthe soul has other meanings. It is the source of life, the spark that animatesdead matter. It creates the mind and emotions. In other words, the soul is thevery foundation of experience. It serves as the channel for creation as itunfolds in every second. What makes these lofty ideas important is thateverything the soul does is translated into a process in the body. You literallycannot have a body without the soul. This is the forgotten miracle. Each of usis a soul made flesh.I want to prove to you that your body needs reinventing and that you have thepower to accomplish that. Every generation has tinkered with the body, strangeas that sounds. During the pre-scientific age, the body was deeply distrusted,and it was provided with squalid sanitation, wretched food, and barely enoughprotection from the elements to survive. Thus it became natural to expect ashort, nasty life filled with pain and disease.So that’s exactly what the body produced. People lived thirty years on average,and were scarred for life by childhood illnesses. You and I benefited enormouslywhen this life view became outdated. As we began to expect more from our bodies,we stopped mistreating them. Now your body is ready for the next breakthrough,which will reconnect it with meaning, with the deeper values of the soul. Thereis no reason to deprive your body of love, beauty, creativity, and inspiration.You are intended to experience ecstasy just as much as any saint, and when youdo, your cells will join in.Life is meant to be a complete experience. People keep struggling with problemsboth physical and mental, never suspecting the root cause: that the bond betweenbody and soul has been severed. I wrote this book in the hope of restoring thatbond. I’m as eager and optimistic as the first day I used my scalpel to uncoverthe mysteries waiting under the skin, only now my optimism extends to the spiritas well. The world needs healing. To the extent that you wake up your soul,humankind is waking up the world’s soul. It may yet happen that a wave ofhealing will sweep over us, a small wave at first, but one that could swellbeyond all expectations in a single generation."},{"pageContent":"[images/Chop_9780307452344_epub_L03_r1.jpg]REINVENTINGYOUR BODY[images/Chop_9780307452344_epub_L03_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"FROM BREAKDOWN TOBREAKTHROUGH[images/Chop_9780307452344_epub_L02_r1.jpg]For you and me, the body poses problems that will only grow worse. As childrenwe loved our bodies and rarely thought about them. As we grew older, though, wesoon fell out of love, and with good reason. Billions of dollars are spent tocure the body of its many ills and miseries. Billions more are thrown down thedrain for cosmetics, whose purpose is to fool us into thinking we look betterthan we do. To be blunt, the human body is unsatisfactory and has been for along time. It can’t be trusted, since sickness often strikes without warning. Itdeteriorates over time and eventually dies. Let’s attack this problem seriously.Instead of making do with the physical form you were given at birth, why notlook for a breakthrough, a completely new way of approaching the body?Breakthroughs occur when you start thinking about a problem in a fresh new way.The biggest breakthroughs occur when you start thinking in an unbounded way.Take your eyes away from what you see in the mirror. If you came from Mars andhave never seen how the body ages and declines over time, you might believe itwould work in just the opposite way. From a biological point of view, there’s noreason why the body should be flawed. So start there. Having erased everyoutworn assumption from your mind, you are now free to entertain somebreakthrough ideas that totally change the situation:Your body is boundless. It is channeling the energy, creativity, andintelligence of the entire universe.At this moment, the universe is listening through your ears, seeing through youreyes, experiencing through your brain.Your purpose for being here is to allow the universe to evolve.None of this is outlandish. The human body is already the universe’s mostadvanced laboratory experiment. You and I are at the cutting edge of life. Ourbest chance for survival is to embrace that fact. Rapid evolution, faster thanthat for any other life-form on the planet, gave us our present state ofever-increasing health, longer life-span, exploding creativity, and a vision ofpossibilities that science advances faster and faster. Our physical evolutionceased around 200,000 years ago. You don’t possess liver, lungs, heart, orkidneys different from those of a cave dweller. Indeed, you share 60 percent ofyour genes with a banana, 90 percent with a mouse, and more than 99 percent witha chimpanzee. In other words, everything else that makes us human has dependedon an evolution that is far more non-physical than physical. We inventedourselves, and as we did so, we brought our bodies along for the ride.HOW YOU INVENTED YOURSELFYou have been inventing your body from the day you were born, and the reason youdon’t see it that way is that the process comes so naturally. It’s easy to takefor granted, and that’s the problem. The flaws you see in your body today aren’tinherent. They aren’t bad news delivered by your genes or mistakes made byNature. Your choices each played a part in the body you created, eitherconsciously or unconsciously.Here’s a list of physical changes that you have made and continue to make. It’sa very basic list, all medically valid, and yet hardly any part of your body isexcluded.Every skill you learn creates a new neural network in your brain.Every new thought creates a unique pattern of brain activity.Any change in mood is conveyed via “messenger molecules” to every part of thebody, altering the basic chemical activity of each cell.Every time you exercise, you alter your skeleton and muscles.Every bite of food you eat alters your daily metabolism, electrolyte balance,and proportion of fat to muscle.Your sexual activity and the decision to reproduce affects your hormonalbalance.The stress level to which you subject yourself raises and lowers your immunesystem.Every hour of total inactivity creates muscle atrophy.Your genes tune in to your thoughts and emotions, and in mysterious ways theyswitch on and off according to your desires.Your immune system gets stronger or weaker in response to being in a loving orunloving relationship.Crises of grief, loss, and loneliness increase the risk of disease and shortenedlifespan.Using your mind keeps your brain young; not using your brain leads to itsdecline.Using these tools, you invented your body and can reinvent it anytime you want.The obvious question is, Why haven’t we reinvented our bodies already? Certainlythe problems have been staring us in the face long enough. The answer is thatsolving small pieces of the puzzle has been much easier than seeing the whole.Medicine is practiced in specialties. If you fall in love, an endocrinologistcan report on the decline of stress hormones in your endocrine system. Apsychiatrist can report on your improved mood, which a neurologist can confirmthrough a brain scan. A dietician may be worried that you’re losing yourappetite; on the other hand, what you do eat is digested better. And so it goes.No one can provide you with a complete picture.To make matters more complex, because the body is so fluid and so superblymultitasking, it’s difficult to imagine there’s any one step to take that couldlead to transformation. Right now you may be in love, pregnant, running down acountry lane, eating a new diet, losing sleep or gaining it, doing better atyour job or worse. Your body is nothing less than a universe in motion.Reinventing the body means changing the whole universe.Trying to tinker with your body misses the forest for the trees. One personfixates on her weight, another trains for a marathon, and yet another isadopting a vegan diet while her friend is dealing with menopause. Thomas Edisondidn’t tinker with building a better kerosene lamp; he abandoned the use offire—the only human-generated source of light since prehistoric times—and brokethrough to a new source. That was a quantum leap in creativity. If you are thecreator of your body, what is the quantum leap awaiting you?GOING BACK TO THE SOURCEIf we use Edison as our model, the last great reinvention of the body followedcertain principles:The body is an object.It fits together like a complicated machine.The machine breaks down over time.The body’s machinery is constantly attacked by germs and other microbes, whichare also tiny machines on a molecular scale.But these are all outmoded ideas. If any of these assumptions were true, thenthe following couldn’t happen: a new syndrome recently appeared calledelectro-sensitivity, in which people complain that simply being near electricitycauses discomfort and pain. Electro-sensitivity is taken seriously enough thatat least one country, Sweden, will pay to have a person’s house shielded fromthe electromagnetic field if they are diagnosed as electro-sensitive.The widespread fear that cell phones harm the body has reached no definitiveconclusion, but it seemed far easier to test whether there is such a thing aselectro-sensitivity. In one experiment, subjects were put inside anelectromagnetic field (we are surrounded by these every day in the form ofmicrowaves, radio and television signals, cellphone transmissions, and powerlines), and as the field was turned on or off, they were asked to say what theyfelt. It turned out that nobody did better than random. People who describedthemselves as electro-sensitive did no better than anyone else, which means nobetter than random guessing.However, this didn’t settle the matter. In a follow-up experiment, people weregiven cell phones and asked if they could feel pain or discomfort when theyplaced the phones against their heads. The electro-sensitive people described arange of discomfort, including sharp pain and headache, and by looking at theirbrains with MRIs, it could be seen that they were telling the truth. The paincenters in their brains were activated. The catch is that the cell phones weredummies and were emitting no electrical signals of any kind. Therefore, the mereexpectation that they would be in pain was enough to create pain in certainpeople, and the next time they used a real cell phone, they would suffer fromthe syndrome.Before you dismiss this as a psychosomatic effect, pause and consider. Ifsomeone says he is electro-sensitive, and his brain acts as if he iselectro-sensitive, the condition is real—at least for him. Psychosomaticconditions are real for those who experience them. But it’s just as true to saythat they created the conditions. In fact, there is a much larger phenomenon atwork here—the ebb and flow of new diseases that may be new creations. Anotherexample is anorexia and related eating disorders like bulimia. A generation ago,such disorders were rare, and now they appear to be endemic, especially amongteenage girls. Premenstrual syndrome, or PMS, had its heyday but now seems to befading. Cutting, a form of self-mutilation in which the patient, usually a youngwoman, secretly slices superficial wounds into her skin with a razor or knife,appears to be on the rise after a period of almost total obscurity.When such new disorders appear, the first reaction is always that the victimscreated a sickness that is essentially imaginary or psychotic. Yet when thedisorder spreads, and doctors find that patients cannot turn off the switch thatturned the illness on, there can be only one conclusion. Self-created symptomsare real.Machines can’t create new disorders. But then the whole machine model wasimperfect from the start. If you drive a car long enough, its moving parts areground down by friction. But if you use a muscle, it gets stronger. Non-use,which helps keeps a machine in pristine condition, leads to atrophy with ourbodies. Creaky, arthritic joints seem like a perfect example of moving partsthat have worn out, but arthritis is actually caused by a host of complexdisorders, not just simple friction.During your lifetime this outworn model of the body hasn’t changed but has onlybeen tinkered with. So what is your body, then, if it’s not a machine? Yourwhole body is a holistic, dynamic process in support of being alive. You are incharge of that process, and yet no one has given you the knowledge of how youshould approach your job. Perhaps that is because the enterprise is immense: itcovers everything, and it never stops.THE PROCESS OF LIFEAt this moment your body is a river that never stays the same, a continuousstream merging hundreds of thousands of chemical changes at the cellular level.Those changes aren’t random; they constantly serve the purpose of moving lifeforward and preserving what’s best from the past. Your DNA is like anencyclopedia that stores the entire history of evolution. Before you were born,your DNA thumbed through the pages to make sure every piece of knowledge was inplace. In the womb, an embryo starts out as a single cell, the simplest form oflife. It progresses to a loosely assembled blob of cells. Then, step by step,the embryo goes through the evolutionary stages of fish, amphibian, and lowermammal. Primitive gills appear and then disappear to make way for lungs.By the time a baby emerges into the world, evolution has overshot the mark. Yourbrain was too complex as a newborn, with millions of unnecessary neuronalconnections built into it, like a telephone system with too many wires. Youspent your first few years paring down those millions of surplus connections,discarding the ones you didn’t need, keeping those that functioned to make youexactly who you were. But at that point physical evolution reached unknownterritory. Choices had to be made that were not automatically built into yourgenes.A baby stands at the frontier of the unknown, and its genes have no more oldpages left in the encyclopedia. You had to write the next page yourself. As youdid so, starting the process of forming a totally unique life, your body keptpace: your genes adapted to how you think, feel, and act. You probably don’tknow that identical twins, born with exactly the same DNA, look very differentgenetically when they grow up: certain genes have been switched on, othersswitched off. By age seventy, images taken of the chromosomes of two twins don’tlook remotely the same. As life diverges, genes adapt.Take a simple skill like walking. With each clumsy step, a toddler begins tochange its brain. The nerve centers responsible for balance, known as thevestibular system, start to wake up and show activity; this is one area of thebrain that can’t develop in the uterus. Once a toddler has mastered walking, thevestibular system has completed this phase of its function.But later, after you grow up, you might want to learn to drive a car, ride amotorcycle, or walk a balance beam. The brain, even though it may be mature,doesn’t stop there. Quite the opposite: when you want to learn a new skill, yourbrain adapts according to your desire. A basic function like balance can befine-tuned and trained far beyond the base level. This is the miracle of themind-body connection. You are not hard-wired. Your brain is fluid and flexible,able to create new connections up into very old age. Far from decaying, thebrain is an engine of evolution. Where physical evolution appeared to stop, itactually left an open door.I want to take you through that door, because much more lies beyond it than youever imagined. You were designed to unlock hidden possibilities that will remainhidden without you. An image comes to mind of probably the greatest feat ofbalance ever exhibited by a human being. You may have seen photos of it. OnAugust 7, 1974, a French acrobat named Philippe Petit breached security at theWorld Trade Center. He climbed onto the roof and, with the help of confederates,strung a 450-pound cable between the two towers. Petit balanced himself with atwenty-six-foot pole as he walked out onto the cable, which stretched 140 feet.Both towers were swaying; the wind was high, the drop below his feet was 104stories, or a quarter of a mile. Petit was a professional high-wire artist (ashe called himself), and he had taken a basic ability of the body, balance, to anew stage.What would terrify a normal person became normal for one person. In essence,Petit was at the cutting edge of evolution. He made eight crossings on the wire,which was only three-quarters of an inch in diameter. At one point Petit sat onthe wire and even lay down on it. He realized that this was more than a physicalfeat. Because of the unwavering concentration that was required, Petit developeda mystical regard for what he was doing. His attention had to focus withoutallowing fear or distraction to enter for even a second. Normally the brain istotally incapable of such unwavering focus; distractions roam the mind at will;fear automatically responds at the first hint of danger. But one man’s clearintention was enough: the brain and body adapted; evolution moved ahead into theunknown.NO MORE BREAKDOWNS, ONLY BREAKTHROUGHSYou, right this minute, stand at the growing tip of evolution. The next thingyou think, the next action you take, will either create a new possibility foryou, or it will repeat the past. The areas of possible growth are enormous andyet mostly overlooked. It’s worth making a list to see what the territory aheadlooks like. I took a piece of paper and wrote down as quickly as possible allthe aspects of my life that need growth. I didn’t limit myself. Anything Iwanted to experience, any obstacle that has been holding me back, any ideal Iwanted to live up to went on the list. Here’s what I came up with:Love Guilt Eternity Death Hope Timelessness Transformation Lack Action AfterlifeFaith Desire Innocence Intention Motivation Grace Vision Karma RenewalSelfishness Choice Loss Inspiration Vulnerability Insecurity Power Illusion FearControl Freedom Intuition Surrender Presence Crisis Forgiveness Non-attachmentEnergy Rejection Attention Trust Playfulness Silence Resistance AppreciationBeingIf you want to know where the universe wants you to go next, this list offers alot to choose from. Your soul is funneling energy and intelligence that can beapplied in any of these areas. Take love, for example. Today you are either inlove, out of love, wondering about love, trying to get more love, spreading yourlove around, or mourning the loss of love. All of these mental activities, bothconscious and unconscious, have consequences for the body. The physiology of awidow grieving for her husband who died of a heart attack is very different fromthe physiology of a young girl who has just fallen in love. We can measure thedifferences crudely by drawing a vial of blood and examining hormone levels,immune response, and levels of various messenger molecules that the brain usesto send information to the body. We can get subtler and take an MRI, looking atwhich areas of the brain light up when a particular emotion is felt. But it’sobvious that grief and love are worlds apart, and every cell in your body knowsit.Once you realize how many breakthroughs you’d like to make, the hard part ischoosing where to start. Which is why humankind has relied so heavily on greatspiritual guides to give us a sense of direction. Imagine that you went to see anew doctor and he turned out to be Jesus or Buddha. If you came in with stomachcramps, Jesus might say, “It’s just the flu. The real problem is that youhaven’t found the Kingdom of God within.” After running tests for heartfunction, Buddha might say, “You have some minor blockage in your coronaryartery, but what I really want you to do is get over the illusion of theseparate self.” In real life nothing close to that happens. Doctors are trainedto be technicians. They don’t think about your soul, much less work to heal it.A doctor visit is a ritual that’s not much different from bringing a car to amechanic’s garage and asking why it doesn’t run properly.Jesus and Buddha didn’t leave out any aspect of life. They diagnosed the wholeself—physical, mental, emotional, social—with uncanny accuracy. Your soul cantake over the function of an ideal physician, because it stands at the junctionpoint between you and the universe. Maybe wherever Jesus and Buddha came from,you can go. The secret is to open yourself up. You never know where the nextbreakthrough will come. The door opens, and from that moment on, your life istransformed.QUIZ: ARE YOU READY FOR CHANGE?Although we have all lived with outmoded ideas about the body, the momentum ofchange has been gathering. The old model shows many signs of breaking down. Haveyou been part of this change? The following quiz examines how receptive you areto personal change. We can all become more open, but it’s good to have astarting point before the journey begins.Answer the following questions:Yes___No__I believe that the mind influences the body.Yes___No__I believe that some people have had amazing recoveries from illnesstheir doctors can’t explain.Yes___No__When physical symptoms appear, I seek alternative treatment.Yes___No__Hands-on healing is a real phenomenon.Yes___No__People can make themselves sick without a physical cause.Yes___No__I don’t have to see healing to believe it exists.Yes___No__Traditional medicine knows things that scientific medicine hasn’tdiscovered yet.Yes___No__I can alter my genes by how I think.Yes___No__Human lifespan isn’t determined by genes.Yes___No__Scientists will not discover a single gene for aging—the process isfar too complex.Yes___No__Using my brain will keep it from aging.Yes___No__I have the ability to influence whether I get cancer.Yes___No__My body responds to my emotions: when they change, so does my body.Yes___No__Aging contains a major mental component. Your mind can determinewhether you age quicker or slower.Yes___No__I am generally happy with my body.Yes___No__I don’t feel my body is going to betray me.Yes___No__I pay attention to hygiene, but germs aren’t a major issue with me.Yes___No__I have healed myself at least once.Yes___No__I’ve had at least one experience with Eastern medicine (acupuncture,qigong, Ayureveda, Reiki, etc.)Yes___No__I’ve used herbal remedies that were effective.Yes___No__I’ve used meditation or other stress-reduction techniques.Yes___No__Prayer has the power to heal.Yes___No__Miraculous cures are possible and legitimate.Yes___No__My body has as good a chance of being as healthy ten years from now asit does today.Yes___No__Even though the average elderly person takes seven prescription drugs,I foresee turning seventy on no drugs at all.Total Yes______EVALUATING YOUR SCORE:0–10 Yes answers. You accept the conventional notion that the body is basicallyfixed, either by genes or mechanical processes of decay and aging. You expect towear out over time as you age. Your optimism about alternative medicine isdistinctly limited and may be totally overshadowed by skepticism. You wouldnever rely on healers, and look upon so-called miraculous cures as either fraudor self-deception. On the one hand, you trust medical science and expect doctorsto take care of you, but on the other, you don’t pay much attention to your bodyand feel fatalistic about things that can go wrong with it.Given the possibility of a major breakthrough, you feel cautious about makingany major changes in your life.11–20 Yes answers. Your experience has caused you to shift away fromconventional wisdom about the body. You are open to change and have broadenedyour ideas about healing. Either you or your friends have tried some form ofalternative treatment with success, and you no longer believe that mainstreammedicine is the only answer. Yet the claims of hands-on healing probably makeyou skeptical. In general, you haven’t found a way of understanding the bodythat’s more satisfying than the Western scientific model, yet you are aware thatunconventional approaches can be valid.You are attracted to the possibility of making a major change in your life,although you haven’t decided which path is right for you.21–25 Yes answers. You have made a conscious effort to shift away from the oldparadigm. You firmly accept alternative therapies. You seek conventionaltreatment only after you’ve tried holistic medicine, and even then you are waryof drugs and surgery. Your view of the body is likely to be tied to a spiritualjourney that you take quite seriously. You identify with other seekers of higherconsciousness. You believe firmly in hands-on healing. You question whether anyform of materialism can really plumb the deeper mysteries of life.You have embraced personal transformation as a major goal in your life and wantto change as rapidly as possible."},{"pageContent":"BREAKTHROUGH #1YOUR PHYSICAL BODY IS A FICTIONBreakthroughs depend on daring ideas, so let’s begin with the most daring ofall. Your physical body, which you have always assumed to be real, is actually afiction. If you could see that your physical body is an idea your mind isstubbornly holding on to, an enormous breakthrough would take place. You wouldno longer be imprisoned in a lump of matter. Best of all, you would be free toadopt a much better idea of your body.Certainly the five senses seem to confirm our physicality. It might bedisturbing to realize that the touch of warm, soft skin is only an idea. But itis. Other cultures have offered very different ideas. To early Christians, thebody was spirit made flesh, the fleshly part being an illusion. To touch warmskin was to touch temptation. To the Hopi Indians, the entire universe is a flowof energy and spirit, and therefore the body is a transient event in that flow;to touch warm skin was like touching a puff of wind. Buddhists combine thenotions of transience and illusion; to them the body is like a ghostly river,and being attached to it is the source of all suffering. To touch warm skin isto sink deeper into illusion.Those ideas are just as valid as the idea that you have a physical body—a thing,an object—and they point to a simple fact: there was always something suspiciousabout human beings fitting so neatly into the material world. Rocks arematerial, but they don’t have emotions. Trees are material, but they have nowill. Every cell is composed of matter, but cells don’t write music and makeart. The universe took human evolution far beyond the physical. Think howstrange it would be if you treated a book as merely a physical object. You couldburn it for fuel or use it as a doorstop. You could crumple up the pages andplay wastepaper-can basketball with them. If the book is big enough, you couldhurl it at someone like a weapon. Yet obviously the whole point of a book, itsvery reason for existing, would be missed. What is a book if not a source ofinformation, inspiration, pleasure, and beauty? It’s just as mistaken toapproach your body as a physical object, even though it, too, burns fuel, playsgames, and turns into a weapon whenever a fistfight or a war breaks out.Your body already knows that its purpose in life isn’t physical. If you lookthrough a microscope and watch a germ being surrounded, engulfed, and destroyedby a white cell known as a macrophage (literally, “big eater”), nothing couldseem more physical. But your eyes are deceiving you. What you are actuallyseeing is intelligence at work. A macrophage must first identify the intruder.It must decide if the intruder is friend or foe. Having made this decision, themacrophage must move into close position for attack and then deploy its toxicchemical arsenal for killing the enemy.Purely physical entities don’t make decisions, certainly not such delicate yetpotentially fatal ones. If white cells go wrong, a macrophage can start eatingthe body’s own cells, creating an autoimmune disease such as rheumatoidarthritis or lupus, both of which are based on drastically wrong decisions. Yeta white cell’s intelligence is so profound that it orchestrates its own deathwhen it is no longer useful. Once it consumes the invading microbe, themacrophage dies, the victim of its own chemical weapons. Its suicide isvoluntary and altruistic. A single white cell knows that the good of the manyoverrides the good of the individual—and so it is that the cell makes theultimate sacrifice in support of that understanding.If being physical is an outworn model for the body, moving to a new model isurgent, because how we live is based on our underlying beliefs.AIDEN’S STORYSome people have already started inventing a new body that isn’t based on theold physical model. Aiden is a man now past fifty who is educated enough to havepursued a highly successful career in any field he chose. Instead he went on aspiritual quest that began almost by chance thirty years ago.“The whole thing started out very normally, with no signs that anything strangewas about to happen,” Aiden recalls. “I was a typical middle-class kid. I wentto college in the aftermath of Vietnam, although I wasn’t an idealist or aprotester.“But in my early twenties things began to happen that I had no control over. Atnight in my sleep I would feel that I was awake. I’d find myself in a kind ofbubble that could travel anywhere; when I was in that bubble, it was likeleaving my body. I had visions of places I didn’t recognize, including fantasticcities and landscapes. I saw people I knew, and felt that I had X-ray visionabout their hidden characters. These experiences were incredibly vivid. Icouldn’t dismiss them purely as dreams, because I sometimes had similarexperiences sitting in a chair, only instead of being in a bubble, I’d feelmyself rising out of my body. One time I expanded beyond the walls of the roomand could see outside my house, watching people and cars go by.”Neurologists would likely label such experiences artifacts of the brain, thekind of sensory distortions created by hallucinogens, epilepsy, and severemental illness. But whether that’s accurate or not, it seems the body’s physicallimitations can suddenly and unexpectedly disappear. Aiden went on.“I know now that this kind of experience isn’t as freakish as you might think.People have out-of-body episodes all the time. They have visions of angels; theyintuit events before they happen. Who hasn’t thought of a friend who calls youup on the phone the next minute? But people soon forget these experiences, ordismiss them as tricks of the mind. I went the other way. I took my experiencesseriously. I wandered off the map.”We were talking in a meditation center in midtown Manhattan where both of usoften saw each other in passing. I knew lots of people with similar stories.Most are fascinated by the prospect of reaching higher states of consciousness.So was he.“We assume we know what’s real and what’s not, but the line is much fuzzier thanpeople think,” he said. “I saw a news program about a priest in Brooklyn whocures people of chain-smoking. He sits a group of them in his living room andseems to do nothing. But he’s going inside and envisions a beam of holy lightcoming into his body. He asks God to relieve everyone in the room of theirsmoking habit, and that’s it. They walk out and never smoke again. There’s ahealer in Santa Monica who discovered his calling when a neighbor showed up. Shehad developed a case of warts that covered her whole body. One night she dreamedthat her neighbor could cure her simply by touching her. So she knocked on hisdoor and told him about her dream. He was shocked; he wanted her to go away. Butthe woman was desperate, and basically to humor her he touched her. Within a dayor two every wart had vanished.”Did you see such healing on your own? I asked. Aiden nodded. “Healing existseverywhere, but there’s a general level of resistance that keeps people fromseeing and accepting it.” His conviction was obvious. As for where he is now inhis journey, he sees himself as a work in progress.“I’ve passed through a lot of phases,” he said. “I’ve chased a lot of ideals andhad many disappointments. Did I get close to God? Do I think I’m enlightened?I’ve stopped worrying about those things.”“What did you learn, then?” I asked him.“I got put back together. My life isn’t confusing anymore. I know that I have asource, and being close to the source is a million times better than wanderingaround with no clue about who you are.”“So you’re the same person who started out on this path?” I said.Aiden laughed. “I wouldn’t even recognize him. Looking back, I can see that Iwas living in disguise. I took off the mask, and everything changed.”He was talking about self-transformation, a word that has become a cliché, butstill has a very real basis. The key to transformation is that you create thechange you want to see in yourself (which echoes Gandhi’s advice that you mustbecome the change you want to see in the world). In this case, the first changescame in Aiden’s body. He wasn’t by nature a spiritual seeker. He was probablyhelped by having no religious or spiritual ideas at all. Having nopreconceptions, he was open to change when it came along.THE FUTURE OF AN ILLUSIONYet change is also a choice. Your body is alive with unknown abilities, but itlooks to you for direction. When you introduce a new intention, your body findsa way, on its own, to adapt to anything you want. An example of this has beenoccurring over the past few years. The younger generation has been developing abrain with new capabilities. Researchers find that children who grow up withvideo games, iPods, e-mail, texting, and the Internet (so-called “digitalnatives”) generate different brain activity from those who grew up in an earliergeneration. Their brains grew sharp in one area—the skills needed to accessinformation quickly and play video games, for example—but dull in other areasthat emphasized social bonding and the ability to recognize emotions. If you arethe opposite of a digital native (the term for you is “digital naïve”), a week’sexposure to playing a video game or using the Internet intensively willstimulate your brain to shape itself to conform to your new digital environment.Once you change the brain, social norms change along with it. Earliergenerations of children learned about the world nested inside a tight-knitfamily, and so they became social creatures. More recent generations, on theother hand, spend hours a day alone at the computer, and experience a loose-knitfamily, and often no family at all. They have therefore become clumsy at empathyand social contact. Researchers have known, thanks to a breakthrough now twentyyears old, that the brain is “plastic”—adaptable to change, not fixed at birth.Now they face the fact that simple daily activity quickly creates new neuralnetworks. And there seems to be no limit to what the new brain can become.It can deliver spiritual experiences. In fact, if the brain hadn’t created aneural network for tuning in to spirit, there could be no experience of God. Itwas only in the past few years that medical science caught up with this fact.With the cooperation of His Holiness the Dalai Lama, brain researchers were ableto study advanced Buddhist monks who had been meditating between fifteen andforty years. In the laboratory the monks were hooked up to functional MRIs, atype of brain scan that can monitor changes in real time.The monks were asked to meditate on compassion. In Tibetan Buddhist teaching,compassion is the capacity to help any living creature at any time. As theymeditated, the monks began to generate the most intense gamma waves ever seen ina normal brain. Gamma waves are associated with keeping the brain functioning asa whole, and also with higher thinking. The most intense area of activitydisplayed by the monks was in the left prefrontal cortex, just behind the leftside of the forehead. This area is associated with happiness and positivethoughts.The researchers were elated with their findings, because this was the first timeanyone had shown that mental activity alone can alter the brain. It was alreadyknown that the brain could be trained in its physical performance—athletes, forexample, get better the more they practice. We praise them for having talent,will, and courage. All of that may be true. But to a neurologist, the greatestrunners, swimmers, and tennis players have highly trained their motor cortex,which is responsible for coordinating the complicated movements needed in anydifficult sport. Now it could be shown that the mere wisp of desire—in this casethe desire to be compassionate—trains the brain to adapt in the same way.Mysticism is also at work here. A form of love is holding sway over solidmatter. Jesus may have spoken in metaphor when he said that faith no greaterthan a mustard seed can move mountains, but the force of love can literally movethe brain. We were all taught—and have accepted without question—that the brainis a “computer made of meat,” to use the brutal phrase from a prominent expertin artificial intelligence at MIT. One piece of hardware, the cortex, isprogrammed to think, while another, the limbic system, is programmed foremotions. But this hard-and-fast division turns out to be false. If you took asnapshot of the activity in your brain at the very instant you had a great idea,dozens of areas in your brain would be lighting up, and for each new idea, asubtly new pattern would be present. A computer, by contrast, lights up the samecircuit boards each time any command is given. The notion of “hard wiring” fitsa computer. The brain, which can rewire itself in a split second, is obeyinginvisible forces totally unrelated to computers.How, then, can we translate this into everyday life? Experimenters at Harvardhave shown the immediate effect of love on the body. Subjects sat in a room towatch a film of Mother Teresa and her work with abandoned children in Calcutta.As the viewers watched the deeply moving images, their breathing rates and bloodchemistry changed, revealing greater calm and less stress. These responses arecontrolled by the brain.If even a brief exposure to higher love creates a new brain response, what aboutthe effects of love in the long run? Older couples who enjoy a good marriagehave been studied, and they report that they love each other more after thirtyor forty years than when they first fell in love. But they also report that it’sa different kind of love, not the overwhelming infatuation that poets compare tomadness, but a steadier, more constant, deeper love. This suggests that like theTibetan monks, happily married couples are experiencing a change in theirbrains. There certainly are striking resemblances between the two groups. Themonks exposed their minds to a state of calm, openness, peace, and “non-doing,”to use a common Buddhist phrase. The brain got used to that unbounded state, andthus it escaped from its own conditioning. Long-standing lovers also experiencecalm, peace, and openness around each other. Exposure to each other has done thework of meditation.SUBTLE ACTIONI’ve been making an argument that the nonphysical aspect of life is strongerthan the physical. Talk of invisible forces may sound overly mystical, but atthe personal level we can’t disconnect love, a purely invisible force, from thebody, and we don’t need science to prove that falling in love ignites an intensephysical change. Once you stop clinging to the idea that your body is a thing,you realize what should have been obvious: your body is the junction between thevisible and invisible worlds. Standing at this junction, you are constantlyadvancing into new regions of the invisible world. For every new step you take,your body follows.I call these new steps subtle actions, because they involve only the mind,whereas gross actions involve direct contact with the material world. Althoughsubtle action comes naturally to all of us, it can be broken down into steps, asfollows:HOW SUBTLE ACTION WORKS 1. You go inside and make your intention known. 2. You believe in getting results. 3. You don’t resist the process of change. 4. Your body shifts effortlessly at the physical level. 5. You repeat your subtle action until you have mastered the change you desire.The Tibetan monks accomplished all these steps. They meditated in order to makecontact with higher consciousness (Buddhists wouldn’t use the word soul). Theysat quietly, trusting that they would reach their goal. They practiced theirdiscipline diligently, keeping the goal in sight. Through subtle action alone,using no effort or physical struggle, compassion flowed into them. (I amreminded of a famous saying in India that wisdom isn’t something you learn, it’ssomething you become.)If invisible forces really do have power, then a subtle action—one entirelylocated in the mind—should be able to create even greater change than a grossaction. And so it turns out. Subtle action translates into uncanny physicalability. There’s another Tibetan meditation called tumo that protects the bodyfrom the elements. Monks who practice tumo can sit in caves overnight at subzerotemperatures clad only in a thin silk robe, and at dawn they emerge unaffected.The secret, according to Western medical observers, is that the monks haveraised their internal temperature by as much as eight degrees Fahrenheit, a heatthat utilizes a specific area of the brain, the hypothalamus. Body temperatureis ordinarily an automatic response, yet through subtle action a person can movethis response at will.Biofeedback experiments with ordinary people in the West have followed thisexample. Subjects are asked to focus on a small patch of skin on the back oftheir hand and will it to grow hot. Without long practice, many could raisetheir skin temperature enough, simply through focused attention, so that a redpatch appeared on the back of the hand.Yet Western medicine is baffled by yogic practices in India that go a stepfurther. Yogis have trained themselves in meditation to need only minimal food,barely a hundred calories a day. They have been buried in coffins for days,surviving on tiny amounts of air by lowering their breathing rates and basalmetabolism. The most advanced yogis are reputed by Western observers to sit sofirmly in samadhi (deep awareness) that they cannot be pushed over with physicalforce.This doesn’t mean that subtle action only works in a biofeedback lab or afteryears of spiritual discipline. The invisible powers that can be manipulated insuch specific ways are everywhere and play a part in every aspect of life. Welabel them as intelligence and creativity, and see them in action when a whitecell devours invading bacteria. Nobel Prizes have been given for figuring outjust a fraction of the chemistry involved in immune cells, which turn out to beso complex that now the immune system is known as a “floating brain.”The discovery of intelligent cells did nothing, however, to break down the oldmodel of the physical body. Instead we wound up with a paradox. If a white cellis intelligent, how did it get that way? It’s not part of the billions ofinteracting neurons in the brain. If you are a cell biologist, you must locate awhite cell’s intelligence in its proteins and enzymes, but those are onlysimpler molecules linked together, so are simple molecules smart? They are madeup of even simpler atoms. Are atoms smart? It would seem quite strange to thinkthat the same carbon we find in a lump of coal is intelligent enough to build amacrophage, along with a handful of other atoms like oxygen and hydrogen.Should carbon share the Nobel Prize, since it’s part of every brilliant brain?Yet you are stuck with this reductio ad absurdum unless you want to say thatintelligence is an invisible force that white cells happen to express. Andthat’s the very thing a cell biologist—or any physical scientist—cannotconclude, because everything about life, from DNA on up, must have a materialbasis. How much easier it would be to admit the obvious, that intelligence is aninvisible force, one that our bodies use extravagantly. Your body’s wholepurpose is to join the visible and invisible realms, and intelligence isn’t theonly force that wants to express itself through you. So do creativity, truth,beauty, and love.Sometimes it takes a stroke of revelation to bring this home. A man named Damonis returning home to Denver from a routine business trip. Damon steps off theplane expecting to fetch his luggage and take a cab home. Out of the corner ofhis eye he sees his wife, who has decided to surprise him by meeting him in thereception area.Damon recalls, “She was just standing there smiling, but in my chest I felt thisleap of joy. I don’t remember having such a feeling since we first fell in love.It caught me completely off guard, so much so that when my wife walked up, shesaw a look on my face. She asked me how I was feeling. I wanted to say ‘I loveyou’ more than anything in the world. But I didn’t. We had been having problems;she wasn’t in the best mood. So I just said I was fine, and we started walkingtoward baggage claim. But that moment haunts me. I don’t know where such intenselove came from, but it was so sharp and clear. Sad to say, I never feltcomfortable bringing it up again.”Love catches us off guard, because we wander around in a haze of busy activityand predictable events. To have a breakthrough, you must consciously connectwith the invisible forces that are everywhere around you, urging you to gobeyond your old conditioning. A sudden burst of love must be expressed and actedupon, or else it disappears, and ordinary life takes over once more. Subtleaction is urgent and necessary. It invokes these invisible forces and bringsthem into your body. Once you experience the change that makes, there’s noreason to cling to the fiction of being physical any longer.[images/Chop_9780307452344_epub_L05_r1.jpg]IN YOUR LIFE: THE ACTION OF LOVESubtle action can make the difference between dreaming of an ideal love andachieving it. In ordinary life, love has become entangled with something else,usually the ego. By nature the ego is selfish, and although love appeals to it,the ego wants to have love on its own terms. These must be sorted out. Oneperson may want to be in control, another to be taken care of. One may feelinsecure no matter how much love is directed her way, another may have todominate his partner in order not to feel vulnerable. But pure love exists, andit can be found. As with everything else, a process is involved. You begin whereyou are, and you grow through subtle action—that is, you quietly encourage thekind of love you really want.In your own life, consider the qualities of love at the highest level. Thesoul’s love is * unselfish * giving * blissful * warm and safe * self-sufficient, needing no outside validation * innocent * uncomplicated * kind, compassionate * constant * expanding * comforting * sacredThese are terms you’ve heard all your life, and you have experienced them eithera little bit or a great deal. Sit quietly and summon the memory of one quality,such as kindness, including your memories, visual images, emotions, and peopleconnected with this quality. Stay with your experience for a few minutes. Let itdeepen of its own accord. In effect, you are subtly directing your mind toaccess the quality of kindness, which forms a neural pattern that differs from amind that doesn’t dwell on kindness.In the same way, you can go within yourself and feel, as completely as possible,what “giving” or “sacred” means to you. Taking one quality at a time, payattention to it until you have a clear sense of its personal meaning. Whatmoment of love was most unselfish in your past? Can you recapture a sense ofinnocence, perhaps walking in the woods or gazing at the sea?Don’t try to get through the whole list at one sitting. Return to it every day,and as you do, build up an inner sense of your connection to love. Subtle actionworks by reaching for a deeper level of awareness. As you become more aware ofthe love that is inside you, you align with an invisible force. Quietly butsteadily, you will find that the higher qualities of love will start to enteryour life.Naturally, you will also be confronted by those times when love has faltered orseemed to leave you out. Face these feelings and memories without avoiding them.This isn’t an exercise in happy fantasies. Nor is it necessary to focus on thenegative: don’t dwell on loneliness, self-pity, anger toward a failed love, orboredom with a current relationship. Many people find it difficult to make thisdistinction. None of us has been trained in subtle action; therefore we entangleourselves in all kinds of feelings that we call love, and the result isconfusion and needless suffering.Subtle action sorts out the confusion, gently and effortlessly, by allowing theinvisible force of love to make itself known clearly. You stop mistaking otherthings for it. Here’s an example:Loreen, a young woman from Iowa, moves to a new city to take a job offer. It’s apromotion, but Loreen finds herself in a strange setting with none of her oldfriends. Very quickly she spots a coworker who attracts her interest. Usuallyshe’s rather standoffish in relationships, but her initial feelings quickly turninto a deep infatuation. Loreen flirts with this man, who is single andavailable. He acts friendly, but doesn’t ask her out on a date.She finds that her desire for him is turning into dreams and fantasies. Theybecome more erotic, and she drops stronger hints that she is interested in himromantically. To Loreen’s surprise, he says that he knows she’s in love withhim, but he doesn’t feel the same way. He acts sympathetic and understanding,which makes him all the more attractive. Loreen feels torn between her intensedesire and the knowledge that he is unavailable. She intensifies her campaign,leaving some suggestive phone messages and lying in wait at work on the offchance that she will “accidentally” run into this man. Things come to a head atthe office Christmas party, when she drinks too much and throws herself at himin front of other people. Loreen clutches him so tight that he has to peel heroff.The next day the man leaves a note on her desk advising her to seek help. Loreenfeels confused and ashamed. She decides to go to a psychologist. In the firstsession she describes the situation in tears. “I love him so much, I’m besidemyself,” she says. The psychologist corrects her. “What you’re expressing isn’tlove.” Taken aback, Loreen asks, “If this isn’t love, what is it?”“It’s abuse,” he says. “You would see that if you didn’t feel so desperate. Whatyou’re calling love is a mask for deeper feelings you’re afraid to face.” Loreenis very shaken, but on a deeper level she recognizes the truth in thetherapist’s words.People often want to be rescued by love, and thus love gets tied to escapism andfear. Things you are afraid of, such as loneliness, isolation, and not fittingin, must be sorted out and healed on their own, not masked by throwing yourselfinto a relationship with someone you think will solve your fears for you. Peoplelike Loreen usually wind up never facing their neediness. Their brains form apattern of behavior so familiar that even the most negative feedback doesn’tchange it. Only subtle action can change the brain by introducing a newintention. (Remember the Tibetan monks and how they became compassionate—a newbrain pattern had to be created.) As you learn to heal through subtle action,you won’t be forced into situations that promote failure and rejection. Thoseare reflections of your old inner state, from which you are slowly shiftingaway.As negative impressions and memories arise, simply paying attention to them hasa healing effect. Subtle action operates by looking, watching, and being aware,but not judging, condemning, or rejecting. The negative imprints of your pastare not the real you. They are the scars of experience, whereas the good thingsfrom your past are signposts pointing toward an opening. By feeling what love islike inside, you activate dormant impulses of love in the here and now. Yousignal to the universe that you are open, accepting, and receptive to change.Then change will appear, first as fresh feelings inside yourself, the fragilesprouting of love in its higher form. Be patient and continue to be aware. Moremoments will come when you do feel kinder or more unselfish, compassionate, orgiving. You will also see reflections of these same qualities outside yourself.You will notice them in other people; they will begin to direct them toward you.Let the process expand. Don’t demand kindness or giving of yourself or anyoneelse. Be like a child again, willing to grow without forcing anything; take achance, however small, at being vulnerable.Above all, don’t let your self-image stand in the way. Self-image is constructedby the ego. It gives you a façade that you can show the world, but it also turnsinto a shield behind which you hide. If you let your self-image stand in theway, you can’t be open and receptive. Real change requires a relaxed, naturalattitude. Sadly, most people expend untold energy in protecting theirself-image, defending it from attacks both real and imagined. Instead, take theattitude that there’s nothing to protect and nothing to defend. You want to bestrong, but true strength comes from love that is certain and self-sufficient.False strength comes from building a wall of self-defensiveness. Keep your focuson feeling what love is like for you, and on gently wanting it to expand.This is a powerful example of how subtle action can accomplish far more thangross action, because only at the subtle level can you train your brain to becompletely new."},{"pageContent":"BREAKTHROUGH #2YOUR REAL BODY IS ENERGYIt’s not enough for a breakthrough to be daring; it must also prove useful. Thenext breakthrough, which says that your body is pure energy, dramatically passesthat test. I can pick up any object—a stick of wood, a match, a tungstenwire—and make it disappear from the physical world. By examining it under anelectron microscope, any piece of physical matter turns into a hazy cloud nomore solid than fog. It’s just another step in magnification for the fog tovanish into pure, invisible vibrations. Releasing the energy in those vibrationsis incredibly useful, which is why it changed the world when we humansdiscovered that wood could be burned, matches could carry fire from one place toanother, and tungsten could give off both heat and light when electricity wasrun through it.In every case, untapped energy stands at the junction point between the visibleand invisible worlds, which is how we’ve been describing your body. A piece ofwood is content to stand at the junction point without doing anything, but yourbody isn’t. Your cells constantly move back and forth across the border,lighting an inner fire. How DNA learned to do this remains a mystery, becauseit’s exactly as if a tungsten wire learned to glow, or a match could strike itsown spark, without outside help. But the miracle goes much deeper than that.When wood burns, it crumbles into ashes and is gone. When tungsten incandesces,it is doomed one day to burn out. But DNA grows and multiplies as it releasesenergy. In fact, the only thing that DNA does is to convert raw energy (heat andelectrical impulses) into countless complex processes. And since DNA, like anychemical, is itself made of energy, your body is a cloud of energy keepingitself alive by feeding off more energy.The closer you look, the more clearly you see that there are mysteries hiddenwithin mysteries here. The India I grew up in was a very religious country, evenmore so than today, and it contained a peculiar sort of spiritual groupie, aperson who liked to hang around with saints—saint is an honorary term applied tosomeone in a higher state of consciousness. Ordinary people hung around them inorder to soak up their energy. As a boy, I had an uncle who was fond of draggingme along on such junkets. At the age of eight or ten I would be taken to sitcross-legged on the floor, having bowed down and touched the saint’s feet inhomage. My uncle would chat with the yogi or swami, but the real purpose of hisvisit was to receive darshan, which is the way he soaked up the saint’s energy.As a term, darshan is simple—it basically means “to see” in Sanskrit. But itfelt like much more to me: the experience of receiving someone else’s energy wastruly wonderful. Certain saints made me feel buoyant and carefree. Others mademy mind go quiet, so that while I was in the saint’s presence, I was at peace.Sometimes the darshan felt unmistakably feminine, as if my mother were smilingat me, even though the saint was a man (he might have been a devotee of Devi,the Divine Mother).I noticed other things from these visits. The effect diminished with distance.You could be walking toward the saint’s hut—these are generally poor peopleliving in austere seclusion—and step by step, the closer you got to the door,the more you lost any sense of trouble. Instead, your mind would become filledwith the conviction that God was in his heaven and all was right with the world.This uplifted state lasted for a while, but as my uncle drove us back home toDelhi, I felt less inspired and more my ordinary self, like a battery leakingits electrical charge. After some time, either hours or days, the saint’spresence faded into a memory.People like my uncle weren’t just energy junkies. They believed that exposingthemselves to a holy soul (atman darshan) raised their consciousness. For themoment, we don’t have to decide if that’s valid or not. But it would be amistake to call darshan purely mystical. When you see someone you love, yourbrain aligns with the love they have for you, and energy passes betweenyou—that’s why the first flush of love can be so overwhelming. In the NewTestament, Jesus not only speaks, but wanders among the people to be seen andtouched, and clearly his personal energy has a power all its own.Think of all the qualities about another person that you intuitively pick up atthe energetic level. Besides telling if someone is happy or sad, you can sensewhether they feel peaceful or perturbed. Looking into their eyes revealsalertness or dullness, tenderness or indifference. It’s hard to think of anyhuman quality that doesn’t have a kind of energy “signature.” The usefulness ofthis is that by changing your own signature, you can bring forth any quality youwant. Disturbance can be turned into peace, sadness into happiness, dullnessinto alertness. Your body is an energy converter at a very subtle level, wherethe most cherished aspects of being alive can be accessed. Saints know full wellthat they are standing at the junction point between the visible and theinvisible, because they feel themselves in the presence of God. The energy theytransmit is more subtle than heat or light. It’s this same energy that your bodyis also using in ways that science has yet to fathom.ENERGY AND HEALTHConsider the most basic function of energy, which is to keep your body alive.Your body is in a healthy state when its energy is in a healthy state. Such anotion goes beyond the worldview of mainstream medicine. A hundred years ago,germs were the stars of medicine. All the excitement centered on discovering newbacteria and viruses, matching them up with the diseases they caused, and thenkilling the germs before they could hurt the body. Today genes are the stars ofthe show, and the same pattern is repeating itself. The biggest excitementcenters on finding new genes, matching them with specific diseases, then tryingto manipulate or splice them before harm is done to the body. Yet the starshould have been energy, because germs and genes, like any object, are reducibleto energy, and therefore all harm caused to the body is traceable to thisfundamental force.Despite these facts, medicine hangs back from learning more. Energy is toodynamic. It shifts and changes. It leaves few traces behind, and the reason forits myriad changes is poorly understood. By contrast, chemicals are concrete,predictable, and come in small, neat packages. Turned into drugs, they can behanded out to patients in measurable doses. Yet this doesn’t get past theunderlying truth that drugs, too, are bundles of energy, and the effects theycause in your body (including side effects) are nothing but energy patternsmoving one way instead of another. It would be a major breakthrough if we couldmanipulate the body’s energy without resorting to drugs, most of which hit thebody too hard and too broadly. If you suffer a bad cut and the doctor injectsyou with penicillin, the antibiotic goes everywhere in your body. While it’skilling germs at the site of your wound, it’s also traveling to your intestinesand killing the single-celled intestinal flora that enable the digestiveprocess. That’s why diarrhea is a common side effect of Penicillin V, theupdated form of the original drug produced sixty years ago.Killing off too many single-celled creatures may seem like a simple action, liketoo much water overflowing the bathtub, but the chemical effects of penicillinlead to many possible side effects, some on the bizarre side, such as “black,hairy tongue.” Others commonly seen include irritation of the mouth or throat,nausea, upset stomach, and vomiting. But you might prove to be hypersensensitiveto penicillin, and then something alarming can happen, like skin eruptions,fluid in the larynx, and anaphylaxis—this last is a state of sudden shock thatcan be fatal. The reason for this wide, confusing, unpredictable range of sideeffects is that energy is complex. Your body is shuffling energy into countlesspatterns, and when you throw a broadly active drug into the mix, your wholeenergetic state is affected.Drugs are powerful and troubling, but everyday actions also alter the bodyprofoundly. When you walk into a room to deliver good or bad news to someone,you may not think that you are manipulating their energy, but you are. Causingsomeone else to become happy or sad goes deeper than a mood swing: the body isdirectly influenced, as messenger molecules course through the bloodstream,delivering to trillions of cells the energetic effect of whatever the brain isthinking and feeling. (It’s no accident that we say, “The bad news made mesick.” Your brain takes in the information, converts it to chemicals, and letsyour whole body know if there’s trouble in the world. Quite literally, you aremetabolizing the news and suffering from the toxins it contains.)The tiniest change in energy, no more than a few words, can lead to massivephysical disruptions. A person may be living happily, only to get the unexpectednews that divorce papers have been filed against him, or that his entire bankaccount has been wiped out. Injecting that information into the body has thesame effect as injecting a physical substance: chemical changes occurimmediately. Stress, weakness, and decreased functioning will spread from organto organ. At the very least the person will become depressed, but if the news isdevastating enough, normal energy patterns may not return. Grief is a state ofdistorted energy that can last for years. The loss of a mate can make you moresusceptible to disease and shorten your life. (This has been provenstatistically among widowers, who are subject to higher heart attack rates andshorter life spans.)On the surface, heart attacks, early death, depression, and the physical sideeffects of a drug like penicillin look entirely different from one another. Butthey have the same root cause: the body’s energy patterns are being distorted.It takes only a seed of disruption, such as a single malignant cell, to spreadincoherence everywhere; if the seed is allowed to grow, the energy of the wholebody will break down. It may sound strange to think of cancer as distortedenergy, but that’s just what it is. To remove that discomfort, you have to startthinking of the whole body in terms of energy. Dealing with your own energy isthe most effortless way to heal yourself, because you are going directly to thesource. When a distorted energy pattern returns to normal, the problemdisappears. Everyday experience tells us that this is plausible. A small childwho thinks that his mother has abandoned him in the grocery store will exhibitmultiple signs of physical and mental distress. But when the mother reappears,there is no more cause for anxiety. The normal pattern of feeling loved, wanted,and secure returns. And its return is automatic. The highest healing is equallyeffortless.GRAHAM’S STORYThe fact that energy is always creating patterns in, around, and through thebody has been incredibly useful to people who can tune in to their own energy.“At a dinner party several years ago, I saw a guest’s hand tremble as he reachedfor the salt,” recalls Graham, a friend of mine in his forties who works as anenergy healer. “The man was in his late thirties, and when I asked if somethingwas wrong, he talked freely about having Parkinson’s disease. His name was Sam,he owned a small business in town, and he had lived with his diagnosis for sevenyears. Sam managed his Parkinson’s carefully on a minimal dosage of medication,but he knew that was only temporary. Eventually the tremors would worsen, andfull-blown Parkinson’s would set in.”At the time of this encounter, Graham was just beginning to be interested inenergy work. He invited Sam to accompany him to California for a trainingworkshop in an ancient form of Chinese healing called qigong (pronouncedchee-GUNG).“I was new to any kind of hands-on healing, but I’d always been open to it,”Graham said. He had practiced meditation for many years and had read widely inEastern spirituality. “The notion that the body is composed of subtle energiesdidn’t put me off me the way it does many skeptics.“My new acquaintance was wary but willing to go with me to the weekend course.When I arrived to drive him to the airport, his tremors were more severe thanwhat I’d seen the first time. We didn’t talk about it, though, and the next daywe sat in a group of about fifty people who had signed up to learn aboutqigong.”Qigong, like other traditional Chinese medical treatments, is based oncontrolling and directing qi (or ch’i), the basic life-force that sustains thebody. Because some qigong practices are tied to wider spiritual beliefs that areconsidered non-Communist, qigong in the People’s Republic of China has beensubject to regulation and sometimes suppression by the government.“Our teacher, who was from Hong Kong, told us that qi exists at a subtle levelof the body. Its natural flow keeps a person healthy, but when these subtleenergies get imbalanced, disease results. Generally it takes years ofdisciplined training to control and change the qi in your body, but our teacherhad a new idea, that every thought causes a tiny change in the patterns of qi.He believed that even major illness and trauma could be unraveled, so to speak,by healing tiny mistakes in the qi, one at a time, like tiny links in a chain.”Graham took the training seriously and learned rapidly. Sam was lessdisciplined; he began with initial excitement, but learned in fits and starts.“Our teacher brought people up from the audience who had chronic conditions likelower back or neck pain. He made a simple diagnosis, and then he would adjusttheir qi,” said Graham. “The method was simple. In his mind the healer asks ifcertain aspects of a person are weak or strong. If he gets the feeling that anyaspect is weak, he asks for it to go back to being strong, the way it is in ahealthy person. These aspects could be anything physical, psychological, orenvironmental. If you had asthma, for example, our teacher wouldn’t ask justabout the lungs and respiratory system. He’d ask if the nervous system was weakor strong, he’d look into depression and general fatigue. Any disorder involveshunting for where the chain of energy has broken down, and then repairing it onelink at a time. The amazing thing was that the volunteers who came forward withsore backs and necks were healed on the spot.”For many westerners, the story so far contains some unresolved questions. Canthe body’s energy be detected by someone else? We know what it’s like to senseif someone is angry or sad, but we tend to call those emotional states, notenergy states. Can we go a step further and call disease an energy state? It’smeaningful that cancer is often detected first by the patient, who feels asudden drop in energy or an unexplained mood shift toward depression or vagueuneasiness. Qigong would call this a breakdown in the pattern of qi, whileWestern medicine waits for more-concrete physical changes before taking action.Even though we understand in theory that the body’s energy patterns are affectedat the quantum level, westerners don’t recognize that energy can be detectedsubjectively, either by the sick patient or a healer. The major sticking pointin Graham’s story, the notion that the qigong healer can change another person’senergy through intention, actually fits the field model of physics quite well.In Chinese medicine, qi is a field, just like a magnetic field, and it embracesboth patient and healer without any boundaries to separate them. A pocket magnetlooks separate and isolated, but it, too, is embraced by the entire magneticfield of the earth.Graham found that a simple demonstration helped to overcome some initialdistrust he had. “In qigong the main pathway of energy is up and down the spine.We got into pairs and did a simple muscle test. While I held my arm straightout, my partner would press down on it. We had no problem resisting the downwardpressure on our arms. Then we were asked to envision the energy running down ourspines and to follow it in our mind’s eye. As soon as I did that, I couldn’tresist the pressure on my arm; it became instantly weak.“Then we reversed the exercise. While my partner kept pushing down on myextended arm, I imagined the energy running up my spine. This time it was easyto resist the pressure on my arm; in fact, I felt stronger. At first we used themuscle test with extended arm—a simple form of kinesiology—but after a while thehealer could perform the testing in his mind, asking ‘weak or strong?’ withoutcontacting the patient’s body. I know it sounds incredible, but that’s the basisof the healing I’ve been doing for several years now.”And what happened to Sam, the man who suffered from early-onset Parkinson’s?“His tremors decreased dramatically while we were at the course,” said Graham.“Sam got very excited and talked about going off his medicine. Driving home fromthe airport, he seemed like a different person, enthusiastic and totally free ofsymptoms that I could observe. But I made Sam promise not to go off hismedications. We parted, and I don’t know what happened after that. I just hopehe kept up his qigong practice.”This story isn’t just about qigong; it illustrates a larger point: the body isnothing but energy patterns, and whether you are aware of it or not, you aremanipulating them. Energy is a clumsy word. It doesn’t denote how alive the bodyis, how trillions of cells can cooperate to create a whole, and how, if youincrease the positive energy in someone, they become incredibly more alive.The concept of vital energy hasn’t caught on in the West because it leaves nophysical traces. Without a map of how this energy flows, comparable to a map ofthe central nervous system, skeptics can call life energy imaginary. But thereare many medical treatments in India and China that rely upon exactly such maps,which were drawn purely by seeing energy channels through intuition. Acupunctureand acupressure are the best known of the Chinese systems.Here is a story I heard from Henry, a friend who visited a local acupuncturistin Los Angeles. “I had pulled a muscle in my upper arm doing work around thehouse, and although I thought the pain would go away on its own, it grew worseover the next three weeks. I knew, from doing this sort of thing to myselfbefore, that it was tendinitis. Instead of going to my family doctor, I decidedto try an alternative treatment first.“I was given the name of a good acupuncturist and made an appointment. He saidhe could help, and as I lay on his table he stuck needles in a few places, notjust on my afflicted muscle but also on other places on my neck and shoulder.When the treatment was over and I was about to leave, the acupuncturistsurprised me by asking if I was depressed. My mother had died the year before,and I told him that I had been feeling down, even though I didn’t think I wasstill grieving.“He told me that he had detected weak energy around me. That was how herecognized that I was depressed, and he suggested that I let him do a fewthings. I didn’t want to have more needles in me, but that’s not what he did. Hepressed a few points along my spine, very gently. He also told me he did alittle psychic work at the same time. The whole thing took no more than tenminutes, and he didn’t charge me.“As I was walking back to my car, I couldn’t tell if my tendinitis was anybetter, but my mood had shifted. Suddenly I felt very good. I was buoyant, myfootstep was lighter. Only then, when the gray cloud over me had lifted, did Irealize that I had been feeling down for quite a while. The next day I was stillin a good mood, almost elated. My shoulder improved enough that I didn’t go backto the acupuncturist. That visit stands out for receiving a healing I neverexpected.”THE ENERGY TO CHANGEThe difference between healthy and unhealthy energy can be summarized asfollows:Healthy energy is flowing, flexible, dynamic, balanced, soft, associated withpositive feelings.Unhealthy energy is stuck, frozen, rigid, brittle, hard, out of balance,associated with negative emotions.You can bring healing to any aspect of your life by shifting an unhealthy energystate into a healthy one. People who can’t find a way to change are entangled inone or more of the qualities just listed. The hard, frozen looks of hatred thatspouses exchange in a bad marriage express one kind of energy, while the soft,loving looks exchanged in a happy marriage express the other. The distinctionbetween physical and nonphysical is no longer relevant. In your body the soft,flowing blood fats that are healthy can become hard, stuck deposits of plaque inyour coronary arteries, which are unhealthy. In society, the soft, flowingexchange between people who are tolerant of each other can turn into hard, stuckfeelings of prejudice and animosity.There are strong indications that energy is more powerful than matter. Studiesin longevity, for example, examine why some people live to a healthy old age.Their secret isn’t good genes, diet, not smoking, or even exercise, beneficialas all those things may be. The highest correlation for reaching ninety orhundred years of age in good shape is emotional resilience, the ability tobounce back from life’s setbacks. That fits neatly with one of the qualities ofhealthy energy: flexibility.Starting in the late 1940s, Harvard Medical School undertook a study of youngmales to see why some developed premature heart attacks in middle age. Theleading correlation wasn’t high cholesterol, bad diet, smoking, or a sedentarylifestyle. The men who escaped premature heart attacks were likely to be thosewho faced their psychological problems during their twenties, as opposed to menwho ignored them. Psychological problems are marked by stuck, rigid attitudesand distorted emotions, pointing us once again to the importance of energy.I know a woman with a hair-trigger temper who recently received a joke videothat was going around, the kind that inserts your name into a generic scenario.It was voting season, and the video was titled “The one person who caused theelection to be lost.” It showed a mock newscast about how the presidency hadbeen lost because a single voter had stayed home on election day. Her name wasinserted into it. Most people would see this as a harmless reminder to vote, butthis woman became incensed. She wrote angry e-mails to the organization that wascirculating the videos, condemning them for invading her privacy. It was hoursbefore she stopped fuming, and for most of the day her family knew to stay outof her way.Here we see every sign of unhealthy energy in action. She was already stuck in apattern of getting angry. Her outrage was rigid and unyielding. It took a longtime to subside, and it was associated with negative emotions (not just angerbut resentment, victimization, and self-pity). Once she had erupted, it would dolittle good to treat the outward manifestations. Assuring her that the video wasjust a joke, imploring her to be reasonable, placating her with distractions orcheering up would all have missed the underlying cause, which was energy-based.Mainstream medicine vaguely understands how negative emotions can bleed intophysical symptoms. But two problems have blocked this from being a fruitful roadto treatment. First, distorted energy is too general and widespread. It isn’tpossible to define a “cancer personality,” for example, because disease-pronepeople are open to all kinds of disorders; there’s no one-to-one match betweenanxiety, for example, and cancer. Finding a simple correlation between negativethinking and a single disorder hasn’t worked out, either; nor can beinggenerally positive in your thinking safeguard you from a particular disorder.Your risk factors will improve overall by a certain percentage (usually small)compared with negative people, but beyond that, statistics don’t give us anyanswers.Second, having detected unhealthy energy patterns, conventional medicine isn’tequipped to offer a cure. Psychiatry comes the closest, but it is slow andunpredictable—traditional talk or “couch” therapy can last for years. Taking ashortcut by giving a drug, typically for anxiety and depression, alleviates thesymptom but doesn’t cure the underlying disorder. The effectiveness of a pillends the day you stop taking it. Still, psychiatry does direct us to the regionof energy where words and thoughts are powerful enough to move molecules. Togive just one instance, Prozac, the antidepressant that launched the era ofbillion-dollar drugs, had an unexpected side effect: it proved effective intreating obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).Patients suffering from OCD look like perfect examples of people whose lives arerun by their brains. They cannot stop repeating the same behavior (hand-washing,cleaning the house, adding up the numbers on license plates), and their mindsare filled with obsessive thoughts that return no matter how hard the persontries to evict them. Using a brain scan, neurologists can spot an abnormality insuch patients—specifically, low blood flow to the orbitofrontal cortex. Thisregion is associated with being able to make decisions and behave flexibly, thevery thing OCD sufferers can’t do well.Prozac restores normal activity in the brains of OCD patients, and with thatfinding, neurology moved a little closer to seeing the brain as an all-purposechemical factory that determines behavior. But then a new discovery threw thatview into question. When OCD patients seek so-called couch therapy, it turns outthat talking through their problems can also relieve their symptoms, and brainscans reveal that normal activity has been restored to their brains, onlywithout a drug. This makes logical sense as well. If you are depressed aboutlosing your money in the stock market, taking an antidepressant may relieve yoursymptoms, but having the market shoot back up will do the same thing, and farmore effectively, be cause now you may have a reason to be euphoric.Our ingrained habit in this society is to grab the Prozac and bypass thepsychiatrist, which once again comes down to trusting the physical over thenonphysical. We must overcome this bias, but how? Does this mean we should allimmediately seek psychotherapy?Most studies indicate that we are becoming by the decade a more anxious anddepressed society, more hooked on antidepressants and tranquilizers. Stresslevels keep increasing, whether from loud noise, long work hours without rest,interrupted sleep patterns, or pressure at work. Anyone suffering from suchstressors will tend to show a marked imbalance in the body, such as elevatedblood pressure, increased stress hormones like cortisol, or irregular heartrhythms. Psychiatry can’t address such a wide swath of problems. Trying tocreate a patch of coherence in someone’s life does small good when their wholesystem is in chaos.What’s really needed is a broad-spectrum cure. If all the qualities of unhealthyenergy, from blockages and rigidity to negative emotions, could be healed atonce, your body could quickly rebound to its natural state of health; it alreadyknows how to thrive in the flow of healthy energy. It takes one morebreakthrough to find such a cure, which we will come to next.[images/Chop_9780307452344_epub_L05_r1.jpg]IN YOUR LIFE: HOW EFFICIENT IS YOUR ENERGY?Every life-form uses energy with great efficiency. A wolf, leopard, or fieldmouse instinctively knows what food to eat, where to find it, how to survivehardship, and how to obey the rhythms of nature. Animals use life energy in theoptimal way for their species.Unlike creatures in the wild, you and I can manage our supply of energy any waywe choose. How you employ your energy makes all the difference between a lifewell lived and one that is squandered. You and I parse our energy according tothe way we express emotions, intelligence, awareness, action, and creativity,since all of these aspects require subtle energy. Much more than burningcalories is at stake. Energy must be considered holistically because when bodyand soul are aligned, every aspect of life is affected.To get a better idea of what energy efficiency means, take the following profilequiz. For each item, rate yourself from 1 to 3 according to how well itdescribes you.3 - This is how I am almost all the time.2 - This is how I am some of the time.1 - This is how I am a little of the time.__I leave work on time every day.

I’mhaving fun and getting things done.____Total ScoreLOOKING AT YOUR SCORE:43–51 points. You are leading an efficient life and have a good chance offeeling comfortable, contented, and in control. There are no drastic imbalancesin how you use your time and energy. Each aspect of your existence is given agood amount of attention.36–42 points. Your life is mostly under control and runs along well enough. Youhave minor areas of neglect, however, and there are times when you feel a littleoverwhelmed by all the things left undone. If you look closely, there areaspects of your life where you know you could be more efficient, using your timeand energy better. Attending to those aspects now will increase your sense ofcomfort and contentment.26–35 points. Your life is inefficient. You have a sense that you are treadingwater rather than getting ahead. Too much is out of your control, and yourability to cope with everyday challenges is only adequate. To begin to feel morecomfortable, you will have to discipline yourself and change your habits. Lookrealistically at your inefficient ways, because sloppiness or disorganization,procrastination or denial, impulsiveness or neglect drain our energy.17–25 points. Your life is barely your own because so much is out of yourcontrol. Daily life is a struggle just to keep things together, and most daysyou feel that you are losing that fight. On the periphery something very wrongis probably happening. You are being held back either psychologically or by badcircumstances. To get back on track, outside professional help will be needed.As you can see, energy gets diverted into dozens of areas in your life. Whenpeople find themselves struggling, they are squandering their energies. Twosolutions are available: you can increase the flow of subtle energy into yourlife, or you can use what you have more efficiently. The best way to increaseyour supply of subtle energy is to stop blocking it. The best way to use theenergy you have more efficiently is to expand your awareness. The great secretof awareness, as we saw, is that it can accomplish anything while doing almostnothing. The model for the body is always the soul, and the soul uses no energyat all. We’ll go deeper into this by seeing how subtle energy gets blocked anddistorted. At this point just be aware that you can receive more of theboundless energy your soul has to offer, and put it to good use in your life."},{"pageContent":"BREAKTHROUGH #3AWARENESS HAS MAGICWe need a breakthrough to manage the body’s energy. If distorted energy is theroot of all problems, how can it be brought back to its normal, healthy state?No one has taught us how to move energy. We are left to operate on the physicalplane, which is not only too crude but very often beside the point. One readsmedical articles, for example, that reduce love to a chemical reaction in thebrain. The neural activity of someone in love certainly looks different on anMRI from that of someone who isn’t in love—specific areas light up, and thereare changes in the levels of key chemicals like serotonin and dopamine, whichare linked to feelings of happiness and well-being.Yet it’s totally false to say that the brain creates love. Imagine yourselfsitting in a car late at night. Beside you is someone you have secretly loved,but you’ve masked your feelings, unable to express what’s in your heart. She (orhe) leans over and whispers something in your ear. Whether the words are “I loveyou” or “I don’t love you” will make all the difference. An MRI machine, if ithappened to come along on our date, would detect a completely altered state ofyour brain depending on whether the words make you feel elated or dejected. Yetit’s obvious that the brain didn’t create these states on its own. The wordsdid. How? They made you aware of something you desperately wanted to know.In other words, you became aware of whether or not you are loved. Words, whenspoken into someone’s ear, vibrate air molecules that in turn vibrate thetympanum, sending a signal to the inner ear and on to the auditory region of thecortex. That chain of events would happen even if the words were in a foreignlanguage, yet unless you understand the language, your awareness won’t change.Awareness is where meaning happens. If you want to change your body, a change inawareness must come first.Awareness acts like an invisible force, the most powerful one in your body. Itmoves energy while seeming to do nothing. Here we have the breakthrough weneeded, because awareness can turn unhealthy energy into healthy energy entirelyon its own. That is its unique magic.DAVID’S STORYThere are many mysteries to how awareness works. Let me begin with one thataffects everyone’s life, the mystery of seeing. When you see something, youbecome aware of it, and that alone can be enough to move the body in acompletely new direction.David, who is now in his thirties, was born a twin, but he had a tiny geneticheart defect that his twin lacked. “I was lucky, and my heart was repaired soonafter I was born,” he relates. “There was no reason for me to be treated anydifferently from my brother. But I remember from early on my mother’s anxiouslooks whenever I tried to do anything she thought was risky. My brother didn’tget those looks, and by the time we were four or five, he was considered thestrong one while I was the sensitive one. My family members, on the male side atleast, are all outdoor types. If you hunted and fished, you got approving looks.If you stayed indoors and read books, you got indifferent or worried looks.“There’s a lot more to raising kids than looking at them, of course. My parentsdid their best to provide equally for us and to love us the same way. I acceptedthat I was the fragile twin, and as we grew up, it amazed me how wrong myparents had been. My brother didn’t turn out to be a great success. He holds alow-level company job, and since his real passion is hunting and fishing, that’swhat he concentrates on. I, who always expected to be on the sidelines, grew upto get scholarships, a much better education, and a teaching job at a gooduniversity.“It took me years to realize that we were both shaped to become what we are. Ifmy mother had accidentally switched us in our cribs one day, I would have beenthe hunter and fisherman, my brother would have become the scholar. It gives mereal pause. What went on during those first three years before I have anymemory? My parents looked at me in a certain light, and as a result the rawmaterial of an infant got molded one way instead of another.”This is one example of seeing, but many others come to mind. We look at those welove entirely differently from people we don’t love. If someone close to us doessomething wrong, our gaze usually contains sympathy, tolerance, and forgivenessthat isn’t directed to someone we don’t love—they may receive accusation,judgment, and hostility instead. Your gaze doesn’t fall passively. It conveysmeaning; it makes another person aware of something. In other words, yourawareness speaks to theirs, and that is enough to create changes in the brain,leading to changes elsewhere in the body.There’s no limit to the result. Violence can break out on the streets when onemale eyes a female the wrong way—according to the male who thinks she’s his. (Inthe Southern United States, there was a long period when an innocent glance by ablack male could lead to a lynching.) The secret is to create positive effectsinstead of negative ones. It’s a mistake to believe that you are some kind ofradio telescope passively receiving signals from the universe. Seeing is active.You send out energy, and take in energy from others. You can decide to see withlove and understanding, acceptance and tolerance. When you do, these qualitiesexert a force on your surroundings that benefits everything and everyone.BODY AWARENESSAwareness would have no power if the body didn’t respond to it. But think of howmassive those responses actually are. If you feel a suspicious lump under theskin, a visit to the doctor will tell you that you are either all right or indanger. If you are in danger, the threat could be mild or severe. Each is astate of awareness (“I’m okay, there’s nothing to worry about,” “I’m introuble,” “I’m not safe,” “I may not make it”), and each brings a sharplydifferent reaction. Even if we say that the reaction is psychological, such asdepression in the face of bad news, there has to be a physical response: alteredbrain chemistry supports what’s happening in the psyche. In fact, your body isaware of everything. Every cell knows what your brain is thinking, how yourmoods change, where your deepest beliefs lie. As your awareness changes, yourenergy changes, and then your body changes. The chain of events moves from theinvisible realm to the visible on this path:AWARENESS → ENERGY → BODYSimple as this diagram looks, it maps a profound breakthrough, because itexplains medical findings that are otherwise mysterious. For example, nobodyunderstands a result from the Helsinki Study, one of the most famous researchprojects in preventing heart attacks. Middle-aged Finnish men at high risk forheart disease were divided into two groups. One, the casual group, visited theirdoctors a few times a year and were given general advice about losing weight,exercising, improving their diet, and not smoking (advice they were unlikely tofollow, given that they hadn’t in the past). The other group was followedintensively and put on a specialized program to reduce specific heart-attackrisks such as high blood pressure and elevated cholesterol.At the end of the study, the researchers were stunned to see that the casuallyfollowed group had not only fewer deaths overall, but fewer deaths from heartattacks. How could that be? A commentator on the study remarked that it might bea health risk to constantly worry about your heart and see that worry reflectedby a doctor you visit too often. From the level of awareness, this explanationmakes sense. It also makes sense of many diverse findings along the same lines.The fact is that men who confront their psychological problems in their twentiesare doing more to prevent early heart attacks than if they reduced theircholesterol. Elderly people who are emotionally resilient have a better chanceof living a long, healthy life than do elderly patients who are less resilientbut take vitamins and get regular checkups. Such findings are only a mystery ifyou ignore awareness and energy, the two foundations of the body.Millions of people don’t make this connection, and they are doomed to fightagainst their bodies. Think of the whole area of addictions and cravings. Tosomeone who can’t stop gaining weight, it seems that a physical craving isforcing them to overeat. Instead of normal hunger, they feel an urge to eat thatgoes beyond. But in fact the physical impulse masks what’s actually going on.The body has gotten stuck in a distorted pattern of behavior that began inawareness.What happens when you feel a craving? You are torn in two directions: theimpulse to resist fights the urge to give in. Let’s say you get up at midnightand pad downstairs to the refrigerator because you crave ice cream. At thatmoment, as you waver over eating a carton of double chocolate chip royale, youmay resist the urge, but you won’t change your habit. Your awareness is warringagainst itself. Engaging in this conflict, which happens over and over forpeople who overeat, gives a bad habit its power, because all your energy goesinto fighting against yourself with very little going toward a solution. If thesolution existed at the level of struggle, one side or the other would prevail.Either the craving would conquer your resistance, or your resistance wouldconquer the craving, but the result is a seesaw instead.It’s hard to look past your physical craving, because bad habits always create agroove that the body follows over and over. The craving doesn’t have to be formaterial things like the sweet taste of ice cream or the energy jolt ofcigarettes. You may be in the habit of flying off the handle or fretting overevery little thing. Anger and worry feel just as physical as hunger. People whocrave power or money describe it as being almost sexual. People who cravewinning describe it as a burst of adrenaline-fueled elation. Your body mirrorsyour desires so skillfully, completely, and silently that tracing the chain ofevents back to awareness isn’t easy. But we have to do it if we don’t want to beprisoners of our cravings.We all possess a level of awareness that doesn’t crave anything at all. Itstands apart from the struggle over “Do I eat this whole carton of ice cream ordon’t I?” When you find yourself at this level of awareness, the energy to eatisn’t activated, and when there’s no energy, the body doesn’t act. Everydayexperience validates this—when someone is grieving, for example, the appetitefor food vanishes. The same is true in cases of depression or deep worry, orwhen we’re falling in love. “I can’t think about food at a time like this” isfrequently heard at such times, and it’s accurate: your awareness can’t focus oneating, therefore there’s no energy behind it, and your body stops feelinghungry. The problem is that just as energy can get stuck in unhealthy patterns,so can awareness, which is why so-called “emotional eaters” have beenconditioned to respond in exactly the opposite of the normal response: theyovereat in times of grief, depression, and worry.Your body needs you to master how awareness works. Your state of mind sets thephysical agenda in trillions of cells, and they have no power to overturn theagenda on their own. Here’s what mastery of awareness looks like.WHEN YOU ARE FULLY AWAREYou can center yourself at will.You are familiar with a place of peace and silence inside.You aren’t divided against yourself by inner conflicts.You can transcend local disturbances and remain unaffected by them.You see the world from an expanded perspective.Your inner world is organized.This is what it means to rise above cravings. As you start to dip your spooninto the carton of double chocolate chip royale, your body doesn’t instantlyfind the same old groove and your mind doesn’t start struggling between “Do I,or don’t I?” Instead, other ideas are free to come to mind. “Am I doing thisbecause I’m upset?” “Is this how I really want to handle my situation?” “Whathas ice cream got to do with getting the stress out of my life?” These are thekinds of ideas that liberate you from any craving. You see what you’re doing,and that gives you space to back away. Seeing is never far away when somebody istruly aware; blindness is never very far away when someone isn’t.Once a craving has dug a deep enough groove, it’s much more difficult to changeyour habitual response. (We all know what it’s like to take the first bite of atempting food and blank out until the last bite is gone—the body has taken overcompletely.) A psychologist would use the word conditioning to describe such awell-worn groove. Old conditioning keeps us from being free, because time andagain we fall into patterns that run too deep, while our new behavior, the onewe wish we could have, has no groove to follow at all. This state of beingtrapped in old conditioning creates its own kind of awareness.WHEN YOUR AWARENESS IS CONDITIONEDYou can’t find your center, so impulses pull you this way and that.You aren’t familiar with a place of peace and silence, so there’s constantrestlessness.Conflicting impulses fight against each other.Local disturbances disturb and distract you.You see the world from a contracted perspective.Your inner world is totally disorganized.We all know at some level that being conditioned limits our lives and standsbetween us and fulfillment. Consider how the term “unconditional love” came tobe so popular. When people seek unconditional love, they want to transcend loveas it usually exists, which is highly conditioned: it’s restless, unreliable,easily distracted and disturbed; at any moment this love can fall prey tojealousy, anger, boredom, betrayal, or simply a whim if a more attractive loveobject comes along. Yet we have an intuitive sense that love without conditionsmust exist—traditionally God’s love fulfilled this wish, but now the search ismore profane. We want to love a real person unconditionally, and be lovedunconditionally in return.This desire isn’t realistic if you look at human nature under ordinarycircumstances. It becomes realistic if awareness can shift out of its oldconditioning, however. If you can reach a state of unconditional love foryourself, you will be in a completely new energy state, and you find yourselffree to love anew. Awareness has the power to deliver unconditional love, and itdoes so through the same means as putting an end to a craving for ice cream: yousee how to transcend your old, unhealthy conditioning.THREE WAYS TO END CONDITIONINGOnce you understand how conditioned you actually are, the desire arises toregain control of your life, because every conditioned habit is like anautomatic switch that sets a fixed behavior. What sets these switches in place?Time and repetition. Your body adapts to things you do over and over again. It’smuch easier to set an energy pattern than a physical one, and once set, it’smuch harder to change.For instance, if you take up running on a regular basis, you can train anout-of-shape body to run a twenty-six-mile marathon in three to five months.With time and repetition, meaning regular runs of two to ten miles, your bodyadapts to the agenda you’ve set for it. You’ve deliberately conditioned it. Onthe day after the marathon, if you stop running, your body will be out of shapewithin a year, usually within half that time. (One research study foundsomething even more drastic: if college athletes in the peak of fitness are putflat on their backs in a hospital bed and not allowed to get up, within twoweeks their muscles lose ten years of training.)Compare those factors with mental conditioning. A single traumatic event (asevere auto accident, being the victim of a crime, living through a terroristattack) alters your awareness immediately, much faster than physicalconditioning. Once imprinted, the mental trauma keeps repeating itselfobsessively—images, thoughts, and feelings roam through your mindinvoluntarily—and those patterns become difficult to change. The most dramaticexample is drug addiction, because the mental component that drives someone touse drugs remains in place even when the body has been cleared of toxicsubstances.There are three ways to break down old conditioning: reflection, contemplation,and meditation. Their power increases in that order. We all tend to use thosewords interchangeably, but they have separate implications.Reflection—taking a second look at old habits, beliefs, and assumptions.Contemplation—focusing on a thought or image until it expands as far as it can.Meditation—finding the level of the mind that isn’t conditioned.We aren’t interested—not for the moment, at least—in the spiritual significanceof these practices. Our primary concern is whether they are effective in movingstuck energy and changing old conditioning. It turns out that their efficacy isvery different, and contrary to what you might expect, the more focused you areabout attacking a specific energy pattern, the less likely you are to succeed ingetting rid of it.Reflection involves standing back and taking a look at yourself, as if in amirror. It’s the same as having second thoughts or reconsidering a past momentin a more settled state. Let’s say you have a sudden impulse (to tell off yourboss, walk out on your spouse, ask a beautiful woman for a date), but thenreflect on whether it’s really a good idea or not. Reflection calls uponexperience; it lends caution to snap judgments. As a way of breaking down oldconditioning, reflection works if you can see something in a new light.Carla, a woman in her early forties, recounted such an experience. “I grew up inthe rural South, and although my family were all nice people, they had a set offixed beliefs that everyone seemed to absorb from the air or the drinking water.My parents didn’t consider themselves prejudiced, yet they had only whitefriends. They didn’t strike up chats with a waiter or store clerk except whiteones. The small talk I grew up around was knee-jerk conservative, and from anearly age I chafed at hearing it.“By the time I went to college I was the outsider. I worked for liberalcandidates whenever I could. I had black friends, and I read the New York Timesa lot more frequently than the Bible. If I came home with a new cause, myparents nodded politely, and waited until somebody could change the subject.“One day, years later, something hit me, a kind of epiphany. If I was alwaysdoing and thinking the opposite of what my parents did and said, they stilldefined me. Being the opposite of bad doesn’t make you good. It just makes youthe mirror image of bad.“As I examined my beliefs, which I had always been proud of, I realized thateach one was derived in the same reflexive way: I looked at people I thoughtwere bad, and I made sure my beliefs didn’t match theirs in any way; I looked atpeople I thought were good, and I made sure my beliefs were exactly the same astheirs. Nothing I believed in was original. If being closed-minded is the sameas not thinking for yourself, that was me.”So what is an open mind? I asked.“It can’t be a set of beliefs, no matter how good you think they are,” saidCarla. “Most people hold their beliefs in order to feel good about themselves,not seeing the trap they’re falling into. The most liberating idea eventuallyturns into a shackle if you don’t keep changing.”This example points to the pros and cons of reflection. Pro: If you lookhonestly at your beliefs and assumptions, you can head off conditioning beforeit becomes too deep. Your mind won’t get stuck as easily. You will learn how tobe more flexible. Healthy doubt will keep you from falling into conformity. Youopen the way to become an original person, not simply a carbon copy of a socialtype. Con: Reflection tends to remain mental. It doesn’t move much energy in thebody. As a result, its power to erase the imprints of conditioning usually isn’tvery strong. You wind up seeing what’s wrong without going deep enough to createchange. Reflection is also slow and time-consuming. It can even work againstchange by creating uncertainty and hesitancy—a problem begins to seem toocomplex and shaded. If reflection turns into just another habit, you don’t actwith any kind of spontaneity. By adulthood, people are supposed to lose therecklessness of youth, and learning to reflect on your own actions is a largepart of that. On the other hand, I don’t think I’ve met many reflective peoplewho have changed their hidden stuck-energy patterns. They do a better job thanaverage of not falling into thoughtless habits, but when their bodies reallyneed change and not just their assumptions, reflection does them little good.Contemplation involves holding one thing in the mind and letting it unfold. Areligious person may contemplate God’s mercy, for example. To do that, he letshis mind roam over the topic, seeing images of mercy, feeling what it’s like tobe merciful or receive mercy. (You may notice a connection to what I’m callingsubtle action. They are alike, but subtle action has a specific intent behindit, while contemplation doesn’t—it’s more a way of letting go.) If the processis allowed to really open up, a contemplative mind can reach very deep. The maineffect is to train your mind not to focus on single, isolated details. That kindof sharp focus almost always leads to a struggle with the thing you want to getrid of, and as we saw, struggle only makes conditioning worse by repeating thesame conflict over and over.Contemplation is a technique that need not be tied to religion or spiritualpractices, venerable as that tradition is. You can take any bad habit andcontemplate what it’s all about, persisting until answers begin to come. Thoseanswers will move your energy in new directions.Tyrone is a high-energy type who threw himself into online trading in high-riskinvestments. “By my mid-twenties I envied floor traders on Wall Street, the guysyou see on TV, yelling, shoving, and going crazy during big market moves,” hesays. “I had no chance of moving to New York and breaking into that, but tenyears ago the Internet offered everyone a chance to be a gunslinger. I jumpedin, and pretty soon every free moment had me glued to the screen.“I didn’t have much money, so I bought on margin, which allowed me to makebigger and bigger bets. My risk-taking got bolder, and right away my wins werebigger than my losses. Before I knew it, my account was in six figures, and thetop was nowhere in sight. I felt elated. Every morning I couldn’t wait for themarkets to open.”“Would you call yourself addicted?” I asked.Tyrone shook his head. “The thought never crossed my mind. The day came when Iwas only a few trades away from making a million dollars. That was my benchmark.Once I crossed the million-dollar line, my life would change completely. That’swhat I told myself.”“But you never did cross it,” I said.“I was a beginner, and I had only experienced success. So when my luck turnedsour, I went into shock. I lost all my money, and all the money friends hadgiven me to invest when they learned what a genius I was. I was shattered. Guiltand self-recrimination kept me up at night. Some people commiserated. They toldme that trading isn’t for everyone; it takes toughness and nerves of steel.”“Which only made you feel more inadequate,” I commented. “What happened afterthat?”“I got back on my feet, slowly, and with fewer friends. But one friend, who wasquite a bit older, told me something important. ‘Don’t think about the money,’he said. ‘Think about what money means to you.’ I got into trouble, he said, bynot knowing that in the first place.“I’m not sure why I took his advice, but I sat and really looked at it. Two bigthings came up right away: I liked the thrill of gambling, so money meantadrenaline; I felt like I wasn’t good enough, so money meant self-respect. Atfirst, both those things were all right with me. So what if I like to gamble?Why not earn a little self-respect? If I hadn’t been feeling so terrible, Imight have let it go at that. But I kept going, and one day I felt in my bodyexactly what the sensations of being on a gambling high were like. Theadrenaline rush was there, my heart pounding and everything, but what I hadn’tnoticed was my anxiety. What I had been calling a thrill contained a lot offear, worry, and tension.“As for self-respect, how could I claim that it had improved? I squirreledmyself away in front of a glowing computer screen. My mood yo-yoed up and downwith every tick of the market. I felt like a hero when I was winning and a loserwhen I was down. Don’t think it was easy for me to see all this. I was drinkingantacids out of the bottle for two months after I crashed. But I let all the badtimes flow through me again, and whenever they came back, I’d feel them ratherthan push them down again. The only way out is through, right? Eventually I wasat peace. I could admit that I was an out-of-control gambler, an addict who hadignored everything but his compulsion. I expanded out of that suffocatingstraitjacket. I started to breathe the same air as normal people.”“Do you consider yourself recovered?” I asked.He looked thoughtful. “I’m not sure. I’m relieved that I broke my old habit. Idon’t have a jones for trading anymore. And I’m relieved that I’m not tearingmyself up with stress anymore. On the other hand, it’s been almost ten years,and I still relive the torture of losing all that money. I’ve turned my lifearound, but those impressions take a long, long time to fade.”Tyrone’s story points out the pros and cons of contemplation.On the positive side, contemplation can break the boundaries of narrow thinking.It can uncover hidden issues and allow them enough space so that their distortedenergy is released. The process of letting go requires no struggle. You can faceyour demons at your own pace. If you keep focusing on your weak spots withdiligence, they will be healed by an expanded sense of self—you will seeyourself as bigger than your problems, and that awareness has a tremendoushealing power.On the downside, letting go isn’t reliable. If your mind is confused andconflicted, it may be too restless and easily distracted to focus. Your focusmay be too weak to actually move any large amount of stuck energy. Lookingclosely at your problems can create discouragement and depression. You may hatewhat you see and give yourself reasons to stop looking.Speaking personally, I think contemplation is more powerful than reflection. Itgets into emotions and sensations, while reflection tends to remainintellectual. Some hands-on healers like to say, “The issues are in thetissues,” meaning that you must get to the level in the body where the deepestimpressions are lodged. Looking and letting go brings results. On the otherhand, I don’t know many people who have the patience to return to the same focusday after day without getting bored and worn out.Meditation involves the search for a level of awareness that isn’t conditioned.It takes the mind in its restless, confused state and leads it to a higher statethat is clear and steady. This process is known as transcending. Countlesstraditions of meditation originated in India and China before spreadingthroughout the East, but they have in common the same notion of how realityworks. Reality flows from finer to grosser states. First there is silence andstillness, then there are subtle objects of the mind (thoughts, emotions,sensations), and finally there are solid objects and the material world itself.When you meditate, you move back upstream, so to speak, going beyond thematerial world, then beyond the mind that’s full of thoughts, emotions, andsensations, finally to arrive at stillness and silence.This journey is more than a subjective experience, however. Sitting in silencewould be no better than sitting in a whirl of thoughts, if both were merelysubjective states. In actuality, you transcend from one level of reality toanother. Each level contains different kinds of energy, and as you bring inhigher energy, your body adapts. Studies of long-term meditators show thatmarkers for health improve, such as reduced blood pressure and stress hormones.But the body can adapt in far more profound ways.If you touch the right trigger point in your mind, a longstanding distortion inyour energy can instantly disappear. Unlike reflection and contemplation, thepurpose of meditation is to find the switch that will turn off the automaticbehavior created by your old conditioning. I don’t mean that lightning strikesall at once. Meditating is a process; it takes time. But the process can cause asudden change, the way digging a well goes through layer after layer of dirtuntil suddenly you hit clear, flowing water. I’ve met many people to whom thishas happened, including a man named David, now well past sixty.“I grew up loathing my father. The full realization of my hatred came veryearly, when I was nine. It was Christmas, and I was assigned to find the badbulb when a string of lights went out. As I unscrewed each bulb to test it, Iaccidentally slipped my finger in a socket. I got a jolt of electricity thatthrew me backwards. At the same time, the whole tree lit up for a second becausemy finger completed the circuit.“As I lay on the floor in shock, I saw that my father was laughing. The sight ofthe tree lighting up was comical to him, like something out of a cartoon. Atthat instant I suddenly understood that he couldn’t care less about me. I burstout crying, and my father frowned. ‘You’re the oldest boy in the family,’ hesaid. ‘I expect you to start acting like a man.’“Decades later I happened to visit a psychic, and she immediately told me that Ihad this old energy of hatred inside me. She said, ‘Visualize your relationshipwith your father. Don’t think about it intellectually. Relax and tell me whatimage comes to mind.’“I closed my eyes, and I saw two knights covered from head to foot in armor.They were whacking away at each other with broadswords, relentlessly andbrutally, but neither one fell down. They just kept battling on. The psychicsaid that this was my father and me, and that I’d never get rid of my hatreduntil I found a way for that image to dissolve.”“Did you take her seriously?” I asked.David gave a wry smile. “I couldn’t get past the feeling that my father was aselfish, heartless bastard. He had hurt every member of my family one way oranother. Years went by. Eventually, a girlfriend talked me into meditating. Iliked it. After each session I felt more relaxed and quiet inside. Then one daymy father called without warning—he was almost seventy at the time—and I noticedthat the sound of his voice didn’t make me bristle.“The next day I did my morning meditation, after which I lay on the floor torest, which is what I had been taught to do. The teacher told me that it’snecessary to rest because the mind needs time to absorb the deeper awareness ithas been exposed to. Unexpectedly I saw the image of two knights again, stillhacking away with their broadswords. This time a small voice asked me if I sawany reason to stop fighting. Only one came to mind: I was getting exhausted.This fight had gotten nowhere. My damn sword was heavy! Believe it or not, thatdid it.”“What do you mean?” I asked.“The energy of hatred vanished. Even though I felt totally justified in loathingmy father, I let go. Or maybe it let go of me. Within a month I had only thevaguest recollection of my old hatred. Within a year I went back home andactually smiled at him. For the first time since I was a boy, I could be aroundmy father comfortably. Sometimes, to my amazement, I feel real affection forhim. I was healed in a way I never expected to be.”David’s story points out the pros and cons of meditation.On the plus side, meditation goes to the source. It takes you away from thelevel of the problem to the level of the solution, which is stuck energy. Itreleases you from the obligation to dwell in negative thoughts and fight againstbad impulses. It is effortless, silently dissolving old conditioning. Theoverall effect is general—instead of focusing on one issue at a time, meditationcarries the whole mind beyond problems.There are no innate drawbacks to meditation, but there are pitfalls. The wrongkind of meditation simply doesn’t work. It may bring on a hint oftranscendence—a temporary sense of peace and calm, passing moments of silence, asettled contentment. If you are depressed, meditation may cause you to dwell toomuch inside yourself. The same is true for people who are introverted: they mayretreat inside without reaching a deeper level of awareness. The test of whethermeditation is working comes down to energy: if you aren’t moving old, stuckenergy, your meditation isn’t effective.The benefits of meditation rest on the ability of awareness to change reality.Now we know why that’s valid. The chain of events that ends in the body beginsin consciousness. By moving stuck energy, the free flow of consciousness isrestored, which is enough to bring the body back into a healthy state. Remember,even though we divide problems into the categories of physical, mental,emotional, and so on, the chain of events is the same. To say that someone likeDavid held his anger at the emotional level would be too limited. He held it atthe energy level, and his body had adapted, from the brain with its angrythoughts to the cells in his body that responded to the brain’s signals. Betweenthem, awareness and energy are the most powerful healers in existence. With thatin mind, here are three simple meditations that can set you on the path ofhealing: 1. Meditation on the breath. Sit quietly with your eyes closed. Gently put your attention on the tip of your nose. Breathe in and out normally, and as you do, feel the air flowing through your nostrils. Envision your breath as a faint cloud of pale golden light going in and out of your nose. Feel the soft energy being carried by your breath. Let it relax you and still your mind, but easily, without forcing anything to happen. The process will take care of itself. To help keep your attention from wandering, you can add the sound “hoo” as you exhale. 2. Meditation on the heart. Sitting quietly with your eyes closed, rest your attention on your heart. You don’t need to be anatomically precise. Simply find a place in the center of your chest where your attention can rest easily. As you breathe in and out naturally, keep your attention there. Allow any feelings and sensations to arise and pass. If your attention wanders, gently bring it back to rest on your heart. 3. Meditation on the light. Sitting quietly with your eyes closed, envision a soft mixture of white light tinged with gold flowing through your body. See the light come up from your feet and fill your torso. Watch it continue up through your chest and head until it comes out through the crown of your head and goes straight up until it disappears from view. Now envision the same sparkling light descending back down, first entering through the crown of your head. It reverses the upward path from head to chest to torso, exiting the body through the soles of your feet. Once you have mastered this visualization, time it with your breathing. On the inhale, slowly draw the light up from your feet and out the top of your head. On the exhale, draw the light in through the top of your head and out through your feet. Don’t force the rhythm. Breathe slowly and naturally in a relaxed state as you perform the visualization.[images/Chop_9780307452344_epub_L05_r1.jpg]IN YOUR LIFE: A SOFTER KIND OF AWARENESSCertain eye exercises can teach people how to relax their vision through “softfocus.” Because unhealthy energy is hard, rigid, and stuck, it’s helpful tolearn how to have “soft awareness.” I don’t mean a woozy blissfulness, but astate of mind that is open, relaxed, and receptive. In that state, you giveyourself the best opportunity to flow with life instead of putting up barriersand resistance.As regards eyesight, hard focus is specific and particular. You take aim, so tospeak, and keep an object in your sights. Soft focus widens the field of vision.Instead of isolating one tree, you see the whole forest. I don’t know if thisapproach will actually improve a person’s eyesight, but it is very beneficialwhen applied to the mind. A tightly focused mind becomes narrow and linear if itcan’t expand. We are all guilty of following narrow mental grooves, like a trainconfined to one narrow set of tracks. We experience our minds one thought at atime. What this habit leads us to miss is true understanding, because your mindis much more than one event after another.It is even more futile to try to control your mind one thought at a time. Nomatter how many years you spend judging your thoughts—rejecting the ones youdislike, and censoring those of which you disapprove—your mind will keepbringing them around. In fact, bad thoughts are more likely to return, as everyguilty person knows.Soft focus sees the mind as a whole. You view thinking as if on a wide screen,accepting that any possible thought can come along. Instead of being a problem,the endless flow of thought becomes the fertile ground of change. The floodcannot be tamed. Nor should we want it to be, because the glory of the mind isthat it draws from a thousand springs. Every mental event is temporary: itexists in the moment and then vanishes. Yet, strangely enough, the presentmoment is connected to eternity, because the present is the only time that isconstantly renewed.Do you see your mind through soft or hard focus? Let me give you some practicaldistinctions:HARD FOCUSYour mind is overworked. It’s exhausting keeping up with it.You feel a strong aversion to guilty and shameful thoughts.You push bad memories down out of sight.You wish you had more control over your thoughts.You berate yourself when you make a mistake. You call yourself an idiot orstupid.You struggle between good and bad impulses.Images you don’t want to see pop up anyway, as if on their own.A strong voice tells you if you are being good or bad.You find yourself being vigilant in case something unexpected should happen.You know God sees you, but you try not to think about that.As you can see, hard focus stands for more than a habit of mind. It’s thequality of attention you are paying to yourself and the world. The act of seeingis never neutral. If your attention is wary, hypervigilant to every kind ofrisk, worried about what can go wrong, your quality of attention is unhealthy.(I’m reminded of the woman who visited her doctor twice a year, every timesuspecting that she had cancer. Her checkups were good for fifty years, butfinally the day came when her tests revealed that she did have cancer. “See?”she said self-righteously “I told you so!” Doctors exchange this story toreinforce the point that patients are stubborn, but I can’t help thinking aboutwhat kind of life the woman had for fifty years until her worst nightmarefinally came true.)A different quality of attention is developed by soft focus.SOFT FOCUSYour mind is calm and not overworked. You enjoy being in its presence.You don’t feel haunted by guilty and shameful thoughts.Your memories fill out your experience; you accept them for what they are.You don’t try to control your thoughts. The more freely they come, the better.When you make a mistake, you accept it and quickly move on. Not every idea canbe perfect or brilliant, and mistakes are often the best teachers.There’s a contrast between good and bad impulses, but you take both in stride.Sometimes you take secret delight in so-called bad thoughts, knowing thatthey’re just another part of your experience.Unpleasant mental images don’t make you afraid or disgusted. You can adapt tothe mind’s darker side.You aren’t plagued by a judgmental voice telling you that you’re bad orunworthy.You aren’t braced for the next disaster around the corner.If God is looking down on you, he approves of what he sees.Each item here translates into a new way of approaching your life. Having lookedover this list, you may be surprised at how many aspects of hard focus you haveaccepted as positive. I hope they don’t look that way anymore. Once you see thatsoft focus is a healthier way to relate to your mind, it’s much easier to bringpositive change into your life. After all, what you see you can heal; what youdon’t see will remain the same.Habits of mind are elusive. At the moment we cannot prove that hard focusdirectly injures the body while soft focus heals it. But because the body isonly energy, and because energy is altered by awareness, the value of havinghealthy awareness speaks for itself. We attach positive value to things for allkinds of reasons, influenced from birth by parents, friends, school, peergroups, and society in general. For good or ill, these influences narrow themind by fixing its beliefs and assumptions. If you were brought up in a familyenvironment where rigid distinctions were made between right and wrong, wherebeing judgmental came naturally, and where perfection, discipline, andself-control were preached, any and all of these influences will have becomeinternalized over time. Children have no resistance to having their mindsshaped. At the social level, we are so accustomed to viewing the world in termsof heroes and villains, us-versus-them, winners and losers, that these harshdivisions become habits of mind. It takes a conscious shift to move from hard tosoft focus, and yet that is a powerful way to dissolve the energy that gluesrigid habits in place."},{"pageContent":"BREAKTHROUGH #4YOU CAN IMPROVE YOUR GENESA breakthrough sometimes comes from seeing a simple truth hidden behind a tangleof complications. Genes are the most complicated thing about the body. Yet thereis a simple truth behind them, which is this: you can change your genes, andtherefore you can improve them. You are talking to your genes when you do simplethings like eating and moving. That’s why a recent study showed that people whoalter their lifestyle significantly—by eating better, exercising more, andpracticing meditation—caused changes affecting perhaps five hundred genes. Thechanges supported their new lifestyle, and they started within a few weeks. Butwe should have suspected all along that genes don’t sit in a remote castle assilent observers. Even a strong emotion may be enough to alter a gene, becauseemotions require a shift in brain chemistry—brain cells secrete new chemicalsfor sadness or happiness, confidence or shyness, when their genes tell them to.The most seemingly stable part of the body turns out to be amazingly fluid andflexible. The code of life is a streaming message that never ends.Biologists used to claim—and many people think they still do—that we are bornwith a set of genes that are fixed and unchangeable. But that’s like saying wewere born with a pair of hands that are unchangeable. In fact, if you are aconcert pianist and you have a twin who became a bricklayer, your two handswould be completely different in appearance, flexibility, and skill. Thosedifferences would be reflected in different brain patterns. Your motor cortexwill be imprinted with piano playing, your twin’s with bricklaying. Identicaltwins are born with the same set of genes, yet if you take their genetic profileat age seventy, their genes are totally different.What has changed is a realization that genes only affect you if they areswitched on; they have no effect if they are switched off. Twins are only bornidentical; they go through life having unique experiences, and those experiencesswitch some genes on and others off. Everyone’s body is the end product of alifelong process that turns switches on or off. Along the way, threepossibilities can occur:A gene may turn on and off on a fixed schedule.A gene may turn on and off depending on the person’s behavior and experiences.A gene may turn on and off as a combination of the above.Two out of the three possibilities leave room for you to choose what your geneswill do. This is good news, because for decades we’ve been told that genes arefixed. They give us our inherited traits and determine what happens in ourbodies. Almost no room was left for choice. Yet you don’t have to be a twin towind up at age seventy with a unique genetic profile—it happens to all of us.You are working with the same three possibilities: your behavior won’t affectcertain genes, it will have a strong effect on others, and for the vast majorityof your genes, nature and nurture both play a crucial role.When people think about genes, the example of blue eyes always comes to mind. Ifyou have inherited a specific gene, your eyes will be blue, and if you have adifferent gene, your eyes will be brown, green, or hazel. It turns out that thisis the exception, however, not the rule. There is no single gene that determinesheight, for example. The latest research shows that more than twenty genes areinvolved in how tall a person will grow (some experts raise the number to onehundred genes), and even when they are analyzed, those genes can’t tell you ifone baby will grow up to be short and another tall. There is a generalcorrelation that a mother’s height influences her son’s, and a father’s heightinfluences his daughter’s, but we all know children who are drastically talleror shorter than their parents. When two short parents give rise to a very tallchild, nobody really can explain why. Scientists can’t even decide if genesaccount for 90 percent of height—the old conclusion—or as little as 30 percent.Outside factors aren’t reliable predictors, either. We might assume that abetter diet makes people taller, but the younger generation in the Philippinesis growing shorter despite better economic conditions. We might assume that atall ethnic group would keep growing taller, but the Plains Indians were amongthe tallest people on earth when Europeans settled America, and now they aren’t.Americans were taller than their European counterparts throughout the eighteenthand nineteenth centuries, but now the Dutch have surpassed them, along withseveral Scandinavian nations. The pace of change can be fast or slow. The Dutchtook 150 years to become the tallest people in the world; the Japanese havejumped up in height just since World War II. (In the animal kingdom, there wereonly forty breeds of dogs in the world before a craze for developing new breedsswept through Victorian England. Since 1870, that number has jumped to fourhundred.)A few decades ago, medical researchers found that diabetes and sickle-cellanemia ran in families through inherited genes, and wondered if perhaps the samewas true for other traits, like depression and schizophrenia, that also seem torun in families. Hope grew that eventually all disorders, physical and mental,could be detected and cured at the genetic level. Parents could find comfort inthe knowledge that their child-rearing skills didn’t create mental disturbancesin their offspring. People suffering from depression, anxiety, obesity, and ahost of other complaints could stop worrying that their choices had created theproblem. Genes were at fault, and genes would come to the rescue.If mapping human DNA was the Holy Grail ten years ago, now there are a thousandholy grails—attributing a specific gene to every specific disorder. News storiesflood the media about a so-called fat gene, or a gene for Alzheimer’s, andperhaps even a gene that makes people believe in God, the “faith gene.” All ofthese announcements wound up bearing little fruit. The single-gene theory isquickly being abandoned, although the public continues to believe in it. Inrecent years, moreover, the genomes of thousands of individuals have beenmapped, and to the shock of researchers, there turn out to be at least 3 milliondifferences in the genetic makeup of any two people (a huge number consideringthat we possess only 20,000 to 30,000 genes, far less than anyone supposed).Genes cannot govern all the other factors that make you who you are. A genedidn’t give you a love for gardening, a mania for collecting postage stamps, ataste for Bach, or an image of the person you would fall in love with. Whatwould happen, though, if we stopped looking at DNA physically? Let’s bring genesinto the field of awareness and see how they respond. DNA is a memory bankstoring every experience from the past that makes us human. Instead of lettingthose memories use you, you can learn to use them.Your DNA is no more physical than other parts of your body; it is made ofenergy, and you can change its energy patterns through a change of awareness.You were born with some predispositions that will determine how your body turnsout, yet as you inject your own desires, habits, and intentions, a fixed traitwill turn out to be very malleable—a mere wisp of desire is enough to affectDNA. How ironic that the two things that medicine thought were fixed, the brainand DNA, turn out to be the keys for reinventing the body.MARIEL’S STORYThe big question isn’t whether you can improve your genes, but how far you cantake the process. Genes stand in the way of change only because we accept thatthey have power over us. Yet some people find a way to overcome their genes.Mariel, now in her thirties, was born with a congenital eye defect that couldn’tbe corrected with surgery. “I grew up knowing that my sight would fade away as Igrew older,” she said. “As the years went by, I faced the challenge ofconstantly adjusting to new limitations. By the time I was out of college andgoing to graduate school, small print was very hard to read.”One day Mariel was in the library and found herself unable to read the cardcatalog. “They had just switched to a microfiche system, and trying to make outthe tiny print on the screen was very frustrating. On an impulse, I got up andwalked into the stacks. I headed to the general area where the book I wanted waslocated. When I got there, I intended to ask for help, but since no one wasaround, I reached up at random and grabbed a volume. It turned out to be thevery one I wanted.”At the time Mariel saw this as a coincidence, albeit an extraordinary one. Butover time a pattern began to emerge. “I found that I could see without using myeyes. I was able to recover lost objects like keys or a wallet without having tosearch high and low. At first I assumed that I was just retracing my steps, theway most people do when they lose something. But one day I came home from arestaurant to find that my checkbook was gone. Before I could even try to recallwhere I left it, a visual image flashed in my mind, showing a checkbook lying ina very specific place in the restaurant parking lot. It had fallen out of mypurse when I pulled out my car keys. So I went back to the retaurant, and thecheckbook was lying exactly where I’d envisioned it.”Mariel came to rely on her newfound second sight. “If I’m writing a paper andneed a specific citation, all I need to do is open the reference book and thepages will fall open to the passage I want. This doesn’t happen every singletime, but it seems to work just when I need it most.”“What’s your explanation for this?” I asked.“It was tempting to think there was a special connection between me and God,”she said. “Then I ran across an article by a neurologist about sighted peoplewho suddenly become blind, usually in an accident. Some people simply resignthemselves to being sightless, but others adapt in amazing ways. One blind mantook up roofing. He specialized in extremely complex roofs with multiple gablesand steep pitches. He preferred working at night, much to the consternation ofthe neighbors. These were roofs that even a sighted person would be wary ofclimbing on in full daylight. Another person I recall developed a skill fordesigning intricate gearboxes whose complex workings he saw only in his mind’seye. He hadn’t had this skill before a sudden leak of acid sprayed him in theeyes and blinded him. Only then did he discover that he possessed thisremarkable ability.”Everyone’s genes hide secret potential. One need only turn to the work of thelate Dr. Paul Bach-y-Rita from Mexico, who attracted general scorn thirty yearsago when he suggested that the brain was capable of “sensory substitution.” Thatis, a blind person could learn to “see,” for example, by substituting the senseof touch for the sense of sight. Braille already gave us a clue that somethingakin to this audacious idea was possible, but Dr. Bach-y-Rita went much further.By the time of his death at age seventy-two, he had developed a mechanism knownas a “Brain Port,” a small paddle that fits on the tongue. Using a grid of sixhundred electrical points attached to a camera, the Brain Port can deliver apicture to the tongue of whatever the camera sees. This picture consists ofelectrical impulses conducted to sensory receptors for touch, yet after somepractice, the blind person’s brain actually “sees” the image.The evidence is not just anecdotal. MRIs have shown that the visual cortex of ablind person lights up when signals are sent to the tongue. In a recent reporton public television, one could watch blind patients throwing a tennis ball intoa trash can from twenty feet and walking a curving path without going out ofbounds. But sensory substitution goes further. A woman who had lost her sense ofbalance as a side effect of an antibiotic could not be helped by drugs orsurgery because the entire vestibular labyrinth in her inner ear had beenrendered completely useless. Yet by training with the Brain Port, which told hertongue when she was upright and when she wasn’t, she regained her balance.Something even more remarkable followed. When the woman took off the Brain Portdevice that enabled her to balance herself, she didn’t immediately lose herbalance again. One hour of training held good for about an hour after it ended.As she progressed, a day of training held good for a day afterward. Eventually,to the amazement of the experimenters, she could walk and ride a bicycle withoutwearing the Brain Port device at all.The brain’s vestibular system is extremely complex, and yet much or all of itfound a substitute elsewhere, in a region of the brain that formerly wasn’tdevoted to equilibrium at all. Not only has Dr. Bach-y-Rita proved his pointthat the brain is more flexible than commonly supposed, but his researchsuggests that the brain is much more creative as well. How does an organ that ismostly water, governed entirely by electrochemical impulses, know that a personneeds a new way of sensing, one that so far as we know isn’t necessary to humanevolution?SEEDS OF CHANGEThe brain’s hidden potential comes down to the gene’s hidden potential. A braincell can’t make a new move unless its DNA sends out new chemical signals.Instead of getting tangled up in organic chemistry, which will never transcendthe physical level anyway, you need to realize that you are talking to yourgenes all the time. For every trait that is fixed, such as eye, hair, and skincolor, myriad genes are weaving a complex pattern of response to the followingfactors: * How you think. * How you feel. * How you act. * What you believe. * What you expect. * The threats you fear. * The objects of your desires. * The lifestyle decisions you make. * The relationships you focus on. * Your immediate environment. * Your habits and preferences.At the most basic level, lifestyle choices have genetic consequences. In thewellness movement, approaches such as vegetarian diets, Hatha Yoga, meditation,and psychosocial support have long been seen as good preventive measures. Now itseems that adopting these approaches may stop or even reverse seriousillness—heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, prostate cancer, obesity,high cholesterol, and other chronic conditions show promising signs in thisarea. Only recently has research gone to the genetic level of explaining thesebeneficial changes. Hundreds of genes, it has been found, may be changing theirexpression in as little as a few months after patients change their lifestyle ina positive direction. Genes associated with cancer, heart disease, andinflammation were down-regulated or “turned off,” whereas protective genes wereup-regulated or “turned on.”At this moment you are making all kinds of choices that weave together thequirky, unpredictable, and creative patterns of your life. Do your genes care?As it happens, they do, very much. It’s been shown that death rates risesignificantly after Christmas, for example, and the same spike occurs aftermortally ill people have a birthday. The implication is that when someone isdying, she can postpone her time of death until after a day she wants to live tosee. (I know of a man slowly dying from brain cancer who passed away when aLakota Sioux medicine man was brought into his sickroom and performed a ceremonyto release the spirit from the body so that it could reach the afterlife.)It’s as if having a desire is enough to tell your body what to do. Is thatenough with genes as well? Influencing a gene used to be considered impossible,but the situation is rapidly changing. Genetic researchers working with micefound that baby mice that were well mothered turned into healthier specimensthan baby mice who were badly mothered. A mouse who’s a good mother licks andcleans her offspring almost all the time and stays physically close to them. Abad mouse mother is erratic about grooming her offspring, and wanders away fromthem. As a result, her offspring grow up to be more susceptible to stress. Theyare more easily frightened and also show less curiosity about the world, andless willingness to explore it.In itself, this finding wasn’t dramatic. It had been shown long ago that babymonkeys who were not allowed to cling to their mothers and be nurtured by themgrew up emotionally disturbed (you may remember the poignant photos of forlorninfant rhesus monkeys clinging to a wire-mesh imitation of a mother monkey). Theradical part of the mouse experiment came when it was discovered that mice whoexperienced bad mothering turned into bad mothers themselves. They neglected togroom their own offspring enough, and tended to wander away. In other words, thebaby mice of bad mothers didn’t acquire new genes, yet they did acquire a newbehavior. Suddenly that first early human who decided to stand upright to viewthe far horizon may not be tied to genes. He may have passed on his new behaviorto his children without waiting millennia for a new mutation. But how?The answer lies at an obscure cellular level known as epigenes. Every strand ofDNA is wrapped in a buffer of complex proteins—the epigene—that somehow triggera gene to turn on or off. When the epigene is affected by something you do orfeel, it won’t create new DNA—your genetic inheritance remains the same as atbirth. But its behavior can change drastically. So, when a bad mouse motherwarps the normal development of her baby, what matters is that the baby’s DNA isactivated to start behaving badly, eventually passing on the same bad behaviorto future generations. I’ve given a negative example, yet many positiveimplications open up if we can learn to switch genes on and off. Gene therapyhas been a failure in treating cancer, for example, but epigenes may come to therescue. Because gene therapy tries to replace or change the genes you were bornwith, the body rebels, producing many undesirable side effects. On the otherhand, if the epigene can tell your DNA to prevent a tumor from growing, or tostop the tumor after it starts, then cancer could be defeated simply by asking acell to behave differently.If switching a gene on and off is the most natural way to create change, how dowe gain control over the switch? Lifestyle changes are a start, but perhaps wepossess more direct control, only the switch is hidden. To stay with cancer,there are thousands of documented cases in which an advanced malignancy hasdisappeared without treatment. These spontaneous remissions, as they are known,have created a vast mythology. All it takes is a rumor that some herb, fruitconcoction, gem or color therapy, religious ritual, prayer, or miraculousintervention has saved a life, and dying cancer patients will desperately pursuethat avenue. Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling was convinced that megadoses ofvitamin C had cured a small group of terminally ill cancer patients. Completeblood transfusions and so-called blood purification are offered illicitly inMexico. Because they are labeled as alternative treatments, a vast array oftherapies exist whose actions remain completely unknown and unproven.What we do know is that in rare cases an x factor can cause tumors to retreatfor no known reason. It can even happen without any treatment at all: acertainty simply dawns on some patients that they will recover, and theircertainty is borne out. That is more in line with traditional faith healing,which attributes cures to an invisible higher power and nothing physical at all.What may unite these wildly disparate approaches (after weeding out the fraudsand false rumors) is the power of awareness to switch on a tumor-suppressinggene.We find ourselves caught in a dilemma. Hope that brings results can’t be calledfalse. On the other hand, reducing all alternative therapies to hope-mongeringwould be unfair. There may be an unpredictable combination of substance andspirit at work, where a patient’s subjective hope and belief enables a therapyto work. The challenge is very basic: How do you effectively take control ofyour genes?TUNING IN, TUNING OUTAll of us cause changes to our genes, but it’s a special skill to do soconsciously. We aren’t tuned in to the level of our bodies that activelyswitches genes on and off. It turns out, however, that this level of awarenessis available. You can’t go there to target one gene directly, but there’s noneed to. You only need to tune in. Tuning your body out is the single greatestharm you can do. Without a clear channel of communication, you can’t expect yourcells to respond to your desires and intentions. “Tuning out” is shorthand forwithdrawing your attention, judging against your body, and ignoring its signals.As with everything else, there are different degrees of tuning out. Depending onhow disconnected you become, your body will send back increasingly severereactions: absence of pleasure, reduced vitality, discomfort, numbness, andpain.Progressing from one stage to another can take years, but a sudden trauma like acar accident or serious illness can decrease body awareness quickly anddramatically. When someone near to us dies and we go into grief, for example,the whole spectrum is there: food no longer tastes good (absence of pleasure);we feel listless and tired (reduced vitality); the body feels heavy and sleepdoesn’t come easily (discomfort); sensations like heat and cold aren’t felt, andfamiliar surroundings seem alien and strange (numbness); random aches in thebody come and go (pain). There are always mental consequences as well, and quiteoften people who feel depressed, numb, and empty inside don’t realize that theyare seriously disconnected from their bodies.Here’s a list of what it typically feels like to tune out. Read the list overand ask yourself how many items apply to you personally.You feel detached from your body and what it’s saying.You find it hard to feel physical pleasure.You compare your body unfavorably to that of other people, or to some ideal ofthe “perfect” body.You feel ugly or unworthy in the body you have.It makes you unhappy to imagine your body shape.Being touched makes you uncomfortable.You tend to misinterpret other people’s physical approach as aggressive or, atthe very least, startling.Bonding through physical intimacy isn’t an option.You feel clumsy and uncoordinated.The only time you liked your body was when you were young.You physically don’t consider yourself feminine enough, or masculine enough.Your body sometimes doesn’t seem to belong to you.These negative attitudes range from mild to severe. Yet your body always senseswhen it is being ignored or judged unfavorably. For most people, ignoring theirbodies has become a habit. Exposing their bodies to undue stress scarcely bringsa second thought. After all, don’t we assume that modern life has turnedstressful, beyond our individual control? If you were really tuned in to yourbody, you’d feel its discomforts before they demanded your attention. Tuning incomes down to becoming more aware. The more aware you are, the more sensitiveyou are to your body, and vice versa.Seen symbolically, all disorders are cases where the body becomes a stranger, anenemy, a failed ally, or a defeated victim. To prevent those metaphors fromturning into reality, you need to offer reassurance to your body that you willcare for it, that you will listen when it speaks.[images/Chop_9780307452344_epub_L05_r1.jpg]IN YOUR LIFE: TUNING INOnce you tune in, your body has an amazing capacity to correct itself. To beginthis process, you need to feel comfortable in your body. There has to be a basicconnection that isn’t blocked by guilt, shame, and discomfort. If you take thefollowing quiz, it will show you where the work of reconnecting starts for youpersonally.ARE YOU AT HOME IN YOUR BODY?The list below covers the most common things that people feel uncomfortable withwhen it comes to their bodies. Mark your comfort level with each item, asfollows:E - EnjoyableD - Don’t mindU - UncomfortableT - Totally avoid__wearing a revealing bathing suit__wearing clothes that fit__looking in a full-length mirror__trying on clothes in a store__dancing__playing team sports__hugging__snuggling__sex with the lights on__being looked at in public__describing how you look physically__being physically flirtatious__thinking about your weight__being casually touched by a friend or acquaintance__hearing others refer to you physically__sitting quietly, particularly in public__attempting physical challenges (hiking, running, climbing flights of stairs,etc.)__being seen nude by your spouse or lover__undressing at the gym__having your picture taken__thinking about being touched physically__buying a bra or other intimate apparelThis isn’t a quiz where you tally up your scores; it’s a worksheet for gettingback in touch with your body. Pick an item that you marked “Uncomfortable,” andwrite a plan for overcoming it. Your plan begins in awareness. Imagine yourselfin the uncomfortable situation. Use a specific image that evokes your discomfortso that you feel it emotionally, and possibly even physically.Be with that energy. Simply by tuning in to it you are taking the first steptoward a new body awareness. Don’t freeze up or get tense. Breathe easily; relaxyour body. If the image has to do with undressing at the gym, see yourselfstanding there, but instead of feeling all eyes on you, create a change. Havepeople look away and pay no attention. Repeat this new scenario several times.See them staring at you, making you embarrassed, then have them turn away. Asyou repeat the process, your energy around this issue will start to dissipate.Now proceed to another aspect of the scene, such as stripping down until you arenaked. Use the same process as before. See yourself in your discomfort, and thenchange the scenario. This time make yourself indifferent to being naked. Maybeyou are chatting with a friend or rubbing lotion on your leg. Maybe someonewalks by without noticing you. Maybe someone comes up to you as you are takingoff your clothes and asks for help with something. The point is to add comfortand ease to the troubling situation. Again, repeat the change, like running amovie scene several times.The ultimate point of this exercise is to get your awareness to shift, allowinga clearer channel of communication with the body. If you are deeply disconnectedfrom your body, this exercise may be too intimidating. If it is, then instead ofbeginning with an item marked “Uncomfortable,” begin with one marked “Don’tmind.” Eventually, you will be able to get through all the steps of tuning in: 1. Freeing up stuck energy through visualization. 2. Stepping into the situation you once felt uncomfortable with. 3. Feeling indifferent in the situation, to the point that you don’t mind it. 4. Feeling completely comfortable. 5. Enjoying and seeking out the once-avoided situation.You won’t be tuned in until you reach the end of the process. Just keepreminding yourself that every stage of healing takes place in awareness. Youwon’t do yourself any good by abruptly buying a bikini or letting someone touchyou intimately before you are mentally and emotionally comfortable. Keepchecking in with the sensations brought up by your body. Be with them; look atthem. If you keep returning in small visits to your discomfort zone, your bodywill begin to respond. Trust it, and don’t push yourself too hard, too fast.In addition, expose yourself to the comforts of physical sensations that you’veignored. Look over the times you marked “Enjoy,” and give your body thenourishment of positive sensations. Remind yourself that your body is thejunction between the visible and invisible worlds. The most pleasurableexperiences—of love, warmth, beauty, bonding, and nurturing—bridge those worlds.They have a component that your body understands and a component that your mindunderstands. Let the two merge into one. Then the process of tuning in iscomplete."},{"pageContent":"BREAKTHROUGH #5TIME ISN’T YOUR ENEMYWhen a breakthrough is powerful enough, it can overturn the natural order ofthings. The whole issue of time fits into this category. Is anything morepowerful than time? It rules the cycle of birth and death. It moves forwardinexorably. It brings aging and decay. The ultimate liberation for your bodywould be to overcome the effects of time. In so doing, you would overcome thebody’s greatest flaw, which is that it breaks down for no better reason,apparently, than the negative effects of the passage of time.In this breakthrough you will see that time isn’t your enemy. We can choose tostop giving in to time as if it ruled our lives. There are signs that this ishappening already. The present generation invented the “new old age,” which isconstantly pushing the biological envelope. In 2005, a Romanian woman namedAdriana Illescu became, at age sixty-seven, the oldest mother on record, usingin-vitro fertilization to give birth to a healthy baby girl. The event createduneasy feelings around the world, but Illescu’s attitude is typical of rapidlychanging beliefs.“I am only sorry that I don’t look like a young woman for my daughter,” shesaid. “I am always amazed when I look in the mirror and see myself. There’s sucha difference between what I feel and what I see.”Illescu has shattered the stereotype of motherhood belonging only to the youngby asking her body to keep up with how young she felt, and in doing so she wasquite consciously pushing the boundaries of aging.“A little sports, a little activity, and an active intellectual life lead thebody to become younger because there are hormones generated in the brain thatmake you feel better,” she told reporters.To set a new agenda for the body, attitudes must shift. In the past, old age wasfeared, and rightly so, because senior citizens were put on the shelf. Whenattitudes shifted, thanks to better health, longer life spans, and shiftingdemographics, people began to expect to be vigorous, alert, and useful wellbeyond the age of sixty-five. A recent poll revealed that more than half ofAmericans consider seventy to be late middle age and that old age itself didn’tbegin until after eighty. The oldest man to finish the London marathon is now101, continuing to show us what is possible for anyone.And yet slowing down the aging process isn’t the same as solving the problem oftime. Why do we accept the ravages of time at all? Can the body’s worst enemyturn into an ally?EVOLUTION OR EROSION?The problem of time comes down to one thing: your body evolves and erodessimultaneously. Both are constant, invisible forces. The surest way to escapetime’s clutches is to keep evolving, and the good news is that sometimesevolution gains the upper hand. Then we feel expansive, optimistic,forward-looking, and eager to discover new things. In that mode, we have all thetime in the world. We can forget time and live as if it didn’t exist (as loversdo, or people totally absorbed in work or play). At other times entropy becomesdominant. Now we don’t have time to get important things done, and what timethere is wears us down. Bored or depressed, we find our lives losing momentum.As our bodies balance evolution and entropy, the two faces of time silentlybattle for supremacy. The “new old age” proves that erosion can be resistedthrough beliefs and attitudes. There is no need to buy into any belief thatpromotes entropy. Far better to assume, as we have all along, that awareness canchange any energy pattern at will.Familiar as they seem, both of these forces are mysterious. Despite theacceptance of Darwinian evolution by the scientific community, nobody knows whyor how Nature takes sudden creative leaps. You would never guess, looking at thefossils of the tiniest dinosaurs that scrambled underfoot as their huge kinshook the earth, that these would be the ultimate survivors of the disaster thatwiped huge dinosaurs out. Still less would you have been able to see in theirscaly skins the potential for hair, fur, and feathers. But without that hiddenpossibility, mammals and birds could not have evolved.Evolution doesn’t telegraph what its next creative leap will be. This isespecially true in human beings. Our Stone Age ancestors had no skill atmathematics (it is disputed whether Neanderthal man could count; certainAustralian aborigines still use a system of “one, two, and many” as their onlyarithmetic), and yet, hidden in their cerebral cortex was a staggering capacityfor advanced calculations. And ordinary memory, which seems quite limited, canexpand at will. With practice, you or I could memorize every word of the Bible,and a precious few individuals are gifted with total photographic memory, beingable to recall every moment of their lives.There is no indication that memory has any evolutionary limits, either. It couldkeep unfolding, without end. The human brain seems set up for that already. Adramatic instance is a woman in her mid-thirties named Jill Price who developedtotal recall more or less overnight at age fourteen. She describes how one sideof her mind participates in everyday reality while the other projects a detailedmovie of any day she wants to recall. Not only does she remember what she did onthat day, as well as the food served on the family table and the news stories inthe daily paper, if Price hears a few bars of a television theme song, sheinstantly knows the show in question and the day she heard the theme. She canname themes from series that were canceled after a handful of episodes.This extremely rare gift is also a unique burden. Price’s memories come with allthe original emotions attached. Somewhat overweight, she ruefully remembersevery time her mother criticized her appearance. The title of her autobiographyis tellingly poignant: The Woman Who Can’t Forget. Price’s onset of total recallwas out of her control, but she reminds us of the vastness of human potential.(If every young child was given memory training, would we develop into a societywith total recall?)Entropy looks less mysterious, at least on the surface. It is simply Nature’stendency to disperse energy and become less organized over time. Hot food growscold if you let it stand; the entire universe grows colder by expanding in alldirections, diffusing the original heat generated by the Big Bang. But lifestands in opposition to this seemingly inflexible principle: all living thingsbuild up energy and become more and more complex. So why wasn’t Nature simplysatisfied with cooling down? There was no real need for the primordial universeto build DNA, which traps billions of bits of energy along its double helix andgains more energy as we eat and digest food.Life represents a cosmic capacity to manipulate both time and energy. As long asyou take in more energy than you give off, you are stopping time. Time only runsout when energy runs out. Imagine a log in the fireplace that takes an hour toburn. That hour represents how much energy is available before “heat death”occurs. DNA makes energy available forever—or close enough, at two billion yearsso far, and counting. DNA functions as if it were immortal. Entropy isn’tbanished; it still presses on your genes, coaxing them to break down, but lifepersists anyway and keeps evolving. To a physicist, your body is an island of“negative entropy,” because as long as it’s alive it refuses to cool down. Acell deprived of food and air for as little as three seconds begins todeteriorate; a brain deprived of oxygen for more than ten minutes begins to die.But these aren’t threats so long as your body knows how to manage time.Now that you know the stakes, a choice must be made—evolve or decline—becausethe option of standing still isn’t available. If you sit in a chair and stopusing your muscles, they will atrophy; the same holds true if you stop usingyour brain. The obvious choice is to side with evolution, because then you cangrow in new, unexpected areas, giving your body an agenda that time cannot undo.CONTROLLING TIMEMastery over time is built into you. Your body runs on multiple clocks, each setto a different speed. When you were a baby, your skull bones fused at a ratethat was incredibly slow compared with the firestorm of new connections thatyour brain was creating by the millions every minute. Your mother’s immunecells, which were your only protection from disease when you were born, weredying as you developed your own antibodies. Your sexual organs were essentiallydormant; your adult teeth were the tiniest of seeds. Dozens of different cycleswere being controlled by the DNA that was originally contained in one cell, thatfirst fertilized egg. You didn’t develop fast DNA for your brain and slow DNAfor your skull bones. The same genetic code somehow coordinates events lastingfrom a few thousandths of a second (the firing of a neuron, the absorption ofoxygen by a red blood cell) to a few years (losing your baby teeth, developing afull immune system), to entire decades (mature reasoning, gray hair, menopause).What this amounts to is that your body is far from being time’s victim; on thecontrary, it orchestrates time to your benefit. Once you force upon the bodyyour own fears and negative beliefs about time, however, the trouble begins.Take the simple belief that there is never enough time. It’s this belief thatcreates deadlines, a highly symbolic word with overtones of mortality: if yourun out of time before you cross the line, you’re dead. Your body plays its partin this belief. If you find yourself racing to meet a deadline, your heart ratewill speed up, your blood vessels will constrict, and your mind will race tokeep pace with everything you need to do. These are all disruptions of bodilyrhythms and therefore disruptions of your body’s exquisite control of time.What’s more damaging is that you are treating time as an adversary.There are many other ways in which this happens. As we’ve seen, research onstress has found that one of the biggest causes is uncertainty. If you place amouse on a metal plate and give it harmless electric shocks at regularintervals, the mouse won’t be happy, but it will eventually adjust. If the sameharmless shocks are administered at random intervals, however, the mouse growsexhausted to the point of death in a matter of a few days. Since life is full ofunpredictability, adapting to it is a major challenge.It’s the incidentals, ironically, that break your body down at the level wheretime is being controlled. When you focus anti-aging on the physical level—onexercise, diet, vitamins, antioxidants, weight loss, cosmetics, and plasticsurgery—you bypass the invisible level that is far more important. Whateverbreaks down your body’s timing creates aging. The culprit is not time itself.Look at the invisible factors that do the greatest damage:Unpredictability. Random events disrupt your body’s rhythms.Disorder, confusion. A breakdown of external order leads to inner disorder.Accidents. Mistakes in your life lead to mistakes in your body.Trauma, sickness. When wounded, your body loses track of time.Violence. When attacked, your body’s timing is shattered.Chaos. When all sense of order is destroyed, your body cannot manage time atall.I’ve listed these damaging factors from least to most harmful because that’s howyour body deals with them. It can adapt to unpredictability more easily than todisorder, and to disorder more easily than to accidents. Consider how everydaychoices influence your body’s timing.Unpredictability. Choosing to keep irregular hours, working the night shift,going to sleep at different times, eating irregularly, drastically changing howmuch you eat: all these choices are known to throw off the body’s basicmetabolic rhythms. The rhythms of the body need to be healthy, because they arethe most basic way that you keep your life properly timed—every cellsynchronized with every other. The more irregular your lifestyle, the harder itis for this delicate, complex coordination to exist. Correction requires goingback to regular hours of work, eating, and sleep. In most cases this is enoughto allow the body to reset itself.Disorder, confusion. Choosing to procrastinate, doubting, indecision, lack oforganization, impulsiveness, slovenliness or careless hygiene, lack of purpose,restlessness, drifting: these factors all create a state of external disorderthat the body must cope with. The brain sends confusing signals about what todo, so the cells lack clear direction. The inner and outer are always linked,and bringing order to your outer life has a beneficial influence on your innerlife. The same is true in reverse: If you address inner confusion and disorder,you can begin to find ways to put your external affairs in order as well.Accidents. Choosing to be inattentive, distracted, undisciplined, unfocused,self-destructive: although some accidents are beyond our control, most resultfrom a failure to pay attention, which is a choice. Your cells are in the habitof never forgetting; they must function precisely, thousands of times persecond. If your attention to external things wanders and becomes unfocused, thebrain can’t be expected to keep your body in perfect working order, either.Trauma, sickness. Choosing unnecessary risks and dangers, gambling with yoursafety, exposing your body to physical threat and infection, refusing to payattention to healing: the belief that sickness strikes randomly no longer holdstrue. You open your body to trauma and disease by ignoring well-known guidelinesfor healthy living and prevention. At a more subtle level, your immune systemtakes its cues from the brain, which implies a great deal of control over whenyou get sick and when you don’t. Once a serious trauma occurs, that part of thebody can no longer coordinate its activities with the rest of the body. The lossof one component throws off timing everywhere until healing brings the wholesystem back into line.Violence. Choosing to be out of control, unleashing anger and rage, refusing tounderstand your hidden hostility, seeking revenge, dwelling on resentment. Anyeruption of violence calls for an extreme reaction from your body, firing upevery cell to high alert. Adrenaline and other hormones involved in fighting arereleased; these are catabolic, meaning that they break down tissue in order torelease energy. As this breakdown occurs on the physical level, control overtime also breaks down—the sudden intrusion of alarm cuts off normalcommunications. Emergencies are enormously disruptive in external life, and yourinner life mirrors that disruption.Chaos. Living in the total disorder of war, crime, domestic violence, abandoningall coping mechanisms, going over the edge socially or mentally: at its mostextreme, life turns chaotic, and the disasters of outer life are visited on thebody. When you can no longer cope, your brain becomes drastically disorganized.The signals sent to the body are then so disordered that the most basicprocesses of sleep, digestion, metabolism, and healing become seriouslycompromised. Short bursts of chaos are almost as destructive as living withchaos permanently. In both cases the body runs the risk of becoming soimbalanced that it cannot return to normal functioning on its own.Fortunately, the order in which the body gets damaged holds true in reverse. Youcan make choices that prevent erosion. In other words, you can retune your bodyso that it regains its complex mastery over time. By starting with the easieststep, you lay a foundation, and then it becomes more viable to make difficultchoices.MAKING TIME YOUR ALLYKeep regular hours, eat and sleep on a regular schedule.Avoid drastic changes in diet and activity.Set up an orderly work environment. Reduce distractions.Rest quietly once to twice during the day to let your body retune itself.Take yourself out of stressful situations sooner rather than later.Take your time; don’t rush.Make decisions when they arise. Don’t procrastinate or get distracted.Pay attention to what is directly in front of you. Focus on one thing at a time.Don’t multitask. Dividing your attention leads to confusion and weakened focus.Avoid the temptation to plunge into high-risk situations.Stay within your comfort zone.Put your house and finances in order.Address underlying anxiety.Release your repressed anger. Learn to do this without losing control or hurtingothers.Renounce violence in thought and word.Become more resilient emotionally.Eliminate chaotic influences at work and in your primary relationship.Live as if you have all the time in the world.Your ultimate goal, living as if you have all the time in the world, isfunctional immortality. This happens to be how every cell in your body isalready living. Immortality comes naturally; giving in to time is what requireseffort. I’m reminded of a therapist I know whose patients’ lives seem out ofcontrol. He surprises them by saying, “Go home and clean your house. Make yourbed every morning. Don’t skip breakfast for a week. Get to work fifteen minutesearly. Then come back and we’ll discuss what’s bothering you.” He wants to seeif they are capable of addressing the simple things that clutter our awarenessbefore turning to deeper psychological issues. Even what looks like a smallchange can retune the body. That’s why we work up to the most damagingthings—trauma, violence, and chaos—by starting with the easiest.If your body can run on dozens of clocks at the same time, each kept in perfectsync, this raises the question of where the master timekeeper resides. Itimplies that there is a place that is unaffected by time, like sitting on thesolid riverbank to watch the constantly changing motion of a river. This placemust be outside time, which means that in some way your body knows what it meansto be timeless. Functional immortality was born here, in the awareness that timecannot touch us.ANDREA’S STORYBecause your body is timeless at some level, you should be able to experiencethat. It’s a mistake to believe that only a handful of mystics, those deeplydevoted to finding God, will experience the timeless. In fact, experiencing thetimeless happens spontaneously to all kinds of people, usually when they leastexpect it. In the middle of life’s activity, they suddenly step out of ordinarytime. This happened to Andrea, a woman now in her thirties, when she was a gradstudent in San Francisco.“I lived on a fellowship that was running out, and then unexpectedly I gotpregnant. My boyfriend was totally unsupportive; he was already staggeringbetween part-time jobs trying to finish his Ph.D. thesis. I was twenty-six, andit felt like my whole future was unraveling,” Andrea recalls.“My parents have strict moral views, so I was completely alone when I terminatedthe pregnancy. The whole procedure was very clinical and nonjudgmental, but Iwent home in tears. I was so shattered that all I could do was lie down in thebedroom with the blinds down. I was experiencing what they call racinganxiety—my mind whirled with images of all the horrible ways my life could gowrong.“I must have fallen asleep, because when I woke up I smelled the scent of lemongeraniums. I was a bit groggy, but I knew that scent. I’d bought a tiny lemongeranium at the grocery and stuck it on the windowsill in the kitchen. How couldI smell it all the way in the bedroom, with the door closed? Before I couldanswer, a kind of peace entered me, as if carried by the scent, and a voice onthe edge of my awareness asked me to be quiet. At that moment my mind wentsilent. There were no more thoughts, just dead quiet inside.”“Is silence really dead?” I asked. “Something keeps happening, doesn’t it?”Andrea agreed. “‘Dead’ is the wrong word. It was a vibrant silence, if thatmakes any sense. It almost sparkled. After a few moments the vibrancy went away,and nothing was left except a deeper stillness. I felt incredibly safe andsupported, if that’s the right word, as if I had landed on the ground floor ofthe mind. Outside the window I heard some children walk by, laughing atsomething or other. Instantly I merged with the sound. It was uncanny, but theirlaughter stopped being outside my head—it came from inside me. There was noseparation; I also felt bathed by the children’s innocence and carefree mood.This feeling lasted for only a minute before they were out of earshot, but itbecame the turning point in my life.”“In what way?” I asked.“In every way, I think,” said Andrea. “I wasn’t the same anymore. I had gonesomewhere I didn’t know you could go. I’ve heard of people who have near-deathexperiences, and when they come back, they’re no longer afraid of dying.Sometimes they aren’t afraid of anything. I experienced that same shift.”“But you didn’t die,” I pointed out.“True,” said Andrea. “But think about how sacred silence and stillness are inevery culture. ‘Be still, and know that I am God,’ says the Bible. I don’t knowif I contacted God, but there was something indescribable in my experience. Itwas like losing all boundaries, but instead of falling apart, you feel morereal. My life didn’t become smooth sailing from that day on. I’m not sayingthat. Yet the outer world doesn’t crowd in on me as much as it used to. Evennow, years later, I can go back and touch the peace that comes when you knowyou’re a part of everything, and everything is part of you.”When such a moment arrives, it feels like we’ve stepped outside of time. But howcan that be? The basic answer is that we all step outside time on a regularbasis. The atoms that make up our bodies wink in and out of the physicaluniverse thousands of times a second. Sometimes a particle that disappears inone place instantaneously reappears in another. Or it sends a signal to anotherparticle light-years away (it can tell the second particle in what direction tospin, for example), and the message crosses billions of miles in an instant,beyond the speed of light.Strange as that behavior may sound, these are the particles that make up yourbody, which means that a fundamental aspect of you is quite familiar with thetimeless. To make this less exotic, imagine the color red. Once you see thecolor in your mind’s eye, ask a simple question: Where is this red? There are nobrain cells that turn red when you think of the color, nor do you go to aspecial place on earth, a color bank, where red is stored. Redness (or any otherhue) exists in a mysterious location that seems to be outside ordinary space andtime. You can fetch a color instantaneously whenever you want to see it in yourmind’s eye, because there was no distance to cover and no time needed to makethe journey. The same holds true for how billions of cells manage to becoordinated in your body. There is no master clock ticking away anywhere in yourbrain—we know this because the brain manages hundreds of different rhythmsmeshed together. The brain tunes in to a place that’s on the very edge of thetimeless. By being anchored there, where atoms first begin to vibrate, settingthe timing of the entire universe, your brain has found the only place fromwhich time can be managed. Strange as this concept may seem to the rationalmind, which depends on clock time to get through the day, the timeless is afamiliar place to your cells. They function as if they were immortal, simplybecause they make use of the timeless every second. The challenge for us is toadopt functional immortality as our basic way of life. To do that, we mustreawaken the connection between time and the timeless, which is known as thesoul.[images/Chop_9780307452344_epub_L05_r1.jpg]IN YOUR LIFE: BACK IN THE FLOWOnce you can accept that time was never your enemy, then escaping the ravages oftime becomes possible. It’s your mind that started the trouble; it’s your bodythat will get you out of trouble. The mind cuts life up into neat slices—days,weeks, months, years—hoping to hoard as many as possible, but always dreadingthe end that will inevitably come. By contrast, your body lives in the moment,and each moment merges into another in one continuous flow.The breakdown of flow is your real enemy. When flow breaks down, the followinghappens: energy is wasted, communication within the body is cut off, gaps appearin the body’s intelligence. These are invisible events, but they are real. Onceyou learn to restore the flow, however, your body is fully capable of repairingthe damage that has built up. It will naturally return to a state of dynamicbalance. At that point the whole aging process comes to an end.No one can expect to bring aging to a stop immediately. But you can make a majordifference starting now. Your aim is to align your mind with a new way of being.We’ve seen the importance of meditation in this regard. Meditation exposes yourbrain to a less active state, and through repeated exposure, your brain adaptsto that stillness and silence. However, there’s still the problem of everydaylife, which pulls us into our old belief that time is running out. If you wantto have all the time in the world, you can train yourself through the followingsimple exercises. 1. Quiet your internal dialogue. This is a simple way to contact the stillness that is the source of awareness. Sit quietly with your eyes closed. Let your breathing settle; put your attention in the center of your chest. As you inhale, let your consciousness settle on the syllable So, and exhale to the syllable hum. Feel the air coolly entering your body, gently carrying the sound; feel the air coolly leaving your body. So-hum, So-hum. (This is an ancient Indian mantra, but you can substitute I am, or Amen, or Om, and the result will be the same.) Continue for ten to twenty minutes. This simple meditation releases the mind from its incessant chattering. Three things may distract you: outside noises, sensations in your body, and distracting thoughts. When you notice any of these, just easily return to breathing on the sound So-hum. Don’t try to maintain a rhythm; don’t try to hypnotize yourself; this is an exercise in allowing the mind to find its own natural silence and effortless focus. 2. Discharge tension. Awareness, like water, is meant to flow easily, without interruption. When awareness becomes stuck, tension is created in the body. Cramps, pain, tightness, and stiffness are the most obvious symptoms of this, but at a deeper level your body is storing the memory of old stress. Yoga or deep energy work are great ways to release these body memories. Yet everyone’s body has a natural mechanism for discharging tension, and you can take advantage of it immediately. Lie down before you go to sleep at night. Assume a position flat on your back without a pillow; spread your arms and legs at your side. Draw in a deep, slow breath, then release it through your mouth in a sigh, as freely and naturally as your body wants. Some sighs may be quick, almost like a gasp; others may be as deep as a sob. You may feel a sense of relief, sadness, grief, elation, or any other emotion. Be aware of the emotions as they arise; you are not just releasing physical tension; you are accessing bodily memories at the same time. The natural discharge of tension bundles thoughts, feelings, and sensations together, so let them all go at once. Do this exercise for no more than ten minutes, because it can be intense; allow yourself to fall asleep if your body wants to. That is also part of the discharge process. 3. The purifying light. When you are in the flow, there is a certain feeling associated with it: light, open, fresh. Being in this feeling gently pushes out negativity and resistance. One way to help this purifying process along is to bring light to the dark places that hide from being seen, where awareness has a hard time reaching. Visualizing inner light is the closest you can come to actually seeing awareness in its pure state; the real thing is invisible, yet when we say that some-one is glowing with life, we are referring to the close relationship between life energy and awareness. Sit or lie down, preferably not when you are so tired that you are ready to fall asleep. Turn your gaze inward, which means feel your body from the inside. Visualize a stream of gold-white light cascading down your body. The stream fills you from the crown of your head slowly through your chest, out your arms, then down your abdomen until it divides and flows down both legs. See the gold-white light go out through your feet and enter the ground. Now take the light back up your body, this time using blue light. See the blue light start at your feet and slowly fill your body until it exits through the top of your head—see it form a laser beam going as high as you can see, out into space and beyond. This whole cycle should take about one minute. Repeat ten times. A simple variation is to sit quietly and breathe in the light, then slowly breathe it out. You can alternate between blue and gold-white, but finish by filling your entire body with gold light, seeing it suffuse everywhere, extending beyond you as a golden aura. Ask to be enclosed in this light for the rest of the day. 4. Toning. Sound can also be a powerful tool for moving stuck energy. Physical sensations and emotions are linked to sound. Sadness gives rise to weeping, happiness to laughter. These are the “sound signatures” of an underlying energy, and if you can find the signature, you can connect to the energy. Old, stuck energies are easier to find this way than trying to trace back the time and place where something happened in the past. Here’s an exercise that uses sound to locate and release hidden energy:Sit or lie down, preferably in a private place where you can feel comfortablemaking noise. Take a slow, easy, deep breath and see it reaching down below yourdiaphragm into the abdomen as deep as it can go. (Don’t force it; just followthe breathing sensation.)As you exhale, make a low tone. You want it to be long and steady–begin byhumming a low note if that helps, but you want to do this with your mouth open.Let the tone extend for as long as you can, until your breath runs out. See thistone rising from your abdomen and coming out of your mouth. Om is an effectivetone, but you aren’t trying to sing or chant. Rather, you want your deepstresses to emerge on the tone. The secret here is to let your body make thetone it wants to make.Toning takes practice. You have to do two things at once: make a tone and keepyour awareness in your body. Don’t pay undue attention to the tone itself. Letit come naturally. A good example is deep sighing. When you sigh and make avocal noise at the same time, a groan or moan, for example, the two arecombined. You feel how much physical relief the sigh is bringing as you make anatural, unconscious sound.With practice you can locate many sound signatures connected to repressedfeelings and buried experiences. Your body knows whether it wants to release amoan, groan, wail, scream, squeal, or cry. Instead of erupting all at once,which can feel jarring, you can provide a long tone that provides a morecushioned release. For example, a low, moaning sound accesses the whole lowerabdominal region. A high-pitched eeee accesses the head. If you experiment, youwill soon find which tone fits which energy. There is no limit to toning, onceyou have learned the knack of letting your body discharge tension by letting thestuck energy ride out smoothly and continuously on a sound."},{"pageContent":"[images/Chop_9780307452344_epub_L03_r1.jpg]RESURRECTINGYOUR SOUL[images/Chop_9780307452344_epub_L03_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"THE SOUL IS YOURSPIRITUAL BODY[images/Chop_9780307452344_epub_L02_r1.jpg]Having a soul could be the most useful thing in your life. So far, however,usefulness hasn’t been the soul’s major attribute. We are told that the soul isour link to God, but like God, it is invisible and far removed from dailyaffairs. Does your soul keep you healthy? Does it help you make decisions orresolve a crisis? All our lives we have referred to the soul with reverence, atone of voice we wouldn’t use to talk about our cars. In reality, however, mostpeople get much farther in their cars than they ever do with their souls.The soul has no function because it hasn’t been successfully defined. No one iswaiting for the world’s religions to agree among themselves. It might seem as ifthe Buddhists are right to take a completely practical view—they dispense withthe soul altogether, arguing that if it can’t be defined, the soul has noreality. But that position isn’t satisfying to the millions of people whobelieve that they have souls. (After all, we know we have a mind even though notwo philosophers agree on a definition of that, either.) We can resurrect thesoul from its dormant state by turning the tables: Instead of defining the soulfirst and asking what it does later, why not look at the need the soul fulfillsfirst and worry about a strict definition later?The main thing your soul does has already been mentioned: it connects you toGod. In a sense the soul is like a step-down transformer. The electricity beingsent through high-tension power lines is hundreds of times too powerful to godirectly into your house; it would burn out every circuit in a flash. In thesame way, the ultimate spiritual power can’t surge directly into you and mewithout harm. It must be stepped down and adapted to human life. The soul existsto perform that function.I realize that this description seemingly depends upon the existence of God, butit doesn’t need to. Without resorting to any religious belief, we know that theuniverse contains almost infinite amounts of energy, and yet Nature has found away to step down the heat of the nearest star, which burns at millions ofdegrees Celsius, to support life on our planet. It has stepped down the force ofgravity, which is so condensed at the heart of a black hole that time and spaceare sucked out of existence, so that it has only enough force to hold the humanbody together. Finally, the electromagnetism that explodes in a bolt oflightning—explosions that once struck the earth’s surface millions of times aday in the planet’s infancy—has been stepped down to the minuscule electricalfirings of brain cells, which are so weak that it takes extremely preciseinstruments even to detect them. (The brain’s entire electrical potential isabout the equivalent of a sixty-watt lightbulb, but this charge is subdividedamong 100 billion neurons, making each brain cell’s portion infinitesimal, amatter of microvolts.)If the physical forces of the universe must be stepped down so dramatically towork on a human scale, it seems possible that God can be thought of as auniversal force that must also be stepped down. But force is a materialisticterm. When we think of God, we use terms like love, compassion, truth,intelligence, and creativity. However much they disagree, every spiritualtradition sees these qualities on a scale from zero to infinite. Inert objectsdo not exhibit love or compassion; they have no visible intelligence. That’s thezero end of the scale. Human beings are imbued with love, compassion, andintelligence, and as we look around, we believe that these qualities are visiblein other living creatures. That’s the middle region of the scale. Then weproject a higher reality where love and compassion become unconditional, whereintelligence is so vast that it can run the universe, and where creativity canbring the universe into being. That’s the highest end of the scale, and the mostcontentious.Science doesn’t acknowledge higher reality, because once you look beyond thehuman brain an invisible region begins. You can see a neuron and therefore claimthat intelligence begins with it, but since a neuron is only made of atoms, howexactly did an atom acquire intelligence? Not to mention the aspects of the mindwe most cherish—love, compassion, truth, and all the other qualities that givelife meaning.The soul serves to get us past the blocks put up by materialism, but,surprisingly, at the same time it also gets us past the faith demanded byreligion. The obstacle put up by science is that everything must be material;the obstacle put up by religion is that one must believe in invisible forceswithout always having direct proof that they exist. As we will see, the soul canbe mapped, even though it is invisible. The human body is a complex system ofenergy and awareness, and the soul can be defined as a subtler version of thosetwo ingredients. Functioning as your spiritual body, the soul generates andorganizes the energy of love, the energy of compassion, the awareness of truth,the awareness of creativity and intelligence. In that way it fulfills needs thatare just as basic as the need of the physical body for food and oxygen.A complete map of the soul would be at least as complex as the human brain.However, here’s a simple map that will turn out to be extremely useful. GOD = infinite energy, love, creativity, intelligenceSOUL = stepping down energy, love, creativity, intelligence MIND/BODY = human level of energy, love, creativity, intelligenceA glance at this diagram suggests an exciting possibility: the soul can bringeven more of God into the human realm. For millions of people, God’s infinitelove has been stepped down too far. They experience only a fraction of the lovethey should, and even that love comes and goes; it sometimes weakens to thepoint that their lives seem to have no love at all. The same is true ofintelligence and creativity. Millions of people function day to day using thesame routines, the same conditioning from the past, the same fixed reactions.Yet there is no reason to believe that God’s infinite qualities must be sodiminished when they reach the human level. Looking around, we see countlessexamples of people who possess enormous reserves of love, creativity, andintelligence. The existence of a Saint Francis, an Einstein, or a Leonardo daVinci indicates that human potential can reach amazing heights. Why and how didtheir souls step down so that so much potential still came through—a gush ofgenius—while for other people the step-down yields barely a trickle?The answer lies at the level of the soul. Just as physical disease can be tracedback to distorted energy patterns at a subtle level of the body, any limitationof the mind can be traced back to distortions of energy, only the level is evensubtler, the level of the soul. Not that we want to isolate the mind. The body’senergy is dependent on the mind, and once we find out why our thoughts, beliefs,wishes, and aspirations are not being fulfilled, removing those obstacles willserve to liberate the body even more.Speaking personally, I find a great emotional release when the soul becomes apractical aspect of life. “Who am I, and why am I here?” The two questions gohand in hand. To answer them, religion says, “You’re a child of God, and you arehere to reflect God’s glory.” Science says, “You’re a complex lump of molecules,and you are here to do what those molecules dictate.” Both answers have producedas much trouble and misery as they have alleviated.Religion is disturbing because it seems optimistic on the surface but deeplypessimistic underneath. What could be more optimistic than seeing yourself as achild of God? You fit into a divine plan stretching back to the dawn ofcreation. As this plan unfolds (in the Christian West, at least), it will redeemevery soul that loves God. Underlying this scheme is dark pessimism, however,because God may hate us for our sins, and even when we strain not to disobeydivine commandments, we unwittingly make mistakes. Worse, the divine plan seemsto allow room for immense pain and suffering that God either can’t or won’tprevent. Our purpose in life comes down to guesswork and desperate hopes that wedon’t fall into disgrace. Who can find the light when the path lies in the dark?Perhaps the plan is knowable only to God.The other ready-made answer, proposed by science, is disturbing for the oppositereason. It is pessimistic on the surface and has just enough optimism underneathto keep us from losing hope. Science denies that life has any purpose. Existenceis trapped between inflexible laws (gravity, entropy, the weak forces) on onehand and randomness on the other. The most cherished aspects of life, such aslove and beauty, are reduced to random chemical firings in the brain. The mostvalued behavior, such as self-sacrifice and altruism, comes down to geneticmutations that have no purpose other than survival. Taken at face value, no onewould choose to live according to such a fixed, meaningless worldview, butscience provides a mitigating layer of optimism with its belief in progress. Ifwe are learning more day by day, so if technology makes life easier with eachnew invention, the pessimism of science can be ignored. You can turn up youriPod if the void begins to seem intolerable.A clear path to your soul is available, but just as we’ve seen with the body,drastically new thinking is required. We need a new set of breakthroughs, eachone rooted in a new reality that isn’t bound by the flawed materialism ofscience or the flawed idealism of religion. Are you meant to be more loving andcreative, happier and wiser? Some people do become more loving as their livesunfold, but others turn in the opposite direction. Some people become wiser,while others cling to ignorant beliefs. Opposites keep clashing. We take thebitter with the sweet because we have to. What this indicates is that there arejust as many breakdowns in the nonphysical part of life as the physical. Eachbreakthrough will take us past these breakdowns. At the same time we willacquire true knowledge of the soul to replace mere wishful thinking. Reachingthe soul means fulfilling the deepest aspirations of the human heart.BRINGING SPIRIT DOWN TO EARTHReligion made a terrible mistake when it consigned the body to the “lower”physical world while the soul was lifted to the “higher” spiritual realm. Afunctioning soul is not so very different from a functioning body. Both areinvolved in the same things—awareness and energy—that make life possible. “I ammy body” and “I am my soul” are two faces of the same truth. The problem is thatwe have lost contact with the soul. It wasn’t created to be useless; we made itthat way.Imagine yourself sitting in a doctor’s office, waiting nervously for yourappointment. Your eye is distracted by a rose garden outside the window, or asolitary tree. Consider how these plants live. A seed begins to grow, and insidethe seed is the plant’s entire life. As it grows, a rose or a tree isn’t temptedto deviate from its programmed existence. In harmony with its environment, arose effortlessly expresses its beauty, and a tree its strength. Human beings,however, are not tied to a preset plan. We have more latitude to shape our owndestiny.Somewhere along the way, we used that free will to make a choice to divide thebody from the soul. The body became identified with sin, and the soul with God;the body with Earth, and the soul with Heaven. But if you take a functionalapproach, there’s no need for such a division. We don’t say that roses have abody and a soul. Everything about them, from the subtlest information in theirgenes to the prick of their thorns, unfolds as one life. A rose’s perfection—sorich, velvet, aromatic, and intensely colored—is present here and now. The sameis true of you, if you can get past the split that cuts your soul off from dailylife.There is no reason for anyone to dream of a lost Paradise, a garden from whichthe first man and woman were banished. Paradise moved inside us to become avision of infinite possibilities. Your chance to evolve is right here, rightthis minute, in this very body. Your soul can step down much more of God’sperfection than you can even imagine. The limited degree of love, intelligence,and creativity that you experience in your life barely hints at the untappedpossibilities.To resurrect your soul, you must do the opposite of what your past conditioningtells you to. Instead of turning to a higher power, you turn to yourself.Instead of leaving your body behind, you take it on the spiritual journey.Instead of condemning physical desire and temptation, you follow desire into theunknown region where the soul resides.It’s strange to say, but even when you lost contact with your soul, your bodydidn’t. Cells keep the faith. They have been using “higher” awareness since youwere born. Here’s a practical example: It’s become a medical cliché that we useonly 10 percent of our brains. In a sense this claim is a trick, because the 90percent that isn’t being used wasn’t made for thinking. There are billions ofcells known as glia (Greek for “glue”) that surround your brain cells to holdthem in place. Glia outnumber neurons about ten to one. For a long time theywere viewed as second-class citizens in the brain, serving as little more thanstructural reinforcement, like rebar in cement. No one suspected the glia’ssecret role, which turned out to make for a fascinating spectacle. Glia are likestarbursts or hedgehogs, with dozens of tiny strands emanating from theircenters.When an embryo in the womb is ready to develop a brain, there’s a huge challengeahead. How can a few hundred or thousand stem cells turn into the billions ofbrain cells required? It’s not sufficient for stem cells to divide madly untilthey reach the right number (although they do that, too). The brain has manyparts, and the neurons responsible for sight or hearing, for example, must getto their proper locations, while other neurons responsible for emotions andhigher thinking must get to their proper destination, too.To do that, each stem cell goes on a migration. The journey is often as long,relatively speaking, as the flight of the arctic tern, which flies almost frompole to pole. In the stem cell’s case, it can migrate almost from one end of theembryo to the other. Migrating stem cells line up by the millions, nose to tail,and travel along the strands of the glia. Under a powerful microscope you canview their journey and marvel at how the stem cells that need to go to oneregion turn off the main highway and follow the exact glial strand that leads totheir final home, while the next bunch of stem cells takes a different turn.Each move is purposeful and guided. The brain grows from the inside out, sonewcomers travel past older brain cells to form layer after layer of tissue.When researchers discovered that glia served as guides for this incrediblycomplex process, their reputation grew enormously. It grew even more when it wasfound that after serving as guides, glia can turn into brain cells themselves.In what way is this not a spiritual journey? Stem cells are being guided home bya higher intelligence, acquiring wisdom along the way. Your life has beenfollowing the same hidden pattern, but instead of following glistening glialstrands, you are guided by your soul. It holds the blueprint of God’s intentionsjust as a blueprint on paper holds an architect’s intentions. Everything a cellcan do must come from somewhere. It would be foolish to believe that brain cellsact randomly; otherwise, stem cells would float about aimlessly with nowhere togo. Our best proof that brain cells are aware and intelligent is that they actaware and intelligent.But the soul isn’t confined to stem-cell journeys happening under the dark coverof the skull. Your soul brings guidance from the outside as well as the inside.You can sit in a chair and reach a life-changing insight, or a great teacher canwalk in the room to deliver it. One event takes place inside you, the otheroutside. But both are events that alter awareness. Once you reconnect with yoursoul, you aren’t restricted to only a few levels of existence: they all open upto the same ever-expanding consciousness. And at every level there is guidance.THE BRAIN CONNECTIONThe most practical way to think of the soul is as a connector. But if that iswhat your soul is doing, connecting you to subtle, invisible levels of life,there have to be junction points with your body. In particular, we need brainconnections. As it stands, the brain is the great obstacle to the soul.Neurologists don’t feel the need for any invisible explanations for love. Theycan exhibit brain scans showing that various areas of the cortex and limbicsystem light up in lovers that don’t light up in the rest of us; being in lovecomes down to bursts of electricity and chemicals, just as, for the geneticist,being in love comes down to a love gene (as yet undiscovered, but the searchgoes on).It’s up to us, then, to prove that love comes from a higher place. If we don’twant to accept that the brain creates love out of an electrochemical soup insidethe skull, where’s the evidence that it comes from anywhere else? Let’s turnback to the example of the Tibetan Buddhist monks who developed “compassionatebrains” as the result of practicing a meditation on compassion. A spiritualquality was transformed into physical manifestation. The split between body andsoul was erased. In Sanskrit the same word, Daya, applies to both compassion andthe everyday trait of sympathy. It turns out that the brain is extremelyvariable when it comes to sympathy. Functional MRIs taken inside a New Mexicoprison (the only program of its type) show that inmates who score high on testsfor psychopathic tendencies also have distorted brain function. Psychopathspossess the least innate sympathy imaginable. They have no conscience; they cancommit acts of terrible cruelty without feeling a shred of the pain they areinflicting. Watching the blood ooze from a knife wound is an indifferent act,like watching juice ooze from a steak.Can a psychopath’s brain be turned into a compassionate brain? No one knows; thepsychiatric profession has largely given up changing psychopaths either throughdrugs or conventional couch therapy. But we do know that the brain is malleableenough that it embraces every moral state, and that every state of consciousnessrequires a shift in the brain. Just thinking that you are compassionate doesn’tdo the job, which leads me to conclude that compassion isn’t a mood, a moralteaching, an ethical obligation, or a social ideal. It’s a subtle activity ofthe brain that needs that subtle level to exist. On its own, the brain can’tproduce change; it merely adapts to your intention. This gives us a slightlymore sophisticated map of what the soul is doing as it steps down subtle energyto the human scale. Take anything that you want out of life. Your soul containsthe potential for it to come true. Your mind brings the potential to the levelof wishing, dreaming, wanting, and desiring. Your brain then produces theresult; you learn how to achieve what you want.Here’s the whole scheme reduced to a simple formulation: * Soul carries the potential * Mind carries the intention * Brain produces the resultThis is the basic flow chart of life. It reverses the flow that scienceespouses, where everything must begin in the brain. But there’s no reason whythe physical level has to be primary. The brain learns new skills by formingneural networks, but the desire for change itself must come from somewhere else.If you think of compassion as a skill, like learning to play the violin, it mustbe prompted by wanting to learn compassion in the first place. This gives us aninsight into the soul’s most useful role: it motivates us to reach higher.A useful soul gives you the vision, the desire, and the will to evolve. Yourmind carries that vision into the realm of thinking and wanting. Your brainreceives the message and begins to give it physical shape. This process isalready familiar to anyone who has learned a new skill. But when we learn to doanything now, we are only conscious of thinking and wanting. The brain isn’taccessible, since we don’t dip into it and start rewiring its connections byhand. The physical level takes care of itself once we start thinking. The soullevel is also inaccessible. We don’t ask God how to ride a bicycle. Only in theisolated compartment we call spirit, where prayers occur, do we say that we areasking God. There is no need for such isolation. Every skill, from the mostmundane to one as exalted as compassion, follows the same process. It’s a mentalprocess that reverberates through the body and soul at the same time. Here arethe steps involved: 1. Becoming genuinely interested. 2. Pursuing your interest spontaneously. 3. Practicing until you see improvement. 4. Sticking with your practice until the new skill is mastered.Simple as these steps are, they require input from awareness; the whole processcan’t be triggered simply by the brain. Step 1, becoming genuinely interested,requires inspiration. To be interested in compassion isn’t an ordinaryoccurrence in a society driven by self-gratification, even among mature,psychologically developed people. But if you read the lore of compassion thatinfuses Buddhism and Christianity, inspiration arises naturally. The same canhappen when you are moved by compassionate acts performed in brave rescues, orby relief missions to places where people are suffering.Step 2, pursuing your interest spontaneously, requires turning inward, becausethe inner landscape is the country of compassion. Once you find the place ofempathy inside you, it wants to express itself. Empathy may bring discomfort(the very word compassion means “to suffer with”), so you have to overcome yournatural urge to turn away from someone else’s distress. Yet in some peoplecompassion triggers a unique kind of joy that they want to follow.Step 3, practicing until you see improvement, requires discipline, because youmust constantly renew your dedication in the face of old conditioning thattempts you to turn away from compassion in pursuit of the ego’s constantdemands. Pleasure is innately selfish; therefore, no one finds compassionwithout a struggle.Step 4, sticking with your practice until the new skill is mastered, requirespatience, because there are many inner forces—and outer ones, too—that opposecompassion. Higher awareness doesn’t force change; it melts away old patterns sothat new ones can replace them, which takes time. (Ask aid workers who haveflown to a disaster in the developing world. Their idealism vanishes at thefirst shocking sight of real devastation. They pass through stages of despair,frustration, and numbness. Yet beneath the surface a new strength develops, onethat not only adjusts to the outer spectacle of suffering, but blossoms into amuch stronger empathy.)This outline gives us more insight into what I’ve called “subtle action,” whichbegins in awareness and then reaches into the body. Subtle action erases theboundary between a compassionate person and a compassionate brain. Each needsthe other; neither is enough on its own. Heretical as it may sound, it tooksubtle action to create Buddha and Christ. They established unshakablecompassion in themselves by following the same steps an ordinary person wouldfollow. Buddha and Christ didn’t realize, perhaps, that they had to transformtheir brains, but they were certain that higher awareness was at work. At thevery least, to be compassionate while not changing the brain is a temporaryachievement, subject to the winds of change. Because we were all born with thecapacity to sympathize, our brains await their next instruction to expand thiscapacity to the level of the soul.GARRY’S STORYThe subtle level of the mind, which connects with the soul, is attuned to signs,omens, portents, suggestions, pointers, and prophecy—indicators of the built-inguidance that is inherent in life. Conscious thinking doesn’t have to beinvolved. But we are so used to thinking as the brain’s highest function thatit’s easy to overlook the silent, hidden aspects of the mind until they suddenlymake themselves known. Then it’s no longer possible to overlook them any longer.“I became a seeker when my career suddenly collapsed,” recalls Garry, who isforty-five and was diagnosed with a serious heart valve defect in his earlythirties. “I went through a difficult surgery that led to complications.Recovery took a long time. The other guys who had been my friends on the fasttrack after business school dropped me; it was like my problems had made mesomehow different. And they were right. I wasn’t like them anymore. Things wereshifting inside.“I took to wandering around town, waiting for something but not knowing what.One day I was getting on a bus, and I had the thought, Am I doing the rightthing with my life? The man in front of me, a complete stranger, turned aroundand said, ‘Trust it.’ Then, as if he hadn’t said anything, he got on the buswithout another word. That moment began a series of strange incidents. I waswalking past a kid carrying a boom box, and at that moment I was thinking ofgoing back to my old job. Suddenly he turned up the volume, and the song thatblasted at me was ‘No, no, no, Delilah.’“I laughed, but I wasn’t entirely amused. I felt a spooky connection withsomething beyond me. Soon afterwards I decided to go to a tarot card reader, andwhen I asked the cards if I should go on a spiritual path, the best card in thedeck came up—it showed ten golden cups with a rainbow overhead and a joyouscrowd dancing down below. After a while it got so I could ask myself a questionand turn on the TV, knowing that the next words coming out of the set wouldanswer my question.”“And it never failed?” I asked.Garry smiled. “Only when I tried to control it. The whole phenomenon had acertain innocence and surprise factor, so most of the time I was caught offguard. If I tried to push things or manipulate the outcome, nothing happened.”“Did you get deep answers?” I asked.He shook his head. “Not always, but each one fit the moment. It was verypersonal, speaking directly to my situation.”Garry had more examples to relate, as everyone does who finds that his life isguided. No one is especially chosen for guidance. It is an aspect of life thatpermeates every level, for all of us. Certainly the instincts built intoso-called lower creatures are a profound form of guidance. One observes salmon,for example, who live for years in the open ocean and then return to spawn inthe exact same stream where they were born. Their unerring guidance is explainedby smell—it is presumed that even hundreds of miles out at sea they can detectmolecules of water from their native freshwater birthplace. But something moreholistic is also at work, because salmon don’t respond to this smell until theyreach a certain age, at which time they find the right direction, change color,stop eating, and begin to secrete large amounts of cortisol, a hormone that willincrease to the point that it kills every fish soon after spawning. Timing,chemistry, sex drive, and life expectancy are precisely coordinated by an innerguidance that remains mysterious.In Sanskrit the inner guidance that shapes a human life is called Upaguru, “theteacher who is near.” Over the past four decades the word guru has becomefamiliar in the West to describe a spiritual teacher—the root word means“dispeller of darkness.” In other words, anyone who can guide you to see whatyou need to see serves as your guru. No one’s spiritual journey is shaped by acookie cutter. Each is made up of individual moments that occur only once in theentire history of the universe. It takes infinite flexibility for your soul tounderstand what you need at any given moment. But every soul is up to thechallenge, and therefore each daily moment contains, hidden inside it, a small,unique revelation. Zen Buddhists hold that every question already contains itsown answer. Your soul takes the same perspective.Awareness has the magical ability to merge question and answer. In Garry’s case,as soon as he posed a dilemma, a chance event or a casually overheard phrasewould contain the solution. Without being aware, he would never have put the twotogether—you have to notice a connection before a coincidence turns intosynchronicity. Someone who is unaware won’t notice that he is being guided. Youmay be surprised when a perfect stranger tells you exactly what you need to knowand skeptical that it means anything. Yet who hasn’t opened a book at random,only to find that the information he wanted was on that page? (I know a legallyblind scholar who told me with a note of triumph that on a good day he didn’tneed to use the library’s microfiche catalog. He would go into the stacks and beguided to the exact book he needed, even to the point that he could pull avolume down at random only to discover that it was the right one.)Upaguru is a mystical phenomenon only if you assume that awareness is limited tothe brain; asking a question “in here” can’t produce an answer “out there.” Butthe wall between inner and outer reality is artificial. Awareness is everywherein nature. Seeing how animals are guided, it’s hard to maintain skepticism onthat point. Migrating whales pick up calls from their kind hundreds of milesaway; migrating monarch butterflies return to the same mountainous area inMexico without fail, even though it is their first migration home afterhatching. A breakthrough can occur when you accept that awareness is what guidesyou. If you attune yourself to that possibility, you are reconnecting to yoursoul, which is nothing but awareness in its most expanded form.RELYING ON THE SOULAwareness comes from the soul, yet many people would say that they have neverbeen guided, much less transformed. For centuries human beings have prayed forsigns that there is a higher power. These signs are actually everywhere, butthere’s a subtle difference between inner and outer guidance. One person’sinsight is another person’s message from God. One person’s glimpse of innerlight is another person’s angel. The realm of the soul has room for both.External guidance comes to people for whom the best proof of spirit is physical.There’s an enormous body of lore about a rescue squad of angels and protectorswho come to earth in times of peril. Many of these are contemporary eyewitnessaccounts. Travelers who find themselves stranded on a deserted road in the midstof a howling storm suddenly see headlights. A kind stranger gets out and changesa tire, fixes a carburetor, or connects jumper cables. This helper thendisappears around the next bend, and the grateful recipient reports an encounterwith an angel.I was vividly struck by a vignette on television in which a woman told her storyof angelic intervention. She found herself alone one Christmas with no money andtwo young children to take care of. She despaired of telling her children thatthere would be no holiday for them that year, since she couldn’t afford presentsunder the tree and a turkey dinner. On Christmas Day there was a knock on thedoor. A kindly neighbor invited the whole family to his apartment, where heprovided a lavish spread and gifts for the children. The young mother, who hadnever seen this neighbor, was overwhelmed by his kindness. She knocked on hisdoor a few days later to thank him, only to find that the apartment was empty.When she inquired at the manager’s office to ask where the stranger had gone,she was informed that the apartment had gone unrented for months. The managerhad never seen the stranger she was looking for.In first-person accounts like this, belief and skepticism are both beside thepoint, I think. We have no hard-and-fast proof either way. Skeptics are forcedto prove a negative, that angels don’t exist. Believers are forced to produce anangel for the camera, and that, so far, hasn’t been done convincingly. Even so,nothing is going to stem the constant flow of such stories. The deeper issue isthat the spiritual world is kept at arm’s length when it depends on angels. Whathappens when the angels don’t show up? That’s where inner guidance proves sovaluable, because the world within is never far away.Without the inner support that comes from your own awareness, you are left in avery vulnerable position. In one psychiatric case study, a middle-aged womancame for therapy in a very agitated state, unable to sleep and prey to fearfulthoughts. A few months before, she had been happy and untroubled. But as she waswalking out of a restaurant by herself one evening, a purse-snatcher ran up andgrabbed her pocketbook. He barely laid hands on her, so she wasn’t hurtphysically. She had little of importance in her purse and lost only the smallamount of money in her wallet.The woman told herself that she was lucky to escape a violent mugging, but overthe next few weeks, these rational reassurances crumbled. She began to feelunsafe for the first time in her life. She kept reliving the incident, and theimages made her increasingly afraid. Most victims of muggings experienceresidual anxiety, no longer feeling quite as safe as they did before. But thiswoman fell into deeper anxiety. In therapy she discovered that she had beenmasking a profound fear of death. She had made herself feel safe by believingthat she led a charmed life. For this woman, who was growing older and had neverexamined her youthful sense of immortality, one shock was enough to crack thefantasy of that charmed life. Then the way was opened for darker energies topour out from their hiding place.The irony of this story for me is that people are immortal. The fantasy ofimmortality masks the very thing that’s true. The soul steps God down to thehuman level, which gives us the appearance of being mortal. But the soul is you.The fact that the soul exists gives us an aspect of the self that transcends thecycle of birth and death. We don’t have to separate the lore of angels from thelore of the soul. We do have to break the supernatural spell that religionweaves around obedience, faith, and theological dogma. Under that spell, peoplelose the ability to find their own inner guidance, which never sleeps and isalways at hand.To break this spell, you must rely on personal experience. The soul can betested. You can ask your soul to produce results by running your ownsoul-experiment. In fact, all of the breakthroughs in this part of the book areself-experiments to prove that higher awareness can be trusted. If your firstexperiment has positive results, you can try another, and then another. This isthe most practical way to resurrect the soul. The more useful the soul becomes,the more real it is, not as religious dogma but as a part of yourself.[images/Chop_9780307452344_epub_L05_r1.jpg]IN YOUR LIFE: GUIDED BY THE SOULIf your inner guide is always with you, why aren’t you aware of it? Actually,you are. Every desire pushes you in a certain direction. Every thought looksforward or backward. Anyone who has a purpose in life, even if that purpose islimited to getting through the day, is following his or her own inner guidance.The real issue is how wise this guidance is. Your soul has the potential to be aperfect guide. You must first attune your mind to a subtler level, and then yourbrain will adapt—this is the flow of life that governs all change. Being guidedis a process, and at this moment you find yourself somewhere—the beginning,middle, or end—of that process.In the beginning, you catch just a few glimpses of subtle guidance. Usuallythese seem like chance events or lucky coincidences. You find that you have madea decision that benefited you, but unlike your usual everyday choices, thisdecision has a certain sense of rightness about it, as if it were meant to be.We’ve all had that feeling at one time or another. You then have a choice,either to say, “I had the strangest feeling that this was meant to happen,”after which you put the whole thing out of your mind, or to stop and look moreclosely at what happened. How you make the choice determines whether you willbegin to listen to your guidance or not.In the middle of the process, your questioning has become more urgent andimportant. You have seen repeatedly that various situations came out in yourfavor. Instead of settling for a vague feeling that God was on your side, orthat fate smiled at you for a moment, you became more actively involved. You askmore personal questions: Why did this happen to me? Who or what is watching overme? Am I the one who’s doing this? There’s no guarantee that you will come upwith the same answers as the rishis, the sages of India. They concluded that thehigher self, which we are calling the soul, is the source of everything,including God and fate.Today, most people fence-sit. While some develop a confirmed conviction that Godis rewarding them and therefore must be worshipped, others consider God a vaguebelief that doesn’t impinge on everyday life; divine reward, after all, raisesthe specter of divine punishment. In a secular world, cause and effect don’toperate on such a supernatural basis. By fence-sitting, a person can worry aboutGod sending bad things their way, while at the same time using practical meansto gain success and avoid failure.The end of the process comes when you stop fence-sitting. You no longerhalfheartedly believe in God and fate, but you seize the reins yourself. At thispoint, guidance becomes an acknowledged part of you and the journey you areconsciously taking. You see the truth of Upaguru—there is guidance at everymoment, because the guru is inside yourself. The teacher is as near as your nextbreath. When I call this the end of the process, I don’t mean that it reaches ahalt, but rather that it matures. The process of being guided is fully revealed,at which point you take full advantage of it. 1. How do you get to this point? 2. Realize that you are on a journey to higher consciousness, and embrace it. 3. Expand your awareness, through meditation, contemplation, and other means. 4. Ask for guidance, simply and sincerely, and then wait for it to appear. 5. Trust your finest instincts. Guidance doesn’t come in the form of fear, premonition, omens, distrust, or self-importance. All of those things exist around us; they cloud our view of true guidance, which is always a signpost to the next step of personal growth.The last point is extremely important but also tricky. All of us have reactedafterwards to a bad event by saying, “I just knew that was going to happen. Ihad this bad feeling.” But that isn’t guidance. It’s the voice of anxiety havingan I-told-you-so moment. The difference is that true guidance is never fearful.Your soul doesn’t say, “Watch out, bad things are about to happen.” It steersyou out of the situation before things turn bad. Sometimes it guides you out ofdanger before there’s even the slightest hint of it. The voice of fear neverdoes that, since it reacts to immediate threat, real or imagined. Getting pastthe voice of fear is important, because fear is part of the shield that keepsyou from your inner self. Like the fantasy of being protected, fear is thefantasy that you are always in danger. True guidance removes these fantasies andreplaces them with reality: you possess a guide inside; it can be trusted. Toactivate this reality, we will go deeper into how the soul connects to theeveryday self.The connecting link is the mind, and much depends on whether your mind is opento your soul or closed to it. In a state of complete openness, the mind canrealize infinite possibilities, far beyond guidance and protection. In itsclosed state, however, the mind mistakes reality. It creates a world that’srandom, impersonal, and unsafe. Because each of us unthinkingly starts off inthat world, our most urgent business is to crack the shell of illusion. Higherconsciousness stands ready to deliver the gifts promised in every spiritualtradition as grace and Providence. In the flow of life, those gifts are meant tobe yours, effortlessly and constantly."},{"pageContent":"BREAKTHROUGH #1THERE’S AN EASIER WAY TO LIVEThe first soul breakthrough takes something that used to be difficult and makesit easy. Connecting with your soul is as easy as breathing, and just as natural.When pollsters ask, “Do you believe you have a soul?” close to 90 percent ofrespondents say yes. But that statistic is misleading, because very few peoplehave actually experienced their souls. They avoid the spiritual journey becausethey assume it will be arduous, with many sacrifices along the way. But doesn’tthat describe everyday life already? (One of the major bestsellers of theeighties, M. Scott Peck’s The Road Less Traveled, hooked millions of readerswith three simple words: “Life is difficult.”)Connecting to your soul is actually easier than whatever you are doing rightnow. It takes effort to keep your soul at a distance. When you stop struggling,the path to the soul is automatic. Everything you want to achieve will naturallyunfold. This is what Jesus meant when he said, “Ask, and you shall receive.Knock, and the door will be opened.”When you meet with day-to-day obstacles, you have put up inner obstacles first.These obstacles block the flow of life from soul to mind to body. If the flowhadn’t been blocked, it would bring everything the soul has to offer. The soulprovides an open channel. If you ask for the truth about something, the truthdawns. If you ask for the solution to a problem, the solution appears. That’swhy Buddhism teaches that every question is paired with its answer at the verymoment the question arises.If any channel in awareness is closed off, it has been temporarily blocked. Thetrap is that so much of this blockage happens without being noticed. We have alladapted to “life is difficult” because we saw no alternative. Like plaquebuilding up on artery walls until the whole blood vessel is clogged, the buildupof struggle and strain happens by tiny degrees.I was reminded of this when I was waiting in an airport between flights. It wasseveral years ago. My daughter Mallika had a two-year-old girl, Tara, my firstgrandchild. I often eased the boredom of airports by calling Tara on my cellphone. It became a ritual that delighted both of us, me because Tara recognizedmy voice, and her because to a two-year-old a telephone is a magical toy.This time when I hung up I noticed a frazzled young woman rushing toward me tocatch her flight. She had two toddlers in tow, and what with being late andstruggling with luggage and a stroller, the mother was overwhelmed. This in turncaused her children to cry. I saw her drag them to the check-in counter. But theyoung woman was out of luck. The gate had closed, and she would have to wait forthe next flight. She pleaded that she had to get home to her family. You couldtell that she was at her wits’ end after a long day.But the agent at the counter was firm. Rules were rules. Passengers had toarrive at the gate at least fifteen minutes before their flight. Frustrated, herkids still crying, the young mother dragged herself away. When she was out ofearshot, the agent turned to her assistant and said, “What could I do? My handsare tied.” The assistant agent was still watching the young mother. “I guessthings are tough all over,” she said, shaking her head.Life is a baffling mixture of Tara’s innocent joy—and the joy she inspired inme—and constant struggle like that of the young mother. We don’t see ourselveschoosing one over the other, and yet we do. For each of us was like Tara whenlife began. The tragedy is that we learn to struggle so young, too young torealize that innocence and simplicity should never have been abandoned. Only ininnocence can you receive the gifts of the soul. Once you accept that you aresupposed to struggle in order to survive, that presumption becomes your reality.It gathers its own energy and momentum. Your brain quickly learns to conform.Once your brain is conditioned, the look, feel, and sound of the world have beenfixed—until you escape that conditioning.TUNING IN TO YOUR SOULWe already know that the body is aware. By tuning in to it, you can increase itsawareness. Tuning in is also how you clear a channel to the soul. You are tuningin to your soul anytime you choose to grow and expand. On the other hand, whenyou tune out, the soul connection is blocked. Anytime you choose to contract inyour awareness, the channel to your soul is squeezed shut. Everyone experiencesboth states. As mystically as we talk about the soul, being connected to itcomes down to everyday experience.TUNED INThings are going easily for me.I’m calmly certain.The answer is clear.Everything fits together.I feel in harmony with the situation.There are no outer obstacles.Opposites are reconciled.I’m open to any possibility.I don’t judge myself or others.I am whole.Whenever you are jarred out of this state, you are no longer connected to yoursoul. This condition also comes down to everyday experience.TUNED OUTThings aren’t going smoothly for me.I’m confused and uncertain.The answer isn’t clear. I go back and forth.Everything is mixed up.I feel out of sync with the situation.There are many obstacles.I’m conflicted inside.I find it hard to see a way out.I keep blaming myself, and others.I feel incomplete. I must be lacking something.Please don’t take these two opposites as either absolute or permanent. Each ofus tunes in and out every day. Our awareness contracts under stress, much likethe body’s stress response. Our aim here is to achieve a permanent connectionthat can’t be broken, yet even short of that, people reach moments of veryprofound connection that change their lives.A friend recently told me about an incident from his past that illustrates thepoint. It was a moment when his awareness expanded all at once.“I was bumming around Europe with a backpack. I was twenty-six, and my life wasa permanent vacation. I held temp jobs for just long enough to bankroll anothertrip.“On this occasion I was the last person to get on the plane as a standby. Iplunked myself down next to a man reading a book. Neither of us looked at theother. The plane took off, and I sat there. For some reason I had this emptyfeeling, accompanied by a vague dissatisfaction. I was surprised because, ingeneral, bumming around Europe had been the happiest phase of my life. But atthat moment I heard myself asking, What are you doing? This is a total waste.“All at once I noticed that the man next to me had put down his book and waslooking my way. ‘Is something wrong?’ he said. I was startled, but for somereason I didn’t brush the question off. The guy seemed sympathetic, so I toldhim what was happening. He asked me if I wanted his opinion. I said sure.‘You’ve come to a moment of decision,’ he said.“I never expected that. ‘What kind of decision?’ I said.“‘You’re considering leaving your childhood behind.’“He kind of smiled, but I knew he was serious. ‘How do you know that?’ I asked.“‘Because it happened to me,’ he said. ‘One day it just dawned on me. I’m anadult. I had crossed a line, and there was no going back. I think the same thingjust happened to you.’”My friend shook his head. “He was right. I didn’t even have to struggle with itthat much. My adolescence was over. I flew home. I put my backpack away in theattic. I gave up my temp jobs and got serious on the work front.”“Those aren’t unusual things,” I pointed out.“I know. Everyone has to grow up sometime. But wasn’t it strange that ithappened to me all at once, and that I was sitting next to someone who knew whatI was going through, and had experienced the exact same moment?”This is an example of how higher awareness reaches into everyday life. On thesurface your mind is completely occupied with thinking and feeling. A rush ofsensations and ideas fills your head from the moment you wake up. But life hashidden patterns that awaken in much the same way that a dormant gene willsuddenly become activated. Out of the blue you have a realization, and in amoment your whole life can change.Most of the time, however, changing the trajectory of your life is lessdramatic. It’s a process that unfolds according to its own rhythm and timing.But whether fast or slow, realizations are mysterious events. You discover thatyou know something you didn’t know before. An old perspective suddenly gives wayto a new one. Psychologists have given us broad maps of major life changes, suchas the “identity crisis” that turns teenagers into adults sometime in theirearly to mid-twenties. There is also the “midlife crisis” when the end of youngadulthood creates panic and generates a powerful impulse to be young a secondtime around.The significant feature of any turning point is that the meaning of lifechanges. And when it does, the change can be stunningly drastic, like Scroogeturning from total selfishness to total altruism on Christmas Day. When yousuddenly fall in and out of love, when you suddenly find religion after decadesof unbelief, or when you go to work and discover that overnight a fulfillingcareer has become empty, a major change in awareness has occurred. If themeaning of life shifts profoundly, higher awareness has reached into your lifefrom the level of the soul.Take the experience of love. Love is most overwhelming as a physical andemotional state, which is how we experience it in the visible world. To be inlove is to be aroused by the sexual and romantic thrill of another person: yourbeloved. The heart pounds, and the pulse races. The mundane activities ofeveryday life pale compared to the intoxication of falling in love. If you tryto refine this tumult while it’s washing over you, you can’t. But in calmermoments, love is more stable and pure, as in the love between mother and child.If we keep refining it, a love for humanity—known as compassion—arises. Purerstill is the love based on abstraction, such as love of beauty or love of truth.Finally, for those few who reach the subtlest essence, love becomes an aspect ofGod. Not all love reaches this exalted goal. The point is the process, therefining of awareness until it becomes more delicate, subtle, and pure. You willstill love your beloved—the physical aspect of life doesn’t disappear—but at thesame time you will feel the higher aspects of love. It’s as if you live in thebody and see through it at the same time.To tune in to your soul, you must participate in this process of purification.Many of us have lost our ability to do that, however, which makes it seem onlynatural that the soul feels abstract, remote, wispy, and aloof. People began tospeak of it as “the ghost in the machine,” a phrase that coupled two falsenotions, since the soul isn’t a ghost and the body isn’t a machine. Thisdisconnect isn’t about sin or disobedience. You didn’t commit a terrible crimethat caused you to be punished as a lost soul (I realize that committedChristians would fiercely argue this point, but in a secular society it seemsevident that most people don’t feel that they have inherited a mortal sin fromAdam and Eve).Even if you are a devout Christian, it’s fascinating to note that in the OldTestament, God promises to send a messenger to earth, one who will bring theLord into the temple, using these words: “Who shall abide the day of his coming?For he will be like a refiner’s fire or a launderer’s soap. He will sit as arefiner and purifier of silver.” (Malachi 3:2–3). In other words, people have togo through a process of refining before God will be real in their lives.EFFORTLESS CHANGEIt would be ideal if the mind were perfectly clear and present in the moment,with no obstacles and blockages. To achieve that, the brain must change. Beingpart of the body, your brain has its own healing mechanisms. But oldconditioning, once it gets established in your brain, becomes part of its neuralnetworks. From your soul’s perspective, these imprints are all subject tochange. Moments of realization occur, and then however it is wired, the brainadapts. Unfortunately, current brain science accepts without question that brainchanges are physical. Can we show that the brain is actually wireless? If wecan, the way is open for awareness as the key to personal transformation.That possibility took a huge leap forward when a team of Italian researchers inthe 1980s was studying the brains of macaque monkeys. When a single neuron wasmonitored in a monkey’s lower cortex, a region responsible for hand action, thatneuron would fire when the animal reached for a piece of fruit, say a banana. Initself, this was a routine finding. Muscles move because the brain tells themto. But when the monkey saw another monkey reach for a banana, the same neuronfired again. In other words, the act of seeing caused the first monkey’s brainto fire as if it had performed the action itself.The concept of “mirror neurons” was born, meaning any neuron that imitates theaction taking place in another, separate brain. The mirroring doesn’t have to bebetween two like animals. A monkey watching a lab technician reaching for abanana will have its mirror neurons activated the same as if it were seeinganother monkey perform the action. This response is not purely mechanical. Amirror neuron can tell the difference between an action it is interested in andone that it is indifferent to. For example, when a macaque monkey watches anexperimenter put a piece of fruit in his mouth, a host of mirror neurons fire,but when the experimenter merely places the fruit in a bowl—an action the monkeyshows little interest in—the mirror neurons barely fire.This means that the brain’s pathways do not have to be sculpted by directphysical experience. They can be shaped vicariously. Is that how we learn in thefirst place? It seems intuitive that a baby monkey, for example, learns to grabthings by reaching out for them. But intuition is wrong in this case, because ababy monkey’s brain doesn’t have the neural pathways to perform the action forthe first time. The purpose of mirror neurons is to build those pathways simplyby looking—or, more precisely, by paying attention and being interested. Thosewords should sound familiar, because the Tibetan monks whose brains had neuralnetworks for compassion built those networks the same way.The brain doesn’t even need instructions to make new pathways. Baby monkeys thatare still nursing will watch their mothers eating solid food, and the mirrorneurons inside their brains are activated as if they are eating solid foodthemselves. When weaning time comes, the brain is prepared. An unknown worldbecomes familiar simply by looking. Human learning may occur the same way, butno one knows yet. For ethical reasons, brain cells can’t be wired for study inhuman infants, but by looking at eye movements, it appears that babies develop amirroring system in the first year of life simply by paying attention tosignificant events around them.Is this how you learn from the soul, too? We have one strong clue that it is.Think back to the phenomenon of darshan—the transmission of a blessing whensomeone is in the presence of a saint. Sages believe that merely setting eyes ona saint brings the blessing, and now we can see how: the devotee’s brain ischanged by the act of looking. “Blessing” is too mild a term, because in itshighest form, known as atman darshan, there is a direct transmission from onesoul (or atman) to another. It couldn’t have occurred to anyone that mirrorneurons were at work. The notion was unknown to me as a child visiting localsaints. But the effects I felt—buoyancy, elation, inner peace—didn’t require anyunderstanding on my part. Someone else’s soul had effortlessly changed my brain.Why, then, can’t my own soul do the same?All the soul has to do is radiate its influence. If simply being close to asaint is enough, how much closer are you and I to our own souls? Higherconsciousness is a field, like electricity or magnetism, and when a person comesinto contact with that field, the brain mirrors it. The word darshan derivesfrom the verb “to see,” but your eyes don’t have to be open; it is nearness tothe field that causes the effect.Going deeper, one finds that higher consciousness isn’t static. A saint cantransmit a specific energy, such as healing, and the target can be one person.Consider the passages in the New Testament where Jesus is implored to heal thesick. He is often reluctant, because he wants his listeners to go insidethemselves to discover the Kingdom of Heaven—in essence, he’s telling them thatthe field is part of themselves. External miracles pull attention in the wrongdirection. When Jesus does happen to heal the lame, halt, and blind, heattributes the miracle to the one who was healed, not to himself.Mark 10:46–52 offers a dramatic example, centering on a blind beggar sitting bythe side of the road as Jesus walks by.When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to shout out and say,“Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!” Many sternly ordered him to be quiet,but he cried out even more loudly, “Son of David, have mercy on me!” Jesus stoodstill and said, “Call him here.” And they called the blind man, saying to him,“Take heart; get up, he is calling you.” So throwing off his cloak, he sprang upand came to Jesus. Then Jesus said to him, “What do you want me to do for you?”The blind man said to him, “My teacher, let me see again.” Jesus said to him,“Go; your faith has made you well.” Immediately he regained his sight andfollowed him on the way.One is struck that the blind man seems more insistent than faithful, but in thetradition of darshan, the incident makes sense. Healing depends on connectinghigher consciousness to lower, a perfect soul sending energy to an imperfectbody. (Jesus’ intervention wouldn’t be needed, except as he says regretfully ofhis disciples, “The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.” In other words,their bodies are not perfectly attuned to the soul, while Jesus’ is.) The bodyhas no choice but to shift, just as a magnet has no choice but to point north.What could be more effortless?PAULINE’S STORY“Everyone who knows me says that I lead a charmed life,” said Pauline, aprofessional woman who is now forty. “Some shake their heads and say itenviously, or with disbelief. But almost no one knows the truth. There’s areason everything goes right for me.”I raised my eyebrows. “Everything?”Pauline nodded. “I haven’t had a setback in twenty years. Things happen thatlook like problems to other people, but in the end they always turn out well. Nomatter what.” She wasn’t smug, or smiling as if she were keeping a mischievoussecret. Pauline had something serious in mind.“It all goes back to a very stressful time in my life. I was out of college buthad no direction. At twenty-five I had landed in a civil service job that hadnothing to offer except security. I dated, but there was no one serious. Thesesound like ordinary complaints, and they don’t convey how terribly restless anddissatisfied I felt. I would wake up in the middle of the night gasping forbreath, like somebody drowning.“Nobody knew how I felt. What was there to say? Nobody could tell me what wasreally going on, at least not anyone I knew.”“Do you know now?” I asked.Pauline nodded. “I was breaking up inside. No, that’s too dramatic. I wasreshuffling. The whole process must have been going on for a while, maybe sincechildhood; I was intensely religious at ten years old, dressing in black andretreating up into the attic to read the Bible. Anyway, I didn’t know how tohandle my restless state, which came to a head one Saturday afternoon.“I was sitting by the window in an old armchair, my mind racing. I can’tremember what my thoughts were about, but I do recall wondering if this is howpeople lose their minds.”“Did you feel crazy?” I asked.She shook her head. “That’s the funny thing. I wasn’t agitated emotionally. Astrange kind of calm had settled over me. It was like watching somebody else’smind racing faster and faster. Suddenly it all stopped. I looked outside at thebright summer sun, and I knew. Everything you want is coming to you. There’snothing to do. Just like that. I couldn’t believe it.”“Did you hear a voice in your head?” I asked.“No. But it felt as if somebody was communicating with me. God? My higher self?I wouldn’t want to put a name to that inner voice, but my body became veryrelaxed. I thought I was going to cry, but instead I gave an enormous sigh. Ahuge burden was lifted that I didn’t even know I was carrying.”“In one epiphany you got a charmed life?” I said.“Yes.” Pauline was unblinking.“Right away?”“Not quite. At first I went around in a state of euphoria. I had complete trustin what the voice told me. I saw everything through rose-colored glasses. Yousee, I had no fear anymore. People don’t realize it, but fear is always lurkingsomewhere in the background, like termites in the woodwork. When it’s gone, thewhole world brightens up.“That phase lasted only a few weeks. I came down off my high. I was more myselfagain. You’d think that was the end of it. But in fact the change was real. Badthings stopped happening to me. I started making choices that were right. Myexistence was no longer full of crises and drama. Other people began to noticethat I was leading a charmed life.”One could see from Pauline’s calm certainty that she didn’t care if anyonebelieved her. I congratulated her, we chatted awhile longer about the goodthings that kept happening to her, and then she left. I have rarely met anyonewho is a better example of the soul’s field effect. The voice she heard didn’tcome from outside herself. We could say that she heard her soul’s voice, but thesoul is silent. Rather, she heard her own mind putting into words a shift inconsciousness. Such shifts are unpredictable; you never know beforehand that youare going to take a quantum leap (although going through a period of turbulence,as Pauline did, is quite common). There are many kinds of epiphanies, and it ismistaken to categorize them all as religious. What all epiphanies do have incommon, however, is that awareness expands beyond its normal boundaries.I would call this an epiphany about surrender. Imagine that you are caughtbetween two forces. One, the force of conditioning, pulls you toward a life fullof effort and struggle. The other, the force of the soul, pulls you toward alife that is effortless. The contest appears to be grossly unfair, because thefirst force has a huge alliance behind it. Everyone you know accepts that lifeis difficult, and therefore society demands that you go along, not only in wordand deed, but even in the thoughts that run through your head. For your thoughtsare not your own. You have assimilated a hundred voices from the widerenvironment—family, friends, mass media, society in general—and now they speakto you from inside your own mind.Compared with this massive alliance, the soul has no visible power. It has novoice in your head. It is too intimate for other people to explain to you. Wehave seen that awareness can move energy, but the soul’s awareness is so refinedthat the energy it moves is incredibly subtle. With so much going against it,how does the soul exert any force at all? The answer is surprisingly simple.Your soul is you. Outside forces exert constant pressure, and in the short run,your soul’s signals will be blocked out. But in the end you can’t ignoreyourself. By being ever-present, your soul can wait as long as it takes.You can perform a simple experiment to prove this to yourself. Consider anotherever-present thing: breathing. You spend hours ignoring your breath. It proceedswithout cessation, never drawing attention to itself. Now sit still and try toignore your breathing. Deliberately make an effort to shut it out. You can’t.Once your attention has been drawn to your breathing, a change has occurred.Eventually, of course, your mind will wander. You will lapse back intoforgetfulness of your breath. But that makes no difference to it. Like the soul,your breath can afford to wait, since it is ever-present as long as your arealive.In Pauline’s case, what really happened wasn’t an epiphany in the ordinarysense. God on high didn’t suddenly notice her and send a special telegram.Rather, she noticed her soul the same way a person notices his breathing. Initself, that’s not a unique occurrence. Each of us has passing moments when weslip inadvertently into a higher state of consciousness. The trick is to keepyour mind from wandering away again. Pauline achieved something rare: shenoticed her soul and then didn’t take her attention off it. The soul’s presenceremained with her, which is why her life became “charmed.”This may seem like a special case, but the general principle holds true foreveryone. If you can bring your attention to the level of the soul, struggleceases. The first thing to change is your perspective, but there are changes inthe way that life treats you as well. These are more mysterious. Our societydoesn’t accept that the soul—invisible, eternal, detached, unmoving, andimmortal—has the power to transform the stubborn world of concrete objects andmaterial events. Yet for life to become easier, the soul must have that power.There are levels of mystery yet to explore.[images/Chop_9780307452344_epub_L05_r1.jpg]IN YOUR LIFE: CREATING YOUR OWN EPIPHANYIt’s unfortunate that the word epiphany is limited to a religious context.People assume that epiphanies are about God and occur only to saints. Anepiphany is really a mini-breakthrough. One piece of conditioning is shattered.Instead of being the victim of a rigid belief, you feel released. What causessuch a mini-breakthrough? You have to shift your attention to the soul, becausethat is the aspect of yourself that is not conditioned. The soul representshigher awareness in that sense—it is free from all conditioning. Or, to put itmost simply, the soul never says no. Anything is possible. Whatever can beimagined comes true. If you can keep your attention on your soul, you willexperience an epiphany every day. Instead of no, you will experience unlimitedyes.To get beyond the power of no is crucially important. No is very convincing.People reject all kinds of experiences because they believe it’s right toreject. They oppose because they can’t bring themselves not to. The spell of noholds them so strongly that little else matters. Some concrete examples willhelp here, then we will see how each one can be reversed.GETTING PAST NOYou must break the spell when your mind: * tells you that people don’t change * keeps you trapped in rigid habits * traps the mind in obsessive thoughts * creates cravings that cannot be appeased * puts up fear as a threat if you try to break free * forbids you to have certain thoughts * makes natural urges seem illicit or dangerousIt takes mini-breakthroughs to get past the power of no because there is so muchnegativity to overcome in so many areas. But in each area the same principleholds: to make life easier, you need to stop doing whatever it is that you’redoing. I know this sounds terribly general, but in reality if you were doing theright thing, you would be in contact with your soul already, and you life wouldbe unfolding, day by day, on the principle of yes. So you have to stop whatyou’re doing and shake things up.Now let’s look at the specific areas where the power of no needs to bedislodged.Negative Belief #1: People don’t change. This familiar assertion seemsreasonable in moments of discouragement and frustration, but if you look moreclosely, it has the effect of shutting down change in yourself. In essence, ifother people can’t or won’t change, we’re fated to live in the status quo. Whenyou assume nobody is going to change, you have closed the box and locked themin. At the same time, you get locked in, too. It’s easy to miss thatimplication, because in our heart of hearts, we secretly believe that we canchange; it’s only other people who can’t. In reality, they feel the same aboutyou, and so a system of mutual discouragement is set up. In short order, anyonewho stands up and says “we need to change” is bucking the status quo. And anyonewho breaks away and actually does change is viewed with suspicion, or withoutright hostility.From your soul’s perspective, however, none of this is real. It’s obvious thatpeople constantly change. We hunger for news; we inflame daily life into crises,large and small. Our moods shift, as does every cell in our bodies. To say thatpeople don’t change is arbitrary, a point of view that seems safe. It’s a formof resignation, of giving in to the inevitable. You must stop reinforcing thepower of no if you want to reach your soul. * See yourself as changing all the time. * Encourage change in others. * When you hear yourself uttering a fixed opinion, stop. * When someone offers a counter-opinion, don’t resist. * Argue from the opposite side every once in a while. * Don’t stamp out the fragile beginnings of change, either in yourself or in others. * Stop being absolute. Let your attitude be more flexible and provisional. * Don’t take pride in being right. * When you have an impulse to grow and evolve, follow it without regard for the opinions of others.Negative Belief #2: Habits keep us trapped. Everyone knows what it means to becaught up in habitual behavior. Life’s everyday struggle is dominated by ourinability to think and behave in a new way. Habits keep married couples lockedin the same argument for years. It makes us plop down on the couch rather thanwork for change. It reinforces bad diets and lack of exercise. In general, habitmakes inertia easier than change. Here the force of no is fairly obvious—or isit? If you look at it without negative judgments, a habit is nothing more than auseful shortcut, an automatic pathway imprinted in the brain. A skilled pianisthas imprinted the habit of moving his fingers a certain way; he wouldn’t want toreinvent his technique every time he sat down at the keyboard. A short-ordercook who can turn out six omelets at a time relies on the fact that his brain isimprinted with a set of automatic motions precisely timed.From your soul’s perspective, a habit is just a choice that is ingrained forpractical purposes. There’s no issue of good and bad, right or wrong. You alwayshave the choice to erase the imprint and create a new one. A pianist who takesup the violin isn’t hampered by the imprinted way his fingers used to move. Ashort-order cook who goes home to make one omelet instead of six isn’t compelledto work at lightning speed. What keeps us trapped is the spell of no. In thegrip of that spell, we find reasons to keep being stuck in habitual thinking andbehaviors when they no longer serve us. We voluntarily renounce the power tochange, while at the same time blaming our bad habits, as if they had anindependent will (currently it’s fashionable to blame the brain, as if itsimprints are permanent and all-powerful). To break out of any habit, you need toreclaim your power to choose. * Don’t fight against a bad habit. Look at it objectively, as if another person had the habit. * Ask yourself why you have chosen your habit. * Examine what benefit you are getting, usually at a hidden level. * Be honest about your choice. Instead of saying, “This is just how I am,” admit that you have chosen inertia over change because change frightens or threatens you. * If you feel victimized by a bad habit, ask yourself why you need to be a victim. Is it an easy way to keep from taking responsibility? * Find a reason to adopt a good habit in place of the bad one; make your reason convincing, and keep repeating it to yourself whenever the old habit arises.Your aim is to break the spell that says you have no choices. You always havechoices.Negative Belief #3: Obsessive thoughts are in control. Most people don’t thinkthey are obsessive. They identify obsessions with mental disorders, when in factan obsessive-compulsive disorder is just an extreme variation on a universalcondition. Obsessions are yet another way that the power of no removes yourability to choose. At any given moment you might obsess about keeping safe,avoiding germs, getting angry in traffic, spending money, disciplining yourchildren, defeating terrorism—the possibilities are endless and ever-changing.You can’t assume that a thought becomes an obsession only if it’s immoral,wrong, or irrational. One can obsess about things that society approves of andrewards. We all know people who obsess about winning, or getting back at thosewho wronged them, or money, or ambition. By definition, an obsessive thought isone that’s stronger than you are. That’s where the power of no does its damage.From the soul’s perspective, thinking is an expression of freedom. The mindisn’t compelled to prefer one thought over another. Much less is the mind amachine programmed to repeat the same message over and over. What keeps ustrapped in repetition is the belief that “I must think this way.” Otheralternatives are closed off by fear, prejudice, self-interest, and guilt. Tobreak out of obsessive thinking, you must examine this deeper level where “Imust” holds sway. * Don’t struggle against thoughts that keep repeating themselves. * When people tell you that you keep doing the same thing, believe them. * Don’t accept that always winning, always being out for number one, or always doing anything is productive. * Don’t pride yourself on consistency for consistency’s sake. * If you feel trapped by an obsession, ask yourself what you’re afraid of. Repetition is a mask for anxiety. * Stop rationalizing. Put your attention on how your thoughts feel, not on what they say. * Be honest about the frustration you feel with having the same idea over and over. * Don’t defend your prejudices. * Take active steps to reduce stress, which is a major cause of obsessions. Under stress, the mind keeps repeating the same thing because it isn’t relaxed or open enough to find an alternative. * Through meditation, seek the level of your mind that isn’t obsessed, that has no fixed ideas.Negative Belief #4: Cravings can never be appeased. When cravings keepreturning, they force you either to give in or resist (the futility of thisstruggle was touched on earlier). The power of no insists that you have no otheralternative. Once again, a repetitive pattern imprinted in the brain overridesfree choice. Your craving takes on a life of its own, and if taken to extremes,it becomes an addiction. The difference has to do with just how limited youbecome. Someone who craves chocolate can’t resist eating some, but if addicted,they would eat nothing else. Even in its milder forms, however, craving can makeyou feel that you have no other choice.From your soul’s perspective, a craving is another example of a shortcutimprinted in the brain. The person who always eats chocolate has made animplicit choice that chocolate is the best kind of sweet, and therefore, insteadof his being bothered every time to consider a variety of sweets, he chooseschocolate automatically. But setting your mind on autopilot doesn’t mean thatyou can’t change it. The option to reset your reactions always exists. Under thespell of no, you willingly gave up that option, but anything you give up you canalso reclaim. * When a craving arises, don’t make it an either/or choice. * Instead of either giving in or resisting, do one of the following: walk away, postpone your choice, find a distraction, pause and watch yourself, or substitute another pleasure. * Don’t think of defeating your craving. Think instead that you are gradually erasing an imprint. * When you feel discouraged for giving in, be with your feelings instead of pushing them away. * Realize why appeasing a craving never works: you can never get enough of what you didn’t want in the first place. * Find out what you really want, whether it’s love, comfort, approval, or security. These are the basic needs that cravings try to substitute for. * Pursue your real need. If you do, the craving will automatically lose its grip and in time will vanish. * If for any reason you can turn away from your old craving, seize that moment, even if your craving soon returns. Every small victory imprints the brain in a new pattern. Don’t see this as a temporary victory—see it as a sign that you can find the switch that turns your craving off.Negative Belief #5: Fear keeps you from being free. The power of no uses fear asits enforcer. Like a hired gun, it holds a threat that is merciless andindifferent. Under the spell of no, the mind finds any and every reason to beafraid. The simplest things become objects of anxiety. The most unlikely risksloom as dangers that can befall you at any moment. When you find yourself in adefensive posture, you have denied yourself the most basic freedom, which is tobe safe in the world. It’s not the external threat that creates this situation.We project our fixed beliefs onto every situation, so feeling safe or unsafebecomes a personal decision.From the soul’s perspective, you are always safe. The universe cherishes yourexistence. Nature is designed to uphold your well-being. If you find yourselfunder threat, it can be quite realistic to assess the danger and escape it. Butif you are paralyzed by anxiety, the threat becomes inescapable. Someone with afear of heights, for example, finds it impossible to climb a stepladder. Thedanger of falling doesn’t prevent other people from climbing the ladder, becausethey are free to assess that the risk is small. But a phobia takes away thefreedom to assess danger realistically; fear acquires absolute power, the powerof no. To get beyond a phobia, you must call its bluff and reassert that you aresafe. * Don’t fight your fears when you are actually afraid. * When you feel calm and safe, call your fear to mind so that it can be examined. * Fear is convincing, but that doesn’t make it right. Make sure you see this distinction. * Anxiety tends to obsess about reasons to be afraid, stoking its own fire. Don’t be fooled by repetition. A situation doesn’t become more dangerous just because you keep thinking it is. * Separate the energy of fear from the content of your experience. Instead of worrying about the thing that makes you anxious, go directly to the feeling of anxiety and move the energy as you would any other, through physical release, toning, meditation, and other techniques. * Realize that you are not basically afraid. Fear is a passing emotion that can be released. * Know that you have a choice to either hold on to fear or let it go. If you feel anxious, take immediate steps to let go. Don’t dwell on fear or try to reason with it. * Avoid blaming yourself. Fear is universal. It is felt by the bravest, strongest people. To be afraid doesn’t mean you are weak. It means you haven’t yet let go. * Be patient with yourself. Fear and anxiety are the biggest obstacles for everyone. Be thankful and congratulate yourself every time you overcome fear. * Don’t consider it a defeat if fear returns. The time will soon come when you can sit calmly and move the energy of fear. Ultimately you are the one in control.Negative Belief #6: “Bad” thoughts are forbidden and dangerous. People expend alot of subtle energy in pushing down thoughts they don’t want to face. Denialand repression seem appealing as short-term solutions. What you don’t thinkabout may go away. But there’s a sticky quality to bad thoughts—which are anythoughts that make you feel guilty, ashamed, humiliated, or distressed. Anddenial only makes the pain worse over time. Delay also makes it harder torelease old, stuck energies when you finally decide that they must beconfronted.If you choose to push bad thoughts out of sight, that’s your decision. Thedanger comes when you begin to believe that certain thoughts are forbidden as ifby a law of outside force. When that happens, the power of no has convinced youthat your own mind is your enemy. Many people, including trainedpsychotherapists, are threatened by the “shadow,” a name given to the forbiddenzone of the mind where dangerous urges lurk. Under the spell of no, you fearyour shadow and believe that you should never go near it.From the soul’s perspective, the mind has no boundaries. If you feel that it isforbidden to look at your rage, fear, jealousy, desperation, and feelings ofvengeance, you are resorting to a false sense of self. Specifically, you aredividing yourself into good and bad impulses. The paradox is that your good sidecan never ultimately win, because the bad side will constantly fight to bereleased. An inner struggle ensues. You wind up living in a state of undergroundwarfare. Instead of trying to be good all the time, try to win your freedom.When the mind is free, thoughts come and go spontaneously. Whether good or bad,you don’t hold on to them. As long as the mind is allowed to flow, no thought isdangerous, and therefore nothing is forbidden. * See the difference between having a “bad” thought and acting on it. * Don’t identify with your thoughts. They aren’t you; they are passing events in the mind. * Resist the urge to demonize. Judgment makes illicit impulses stick around. * Learn the value of acceptance. * Don’t condemn others for their thoughts. * Don’t set up a false ideal of yourself. See clearly that every kind of thought, mood, and sensation exists in your makeup. * Celebrate the diversity of your mind. A mind that is free to think any way it wants should be appreciated, not suppressed. * If you were taught that God will hate you for sinful thoughts, try to detach yourself from this perspective. Holding a judgmental God responsible for your own self-judgment is a delusion. * Don’t fixate on being right all the time. Being right is just a disguise for making other people wrong. In the shadows, you secretly fear that something is wrong with you, which is why you fight so hard to appear infallible—you think it makes you good. * When you are tempted to control your mind, stand back and realize that the task is impossible to begin with. Even the most disciplined mind has a way of breaking out of its chains.Negative Belief #7: Natural urges are illicit or dangerous. Since there is nosuch thing as an artificial urge, all urges are natural. They arise from eithera desire or a need. When the mind intervenes, however, any urge can become adanger. Eating a candy bar feels dangerous if you are obsessed with your weight.Loving somebody feels dangerous if you fear rejection. There is a tangled dancebetween what we feel and what we think we should feel, and everyone is caught upin the dance, which is why disputes over social values can lead to violence.People have a lot at stake in judging right from wrong, and invoking God orhigher morality to justify their own sense of guilt and shame. The power of noinsists that right and wrong are absolutes. Under its spell, you become afraidof what you actually feel. Unable to assess your feelings in a positive light,you allow them to become distorted. As a result, more and more energy is spentdefending white against black, without regard for the fact that violence even inthe defense of right is wrong.From your soul’s perspective, all urges are based on legitimate needs. When theneed is seen and fulfilled, the urge fades away, just as hunger fades once youeat. However, when a need is denied or judged against, it has no choice but tobecome more insistent. Urges build up, pushing against the resistance that istrying to hold them down. At a certain point this war between urge andresistance becomes so strident that you lose sight of the original need.When someone is pulled toward illicit sexual urges, for example, it is all butcertain that a simple need—for love, gratification, self-worth, oracceptance—has become deeply buried. All that’s visible is the illicit urge andthe war it wages with shame and guilt. If the illicit urge is rage andhostility, the underlying need is almost always the need to be safe andunafraid. So the ultimate issue isn’t whether you can win the battle against our“bad” urges, but whether you can find the need that fuels them. When you cansatisfy a basic need, impulse control is no longer a problem.Stop seeing this as a matter of self-control. Every kind of urge comes and goesin everyone. * Be willing to stop judging against yourself. Bad urges don’t make you a bad person. * Know that neither side will ever win an internal war. * Don’t make this a test of willpower. Giving in to an urge isn’t proof that you need to discipline yourself even more. * Permissiveness isn’t a viable solution, any more than is its opposite, rigid self-discipline. Acting on your urges serves only as a temporary release of energy, like opening a steam gasket. There will always be more steam. * Your personal demons will get worse if you keep being ashamed of them. * Guilt is a perception, and all perceptions are open to change. You can’t instantly change guilt to approval, but you can see guilt as negotiable. When you remove the underlying energy that forces you to be guilty, a new perception can flower. * Realize that your soul never judges you. With that in mind, your aim is to live from the level of the soul. That is the final answer to the war between good and bad."},{"pageContent":"BREAKTHROUGH #2LOVE AWAKENS THE SOULA breakthrough at the soul level expands love, but it also brings challenges.The soul takes God’s infinite love and steps it down to human scale. How muchintensity of love you can receive depends on many things. Most people dream ofmore love in their lives, yet in reality the amount they have right now is whatthey have adapted to. There’s also the issue of how acceptable it is to showintense love. Not everyone would be comfortable if you suddenly confronted themwith an onrush of unconditional love. They would wonder if this new kind of lovecould be trusted. In their heart of hearts they would worry that they didn’tdeserve such open, complete love.Many people have made momentary contact with the soul’s more intense, purerlove. When they do, there’s a wonderful sense of awakening. Love awakens thesoul. This happens because like is attracted to like. The soul isn’t passive. Itvibrates in sympathy with you anytime you try to free yourself from limitations.There’s a similar sense of expansion and liberation when you experience beautyor truth. You are freeing up soul energy and letting it flow. The electricity inyour house doesn’t provide light and heat until you flick a switch. Somethingvery similar happens when you awaken the soul’s energy.People experience a surge of the soul’s energy without knowing exactly how theydid it. Without warning they glimpse unconditional love or feel God’s presence.There’s a sense of being blissful and unbounded. It suddenly feels real to gobeyond all boundaries. Why, then, does everyday life draw them back down again?These privileged journeys into expanded awareness are almost always brief—amatter of moments, perhaps a few days, and rarely more than a few months.Year after year the brain has adapted to a way of life in which it is normal tobe much less than loving and joyful. Since you can’t force yourself to embracesomething new, what will do it? The answer, I believe, is desire. The desire tolove and be loved constantly urges each person forward. When that desire is mostalive, we seek the most from life. When that desire flickers out, life becomesstatic.Countless people prefer to exist without love because they are too afraid torisk whatever comfort they have; others have failed in love and feel wounded, orhave grown bored with someone they once loved. For all these people, love hascome to a stop, which means that an aspect of the soul is numb. To tell someonein that condition that love is infinite may be inspiring, but the inspiration isempty unless they can experience not infinite love, but the next step. And thenext step is always the same: to awaken the soul. Because everyone is different,there’s no cut-and-dried method to achieve this. It may work to tell a lonelyperson to get out of the house and meet new people, go on a date, or join anInternet service that matches couples up. And it may not work at all.THE SECRET OF DESIREWhy is love like water to one thirsty soul and yet rejected by another? I’mreminded of a poignant story told to me by a woman from the Southwest whoretired from a lucrative media job to become a builder. She chose to buy land inthe most dilapidated section of the barrio, where she intended to renovate agroup of adobe houses. “It was a hard choice to be a builder in thosesurroundings,” she recalls. “I hired local workmen, but there was a lot of theftfrom the site. Many of the men were out of work and resented having a womanboss. Every day the kids on the block would gather at the curb to stare at meframing out a roof or plastering a wall. None of them had ever seen a new housebeing built, I imagine.“Two kids caught my eye. Antonio was older than the others, maybe fifteen. Hehad a drug history and a string of arrests. But one day I came to the site andfound a mural of the Virgin Mary painted on a wall. When I asked around, Antonioconfessed that he had done it. So I made a secret pact with him. I bought himthe materials that local painters used to make traditional retablos, holypictures painted on tin. He eagerly went to work, and it wasn’t long before hehad an active little business going. Nobody talked about what I’d done for him,but they knew.“The other kid was a little girl, Carla, who was eight or nine, very bright andvery curious. We got to be friends, and I met her mother. I was so touched bytheir sweetness, people who had almost nothing, that I went to the best privateschool in town and got the principal to agree to admit Carla on a fullscholarship.“I took time off and helped her mother send her off that first morning, and thenI went back to work. Around one o’clock I looked over and saw Carla where shealways was, standing with the other kids watching the workmen. She was no longerin her school dress. I felt very upset and ran down the street to the trailerwhere the family lived.“I asked the mother what had gone wrong. Did Carla misbehave? Did the other kidspick on her? She looked away, not wanting to meet my eyes. ‘I went back at noonand took Carla home,’ she said. ‘You tried to do a nice thing, but she doesn’tbelong there. She’d never fit in.’ I tried not to get angry. I coaxed andcajoled, but the mother was firm, and her little girl never went back.”The moral of this story is that love and desire must match. The spiritual pathunfolds when you follow your heart’s desire. Inside everyone is a place that isintimate, alive, and full of yearning. It doesn’t focus on God, or salvation, orunconditional love. It focuses on the next thing it desires. If that next thingis fulfilled, there will be another next thing, and then another, and on and on.Religious traditions miss this very pragmatic point. They offer the final,glorious reward to people who can’t figure out how to get the next small reward.No religion can dictate from the outside. Only you are in touch with the livingimpulse of desire that wants to move ahead.But what if the next thing you want to do is eat chocolate cake? What if yourdeepest hunger is for a second house or a third wife? The soul doesn’t judgeyour desires. It works with who you are and where you are now. The trick is toturn the path of desire, which for most people is focused on worldly things, andredirect it to a higher plane.THE PROBLEM OF BOUNDARIESAs much as you may love chocolate cake or a second house, there’s a limit to thejoy that material things bring. The great disadvantage to desire is thatrepetition kills joy. Couples face this problem in marriage, because daily lifewith another person, however much you love that person, involves a great deal ofrepetition. The standard advice is to add spice by doing something new. Surpriseyour husband with new lingerie. Surprise your wife with a vacation in Bermuda.This advice may work in the short run, but it’s only a temporary diversion.There’s a deeper answer based on the soul.As your soul sees it, desire has no interest in repetition. It wants to godeeper. It wants more intensity, more meaning, more expansion. What keeps amarriage alive is that you see more to love in your partner; the possibilitiesgrow over time. Intimacy with another person is an incredible discovery, forwhich there is no substitute. When you find such intimacy, you naturally wantmore—you want it to grow closer. On the other hand, desire that doesn’t godeeper, which circles around repeating the same pattern over and over, hassomehow been diverted from its natural course.If this description brings images to mind of a dog chasing its tail, or racingcars endlessly marking laps on the track, you have grasped the point perfectly.Desire that pursues its object while never gaining ground is stuck. A boundaryacts like an invisible fence or a line that is not supposed to be crossed. Whydo we put boundaries around our desires? First, to keep out uncomfortableexperiences. Think of the times you’ve passed a panhandler or beggar on thestreet—or a Santa ringing a bell for charity at Christmas, for that matter. Ifyou decide to freeze out their pleas, you put up an invisible barrier. Becauseit is psychological, a boundary can have emotional implications for the personwho sets it in place. Imagine yourself as the panhandler instead. When you say“Spare change?” some people will simply ignore you; others will hurry theirsteps out of guilt; many more will be irritated or angry; a few might ironicallytoss you a penny or act deeply offended.The second reason for putting up a boundary is to protect your comfort zone.Inside this zone you feel satisfied. You also feel safe and protected. There aremany kinds of comfort zones. For every person who feels safe only when he or sheis alone, there’s another who feels safe only when other people are around. Butwhatever kind of zone you have created, you are making it much harder to allowchange into your life. When I was a medical intern rotating through variousdepartments of the hospital, I learned some acute lessons about why people don’tchange. One of my most vivid memories from a veterans hospital outside Bostonwas of leaning out the window of the cafeteria, watching patients down below.Each patient was wheeled to the front door of the hospital, at which point hegot up and walked away. A happy sight, you would think. But one day I saw a lungcancer patient under my care cross the street and enter a drugstore. Two minuteslater he came out with a carton of cigarettes under his arm. He had alreadyripped open a pack and lit up the first smoke. When I pointed this out to asecond-year oncology resident, he shrugged and told me that if he looked out thewindow, he’d see half of his patients doing the same thing. He had learned notto look.This was thirty years ago, and fortunately the tide has turned against smoking.But the deeper point is that people will go a long way to protect their comfortzones and to fence out painful reality. Another memory from those days, this onefrom a time when I was on psychiatric rotation: a woman came in for evaluation,and as I was doing her workup, she revealed that she had four young children athome and a husband who had lost his job and started to drink. She was diabeticand many pounds overweight. I felt overwhelmed at what her life must be like,but when I asked her why she had come to the clinic, she said, “I have a feelingI’m depressed, but I can’t figure out why.”Back then I assumed that offering kindness, sympathy, and caring would nourisheveryone—I underestimated how protective boundaries really are, thinking theywould be easy to tear down. Boundaries are made of frozen awareness, which isvery elusive to understand. I had a very warm-hearted mentor on my psychrotation who was considered the most empathetic doctor in the hospital. He couldget people to open up who seemed frozen and out of reach. He himself was adelightfully open, carefree person, and he used his natural charm to disarmfrightened patients.But he also had deep understanding of why these people were unreachable. It’sone thing to feel unloved, he said, but for some, “I am unlovable” is such adeeply ingrained belief that it feels like part of who they are. So when youexpose them to love and caring, they flee. Why shouldn’t they? You arethreatening to take away part of their identity, which would be threatening toanyone. Try going home next Christmas or Thanksgiving and being kind to therelative who bothers you the most. When you radiate love where once you radiateddislike, their response will probably be suspicion, and if you persist, they maybecome anxious or angry.In short, our boundaries are part of our identities. The soul can change thatidentity, and the process begins by negotiating with your boundaries. You know,in your heart of hearts, that you aren’t truly safe, protected, or fulfilled. Ifyou want those things to be real, several new assumptions come into play: * You are not so afraid of risk. * You don’t have to be right all the time. * You trust that love is meant for you. * You welcome the opportunity to expand. * You see abundance as natural to life. * You don’t expect anything.These are powerful beliefs, and they all melt boundaries. Let’s take a closerlook at how they work.You are not so afraid of risk. Taking a risk is the same as stepping outsideyour boundary. We all want to be free, but anxiety holds us back. Every motherknows the look a toddler wears when it first tries to walk—it’s a mixture ofcuriosity, intention, anxiety, and open-eyed wonder. “What am I doing? I know Iwant to try this, but it feels wild.” That’s the look of a risk-taker. Itexpresses the mixed feelings that are inescapable when you abandon what you knowfor what you don’t. Boundaries try to convince us that risks are too dangerous.In truth, risk-taking is desire coaxing you to reach for something new.People who avoid all risks are making a devil’s bargain. In exchange for limitedfulfillment, they gain safety. But that safety is an illusion. The reality isthat they are stuck, immobile. Think of an agoraphobe, someone who is afraid togo outdoors or into large open spaces. Staying at home feels safe at first,because the outside has been walled off. But as time passes, even the safety ofbeing in the house starts to lose its effect. Now the agoraphobic sufferer findshimself feeling comfortable in only one room, and then a smaller room, untilonly the smallest room in the house brings any feeling of security. Why does thephobia progress this way? Because the desire to be outside can’t be stifled, andas it builds up, the phobia counters by creating tighter and tighter boundaries.Learning that risks are positive, that they allow you to grow, is an importantstep.You don’t have to be right all the time. Being inside a limiting boundary islike being the ruler of a small island. You are in control, and the essence ofcontrol is always being right. I once met a strong-minded man, an executive in alarge corporation, who had the annoying habit of contradicting everyone whotried to talk to him. His automatic reaction to any statement, no matter howobvious or innocuous, was “That’s not true” (or “There’s another way of lookingat this,” “I’m not sure about that,” or “That’s a weak argument,” etc.).Apparently he was unaware that he did this. He had just gotten into the habit ofmaking everyone else wrong so that he could always be right. An associate of hisasked me to assess what was going on. I sat and listened while this man spent anhour contradicting each person he came into contact with. I decided to try thedirect approach and pointed out that he had said “That’s not true” at leasttwice a minute all morning. Without the slightest hesitation he turned to me andsaid, “That’s not true.”Notice how much is contained in those few words. “That’s not true” allowssomeone to shut out anyone who disagrees, and to put up a warning sign thatreads, “Keep out. My mind is already closed.” Boundaries, it turns out, servevery complicated purposes; they can’t be defined purely as psychologicaldefenses. In this case, learning that you don’t have to be right means learningto trust, because the basic need expressed is for control. The boundary is onlystrengthened if you challenge it; trying to prove to a control personality thathe is wrong is futile. Instead, you must show, over and over, that your love canbe trusted.If this boundary is your own, the best approach is to trust someone else in asmall way every day. That means not telling them in advance how to do things,not nitpicking and indulging in perfectionism, not contradicting and insistingthat only you know what’s right. Reversing our habit of being right will feeluncomfortable—that’s only natural. But for every time that your trust isrewarded, you will have one reason fewer to put up your old wall.You trust that love is meant for you. Many kinds of boundaries hideself-judgment. People who reject intimacy feel that they don’t deserve love.They fear exposure, not wanting other people to see how unlovable they are.Putting up a boundary also allows them not to look at why they feel they don’tdeserve love. (In place of love, you can substitute respect, admiration,acceptance, appreciation—these are all offshoots of love.) The most fortunateamong us have been loved since birth. But that is rare. Most people haveexperienced a combination of love and rejection, even when very young. They havebeen exposed to negative situations in which their worthiness remains aquestion.The only cure for this doubt is to be loved, and that won’t happen if you shutyourself off. Unfortunately, the more you feel you don’t deserve love, the moreyou isolate yourself, and then the certainty that you don’t deserve love growsstronger. In essence, you can only attract and hold on to as much love as youfeel for yourself. One sees evidence for this when a woman says, “I keep datingthe same man over and over,” or “I only meet men who wind up rejecting me.” Inthe case of men, the complaint is the same, but with gender variations: “I meeta lot of women, but nobody I’d marry,” or “I love women, but I don’t want to bepressured to settle down.” Society provides all kinds of ready-made responsesbehind which a person can hide from his or her own self-judgment.This limiting boundary can be taken down by trusting that you are lovable, notcompletely (that would be asking too much), but enough to remain on the outeredge of your comfort zone. You can help a needy child, work for the poor, tutora high-school dropout—these are acts of love that bring rewards just as big asgoing on a date, and usually more. As love comes to you, it will become part ofyour identity. Love wants to grow. You only need to plant the seed.You welcome the opportunity to expand. People who live behind boundaries aresuspicious of expanding. Human beings are unique in that expansion for ushappens in awareness. For example, it’s expansive to share and give. But thematter is complicated: the physical act of giving isn’t sufficient. It’spossible to give away millions while still being greedy and selfish at heart.There seems to be an innate mechanism that makes it almost physically necessaryfor some people to contract, withdraw, and hide. A recent social scienceexperiment took a group of people and showed them a series of slides depictinggruesome events, such as war and automobile accidents. Each person was monitoredto measure his or her response, using blood pressure, heart rate, and galvanicskin response. Everyone in the group found it stressful to look at the harrowingphotos. But at a certain point some subjects became inured to what they wereseeing. Their stress response tapered off, while for other subjects itdidn’t—they were just as upset by the last horrible sight as they were by thefirst. On the surface this experiment showed how quickly some of us buildbarriers against experiences that we find fearful. Another result turned out tobe counterintuitive, however.The people taking part had been asked beforehand to state their politicalpreferences. As it turned out, those who labeled themselves liberal were theones who quickly overcame their initial shock and got used to the gruesomepictures. Those who identified themselves as conservative were the ones whoremained distressed. The experimenters struggled to explain this result, becausethe stereotype of bleeding-heart liberals would lead one to assume that theywould be the most sensitive. But perhaps it takes a strong ability to accept theexistence of pain and suffering in order to try to fix it, whereas people whoremain shocked by pain and suffering only want to stop seeing it. You have to becomfortable with painful reality before you can actually help to do somethingabout it.The same applies to helping ourselves. It takes willingnes to face the darknessbefore the light can come in. Your soul treats your boundaries with utmost care.It never demands healing. It never crashes through, even with love. Here, Ithink the mind leads the emotions. Expansion happens on its own, but first yourmind must give permission. Contraction is always based upon fear, and fear’sgrip is entirely emotional. Like a parent who coaxes a timid child into thewater, you can negotiate with your fearful, contracted self. It takes skill.The key step is to realize that even the tightest, most constricted part ofyourself wants to be free. With that in mind, you ask yourself, “What do Iwant?” The answer doesn’t have to be grand. You don’t have to want totalfulfillment, joy, and love. Find a feasible desire. The next thing that bringsyou joy, whatever it is, brings you closer to your soul. It may be mixed withdiscomfort, but if you can give yourself a truly expansive experience, your needto contract will begin to diminish. The more joy you are open to receiving, theless you’ll need to have any boundaries at all.You see abundance as natural to life. If you believe in scarcity, you cannothelp but live in fear. Most of us consider our jobs, houses, bank accounts, andpossessions defenses against scarcity. But inner lack is the real threat. Yourbody is an obvious example of Nature’s abundance. Hundreds of billions of cellsare provided for. Your blood surges through your arteries like a tidal wave.Likewise, your soul is a reservoir for infinite energy, creativity, andintelligence. It can’t possibly run dry. This means little, however, if youbelieve that you are living in scarcity.When that belief takes hold, it takes enormous struggle just to squeeze enoughout of life to survive. This belief is common, ironically enough, among verywealthy people. Their riches keep them satiated externally while on the insidethey feel famished. Hence they crave more and more of what didn’t satisfy themin the first place.There is a huge discrepancy, then, between what the soul is providing and whatwe receive. I find that when someone feels poor inside, the following exerciseis very helpful. Take a piece of paper and write the word Abundance, then draw acircle around it. Now write five words around the circle, each one standing foran area that would make your life feel more abundant. (When I do this exercisewith people, I ask them not to write material things like money, houses, orpossessions. Career, work, and success are good substitutes, because they havean inner meaning.) Let’s say the five words you wrote were: * Peace * Fun * Compassion * Well-being * FamilyOne man actually listed these five things. For him, life would be abundant ifall of these areas were more fulfilled. Now, taking each item in turn, writedown three things you can do, starting today, to make these areas morefulfilling. Here’s a sample of what this man wrote: Fun: Spend more time outdoors. Play games with the kids. Learn to havefun again.Compassion: Give to the homeless guy on the block. Offer help to my depressedco-worker. Volunteer at local animal shelter. Family: Tell my wife more often that I love her. Sit at the dinner tableand talk about how everyone is doing. Pay attention to signs of sadness andunhappiness.It’s not enough to yearn for more in your life. Your desire must be specific; itmust point from where you are to where you want to be. Such a desire isn’tchaotic or out of control. Rather, it exerts gentle pressure for change.You don’t expect anything. Nothing creates more unhappiness than failedexpectations. The job promotion that doesn’t come through, the proposal ofmarriage that is postponed one more time, the image of an ideal family thatnever materializes. Expectations are an attempt to control the future. Anexpectation says, “I won’t be happy unless x happens.” Here we must be careful,however. Having no expectations is a familiar way of saying that life is emptyand without hope. That is not the goal. Instead, it’s a kind of openness inwhich anything can happen and be welcomed.Recently I had a vivid experience of this. A book tour had taken me to the tenthcity in as many days. To survive the grind of traveling from airport to airportand hotel to hotel, I had created a routine. But on this day no part of theroutine went well. I got up early to exercise, but the hotel’s gym was closed. Iwent to breakfast for juice and toast, but, this being a Sunday, all theyoffered was a lavish brunch buffet. The staff had forgotten to deliver themorning newspaper, and the car that was supposed to take me to where I wasspeaking came late, forcing us to rush through traffic and keep the entireaudience waiting.Hunched in the back of the car, I wasn’t happy, and I knew why. It wasn’t justan interrupted routine; it was failed expectations. I had posted a mental planabout having a good day, and piece by piece the things I expected didn’t cometrue. My desires had been blocked. This happens to everyone. Expectations don’tcome true, and the result is disappointment. Afterwards I realized that I couldhave enjoyed my day more if I had approached it without any expectations. 1. I could have been more centered. When you are centered, you aren’t so dependent on your circumstances. The ups and downs of everyday events don’t throw you off. 2. I didn’t need to dictate in advance what a good day would be. One can never see the whole picture. Room needs to be left for the unexpected. In that way, when the unexpected comes, it upsets nothing. 3. I could have let go of outcomes. The only thing any of us can control is our own actions. Outcomes are beyond our control. 4. I could have taken things less personally. Life comes and goes. The universe gives and it takes away.Nurturing these attitudes in yourself helps you not to build up expectations.I’m not suggesting that you can totally avoid disappointment. Our minds arestocked with images of things that we identify with happiness, and by expectingthose things, we expose ourselves to letdowns. Yet we also know that a bettersort of happiness exists. Next Christmas, which would make you happier, a giftthat comes from a list you wrote, or a gift that comes as a complete surprise?Your soul doesn’t exist to fill a mental list constructed in the past. Its giftsare unexpected. The happiness it brings is fresh because it comes from outsideour expectations.The magic of desire is linked to the freshness of life as it constantly renewsitself. The soul isn’t a suitor who whispers “I love you” in your ear. The soulhas no words, no voice. It expresses love through action, by bestowing the nextthing that will give you joy. The next thing may be insignificant; it may beearth-shaking. Only one thing is certain: love awakens the soul and brings itslove in return. That’s the experience you will have once your boundaries beginto soften. Ultimately, the possibility opens up of a life without anyboundaries. It’s this possibility we need to explore next.[images/Chop_9780307452344_epub_L05_r1.jpg]IN YOUR LIFE: LETTING YOUR SOUL SHINE THROUGHThe influence of higher awareness is constant and always beneficial. Like a warmlight melting an ice sculpture, it doesn’t matter if the ice is carved into afearsome monster; all that matters is melting it. If you can’t feel the warmthof your soul shining through, it’s being blocked. Resistance can always betraced back to the mind. These obstacles, being invisible, are difficult tospot. Your mind is expert at hiding from itself, and your ego insists thatbuilding boundaries is one of its most important jobs. So the best way toobserve what you’re doing is through the body. Your body can’t fool itself theway your mind can. It has no access to denial. Fear and anger are its responsesto the most powerful threats. When your body registers either emotion, someoutside force is pushing against your boundaries.Fear is physically debilitating, and when it turns to terror, it paralyzes. Fearis registered by a tight stomach, cramps, coldness, blood rushing from the head,dizziness, feeling faint, and tightness in the chest. Anger is registered bywarmth and flushed skin, tense muscles, a clamped jaw, quick, irregularbreathing or loud breathing, a faster heartbeat, and a pounding in the ears.These are unmistakable signals, but the mind can ignore them anyway. Notice howoften a person will say “I’m okay, nothing’s wrong” when her body is blatantlycontradicting her. You need to trust your body’s cues, even when your mind issaying otherwise. Trust begins by recognizing the signature of each emotion.Each one is a sign that you are resisting. An experience is creating stress, andthat happens because instead of flowing through you, that experience has hit abarrier. Maybe you can’t see what’s going on, but your body can feel it. Feelingis the first step of tearing down barriers and no longer needing them.It’s helpful, then, to explore more of these physical cues. When two feelingsare related, like anger and hostility or grief and depression, I’ve given theprimary emotion a longer explanation.Humiliation is like fear in that your body feels weak, but in this case it isn’tcold. Your cheeks redden and your skin warms. You shrink and feel smaller.Extreme fear makes you want to run away; humiliation makes you want todisappear. Humiliation lingers in the body and can be triggered by the slightestmemory from the past. Someone who has been severely humiliated, especially inchildhood, will be listless, unresponsive, and withdrawn; the body will feelchronically weak and helpless.Embarrassment is mild humiliation. It shows the same physical signs but passesmore quickly.Frustration is like anger, but more bottled up. It feels as if your body wantsto be angry but can’t find the switch. Movements become rigid, another sign thatthe outlet is blocked. Frustration can also be anger combined with denial, inwhich case you will experience signs of denial—averted eyes, quick, dismissivespeech, shrugging, tightened jaw muscles, labored breathing. In other words, theperson’s real feelings are dammed up. Some people show subtle signs of beingangry, such as being too restless to sit still. Not all frustration is linked toanger, but even when someone complains of being sexually frustrated, forexample, irritability and anger are rarely far away.Guilt creates a restless feeling, like being trapped and wanting desperately toescape. You feel confined or suffocated; breathing can seem difficult. The chesttightens and wants to explode, to release pent-up guilt as if it were physicallytrapped. We say that guilt gnaws at you, which the body can register as chronicpressure on the heart.Shame is another warm feeling, bringing flushed cheeks and warm skin. Butthere’s also a sense of numbness inside that can feel cold and empty. Likehumiliation, shame makes you feel smaller; you shrink and want to disappear.Shame is related to guilt, but it feels more like a dead weight, while guilt isa beast that wants to explode out of you.Anxiety is chronic fear; it’s an emotion that weakens the body. The more acutesigns of fear may not be present because you’ve grown used to them; your bodyhas adapted. But the body can’t adapt completely, and so the fear creeps out insigns like irritability, tuning out, numbness, and sleeplessness. The body canbe listless or restless, which sound like opposites. But when anxiety persistsfor weeks and months, symptoms have time to shift and adapt to each person’scircumstances. In all cases, however, if you lie still and go inward, fear willbe present just beneath the surface.Depression feels cold and heavy, lethargic and lacking in energy. There are manyvarieties of depression, because like chronic anxiety, this condition can lastfor weeks, or months, or even years. Your body has time to build up its ownunique defenses. For example, someone who is depressed typically feels tired,but that’s not always true: high-powered types can continue to function byforcing themselves to be energetic despite their depression. When allied to asense of hopelessness, depression can make you listless and dull; why move whenthe situation is hopeless to begin with? Depressed people may complain of beingcold all the time. They flounder physically when confronted with challenges, asif confused or helpless. Many people balk when depressed, refusing to react;others lose all motivation. Their bodies signal those attitudes by movingslowly, rigidly, or hesitantly.Grief is like depression but even more cold and numbing. The body can feel soheavy and listless that the person feels dead while they’re still alive.Hostility is like anger, but needs no trigger to set it off. There are angrycues all the time, combined with a kind of simmering vigilance, alert to theslightest excuse for full-blown rage. The body feels tight, tense, and ready foraction.Arrogance is disguised anger, like hostility, and it is also chronic. One seessigns of it all the time, and the person needs only the slightest trigger tostart acting proud, dismissive, and aloof. But arrogance buries its underlyinganger deeper than hostility, so deep that this normally warm emotion turns cold.Being bottled up and in control, arrogant people don’t explode; instead theydeliver a measured dose of cold fury, marked by clenched jaws, a cold stare, andrigid facial expressions.When you detect these physical cues in your own body, the first step is to trustthem. The second is to examine their motivation. Boundaries make you act in waysyou aren’t fully aware of. Often your ego has an agenda of its own, and it istrying to push that agenda, even though your body isn’t buying it. Here are someexamples of ego agendas:Self-importance is an overall strategy for seeming bigger, stronger, more incommand or control. The physical giveaways tend to be arrogance and other signsof controlled anger. Signs of frustration indicate that nothing is ever goodenough. The body is often rigid, with a stiff neck and head held high; the chestcan be stuck out or expanded. Along with these cues, self-important peopledisplay typical behaviors of impatience, belligerence, aloofness, and colddismissal. When challenged, they pontificate; if overmatched, they withdraw andbalk.Prickliness, easily taking offense is the ego’s strategy for dealing with fearand insecurity. The person tries to project a self-image that’s stronger than heor she actually feels. Therefore, the smallest slight feels like a threat or awound. There are degrees of this strategy, as with everything the ego does.Curmudgeons are chronically prickly and need no trigger; they feel angry anddisgusted all the time. Egotism, which is insecure self-centeredness, alwayscomes with a sense that one is a fraud; therefore, taking offense is theegotist’s way of attacking first in order not to be found out.Criticism and perfectionism constitute another variation on attacking beforesomeone else attacks you. In this case, the critic fears being seen asimperfect. There’s an underlying sense of being wrong or defective. The sense ofbeing never good enough is projected outward: “Nothing can be right with you ifI’m not right.” When our ego adopts this agenda, it thinks it’s protecting usfrom anxiety and humiliation. Perfectionists hold up impossible standards sothat nothing can ever be good enough, thereby proving that they are right tofeel that they can never be good enough. There’s obviously an element of angerhere as well, since the critic and perfectionist are attacking their victims,much as they always protest that “it isn’t personal.” It’s always personal—tothem.Dependency is the ego’s way of pretending to be helpless because it doesn’t wantto face its fear. Dependent people cling and act needy. They refuse to takeresponsibility. They idealize stronger people and try to latch on to them (ifonly in fantasy, as hero worship). The underlying physical cues are those ofanxiety, depression, humiliation. When they are happy, dependent people warm up;they love being loved. When they have no one to lean on, however, they becomecold, withdrawn, and depressed. There’s often a sense of vagueness about them,because they don’t know how to get what they want. They depend on someone elseto get it for them, as children do. The body will often show signs of beingchildlike and immature by being weak, clumsy, uncoordinated, and prone to injuryand sickness.Competitiveness, overachieving, and acting overbearing is a very general egostrategy, one that externalizes fulfillment and makes it dependent on winning.The underlying feeling can be hard to read. It could be anger or fear. It couldbe anything, really, since the person is so fixated on outer accomplishment thatthere are no windows looking inward. The physical cues are also hard to read,because competitive people exert constant efforts to be energized, up andrunning. They are easy to read when they fail, however, since this leads toanger, frustration, and depression. Instead of examining those feelings, theborn winner waits them out until he has recharged his batteries and is up again.But no matter how exuberant and energized they appear, overly competitive peoplesecretly know the price they are paying for being number one. Climbing to thetop excites them, but they feel exhausted and insecure once they get there,anxious about what tomorrow will bring—which is inevitably newer, youngercompetitors just like them. In time, winners can wind up baffled and confused.They have built so many inner barriers to protect their “weak” feelings—as theywould label them—that when they decide to look inward at last, they have littleidea how to go about it.Failure, underachieving, and checking out is the opposite strategy from being awinner. The ego, never competing or fully engaging, prefers to sit on thesidelines. It lets life pass by while hanging out. The physical cues aregenerally not hard to spot. Because they are listless, such people show signs ofanxiety, a chronic hidden fear that makes them cold, sluggish, limp, undefended,and vulnerable. Their bodies look slumped as if in defeat. The chest is sunken,the posture stooped. Their eyes are averted or look at the ground. There’s ageneral sense that they don’t want to be seen or noticed, so their bodies oftenappear to shrink. It may be that the person is actually holding a job andsupporting a family, but inside, their sense of failure is chronic; it makesthem feel small, weak, and immature, as if they mysteriously failed to grow up.To expand in awareness, you must see past these ego agendas and learn to behonest about your motivations. There’s a sort of negotiation constantly going onbetween your ego and your body. When you become aware of what your body istrying to tell you, then your ego can’t keep reinforcing its agenda. You havephysical proof that you are blocking out the flow of experience, which should beeasy, carefree, and spontaneous. So when you see yourself falling back on afixed ego strategy, see it for what it is, and stop. You must catch yourself atthe very moment that you begin to act self-important, dependent, or overbearing.Your ego will kick into its prearranged behavior automatically; like muscles,behaviors have memory. Once you trigger them—even slightly—they jump intoaction.Simply by being aware, you can check on your body. There will always be signs ofan underlying emotion. Feel that emotion; be with it. Contact allows thephysical sensation to dissipate naturally; your discomfort lessens as your bodylets go of distorted or stuck energy that you have been holding on to. Only inthis way can you melt away your defenses. Unless you are aware, change isimpossible. But when you bring awareness to your body, you can start becomingundefended. Reality starts to be more acceptable as it is, not as you try toforce it to be.Congratulate yourself for being willing to change. Awareness is capable ofovercoming the most restricted boundaries, because every boundary is made ofnothing but awareness that has decided to contract instead of expand. Also,appreciate your body for its honesty. It has been letting your soul shinethrough when your mind refused to. You are making a connection to your body, andeach connection, however small, brings you closer to your soul as the level oflife where you can reside permanently and with total ease."},{"pageContent":"BREAKTHROUGH #3BE AS BOUNDLESS AS YOUR SOULIt takes a major breakthrough to get beyond all boundaries. We are so used tothinking in limited terms that even the soul has become limited. It has become athing, an object that just happens to be invisible. Look closely at thesentence, “I have a soul.” What does “have” mean in that sentence? It seems tomean the same thing as having a house or having a job. It implies ownership, asif your soul belongs to you. If you did possess a soul that way, the followingthings could also be true:You could lose your soul.You could give it away.You could put a price on it.You’d know where your soul is located.You could compare yours with someone else’s.These are just a few of the troubling implications that stem from thinking thatthe soul is an invisible object. You can find someone to believe in every itemon the list. Most cultures have legends about losing one’s soul, selling it tothe devil, or having demons run away with it. Even today, losing your soulstands as a very real threat to devout Christians. We need to find analternative idea, because as soon as souls can be lost or saved, blessed orcondemned, they become objects. The time has come to make a breakthrough andtreat the soul as it really is.In place of a soul that you own, which is mythical, there’s an unbounded soulthat exists everywhere. The soul is primarily a link to the infinite. Itconsists of pure awareness, the raw stuff from which all your thoughts,sensations, wishes, dreams, and visions are made. Think of white, the puresthue. White doesn’t look to the eye as if all colors could be derived from it.You would suppose the opposite, that no colors could be extracted, since whiteitself has no color. Pure awareness goes even further. It isn’t a thought, yetall thoughts come from it. It isn’t a sensation, yet the senses derive from it.In fact, pure awareness lies beyond any experience in space and time. It has nobeginning or end. Nothing can bind or enclose it, any more than you couldenclose all the energy that erupted in the Big Bang. Yet the influence of thesoul permeates all of creation. The unbounded soul flows in, around, and throughyou. Indeed, it is the real you because it’s your source.I think religions fell back on personalizing the soul as “mine” or “yours”because just as an infinite God boggles the mind, so does the unbounded soul.Something more manageable was needed. Hence a personal God who sits above theclouds and looks down on his children, to whom he has provided a personal soulthat fits neatly inside the heart. Reducing the soul to a piece of privateproperty makes it easier to handle, but it distorts reality. Let’s try toreclaim reality. Can you and I be as unbounded as our souls? I think we can.That’s exactly where our journey is taking us. If living inside boundariescreates limitation and suffering, the only alternative is living outside them.There lies freedom from suffering; there lies true fulfillment. The unboundedsoul can’t be lost or saved, it can’t be denied or evicted by God, because Godis made of the same pure awareness.When you give up the idea of “my soul,” you can participate in an unboundedcreation. Countless people don’t realize that such a choice exists; many morewouldn’t choose an unbounded life if it was offered. Living within boundariesoffers a sense of security. But this turns out to be an either/or choice. Let meillustrate.There’s a clever tactic reportedly used by the indigenous Bushmen of SouthAfrica to find water. In the desert regions that the Bushmen have longinhabited—they are thought to be the oldest strain of humanity stillexisting—water is scarce and difficult to find in the dry season. But onecreature that can always locate the most hidden springs and pools is the baboon.The Bushmen trick baboons into showing them where the water is by placing somechoice nuts inside a hollow tree. The opening to this cache is barely largeenough for the baboon to stick its paw in. When it reaches for the nuts andgrabs a handful, the animal can’t get its closed first back out again. Thebaboon is too greedy to let go of the nuts, and so it is trapped. Hours go by,and eventually the baboon is too thirsty to stay. It lets go of the nuts andimmediately runs to find water, with the lurking Bushmen following. The baboonhas become their unwitting guide.There’s a moral here about the soul. As long as the baboon holds on to what itwants, it’s trapped. But as soon as it lets go, it wins its freedom. So long asyou cling to anything by saying “mine,” you can’t be free. Your soul isn’t athing you can cling to and make your own. Caught in the Bushmen’s trap, you canonly win your freedom by letting go. The mystery of the unbounded soul iswrapped up in those two issues: how much you want to be free, and how to let go.HOW DO YOU LET GO?As a practical matter, people are torn between holding on and letting go. In oursociety, holding on is seen in a positive light: we hold on to our dreams, ourhopes, our livelihood, our faith. But there’s a suspicious trace of ego here.The ego holds on too long and for the wrong reasons. It has a vested interest inbeing right. Is it right to live behind boundaries? You will never know untilyou challenge your ego’s certainty. That’s why letting go is rarely simple:consider how many miserable relationships persist because one spouse or theother insists on proving that he or she is right Pain and suffering aren’tstrong enough to trump the desire to be right. The endless arguments among theworld’s faiths, which regularly erupt in crusades, jihads, and other forms ofreligious violence, attest to this. All religions preach peace, and so warringover peace destroys the very value being defended. Every religion believes thatdivine love should be followed as a model on earth, but love evaporates in themidst of conflict.Yet living from the level of the soul is impossible without letting go. This isa choice you make eventually. In daily life, this either/or choice is welldefined. Here’s what the two sides look like.SOUL EGO Accepting Rejecting Approving Critical Cooperating Opposing DetachedClinging Calm Agitated Forgiving Resentful Selfless Selfish Peaceful ConflictedNonjudgmental JudgmentalYour soul is just as much a part of you as your ego. Given a simple choice, allof us would choose the soul’s way. We would rather accept than reject; we’d wantto be peaceful rather than agitated. But life brings difficulties, and to copewith those difficulties we are forced to make choices that aren’t simple. Whatif your house was robbed and the police caught a couple of teenagers with theflat-screen television they stole? You have your property back. Would you choosenot to prosecute? What if they caught the teenagers, but your television hadalready been fenced? Would you be more inclined to prosecute? These negotiationsbetween mercy and punishment are symbolic of the fork in the road that presentsitself whenever the ego would go one way and the soul the other.The most common everyday actions move you away from your soul. Today or tomorrowyou might * reject an experience in advance * criticize someone else or yourself * oppose a new idea * cling to your point of view * feel agitated inside * resent the position you’ve been put in * raise the level of conflict in the situation * consider your own selfish interests before anything else * cast judgment and blame on othersIn each situation the ego is being reinforced. Of course, everyone falls backupon these responses without thinking. Or if they think, they feel justified inchoosing the ego. But the fixed, stubborn attitude that results is verydamaging. All of us have been maddened by people who take their egos toextremes, who are as predictable as clocks because no matter what you say or do,they never alter in their opposition, stubbornness, and selfishness. Yet thesame tendencies are preventing you from letting go, too.It’s not that your ego has a totally negative agenda. Under normal circumstancesit doesn’t. Mainly it acts out of self-protection. Some people—a rare few—haveconsciously learned how to cope with the world without protecting themselves.They rely on a higher power to protect them, and that’s what you and I mustlearn to do. Otherwise we’ll never get outside our defenses. We aren’t calledupon to be saintly. It’s not about whether you are a good person or not. It justneeds to sink in that letting go is the path to everything.Let’s see why letting go is so difficult. Think back to the last occasion whenyou rejected somebody because he or she disagreed with you. Or feel inside whatit’s like to refuse your cooperation because you have a powerful urge to oppose.Everyday existence brings up these urges in hundreds of small and large ways.Your ego keeps reinforcing the same argument over and over: Look out for numberone. Nobody else is going to stand up for you. You can’t afford to sacrificewhat you want.Psychologically, these reactions aren’t about the present but the past. Your egois urging you to think and act like a damaged child. Such a child only wantswhat it wants. It has no ability to see beyond the immediate moment, and when itdoesn’t get what it wants, a damaged child pouts, balks, and throws tantrums. Iknow that the phrase “inner child” has been romanticized as an ideal ofinnocence and love. That child, too, exists in all of us; you will see itanytime that the soul shines through. But your inner child has a shadow selfthat embodies the tactics of an angry, wounded, selfish infant. When your egodips into those shadow energies, they impel you to act in very regressive ways.It’s hard, as a well-adjusted adult, to face the fact that you are harboring ashadow that’s not only destructive but childish and irrational, too. Yetsomething positive is close at hand once you make it through the shadows. Everyspiritual tradition invokes our so-called higher self, the side of human naturethat the soul stands for. We recognize ourselves in the love Jesus preached, andin the compassion espoused by Buddha. Every spiritual tradition also makes itclear that our so-called lower nature, identified with sin and ignorance, mustbe transformed. Unfortunately, the choice is presented in a way that’sunhelpful. How can you adopt love when you are told at the same time that yourlower nature is sinful? Condemning the lower self is the opposite of love. Howcan you adopt peace when you are told at the same time to fight againsttemptation? You wind up being trapped in your divided nature instead of healingit.As a practical matter, the part of yourself that you judge against isn’t goingto change. It has no motivation to cooperate—quite the opposite, in fact.Whatever you fight against digs in even more deeply. After all, you arethreatening its survival. Let me offer an example from politics, since the outerworld is easier for most of us to understand than the inner self. In the UnitedStates, deep divisiveness developed between people who supported the second warin Iraq and those who opposed it. Eventually the arguments against the warbecame convincing, if not overwhelming. As an experiment, a group of pro-warvoters were put in a room and asked to rate their support on a scale from 1 to10. They were then given a talk on the reasons for being against the war. Theyear was 2008, five years into the Iraqi conflict, so there was a mountain ofobjective reporting about the most contentious issues, such as weapons of massdestruction, the threat of terrorism, civilian casualties, and so on.The experimenters presented the antiwar position as factually as possible, beingdeliberately dispassionate. At the end of the lecture the group was asked torate their pro-war position a second time on a scale of 1 to 10. The resultsmight startle you, but the group actually became more pro-war. The reason wasn’tthat they necessarily disbelieved the antiwar facts. They just didn’t likehaving their noses rubbed in their mistakes.Likewise, the parts of yourself that feel judged against will not relent. Theywill try to persuade you even harder to be selfish, judgmental, and resentfulwhenever you face outside opposition. Spiritual traditions haven’t taken intoaccount that there’s a process involved in weaning the ego from itsself-defeating ways. By putting the issue in terms of morality, sin, and thethreat of God’s wrath, Christianity has taken the opposite of an effectiveapproach. Buddhism is less inclined to be moralistic, and it possesses anextremely subtle system of psychology. But when simplified, the practice ofBuddhism gets reduced to “ego death,” a direct assault upon the ego as thesource of ignorance and illusion.The whole business of making a stark contrast between the lower and higher selfis futile to begin with. There is no separate, all-good, all-wise part of youthat you must either win or lose. Life is one flow of awareness. No aspect ofyou was constructed out of anything else. Fear and anger are actually made fromthe same pure awareness as love and compassion; erecting a barrier between egoand soul fails to recognize this simple fact. In the end, letting go is achievednot by condemning what’s bad in yourself and throwing it away, but by a processthat brings opposites together. Your ego must see that it belongs to the samereality as your soul. It needs to find so much in common with your soul that itlets go of its selfish agenda in favor of a better way of life.JORDAN’S STORYLetting go is often a last resort, but then something magical can happen.Invisible powers that you never expected can come to your aid.Jordan is a successful career woman in her late thirties, and she has just saveda marriage she had almost given up on. “Mike wasn’t my soul mate. We didn’t fallin love at first sight,” Jordan said. “We met at work, and he asked me outseveral times before I said yes. I had to learn to love him, but once I did, itfelt very real.“A year later we took the plunge. Mike was twenty-nine, I was twenty-six. Wewere in love, but we also sat down and discussed what we wanted out of thismarriage. So when all the trouble began, it really caught me off guard.”“How did it begin?” I asked.“I couldn’t tell you exactly,” Jordan said. “But Mike started behaving like myfather, a man who never listens and never gives in. I had married Mike becausehe seemed to be the exact opposite. Mike was gentle and open. He listened. Butthen he changed. We started fighting a lot, and I got very upset.”“Did he accuse you of changing?” I asked.“He got very bitter about it. I never gave him enough space, he said. But‘space’ doesn’t mean brooding about your work for hours on end and pushing meaway when I wanted to make up after a fight. Mike would hold me for a minute,maybe two. But I could tell he wanted to be alone, to go back to his computer orhis video games.”“So what did you do?” I asked.“I didn’t sink into despair. I told Mike that if we loved each other, we shouldbe able to ask for what we wanted emotionally. I’m not needy, but for God’ssake, if I felt like crying or wanting to be held, he barely responded.”“Maybe he saw your emotions as weak, or as a threat,” I suggested.Jordan agreed. “Mike’s scared of emotions, and he can’t stand weakness. I wasexpected to make him feel like a winner. Anything else was a betrayal. I shouldhave seen that sooner. Mike came from a very rigid family where nobody thoughtthat showing your feelings was a positive thing.”“Eventually you considered leaving him?” I asked.“It happened one evening. He was eating dinner in front of the football game,and no matter what I said, he barely nodded. I stood up and told him to turn offthe damn TV. He just gave this little dismissive laugh. I thought to myself,‘I’m not turning into a cliché. I’ve got my whole life to live.’“It took me a long time to stop feeling sorry for myself. But I had been readinga lot about self-development, and one thing I’d read stuck with me: Accept totalresponsibility for your own life.”“What did that mean to you?” I asked.“What it didn’t mean,” said Jordan, shaking her head, “is that everything was myfault. I was encouraged to looked at things more positively. I was the creatorof my own life. If I wanted my life to change, the means were inside of me. OnceI stopped pitying myself, I realized that this was a test. Mike was in totaldenial. Could I save the marriage myself? Think what a triumph that would be. Ididn’t consult Mike or anybody else. This was my own secret project. So Istarted in on it.”“What did you do?”“I had learned a new term, ‘reactive mind’; this is the mode you’re in when youconstantly react to the other person, which gives them power over you. When Mikepushed my buttons, arguing over who was right and who was wrong, I couldn’t helpbut react. When I was growing up, my mother only had two ways of dealing with abad situation. She either tried to fix it or she put up with it. There’s a thirdway, which is to leave until you’re able to cope. So instead of getting angry atMike or sulking or complaining, I kept my cool, and as soon as I could, I’d getaway and be with myself.”“What did you do then?”“I processed my feelings on my own. The reactive mind is quick to respond, butwhen your first reaction dies down, other responses have room to show up. Iexamined anger as my issue, not Mike’s fault; self-pity came from me, not fromwhat Mike did to me. When Mike and I fought, everything was about defendingmyself, because he can’t stand to lose. The great thing about learning that youcan look inside yourself is that you can give up being so defensive.”“How did your husband react?” I asked.“At first Mike didn’t like that I was holding back. He thought that by notfighting back I was acting superior. But that didn’t last long. After I dealtwith my feelings, I went back in to be with him, and he liked the fact that Ididn’t return with resentment or bottled-up frustration.”“Once you quit tugging at your end of the rope,” I said, “there was no moretug-of-war.”“That was a tough lesson to learn, but yes. Also, we hate in others what we denyin ourselves. I hated it when Mike would come home and instantly startcomplaining that he wanted a warm meal and a loving wife, two things I wasn’tproviding. I felt attacked. But then I asked myself if I wasn’t passivelyattacking him by withholding those things. I was defying him, which made my egofeel good, but all it led to was a hostile standoff.”“You don’t mean that giving in to Mike was the solution, do you?” I said.“In a way, yes, that’s what I do mean,” said Jordan. “I surrendered. I gave ofmyself. But what made that a positive thing was that first I got to the placeinside myself where surrender wasn’t failure. Surrender can mean that you lostthe battle. But it can also mean that you are surrendering to love instead ofhate.” She laughed. “All right, I gritted my teeth the first couple of timesthat I met Mike at the door with a kiss and the smell of fresh-baked bread inthe background. But honestly, before long I felt very good about myself.”Jordan’s rescue mission for her marriage unfolded in many other ways, but we hadcovered the critical part, learning how to let go. This is more than arelationship strategy; a deep personal shift is involved. You release yourselffrom ego-bound reactions—what some call the reactive mind—and allow events tounfold without a preset program. The risks can be terrifying. Everyone has avoice inside warning that to surrender is a sign of weakness. Jordan haddownplayed the fear that arises in such situations. I asked her if things hadbeen at all frightening for her.“That’s what makes it so wonderful to come out the other side,” she said. “Noone knows the terror you go through. Being strong enough to risk your sense ofpride, your image of yourself as a woman who won’t be trampled on—only somebodywho’s gone through it knows how difficult that is.”I agreed. The negative connotations of surrender have been drummed into us. Weequate it not only with losing the battle, but with weakness and lack ofself-respect. In this particular case, surrender of the feminine to themasculine raises every imaginable red flag.“Were you conscious of that?” I asked Jordan.“Oh yes. I had lots of fights with myself, lots of self-doubt. But the bottomline was that I wasn’t surrendering to Mike. I was surrendering to the truth,and the truth is that I want to love and be loved. I was taking responsibilityfor my truth, which brings incredible personal power if you can do it.”Jordan feels proud that she got past all her inner resistance, and her pride isjustified. Her marriage is intact and has blossomed into a far more secure lovethan she knew before. The part that no one else knows, the real mystery, is thatwhen she changed, everything changed. Her husband stopped doing all the thingsshe resented. He looked at her with different eyes, as if he was rediscoveringthe woman he fell in love with.Jordan didn’t have to ask him to do that; it just happened. How? To begin with,there’s a deep connection when two people love each other. We know instinctivelywhether that connection is working or is broken. The connection must be restoredat a deep level, a place the ego can’t reach. Here the element of the soul isinescapable. But why should another person, or an entire situation, change justbecause you do? If each of us owned a soul like private property, then changewould happen one person at a time. But the unbounded soul connects everyone. Itsinfluence is felt everywhere. So, when you change your behavior at the level ofthe soul, the whole dance must change along with you.[images/Chop_9780307452344_epub_L05_r1.jpg]IN YOUR LIFE: “YOU’RE NOT ME”Life brings many situations where letting go isn’t easy. Fortunately, there’sone strategy that always works. Instead of focusing on your reaction in themoment, step back and reassert who you really are. The real you has no agenda.It lives in the present; it responds to life openly. Therefore the attitude youneed to take to any preprogrammed response—which is all your ego has to offer—isalways the same: “You’re not me.” Let fear, anger, jealousy, resentment,victimization, or any conditioned reaction arise. Don’t oppose it. Yet theminute you become aware of it, say, “You’re not me.”With one stroke you accomplish two things. You put the ego on notice that you’veseen through its game, and you call upon your real self to help you. If yoursoul is the real you, then it possesses the power to transform you, once youopen yourself to it. You will know that you are responding from the soul levelwhenever you do the following: * Accept the experience that’s in front of you. * Approve of other people and yourself. * Cooperate with the solution at hand. * Detach yourself from negative influences. * Remain calm in the face of stress. * Forgive those who offend or wrong you. * Approach the situation selflessly, with fairness to all. * Exert a peaceful influence. * Take a nonjudgmental attitude, making no one else feel wrong.These responses can’t be forced or planned ahead—not if you genuinely want to betransformed. It’s self-defeating to adopt them simply because you think theymake you look good. Maddening as it is to run into people who are stubbornlypetty and selfish, forced virtue can be just as maddening. The problem is thatwhat is really needed—letting go—hasn’t happened. The publicly virtuous havesimply found a new ego agenda that makes them look better than they are.When you find yourself reacting from ego, stop and say, “You’re not me.” Thenwhat? There are four steps that allow your soul to bring in a new response. 1. Remain centered. 2. Be clear. 3. Expect the best. 4. Watch and wait.1. Remain centered. By now most people know the value of being centered; it’s astate of calm and stability. When you aren’t centered, you feel scattered andoff-kilter. Feelings fight against each other. There’s no stability in yourreactions because the next event can pull you this way or that. Panic is theultimate state of not being centered, but there are many milder ones, such asdistraction, restlessness, confusion, anxiety, and disorientation.Unfortunately, knowing that it’s better to be centered isn’t the same as gettingthere.Where is this center? For some it’s the middle of the chest, or the heartitself. For others it’s the solar plexus, or simply a general sense of “goinginside.” I’d suggest, however, that the center isn’t physical. Your heart can’tbe your center when it’s racing or in pain. Your solar plexus can’t be yourcenter when your intestines are in a knot. The body always reflectsconsciousness, therefore your center is in awareness. This points us in theright direction, but awareness is always shifting, so the question is, where canyou find calmness and peace that cannot be shaken?You won’t be surprised, I’m sure, to hear that absolute calm and peace arelocated at the soul level, which is reached through meditation. We havediscussed this, but it bears repeating that no matter who you are or in whatevercrisis, this place of peace and calm is never shattered. Even to come near is toexperience its effects. When you want to seek your center, find a quiet placewhere you cannot be disturbed. Close your eyes and feel the part of your bodythat feels stressed. Breathing easily and regularly, release the disturbedenergy from that part of the body.Quite often your mind will contain stressed thoughts. These will usuallydisappear once you settle your body down. If they don’t, then breathe out theenergy that lies behind those thoughts, meaning the energy of fear and anxiety.There’s more than one way to do that.Through the crown chakra: In yoga, the top of the head is considered an energycenter, or chakra. It’s an effective place for releasing energy. Close your eyesand see a beam of white light extending up through your head and exiting througha tiny opening in the crown. The beam of light is narrow, but it gathers all theswirling thoughts in your head and projects them out in one stream through thecrown chakra—you might visualize your thoughts as swirling smoke that the beamof light gathers up and transports away.Breathing: Blow out in a a steady exhale—like blowing out a birthday candle, butslower. Watch the white light of your exhalation streaming upward, taking allyour stressed thoughts with it. Watch the light going up and up beyond the roomuntil you can’t see it anymore.Toning: It also helps to make a high tone at the same time as you breathe out, asoft “Eeeee” sound. The first time or two, you may find this exercise strange,but even if you can’t manage the toning or breathing the first time you try,just using the beam of white light to carry energy up and out of the body can beeffective on its own.2. Be clear. It takes mental clarity to let go. You must be able to tell thetrue from the false, so you can identify what you want to let go. When you areafraid, fear seems to be you. When you are angry, anger takes you over. Butbehind this drama and emotional turmoil, the real you is right there, waitingfor you to connect to yourself.I can illustrate this best through the story of Jacob, a man who came to see meafter suffering from depression his entire adult life; he’s now fifty. Jacobwasn’t asking for therapy. He wanted a handle on how to achieve real change. Itold him that depression can be overcome by letting it go. To do that, he had toclarify a few basic things.“Let’s see how you feel about your depression,” I began. “Imagine that it hastaken the shape of a person who walks in the door and sits down on a chairfacing you.”Jacob closed his eyes and started to visualize. After a few minutes he told methat he saw his depression as a gnarled, hunched-over old man who had shuffledinto the room. The old man was smelly and dressed in filthy army fatigues.“Good,” I said. ‘Now that you see him, how do you feel about him?” Jacob said hefelt bad. “Don’t tell me,” I said. “Tell him.”At first Jacob was hesitant. But with a bit of coaxing, he told the old man,“You scare me to death, and you exhaust me. My mind races with anxiety, andwhile others see me as someone listless and passive, I feel like I’m wrestlingwith a demon every moment of the day.” Once he got started, Jacob’s accusationsintensified. He poured out his feelings of hostility and anguish. He spokebitterly of how impossible it was for him to express his pain, so helpless didthe gnarled old man make him feel.I let Jacob get everything out, until he was spent. ‘You will never get pastyour depression unless you let this old man inside you go,” I said. “To theextent that you push this old man away and revile him, he will remain the same.The problem has been turned into a part of yourself, but it’s not who you reallyare.”Jacob grew quiet. We were old friends, so I could talk to him intimately. I toldhim that he didn’t think he was holding on to his depression, but this old manwas an aspect of himself. It was a creation of a distorted self-image, and overthe years it had gained so much energy that it seemed to have a life of its own.“Your depression makes you feel helpless because you believe that you have nochoice. You can’t remember not being depressed. In reality, you do have achoice. You can negotiate with the old man and tell him that it’s time to leave.You can release the energy of depression. You can meditate and find the levelinside your awareness that isn’t depressed. But if you continue to think thatbeing depressed is a permanent part of you, that’s a choice, too. You need totake responsibility for it.” I was trying to give Jacob enough clarity to facehis depression, to say to it, “You’re not me.”This talk was only the beginning. Off and on we made contact again, then Jacobdropped out of sight for a while. Recently he resurfaced, and it was obviousthat he was no longer depressed. His energy was stronger and more positive. “Didthat one conversation turn the tide?” I asked him.“I think so,” Jacob said with quiet conviction. “The timing must have been justright, because I surrendered. The fight went out of me. I had been leadingmyself on with the hope that one day I’d defeat my depression. But you wereright. Hating my depression had done absolutely no good.”During the time that I hadn’t seen him, Jacob had pulled his life together. Heentered into a serious relationship; he began to work for a spiritual cause hebelieved in. He decided to ignore his depression and minimize the hold it hadover him. But the critical thing was a change of attitude. He began to accepthimself, to see that depression wasn’t his real self.“I got clear about a lot of things. I became gentler and easier with myself. Istopped pushing and judging myself. It took time. Nothing happened all at once.But as I opened up a space inside myself, something new entered the picture. Igave my mind permission to settle down, and it quit racing so much. It quitbeing so desperate. Once I felt calmer, it was like slowly waking up. The worldgot brighter. Gradually, being happy became possible. That’s the best way that Ican put it.”Clarity, because it’s internal, brings home the truth that can’t be absorbedwhen you are confused or agitated. You see that you can’t change what you hatein yourself. Many people who suffer have firsthand experience with the futilityof warring with themselves. The breakthrough comes when they accept that thething they hate has no real independent existence. This is not me. It’s how I amtemporarily. It’s my energy until I let it go.If you are an alcoholic and say, “Drinking is who I am. Put up with it,” youaren’t moving toward healing. Your defensiveness is a secret form ofhelplessness. Deep down, you think change is doomed to fail. What’s needed is adifferent attitude, or rather no attitude. You become clear that there’s abundle of energy, emotions, habits, and feelings to let go of, and that’s all.Naturally, one moment of clarity doesn’t shift everything. What took years todevelop takes time to undo. But with clarity comes acceptance, and even a smallstep toward acceptance opens a channel to the soul.3. Expect the best. You don’t let go so that something good might happen. Youlet go so that the very best in yourself, your soul, can merge with you. Byitself, letting go of a bit of anger, a bit of fear, a bit of resentment, mightseem tiny. I’d reframe the situation. Imagine that you are used to living in asmall, cramped house. You’ve become so used to this claustrophobic space thatyou almost never go outside. Yet there are carefree moments when you think itwould be nice to experience a wider world. So you open the door, and as you stepoutside, you confront a vast landscape, filled with light and extending toinfinity in all directions.Ah, you think, here is joy and love. Here is real fulfillment. So you roamoutside, wanting to abide in this land of light forever. Yet after a while youget tired of all this love and joy. Somehow the space outside is too vast, thehorizon too infinite. You miss your familiar house, and it pulls you back. Soyou return, and it feels safe to be back. You resume your familiar existence.For a time you’re content again, but you keep remembering that vast, unlimitedspace outside. Once again you step out, and this time you stay there longer.Your sense of love and joy isn’t so tiring. The space outside is still infinite,but that doesn’t frighten you so much. The light that shines everywhere isn’t soblinding, and you resolve that this time you will abide here forever.This is a parable about the ego and the soul. The ego is your safe house; thesoul is the unbounded space outside. Every time you feel even a moment of joyand love, freedom and bliss, you have stepped into the land of light. You feelso wonderful that you want to keep the experience going, the way two infatuatedlovers never want to be apart. But your ego, your safe house, calls you back.This pattern of coming and going is how letting go works. It takes repeatedexposure to the unbounded soul for you to know that it is real. But your oldconditioning will keep pulling you back. In time, your trips outside will lastlonger and feel more comfortable. Your soul is starting to seep into you; withthis merging you begin to understand that you can live in the unboundedpermanently. It becomes more natural than your safe house because in theunbounded you are the real you.Therefore, expecting the best isn’t about wishful thinking or optimism. It’sabout recognizing in advance that your goal is attainable. The unbounded soul isexperienced, however faintly, in every impulse of the soul. This counters theprevailing attitude in psychology that happiness is a temporary state stumbledupon by accident. I find that attitude deplorable. To declare that love and joy,the primal components of happiness, are occasional is a teaching born ofdesperation. Keep in mind the image of the safe house and the land of light thatsurrounds it. No one will ever force you to let go of the limited space youoccupy, but you always have the choice to seek the infinite, because that is whoyou are.4. Watch and wait. Surrendering in battle happens once, at the very end.Surrendering on the spiritual path happens over and over, and it never ends. Forthis reason, watching and waiting isn’t a passive act. It’s not an exercise inpatience, or a kind of down time until the big event starts. The moment you letgo of some old habit or conditioning, the instant you catch yourself in aprogrammed reaction, the self shifts. As casually as we use the word self, itisn’t a simple thing but a complex, dynamic system. Your self is a microuniverse mirroring the macro universe. Countless forces are moving through it.As fluid as air, the self changes with every shift in awareness.Therefore, whenever you let go, you are subtracting something old from theuniverse and adding something new. The old is dark energy and distorted patternsfrom the past. These are dead bits that got stuck inside the self’s system.Having no way to eject them, you worked around them. You adjusted to negativeelements in yourself—usually through denial and by pushing these elements downout of sight—because you assumed that you had to. Letting go isn’t an optionuntil you learn how to make it an option. Once you do let them go, the negativeenergies depart permanently.Which allows something new to enter. What will it be? That’s what watching andwaiting reveals. Think of what happens when you breathe in. New oxygen atomsenter your bloodstream, but where they go isn’t predetermined. An oxygen atomcan wind up in any one of billions of cells. Its destination is determined bywhich cell needs it the most. The same is true of you. When you open space forthe soul by letting go of old energies, the part of you in greatest need, thepart that wants most eagerly to grow or most seriously wants healing, willbenefit.To take an example on a larger scale, I’ve often thought that Jesus became thegreatest teacher of love because that’s what his audience needed most. Theyweren’t starved for divine wisdom, spiritual discipline, or enlightenment—all ofwhich became dominant in other traditions like Buddhism. At a more human level,Jesus’ listeners wanted God’s love, and so that’s what they absorbed. No doubtJesus was as complete a teacher as Buddha. He taught the way to higherconsciousness, even enlightenment. But that part has to be searched out in thecorners of his teaching; the foreground is occupied by love in every form.To know what your soul is, you must follow the path it takes as it enters you.Will it make you more loving and kind? Will it make you more devout andworshipful? Any quality can be imparted by the soul—strength, truth, beauty, orfaith. But these aren’t laid on like a coat of paint. Rather, they enter you asoxygen enters your body, seeking out what is most needed. We speak of beingfilled with spirit, as if all it takes is pumping a person up the way you pumpup a bicycle tire. In reality, spirit is awareness traveling to places whereawareness is lacking. It speeds your growth enormously if you are there toreceive the healing when it arrives.Too often, people don’t watch and wait. They miss what’s really happening insidethem. They fixate on wishes and fantasies, and while their attention isdistracted, the real thing passes them by. I love the story of Harold Arlen, afamous Hollywood composer in the golden era of movies, who was assigned to writethe music for The Wizard of Oz. Arlen worked steadily at it, and he thought hehad done a good job. But one song was lacking, the special one that he knew thescore needed, the topper. Nothing would come, so Arlen gave up for the day andtook his wife to lunch. On the way down Sunset Boulevard he suddenly told hiswife, who was at the wheel, to pull over. Arlen scribbled some notes on a scrapof paper, which turned out to be the music for a song called “Somewhere Over theRainbow.”In many ways, artists and creators know best how to receive the soul, becausethey attune themselves to inspiration. Inspiration doesn’t happen randomly. It’salways a matter of call and response. The need goes out, and the solutionappears. So take a creative attitude toward your own inner growth. Be aware ofyour need and watch for the response. When asked how he came up with such greatmusic, Harold Arlen said, “I drift, wait, and obey.” It wouldn’t hurt to takeheed of that credo, which is simple but profound."},{"pageContent":"BREAKTHROUGH #4THE FRUIT OF SURRENDER IS GRACEA breakthrough can lead you to the ultimate surrender. Because letting go is aprocess, it eventually comes to an end. But this end point is very differentfrom anything one would anticipate. You won’t be the person you see in themirror today. That person goes through life with endless needs. In the ultimatesurrender, you give up all needs. For the first time you will be able to say, “Iam enough.” You will find yourself in a world where everything fits together asit should.A completely new self can’t be imagined in advance. A young child has no ideathat the future will bring the drastic changes triggered by puberty. It would beconfusing to try to understand that until the experience is at hand (there’sconfusion enough when that moment arrives). Letting go of childhood comesnaturally, if you are lucky. Letting go of your adult identity is much moredifficult. We have no maps to guide us, although there is certainly a call fromthe world’s great spiritual teachers. Saint Paul compares it to growing up.“When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasonedlike a child; when I became an adult, I put an end to childish ways.”Going from child to adult means changing your identity, but Paul is pointing toa far more shattering kind of transformation. He says, “Pursue love and strivefor the spiritual gifts,” and then holds out a vision of what will happen ifsomeone heeds the call.Love is patient; love is kind; love is not envious or boastful or arrogant orrude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; itdoes not rejoice in wrongdoing, but rejoices in the truth. It bears all things,believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. (i CORINTHIANS 13:4–7)Paul was well aware that he was calling for supernatural change. All of humannature would be transformed, and the only power capable of doing that was grace.You cannot find the word “grace” in the Bible without its connotations closeby—abundance, purity, unconditional love, a gift freely given. There’s somethinguniversal here that goes beyond Judeo-Christianity. By letting go completely, aperson can achieve a new identity. The fruit of surrender is grace, theall-embracing power of God.Grace is the invisible influence of the divine. Once it enters a person’s life,the old tools that we have used to run our lives—reason, logic, effort,planning, forethought, discipline—are discarded like the training wheels of abicycle. But the actual process is shadowy and amorphous. Grace is associatedwith mercy and forgiveness, but in reality, if you strip it of religiousovertones, grace is unbounded awareness.Grace abolishes life’s limitations. There is nothing to fear, nothing to beguilty of. The whole issue of good versus evil disappears. Peace is no longer adream to be chased, but an innate quality of the heart. These things are theresult not of supernatural intervention, but of coming to the end of a process.The word grace occurs almost a hundred times in the Old Testament, but,curiously, Jesus doesn’t use it even once. One explanation is that we meet Jesusafter he has come to the end of the process of finding his unbounded self; he isunique that way.Grace, like the soul itself, steps down God’s infinite power to human scale. Itcarries more than a whiff of magic, as befits a total transformation. The humanmind barely grasps how a caterpillar can transform into a butterfly, much lessthe miracle of how human beings are transformed by grace. Somehow nothing moreis required except surrender. But the process of being born again is recorded inevery culture, so let’s see if we can come closer to understanding it.SELF-TRANSFORMATIONBefore it is touched by grace, human nature is fallen, corrupt, sinful, impure,ignorant, guilty, and blind—those are the traditional terms inJudeo-Christianity. What makes them unhelpful is that they are based onmorality. The word boundary is neutral; it simply refers to a state oflimitation. If you take a person and force him to live in severe limitation—say,in a dungeon—all kinds of problems will develop, from paranoia to delusion. Butthey aren’t because the prisoner is morally defective. They result from beingbound up. The difference between a prisoner captive in his cell and you or me isthat we have voluntarily chosen to live inside our boundaries. The part of ourselves that made this choice is the ego.The ego is your familiar self, the “I” that goes through the world and dealswith everyday events. As long as this self feels satisfied, there’s nooverriding reason to seek the soul. But is life satisfying? Every greatspiritual teacher begins with the assumption that it isn’t. Jesus and Buddhaconfronted a world where ordinary people were beset by disease and poverty.Simply to survive being born and then live to age thirty was a major challenge.It wasn’t difficult to convince such an audience that everyday life was steepedin suffering. That problem remains constant, even in modern societies that havemade substantial inroads against disease, poverty, and hunger.Buddha and Jesus weren’t concerned with the material causes of suffering.Instead, they traced the cause to its very root, the “I” that handles everydaylife. That “I” is a false identity, they said. It masks the real self, which canonly be found at the soul level. But this diagnosis didn’t lead to anything likea quick cure. The self isn’t like a car that can be taken apart and rebuilt as abetter model. “I” has an agenda. It thinks it knows how to run everyday life,and when threatened with disassembly, it fights back—after all, survival itselfis at stake. For this reason, ego became the great enemy of change (more in theEast than the West; in the West, sin and evil took on that role, again for moralreasons). It became obvious that the ego was a subtle opponent, because it hadbecome so pervasive. A person’s identity isn’t like a cloak that can be takenoff. Transforming your identity is more like performing surgery on yourself; youmust act as both doctor and patient. This is an impossible task in the physicalworld, but entirely possible in awareness.Awareness looks at itself, and when it does, it can search out flaws and fixthem. The reason it can mend itself is that only awareness is involved. There isno need to go outside the self, no need to be asleep to block the pain, and noneed for violence against the body.Before surgery begins, you need a disease or defect. The ego, for all its claimsto running everyday life, has a glaring defect. Its vision of life isunworkable. What it promises as a completely fulfilling life is an illusion, awill-o’-the-wisp you can chase all your life without ever laying hands on it.When you become aware of this defect, the result is fatal for the ego. It can’tcompete with the soul’s vision of fulfillment. We have all been conditioned tobelieve that it’s the ego that is practical and realistic in its approach tolife, while the soul is unattainable and detached from everyday affairs. Butthat is a complete reversal of the truth. Let me illustrate.TWO VISIONS OF FULFILLMENTThe ego’s vision:I have everything I need to be comfortable.I am serene because bad things can’t come near me.Through hard work, anything can be achieved.I measure myself by my accomplishments.I win much more often than I lose.I have a strong self-image.Because I’m attractive, I win the attention of the opposite sex.When I find the perfect love, it will be on my terms.The soul’s vision:I am everything I need.I am secure because I have nothing to fear in myself.The flow of life’s abundance brings me everything.I do not measure myself by any external standard.Giving is more important than winning.I have no self-image; I am beyond images.Other people are attracted to me as soul to soul.I can find perfect love, because I have discovered it first in myself.It’s fair to say, I think, that the second vision describes life in a state ofgrace. It stands for life transformed, not life as presided over by the ego.Yet, looking at the two choices, most people would find the ego’s version morereasonable. For one thing, they are already quite used to it. Familiarity, addedto inertia, keeps most of us doing the same things every day. But that aside,what makes the ego’s path to fulfillment seem easy is that it is based onimproving the conditions of life step by step. If you have a modest job today,it will become more important tomorrow. A small first home will one day turninto a larger home. If you run into problems or obstacles along the way, theycan be overcome. Hard work, diligence, loyalty, and faith in progress combine tomake life better.This is the ego’s version of personal growth: however limited your life may be,in time it will steadily get better. Yet this vision, so focused on externals,ignores what’s actually happening with the inner person. There is no correlationbetween fulfillment and external progress. A country as impoverished as Nigeriaranks higher among societies on a scale of happiness than the United States (asmeasured by polls that ask people how happy they are). As far as money goes,people get happier as they rise above the level of poverty, but once the basicwants of life are secure, adding more money actually decreases one’s chance ofbeing happy. Studies of people who have won the lottery find that within a yearor two, not only are they worse off materially, but the majority say they wishthey had never won in the first place. (Needless to say, these findings are notwidely promoted by the lotteries themselves.)We pay dearly for latching on to externals as the measure of who we are.Downturns in the economy create widespread fear and panic. In personalrelationships, love fades when the other person stops providing enough emotionalinput and personal attention—those external supports without which the egofalters. When conflicts arise, people suffer in silence or fight futilely to getthe other person to change. The ego insists that a better spouse, a biggerhouse, and more money will bring the satisfaction you long for. What doesn’toccur to people is that failing to be satisfied might not be their fault or thefault of their circumstances. They might simply have chosen the wrong path tobegin with.The ego’s vision of fulfillment is unattainable because each isolated “I” is onits own, cut off from the source of life. The steady improvement being promisedcan only be external, because there’s no security inside. How can there be? Theonly way the ego can deal with the psyche’s disorder and discontent is to wallit off. The “I” is full of secret compartments where fear and anger, regret andjealousy, insecurity and helplessness are forced to hide. Thus we see recordlevels of anxiety and depression in our society, conditions treated with drugsthat just build a thicker wall around the problem. The moment the lulling effectof the drug is removed, depression and anxiety return.The soul’s vision of fulfillment seems far more difficult, and yet it unfoldsautomatically once you reach the level of the soul. Fulfillment is not a matterof self-improvement. It involves a shift away from the ego’s agenda, turningfrom externals to the inner world. The soul holds out a kind of happiness thatisn’t dependent on whether conditions outside are good or bad. The path of thesoul leads to a place where you experience fulfillment as a birthright, as partof who you are. You don’t have to work for it; you only have to be.Grace comes from a clear vision of who you really are.ANNETTE’S STORYKnowing who you really are is the only way to be completely happy. Currentlythere’s a popular notion that travels under the rubric of “stumbling onhappiness,” the title of a 2006 book by Harvard professor Daniel Gilbert. Thecore idea is that happiness arrives almost by chance—we stumble on it in thedark, as it were—because people don’t really know what will make them happy.This is largely a failure of foresight, Gilbert tells us. We think a milliondollars will make us happy, but the day when we actually get a million dollarsturns out to be far different from what we saw in advance. The sun doesn’tbecome twice as bright; life doesn’t lose its nagging imperfections. Ifanything, the day you get a million dollars is worse than an ordinary daybecause it falls so short of being extraordinary.I have no problem with the observation that people lack the tools to makethemselves happy, or with the notion that we rarely see in advance what willactually create happiness. The sentimental image of the sad millionaire is realenough. The most memorable moments of shining happiness do occur unexpectedly.But it’s completely wrong, in my view, to assert that human life must be flawedin this way. The deeper truth is that we stumble on identity. We cobble togethera self, using the imperfect plans laid down by the ego. We are motivated bymemories of what hurt in the past and what felt good, which impel us to repeatthe good things and avoid the bad. As a result, “I” is a product of accident,fickle likes and dislikes, old conditioning, and the countless voices of otherpeople who told us what to do and how to be. At bottom, this whole structure istotally unreliable and, in fact, unreal. Having seen through this jerry-riggedself, you should let it go completely. It is the wrong ship to take you to thefar shore of fulfillment, and it always was.“For years I was having a problem in relationships. Basically I never felt lovedenough,” said Annette, a successful, independent woman I know from teaching ameditation group. “The last man I was involved with only chose me because thewoman he wanted to marry got engaged to somebody else. I began to feel that Ihad never mattered to him at all. So when we broke up, I went to see atherapist.“She asked me what I wanted to achieve in therapy. That’s not an easy question,but I knew that I didn’t feel loved, so I told her that I wanted to get overthat feeling. The therapist asked me what being loved meant to me. Did I want tobe protected, taken care of, coddled? None of those things, I said. To me, beingloved means that you are understood. The words just popped out, but they feltright. When I was growing up, nobody understood me at all. My parents were nicepeople, and they did their best. But their love didn’t include understanding whoI was. They were too concerned with me finding the right man, making a hometogether, and raising a family.”“So you started on an inner journey,” I said.Annette nodded. “My therapist turned out to be great. We uncovered all my hiddenissues—I kept back nothing. I really trusted her. For months I relivedeverything about my past. There were lots of revelations and lots of tears.”“But you felt you were achieving something,” I said.“As I released my old stuff, the sense of release was incredible,” said Annette.“Before I knew it, five years had passed, hundreds of sessions. One afternoon Iwas in my therapist’s office when it hit me. ‘You understand me completely,’ Isaid to her. ‘I have no more secrets to tell, no more shameful thoughts andforbidden desires.’ At that moment I didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.”“Why was that?” I asked.“Here this woman totally understands me,” said Annette. “I have what I’ve alwayswanted, and yet what had come of it? I wasn’t suddenly happier or morecontented. That’s what made me want to cry. What made me want to laugh washarder to explain.”“You had come to an end point,” I suggested. “That implies the start of a newlife.”“I think so. It took a while for it to sink in. But then I noticed that when I’dget in a situation that used to make me angry, instead of flaring up, a voiceinside me would say, ‘Why are you doing this again? You know where it comesfrom.” The voice was right. I knew myself too well now. Going back to my oldreactions wasn’t possible.”This proved to be a major turning point. Annette had earned the rare privilegeof being able to reexamine herself from the ground up. She had come to the endof everything the ego-self had built up over the years. Once she saw it for whatit was—a haphazard, flimsy construct unrelated to her real self—she could moveon. Her mind was no longer tied to the past.The mind can be used for many things, but most people mainly use it as astorehouse. They fill it with memories and experiences, along with all thethings they like and dislike. What makes us save some parts of our past anddiscard others? It’s not that we hold on to pleasurable experiences and throwaway painful ones. There’s a personal attachment to both. Without attachment,the past would simply fade away. I don’t mean that you would have amnesia.Attachment is psychological. It preserves the pain that still hurts, and thepleasure that hopes to be repeated. Being in the past, however, your mentalstorehouse is filled with a jumble of things that no longer serve you.I said something like this to Annette, and she absolutely agreed. “It had beenmy fantasy that the real me was hiding out somewhere in my past. If someonewiser and stronger than me was handed all the pieces, they’d hand me back acomplete person.”Getting beyond the ego-self means leaving stale illusion behind and beginning toface a fresh reality. We’re all clinging to images of ourselves that pile upyear after year. Some images make us look good, some make us look bad. Butimages can’t substitute for the real thing. The real you is vital and alive,shifting and changing at every moment. What fascinates me about Annette is thatshe’s one of the few people I’ve ever met who came to the end of the ego-self.Working with her therapist, she exhausted everything it had to offer. Ineveryone’s life, the ego extends its lease by saying, “Hold on. Keep trying. Iknow what to do.” But stand back and consider what this strategy comes down to:If all your hard work hasn’t brought you what you want, work harder.If you don’t have enough, get more. If your dream fails, keep following it.If you grow insecure, believe in yourself more.Never acknowledge failure; success is the only option.This kind of ego motivation, turned into slogans, is deeply ingrained in popularculture. Following your dream and never giving up has become a credo repeated bythe rich, famous, and successful. Yet for every winner of a beauty pageant,stock-car race, World Series, or Hollywood audition, there are an untold numberwhose dream didn’t come true. They followed their dream just as hard andbelieved in it just as much. By no means did the ego’s strategy work for them.Fortunately, there’s another way; it’s the exact opposite of the ego’s strategy:If all your hard work hasn’t brought you what you want, look for newinspiration.If you don’t have enough, find it in yourself.If your dream fails, and you see that it was a fantasy, find a dream thatmatches your reality.If you grow insecure, detach yourself from the situation until you find yourcenter again.You are not shaken by either success or failure; the flow of life brings both,as temporary states.The real self is a shifting, elusive phantom that’s always one step ahead of us.It dissolves the instant you think you’re about to grab it. (I’ve heard Goddescribed that way, as someone we constantly run after, only to discover thatwherever he—or she—was last seen, he just left.) You can’t ever nail down whoyou really are. To understand your real self, you have to keep up as it moves.Finding the real you happens on the run. The same holds true for grace, since itis part of the real you.PLACING YOUR FAITHWe have arrived at a point that will be uncomfortable for many people. A fluid,shifting self represents a radical change from the fixed, secure self that theego promises to provide for us. Feeling the ground beneath your feet suddenlysoften is disturbing. Yet the process of letting go leads us to this point. Ashift of allegiance is called for. Surrender brings the descent of grace, butnot in one flash. Grace is a way of life that relies on none of the ego’s oldprops. Jesus put it succinctly:Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy andwhere thieves break in and steal; but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven,where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in andsteal.(MATTHEW 6:19–20)Our old way of life centered on saving, planning, looking ahead, providing forsecurity, and relying on material goods must give way to a new one based ontrust in Providence, no planning or looking ahead, and nonphysical treasures.The same theme is reiterated throughout the Sermon on the Mount. I said earlierthat Saint Paul doesn’t provide a process by which grace overtakes a person. Thesame holds true for Jesus as we meet him in the Gospels. Deep transformation isnecessary, yet the steps to get a person from here to there aren’t outlined.Instead, Jesus and Paul put the primary emphasis on faith.Faith is an inner certainty that such radical change can and will happen. Butfaith needn’t be blind. Nor does it have to be based on anything outsideyourself. By going through the process of letting go, you will find that thereare reasons to have faith here and now.Faith in your experience. Letting go brings the experience of being tuned in toyour soul. As a result, the soul begins to play a bigger role in your life.Gradually but steadily, you begin to have some of the following experiences:I feel inspired.I see the truth of spiritual teaching.I sense that I have a higher self.A deeper reality is dawning.My inner life brings satisfaction.I understand things in a new way.I greet each day with fresh energy.My life feels more whole.Sometimes I tell people to write these things down on a slip of paper to carryaround with them. If they can pull out the list and connect with just one itemon the list, they are tuned in. If not, then it’s time to start tuning in. Theflow of life is self-renewing. It brings fresh energy every day to address freshchallenges. But when the soul connection isn’t being made, that energy doesn’tarise as it should.Where does faith enter in? When you are aligned with your soul, life feelsunbounded, and your awareness exudes carefree joy and confidence. But when youtune out, these qualities disappear. In those moments, have faith in your ownexperience, which tells you firsthand that being unbounded is real. It’s a stateof awareness you can return to. I find that the ego-self is like a small,comfortable hut, while what the soul offers is a vast landscape with an infinitehorizon. All of us retreat into our hut from time to time. Sometimes we do thisunder stress, sometimes from pure habit. The psyche is unpredictable enough thatyou can find yourself feeling insecure for no good reason.Fortunately, the reason doesn’t matter. Once you’ve experienced freedom, youwill be drawn there again. You will find it more comfortable to expand, and astime goes on, the temptation to retreat back into your hut will weaken. There’sno need to put pressure on yourself. Freedom speaks for itself; the impulse toexperience it is built into you and will never die. That’s the first and mostimportant thing to have faith in.Faith in your knowledge. People who pride themselves on being rational oftenreject spirituality because it isn’t backed up by hard facts. Their argument hasa blind spot, however, because not all facts can be measured. It may be a factthat the North Pole is located at 90 degrees north latitude, but it’s also afact that each of us thinks, feels, wishes, and dreams, and upon this invisiblereality all external facts depend. The North Pole would have no location withouta mind to measure it. As you walk the path, you acquire knowledge that can berelied upon. Some crucial knowledge has been communicated in these pages, butit’s left to you to verify it. What kinds of facts do I have in mind?Awareness can change the body.Subtle action can bring you more love and compassion.Distorted energy patterns can be healed.The flow of life supplies unlimited energy creativity, and intelligence.Every problem contains a hidden solution.Awareness can be either contracted or expanded.There’s another way to live that your ego doesn’t know about.By this point, none of these statements should sound mystical. Even if you feeltentative about one or more of them, have faith that real knowledge does existin the realm of awareness. The awareness you were born with as a child hasexpanded over the years. You have added new skills and neural pathways to yourbrain. Neurologists have confirmed that spiritual practices like meditation arereal in physical terms; so is a spiritual attainment like compassion.Therefore, the process of awakening the soul requires little extra faith. It’s anatural extension of findings that have a solid foundation in science. Not thatthis should be your final proof. I was inspired long ago by a phrase from theFrench philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau: he said that each person was born totest a “soul hypothesis.” In other words, you and I are grand experiments,conducted inside ourselves, to prove whether there is a soul. The experimentrenews itself in every age. Once it was based on faith in God and scripture. Nowit is based on faith that consciousness can grow and evolve. The terms haveshifted, but not the challenge.Faith in yourself. Popular culture constantly drums into us that having faith inyourself leads to the highest achievement. But the self in question really meansthe ego, with its unquenchable craving to win, own, consume, and find pleasure.That’s the last thing to put your faith in. Better to reframe the whole issue asfaith in a self you have yet to meet. Nobody needs to have faith in theego-self; its demands are constant. But the self you have not yet met doesrequire faith, because it is the end point of transformation. Until you undergothis transformation, you are a caterpillar dreaming of turning into a butterfly.How can you have faith in a self you haven’t met? That’s such a personalquestion that the answer will be different for everyone. So let me put thequestion differently: What would convince you that you have changed at a deeplevel, and permanently? Here are some answers that most people, I think, wouldfind valid:I am not in pain anymore.I don’t feel conflicted anymore.I overcame a weakness and became strong.Guilt and shame have disappeared.My mood isn’t anxious anymore.Depression has lifted.I have found a vision I believe in.I experience clarity in place of confusion.These changes are all rooted in the self, because the conditions that need thedeepest change—depression, anxiety, conflict, confusion—feel like part of “me.”A person doesn’t catch them like catching a cold. They may submit to temporarydistractions, but the affliction returns. Freud called anxiety an unwelcomevisitor who refuses to leave. Every step you take in throwing out an unwelcomevisitor is a step of faith in yourself. You are succeeding in letting go. Morethan that, a new “me” is gradually being revealed. For it turns out that thetransformed self isn’t like a passenger waiting for the train to arrive. Yournew self is revealed one aspect at a time.Spiritual tradition holds that the soul possesses every virtue. It is beautiful,truthful, strong, loving, wise, understanding, and imbued with the presence ofGod. Those qualities cannot be taken away. They cannot be bought or acquired byyour ego, either, except on a provisional basis. The most loving person canexchange love for hate. The strongest person can be crushed. But as your realself is revealed, all these qualities become unconditional. You won’t be awarethat they’ve descended upon you—grace isn’t a shower of cool water or whitelight. Rather, you will simply be yourself. Yet when love is called for, lovewill be there in you, ready to express itself. When strength is called for,strength will be there. Otherwise, you will feel nothing special. Life goes onas it does for everyone. But inside, in a way hard to describe, you are totallysecure. You know that you possess everything you need to confront life’sdifficulties.The modern Sufi teacher A. H. Almass expresses this beautifully in an essaytitled “Hanging Loose”:When your mind is free, not concerned or worried, or focused on anything inparticular, and your heart is not grasping or clinging to anything, then you arefree… Whatever is there, is there. The mind isn’t saying, “I want this” or “Iwant to look at this” or “It has to be this way.” The mind is loose. Theexpression “hang loose” tells us what it means to be liberated.The process of surrender gets you to the point that you can hang loose, withoutthe urge to grab at things and worry over them. The ego’s agenda falls away.This takes time, but it comes eventually. Long before that moment, your mindlearns what it’s like to be quiet, comfortable, and loose. You coast alongenjoying this state, and as you do, grace brings in the real you to fill thespace once occupied by the mind’s churning. To your surprise, you go into asituation where love is called for, and you have that love. It is part of you(just as you suspected in your heart of hearts). In the same inexplicable way,courage has become part of you, and also truth. The promises of the greatspiritual teachers, who told you that grace is freely given, come tofulfillment. Then you know, once and for all, that placing faith in yourself wasfully justified. So it must be justified at this moment, wherever you may be onthe journey.[images/Chop_9780307452344_epub_L05_r1.jpg]IN YOUR LIFE: MEETING GRACE HALFWAYGrace brings about personal transformation, but this happens so quietly thateven the most blessed people may not recognize it, or if they do, they mayforget. It’s beneficial to put any blessing to work. In that way it becomes apart of you that goes out into the world. You represent grace through youractions, not as a private possession to be admired behind closed doors.If you want to display grace, you need to manifest the qualities of grace. Thewords associated with grace in the New Testament provide a guide: * Merciful * Freely bestowed * Available to all * Generous * ForgivingI’m not holding these out as moral virtues or as a duty. Rather, they are alitmus test. You can measure how much grace has come into your life by the easewith which these actions can be performed. There’s a big difference betweengiving from the ego and giving from the soul, between showing mercy andextending forgiveness. The difference can be felt inside, and it’s unmistakable.Showing mercy. Most people show mercy because it’s less trouble, or it makesthem feel magnanimous. The ego gets something out of it, in any event. The imageof a condemned man in court comes to mind. He hangs his head. At that moment thejudge holds all the power, and whether he is harsh or lenient, that power isvalidated. But the mercy that comes from grace is selfless. You empathize withthe wrongdoer. You see his vulnerability and desperation. You understand thatmore people are changed by an act of mercy than by years of punishment. Inshort, you see shared humanity in another person, and that requires the eyes ofthe soul.Not that mercy must follow the model of a courtroom. You are showing mercy whenyou don’t point out someone else’s faults, when you refuse to blame even thoughblame is deserved, when you refrain from gossiping and bringing someone downbehind his back. It’s merciful to see the best motives in a person, to give thebenefit of the doubt, to look for positive change. In all these instances, youtake the nonjudgmental view. Hamlet says, “Use every man after his desert, andwho shall escape whipping?” It’s a gift of grace not to use every man accordingto what he deserves, but as mercy pleads.Bestowing freely. The ego looks out on a world of barter, where everything has aprice and quid pro quo is the rule. This doesn’t apply to grace. It is givenfreely, without a thought about what will be given in return. It’s unfortunatethat the New Testament rests its argument on the sinful nature of man. SaintPaul’s notion is that we are all so degraded that we deserve God’s wrath andpunishment, but, like a loving father, God forgives his errant children. Thiskind of moral scheme speaks to many people. They feel the weight of their faultsand wrongdoing. God becomes the more lovable by overlooking all their sins anderasing them through the power of grace.There’s no need for morality to enter into it, however. It is in the nature ofthe soul to give freely in the same way that a river gives water. Establish achannel, and the water flows. The ego gets tangled up in questions of whodeserves what, calculating how much to give and take away. Grace is free withits gifts. It helps to remember that the universe supplies you with everything,and whether your ego thinks you got enough or not is irrelevant. Your body hasbeen freely sustained with energy, intelligence, and nourishment since themoment of your inception. To the extent that human beings are deprived, the rootcause is ultimately ourselves, or our circumstances. It’s not in the setup oflife that unfolded for billions of years before human beings came on the scene.As freely as one breath comes and the next one goes, you can act from grace bygiving without attachment.Available to all. Grace is the great leveler. It recognizes no differences, butgives itself to anyone who has surrendered. (In Christian metaphor, the rainfalls on the just and unjust.) On the other hand, our ego places criticalimportance on being special. We want someone who loves us more than anyone elsein the world. We crave status, recognition, a sense of uniqueness. Yet from thesoul’s perspective, uniqueness is a universal trait. You are a singular creationno matter what you do; there’s no need to prove it to anyone else.When you make someone feel that he or she is your equal, you exhibit thisquality of grace. This holds true whether you are reaching down or reaching up.It’s not a question of noblesse oblige, or of giving to the poor because youhave so much more. In the eyes of the soul, equality is simply a fact, and youare acknowledging it. When the ego dominates, we all assess where we stand, highor low, in any situation. We are drawn to people who reflect back our ownself-image. We subtly put others in their place. Under the influence of gracethis behavior changes, because you genuinely feel no higher and no lower thananyone else. A tremendous relief accompanies this realization. So much energy iswasted protecting our dignity, status, pride, and accomplishments. Whendefending yourself from a fall becomes pointless, you’ve made an enormousadvance toward liberation.Generous. To be generous is to allow your spirit to overflow. You can begenerous at every level of life—giving someone the benefit of your joy is justas good as giving them money, time, or a chance to be heard. Whenever you aregenerous, you strike a blow against lack. Your ego secretly fears ruin becauseit believes that something is lacking. This may be the result of scarceresources, an unfair God, bad luck, or personal defect. It’s rare to find anyonewho doesn’t worry, at one time or another, about one or all of thesedeficiencies. Grace brings living proof that nothing is lacking, either in youor the world around you.I imagine that there’s no wider gap between the ego and the soul than this one.If you declare that there is no lack in the world, countless arguments will beraised against you, and you stand a good chance of being called insensitive,blind, immoral, or worse. Haven’t you deliberately overlooked the vast extent ofpoverty and famine in the world? Jesus’ words about Providence watching the fallof a sparrow seem unconvincing to someone who doesn’t know where the next mealis coming from. But the teaching is based on consciousness, not on this year’sfeast or famine. Grace is generous once it has descended, and before that,material forces hold sway.The ego’s generosity is a display of riches; it draws attention to the giver’swealth and the receiver’s need. The soul’s generosity draws no attention toitself. The impulse is natural and selfless, like a tree loaded with fruit whosebranches bow to the ground. If you can be generous from an overflow of spirit,you will be acting from grace.Showing forgiveness. Here is the most telling test. To forgive unconditionallyis a mark of grace. Your ego can’t duplicate this quality of the soul. Withoutgrace, forgiveness is always conditional. We wait until we aren’t angry anymore.We weigh what is fair and unfair. We nurse grievances and imagine retaliation(or carry it out before we forgive). Conditions are being imposed. When you areable to forgive by setting those conditions aside, you are acting from grace.Some spiritual teachers would say that the ego can never forgive to begin with.Christianity makes forgiveness a divine attribute. Fallen humanity, itself insevere need of forgiveness, cannot abolish sin without salvation. Buddhismbelieves that pain and suffering are inherent in human nature until the illusionof the separate self is overcome. It’s not that these traditions arepessimistic, or that wrongdoing is a permanent curse. Rather, Jesus and Buddhatook a realistic look at the psyche, which is entangled in a complex web ofright and wrong. We cannot help but feel that pain is wrong—our own pain, thatis—and with that in mind, all wounds are proof of unfairness. Pain makes us feelvictimized. Which means that life’s tendency to bring pain makes everything andeveryone open to blame. If you had to forgive everything you blame someone elsefor, the process would consume a lifetime.To extend forgiveness shows that you have found a way out of the trap.Forgiveness becomes easy once you stop being attached to not forgiving. Theblame game is over. So is the perception of being victimized. In the presence ofgrace, forgiveness is a recognition that for every wound there is a healing. Ifyou see yourself as healed in advance, there is nothing to forgive in the firstplace."},{"pageContent":"BREAKTHROUGH #5THE UNIVERSE EVOLVES THROUGH YOUFinally, it takes a breakthrough to reveal how precious you really are. Almostno one believes that he or she is absolutely necessary in the grand scheme ofthings. Yet if you are the growing tip of evolution, the universe needs you in aunique way. You fit into a plan that cannot be imagined in advance. It has norigid guidelines, no fixed boundaries, and no predictable outcome. The plan ismade up as it goes along, and it depends on the participation of each and everyperson.I once heard a famous Indian guru talking about the cosmic plan—or the divineplan, as he called it. He couched the plan in the most inspiring terms, paintinga future of untold abundance and the total absence of suffering. There was alarge audience in attendance, mostly westerners. In the room I could feel anemotional tug-of-war—people wanted to believe what they heard, but they didn’tdare. Finally a brave soul stood up and asked, “Is the divine plan unfoldingright now? The world looks so chaotic and violent. Fewer and fewer peoplebelieve in God.”Without hesitation the guru said, “Belief in God doesn’t matter. The plan iseternal. It will always unfold. It can’t be stopped.” With a sweep of his arm headded, “Everyone here should join. There’s no higher purpose in life, and if youjoin now, you will reap the first rewards.”The questioner’s brow furrowed. “What if I don’t join?” he asked. “What happensthen?”The guru’s face became stern. “The divine plan doesn’t need you to unfold.” Heleaned closer to the microphone. “But if you turn away, it won’t unfold throughyou.”Ultimately, I think that’s the right answer. If we take “divine” out of theequation and talk in terms of a universe that is constantly evolving, you canjoin in the evolutionary flow or not. The choice is yours. Either way, evolutionwill proceed, but if you opt out, it won’t proceed through you.WHY DO I MATTER?In the past, life was made easier by knowing what God had in store. If you knowwhere you fit in the divine scheme, the physical hardships of life becomesecondary. If you don’t fall in line, your destiny will be painful but no lessfixed. I know of no culture in which a person’s fate was left adrift. Even inJudaism, where one interpretation (but not all) denies the existence of anafterlife, God dictates that this lifetime, being the only one, should be livedas devoutly as possible. The virtue of living under God is that your smallexistence has not just a higher purpose, but the highest of all as part of God’screation.Yet, powerful as it is to live for God, religion has always been vexed by aserious contradiction. Everyone is considered precious to God, but no one isreally needed. Individual lives are thrown away in war by the tens of thousandsevery year. Untold more lives are lost through disease and famine, or barely geta start before infant mortality strikes. Few people talk about thiscontradiction, yet it has a hidden effect. Doctors must deliver fatal news topatients with incurable conditions. The news comes as a shock, yet it’s movingto see that the majority of dying patients are selfless. The reason they don’twant to die is that their families need them. The great question “Why am Ihere?” comes down to other people. This also accounts for the dominant fearexpressed by the old, which isn’t fear of dying or even of chronic, disablingpain. Rather, old people are most afraid that they will become a burden to theirchildren.It’s only human to realize that we all need each other. But if taken too far,this becomes a system of codependency in the worst sense: I only exist to needand be needed. I remember, early in my medical training, wishing that just oneperson, upon hearing that he had incurable liver or pancreatic cancer, wouldmurmur, “What a loss to the world when I am gone.” Not a loss to one’s familyand friends but an absolute loss, something that makes the world poorer. We seethe passing of eminent people that way, certainly. Yet from your soul’sperspective, you are as great an addition to the world as Mahatma Gandhi orMother Teresa, and subtracting you from the cosmic equation would be just asgreat a loss. The most exquisite silk remains intact if you pull out a thread,but the snag will show.Many people would resist the notion that they have an absolute worth in theuniverse. Unwittingly they are playing out a behavior known as learnedhelplessness. A famous example comes from experiments on dogs performed in the1950s. Two dogs were put in separate cages, and each was given a mild shock atrandom intervals. The first dog had a switch that it could hit to make theshocks stop, and very quickly it learned to throw the switch. Since the shockswere mild, this dog displayed no adverse effects. The second dog received shocksat the same time, but had no switch for stopping them. Its experience was verydifferent. For that dog, pain was a random occurrence out of its control.But it’s the second part of the experiment that is most revealing. Each dog wasnow put into a cage where half the floor delivered shocks while the other halfwas safe. All the dog had to do when it was shocked was to jump over a smallpartition to reach the safe zone. The first dog, the one that had learned how toturn the shocks off, didn’t have a switch anymore. But it didn’t need one. Itquickly learned to jump to safety. The second dog, however, gave up immediately.It lay down and let the shocks come as they would, without making an effort tojump out of the way. This is learned helplessness in action. When applied tohuman life, the implications are devastating. Countless people accept thatlife’s pain and suffering come randomly. They have never been in control of theshocks that every existence delivers, and so they seek no escape, even when oneis presented.Knowing how things work is important. Otherwise, learned helplessness creeps upon us. The first dog learned that life makes sense: if you hit a switch, thepain goes away. The second dog learned that life was pointless: no matter whatyou do, the pain comes anyway, which means either no one is in charge, orwhoever’s in charge doesn’t care. A dog’s brain may not think this way, but oursdo. Without a sense of purpose, we resort to helplessness, since either Godisn’t there or he doesn’t care what happens to us. To escape our learnedhelplessness, we have to have a sense that we matter in the larger scheme ofthings.BRETT’S STORYOur purpose is hidden from us, yet there are moments when we see that everythingfits together. We may not know what the plan is, but for certain we know thatsomething is working out a larger design; at such times we realize that the mostcommon events cohere into extraordinary patterns.At seventy, Brett is an avid gardener. One rose in his garden is tall andstrikingly beautiful, its blooms pale yellow tinged with pink. “This is the onlymystical rose I grow, and it has a story,” he told me. “When the Nazis invadedFrance, flower-growing came to a sudden halt. Every available acre had to beused for food, so a young grower near Lyon found himself digging up 200,000rosebushes to be burned. He was an avid breeder; it crushed him to destroy thedecades of work started by his father and grandfather, so he saved his mostpromising seedling. The war grew darker, and he was lucky enough to send apackage containing buds of this new rose to America with one of the lastdiplomatic couriers leaving France.“He had no idea what happened to this handful of bud grafts until France wasliberated in 1944. Within weeks he got an excited telegram. The rose had thrivedoverseas, and it wasn’t just promising. It was stupendous, perhaps the greatestrose the American nurseries had ever seen. It was decided to set a date, atwhich point the public would be introduced to ‘Peace,’ as the rose would becalled. A series of coincidences followed that became legend. When the namingday came, it coincided with the day that Japan surrendered. On the day that‘Peace’ won the award for best rose of the year 1945, Germany surrendered. Onthe day that the first delegates gathered to form the United Nations, each wasgreeted with a blossom of ‘Peace.’ As it turned out, this was also the day thatGermany signed the final papers of surrender.”Brett paused. “Everyone in the rose world knows about ‘Peace,’ which became byfar the most famous rose in the world. It sold in the millions. It made afortune for the young French grower, whose name was Francis Meilland. But that’snot why I call this rose mystical. It was Meilland’s tragedy to die young, atthe age of forty-six. Before he passed away, he visited his oncologist, and on atable in the waiting room was placed a bowl of ‘Peace,’ which seems like littlemore than a coincidence. But when Meilland returned home, he told his familythat he saw his mother sitting next to the roses, smiling at him. She had passedaway twenty years before, and in her honor, her son had given ‘Peace’ anothername in France, ‘Madame Antoine Meilland.’ What do you think of that?”I could see that this story was emotional for Brett. “What do you think of it?”I asked.“I think it was preordained, the whole thing. As if the first seed, whichMeilland planted in 1935, was meant to become a symbol for world peace after thewar. People took it that way. Who’s to deny them?”“I guess you could say that official reality denies them,” I pointed out. “Astring of coincidences is just that.”“I know,” said Brett. “You have to be naïve or fanciful to think that everythingcould fit together so perfectly. It’s as if each event knew that it was part ofthe same story, and we can’t have that, can we?”It depends. Many people casually say that “nothing happens without a reason.”Yet at the same time they don’t see an overarching purpose to their lives.Animals are free from this dilemma. You can see their purpose simply byobserving it. A hungry cow eats; a cat in heat mates. Human purpose, however, israrely visible. When you see a crush of Christmas shoppers jamming the stores,all are doing the same thing, but they don’t share the same purpose. Some arefull of holiday spirit and want to give pleasure with their gifts. Others arecarrying out a social ritual. Still others are addicted consumers.It would help a great deal to know what the overall plan is. Otherwise we areleft to observe a collection of individuals, each of whom is groping for purposeand catching glimpses of it far too rarely.THE RULES OF THE GAMEThe plan for the unfolding universe stands right before us, even though we failto see it. We’re blind to it because the plan is us. Or, to make it personal,you are the cosmic plan—or the divine plan, if you prefer. There are no rulesoutside your mind, no actions outside your body. Whatever you choose to do, theplan bends to accommodate. When you have a new desire, the universe shiftsaccordingly. It has no choice, because there is no purpose to creation beyondyou, right here and right now.I know that this description sounds like hyperbole. All your life you haveabsorbed a worldview that puts you under a higher power. If it isn’t the powerof God, it’s the power of natural forces. If it isn’t the power of authorityfigures, it’s the power of human nature and its self-destructive impulses. Noneof that is true—or, to be precise, none of that is true once you discover yourreal self. Ultimately, to discover your purpose comes down to discovering whoyou really are.The cosmic plan that was built into you follows certain invisible guidelines: 1. Everything is conscious. There are no dead zones in creation. Consciousness is an activity of the entire universe, which means that when you are aware of anything, the universe is aware through you. What you see and do alters the whole scheme. 2. Everything fits together. There are no loose parts to the universe, nothing is left over. Wholeness keeps each part in place and assigns each its necessary role. When anything looks random, you are seeing one pattern moving into another. 3. The whole scheme is self-organizing. No outside controller is needed. Once a galaxy, a butterfly, a heart, or an entire species is on the move, its inner workings know what to do. 4. Evolution unfolds within itself. Once something grows, it seeks the highest form of itself—the best star, dinosaur, fern, or amoeba. When that form is exhausted, it makes a transition to a new form that is more creative and interesting. 5. Freedom is the ultimate goal. You don’t win by getting to the end; you win by finding a new game the instant the old one is over. This isn’t an empty freedom. You never find yourself floating in a void. Rather, this is the freedom of possibilities that never run out.At every level, Nature follows these five guidelines. They are invisible; theyexist only in consciousness. The reason you haven’t been aware of them isn’tGod’s secrecy. The plan isn’t abstract. Quite the opposite—it’s built into everycell in your body. You can become aware of the plan if you choose, and then theuniverse acquires a new face. 1. Everything is conscious. Living in accord with this truth means that you respect all life forms. You believe that you are a part of a living whole, and you act as if all your actions help the whole to evolve. You recognize a kinship with every level of consciousness, from the lowest to the highest. 2. Everything fits together. This truth opens your mind to see how the whole of life interacts. Instead of thinking in mechanical terms, you see each event unfolding organically. Instead of taking life one piece at a time, you look for the larger picture. It would also be natural to investigate how and why things fit together. Is there an overarching intelligence that is thinking on the cosmic scale? If so, then are you a thought in this universal mind, or part of the thinking process—or both? 3. The whole scheme is self-organizing. This is one of the most fascinating truths, because it holds that nothing has a beginning or an end. The universe isn’t like the tide going in and out again. It’s like the ocean as a whole, breathing in and out, sending up waves that fall back again into the wholeness. No event is separate. We only see separateness because our perspective is narrow. Through a wider lens you can see that all events arise together. Think of an ant that has learned to read. It is the world’s most intelligent ant, but it’s still quite small, so it reads a book by crawling from one word to the next. The plot of the book is completely linear from the ant’s perspective, so it would be amazed to know that you—a much bigger creature—can approach the book as a whole, and you can dip into it wherever you want, read the end before the beginning, sample high spots, or select only what interests you. You can do all those things because the linear is only one mode of many in approaching a book. The same is true of life. 4. Evolution unfolds within itself. Once you see that linear thinking is just a choice—and a fairly arbitrary one—you can look at evolution in a new way. Think of that museum diagram showing a stooped-over primate turning into a Neanderthal, then a caveman and finally Homo sapiens, each one standing taller and straighter. That’s a perfect example of linear thinking, but it overlooks that the driving force of human evolution is the brain, and it didn’t develop in a straight line, not even remotely. It grew in a global fashion. Every new area of the brain added to the evolution of the whole. Every new skill was recognized by the whole brain. For example, when our ancestors first stood upright, this affected motor coordination, eyesight, balance, blood circulation, and many other aspects of the body-mind you recognize as your own. The opposable thumb, offered as a textbook example of physical evolution that separates human beings from lower primates, would be meaningless without a brain that learned the infinite possibilities inherent in this new ability to press a thumb against a forefinger. It took a global response by the brain to develop from this rudimentary skill all of art, agriculture, tools, buildings, and weapons. Evolution is a total activity of the universe. 5. Freedom is the ultimate goal. If evolution is happening everywhere in a global fashion, where is it heading? For centuries human beings assumed that we were the highest goal of God’s creation, and despite Darwin’s shocking demotion of humans to one species among many, we still believe we hold a privileged place. But it’s not at the top of the ladder of life. Instead, we are the one creature who grasps that creativity is infinite. Evolution is heading everywhere, not to an end point. The ultimate goal of the universe is to unfold without limits. To put it in a word, evolution is becoming more and more free, and its ultimate goal is total freedom.Laws of nature dictate how units of matter combine when atom collides with atom,yet infinite variety is permitted at the same time. We are embedded in a designthat is dynamic, free, creative, and unpredictable. Evidence of this lies inwhat we call games. Consider how a baseball game is run. It exists entirely inconsciousness. Human beings decided that hitting a leather ball with a stick hasvalue. Invisible rules were devised that each player keeps in his head. No onespeaks of these rules as the game is being played, but infractions are instantlynoticed and penalized. The baseball field is strictly demarked with lines andboundaries, yet within these limits the players are free to improvise. No twogames are exactly alike; no two players have the same style, or level of talent.And once a game starts, this combination of fixed rules and free play determineswho wins. A baseball game is open-ended until the bottom of the ninth inning,despite the rigid set of rules that enclose it.Every game is a display of consciousness in creative mode. The universe is inthe same mode. The defenders of so-called intelligent design—the notion that anall-knowing Creator made everything in the universe to fit perfectly—aren’twrong to stand in awe before creation. The real problem is that intelligentdesign isn’t intelligent enough. It limits God to one big idea that neverchanges, when in reality the universe changes constantly and is ever moreinventive.If the whole universe is conscious, we have an instant explanation for whynothing is accidental. Yet it’s hard to imagine a rock by the side of the roadbeing as conscious as you and I are. There’s a way to get past this objection,however. Imagine that you live in a dream, but don’t know it. Inside your dreamyou see other people moving around, so they seem conscious to you. You viewanimals behaving as if they possessed consciousness as well—they are curious,for example, and can be trained into new behavior. But when it comes to rocksand clouds, they are inanimate, so you assume they aren’t conscious. Thensomeone comes along and says, “Everything is conscious. It has to be. All thatyou see around you is happening in a person’s brain. That person is you. You arethe dreamer, and as long as this is your dream, it shares in yourconsciousness.”There is only the finest line between “I am dreaming” and “I am in a dream,”since the brain creates both states. Why not cross the line? In some cultures,no other invitation is needed. The ancient rishis of India compared life to adream because all experience is subjective. There is no way to experience theworld except subjectively. If every experience happens “in here,” it makesperfect sense that things all fit together: we make them fit together. Evenrandomness is a concept created by the human brain. As mosquitoes swarm atsunset, they don’t feel random, nor do atoms of interstellar dust. We don’t seeform and design until they fit our preconceptions, but this doesn’t matter toNature. Seem through an electron microscope, every cell in your body looks likea swirling haze of activity, but that’s just a perception. As far as Nature isconcerned, every aspect of your body is orderly and purposeful.So you face a choice. You can take the position that order only exists wherehumans say it does, or you can take the position that order is everywhere.Either way, all you’ve done is to take a point of view. If half the people inthe world said that God designed all of creation and the other half said thatcreation was a random event, the universe would still be what it is.Consciousness would still be flowing through your body, brain, mind, and allliving creatures, ignoring the artificial boundaries we impose. The either/orisn’t between science and religion, but between participating in the cosmic planor not. There’s a voluntary aspect and an involuntary aspect. As with a baseballgame, you have to want to play, but once you do, you’re all in.[images/Chop_9780307452344_epub_L05_r1.jpg]IN YOUR LIFE: CORE PARTICIPATIONAs with any game, once you’re in the game of life, you should play to win. Youmust commit yourself from your very core. Knowing the guidelines of the divineplan gives you an enormous advantage in this regard. Not knowing them is likeplaying a game whose rules are revealed one at a time, and only when you breakthem. Life works that way for most people. They discover how to live by trialand error. Other people fall back upon a rule book that is supposed to apply toeveryone and cover all contingencies—the Bible is such a rule book, but manyothers exist. In India, these guides for living (gathered in texts known as thePuranas) run to thousands of pages, with minute descriptions of the most arcanesituations and combinations of behavior. In the end, however, no one has everled an exemplary life by following a recipe.Between having no rules and imposing rigid ones, the universe has left room fordynamic guidelines that impose the least restraint on free will. To participatefully, each guideline allows for maximum achievement. Achievement doesn’t meanmaterial success. It means fully understanding how consciousness works.YOUR BEST GAMELet consciousness do the work.Don’t interfere with the flow.View everyone as an extension of yourself.Watch for change and use it wisely.Gather information from every source.Wait until your intention is clear.Realize that nothing is personal—the universe is acting through you.Ask for nothing less than inspiration.See every step as part of the process.These tactics have one thing in common: they are in accord with the invisibleplan that underlies everyone’s life. But because participation is voluntary,there’s a sharp contrast between people who align themselves with the plan andthose who don’t. Let me illustrate this point by point.Let consciousness do the work. People who follow this guideline are highlysubjective, but their subjectivity isn’t fickle; they don’t give in to eachpassing mood. Instead they are self-aware, which means that they know when theyare uncomfortable in a situation, and don’t move forward until it feels right.Their bodies give them signals of stress and strain that they take seriously.Such people trust themselves, which is a totally subjective state, yet a verypowerful one. To trust a self that is rooted in ego would be folly, but when youtruly know who you are, you can trust yourself from the soul level. At thatlevel, consciousness isn’t merely subjective. It flows through the universe, thesoul, the mind, and the body. Letting consciousness do the work meanssurrendering to an organizing principle that is vaster than yourself, vastenough to keep all of reality together.Don’t interfere with the flow. There is a profound Buddhist doctrine that speaksof a great river that flows through all of reality. Once you have foundyourself, there is no more cause for action. The river picks you up and carriesyou along forever after. In other words, effort from the personal level, thekind of effort all of us are used to in daily life, becomes pointless after acertain point. This includes mental effort. Once you become self-aware, yourealize that the flow of life needs no analysis or control, because it’s allyou. The great river only seems to pick you up. Actually, you have pickedyourself up—not as an isolated person, but as a phenomenon of the cosmos. No onegave you the job of steering the river. You can enjoy the ride and observe thescenery.Learning to step aside from your false responsibilities means giving up yoururge to control, defend, protect, and insure against risk. All of that is falseresponsibility. To the extent that you can let it go, you will stop interferingwith the flow. To the extent that you cling, life will continue to bring evenmore things to control, and to defend yourself against. Risks will loomeverywhere. It’s not that fate is set against you. You are simply seeingreflections of your deepest beliefs, as consciousness unfolds the drama drawn upbeforehand in your mind. It’s the universe’s task to unfold reality; yours isonly to plant the seed.View everyone as an extension of yourself. When people get on the spiritualpath, they often find themselves misunderstood. The accusation is leveledagainst them (if only behind their backs) that they have become self-centered.The implication is “It’s not all about you.” If “you” means the isolated ego,that’s certainly true. But at the level of the soul, the self changes. Losingits boundaries, it merges with the flow of life. On the spiritual path you cometo sense the flow and willingly join it. Then—and only then—is everyone else anextension of yourself. How do you know that you have reached this point? First,you have no enemies. Second, you feel another’s pain as your own. Third, youfind that a common sympathy links everyone.As these three perceptions dawn, reality is shifting. You are claiming your newhome in the unlimited landscape of spirit. But even before that comes tofruition, you are connected to everyone else. Nothing keeps you from living thattruth. There will always be differences of personality. What changes isself-interest. Instead of being about “me,” it starts to be about “us,” thecollective consciousness that binds everyone. On a practical basis this meansseeking agreement, consensus, and reconciliation. These are the primary goalsfor anyone who lives in the flow.Watch for change and use it wisely. You can use the transient nature of life toyour advantage. Most people fear change; others allow it to pass them by. To usechange creatively, those attitudes won’t work. Nothing will work as a lifestrategy that isn’t dynamic and growing. Change itself is neutral, since forevery constructive change there is a destructive one. But the principle ofchange holds the key, for it dictates that going with the flow of life bringsgrowth and creativity, while attempting to freeze events, memories, pleasure,and inspiration brings stasis. The most inspiring or pleasurable moments in yourlife beg to be savored and held on to. You must resist that temptation, becausethe minute you try to hang on to an experience, it loses the vitality that madeit special in the first place.Use the principle of change to keep your life fresh and renewable. Taking theattitude that the flow of life is always self-renewing will help you avoidstagnation, and anxiety over the future. What makes people anxious about thefuture is a gnawing fear that the best has already happened, or that a singlemissed opportunity will prove to be decisive. “The one that got away” is arecurrent theme of failed romance, and it applies equally to failed careers,abandoned projects, and deflated aspirations. But in reality “the one that gotaway” comes down to clinging to a fixed idea. Every creative person’s success isbased on trust that inspiration is continuous. The more you create, the morethere is to create. In a documentary on a famous orchestra conductor who wasturning eighty, the most poignant moment came with his last comment: “I have nowish to live many more years, except for knowing that I am just beginning to sayall that I want to say through my music.”Gather information from every source. The universe is multidimensional, and whenwe speak of the flow of life, it’s a multidimensional flow. Imagine not just onemighty river rushing to the sea, but a hundred small streams converging, mixing,and each adding its unique contribution. To draw the most from life, you must beaware that absolutely anything can contribute to it. Inspiration comes from alldirections, both inner and outer. You need alert antennae to sense howcontinuously your soul is communicating with you. It’s not a matter of tuning into a hundred cable TV channels in the hope of finding one interesting program.Rather, in the welter of sensations that bombard the brain every day, certainones are meant for you—they carry a meaning that is personal to you alone.In the Indian tradition it is said that God spends as much time hiding asrevealing himself, which points to an everyday truth. The next thing that willspur you on is asleep until you awaken it. The future is a hiding place we callthe unknown. Yet the known, which is here and now, comes from nowhere if notfrom the unknown. The instinct that says “something is out there waiting” isvalid. You stand at the pivot point between the unknown and the known. Your taskis to reach into the darkness and pluck out the next thing that will bemeaningful.Some people avoid the task by repeating the known over and over. What they don’trealize is that the unknown is never truly invisible. Your soul anticipates whatyou need, and it lays out hints and clues on your path. This is the soul’ssubtle form of guidance. It winnows out the useless, the pointless, themisleading, and the false starts. If you tune in with alertness, you’ll feel asense of vibrancy about the thing you should be doing—it feels right, alluring,seductive, enticing, pleasurable, curious, intriguing, and challenging, all atonce. Being open to those feelings, which are entirely subjective, allows you topick up the hints left by your soul. The unknown looks dark only to those whocan’t see its hidden glow.Wait until your intention is clear. Countless people are looking for motivationin the wrong places. They seek to increase their energy and drive. They want thebiggest reward. They lie in wait for a lightning bolt to hit them with the nextgreat invention or business idea. The real source of motivation isn’t any ofthose things. Motivation, the kind that carries seed ideas to fruition withenergy and passion, comes from a clear intent. Knowing exactly what you want todo, with unwavering conviction, is the spark that generates everything else,including the big ideas and the great rewards. Confusion and uncertainty dividethe flow of life into separate, weak channels. Because a clear intent can’t beforced, many people never find one. They apply a bit of themselves to half adozen areas of their lives. Yet there is no great secret to finding a clearintent; it depends upon simply waiting.Waiting isn’t a passive act; it only looks passive. The right kind of waitinginvolves discrimination: you are inwardly sorting out what feels right from whatdoesn’t. You allow vague fantasies and idealistic schemes to do what theywill—the pointless ones dissolve in time. You keep an eye out for a spark thatrefuses to be extinguished. Much else is involved—anxious searching, thestruggle of self-doubt, the lure of grandiose ambitions, and flights ofimpossible fancy. Eventually a clear intent will emerge, and once it does, theinvisible forces harbored in the soul will come to your aid. For many people,waiting for a clear intent is so exhausting that they undertake it only a fewtimes, generally in those uncertain years when young adults feel compelled tostart a career. Casting about, they feel aimless and under pressure; they watchas their more motivated peers pass them by in the job market.But with hindsight, one can see that the individuals who held out until a clearintent revealed itself were the lucky ones. Despite stress, peer pressure, anddoubt, they had the inner strength to trust that “something is out therewaiting.” Or in here waiting. It amounts to the same thing, a hidden potentialthat needed to be carefully plucked out from the tangled fabric of the psyche.The best thing you can do is to go through this process as many times aspossible. The fog that shrouds your soul may be thick, but it will clear if youwant it to, however long the process takes.Realize that nothing is personal—the universe is acting through you. It soundsstrange to hear that you shouldn’t take your life personally. What could be morepersonal? Yet the universe’s plan is composed entirely of impersonal forces.They apply equally to every object, every event. They are not loaded against youor for you, any more than gravity is. Finding your soul is the same as findingthe impersonal self, because the soul has direct access to the invisible forcesthat uphold the cosmos. Intelligence is impersonal, and so are creativity andevolution. They are discovered only in your deepest awareness. To take fulladvantage of them, look upon life as a school, with consciousness as itscurriculum.The ego takes everything personally, which is a big hindrance; experience ishappening to “me.” Buddhism spends a great deal of time trying to dispel thenotion that this “me” has a claim on experience. Instead, Buddhists say, theexperience is unfolding on its own, and you, as an experiencer, are simply aconduit. Thus we get formulations like “Thinking is thinking itself.” It can bebaffling to unravel the complexities of such a simple statement as “Being is,”or “The dancer is the dance.” Yet the essential point is practical: the less youtake life personally, the more easily it can flow through you. Holding onlightly works. Holding on tightly doesn’t work. Nor does assuming that everyexperience either builds you up or tears you down. The flow of life doesn’t sortitself into plus and minus columns. Everything has its own intrinsic value,measured in energy, creativity, intelligence, and love. To find those values, aperson must stop asking, “What good does it do me?” Instead, you witness whathappens, finding fascination in all of it.Ask for nothing less than inspiration. Daily life can be maddeningly mundane.You can overcome the tedium by piling up as many interests as possible, but inthe end you may find that you never got below the surface. For what makes lifemundane is shallowness. In the depths, every experience is full of vitality. Youfeel vibrant, no matter what your life looks like on the surface. In somespiritual traditions, making your daily routine vibrant is an ultimate goal. Theidea is that you can carry water and chop wood while still feeling universal. Irespect those traditions, but sometimes I miss the most vibrant quality thatlife can offer, which is inspiration. It limits the soul to ask it to fill dailyroutine with light. Why not fill extraordinary achievement with light?Consciousness is value-free. It can be shaped into ugly, dull, inert things ifyour intention moves that way. Like an artist’s palette, which is full of colorsbut which carries no guarantee that lovely pictures will result, consciousnesscontains vibrancy, brilliance, and fascination. But even a self-aware persondoesn’t automatically gets a life with those qualities. You must shapeconsciousness with intent, which is why asking for inspiration is crucial. So isnot settling for less. I said before that your soul places hints along the path,clues to the next thing that will spur you on. To be more precise, these hintsdepend on where you’re going and where you’re coming from. If you are walking apath of low expectations, the next thing you find will support those lowexpectations.Your soul has no agenda. It’s not out to make you the best you can be. It’s outto fulfill the potential you discover in yourself, which means that you and yoursoul are in a cooperative venture. You ask, it supplies. What it supplies leadsyou to ask for the next thing. Because it’s rare to meet every occasion with aclear intention, often we ask for things that are mixed up, conflicted, andconfused. And when we do, the soul winds up providing us with less-than-idealopportunities. We find ourselves at loose ends or following false trails. Tokeep this from happening, ask for nothing less than inspiration. That is to say,keep your highest vision in mind, and in any situation, seek the highest outcomeaccording to that vision.As always, this strategy is purely subjective; it happens inside. But only bycleaving steadily to your vision can you align yourself with the highestpotential you were born to express. The best you can be comes down to a seriesof decisions that refuses the less-than-best time and again. We aren’t speakingof consumer shopping here. It’s not the less-than-best lover, car, house, orjob. You refuse the less-than-best idea, motivation, purpose, solution, andgoal, choosing instead to wait for better, and trusting that your soul willbring it.See every step as part of the process. When some people say, “It’s all part ofthe process,” one hears a note of resignation, as if life takes time andpatience, but if you can put up with the bother long enough, the processeventually works. This makes the process sound like a bureaucracy grinding itsway to action, or a conveyor belt that mechanically produces results. Theprocess I’m describing is not like that at all. It is dynamic, unpredictable,fascinating, and ever-changing. To be caught up in the process brings ultimatejoy and fulfillment. The great spiritual guides, those who can look at lifemetaphysically, often declare that the process takes care of itself. A notedIndian guru was once asked, “Is my personal evolution something I’m doing orsomething that’s happening to me?” His answer: “It’s both, but if we mustchoose, it’s something that is happening to you.”Yet, for all that, the spiritual path doesn’t feel automatic. Here and now, fromthe ant’s perspective rather than that of the eagle, life takes participation.You must focus on every minute; new challenges show up constantly and cannot beignored. It’s all too easy, then, to view your life as a sequence of moments,steps forward or backward. Most people participate in their lives exactly thatway, by “living one day at a time,” as the saying goes. This perspective wouldturn all of us into survivors. It would deny life its wholeness, and if you takethat away, wholehearted participation is impossible. Of course you will acceptone slice of bread at a time if you don’t know that the whole loaf can be yours.We are forced to speak in metaphors because the process of life is mysterious.Does it happen right now if right now you are filling your car with gas,changing a baby diaper, or sitting in the dentist’s chair? Does it unfold to aglorious conclusion on a date you can circle on your calendar? The mingling ofthe visible and invisible, the sublime and the distressing, is inescapable. Theonly viable attitude you can take is “This is it.” Sometimes “it” amounts tonothing; you can’t wait for it to end. Sometimes “it” feels as if the heavenshave parted; you can only hope it will last forever. But “it” is a bird on thewing. You’ll never catch it. The miracle is that the greatest creations, such asthe human brain, were made by chasing after the bird. We weave ourselves into atapestry of experience that grows more exalted as time passes, yet each threadis nothing but a wisp of thought, desire, or feeling. Every moment lived addsanother stitch, and even if you cannot envision what the final pattern will looklike, it helps to know that the thread is golden."},{"pageContent":"[images/Chop_9780307452344_epub_L03_r1.jpg]10 STEPS TOWHOLENESS[images/Chop_9780307452344_epub_L03_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"PROMISES YOUCAN KEEP[images/Chop_9780307452344_epub_L02_r1.jpg]Wholeness is the result of connecting body, mind, and soul. In wholeness youaren’t divided against yourself; therefore the choices you make are beneficialat every level. Once you realize how the soul functions, there is no reason toturn back and live any other way than from the level of the soul. Yet livingwithout the soul has also been easy. You can ignore being divided againstyourself. Life goes on without resolving that issue. Bad decisions bring painand suffering, but people learn to put up with it. In other words, life withoutbeing whole is “easy” because of habit, inertia, or old conditioning that ishard to break. (I remember my first meditation instructor, who insisted that ifI wasn’t committed to daily practice, I might as well not start. “I don’t knowhow many years it takes to reach enlightenment,” he said, “but it takes only oneday to quit.”)The secret is to live in wholeness now, before you completely achieve it. What’sneeded is a lifestyle that keeps your vision alive. “Holistic” has come to meanorganic food, leaving no carbon footprint, practicing prevention, and trustingin alternative medicine. All of those things are undeniably good—they areevidence of growing consciousness that earlier generations only dreamed of—butthey won’t keep you on the spiritual path. A holistic lifestyle should sustainthe ties to your soul even when those ties feel fragile.Spiritual teachers have wrestled with this problem for centuries, wondering howthey can bridge the gulf between the old life and the new. Teaching andpreaching aren’t enough. Showing by example isn’t enough. Yet many human beingshave crossed over to the light (call them saints, yogis, bodhisattvas, or simplyinspiring examples) and what they have achieved is real. If we distill theirstories, a lifestyle emerges that applies to you and me in these times oftransition. The lifestyle is simple, and can be followed without anyone elseneeding to know or approve. I’ve broken it down into simple steps.10 STEPS TO WHOLENESS 1. Nourish your “light body.” 2. Turn entropy into evolution. 3. Commit yourself to deeper awareness. 4. Be generous of spirit. 5. Focus on relationships instead of consumption. 6. Relate to your body consciously. 7. Embrace every day as a new world. 8. Let the timeless be in charge of time. 9. Feel the world instead of trying to understand it. 10. Seek after your own mystery.These steps happen in awareness. They mean the most to me personally, becausethey are the fruit of my own journey. As a child in India I learned that my fatehung in the balance between vidya, or wisdom, and avidya, or ignorance. Thischoice, which goes back thousands of years, was painted in graphic terms that ayoung boy could understand. I was born in a time of turmoil as the country wasstruggling with every imaginable woe, from riots in the streets between Hindusand Muslims to gross social inequity and millions living on the verge of famine.What would save us? Not belief in God or massive social programs, good as thosethings might be. I was taught that life followed from the values you held inyour own awareness. The road of light, or the road of darkness? By the time Iwas eight I knew which one to choose. Happiness, success, prosperity, andwell-being would come my way if I lived by the light of vidya.In later years I lost my innocence and came to see this promise as somewhatempty, like Benjamin Franklin’s promise that “early to bed, early to rise, makesa man healthy, wealthy, and wise.” More effective was the fear of living inavidya, which brought disease, poverty, and disgrace. These threats were notpumped into me, the way children are warned that the devil is waiting if theystray from God. Yet for nearly forty years I wandered between the two poles ofwisdom and ignorance, or, if you will, belief and unbelief. I know firsthand thegap between vision and reality. Today, as firmly as I believe inself-transformation, I come back to that gap. Most people know what’s supposedto be good for them, but making promises to themselves (“I will never cheat,” “Iwon’t wind up getting a divorce,” “I’ll never stab anyone in the back to getahead”) is never quite enough. (A guru was once asked by a confused disciple,“Master, how can I become a good person?” The guru said, “It’s nearlyimpossible. If you think deeply, there are a thousand reasons to pick a pin upfrom the floor and a thousand reasons not to.” The disciple became very worried.“Then what can I do?” The guru smiled. “Find God.” Now the disciple was muchmore worried. “But, sir, finding God seems so far beyond my reach.” The gurushook his head. “Finding God is a hundred times easier than trying to be good.God is part of you, and once you locate that part, being good comes naturally.”)If the spiritual path is to take us to our goal, we must make promises that wecan keep every day. The ten steps I’ve outlined are just that. They don’trequire you to stretch beyond your limits, and yet your limits will begin toexpand. The ten steps can’t be undermined by old habits and conditioning,because you won’t be asked to fight against your old self. All you can do ishelp the new self to grow in silence. Yet nothing more is needed. The secret isthat inner transformation cannot be seen as it occurs. The brain shifts as theperson shifts. The brain has no way of preserving its old pathways once new oneshave been created. In a sense the soul erases its tracks, and yet something verytangible is also happening.A good friend was a committed seeker for years. To all outward appearances heled an ordinary life. Whenever I ran into him, I’d ask how his search was going.His reply, offered with a smile, was always the same. “I’m almost ready to peekout of the incubator.” This went on for several years. He was very private, andI doubt there were more than a handful of people who knew about his innerdedication. Then the day came when he gave up his strict spiritual disciplines,and he seemed much happier for it. When I asked what had changed, he spokeeloquently.“When I started out, I was shy about my spirituality. My family thought of me asantireligious, in fact, since I had refused to go to church with them when Iturned eighteen. After I started meditating, I thought I was changing, but ifanyone saw this, they had nothing to say. People liked the way I used to be. SoI quietly kept on, and I let everyone suppose that I was the person I had alwaysbeen.“Then I found that my desires weren’t the same anymore. There was nothing Idesperately wanted or didn’t want. I stopped running after the things everyoneelse thought were so important. My friends and family noticed that I had gottena lot quieter. That’s all they said. I kept working on myself and moved on.“Time passed, and more changes happened. I faced my ego and its whole deal. Iwent into my old beliefs and my need to be right all the time. There wassomething new to look at every day. I kept watching and moving on. Nothingoutward was drastically different, but there were moments when I was amazed thatthe people close to me didn’t see how totally different I had become.”“This was all happening while you were in the incubator?” I asked.My friend smiled. “Exactly. Then one day it all ended. I woke up and had nodesire to meditate. Frankly, I felt kind of blank, as if nothing had happenedfor the last ten years. I looked at myself in the mirror, and this ordinary guystared back at me. For a second I was almost afraid, feeling a faint wave ofdread. I lay back down on the bed, and then, like a warm liquid inside, I felt“it” wash over me. What is “it”? Life itself, like a river picking me up andcarrying me along. Since then, I’ve been going where the river goes, and thingsjust work out. From that moment on, everything works out.”His face showed a flush that was a kind of ecstasy. But I had a question. “Whynot let the river carry you beginning the first day? Why do you have to waituntil the end?”“That’s the thing,” my friend said. “I had a thousand days I thought were theend. And I’m not sure I could tell you when the first day was, either. The thinghappens when it wants to.”In all honesty, none of us knows when the first day on the path was—or when thelast day will be. Therefore, the best thing is to live every day as if it werethe first and the last. A new world is born in spirit every time the sun rises.Life is perpetually fresh, so your path can be just as fresh. Otherwise, if youpostpone your life waiting for a great and glorious gift to be bestowed, thegift may never come, and your life will be postponed forever. Wholeness must beseized at this moment, because eternity dawns only in a moment like this one.The goal of the following steps is to make wholeness a daily possibility. Visionand reality want to come together. The time to make that happen is now.STEP 1. NOURISH YOUR “LIGHT BODY”Your soul acts as your spiritual body. As such, it needs to be nourished. In thesame way that your cells exchange oxygen and food, your spirit body sends andreceives subtle energy, or “light.” Your heart, liver, brain, and lungs—all yourorgans—literally survive on light coming from the sun. Every bite of foodrepresents trapped sunlight that your body releases into chemical and electricalenergy. Your cells have no future except through light.“Light” performs the same function at a subtler level. Every message from yoursoul is encoded in energy, because the brain must convert love, truth,beauty—every aspect of meaning, in fact—into physical activity. Subtle energybrings the mind into material existence, so in practical terms your futuredepends on how well you nourish your light body. If you feed it with freshenergy every day, it will provide you with inspiration and guidance. In the Westwe aren’t used to thinking that way, but in Sanskrit the word jyoti, or light,is more than physical. Jyoti carries meaning, growth, good and bad influences,and the whole trajectory that a person’s life will follow. Even if you are astrict materialist and believe that the brain is the source of the mind, nothingis possible in the brain without energy; therefore you wind up with the sameconclusion, that a person’s hopes, wishes, and dreams must be nourished throughlight—in this case, sunlight. And you will have to account for how raw light,composed of photons, manages to turn into the mind’s rich display of meaning.It’s not as though a bean knows how to paint a Madonna and Child, or as though acauliflower can build the Parthenon.Every day it’s up to you to convert the soul’s energy into the meaning of yourlife. There’s no such thing as a meaningless experience. Your brain exists toprocess meaning. One way or another, the light is going to turn into you. It isgoing to support the vision you have of yourself, if that is your choice. But inthe absence of a vision, it can also be funneled into supporting old habits andclosed-off beliefs.Think of your soul’s energy being parceled out like the electricity running toyour house. Some portion must go to basic life support. Your brain needs toregulate the body’s various systems to keep you alive. Another portion of energygoes to routine activity. Your brain operates to keep the family going, to doyour job at the office, and so on. Some energy also gets allotted to pleasure.Your brain thrives on pleasurable sensations and tries to maximize thosesensations through entertainment, games, fantasy, sexual arousal, and the like.So far, the analogy between the soul’s energy and the electricity that runs ahousehold is pretty close. Most people run their lives and their households thesame way, for basic life support, daily routine, and some amount of pleasure.Yet inside a house might live a Picasso or a Mozart, and here the analogy breaksdown, because geniuses maximize the soul’s energy for other purposes. Meaningbecomes disproportionately important in their lives. Fortunately, the supply ofsubtle energy is as copious as we want it to be. Once the basics of life aretaken care of, there’s plenty left over to fuel your personal vision and higherpurpose.As you approach each day, consciously channel energy into your vision. Take anyquality of the soul and convert it to your own use. These qualities are notmysterious, and all around you people are creating a purposeful life from thesoul level. Let me illustrate the wealth of choice that is available to you.The soul is dynamic. This quality can be converted into a life of adventure,exploration, and forward-looking activity. The overriding theme here is reachinga goal.The soul is loving. This quality can be converted into a life of romance,devotion, and worship. The overriding theme here is ever-expanding bliss.The soul is creative. This quality can be converted into a life of art,scientific discovery, and self-transformation. The overriding theme isinspiration.The soul is spontaneous. This quality can be converted into a life of drama,epiphany, and emotional exploration. The overriding theme is surprise.The soul is playful. This quality can be converted into a life of recreation,sport, and carefree enjoyment. The overriding theme is innocence.The soul is knowing. This quality can be converted into a life of observation,study, and meditation. The overriding theme is reflection.The soul is ever-expanding. This quality can be converted into a life ofjourneys, breakthroughs, and personal growth. The overriding theme is evolution.With these qualities in mind, you can shape the soul’s energy into any kind oflife you desire. The shaping is never done automatically, and no one can do itfor you. I’m not implying that you will make a choice once and for all. Atvarious stages in your life, different qualities of meaning exert an appeal.“Knowing” generally dominates the student years; “loving” dominates during thephase of relationships and family; “playful” dominates in childhood.Can a life be shaped without resorting to the soul? Such a life would be eitherunconscious or shortsighted. Of course such lives exist. There are people whototally dedicate themselves to work for its own sake, to materialism and gettingahead, to saving for the future or protecting the present. One can’t call thesemeaningless choices, but they fall short of the soul’s potential to inspire. Insome cultures a complete life is one that passes through stages of meaning thateveryone is expected to fulfill. I’m thinking primarily of ancient India, wherefour ashramas, or stages of life, were assigned to study, family life,retirement, and finally renunciation of the world. Each stage had its specificduties, and the overall goal was to merge the individual soul with the universalsoul—in other words, this was the blueprint for a spiritual journey that everyperson agreed to for many centuries.In modern society that broad agreement has broken down, and a toll is paid inlives that feel restless, chaotic, and lacking in meaning. But you don’t needsociety’s approval to use your soul’s energy in a meaningful way—you don’t needanyone’s approval. The trajectory of your life can follow whatever arc youchoose. The important thing is not to waste energy in the many ways we are alltempted to waste it: through pointless fantasy, unconscious suffering, dead-endhabits, inertia, and circular repetition. These are the enemies of a purposefullife. Nourish your “light body” by feeding it with meaning. Recognize thequality of the soul that appeals to you, and interact with the potential thatwants to unfold.STEP 2. TURN ENTROPY INTO EVOLUTIONYour soul offers a future that is a rising arc from this moment forward. Therewill be no flat plateaus and no slippery slopes to slide back down. Such afuture depends on constant renewal. Your vision must remain fresh, and that canonly happen if you find fresh uses for your energy. Without constant input fromyour soul, however, energy tends to wane. People have come to accept that lifewill wear itself out as they age. But this is hardly inevitable, even if youlook at yourself in materialistic terms. As we saw before, the entire universeis a contest between energy that wants to dissipate and run down (entropy) andenergy that wants to become more coherent and complex (evolution). The samecontest is waged at the micro level, too, in your cells. Your everyday choicestip the balance one way or the other. If you favor evolution day by day, it’scompletely reasonable for you to evolve for an entire lifetime.You have a powerful ally on your side, the mind. Mind isn’t subject to entropy.When a thought disappears, it hasn’t exhausted your capacity for a new thoughtto replace it, or a hundred new thoughts. The secret to defeating entropy is tobuild higher and higher structures in the mind. It is these structures that holdback time and shape a future that keeps improving. To grasp what this means,think of any project that takes more than a day to accomplish: a painting, abook, a scientific problem, or a project at work. When you come back to it, youdon’t have to mentally start over at the beginning. There’s a structure in yourmind that keeps your prior work intact, which allows you to pick up where youleft off.In Sanskrit there’s a special term for mental structures that endure. They arecalled devata. (The word derives from the Devas. Usually translated as “angels,”the Devas are actually the builders and shapers of reality. Without the Devas,awareness would never take shape; it would flow like rainwater across an openfield.) To the ancient Vedic seers, devata’s job is to make sure that creativityis preserved and not allowed to dissolve. You can even multitask, since the mindis capable of building any number of structures at once. And you can shut offyour conscious mind—to go to sleep, for example—without anxiety that entropywill blow away your thoughts like dust in the wind. (Everyone has had theexperience of waking up in the morning to find that their first thoughtscontinue exactly where they left off the night before. Brain chemistry cannotexplain this continuity, since chemical reactions change constantly, at a rateof thousands per second in every neuron. Yet something keeps our thoughts intactand allows them to build on each other.)Use the devata aspect of your mind to build and keep on building. Never-endingcreativity is your goal. In practical terms, this means fighting againstboredom, routine, and repetition. Find creative openings at every level of yourlife, as follows:Family life is creative as long as each person is interested in every other. Noone is put into a box with phrases like “You always do that,” or “You’re sopredictable.” No one is labeled and expected to behave according to that label.Fixed roles aren’t assigned (e.g., rebel, bad boy, good girl, mother’s pet,bully, victim, martyr). Everyone is encouraged to be expressive. Nobody is shutdown for acting different.Relationships are creative if both people find new things to discover in theother. This requires that you move beyond the ego. The ego is by natureself-regarding. It looks to itself first and foremost. Even in the most nearlyequal relationships, there’s a tendency to take your partner for granted becausetwo egos are involved—you have to look beyond not just your boundaries, buttheirs as well. The incentive to find something new in your partner comes fromyour own sense of change. If you want your own changes to be valued, you mustsee change in your partner. This sets up a mutual give-and-take. Once started,this give-and-take blossoms into the richest aspect of any relationship: sharedevolution.Work is creative when it satisfies the deepest creative center in a person. Newchallenges are met by discovering new resources in oneself. As most people findout early in their careers, the problem of boredom and repetition is very realin any occupation. Few workplaces take measures to overcome the problem, so theresponsibility lies with you. Remain vigilant for signs that you aren’t beingchallenged, and when those signs appear, demand change. Take on moreresponsibility; don’t shirk risks. If your present situation doesn’t permitcreative expansion, look for another situation that does. The worst thing is tosettle for inertia at work, using the excuse that creativity and pleasure arefor after hours and the weekends. You will be leaving a big hole in your life,and that makes wholeness impossible.Your vision is the part of your life that encompasses pure possibility. Whateverenergy you devote to building a family life, relationships, and work, there isstill enormous room left for reaching higher. Build on your vision every day. Itdoesn’t matter what the vision is, but it should reach beyond your normalboundaries. For some people the vision is humanitarian or religious; for othersit is artistic. (For me, in an early adulthood overwhelmed with medicaltraining, a young family, and constant financial pressure, it turned out to bespiritual.) However much you cherish them, family, relationships, and work aretransient. Your vision is not. It’s your link to the long span of culture andcivilization. You get to participate in myth and archetype, a world of heroesand quests. If you keep focusing on your vision, you may touch the fringe ofeternity. None of these things is possible without a vision, however. As timeunfolds, material life recedes. Having a vision provides insurance that a voidisn’t waiting at the end of the journey. The miracle is that by dedicatingyourself to a vision, you are swept up in the cosmic force of evolution itself,which has no beginning or end.STEP 3. COMMIT YOURSELF TO DEEPER AWARENESSImagine that it’s a starry night in June after the moon has gone down. Walkuntil you find a piece of open ground. Lie on your back and gaze up at theheavens. Can you see yourself in that position? Now think this thought: There isinfinity in all directions, and I am at the center of it. This isn’t anexaggeration—it’s literally true that no matter where you stand, you are thecenter of infinity extending in all directions. The same is true of time. Atevery minute of your life, eternity stretches before you and behind you. Havingabsorbed those two ideas, it’s hard to feel bound by space and time. Yet there’sone more layer to add. Close your eyes, go inside, and think this thought: Thesilence I experience is the source of infinity and eternity.All the teachings of the greatest spiritual traditions come down to thatthought. Jesus and Buddha are linked by knowing that awareness is the source ofall that is, was, and ever will be. At your source, time depends on you, not theother way around. Every event that occurs depends on you, in fact, becausewithout awareness the universe ceases to exist. Stars and galaxies vanish.Creation is sucked into a black hole. Your awareness makes reality blossom inall directions, and the deeper your awareness, the richer creation will be. Ifyou can live as if you are the center point of reality, with eternity andinfinity expanding all around you, you are living from the level of the soul.It’s mysterious that people don’t see themselves this way. But it’s easy to beconvinced by our eyes, which can see only so far. It’s easy to be convinced byour minds, which take in only so much information. And it’s easy to be convincedby the ego, which tells you that you are a small, isolated individualoverwhelmed by the gigantic scale of the cosmos. Fortunately, as awarenessextends, it teaches your eyes, your mind, and your ego to change. In practicalterms, when you commit yourself every day to deeper awareness, you are askingfor new vision, new beliefs, and a new sense of self.New vision is possible when you stop being tied to the raw data that your sensesbring in. People take for granted that their eyes, for instance, are opticalinstruments being bombarded by light from the outside. Photons strike theretina, which then transmits billions of photons a minute to the visual cortexto be analyzed. Yet in many traditional cultures, this process is viewed asreversed. Sight goes outward from the mind, seeking to discover the world. Inother words, sight carries awareness wherever it wants to go. In many ways thismodel of the senses is true to our experience. If you don’t want to seesomething, it doesn’t matter how many photons bombard your retina. On the otherhand, if you are immensely interested in seeing, there’s no limit to what youcan take in. Consider a gifted artist, who can walk through a crowd on a busycity street and see inspiration in every passing face, every shift of sunlight,every angle of the cityscape.New vision is creative vision, and you can cultivate it every day. There isunlimited inspiration hidden inside everyday things, waiting for you to pull itout. One of the most famous Chinese paintings consists of two peaches sittingside by side. The artist has reduced each peach to a single stoke of his brush.On the surface this looks like the easiest thing in the world to create, andhardly art at all: you just dip your brush in some black ink, and with a twistof the wrist you draw a circle that looks like a peach. But can you do it soperfectly that the peach looks ripe, sweet, and glistening with beauty? Can youalso make the viewer feel that you, the artist, are infinitely sensitive tonature? In this famous image, both things have happened.Now apply this kind of vision to yourself. Can you look at your child or yourspouse so that their essence strikes you, intensely and immediately? Can youtransmit love in your glance and feel love in return? We all have this ability.Just as you stand at the center of space and time, so do you stand at the centerof love. There is nothing you need to do. New vision comes from the awareness ofwho you are. When you renew your commitment to having new eyes, they will open.New beliefs follow automatically from seeing things in a new way. A pupil oncecame to his spiritual teacher and said, “I don’t believe in God.” The teacherreplied, “You will believe in God when you see him. Have you really looked?” Thepupil blushed, taking this as criticism. “I have looked very hard, sir. I prayfor God to answer me. I look for signs that He loves me. Nothing works. Godmight as well not exist.” The teacher shook his head. “You think God isinvisible, so no wonder you don’t see him. The creator is in his creation. Gointo nature. Appreciate the trees, the mountains, the green meadows. Look withtotal love and appreciation, not superficially. At a certain point God willnotice that you love his creation. Like an artist who sees someone admiring hispainting, God will want to meet you. Then he will come to you, and once you seehim, you will believe.”You can take this story as a parable or as the literal truth (taking intoaccount that God is as much she as he, or both merged into one). As a parable,the story says that looking with love and appreciation brings out the subtlelevels of nature—including your own nature—and as your perception becomes finer,the sacred level of life reveals itself. At that point you only have to believein what you’ve personally experienced. But it’s also worthwhile to take thestory literally. Gaze at anything you love, whether a beloved person, a rose, ora work of art, and you will see God in it. This is inevitable because there areno things outside yourself, and when you learn to gaze below the surface, youwill see your own awareness. And your belief system will shift accordingly,because you have found that believing in yourself is all that you need.A new sense of self dawns when your belief in yourself is secure. We all holdtight to a self-image that is part fantasy, part projection, and part reflectionof other people. If the apple never falls far from the tree, the same holds truefor our sense of self. Beginning with our families of origin, we have dependedon other people to define us. Are you good or bad, loved or unloved, bright ordull, a leader or a follower? To answer those questions, and hundreds more, youaccumulate information from the outside. This gets blended with your ownfantasies and wishes. The final ingredient is the projections you place on otherpeople; that is, you use them to measure yourself by. This entire sense of selfis a ramshackle construct, but you depend upon it because you believe you must:otherwise you’d have no idea who you really are.A new sense of self can replace this construct, one stick at a time, as youexperience your awareness, go inside, and meet yourself. The person you meetisn’t a flimsy construct. Instead you meet openness, silence, calm, stability,curiosity, love, and the impulse to grow and expand. This new sense of selfdoesn’t need to be constructed. It has existed from the beginning and willalways exist. Having met the new you, it becomes easier and easier to throw awaybits and pieces of the old one. The process takes patience; you need to meetyourself every day. But it’s a joyful process, too, because in your heart ofhearts you never bought in to the flimsy construct, not completely. There aretoo many memories of how it got glued together, piece by piece, sometimes byaccident, often against your will. Nobody really wants to be no more than whatothers see. We yearn to be real, and that yearning, if you keep it in mind, isenough. The person you seek is the same person who is seeking you.STEP 4. BE GENEROUS OF SPIRITWholeness can afford to be generous. It feels no lack. However much you give,more will come to you. I think that’s the secret behind the adage that “it ismore blessed to give than to receive.” When you give, you reveal a spiritualtruth, that the flow of life never runs dry. People run into trouble, however,when they give on the surface but feel the pinch of lack underneath. Generositybegins at the level of the soul, which never runs out of the two things totallynecessary to life: energy and awareness. When you feel secure that you as aperson won’t run short of those two things, you can afford to be generous inspirit. That is a greater gift to the world than money. The two don’t precludeeach other. Once you are generous of spirit, giving on any level becomes naturaland easy.In practical terms, generosity of spirit comes down to the following things: * Offering yourself first. * Never withholding the truth. * Being a force for harmony and coherence. * Placing your trust in the flow of abundance.All of these points fit our overall purpose of giving you a life style that youcan pursue privately while creating real change all around you.Offer yourself first. Here “yourself” means the real you. Offering an imitationversion of yourself is tempting, and most people wind up giving in. They play arole that fits into society’s expectations (spouse, worker, authority figure,follower, dependent, victim). They follow the ego’s demand for quid pro quo, sothat every gift is given with the expectation of a return. They stand uponstatus and income as defining traits. These factors create a false self becausethey are external. There’s no flow from the inside outward, which is whatgenerosity of spirit is all about. There’s an immense difference betweenstepping forward as a benefactor giving time and money, and stepping forward tooffer the real you. The real you is open and vulnerable. It feels sympathy withthe human condition. It recognizes no divisions between one soul and another.It can be frightening to offer the real you, but as so often happens, fear givesfalse counsel. When you offer the real you, you don’t become prey to otherpeople’s immense neediness, or to their capacity to take advantage. Rather, youbecome stronger. The false you, being external, is like a flimsy suit of armor,in this case built from a sense of insecurity. Giving up the false you stripsyou of armor that was an illusion all along. In reality, your body has beenusing the unstoppable flow of energy and awareness in order to survive. Whileyou were pretending to be closed, your body remained open to the universe. Whynot adopt a strategy that’s already been proven to work? Align your spirit withthe weak, the dispossessed, the wronged, and the children of the earth. By beingopen to them, you are not offering yourself as a single soul. You are offeringthe wholeness of spirit.Don’t withhold the truth. When energy and awareness are flowing, the truth flowswith them. Whatever is false serves to block spirit at the source. You aren’tbeing asked to stand up for truth with a capital T, because absolutes are not atissue. As life unfolds, you can only represent your truth, and it will changeover time as you evolve. Consider the truth about good versus evil. To someonewho is less evolved, evil feels powerful, frightening, and starkly opposed togood. With more growth, these things shift: there are gray areas between goodand evil. But there is also less fear of evil or belief in its power. When aperson is highly evolved, good and evil are less important than separation fromthe soul, and there is trust that in wholeness the conflict of good versus evilcan be resolved. Each position has its own truth as felt by each person.The important thing is not to withhold your truth, whatever it may be. Truthwithheld is truth frozen and stuck. Every time you speak your truth, you areadvancing your own evolution. More than that, you are showing your trust intruth to prevail. Untruth is aided more by silence than by lies. I’m thinkingnot so much on a grand scale as on a very intimate one. In homes where there isphysical or emotional abuse, where someone drinks to excess or takes drugs,where signs of depression and anxiety are unmistakable but untreated, the restof the family generally keeps silent. They passively acquiesce to their ownsense of helplessness. The vain hope is that the situation will improve on itsown or at the very least remain stable. What actually happens is that silencemakes the problem grow worse, because silence implies indifference,hopelessness, unspoken hostility, and lack of options. Speaking the truth opensup options. It shows caring. It rejects hopelessness.Be a force for harmony and coherence. By definition, wholeness is a state ofharmony, while fragmentation is a state of conflict. If we weren’t dividedinside, we wouldn’t be fighting wars against temptation, anger, fear, andself-doubt. The soul is a harmonizing influence, and it shows generosity ofspirit to radiate that same quality. A friend told me a striking anecdoterecently: He was walking down the street in a big city where he was visiting,and on impulse he went into a fancy bakery, enticed by their extravagant windowdisplay. The minute he stepped in the door he saw trouble. The bakery managerwas screaming at the girl working the counter. She was in tears, and both wereso engrossed that they didn’t notice that a customer had entered the shop. Myfriend said that he had a sudden intuition. I can bring harmony here.He turned his back on the argument, which settled down once his presence wasnoticed. In itself, that is unremarkable. But my friend kept lingering, and ashe did so, he centered himself in his own peace—he’s been an experiencedmeditator for many years. He could feel the atmosphere in the shop soften, andalthough few would believe what happened next, the manager and the girl at thecounter exchanged smiles. By the time my friend left, he saw them embracing andmutually expressing how sorry they were. Can your mere presence bring harmony toa situation the same way? The first step is to believe that it is possible; thesecond is the willingness not to take sides, but to act solely as a peacefulinfluence, silently if you can, but speaking up if that becomes necessary. Atbottom, conflicts aren’t about right and wrong. They are about incoherence, thechaotic emotions and thoughts that result from chaotic energy and fragmentedawareness. Right and wrong come into the picture as reflections of turmoil; byscreaming that you are right, you don’t have to admit that you are hurt,confused, and torn apart yourself. Instead of adding to the turmoil, you canbring in peace, not just because it sounds moral and good to do that, butbecause without an influence of peace, no productive change can occur.Place your trust in abundance. Wholeness contains everything; therefore it drawson infinite resources. You may find this a tentative truth in your personallife, because no one is supplied with infinite money, status, power, and love.Where lack doesn’t predominate, there is still fear of lack to contend with.Abundance needs to be reframed. When you see it as the infinite resources ofspirit, your attention moves away from material things. Instead, you trust thatthere will always be enough of what your soul has to give. Many people fall backupon religious faith—they believe that God will never bring more challenges thanthey can handle. But this strikes me as simplistic, because when you lookaround, many people are silently crushed by their burdens and many more arediminished and overwhelmed. In the opposite camp are the spiritual materialists,the ones who measure divine favor by the size of their bank accounts, whodeclare that God helps those who help themselves. (Beneath the surface, aren’tthey really saying that God helps only those who help themselves? That’s trueabandonment of faith, because it reduces God to being a cheerleader for thewell-to-do.)I think it’s better to leave faith out of it altogether. Abundance isn’tmaterialistic or religious, either. It’s about trusting the flow, knowing thatwholeness doesn’t have holes in it and never leaves a void. You can be generouswith anything the soul gives you, and more will flow in. Be generous withsympathy, love, intelligence, truth, and creativity. The more you express thesethings, the more will be given to you on all levels. At the same time, don’tturn your soul into an ATM machine. The flow isn’t a straight line from A to B,and when you are generous, there’s no guarantee that a result will follow toyour benefit. Yet in the larger scheme you will be evolving every day, as thesoul, in flowing through you, transforms you at the same time.STEP 5. FOCUS ON RELATIONSHIPS INSTEAD OF CONSUMPTIONWholeness depends on relationships that are whole. You cannot be whole inisolation. Relationship is the true test of any spiritual state; otherwise, youmight be deluding yourself—your ego could be using the soul to build itself up.That’s the point of a famous anecdote from the lore of yoga:A spiritual recluse has been sitting in a cave high up in the Himalayas where hepursues enlightenment night and day. Finally, after years of arduous discipline,the light dawns, and the recluse realizes that he has arrived at the goal.Overjoyed, he descends the mountain to deliver the good news to the localvillagers. When he gets to the outskirts of town, a beggar reeking of alcoholbumps into him. “Watch where you’re going, fool,” the recluse mutters. Suddenlyhe pauses, and without a word he heads back up to his cave.Relationships become whole as you become whole. But the parallel isn’tautomatic. You must place your attention on seeing untold potential in anotherperson. I was deeply touched by a visit to Cuba a few years ago. Taken aroundthe island by my hosts, I saw street singers and dancers, common in India when Iwas a child, but they have now vanished. I saw waitresses smiling and flirtingwith customers in the cafés; a happy atmosphere prevailed almost everywhere, orso it seemed. One day I asked my driver to explain what I was seeing. “We’re toopoor to buy anything,” he told me. “So we have to focus on relationships.” Ithadn’t occurred to me how seriously consumerism undermines relationships. Toconsume is to be focused constantly on material goods, but also on thedistraction they bring, a flood of video games, television, music, high-techgadgets, and on and on.It’s degrading to define anyone as a consumer. The image of a voracious openmouth comes to mind (and the inevitable process of waste removal, once digestionis through). But I don’t want to make this a moral issue. As your soul sees you,you are connected to everything. To be connected means to be in relationship.Beneath every event in the world are underlying threads that tremble like thedisturbance of a spider web. We communicate along these strands of love,sympathy, cooperation, community, and growth. When the strands weaken, so do allthose things. (As we saw previously, children who spend hours at video gamescreate a shift in their brains, acquiring special motor skills at the cost ofsocial skills—they can zap fifty alien invaders a minute, but cannot relate toreal human beings.) Consumerism exerts a hidden toll by shutting off channels ofgrowth. As a substitute, digital culture has come up with networking, whichserves to connect people, usually for a mutual benefit. The more linked you areelectronically, the more tied in you are to a global community. But there’s noemotional bonding or sense of security in a link. Text messaging gets a fewwords across, but they come from the most superficial layer of humaninteraction.If you look at your own life, you can easily measure how much consumerism hasencroached on relationship. The questions are not difficult:Does my family find time to relate to one another?How together do we all feel?Do my children manipulate me to get what they want?Do I placate my children by bribing them with new things to buy?In our family, do we rush to be alone with computers, iPods, TV, and videogames?Can we have a family discussion about what really matters?How often do we deal with problems by seeking more distractions?Do I measure my worth by how much money I have and the possessions I’veaccumulated?Is shopping my therapy?Few people can answer these questions honestly without feeling uneasy. Ofcourse, distractions offer the easy way out, and relationships raise sensitiveissues one would like to avoid. But relating is the only way that any two peoplecan share life together. We don’t have to add qualifiers like committedrelationship, long-term relationship, or even happy relationship. As an emotionor state of mind, happiness can be induced without going to the trouble ofrelating to other people, and at the best of times asking another person to makeyou happy is neither fair nor realistic. What deeply matters in any relationshipis the level of awareness that is involved.On the surface, you relate to someone else to feel better, to get what you want,and to share good things.If you can take the relationship to a deeper level, it exists to share commongoals, to feel supported by another person, and to expand “I” to “we.”If you can go deeper still, a relationship begins to dissolve ego boundaries.The result is a real communion between two people, each living into the other.Finally, at the level of the soul, there is no “other person.” Individualitygives up its claims as the ego surrenders to spirit. At this level youparticipate in wholeness, and all your relationships are expansions ofwholeness.Experts often say, and everyone seems to agree, that relationships are hardwork. That’s certainly true at the ego level, because conflict arises when twoegos come into contact. But relating at the level of ego is doomed to beginwith, because it points in the opposite direction from the soul. Whenever youfind yourself working hard to overcome anything in your relationship—boredom,irritation, hostility, intractable opinions, and areas of disagreement—you’vefallen for the ego’s agenda. Work as hard as you might, you won’t be relating,you will only be negotiating. The secret is to realize that relationships existentirely in awareness. Because you are the source of awareness, you can shiftany relationship within yourself. You don’t have to ask for, demand, ornegotiate change in the other person. I realize that this goes against the grainof counseling and therapy, but keep in mind that people who bring troubledrelationships to a therapist are actually bringing frustrated egos; awarenesslost out before the first hour of counseling began.Once you dedicate yourself to deepening your awareness, relationships mustimprove, because you are sending new energy along the invisible strands thatbond us all. The only caveat is that you must not make awareness a privatepossession, yet another reason to feel isolated. Let the other person have fulladvantage of your inner growth. This means that any impulse of love is for them.Any epiphany exists to be shared. As you expand, you must transform being intodoing. No matter what happens on the surface, however, rest assured thateveryone to whom you relate senses your energy. Bonds don’t lie. They cannot befaked. Which is all the more reason to find the true level where bonding occurs.Only there do relationships stop being work and turn effortless. Once you make abond, there’s no reason to distrust the other person, because the two of you areone in the only way that matters, by sharing in the same wholeness. Loneliness,isolation, and the restless insecurity of the ego are exposed for what theyare—by-products of disconnected souls before they find each other.STEP 6. RELATE TO YOUR BODY CONSCIOUSLYWe have all been trained to ignore the spiritual value of our bodies. Centuriesof programming have fostered the illusion that the body has no mind, certainlyno soul. But as we’ve seen time and again in this book, your body has kept faithwith your soul even when you haven’t. It opens itself to the flow of life. Itsustains every cell through the universe’s infinite supply of energy andintelligence. Ironically, the gratitude given to God should rightfully be givento our bodies, which have sustained us more reliably than any “higher” power.Every day, your body consciously tends to you, never losing focus or attention.You can acknowledge this faithful service by consciously relating to your bodyin turn.Or, to be more precise, you will be completing the circle. Awareness wants toflow freely from body to mind and back again. Too often, however, the body sendsmessages that the mind short-circuits. Certain messages frighten us or undermineour self-image. We don’t have time to hear the body, or we procrastinate becausethere are more important things to attend to. Consider the following everydaysituations:You feel a twinge of pain.You see signs of aging.You feel “not quite right” physically.You notice that your energy is decreasing.You are uncomfortable in your skin.You don’t see a match between how your body looks and the real you inside.There are two ways to relate to these experiences. You can detach yourself fromthe physical sensations and see yourself as separate from them. Or you can thinkof physical sensations as conscious messages from one part of yourself toanother. The first reaction is the easiest and most common. There’s a sense offalse security that comes from ignoring what our bodies have to say. You get tochoose whether to take it seriously; you choose when and where to pay attention.But in essence you are rejecting your body. Real security comes when you relateto your body as consciously as you relate to yourself. Then pain and discomfortacquire a different meaning. They are no longer danger signals that you want torun away from. They are messages asking for a reply. (By analogy, if you’resitting in a restaurant next to a crying baby, your instinct is to be irritated,and if the crying keeps up, you will probably ask for another table. But if it’syour own child crying, your instinct is to move toward the disturbance and tryto make it better.)Relating to your body calls for the same basic attitudes that go into anyintimate relationship. Tending to them every day keeps the relationship healthy. * Trust * Consideration * Honesty * Mutual cooperation * Loving appreciationThese are all aspects of awareness. People focus too much on the physicalchoices that the body presents—whether to take vitamins, how many calories toingest, how much to exercise. Without awareness these considerations tend to befairly useless. Your body knows if you fear it; it rebels at being disciplinedlike a disobedient child; being ignored makes it grow dull and inert. The wholepurpose of consciously relating to your body is to provide the kind offoundation that is really needed. After that, you can take any physical measuresin the right spirit, and that will bring the best results.Trust. Real trust is implicit. It doesn’t depend on shifting moods. It doesn’tneed to be tested or proven. Most people only trust their bodies so far. Theyanticipate a time when the body will bring pain and the distress of aging. Ifyou are on the lookout for what can go wrong physically, you are relating out ofdistrust, the opposite of what needs to exist. So reframe the situation. Thinkof the millions of processes that are being carried out perfectly in billions ofcells every second. Compared to that steady, faithful, perfectly coordinatedfunctioning, the few times that the body shows distress are minuscule. It’s farmore realistic to trust your body than to distrust it. After all, you trust yourmind even though it occasionally breaks out in irrational reactions and issusceptible to moods of depression and anxiety. Your body stands by you withoutasking for any reward, and its steadiness far exceeds the shifting winds of themind.Consideration. Your body doesn’t demand consideration, but it will reward youamply if you show some. It’s considerate to walk away from stressful situations.Stress puts enormous pressure on the body’s coping mechanisms, and that includesthe stress of loud noise, congested work environments, excessive physicaldemands, and emotional upset. You may consider it recreation to run a marathon,for example, but you should consider your body’s viewpoint before demanding thatit obey your desire. Another basic consideration is rest and regular dailyrhythms. Instead of waiting until you are too tired to go on, provide restseveral times a day to your body—all it takes is a few minutes sitting quietlywith your eyes closed. A predictable daily routine for meals and exercise alsoshows consideration. If you are used to irregular habits, it may bore you toadopt new habits, but if you persist for only a week, you will notice a positiveresponse from your body. It will be more relaxed and at the same time moreresponsive and energetic. Even the most minimal effort at exercise, such asgetting up from your desk and stretching every couple of hours, injects a bit ofpersonal attention into the body. Keep in mind that your attention is a basicnutrient that your body needs.Honesty. In personal relationships, it’s a strain to keep up a false front, andthe same is true for relating to our body. In both cases the falseness usuallycomes down to self-image. You look at your body and want it to match your ego’sdesire to look good in the eyes of others. People spend thousands of hours atthe gym, not for the sake of the body, but to satisfy an ego-ideal of beauty,vanity, strength, and security, and to fit in with someone else’s expectations.Body image is a huge problem for many people, and classically women are the mostdistressed about it. You can reframe the whole problem by comparing your body tothe person you love most in the world. Do you really care what that person lookslike in the mirror? Do you denigrate that person for not fitting the image of asupermodel, not being at their ideal weight, not having perfect biceps or bigenough breasts? Does growing older make that person less valuable in your eyes?The reason those considerations don’t matter is that you are relating to aperson, not to an object that must match an ideal image. Now think of your bodyas a person who is just as intimately related to you. You don’t even have tocall this person “me.” By any name, your body has been relating to you as themost faithful of friends, and once you regard it that way, ego image becomesirrelevant. In short, learn to personify your body, and then you won’t be sotempted to objectify it.Mutual cooperation. You can’t expect your body to serve you if you give itnothing to work with. The body of a middle-aged executive isn’t out to sabotagehim when the man decides to shovel a foot of snow from the driveway. But if hehas ignored his heart for years, there is danger in sudden hard exertion,perhaps fatal danger. The key to the body’s reliability lies in cooperation:only ask for as much as you have given. Compared with other intimaterelationships, your body asks for a fraction of what it is willing to give inreturn. This is another area where it helps to personify your body instead ofobjectifying it. Think of your body as a willing worker who wants only a meagersalary, but who cannot survive on nothing. The salary it asks for is paid inpersonal attention. If you genuinely want to cooperate with your body, paying ita little attention makes proper diet, exercise, and rest easy—you will beproviding those things because you want your willing worker to be happilyemployed.Loving appreciation. Your body is going to serve and uphold your interests for alifetime. It’s only fair to appreciate it for this service, and if possible toappreciate it with genuine affection. Most people are far from doing that.Instead they look on their bodies like old models of cars that will need morerepairs and cause more trouble as they wear out. This causes a seriousdisconnect. What they want from life—a future that’s more comfortable andfulfilling—is mismatched to a body that grows more uncomfortable anddisappointing. The mismatch isn’t the body’s fault, however; it’s the product ofbeliefs and assumptions born in the mind. We all relate to loved ones who growolder, and if we’re lucky, we relate to them better as they age. Familiaritybreeds fondness in this case, and appreciation flows more naturally.The same should hold true with your body. Being a familiar companion, you cangrow fonder of it over time. The two of you settle in to a shared life, knowingthings about each other that no one else can possibly know. If this sounds likea marriage, that is rightly so. The highest aim in life is the marriage of mindand soul, and since the body links the two, it deserves to be part of a moreperfect union as the years unfold. This isn’t a fantasy that tries to compensatefor the advance of physical aging. It’s a realistic way to approach your ownawareness. If you aim to be more aware, wiser, and more fulfilled in the future,invite your body to join that future as an equal partner. When body, mind, andsoul are matched, the results will be far different from when they are alienatedfrom one another.STEP 7. EMBRACE EVERY DAY AS A NEW WORLDFor life to turn into a great victory, you have to win many small battles alongthe way. These are fought on the flat landscape of everyday life. We see thesame people each day, by and large, and expect the same things from them. Wework according to a routine that becomes second nature. Lapses into boredom,indifference, and inertia are possible at any time. But beneath this apparentflatness, life is constantly renewing itself. Your cells are never bored,distracted, inert, or detached. They are fully engaged in being alive. Thereseems to be a gap, then, between mind and body. Since the mind sets the body’sagenda, if you lose the tiny battles against routine, inertia, and boredom, thisgap will widen. The flood of renewal will ebb away; forward motion willgradually come to a halt. If you can close this gap, however, the opposite willhappen. Every day will seem like a renewal.There are two sides to every gap. The model for that is the synapse, themicroscopic gap that separates the branchlike ends of brain cells. To have anybrain activity, chemical messages must leap across the synapse. On one side isthe sender, on the other the receiver. Both must be prepared to do their jobimpeccably. When the synapse stops working, the brain goes out of kilter, whichmeans that you experience yourself going out of kilter. Your entire sense ofself depends on what happens in the gap. Researchers have discovered, forexample, that depression is linked to how much serotonin, a specific messengermolecule in the brain, is sent across the synapse and then taken up again toclear the way for the next burst. In a normal brain the right amount ofserotonin crosses the gap, then just enough is reabsorbed to keep sender andreceiver ready for new messages. In a depressed person’s brain, too muchserotonin is reabsorbed, and with depleted supplies, there’s not enough reserveto send the next message properly. Certain receptors get clogged, and others areempty. Without the right balance, you can’t be in a steady, secure mood ofcontentment.That’s a simplified picture, but it says a great deal about how you meet a newday. Your soul sends energy and awareness, which you are set to receive. If yourbrain is occupied with too many old, outworn experiences, you can only receive afraction of the new energy and awareness that is being sent. We all know exactlyhow this feels. Coming out of a failed relationship, for example, you cannotthink about a new relationship. You aren’t receptive on any level, beginningwith the receptors in your brain cells, but extending to your sense of self,what you expect from love, how you view other people, how you cope withdisappointment, and so on. It’s too crude to think in terms only of moleculescrossing a gap. Your whole self comes and goes across the gap, and the receptorsthat your life depends on are receivers of experience across the whole range ofmind and body.When you woke up this morning, the day could have been entirely fresh. Every dayis a new world. Your brain is constructed to receive billions of bits of newdata. Nothing compels it to hold on to old experiences that clog up thereceiving mechanism. The reason today doesn’t feel completely new is that a newself is required. To the extent that you want to bridge yesterday and today withthe same old self, renewal is blocked, just as surely as if you tried to fill abrain receptor when it was already full. Under a microscope a cell biologist cansee the clogged receptors, and on an MRI a neurologist can point to areas of thebrain that aren’t as active as they should be. But we must not fall into thetrap of thinking that matter controls the self. Your brain won’t fill anyreceptors that you want to keep open. If you reinvent yourself every day, youwill experience a new world with every sunrise.Saying such a thing sends up red flags in a materialistic society. Are we sayingthat depressed patients caused their serotonin imbalance? Did they fail toreceive the joy and fulfillment that their souls wanted to give them? The bestanswer to that is ambiguous, unfortunately. The brain is on dual control. Itruns itself automatically, which means that chemical imbalances can build up ontheir own, and distorted patterns of brain activity tend to have their ownmomentum. Once set in place, they recur without outside intervention. So itwould be unfair and medically false to claim that a depressed patient caused hiscondition. On the other hand, people do contribute to their depression. To ahuge degree, brain activity is voluntary. If you drink too much, engage in toxicrelationships, or lack coping skills in times of stress, the result will bedepressed brain function. The shadow zone between the voluntary and theinvoluntary is very hard to define. In the end, each of us lives in both areasand must navigate them as best we can.Fortunately, the vast majority of control lies with you personally. You can say“I want to be new today,” and 90 percent of the work is done. The trick is tosay “I want to be new today” so clearly and with such commitment that themessage is received with no mistakes or confusion. Two brain cells facing eachother across a synapse may act like separate entities, but in reality they arepart of the whole brain. And the brain is part of a larger wholeness—you. Itmakes all the difference that you are both sender and receiver of every message.Most people don’t realize this critical fact; they have constructed a world of“me” and “not me.” As soon as they do that, all kinds of messages bombard themfrom the outside, since “not me” includes other people, the world at large, andNature itself.But if everything is “me,” then all messages are from one aspect of the self toanother. The new day that you awoke to this morning is you in disguise. Itsfresh opportunities come from a level of the self that is invisible andimmaterial; therefore, wearing the disguise of the external world proves veryeffective. When you hear the phone ring and pick it up, you hear a voice that is“not me.” What could be more convincing? But don’t be convinced so easily. Everyexperience this day brought was subjective; it was received, processed, judged,and absorbed by your awareness. Therefore, this day occurred in awareness,nowhere else, and you are awareness.No two people can experience today in the same way. Even one minute cannot beexperienced the same way. Because you are experiencing a unique world, it’s upto you how any given moment is received, processed, judged, and absorbed. Theself performs these tasks, and the quality of the self determines what you getout of life from moment to moment. At a superficial level there is anotherperson talking to you on the phone—a “not me”—but at the soul level one aspectof awareness is sending a message to another aspect.The present moment is the only place where renewal is possible, since we receiveall messages now. Yet there is no special magic in the now. If a great chef putsan enticing meal in front of you, the experience of eating it doesn’t depend onbeing present in the now. All that matters is the quality of the self as itreceives the experience. A distracted person will barely taste the meal, adepressed person will find the food unsavory, but someone in love will think thesame food is divine. So the now is like an open brain receptor waiting for thegive-and-take of the next message.If you are completely open, your awareness alert and expanded, your mind free ofold conditioning, then the now will appear to be magical. In reality, you supplythe magic. Once you realize the central role you play, it comes naturally toembrace every day as a new world. All the things that make it seem like the sameold world reside in you, and by focusing on your personal evolution you can getrid of them, The fog that conceals the new world will keep lifting, until thetime comes when renewal is effortless and spontaneous. That’s the very momentwhen sender and receiver meet in an unbroken embrace.STEP 8. LET THE TIMELESS BE IN CHARGE OF TIMEWe’re told that time should be used wisely, but what does that mean in practice?For most people, it comes down to time management. There are only so many hoursin the day, and if too much time is wasted, the day is gone before you’ve donehalf the things you set out to do. But your soul doesn’t see time that way. Itsframe of reference is timeless. Therefore, using time wisely means using ittimelessly. If you heard someone say, “My life is timeless,” you might haveassumed that they were deeply religious, and being timeless means being close toGod. Or that they lived in a place like the desert where time seems to standstill. There are other possibilities. The person could be devoted tomeditation—a Buddhist, for example, trying to escape the prison of time to reachNirvana. In other words, the word timeless has a mystical ring that may make itconfusing and impractical: if you are realistic, your time is better spenttrying to cram everything into your day that you want to get done.It’s very important to make the timeless practical. If you turn your back andforget that the timeless exists, you are disconnecting from your soul, whichcannot be crammed into a daily schedule. So, is it possible to do the oppositeand expand your life into a timeless schedule? To approach this question, thinkabout the various ways that time can go wrong. We can use one example thatillustrates the hidden trap that time presents. You have decided to go on adream vacation, a trip to the Bahamas that will be like a second honeymoon. Youand your spouse agree that you both deserve a long break, and by leaving therest of the family behind, you hope to rekindle your relationship.Unfortunately, things go unexpectedly awry. Planning the trip eats into thelittle spare time that you have, and you begin to resent your spouse for notdoing his share. Your flight to the Caribbean is canceled, stranding you for aday at the airport. You arrive feeling frazzled, unable to relax untilpractically the day you have to return home. In addition, you spend more timeworrying about the kids you left at home than reconnecting intimately with yourspouse. It’s a relief when the vacation comes to an end, and a month later thewhole notion of a second honeymoon feels like a distant memory.The difference between having a good time and having a bad time actually dependson time itself. In this example, the following things went wrong:Time became too tight and constricting.Time created psychological distress.Under time pressure, experiences felt shallow and unfulfilling.Time didn’t accommodate what you really wanted to happen.If timelessness can solve these problems, it will turn out to be eminentlypractical, because the same ills afflict each of us every day. To begin with,take the most basic complaint that all people share: time is too tight. Underthe pressure of deadlines, with too many demands on our time, daily life becomesa race with too many finish lines that recede ever farther away the faster yourun. Time management attempts to solve this problem, but at best ameliorates it.Work will fill up any time you give it. The solution is to live from a timelessplace. Only when time disappears is there enough. That sounds like a paradox,but here’s the deeper reasoning:Time isn’t separate from you; it’s part of your being. At your source, allevents are laid out with perfect timing. The beginning knows the end. Enoughtime is allotted so that you can not only accomplish all that is needed, but theexperience of moving from A to B will also be fulfilling. In other words, theunfolding of time is actually the unfolding of the self. Time cannot trap theself, meaning the real you.Think of your body when you were in the womb. A normal pregnancy takes ninemonths for only one reason: the full complexity of a newborn child perfectlyfits that span of time. If the embryo needs less or more time, birth adjustsaccordingly. There is no pressure dictating that nine months is a fixeddeadline. In the same flexible way, anything you want to accomplish is packagedwith its own inner schedule. Time submits to your desire, not the other wayaround. If two people read the same book, the important thing is who got themost out of it, not who got finished first.Once you see that time is completely subjective, geared to what you want out oflife, the whole notion of time pressure vanishes. (The British writer DorisLessing, who won the Nobel Prize for literature in 2007, dropped out of schoolin Rhodesia at age fourteen and never returned. She once told an interviewerthat this proved to be an enormous advantage, because instead of reading thebooks that were assigned on schedule in high school and college, she was free topick up any book when and only when it interested her. In that way she got themost out of everything she read, and her life unfolded in sync with the booksthat absorbed her.) If you are tied to an external sense of time, you miss thewhole point of existence, which is not to meet deadlines.The timeless knows how to use time far more efficiently than the human mindcould possibly calculate. We are not even capable of organizing the body’s basicbiological rhythms, which are so complex and interwoven that they must be leftentirely to Nature. But the mind is quite capable of messing up those rhythms.The same holds true for time in general. The mind may arbitrarily decide thatthere isn’t enough time, that time is running out, that things must be done ontime, but in reality the timeless takes care of time. Imagine that you casuallyspend an hour preparing dinner, reading a magazine article, and doing some lighthousekeeping. Each thing is untimed. You have a vague sense that you want to getfood on the table at a certain hour, but otherwise, fitting everything in itsplace is effortless. You even have space to think about what you’ve read andperhaps to entertain a daydream or a future project that is only beginning togestate.Now take the same situation but add a phone call saying that your spouse isbringing the boss home for dinner. Time hasn’t changed, but your psychologicalrelationship to time has. Now you feel pressure, and what was easy to accomplishis overlaid with anxiety. There’s no time to read that magazine article, muchless time for reflection, daydreaming, or planning a future project. You havelost the element of the timeless, whose first quality is that time is taken careof. When the task of time management is turned over to the mind, the order ittries to impose is crude and unsatisfying compared with the spontaneousorganization of the timeless.To be whole, you must let the timeless merge with time. That isn’t a matter ofchanging our attitudes alone. You need to cultivate deep awareness, because onthe surface, awareness shifts constantly as one thing after another claims yourattention. A river runs fastest on the surface, but is nearly motionless at thebottom. Approach your mind that way by finding the still, silent depths thatopen up through meditation. Like a river, your mind’s quiet depths aren’tdetached from the activity on the surface. Every level of the river is made ofthe same water and moves toward the same goal. But the journey becomes much morecomfortable when you aren’t tossed about like a drifting leaf.It’s not at all mystical that a river can be still and moving at the same time.There’s no reason to find mysticism in the mind’s ability to be still and movingat the same time, either. The timeless merges into time as easily as watermerges with water. You can experience this personally. When you discover thatbeing still inside removes the pressure of time, it’s inevitable that you willreach the next step, seeing that when the timeless is allowed to handle time,you will never run out of time or be tied to any deadline. The timeless bringsfreedom, a quality that seeps into time and makes you free this very minute.STEP 9. FEEL THE WORLD INSTEAD OF TRYING TO UNDERSTAND ITYou can’t think your way to wholeness, but you can feel your way there. Leonardoda Vinci spent hundreds of hours near the end of his life trying to figure outthe swirling patterns in water as it wended its way downstream, but he neversucceeded. Flow refuses to be analyzed, and the same holds true for the flow oflife. Yet you were designed with awareness that goes far beyond thinking. Youcan walk into a room and sense if there’s tension in the air. You can sense ifsomeone loves you or not. At a subtler level, you can sense if you belong, or ifit’s safe. These subtle aspects of awareness guide life far more than peoplerealize. It is mainly in their absence that one sees how crippling it can be notto feel the world.Here I’m thinking of a young man I know who fell in love with a woman andquickly moved in with her. She was also very much in love, but soon a strangevein of insecurity was exposed in her. Whenever the young man went into theother room, she followed. If he tried to read a book, it wouldn’t be long beforeshe would ask, “What are you thinking about?” At first he took the questioncasually and would reply, “Nothing in particular. Why?” But soon the situationworsened. Every five minutes she would ask, “What are you thinking about?” andno answer would satisfy her. The young man had no idea where this obsession camefrom, but in the end it caused their relationship to fall apart. Only afterwardsdid he realize that the woman was unable to feel loved. Anytime the young manbecame quiet—while reading, working on the computer, or doing nothing at all—shehad the panicky feeling that he didn’t love her. When she asked, “What are youthinking about?” the only answer that would satisfy her was “I’m thinking ofyou, darling,” and yet even if he gave that answer as affectionately as hecould, she would still feel panicked five minutes later.This is an example of someone who couldn’t sense that she was loved, whichbecame a crippling disability. If you feel unlovable to begin with, you cannotsense that someone else loves you. A fixed thought blocks your awareness. In thesame way, people who don’t feel safe cannot be made to feel safe by any kind ofexternal protection. People who feel unworthy cannot gain self-esteem throughany kind of achievement. If you look deep enough, all these cases illustrate adisconnect between the self and the world. We project how we feel onto theexternal world. If you feel unlovable, the world seems loveless. If you feelunsafe, the world feels dangerous. But isn’t the world a dangerous place? Aren’twe surrounded by unloving actions and widespread indifference? Yes, but thesearen’t absolutes. Sometimes the world is dangerous, but most often it’s not.Love is absent in many situations, but at unexpected moments love shines throughthe darkest situation. Instead of trying to understand the endlessly changingworld, you can feel your way and trust those feelings. Only then will you knowwhat is unfolding around you.To be whole requires a very specific feeling: I am enough. When you feel that,the world will be enough as well. However, if you feel “I am not enough,” theworld always will fall short. You will harbor a vague sense that you somehowlack a critical ingredient for fulfillment, and no matter how hard you try tounderstand it, the missing piece will never be found. Many times in these pagesI’ve said that your body is closer to your soul than you imagine, and this is noexception. Your body knows that it is enough. Cells aren’t insecure or worried.If they could speak, they would assert the following things with completecertainty: * I am self-sufficient. * I am safe. * I know exactly how to live. * Life fulfills my needs. * I belong.Cells live the truth they cannot put into words by constantly beingself-sufficient, fitting in perfectly with every other cell, fulfilling theirrole in the body impeccably. With the body as your foundation, you can feel yourway to the certainty that you are enough. Perhaps you’ve seen widely circulatedvideos of a blind teenager, afflicted with cancer of the eye as an infant, whohas invented his own kind of sonar. Like a dolphin, this boy emits a stream ofclicks several times a second and listens to the echoes they make as the soundbounces off objects. In this way he moves with uncanny grace through a darkworld. The boy rides a bicycle on his own, plays basketball, and performshousehold chores. If he is walking down the sidewalk and senses an objectblocking his path, he can focus his clicking and “see” that the obstacle is atrashcan, which he then walks around. There are a handful of other sightlesspatients in the medical literature who have made this adaptation. Apparentlytheir self-created sonar allows them to form mental pictures made of sound.Only there’s a catch here. The sonar used by dolphins—technically known as“echolocation”—requires incredibly fast sound pulses, up to 1,750 clicks persecond. A blind person could emit five clicks per second at best, not remotelyenough to form a mental image of objects in the near vicinity. How, then, does asightless person see? One answer is that the body has eyes that are not eyes,primitive areas of the brain just above the spinal column at the base of theskull. Without being connected to the visual cortex and to a pair of eyes, thesecells “see” by sensing the outside world directly, the way primitive,single-celled animals steer toward the light. Little is known about “autoscopicvision,” as it has been labeled, but this may explain the popular notion ofhaving eyes in the back of your head—you literally do. (Reliable experimentshave shown that subjects can sense when someone is looking at them from behind,for example.) The most uncanny examples are people who see their own bodiesstanding in front of them. Neurologists have recorded a handful of subjects withthis kind of vision. When someone has a near-death experience and reports risingup in the air and looking down on her dead body, some kind of autoscopic visionmay also be responsible.These examples don’t explain away near-death experiences, or blind people whocan see; they show instead that awareness extends far beyond what we generallyassume. The body is designed to be aware above and beyond the five senses. Ifyou don’t believe that this is true, your mental attitude can block out thesubtle awareness that is meant to guide you. On the other hand, you can acceptthat subtle awareness is real, and once you do, feeling your way through theworld becomes a critical part of the spiritual journey. To go back to the womanwho kept asking, “What are you thinking about?”—if she had possessedself-awareness, she would feel the panic underlying her obsessive question.Tuning in to this feeling of panic, she would become aware that she feltunloved, and then she would plumb that feeling and conclude that at bottom shefeels unlovable. Now a turning point has been reached. She faces a choice.Either being unlovable is a fact that the world keeps cruelly reinforcing, orit’s something she can heal in herself. If she makes the choice to heal herself,the cure is to reconnect with her deepest awareness—her soul—which is the sourceof feeling lovable.In place of “I am unlovable,” one can substitute “I am not safe,” “I am notfulfilled,” or “I have no purpose.” Any sense of lack can be traced back todisconnection from your source. Therefore you can feel your way back and healthe breach. The soul’s entire existence depends on the certainty that it isenough. Being whole, nothing can exist outside it. As you reconnect to yoursoul, feeling your way step by step, your awareness will shift. You are sensingwho you really are. “I am enough” is the goal of all spiritual seeking. The goodnews is that because it is your natural state, your search for wholeness—if youstick with it—is destined to succeed.STEP 10. SEEK AFTER YOUR OWN MYSTERYWholeness is yours if you want it. People want jobs, cars, houses, money, andfamilies. They get those things because they go after them, and society is setup to make that possible. But society isn’t set up for getting wholeness.Everything spiritual has been put into a separate box from material life. It’strue that some people have such strong religious convictions that they want tolive a Christian life or a Jewish life or a Muslim life in every respect. Theadvantage of devoting yourself to religion is that a ready-made path isprovided, along with a strong support group. The problem with devoting yourselfto religion is that it demands conformity, and if you conform so well that youbecome the perfect Christian, Muslim, or Jew, there’s still no guarantee thatyou will be whole.There is no escaping two facts: you must want wholeness as fervently as you wanta job, house, car, and family, and you must be willing to walk the path alone. Iwas deeply moved when the private letters of Mother Teresa were published, yearsafter her death, and the “Mother of Calcutta” revealed that she had neverexperienced God. Despite her decades of devoted service to the poor, and goingagainst her public image as the perfect saint, Mother Teresa didn’t achieve whatshe wanted—personal knowledge of the divine. For many, this was a depressingrevelation. If a saint couldn’t reach her spiritual goals, how can we? I’d liketo suggest that the answer lies in seeking your own mystery, not one that ishanded to you by anyone else. The Buddhists express this by saying, “If you meetthe Buddha on the path, kill him.” What this means is that if you find yourselftrying to conform to a preset ideal, put that notion out of your head.The mystery of life is your mystery to solve. Every step of the way, you mustproceed without preconceptions. It’s quite a trick to maintain your passionwithout a fixed goal in sight. It’s so much easier to say to yourself, “One dayI will be perfect,” or “One day I will meet God, and He will love me.” If youpursue a fixed goal, however, you will be like a railroad train whose wheels areheld between two rails, unable to move right or left of its own volition. Theability to move in any direction at a moment’s notice is critical. Life doesn’tcome at us along railroad tracks. It comes at us from all directions, and forthat reason we need complete freedom of movement, which implies complete freedomof choice. If you have a passion for freedom, that will be good enough at everystage of the spiritual journey.This was vividly illustrated by a recent experiment with mice that sought todiscover how they experienced happiness. Animal researchers define happiness inmice as a brain response. When a mouse is eating, certain areas of its brainlight up, indicating contentment and satisfaction. Later, if the mouse is merelyreminded of food—through a smell, for example—that is enough to light up thesame areas. The situation is similar for human beings. When we are given signalsthat remind us of being happy (not just the smell of food, but also pictures ofloved ones or movies of a beautiful tropical beach), the happiness areas in ourbrains light up.Yet here a mystery arises. When a mouse is reminded of happiness, it seeks toincrease that response; the smell of food makes it hungry and it wants to eat.Human beings don’t pursue happiness in such a linear, predictable way. In termsof the brain, perversity makes no sense. If there is a happiness response, thenatural thing would be to light it up as often as possible. Pigeons in cageswill keep doing the same task a thousand times if it rewards them with a peck offood. Humans, on the other hand, go without food because we can overridebiology. A poor mother gives up her dinner so that her child can eat. Apolitical idealist like Gandhi fasts to stir the conscience of his nation’sBritish oppressors. A supermodel subsists on crackers and lemons to conform tothe shape that allows her to keep her job. In all these cases the word perversemight come to the mind of a brain researcher viewing the situation, but a betterword is transcendent.We override biology to go higher, to fulfill a vision of happiness thattranscends the happiness we have today. Eating is a biological necessity, buttranscending is a human necessity. For us, happiness improves when it has moremeaning, purpose, intensity, and wholeness. For millions of people, those thingsare supplied by their jobs, houses, cars, money, and a family. But if youimagine that you will be perfectly fulfilled once you have all of them, there’sa surprise in store for you. The moment you achieve any plateau of satisfaction,a new horizon will open, and your desire to reach that horizon will be as strongas any desire you’ve ever felt.That, ultimately, is the mystery. Human beings can never be satisfied withlimited fulfillment. We are designed to transcend. As much as you might try toignore the yearning inside you, it cannot be stifled. You will seek a betterkind of happiness, and in so doing, you will be seeking your own mystery. It isthat mystery which pertains to common humanity. It brings you up to the level ofBuddha and Jesus, and brings them down to your level. The same yearning totranscend unites you, your soul, and every soul. Therefore, you will never haveto ignite your passion to be whole. The passion is in you already. It is yourbirthright."},{"pageContent":"CONCLUSION:“WHO MADE ME?”[images/Chop_9780307452344_epub_L02_r1.jpg]Life moves forward by asking the right questions. The first question I rememberasking (which my children asked me in turn) was “Who made me?” Children arenaturally curious about where they came from. Children take creation personally,as well they should. Yet in their innocence they get steered in the wrongdirection. They are told that God made them, or that their parents made them,without revealing the truth, which is that none of us really knows who made us.We have taken one of the most profound mysteries and dismissed it with clichés.We shrug and pass on the answer our parents gave us.The truth can only be found by exploring who you are. After all, “Who made me?”is the most intimate and personal of questions. You can’t know where you belongin the world unless you know where you came from. If you believe the religiousanswer, that God made you, you will have certainty but no useful knowledge; themystery of life has been outsourced to Genesis, and the book is closed. This iswhy people who want useful knowledge have turned to science. Science holds thatcreation is random, a matter of swirling gases exploding at the moment of theBig Bang. This view at least gives us an ongoing creation. Energy and matterwill continue to produce new forms for billions of years, until an exhausteduniverse has no more energy to give. But a huge price is paid for choosingscientific knowledge. You no longer have a loving, caring Creator. Like everyother object, your body is an accidental product of drifting stardust that couldjust as easily have been sucked out through a black hole. There is no ultimatemeaning to life, and no purpose except the ones we make up and fight over.I have never been able to accept either answer, and my doubt gave rise to thesepages, where I’ve offered a third way. I have tried to reclaim the sacred natureof the body, which is like a forgotten miracle in its exquisite order andintelligence, while supplying useful knowledge of the kind science seeks tofind. To uncover that knowledge, we’ve had to cross over into the invisibleterritory where materialism feels uncomfortable. But although such things asawareness, intelligence, creativity, and the soul are unseen, this should notdelude us into dismissing them as unreal. They are real to us as humans, andthat’s what counts in the end, because the mystery we want to solve is our own.I hope the arguments I’ve made for reinventing the body in terms of energy andawareness come through to you as credible. I believe them fervently, as Ibelieve in bringing the soul back into everyday life. But in the back of my mindI hear myself asking, as I did when I was four years old, “Who made me?”It is with this, the simplest and yet most profound question, that a spiritualadage comes true. The journey is the answer. To find your creator, you mustexplore the universe until he (or she) appears. In ancient India it was heldthat all creation was compressed into a human being; therefore, to explore theuniverse, you needed only to explore yourself. But if you are an objectivist,you can turn the other way and explore the outer world. Following every clue,you will be led eventually to the last frontier of creation, and then you willbe overwhelmed by awe. Albert Einstein declared that no great scientificdiscovery has ever been made except by those who kneel in wonder before themystery of creation. Wonder is a subjective feeling. Even if you turn outward,you wind up confronting yourself—a blazing galaxy is wondrous only because humaneyes are gazing upon it, and the need to understand our wonder is a human need.Earlier I quoted an old guru who said that the best way to meet God is to admirehis (or her) creation so intensely that the Creator comes out of hiding to meetyou. This is rather like an artist who hears about someone who loves hispaintings with unbounded enthusiasm. What artist could resist meeting such anadmirer? There’s a trick to this simple fable, of course, because anyone who hasexplored Creation to the point of going beyond light and shadow, good and evil,inner and outer, has connected with God already. At that point you and yourcreator share the same love. Then the only answer to “Who made me?” is “I mademyself.”We can allow for the howls of outrage from those who read blasphemy in the ideathat human beings created themselves. But no one is usurping God’s privileges.The level at which we create ourselves is the level of the soul. The soul isyour sacred body. It is the junction point between infinity and the relativeworld. In that regard I disagree with Einstein. I don’t think human awarenessmust stand in awe before infinity. The thinking mind may be forced to do that,but where thinking fails, consciousness is free to go on. Thinking neverinvented love, desire, art, music, kindness, altruism, intuition, wisdom, andpassion—in fact, all the things that make life worthwhile. When the thinkingmind halts in awe before God’s creation, love has light-years yet to go; desirestill reaches out for more. The process of reinventing the body and resurrectingthe soul is a journey, and the journey never ends."},{"pageContent":"[images/Chop_9780307452344_epub_L01_r1.jpg]ACKNOWLEDGMENTSIn this book I wanted the reader to grasp that life is a process That truthsinks in when a book is being produced. The process needs an astute andsympathetic editor like Peter Guzzardi, who knows how to steer errant chaptersback on the right track. In many ways he is the silent author of the finalmanuscript. This book crucially needed the supportive environment provided atthe publisher’s by Shaye Areheart and Jenny Frost. Without their belief in theprinted word, my writing would never be allowed to serve a higher purpose.
