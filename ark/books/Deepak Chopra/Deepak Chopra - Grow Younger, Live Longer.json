The essential message of the book wasthat the human body is not a piece of biological machinery that deterioratessteadily and inexorably over time. Rather, human beings are magnificentlyorganized networks of energy, information, and intelligence in dynamic exchangewith their environment, fully capable of transformation and renewal. Since thepublication of Ageless Body, Timeless Mind, thousands of patients at the ChopraCenter for Well Being have experienced profound changes in the quality of theirlives by applying the principles presented in that book, which at this writingis in its eleventh printing. According to many readers and literary critics,Ageless Body, Timeless Mind remains a classic, consciousness-based approach tothe reversal of aging.Grow Younger, Live Longer: 10 Steps to Reverse Aging extends thisconsciousness-based approach and includes ten practical steps that can becomehabit-forming, enabling you to reset your Biostat (your biological, orfunctional, age) up to fifteen years younger than your chronological age. Wehave intentionally made this new book simple and practical, so you can beginimplementing these approaches right away. By integrating these insights andpractices into your lifestyle, you will notice immediate improvements in yourphysical and emotional well-being. As you begin to reverse your biological age,you will reclaim the ability to tap into your inner reservoir of unlimitedenergy, creativity, and vitality. You will feel younger and you will functionlike a much younger person, too.Our generation has been celebrated for its willingness to challenge theprevailing assumptions of society. Rather than viewing the second half of lifeas a time of progressive deterioration in body and mind, we see aging as anopportunity for greater wisdom, love, creativity, meaning, joy, and increasedmental and physical capacity. More people than ever before are living into theireighties, nineties, and beyond with sound bodies and clear minds.This book is designed as a manual for renewal. Three very practicalrecommendations are suggested for each of the ten steps. Each week we encourageyou to implement the action steps so that by the end of ten weeks you are takingfull advantage of all the resources available to you. Although awareness is theessential first step in any transformation, unfortunately, reading this book isnot enough for you to begin reversing the aging process—you have to actuallyexecutethe recommendations on a daily basis in order to reap the benefits ofthis program.Readers familiar with our previous works may ask if it really matters that wereverse our aging. If, as we often state, we are immortal souls on an eternalcosmic highway without beginning or end, if our essential nature istranscendental reality not subject to the laws of the material world, does itreally matter if we grow younger and live longer? Why should we care aboutmaintaining a youthful appearance for an extended time? Is it mere vanity? Doesit take our attention away from our true self?To those of you who ask these questions, we answer that in the deeper reality,all is play. Life is a cosmic game of hide and seek in which we lose ourselvesto find ourselves. At our core we are all members of the same being and it doesnot matter if we are young or old, villain or hero, sinner or saint. The realpurpose of the book is to remind you, the reader, that this deeper reality, thedomain of pure potentiality, of spirit, is the essence of who you really are.Reversing aging and growing younger is part of the possibility. Whether youchoose to activate this choice and implement this possibility is up to you.We believe our primary purpose here is to seek the pure spiritual potential thatis available to all of us. As human beings, the vehicles we use to explore ourspiritual potential are the human body, the human nervous system, and the humanmind. We therefore believe it is worth focusing attention on maintaining optimalfunctioning of our body/mind so we can seek our true nature as spiritual beings.The experience of life through a human nervous system is a miraculous gift ofcreation. We are blessed among species in that we can change our perceptions,interpretations, and expectations of life and thereby transform our reality. Asa result of changing our perceptions and taking new action steps, we canliterally create a different physical body. As an expression from the ancientAyurvedic system of healing tells us, To know a person’s experiences from thepast, examine their body now. To know a person’s body in the future, examinetheir experiences now.The basis of these principles and of this book is that every impulse ofexperience is transformed into the chemistry and electricity of your body. Withevery thought, sensation, and feeling you have, your nervous system undergoessubtle shifts in physiology, generating chemical messengers that regulate yourbody. These biochemical communicators continuously mold the molecules thatcomprise your cells, tissues, and organs.The field of mind/body medicine declares that you can influence your health andwell-being through the choices you make. Your mind and body are intimatelyinterwoven so that changes in one instantaneously influence the other. Ourpersonal and professional experience at the Chopra Center makes us confidentthat applying the principles and practices offered in this program will enhancethe way you think and the way you feel. You have the capacity to reverse youraging. This book provides the tools. We welcome you on this journey to renewaland look forward to hearing about your success."},{"pageContent":"How to Use This BookHuman aging is reversible.

Ifyouare committed to growing younger, you must escape this prison ofconditioning. You are not to blame for living within unnecessary limitations. Ifa rope is tied around the leg of a baby elephant and attached to a stake in theground, it learns that it can move only within very narrow limits. Years later,as a powerful adult, it still remains within narrow confines when its leg isstaked, even though it has the strength to uproot an entire tree. It has beenconditioned to accept the limitations imposed upon it.In a similar way, most people think and act within the narrow limitations ofwhat they have been taught during childhood, without questioning the basicassumptions that structure their worldview. To live a healthier, richer, morecreative life you need to recognize that most of what you hold to be truederives from habits of thought. We are born into a prevailing conversation aboutthe world. As soon as we are capable of speaking, we engage in thisconversation, reinforcing with our own thoughts and actions the patterns ofthinking and behavior that surround us. This is unmistakably true in regards tohow we view the body and its aging.Until recently, few have questioned the assumption that aging is irreversible,and therefore, for generation after generation, people have reinforced thehabitual thinking that growing older meant a progressive decline in mental andphysical capacity. It is now time to change our habits of thinking and behavingand alter our experience of the body and the aging process.The Quantum PossibilitiesDrawing upon the wisdom traditions of the East, the dramatic new discoveries ofmodern quantum physics, and our own personal and professional experience, weinvite you to change the way you think about and experience the world and yourbody. Despite how radical some of these ideas may at first appear, we encourageyou to try out the practical approaches we offer and experience for yourself howthis program can revitalize your body and mind.From the perspective of quantum physics, reality is a mysterious, magical place.While on the physical plane of everyday life, time and space predominate andentropy, decay, and aging are the normal course of events, these are notfeatures of quantum reality. The quantum realm is the fountainhead of purepotentiality, giving rise to the raw material of your body, your mind, and thephysical universe. The quantum realm is the womb of creation, the invisibleworld where the visible is designed and assembled. We can summarize the keyprinciples of quantum physics in five main points:In the quantum realm there are no fixed objects, only possibilities.In the quantum realm, everything is interwoven and inseparably one.Quantum leaps are a feature of the quantum realm. A quantum leap is the abilityto move from one location in space or time to another without having to gothrough any place or time in between.One of the laws of the quantum realm is the Uncertainty Principle, which statesthat an event is a particle (matter) and a wave (energy) simultaneously. Yourintention determines whether you see a particle or a wave.In the quantum realm, an observer is needed to create an event. Before asubatomic particle is observed, it exists only as a virtual particle; all eventsare virtual events until the moment they are observed.Your own body/mind system is also an expression of the same quantum field thatunderlies everything in the universe. Therefore, you can apply these quantumprinciples to the way you look at your body and aging. Rephrased in terms ofyour biology, they would be:You are not merely the physical body that you identify with out of habit. Youressential state is a field of infinite possibilities.Your body is inseparably one with the whole universe. When you are perfectlyhealthy or whole, you feel expanded. You become constricted only when you havediscomfort or dis-ease. This comes from a feeling of separation.You are capable of taking quantum leaps in perception and interpretation. Withthese quantum leaps you can alter not only the experience of the physical bodybut its very structure. Your physical body is capable of taking a quantum leapfrom one biological age to another without having to go through all theintervening ages in between.Your body is simultaneously material (particlelike) and non-material (wavelike).You can choose to experience your body as physical or as a network of energy,transformation, and intelligence.Before you decide which biological age you choose to experience, you are allpossible biological ages. It’s up to you to decide what age you want to be.If you choose to see yourself as a physical entity, separate from everythingelse, you discard the chance to reverse the aging process. If you are able tolook at yourself as a field of possibilities, intimately interrelated toeverything else, wonderful new opportunities emerge. We encourage you to usethese thoughts to trigger a paradigm shift in your awareness. With this shiftyou can gain a completely different understanding of the body/mind system youinhabit, the world you perceive, and the essence of your being.Viewing your body from the perspective of quantumphysics opens up new modes of understanding andexperiencing the body and its aging.The practical essence of this new understandingis that human beings can reverse their aging. In the Language of SpiritKnowledge traditions seek to understand and explain the workings of the cosmos.The perspective of quantum physics offers a fascinating way to view life, thebody, and aging. The perennial wisdom traditions of the East offer equallyamazing insights into the nature of reality. As explorers of both modern scienceand the ancient knowledge traditions, we are enthused and inspired by the closerand closer alignment between these different perspectives on life. According toAyurveda, the ancient healing tradition of India, aging is an illusion becauseyour true self is neither your body nor your mind. Your essential nature, whoyou really are, is the domain of ever-present witnessing awareness that isbeyond your physical and mental layers. This field of consciousness gives riseto both the thoughts in your mind and the molecules in your body. Tapping intothis realm of awareness where time and space have no meaning is the basis ofemotional and physical renewal.Accessing this field of pure potentiality has spiritual as well as physicalconsequences. Knowing your essential self as a nonlocal being, inextricablyinterrelated to everything else in the cosmos, awakens greater creativity,meaning, and purpose in life. Although the most profound way to improve healthand reverse aging is ultimately a spiritual one, not everyone is immediatelyready to accept this approach. One person may want to lose weight, another mayneed help to stop smoking, while a third may be seeking a more fulfilling loverelationship. Each of these needs is important in its own right, but taking aspiritual approach opens the door to the evolution of consciousness, which canmake all these things possible, and many more.A spiritual approach means that we expand ourawareness,even while focusing our attention and intention locally. The reason we perform any action is in the hope that it will bring ussatisfaction, fulfillment, and happiness. Embracing the spiritual domain, whichis the source and goal of all desires in life, creates the possibility forsatisfaction, happiness, and fulfillment independent of the inevitably changingsituations, circumstances, and people that surround us. Those fortunate ones whodwell in this domain have achieved what is often called enlightenment.Viewing your choices from a spiritual perspective means asking the bigquestions: Who are you? Why are you here? What do you really want? How can youbest serve? Although at first glance these questions may seem irrelevant toslowing the aging process, they are actually essential to renewal. Shifting yourinternal reference point from an egocentric being, whose sense of worth dependsupon the positions and possessions one has accumulated, to a network ofconscious energy, woven from the threads of universal intelligence, has aprofound effect on your mind and body. When you become clear that the reason youwant to live to a hundred or more years is so you can express your full creativepotential, you change your chemistry and physiology. When you identify yourunique talents and commit to using them in the service of others, you strengthenyour immune system. When you decide that exercising regularly or preparing abalanced meal is an enjoyable experience, you improve your circulatoryhealth andlower your blood pressure. Your perceptions, interpretations, and expectationsinfluence every aspect of your mental and physical health. Shifting yourperspective and making new choices provide you with powerful tools to changeyour life.The Window to RenewalOne of the ways science makes major advances is by studying situations,circumstances, and events that are the exception to the usual way things work.These are sometimes called anomalies, or exceptions to the rule. Most scientistsignore anomalies, but in fact, these are the very things we should be studying.If something breaks the rule, no matter what it is, no matter how infrequent itis, no matter how remote the probability, it means that a new possibility hasarisen. And if a new possibility has presented itself, there must be amechanism. Even if only one person out of ten million cures himself of cancer orof AIDS, we have to pay attention. Most scientists tend to disregard events thatare so rare they do not regularly infringe upon the prevailing view of theworld. They may dismiss an anomaly by saying that it is so rare—one in tenmillion—what’s the point of investigating it?The point is that it doesn’t matter if something happens only once in tenmillion, because if it has happened even once, there must be some mechanism toaccount for its occurrence. And if there is a mechanism, then as scientists wewant to know what that mechanism is, because once we understand the mechanism,we may be able to reproduce the phenomenon.Galileo, Copernicus, Newton, and Einstein are examples of scientists whoquestioned the prevailing assumptions of their time and expanded their view toinclude phenomena that had previously been ignored. These and other greatscientists paid attention to anomalies and sought to understand the mechanismthat explains them. When something doesn’t fit the paradigm, doesn’t fit thepattern, doesn’t fit the theory, it forces us to examine the model we are using.It compels us to expand or change the theory to incorporate the exceptionalsituation.A good example of this is a friend of ours who was diagnosed with AIDS overfifteen years ago. He was close to death when he made the choice to change hislife. He started meditating, began eating a healthy diet, and made thecommitment to eliminate toxins from his life. Fifteen years later he is feelingcompletely well and has undetectable levels of the HIV virus in his blood. Whenwe first met him, he was an anomaly, but now we know many more people like him.Our theory of consciousness predicts that if we reach a critical mass of peoplewho have the same experience, then it will become true for everyone.We believe that these same principles apply to human aging. If we look at recenthistorical times we see that the average life expectancy has shifted remarkably.The average life span of a human being during the Roman Empire was twenty-eightyears. The average life span of a human being born in the Western world at thebeginning of the twentieth century was forty-nine years. Although in the past,high rates of infant mortality influenced human life expectancy, thefastest-growing segment of the American population today is over the age ofninety years.A baby girl born in America today is expected to live just less than eightyyears; an infant boy has a life expectancy of almost seventy-four. Historically,there are many people who have lived to ripe old ages and have made majorcontributions to civilization. Leonardo da Vinci was drawing sketches in hissixties, Leo Tolstoy was writing novels into his seventies, and Michelangelo wassculpting in his eighties. Winston Churchill, with his fondness for cigars andScotch, was active and productive until his death at age ninety. As ourcollective consciousness embraces the belief that we can have the biology ofyouth with the wisdom of experience, it will become the pervasive experience.The Science of AgingRecognizing that human beings do not age at the same rate, scientists havedescribed three different ways to characterize a person’s age. The first ischronological age, which is what your birth certificate says. Your chronologicalage measures the number of rotations Earth has performed on its axis and aroundthe sun since you left your mother’s womb. Your chronological age cannot bealtered through mind/body approaches, but it has the least relevance to how youfeel or function.Biological age is a measurement of how well your physiological systems arefunctioning. It is the most important component of the aging process. Yourbiological age is calculated in reference to an average population of people whohave the same chronological age that you have. Values for almost everybiochemical and physiological process can be determined for different agegroups. Known as the biological markers, or biomarkers, of aging, these includeblood pressure, amount of body fat, auditory and visual thresholds, hormonallevels, immune function, temperature regulation, bone density, skin thickness,cholesterol levels, blood sugar tolerance, aerobic capacity, and metabolic rate(see the table on page 18). Once you know your results, you can compare themwith the group average and see if your biomarkers are older or younger than yourchronological peers. Your biological age can be very different from yourchronological age. A fifty-year-old who takes good care of herself can have thebiology of a thirty-five-year-old. Alternatively, a fifty-year-old who has notbeen attentive to his health may have the biology of men many years older.Whatever your biological age is today, we believe we can alter it byimplementing the changes recommended in this book.Biological age is the key component of the aging process.Psychological age is your subjective experience of how old you feel. We meetmany people in their sixties who report that they feel better than they did intheir thirties. In prior times they may have been smoking two packs ofcigarettes a day, were unhappy in their jobs, and were not eating well. Sinceinstituting the ten steps to reverse aging, their mental and physical well-beinghas dramatically improved. They have learned to relax and enjoy life, soalthough they are chronologically older, they unequivocally feel younger thanthey did years ago. Psychological age is closely linked to biological age. Whenthe body is functioning in a more efficient, energetic manner, we experiencethis vitality as feeling more alive.Although we cannot reverse our chronological age, we can reverse the moreimportant measures of our biological and psychological age—and by so doing canregain the physical and emotional vitality we had in the past.The Biomarkers of AgingAEROBIC CAPACITYANTIOXIDANT LEVELSAUDITORY THRESHOLDBLOOD PRESSUREBLOOD SUGAR REGULATIONBODY FATBONE DENSITYCHOLESTEROL AND LIPID LEVELSHORMONAL LEVELSIMMUNE FUNCTIONMETABOLIC ACTIVITYMUSCLE MASSMUSCLE STRENGTHSKIN THICKNESSTEMPERATURE REGULATIONVISUAL THRESHOLDResearch into AgingIn the 1970s, Alexander Leaf, a Harvard doctor, journeyed around the worldseeking the secret to a long, healthy life. He visited communities in thesouthern republics of the former Soviet Union, northern Pakistan, and the AndesMountains of Ecuador, where it was rumored that many people were living dynamic,vital lives well into their eighties, nineties, and beyond. In many cases, thesestories were true. Leaf discovered that the one consistent feature of thesepeople living in widely separated regions of the world was their attitude aboutaging. Simply stated, in these societies, growing older meant growing better;vibrant centenarians were revered for their knowledge, physical vitality, andpersonal presence. They had the wisdom of experience with the biology of youth.Another interesting study was performed by Harvard psychologist Ellen Langer.She took groups of men in their seventies and eighties and encouraged them tothink and behave as if they were twenty years younger. After doing this for onlyfive days, these men showed a number of physical changes associated with agereversal. Their hearing and vision improved, they performed better on tests ofmanual dexterity, and had improved joint mobility.Both of these studies tell us the same thing. Expectations determine outcomes.If you expect your mental and physical capacity to diminish with age, itprobably will. If you have the expectations that you can grow younger and livelonger, this will be your experience. As more and more people shift theirexpectations and experience reversal of aging for themselves, it will become theexpectation of everyone.Restoring Your Life EnergyWhen a doctor wants to check the status of a specific biochemical in your body,he draws blood for analysis. The results obtained from scrutinizing a minutesampling are accepted as being true for the entire body. For example, if we wantto check your blood sugar level, we need to examine only a minuscule amount thatcan be collected from a tiny pinprick. We assume that what is true for one dropof blood is true for every drop in your body. This assumption is a result of therecognition that the body is holographic. This means that the whole is containedin every part; whenever one aspect changes, everything changes.Applying this principle to the reversal of aging, you can see that making ahealthy shift in any one component of your life will have a positive influenceon your entire state of well-being. The more you are able to replacelife-damaging choices with life-affirming ones, the more profound the benefitsyou will experience physically, emotionally, and spiritually. When you reverseone biological marker of aging, you will reverse almost all the others. Forexample, improving your muscle strength leads to an increase in bone density.Improving your aerobic capacity enhances your immune function. Ourten-steps-to-reverse-aging program is therefore a practical holistic approach tocreating a profoundly better quality of life. These approaches are simple yetpowerful and we are enthusiastic to share them with you.The body is holographic; therefore,when you change one biomarkeryou influence them all. The conditioning of our society leads us to believe that as we grow older, wedeteriorate physically and mentally. When you break out of this conditioning,you will learn from your own experience that every day in every way you canincrease your physical and mental capacity. That is the promise of this book. Ifyou practice the ten steps you will reverse your biological age, and biologicalage is the only age that really matters."},{"pageContent":"image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_009_r1.jpg]2image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_010_r1.jpg]You Can Reverse YourBiological Age by ChangingYour Perceptions ACTION STEP #1I am reversing my biological age by changing my perceptions of my body, itsaging, and of time.I put this into practice by:Changing my perception of aging by resetting my Biostat and practicing on adaily basis the rituals that remind me of my biological set point.Changing my perception of time by the practice of self-referraltechniques,bringing my attention to the nonchanging factor in the midst of change.Changing my perception of my body by learning to experienceit as a field ofenergy, transformation, and intelligence, practicing the Energy, Transformation,and Intelligence technique.image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_011_r1.jpg]Perceptions create reality.By changing your perceptionsyou change your reality.By changing the perceptionof your body, its aging, and of time,you can reverse your biological age. image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_012_r1.jpg]image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_013_r1.jpg]A basic principle of Ayurveda is stated as: What you see you become. What yousee is a selective act of attention and interpretation. Although you areinundated by billions of bits of sensory impulses every moment, you selectivelyfilter out the vast majority, allowing only a very small fraction into yourawareness. What you allow into your awareness is determined by your habitualpatterns of seeing and interpreting the world.To make this point clear, consider a situation in which you and your friend aresitting on a park bench. Across the street a woman is walking her beagle. Yourfriend, the manager of a woman’s apparel store, hones in on what the woman iswearing, scrutinizing her outfit. Deciding that she does not like what the womanis wearing, your friend feels mildly annoyed. As an animal lover, you barelynotice the woman but instead focus on her dog, which reminds you of a puppy youhad as a child, and as a result, you feel a little wistful. What is the reality?It is clearly different for both of you as a result of your selective acts ofattention and interpretation.Reality is flexible and subject to revision.Reality is the result of perception,which is a selective act of attention and interpretation. There are many visual examples of this principle. Each of the four pictures thatfollow demonstrates how your attention and interpretation determine yourreality. The sensory data does not change when you make the leap from oneinterpretation to another. What you see changes as a result of a change in yourconsciousness.image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_014_r1.jpg]Can you see the chalice? Can you see the faces?image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_015_r1.jpg]Can you see the old woman? Can you see the young woman?image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_016_r1.jpg]Do you see the face? Do you see the word?image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_017_r1.jpg]Do you see the bird? Do you see the rabbit?Your attention and interpretations create what you see and ultimately determinewhat you believe. A belief is simply an interpretation that you hold to be true.For example, due to habits of perception, most people half a millennium agobelieved that the sun revolved around Earth. When Copernicus suggested that ourplanet was not the center of the universe, people were upset because challengingprevailing beliefs inevitably generates resistance. However, new ideas thatexpand awareness, enhance life, and take us closer to truth are contagious.Before long, a critical mass of people embrace the new idea, and their beliefsabout themselves and the world are forever changed.As we enter the new millennium, the insights of our most advanced scientists arejust beginning to influence our collective views. Our ideas about the humanbody, its aging, and even time itself are undergoing a dramatic shift, openingthe possibility for unprecedented health, vitality, and longevity. Let’s look athow we may begin to embrace these more expanded and empowering beliefs.Your habits of attention and interpretation create deeplyingrained beliefs,which are the interpretations you hold to be true.Beliefs create biology. Change Your Perception of AgingThe only true way to measure the aging process is through the biomarkers ofaging. By now you know that the biological markers of aging are reversible (seepage 18 to review the biomarkers of aging). Now it is time to use the organizingpower of your intention to set a clear expectation to reverse your aging. Yourintentions establish your expectations, and your expectations influence outcome.We know from many scientific studies that whatever you anticipate happening withyour health is much more likely to occur. Doctors sometimes ridicule this as theplacebo effect, but the placebo effect is a testimony to the power of intention.When a doctor and a patient believe in a treatment, the positive results can beas high as 100 percent, even if the treatment is later found to have nopharmacological effect. If patients with asthma are given salt water and told itwill help their breathing, they will breathe more easily due to the placeboeffect. Given the same salt water with the suggestion that their breathing willworsen, they experience the expected deterioration. This is called the noceboeffect. In every condition imaginable—from high blood pressure to cancer, fromstomach ulcers to anginal heart pain—your expectations can make the differencebetween health and illness, life and death. We can summarize this principle inone line: What you believe you become.We can use this principle to great effect. Set the intention to grow younger andlive longer. Your intention is a powerful activator of your inner pharmacy. Yourexpectation of growing younger will lead to the reversal of your aging.SETTING YOUR BIOSTATClose your eyes. Become aware of your breath, releasing any tension you may beholding in your body. Now, choose an age within the last fifteen years that youwould like to be in biological terms. This means you would like to have thephysical and mental capacity of a healthy person at that age, that you wouldlike your biomarkers to reflect that particular age, that you would like to feeland look that particular age. As an example, let’s assume you are sixty yearsold. Choose an age between forty-five and sixty. Let’s say you choose the age offorty-nine years. This becomes your Biostat— your set point in consciousness.Just as a thermostat adjusts the temperature in a room to a particular setpoint, so, too, your Biostat will orchestrate your psychology and biology aroundthe biological age you have chosen.This will happen through the following mechanisms: (1) Your intention to stay ata particular Biostat will directly influence your body of energy,transformation, and intelligence. This is because intention influences yourbiochemistry through its infinite organizing power. This is the principle ofteleology, which states that intended outcomes orchestrate the biologicalmechanisms to fulfill themselves. (2) Keeping your Biostat in your awarenesswill influence your thinking, your moods, and your behavior and reinforce yourintention to maintain your biology at that set point. Once you have identifiedyour set point, begin affirming it five times a day. We suggest practicing thefollowing ritual upon awakening, before breakfast, before lunch, before dinner,and at bedtime. On each of these occasions close your eyes and mentally repeatto yourself each of the following phrases at least three times:image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_018_r1.jpg]Every day in every way, I am increasingmy mental and physical capacity.My Biostat is set at a healthy image[images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_019_r1.jpg]years of age.I look and feel a healthy image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_020_r1.jpg]yearsold. Within a few days of performing this ritual you will actually begin to think andact from the level of your Biostat. All your habits will be influenced, but evenmore important, your perception of your biological age and your experience of itwill begin to shift. You will start to believe in your Biostat and itsorganizing power and your new belief will shape your new biology.Change Your Perception of TimeTo reverse the aging process you need to change your perception of time becausehow you perceive time regulates your biological clock. To do this, you need toask a crucial question: What is time? In the physical world we use time tomeasure the flow of events in our lives. And yet we know that our experience oftime is fluid. Dreamtime, for example, is very different from waking time. Whenyou are dreaming, many things can happen in a very short time, because in thatstate you have an entirely different perception of time. In the quantum realm,time obeys a different set of rules. Cause and effect are nonlinear, and eventsthat we would normally consider “the future” are capable of influencing eventsin “the past.” When we glimpse the realm of spirit through meditation or anawe-inspiring experience, we enter a domain that is beyond time and space. Theexperience of this is called timeless mind. Since mind and body are inseparable,a timeless mind is also an ageless body. When our mind comes to a standstill,time comes to a standstill and our biological clock stops.One of the ways to define aging is to see it as the metabolism of time. Imaginefor a moment that you could metabolize eternity or infinity instead of time. Youwould literally have an immortal body. The ancient seers of the Vedic traditionclaimed that even occasional excursions into this timeless or eternal domain ofconsciousness could influence the biological clock and extend life by manyyears.The human body and its biological functions respond to the experience of time.Your biological clock beats to your personal experience of time. To paraphraseEinstein, when asked to explain the theory of relativity in a way that wasmeaningful to everyday experience, he said, “If I burn myself on a hot stove,that fraction of a second seems like eternity. But if I’m with a beautifulwoman, even eternity seems like one second. It’s gone in a moment. It’s neverenough.”The experience of time is subjective. If you are always in a hurry, yourbiological clock speeds up. If you feel you have all the time in the world, yourbiological clock slows down. During meditation, when you enter into the gapbetween thoughts, time stops. That also happens when you’re playing a game youenjoy, when you are listening to great music, when you experience the beauty innature, and when you fall in love. Time is a subjective experience inconsciousness and that subjective experience translates into a biologicalresponse in your body.ACCESSING THE NONCHANGING FACTORAlthough experiences change, the one who is having the experience resides in thedomain of nonchange. Even in the midst of any experience you can access theexperiencer by a simple shift of your attention. Try this simple exercise: Asyou read these words, ask yourself, “Who is reading?” Now, look around the roomin which you are sitting and while you are looking, silently ask yourself, “Whois observing?” If there is a radio playing or a conversation taking place in thenext room, as you are listening to the sounds in your environment ask yourself,“Who is listening?” As you consciously make these subtle shifts in yourawareness, you will recognize that the answer to each of these questions is thesame. The one who is reading, the one who is observing, and the one who islistening is not restricted to any particular experience. It is not restrictedto time or place. There is a silent witness within you that is the same presencethat was you as a child, a teenager, an adult, and now. It is the essence of whoyou are. According to Ayurveda, this silent witness is your Spirit. When yourinternal reference point shifts from your experiences to the one who isexperiencing, you break the barrier of time.Practice shifting your attention to the nonchanging factor in the midst ofchange. You do this by asking “Who is having the experience?” and referring backto your witnessing self. This practice is called self-referral because you areshifting your attention to the “Self” of experience. When your attention is onthe objects of experience, the experience itself, that quality of awareness isknown as object-referral. A shift in attention from object-referral toself-referral is a shift from time-bound awareness (time-bound mind) to timelessawareness (timeless mind) because the Self is the timeless factor in the midstof time-bound experience.There are other ways of experiencing timeless mind. Basically, they all involvethe same principle. You go beyond your internal dialogue and experience a silentmind, which is the same thing as a timeless mind. Next time you feel emotionalturbulence, immediately bring your attention to the sensations in your body andmake a conscious choice to stop interpreting the emotional experience. When youhave focused your attention on the bodily sensations that accompany an emotion,you have stopped all interpretation, and your mind becomes silent. You becomethe silent witness of the sensations in your body. In doing so, you not onlystop your internal dialogue, but you also begin to dissipate the energy of theemotional turbulence.Still another way of experiencing timeless mind is to become aware of the spacesbetween breaths, between the objects of perception, between movements of yourbody, and between your thoughts. If your attention is on any of these spaces andyou are not in an interpreting mode, then you go beyond your internal dialogueand enter the timeless mind. Some people are able to immediately stop theirinternal dialogue simply by silently saying to themselves “Stop!” Use whateverworks for you. The key is to have the ability to become a silent witness andexperience the Self, even during activity. It is extremely important to have theability to shift awareness from that which changes to that which does notchange. Start practicing this by shifting your awareness to the Self or observeras described above, by feeling the body without interpretation, and by becomingaware of the spaces between objects.When you can maintain this inner silence, inner centeredness, inner presence,even in the midst of outer activity, you will have a new relationship with timeand everything you experience. Cultivating ever-present witnessing awareness inthe midst of time-bound awareness will forever transform your perception oftime.Change Your Perception of Your BodyThe prevailing worldview looks at the body as a material vehicle, similar to anautomobile, in which parts inevitably break down until the body is no longerserviceable. Modern science and the wisdom traditions tell us this is a flawedinterpretation. Your body is not merely a physical device that generatesthoughts and feelings; rather, it is a network of energy, transformation, andintelligence in dynamic exchange with the world around you. With every breathyou take, every mouthful of food or swallow of water you ingest, every sound youhear, sight you see, sensation you feel, and aroma you smell your body changes.Just since you began reading this paragraph you exchanged four hundredbilliontrillion atoms with your environment!Your body looks static because the changes are taking place at a level toosubtle for you to directly perceive. Scientists can calculate the turnover ofmatter in your body by labeling atoms with radioactive material and trackingtheir metabolism. Through this process we’ve learned that the lining of yourstomach is replaced about every five days. It takes about a month for your skinto be retread. In about six weeks your liver has turned over, and within just afew months, most of the calcium and phosphorus crystals that make up yourskeleton have come and gone. Every year over 98 percent of all the atoms in thehuman body have been exchanged. After a course of three years, you would be hardpressed to find an atom that was a part of you then, which could still beconsidered yours now.To help you appreciate this idea, consider that your body is like a local branchof the public library. Although on one level the library seems to be stable, onanother level it is constantly changing. Books are coming and going every day,with completely new ones added and old ones returned to the downtown facility.Particular books do not define a library; rather, it represents the site andprocess of this ever-changing exchange of information.Your body is like a flame that is constantly metabolizing new material. Theflammable matter and the oxygen necessary for its combustion must be continuallyrenewed. The smoke and gases released are changing at every moment. And yet theflame appears to be nearly the same over time. The processes of creation,maintenance, and dissolution are simultaneously at work in a flame and in yourbody.The Greek poet Heraclitus said you cannot point to the same river twice becausenew water is always flowing. Like a river, like a library, like a flame, yourbody may appear to be the same on the surface, but in actuality, it isconstantly changing. Rather than viewing your body as a static biologicalmachine, begin to think of it as a field of energy and intelligence, constantlyrenewing itself. To grow younger you must change your perception of the body,relinquishing the idea that it is a bag of flesh and bones. Begin to experienceyour body as the flow of vital energy, transformation, and intelligence, and youwill experience the reversal of aging.Even though the body appears to be material, it is not.In the deeper reality, your body is a field of energy,transformation, and intelligence. The Body of Energy, Transformation, and IntelligenceEverything we have said to this point can be summarized in one sentence: Bycultivating the habit of thinking of your body as a field of energy,transformation, and intelligence, you will begin to experience it as a flexible,dynamic bundle of consciousness, rather than as a fixed, material thing. Youwill realize its wavelike nature instead of its particlelike nature. One way ofdoing this is through the use of daily rituals that reinforce this newinterpretation.Your body is a field of energy, at one with the energy of the cosmos,inexhaustible and constantly in motion. The Ayurvedic term for this energeticaspect of life is Prana (prä′-nä), which is sometimes translated as the breathof life. Likewise, your body is ever in transformation, always and eternally indynamic relationship with the elements and forces of the universe. This is knownin Ayurveda as Tejas (tĕ’′-jäs), the internal fire of transformation. Finally,your body is the physical manifestation of universal intelligence, which issupreme, divine, and immortal. The Ayurvedic word for this is Ojas (ō’′-jäs),the infinitely flexible, fluid expression of the physical body. To reverse theaging process, begin using the words energy, transformation,and intelligence asreinforcements to experience your body as it really is—a field of inexhaustibleenergy, in constant transformation, and as a physical expression of pureintelligence. If you prefer, you can use the Ayurvedic terms Prana, Tejas, andOjas as mantras to anchor your new interpretation. As you begin to experienceyour body in its true form, your beliefs about it will also change, and your newbeliefs will create your new biology.EXERCISE—YOUR BODY OF LIGHTLook at the picture below.image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_021_r1.jpg]Picture APicture A is the conventional view of the human body as a modern physician mightenvision it. This picture reflects how, on a subconscious level, you perceiveyour body at this moment. Although this perception is accurate at the grosslevel, it is an incomplete representation of the true nature of your body.Therefore, it is not the way you should envision your body.image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_022_r1.jpg]Picture BNow look at picture B, a good representation of how your body really is at aquantum level: a field of energy, transformation, and intelligence. This is howthe ancient Vedic seers saw it. They referred to it as the “subtle” body. Thissubtle or quantum mechanical body is inextricably woven into, and is one with,the energy and intelligence fields of the cosmos.Look once again at picture B. Now close your eyes and see if you can clearlyvisualize it. Can you? Open your eyes. Look once again. Repeat this procedure asmany times as you want, until you can see your subtle (quantum) body as clearlywith your eyes closed as with your eyes open. When you are absolutely sure thatyou can do this, close your eyes again and mentally repeat to yourself: “Energy(Prana), transformation (Tejas), intelligence (Ojas).”Whenever you consciously take a deep breath (and make it a point to do thisseveral times each day), close your eyes and mentally repeat the word Energywhile at the same time visualizing your energy or light body as represented inpicture B. Similarly, when you consciously eat food, mentally repeat the wordTransformation, visualizing the light body in transformation. Finally, everytime you take a sip of water, silently repeat the word Intelligence and envisiononce again the light body as fluid and flexible. As you repeat this ritual withbreathing, eating, and drinking, you will be starting the process ofrestructuring your perception and the experience of your body from material tosubtle.PERCEIVING YOUR LIGHT BODYEnlivening Energy (Prana)Your vital energy animates both mind and body. Throughout the day, use the wordEnergy and experience the life force rejuvenating every cell, tissue, and organin your body.Think “Energy” whenever you:Walk through a garden.Go from indoors to outdoors.Practice breathing exercises (see Chapter 7)Enlivening Transformation (Tejas)The essential transformational force is the primordial fire of life. Throughoutthe day, use the word Transformation to enliven the transformational processthat continuously converts energy from one form into another.Think “Transformation” whenever you:Take a mouthful of food.Feel the sun on your bodyGaze into the stars at night.Enlivening Intelligence (Ojas)When intelligence is abundant and freely circulating in your body, all yourphysiological systems—cardiovascular, digestive, neurological, hormonal, andimmune—function at their optimal level. Throughout the day, use the wordIntelligence to enliven nourishment in every cell of your body.Think “Intelligence” whenever you:Take a sip of water.Walk along a natural body of water.Drink fresh fruit juices or other healthy beverages.In addition to silently repeating these words to enliven energy, transformation,and intelligence while you breathe, eat, and drink, use them when you areexercising. Whenever you are performing a rhythmic activity—walking, jogging,swimming, riding your bicycle, or using a treadmill—silently repeat “Energy,Transformation, Intelligence . . . Energy, Transformation, Intelligence . . .”or “Prana, Tejas, Ojas . . . Prana, Tejas, Ojas . . .” with your full attentionon your body. After a while, your habitual way of experiencing your body willchange because your perceptions will have shifted.The Body as a River of RenewalYour body is not a mechanical structure fixed in time and space. It is a fieldof energy, information, and intelligence in dynamic exchange with yourenvironment, capable of perpetual healing, renewal, and transformation.Sitting comfortably, close your eyes and take a full deep inhalation. Now, asyou slowly exhale the air from your lungs, visualize your breath as a flow ofmolecules being released from every cell in your body. With each outgoing breathyou are releasing atoms from every organ in your body, and with each ingoingbreath you are bringing atoms to every cell and organ in your body. You arerenewing your body and replacing parts with every breath that you take.Continue to breathe in and out and imagine your body as a continual stream ofenergy and transformation, constantly renewing and refreshing itself.Bring your attention to your stomach and know that the entire stomach liningwill be renewed in less than a week. Now bring your attention to your skin andknow that within one month the cells will be entirely replaced and you will havenew skin.See your skeleton in your mind’s eye. The atoms that currently comprise it willbe replaced by new ones in three months. Bring your attention to your liver. Youwill have a new one in six weeks.Now feel your whole body. In one year almost all of it will have been replaced.Now say to yourself: “I am renewing my body with every breath I take.” See yourbody as it really is— infinitely flexible, fluid, and forever in renewal.Every day in every way, I am increasingmy mental and physical capacity.My Biostat is set at a healthy image[images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_023_r1.jpg]years of age.I look and feel a healthy image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_024_r1.jpg]yearsold.

An agitated body/mind system generates entropy, decay, and aging.A rested body/mind system fosters creativity, renewal, and reversal of aging.Since the body and mind are one, when the mind is deeply rested the body is alsodeeply rested. Of course, we know from common experience that our mind is rarelyin this rested state. In fact, most of the time it is in the fight-or-flightmode. The fight-or-flight or stress response occurs when we feel threatened inany way, including when we feel threatened by aging. The stress response createsphysiological changes that damage the body and accelerate aging. You are surelyfamiliar with how it feels to be in stress mode, but you may not be familiarwith what is happening in your body. The physiological changes that accompanythe fight-or-flight response are:Your heart beats faster.Your blood pressure rises.You consume more oxygen.You expel more carbon dioxide.You breathe faster.Your breathing becomes shallow.Your heart pumps more blood.You sweat.One part of your adrenal glands pumps out adrenaline and noradrenaline, whichconstrict blood vessels.Another part of your adrenal glands pumps out cortisol.Your pancreas releases more of the hormone glucagon.Your pancreas releases less insulin.As a result of the increased glucagon and decreased insulin, your blood sugarlevel rises.You reduce the blood supply to your digestive organs and increase the bloodsupply to your muscles.Your pituitary gland releases less growth hormone.You produce lower levels of sex hormone.Your immune system is suppressed.The fight-or-flight response was first described by early-twentieth-centuryAmerican scientist Walter Cannon. He wanted to understand why some people becameill and others even died under stress. He discovered that when you encounter athreatening situation, a part of your involuntary nervous system becomesinstantly and automatically activated. The nervous system triggers rises inblood pressure and heart rate and stimulates the adrenal glands to releaseadrenaline. If the threat and the neurological response are severe andunrelenting, damaging bodily changes can occur.Cannon researched tribal societies, where people who trespass against importantrules are banished from the community. A bone is pointed at the offender by thetribal witch doctor, resulting in a “curse.” From that point on, the offender isno longer considered to be part of the living community. He is cut off from allsocial interactions, including those with his own family. These outcasts go intosuch an intense stress response that their circulatory systems collapse. Theyliterally die from fear, often within just a few days.Exploring the stress response further, another scientist, Hans Selye, found thatin addition to the changes that take place in the nervous system, many importanthormones jump into the fray. These hormones affect every aspect of the body,including the heart, stomach, liver, sex organs, and immune system. If thestress is long and drawn out, the entire physiology becomes exhausted, the bodyis unable to maintain balance, and something eventually breaks down.Prolonged stress can make you sick and can accelerate aging. Over time, thestress response can cause high blood pressure, heart disease, stomach ulcers,autoimmune diseases, cancer, anxiety, insomnia, and depression. This may leadyou to ask, if the fight-or-flight response is so damaging, why did naturecreate it? The original purpose of the fight-or-flight response was to helpmankind survive in threatening situations. If a ferocious animal was about toeat you, the only way to survive was to either fight back or run away.Considering that human beings do not have thick hides, large canines, or bigtusks, our ability to quickly react to a threat helped us survive in a dangerousenvironment.Today, this response is still occasionally useful, as when a fireman goes into aburning building to rescue a child, or when you leap out of the way of areckless driver speeding on a residential street. Most of the time, however, thefight-or-flight response no longer serves us very well. You may activate thestress response when you are stuck in rush-hour traffic or facing a criticalwork deadline, but neither fighting nor running away is a viable option. Thepressure to do something without a way to release it causes harm. The long-termconsequences of an activated stress response speed up the aging process andmakes us susceptible to illness.The opposite of the fight-or-flight response is the restful response. There aretwo kinds of restful responses: restful awareness and restful sleep. Restfulawareness is the state when your body/mind system is in deep rest but your mindis awake. Restful sleep is the state in which your body/mind system is in deeprest and your mind is sleeping. Both of these states renew the body, althoughsome studies indicate that restful awareness may provide even deeper rest thansleep. However, for our purpose of age reversal, both experiences are equallyimportant. Restful awareness occurs during meditation. Restful sleep includesboth dream sleep and dreamless deep sleep. Your subjective experience of therestful response is relaxation. The physiological changes that occur are:Your heart rate slows.Your blood pressure normalizes.You consume less oxygen.You use oxygen more efficiently.You expel less carbon dioxide.Your breathing slows.Your heart pumps less blood.You perspire less.Your adrenal glands produce less adrenaline and noradrenaline.Your adrenal glands produce less cortisol.You make more sex hormones, particularly dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA).Your pituitary gland releases more growth hormone (an antiaging hormone).Your immune function improves.The Restful Awareness ResponseRestful awareness is a natural mind/body response, as natural as the stressresponses. The most direct way to experience restful awareness is throughmeditation. Meditation has been a part of Eastern cultures for thousands ofyears, but it is comparatively new in the West. Despite its recent arrival here,many studies have shown that anyone can easily learn to meditate and enjoy thephysiological changes of experienced meditators.The bodily changes of restful awareness in meditation are almost the exactopposite of the fight-or-flight response. During meditation, breathing slows,blood pressure decreases, and stress hormone levels fall. The consumption ofoxygen during meditation falls almost twice as much as during sleep. What isfascinating about these physiological changes is that even as the body isresting deeply in meditation, the mind is awake, though quiet. Brain wavestudies show improved coherence between different parts of the brain duringmeditation. These changes in body and mind are not seen during wakefulness orsleeping. The unique combination of physical relaxation and an alert yet quietmind explains the term restful awareness and distinguishes this state fromrestful sleep.People who regularly experience restful awareness develop less hypertension,heart disease, anxiety, and depression. They find it easier to give uplife-damaging habits such as cigarettes, excessive alcohol, and drugs. They alsoshow improvements in their immune function and reduced susceptibility toinfections. Research on people who meditate demonstrates wide-ranging healthimprovements and a reversal in many of the biomarkers of aging.Studies have shown that the longer people have been practicing meditation, theyounger they score on tests of biological age. For example, long-term meditatorsshow biological ages almost twelve years younger than their chronological age.Other studies have shown that certain hormonal changes usually associated withaging can be slowed or reversed through regular meditation. One of the mostinteresting ones found that the hormone DHEA is higher in people who meditatethan those who do not. We know that levels of DHEA steadily fall as we age. Thishas led some people to suggest that supplementing the diet with this hormone canreverse aging. We believe it is better to raise your DHEA levels throughmeditation than supplementation. There is good evidence that you can reverseyour biological age by taking time to quiet your mind and experience the restfulresponse.It should be obvious that the restful awareness response (meditation) is a veryimportant way to reverse the aging process. Although you may wonder when you’llever find the time to meditate, we strongly encourage you to make meditation animportant part of your life. It will actually create more time for you, becauseyou will be much more efficient when your mind is calm and centered. Werecommend twenty minutes of restful awareness (sitting meditation with your eyesclosed) twice a day. The best times to meditate are shortly after awakening inthe morning, and again in the later afternoon or early evening. The morningmeditation starts your day with a fresh, calm mental attitude. The lateafternoon or evening session helps freshen your mind after a day’s activity.The time you take to experience restful awareness will yield immediate rewards.You will notice relaxation during the meditation and increased energy andcreativity during your day. If you have not meditated before, start with the SoHum meditation technique. After you have practiced this procedure for a while,we recommend you learn a more specific and personalized process calledPrimordial Sound Meditation (PSM), taught by one of our certified instructors.PSM uses individualized mantras that are based on the time, date, and place ofyour birth. There are now over five hundred certified Primordial SoundMeditation teachers in the world. See the appendix for information on finding aPSM teacher in your area.So Hum MeditationSit comfortably, where you will not be disturbed, and close your eyes.Take a slow deep breath through your nose while thinking the word So.Exhale slowly through your nose while thinking the word Hum.Continue breathing easily, silently repeating, “So . . . Hum . . .” with eachinflow and outflow of your breath.Whenever your attention drifts to thoughts in your mind, sounds in yourenvironment, or sensations in your body, gently return to your breath, silentlyrepeating “So . . . Hum.”Continue this process for twenty minutes with an attitude of effortlessness andsimplicity.When the time is up, continue to sit with your eyes closed for a few moreminutes before resuming your daily activity.When practicing this technique, you will have one of several experiences.Regardless of your experience, have an attitude of “no resistance.” Relinquishyour need to control or anticipate what is occurring during the practice. Any ofthe following experiences are indications that you are meditating correctly:Your attention is on your breathing as you silently repeat the mantra “So Hum.”Your mind drifts off into a stream of thoughts. Sometimes these thoughts will bealmost dreamlike and other times you may feel that you are just thinking withyour eyes closed. In either case, when you remember that your attention hasdrifted away from your breath and the mantra, gently return to it.Occasionally at first, and more regularly after a while, you will have theexperience of a thoughtless state. Your mind is silent and your body is deeplyrelaxed. We call this “going into the gap,” or the experience of timeless mind.With regular practice, the inner silence you experience in the gap will infuseevery aspect of your life.There may be times in your meditation when you fall asleep. Because meditationis a gentle, natural process, if your body is fatigued, it will take thisopportunity to sleep. Listen to this message from your body and commit togetting the deep rest you need.One of the most common complaints of a new meditator is “I am having too manythoughts.” Thoughts are a part of meditation and you cannot force your mind tostop thinking. Just let the thoughts come and go and before long you will findyour mind quieting. When you first begin meditation, you will experiencerelaxation while sitting with your eyes closed, but may revert to your typicalstressful reactions when resuming your usual activities. Over time, more of therestful awareness gained in meditation will carry over into your life. As youface the daily challenges of being human, you’ll find it easier to maintain yourcalm center. As you learn to avoid unnecessary and overreactive stressresponses, you’ll slow the aging process.The restful alertness response reverses the aging process.Restful SleepIn addition to restful awareness, you need a minimum of six to eight hours ofrestful sleep each night. Restful sleep means that you drift off easily once youturn off the light and sleep soundly through the night. If you have to get up togo to the bathroom during the night, you are able to easily get back to sleep.You will know you have had restful sleep if upon awakening you feel energetic,alert, and vibrant. If you feel tired and unenthusiastic when you wake up in themorning, you have not had a night of restful sleep.Restful sleep provides the foundation for your mental and physical well-being.Millions of people suffer with some form of insomnia, resulting in fatigue, lackof mental alertness, and weakened physical and mental health. It alsocontributes to both minor and major injury accidents. Studies have shown that ifyou wake up at three in the morning and do not get back to sleep, your immunecells do not work as well for the next twenty-four hours. Once you have a fullnight of sound sleep, they regain their disease-fighting abilities. Like therest of you, your immune cells get tired and need their rest.It takes just a small shift in your attention and behavior to have sound,restful sleep each night. Not gaining restful sleep is usually a result of poorhabits. By changing your habits, you will avoid the entropy that comes withfatigue and enliven the creativity, vitality, and age-reversing benefits thatcome with restful sleep.PREPARING FOR RESTFUL SLEEPAfter a day of stimulating activity your body is ready for and needs deep sleep.Aim for a nightly six to eight hours of sound slumber without the aid ofmedication. Hours of sleep before midnight are generally the most rejuvenating.Therefore, if you are sleeping eight hours between ten P.M. and six A.M., youwill feel more rested than if you slept eight hours between midnight and eightA.M. To promote restful sleep, try the following routine:Evening RoutineEat a relatively light dinner. This should be no later than seven P.M. so you donot go to bed on a full stomach.Take a leisurely stroll after dinner.To the extent possible, minimize exciting, aggravating, or mentally intensiveactivities after 8:30 P.M.BedtimeAim to be in your bed with the lights out between 9:30 P.M. and 10:30 P.M. Ifyou are not used to getting to bed this early, move your bedtime up by half anhour every week until you are in bed by 10:30 P.M. For example, if you usuallywatch television until midnight, try shutting it off by 11:30 for a week. Thenaim for a half hour earlier, and finally 10:30 P.M.About an hour before bedtime, run a hot bath into which you place a few drops ofa calming aromatherapy essential oil such as lavender, sandalwood, or vanilla.You can also diffuse this scent in your bedroom.As your bath is running, perform a slow self-administered oil massage, usingsesame or almond oil (see the massage description on page 54).After your massage, soak in the warm tub for ten to fifteen minutes.While soaking, have the lights low or burn a candle, and listen to soothingmusic (see our recommendations in the appendix).After your bath, drink something warm. It can be a cup of warm milk with nutmegand honey, or some chamomile or valerian root tea. If you desire, have a smallcookie or . . .If your mind is very active, journal for a few minutes before bed, “downloading”some of your thoughts and concerns so you don’t need to ruminate about them whenyou shut your eyes.Read inspirational or spiritual literature for a few minutes before bed. Avoiddramatic novels or distressing reading material.Do not watch television or do any work in bed.Once in bed, close your eyes and simply “feel your body”—this means focus onyour body and wherever you notice tension, consciously relax that area.Then, simply watch your slow easy breathing until you fall asleep.Contingency PlanIf you still have trouble falling asleep, try putting something warm on yourbelly in the area of the solar plexus. Use a warm water bottle or heating pad tosoothe your body and calm your mind.Try silently repeating the sleeping mantra: Om Agasthi Shahina (Om Ah-gah′-steeShah-ee′-nah).Try sleeping on your stomach with your feet hanging over the edge of the bed. Oncold nights, wear socks so your toes stay warm.If you wake up during the night and have trouble getting back to sleep, tryreclining in a soft, comfortable chair with a blanket. You may find it easier todrift off in a slightly upright position.If all else fails and you continue to have disrupted sleep, try staying up allnight and avoid napping the following day. By nine P.M. the next evening, yourmind and body will be ready to sleep. This can often reset your biologicalrhythms.It is helpful to remember that if you are lying still in bed, silently repeatingthe sleeping mantra, your metabolic activity is nearly as low as if you were indeep sleep. Even if your mind is still somewhat active, your body is getting thedeep rest it needs. Therefore, do not worry if you are not immediately fallingasleep; by not worrying, you will quickly drift off into a deep slumber.Lack of restful sleep accelerates aging.Restful sleep accelerates healing,minimizes entropy, and enlivens renewal. Performing a Self-MassageA massage gives you access to your inner pharmacy. Your skin is a rich source ofage-reversing hormones that can be released through massage. A slow, calmingmassage releases natural relaxing chemicals. A brisk, invigorating massagereleases natural energizing chemicals. We recommend self-massage as a valuableage-reversing component of your daily routine. To help you sleep at night,perform your massage with gentle, soothing strokes. To help you get going in themorning, perform your massage more vigorously. If you are trying to loseunwanted pounds, you can also do this massage using a loofah, a defoliatingscrub mitt.FULL MASSAGEThis entire massage requires just a few tablespoons of warm oil. Begin bymassaging your scalp, using small circular strokes as if shampooing your hair.With gentle strokes apply the oil to your forehead, cheeks, and chin, and thenmove to your ears. Slowly massage the back of your ears and your temples—thishas a soothing effect.Massage a small amount of oil onto the front and back of your neck and then moveto your shoulders. When massaging your arms, use circular motions at theshoulders and elbows, and long back-and-forth motions on the upper arms andforearms.Using large, gentle circular motions, massage your chest, stomach, and abdomen.Use an up-and-down motion over your breastbone. Applying a bit of oil to bothhands, gently reach around to massage your back and spine as best you can.As with your arms, massage your legs with a circular motion at the ankles andknees, using a straight back-and-forth motion on the long parts. Use whateveroil remains to massage your feet, paying extra attention to your toes.MINI-MASSAGEYour head and feet are the most important parts of your body to massage inpreparation for restful sleep. Using a tablespoon of warm oil, gently rub itinto your scalp, using the small, circular motions described above. Soothinglymassage your forehead from side to side with your palm. Gently massage yourtemples, then the outside of your ears. Spend a little time massaging the backand front of your neck.With a second tablespoon of oil, slowly but firmly massage the soles of yourfeet. Work the oil around your toes with your fingertips. Sit quietly for a fewmoments to soak in the oil, and then take your warm bath.Harmonize Your Biological Rhythms with the Rhythms of NatureNature operates in seasons, cycles, and rhythms. Everything in this world movesthrough periods of activity and rest, including your physiology. Our planet hascycles of day and night, as well as seasonal cycles. When your biologicalrhythms are aligned with the rhythms of nature, your body/mind system feelsinvigorated and healthy. When your biorhythms are not aligned with naturalcycles, you generate wear and tear in your body and mind, accelerating the agingprocess.Technology that runs on electricity has been around for only a century, and yetmany people’s daily schedules revolve around late-night television shows,all-night markets, microwave ovens, and alarm clocks. Their daily routines areout of synch with nature. Just as jet lag results in mood changes, concentrationproblems, and digestive disturbances, an irregular daily routine affects yourmind and body. Depression, insomnia, anxiety, constipation, bloating, andweakened immunity are the result.You can align your biological rhythms with those of nature by paying attentionto a few basic principles. These are:Morning RoutineWake up without an alarm clock. The best way to do this is to leave your bedroomshades or curtains partially open so the morning sunlight arouses you.Empty your bladder and bowels first thing in the morning. Drinking a glass ofwarm water will help stimulate elimination.Perform your morning exercise routine (see Chapter 7).Take your shower preceded or followed by an oil massage.Meditate for twenty to thirty minutes.Eat your breakfast when you are hungry.Midday RoutineEat your lunch consciously.Eat a bigger meal at noontime compared to your dinner.Take a ten-minute walk after lunch.Early Evening RoutineMeditate for twenty to thirty minutes before you eat your dinner, and thenfollow the evening routine described earlier in this chapter.You can also benefit by aligning yourself with the seasonal cycles. As the daysbecome shorter during the late fall and winter months, make some differentchoices to balance the changes in your environment.Harmonizing your biological rhythms with the rhythmsof nature minimizes entropy and reverses aging. Winter RoutineGet to bed earlier.Increase your intake of warmer foods—soups, casseroles, hot cereals—to balancethe coldness of winter.Drink plenty of warm liquids—ginger and other herbal teas.Perform your daily oil massage, leaving a thin layer of oil on your skin toprotect against dryness.Keep your head covered when you go outside to prevent chills.If you get frequent colds during the winter season, try using a Neti pot andNasya oil to cleanse and protect your nasal passages (see description below).Using a Neti Pot and NasyaUsing a Neti pot and Nasya is a traditional method to purify and revitalize thebreathing passages. In the same way that massage nourishes and rejuvenates theskin, Neti and Nasya nourish and rejuvenate the breathing passages. This processcan reduce allergies and decrease your chances of contracting upper-respiratoryinfections. It is also useful before traveling on a plane, to keep yourbreathing passages moist.A Neti pot is a small container with a spout that can be gently placed into yournostrils through which warm salt water is administered. Usually made from aceramic material, continued a typical Neti pot holds about ⅔ of a cup of waterto which ⅛ of a teaspoon of salt is added.Place the spout of the Neti pot in one nostril and gently pour in the warm saltwater. Your head should be positioned so the water runs out the other nostril.Any remaining liquid in your nasal passages is expelled and the process isrepeated on the other side.Nasya involves the application of a few drops of oil to the nasal membranes. Theoil should be an edible grade of sesame, almond, or olive. Herbalized aromaticoils that contain small amounts of camphor, eucalyptus, and menthol can also beused. Place a drop of the oil on your pinkie finger and apply it inside yournostril. Then gently sniff it up and repeat on the other side. This can berepeated four to six times a day.image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_031_r1.jpg]Neti PotDuring the warmer summer months, you can take other steps to maintain yourbalance while paying attention to the changing signals from your environment.Summer RoutineDrink plenty of fresh water throughout the day.Eat an abundant amount of locally grown fresh fruits and juices.Generally eat lighter.Perform your exercise early in the morning before it gets too hot.Spend more time outdoors, particularly in the evening when the day cools down.You can go to bed a little later, in alignment with longer daylight hours.Dynamic activity during the day leads to restful sleep at night. Remember, youare not separate from Nature; you are a part of Nature. Tune in to the rhythmsof nature and you will reverse your biological age.Every day in every way,I am increasing my mental and physical capacity.My Biostat is set at a healthy ____ years of age.I look and feel a healthy ____ years old. I am reversing my biological age:By changing my perception of my body, its aging and time; andThrough two kinds of deep rest—restful awareness and restful sleep.image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_032_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_033_r1.jpg]4image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_034_r1.jpg]You Can Reverse YourBiological Age by LovinglyNurturing Your Body ThroughHealthy Food ACTION STEP # 3I am reversing my biological age by lovingly nurturing my body through healthyfood.I put this into practice by:Enjoying the six tastes.Eating consciously.Honoring the signals of hunger and satiety in my body.image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_035_r1.jpg]Food can heal and renew.Food can be your antiaging medicine. image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_036_r1.jpg]image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_037_r1.jpg]Nurturing your body through healthy food is the third step to reverse the agingprocess. Next to breathing, eating is the most natural thing in the world, andyet many people are confused about their nutrition. Should you be eating moreprotein or more complex carbohydrates? Is dairy good or bad for you? Should yoube eating your vegetables raw, or are they better for you cooked? Consideringhow much conflicting information is around, it is not surprising if you areperplexed about the best diet.When it comes to aging, there is a steady flow of new nutritional programspromoting their advantages over others, but there is honestly little evidence tosuggest that one approach is clearly more beneficial than another. We do know,based on reliable research, that if you eat an abundance of fresh vegetables,fruits, and whole grains, while reducing your intake of animal fat, you willincrease your chances of living healthier and longer. The key to a diet thatwill reverse the aging process is to eat foods that are both very healthy andvery delicious. A successful program must also be flexible, for any diet that isdifficult to follow will not be practical and you will not stick with it forlong. The nutritional program we present here has these essential components: itis nutritionally balanced, it is sumptuous, and it is easy to follow whether youare cooking for yourself or regularly eating at restaurants.Your body is a field of energy, transformation, and intelligence made out of thefood you eat. A sugar molecule in the apple you ate at lunch yesterday may be apart of your stomach lining today. An amino acid from the side order of cottagecheese you ate may now be in a fiber in your bicep muscle. An iron molecule fromyour spinach salad may already be part of the hemoglobin in one of your redblood cells. You become what you eat.One of four things happens to every molecule you ingest: (1) it is transformedinto a structural part of your body; (2) it is used for energy; (3) it is storedfor possible future use; or (4) it is eliminated. If you are building a newhouse, you want the best lumber. If you are building a new body, you want thebest food. Eating to reverse aging is not difficult. It just requires enoughattention and intention to ensure that you are receiving the highest qualitysources of energy and intelligence to create a healthy body.You become what you eat.Making Sense of TasteWe encourage you to follow a nutritional program that is expansive, notrestrictive. We are aware of the many dietary plans that tell you to avoidcertain types of food. The most common restriction diets we hear about at theChopra Center include avoiding dairy, avoiding wheat, and avoiding all sugars.Other programs recommend the elimination of nightshade vegetables or any foodthat is acidic.If you know for certain that you have problems with a specific food, listen toyour body. If, however, you have eliminated certain foods only because you weretold or read they were harmful, you may want to gently reintroduce them as partof a balanced diet and see for yourself if they are good or bad for you.Listening to your body is the best way to assess the suitability of any food.According to Ayurveda, all foods can be categorized into one or more of sixbasic tastes. These six flavors are:SweetSourSaltyPungentBitterAstringent The first basic principle of an age-reversing diet is to ensure that throughoutthe day you consume foods from all six taste groups. These are the tastes thatnature has created to provide the basic building blocks you need to nourish yourbody. The energy and intelligence of the natural world is packaged for yourconsumption in these six tastes. Let’s look at each taste group in more detail.SWEETFoods that provide the sweet taste are rich in carbohydrates, proteins, andfats. Grains, cereals, breads, pastas, nuts, milk, dairy, fish, fowl, red meat,and oils are all classified as sweet foods. Sweet fruits include bananas,cherries, papayas, mangoes, peaches, pears, and raisins. Examples of sweetvegetables, which contain a predominance of complex carbohydrates, areartichokes, asparagus, carrots, cauliflower, okra, squash, and sweet potatoes.All food from animal sources is considered sweet. If you examine your grocerycart at the checkout counter, you’ll recognize that you consume a greater volumeof foods in this category of flavors than any other.Since the sweet category covers a wide range of potentially edible substancesfrom candy to quinoa, it is important to consume sweet foods that are balancingand nutritious. In general this means:Favor foods rich in complex carbohydrates, particularly whole grains, breads,cereals, rice, and pasta. Aim for eight helpings a day. A piece of rye toast,half a cup of pasta, one whole wheat tortilla, half a bagel, half a cup of rice,and a small potato are examples of one complex carbohydrate serving.Consume at least three to five servings of fresh fruit each day. One peach, onepear, one banana, half a cup of cherries, and half a cantaloupe are examples ofone fruit serving.Consume at least five servings of vegetables each day. A half-cup of most cookedvegetables and a cup of most greens constitute one vegetable serving. Choosefrom a wide variety of green and yellow vegetables.Choose more vegetable sources of protein, including beans, legumes, seeds, andnuts. Although nuts are high in fat, most of it is polyunsaturated ormonosaturated, which is better for you. Nuts contain many beneficialphytochemicals and have been shown to lower cholesterol levels.Favor nonfat and low-fat milk and dairy products.If you eat meat, minimize your intake of red meat, substituting cold-waterfishes and lean fowl.There is considerable controversy these days regarding the ideal balance ofcarbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Advocates of very low-fat diets refer tostudies showing that coronary heart disease can be reversed and cancer can beprevented by lowering the intake of saturated fat. Low-carbohydrate advocatessuggest that there is an unprecedented abundance of sugars in the modern Westerndiet, resulting in abnormally high insulin levels, contributing to obesity anddiabetes. Although there is validity to the basic premise of both extremes, wetake the position that a balanced diet is the most healthful, most likely toresult in sustained ideal body weight, and the only one that can be followed fora lifetime. With this in mind, our recommendation is to have a good mix ofcarbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Although the reversal of aging program doesnot require or encourage calorie counting, following our recommendations willresult in a diet that is approximately 60 to 68 percent carbohydrates, 15 to 20percent proteins, and 20 to 25 percent fats. (If you want to calculate yourtargeted intake of sweet food sources, see the box on page 68.)Favor complex carbohydrates, vegetable and marine sources of protein, andvegetable and fish sources of fat and oils. Your cooking oils should be eithermonounsaturated, such as olive oil, or polyunsaturated, such as canola,safflower, or sunflower. A small amount of clarified butter (under onetablespoon per day) adds flavor with an acceptable dose of cholesterol. Inaddition to reducing your intake of saturated fats, this plan naturallyincreases your consumption of fiber-rich foods, which are helpful in normalizingelimination, lowering cholesterol levels, and reducing the risk of digestivetract cancers.There are foods that accelerate aging and entropy,and others that renew and revitalize the body. Eating to Grow YoungerUse a calculator to compute your targets.Calculate your daily calories by multiplying your weight in pounds by 16.image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_038_r1.jpg]Example: If you weigh 150 pounds, your numbers would look as follows:image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_039_r1.jpg]This plan results in the following calorie breakdown:image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_040_r1.jpg]SOURThe sour taste results from the chemical action of organic acids on the tastebuds. All acids are perceived as sour including citric acid, ascorbic acid(vitamin C), and acetic acid (vinegar). A regular dose of sour awakens yourappetite and enhances your digestion. It also slows the emptying of yourstomach, reducing the insulin-stimulating effect of carbohydrates. Althoughfoods ranging from cheddar cheese to vinegar carry the sour taste, the bestsources are fresh fruits including apples, apricots, berries, cherries,grapefruit, grapes, lemons, oranges, pineapples, and tomatoes. Low- and nonfatyogurt is also a good source of the sour taste. Fresh yogurt providesacidophilus bacteria, which are helpful in balancing your digestive tract.Sour foods are usually excellent sources of vitamin C and flavonoids, whichprotect against heart disease and cancer. They also provide soluble fiber, whichmay reduce the chances of both coronary heart disease and diabetes. Manyfermented condiments, such as pickles, green olives, and chutneys also carry thesour taste. Although they are helpful in stimulating digestion, they are besttaken in small amounts. Get the bulk of your servings of sour through abundanthelpings of tart fruits with less from salad dressings and pickled and fermentedfoods.SALTYMineral salts are an essential component of health, but a typical Western dietis much more likely to have too much rather than too little salt. The saltytaste promotes digestion, is mildly laxative, and has a mildly relaxing effect.Too much salt is associated with an increased risk for high blood pressure andmay play a minor role in the development of osteoporosis.In addition to common table salt, the salty taste is carried in fish, soy sauce,tamari, seaweed products, and most sauces. Be aware of your salt intake,recognizing that it is an essential taste but one that must be taken inmoderation.PUNGENTThe pungent or spicy taste is usually referred to as “hot.” Most culturesrecognize the value of the spicy taste, although Americans tend to be shy aboutit. The pungent spices have always been sought and valued. One of the majormotivations for the journey of Christopher Columbus was to discover a shortcutto the exotic spices of India, which were prized by western Europeans.The spicy flavor usually results from essential oils that are rich inantioxidant properties. Their ability to neutralize decay-causing free radicalsmay explain why pungent spices were commonly used to preserve food. The naturalchemicals in hot spices are also antibacterial.Modern scientific research has shown that natural compounds contained withinspicy food sources such as onions, leeks, chives, and garlic may help lower yourcholesterol level and blood pressure. Other studies have found that thesepungent foods can protect you from cancer-causing agents in the environment.Chilis, ginger, horseradish, mustard, black and red pepper, radishes, and manyculinary spices including basil, cinnamon, cloves, cumin, oregano, peppermint,rosemary, and thyme all carry the pungent taste. Use them liberally in your dietfor both their flavor and the age-reversing benefits they bring to your health.BITTERGreen and yellow vegetables are the primary source of the bitter taste. Commonexamples include bell peppers, broccoli, celery, chard, eggplant, endive,spinach, and zucchini. Most green leafy vegetables range from mildly to verybitter. Bitterness reflects the many natural chemicals contained in vegetablesthat have a wide range of age-reversing and health-enhancing effects. Thesephytochemicals ( phyto is Greek for plant) help detoxify carcinogens, lowerserum cholesterol levels, and enhance your immunity.All vegetables carry essential vitamins and minerals. Green vegetables are goodsources of B vitamins and folate, now known to play an important role inprotecting against heart disease. Vegetables are an important source of bothsoluble and insoluble fiber. The soluble fiber is good for your heart and theinsoluble fiber improves the movement of food through your digestive tract.High-fiber diets are associated with a lower risk for breast and digestive tractcancers.The American Cancer Society recommends a minimum of five helpings of fruits andvegetable each day, but some studies have shown that less than 10 percent ofAmericans regularly follow this advice. We echo what mothers have been sayingsince the dawn of humanity: eat your vegetables.Many herbs also carry the bitter taste and are important components of ahealthy, balanced diet. Chamomile, cilantro, coriander, cumin, dill, fenugreek,licorice, rhubarb, rosemary, saffron, sage, tarragon, and turmeric are examplesof culinary herbs and spices that contain the bitter flavor. Most medicinalherbs such as echinacea, aloe, black cohosh, gentian, goldenseal, licorice,passion-flower, skullcap, and Saint-John’s-wort are predominantly bitter due totheir high concentrations of phytochemicals. Most people are not naturallyattracted to the bitter taste, but small quantities enhance the taste of foodand contribute to your well-being.Below is a chart that highlights a few of the amazing health-enhancing,age-reversing chemicals that fruits and vegetables provide.image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_041_r1.jpg]ASTRINGENTAstringent foods produce a puckering effect on our mucous membranes. Althoughmodern science does not classify the astringent property as an actual taste, thenatural chemicals that produce astringency have many health-enhancing effects.Examples of foods that carry the astringent taste include apples, artichokes,asparagus, beans, bell peppers, buttermilk, celery, cherries, cranberries,cucumbers, figs, lemons, lentils, mung beans, mushrooms, pomegranates, potatoes,soybeans, spinach, green and black tea, tofu, whole wheat and rye grainproducts. Foods with the astringent taste have a compacting effect on yourphysiology and are important in the regulation of digestive function and woundhealing.Recent studies have found that the phytochemicals contained in both green andblack tea, good sources of the astringent taste, may help protect you against avariety of illnesses, from cancer to heart disease. Beans, legumes, and peas areexcellent sources of complex carbohydrates. They provide good-quality vegetableprotein along with both soluble and insoluble fiber. Beans and legumes alsosupply us with folic acid, calcium, and magnesium.One of the major shifts in diet between the beginning of the twentieth andtwenty-first centuries was a reduction in vegetable sources of protein andreplacement by animal ones. With this change has come an increased risk for bothheart disease and cancer. Add one or two servings of beans, peas, or lentils toyour diet each day and you will grow younger and live longer.Summary of the Six Tastesimage [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_042_r1.jpg]image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_043_r1.jpg]The body is satisfied when it has access to thesix tastes of life. Delicious and NutritiousIt is easy to follow a dietary plan that conforms to the six tastes program.Regardless of the type of food you enjoy eating, you can both enhance itssumptuousness and health-promoting qualities by ensuring that your meals have awide variety of tastes. Here are examples of meals representing a wide range ofethnic cuisine to demonstrate the practicality of this approach.SEVEN VEGETARIAN MEALS REPRESENTING THEWORLD’S REGIONAL CUISINES See the full recipes at the end of the book.THAI CUISINEClear Broth Soup with Coconut, Tofu, and GreensYellow Thai Curry with Carrots and GreensFresh Cucumber with Basil and MintBasmati Rice with MangoesBanana Coconut Stew CHINESEVegetable Hot and Sour SoupBuddha’s FeastMarinated Sesame Tofu StripsSimple Steamed RiceAlmond Cookies ITALIANWhite Bean and Vegetable SoupSpinach and Eggplant Layered Pasta with PestoGarbanzo and Green Bean StewRoasted Carrots with Fresh RosemaryRaspberry Tofu Sorbet MEXICANTortilla Soup with Avocado and CilantroBlack Bean and Sweet Potato EnchiladasSpanish RiceMango and Tomato SalsaBaked Vanilla Flan with Maple Syrup FRENCHCreamy Asparagus SoupSpinach, Leek, and Potato TartBraised Green Beans AmandineSwiss Chard and Arugula with Lemon Tarragon DressingPoached Pears with Blackberries AMERICAN BISTROCarrot Coriander SoupRoasted Vegetable Barley RisottoCranberry and Sweet Potato ChutneyOrganic Field Greens with Apple VinaigretteCocoa Tofu Mousse with Almond Praline MIDDLE EASTERNSpinach and Lentil SoupHummusQuinoa TabouliCreamy Tofu Cucumber and Mint RaitaRatatouille StewMaple Walnut Filo Triangles Optimizing DigestionWe build our bodies from the food we eat, so it is important that we receive thefull range of nutrients required to sustain our best health. According toAyurveda, it is equally important that we have ideal digestive power if we areto make the best use of the food we ingest. The Sanskrit word for digestivepower is Agni. The English word ignite is derived from Agni. Agni can be thoughtof as the transformational principle of the body. To ensure optimal digestion,we recommend you pay attention to a few simple principles that apply to how weeat. We call these the Eating Awareness Techniques (EATs).EATING AWARENESS TECHNIQUESListen to Your AppetiteYour body sends messages to your mind to meet its needs. One of the mostimportant signals the body sends is that of hunger. Although many people whohave struggled to keep excessive pounds off view their appetite as an adversary,listening to and honoring its message is one of the most important aspects of ahealthy nutritional plan. The rule is simple: Eat when you are hungry and stopwhen you are satisfied. If you think of your appetite as a gauge ranging fromempty (0) to full (10), our recommendation is to eat when you are really hungry(at a level 2 to 3) and stop when you are comfortably full but not stuffed (6 to7). By not filling your stomach to capacity, you allow your digestive power towork at an optimal level. Just as your clothes do not get fully clean if youoverstuff your washing machine, your food will not be fully digested if youoverstuff your stomach.Many people eat because it is time to eat, not because their bodies are askingfor food. You wouldn’t fill up your gas tank if it was still half full, yet manypeople eat even when they are still full from the previous meal. Start listeningto your body. Its wisdom mirrors the wisdom of the cosmos.Pay AttentionIt is easy to overeat if your environment distracts you while you are eating.Although many of us were conditioned to eat while watching television, it iseasy to lose awareness of your body and overeat when an engaging drama orexciting adventure story captures your attention. Similarly, eating whileworking on an intense project or business transaction will often result inmissing the signals that your body has had enough food. Have the intention toprotect your mealtimes so you can enjoy your food in a relaxing environment. Ifyou suffer with digestive imbalances such as heartburn or irritable bowelsyndrome, creating a calm, comfortable mealtime will improve your digestion.Favor Fresh FoodsThere are foods that accelerate aging and entropy and others that renew andrevitalize the body. Generally, “dead” foods contribute to degeneration anddecay, while fresh foods enhance regeneration and vitality. For most foods, theless time between harvesting and consumption, the more energy and intelligenceit provides. This means minimizing canned, frozen, and packaged foods towhatever extent possible. We also discourage eating leftovers or microwavedmeals.Use Food to Feed Your Body, Not Your EmotionsFrom the day we are born, we associate food with safety and comfort. The breastor bottle offered us when we were uncomfortable soothed both our physical andemotional distress. It is natural then that, as adults, we resort to food whenwe are feeling stressed or anxious. Unfortunately, if you are trying to fillyour need for love with food, you are unlikely to be very successful, and theunnecessary calories will be stored as fat. Use food to satisfy the energy needsof your body and develop nourishing relationships to satisfy the needs of youremotional heart. Both will thank you for being aware of the difference.Eat More at Lunch, Less at DinnerYour digestive power is strongest at noontime. You secrete stomach acid, bilesalts, and pancreatic enzymes in cycles throughout the day that support theabsorption and metabolism of essential nutrients from the food you consume.Until the industrial revolution, most people ate their main meal in the middleof the day with a lighter meal in the evening. Respecting this time-honoredpattern can improve digestive function and enhance sleep. Try eating a largerlunch and a smaller dinner and see if you notice an improvement in your vitalityand well-being.Kindle and Balance Your Digestive FireAyurveda compares your digestive processes to a fire in a fire-place. To havethe best possible heat and light, the fire needs to be kindled and stoked. Thesame can be said for your digestive fire. We recommend kindling your digestivefire before each meal with an herbal aperitif. This simple recipe helps awakenthe first stage of digestion, ensuring a good start to metabolizing your food.Try taking a shot glass full prior to each meal and you will notice a healthyboost to your digestive functionHerbal AperitifMix equal parts of lemon juice, gingerroot juice, water, and honey.Add a pinch of black pepper.Take a two-ounce shot of this herbal elixir right before your meal.After each meal, we recommend a spice blend to help balance your digestive fire.This is easily prepared by mixing equal parts of roasted fennel seeds, cardamomseeds, cumin seeds, and a pinch of maple sugar. Chew on one-half teaspoon ofthis spice blend at the end of each meal to enhance your digestion.In addition to the herbal aperitif before and the spice blend after each meal,try sipping on gingerroot tea throughout the day. Grate one-half teaspoon offresh gingerroot per pint of hot water and try to consume two to three pints perday. Ginger has a general toning effect on the alimentary tract, enhancingdigestion, absorption, and elimination. Ginger is known in Ayurveda as theuniversal medicine. If you have a tendency toward heartburn or indigestion, useginger cautiously at first to ensure that your symptoms do not worsen.How you eat is as important as what you eat.Keep It SimpleDon’t make nutrition complicated. It is not difficult to eat in a way that isnourishing and delicious. We can reduce this entire chapter into five simpleprinciples:Eat when you are hungry; stop when you are satiated.Chew your food until it is liquid or semi-liquid before swallowing.Don’t put the next bite of food into your mouth until you’ve swallowed theprevious one.Don’t put the next meal in your stomach until you’ve digested the previous one(usually at least three hours).Eat food with all six tastes during the day.Eating as CelebrationIt is easy to become confused when considering the best diet to help you live along and healthy life. There is a tremendous amount of conflicting informationon nutrition with experts advocating a wide variety of approaches. Althoughevery dietary program offers some nuggets of wisdom, for any approach to betruly successful, it has to be sustainable, delicious, balanced, and practical.Try following our nutritional recommendations for a month and observe theinfusion of vitality into your body and mind. This program will help you growyounger and live longer.Every day in every way,I am increasing my mental and physical capacity.My Biostat is set at a healthy ____ years of age.I look and feel a healthy ____ years old.

Eating healthy is still more important than taking concentratednutrients, which is why we like to call them complements rather thansupplements. We use the term to remind you that these nutritional allies are notsubstitutes for good food; they take nutrition to a higher level. Because we nowknow that high levels of certain nutrients can lower your risk for many commonhealth concerns associated with aging, nutritional complements play an importanthealth-promoting role.Your body is a field of energy, transformation, and intelligence. It isamazingly adept at acquiring, transforming, storing, and releasing energy. Theprimary sources of this energy are the carbohydrates, proteins, and fatscontained in food. Food also provides natural chemicals—vitamins, minerals, andtrace elements—that we require to use the energy available in food efficiently.Other nutritional components, such as antioxidant chemicals, are essential forprotecting the cells and tissues from harmful inner or outer environmentaltoxins. Finally, as we discussed last chapter, many plant-based food sourcescontain phytochemicals, essential plant-derived substances that help protect usfrom a wide variety of illnesses.People who receive adequate “doses” of essential nutrients through the food theyeat generally live healthier, longer lives than those whose diet isnutritionally lacking. It is, however, becoming increasingly clear that somenutrients have additional benefits when available in quantities higher thanthose usually provided through diet. We have come to believe that complementinga well-balanced diet with supplemental nutrients can offer the best opportunityfor maintaining and enhancing youthful vitality. Let’s review the basics ofnutritional supplementation.Vitamins—The Vital NutrientsVitamins are organic substances required in tiny amounts to maintain health.Since they cannot be manufactured in the body, they must be ingested fromoutside sources. Government-sponsored nutritional panels have developedguidelines for thirteen vitamins and fifteen minerals. Many of the RecommendedDaily Allowances (RDAs) are based upon levels that prevent a knownvitamin-deficiency disease, even though several essential nutrients havehealth-promoting effects at levels considerably higher than currentlyrecommended. Although there is a constant stream of new data on the appropriaterole for nutritional supplements, we feel there is enough reliable informationto offer practical, balanced suggestions. Our “bottom line” recommendations fornutritional supplementation are provided at the end of this chapter.Water-Soluble VitaminsWater-soluble vitamins include the B vitamins and vitamin C. They are stored inonly limited amounts in bodily tissues, and therefore they need to be consumedon a daily basis. The B vitamins work with enzyme systems to metabolize food andform essential biochemicals. Each of the water-soluble vitamins, its importantpurpose, the symptomsimage [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_050_r1.jpg]and signs of its deficiency, food sources, and the RDA is listed in the table onpage 87.Fat-Soluble VitaminsThe fat-soluble vitamins include A, D, E, K, and beta-carotene. They are storedin the liver and, as they are excreted slowly from the body, can accumulate totoxic levels. In appropriate doses the various fat-soluble vitamins areessential for maintaining immunity, bone strength, and blood clotting. Thefunctions, deficiency consequences, common sources, and RDAs are listed on page89.Nutrients as MedicinesNobody dies of old age; we die of the illnesses that are common in our olderyears. Although modern medicine is continually developing new approaches totreat the diseases that create suffering and shorten life, there is increasingevidence that nutritional approaches can help reduce our risk and lessen thedisability caused by the common afflictions of humanity. In this section we willexplore five prevalent conditions in which nutritional approaches may behelpful: heart disease, cancer, memory loss, arthritis, and immune weakness.NOURISHING YOUR HEARTHeart disease is the number-one cause of death and serious illness in oursociety. By now you must be aware that smoking, high blood pressure, an elevatedserum cholesterol level, and lack of physical exercise all contribute to therisk for cardiovascular illness. Mental attitude in the form of hostility alsoplays a role in increasing your susceptibility to heart blockages. We’ll addressother lifestyle issues throughout this book, but let’s focus here on the role ofnutritional complements.image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_051_r1.jpg]Antioxidant Vitamins and Heart DiseaseStudies have shown that oxidized forms of cholesterol are more likely to bedeposited into blood vessels, eventually resulting in blockage. Antioxidantvitamins can reduce the formation of “bad” cholesterol and may lower the risk ofheart attacks. The roles of the three major antioxidant vitamins have beenstudied, with vitamin E showing the most benefit, vitamin C showing littlebenefit, and the carotenoids falling somewhere in between.Studies on vitamin E over the past thirty years have generally confirmed itsbenefit in lowering the risk of heart attacks in daily doses ranging from 100 to800 IU. In one of the largest studies, men taking 400 or 800 IU of vitamin E foran average of one and a half years showed a 47 percent reduction in heartattacks in both dosing groups. Most other studies involving both men and womenhave supported the benefits of vitamin E in reducing heart disease.Although studies have suggested that diets naturally rich in beta-caroteneprovide some protection against heart disease, no study to date has convincinglyshown that carotenoid supplementation provides definite benefit. In fact, in onelarge trial, smokers given beta-carotene and vitamin A supplementation actuallyshowed an increase in lung cancer deaths and a slight increase in deaths fromheart attacks. Although there continues to be a lot of debate about the meaningof this report, the bottom line regarding the carotenoids and heart disease isto eat your carrots, and not overdo supplementation.Although vitamin C is clearly important in maintaining healthy blood vessels,studies have not consistently shown a benefit for supplemental C in reducing therisk of heart disease. As with the carotenoids, people following diets rich innatural sources of vitamin C have less heart disease than those whose diets areless abundant in fresh fruits and vegetables. We can guess that people whosediets are naturally plentiful in vitamin C may also be following generallyhealthy lifestyles, which cannot be replaced by vitamin supplementation alone.A naturally occurring antioxidant that has been receiving increasing attentionis coenzyme Q10 or CoQ10. It is also known as ubiquione, reflecting itsubiquitous presence in living systems. Studies have shown that it enhances thefunction of heart muscles and may be helpful for people with coronary arterydisease, high blood pressure, and congestive heart failure. Although we do notyet know enough about this substance to recommend it for universal use, we dobelieve it is worth discussing with your health care adviser if you are facingheart disease.Homocysteine and HealthOne of the most important recent discoveries in nutritional science is therecognition that an elevated blood level of the amino acid homocysteine isassociated with a number of different illnesses. Homocysteine is a biochemicalproduced during the metabolism of protein, particularly when the protein isderived from animal sources. Higher blood levels of homocysteine (greater than12 micro-moles per liter) have been identified as an independent risk factor forheart disease. Research suggests that high concentrations of this amino acidalter the lining of blood vessels. This leads to the deposit of cholesterol intoarteries, eventually resulting in blockage of the vessel and damage to the heartmuscle. A number of unhealthy lifestyle choices have been associated withelevated homocysteine levels, including smoking, excessive alcohol use, and highcaffeine intake. Recent studies have linked homocysteine to many other diseases,so that we now know that elevated blood levels of this toxic amino acid mayincrease the risk for stroke, Alzheimer’s disease, and a variety of cancers.The good news is that it is usually easy to lower your blood level ofhomocysteine by ensuring that you have an adequate intake of a few key Bvitamins. The most important one seems to be folic acid, which along withvitamins B6 (pyridoxine) and B12, metabolize homocysteine to a nontoxicbiochemical. Recent research has found that if people who require angioplasty toopen up blocked heart vessels take folic acid, B6, and B12, they showsubstantial reductions in their homocysteine levels, and their blood vessels donot become clogged as quickly.We believe there is enough evidence to support the recommendation that everyoneshould ingest ample amounts of these vital nutrients every day. How much isenough? The standard recommended allowance is 400 micrograms of folic acid, 2milligrams of vitamin B6, and 2 to 6 micrograms of vitamin B12. These levels canbe achieved with a healthy, balanced diet. Foods rich in folic acid includecereals, fruits, green leafy vegetables, beans, and whole grains. Vitamin B6 isfound in fortified grains, bran, nuts, bananas, and other noncitrus fruits, aswell as in certain vegetables such as asparagus, cabbage, and artichokes. Thereare no pure vegetarian sources of vitamin B12, which is present in eggs, dairy,fish, poultry, and red meat.In a study that showed these vitamins could slow down coronary artery disease,people were given 1,000 micrograms of folic acid, 10 milligrams of vitamin B6,and 400 micrograms of vitamin B12. These doses are substantially higher than thecurrent recommended daily intakes (RDI) established by the National Academy ofSciences. High-potency multivitamins usually contain between 100 percent and 500percent of the RDI for each nutrient, which still provide less than the highintake of folic acid and B12 tested in the study. Considering all the currentlyavailable evidence, we recommend following the balanced six-taste diet describedin chapter 4 and supplementing it with a high-potency multivitamin having aminimum of 400 micrograms of folic acid, 10 milligrams of vitamin B6, and 30micrograms of vitamin B12. The combination of a healthy, vitamin-rich diet witha good safety net of nutritional complements will provide an additional level ofprotection against a variety of serious health-damaging conditions associatedwith homocysteine.KEEPING AWAY CANCERDespite modern advances in the understanding, diagnosis, and treatment ofcancer, this dreaded illness remains the second leading cause of death in oursociety. There are few more critical situations in life in which prevention canreap such great rewards. Although there is much about cancer we do not know,there is good information that diets rich in antioxidant nutrients have aprotective effect against the inner and outer toxins that can trigger malignantcellular transformations. It is less clear that nutritional supplementationprovides additional benefit. The following is our current position on the roleof nutrients in cancer.Vitamin A, Carotenoids, and CancerAlthough one might expect that people at high risk for cancer givenbeta-carotene would fare better, three different studies thus far have not beenable to show a benefit. In both men and women smokers and in men exposed toasbestos, beta-carotene provided no protection against lung cancer, and twostudies actually showed a higher risk among people taking carotenoids.Laboratory studies have shown that vitamin A and various carotenoids may slowthe growth of prostate, cervical, oral, and skin cancers, but studiesdocumenting the clinical benefits of supplementation have not been convincing.One of the more interesting carotenoids is lycopene, found in highestconcentrations in tomatoes. This potent antioxidant seems to confer protectionagainst prostate cancer, providing a good incentive to get your helping oftomatoes on a regular basis. Our bottom line is to eat a diet that is naturallyrich in carotenoids, using supplements judiciously to ensure a healthy baselineintake.Vitamin E and CancerFor many years, laboratory studies of animals have shown that vitamin E canreduce the incidence of various cancers, and have suggested it may be of benefitto people as well. A large study from China found that people taking dailysupplemental doses of beta-carotene, vitamin E, and selenium had significantlylower rates of cancer compared to those on other nutritional regimens. Otherreports have supported the view that vitamin E may protect against oral, throat,and prostate cancer. Getting a good daily helping of this powerful antioxidantis essential to maintain youthful well-being.Vitamin C and CancerAs is true with the other antioxidant vitamins, the evidence for vitamin C as aprotector against cancer is greater in laboratory investigations than it is inclinical studies. There are suggestions that vitamin C can lower the risk ofcancers of the female reproductive system, throat, digestive tract, andrespiratory system, but whether these lab findings are relevant to peopleremains to be proven. Because it is generally well tolerated, even inexceptionally high doses, many nutritionists are advocating a higher recommendeddaily allowance than the 60 milligrams currently suggested.NUTRIENTS AND MEMORYWe all consider clear thinking and a good memory essential for health andwell-being. Good nutrition is an important aspect of mental clarity and a fewnutritional supplements have been shown to be of benefit. Studies on vitamin Ein both animals and humans have suggested that its antioxidant propertiesprotect brain cells from toxic memory-damaging forces. A large study of olderpeople showed a correlation between low vitamin E levels and problems withmemory. People with Alzheimer’s disease given vitamin E experience lessdeterioration. We are by and large convinced that getting your daily helping ofvitamin E can help maintain mental sharpness.The herb ginkgo biloba has been receiving increasing attention as amemory-enhancing agent. Derived from the oldest tree on earth, ginkgo canenhance mental performance in people with and without memory concerns. Astandardized extract is now widely available and can be a helpful ally inkeeping you on top of your mental game. The usual daily dose of ginkgo isbetween 120 and 240 milligrams per day. Because of rare reports of bleedingcomplications, ginkgo should not be mixed with blood thinning medications.The brain chemical acetylcholine seems to play a particularly important role inmemory, as it is involved in the storage, recall, and communication ofinformation. For many years, scientists have attempted to enhance the functionof acetylcholine using both synthetic and natural substances with modestresults. The use of a soy-derived compound called phosphatidylserine (PS) mayenhance the production of acetylcholine and has been shown to have a mildmemory-enhancing effect. All commercially available phosphatidylserine isderived from soy. Studies showing a benefit for PS in enhancing memory have usedabout 300 milligrams per day. This substance is now available from a number ofnutritional supplement companies.Another nutritional supplement that may increase your levels of acetylcholine isacetyl-L-carnitine (ALC). This natural substance is important for the productionof energy in muscle cells and seems to play a special role in brain cells. ALChas been researched in patients with Alzheimer’s disease and was found to slowthe progression of memory loss, particularly in younger patients. It has alsobeen shown to improve memory decline in elderly subjects without definitedementia. In addition to helping with attention and certain learning skills, ALChas been reported helpful in reducing symptoms of depression.In addition to the influence of carnitine on the mind and emotions, studies havesuggested that it may enhance heart and nerve function in people with diabetes.Both L-carnitine and acetyl-L-CARNITINE are now available from a number ofnutritional supplement companies, usually in the form of capsules containing 250milligrams. Very few side effects other than digestive upset have beenattributed to these substances. Studies on ALC in patients with Alzheimer’sdisease have used doses of 1 to 3 grams per day, and it may take months beforeany benefits are recognized. If you or a loved one are experiencing progressivememory loss, ALC may be worth a try, but otherwise, we do not believe you shouldroutinely supplement your diet with an extra helping of carnitine.HEALTHY JOINT NUTRITIONThe vitality of youth implies the ability to move without discomfort. Joint painand arthritis can interfere with your quality of life and make you feel olderthan you are. There is increasing information that nutritional approaches canenhance joint health and reduce the discomfort and disability of jointinflammation and degeneration. Vitamins A, C, D, and E all play important rolesin protecting our joints from the wear and tear of movement. A recent study fromthe Arthritis Center at Boston University found that a higher intake of vitaminC, and to a lesser extent vitamin E and beta-carotene, was associated with lessdegenerative arthritis and pain. Other reports have suggested that theantioxidant properties of vitamin E can help to calm the inflammation ofrheumatoid arthritis. The B vitamin niacinamide may also help to dampen theproduction of inflammatory chemicals shown to contribute to joint problems.Fatty Acids and the Chemistry of InflammationYour blood is a rich soup of biochemicals that is affected by the nutrients youconsume. Chemicals known as cytokines are important in the regulation ofinflammation and can be influenced by the types of fats and oils you ingest.Although the process is a complex one, there is increasing evidence thatconsuming more foods with omega-3 fatty acids may provide a variety of healthbenefits, from reducing the symptoms of arthritis to protecting against heartdisease.Fatty acids are molecules important in many essential physiological functionsincluding inflammation and tissue repair. There are two main families of fattyacids, known as omega-6 and omega-3. Most of the fats and oils consumed in atypical American diet are rich in omega-6 fatty acids and poor in omega-3 fattyacids. Most animal products, as well as commonly used cooking oils such assunflower, safflower, and corn oils, provide abundant sources of omega-6 fattyacids. Certain types of fish and flaxseed are rich in omega-3 fatty acids. Bothomega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids are required for good health, but the averageAmerican diet is imbalanced.Diets that include fish or fish oil supplements lead to lower levels ofinflammatory chemicals and have been shown to reduce the activity of arthritisas well as other autoimmune conditions. Not all fish are equally endowed withthe two most important and beneficial omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid(EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Salmon, tuna, lake trout, and anchovy arerich in EPA and DHA; halibut, shark, and bass have moderate concentrations;while catfish, cod, and sole are relatively poor sources. Diets that includefish have also been associated with lower risks for both heart attacks andstrokes. Part of this benefit is due to a reduction in cholesterol levels andpart is a result of the reduced inflammatory response that can trigger theclotting leading to blood vessel blockages. Also of interest are recent reportssuggesting that an omega-3 rich diet may help people with depression.Flaxseed (also known as linseed) is the other readily available source ofomega-3 fatty acids. Flax is the richest known source of alpha linolenic acid(ALA), which can be metabolized into the two omega-3 fatty acids that are foundin fish. A diet that contains flaxseed lowers cholesterol levels andinflammatory biochemicals in the bloodstream. Flax may also help lower bloodpressure. In addition to its content of beneficial omega-3 fatty acids, flaxalso contains high concentrations of phytoestrogens (phyto is Greek for“plant”). These natural hormone regulators, also abundant in soybeans, have beensuggested to help lessen the hot flashes of menopause, slow the development ofosteoporosis, and reduce the risk for breast and prostate cancer. Flax is also agood source of fiber, which helps regulate bowel function.It is easy to add flaxseeds to your diet. Simply roast up a quarter cup offlaxseeds in a dry skillet. Pay close attention as they are roasting and removethe pan from the heat as soon as the first seeds begin to pop. Grind up theseeds in a coffee bean grinder, add a little salt, and then use the ground seedsin your salads, soups, and sauces. They add a delicate popcorn-like flavor whensprinkled over sautéed vegetables. Try to eat a few teaspoons each day. Roastand grind new seeds every few days so they do not go rancid.Although it is possible to obtain your omega-3 fatty acids from fish oilsupplements and flaxseed oil through your local health food store, we encourageyou to go to the most natural sources. Add a couple of helpings of fish to yourdiet each week or, if you are vegetarian, add a daily serving of groundflaxseed, and you will benefit from the health enhancing intelligence thatnature provides.The Joint NutrientsGlucosamine sulfate is a natural constituent of cartilage. A number of studieslooking into supplementing the diet with this substance have shown it can reducepain and improve joint function. It is surprisingly well absorbed from thedigestive tract and in many studies is as effective as standardanti-inflammatory medicines with fewer negative side effects. The usual dose ofglucosamine sulfate is 500 milligrams three times daily.THE NUTRIENTS OF IMMUNITYHealthy immunity is both necessary for and reflective of our health andvitality. When the immune system is functioning at an optimal level, it respondsto challenges proportionate to the threat, neither under- nor overreacting. Manyreports have documented that aging is associated with altered immune function,which makes people susceptible to infections and cancer. In many ways, ourability to discriminate between potentially nourishing and toxic influences isthe essence of a healthy immune system and a healthy life. To grow younger andlive longer, it is essential that we maintain a healthy immune system.The nutritional aspects of immunity have been studied for several decades, andit is clear that a well-nourished person is much more likely to mount a healthyimmune response than one who is undernourished. In particular, the antioxidantsystem plays a key role. Ample levels of vitamins E, C, A, and the carotenoidsalong with the minerals selenium, zinc, and copper are essential for respondingto the inner and outer challenges to our well-being. For example, a recent studyfrom Tufts University found that supplemental doses of vitamin E can improve theimmunity of healthy subjects, at an optimal daily dose of 200 IU. Other studieslooking at vitamin C and beta-carotene have also suggested that abundant levelsof these antioxidants are important for optimal immunity.Nutrients on the HorizonAs interest in the role of nutrition in health expands, we are seeing a numberof new substances coming to market with the promise that they can reverse agingwhile improving health and vitality. Most of these claims are based on limitedstudies that are intriguing but not conclusive. It may turn out that some ofthese nutraceuticals have real value, but we believe it is too soon to justifytheir routine inclusion in our nutritional program. In this section we review avariety of these “horizon” substances and encourage you to research themyourself before adding them to your nutritional program.S-ADENOSYL-METHIONINE (SAME)SAMe is a natural compound that your body manufactures from the amino acidmethionine. It is involved in many essential metabolic reactions including theproduction of key brain chemicals. Studies on people with depression havesuggested that at supplemental doses of 1,600 milligrams per day, over 60percent will show improvement in their mood, often within one to two weeks.SAMe has only been available in the United States for a few years and remainsexpensive. It is usually sold in 200-milligram tablets that can cost more than$2.50 per pill, so a standard dose may cost $20 per day. Side effects tend to bemild but may include nausea, headaches, weakness, and rare palpitations. SomeSAMe advocates discourage its use in bipolar disorder, suggesting that it canaggravate the manic phase. It has been used in lower doses of 800 milligrams perday to treat fibromyalgia. It is often recommended that SAMe be taken along withvitamins B6, B12, and folic acid to enhance its efficacy.SAMe may be an effective alternative to antidepressant medications, but webelieve that more scientific research is necessary before we can recommend itsroutine use. If you are feeling persistently sad and depleted, please see yourhealth-care provider to discuss all potentially helpful treatment options,including SAMe.GROWTH HORMONEIn 1990 an intriguing article on aging by Dr. Daniel Rudman and his colleaguesappeared in the New England Journal of Medicine. Men between sixty and eightyyears of age were given human growth hormone (hGH) injections three times a weekfor six months. At the completion of the study, the men who had received hGHshots had an increase in their lean body mass, a decrease in their fat content,and an increase in the thickness of their skin. Initially, these results wereenthusiastically advertised as evidence that hGH was the sought-after fountainof youth. Unfortunately, subsequent reports found that several undesirable sideeffects developed with its ongoing use. Growth hormone injections had to bediscontinued in a number of men due to the development of carpal tunnelsyndrome, edema, joint aches, or breast swelling. Other reports found thatalthough a person developed greater muscle mass on hGH, they did not increasetheir strength. In fact, adding growth hormone to an good exercise program didnot add additional benefit.Due to the high cost and inconvenience of hGH injections, there have beenattempts to stimulate the production and release of growth hormone through aminoacids taken orally. It has been known for many years that giving the amino acidarginine intravenously increases the level of growth hormone. Efforts to boostgrowth hormone levels with oral arginine have met with mixed results.Considering all the currently available information, we do not believe thatthere is enough current evidence to support the long-term value ofpharmacologically manipulating growth hormone levels. We will continue to followthe research in this area with great interest.DEHYDROEPIANDROSTERONE (DHEA)This natural hormone produced by the adrenal glands must have a purpose, butdespite the fact that it was identified over fifty years ago, scientists havenot yet determined what it does. It is known that we make very little DHEAduring the first ten years of life, we make a lot of it between the ages oftwenty and forty, and then we gradually discontinue making it, so by the time weare seventy, we have less DHEA than we had as teenagers. The effects of givinganimals and people supplementary DHEA have yielded contradictory results,generating a lot of controversy. Some enthusiastic advocates promote DHEA as theantiaging elixir, while most medical scientists believe that further study isnecessary to determine its lasting benefits and risks to health. Among thethousands of studies on this intriguing chemical, there are reports that it canrelieve depression, improve certain aspects of memory, reduce body fat, andenhance immunity. In a recent study from France, men and women between the agesof sixty and eighty years were given a daily DHEA dose of 50 milligrams andcompared to other subjects taking a placebo. At the conclusion of the one-yearexperiment, mild benefits to the skin were seen in the younger men, while womenover seventy showed modest improvements in their skin, bones, and libido.Whether these effects are due to the conversion of DHEA to male and female sexhormones or a specific action of DHEA on its own is not known. Unfortunately,for almost every study that suggests a benefit there is usually another one thatfails to support it.Although serious side effects are uncommon, DHEA is converted into male andfemale hormones and may contribute to health concerns ranging from acne toactivation of breast and prostate cancer to psychiatric problems. The otherissue of concern with DHEA is that we really don’t know what long-term sideeffects it may cause. Although the recent French study lasted a year, mostinvestigations showing either benefit or no benefit have lasted less than threemonths. We believe that too many questions still need to be answered before wecan endorse the routine use of this fascinating hormone. We’ll continue to watchDHEA with great interest and provide you with updates as new informationunfolds. In the meantime, we can take some reassurance from a study which showedthat regular practitioners of meditation have higher DHEA levels than people whoare not meditating.PHENOLIC COMPOUNDSNutritional scientists have identified many health-enhancing substances thatcome from our food. Members of the natural plant chemical family known asphenolic compounds are receiving a lot of attention for their potent antioxidantproperties. Some of the chemicals that you may have heard about includebioflavonoids, iso-flavonoids, catechins, and proanthocyanidins. Found in greentea, berries, grape skins and seeds, as well as pine bark, some of these naturalchemicals have been found to be as much as fifty times more powerful scavengersof free radicals than vitamins C and E. The antioxidant properties of theproanthocyanidins derived from grapes may explain the beneficial effect of wineon the heart. In addition to a possible role in the prevention of heart disease,these substances have also been shown to have possible protective activityagainst cancer, degenerative brain conditions, and macular degeneration of theeye.As a result of these studies, many nutritional supplement companies are offeringconcentrated capsules of these helpful agents. Grape seed extract, powderedgreen tea extract, and pine bark extract (commonly known as pycnogenol) arewidely available in health food stores and have been promoted as antiagingwonder drugs. We agree that these substances are natural botanical gifts, butbelieve they are best consumed as nature provided them. Our bottom lineregarding these super antioxidants is to eat plenty of blueberries,strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, and cranberries. Consume lots of grapesand chew the seeds. A cup or two of green tea will invigorate you while you arereceiving the antioxidant benefits of the polyphenols contained within. Inregards to this class of age-reversing allies, we believe that good food isbetter than good medicine.Our Daily Vitamin RecommendationsLiving beings have evolved for billions of years without the consumption ofnutritional supplements, with most of the substances packed into a multivitamintablet having been identified chemically only within the last century. And yetit is becoming increasingly clear that the levels of vitamins that prevent adeficiency disease may not be the levels that provide optimal health. We viewnutritional supplementation as an insurance policy. The following daily dosesare encouraged to complement a well-balanced diet. They fall well within safetylimits while reflecting the information on the role that higher intake may playin lowering the risk for the common conditions that deplete our vitality andmake us sick. You can usually fulfill these requirements by taking ahigh-potency multivitamin, multimineral supplement. Our recommended Reversal ofAging nutritional complement plan is listed in the appendix.If you are at risk for heart disease, you may benefit from an additional dose ofB vitamins, including folic acid, B6, and B12. If you feel your memory is notserving you as well as you remember it did, consider adding a daily helping ofginkgo biloba. If your joints have been calling for attention, increase yourintake of omega-3 fatty acids and try supplementing with glucosamine sulfate.Using these concentrated nutrients to complement a healthy lifestyle and dietcan help you grow younger and live longer. But do not forget: Nutritionalsupplements are not a substitute for a nutritionally balanced diet.Nutrient RitualRituals serve to focus your attention. You probably cannot remember what youwore to dinner last Thursday evening, but if that night you attended an awardsceremony or a birthday celebration, the previously forgotten details may becomeavailable to you. Rituals take you from mindlessness to mindfulness. They bringyou into present moment awareness. Rituals focus your intentions and stimulateyour inner drugstore to produce age-reversing compounds.Consciously taking your supplements can empower their effects and enhance theirbenefits. Although some disparage the so-called placebo effect, we see it as avaluable expression of your natural inherent health-promoting pharmacy. When youanticipate the benefits of nutritional complements, you activate your body’srejuvenating chemicals to work in partnership with them.image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_052_r1.jpg]Each morning when you take your nutrients, spend a few moments acknowledging therejuvenating, strengthening, and life-enhancing influence they are having onyou. Envision the subtle yet potent nourishment these vital nutrients areproviding every cell, tissue, and organ in your body. Make the process of takingyour nutritional complements a daily health-promoting ritual. Repeat theaffirmations that reinforce your Biostat while taking your nutrients. Use yourattention and intention to augment their age-reversing power. As you are takingyour nutritional complements, repeat:Every day in every way, I am increasing my mental and physical capacity.My Biostat is set at a healthy ____ years of age.I look and feel a healthy ____ years old. I am reversing my biological age:By changing my perception of my body, its aging and time;Through two kinds of deep rest—restful awareness and restful sleep;By nurturing my body through healthy foods; andBy using nutritional complements wisely.image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_053_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_054_r1.jpg]6image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_055_r1.jpg]You Can Reverse YourBiological Age by EnhancingMind/Body Integration ACTION STEP # 5I am reversing my biological age by enhancing mind/body integration.I put this into practice by:Performing breathing techniques (Pranayama) five to ten minutes daily.Performing ten to fifteen minutes of yoga, tai chi, or qigong each day.Practicing body awareness and learning to follow the healthy signals from mybody when there are conflicting messages from my mind.image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_056_r1.jpg]The body and mind are one.When the intimate relationshipbetween mind and body is disrupted,aging and entropy accelerate.Restoring mind/body integrationbrings about renewal.Through conscious breathingand movement techniques,you can renew the body/mindand reverse the aging process. image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_057_r1.jpg]image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_058_r1.jpg]You can reverse your biological age by enhancing the integration between yourmind and body. Mind and body are intimately interconnected. Your body iscomposed of physiological systems, organs, and tissues, but at its basis is acollection of molecules. Your mind is composed of ideas and beliefs, memoriesand desires, but is essentially a collection of thoughts. Your body is amolecular field; your mind is a thought field. Giving rise to both your field ofmolecules and your field of thoughts is an underlying field of consciousness,which is the source of both your mind and body. Every time you have a thoughtyou precipitate a molecule in your nervous system that influences the othermolecules throughout your body. Stagnation in the mind/body connection resultsin aging and illness. Enlivening the mind/body connection leads to healing andthe reversal of aging.Enhancing the integration between mind and body requires listening to thesignals from inside as attentively as you listen to information from theoutside. Mind/body integration means establishing a healthy dialogue betweenyour thoughts and molecules. It means listening to your body and responding withlove and reverence. A body listened to answers back with energy, strength, andflexibility— the qualities of a body growing younger.There are many established practices devoted to enhancing mind/body integration.Yoga, tai chi, qigong, akaido, and other disciplines use conscious breathing andphysical movements to bring your attention into the body and into the presentmoment. These approaches enable you to listen to the signals your body issending and to enliven energy in the body through your attention and intention.There is an expression in the Bhagavad Gita, the ancient Vedic epic, that inSanskrit goes “Yogastah kuru karmani.” This can be translated into English as“Established in yoga, perform action.” Yoga here means union. The English wordyoke, as in “uniting two oxen,” is related to this Sanskrit root. Established inyoga, then, means established in a state of unity in which body, mind, andspirit are experienced as one continuum. Once your consciousness is on thislevel, you perform your daily actions without losing your connection towholeness. This is the goal of all mind/body integration techniques.Breathing IntegrationConscious breath work is at the center of mind/body integration. The breathintegrates mind and body. Thought is the movement of breath. Breath is themovement of thought. When your mind is agitated, your breathing is disturbed.When your mind is serene, your breathing is calm. You can use mental techniquesto calm your breath, as in meditation. Likewise, you can use breathingtechniques to calm your mind. In yoga and Ayurveda, these breathing techniquesare called Pranayama. The word means “expanding Prana,” or “expansion of thelife force.”There are Pranayama practices to energize you, soothe your body, and quiet yourmind. Depending on the technique and your intention, you can use Pranayama toenliven you in the morning, calm you when you are upset, or settle your mindwhen you are trying to go to sleep. Let’s review three basic conscious breathingexercises to enhance your mind/body integration and reverse aging.ENERGIZING BREATHYou can invigorate your body and mind with the breathing technique known asbhastrika or “bellows breath.” This exercise cleanses your lungs whileincreasing the oxygen flow to your cells and tissues.Sit comfortably with your spine upright and close your eyes. Exhale all the airfrom your lungs. Then begin deep in-and-out breathing through your nose silentlyusing the mantras “So” on the inflow and “Hum” on the outflow. For the firsttwenty breaths take two-second slow forceful inhalations and two-second slowforceful exhalations. It is easiest to keep track of the number of breaths bycounting on your fingers.The next twenty breaths are performed faster with approximately one-secondinhalations and one-second exhalations. These are also performed through thenose while thinking “So” on the in-breath and “Hum” on the out-breath.Finally, perform twenty rapid bhastrika breaths, with approximately half-secondinhalations and half-second exhalations. After the twenty rapid breaths, performone more slow deep breath and then simply feel the sensations in your body. Youwill notice that your mind is clear and quiet while your body is energized.Do not hyperventilate to the point where you are feeling light-headed or dizzy.The breath movement is almost entirely abdominal, using your diaphragm to moveair. Your head and shoulders should be relaxed and mostly still. Use bhastrikawhen you are feeling a little sluggish and need a quick replenishment of energy.It is also beneficial prior to your afternoon meditation to clear awaydrowsiness before you start your practice.SOOTHING BREATHThe soothing breath technique known as Ujayi can be used to settle your mind andbody when you are feeling frustrated or irritated. When performed correctly itcreates a cooling effect at the back of the throat and has a stabilizinginfluence on the cardiorespiratory system.To perform Ujayi breath, take a slightly deeper than normal inhalation. On theexhalation, slightly constrict your throat muscles so it sounds as if you aresnoring. Your out-breath is through your nose with your mouth closed. Anotherway to get the hang of this practice is to first exhale, “Haaah,” with yourmouth open. Now make a similar motion with your mouth closed. This will resultin the desired breathy, snoring sound. Once you have mastered it on the outflow,perform the same procedure on inflow. The result is that you sound a little likeDarth Vader from Star Wars.When you find yourself becoming aggravated or upset, shift into Ujayi breath andyou will notice a prompt soothing influence. You can also use this whenperforming yoga postures and while exercising at a moderate level. Practicingthis soothing breath technique will reduce wear and tear on your physiology andslow aging.RELAXING BREATHYou can calm your mind with the breathing technique known as Nadi Shodhana. InEnglish this means, “clearing the channels.” Nadi Shodhana is very beneficialwhen you are having a lot of anxious thoughts, and when you are trying to quietyour mind. It requires the use of your right hand to alternately close yourright, then left nostril. Hold your hand so your thumb, index finger, andremaining fingers are separated. You use your thumb to close your right nostriland your third and fourth finger to close your left.Take a slow moderately deep breath, and then close off your right nasal passagewith your thumb. Exhale slowly through your left nostril, then inhale slowlythrough your left nostril, then close off your left nostril with your third andfourth fingers. Exhale through your right nostril, inhale through your rightnostril, and then again close your right nasal passage, exhaling through yourleft. Continue with this pattern for five to ten minutes, alternating thenostril after each inhalation. After just a few cycles you will experience yourmind calming and your body relaxing.image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_059_r1.jpg]Nadi ShodhanaUse these practices throughout the day to balance your mind and body. Pranayamacan energize you without the need for caffeine, relax you without the need fortranquilizers, and soothe you without the need for alcohol. These naturaltechniques help to balance and nourish the field of energy, transformation, andintelligence commonly known as your body/mind.Mind/Body MovementTechniques such as yoga, tai chi, and qigong can be thought of as practicesessions for establishing yourself in a state of body/mind/ spirit unity whileengaging in action. Each of these ancient practices enlivens the integrationbetween body and mind.REVERSAL-OF-AGING YOGAIt is a rare town in the Western world in which you cannot find a yoga class.This would not have been the case twenty-five years ago, when the averageWesterner’s vision of a yoga practitioner was an emaciated, loinclothed man on abed of nails. Today, yoga has gone mainstream with classes available in shoppingmalls, YMCAs, and corporate fitness clubs. Yoga can help enliven many aspects ofmind/body fitness, serving to enhance relaxation, flexibility, muscle tone, andstrength.The roots of yoga go back at least five thousand years, a testament to itsenduring value, independent of time or culture. Modern science has recentlybegun to pay attention to the measurable benefits of yoga in a variety of healthdomains including arthritis, asthma, heart disease, and diabetes. Most people doyoga because it helps them become centered and relaxed while enhancing thecomfort they experience in their bodies.There are hundreds of different yoga systems available in the world today. Someare designed to build strength; others are intended more for flexibility andrelaxation. Regardless of the system you are attracted to, be certain to performyour postures with full awareness in your body, heeding the signals of comfortand discomfort that are generated. Practice your poses regularly and consciouslyand you will see steady improvement in your flexibility and mind/bodyintegration.The Sun SalutationsA set of twelve yoga positions known as the Sun Salutations are a wonderful,balanced series of movements that can enhance flexibility, strength, and evenaerobic capacity, depending upon how they are performed. We recommend movingthrough a few rounds of the Sun Salutations at least once a day, either early inthe morning or in the late afternoon, when the sun is rising or setting. Theyprovide a full stretch to all the key areas of the body and awaken our intrinsicvitality.image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_060_r1.jpg]1. Salutation poseStand with your feet firmly on the ground, eyes facing forward, with the palmsof your hands held together in front of your chest.

Sky-reaching poseSlowly raise your body, leading with your hands until you are stretching towardthe sky; inhale as you straighten your spine.image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_071_r1.jpg]12. Salutation poseOnce again return to this resting pose with your palms together in front of yourchest, breathing easily.These twelve postures constitute one cycle. Do between four and twelve rounds ata time. Done vigorously, they can raise your heart rate and provide acardiovascular workout. Performed in a slow, relaxed manner, they will have acalming effect on your body and mind. Try using the Ujayi breath as you areinhaling and exhaling during the poses. Keep your attention in your body,releasing any tension or resistance you may feel. Listen to your body’s signalswhile performing the poses for the optimal age-reversing mind/body integration.Sitting Sun SalutesYou can perform a sitting variation of the twelve Sun Salutations with almostthe same benefit as doing them on the floor. They can be done at work in youroffice chair or in an airplane seat. They will stretch and tone you whileincreasing your circulation.image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_072_r1.jpg]Sit comfortably on a firm chair with your feet resting solidly on the floor.With your palms together in front of your chest, center your awareness in yourbody, breathing easily.image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_073_r1.jpg]Reach your arms upward, stretching your shoulders and upper back while youinhale.image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_074_r1.jpg]Bend forward, relaxing your spine until your palms are on the floor next to yourfeet.

Their gracefulslow movements improve balance, flexibility, and strength, enhancing both mentaland physical well-being. Qi (chi) is the Chinese word for life force. Tai chi isthe process of connecting with the supreme universal force. Qigong is translatedas “energy cultivation.” Both techniques are closely related meditations inmotion, designed to awaken awareness in the body with their fluid, centeredmovements. Millions of people perform tai chi and qigong in China where they areconsidered premier mind/body fitness programs that cultivate relaxation in themidst of action. They integrate intention, breath, and movement to enhancemind/body coordination.Scientific studies on these practices have documented many benefits on severalaspects of health. People practicing tai chi show improved balance andcoordination as well as enhanced heart and lung fitness. We encourage you tofind a local tai chi or qigong class and use these beautiful movements to awakenmind/body integration.To get a sense of the calming vitality these techniques provide, try this simplebasic movement.Moving Your EnergyPerform this beginning movement with your full attention in your body. All themoves are continuous, fluid, and in slow motion.image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_084_r1.jpg]Stand with your feet a little more than shoulder-width apart, parallel to eachother.image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_085_r1.jpg]Slowly raise your arms forward and upward, while at the same time slightlybending your knees. Continue until your hands are about shoulder height, withyour fingertips pointing toward each other about six inches apart, your palmsfacing toward you.image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_086_r1.jpg]Continue moving slowly as you rotate your shoulder inward, lowering your handsso your palms face the floor at about waist height. At the same time, bend yourknees a little more.image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_087_r1.jpg]Again, gradually raise your arms and hands until your fingertips are againfacing each other; at the same time, rise up slightly, partially straighteningyour knees.Repeat this sequence several times, imagining that you are moving in water.After a few cycles, slowly lower your hands to your side and resume a normalrelaxed stance.CONSCIOUSNESS IN MOTIONEach of these mind/body practices encourages the body to express its naturalvitality through movement. As the energy of your body is allowed to flow, thechattering of your mind subsides and a state of innocent witnessing emerges.This experience of being fully present in your body cultivates mind/bodyintegration, enhancing the sensitivity of your thoughts to your molecules.Just as we know that our thoughts and feelings can influence our body, we knowthat our bodies influence our psychology and emotions. Changing your posture,pose, or position has a direct and immediate influence on how you feel andthink. If you are feeling depleted and exhausted, try changing the way you aresitting or standing to reflect a more energized position and notice how yourmental state is transformed. Developing enhanced mind/body integration throughyoga, tai chi, and qigong allows imbalances to be identified and corrected morereadily, before they create more established conditions.We encourage you to find your program of conscious movement. Practicing theseprocedures with your full attention will enable you to maintain a clear andhealthy line of communication between your mind and body at all stages of yourlife.MIND/BODY COMMUNICATIONNot listening to your body’s healthy signals accelerates aging and is the rootcause of many illnesses. When your body is expressing a healthy need but yourmind refuses to listen, imbalances begin, and the seeds of mind/bodydisintegration are sown. Here are several common examples of mind/bodycommunication breakdown:Your body is tired and needs to sleep; your mind overrides this need in order towatch a late-night television show.Your body is full at the end of a meal; your mind insists on returning to thebuffet for another helping of dessert.Your body needs to eat; your mind insists that you have to work through lunch.Your body is calling you to empty your bladder; your mind refuses to leave yourseat in the middle of a movie.Your body is asking to stretch; your mind refuses to disturb the otherpassengers in your airplane row.Start listening to the signals from your body and honoring those that arehealth-promoting. You know which signals are good for you and which come fromunhealthy habits. Whenever there is a conflict between your physical needs andyour mental or emotional ones, ask yourself a simple question: Will fulfillingthis need help me grow younger and live longer? If the answer is yes, fulfillthe need. If the answer is no, because you recognize that the behavior ispotentially harmful, pass. If due to a habit or addiction, the impulse is sostrong that it overrides your better judgment, perform the action with fullawareness and attention in your body. Consciously witness your choice withoutharshly judging yourself. If you are meditating regularly and are witnessingyour choices, you will soon find that fewer impulses arise to create conflictbetween your mind and body.Every day in every way,I am increasing my mental and physical capacity.My Biostat is set at a healthy ____ years of age.I look and feel a healthy ____ years old. I am reversing my biological age:By changing my perception of my body, its aging, and time;Through two kinds of deep rest—restful awareness and restful sleep;By nurturing my body through healthy foods;By using nutritional complements wisely; andBy enhancing mind/body integration.image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_088_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_089_r1.jpg]7image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_090_r1.jpg]You Can Reverse YourBiological AgeThrough Exercise ACTION STEP # 6I am reversing my biological age through regular exercise.I put this into practice by:Performing some aerobic activity at least three times a week.Performing twenty minutes of strength training at least three times a week.Consciously making choices that keep me physically active.image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_091_r1.jpg]A complete exercise programincludes attention to stretching,strength training, andcardiovascular conditioning.Exercise reverses allthe biomarkers of aging. image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_092_r1.jpg]image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_093_r1.jpg]One of the most important steps to reverse your biological age is regularexercise. In this age of push-button technology you run the risk of spending somuch time in your mind that you neglect the needs of your body. One of thecritical needs of your body is to move. “Use it or lose it” is directlyapplicable to your physical body. We are seeing a growing epidemic of obesity inWestern society that is now affecting our children, mainly because the averageperson—adult or child—spends less time moving their body than at any point inhuman history. As a result of not exercising regularly, we suffer increasedrisks for heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, arthritis, osteoporosis,and cancer.Several studies have shown how hazardous inactivity can be to your health. Areport published in 1968 found that if you impose bed rest on young, healthy menfor three weeks, their measurements of cardiovascular fitness deteriorate by theequivalent of almost twenty years of aging. As anyone who has had to wear a castfor a broken bone knows firsthand, not using a muscle leads to wasting andweakness.Exercise alone can alter many of the important biomarkers of aging. Drs. WilliamEvans and Irwin Rosenberg from Tufts University have documented the powerfuleffects exercise has on improving muscle mass, strength, aerobic capacity, bonedensity, and many other key biological markers of aging. One of the mosteffective ways to raise your level of HDL cholesterol (the “good” cholesterol)is through exercise. Studies have shown that men sixty to seventy years old canincrease their muscle strength by 100 to over 200 percent after just twelveweeks of training. While your body is getting stronger, it is also gettingleaner. As a result, your ability to handle sugar is improved and the risks fordiabetes are reduced. Regular weight training strengthens your bones and lessensthe chances for developing osteoporosis. This is particularly important forwomen who are at risk of losing bone once they are beyond their reproductiveyears.Of all the approaches to growing younger, exercise produces the most promptreturns. Within a week of beginning a fitness program, you’ll notice definiteimprovement in your sense of well-being. After a few weeks you will not be ableto go without it. Regular exercise is an essential element of thereversal-of-aging program.Total FitnessA complete fitness program includes exercises to enhance flexibility, strength,and endurance. Improving suppleness in the body improves your physical andemotional comfort level and reduces your chances for injury. As discussed in thelast chapter, yoga, tai chi, and qigong all expand flexibility while enhancingmind/body integration. At least ten minutes of gentle, conscious stretchingshould be a part of every exercise warm-up routine. Unfortunately, we see toomany people who have the good intention to start exercising, but fail to takethe time to warm up properly. As a result, they strain a muscle or pull aligament and are unable to continue the fitness program they need.Building strength enhances vitality and reverses a common feature of aging knownas sarcopenia. This word, coined by researchers at Tufts University, means “lackof flesh.” Weakness, reduced muscle mass, and increased body fat are well-knownconsequences of inactivity. But they can all be reversed through strengthtraining. Improving muscle tone through weight-bearing exercises can alsoimprove your posture and reduce back pain. If you are dealing with chroniclow-back problems and believe you cannot exercise, start slowly to build yourback and abdominal muscle strength and your pain will diminish.There are emotional and psychological benefits of exercise. Hundreds of studiesattest to the value of regular exercise on your mood and mental state. These aresome of the psychological benefits that have been shown with exercise:Less depressionLess anxietyLess angerLess cynical distrustImproved self-esteemBetter resilience to stressImproved sleepExercise gives you a greater sense of confidence and competence. It is good foryour body and good for your mind. Let’s look more closely at the essentialingredients of an effective age-reversing fitness program.FlexibilityPerform a few minutes of stretching before a more vigorous strength-training orcardiovascular workout. Particularly if you have a sedentary job in which youare sitting for hours at a time, a few minutes of flexibility exercise willovercome the shortening and tightness of muscles that comes with inactivity.Surprisingly, there is only limited scientific documentation that stretchingbefore exercise reduces muscle injuries. Those reports that show a benefitsuggest that active stretching while holding a position for fifteen secondsprovides the most benefit. If you are prone to low-back pain, spine-stretchingexercises can reduce your discomfort during and after your exercise time.Try five to ten minutes of yoga or another flexibility exercise each day at thestart of your workout. The Sun Salutations (see page 114) stretch every musclegroup, improve spinal flexibility, increase circulation, and improve muscletone. Use the Sun Salutations to bring your attention into your body inpreparation for strength training and aerobic activity.Building StrengthMuscles respond to use, which means that to build strength you have to regularlyactivate a muscle group. The human body has over one hundred different musclesthat govern your movements and support your posture. You can gain great benefitby systematically exercising the major muscle groups in your arms, legs, andtrunk. The key to building muscle strength is to start off slowly and graduallybuild up your conditioning level. While fitness centers offer expanded exerciseoptions and can provide needed motivation, you do not need expensive equipmentto get a good workout.The Basic SevenTry the basic seven exercises below every other day for two weeks and you willsee a noticeable improvement in your muscle tone and strength. Plan to spendfour to five minutes performing each exercise for a thirty-minutestrength-building workout.image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_094_r1.jpg]1. CurlsCurls. This exercise builds the muscles that flex the elbow. Find an object thatweighs four to five pounds to start. You can purchase a small dumbbell or use anunopened half-gallon container of water, milk, or orange juice. Sitting in achair with your back supported, do ten to fifteen repetitions: Start with yourforearm resting on your thigh, palm facing up. Slowly extend your elbow and thenfully flex it. Inhale while flexing your arms and exhale while extending. Aftercompleting a round of repetitions, rest about half a minute and then repeat. Dothis three to five times with each arm. After a few weeks, you can graduallyincrease the weight by a couple of pounds. This exercise primarily strengthensthe biceps muscle.Shoulder rotators. A valuable exercise that reduces shoulder injuries is onethat strengthens the muscles that rotate your arms outward. Most exerciseprograms do not work these external image[images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_095_r1.jpg]2. Shoulder rotatorsrotators, creating imbalances in the shoulder girdle. These imbalances thenpredispose you to rotator cuff injuries.Sit with your back supported and use the same weight as above. With your elbowsheld at your sides, begin with your arms straight ahead and parallel to thefloor. Now slowly rotate your hands outward as far as you can. Hold thisposition for a few seconds and then return to the starting point. Repeat theexternal rotations ten times.Another way to strengthen these same muscles is by using a large elastic rubberband that you hold with both hands. Then, rotate your arms externally using therubber band for resistance.Push-ups. This well-known exercise helps build the shoulder girdle muscles andthe triceps. If you cannot do full straight-legged push-ups, begin with modifiedones, supporting your weight on your knees. Inhale while lowering yourselftoward the floor and exhale while rising. Begin with eight to ten repetitions,resting for half a minute between sets. Aim for three sets the first week,gradually increasing to five.image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_096_r1.jpg]3. Push-upsimage [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_097_r1.jpg]4. Abdominal crunchesAbdominal crunches. When doing abdominal crunches it is important to recognizethat you need to raise your head only 25 to 30 degrees off the ground to gainmaximum benefit. As opposed to sit-ups, abdominal crunches do not placeunnecessary strain on your spine. Lie on a padded surface with your knees bentand your fingers laced behind your head. Lift your head and shoulders off theground with your chin separated about a fist distance from your chest. Inhalewhile lifting off and exhale while returning to the floor. Perform fifteencrunches, followed by half a minute of rest. Begin with three sets, graduallyincreasing to five.image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_098_r1.jpg]5. Back strengthenersBack strengtheners. Lie on your stomach with your palms on the floor. Withoutpushing off with your hands, slowly lift your chest off the floor by tighteningyour back muscles. Your arms and hands are just used to provide stabilization.Repeatedly raise and lower your chest to the floor, using only your backmuscles. Do about twenty to twenty-five lifts as a set.Thigh strengtheners. These are best performed while supporting yourself withyour hands on a table or chair. To protect your knees and gain a full thighmuscle workout, do not bend beyond 90 degrees at the knees. Maintain your backperpendicular to the floor. Inhale while you are squatting and exhale whilerising. Begin with fifteen squats, rest for half a minute and then repeat theset.image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_099_r1.jpg]6. Thigh strengthenersYou can gain similar benefits by stair-stepping. Find a platform that is a footoff the ground and repeatedly step up, leading first with one leg, then theother. Start with twenty-five steps with each leg. Continue until you feel amild burn in your thigh muscles.You can also use weights to strengthen the muscles that extend your knee. Sit ina firm chair with your back supported; place a two- to five-pound weight aroundeach ankle. Slowly straighten your knee, hold it for a few seconds, and thenslowly return your foot to the floor. Do one side then the other, beginning withabout ten repetitions.Toe risers. This exercise tones and strengthens the calf muscles. Stand in yourbare or stocking feet, supporting yourself with your hands on a table or chair.Slowly raise yourself up on your toes, and then slowly lower yourself. Inhalewhile you are rising and exhale while lowering. Do twenty to twenty-five raises,rest for half a minute and repeat. Try three sets at first, gradually increasingto five.image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_100_r1.jpg]7. Toe risersCirculating the Life ForceThe human physiology is a sophisticated biological instrument designed totransform creativity into manifestation, thought into action. If you are notregularly increasing the flow of oxygen into your lungs and enhancing thecirculation of blood through your body, you are not providing your physiologythe opportunity to experience peak performance. As a result of inadequatelyexercising your cardiovascular and respiratory systems, you place yourself atincreased risk for heart disease, high blood pressure, and a variety ofdifferent cancers. At any age and regardless of your current level of fitness,beginning an aerobic exercise program will improve your physical and emotionalwell-being and help you grow younger.As is true with strength training, a cardiovascular fitness program does nothave to be complicated in order to provide health-enhancing benefits. You dohave to be regular, for your mind can always come up with some reason whyexercise is not a good idea today, particularly if you get off your routine andmiss a few sessions. Find an aerobic activity that you can doregularly—regardless of the weather—and stick with it. Three to four sessionsper week for twenty to thirty minutes is usually enough to gain substantialbenefits. There are a few simple principles to follow to determine how much andhow often you should be exercising in order to gain maximum cardiovascularbenefit.CALCULATING YOUR TARGET EXERCISE LEVELThe first step is to calculate your maximal heart rate (MHR), which isdetermined by subtracting your age from 220.image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_101_r1.jpg]For example, if you are 50 years old, your maximal heart rate is 170 (220 − 50).If you are just beginning an exercise program, first check with your healthprovider to make certain there are no contraindications to starting anunsupervised exercise program, such as heart disease, severe obesity, orlimiting arthritis.At the beginning of your program, aim to reach a target exercise heart ratebetween 50 and 60 percent of your MHR. Choose 60 percent if you are inreasonably good shape and 50 percent if you are not or if it’s been a long timesince you’ve performed any cardiovascular activity.image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_102_r1.jpg]At age fifty, this is calculated to be 85 to 102 beats per minute (50% of 170 =85; 60% of 170 = 102).Take your pulse before you start and then begin exercising until your heart ratehits the target number. There are many high-quality heart monitors available forunder $100 in the marketplace, with some as low as $50. If you do not have amonitoring device, you can still check your pulse every five to ten minuteswhile exercising, but it is easier to determine your exercise level if you canjust glance at a wrist monitor.Optimal benefit is gained when you exercise between twenty and thirty minutes,but if you are out of shape, begin with just ten or fifteen minutes. A widerange of activities can provide an effective cardiovascular workout, includingjogging, bicycling, dancing, cycling, kickboxing, spinning, treadmill,stair-climbing, rowing, hiking, and swimming. Find something you like to do thatis easily accessible to you. There is also proven benefit to cross-training.This means finding a few different strength-training and aerobic activities thatyou can rotate through on different days. One day you might use a treadmill fortwenty minutes, the next day you may ride a bike, and another you may go to anaerobics dance class. Each activity will work a different set of muscles whileimproving your cardiovascular fitness. Establish a regular time for your dailyroutine to maintain consistency.Once you are comfortable at your current level of activity, try graduallyincreasing your target heart rate from 65 to 75 percent of your MHR. At agefifty, this would mean a target heart between 110 and 128 beats per minute (65%of 170 = 110; 75% of 170 = 128). For the first couple of weeks, remain at 60percent and then gradually increase your target rate by 5 percent every fewweeks until you are at 70 to 75 percent of your MHR.Do not increase your target rate if you are straining at your current level. Youshould be able to speak while you are exercising, although if you can easilycarry on a conversation, you are probably ready to increase your intensity. Forthe most part, you should be able to breathe through your nose. Try thinking the“So Hum” mantra while you are exercising to keep your attention fully in yourbody, using “So” on inhalations and “Hum” on exhalations.A thin layer of perspiration tells you that your body is burning calories, butyou should not be sweating profusely. If at any time you become acutely short ofbreath or develop chest discomfort, stop your activity and immediately contactyour health care provider. Although you will feel that you have definitelyexpended energy during a good workout, you should not feel completely exhaustedor depleted. Some mild soreness is common at first or when you increase yourintensity, but you should not have severe discomfort. Use common sense and aimfor the long-term balanced benefits of a regular exercise program.It will not take long to see improvements in both strength and cardiovascularfitness with a consistent fitness program. In addition to an improvement in yourgeneral sense of well-being, you will notice that you are losing accumulatedweight, sleeping better, and experiencing better digestion and elimination. Mostimportant, you will look and feel your healthy Biostat age. No one can take thisstep toward improved physical capacity but you. Start today and you will quicklysee yourself growing younger.Exercise on the RoadIf your life involves a good deal of travel it will take some extra attention tostay on your exercise routine. Most hotels have a workout room with basicequipment. Ask about the exercise facilities when you are making a reservation.Even if equipment is not available, you can perform the basic seven exercises inyour hotel room using two-liter water bottles for your weights. The otherstrength-training drills simply use your body.If a treadmill is unavailable, you can get in your cardiovascular conditioningby doing Sun Salutations rapidly for fifteen to twenty minutes. Use the stairsinstead of the hotel elevator to get to your room floor. If your businessmeeting is within walking distance, leave enough time to get there with a briskstroll rather than taking a taxi. It is always easier to continue exercisingregularly than it is to stop for a week or two and then restart. Make yourfitness program a high priority. (For more information on the Grow Younger, LiveLonger Fitness Program, see the appendix on page 271.)Staying ActiveSeek out opportunities during the day to be physically active. If you live halfa mile from your fitness club, put on your running shoes and jog there insteadof driving and spending ten minutes looking for a parking place. If you work onthe twentieth story of a high-rise office building, take the elevator to thesixteenth floor and walk up the remaining flights of stairs. If you need to pickup a few items at the grocery store, ride your bike and save some fossil fuel.Park your car a few blocks from work and walk the rest of the way to and fromyour office.Consciously make the choices to stay physically active. Your body and mind willrespond with greater energy and vitality. Staying active will help you growyounger and live longer.Every day in every way,I am increasing my mental and physical capacity.My Biostat is set at a healthy ____ years of age.I look and feel a healthy ____ years old.

Everyimpulse of life can be considered in terms of whether it brings nourishment ortoxicity. A nourishing experience brings you happiness, expands your awareness,and helps you grow younger. A toxic experience brings misery, makes you feelstuck, and accelerates aging. This is true whether you are talking about toxicsubstances, toxic food, toxic relationships, or toxic emotions. An essentialstep to reverse the aging process is to identify and release toxins from everylevel of your life.Aging and illness result from the accumulation of toxic reactions. Scientistsnow understand that toxic damage to cells and tissues is the consequence of freeradicals that are formed whenever oxygen is metabolized. A free radical moleculeis an oxygen molecule that is missing an electron. Also known as reactive oxygenspecies (ROS), they go by names such as hydroxy radical, singlet oxygen,superoxide, and hydrogen peroxide. These hungry chemicals are indiscriminateabout how they replace their missing electron, and will strip one from anynearby source, including proteins, fats, or DNA molecules. Under controlledsituations, free radicals are useful in metabolizing food and mounting an immuneresponse against invading bacteria. However, the collateral damage of freeradical formation is responsible for illness and aging. Many of the most commonillnesses of our society linked to free radical damage are:CancerHeart diseaseStrokeDiabetesArthritisOsteoporosisInflammatory bowel diseaseGlaucomaRetinal degenerationAlzheimer’s diseaseWrinkling skin, graying hair, and stiffening joints are also the result of freeradicals. There are things you can do that increase free radical production andother things that can limit them. Things that increase free radical formationinclude:SmokingEnvironmental pollutionAlcoholRadiation, including excessive sunlight exposureBarbecued and smoked meatsAged and fermented foodsChemotherapy drugsHigh intake of saturated and hydrogenated fatsStress and stress hormonesWe have evolved a sophisticated system to neutralize the damaging effects offree radicals on our bodies. This is called the antioxidant system and itinvolves many different enzymes, vitamins, and minerals. When your antioxidantsystem is fully operational, you are able to deactivate the free radicalmolecules before they do harm.Things you can do to enhance your antioxidant system include:Eat more antioxidant-rich foods—fresh fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts, andbeans.Use antioxidant-rich herbs and spices liberally—dill, coriander, rosemary, sage,thyme, mint, fennel, ginger, and garlic.Take antioxidant vitamins—A, C, and E.Eliminate tobacco, excessive alcohol, and nonessential drugs.Reduce your stress—meditate.The accumulation of toxins in the body/mindsystem accelerates aging. Relinquishing Toxic SubstancesHuman beings have this curious propensity to be attracted to things that are notgood for them. Part of this affinity is chemical, for nicotine, illicit drugs,and alcohol mimic natural biochemicals in doses that create cravings when thesubstance is withdrawn. Part of this tendency may be our childlike resistance toauthority figures telling us what is good and bad. Whatever the explanation,once a toxic habit is established, the ritual itself provides reinforcement forthe behavior. For example, just the familiar act of pouring a drink or lightingup a cigarette may soothe anxiety. The problem, of course, is that theshort-term relief provided by the behavior may predispose us to long-termsuffering.Our experience at the Chopra Center has taught us that in order for someone torelease something that is not serving them well, several components must be inplace. In order to unravel a toxic conditioned pattern and replace it with anourishing one, you will need to systematically reinforce the transformationwith your thoughts and choices. There are four critical steps to relinquishingsomething toxic in your life.THE INTENTION TO DETOXIFYThe first important step is to form a clear and strong intention. If you are notconvinced that your life will be better as a result of eliminating somethingtoxic, you will not have the motivation or will to make the change. It is bestto formulate your intention in a positive rather than a negative way. If youwant to stop smoking, state your intention as “I want to breathe more easily andfeel comfortable in my body without the need for tobacco,” rather than “I needto get rid of these horrible cigarettes from my life.” If your desire is to stopdrinking alcohol, formulate the intention that you wish to feel safe andcentered without the need for self-medication. If you want to lose weight,formulate the intention that you want a healthy, fit body. Create a clear visionof how your life will be better as a result of letting go of the toxin. If youare struggling with an addiction that you have the clear intention to release,try the “Envisioning Wholeness” process on the next page.If you are habitually consuming a toxic substance that you know is not servingyou well, make the commitment now to release it. Form a clear intention andreinforce your affirmations:image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_109_r1.jpg]I commit to releasing ______ from my life, once and forever.Without ______ in my life,I look and feel a healthy _____ years old. Throughout the day, practice your affirmation and the envisioning of your lifefree from the toxic habit until your body/mind is spontaneously resonating withthis vision for your life. Develop a clear vision of your new reality and createit through all your daily choices.Envisioning WholenessSit comfortably, close your eyes, and for several minutes quiet your innerdialogue through meditation. If you have not been instructed in Primordial SoundMeditation, practice the breathing awareness meditation as described in Chapter3. Now, begin to envision your life free from the negative effects of thelife-damaging habit. Imagine your home and work environment, unencumbered by theaddiction. Picture how your body looks, smells, and feels free from the toxiceffects of the dependency. Imagine the nourishing relationships with yourfriends and loved ones. Experience on the screen of your consciousness thevitality, comfort, and sense of competence you have, liberated from the negativepattern that is impacting your life. Allow this vision of wholeness to permeateevery cell in your body.PRACTICE MINDFULNESSThe second step is to turn the toxic behavior into a mindful meditation. Thismeans shifting into a mode of witnessing awareness while you are performing theaction. If you want to eliminate smoking, focus your full attention on theaction. Sit quietly and observe yourself as you slowly reach for your pack,remove a cigarette, light up, and inhale. Feel the sensations in your body andstop when your need has been fulfilled.Very few people actually enjoy their first smoke or taste of whiskey, whichreflects the inherent wisdom of the body. It is only after you have overriddenyour body’s signals with false mental messages—“I look cool when I smoke.”“Drinking alcohol makes me grown-up.” “Doing drugs is hip.”—that yourphysiological impulses stop being sent. In its effort to conserve energy, if wedo not heed our internal signals, the body stops sending them. Performing thehabitual action with “beginner’s awareness” will help you experience the honesteffects of the substance.SYSTEMICALLY DETOXIFYThe third step is to start a general detoxification program. Set a stop date anduse the opportunity to clear both your mind and body. Focusing on purificationwill help shorten the period of withdrawal discomfort and help your mind andbody shift into a healthier mode of functioning. Drink lots of fresh fruit andvegetable juices during this time. Try fruit juices in the morning, mixed fruitand vegetable juices during the day, and vegetable juices and blended vegetablesoups in the evening. We often recommend gingerroot tea, prepared by adding oneteaspoon of freshly grated root to a pint of hot water. Simplify your diet for afew days, favoring whole grains, steamed vegetables, and lentil soups. Take hotbaths or go to a sauna or steam room to encourage the removal of toxins throughyour skin. Spend at least some time every day walking in a park or along astream, lake, or ocean. Inhale fresh air, feel the sun on your face, and wiggleyour feet in the sand or grass. Directly connect with nature’s purifyinginfluence.This is a good time to start a healthy daily routine. Commit to meditating twicea day, getting to bed before 10:30 P.M. and rising at sunrise. Drink plenty ofwater. Begin a regular exercise program. Get some body work to help mobilize thetoxins from your body. Start a healthy diet. The more positive things youintroduce into your life, the easier it will be to eliminate whatever is toxic.PanchakarmaAyurveda recommends a total detoxification program known as Panchakarma, whichmeans the purifying actions. The full program as offered at the Chopra Centerprescribes a systematic process to identify, mobilize, and eliminate storedtoxins in the body. Luxurious oil massages are followed by heat treatments andthen some type of eliminative procedure to discharge toxins through thedigestive tract or nasal passages.You can perform a gentle detoxification program at home by following thesesteps:Follow a simplified diet for five days with plenty of steamed vegetables,grains, and lentil soup. Eliminate fried foods, fermented foods, dairy, animalproducts, and refined carbohydrates during this time.For three days eat sesame seeds and golden raisins to lubricate your digestivetract. Prepare a one-to-one mix of ⅛ cup of white sesame seeds and ⅛ cup ofgolden raisins. Ingest a teaspoon of the mixture one hour before or two hoursafter each meal. If you have any trouble digesting seeds, take ½ teaspoon ofsesame oil with three to four raisins three times a day.Drink plenty of gingerroot tea by grating one teaspoon of fresh gingerroot perpint of hot water and sipping it throughout the day. It is easiest if you get athermos bottle so you can keep the tea with you. Try drinking at least one literper day.On the evening of the fourth day, perform an oil massage (see pages 54–55) andsoak in a hot bath.Around ten P.M., take a teaspoon of yogurt with a dose of standardized sennaextract. We recommend Senokot. Most people will get a good elimination with fourtablets before bedtime. Expect a few loose bowel movements within the next sixto eight hours.Eat lightly the next day, gradually reintroducing more complex foods into yourdiet.REJUVENATIONThe final step is to fill the space previously occupied by the noxious substancewith something nourishing. We find the most important “thing” to fill theemptiness is the peace, comfort, and awareness that come from meditation. Whenpeople who have been indulging a life-damaging habit begin meditating, theyoften spontaneously lose their desire for the toxic experience. When someone whohas relinquished a toxic habit complains that they have started it up again, thefirst question we ask is “Are you still meditating?” Invariably the answer isno, often because their life was becoming so dynamic, their meditation timebecame a lower priority. Regularly accessing the quiet, expanded state ofawareness through meditation is an essential component of releasing noxioushabits.Other approaches that can be useful in filling the space left by the habitualbehavior include starting an exercise program, taking classes in a subject thatis fascinating to you, and dedicating yourself to healing your relationships. Itis sad how often a toxic behavior that compensates for a lack of love actuallyreduces the likelihood of finding genuine love. It can be very helpful to joinsupport groups of people who have gone or are going through the transformationyou are seeking. Associate with people who support your healthy choices andminimize your exposure to those looking to reinforce their toxic habits bydisparaging your efforts to change your life.The elimination of toxins awakensthe capacity for renewal. WATER—NATURE’S PURIFIERA very simple but powerful purification technique is to boost your intake ofwater. The human body is approximately three-fourths water and most biochemicalreactions operate best within a narrow window of concentration. Severalscientific studies have found that our sensitivity to thirst diminishes as weage, so we become at risk for developing subtle levels of dehydration of whichwe may not be consciously aware. Most people do not drink enough water, whichcan lead to a host of symptoms. Headaches, constipation, dry skin, fatigue, andindigestion may actually reflect subtle dehydration. Some physicians have goneas far as to suggest that many common health concerns, including high bloodpressure, asthma, and chronic pain have their origins in dehydration.Assuming that you do not have kidney or liver problems, we recommend gettinginto the habit of drinking water throughout the day. You can calculate therecommended number of ounces of daily water intake by dividing your weight inpounds by two.image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_110_r1.jpg]For example, if you weigh 160 pounds, your daily water intake should be 80ounces or 10 cups per day. Most bottled water comes in half-liter containers,equivalent to just over two cups, so this would mean drinking five bottles perday. Soda beverages, tea, and coffee do not count, as their caffeine content hasa diuretic effect. Similarly, alcohol also causes water loss and does notcontribute to rehydration. If you are active in sports, taking diuretics, orlive in a hot, dry climate, increase your daily intake by another 10 to 15percent. Favor water-rich fruits and vegetables including cantaloupe,grapefruit, peaches, watermelon, asparagus, peppers, carrots, and mushrooms.Minimize your intake of artificially sweetened beverages. When you are drinkingenough water you will feel the need to empty your bladder about every two hours.Many people who follow this water routine report that they more easily loseunwanted weight and have more energy and less chronic aches and pains. Drinkingplenty of fresh, pure water is one of the simplest and least expensive ways toreverse the aging process.ELIMINATE TOXIC FOODSFreshly grown and lovingly prepared foods are richest in Prana, or life energy.Foods that have been sitting around for months in a can on your shelf are lesslikely to nourish your body, mind, and spirit. Start a vegetable garden in yourbackyard and grow fresh herbs and spices to enhance your meals. Shop at yourlocal farmer’s markets and take the time to prepare delicious meals, applyingthe principles explored in Chapter 3. If you find yourself regularly eatingfrozen, canned, microwaved, or highly processed foods, shift your timepriorities to make nourishing yourself higher on your list. Make the preparationof meals a family or community experience so you can enjoy the process as wellas the product.There is increasing evidence that the pesticides and artificial fertilizers usedin modern agriculture are taking their toll on our health. These syntheticchemicals are finding their way into our air and water supply. They have beenimplicated as possibly contributing to a number of different cancers,particularly of the reproductive system.Studies have shown that it takes diligent washing to remove the pesticideresidues that are present on fruits and vegetables. For these reasons, weencourage you to favor organically grown foods. Although they cost more, you canfeel confident that you and your family are not consuming unnecessary toxinsalong with your meals. You will also know that you are doing your share toreduce the accumulation of toxins in your environment.RELEASE TOXIC EMOTIONSAlthough we are all aware of the health-depleting effects of toxic substancesand toxic foods, toxic emotions are often the most harmful accelerators of theaging process. Whenever you carry resentment, hostility, regret, or grievancesin your heart, your vitality is eroded. Try this simple practice:Find a quiet place, sit comfortably, and close your eyes.Now take a few minutes to settle your mind with the So Hum meditation.After a little while, bring your attention into your body and scan it for anyarea of tension or resistance. If you identify a place of congestion, have theintention to let it go.Bring your attention into your heart and acknowledge all the things for whichyou feel grateful.Now listen to your heart and ask yourself the question, “What am I carrying withme from the past that is no longer serving me well in the present?”If you identify any encumbrances in your heart, have the intention to releasethem now. Let go of any resentments, grievances, or regrets that you find.As you release these toxic emotions, see if you can find the gift that thistoxic emotion was hiding. For example, if you felt pain as a result of someone’sbehavior, the gift may be that you learned more self-reliance.Make the commitment to regularly acknowledge gratitude and relinquish allgrievances from your heart.Encumbering your heart with toxic emotions prevents you from fully experiencingthe magic, mystery, and joy that is available to you right now. Make thecommitment to release the resentments, regrets, and grievances that are causingmore harm to you than anyone else.The process of releasing emotional toxins is similar to that for releasingphysical ones. You must first have a clear intention that you want to replacelife-depleting emotions with life-enhancing ones. The metabolism of regret andresentment into compassion and forgiveness can dramatically awaken your body,mind, and spirit to your primordial vital energy.Write about the history that created the toxic emotion, describing both whathappened and how you feel as a result of the situation. Studies have shown thatjournaling about upsetting emotional experiences can improve your immunefunction, as well as help you gain clarity and insight. In his book NonviolentCommunication, psychologist Marshall Rosenberg teaches an emotional vocabularythat avoids victimization. Steer clear from words like abandoned, abused,neglected, and mistreated; instead, describe the actual feelings of anger,sadness, loneliness, and fear that the circumstance evoked.Once you have written about the circumstances leading to the toxic emotions,perform some physical ritual with the intention of releasing the hold thesefeeling have on your soul. Do some deep breathing, get a massage, pound apillow, dance with abandon, or go for a long run until your body has releasedthe tension that is stored with the emotion. Then, open your heart to feelingsthat generate the age-reversing emotions of forgiveness, harmony, laughter, andlove rather than the entropy evoking ones of anguish, resentment, regret, anddespair.Toxic emotions are often the most harmful acceleratorsof the aging process. Commit to releasing themfrom your heart and mind. Transform or Release Toxic RelationshipsYou may, at times, find yourself in relationships that are laced with conflict.Although you may enjoy the passion and drama these relationships generate, overtime, they will inevitably make you feel older and depleted. It is essentialthat you transform toxic relationships into nourishing ones. If you accept thatreality is a selective act of perception and interpretation, the most empoweringway to transform a relationship is to change the way you view the other person.Every relationship is a mirror that can show you some aspect of yourself. Whenyou are engaged in conflict, ask yourself, “What is this situation telling meabout my own nature?” Try this simple exercise that can be helpful in revealingthe hidden meaning in a difficult relationship.Write down as many traits as you can think of that describe the person with whomyou are having problems.image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_111_r1.jpg]Now look again at each descriptive word and see which ones create an emotionalcharge in you. For example, you may have described your manager as:image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_112_r1.jpg]As you review your list, you may see traits that really irritate you:controlling, needy, unappreciative, and stubborn. Now look at yourself. Arethese words that others might use to describe you? Do you have the tendency toreflect these traits? Have you expressed these qualities in the past? More oftenthan not, the traits that bother you the most in another person are the ones youtry hardest to deny in yourself. As you embrace these darker qualities in yourown heart, you may find yourself less inclined to judge someone else forexpressing them. As you relinquish your judgment and interpretation, you mayopen to the possibility that there are other qualities that may be attractive inthe person, which you have not allowed yourself to see.MEETING YOUR NEEDSRelationships thrive when both parties feel their needs are being met andstruggle when they are not. Put very simply: You feel good when your needs arebeing met and bad when they are not. Not getting your needs met leads to stress,toxic emotions, and toxic relationships. Learning to express your needs andemotions in a healthy way fosters nourishing relationships and reverses aging.As infants, we expect our caregivers to fulfill our needs, even if we don’t knowwhat they are. We wail a few times and anticipate Mother scrambling to determineif we are hungry, cold, tired, bored, or just want to be held. We carry thesesame desires into adulthood and become hurt, frustrated, angry, or depressedwhen our lovers, friends, or associates are unable to immediately figure outwhat we need and give it to us. This is not an approach that is likely to besuccessful. Let’s explore a more effective way to express your needs andemotions.THE DIALOGUE OF NEEDSThe humanistic psychologist Abraham Maslow described five basic needs that driveus all. First, we have basic physiological needs, such as food, water, andprotection against extreme heat or cold. Once these needs are met we aremotivated by the need for safety and security. We all want to feel protectedfrom physical and emotional harm. The third need is social—the need forcommunity, friendship, love, and belonging. As these needs are met we have theneed for self-esteem. At this level, achievement, respect, recognition, andstatus are sought. The final need is to find meaning, beauty, and wisdom inlife. Maslow called this final step self-actualization. In Eastern traditionsthis is the state of enlightenment.Self-actualized people are accepting, spontaneous, natural, and simple. They arededicated to a life of meaning and creativity. They are as comfortable alone asthey are in intimate personal relationships. They are playful and laugh easily.They know how to meet their needs.In his book Nonviolent Communication, Marshall Rosenberg describes a simpleprocess to enhance the chances of getting your needs met. Whenever your needsare not met and you become upset, first ask yourself, “What am I observing?”Rather than saying to the other person “You are always late to every date,” say“We agreed to meet at noon and you did not arrive until 12:30 P.M.” Separateyour judgments and evaluation from your observations and you will be less likelyto trigger defensiveness.The second step is to identify what you are feeling. Develop a rich emotionalvocabulary that does not make you a victim. Avoid words that require someoneelse to be there for you to experience your emotions, such as ignored, rejected,neglected, abandoned, or abused. You are empowered when you say you feelalarmed, annoyed, exhausted, frightened, lonely, outraged, or sad, but you giveaway your power when you use the vocabulary of the victim.The third step is to determine what you actually need from the situation. If youcannot be clear on what your needs are, it’s very unlikely that the other personis in a better position to figure it out.The fourth step is to formulate a specific request. Ask for what you need asspecifically as possible. Rather than demanding “You need to spend more timewith me or else!,” rephrase it in the form of a request: “Are you willing tocome home an hour early from work Wednesday afternoon so we can take a walktogether?” People are much more likely to respond to a request than a demand.We would add a fifth step to Dr. Rosenberg’s original four. Whether your requestis met or not, ask yourself, what is the gift in this situation? What can youlearn from this circumstance about yourself and life? What is the lesson thatcan raise you to a higher level of awareness? Find the gift, even if it is notthe one you originally anticipated.Make the commitment to communicate your needs consciously, and you will waste alot less energy in conflict. Accept your differences as a cause of celebration,rather than finding it necessary to make the other person wrong. Because webelieve that cultivating loving relationships is such an important component ofreversing the aging process, we devote an entire step to it in Chapter 10.Accept your differences as a cause of celebration.Release Toxic WorkMost people spend a good portion of their life on the job. So ideally workshould afford the opportunity to express your creativity, to interactmeaningfully with your coworkers, and to provide the material security you seek.Unfortunately, many people find their workplace to be a source of stress ratherthan fulfillment, and consequently, aging is accelerated rather than reversed.The world would be a better place if we all could do what made us happy, whileexpressing our unique talents in service to others and ourselves. According toAyurveda, this is the state of living in dharma, or fulfilling your purpose inlife. Even if you are not able to earn a living doing exactly what you likedoing best, see if you can bring some aliveness to your workplace.Try connecting more openly with your coworkers so your work environment isemotionally healthier.Observe your environment and see if you can improve the sounds, sights, orsmells that surround you.Look for opportunities to align your work with your values, needs, and beliefs.Life is precious and you have the right to perform work that is meaningful. Atest to see if you are in your dharma is to notice how often you look at thetime. If your inner dialogue tells you that time is creeping by very slowly andyou cannot wait to get off work, you are probably not in a position that isfully expressing your purpose in life. If, on the other hand, you find that timeflies while you are engaged, it is a good clue that this work is the type thatcan help you grow younger. Listen to the signals that your body and mind arecommunicating and commit to spending your day creating greater fulfillment foryou and those in your life.Reversing the Appearance of AgingThe field of energy, information, and intelligence commonly known as the skin isyour largest and most adaptable organ. As the boundary zone between your innerand outer worlds, the skin protects your tissues, cells, and molecules from theonslaught of microorganisms, temperature extremes, ultraviolet and infraredradiation, and chemical pollutants present in your environment. It constantlymonitors stimuli from your surroundings through its innumerable touch,temperature, and pain receptors, and sends this information to your brain on amoment-to-moment basis. Your soft pliant skin has the remarkable ability todifferentiate itself into the long strands of your hair or your flat hard nailsby rearranging its collagen molecules. It is the site of vitamin D activation,crucial for maintaining strong bones. The skin contains sweat glands, oilglands, fat cells, nerve fibers, immune cells, and miles of blood vessels and isessential in your regulation of body temperature and hydration. The skin isliterally your face to the world.Following a few basic skin care principles can reverse the appearance of aging.There are three important steps you must take as part of an age-reversing skincare program: (1) purify, (2) revitalize, and (3) replenish.PURIFYYour skin reflects the purity of your entire body. The principles of a healthydiet, nutritional supplementation, and detoxification will pay their rewards inthe quality of your skin. In addition to generally healthy lifestyle choices,you must carefully clean your skin once or twice daily to remove local toxinsthat block your skin pores and predispose you to infections.It is generally best to avoid soaps that contain harsh detergents and to usenatural cleansers. Ayurveda recommends the use of herbal cleansing powders thatremove toxins and excessive oils while reestablishing acid-base balance. Aneasily mixed formula that you can make at home includes equal parts driedchickpea flour, dry milk powder, nutmeg, lemon peel, and ground coriander. Useabout half a teaspoon with water to make a paste and gently apply it to yourmoistened face. As it begins to dry, rinse off the powder.If you wish to experiment with traditional Ayurvedic cleansing herbs, try addingneem, manjistha, or sandalwood powder. A basic principle regarding the cleansingproduct is not to use anything on your skin that you wouldn’t be comfortableputting into your stomach.Moist herbalized steam treatments are also helpful in opening clogged pores andreleasing toxins. Once a week, treat yourself to a facial steam bath to whichyou add a few drops of essential oil. Lavender, juniper, rosemary, bergamot, orsage all have purifying effects on the body.REVITALIZEThe second step to reverse the appearance of aging is skin revitalization.Stimulating the collagen fibers that support the skin can improve its tone andappearance. Many modern skin care products contain natural acids that stimulatethe cells that produce collagen, such as glycolic acid, azelaic acid, and lacticacid. Skin care products with these acids in higher concentration will causesome peeling and should be used under the supervision of a skilled skin carespecialist. Milder revitalizing treatments can be applied at home using readilyavailable natural products.Yogurt, lemon juice, and grapefruit juice can have a mild stimulating effect.Fresh yogurt can be applied directly to your skin and left on for five minutesbefore rinsing. Dilute lemon juice or grapefruit juice with an equal part ofaloe vera juice and apply to the skin. Leave on for two minutes and then rinse.If your skin is oily, you can do this every day. If your skin tends to be dry orreactive, dilute the solution further and use every second or third day.REPLENISHAfter cleansing and revitalizing, the skin needs to be replenished. Use a purevegetable or nut oil to which a few drops of an essential flower or herb oil hasbeen added. Try mixing almond, jojoba, avocado, or sunflower oil with rose,lavender, sandalwood, jasmine, geranium, or lemon essential oils. Apply a smallamount and allow it to be absorbed naturally. Use more if your skin is on thedry side. Source books on natural beauty care are listed in the references forthis chapter.SUN PROTECTIONAlways use sunscreen when you are outdoors. Ultraviolet radiation leads tocollagen damage, wrinkling, and skin cancer. Prevention is much better thancure, so be aware of the potentially damaging effects of sun on your skin. Thisis particularly important if you live in a hot climate or at higher altitudes.Teach your children to use sunscreen to prevent unnecessary skin problems laterin their lives.Every day in every way,I am increasing my mental and physical capacity.My Biostat is set at a healthy ____ years of age.I look and feel a healthy ____ years old.I am reversing my biological age:By changing my perception of my body, its aging and time;Through two kinds of deep rest—restful awareness and restful sleep;By nurturing my body through healthy foods;By using nutritional complements wisely;By enhancing mind/body integration;Through exercise; andBy eliminating toxins from my life.image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_113_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_114_r1.jpg]9image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_115_r1.jpg]You Can Reverse YourBiological Age by CultivatingFlexibility and Creativityin Consciousness ACTION STEP # 8I am reversing my biological age by cultivating flexibility and creativity in myconsciousness.I put flexibility into practice by:Learning to let go when things don’t seem to go my way.Practicing the wisdom of uncertainty—not being attached to outcome and lettinggo of the need to control.Learning to forgive by relinquishing grievances, resentments,and regrets.I put creativity into practice by:Learning the nine-step creative response.Applying the creative response to all the challenges and/or problems in my life.Helping others to solve their problems by teaching them the creative response.image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_116_r1.jpg]Aging is associated with rigidity and decay.Youth is associated with flexibility and creativity.Both flexibility and creativity are learned behaviors.By cultivating flexibility and creativity in consciousness,you renew yourself in every moment andreverse the aging process.An ancient Vedic aphorism says,“Infinite flexibility and creativityare the secrets to immortality.” image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_117_r1.jpg]image [images/Chop_9780307420817_epub_118_r1.jpg]You can reverse your biological age by cultivating flexibility and creativity inconsciousness. When we consider growing older we usually think of becoming lessflexible and creative. Our language of aging reflects this view. We useexpressions like “You can’t teach an old dog new tricks,” or “I’m too old tochange,” or “He’s just too set in his ways.” In both modern and Vedic sciences,the loss of flexibility and creativity is a result of increasing inertia,entropy, and disorder in the body/mind system.According to Vedic theory there are three fundamental forces at work in theuniverse: Sattwa, Rajas, and Tamas. Sattwa is the force of creativity,evolution, and transformation. Tamas is the force of stability, resistance, andinertia. Rajas is the tension between the forces of creativity and inertia. Aschildren and adolescents we are dominated by change, flexibility, and creativityand have a preponderance of natural Sattwa. Our brains and our behavior reflectour tremendous capability to expand, adapt, transform, and evolve and ourwillingness and desire to experience and learn new things. As adults we see therise of Rajas. This is a result of the everyday stresses of life and ourattachment to outcomes, as we seek to prove ourselves in the world. As we age webecome increasingly concerned about security and stability and Tamas begins topredominate. This stability is reflected in our behaviors and in the connectionsbetween the neurons in our brains. Stability leads to stagnation, stagnationleads to decay, decay leads to disorder and entropy, and ultimately to death.Death is the soul’s response to the loss of flexibility. When your physiologyhas lost the flexibility and creativity to further integrate the energy andinformation of your life experiences, the soul goes into incubation. Accordingto Vedic wisdom, when the soul needs to digest the experiences of a lifetime, itfirst incubates and then takes a quantum leap into a new context and a newbody/mind. In Eastern wisdom traditions this is the process ofreincarnation—incarnating into a new life experience.Rather than waiting for death to take a quantum leap into a new life experience,why not take the quantum leap while you are alive? This way you can incarnate(literally reincarnate) on an ongoing basis. This requires learning two basicand fundamental behavior patterns: (1) flexibility, which comes from letting go,and (2) creativity,which involves intention, incubation, and incarnation. Bylearning to incorporate flexibility and creativity as your evolving behavioralpattern, you will master on a daily basis what most people have to literally diefor—to incarnate and create a new body/ mind. Let’s explore these two qualitiesthat are the foundation of eternal youth.By cultivating flexibility and creativity in consciousness,you renew yourself in every moment and reverse theaging process. FlexibilityThe essence of flexibility is the willingness to let go. Surveys of centenarians(people who have lived at least one hundred years) often ask, “What do youbelieve are the reasons that account for your long and healthy life? Is it yourdiet? Have you been exercising your whole life? Have you avoided tobacco? Do youdrink alcohol?” The intent of these questions, of course, is to identify commonprinciples that could help us all live longer, healthier lives. Surprisingly,none of these questions clearly reveals the secret to longevity. The most commonexplanation that our most senior citizens offer for their long life is theirability to let go.Long-living people have flexibility and resiliency when facing the inevitablechallenges in life. If you live to be a hundred years old, chances are good youhave experienced challenges and losses, yet these super seniors have been ableto move through adversity and get on with their lives. They relinquish theirhold on experiences that do not serve them. They let go and move on.From an Ayurvedic perspective, this ability to deal with what is happening butnot incur residual damage is a symptom of strong digestive power, known inSanskrit as Agni. The expression “digestive power” is applied not just to theability to digest foods but to digest all experiences in life. Agni is the rootof the English word ignite, referring to the power of fire to metabolize things.When your digestive force is powerful, you are capable of extracting thenourishment you need from any experience and eliminating whatever is not servingyou. A strong Agni enables you to digest what life presents without carryingunprocessed residues, which inhibit your ability to fully embrace life. A strongdigestive power is an essential feature of people who live long, vital lives.Learning to let go is necessary because life is a process of continual changeand transformation. Attempting to stop change by holding on is fighting thenatural force of evolution. Ultimately, nature will have its way, and yourstruggle against the river of life will exact its toll on your physiology. Thewear and tear born of resistance accelerates aging. Relinquishing yourresistance and embracing change reverses aging.Learning to let go does not mean relinquishing your intentions. Your intentionsand desires orchestrate the course of your life and catalyze the experiences youneed to evolve to higher levels of awareness. Flexibility does not requireletting go of intentions. Flexibility does, however, require letting go of yourattachment to a specific outcome. You cannot control the outcome of a situation,and holding rigidly to your idea about how things should be leads to strain,stress, and aging. Whenever it appears that your intended outcome is not the onemanifesting, bear in mind the following expression, which we heard from aspiritual teacher:When things don’t seem to go my way, I let go of myattachment to how I think they should be, trusting thatI am not seeing the big picture. If I knew the big pictureI would understand that there is a reason for thingsunfolding the way they are, and that the cosmos has aplan for me much grander than anything I have conceived. Letting go and detaching from outcome is the essence of genuine power and offersthe only real possibility of security. Detachment from a particular outcomederives from trust in the intelligence of the universe and your connection toit. It implies a willingness to step into the unknown—the field of allpossibilities. This is the real meaning of flexibility. Attachment to the knownis attachment to the past. The past is stability. The past is inertia. The pastis entropy. The past is stagnation. Attachment to the known—attachment to thepast—accelerates aging.Most people spend their entire lives seeking security through their attachments.Attachments are usually to positions and possessions. Because these attachmentsrarely bring security or happiness, people often believe their problem is thatthey need greater positions or more possessions. The internal conversationsounds like this: “If I just had more money . . . if I just had a better job . .. if I just had a more passionate relationship . . . then I would feel secureand happy.” Money, positions, possession, and titles are symbols of security.Symbols of security cannot substitute for real security, which can only comefrom within.Paradoxically, finding genuine and lasting security comes from surrendering tothe wisdom of uncertainty. It means cultivating an inner attitude of curiosityand acceptance. It means detaching from a particular outcome and developing themind-set that whatever occurs is the most evolutionary outcome at the time. Thisstate of flexibility, in which you are able to embrace the unknown and detachfrom a particular outcome, reverses the aging process.Relinquishing your resistance and embracing changereverses aging. PRESENT-MOMENT AWARENESSThe Buddhists have an expression: “Nothing should be clung to as me or mine.”Nothing you identify with can really be called yours. Although you may considerthe physical vehicle you inhabit as your body, you know by now that every atomcomprising it is only on temporary loan from your environment. Within a year,almost every atom that you currently call yours will no longer be within theboundaries of your skin. Your thoughts are not really your thoughts. They arepart of the collective mind. A hundred years ago, you could not have had thethought “I am flying on a 747 jet to Las Vegas,” because these concepts were notyet a part of the collective mind. Your emotions are not your emotions. Everyemotion you have ever had—elation, despair, joy, frustration, ecstasy,jealousy—has been experienced by people since the beginning of humanity. Not asingle molecule, not a single thought, not a single emotion you have ever had isuniquely yours. You are part of a larger scheme. You are woven from a fewstrands in the infinite cosmic web of energy, transformation, and intelligence.“Nothing should be clung to as me or mine.” Underlying this prescription is therecognition that all stress in life results from either grasping or aversion.When you hold on to anything, be it a material object, a position, or arelationship, you constrict your awareness and accelerate aging. You accelerateaging because, at a subtle level, every attachment is accompanied by fear—fearof loss, fear of losing control, fear of losing approval. When you evoke fearyou set into motion the physiology of stress that accelerates biological aging.You must let go of this fear in order to reverse aging.The inclination of the mind is to lean toward something that you hope will bringpleasure or away from something that you fear will bring pain. As a result ofthis tendency, of this inclination, you are unable to remain in the presentmoment.When you find yourself out of the present moment, ask yourself, “What is wrongwith this moment?” You will see that there are only two possibilities: eitheryou are resisting it or you are just not in it. If you are resisting it,consciously surrender to the here and now. If you are just not in it, gentlybring yourself back to the present. Open yourself to the infinite possibilitiesthat the present moment offers.You can cultivate present-moment awareness through the practice of alertwitnessing—shifting your attention from that which is observed to the silentever-present witness to the observation. In the midst of observation, come backto the self.Your observations change on a moment-to-moment basis. If you identify who youare with your observations, your identity has no permanence. It becomes amoment-to-moment fabrication. When you identify yourself with the objects ofyour perception, which are in constant flux, you sacrifice your true self forthe objects of your self-image. If you identify yourself as the president of acompany, as the owner of a luxury car, as the manager of an artist or musician,your sense of self is dependent upon an external source. This is sometimes knownas agency power because your power derives from attachment to an externalagency, be it an organization, bank account, or relationship. The problem withagency power is that when the attachment ends, so does the power and your senseof self.The opposite of agency power is self-power, which comes from your innerconnection to Spirit. Underlying all your observations and experiences in life,underlying all your attachments to people, situations, and circumstances, is adomain of ever-present witnessing awareness. This is your true self; this isyour Spirit.In alert witnessing you shift your attention from goal orientation to processorientation. You become completely flexible. You are unattached to outcome. Youare comfortable in the realm of uncertainty. When Spirit is your internalreference point you neither anticipate nor resist—you simply allow. When youwalk a certain road, you have the intention to reach a particular destination,but if more interesting opportunities present themselves along the way, thenhave the flexible inner attitude to go with the flow. This process can be summedup in one statement, “Take it as it comes.” The process becomes the goal.Whenever you find yourself grasping or recoiling, anticipating or resisting,shift your attention to your witnessing self. In this simple process of comingback to the self, you return to the present moment. The present moment is thedoorway to the field of infinite possibilities. The present moment ischaracterized by infinite flexibility. Living in present-moment awarenessreverses the aging process.When you evoke fear you set into motion the physiologyof stress that accelerates biological aging. You mustlet go of this fear in order to reverse aging. FORGIVENESSThe great Vedic scholar Eknath Easwawan tells a poignant story. At the end of alifetime, a person’s soul goes to a plane of existence where each life isreviewed. The soul enters a theater in which a movie of the recent life isplaying. The soul begins watching the movie but often has to turn away becauseof terribly uncomfortable scenes. Sins of omission and sins of commission crampthe heart, and the scene becomes too painful to watch. As a result of not beingable to watch the complete movie, important life lessons are missed, and thesoul must reincarnate to learn them in the next lifetime.According to this story, the primary cause for not being able to watch thepainful scenes of life is a lack of forgiveness—for others and for oneself.Forgiveness is the essence of letting go. It means relinquishing attachments tothe past and clearing encumbrances that constrict the heart. These constrictionsare the source of inertia, entropy, and aging. Release them to grow younger. Trythis simple exercise:Close your eyes, bring your attention into your heart and ask if you are holdingon to any grievances, hostilities, resentments, or regrets. If any come to mind,ask what occurred that led to the blockage in your heart. Then, ask what needsto occur now in order to release these toxins. Look for the gift that every lifeexperience offers, even painful ones, and express your gratitude for theexperience.Remember this beautiful expression from A Course in Miracles and refer to itoften: “Every decision I make is a choice between a grievance and a miracle.”We encourage you to choose a miracle. When things do not go the way you thinkthey should, you could indulge in self-pity. You could complain and gripe thatlife isn’t fair. You could lament about what you are not getting and makeyourself and everyone around you miserable. Or you could see the situation asanother opportunity for surrender, flexibility, and expansion. Grievances,hostilities, resentments, and regrets become festering emotional wounds thataccelerate aging. Forgive and forget and you will reverse the aging process.BREAKING HABITUAL PATTERNSIt’s easy to become trapped in habitual patterns that do not serve you well andpromote inflexibility. Therefore it is very helpful to consciously cultivateflexibility by relinquishing things in your life and creating new patterns ofthinking and behaving. Practicing flexibility creates flexibility in yournervous system by challenging your brain cells to make new associations. Theneurons in your nervous system and the choices in your life are engaged in acontinuous feedback loop. In your willingness to try new things, your neuralnetworks become more flexible and open to new perceptions, interpretations, andchoices, which in turn support new interneuronal connections.Here are a few suggestions of things you can do to break out of your habitualbehavioral patterns. Try them for a week and observe what happens to your bodyand mind.Change your dietChange your exercise programChange your route to workChange your bedtimeMeditate longerBuy different clothingWear new colorsListen to different kinds of musicStop wearing a watchWear your watch on the other wristGo out to lunch with someone newTry a new restaurantChange your opinion about something or someoneCall a friend you haven’t spoken to in yearsAnswer the phone differentlyChange your voice mail messageRead a book that you usually wouldn’t considerWatch a different television showListen to a different radio stationTake a new classLet go of old ways and you will feel renewed. Learning to be flexible meanslearning to access the most flexible domain of your being— the field of timelessawareness underlying your mind and body. This realm of flexibility is the basisof growing younger. Immerse yourself in this field of infinite flexibility on adaily basis through meditation. Have the conscious intention to think and actflexibly. Practice letting go whenever holding on is no longer serving you.CreativityOnce you have cultivated flexibility you are ready for creativity. Withoutflexibility there can be no creativity. According to Amit Goswami, author ofQuantum Creativity, creativity is a discontinuous, nonalgorithmic quantum jumpfrom one pattern of thinking into a completely new one. It is a quantum leap—aparadigm shift— from one pattern to another without progressing throughincremental steps in between. All the great creative advances in the worlds ofart, music, architecture, or science represent new leaps of imagination thatcould not have been predicted on the basis of the prevailing patterns. Once thecreative leap is made, be it Einstein’s theory of relativity, Picasso’s cubism,or music by the Beatles, the world is forever changed.You are by nature a creative being, although you may no longer think of yourselfthis way. As a child you had a rich imagination, which is the source of allcreativity. Your youthful flexibility and present-moment awareness allowed fornew perceptions and interpretations on an ongoing basis. You were capable ofcreating entire worlds with your imagination, whether it was building sandcastles at the beach or playing with your make-believe family of dolls. Today,the very fact that you are alive is evidence of your creativity, for you areco-creating your reality every moment. You are creating a new body/mind withevery impulse of experience and every breath you take. Learn to reawaken yourcreative response and you will recapture the energy and enthusiasm of youth. Inaddition to helping you grow younger, the creative process can be applied tohealing, relationships, the arts, and business.TAKING A CREATIVE LEAPCreativity is the process of taking the raw energy, information, and material ofthe universe and transforming it into something that has never been createdbefore. Whether you are creating an original work of art, a new piece of music,a unique software program, or a healing response to an illness, creativityrequires a leap in awareness. If you are improving on something that alreadyexists, that is innovation. Creativity brings something into existence that hasnever been here before.There are nine basic steps to the creative response. Become conscious of thesesteps and use the creative response whenever you are facing an issue orchallenge in your life. You have unlimited creative potential that can be usedto solve any problem you are facing.Intended OutcomeThe first step of the creative response is to have a clear intended outcome. Youmust have a clear vision of what it is that you want to have unfold. If you arenot certain about what you want, you are unlikely to fulfill your needs. Stateyour intended outcome in clear positive language: “I have a healthy body withabundant energy.” “My intimate relationships are loving and nurturing.” Avoiddefining your intentions in terms of what you don’t want. Rather than saying “Iwant to leave this dreadful job,” state your intention as “I have a positionthat enables me to express my full potential.”Write down your intentions and review them regularly to be certain that theyreflect your current desires. Although living in a state of flexibility impliesnot being attached to a particular outcome, it is still essential that you haveunambiguous intentions. Formulate a clear intention and be detached from theoutcome.Information GatheringThe second step is information gathering. In this stage, learn everything thatis available about the issue you are facing. Become an expert on the challengethat confronts you, recognizing that your particular variation is unique. Readbooks, do research, use the Internet, explore spiritual literature, go tolectures, participate in workshops, speak with friends and family. Gatherinformation from every possible source without judging or filtering. Payattention to the sensations in your body as you learn what others have to sayabout your issue, noting which approaches feel comfortable for you and whichfeel uncomfortable.Information Reshuffling and Information AnalysisAs you gather information, your mind will digest what you are learning,formatting the information in ways that are useful to you. This process ofinformation reshuffling takes place on both conscious and subconscious levels.The data is analyzed looking for patterns that can provide clues to a newunderstanding of the issue.IncubationThe fourth step is incubation. In incubation, you allow your awareness to settleinto a more expanded state of consciousness through meditation. Incubation isthe stage of surrender. Having formed your intention, gathered and reshuffledthe information you obtained, the next step is to go beyond the rational mindand access a deeper domain of awareness to orchestrate the fulfillment of yourintention. Use the So Hum meditation technique described in Chapter 3 to quietand expand your mind. Review your intention for a few moments before you beginmeditation and then let go. Letting go allows for something entirely new toarise in your awareness—something that you had not conceived of before.InsightWhen the conditions are right, you will experience the fifth step, which isinsight. Insight results from the rearranging of the previous relationships andmeanings into an entirely new context, which then allows for an entirely newinterpretation. Insight is the creative leap— your perception and interpretationof the issue completely shifts. This new inner vision is the essence of thecreative response. It precipitates from a domain of awareness that is nonlocal.The process of meditation allows you to enter into this nonlocal domain thatexists for eternity in the gaps between your thoughts. When you are able to gobeyond your ideas about how things should be, gaining access to this deeperdomain, something unprecedented emerges. This is insight.InspirationWhen the insight occurs, it spontaneously generates inspiration. The level ofenthusiasm that wells up when insight dawns is a good barometer that the insightis a real creative leap. When you really see things in a new light, your entiremind/body becomes energized. You know in your mind that your insight is true andyou feel in your body that the insight is right. Passion, exhilaration,excitement, joy, and enthusiasm are all signs that the insight that arose whileyou were incubating will solve your problem and fulfill your intention.Implementation, Integration, IncarnationIt is now your task to translate the insight into action. Now that you know whatis necessary to fulfill your intention, do it. Make the change, take the step,and implement the action to actualize the creative response. Integrate thechange into your life. As you integrate and implement the insight into yourthinking and behavior, you incarnate it in your body. It becomes a part of you,and as a result you are a new person. You have taken a creative leap and havebecome a new body/mind.Archimedes, the Archetypal Creative ResponseArchimedes was the greatest mathematician of his time. A third-century B.C.native of Syracuse, Sicily, he was asked by King Hiero to determine if the crownthat was made for him was of pure gold (Intention). Archimedes knew that if hecould calculate the density of the crown he would be able to determine if anyother metals had been added (Information gathering). He knew that density wasweight (mass) divided by volume. He could weigh the crown on a scale, but due toits irregular shape, he did not know how to find its precise volume. Afterconsidering this problem continuously for days (Information reshuffling), he wasconvinced by his servant to let the puzzle go for a little while and take a warmbath (Incubation). As he was lowering himself into the tub, he noticed that hisbody displaced an amount of water equal to his volume. This led to the idea(Insight) that he could calculate the density of the crown by determining howmuch water it displaced. He was so exuberant about his discovery (Inspiration)that legend has it he ran through the streets of Syracuse shouting “Eureka!,”which in Greek means “I’ve found it!” As it turned out, the metalsmith haddiluted the gold with silver.As an example of how this might work on a personal level, consider a woman whois in constant turmoil because her spouse is not meeting her expectations. Inher mind, he spends too much time alone or on the phone with friends andcolleagues. As a result of her distress and anxiety she has been eating more,gaining weight, and losing her self-esteem.She decides to apply this nine-step creative process by first formulating herintention, which is to feel secure, appreciated, and loved. She makes thecommitment to read several popular books on relationships and is exposed to anumber of new perspectives. She learns meditation, which she begins practicingregularly. During a particularly deep sitting, she has the insight that she hasreally been missing her friends, and her resentment stems from her husband’sexperiencing something that she would like for herself. She becomes inspired bythe idea and makes plans to visit an old college roommate in another town. Sheso enjoys the few days that her entire attitude about her life completelyshifts. She begins exercising and eating better and all her relationships,including her marriage, improve.By setting up the conditions that allowed her to experience a creative quantumleap, she was able to access life energy that was previously unavailable to her.This ability to experience new creative solutions to old problems is the essenceof flexibility and a key component of reversing the aging process.OPPORTUNITIES FOR CREATIVITYUse the nine-step process every time you perceive a problem or challenge in yourlife. See every challenge as an opportunity for creativity. When you see everyproblem as an opportunity to practice the creative responses, you will lookforward to and be excited by the challenges in your life.Help others to solve their problems by teaching them the creative response.Teach and use the creative response at work and in your home life. Teach yourchildren how to perceive their challenges as opportunities for creativity.Flexibility and creativity are the keys to evolutionary progress. Even inDarwinian terms, those who are able to adapt survive. Adaptation first requiresflexibility, then creativity. Every evolutionary jump is a quantum leap increativity. When you cultivate flexibility and practice the creative responseyou will notice how much younger, more flexible, and more adaptable you become.Every day in every way,I am increasing my mental and physical capacity.My Biostat is set at a healthy ____ years of age.I look and feel a healthy ____ years old.

Love is the essence of life.For human beings, love is as essential as food and water, and without it, wecannot survive. Love is not just a psychological experience; love transformsbiology. Mammalian babies from bunnies to chimpanzees fail to develop normallyif they are deprived of their mother’s love. Although we are not usuallyaccustomed to considering love in scientific terms, over the past twenty-fiveyears, scientific studies have provided indisputable evidence that theexperience of love has profound life-supporting effects on our physiology.Scientific studies show that by merely observing acts of compassion, yourimmunity is enhanced. David McClelland of Harvard University found that collegestudents increase their production of salivary antibodies when watching a filmof Mother Teresa comforting a child, whereas their antibody levels are depressedwhen watching war scenes. David Spiegel’s studies from Stanford University havetaught us that women facing metastatic cancer who participate in caring supportgroups live, on average, twice as long as those who do not. We know that mensuffering heart attacks who believe that their wives love them do better thanthose who don’t, and a simple monthly phone call from a caring cardiac nurse candouble the survival time of a heart patient. Even studies with animals havefound that tenderness and affection can reduce their risk for disease. In anintriguing study from Ohio State University, two groups of rabbits were fed ahigh-cholesterol diet. In one group the rabbits were regularly petted andcuddled by the animal technicians. Rabbits in the other group, fed the identicaldiet, did not receive any petting. At the completion of the study, the rabbitsthat were treated tenderly had only 10 percent as much fat deposited into theirblood vessels as their touch-deficient peers. Love is metabolized intophysiology and can make the difference between health and sickness, life anddeath.These scientific reports do not surprise most of us. We have all known theexuberance and vitality that we experience when we feel loved. Most of us alsoknow the anguish and despair that come from separation and rejection. Peoplesuffering the loss of love have changes in the chemistry of their brains thatinfluence every cell in their body. These changes substantially increase theirrisk for a wide range of illnesses, from cancer to heart disease. Similarly, theexhilaration, enthusiasm, and comfort generated by love create life-affirmingtransformations that enliven both emotional and physical well-being. Love makesus feel good because it creates the biology of delight, joy, and safety. Love ishealing, love is nourishing, love is good for us.Love transforms biology.What Is Love?Knowing that love transforms our physiology in the direction of improved healthand vitality, we are ready to address a fundamental question: What is love?Poets, philosophers, and songwriters since time immemorial have waxed eloquenton this perennial subject. No word in any language is embraced as personally aslove. It elicits in each of us a lifetime of memories and desires, weavingtogether the innocence and passion of our bodies, hearts, and souls.For most people, love is an emotion, a sentiment, a feeling that can consumeyour thoughts and molecules. Falling in love is an altered state ofconsciousness, in which your perceptions, interpretations, and choices aretransformed. When you are in love you become carefree and open to newexperiences. You become vulnerable and invincible at the same time. You becomerenewed, exhilarated, and joyful. Love detaches you from your usual mundane andtrivial concerns and opens your awareness to the magic and mystery of life. Lovereminds you that you are alive.Love inspires you to do great things. Through the power of love you tap intoyour primordial energies and become a mythical being. Lovers aspire to epicundertakings to demonstrate the power of their love. Love connects you witharchetypal lovers. You relish reenacting the recurrent love stories thatprecipitate out of the mythological realm of the human subconscious. Everyculture tells its love stories. From Cupid and Psyche to Rama and Sita to Romeoand Juliet to Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn, these romantic storiesreenact the hell of separation and the heaven of reunion that human beingsexperience through love. These perennial love stories are the keys that open thedoor to universal love.Personal Love as Concentrated Universal LoveThe great spiritual traditions from every culture inform us that unity is theultimate truth of all existence. The one undivided Spirit partitions itself intoinfinite beings. Once having fragmented, however, the parts are driven byfundamental forces to reestablish unity. Atoms endeavor to become molecules.Celestial bodies seek to join solar systems. Human beings strive to merge withtheir beloved. Love at its essence is the quest for spirit, and the longing forcommunion. The need to fulfill that longing for oneness resonates deep in ourpersonal and collective memory. Through all the striving to find fullnessoutside ourselves, we know at some preconscious level that the only true sourceof love is the infinite, unbounded ocean of spirit within our own being. Themore in touch with spirit we are, the more loving we feel and behave.Most people are not directly in tune with their spiritual essence. Therefore,Nature, in her compassion for human beings, has provided the opportunity for usto fall in love with each other. This provides us a glimpse of thetransformational power of spirit. Personal love provides us with a taste ofuniversal love, but despite how grand we feel when we are in love, it is notenough. We are eternally driven to experience more love, more intimacy, morewonder because our soul is driven to experience the ultimate reunion withspirit.When you recognize that love and spirit are the same, you will see your longingfor love as a hunger for more awareness, more communion, more connection withthe universal intelligence that underlies the world. Every act of love is an actof divinity, an expression of spirit.Make a commitment to see every act of love as an expression of spirit. A sweetlook from a child, giving money to a homeless person, helping a stranger changea flat tire, bringing a spouse flowers, volunteering at a hospital—each of theseacts is both personal and spiritual. They bring you greater joy by helpingexpand your concept of who you are. Every act of love loosens the shackle of egoimprisonment. Every act of love gives you a taste of spirit and brings you astep closer to integrating the timeless into time-bound existence. Love createsthe experience of present-moment eternity, and the more we experience eternitythe younger we grow. The deeper we tap into and express our core, which isspirit, the more loving and liberated we feel.Think about love. Talk about love. Seek out love. Encourage love. Commityourself to expressing love in every interaction of your life. This is the wayyour soul remembers its perfection. All lessons in life are lessons in love.Living a spiritual life means seeking out love in every situation. Make love themost important thing in your life and you will grow younger and live longer.Love at its essence is the quest for spirit.Communicating LoveLove is spirit in motion. Love moving from one heart to another generates thebiology that reverses aging. Love has to be expressed in order for it to serveyou and those you love. You can express your love for another person in threebasic ways:You listen attentively to what they are saying.You express in words or actions your appreciation for them.You touch them lovingly with affection.Each of these demonstrations of love happens spontaneously when you fall inlove. Look at any couple smitten with love. They hang on each other’s everyword. They wax poetic about the things they find attractive, brilliant, andexceptional in each other. They express their appreciation through objects oflove, from flowers to jewelry to homemade cookies. Finally, they cannot keeptheir hands off each other.Whether you are in the first stages of a new romance, have been in a committedrelationship for years, or are visiting an old friend from college, these threefaces of love are important. Show your love by being fully present. Express yourappreciation in words and deeds. Be affectionate. Consciously practice theseprinciples of love. As a result, you will grow younger and live longer.Love, Sex, and SpiritSexual energy is the primal creative energy of the universe, and all things thatare alive arise from sexual energy. In animals and other life forms, sexualenergy expresses itself exclusively as biological creativity. Animals beget moreanimals. In human beings, sexual energy can be channeled into creativity at alllevels—physical, emotional, and spiritual. In any situation that makes you feelattraction, arousal, alertness, passion, interest, inspiration, excitement,creativity, or enthusiasm, sexual energy is at work.All these different manifestations of sexual energy express themselves in yourphysical body as sensations. Whenever you are sexually aroused, there is anaccompanying feeling in your body. Whenever you feel enthusiastic, inspired,joyful, energized, or passionate, there is also an accompanying feeling—acertain physical sensation. The common thread in each of these experiences is afeeling of expansion. At times the expansive feeling may be so strong that youfeel you are bursting out of your skin. You are filled with energy. The medicalterm for this state of fullness is tumescence. Although it is usually applied tostates of sexual arousal, it can also characterize these other expressions ofexcitement and passion.Learn to get in touch with these sensations and recognize their variousexpressions in your body. Right now, close your eyes and recall an experiencewhen you were passionately aroused by something. It may have been a beautifulpiece of art, a breathtaking natural scene, or an emotionally moving piece ofmusic. Perhaps it was when a brilliant business idea came to you, or when youheard something that gave you amazing insight into a problem you were facing. Itmay have been an erotic, passionate sexual experience. Notice the sensationsthat your inspirational experience generates in your body. This is the essenceof sexual energy, which expresses itself in many different forms. Learn torecognize this powerful life force in all its manifestations.Even as you go about your daily life, pay attention to these experiences ofintense aliveness. They may be evoked by someone to whom you are intenselyattracted, by a spectacular splash of color in the sky at sunset, or by seeingthe beautiful, loving hands of your grand-mother. Be aware of the empoweringenergy that is available to you as a passionate lover of life. Nurture thesesensations with your attention until you feel a bubbling exuberance in everycell of your body. The more you look for and recognize these sensations in yourbody, the more your sensory experience will be one of heightened awareness, andthe more you will experience a simple, unaffected appreciation and gratitude forthe whole of creation. This is the essence of a spiritual life.Despite what you may have been conditioned to believe, sexual desire is sacredand virtuous. It is the suppression of sexual energy that is artificial,unnatural, and contrived. For many people, the experience of sexual intimacy istheir first glimpse into the experience of spirituality. When you and yourbeloved merge physically and emotionally, you go beyond the boundaries of theego. In this state of union you experience timelessness, naturalness,playfulness, and defenselessness. These are qualities of spirit when it is notconstrained by control, fear, or separation. Cultivating this state of naturalopenness and self-assured vulnerability in all relationships is the essence of aspiritual life.SEXUAL VITALITYSexual energy is available to us at all ages. Being open to sexual energyreverses aging. Although many people have the impression that sexual energydiminishes as we age, studies have shown that the vast majority of both men andwomen are sexually active through their sixties, seventies, and beyond. About 90percent of married men and women in their sixties and over 80 percent of men andwomen in their seventies are sexually active and find it enjoyable. Sexuality isa feature of intimate loving relationships throughout adult life.There are physiological changes associated with aging that looked at from oneangle can be viewed as a loss but from another perspective can be seen as anopportunity. Some men in their sixties and seventies take longer to becomephysically aroused. Some women need help compensating for tissue dryness that isassociated with diminished estrogen production. These issues can be easilyaddressed. Investing the time and attention to create physical, emotional, andspiritual intimacy can often result in the most fulfilling sexual experiences ofa person’s life.To improve your sexual experiences, you need to divest yourself of yourexpectations. Expectations are usually in three areas: (1) performance, asexemplified by the question “How am I doing?”; (2) emotions, as exemplified bythe question “How am I feeling?”; and (3) security, as exemplified by thequestion “Do you really love me?” These are understandable concerns whenexploring intimacy with your partner. They also provide a unique opportunity toexpress your vulnerabilities and create more intimacy. Intimacy derives from thewillingness to be vulnerable. Ask for what you need and give to your lover whathe or she needs. Openness, vulnerability, the willingness to give, and thereadiness to receive are all qualities of spirit.Relinquish your expectations. When you relinquish your expectations, you areable to release your resistance. Your resistance keeps you from enjoying what ishappening. In sex, as in all areas of life, resistance is born of fear. Allresistance is mental and derives from a judgment against what is being felt.Practice releasing your judgments and releasing your expectations and you willexperience the passion and surrender that sex offers. The concentrated passionof sexual lovemaking then permeates all other aspects of your life.If you find that sex is mixed with hidden emotions such as shame, guilt, oranger, commit to releasing these toxic and inhibiting feelings. Sexual intimacyis one road to the experience of true freedom, because it is one area of life inwhich you can become completely uninhibited and free. Sexual fulfillment occurswhen the experience comes from playfulness instead of need. When sex is used tofulfill needs, it leads to addiction. When sex comes from playfulness, theresult is ecstasy.Despite what you may have been conditioned to believe,sexual desire is sacred and virtuous. FOR PLAYSex is most enjoyable and creates the greatest amount of love and intimacy whenit is viewed as a process rather than as a goal. Western society is dominated bya goal-oriented worldview. Both men and women are conditioned to achievewhatever goal is established, as directly, quickly, and efficiently as possible.This attitude plays itself out in our lovemaking where we’ve learned to prizesexual climax as the sole target of physical intimacy. Although every loverrelishes the pleasure of orgasm, the ancient wisdom traditions of India andChina suggest that playing with sexual energy and extending the process oflovemaking expands the heart, mind, and spirit, while intensely enrichingphysical delight. Known as Tantra in India and the Tao of Sex in traditionalChinese culture, the basic principles for conscious lovemaking include ritual,communication, and finesse.RITUALIf you view sex as a sacred act, you will understand the value of ritual. Takethe time to prepare yourself for lovemaking as if you were journeying to a realmof celestial pleasure. Bathe yourself and prepare your body and mind for thesharing of your most personal gifts. Set the lovemaking scene with attention toall the senses. Read inspiring love poems to your partner. Play beautiful musicthat arouses your passions and opens your heart. (See appendix for ourrecommendations.) Wear sensual clothing, employ subtle lighting with candles,and diffuse pleasing aromas in the room. Look into your lover’s eyes andsilently or aloud acknowledge the gift of engaging intimately with your partner.When you consider sexuality as simply another physiological need, it only servesthat purpose. Recognizing that unlike your animal ancestors, you have theability to channel creative sexual energy to expand your heart and raise yourconsciousness, you can use rituals to focus your attention and intention.Transforming an exchange between two people from an act of pure biology to oneof body, mind, and spirit generates passion, vitality, and ecstasy.COMMUNICATIONCommunicate your feelings and needs to your partner, before, during, and aftersex. Express what brings you pleasure and what you need to feel safe, adored,and aroused. Reorient your intention from simply releasing sexual pressure tocelebrating the process. Prolonging the act of lovemaking has energy-enhancingeffects on mind and body. Inform your partner when you are about to climax andslow down the tempo to expand and prolong the pleasure. Lovemaking is a dance ofbody, mind, and soul that can continue twenty-four hours a day in physical,emotional, and spiritual domains.Sexual ecstasy is nourished through your willingness to be vulnerable. Askingfor what you need to fulfill your deepest desires and fantasies requires yourwillingness to be vulnerable. Through this vulnerability the boundaries between“I” and “thou” and between body and soul become blurred. This is the essence ofa spiritual experience and the promise of conscious lovemaking.FINESSELike meditation, lovemaking is a domain where force, effort, and control fail toresult in success and fulfillment. Subtlety, timing, and finesse are the essenceof rapturous lovemaking. The blossoming of sexual bliss requires total attentionin the present moment and openness to creativity. Sex can be a tool for personaltransformation when you listen to the signals from your body and the body ofyour lover and use them to surrender and release your resistance and fear.Lovemaking provides access to personal, collective, and universal domains ofawareness. Every loving couple is reenacting the perennial myths of love; everyloving couple is reenacting the reunion of souls. In Traditional ChineseMedicine, lovemaking is an opportunity for the primordial inward moving (yin)and outward moving (yang) forces to balance. In Ayurveda and Tantra, sexualunion is the personalized expression of the eternal dance between the impulsesof pure potentiality (Shiva) and creative expression (Shakti).True intimacy is union between flesh and flesh, between heart and heart, betweensoul and soul. Sexual energy is the creative energy of the universe. Sexualenergy is sacred energy. When we have restored the sexual experience to therealm of the sacred, our world becomes divine, holy, and healed.Through the vulnerability of sexual intimacy,the boundaries between “I” and “thou” andbetween body and soul become blurred. Ojas—the Essence of LoveYou have been using the mantra ojas in your daily ritual to perceive your bodyas a field of energy, transformation, and intelligence. This subtle substance isnourishing to your physical, emotional, and spiritual bodies. It provides theintegrating essence that unifies all aspects of your being.According to Ayurveda, we are born with a small reserve of ojas that can beaugmented or depleted as a result of nourishing or toxic experiences. Healthyfood, loving emotions, nurturing sensory impressions, rejuvenating herbs, andcreative use of sexual energy all contribute to more abundant ojas. Ojas remindsevery cell in the body of its primary directive to support the wholeness of themind/body network. It also strengthens your natural immunity. When ojas isdepleted you become susceptible to degenerative disorders including cancer.Therefore, protecting and increasing your supply of ojas is key to reversing theaging process.Ojas can be depleted by excessive release of reproductive fluid. This isimportant in men and forms the basis of the idea that as you age, reducing thefrequency of ejaculation can improve your vitality. This suggestion is not basedupon morality; rather, it is an expression of the conservation of energy. As ageneral principle, if you are male, see if you can increase the ratio of sexualexperiences to ejaculation. If you are accustomed to releasing sexual tensionevery time you have sex, see if you can go to an every other time pattern. Thentry going to every third time. Although at first you may feel some sense offrustration, you will most likely quickly begin to appreciate the enhancedenergy and passion that you feel throughout the day. If you are a woman, playwith your partner to keep his sexual energy aroused without immediatelyreleasing it. When lovers consciously direct their powerful sexual energy, theybecome more attractive to each other. All aspects of lovemaking, in and outsideof its sexual expression, become more ecstatic.Nutrition for OjasAccording to Ayurveda there are special foods and herbs that have distinctiveojas-enhancing effects. Fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, nuts(particularly almonds), honey, and dairy derived from well-cared-for cows areall enhancing to ojas. Substances depleting ojas include alcohol, tobacco,canned foods, highly processed foods, fried foods, and those containingartificial sweeteners. Make your healthier choices without being overlycompulsive or rigid. Compulsivity and rigidity deplete ojas. Simply be moreconscious of your choices so that to the extent possible, you increase the ojasin your life.HERBS AND OJASThere are many classical rejuvenative herbs from healing systems around theworld that can be considered ojas-enhancing. Ginseng from the Chinese and Koreansystems is the most popular herb in the world and has been classically used toaugment sexual potency. Scientific studies have suggested that ginseng canenhance sexual appetite and erectile function in both animals and men. It canenhance your general sense of well-being and vitality. Ginseng is available inmany forms including capsules, teas, and even chewing gum.Ayurveda has an entire branch of medicine dedicated to maintaining and regainingoptimal reproductive tissue. Known as Vajikarana, these herbs are sometimesreferred to as aphrodisiacs. Although you most likely think of an aphrodisiac assomething that arouses sexual desires, according to Ayurveda, these aphrodisiacherbs also improve your reproductive essence. In other words, they enhance ojas.The three most commonly recommended ojas-enhancing substances in Ayurveda areashwagandha, shatavari, and amalaki.Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera)Sometimes known as winter cherry, this potently fragrant herb has long beenknown as the primary masculine rejuvenating substance. Its Sanskrit name means“smelling like a stallion,” implying that it infuses the user with the power ofa horse. Although its long-standing reputation is as a sexual potency herb, mostresearch has focused on its stress-reducing and immune-enhancing properties. Arecent experiment with animals found that ashwagandha influences the pituitarychemicals that regulate sex hormones.Ayurveda recommends taking a teaspoon of ashwagandha in warm milk sweetened withhoney or brown sugar before bedtime. This is highly encouraged on days when theman has ejaculated, with the intention of helping to replenish lost ojas. It isequally valuable for women to enliven their passion and sexual ardor.Ashwagandha is now readily available from a number of herbal distributors in theWest.Shatavari (Asparagus racemosus)This wild form of asparagus is considered to be the feminine equivalent ofashwagandha in that it supports the nurturing, receptive, creative feminineenergy that both men and women possess. Not known for understatement, Ayurvedagives this nourishing plant the Sanskrit name shatavari, which can be translatedas “capable of supporting one hundred husbands.” It is a classical tonic withseveral indications including relief of premenstrual symptoms, enhancement ofmilk flow in breastfeeding mothers, and the smoothing of the transition throughmenopause. Scientific studies on shatavari have been limited to date, primarilylooking into its traditional role in relieving stomach upset and improvinglactation. Considering its long-standing history of value in strengthening awoman’s physiology, shatavari is worthy of further scientific exploration.Although most commonly recommended for women, shatavari is also considered avaluable tonic for men. Like ashwagandha, it is usually taken in hot milksweetened with honey or raw sugar. The combination of shatavari and ashwagandha(one teaspoon of each) in a cup of hot milk with a pinch of saffron and a littlehoney or brown sugar makes an excellent tonic for both men and women and is atraditional ojas restorer.Amalaki (Emblica officinalis)The powerful little fruit is one of nature’s most abundant sources ofantioxidants. Ounce per ounce, amalaki juice carries twenty times the vitamin Ccontent of orange juice. Amalaki is considered the most powerful generalAyurvedic tonic, beneficial for both men and women. It is most readily availablein the West in the form of an herbal jam that combines amalaki with a number ofother tonic herbs and spices.The mythology around this ancient rejuvenating substance describes an elderlysage, Chavan, who was asked by a king to marry his daughter. Chavan wasconcerned that he would not be able to satisfy the needs of his young bride, butin meditation cognized the herbal formula that would restore his youthfulvitality. This subsequently became know as Chavanprash or the jam of Chavan.Scientific research on amalaki has shown it to have measurable health-enhancingproperties, including the detoxification of carcinogens, protection of DNA,lowering of cholesterol levels and relief of heartburn. Amalaki-based herbaljams are becoming increasingly available in the West. We recommend a teaspoon ortwo each day as a natural, general ojas-enhancing tonic. Sources of ashwagandha,shatavari, and amalaki jam are listed in the appendix.When we have restored the sexual experienceto the realm of the sacred,our world becomes divine, holy, and healed. The Soul of LoveLove serves the soul. We learn our life lessons and awaken our memory ofwholeness through love. Our soul is the weaving of our memories and desires,providing the template for all our aspirations, choices, and experiences inlife. We can look at the soul as a confluence of contexts and meaning. Contextentails a set of relationships and meaning is the way we interpret therelationships. Our lives are a river of relationships and meaning.Each of us is continuously reenacting one of the perennial themes of love—trustand betrayal, unrequited love and forbidden lust, unconditional love andcalculating neediness. From Adam and Eve to Judas and Jesus, the most powerfulstories we tell each other across time and culture are love stories. Love is theprimal force on earth and beyond all the obvious and stated reasons, behindevery action is love. Striving for good grades in school, doing well in a job,creating a great work of art, composing a beautiful symphony, writing a greatnovel, winning the Nobel Prize—if you dig deeply enough you will see that allthese stories are love stories in disguise. In actuality, the only reason we doanything is for more love, although we may go to considerable lengths to concealour true motivations.Our discussion of love leads to a simple conclusion: For the benefit of yourphysical, emotional, and spiritual well-being, generate more love in your life.Each morning when you awaken, ask yourself, “How can I create more love today?How can I express more love today? How can I be open to receiving more lovetoday?” In every interaction ensure that some exchange of love takes place.Whether it is chatting with your landscaper, paying for your groceries, talkingwith your children or being intimate with your beloved, come from an innerdialogue of love. When you make love the most important thing in your life, yourmind and body resonate with the timeless.Every day in every way,I am increasing my mental and physical capacity.My Biostat is set at a healthy ____ years of age.I look and feel a healthy ____ years old.

The body is a field of molecules. Youcan touch it. It is solid. Even though it is constantly and ever in change andtransformation, it has the appearance of a fixed object, like a sculpture. Wecan examine the body, and measure its biological markers in a fairly precise,objective way. These biomarkers were discussed in Chapter 1.The mind on the other hand is not a field of molecules; it is a field of ideas.Ideas cannot be put in a test tube or observed through a microscope. They cannotbe examined in the traditional objective sense. Ideas can only be experiencedsubjectively. According to Ayurveda, the body is a field of information andenergy that we experience objectively, and the mind is the same field ofinformation and energy that we experience subjectively. There is a correlationbetween subjectivity and objectivity. Wherever a thought goes, a molecule goes.Spiritual traditions say that the word was made into flesh. In reality, the wordand the flesh are the same thing, much as physics tells us that particles andwaves are the same thing. The body is a collection of particles. The mind is acollection of waves. They are the same thing experienced differently, dependingon your method of observation—objective or subjective.Many studies have confirmed that biological age correlates better withpsychological age than chronological age. If you are young at heart, yourbiological markers are likely to reflect a young heart, literally. When yourheart is being attacked through hostility or lack of love, you might indeedsuffer a heart attack.It therefore becomes important to understand what creates a youthful mind,because a youthful mind is likely to translate into a youthful body. All thefactors we have discussed in the preceding chapters are, of course, veryimportant. However, if your mind is old, your body will reflect it even if youpractice everything that we have suggested so far in this book. A youthful mindis a mind that is constantly growing. As a popular saying goes, “People don’tgrow old. When they stop growing, they become old.”Neuroscientists are learning that the brain is an extraordinarily dynamic organthat is continuously reshaping itself. The cortex of the brain, which is lessthan one-quarter of an inch thick and covers only 350 square inches, containsover 20 billion neurons. Each of these brain cells has over 10,000 connectionswith other nerve cells throughout the brain. These connections are undergoingconstant transformation. The electrical, magnetic, and chemical fields of yourbrain are in perpetual flux, reflecting your moment-to-moment changingexperiences.Even the anatomy of your brain is being resculpted. Microscopic tendrilsconnecting one neuron with another are extending and retracting. The cellsthemselves are coming and going. The long-standing belief that adults nevergenerate new brain cells has been overturned. Recently, researchers at PrincetonUniversity have found evidence that thousands of fresh brain cells are bornevery day.Your experiences are ever changing. All experiences take place in the mind,which is notoriously nonstationary. The brain reflects this pliability. Attendto keeping your mind fresh and youthful, and you will keep your brain and yourbody fresh and youthful.The body is a field of information and energythat we experience objectively;the mind is the same field of information and energythat we experience subjectively. A Youthful MindA youthful mind is dynamic, vibrant, and curious. This is what we all desire—analert vibrant mind along with strong physical vitality. As a result of yourcommitment to the other steps in this program, you have set the stage for thisideal state. You have changed your perceptions and expectations about aging. Youare taking time on a daily basis to quiet your mind through meditation. You arelovingly nurturing your body with healthy food, nutritional complements,mind/body integration techniques, and balanced exercise. You are eliminatingtoxins from your body, mind, and soul. You are cultivating flexibility andcreativity in your consciousness, and you are making love the most importantthing in your life. With all these other key components in place, it isessential that you keep your mind active and expanding so you can enjoy thefruits of the life-affirming choices you’ve made and the life wisdom you haveaccumulated.A youthful mind has many vital qualities. It is enthusiastic, it is spontaneous,it is fluid, and it is adaptable. Observe a child at ease and you will see allthe qualities of a youthful mind in action. You have a youthful mind within younow. You simply need to allow its expression.ENTHUSIASMA youthful mind is an enthusiastic mind. The word enthusiasm comes from theGreek word entheos, meaning “filled with the divine.” A mind that is infusedwith the creative intelligence of the cosmos is a youthful mind. It isoverflowing with energy. The universe is born anew every moment, and a mind thatresonates with this energy sees the world with the wide-eyed enthusiasm of achild. Follow the advice of Lord Shiva who encourages you to “step out of theriver of memory and conditioning and see the world as if for the first time.”A youthful mind is a beginner’s mind. It is enthusiastic about everything—abutterfly, a rainbow, the stars at night, a cottontail rabbit, a new book, afragrant rose, a fresh strawberry. Stay alert to the amazing display that istaking place around you. Pay attention to the remarkable dance of nature that isever fresh and new. Energized alertness is the basis of enthusiasm. Enthusiasmreverses aging.SPONTANEITYA youthful mind is spontaneous. It is unpredictable. It has not beenconditioned. A youthful mind is awake to all possibilities and is not inhibitedby established norms. A youthful mind relinquishes the need to narrowly defineitself. A youthful mind tolerates ambiguity, which gives rise to spontaneity.You have spontaneous impulses inside of you right now. Close your eyes and feelthe exuberance of spontaneity that wants to manifest. Right now, as you arereading this book, do something spontaneous. Find the impulse within you andnourish it with your attention. Here are some suggestions:Kiss your spouseStart dancingCall your motherStart singingTake off your clothesRead a poemDraw a pictureBe spontaneous. It is not possible to “practice” spontaneity, but you can bealert to nurturing the spontaneous impulses that are bubbling up inside of you.Spontaneity is a quality of a youthful mind.FLUIDITY AND ADAPTABILITYA youthful mind is fluid and adaptable. It does not allow itself to be trappedby boundaries that overshadow the unity of all things. It naturally sees theinterrelatedness of life, and therefore is able to flow with changing situationsand circumstances without resistance. A youthful mind does not get stuck in finedistinctions.Be adaptable. Don’t allow yourself to get trapped into viewing things from anarrow, limited perspective. Practice seeing the big picture. Avoid lettingboundaries overshadow your unity. Look for the interrelatedness of all things inlife.YOUR QUANTUM MINDAt the level of quantum reality, the universe is not made up of things. It iscomprised of oscillating fields of energy. The quantum domain is spontaneous. Itis inherently unpredictable, resisting all efforts to define it precisely. Inthe quantum domain, everything is interrelated. Any perturbation in the fieldinfluences everything else in the field.The quantum realm has unlimited energy, unlimited unpredictability, andunlimited interconnectedness. Another way of saying this is that the quantumrealm is enthusiastic, spontaneous, and fluid. These are the qualities of thecosmic mind that every moment gives rise to a fresh universe. These are thequalities of a youthful mind that every moment gives rise to a new body.Heightening Your Level of Sensory AwarenessA youthful mind is alert to the rich inner and outer sensations of life. An agedmind is dull and oblivious to the sensory delights that are available internallyand externally. You can create a youthful, exuberant mind by heightening yourstate of sensory awareness. Awaken to the rich sensations inside and outside ofyou. Enliven your imagination. A youthful mind is tuned in to themultidimensional, multisensory universe we inhabit.NOURISHING YOUR BODY/MIND THROUGH THE FIVE SENSESPay attention to your environment. Feed your senses delectable, interesting,awe-inspiring impulses. A youthful mind is nourished through the exploration ofnew domains. See your environment with fresh eyes. Don’t take your world forgranted.Listen to beautiful, interesting, different music from around the world. Listento the sounds of nature—birds singing, the wind blowing through the leaves, rainbeating on your roof, ocean waves crashing against the shore.Feel the texture of things. Dig your hands into the earth. Stroke your pet.Caress your loved ones. Feel a sculpture. Rub your hands along a tree’s bark.Look at your world with fresh eyes. Notice things you don’t usually payattention to. Look at the many shades of green that nature paints. Watch theclouds manifest and dissolve. Go to your local art museum and walk through thegalleries. Really look at the faces of the people in your life.Taste things as if for the first time. Bite into a tart apple. Savor the flavorof freshly baked cherry pie. Pop a clove bud in your mouth. Taste your loverwith a passionate kiss. Drink a freshly squeezed glass of orange juice. Delightyour taste buds.Notice the aromas in your environment. Breathe in the fragrances of your garden.Sniff the smells of dinner. Inhale the scents of your loved one. Go outsideafter a rain and smell the earth. Notice how closely smells are linked with yourmemories and emotions.EXPAND YOUR IMAGINATIONThe energy and information of the world is translated into subtle sensoryimpulses that are experienced on the screen of your consciousness. These innerimpulses are known in Ayurveda as Tanmatras. We can think of them as mentalquanta, the subjective equivalent to the subtlest units of matter in thephysical world. Awakening the Tanmatras through active imagination creates ayouthful mind.Read the following visualizations, then close your eyes and invoke a vividimpression in your mind.SoundImagine the sound of:A church bell tolling on Sunday morningA cricket, chirping outside your window at nightA marching band performing at a high school football gameA grandfather clock sounding six o’clockA coyote howling at the moonTouchImagine the sensations of:Walking on a sandy beachTaking a hot showerTouching a rose petalStroking the soft cheek of an infant childCaressing satin sheetsVisionImagine the sight of:The sun setting over the Pacific OceanA flock of geese flying in formation overheadCumulus clouds on a warm summer dayA children’s ballet performanceAn Olympic diver jumping off the platformTasteImagine the taste of:A fresh, ripe peachA spoonful of chocolate-chip ice creamGargling with mint-flavored mouthwashA pungent jalapeño pepperA bitter leaf of endive lettuceSmellImagine the smell of:Bread baking in the ovenA new bar of sandalwood soapA cinnamon stickA freshly cut lemonA fragrant roseMULTISENSORY IMAGINATIONYou can develop your subtle senses by imagining multisensory experiences. Startwith the following exercises and then create your own visualizations to exerciseyour imagination.Imagine:You are walking along the beach on a tropical island. You feel the warm sun onyour body. You hear the ocean waves lapping at the shore and the call ofseagulls. You smell the faint waft of your coconut suntan lotion.Imagine:You are in a late-fifties diner. The sounds of an Elvis Presley song fill theroom from the jukebox in the corner. The young men in the restaurant are wearingwhite T-shirts with their sleeves rolled up. You take your first swallow of thechocolate milk shake served in a large frosty fountain glass.Imagine:You are lying on a lounge chair on a warm summer night. Fireflies are glowing onand off as you gaze into the dark sky. Crickets are chirping in unison. Thefragrance of night-blooming jasmine perfuses the air. As you take a bite out ofa fresh peach, a shooting star flashes through the sky.Nurture the enthusiasm that comes with heightened awareness of the sounds,sensations, sights, tastes, and smells in your outer and inner worlds. Payattention to the gifts your senses bring you.Learning and GrowingA youthful mind is a growing mind. It is dedicated to continual expansion andlearning. A youthful mind thrives on new experiences and new knowledge.Experience combined with knowledge leads to wisdom.Make a commitment to learn throughout your life. Here are just a few suggestionsto keep your mind growing:Read—the classics, novels, Shakespeare, science fiction, fantasies. Try genresyou do not usually choose.Read poetry—Rumi, Tagore, Hafiz, Blake, Longfellow, Frost, Ginsberg, and themodern poetsRead spiritual literature—the Bible, the Koran, the Bhagavad Gita, theUpanishads, the DhammapadaTake classes at your local collegeLearn a foreign languageTake piano lessonsLearn to danceTake art classesLearn to cookTake writing classesJoin a choirTake pottery classesLearn a new computer programTake a poetry-writing classGo to workshops—on love, on human potential, on success, on spirituality, onhealthTake horseback-riding lessonsTake a photography classVisit new placesTravel to foreign landsGo to museums and art galleriesWatch foreign filmsGo to concertsRelinquish rigid ideas about who you are, and challenge yourself with newexperiences and new perspectives. Expand your vocabulary. Keep abreast of trendsin art, science, technology, medicine, politics, music, and fashion. Don’t beafraid to question prevailing beliefs, including your own. Learn something newevery day. As you continue stimulating your mind to grow, your brain willcontinue creating new connections among its billions of cells.Experience combined with knowledge leads to wisdom.Playfulness, Lightheartedness, and LaughterA youthful mind is playful and lighthearted. It laughs easily, genuinely, andwith abandon. You can probably recall times from your childhood when you giggledso hard you could barely stand or walk. Playfulness and joy are qualities ofSpirit, which is inherently lighthearted. Knowing itself as eternal andunbounded, Spirit does not surrender its magic and enthusiasm for trivialconcerns.Play and recreation go hand in hand. Play is literally an opportunity forre-creation—an opportunity to re-create yourself. When you play with abandon,you enter into the present moment. You let go of the past and forget about thefuture. When you are playing, you lose track of time. The timeless domain ofplay is the realm of Spirit. Spirit is innately playful.The ego, on the other hand, is serious. It is solely concerned with power,control, and approval. The ego is easily offended. Whatever arrogance orself-importance people may project, if they are dominated by their ego, theirunderlying experience is one of fear—fear of losing control, fear of losingpower, fear of losing approval. This fear leads to seriousness and the tendencyto be easily offended.When you shift your internal reference from ego to spirit, you relinquish yourneed to control, cajole, withhold, seduce, and manipulate and simply allow theuniverse and life to unfold. This creates a natural state of ease, whichpredisposes you to lightheartedness and laughter.Laughter is the best medicine for body and mind. Scientific studies have shownthat laughter can enliven the immune system, raise pain thresholds and easedepression. We encourage you to have the intention to lighten up and be open tothe wonder and delight of living a human life. Remind yourself, remind yourfriends, and remind your loved ones not to allow terminal seriousness to consumethe life force.Suggestions for Playfulness and LaughterSpend time with childrenGo to toy storesPlay with your animalsGo to an improvisational theater showWatch funny moviesGo to a comedy storeRent old Candid Camera episodesWatch Marx Brothers moviesGo to the beachTake a ski tripWatch I Love Lucy rerunsRide your bicycleGo bowlingRent RollerbladesGo to a baseball gameStart a pillow fightTell jokesPlay board gamesTickle someoneHave a staring contestThrow a costume partyGo to an animal-free circusDanceHave a tea partyGo to an ice cream shopBake cookiesBlow bubblesPlay miniature golfGo to the batting cagesWatch people at shopping mallsGo to an amusement parkPaint with watercolorsRent a sailboatGo on a picnicMake up lists of fun and playful things to doThe timeless domain of play is the realm of Spirit.Spirit is innately playful. According to Vedic science, the purpose of life is the expansion of happiness.Creation is a marvelous divine play that assigns each of us a different role.The Sanskrit word for this play is leela. You can take your role very seriouslyand miss life’s magic, or you can recognize that you are eternal Spiritdisguising yourself as an actor and celebrate the leela. Not taking life oryourself too seriously does not mean being irresponsible. In actuality, if yourecognize the cosmic play you become more responsible, for you see everythought, word, and action as an expression of the divine playwright. Relish themagic and the mystery in every moment.Laughter is a symptom of spirituality. Laughter is the flow of love, coursingthrough your body. Laughter is the nectar of present-moment awareness.Invite more enthusiasm into your life.Invite more playfulness.Invite more lightheartedness.Invite more laughter. One of our favorite playful and lighthearted cosmic revelers is thefourteenth-century mystic Hafiz, whose poems have been translated recently byDaniel Ladinsky. Hafiz invites us all to join in the cosmic dance.What is laughter?What is this precious love and laughterBudding in our hearts?It is the glorious soundOf a soul waking up! Play and enjoy. It will keep you young in body, mind, and soul.Every day in every way,I am increasing my mental and physical capacity.My Biostat is set at a healthy ____ years of age.I look and feel a healthy ____ years old.

The high lamaof the monastery, for example, informs Conway that as a result of secretantiaging practices, he has been alive for more than two hundred and fiftyyears!Soon after arriving, Conway finds himself attracted to Lo-Tsen, an enchantingnineteen-year-old Chinese girl who plays music each evening for the residentmonks. He eventually learns that the girl longs to escape from Shangri-La.Despite her comfortable existence in paradise, she yearns for the experience ofcontrast that Shangri-La, with its absence of suffering, aging, and death,cannot provide.Conway, his younger associate, and Lo-Tsen leave Shangri-La on a treacherousjourney back to civilization. We do not learn their fate until the epilogue,when it is revealed that Conway has been brought to a mission hospital in Chinaby an old, frail woman, who immediately succumbs to a feverish illness. LeavingShangri-La has unmasked the woman’s real age, which is over a hundred years old.We are left only to imagine the ultimate destiny of Hugh Conway.As long as human beings have existed, we have dreamt of lands like Shangri-La.We envision these domains as exotic places with lush valleys, beautiful naturalscenery, and pure mountain air. And yet Shangri-La is not a place. It is a stateof consciousness in which one lives in a timeless reality, where all materialthings are experienced as endless transformations of energy and intelligence,where suffering, aging, entropy, and even death do not exist.While such a place may at first seem desirable, the story of Shangri-La remindsus that as human beings we require contrast, meaning, and purpose for our livesto be worth living. Osho tells the story of a man who dreams that immediatelyupon his arrival at a celestial plane, an attendant informs him that anything hedesires will instantly manifest. The man asks for a meal and the attendantinstantaneously creates a sumptuous feast for him. The man asks forentertainment and the attendant immediately conjures up a band of actors andmusicians to amuse him. He expresses sensual yearning and beautiful women areinstantly manifested to indulge his sexual fantasies. Although he is initiallyfascinated with his experience, after a few days the man becomes bored and asksthe attendant if he can provide some work for him to do. The attendant politelyinforms him that he can give the man anything he wants except purposefulactivity. The man replies, “I cannot spend all my time without something usefulto do. I might as well be in Hell!” to which the attendant replies, “Where doyou think you are?”According to Ayurveda, human life span depends upon our collectiveconsciousness. In Vedic mythology, human consciousness goes through four cycles,known in Sanskrit as yugas. In each yuga, the life span of human beings changes.In the first cycle, known as Sat Yuga, 75 percent of people are livingenlightened lives, and therefore most people live a very long time. If we are tobelieve the Old Testament, people, as exemplified by Methuselah, can live to athousand years of age in Sat Yuga.The second yuga is called Dwarpa Yuga. In this age about 50 percent of peopleare in a higher state of consciousness. In Dwarpa Yuga the average life span ispurported to be about 500 years. The third cycle of time is called Treta Yuga.In this age 25 percent of people are in higher states of consciousness and theaverage life span is supposed to be 250 years.Finally, we come to the fourth cycle, known as Kala Yuga, in which only ahandful of people are experiencing higher states of consciousness. According toAyurveda, this is our current age. But even in Kala Yuga, the average life spanis supposed to be a hundred years, so most human beings are not even reachingtheir full potential in Kala Yuga. This stage is sometimes referred to as theage of darkness because people are experiencing such a small fraction of theirvast mental and physical potential.Critics may dismiss these theories as part of mythology, but as Joseph Campbell,the distinguished explorer of mythology, once said, “Mythology contains moretruth than history.” Mythology expresses the greatest aspirations, desires, andambitions of the collective imagination. The time may be coming when we canfulfill these aspirations. The theory of collective consciousness states that ifjust 1 percent of people were experiencing higher states of consciousness, therewould be a completely different expression of society. Everything would change:the crime rate would plummet, hospital admissions would fall, and people wouldlive healthier and longer lives.After billions of years of evolution, life is beginning to divulge its innermostsecrets. Biological intelligence carried in the genetic code has created a humanbeing that is now capable of exploring its own origins. Modern scientists,unraveling the human genome, are deciphering the alphabet of life. We all hopethat with this new technology we will better understand and intervene in illnessand aging. Technology itself is neutral—it is neither inherently good nor bad.How we use technology is a reflection of our collective consciousness.As the science of genetics evolves, we may be able to substantially extend lifeand ensure that more and more people are able to live out their full potential.It is critical that we raise our awareness so we can collectively make choicesthat are most evolutionary for individuals, the human species, and the globalecology. Jonas Salk, the great biologist and developer of the first poliovaccine, expressed the brilliant insight that if we are to survive as a species,we must move beyond the Darwinian concept of “survival of the fittest” to a newparadigm: “survival of the wisest.” The principles and practices offered in thisbook are dedicated to such a high purpose.The cycle of life is one of continuous transformation. Adaptation leads tostability, which eventually results in stagnation, entropy, disintegration,dissolution, and incubation (commonly perceived of as death). In the rightseason, incubation gives rise to a quantum leap in creativity, experienced asrebirth, resurrection, and renewal. Without this unending cycle we would bedoomed to eternal senility.Our collective beliefs, expectations, and choices have been such that the forcesof decay and entropy have dominated our experience of life. It is time to turnour attention to the creative forces within us. While the cycle will continue,we believe that as the next few decades unfold, we will see a new era in whichhuman aging will have a completely new expression. As you have learned by nowfrom this book, it is possible to have increased vitality, creativity, andmental and physical capacity as the years unroll. Many have lamented that youthis wasted on the young, but now we have the opportunity to experience theexquisite combination of mature wisdom along with youthful biology. Through ourinterpretation and choices we can increase both the quality and quantity ofhuman life, adding both years to our life and life to our years. This should beour intention for the world and ourselves.We have access to Shangri-La in our own awareness. Modern physicists tell usthat quantum mathematics predicts parallel coexisting realities. In the quantumworld there are no fixed objects, only superpositions of probability—oscillatingfields of possibility. Shangri-La is one such possibility—a projection ofconsciousness that is beyond the limitations of time and space. The world ofdisease, decay, entropy, and premature death is another projection ofconsciousness that is currently our pervasive one. When reality shifts, both theobserver and the observed change. The observer in one reality is quite differentfrom the observer in another; if the observer does not change, neither does theobserved.Here the observed is the body while the observer is your state of consciousness.Although focusing on the body through diet, exercise, and herbs can be helpful,the real shift has to be in consciousness. When you, the observer, shifts, yourbody also shifts, and your interpretation of your life transforms. Oneconsequence of this transformation is the recognition that aging is a choice.According to Ayurveda, every human being is a weaving together of theenvironment, body, mind, and spirit. The environment has the shortest shelflife, for it is changing every moment. The body has a slightly longer shelflife. It takes about a year to replace almost all the atoms and molecules thatcomprise it. The mind, which includes the intellect and ego, has a still longershelf life. Your aspirations, beliefs, dreams, memories, and desires may last anentire lifetime. Your soul is eternal and not subject to the entropy and decaythat govern the environment, body, and mind. Live your life from the level ofyour soul and you will be timeless.This awareness will not do away with the essential fact of your physicalmortality. The soul must have the opportunity to evolve and take quantum leapsin creativity. To live in the same body forever would be like getting stuck withthe same automobile for eternity. At some point, the old must give rise to thenew. The cycle must go on as beautifully expressed in the Alfred, Lord Tennysonpoem:The old order changeth, yielding place to new;And God fulfills himself in many ways,Lest one good custom should corrupt the world. We have given you the tools in this book to become a co-creator with God toharness the evolutionary forces of imagination, inspiration, innovation, andcreativity. There is immense power in these tools. We hope you will use themwisely and, by example, lead the way in helping to create a world of joy,wisdom, and vitality."},{"pageContent":"Grow Younger, Live Longer RecipesThe following are seven vegetarian menus of worldwide regional cuisine.
