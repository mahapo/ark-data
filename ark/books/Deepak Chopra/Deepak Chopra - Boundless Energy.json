As someone living incontemporary Western society, however, you probably have no need for adefinition of fatigue. You’re likely to be quite familiar with the problemalready. In fact, there’s an excellent chance that you’re living with chronicfatigue right now.Despite the fact that fatigue is widespread in modern life, it really is aunique phenomenon when seen in the context of nature as a whole. After all,nature abounds with energy and purposeful activity. Birds awaken early, sing,tirelessly build their nests, and gather food for their young; squirrels boundup tree trunks and jump from branch to branch; and in spring, the grass and theflowers almost seem to leap from the earth with exuberance and vitality.This astonishing energy is present not only in the biological world but in thephysical universe as well. Waves crash against the shore; rivers rush toward thesea with incredible power; the wind howls, pushing everything before it; theearth spins on its axis and circles the sun at incredible speed; and the sunitself is continually producing unimaginable amounts of heat and light.Physicists tell us that the universe is nothing other than one dynamic,pulsating field of overwhelming energy.It’s puzzling, isn’t it? With so much energy throughout nature, how can anyonepossibly feel fatigued? Why is fatigue a daily experience for millions ofpeople? Why, for many of them, is it the dominant experience of their lives?The discrepancy between the prevalence of chronic fatigue in our society and theabundant energy in the natural world creates a troubling paradox. But it canalso provide an important clue for finding the real answer to chronic fatigue.In this book you’ll learn many techniques for reestablishing the connectionbetween yourself and nature; more specifically, you’ll learn how to uncover thenatural sources of energy that are already within you.Before going into the solutions, let’s look more closely at the problem offatigue in our society and get some idea of its scope.Fatigue is one of the most common complaints that people bring to doctors. Arecent study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association foundthat 24 percent of patients who were randomly surveyed in the waiting room of ageneral medical clinic complained of chronic fatigue. Women reported a higherrate of fatigue than men—28 percent were fatigued compared to 19 percent ofmen—but the incidence in men was still almost one in five.While there’s no doubt that fatigue is a constant presence in the lives ofmillions of Americans, it is also one of the most elusive complaints for aphysician to evaluate, and only rarely can a definitive cause be isolated. Thisis not to suggest that you shouldn’t have a medical checkup if you’reexperiencing persistent, deep fatigue that has lasted for several weeks—theremay be a clear-cut, easily treatable cause such as anemia, a thyroid problem,hepatitis, diabetes, mononucleosis, kidney problems, or another chronic healthdisorder. I recommend a physical exam to rule out these possible causes, but Ialso want to emphasize that for the overwhelming majority of people complainingof chronic fatigue, no specific physical cause can be discovered. Indeed, thismay be the single most important finding in all the many studies that examinedthe problem.For the purposes of this book, chronic fatigue means a noticeable lack of energythat has been present for one month or more. This is very different from acutefatigue, which is usually brought on by the demands of specific situations, suchas cramming for an exam or rushing to meet a deadline at work. Acute fatiguegenerally disappears with the passage of time and some extra rest. People whoare chronically fatigued continue to feel tired no matter how much rest theyget. In fact, it is quite common for chronically fatigued people to feel tiredimmediately upon waking up in the morning, and even more tired after they get upand about. Clearly, sleep alone is not sufficient to solve the problem ofchronic fatigue.To sum up, then, we can define chronic fatigue as fatigue that has lasted for atleast one month, that is present every day or almost every day, and that is notcured by sleep or rest.THE MIND/BODY CONNECTION AND CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROMEDespite the widespread incidence of chronic fatigue throughout the population,the magnitude of its impact on normal life is probably underestimated by manypeople. Studies have shown that chronic fatigue can be every bit as debilitatingas serious medical disorders such as untreated thyroid disease or a recent heartattack. This is even more remarkable in light of the fact that the overwhelmingmajority of people with chronic fatigue do not have a clear physical cause fortheir problem.In the absence of such a cause, it has become clear that most chronic fatigue isstrongly influenced by emotional and psychological factors. For example, studieshave found that up to 80 percent of chronically fatigued people score higherthan normal on psychological tests of depression or anxiety. This brings up avery important idea—the mind/body connection—which will be a central theme ofthis book. Your mind and your emotions can be major sources of energy or majorwasters of it, and the choice is entirely yours. We will explore this concept indetail in the pages that follow.Before going any further, however, it’s important to mention a subgroup ofpeople who have an especially severe version of fatigue which has come to beknown as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. CFS is a specific disorder that was firstrecognized medically in the mid-1980s. Although there is currently no firmagreement among health care professionals regarding the cause of the problem,there is evidence that suggests viral infection and malfunction of the immunesystem may be involved.Data from the federal Center for Disease Control and Prevention indicates thattrue Chronic Fatigue Syndrome affects between 100,000 and 250,000 adultsnationwide. These people experience a type of fatigue that is sufficientlyintense and persistent to reduce normal daily activities by at least 50 percentfor a minimum of six months, and it also includes specific physiologicalsymptoms that distinguish CFS from a simple lack of energy. CFS patients oftensleep twelve hours a day or more, yet they have great difficulty performingroutine tasks, due to exhaustion. Individuals with the usual kind of chronicfatigue can generally manage to push themselves through their daily activities,but people with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome are truly disabled by their disorder.CFS also commonly includes physical symptoms such as low-grade fever, recurrentsore throat, painful lymph nodes, muscle aches or weakness, joint pains, andheadaches. Sleep seems unrefreshing, and there may also be problems withconcentration and short-term memory.If you have symptoms that suggest Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, you should see adoctor for medical evaluation.THE TRUE SOURCES OF CHRONIC FATIGUEBy now we recognize that chronic fatigue is a very common problem that canmanifest itself as a moderately severe impediment to the enjoyment of life, orthat can be genuinely devastating when it assumes the form of Chronic FatigueSyndrome. But the solution to the problem is always the same: more energy.Specifically, the remedy for chronic fatigue—and the basis for achieving a morefulfilling experience of life in general—lies in the ability to tap into theunlimited natural field of energy that surrounds us at every moment. Einsteinrevealed that every atom in the universe contains an enormous amount of power,and contemporary physics continues to demonstrate that everything in theuniverse comes into being through fluctuations in a unified field of energy andintelligence, which is the very foundation of nature. In other words, a singlesource of energy underlies everything, and it is from this source that all thephenomena of the universe are brought into existence. As human beings, we aresimply localized concentrations of energy and intelligence in the universalfield. The intelligence and energy that flows through our bodies is the same asthat which governs the universe. We and everything around us are part of acontinuum with nature.All this becomes clear when we consider the atoms that compose the human body.Quantum physics has shown that the atoms themselves are not solid, irreducibleobjects. They are made up of subatomic particles—protons, neutrons, andelectrons—which whirl around each other at lightning speeds. And within eachatom the distances between these subatomic particles are proportionately asgreat as the distances between stars and galaxies. This means that the humanbody is proportionately as void as intergalactic space.From a physicist’s point of view, even subatomic particles are not solid,tangible objects. Rather, they too are fluctuations of energy that have taken ona material form. Einstein said that matter is really nothing but energy cloakedin a different form, and the great physicists of the 1920s and 1930s confirmedthat every physical particle is ultimately a form of energy vibration called a\"wave function.\" This revelation—that matter is actually a form of wavevibration—is called \"wave-particle duality\" in quantum physics.These insights from the most advanced branches of modern science can provide uswith an entirely new understanding of our bodies. Beyond its material form, thebody is really a pulsating, dynamic field of energy. The individual particlesthat make up the body are energy vibrations within the larger, universal field.Underlying our material being there exists what might be called a \"quantummechanical body,\" which is pure process, pure energy, and pure intelligence.Since the quantum mechanical body determines what the material body will belike, it is in the quantum mechanical body that we’ll find the origins ofchronic fatigue, and also the keys for eliminating it.While most of us (with the exception of quantum physicists) think of the body assomething solid and physical, we also think of the mind as insubstantial,nonmaterial, ghostlike. As long as this perceived dichotomy remains, it will bedifficult to understand how mind and body can possibly interact with each other.But now the relationship between them is precisely the focus of a new area ofscience known as mind/body medicine, which is offering exciting solutions tosome of the most difficult and frustrating problems in contemporary health care.Once you understand that the apparently material structure of the body is reallynothing other than pure energy, it becomes clear that thought and matter arefundamentally alike. From the point of view of quantum physics, there is notmuch difference between fluctuations of thought arising within the unified fieldand the wave vibrations that give rise to the particles that make up the humanbody. In short, your thoughts are quantum events, subtle vibrations of thefield, that have a profound influence on all the functions of your body.Recent research at the National Institutes of Health has gained importantinsights into the relationship between the mind and the physical body. It hasbecome clear that an entire category of chemicals, called neuropeptides, isproduced by the brain every time a thought or feeling occurs. The type ofneuropeptide produced corresponds to the quality of thought or feeling that hastaken place. And most important, these neuropeptides are not confined to thebrain or nervous system. Receptors to neuropeptides have been found throughoutthe digestive system, the heart, lungs, kidneys, and in the immune system aswell. This indicates that neuropeptides have a powerful effect on allphysiological processes, including energy production and immunity.Once we begin to grasp the mind/body connection—that is, how thoughts andemotions affect the body—we can begin to understand the causes of chronicfatigue. We can understand why research has shown that chronic fatigue patientsgenerally do not have specific physical problems, but tend to have higher thannormal levels of depression and anxiety. This is a crucial point: it appears tobe a deficit in the emotional and mental life of an individual that robs thebody of energy and produces chronic fatigue. This energy drain is a function ofthe mind/body connection, and it is governed by chemicals produced in the brain.At any moment, your perceived energy level is the product of a large number ofvariables, such as the quality of your food and digestion, the temperature ofthe air around you, your thoughts and emotions, and many more. But the level ofbasic vitality you experience in daily life is determined by the quality of yourconnection to the unified field of energy that surrounds you. This connectioncontrols the infusion of energy and intelligence into all your bodily systems,and it governs how well your physiological processes are working at everymoment.With this quantum mechanical viewpoint as a foundation, I am going to offer somerules that can help you experience pure energy rather than chronic fatigue. Wewill call these rules Primary Energy Principles, or PEPs, and in each chapter ofthis book new ones will be introduced. As you read, I suggest that you keep apen and paper handy in order to write down the PEPs as you encounter them. Thiswill focus your attention and help you to commit the PEPs to memory.The first one explains why learning these principles will be of great benefit toyour health.PEP 1. Knowledge has organizing power. Through the mind/body connection,knowledge affects the body and creates health.Quite literally, knowledge can heal, and according to mind/body medicine,knowledge is the greatest healer of all. Therefore if you write down each of thePEPs and take them to heart, the effect can actually be like a medicinalprescription for your mind/body physiology. The neurochemicals that will becomestructured in your system will help to nourish, heal, and revitalize you in avery real and very profound way.Here are four more PEPs:PEP 2. Energy is natural to life. The fact that unlimited energy is alwayspresent and available in the unified field is the most basic truth of nature.PEP 3. Energy flows naturally from the unified field to the mind/body system.Fatigue results from blocks or imbalances in this natural flow.PEP 4. Blocks or imbalances in the mind/body system develop when harmony withnature has been disrupted.PEP 5. A balanced mind/body system allows energy to flow easily from nature.Therefore the key to eliminating chronic fatigue and having abundant energy isbalance.Our first five PEPs contain important information about energy and fatigue, andthey also serve to illuminate the relationship of any individual to thesurrounding universe. PEP number 5, for example, refers to balance, which willbe the key principle of this book. Balance is the goal of all the techniquesyou’ll be learning, and it’s a word that should be understood in a holistic way.Ideally, balance means complete integration of physical and spiritual componentsin every area of your experience.In the chapters that follow, you’ll learn techniques for creating balance infour areas: your body, your mind, your behavior, and your environment.The first technique, which is a mind/body method for reducing fatigue, is called\"energy tracking.\" Very simply, this involves making yourself more aware of thelevel of energy you experience throughout the day. It derives from our firstPrimary Energy Principle—knowledge has organizing power. You can actually beginsolving the problem of chronic fatigue merely by increasing your awareness ofyour own feelings.Why should you track energy rather than fatigue? The answer lies in our sixthPEP, which is called the Principle of the Second Element. Please write it down:PEP 6. The Principle of the Second Element states that the ultimate solution toany problem is not on the level of the problem itself. Rather, the solutionappears when a second element is introduced that is opposite to the problem.To clarify this principle, let me offer an anecdotal illustration. People in adark room may perceive that the darkness is a hindrance. Because of thedarkness, they can’t see what they’re doing and they’re constantly bumping intoeach other. They experience all sorts of difficulties and they simply can’tenjoy life. But perhaps an intelligent group of people in the room will cometogether to think about how to solve the problem of darkness. They might form acommittee to investigate its possible causes. They might try to diagnose varioustypes and forms of darkness, and they might imagine all sorts of ways to treatit and eliminate it. Vast amounts of energy could be devoted to solving theproblem of darkness on the level of the problem itself.However, in the midst of all this analysis, one person might accidentallystumble against a switch on the wall, and the room would be filled with light.In an instant, the darkness is gone! It would suddenly become clear thatdarkness was not the problem. The real problem was the absence of a secondelement— in this case, light. In fact, the darkness itself had no reality exceptin a negative sense; it was merely the absence of a positive element.Similarly, fatigue itself is not a problem. Fatigue is merely the absence of apositive force, which is energy. According to the principle of the SecondElement, the solution to the problem of fatigue can be achieved by focusing onenergy. For this reason, all the techniques and principles that follow will beoriented toward enhancing energy in the mind/body system. Instead of becomingfascinated by the darkness, we’ll concentrate on bringing in some light.To become aware of the ebbs and flows of your energy every twenty-four hours,use the Energy Tracking Chart provided in this chapter. On the chart, you shouldnote the energy levels you experience at three important points during the day.The first of these key moments occurs shortly after you wake up, the second isin the late afternoon around 4:00 P.M., and the last is in the evening at 8:00P.M.When you rate your energy, simply sit quietly and let your awareness encompassyour whole body. Allow yourself a few minutes to focus on this in a settingwhere you’re not likely to be interrupted. It may help to close your eyes and tobreathe slowly and evenly. When you’re ready, make a mental appraisal of yourenergy level and then enter it on the chart. In the \"comments\" section, youshould mention any activities or experiences that may have affected your energy.ENERGY TRACKING CHARTStop and measure your level of energy at three key times during the day: shortlyafter you wake up in the morning, in the late afternoon at around 4:00 P.M., andin the evening at around 8:00 P.M.To determine your level of energy, sit quietly and let your awareness be on yourwhole body. Then mentally note your energy level, using a scale of 0 to 10.Circle the number on the scale that most accurately describes your energy level.0 = No energy, complete fatigue5 = Equal amounts of fatigue and energy10 = Complete energy and vitality, without any trace of fatigueAt the end of the week, connect the circles to show the general trend of yourenergy levels.image [images/Chop_9780307419958_epub_003_r1.jpg]By using the chart to increase your awareness of what your body is experiencing,you can begin to eliminate the imbalances that are the basis of chronic fatigue.The chart will also provide a permanent written record of your progress as youbegin applying the other techniques described in this book. You’ll be able tosee at a glance how fatigue is progressively replaced by energy as balance isrestored to your system.Remember: The key to overcoming fatigue and to living life with energy, zest,and fulfillment is balance. By living in harmony with the universe around youand with the universe within you, you can experience an infusion of energybeyond anything you might have imagined."},{"pageContent":"image [images/Chop_9780307419958_epub_004_r1.jpg]YOUR UNIQUE MIND/BODY CONSTITUTIONThe universe is an infinite reservoir of unimaginable energy—and you are anexpression of that energy. The same power that spins the planets around the sunresides within every human being, and it is abundantly available within you. Itis present in every cell of your body and energizes your entire physiologicalsystem. Our goal in this book is to reestablish your contact with this latentreserve of unlimited biological energy, to make it fully accessible to you ineveryday life.As we saw in chapter 1, the secret to contacting your inner energy is thecreation of balance. But in order to achieve this balance, you must grasp someimportant information about your own individual mind/body system.From birth until death, each one of us has his or her own unique constitution,which is constantly expressing itself in dozens of mental and physicalattributes. And all these characteristics, of course, are expressions of thesame underlying reality—they are all quantum fluctuations in the same unifiedfield. We can call this totality of mental and physical characteristics our\"bodymind.\" Knowing the basic elements of your individual bodymind is the firstall-important step in learning to create balance.The concepts in this chapter and in those that follow are derived from the mostrecent scientific advances in Western medicine and also from the Indiantradition of Ayurveda, the oldest system of health-related knowledge in theworld. Ayurveda— which in Sanskrit means \"science of life\"—is the mostcomprehensive system of mind/body medicine ever devised. It offers not only agreat wealth of theoretical knowledge, but also practical techniques forachieving better health. The mind/body approaches of Ayurveda have beenclinically verified in the treatment of hundreds of health concerns, from thecommon cold to cancer, and have proven extremely helpful in eliminating theproblem of chronic fatigue.It is an unfortunate fact that conventional medicine tends to pay more attentionto differences among diseases than to those among people. Ayurveda, however,recognizes that the distinctive features of each individual are crucial tocreating, improving, and preserving human health. Evidence for this is allaround us. Who has not noticed how, on a cool autumn day, some people will bedressed in overcoats, scarves, and gloves, as if it were already winter, whileothers are wearing short-sleeved shirts, as if summer had never ended? In asimilar way, there are people who can eat huge amounts of food, digest iteasily, and then get hungry again two or three hours later—while others are ableto eat only much smaller quantities, have difficulty with digestion, and don’twant to eat again for many hours. These differences in basic physiologicalcharacteristics lead directly and inescapably to the recognition that there aredifferent mind/body types.The same kinds of variations that are apparent in people’s eating habits arealso displayed in their levels of energy and fatigue. We’ve all encounteredindividuals who seem to have unlimited energy resources. They’re able to wake upearly, perhaps with relatively little sleep; they’re dynamically active all day;they go out in the evening or perhaps continue with their work; and they do thisday after day without ever seeming fatigued. Other people—and perhaps you are inthis category— feel tired after managing simple everyday tasks, or they may evenbecome exhausted just by starting off the day. Clearly, different levels ofmetabolism give rise to different patterns of energy production. Each of us hashis or her own \"biological individuality,\" which Ayurveda describes in terms ofpsychophysiological types.In this book, for the sake of simplicity, we’ll refer to individualconstitutional types as \"body types,\" although they definitely involve bothmental and physical characteristics. The Ayurvedic term for body type isprakriti, a Sanskrit word that literally means \"nature.\" Your Ayurvedic bodytype is nothing less than your own individual nature; it’s like a blueprint thatoutlines the innate tendencies that have been built into your system. Learningabout your Ayurvedic body type provides important information for reawakeningyour body’s inner intelligence and for reestablishing a connection with yourinternal energy. To define the different body types Ayurveda focuses on thejunction point between the physical and the spiritual. This is a fascinatingarea of interest, and a crucial one for understanding chronic fatigue.We saw in chapter 1 that the mind and the body do meet. Every event in the mindproduces a corresponding event in the body; a chemical reaction takes place outof which neuropeptides are produced. At this junction point between the twosides of our being, Ayurveda recognizes three basic governing agents, which areknown as doshas : The three doshas—which are called Vata, Pitta, and Kapha—canbe defined in modern scientific terms, and this definition is our next primaryenergy principle.PEP 7. Vata, Pitta, and Kapha are the fundamental quantum mechanical mind/bodymechanisms that govern the flow of intelligence and energy throughout anindividual physiology.There is much to say about each of the doshas, but their basic functions can bedefined broadly and simply: Vata dosha is the governing principle in the bodythat controls movement; Pitta dosha controls metabolism and digestion; and Kaphadosha is responsible for physical structure and fluid balance.Every cell in your body must contain all three of these principles in order tomaintain life. You must have Vata for motion, in order to breathe, to circulatethe blood, to move food through the digestive tract, and to send nerve impulsesto and from the brain. You must have Pitta in order to assimilate and processfood, air, and water through the various systems of your body. You need Kapha,or structure, to hold your cells together and to form muscles, fat, bones, andconnective tissue.Although nature needs all three principles to build and sustain human life, eachof us has different proportions of the doshas in our basic constitutions. Forexample, when I say that a person is a \"Vata type,\" I mean that certain Vatacharacteristics are dominant in that person’s makeup. Pitta types or Kapha typeswill have their own predominant characteristics.By identifying and understanding your body type, you can bring your diet, yourdaily routine, and even your casual behavior into perfect harmony with yourphysiology as a whole—and you can begin to gain access to your inner reserves ofenergy. Let’s look more closely at the characteristics of the three body types.VATAVata is the governing principle of movement. The influence of Vata in anindividual human being can be compared to the action of the wind in nature. Likethe wind, Vata is always moving and tends to be quick, cold, dry, rough, andlight. People who are Vata types are dominated by these qualities as well.Characteristics of Vata TypeLight, thin buildPerforms activity quicklyIrregular hunger and digestionLight, interrupted sleep; tendency toward insomniaEnthusiasm, vivaciousness, imaginationExcitability, changing moodsQuick to grasp new information, also quick to forgetTendency to worryTendency to be constipatedTires easily, tendency to overexertMental and physical energy comes in burstsIt is very Vata toBe hungry at any time of the day or nightLove excitement and constant changeGo to sleep at different times every night, skip meals, and keep irregularhabits in generalDigest food well one day and poorly the nextDisplay bursts of emotion that are short-lived and quickly forgottenWalk quicklyThe basic theme of the Vata type is \"changeable.\" Vata people are unpredictableand much less stereotyped than either Pittas or Kaphas. Their variability—insize, shape, mood, and action—is their defining characteristic. For a Vataperson, mental and physical energy comes in bursts. Vata people tend to walkquickly, to be hungry at any hour, to love excitement and change, to go to sleepat a different time every night, to skip meals, and to digest food well one dayand poorly the next.PITTAPitta dosha governs digestion and metabolism. Pitta is responsible for all thebiochemical transformations that take place in the body, and it is closelyinvolved with hormone and enzyme production. Pitta in the body is likened to thefire principle in nature—it burns, transforms, and digests. Pitta is hot, sharp,and acidic, and Pitta types generally display these qualities.Characteristics of Pitta TypeMedium buildMedium strength and enduranceSharp hunger and thirst, strong digestionTendency to become angry or irritable under stressFair or ruddy skin, often freckledAversion to sun, hot weatherEnterprising character, likes challengesSharp intellectPrecise, articulate speechCannot skip mealsBlond, light brown, or red hair (or reddish undertones)It is very Pitta toFeel ravenous if dinner is half an hour lateLive by your watch and resent having your time wastedWake up at night feeling hot and thirstyTake command of a situation or feel that you shouldLearn from experience that others find you too demanding, sarcastic, or criticalat timesHave a determined stride when you walkIntensity is the theme of the Pitta type. Bright red hair and a florid faceindicate a predominance of Pitta, as do ambition, sharp-wittedness,outspokenness, boldness, and a tendency to be argumentative or jealous. But thecombative side of Pitta does not have to be blatantly or crudely expressed. Whenin balance, Pittas are warm, loving, and content. It is very Pitta to walk witha determined stride, to feel ravenously hungry if a meal is half an hour late,to wake up at night feeling thirsty, to live by the clock, and to resent havingyour time wasted.KAPHAKapha dosha is responsible for structure in the body. In Ayurveda, Kapha is saidto be related to the earth and water principles in nature. Kapha dosha istypically heavy, stable, steady, cold, oily, slow, dull, and soft, and Kaphatypes are characterized by these earthy qualities.Characteristics of Kapha TypeSolid, powerful build; great physical strength and enduranceSteady energy; slow and graceful in actionTranquil, relaxed personality; slow to angerCool, smooth, thick, pale, and often oily skinSlow to grasp new information, but good retentive memoryHeavy, prolonged sleepTendency toward obesitySlow digestion, mild hungerAffectionate, tolerant, forgivingTendency to be possessive, complacentIt is very Kapha toMull things over for a long time before making a decisionWake up slowly, lie in bed a long time, and need coffee upon arisingBe happy with the status quo and preserve it by conciliating othersRespect other people’s feelings (with which you feel genuine empathy)Seek emotional comfort from eatingHave graceful movements, liquid eyes, and a gliding walk, even if overweightThe basic theme of the Kapha type is \"relaxed.\" Kapha dosha brings stability andsteadiness, and it provides the physical strength and stamina that define thesturdy frames of typical Kapha people. Kaphas are considered fortunate inAyurveda because they generally enjoy sound health and a serene, happy view ofthe world. It is very Kapha to mull things over before making a decision, tosleep soundly and awaken slowly, to seek emotional comfort from food, to becontent with the status quo, and to conciliate others in order to preserve it.DISCOVERING YOUR BODY TYPESo far our intention has been to introduce the doshas and to show how they canbe distinguished from one another. But it’s important to understand that mostpeople are \"bi-doschic.\" Their constitutions are structured around a combinationof two body types, and in some cases, all three.The practical effect of these ideas will become clearer when you complete thefollowing questionnaire, which is designed to help you determine your own doshainfluences. Before you read any further, I suggest setting aside about thirtyminutes for answering the following questions and evaluating your responses.AYURVEDA BODY-TYPE QUESTIONNAIREThe following quiz is divided into three sections. For the first 20 questions,which apply to Vata dosha, read each statement and mark, from 0 to 6, whether itapplies to you.0 = Doesn’t apply to me3 = Applies to me somewhat (or some of the time)6 = Applies to me mostly (or nearly all of the time)At the end of the section, write down your total Vata score. For example, if youmark a 6 for the first question, a 3 for the second, and a 2 for the third, yourtotal up to that point would be 6 + 3 + 2 = 11. Total the entire section in thisway, and you will arrive at your final Vata score. Proceed to the 20 questionsfor Pitta and those for Kapha.When you are finished, you will have three separate scores. Comparing these willdetermine your body type.For fairly objective physical traits, your choice will usually be obvious. Formental traits and behavior, which are more subjective, you should answeraccording to how you have felt and acted most of your life, or at least for thepast few years.image [images/Chop_9780307419958_epub_005_r1.jpg]image [images/Chop_9780307419958_epub_006_r1.jpg]image [images/Chop_9780307419958_epub_007_r1.jpg]image [images/Chop_9780307419958_epub_008_r1.jpg]image [images/Chop_9780307419958_epub_009_r1.jpg]image [images/Chop_9780307419958_epub_010_r1.jpg]HOW TO DETERMINE YOUR BODY TYPENow that you have added up your scores, you can determine your body type.Although there are only three doshas, remember that Ayurveda combines them inten ways to arrive at ten different body types.• If one score is much higher than the others, you are probably a single-doshatype.Single-Dosha TypesVataPittaKaphaYou are definitely a single-dosha type if one score is twice as high as anotherdosha score (for instance, Vata—90, Pitta—45, Kapha—35), but a smaller marginalso applies. In single-dosha types, the characteristics of Vata, Pitta, orKapha predominate. Your next highest dosha will still show up in your naturaltendencies, but it will be much less distinct.• If no single dosha dominates, you are a two-dosha type.Two-Dosha Types Vata-Pitta or Pitta-Vata Pitta-Kapha or Kapha-Pitta Vata-Kaphaor Kapha-VataIf you are a two-dosha type, the traits of your two leading doshas willpredominate. The higher one comes first in your body type, but both count.Most people are two-dosha types. A two-dosha type might have a score like this:Vata—80, Pitta—90, Kapha—20. If this was your score, you would consider yourselfto be a Pitta-Vata type.• If your three scores are nearly equal, you may be a three-dosha type.Three-Dosha Type Vata-Pitta-KaphaHowever, this type is considered rarest of all. Check your answers again, orhave a friend go over your responses with you. Also, you can read over thedescriptions of Vata, Pitta, and Kapha on pages 16-20 to see if one or twodoshas are more prominent in your makeup.Now that you have an idea of your particular constitutional type, take a momentto review the qualities of the doshas in order to learn which are mostinfluential in your physiology. This information will be most helpful as youbegin using the practical techniques that will be presented in subsequentchapters.The key point to remember is that, according to the Ayurvedic mind/body system,optimum physical and mental health derives from proper balance of the doshas.When the basic governing principles of mind and body are coordinated, perfectharmony exists between the physical and spiritual sides of our nature. Energy,vitality, and overall good health are the natural result.PEP 8. Balance of the doshas brings about coordination of the entire mind/bodyphysiology. When the doshas are balanced, all of the body’s systems worktogether to create energy, strength, and health.Although balance is a key word, it expresses itself differently in differentindividuals. A balanced Vata person, for example, will display characteristicsthat are distinctly different from those of a balanced Kapha person. Moreover,these two body types require different influences in order to remain in balance.Vata types, who are naturally light and airy, need to create more heaviness andstability in the mind/body system; these \"airy\" types need more \"earthy\"influences. In contrast, Kapha types need to \"lighten up\" in order to remainbalanced; they should seek out influences that get them into action bothmentally and physically. Starting right now, try to use what you’ve learnedabout your body type to help you make better choices in all areas of your life,including your diet, exercise, sleep schedule, and even in your work andpersonal relationships.DOSHA IMBALANCESWhen a dosha goes out of balance, it no longer exists in the correct proportionrequired by an individual’s body type. One influence has become so active thatit dominates or eclipses the other mind/body qualities. The natural condition ofharmony in the physiology, prakriti, has been replaced by the state of imbalancecalled vikriti. This can be the basis for many health concerns, includingchronic fatigue.In general, fatigue is most often a problem of Vata-type individuals. Theirenergy tends to come in sudden, powerful bursts, but their stamina is oftenweak. At a given moment they may feel so exhilarated that they push themselvesbeyond their natural limits. While they are enthusiastic and vivacious bynature, pure Vata types are also most likely to feel the stresses of a demandingschedule or a busy lifestyle. Though they may seem to thrive on overactivity fora time, they eventually become emotionally drained and physically exhausted. Ofthe three basic body types, Vatas must be most careful about monitoring theirenergy resources and using them in a balanced way.Chronic fatigue can also afflict individuals who are predominantly Pitta orKapha, but there is usually a more specific and clearly identifiable reason fortheir tiredness. Pitta fatigue may be caused by situations that overheat or\"inflame\" the Pitta nature, such as excessive sunlight, hot or acidic foods, oremotions such as anger, envy, and irritability. One of the most common causes ofchronic fatigue in Pitta types is a tendency toward overwork. Pittas usuallyhave drive and ambition, but the demands they impose on themselves can outstripeven their naturally abundant energy resources.The inherent stamina of Kapha types would seem to protect them from chronicfatigue, but Kaphas also tend to accumulate \"heaviness,\" both physically andemotionally. When they go out of balance, they gain weight or experienceillnesses such as severe colds or flu, which are associated with fluidcongestion and irritated mucous membranes. Dullness and lethargy can come todominate their personalities. These Kapha symptoms demand a very differentresponse than would be called for by Vata or Pitta imbalance. Chronicallyfatigued Kaphas need to be up and about. They need influences that demandincreased activity. Kaphas should motivate themselves to think sharply andaccurately, and they should get their bodies involved in purposeful action.Here is a summary of fatigue-causing imbalances in each of the three doshas.Vata imbalance is the most common type of fatigue. It often comes and goessuddenly, but even if it is consistently present it tends to vary in intensityat different times of the day. These sudden changes can be brought about by anysort of major or minor influence—a piece of good news can cause an abruptinfusion of energy, but a stressful situation can result in a sense ofexhaustion. Though Vata-type fatigue may be experienced as an overwhelmingsensation, everything about Vata is actually light by nature; the individual isusually able to get through daily activities despite feeling tired. Vata fatigueis often accompanied by other Vata symptoms, such as anxiety, insomnia, andlow-grade depression.Pitta imbalance and resulting fatigue is usually associated with overwork,excessive heat, or eating inappropriate foods. Pitta fatigue may be accompaniedby perspiration, acid indigestion, and other Pitta symptoms. The most commonemotional symptoms accompanying Pitta fatigue are irritability and anger.Kapha imbalance has a characteristically heavy feeling to it. The tirednessexperienced by a Kapha type may seem so profound that even slight movements seemdifficult, and there can be an overwhelming sense of inertia. Kapha fatigue isoften associated with accumulations of impurities or toxins in the system, whichcan literally \"dampen\" the energy producing mechanisms of the body. Kaphafatigue may also be related to severe emotional depression.THE POWER OF ATTENTIONBelow is another Primary Energy Principle that should be extremely helpful asyou continue to use the Energy Tracking Chart at the end of chapter 1. Rememberthat the Energy Tracking Chart will help you get in touch with your hiddenenergy resources. Please continue to use it three times a day as new techniquesare introduced in subsequent chapters.As with all the PEPs, I suggest you write this one down, too:PEP 9. Whatever we put our attention on grows stronger in our lives. The qualityof our attention determines whether benefit or harm results.Attention is the projection of energy and consciousness, and it is a powerfulforce. Whatever we put our attention on tends to increase, for good or for ill.Properly directed attention can have a nourishing quality; it can be a beam ofpositive awareness that heals body and mind. But negative attention canexacerbate any physical or mental symptom.If there is some imbalance present in your mind/body system, nature will directyour attention toward it through signals of discomfort or pain. At that point,you have a choice to make regarding the positive or negative quality of yourawareness. By focusing attention on the debilitating effects of fatigue, you cancause those effects to grow. However, if you make your attention a force forenergy and vitality, you can help those qualities to gain strength and promotehealing.It is extremely important to realize that no matter how deep your sense offatigue may be, there is always a spark of energy alive in your body. The veryfact that you’re alive and reading this book is an expression of the vitalenergy that’s alive in every part of your mind/body system. By focusing yourawareness on that energy, you can turn even a small spark into a bright flame."},{"pageContent":"image [images/Chop_9780307419958_epub_011_r1.jpg]THE IMPORTANCE OF GOOD DIGESTIONEverything you do and accomplish every day—from the beating of your heart, tothe millions of microscopic processes happening in every one of our cells, towalking and thinking and working—everything requires energy, and it is derivedfrom the food you eat. But where does the energy in the food itself come from?Ultimately, of course, it comes from the sun, which provides the light and theheat that plants need in order to grow. It is through food, therefore, that weas human beings gain access to the energy of the universe.During digestion, complex molecules of food are broken down into progressivelysimpler forms. This transformation is called metabolism. Most of the energy fromthe metabolism of food becomes available during the final stages, when oxygencombines with basic molecules such as simple sugars. This is called oxidation,and it is constantly taking place at lightning speed. The oxygen that you takeinto your lungs is carried by your blood to every cell of your body. Enteringthese cells, it combines with food molecules, which have also been brought tothe cells in the bloodstream. This mixing of oxygen with simple food moleculesis similar to the consumption of fuel in a fireplace, in which large amounts ofenergy are released from burning wood in the form of heat and light. In a humanbody, however, energy from the oxidation of food is released in a much morecontrolled way. As a result, the body is able to capture this energy and storeit for future use. It is this energy that enables us to live and to act.Ayurveda speaks of \"digestive fire\" as the medium through which energy isreleased. Agni, which means \"fire\" in Sanskrit, breaks down the food we eat andassimilates it into the system. This digestive fire can be understood as ametaphor for the enzymes that are described by modern physiology.The production of metabolic energy depends on a number of critical factors,including the kinds of foods you eat, your overall state of health, the amountand quality of the air you breathe, and even the thoughts and emotions you’reconstantly experiencing.Much has been written in recent years about the importance of good eating habitsto health and vitality. But from an Ayurvedic viewpoint, strength of digestionis even more important than nutrition. Indeed, the nutritional value of any foodis only useful to the extent that your body can access it through the digestiveprocess. If digestion is weak, food will not be adequately metabolized and itsenergy will simply be lost. For this reason, building the power of digestionwill be our most important consideration in this chapter.WEAK DIGESTION AND THE CREATION OF AMAIn addition to the waste of energy and nutritional value, there is anotherimportant effect of incomplete digestion. Poor digestion causes a residue offood to accumulate in the body. If not properly eliminated, this residue becomesthe basis for a wide variety of impurities and toxins. The Sanskrit word forthese residual impurities is ama. According to Ayurveda, ama is an extremelysignificant cause of fatigue and other long-term health problems. In fact, Ibelieve that digestive imbalance and the resulting accumulation of ama ispresent in virtually every person who suffers from chronic fatigue.Ayurveda describes ama as a sticky substance that blocks normal channels of flowin the physiology. These include not only the veins and arteries of thecirculatory system, but also the ducts that transport all the enzymes andmetabolic substances of the body. Because it blocks the normal flow ofbiological energy, ama is fundamental to the problem of chronic fatigue. It’slike a wet blanket that literally smothers the energy-producing fires of thebody.Ama can sometimes be seen in the form of a white coating on the tongue,especially just after awakening. This is because impurities from incompletedigestion come up from the digestive tract during the night and collect in themouth. Other symptoms of ama are feelings of weakness or heaviness, lethargy,poor immunity, irregular bowl movements, and sharp fluctuations in appetitelevels. Of course, chronic fatigue itself is an important sign of amaproduction.TECHNIQUES FOR STRENGTHENING DIGESTIONThe benefits of strong digestion should be quite clear. It ensures properassimilation of food and it prevents the accumulation of toxic impurities in thebody.The elements of strong digestion are summarized in our next Primary EnergyPrinciple:PEP 10. The quality of digestion is a major factor in promoting vital biologicalenergy. The four main factors that affect digestion are: quality of awareness,timing, quantity of food, and quality of food.Below are some extremely important techniques you can use to strengthen yourdigestion. These techniques can benefit all three body types, but they will beespecially applicable to Vatas, who tend to have irregular digestion, and toKaphas, whose digestion is often slow.Implementing these principles may require some changes in your current habits,but the positive effects will be immediately apparent and worthwhile as you movetoward a more natural way of eating and digesting.Eat in a quiet and settled atmosphere. Don’t divide your attention by working,reading, listening to the radio or watching television during mealtimes. If yourattention is entirely on your food and its various flavors, your power ofdigestion will be greatly enhanced. Always remember that awareness hasorganizing power. When you eat with calm but focused awareness, your digestivefire will be balanced and strong. But if your awareness is distracted, the powerof digestion will weaken.Establish regular mealtimes. When you eat at the same time every day, yoursystem becomes accustomed to digesting according to that routine, and digestionoccurs automatically and thoroughly. Irregular mealtimes \"confuse\" the mind/bodysystem and disallow thorough digestion. Though many people with busy lifestylescan benefit from this point, Vata types especially can benefit because of theirirregular tendencies.Always sit down to eat. Even if you’re just having a snack, take the time to sitdown at the table. This will make your digestion more thorough, by helping todirect your awareness toward your food.Don’t eat when you’re upset. Eating when you’re disturbed or angry divides yourawareness. This will definitely weaken the digestive fire and produce ama. Ifyou’re under stress, wait a few minutes until you feel more settled. It’s alsobest to avoid any controversial discussions at mealtimes that might causetension or irritability.Eat only to a point of comfortable satisfaction. The quantity of food eaten ateach sitting is a very important factor in good digestion. Ayurveda teaches thatwe should eat to three-fourths of capacity. Eating beyond this point is likesmothering a fire with too much fuel. When the stomach is completely full, foodis incompletely metabolized because the digestive fire doesn’t have enough roomto do its work. So stop eating when you feel satisfied, but before you feelheavy and completely full. This will leave some space in your system fordigestive enzymes to function effectively.Avoid ice-cold foods and drinks. Cold substances tend to freeze the digestivefires. Because Vata and Kapha are both cold by nature, these two doshas will beespecially affected by cold foods. Unfortunately, the practice of drinking coldbeverages with meals is deeply established in many Americans. You may think thiswill be a difficult habit to break. But after a week or two most people nolonger miss cold drinks and feel much healthier without them.Don’t talk while chewing your food. While you’re eating, your senses should beturned inward in order to enjoy the taste, sight, and aroma of the meal. Make ita rule not to speak while you have food in your mouth. And as previouslymentioned, conversations at the table should be calm and light, not emotional ordisruptive.Eat at a moderate pace. Gulping food makes good digestion difficult, so takeenough time to eat your meals slowly. A hurried and harried meal is one of theworst things you can do to your energy and good health. You may think thatyou’ll increase your productivity by eating quickly, but don’t be misled—thetime you gain in your schedule will be more than offset by increased fatigue. Sogive mealtimes the respect they deserve. After all, this is the point in the daywhen vital energy is created, and eating hurriedly is like weakening a tree atits root. Try to regulate the speed with which you eat by not placing the nextbite of food on your fork until you have chewed and swallowed the previous bite.Don’t eat anything until your last meal has been completely digested. Snackingwhile you’re still digesting an earlier meal will produce ama. An analogy can bemade with cooking bean soup—if you keep adding beans while the soup is cooking,it will never be done. Digestion of a meal usually takes three to six hours.Hunger is nature’s sign that digestion has been completed, so if you’re notfeeling hungry, don’t eat. If you don’t seem to be hungry at mealtimes (and youhaven’t been snacking) it may be that accumulated ama is dulling your appetite.In such a case, you should eat moderately to avoid overwhelming the digestivefire and producing still more ama. If you feel ravenously hungry between mealsand absolutely must have a snack, make it something light, such as a piece offruit.Sit quietly for a few minutes after your meal. This allows digestion to begineffortlessly. If possible, it’s even better to lie down for fifteen or twentyminutes.Let me emphasize once more that the small effort required by these techniqueswill be greatly rewarded. If you’ve grown attached to certain unhealthypatterns—watching TV while eating, for example—remind yourself that it is thesesame habits that weaken your digestion, produce ama, and contribute to chronicfatigue.It’s not necessary to implement all ten techniques at once. Start with the onesthat seem easiest to you. The checklist that follows on pages 38-39 can help youincorporate these new behaviors into your daily routine: once you’ve grownaccustomed to the easier techniques, add a new one each week until you’ve gotthem all. This will also allow you to monitor your energy levels as newtechniques are put into practice.ADDITIONAL TECHNIQUESThe ideas we’ve discussed so far involve only behaviors at mealtimes. Here arethree more Ayurvedic practices for improving digestion and eliminating ama fromthe system. I am going to discuss these separately from the other techniquesbecause they’re somewhat more sophisticated and may require a bit more of alifestyle adjustment. However, most people find these ideas are of great benefitto digestion and to energizing the entire body/mind system.These methods work by preventing the production of ama or by thoroughlycleansing it from the system. Here is the Primary Energy Principle that is thefoundation of these techniques:PEP 11. Incomplete or imbalanced digestion gives rise to physiologicalimpurities called ama that block the free flow of energy in the body. Vitalenergy is enhanced by preventing the accumulation of these impurities andcleansing them from the system.The first new principle is to eat your main meal of the day at lunchtime ratherthan in the evening. Our contemporary habit of eating a large meal around 6:00P.M. may be one of our biggest diet-related mistakes, and it is a major cause ofchronic fatigue.image [images/Chop_9780307419958_epub_012_r1.jpg]image [images/Chop_9780307419958_epub_013_r1.jpg]Our internal biological rhythms are connected to the rhythms of the naturalworld around us. Therefore the internal digestive fire is brightest at the sametime that the sun is highest in the sky, and according to Ayurveda, digestion issharpest at noontime. If you eat a large quantity of food at this time, it willbe thoroughly digested and assimilated and you’ll get energy without producingama. But this will not be the case if the same volume of food is consumed at alater hour.Similarly, the Western custom of eating a large breakfast may also bedetrimental to health and energy. Digestion is sluggish in the early morningjust after you’ve awakened. Therefore Ayurveda recommends a light meal early inthe day, like the European continental breakfast. In fact, if you aren’t veryhungry in the morning it’s perfectly reasonable to skip breakfast altogether andsave the digestive fire for use at lunch.Because most of us are accustomed to a large meal in the evening, it may be achallenge to put this recommendation into effect immediately. Also, work andother scheduling considerations can make lunchtime a quick affair for many and anon-event for some. But try to become aware of the major toll that such habitsinflict on your body. By really devoting some attention to it, almost anyone canfind a creative way to have a more substantial lunch, even if it means preparingthe meal the night before. Or it may simply involve locating a good restaurantnear your place of work. If this still seems difficult for you, start with oneor two days each week and see how you feel. And remember that breakfast and yourevening meal should be relatively light.My second recommendation is a purification technique for removing ama from thesystem. It’s very straightforward, but it’s also very profound and effective.All you’re asked to do is sip hot water frequently throughout the day, as oftenas every half-hour. Many people with chronic fatigue, as well as other long-termhealth problems, have found that this technique alone can greatly benefit theproblem.Get a good quality thermos and fill it with freshly boiled water each morning.Bring the water to a strong boil, then reduce the flame and allow it to heatmore slowly for five to ten minutes. This gives the water more energy and makesit a more effective purifier. When you’ve filled your thermos, keep it with youall day and sip from it frequently. It may help to put the thermos where you cansee it easily as a reminder.You should take one or two sips of hot water every half-hour throughout the day.If you’re thirsty, of course, you should feel free to drink more than a few sipsat a time. The constant exposure to the cleansing influence of the water willeliminate ama from your body, while the warmth will help to dilate and relaxyour intestines and allow for a good flushing of the system. Please note thatthis technique is fundamentally different from weight-control plans thatstipulate consumption of large amounts of water every day. It is not thequantity of water that is emphasized here; it is the frequency and thetemperature, which are important in creating the purifying effect.If you find it impossible to sip water as often as every half-hour, just do thebest you can. Many people ask if anything can be added to hot water to make itmore interesting. Although plain water is the best cleanser, once or twice a dayyou can add some lemon, which can even have an additional cleansing effect. Youshouldn’t drink lemon water every half-hour, however.The third new technique for improving digestion and eliminating ama is toperiodically take a full day during which you consume only liquids and eat nosolid foods. This allows your gastrointestinal organs to take a twenty-four-hourrest. Impurities will be cleansed from your system during that interval, andafterward your digestive fire will be rekindled, stronger than before.Feel free to consume anything you want as long as it’s in liquid form. Thisincludes hot water, fresh fruit juices or vegetable juices, broths, or herbalteas. I especially recommend a yogurt drink, which Ayurveda calls lassi, whichcan be made in both sweet and salty varieties. Here are recipes for twovarieties of lassi.Sweet Lassi. Mix ¼ to ½ cup of yogurt with ½ cup of room temperature water in ablender. Add a pinch of cardamom and honey to taste. Blend thoroughly. Makes oneserving.Sour Lassi. Same as above, but omit cardamom and honey while substituting apinch of ground cumin and a pinch of salt to taste. Blend thoroughly.The frequency with which you undertake the one-day liquid diet should bedetermined by your body type. For Kaphas, the liquid diet should take place oneday out of every seven. It’s best to pick the same day each week, and it shouldbe a day when you’re not likely to have many responsibilities, such as Sunday.Pitta types, who tend to have stronger hunger, should use the liquid diet aboutonce every two weeks, while Vata types should use it only about once a month.This is because Vatas may become weak and uncomfortable without solid food, evenfor one day. They need some \"earthy\" property each day to promote balance.If you are a Vata or a Pitta type, and you find that the liquid diet is makingyou uncomfortable, try including boiled milk or lassi. If you still experiencediscomfort, modify the procedure by eating a light but solid evening mealinstead of remaining on only liquids until bedtime. Occasionally, even with thisalteration, some people find the liquid diet too difficult to follow withoutencountering problems. If this is your experience, just skip this techniqueentirely.If you can gradually incorporate all the methods presented in this chapter forpreserving and strengthening digestion, you will soon notice dramaticimprovement in your energy levels. Use the Body Intelligence TechniquesChecklist in this chapter to help make the techniques part of your everydayroutine. Remember to start with the ideas that seem easiest for you, and thenadd a new one each week. But try to implement the last threerecommendations—lunch as the major meal, the thermos of hot water, and theliquid diet—as soon as possible. Many people notice rapid benefits from these.The benefits should be made apparent as you continue to use the Energy TrackingChart in chapter 1 throughout the day.Having considered the importance of good digestion in eliminating fatigue, we’renow ready to discuss the various foods that should be emphasized and avoided.There’s no doubt that certain foods are natural energizers while others areinherently fatigue-producing. We’ll consider this important topic in the nextchapter."},{"pageContent":"image [images/Chop_9780307419958_epub_014_r1.jpg]DIET AND ENERGYAlthough the quality of your digestion is of primary importance for creatinghealthy levels of energy, the selection of foods you eat every day is alsoextremely significant for combatting fatigue and maintaining overall health.This is the subject of our first diet-related Primary Energy Principle. Pleasewrite it in your notes:PEP 12. Certain foods are natural energizers, while others can dull the body andthe mind, and produce fatigue. The effect of a given food depends on itsinherent qualities, as well as how it was obtained, prepared, and consumed.Think for a moment about the kinds of foods you’ve eaten during the past fewdays. Did these include leftovers or fast foods? If so, you’ve been sacrificingenergy and health for the sake of convenience, and you’ve been denying importantnutritional benefits to your body. This is because leftover or highly processedfoods lack freshness and, according to Ayurveda, lack vital energy as well. Theyare so removed from the sources of vitality in nature that they often do littlemore than create lethargy and inertia. And because such foods are more difficultto digest, they easily lead to the formation of ama.Once a food has been cooked, you should make every effort to eat it within fouror five hours at most. After that time, any food tends to become dull and inert.Our contemporary practice of cooking food, eating some of it, refrigerating therest, and then warming it again later is neither natural nor healthy from anAyurvedic perspective. Of course, it’s difficult to avoid leftovers if yourlifestyle really depends on them, but I strongly urge you to reduce anydependence on reheated meals and to increase the proportion of freshly preparedfood in your diet. Frozen foods are also less than ideal, although they occupy aslightly different category than leftovers. Supermarket vegetables that havebeen frozen raw, for example, have much more vital energy than reheatedvegetables. But the best foods are those that are freshest. Although all freshfoods have an energizing effect, it’s especially beneficial to include freshfruit and freshly squeezed juices in your diet. Carrot juice and beet juice areparticularly good energizers.ENERGY-PRODUCING FOODSIn Ayurveda, there is a word that describes naturally energizing foods; they arecalled sattvic. Foods that produce dullness and inertia are called tamasic.Foods that are considered especially rich in natural energy, and are thereforeespecially useful for alleviating fatigue, include the following:Fresh fruits and vegetablesWhole milk, or ghee (clarified butter)Wheat and wheat products, including breads and pastasRice, barley, and honeyRaisins, dates, figs, and almondsOlive oilMung beans, and especially mung soup, which is called dhal in AyurvedaThese are by no means the only foods that create energy, and you will almostcertainly want to include others in your diet. It is worth noting, however, thata complete and nutritious diet— a sattvic diet—can be constructed solely fromthe foods on this list.VegetablesAlthough Ayurveda definitely advocates eating fresh fruits and vegetables,\"fresh\" does not mean \"raw.\" I recommend cooking vegetables because cookingimproves their digestibility. Raw vegetables are relatively hard for the body toprocess, so their vitamins and minerals are unlikely to be properly assimilated.But if you do like to eat raw vegetables, the best time to do so is at thebeginning of lunch, when the digestive fire is at its highest. Eating a rawsalad with lunch will also provide dietary fiber and help tone the wholedigestive tract. At other times during the day cooked vegetables are best.Vegetables that grow above the earth and are completely exposed to sunlight areconsidered more energizing than those growing below the ground. Two exceptionsto this rule are carrots and beets, which are considered very good energizers.Other beneficial vegetables include all the green leafy varieties, fresh herbssuch as parsley and basil, and mung bean sprouts. I particularly recommendfavoring such vegetables in your lunchtime salad, and in cooked form at othertimes of the day.Dairy ProductsAyurveda teaches that milk should be boiled in order to make it more easilydigestible. Drinking cold milk can produce a variety of problems, includingmucous congestion, diarrhea, and other symptoms that are commonly called \"milkallergy.\" Milk is a very sattvic food, however, and can provide excellent energyvalue. Try adding a few pinches of fresh grated ginger to your milk beforeboiling. Or you can use two pinches of turmeric spice, and then, after it’scooled a bit, sweeten the milk with a little honey or sugar.There’s no doubt that improving your digestion of milk can provide access to anew source of energy and stamina. Try to get the freshest dairy productsavailable. Ayurveda recommends whole milk unless you have high cholesterol.Check with your doctor if you’re unsure about your cholesterol level.Ghee is clarified butter, which means that the butter has been purified byheating. It is considered in Ayurveda to be an extremely energizing substance.You can use ghee instead of butter on toast or other foods, and it also makes anexcellent cooking oil because it does not burn. A small to moderate amount ofghee in your diet will help improve your absorption and assimilation of food. Ifcholesterol is a problem, you should avoid ghee or use it only in very smallamounts.Ghee can be purchased in health food stores and in many groceries. Or you canmake it yourself, using the following recipe:HOW TO PREPARE GHEEIn a deep stainless steel pan, place one or more pounds of unsalted butter overmedium-to-low heat. Watch closely that the butter doesn’t scorch while melting.As the butter heats, its water content will boil away. After thirty to fortyminutes, milk solids will appear on the surface of the liquid and at the bottomof the pan.As the milk solids turn golden brown at the bottom of the pan, remove the liquidghee from the heat. Be careful that the ghee doesn’t burn. The ghee may smelllike popcorn at this point, and you might notice tiny bubbles rising from thebottom.Cover a stainless steel strainer with a cotton cloth, and pour the ghee throughit while it’s still hot. Use a stainless steel or glass bowl to catch the gheeas it pours through the strainer.It is not necessary to refrigerate ghee, but you may if you wish.YOGURTYogurt can also be an energizing food, but freshness is extremely important.Since it becomes increasingly tamasic and ama-producing as it sits on the shelf,the best yogurt is that which you make yourself at home. This is much simplerthan it sounds. Yogurt makers are available in many stores and it takes onlyabout five minutes in the evening to make a batch of yogurt that will be freshfor eating the next day. Here is the procedure:HOW TO MAKE YOGURTPurchase an electric yogurt maker that maintains a constant temperature. Chooseone that has several small cups rather than a single large container, and besure it includes a thermometer. Then buy whole cow’s milk from the grocery storeto use as a starter.Measure one cup of milk for every ¾ cup of yogurt that you plan to use thefollowing day. Pour the milk into a stainless steel pan, and boil it briefly.You can add a few slices of fresh ginger to make the milk more digestible.Using a thermometer, let the milk cool to between 106 and 110 degrees. Then pourthe milk into the cups of the yogurt maker, and add about ¼ tablespoon of yogurtto each cup. Do not stir.Plug in the yogurt maker. It usually takes about nine hours for the yogurt toset. Follow the directions that come with your yogurt maker.Each day, save part of your yogurt as a starter for your next batch. Plan tomake fresh yogurt daily. The best time to start is around 9:00 P.M., so theyogurt can sit overnight and be ready the next morning.HerbsIn Ayurveda, certain herbs are known to have unique energizing and revitalizingproperties. These herbs are combined according to specific traditional formulasto create compounds known as rasayanas. Knowledge of rasayanas is an ancientpart of the Ayurvedic mind/body system, and they are described in detail in theclassical texts. Rasayana compounds were used by the ancient kings and rishis(sages) of India to promote long life and vitality.Much knowledge of rasayanas became lost or misunderstood during the centurieswhen India was occupied by foreign governments. During this period Ayurveda wasactively suppressed. Now, however, formulas for some of the most importantclassical rasayanas have been restored, and these preparations are now beingcreated according to the traditional recipes. The most important of thesecompounds is called Biochavan. It comes in two forms: an herbal jam, and anherbal tablet. Both of these preparations have a strengthening and balancingeffect on the entire system. I recommend that you consider taking theserasayanas as an optional but valuable supplement to the other ideas andtechniques presented here. Information on obtaining rasayanas can be found inthe sources at the end of this book.ENERGY-DEPLETING FOODSFoods that reduce energy—tamasic foods—may be difficult to digest, or they maycontain some inherently fatigue-producing toxins. Ayurveda considers the foodsbelow to have an energy-depleting effect:Red meat, including beef, pork, and vealAged or fermented foods, including aged or sour cheeses, and pickled or smokedfoodsOnions, garlic, and mushroomsPotatoes and other vegetables that grow below the ground. Carrots and beets areexceptions.Refined sugar, alcohol, and coffeeRed Meat and Other Meat ProductsIt’s significant that the first item on the tamasic food list is red meat.Because fruits and vegetables are considered to be purer and more energizingthan animal foods, Ayurveda teaches that diet should come from vegetarian foodsources. These sources provide greater vitality for a very simple reason: theyare lower on the food chain and closer to the sun, which is the original sourceof energy in food.There is considerable loss of energy when vegetable foods are consumed byanimals and converted into meat. In simple grains, for example, energy value isabout seven times more concentrated than in meat from the animals who ate thosegrains. So if you want to feed a hog enough to create one unit of pork for humanconsumption, you must use seven units of grain to create that one unit of pork.Researchers have estimated that if the American public—who are the largestconsumers of meat in the world—were to reduce their consumption of meat by even10 percent, this would liberate sufficient resources of grain to feed all theworld’s starving people and to completely eliminate famine from the earth.On a more individual level, studies have shown that vegetarians have greaterstamina and long-term energy than meat eaters. Incidence of colon cancer and anumber of other malignancies is lower in individuals who follow a vegetariandiet. And vegetarians have a sharply lower incidence of obesity, which is amajor risk factor for hypertension, diabetes, and many other diseases. Whileanimal foods contain toxins and metabolic waste products from the animal’s ownbodily processes, vegetarian foods are easier to digest because plants lack thecomplex physiologies of cattle or pigs. All in all, it’s an inescapableconclusion that vegetarian foods are healthier and more efficient energy sourcesthan animal foods.One important recommendation of this chapter, therefore, is that you try toeliminate red meat from your diet altogether. Start by reducing the number ofmeals that include beef, pork, or veal, and try to substitute poultry, fish, orvegetarian foods. If you have already eliminated red meat from your diet or eatit only rarely, take the next step by reducing consumption of meat in any form,including poultry and seafood. Once you succeed in making several days each weekcompletely meatless, I predict that you’ll want to move toward a vegetariandiet, but this should be done at your own pace and according to your own day byday experience. By continuing to use your Energy Tracking Chart, you can see howreducing meat affects your energy levels. And remember that the Ayurvedicdefinition of a meatless diet does not exclude most dairy products. By addingmilk, cottage cheese, yogurt, or lassi to your meals, you can easily createnutritious, delicious, but meat-free eating habits.Other Energy DepressersAged or fermented foods have by definition undergone a prolonged devitalizingprocess, and these foods tend to depress the level of energy in your body. Tryto reduce or avoid them, particularly sour cheeses such as Swiss and cheddar.You should also try to become somewhat discriminating about sugar. While sugarhas a deservedly bad reputation among health-conscious people, the real problemis with highly refined sugar rather than the natural raw variety. Processingremoves certain important organic constituents that buffer the effect of sugaron your body; as a result, refined sugar is absorbed too rapidly or in a tooconcentrated form. This produces a physiological imbalance in the form of a\"sugar high,\" which is soon followed by \"post-sugar fatigue.\" Raw sugar,however, makes an excellent natural sweetener, especially when eaten in moderateamounts.Like refined sugar, coffee and alcohol also provide a brief energy lift thatsoon changes to fatigue. Both these substances foster Vata imbalances withprolonged use. It’s best to avoid alcohol altogether and to drink no more thanone cup of coffee per day. If you feel in need of more coffee, try to substituteone of the many varieties of herbal tea.Don’t try to withdraw suddenly from each and every energy-depleting food. Reduceyour consumption gradually, one food at a time, while keeping track of how youfeel. Your increased energy will be so reinforcing that you’ll naturally want tomove toward a healthier diet. If you find yourself wanting one of the foods inthe de-energizing category, try to eat it only at lunch time, when the digestivefire is sharpest and your body has its greatest ability to assimilate foods withmildly toxic properties. Red meat or aged cheese, for example, have a much moredraining effect on your system if eaten at night than at midday.VITAMINSMany people with chronic fatigue look for relief in commercially producedvitamins and other food supplements. Yet all natural vitamins and minerals areamply available in well-balanced meals. Moreover, vitamins and minerals don’tact alone; they work in concert with one another and with other organiccomponents found in foods. If you isolate a few substances and take them in theform of a tablet or a syrup, you’ll be unlikely to obtain the balancedproportion of these nutrients that nature intended. You may even cause someadditional imbalance. It’s much safer and more effective to get your nutritionfrom natural food sources, and it’s also considerably less expensive.THE SIX TASTESIn Ayurveda, the taste of food is an important indicator of its effect on thedoshas and, therefore, on the whole mind/body system. Taste, after all, is thecentral experience of eating. Animals in the wild rely on taste (along withsmell, which is closely related to taste) for their eating cues. They don’t knowanything about the U.S. Recommended Daily Allowance for calcium, iron, andprotein, yet they survive with only taste to guide them toward a balanced diet.This is a subject that has been largely overlooked by modern nutrition, butAyurveda emphasizes the role of taste in creating dietary balance.Ayurveda recognizes six basic tastes in food. In order to have a completelybalanced diet, you should experience each of these six tastes every day, andideally at every meal. Each taste is an important stimulus to the doshas;absence of any one of them will eventually create an imbalance in the system.The six tastes and some examples are:Sweet: sugar, milk, butter, rice, bread pastaSour: yogurt, lemon, cheeseSalty: saltPungent: Spicy foods, ginger, hot peppersBitter: Spinach, other green leafy vegetables, turmericAstringent: beans, lentils, pomegranateIt should be obvious that the modern American diet provides plenty of sweet,sour, and salty tastes, but it is relatively weak in pungent, bitter, andastringent. By eating larger quantities of vegetables, many health-consciouspeople are now including more of the bitter and astringent tastes in theirmeals, but it’s important to recognize that pungent or spicy foods are alsoessential to some extent. Such foods are especially valuable because theyenliven metabolism, and ginger is even called the \"universal medicine\" inAyurveda because of its effect in stimulating the digestive fire.The Ayurvedic viewpoint on the six tastes is summarized by our next PrimaryEnergy Principle:PEP 13. Variety is the spice of life, and including all six tastes in the dailydiet is crucial to creating balance and energy.DIET, DIGESTION, AND THE DOSHASSo far, the recommendations in this chapter apply to everyone regardless of bodytype. However, some individual foods can be beneficial or detrimental to Vata,Pitta, and Kapha, and familiarity with these foods can be very important toanyone experiencing chronic fatigue. The following PEP expresses this principle:PEP 14. Because of the principle of biological individuality, different foodscreate balance or imbalance for different people, depending on their body type.VATA-BALANCING FOODSYou’ll recall that Vata is described as \"airy and windy.\" It also has qualitiesof lightness, coldness, roughness, dryness, quickness, and changeability. Tohelp balance Vata, we need foods of the opposite qualities—foods that are warm,heavy, and oily. Foods of sweet or sour taste also tend to have a balancingeffect on Vata.To create a Vata-balancing diet, follow the chart below.VATA-BALANCING DIETFavor foods that are warm, heavy, and oily. Minimize foods that are cold, dry,and light.Favor foods that are sweet, sour, and salty. Minimize foods that are spicy,bitter, and astringent.Eat larger quantities, but not more than you can digest easily.SOME SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONSDairy. All dairy products pacify Vata.Sweeteners. All sweeteners are good (in moderation) for pacifying Vata.Oils. All oils reduce Vata.Grains. Rice and wheat are very good. Reduce barley, corn, millet, buckwheat,rye, and oats.Fruits. Favor sweet, sour, or heavy fruits, such as oranges, bananas, avocados,grapes, cherries, peaches, melons, berries, plums, pineapples, mangoes, andpapayas. Reduce dry or light fruits, such as apples, pears, pomegranates, andcranberries.Vegetables. Beets, cucumbers, carrots, asparagus, and sweet potatoes are good.They should be eaten cooked, not raw. The following vegetables are acceptable inmoderate quantities if they’re cooked, especially with ghee or oil andVata-reducing spices: peas, broccoli, cauliflower, celery, zucchini, and greenleafy vegetables. It’s better to avoid sprouts and cabbage.Spices. Cardamom, cumin, ginger, cinnamon, salt, cloves, mustard seed, and smallquantities of black pepper are good.Nuts. All nuts are good.Beans. Reduce all beans, except for tofu and split-mung bean soup.Meat and fish (for nonvegetarians). Chicken, turkey, and seafoods are all right.Beef should be avoided.PITTA-BALANCING FOODSPitta is like fire. Its qualities are hot, sharp, slightly oily, and acidic.Foods that balance Pitta are cool but not cold, neither excessively oily nordry, and neither extremely pungent nor sour. Very sour or fermented foods suchas vinegar or certain citrus fruits are especially destabilizing to Pittabecause of their acidic properties. Sour cheeses are also in this category, andeven yogurt can be too sour for most Pitta types when eaten plain. For Pittas,yogurt is best taken in the form of lassi. Tomatoes and tomato sauces can alsocause a marked increase in Pitta dosha.To create a Pitta-balancing diet, follow the chart below.PITTA-BALANCING DIETFavor foods that are cool and liquid. Minimize foods that are hot intemperature.Favor tastes that are sweet, bitter, or astringent. Minimize spicy, salty, orsour tastes.SOME SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONSDairy. Milk, butter, and ghee are good for pacifying Pitta. Reduce yogurt,cheese, sour cream, and cultured buttermilk (as their sour tastes aggravatePitta).Sweeteners. All sweeteners are good except honey and molasses.Oils. Olive, sunflower, and coconut oils are best. Reduce sesame, almond, andcorn oil, all of which increase Pitta.Grains. Wheat, white rice, barley, and oats are good. Reduce corn, rye, millet,and brown rice.Fruits. Favor sweet fruits, such as grapes, cherries, melons, berries, avocados,coconuts, pomegranates, mangoes, and sweet, fully ripened oranges, pineapples,and plums. Reduce sour fruits, such as grapefruits, olives, papayas, persimmons,and sour, unripe oranges, pineapples, and plums.Vegetables. Favor asparagus, cucumbers, potatoes, sweet potatoes, pumpkins,broccoli, cauliflower, celery, okra, lettuce, beans, green beans, zucchini, andgreen leafy vegetables such as lettuce. Reduce hot peppers, tomatoes, carrots,beets, onions, garlic, radishes, spinach, and mustard greens.Beans. Reduce all beans, except tofu and split-mung dhal.Spices. Cinnamon, coriander, cardamom, and fennel are good. But the followingspices strongly increase Pitta and should be eaten only in small amounts:ginger, cumin, black pepper, fenugreek, clove, celery seed, salt, and mustardseed. Chili peppers and cayenne should be avoided.Meat and fish (for nonvegetarians). Chicken, pheasant, and turkey arepreferable. Beef, seafood, and egg yolk increase Pitta and should be avoided.KAPHA-BALANCING FOODSKapha is the earthy and watery dosha. It is heavy, stable, oily, slow, dull, andsweet. Foods that balance Kapha are light and dry, and the pungent, bitter, andastringent tastes are especially helpful for waking up and balancing Kaphadosha. Grains such as barley, millet, and corn are very beneficial, as are greenleafy vegetables and almost all spices. But heavy, oily, and cold foods tend toaggravate Kapha.If Kapha is your principal dosha, consult this chart in formulating your diet.KAPHA-BALANCING DIETFavor foods that are light, dry, and warm. Minimize foods that are heavy, oily,and cold.Favor foods that are spicy, bitter, and astringent. Minimize foods that aresweet, salty, and sour.SOME SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONSDairy. In general, avoid dairy products, except low-fat milk.Fruits. Lighter fruits, such as apples and pears, are best. Reduce heavy or sourfruits, such as oranges, bananas, pineapples, figs, dates, avocados, coconuts,and melons, since these fruits increase Kapha.Sweeteners. Honey is excellent for reducing Kapha. Reduce sugar products, asthese increase Kapha.Beans. All beans are fine except tofu, which increases Kapha.Nuts. Reduce all nuts.Grains. Most grains are fine, especially barley and millet. Avoid wheat andrice, as they increase Kapha.Vegetables. All are fine, except tomatoes, cucumbers, sweet potatoes, andzucchini, as they all increase Kapha.Spices. All spices are good except salt, which should be avoided, as itincreases Kapha.Meat and fish (for nonvegetarians). White meat from chicken or turkey is fine,as is seafood. Reduce red meat.TASTE AND THE DOSHASJust as certain foods have a balancing effect on specific body types, thevarious tastes can do so as well. The chart below describes the effects of eachtaste on the doshas.image [images/Chop_9780307419958_epub_015_r1.jpg]Remember the guiding principle of trying to experience all six tastes every day,ideally at every meal. But there’s no need to become anxious or rigid about it.Just use this information to help enhance your enjoyment of food.Above all, you should have fun with your diet and with all theserecommendations. Worrying about dietary rules will certainly not help yourproblem of fatigue, and could even exacerbate it. Your own tastes andpreferences will provide excellent directions as to which foods your mind/bodysystem needs, and as you come more into balance, you’ll be increasingly able totrust your internal signals. As you grow in self-awareness, your enjoyment offood and of life in general will grow as well.In closing, here’s a brief summary of the recommendations made in this chapter.Learn to recognize energizing and energy-depleting foods. Begin orienting yourdiet toward the former and away from the latter.Become familiar with the six tastes and begin to incorporate them into yourdaily diet, ideally at every meal.Read over the dosha-balancing diets provided in this chapter. Start bringingyour diet into line with your body type. Try making a list of some foods youlike that are beneficial to your dosha, and plan some meals that include these.Continue to track your energy by completing an Energy Tracking Chart each day.Note any relationships between your eating experiences and your energy levels.Most important, have fun with the knowledge you’ve gained and enjoy eating!"},{"pageContent":"image [images/Chop_9780307419958_epub_016_r1.jpg]ELIMINATING FATIGUE BY REDUCING STRESSSo far we’ve been looking at biological causes of chronic fatigue, but there’sevidence that the mind is an even more important influence in creating thisproblem. In chapter 1, I referred to a study published in the Journal of theAmerican Medical Association that considered more than one thousand peoplesuffering from chronic fatigue. Despite thorough physical examinations and bloodtests, only a small minority of these people were found to have any physicalabnormalities. But 80 percent of the chronic fatigue patients displayedrecognizable symptoms of anxiety or depression.YOUR BODY’S INTERNAL PHARMACYThe explanation for this once again can be found in the notion of a mind/bodyconnection. This phenomenon is so obvious that it’s amazing how modern medicinehas managed to overlook it to a great extent. Now, however, the important roleof neurochemicals and neuropeptides in physiology is finally beginning to beunderstood. These substances are brought into being whenever you have a thoughtor emotion. They then circulate throughout the body and adhere to every organsystem. They are especially drawn to the digestive tract and to immune systemcells, where they can have powerful energizing or energy-depleting effects.Neurochemicals are often very powerful drugs. The category of neurochemicalscalled endorphins, for example, discovered about twenty years ago, are naturalpainkillers produced by the brain. The word endorphin, derived from the Greek,literally means \"internally produced morphine,\" and the comparison betweenendorphins and morphine is by no means an exaggeration. Morphine is probably themost powerful painkilling drug used in medicine; it is a narcotic opiate closelyrelated to heroin. But many endorphins are fifty to one hundred times morepowerful than morphine. It is amazing to think that the body can produce such apotent painkiller, and yet it does so all the time in very small amounts, oreven in larger amounts if acute pain is present.Endorphins are one example of literally thousands of naturally occurringbiochemicals that the brain produces in order to create health and healing. Thegreat advantage of these natural, internally produced chemicals over drugs thatyou buy in a pharmacy is that our own neurochemicals are produced in just theright amount, at just the right time, in response to the body’s perception ofpain or some other biological need. And there are no side effects to thesenatural biochemicals, since they are part of the body’s own natural healingsystem.Just as it contains potent painkillers, the brain’s natural pharmacy alsocontains compounds to reestablish balance in all the body’s major systems,including its energy systems. Learning how to use the brain’s pharmacy properlyis literally the key to perfect health. By gaining mastery in this area, you’llbe able to produce compounds that enhance your body’s vital systems much moreeffectively than any pep pill or stimulant could. Of course, you’ll also be ableto shut down production of any neurochemicals that weaken the body’senergy-producing and healing capabilities.The brain’s neurochemical production is controlled by the mind. Balance of mindwill produce balance of the brain’s chemistry, which will in turn promoteoptimum functioning of the body’s energy systems. But how does one createbalance of mind? The first step, and probably the most important, is to reduceand eliminate stress.STRESS, DIGESTION, AND IMMUNE RESPONSEStress has become a familiar term. It calls up images of being caught on anexpressway at rush hour, of hurrying to meet dead-lines, of angry words anddisappointments. Ayurveda defines stress as an \"undue pressure of experience.\"This takes place when the mind/body system is subjected to events that it is notprepared to handle in a balanced and integrated way. The pressure of thisexperience has an overpowering influence on the physiology. We generally thinkof stress as being caused by unpleasant situations, but even a positiveexperience can impose \"undue pressure\" on the system. If you were informed thatyou’d just won twenty million dollars in the lottery, your heart would start torace, your blood pressure would shoot up, and you would break out inperspiration. These are signs of a stress reaction, and they’re alsomanifestations of the mind/body connection—a purely physiological event hasproduced an immediate biological effect on the body. Psychologists call this the\"fight-or-flight response,\" a term that may be familiar to you. In thefight-or-flight response, fear or anxiety gives rise to neurochemicals thatcirculate throughout the body and affect many different systems. In addition toincreased heart rate, digestion shuts down and there may be a feeling of nauseaas blood is shunted away from the stomach and intestines and into the muscles.Your hair may even stand on end.The fight-or-flight response is a huge energy drain on the body. Even smallversions of the response can take a toll, and these are elicited every dayduring the normal course of events. When life starts to feel like a constantbattle, you can be sure that miniature versions of the fight-or-flight responseare continually being elicited throughout the body.In short, stress changes the body’s ability to function efficiently. Long-termstress undermines the crucial energy-producing activities of digestion andelimination, and evidence for this can be found in common expressions like \"Mystomach was tied up in knots\" or \"I had a lump in my throat.\" If the body isconstantly mobilizing energy into the muscles to deal with perceived crises,there is little strength left to process food. Chronic fatigue is the inevitableresult.In addition to its effects on digestion, stress weakens the immune system.Neurochemicals called immunomodulators are produced in the brain and have adirect impact on the functioning of immune system cells. More specifically,immunomodulators produced during the fight-or-flight response depressphysiological defense systems so that individuals under chronic stress haveweaker immunity than others. There has been considerable research seeking tolink weakened immune response to Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, the severe form offatigue discussed in chapter 1.PEP number 15 summarizes the relationship between stress and fatigue:PEP 15. The stress response is a major factor in producing chronic fatigue. Itdoes so by interfering with the body’s energy-producing systems, especiallydigestion, and by weakening immune system defenses.MEDITATION AND REDUCED STRESSStress can be eliminated by providing the system with experiences that areopposite to stress, such as deep relaxation, rejuvenating exercise, and rest.The techniques on the following pages are simple but very powerful means foraccomplishing this.The many benefits of meditation have been verified in study after study, andmillions of people around the world can attest to the positive effects of thispractice. Some forms of meditation include the use of mantras; these areprimordial sounds that are subvocally repeated as a way of bringing heightenedawareness to the mind. Primordial sound meditation is taught at the Center forMind/Body Medicine in California and by other authorities, but it is far fromthe only useful meditation technique. The breathing meditation described belowis easy to learn without outside instruction, and it provides extremely valuablestress-reducing benefits.Breathing MeditationSet aside a time when you can be free from interruptions and responsibilities.Find a quiet room away from traffic noise or other distractions. Sit quietly onthe floor or in a straight-back chair, and close your eyes.Breathe normally, but as you exhale and inhale begin gradually directing yourawareness toward your breathing. Without trying to control or influence it inany way, become aware of the coming and going of your breath.If you notice your breath getting faster or slower, or even stopping altogetherfor a moment, just observe this without resistance or encouragement. Allow it tostabilize by itself.If your thoughts distract you or you become unfocused in any way, don’t resist.Just allow your attention to come back naturally to your breathing.Continue this meditation for fifteen minutes. Then, still sitting with your eyesclosed, allow another few minutes for gradual return to everyday consciousness.As you gain experience with this technique, you’ll find your thoughts becomingprogressively quieter during meditation. Ultimately, your mind can settle downcompletely, enabling you to access the thoroughly tranquil state that precedeseveryday thought. This sense of pure relaxation can be extremely important andvaluable. Experiencing it on a regular basis will be tremendously beneficial inreducing stress and the fatigue that almost always accompanies it.Use the Breathing Meditation twice a day, in the morning and the evening. Justas you’ve been doing with the changes in your diet, note the effects ofmeditation on your Energy Tracking Chart. Meditation is one of the safest andmost effective methods for reducing stress and restoring energy, and the smallamount of discipline it requires is sure to be greatly rewarded.NEUROMUSCULAR AND NEURORESPIRATORY INTEGRATIONIn addition to meditation, neuromuscular and neurorespiratory integration aremind/body techniques that can be extremely effective in reducing stress andfatigue.Neuromuscular integration consists of a set of yoga stretching exercises thatenergize the relationships among the mind, the nervous system, and the otherprocesses in the body. These are not exercises in the usual sense, which denotesstrenuous physical activity. Neuromuscular integration is a more subtlepractice, which is in fact quite effortless, and it works by enlivening certainvital points in the physiology that Ayurveda calls marmas.There are 108 of these marma points, which are like control switches fordirecting energy and biological intelligence to various parts of the body. Thepurpose of the techniques presented here is to integrate the functioning of allthe marma points in the body. When this takes place, a uniform and balanced flowof energy is established throughout the whole physiological system.Neuromuscular Integration ExercisesThe simple yoga postures that follow help restore mind/body coordination andbalance at all levels. Each of the postures stretches a separate part of thebody, thereby enlivening the marma present in the different areas. A key factabout neuromuscular integration is its mind/body character: the mental componentof the activity is as important as the physical. It’s very important to hold theposture for the recommended time period. While holding it, allow your awarenessto rest easily on the area of the body that is being stretched. This will mostlikely happen by itself. You don’t have to concentrate—just let your attentionnaturally gravitate to the area that’s being exercised, and this will awaken themarma points in that area. The principle here is that of our first PrimaryEnergizing Principle: Attention has organizing power. With the help of yourattention, you can enlist the power of your body’s natural healing mechanisms.You should never allow yourself to feel any strain during these exercises. Ifyou find that any of the postures are difficult or painful to achieve, youshould avoid those exercises completely or perform them only in a limited way,stretching just to the point where you feel comfortable pressure but not strain.If you have any question about your ability to perform any or all of thepostures without discomfort, it’s best to consult a physician before proceeding.If you are in an older age group, or if you have any acute or chronic muscle,joint, or skeletal problems—chronic neck or back pain, for example—again itwould be best to consult your doctor before undertaking the postures. Barringany of these conditions, you can do the neuromuscular integration exercises onceor twice a day. The whole program takes about ten minutes to perform.Begin by carefully reading these guidelines.Be careful not to stretch farther than your body can easily accept. Theillustrations depict the ideal execution of each posture, but you should stretchonly to comfortable limits. With time, your flexibility will improve. If evenminimal performance of a certain posture causes pain or discomfort, omit thatposture. If you have back pain, or other chronic or acute muscular or skeletalproblems, consult your physician before proceeding.If you feel you can’t bend a particular part of your body, don’t force your bodyby swinging. Just bend to the extent you can, without force.Hold each posture for the time indicated, and then release it easily. Breathenaturally during the exercises. Don’t hold your breath.Wear comfortable, loose clothing. Use a folded blanket, rug, or exercise mat tocushion a bare floor.Don’t perform the postures on a full stomach. Wait at least two or three hoursafter eating.Allow your awareness to gravitate to the area that is being stretched. Yourattention will naturally be drawn to that part of your body. By allowing it torest there, you’ll gain maximum benefit from the exercise.These exercises take only about five minutes if you perform each posture once.If you have time, you can repeat each pose up to three times before starting thenext one.Be sure to perform the exercises in the order given, as each pose is designed toprepare your body for the next one.1. TONING-UP EXERCISESThis two-minute body massage gently increases circulation, moving your blood inthe direction of your heart.Sit comfortably.

AWARENESS POSEThis soothing pose eliminates fatigue and rejuvenates the body and mind.Lie on your back, allowing your arms to rest easily by your sides with yourpalms up.Allow your body to relax. Close your eyes and let your awareness be easily drawnto any part of your body or to your body as a whole.Rest for at least one minute, breathing easily and naturally.image [images/Chop_9780307419958_epub_032_r1.jpg]Neurorespiratory IntegrationBreathing is every bit as important as digestion in the production ofphysiological energy, because energy is produced when oxygen is combined withfood. Therefore the quality of our respiration is very influential in howenergetic we feel. When breathing is balanced and relaxed, it promotes vitalitythroughout the system. But if respiration is shallow or unbalanced, the bodydoesn’t get the full complement of vital energy it needs.Ayurveda recognizes the important relationship between breathing and vitality.The Ayurvedic word Prana means \"vital breath,\" and a whole area of Ayurvedicscience, called Pranayam is devoted to creating balanced respiration. The morespecific term Pranayama refers to neurorespiratory integration exercises thathelp to develop good breathing habits.The Pranayama technique introduced here is easy to perform, takes only aboutfive minutes, and can be an excellent revitalizer. It involves alternating yourbreathing between each nostril. During the practice of this technique, youshould breathe a little more deeply and a little more slowly than you do duringnormal restful breathing. Some people may find it a bit confusing at first, soplease read the instructions carefully:Sit easily and comfortably with your spine as straight as possible.Close your eyes and rest your left hand on your knee. For this part of theexercise you will be using your thumb and the middle and ring fingers of yourright hand.Using your right thumb, close off your right nostril. Then, through your leftnostril, inhale slowly and easily.Now use your ring and middle fingers to close your left nostril as you exhaleslowly through your right. Then inhale easily.Continue breathing through alternate nostrils for about five minutes. Yourbreathing may be slightly slower and deeper than usual, but it should be naturaland unforced.When you’re done, sit quietly for a few minutes as you breathe easily andnormally.This neuromuscular integration technique balances air flow between the left andright hemispheres of the brain, thus integrating mind and body. Modernphysiology has revealed that the two hemispheres have very different functions:the left relates principally to linear reasoning and to linguistic andmathematical skills, while the right controls imaginative and intuitivefunctions such as spatial orientation and creative thinking. Stimulation of theinner lining of the nostrils by alternating the air flow sends sequentialimpulses to the two brain hemispheres. This helps to integrate their respectivefunctions and to produce neurophysiological balance. The ultimate effect is towake up the whole system, creating greater mental and physical energy.The techniques presented so far in this chapter should be undertaken in aspecific sequence. The neuromuscular integration exercises should be performedfirst, followed by the neurorespiratory technique. Breathing meditation shouldcome last. This creates a progression from a grosser level (the body) to a moresubtle level (breathing) to the most subtle level of all, which is the mind. Ifyou don’t have time for all three techniques in succession, you may of course doany one of them alone. If you have to choose, meditation would be the mostvaluable.AYURVEDIC OIL MASSAGEDaily oil massage is a traditional part of the Ayurvedic routine. The massagetakes roughly five to ten minutes, and it should be performed each morningbefore your shower or bath as a way of purifying and balancing the entirephysiology. It can even be done in as little as two or three minutes.The Ayurvedic oil massage balances Vata dosha throughout the system. BecauseVata is light, cold, and dry, a massage using warm oil can have a soothing andpacifying effect. This is significant because Vata is easily unbalanced bystress, and chronic fatigue soon results. In addition, the massage stimulatescirculation and helps remove impurities from the whole body.Here are the instructions for performing the Ayurvedic oil massage, togetherwith information on how to heat sesame oil, which Ayurveda considers to have auniquely balancing and vitalizing influence. Briefly heating the oil energizesit, helps to thin it out, and facilitates its absorption into the body. Be sureto follow the instructions carefully.How to Do Ayurvedic Oil MassageIt’s ideal to do Ayurvedic oil massage in the morning, before your shower orbath.Start with cold-pressed sesame oil, available from your health food store.Ideally, the oil should be cured (purified) before using. (Instructions forcuring are given below.) The oil should be warmed each day before you use it.One easy way to do this is to keep the oil in a small plastic bottle with aflip-top lid. Warm the oil by placing the bottle in a sink filled with hot waterfor a few minutes.Use the open part of your hand, rather than your fingertips, to massage yourentire body. In general, use circular motions over rounded areas (joints, head)and straight strokes over straight areas (neck, long bones). Apply moderatepressure over most of your body and light pressure over your abdomen and heart.Start with your head. Pour a small amount of oil on your hands and vigorouslymassage it into your scalp. With the flat part of your hands, use circularstrokes to cover your whole head. Spend more time massaging your head than otherparts of your body.Next, massage your face and outer ears, remembering to apply a small amount ofoil as you move from one part of your body to the next. Massage this area moregently.Massage the front and back of your neck and the upper part of your spine. Atthis point you may want to cover the rest of your body with a thin layer of oilto give it maximum time to soak in.Vigorously massage your arms, using a circular motion on your shoulders andelbows and long, back-and-forth strokes on your upper arms and forearms.Now massage your chest and stomach. Use a very gentle, circular motion over yourheart and abdomen. You can start in the lower right part of your abdomen andmove clockwise toward the lower left part, to gently massage your intestines.Massage your back and spine. You may have trouble reaching your entire back.Just do the best you can.Massage your legs vigorously, using circular motions over your hips, knees, andankles. Use long, straight strokes over your thighs and calves.Finally, massage the bottoms of your feet. As with your head, this importantarea of your body deserves more time. Use the palm of your hand to massage yoursoles vigorously.Follow your oil massage with a warm bath or shower, using a mild soap.How to Prepare Sesame Oil for Ayurvedic Oil MassageAyurveda recommends using unprocessed, cold-pressed sesame oil, which isavailable at health food stores. Before using the sesame oil, cure the oil byfollowing these simple steps. Curing increases the oil’s ability to penetratethe skin.Heat the oil to about the boiling temperature of water (212° F). To know whenthe oil is hot enough, simply add a single drop of water to the oil before youheat it. When the water crackles or boils on top of the oil, you can remove itfrom the heat. Or just observe the oil as it heats. When it begins to move andcirculate in the pan, remove it from the burner.If you like, you can cure up to one quart of oil at a time. This should beenough for at least two weeks.Caution: Because all oils are flammable, be sure to observe proper safetyprecautions. Use low rather than high heat, never leave the room while the oilis heating, and remove it promptly once the proper temperature is reached. Besure to store it in a safe place when cooling, out of reach of children.It’s best to perform the massage every day, but many people initially find thisdifficult. I recommend that you start with one or two mornings a week. As withother mind/body techniques, it’s likely that you’ll feel so much better on thedays when you’ve done the massage that you’ll begin doing it more and moreoften, until you spontaneously find yourself doing it every day.Please write down the following Primary Energy Principle, which summarizes theinformation in this chapter:PEP 16. To reduce fatigue, stress should be replaced by relaxation and rest.This can be accomplished through breathing meditation, neuromuscular andneurorespiratory integration techniques, and the Ayurvedic oil massage.Having given considerable attention to the very important relationship betweenenergy and the mind, we’ll now consider how physical activity can enliven ordeplete energy resources. This will be the subject of chapter 6."},{"pageContent":"image [images/Chop_9780307419958_epub_033_r1.jpg]USING NATURAL RHYTHMS TO CREATE ENERGYEvery human being is part of the natural continuum. Nature’s energy flowsthrough us, and if we are skillful partners with the universe that surrounds us,we can make good use of that infinite reservoir of vitality and strength.The intimate relationship between nature and each individual can be madedramatically clear through the study of biological rhythms. Ayurveda recognizedthousands of years ago that nature operates in cycles, and that these cycleshave a profound effect upon individual physiologies. More recently, modernphysiology has identified many of the rhythms that influence our mind/bodysystems. We actually have many different \"biological clocks\" within us, eachregulating different bodily functions according to precise time cycles. The mostimportant of our internal tempos is called \"circadian rhythm\" by modern science.This is a twenty-four-hour cycle that controls many important processes,including body temperature, the production of hormones and other biochemicals,and nervous system functions such as waking and sleeping. The circadian rhythmhas a number of important implications for chronic fatigue. The hormonecortisol, for example, which is produced by the adrenal glands, is a powerfulanti-stress agent. Its presence in the body rises and falls according to apredictable pattern within each twenty-four-hour period. Cortisol levels in theblood reach their peak at the start of the day, around 7:00 A.M. They’re at alow point in the late afternoon or early evening— a time when nature intends forour activities to ease off—and they remain low throughout the night. Bodytemperature follows a somewhat different twenty-four-hour cycle. It increasesthroughout the day, reaches a high point in the late afternoon or early evening,and then begins to decrease toward its low point a few hours after midnight.There are also monthly and seasonal biological rhythms, such as the femalemenstrual cycle. And there are even cycles that occur according to the ebb andflow of the ocean tides. In short, the laws that govern our physical andemotional ups and downs are fundamentally inseparable from the larger rhythms ofthe world and even of the cosmos. They are all expressions of the same unifiedfield of intelligence.As a result of biological rhythms, \"Timing is everything.\" There are times whenit’s appropriate to engage in certain activities, and other times when thosesame activities are likely to be unproductive. With regard to chronic fatigue,an activity performed at a particular hour may help to enhance energy andphysiological balance, while at a different time it could actually have aweakening effect.PEP 17. From a biological perspective, timing is everything. An activityperformed at a certain time may promote balance and energy, while at a differentmoment that same activity can create imbalance and fatigue.As the importance of biological rhythms has come to be recognized, it hascreated a whole new specialty in medical research known as chronobiology.Experiments in this field have confirmed the importance of proper timing.Studies in which mice have been exposed to high doses of radiation, for example,have demonstrated radically different survival rates depending on the time inwhich radiation was administered. These studies have important ramifications formany medical procedures, including X-rays and the chemical therapies used totreat cancer.Biological rhythms are like waves of nature that are constantly passing over us.As if riding a surfboard, you should time your activities to \"catch\" thesewaves, and then allow yourself to be carried along on their crests. This createsenergy and joy. Fighting the waves by challenging the natural cycles is liketrying to stand up on a surfboard at the wrong time. A \"wipeout\" isinevitable—and, in terms of your energy, wiped out is exactly how you’ll feel.DAILY ENERGY CYCLESAyurveda long ago evolved a view of an optimum daily routine that recognizes thevarious phases of the twenty-four-hour cycle—and as you might expect, thesephases are described in terms of Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. The alternatinginfluence of the three doshas during each day has a distinct effect on how youfeel and on how efficiently you’re able to perform any activity.As you can see, the Kapha influence is dominant from 6:00 A.M. untilmid-morning. Then Pitta is dominant until mid-afternoon, and you’ll recall thatthe digestive fire is at its peak during this time. This cycle of the doshasends with a primarily Vata influence from 2:00 P.M. until sunset, whereupon asecond cycle begins, which is similar to the first.image [images/Chop_9780307419958_epub_034_r1.jpg]image [images/Chop_9780307419958_epub_035_r1.jpg]So the twenty-four-hour day is divided into halves—daytime and nighttime—each ofwhich contains three phases of the doshas. Within each cycle, Kapha appearsfirst, then Pitta, and Vata last.The influence of these dosha periods is obvious in the natural environment. Inthe evening, after work is completed and as the sun is setting, there’s a senseof gathering silence, as if all of nature is settling down. There’s a noticeableimpulse to just sit back and relax as nightfall begins. Of course, if you livein a large metropolitan area you may wonder where this silence might be as youlook out on ceaseless urban activity. Such activity, however, does not springfrom any influence inherent in nature itself; rather, it is an artifact of thecontemporary lifestyle, which often brings us into direct conflict with nature.But if you allow yourself to follow the naturally ordained influence of Kaphathat dominates this period of the day, you’ll feel relaxed, heavy, and inclinedtoward sleep.Indeed, the ideal bedtime occurs at the junction point of the Kapha and Pittaperiods of the evening, at 10:00 P.M. If you postpone going to sleep much beyondthis point—beyond 11:00 P.M. for example—you’ll miss the rejuvenating rest thatbest begins at the end of the Kapha cycle. Sleep that begins later will belighter and imbued with restless Pitta qualities. Over time, a sleep cycle thatis out of harmony with basic natural rhythms will necessarily lead to chronicfatigue.Don’t underestimate the importance of the sleep cycle. It can be an extremelysignificant source of energy once it’s brought into balance.THE RHYTHMS OF SLEEPING AND WAKINGGoing to bed at the evening junction point of Kapha and Pitta is one of the keysto a balanced daily routine. Another equally important key is to wake up at theend of the Vata period in the morning, at the junction of Vata and Kapha. Thisoccurs at sunrise, or around 6:00 A.M. When you awaken at this time, your mindand body are under the influence of Vata qualities such as lightness, quickness,alertness, enthusiasm, and exhilaration. This is simply the right time to startthe day. But if you miss this natural waking point and sleep into the next phaseof the morning, you’ll wake up imbued with Kapha qualities of heaviness,dullness, and slowness. If this becomes your habitual sleep pattern, yourphysiological system will become chronically sluggish. There will be asmothering effect on all the body’s energy-producing systems.So you should go to bed early, and you should wake up early too. If this seemslike an impossible price to pay for overcoming chronic fatigue, let me offersome practical suggestions.First, recognize the obvious fact that your bedtime and your waking time aremutually dependent. In order to wake up early, it’s very helpful to have gone tobed before ten o’clock the night before, and an early bedtime depends uponhaving evening activities that are conducive to relaxation. As we’ve seen, thisis a time when nature intends us to ease off from strenuous activity in favor ofa more restful mode. Dinner should be a relatively light meal. It should beeaten early, ideally at about 6:00 P.M., or by 7:00 at the latest; digestionwill then be mostly completed by 10:00 P.M. Since digestion requires an increasein metabolism, it tends to disrupt sleep.After dinner, try to enjoy light activities such as reading, spending time withyour family, or talking with friends. Television is not particularly recommendedbecause the electronic visual stimulus of the TV screen is intrinsicallyexciting to the nervous system, even if the content of a program is low-key. Ifwatching TV in the evening is a daily ritual and it seems impossible to givethis up, at least try to avoid it after 8:30 or 9:00 P.M. This will give thesystem an hour to settle down before bedtime. Likewise, if you find that youmust do focused work at night, try to ease off such work by 9:00 P.M.Just before bed you may find it helpful to drink something that will calm Vatadosha. A little warm milk with some Vatapacifying herbs, such as a couple ofpinches of cardamom and a small bit of saffron, makes a very nice bedtime drink.Nutmeg is another widely available spice that can be used instead of cardamom.If you have a problem with milk digestion, remember to add a pinch or two offresh grated ginger prior to boiling the milk.Your bedroom should be a sleeping room; watching TV or working in the bedroomshould be avoided by all means. The decor of the bedroom should be restful,relaxing, and orderly, for a soothing influence on the system.If you’ve gotten into bed by 10:00 P.M. but find that you’re unable to sleep,resist the temptation to get up and read until you feel sleepier. Such anactivity would have an aggravating influence on Vata dosha and would throw thesystem further out of synchrony with nature. Instead, simply continue to restwith your eyes closed, and adopt what I call a \"not minding\" attitude. Thismeans recognizing that falling asleep is not really under your control, but iscompletely in nature’s hands. Trying to fall asleep only interferes with theprocess. Biological rhythms like falling asleep operate according to what modernscience calls the Law of Least Action: More activity on your part brings a lessdesirable result: So don’t think about the process, and turn your clock to thewall. Your body will still get valuable needed rest. Although the effects oflong-standing habits and disturbed biological rhythm may cause difficulty infalling asleep, it’s much better to be in bed with the lights out during thisearly part of the night than to be up and about. You may initially feeluncomfortable, but by continuing to let your body rest at this period in theevening you’ll soon begin to feel much better when you wake up. And your chronicfatigue will steadily improve as you grow accustomed to falling asleep duringthe Kapha period of the evening.You’ll most likely need an alarm clock in order to awaken at an early hour, atleast while your system is adjusting to the new schedule. Choose an alarm thatwon’t jolt you awake; I recommend a clock-radio tuned to a classical musicstation. Set the alarm for 6:00 A.M . or earlier, or 7:00 at the very latest.You should always get out of bed at this time, no matter how little sleep youthink you’ve gotten or how tired you feel. Just get on with your dailyactivities—studies show that sleep deprivation from insomnia rarely interfereswith most work-related tasks. Then, if you feel sufficiently tired in theevening, you’ll naturally want to go to bed early.In order to reset your biological clock in tune with natural rhythms, you mustfaithfully follow the plan of early-to-bed-early-to-rise. This includesweekends, holidays, and vacations, because even occasional wide variations inyour sleep schedule can unbalance biological rhythms.RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVING SLEEPSleeping in accord with natural cycles does more than provide extra rest; italso promotes what I call \"blissful sleep.\" Blissful sleep comes from living inharmony with nature, and it is deeply refreshing and rejuvenating for the wholehuman system. It strengthens all the body’s energy producing mechanisms, and itis one of your most valuable tools for ending chronic fatigue.Try going to bed by 10:00 P.M. and rising by 6:00 A.M. on a regular basis.To prepare your body for deep, restful sleep, follow these recommendations:Eat a light, early dinner—by 6:00 P.M. or 7:00 P.M. at the latest—so you cancompletely digest your food before you go to bed.Avoid focused work at night. Try to ease off by 9:00 P.M.Plan relaxed evening activities, ideally with family or friends. Avoid watchingTV, which overstimulates the nervous system.Drink warm milk before bed. If you wish, add soothing spices such as cardamom,nutmeg, or saffron, which pacify Vata dosha.Avoid working, reading, or watching TV in the bedroom, which should beexclusively for sleeping.If you can’t fall asleep immediately, adopt a calm \"not minding\" attitude. Don’tget out of bed. Even if you aren’t sleeping, your body is getting valuable rest.If your bedtime and waking times have become widely out of tune with naturalrhythms, try setting your alarm progressively earlier. Every three or four days,move your waking time ahead by ten or fifteen minutes. Gradually you’ll start tofeel sleepy earlier in the evening.ELIMINATIONWe’ve seen the importance of timing in fundamental processes such as digestionand sleep. We should also consider another basic biological function, that ofelimination. There’s no question that millions of people suffer fromirregularities in their bowel movements, and once again the reason for this isfound in the mind/body connection. More specifically, irregularity results fromthe effects of stress on gastrointestinal function.The best time to have a bowel movement is shortly after awakening. This allowsthe body to rid itself of impurities from the previous day, so that the newday’s activities are begun by a purified physiology.Even if you have had problems in this area for a long time, you can retrain yoursystem toward regularity. The most important principle is simply to take thetime to allow bowel function to happen in an unforced way. After awakening,drink one or two glasses of warm water. Then go to the bathroom and just spendfive to ten relaxed minutes, allowing bowel function to take place by itself.It’s best, by the way, to avoid reading during this time. Reading will focusyour attention upward or outward at a time when you want it to go inward anddownward.If nothing seems to be happening after ten minutes, get up and go about yourbusiness. But if you follow this procedure every day—intending to have a bowelmovement but not minding whether you do or not—your body will begin to recapturenature’s rhythm. Your system’s purification mechanisms will become moreintegrated with natural cycles, and you’ll experience the extra energy andclarity that this brings.If you continue to have problems with constipation or other abnormalities ofbowel function, I recommend another book in the Perfect Health Library, entitledPerfect Digestion: The Key to Balanced Living.EXERCICES FOR THE THREE BODY TYPESVATASlow-paced, light exercise that keeps the body in motion for 15 to 20 continuousminutes is best. Suggested exercises include walking, swimming, yoga exercises,and light bicycling.PITTABrisker-paced but moderate exercise that keeps your body in motion for 15 to 20continuous minutes is best. Suggested exercises include brisk walking, moderatecross-country skiing, swimming, cycling, weight lifting, tennis, andracquetball.KAPHAVigorous exercise that lasts 15 to 30 minutes is best. You might try jogging,vigorous bicycling, swimming, cross-country skiing, aerobic workouts, walking,and heavy weight lifting.AYURVEDIC GUIDELINES FOR HEALTHY EXERCISEIn general, use only 50 percent of your capacity. For example, if you arecapable of running a maximum of six miles, run only three. Or if you can swimtwelve laps at most, stop after six. Then you will feel energetic andcomfortable, never strained or tired. And with regular exercise, your capacitywill grow.Exercise every day, seven days a week.Do not strain when you exercise. If you start to breathe heavily through themouth or start perspiring, cut back for now and then gradually increase theamount of exercise. Remember: No strain produces maximum gain.In general, exercise should be performed during the Kapha cycle in the morning(6:00 A.M. to 10:00 A.M.). If you practice meditation, it is best to exercisejust afterward. However, the neuromuscular integration exercises and the SunSalute, described below, are ideal techniques for settling the mind, and theyshould be performed prior to meditation.EXERCISE AND THE DOSHASThis is the final major element of the Ayurveda daily routine. One of theclassic Ayurveda texts declares: \"By physical exercise one gets lightness,capacity to work, firmness, tolerance of difficulties, diminution of physicalimpurities and strengthening of digestion and metabolism.\" In other words,exercise creates energy. But this quote is followed by another, equallyimportant point: \"Exercise should be performed in moderation.\"The current emphasis on vigorous, strenuous, and generally difficult exercise isone reason why millions of people have so much trouble introducing regularphysical activity into their lives. While vigorous exercise may be appropriatefor certain body types, it has unpleasant effects on others, and this turns themaway from exercise in general. This is unfortunate, since some form of moderatephysical activity, in tune with your body type, is one of the most valuablethings you can do to promote energy.For Vata types, light exercise is definitely best. Vata, which is light and airyby nature, will not tolerate extremely strenuous activity. Such exercise willonly lead to a Vata imbalance and to more fatigue. Walking and comparableactivities, such as light swimming or bicycle riding, are the best choices forVata types. Try to walk for fifteen or twenty minutes every day, easily butcontinuously. As tolerance increases, pace can also be increased until you’removing quite briskly. In addition to walking and equivalent exercises, the yogapostures of the neuromuscular integration program, which were introduced inchapter 5, can be of great benefit to Vata types.Pitta types have moderate stamina, so they should engage in moderate forms ofexercise. Activities involving continuous motion for at least fifteen to twentyminutes are best. For Pittas, however, the pace can be a bit more intense thanfor Vatas. Brisk walking, cycling, light to moderate weight lifting,cross-country skiing, and swimming are all good. Pittas also tend to enjoycompetitive sports because of their dynamic and competitive natures. Theseactivities are fine as long as the competition doesn’t intensify to a point thatinflames Pitta’s aggressive tendencies. Games such as tennis or basketballinvolve more starting and stopping than continuous action and have lessphysiological value than continuous-motion types of exercise.Kapha types, who incline toward heaviness, are the only individuals who benefitfrom really vigorous exercise. In its absence, Kaphas can easily becomephysically sedentary and mentally lazy. If you’re a Kapha type, your tendencytoward inertia can make it hard for you to get going, but the right kind ofexercise will make you feel so much better that you’ll soon gain momentum andenjoyment. Kapha-appropriate exercises include jogging, vigorous bicycling,swimming, or cross-country skiing, heavier weight lifting, and aerobic dance.Indoor exercise equipment can be helpful during the winter months to keep up aKapha’s more demanding exercise program.Regardless of your body type, the best time for exercise is during the Kaphaperiod of morning. This helps to lighten up Kapha and get the day off to adynamic start. If you can’t exercise in the morning, you can still do so anytimeduring the daytime hours; exercise after sundown isn’t recommended, however,since it tends to agitate the system at a time when the body naturally wants tobe settling down before bed.Sun SaluteThere is one kind of exercise in Ayurveda that is recommended for all body typesand has a particularly energizing effect on the system. This exercise is calledSurya Namaskara in Sanskrit or, in English, Sun Salute. It is traditionallyperformed in the early morning while facing the rising sun.The Sun Salute comprises twelve postures that are alternated at roughlyfive-second intervals. A recommended breathing pattern accompanies the poses.If you’re not used to stretching, you may find it best to perform theneuromuscular integration exercises described in chapter 5 for a few weeksbefore undertaking the more vigorous Sun Salute. And if you’re in an older agegroup or have any muscle or orthopedic problems, it’s best to consult yourdoctor before doing this exercise.Follow these general guidelines for the sun salute:When you do the Sun Salute, allow a half-hour before a meal and three hoursafter a meal. If you practice other meditation programs or yoga postures, theSun Salute can be performed before them.One cycle of the Sun Salute, consisting of twelve postures, is described below.Start with as many cycles as is comfortable, and gradually increase to a maximumof twelve. Do not strain. If you start to breathe heavily or begin perspiring,lie down and rest for a minute or two.Hold each position for about five seconds. The Eight Limbs Position (position 6)is the only exception, as it is held only one second.The Sun Salute uses a specific pattern of breathing— inhale or exhale—for eachposture. You will be instructed to inhale during extension postures—becauseinhaling facilitates the extending and lengthening movements of the spine. Youwill be asked to exhale on the flexion postures, because this helps the body tofold, bend, and flex.You’ll see that there are two Equestrian positions per cycle. Use the same kneeforward during the same cycle. Switch to the opposite knee for the next cycle,and continue alternating with each new cycle. Always do an even number of cyclesso that both sides of your body are exercised in a balanced way.Do not rush through exercises; maximum value comes from doing them slowly. Eachcycle takes one to two minutes.After completing the final cycle, lie down on your back, arms at your sides,with palms facing upward, for two minutes. Just allow your attention to beeasily on your body.Be careful not to strain by stretching too far. The drawings show the idealperformance of each pose, but you should stretch only as far as your body iscomfortable. Over time, more flexibility will develop. You should definitivelynot feel pain or discomfort while doing these exercises. If even minimalperformance of a particular posture causes discomfort, omit that posture. If youhave back problems, consult your physician before starting these exercises.How to Do the Sun SaluteSALUTATION POSITIONStart the Sun Salute with your feet parallel and your weight distributed evenlyover your feet.

For the past 150to 200 years, however, society’s prevailing view has been that humanity isseparate from nature, and even superior to it. Man’s role has been to subdue andexploit nature for his own material purposes. The result of this, as we are allnow aware, has been scientific and industrial technologies that promote manyforms of imbalance, including depletion of natural resources, pollution of airand water, and the possibility of major ecological disasters.Fortunately, the pendulum has started to swing in the opposite direction. Thecollective consciousness of society is beginning to recognize that restoringbalance to the natural environment is crucial for individual and globalwell-being. But while there is now reason for hope, we also need to recognizethe negative effects that environmental disruptions are still inflicting, andhow these can weaken health and drain energy.If you are chronically tired, and no clear physical diagnosis has emerged toexplain it, you should at least consider the possibility that aspects of yourphysical environment may be responsible for your diminished energy. Thefollowing Primary Energy Principle summarizes an important relationship thatexists between every human being and his or her surroundings. Please write thisdown:PEP 18. Balance in the environment promotes balance in the individual;environmental imbalances can lead to individual imbalances.Before we begin to explore these ideas, let me offer a word of caution. It ispossible to become preoccupied by—or even obsessed with—the specter ofenvironmental danger. Compulsive worrying about hazards in water, air, food,electromagnetic fields, and much more, can itself cause you to live in anunnatural and unhealthy condition. Such pervasive fear can bring about a greaterphysiological imbalance than would result from anything but the most direenvironmental catastrophe. With this caution in mind, we can realisticallyassess some of the environmental influences that may be sources of chronicfatigue.AIR QUALITYPrana is the Ayurvedic term for air and breathing, but the word also hasconnotations of vitality, vital breath, and even of life itself. In addition toits fundamental importance in respiration, oxygen is one of the main componentsin the metabolism of food into vital energy. So the quality of the air webreathe obviously has great significance.The most important Ayurveda principle in this area is the importance of gettingfresh air every day. It’s amazing how little fresh air many Americans get intheir daily routine, and how draining this can be to vitality. Many people workin sealed environments where the flow of air is controlled by unseen fans or airconditioners. These cannot possibly provide the freshness that used to beavailable from open windows. People can now go for days or even weeks with onlythe slightest exposure to open air, especially during the winter months.Fortunately, this is not a difficult situation to remedy. It’s easy to createseveral opportunities each day for walking outdoors, even during the winter. Trygetting off the bus a couple of stops before your destination, for instance, orpark your car a few blocks away from your house or place of work. I recommendten to fifteen minutes of fresh air once or twice every day. You’ll feelimmediate benefits in your vitality and sense of well-being.It’s also possible to bring more fresh air into indoor environments. Leave yourwindows open as much as possible during the warmer months, and in winter openyour windows for at least ten minutes twice a day. Since you won’t be able to dothis if you work in a sealed glass-and-steel building, it will then beespecially important to get outdoors for a walk at some point during the day,perhaps at lunchtime.Air quality has improved in many urban areas during the past few years and onehopes this trend will continue. But if you suffer from significant chronicfatigue and you live in an area that is known to be badly polluted, you shouldbe aware of the effects that air quality can have on your situation. It may beworthwhile to consider moving to a cleaner environment.WATER QUALITYFew people are aware of what’s in the water they drink. While there’s aperception that large cities have the most serious water-quality problems, somerural areas have comparable or even worse situations because of the effects oftoxic chemicals in pesticides. If you are concerned about the quality of waterin your area, you should contact your local water department or the districtoffice of the Environmental Protection Agency for more information.You can also take two simple measures for insuring purer drinking water. First,you can install a good-quality water filter in your home. The best filters arethose that use reverse osmosis; they’re called \"RO\" filters for short. A secondapproach is to drink and cook exclusively with bottled water. If you choose todo this, check the source of the water. Some \"spring\" water may not be pure,since many natural springs are now unfortunately contaminated by pollutants. Abetter option may be bottled filtered water, especially reverseosmosis-filtered.FOOD QUALITYWe’ve already discussed the significance of fresh food and its vitalizingproperties. In addition to freshness, it’s important for food to be as free aspossible from contaminants. All fruits and vegetables should of course be washedbefore eating, and you should also consider spending a little more to getproduce that has been grown free of pesticides. Organically produced meats arealso preferred, although environmental pollutants tend to concentrate in thetissues of all animals no matter how they’re raised, and this is especially truein certain larger kinds of fish. There’s also reason for concern about hormonesgiven to livestock in order to increase bulk. All these factors make reducedconsumption of meat and fish a wise choice.MANMADE MATERIALSEvery day we come into contact with innumerable substances in the environment.In general, Ayurveda recommends emphasizing contact with natural substances andminimizing contact with artificially produced ones. This makes perfect sensebiologically, because the human body evolved over thousands of years to interactwith natural materials. Keep this principle in mind in constructing your homeand work environments.When you select clothing, be aware that cotton or wool allows your skin tobreathe more freely than synthetics do. Linens and bedclothes should also bemade of natural fabrics.ELECTROMAGNETIC POLLUTIONThere has been some attention in the media to the possible cancer-causingeffects of cellular telephones, high-voltage transformers, microwavetransmitters, computers, and other powerful sources of electrical energy.Research in this area is far from conclusive, and I caution you from becomingpreoccupied with such concerns. But I do believe that prolonged exposure toelectromagnetic forces in the environment can weaken the body and open the wayfor health problems. So if you’re constantly or frequently in the presence of aknown source of magnetic field radiation, you should be aware that this may becausing chronic fatigue. With regard to computers, it’s probably a good idea tostay at least one arm’s length away from the screen—and remember that moreradiation is emitted from the sides, back, and top of a computer screen thanthrough the front. I recommend you do some reading in this area in order to makean educated decision about the effect this may be having on your body.Let me conclude this discussion of environmental hazards by emphasizing apositive point. The human body has a tremendous capacity for adjustment andself-repair, and there are many instances of this. The immune system, forexample, is capable of recognizing and destroying almost every conceivable typeof germ or biological invader, even ones it has never previously encountered.This remarkable degree of flexibility and self-protection is present in thebody’s detoxifying systems as well. By putting your attention on strengtheningyour body’s own self-healing mechanisms, you can make yourself virtuallyinvincible to many destructive influences. Though your environment may wellcontain pollutants, your system will be able to handle these to a large degree.At the same time, by checking your surroundings for any extreme instances ofimbalance, you can take action to eliminate them and thereby maintain thestrength of your body’s natural self-repair processes.BALANCE AND THE SENSESThe effects of the environment on human physiology are a function not only ofwhat’s \"out there,\" but also of how we ourselves perceive and process thesurrounding world. The five senses—hearing, touch, sight, taste, smell—are thefive gateways through which we become aware of all environmental influences. Ifthese senses are healthy and balanced, they naturally filter out manypotentially harmful influences—and at the same time, they facilitate theacquisition of nourishment and energy.Ultimately, balance of the senses depends upon balance of awareness and ofconsciousness. There is an ancient Ayurveda saying that expresses this truth:\"The world is as we are.\" Please write it down as our next Primary EnergyPrinciple:PEP 19. The world is as we are—our experience of the world depends upon thestate of our awareness.An analogy can illustrate this point. A day can be bright and sunny, but ifyou’re wearing extremely dark sunglasses everything will look dismal and gray.If you now put on rose-colored glasses, everything will of course look rosy—andif you take your glasses off altogether, you’ll suddenly realize the true beautyof the day. The way you experience the world depends just as much, or more, onthe quality of your perceptions as it does on whatever is being perceived. Ifyou are experiencing balance, creativity, and inner fulfillment, this is whatyou will find all around you.I would like to look at the five senses in some detail, because bringing theminto balance can reveal a whole new source of untapped energy within yourself.One of the most important things to realize about the senses is the fact thatthey both give and receive information. On the one hand, they provide channelsthrough which stimuli can flow from outside to inside. You can ingest andmetabolize perceptions through your five senses in much the same way as you eatand digest food. And since assimilating information through the senses has atremendous effect on the brain—and therefore on all the powerful neurochemicalsthat circulate throughout the body—it’s important for your sensory influences tobe nourishing and energy-producing, rather than toxic and energy-draining.At the same time, the five senses are channels through which your awareness andyour individual consciousness is projected outward to the world. This fact isoften overlooked in modern physiology, but it is important in traditional healthsystems such as Ayurveda.This projection of your inner intelligence can be a creative act that bringsexhilaration and joy, or it can be a kind of empty hole into which your innervitality flows and then disappears. Ayurveda teaches that the difference betweenthese two possibilities depends on the extent to which you become entrapped bythe object you’re perceiving. If the sense of your own being and your own worthbecomes identified with the object, you are experiencing \"object-referral\"rather than \"self-referral.\" We’ll discuss these very important concepts, andthe whole mechanism of the senses as projectors of consciousness, in the thefinal chapter of this book.For the balance of this chapter, we will be concerned with the flow ofinformation inward via the five senses to your individual awareness—and we’llexplore what you can do to ensure that this inward flow is balanced andnourishing.Before considering the senses individually, please write down this next PrimaryEnergy Principle:PEP 20. The five senses are gateways to the mind/body system. By choosingsensory input that is harmonious and balancing, you can help cultivate happinessand energy throughout your system.THE SENSE OF HEARINGThe phrase \"noise pollution\" came into being several decades ago. It refers tothe modern phenomenon of very loud or very unpleasant sound, and to the effectof such sound on the human beings who have to hear it. Physiologically speaking,noise pollution creates a kind of sensory hyperarousal. It is an excessive levelof input to the nervous system that creates an alarmed response. If continuedfor more than a moment, it can cause a fight-or-flight response that is wearyingto maintain. The end result of prolonged exposure to noise pollution, therefore,is chronic fatigue.Noise is another environmental problem that may be difficult to resolve,especially if you live in a busy urban area. But there are creative ways toinsulate yourself from noise pollution and to create a quieter, more harmoniousenvironment. You can begin by relocating work or sleeping areas to the quietestpart of an office or house, and you can use draperies and overstuffed furnitureto muffle noise. Try some different options and see which work best for you.When you do have control over the kinds of sounds you’re exposed to, make aconscious effort for them to be as pleasant and relaxing as possible.I urge you to avoid loud, discordant music and to take advantage of themind/body benefits of soothing musical sound. Research has shown that differentharmonies and instrumental combinations can create different physiologicaleffects. As the human physiology changes throughout the day under the cyclicalinfluences of Vata, Pitta, and Kapha, particular sound values can help tomaintain biological rhythms and to create overall balance. In this way, yoursense of sound can be used for the well-being of your whole system.There are certain key moments during each day when sound can have an especiallyimportant effect. By listening to soothing music at bedtime, for example, youcan cultivate a natural state of serenity and restfulness. An entire branch ofAyurveda, called gandhama veda, is devoted to creating physiological balancethrough sound. Audiocassette selections of gandhama veda appropriate for bedtimemay be ordered through Quantum Publications or other Ayurvedic sources whoseaddresses are provided at the end of this book. Simply play the cassette at lowvolume while you’re lying down with the lights out.THE SENSE OF TOUCHDuring our discussion of the neuromuscular integration exercises, I mentionedmarmas, points on the body similar to control switches through which energy isrouted to various areas. Many of these vital points are located on the surfaceof your skin, and marma therapy is an aspect of Ayurveda that deals withbalancing them. You can do a type of marma therapy at home that is veryeffective and which, in fact, you have already learned. It is the Ayurvedic oilmassage described in chapter 5. This massage balances Vata throughout thesystem, and it does so by stimulating all the marma points on your skin’ssurface.In addition to those on the skin, important marma points are on the scalp, theears, and the soles of the feet, so I recommend that you spend a bit more timeon these areas during your massage. Also, there are three other key marma pointsto which you should pay special attention, as they are the centers of Vata,Pitta, and Kapha. One is in the center of the forehead, another is near thelower part of the breastbone just over the heart, and the last is on the lowerabdomen about two inches below the navel. Using gentle pressure, simply make alarge circular motion over each of these three areas during your massage;traditionally, a clockwise motion is recommended.Giving attention to the marma points on your skin through the daily oil massagewill help to awaken integrated energy flow throughout your body.THE SENSE OF SIGHTOf all the senses, sight provides the greatest volume of perceptual information.It is also the one most subject to sensory overload. A tired feeling around theeyes, headaches, and twitches of the eye muscles are all indicators of thisoverloading, which can be a major energy drain. Most of the recommendations fordealing with this are rather obvious; you shouldn’t read in dim light, forexample. But you should also be alert to sensory overload through your eyes justas we discussed in connection with hearing and noise pollution. For most people,this problem originates with excessive exposure to movies and television.Indeed, a great deal of visual entertainment is a kind of intentional sensoryoverload, and it can be a significant drain on your energy level.Try taking a few nights off from watching television, then use your EnergyTracking Chart to note how you feel during the following days. Many peopleexperience greater balance, calm, and centeredness, which translates intoincreased energy throughout the day. Occasional TV or a movie can certainly beenjoyable, but if you’ve developed a dependency on these media you should beaware of their energy-depleting effects.THE SENSE OF TASTEAs we discussed in connection with diet, the most important point concerningtaste is to experience all six tastes every day, and ideally at every meal. Thisnot only improves digestion and helps balance your system, it adds zest to yourwhole experience of life.In general, the following common spices are recommended for use in cooking or atthe table: black pepper, ginger, rock salt (if available), cumin, turmeric,cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and mustard seeds. All these spices are consideredto have sattvic, or energizing, qualities. Hot spices such as cayenne pepper andchilis should be used sparingly or not at all, especially by Pitta types.THE SENSE OF SMELLAyurveda considers the sense of smell to have a particularly potent effect onthe mind/body system. We all know the power of smell to evoke memories andemotions: how walking into a room and encountering a certain fragrance caninstantly call up vivid memories of the distant past. This is because theolfactory nerve carries its information directly to the deepest regions of thebrain, where emotion and many of the body’s most basic functions are regulated.The use of scent or aroma to create physiological balance is an ancient part ofclassical Ayurveda. Certain scents have influences on particular doshas, and ingeneral the pattern is similar to that of the tastes. Sweet or sour scents tendto balance Vata dosha, for example, while spicy fragrances balance Kapha, andminty scents balance Pitta. Aromatic oils for balancing the doshas are availablethrough sources listed at the end of this book. The best way to use aromas is atbedtime in order to create a fragrance that will last through the night. TheVata aroma is usually recommended for this purpose, since pacifying or balancingVata is conducive to sleep. During the daytime, you may also find aroma therapyto be particularly balancing and enlivening. Choose an aroma in the same way youmight choose your body-type diet for a given day, based on an awareness of theleading doshas in your physiology and on the season of the year."},{"pageContent":"image [images/Chop_9780307419958_epub_049_r1.jpg]JOY AS THE FOUNDATION OF ENERGYAlthough biological factors are certainly important in overcoming chronicfatigue, it should also be obvious that human life requires something more thanproper nutrition and exercise in order to be really healthy. There must be asense of meaning, an awareness of some larger purpose, a focus on someworthwhile goal.One of the most intriguing insights of traditional Ayurveda is expressed in thefollowing Primary Energy Principle. Please write this down:PEP 21. Growth is the foundation of survival.In this context, survival does not mean simply staying alive and continuing tobreathe. It means living in a spiritually meaningful way. One can avoidbiological death by eating and drinking some minimal amount every twenty-fourhours, but in order to live in any true sense of the word there must be progressand growth. The alternative is stagnation, chronic fatigue, or an even moreserious imbalance.Spiritual growth is an exhilarating experience. It sustains us emotionallythrough the ups and downs of life, and it is biologically important as well. Asense of progress and direction in your life fosters creation of theneurochemicals that can energize and vitalize your entire mind/body system. Thisis the real key to dynamic energy.WHOLENESS AND CONNECTIONThe spiritual growth I’m speaking of here is simply the unfolding andfulfillment of human potential. Within you is the impulse to be the very bestyou can possibly be—but there’s something even more than that. Deep down,everyone suspects that he or she has the potential to be truly great. Greatnessis— or at least was at some time—the real goal of every person’s life.In children the impulse to be great can be clearly seen. Children have no doubtsabout their ability to achieve what they want, and to be exactly who they wantto be. In everything they do there is joy and spontaneity—and unbounded energyas well.What word can we use to describe this state of being? It is a state ofcompletely experiencing every moment to the very limit. It is a wholeness ofbeing.The impulse to wholeness is a natural human birthright, for within each of usthere is the possibility of wholeness and the deep desire to achieve it.Wholeness means being completely integrated, without any sense of beingseparate, fragmented, or limited. It means experiencing natural joy.In Ayurveda, this wholeness has traditionally been seen as the goal of humandevelopment. Modern psychologists have referred to it as a state of\"self-actualization.\" As originally described by the psychologist AbrahamMaslow, self-actualization is characterized by creativity, a sense of innerfreedom, fulfillment, energy, and spontaneity. Maslow felt that this state is anatural goal in the evolution of every person.Wholeness and self-actualization is something that many people havespontaneously felt, at least for brief periods in their lives. It may have comein sports, in a particularly rewarding experience in your work, or in a momentshared with another person. Regardless of the specifics, these beautifuloccasions are invariably accompanied by joy, by a sense of everything flowingeffortlessly, and by a feeling of intimate connection with other people and withthe larger environment.Ayurveda has long seen this sense of connection as a basic truth that everyperson should strive to realize—and now modern science is also telling us thatwe are indeed intimately connected to all of nature and to the source of energyitself. Perhaps the greatest benefit of Ayurveda lies in its highly practicaltechniques for balancing our mind/body systems and thereby reestablishing ourlinks with the true wellsprings of vitality and health.TEACHING YOURSELF TO GO BEYONDI urge you to consider this vision of wholeness in the context of your own life.Over the years, many of us develop attitudes and self-concepts that diminish theunlimited sense of potential we enjoyed as children. Delays, frustrations, anddefeats inevitably occur, and these give rise to second thoughts about thepossibility of fulfilling our goals.Ayurveda states that three experiences—rejection, disappointment, and doubt—arethe most dangerous creators of stress in the system. As a result of thesepainful experiences, we can develop attitudes that are self-limiting rather thanself-expanding. At first, these defensive feelings may have quite understandablydeveloped as a way of protecting the heart from further disappointments, but theeffect of such self-limitation is nonetheless devastating for spiritual growth.Here I have in mind such destructive thoughts as: \"I guess I’ll never becompletely happy, but who’s really happy anyway?\"; \"I guess I’ll never achievemy goals, but they were probably unrealistic\"; \"I’m not the kind of person whocan really be successful in anything.\"I can hardly imagine any phrase more self-limiting than \"I’m not the kind ofperson who...\"!The most dangerous aspect of these negative attitudes is the way they come to bereflected in the neurochemistry of our bodies. Because the mind/body connectionis always at work, destructive thinking eventually translates into somedestructive physical condition such as chronic fatigue. Fatigue, after all, isreally just a kind of inertia, a physical sense of disappointment with life.The key to overcoming these pessimistic, soul-shrinking attitudes is to gobeyond them through the unlimited spiritual power that really is within you,though you may have lost sight of it for the moment. Going beyond is the onlyway. This is something more than just positive thinking; it’s gaining access toa deeper level of organizing power, a stronger force for coherence. What I meanby \"going beyond\" is getting to the source of thought, and reaching the unifiedfield of pure joy and unlimited possibility.The breathing meditation technique presented in chapter 5 is one of the mosteffective methods for accomplishing this. The classical textbooks of Ayurvedaclearly describe the benefits of incorporating meditation into your dailyactivity: when you emerge from the meditation period, some of the unbounded-nessand inner potential you experienced while meditating will stay with you. Onecould put it in neuropsychological terms by saying that the brain waveintegration that takes place during the practice of meditation persists intoother activities. New circuits, new areas of the brain become available to youfor the first time for your thoughts, perceptions, and actions.Reaching the source of thought is also, of course, an experience of reachingyour own inner being; it’s the most profound kind of self-realization. Manypeople describe this as \"coming back home\" or \"discovering who I really am.\"Through breathing meditation and the other techniques presented in this book,you can again contact your vast inner potential, perhaps for the first timesince you were a child. You can reestablish the connection between your ownindividual self and the unbounded energy and creativity of nature.OBJECT-REFERRAL VS. SELF-REFERRALAs you begin to function more and more from within yourself, your self-conceptinevitably becomes less and less dependent on the opinions of others. InAyurveda, this is called becoming \"self-referral\" instead of \"object-referral.\"Object-referral means sacrificing your unique inner identity for the sake of anexternally manufactured self-image. It means defining yourself in terms of whatothers might be thinking. Everything you do must be carefully plotted out, allyour energy is directed outward toward some object or person, and this is veryfatiguing. In Ayurveda, this is called pragyaparadh, the mistaken intellect. Themind makes the mistake of thinking that its true nature depends upon thingsoutside itself.In contrast, self-referral means locating your true identity and meaningfulnesswithin yourself. There’s no impulse to deliberately calculate actions andappearances; they are just intuitively and spontaneously right. At the silentlevel of the mind, at the deepest level of your nature, there is a computingsystem far more reliable than any conscious plans or thoughts. By gaining accessto nature’s inner, effortless computing system, you liberate huge amounts ofenergy and creativity. Fatigue is suddenly a thing of the past.PRESENT-MOMENT AWARENESSSelf-referral awareness is present-moment awareness. Life is spontaneouslyorganized by experiencing the present, rather than by ruminating on the past orworrying about the future. But object-referral awareness is based on fear andworry. This is because the object of attention is always changing—and who canpredict the opinions of others, much less the flow of external events?Object-referral is invariably a fear-based way of life, and nothing dissipatesenergy sooner than fear.Our next Primary Energy Principle sums up the ideas we’ve discussed so far inthis chapter. Please write this down:PEP 22. Wholeness of life is the goal of individual human growth and evolution.Wholeness is self-referral rather than object-referral, is centered inpresent-moment awareness, and is characterized by inner freedom, creativity,spontaneity, and nature’s unlimited energy.DHARMAIn Ayurveda there is an important concept concerning individual human evolution,which is the notion of dharma. Dharma may be translated as one’s natural path,natural behavior, or natural duty. It refers to the fact that everyone has acourse of action that is most right and nourishing for him or her, a path thatcreates greatest happiness and speediest evolution.There are two aspects to dharma: one is universal, the other individual.Everyone has a universal dharma, which is to achieve wholeness of life. This isbuilt into the mind/body system; it is inscribed in our DNA. Each generationinherits an inner impulse to grow from the previous generation. We all possessthis drive to achieve full potential, both mentally and physically. In physicalterms, this means achieving perfect health. Emotionally and psychologically, itmeans gaining that state of stability, creativity, and bliss that we’ve calledself-actualization or self-realization. Ayurveda calls this \"enlightenment. \"Along with this universal dharma, there is also an individual dharma. This isthe course of action that is most appropriate for each human being and will helpto bring him or her more quickly to the goal of wholeness of life. For certainpeople, being an airline pilot or an army general may provide just the rightopportunity for growth. Others may need to be homemakers or teachers. But if theaction is truly dharmic, in every case it feels right; it feels natural; and itproduces happiness.Individual dharma can change with the passage of time. For example, it isdharmic for most people to be unmarried while growing up and attending school,but later the dharma for most is family life. Occupational interests and evenlifestyle orientations may change at different times of life, as one completesone phase of dharma and enters another.Above all, dharma is meant to be a vehicle for the unfolding of happiness,wholeness, and health. If a certain action is right and natural—if it is in thedirection of evolution—the mind/body system will experience a sense of comfort,satisfaction, and even bliss in the performance of that action. But if anactivity impedes the evolutionary path, this will be expressed as physical andemotional discomfort, which very often takes the form of chronic fatigue.How should you go about finding your dharma? At the outset, it’s very importantto recognize that universal dharma and individual dharma nourish and supporteach other. If you’re confused about what your individual dharma may be, youshould direct attention to developing your universal dharma— to developingself-referral and wholeness. All the procedures and techniques in this book willhelp you to establish balance in mind and body. They will put you more in touchwith your own inner resources of creativity and intelligence. With this broaderperspective and enhanced creativity, you will naturally start to find greatersatisfaction in your life. You’ll recognize the most evolutionary, creativeopportunities in every situation, and you’ll be able to make the most of them.In the process of growth, you may even conclude that certain things ought tochange, perhaps in your line of work or in some of your relationships. But thechange will be natural, based on the broader perspective and greater creativityyou’re now able to bring to your situation. Your actions will be more and morein tune with your inner nature and with your individual dharma.THE RECREATIONAL UNIVERSEAlong with life’s work and duty, recreation is everyone’s dharma. In fact, welive in a recreational universe. Just look around and you’ll see that this istrue: birds burst into song in the morning, porpoises leap through the waves,and everywhere joy is displayed in nature. Recreation is an intrinsic aspect ofwholeness, and allowing enough time for recreation is an important part ofgrowing toward that goal.In connection with alleviating chronic fatigue, you should probably increase theamount of time you devote to recreation. Actually, I would describe many of thetechniques in this book as recreational, including meditation, the Sun Salute,and neuromuscular-neurorespiratory integration techniques. Recreation, afterall, literally means \"re-creation\": to rejuvenate and revitalize, to renew thebody’s resources and vital energy.As an important part of a balanced life, Ayurveda definitely recommends takingat least one full day each week off from work. This day should be devotedcompletely to rest and recreation. Your mind/body system needs one full day eachweek free from the responsibilities of everyday life in order to renew andrejuvenate itself.Our final Primary Energy Principle summarizes the main points about dharma.Please write it down:PEP 23. Dharma means a path of action that is the most right, evolutionary, andnourishing for your unique nature. Dharma has a universal aspect, which is theimpulse to grow and to achieve wholeness of life, and an individual aspect,which includes the specific activities that are most appropriate andevolutionary for you as an individual.BEHAVIORAL RASAYANASAyurveda recognizes that certain actions are inherently nurturing to the humanbody and spirit. These are known as \"behavioral rasayanas.\" They strengthen thephysiology and replenish energy, because behavior that is positive and upliftingcreates neurochemical changes that have beneficial effects on your own system.When you project a behavior onto another person, for example, you yourselfexperience the results of that behavior, whether positive or negative. InAyurveda, this has traditionally been thought of as the law of karma, but theidea also has a neurophysiological basis. In a very real sense, the effects ofall your actions are manifested in your own good health, or lack of it.Behavioral rasayanas are those actions that express respect, service,compassion, tolerance, and love. Respecting elders or teachers, supporting aperson in need, spending time with learned people—these are some of thetraditional behavioral rasayanas. But I believe the essence of the whole conceptcan be summed up in one sentence: Favor the positive in every situation, and donot entertain negativity.I assure you that if you begin to apply this principle in your daily life, thefirst beneficiary of this practice will be you. The best time to use it is whenyou notice some level of physical or emotional discomfort, such as chronicfatigue, and you feel that your actions toward another person may becontributing to this. Immediately see if you can find something positive in thesituation toward which you can shift your attention. And remember that placingyour attention on something helps that thing to grow stronger. You’ll be amazedhow quickly most negative situations can be turned around by shifting yourattention, and how exhilarated you’ll feel as a result.The other half of this principle is \"not to entertain negativity,\" and here Ithink the word entertain is extremely important. No one can completely avoid thenegative aspects of life, but there’s no necessity to entertain them, either. Ifsomeone you don’t like arrives uninvited at your home, you don’t have to providea comfortable environment for that person. Just ignore him and he’ll soon leaveon his own. In the same way, you don’t have to dwell on pessimistic thoughts orblack moods. The best attitude is indifference, together with a positive shiftin awareness. With time, this refusal to entertain negativity will become easierand easier. And once again, meditation can be a great help in culturing thehabit of positive thinking in a natural and effortless way.All the principles and techniques you’ve encountered in this book are designedto help you achieve the state of balance that will hasten your progress on thepath to fulfillment. To escape from self-limiting and fear-based attitudes andbehaviors into the pure joy of self-referral and wholeness is to personallyexperience nature’s boundless energy. It is permanently to replace fatigue withenergy. And it is an important step toward ultimate wholeness, which is the truegoal of your evolution as a human being."},{"pageContent":"BIBLIOGRAPHYBell, Davis S. Curing Fatigue.
