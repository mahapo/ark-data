A medical treatment was what they wanted, but the reassurance andcomfort that human contact could bring was just as valuable, perhaps even moreso. Unless he’s completely burned out, a physician sees himself as arough-and-ready savior, yanking victims out of danger into a state of safety andwell-being.I’m grateful for my years seeing patients, because I learned the differencebetween advice and solutions. People who are in trouble are rarely helped byadvice. Crises don’t wait; something very bad will happen if the right solutionisn’t found.I kept the same standard in mind when writing this book. It began with peoplewriting me with troubles on their minds. Their letters were sent from around theworld—at one point I was answering questions daily or weekly from India, theUnited States, and many other locales, mostly through the Internet. Yet in asense everyone was writing from the same place inside, where confusion anddarkness had overwhelmed them. These people were hurt, betrayed, abused,misunderstood, ill, worried, anxious, and at times desperate. Sadly, that is thehuman condition, almost permanently for some people, but these feelings arealways possible for people who are happy and contented—for the moment.I wanted to give answers that were lasting enough so that when “for the moment”changes, when crisis descends and a challenge must be faced, solid solutionswere at hand. I call them spiritual solutions, but the term doesn’t meanreligious solutions, prayer, or surrender to God. Instead I envision a secularspirituality. This is the only way modern people will ever reconnect with theirsouls, or, to remove all religious overtones, their “true selves.”What has a crisis done to you personally? Whatever the situation, you drew back,contracted inside, and felt the grip of anxiety. This state of contractedawareness is the enemy of finding a solution. Real solutions to a crisis comefrom expanded awareness. The inner feeling is no longer tight and fearful.Boundaries give way; fresh ideas have space to grow. If you are able to contactyour true self, awareness has no boundaries. From that place, solutions emergespontaneously, and they work. Often they work like magic, and obstacles thatseemed immovable melt away. When that happens, the burden of anxiety and sorrowis lifted completely. Life was never meant to be a struggle. Life was meant tounfold from its source in pure awareness. If this book leaves only one lastingimpression, that’s the one I’m hoping for.Deepak Chopra"},{"pageContent":"[images/Chop_9780307719195_epub_001_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":" No one will disagree that life brings challenges, but step back for a moment andask the deeper question, which is why. Why is life so difficult? No matter whatadvantages you are born with—money, intelligence, an appealing personality, asunny outlook, or good social connections—none of these provides a magic key toan easy existence. Somehow life manages to bring difficult problems, the causesof untold suffering and struggle. How you meet your challenges makes all thedifference between the promise of success and the specter of failure. Is there areason for this, or is life simply a random series of events that keeps us offbalance and barely able to cope?Spirituality begins with a decisive answer to that question. It says that lifeisn’t random. There is pattern and purpose inside every existence. The reasonthat challenges arise is simple: to make you more aware of your inner purpose.If the spiritual answer is true, there should be a spiritual solution to everyproblem—and there is. The answer doesn’t lie at the level of the problem, eventhough most people focus all their energies at that level. The spiritualsolution lies beyond. When you can take your awareness outside the place wherestruggle is ever-present, two things happen at the same time: your awarenessexpands, and with that, new answers begin to appear. When awareness expands,events that seem random actually aren’t. A larger purpose is trying to unfoldthrough you. When you become aware of that purpose—which is unique for eachperson—you become like an architect who has been handed the blueprint. Insteadof laying bricks and fitting pipes at random, the architect can now proceed withconfidence that he knows what the building should look like and how to constructit.The first step in this process is recognizing what level of awareness you areworking from right now. Every time a challenge comes your way, whether it isabout relationships, work, personal transitions, or a crisis that demandsaction, there are three levels of awareness. Become aware of them, and you willtake a huge step toward finding a better answer.LEVEL 1: CONTRACTED AWARENESSThis is the level of the problem, and therefore it immediately grabs yourattention. Something has gone wrong. Expectations have turned sour. You faceobstacles that don’t want to move. As resistance mounts, your situation stilldoesn’t improve. If you examine the level of the problem, the following elementsare generally present:Your desires are thwarted. Something you want is meeting with opposition.You feel as if every step forward is a battle.You keep doing more of what never worked in the first place.There is an underlying anxiety and fear of failure.Your mind isn’t clear. There is confusion and inner conflict.As frustration mounts, your energy is depleted. You feel more and moreexhausted.You can tell if you are stuck at the level of contracted awareness by one simpletest: the more you struggle to get free of a problem, the more you are trappedin it.LEVEL 2: EXPANDED AWARENESSThis is the level where solutions begin to appear. Your vision extends beyondthe conflict, giving you more clarity. For most people this level isn’timmediately available, because their first reaction to a crisis is to contract.They become defensive, wary, and fearful. But if you allow yourself to expand,you will find that the following elements enter your awareness:The need to struggle begins to diminish.You start to let go.More people connect with you. You allow them more input.You approach decisions with confidence.You meet fear realistically and it starts to lessen.With clearer vision, you no longer feel confused and conflicted.You can tell that you have reached this level of awareness when you no longerfeel stuck: a process has begun. With greater expansion, unseen forces come toyour aid. You move forward according to what you desire from your life.LEVEL 3: PURE AWARENESSThis is the level where no problems exist. Every challenge is a creativeopportunity. You feel completely aligned with the forces of nature. What makesthis possible is that awareness can expand without limits. Although it may seemthat it takes long experience on the spiritual path to reach pure awareness, thetruth is exactly the opposite. At every moment pure awareness is in contact withyou, sending creative impulses. All that matters is how open you are to theanswers being presented. When you are fully open, the following elements will bepresent:There is no struggle.Desires reach fulfillment spontaneously.The next thing you want is the best thing that could happen. You benefityourself and your surroundings.The outer world reflects what is happening in your inner world.You feel completely safe. You are at home in the universe.You view yourself and the world with compassion and understanding.To be completely established in pure awareness is enlightenment, a state ofunity with everything in existence. Ultimately, every life is moving in thatdirection. Without attaining the final goal, you can tell that you are incontact with pure awareness if you feel truly yourself, in a state of peace andfreedom.Each of these levels brings its own kind of experience. This can be easily seenwhen there is a sharp contrast or a sudden change. Love at first sight takes aperson without warning from contracted awareness to expanded awareness. Insteadof relating in the normal social way, suddenly you see immense appeal, evenperfection, in one other person. In creative work there is the “Aha!”experience. Instead of wrestling with a blocked imagination, suddenly the answerpresents itself, fresh and new. No one doubts that such epiphanies exist. Theycan be life-changing, as in the so-called peak experience, when reality isflooded with light and a revelation dawns. What people don’t see is thatexpanded awareness should be our normal state, not a moment of extraordinarydifference. Making it normal is the whole point of the spiritual life.Listening to people tell their stories of problems, obstacles, failure, andfrustration—an existence trapped in contracted awareness—one sees that reachinga new vision is critical. It is all too easy to get lost in particulars. Thedifficulties of facing each challenge are often overwhelming. No matter howintensely you feel your situation, which has its own unique difficulties, if youlook to the right and left, you will see others who are just as caught up intheir situations. Strip away the details, and what remains is a general cause ofsuffering: lack of awareness. By lack I’m not implying personal failure. Unlessyou are shown how to expand your awareness, you have no choice but to experiencethe state of contraction.Just as the body flinches when faced with physical pain, the mind has a reflexthat makes it draw back when faced with mental pain. Here again, a moment ofsudden contrast makes it easy to experience what contraction feels like. Imagineyourself in any of the following situations:You are a young mother who has taken your child to the playground. You chat fora moment with another mother, and when you turn around, you can’t see yourchild.At work you are sitting at your computer when someone casually mentions thatthere are going to be layoffs, and by the way, the boss wants to see you.You open your mailbox and find a letter from the Internal Revenue Service.While driving you approach an intersection when, out of the blue, a car behindyou swerves past your car and runs a red light.You walk into a restaurant and see your spouse sitting with an attractivecompanion. They are leaning in toward each other, talking in low voices.It doesn’t take much imagination to feel the sudden change of awareness thatthese situations provoke. Panic, anxiety, anger, and apprehension flood yourmind; these are the result of brain changes as the lower brain takes precedentover the higher brain, triggering the release of adrenaline as part of an arrayof physical responses known as the stress response. Any feeling is both mentaland physical. The brain gives a precise representation of what the mind isexperiencing, drawing on infinite combinations of electrochemical signalscoursing through one hundred billion neurons. A brain researcher can pinpointwith ever-increasing accuracy exactly those regions that produce such changes.What cannot be seen on an MRI is the mental event that incites all thesechanges, because the mind functions at the invisible level of awareness orconsciousness. We can take these two terms as synonyms, but let’s explore them alittle.Spirituality deals with your state of awareness. It isn’t the same as medicineor psychotherapy. Medicine deals in the physical aspect where bodily changesoccur. Psychotherapy deals in a specific difficulty, such as anxiety,depression, or actual mental illness. Spirituality confronts awareness directly;it aims to produce higher consciousness. In our society this is seen as muchless real than the other ways of approaching problems. In times of trouble,people cope as best as they can with a swirling confusion of fear, anger, moodswings, and everyday struggle. It doesn’t even occur to them to pair the twowords spiritual and solution in the same sentence. This points to a limitedvision about what spirituality really is, and what it can do.If spirituality can change your awareness, nothing is more practical.Awareness isn’t passive. It leads directly to action (or inaction). The way thatyou perceive a problem will inevitably blend with how you try to solve theproblem. We’ve all been in groups that are asked to accomplish a task, and whenthe discussion begins, each participant displays aspects of their awareness.Someone seizes the floor, demanding attention. Someone else hangs back silently.Certain voices are cautious and pessimistic, while other voices are theopposite. This play and display of attitudes, emotions, role-playing, and so oncomes down to awareness. Every situation lends itself to expanding yourawareness. The word expand doesn’t mean that awareness blows up like a balloon.Instead, we can break down awareness into quite specific areas. When you enter asituation, you respond through the following aspects of your awareness:PerceptionsBeliefsAssumptionsExpectationsFeelingsOnce you change these aspects—even a few of them—a shift in consciousnessoccurs. As the first step to reaching a solution, it is critical to break downany problem until you reach the aspects in your awareness that are feeding theproblem.Perceptions: Every situation looks different to different people. Where I seedisaster, you may see opportunity. Where you see loss, I may see the lifting ofa burden. Perception isn’t fixed; it is highly personal. So the key question,when you approach the level of awareness, isn’t “How do things look?” but “Howdo things look to me?” Questioning your perception gives you distance from aproblem, and with distance comes objectivity. But there is no such thing astotal objectivity. We all see the world through tinted glasses, and if youmistake the view for reality, it’s just the tint pretending to be clear.Beliefs: Because they hide beneath the surface, beliefs seem to play a passiverole. We all know people who claim to be without prejudice—racial, religious,political, or personal—who act exactly like someone riddled with prejudice. It’seasy to repress your beliefs, but it’s just as easy not to recognize them. Whatpsychologists call core beliefs can be the hardest to spot in yourself. In anearlier age, for example, it was a core belief that men were superior to women.The topic wasn’t even raised for discussion, much less doubt. But when womendemanded the vote, and this grew into a broad, vocal feminist movement, menfound that their core belief was exposed. How did they react? As if they hadbeen attacked personally, because their beliefs were their identity. “This isme” sits very close in the mind to “this is what I believe.” When you react to achallenge by taking it too personally, with defensiveness, anger, and blindstubbornness, some core belief has usually been touched.Assumptions: Because they shift according to the situation you find yourself in,assumptions are more flexible than beliefs. But they are just as unexamined. Ifa police cruiser signals you to pull off the road, don’t you assume that youhave done something wrong and will wind up defending yourself? It is hard to beopen-minded enough to allow that the police officer may offer somethingpositive. That’s how assumptions work. They leap in to fill a gap ofuncertainty. Social encounters are never empty. When you meet a friend fordinner, you bring assumptions about how the evening will go that are unlike theassumptions you bring to a blind date. As with beliefs, if you challenge aperson’s assumptions, the outcome is likely to be volatile. Although ourassumptions shift all the time, we usually don’t like to be told that they needto change.Expectations: What you expect from other people is linked to desire or fear.Positive expectations are ruled by desire, in that you want something and expectit to come to you. We expect to be loved and cared for by our spouses. We expectto be paid for the work we do. Negative expectations are ruled by fear, as whenpeople anticipate worst-case scenarios. Murphy’s Law, which says that ifanything can go wrong, it will, provides a good example. Because desire and fearlie close to the surface of the mind, your expectations are more active thanyour beliefs and assumptions. What you believe about your boss is one thing;being told that your salary has been cut is another. Depriving someone of whatthey expect directly challenges how they live.Feelings: As much as we try to disguise them, our feelings lie on the surface;other people see them or sense them as soon as they meet us. Therefore we spenda lot of time fighting against feelings that we don’t want to have, or againstfeelings we feel ashamed of and judge negatively. For many people, simply tohave a feeling is undesirable. They see themselves as exposed and vulnerable.Being emotional is equated with being out of control (which itself is anundesirable feeling). Being aware that you have feelings is a step towardgreater awareness, and then there’s the next step, which can be much harder, ofaccepting your feelings. With acceptance comes responsibility. Owning your ownfeelings, rather than blaming them on someone else, is the mark of a person whohas moved from contracted to expanded awareness.If you are able to examine your state of awareness, these five elements willemerge. When someone is truly self-aware, you can ask them a direct questionabout how they feel, what their assumptions are, what they expect from you, andhow their core beliefs are being affected. In response you won’t get a defensivereaction. You’ll be told the truth. Healthy as that sounds, why is it spiritual?Self-awareness isn’t the same as praying, believing in miracles, or seekingGod’s favor. The vision I’ve sketched in is spiritual because of the third levelof awareness, which I’ve labeled pure awareness.This is the level that religious believers know as the soul or spirit. When youbase your life on the reality of the soul, you hold spiritual beliefs. When yougo further and take the level of the soul to be the basis of life—the veryground of existence—then spirituality becomes an active principle. The soul isawakened. In reality the soul never sleeps, because pure awareness infuses everythought, feeling, and action. We may disguise this fact from ourselves. Onesymptom of contracted awareness, in fact, is a complete denial of “higher”reality. This denial is based not on willful blindness but on the absence ofexperience. A mind blocked by fear, anxiety, anger, resentment, or suffering ofany kind isn’t able to experience expanded awareness, much less pure awareness.If the mind worked like a machine, it wouldn’t be able to recover from the stateof suffering. Like gears worn down by friction, our thoughts would get worse andworse until the day arrived when suffering was completely victorious. Forcountless people life feels just like that. But the potential to heal is neverworn away completely; change and transformation are your birthright, guaranteednot by God, faith, or salvation, but by the indestructible basis of life, whichis pure awareness. To be alive is to be caught up in constant change. When wefeel stuck, our cells are still processing the basic materials of lifecontinually. Feelings of numbness and depression can make life seem to stop. Socan sudden loss and failure. Yet no matter how severe the shock or how stubbornthe obstacle, the ground state of existence isn’t affected, much less damaged.In the following pages you will encounter people who feel stuck, numb,frustrated, and stymied. Their stories seem to be unique, as viewed by each ofthem, but the way forward isn’t unique. It consists of addressing their state ofawareness. What refuses to move must be shown how to move. That’s another reasonwhy the solutions being offered are spiritual: they first involve seeing, wakingup, becoming open to new perceptions. The most practical way to reach a solutionis spiritually, because you can only change what you first are able to see. Noenemy is more insidious than the one you are blind to.We live in a secular age, and so the view of life I’ve just outlined is far fromthe norm. In fact, it’s almost the opposite, because although everyone wouldagree that buildings must have blueprints, life doesn’t. Life is viewed as aseries of unpredictable events that we struggle to control. Who will beforeclosed on or lose their job? Which household will be struck with accidents,addiction, divorce? There is seemingly no rationale behind these events. Stuffhappens. Obstacles arise of their own accord, or simply by accident. Each of usjustifies our contracted awareness by accepting such beliefs, and they run deep.Human nature, we tell ourselves, is filled with negative drives, such asselfishness, aggression, and jealousy. At best we are in partial control ofthese drives as they rise up inside us. We have no control at all over thenegativity in others, and so each day presents us with a struggle against randomchance and against people who are out to get what they want, no matter that itcauses problems, or even loss, for us. As a beginning to expanded awareness, youneed to challenge this worldview even if it is the social norm. Normal isn’t thesame as true.The truth is that each of us is entangled in the world we call real. Mind isn’ta ghost. It is embedded in the whole situation you find yourself in. To see howthat works, first abolish the separation between a thought, the brain cells thethought stimulates, the body’s reaction as it receives messages from the brain,and the activity you decide to pursue. All are part of the same continuousprocess. Even among geneticists, who for decades preached that genes determinedalmost every aspect of life, there is a new catchphrase: genes are not nouns,they are verbs. Dynamism is universal.You aren’t floating in a mindless environment, either. Your surroundings arebeing affected by what you say and do. The words “I love you” have an entirelydifferent effect on others than the words “I hate you.” An entire society isgalvanized by the words “the enemy is attacking.” At the most expanded level,the whole planet is influenced by the global exchange of information; you areparticipating in the global mind by sending an e-mail or joining a socialnetwork. What you eat on the run in a fast-food restaurant has implications forthe whole biosphere, as environmentalists are at pains to show us.Spirituality has always begun with wholeness. Lost in a world of specifics, weforget that isolation is a myth. Your life at this moment is an entangledprocess that involves thoughts, feelings, brain chemicals, the body’s responses,information, social interactions, relationships, and the ecology. So when youspeak and act, you are causing a ripple that is felt in the flow of life. Yetspirituality goes beyond describing you; it also prescribes the most beneficialway to affect the flow of life.Because pure awareness lies at the basis of everything, the most powerful way tochange your life is to begin with your awareness. When your consciousnesschanges, your situation will change. Every situation is both visible andinvisible. The visible part is what most people fight against, because it’s “outthere,” accessible to the five senses. They are loath to confront the invisibleaspect of their situation, because it is “in here” where unseen dangers andfears lurk. In the spiritual vision of life, “in here” and “out there” areentangled with countless threads; the fabric of existence is woven from them.Two starkly contrasting visions are competing, then, one based on materialism,randomness, and externals; the other based on consciousness, purpose, and theunion of inner and outer. Before you can find a solution to the challenge thatfaces you today, right this minute, you must choose at a deeper level whichvision of life you are following. The spiritual view leads to spiritualsolutions. The nonspiritual view leads to a host of other solutions. Clearlythis is a critical choice because, whether you realize it or not, your life isunfolding according to the choices you have made unconsciously, dictated by yourlevel of awareness.This sketch of what a spiritual solution can achieve will sound very foreign tomany people, however. Most of us avoid confronting ourselves; we are unable todefine a vision. Instead, we meet life as it comes, coping as best we can,relying on mistakes from the past, advice from friends and family, and hope. Wewind up giving in when we must and clutching at what we think we want. So whatwould it take to adopt a spiritual vision of your own life? In this book wewon’t be following the path of conventional religion. Prayer and faith, whilenot central to the vision that needs to unfold, aren’t excluded, however. If youare religious and find comfort and help by turning to God, you are entitled toyour version of a spiritual life. But here we will be consulting a much vastertradition than any of the world’s religions, a tradition that embodies thepractical wisdom of sages and seers, in both East and West, who have lookeddeeply at the human condition.If there is one piece of practical wisdom that the following chapters are about,it is this: Life is constantly recycling itself and evolving at the same time.This must be true of your own life, then. When you can see that all yourstruggles and frustrations have kept you from joining the flow of evolution, youhave the best reason to stop struggling. I am inspired by a famous Indian sagewho taught that life is like a river flowing between the two banks of pain andsuffering. Everything runs perfectly when we stay in the river, but we insist ongrasping at pain and suffering as we pass them, as if the banks offer us safetyand shelter.Life flows from within itself, and seizing on any kind of rigid or fixedposition is contrary to life. The more you let go, the more your true self canexpress its desire to evolve. Once the process is under way, everything changes.Inner and outer worlds reflect each other without confusion or conflict. Becausesolutions now arise from the level of the soul, they meet no resistance. Allyour desires lead to the result that is best for you and your surroundings. Inthe end, happiness is based on reality, and nothing is more real than change andevolution. It is with the hope that everyone can find a way to leap into theriver that this book was written.[images/Chop_9780307719195_epub_L02_r1.jpg]THE ESSENCEEvery problem is open to a spiritual solution. The solution is found byexpanding your awareness, moving beyond the limited vision of the problem. Theprocess begins by recognizing what kind of awareness you are working from,because for every challenge in life there are three levels of awareness.LEVEL 1: CONTRACTED AWARENESSThis is the level of problems, obstacles, and struggle. Answers are limited.Fear contributes to a sense of confusion and conflict. Efforts to reach asolution meet with frustration. You keep doing more of what didn’t work in thefirst place. If you remain at this level, you will be frustrated and exhausted.LEVEL 2: EXPANDED AWARENESSThis is the level where solutions begin to appear. There is less struggle.Obstacles are easier to overcome. Your vision extends beyond the conflict,giving you more clarity. Negative energies are confronted realistically. Withgreater expansion, unseen forces come to your aid. You move forward according towhat you desire from your life.LEVEL 3: PURE AWARENESSThis is the level where no problems exist. Every challenge is a creativeopportunity. You feel completely aligned with the forces of nature. Inner andouter worlds reflect each other without confusion or conflict. Because solutionsarise from the level of the true self, they meet no resistance. All your desireslead to the result that is best for you and your surroundings.As you move from Level 1 to Level 3, life’s challenges become what they aremeant to be: a step closer to your true self.[images/Chop_9780307719195_epub_L03_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"[images/Chop_9780307719195_epub_002_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"RELATIONSHIPSWhat opens up a relationship to spiritual solutions? A willingness to expandyour awareness while giving space for your partner’s awareness to expand at thesame time. Thus a spiritual relationship is a mirror in which two people glimpsethemselves at the soul level. Spiritual relationship brings the deepestfulfillment. That kind of fulfillment cannot be faked. But what are itscomponents?As with every aspect of the spiritual path, nothing is fixed. You can try todefine the perfect relationship in terms of ideals like unconditional love andcomplete trust. But in reality there is a process, and even in the bestrelationships the process has unforeseen twists and turns. In this section youwill hear from people caught up in distressing relationships. For them, aprocess also exists, but it has moved in the wrong direction. When two peoplewho used to love each other find themselves alienated and unhappy, the processthat got them there has certain predictable features. Looking at your ownmarriage or life partnership, do the following apply?Projection: Your partner makes you angry and frustrated. He claims to be doingnothing to irritate you, much less harm you, but that doesn’t change how youfeel. The slightest gesture makes you see everything you dislike, all thestubborn traits that never seem to change.Judgment: You feel that your partner is wrong or bad in some way. You feel alack of respect, or else a strong sense of blame. You especially condemn thejudgment that you feel is being directed your way, which only increases yoursense that you are right and she is wrong.Codependence: Your partner fills in your missing pieces. Together you make awhole person, a united front against the world. But there’s a major downside.You feel joined at the hip, and when you disagree, you find it impossible tostand up for yourself like an independent adult. You need your missing piece,because otherwise you would feel a hole inside.Giving away too much: In order to get along and to show that you are a goodwife, you gave away your power. All the major decisions are made by yourhusband; he has the final say-so. Less often this happens with the husbandgiving away power to the wife, but in either case you become dependent onsomeone else for your upkeep, self-respect, appreciation, attention, andultimately your sense of self-worth.Grabbing too much: This is the reverse of the preceding point. Instead ofbecoming dependent, you make your partner dependent. You do this throughcontrol. You want to be right; you feel free to blame your partner while alwaysfinding an excuse for yourself. You expect to be right. You rarely share orconsult. In small ways and large, you make your partner feel that she is lessthan you.Relationship isn’t an object you can take down from the shelf and polish, orhaul off to be repaired. It consists of days, hours, and minutes spent together,and each is lost as soon as it is over. How you cope from minute to minutebecomes the sum total of your relationship. Spend those minutes coping badly,and eventually the process leads to deterioration.The alternative is to cope wisely and well from moment to moment. Skill isrequired for that. No one is asked to turn a marriage into a pact between twosaints. What you need is a connection with a deeper level of yourself, a levelfrom which love and understanding can arise spontaneously. In relationships thatare deteriorating, awareness is shallow and contracted, so the impulses thatarise spontaneously are anger, resentment, anxiety, boredom, and habitualreflexes. Without blaming yourself or your partner, look upon these as symptomsof contraction that can be changed simply by expanding.WHEN RELATIONSHIPS WAKE UPExpanded awareness has its own features. Looking at the best part of yourrelationship—the times when you feel close and connected to your partner—ask ifthe following qualities apply.Evolution: You seek to find your true self and act from that level. At the sametime, your partner has the same goal. As much as you want to evolve and grow,you want the same for him.Equality: You don’t feel either superior or inferior. No matter how much yourpartner may irritate you, at bottom you see another soul. Together you sharemutual respect. When arguments arise, you never belittle her. You don’t have toforce a sense of being equal, with your ego secretly feeling that you arebetter.Being real: You expect candor and truth from each other. You realize thatillusions are the enemy of happiness. You don’t pretend to have feelings thataren’t really there. At the same time, you see that negativity is a projection,so you don’t indulge in anger and resentment. Being real also means that youfeel renewed every day. When each moment is real, there’s no need to rely onexpectations and rituals to get you through the day.Intimacy: You take pleasure from being close, and your intimacy is used tounderstand and to be understood. She doesn’t manipulate intimacy to extract moreaffection and desire. He doesn’t back away from intimacy because it frightenshim. Closeness isn’t a state in which either of you feels exposed andvulnerable. It’s your deepest shared truth.Taking responsibility: You claim what is yours, even when it feels painful. Youcarry your own personal baggage. There are burdens that the two of you shouldertogether, but you aren’t seduced into codependency, which forces one person’sproblems to be carried by two. By realizing that it is “my anger” and “my hurt,”not “how angry you made me” and “the way you hurt me,” you get pastvictimization. As justified as it feels to be the victim, there is an underlyinglack of responsibility. You are allowing someone else to determine your feelingsand decide outcomes that are actually yours to decide.Surrender through giving: You do not approach surrender as losing. Instead, youask how much you can give to your partner, and in so doing you attain a higherlevel of surrender. At this level it is an honor to give because one true selfis bowing to another. The feeling is one of love, but it is almost an impersonallove, because you expect nothing in return. Every time you give, you enrich yourtrue self, so the net result is a gain.If people can be made to see the difference between these two processes, oneleading to deterioration between partners, the other leading to sharedevolution, the first step toward a spiritual relationship has been taken. But Idon’t lean on the word spiritual. Many couples find that a foreign or eventhreatening concept. It’s more important that the two of them see the value ofexpanding their awareness. The trick is knowing where to insert the wedge. Weall hold tight to our selfish point of view. We know what we want most of thetime. We harbor the fantasy that our partners will step aside and give us aneasy road to what we want.With that in mind, it’s clear that coaxing each partner to give up or give in isfutile. It’s tantamount to saying, “I want for you more than I want for myself.”No one can honestly say that, especially in a state of contraction. What willwork is to address the issue from a different angle, but showing the benefits ofexpanding one’s awareness. You feel more relaxed and less stressed. You givepositive emotions space to emerge without fearing that they will be beaten down.Anxiety can come to the surface and be released. Those benefits are selfish, atleast at the beginning. Over time, however, expanded awareness creates room foranother person. In a relationship that has unfolded for years in a spiritualdirection, you naturally find yourself doing the following: • Relating to your partner emotionally, with trust that your feelings arevalued and won’t be judged. • Bonding at a profound level, with complete trust that you are accepted. • Exploring who you really are and who your partner really is—in otherwords, uncovering your soul. • Letting love and intimacy grow without imposing boundaries or letting fearget in the way. • Following a higher purpose together. • Raising a generation of children who can be more fulfilled than thisgeneration.I know this may sound impossible to attain when you look at yourself and yourpartner today. But a fully spiritual relationship is the natural outcome of aprocess that you can begin now. The world’s wisdom traditions mostly talk in thesingular, about how one soul can reach heaven or enlightenment. Yet human beingshave always been social, and the growth of the individual—including yourgrowth—occurs in a social setting. Looking around today, one sees countlessfamilies where inner growth is wanted, yet it’s not an easy subject to talkabout.The spiritual side of life in modern society has been divorced from “real life,”which involves endless distractions. We dwell on the everyday things thatrelationships are about—raising a family, providing the necessities of food andclothing, keeping the peace under one roof. Since relationships are hard at thebest of times, trying to achieve a spiritual relationship can seem like afantasy. But spirituality underlies everything in life. We are souls first andpersons second; the world’s wisdom traditions repeat this teaching over andover. When you reverse the equation, relating first as persons, troubles areinevitable, because at the personal level we have our own agendas, likes anddislikes, and a host of selfish motives. The true self has no choice but tohide.EVERYONE NEEDS THE LIGHTThe true self has every reason, though, to come out of hiding. This is how twosouls can find each other. Bringing out the spiritual quality in yourself isn’trestricted to your primary relationship, however. Every relationship has its ownpotential that is different and unique. Imagine at this moment that all thepeople you relate to are like a pie, with each person occupying one slice. Mostof the slices will be people who are stable—dependable friends and family whonever seem to change. That stability is needed; those relationships make lifesteady and comforting, even though you may complain that nobody changes or thatthey can’t see how much you have changed. When you go home for the holidays, thetable is filled with mostly this kind of person.Other slices of the pie are different. At least one should be filled with light:this is the person who inspires you, who makes you grow and evolve. Romanceisn’t always the key. He or she may be the most difficult person you relate to,because your relationship is so open—none of the usual social gestures arewasted between the two of you. I remember a woman who told her partner, “We’renot as happy together as we should be.” Without hesitation the partner replied,“Maybe our job right now isn’t to be happy. It’s to be real.” At a deeper level,happiness becomes lasting only when it’s real. Trying to base your relationshipon illusions, however pleasing they are, will fail in the end.Look for that slice of the relationship pie that is filled with light. Light isthe essence of the soul. I put the word in italics because light is a metaphorfor a range of soul characteristics: love, acceptance, creativity, compassion,non-judgment, and empathy. Your primary relationship should contain thesequalities.Countless people are not so fortunate, however. No one in their circle ofrelationships is inspiring; they have no partner in their spiritual journey. Thepartner they do have may be blocking the way. That’s the gist of the problemwhen people ask about their troubled relationships. The solutions they areseeking don’t lie at the level of the problem, however. The solution lies at thelevel of the true self. When people catch on to that, they can quit blamingtheir partners, stop feeling victimized, and take responsibility for discoveringwho they really are. With those keys in hand, spiritual solutions emerge thatwere not seen before, even when couples say that they have tried everything.What they haven’t tried is the one thing that supports life as a whole: ourawareness of who we really are. More than spirituality is at stake. To relate isa journey, hand in hand, of self-exploration. When undertaken mutually, nothingbrings greater fulfillment.[images/Chop_9780307719195_epub_L02_r1.jpg]THE ESSENCERelationships run into problems when symptoms of contracted awareness arepresent, such asprojecting your negativity onto your partnerblaming and judging instead of taking responsibilityusing your partner to fill in missing pieces of yourselfgiving away your power, becoming dependentseizing power, trying to controlWhen these problems arise, the relationship contracts even more, because eachpartner is contracting.

Such a step has been long in coming. Most people definehealth solely in physical terms, by how good they feel and what they see whenthey look in the mirror. Prevention focuses on risk factors that are alsobasically physical: exercise, diet, and stress, with stress being given more lipservice than serious attention. Inertia poses a major problem here. Medicinerelies on drugs and surgery, which reinforces our fixation on the physical. Evenwhen holistic health programs are proposed, it’s common for people simply toexchange pharmaceuticals for herbs, processed food for organic food, and joggingfor yoga classes. The shift to a truly holistic approach doesn’t occur.To be holistic, your approach to health must take awareness into account.Awareness is an invisible factor that has powerful long-term effects on body andmind. Consider the following very basic questions:Do you feel confident that you could break old habits such as lack of exercise,overeating, or subjecting yourself to high stress?Is impulse control a struggle?Do you feel unhappy about your weight and body image?Do you promise yourself to exercise, but take any excuse not to?Does your enthusiasm for prevention come and go?How do you feel about the aging process?Is death a subject you avoid thinking about?In each of these questions there are two levels. The first has to do with aspecific risk factor, such as maintaining your proper weight and getting enoughexercise. As we all know by now, decades of public-health campaigns to getpeople to pay attention to the most basic preventive measures have not preventedan epidemic of obesity, the rise of lifestyle disorders like type 2 diabetes,and a more sedentary way of life—all of these negative trends are moving intolower age groups as well. One reason for such neglect of well-being is ourdisregard for the second level of well-being, which involves the mind.Well-being isn’t about treating your body right but harboring anxiety andforeboding about how many things might go wrong, or “risk factors.” Looking onlyoutside themselves, many people see a world full of risks—germs, toxins,carcinogens, pesticides, food additives, and the list goes on. They ignore theinner world, unless faced with a disorder like depression.Decades of studies have shown the harmful effects of negative attitudes, stress,loneliness, and emotional repression. If you take a step back, what do all thesefactors have in common? Contracted awareness. We become more isolated and shutin by mental walls than by the rooms we live in. Let’s consider the specifics ofhow contracted awareness leads to a negative state in the body.THE BODY’S SIGNALS ARE IGNORED OR DENIED.Over the past few decades a revolution has occurred in how we perceive the body.What appears to be an object, a thing, is actually a process. Nothing in thebody stands still, and life is sustained by something that sounds very abstract:information. Fifty trillion cells are constantly talking to each other, usingreceptor sites on the cell’s outer membrane that capture information frommolecules floating past in the bloodstream. Information is democratic. A messagefrom the liver is just as valid as information sent by the brain, and just asintelligent.When awareness is contracted, the flow of information is hampered, first in thebrain, because the brain physically represents the mind. But every cell iseavesdropping on the brain, or receiving instructions directly from it, andwithin seconds chemical messages deliver good or bad news everywhere in thesystem. At the most basic level, when you make bad lifestyle choices about diet,exercise, and stress, you are making a holistic decision. You cannot isolateyour choices from your body, which bears the repercussions of every negativechoice.The solution: Become more aware and accepting of your body. Stop judging againstit. Make connections through sensation and feelings; bring to the surface of ourawareness what has been blocked and rejected.HABITS TAKE HOLD AND IMPULSES ARE HARD TO CONTROL.Your body has no voice or will of its own. Whatever you choose to do, your bodyadapts. The range of its adaptability is miraculous. Human beings eat the widestdiet of any creature, live in the most varied climates, breathe air at thehighest and lowest altitudes, and respond to changes in the environment with thekind of creativity known to no other living thing except, ironically, the verylowest life-forms, viruses and bacteria. Without adaptability, none of us couldsurvive.Yet we also choose to constrict ourselves and refuse to adapt. This happensthrough habits. A habit is a fixed process that doesn’t change, even when youwant it to and the environment demands it. An extreme case would be addictions.An alcoholic receives negative feedback from his body; the people around him askfor change and exhibit extreme distress; the stress of being an addict continuesto mount. If an ordinary toxin were involved, such as eating a bad piece of fishor spoiled mayonnaise at a picnic, adaptation would kick in automatically anddrastically. The body would discharge the toxin, begin to purify, and reach arenewed state of balance as quickly as possible. But addictions are habits, andthey can block every recourse the body has to adapt, until the inevitablebreakdown results. In a less extreme way, you are blocking your body througheveryday habits like overeating and not exercising, but also through mentalhabits like worry and Type A control behavior.The solution: Before acting on a habit, pause. Ask yourself how you feel.Propose to yourself that other choices exist. Can you take another choice? Ifnot, what is stopping you? Habits are broken by stopping the automatic reflexand injecting new questions, from which new choices arise. Fighting against ahabit only makes it stronger. Losing the battle is inevitable, and when thathappens, self-judgment sets in.FEEDBACK LOOPS TURN NEGATIVE.The cells in the body don’t engage in a one-way conversation. Their talk iscross-talk, constantly weaving and interconnecting as messages flow through thebloodstream and nervous system. If one cell says, “I’m sick,” the others reply,“What can we do about it?” This is the basic mechanism known as a feedback loop.Feedback means that no message goes unanswered, no cry for help unheard. Unlikesociety, which gives plenty of negative feedback in the form of criticism,rejection, prejudice, and violence, your body sends only positive feedback.Cells seek to survive, and they can do that only through mutual support. Evenpain exists to alert you to areas that need healing.Yet we have a powerful ability to create negative feedback. Everyone’s body hassuffered from the conflict and confusion, fear and depression, grief and guiltthat run through the mind. Some of this we claim as our right. Human beings takepleasure from crying at sad movies, dwelling on other people’s misfortunes, andbeing shocked by catastrophes around the world. The problem is that we losecontrol of negative feedback. Depression is uncontrolled sadness; anxiety isfear that persists without being checked. This is the most complex area ofcontracted awareness, because it can take an entire lifetime to disrupt thebody’s feedback loops, or it can take a minute. Stress can hit youinstantaneously or grind away month after month. Yet there is always the samecause: awareness has drawn into a tight circle, contracting to defend itselffrom some kind of threat.The solution: Increase the positive feedback. This can happen internally orexternally. Seek the support of friends and counselors. Look inward and learn torelease negative energies like fear and anger. Your body wants to restore itsweakened or blocked feedback loops. Feedback is information. Whatever bringsmore information to your mind and body is beneficial.IMBALANCES AREN’T DETECTED UNTIL THEY REACH THE STAGE OF DISCOMFORT OR ILLNESS.In the West we tend to see health as a simple fork in the road: either you aresick or you are well. The two choices that face people come down to “I’m okay”or “I have to see a doctor.” But the body has many stages of imbalance beforedisease symptoms appear. These are recognized in Eastern traditional medicinelike Ayurveda, where a diagnosis can spot the first signs of imbalance and treatthem. The approach is more in keeping with nature, because a patient’s sense ofdiscomfort, even a vague feeling that something isn’t quite right, still servesas a reliable guide. It has been estimated that over 90 percent of seriousillness is first detected by the patient, not by the doctor.Imbalance covers a host of things, but primarily it means that your body can nolonger adapt. It has been forced to accept a state of discomfort, pain,diminished function, or shutdown, depending on how serious the problem is.Observing this at the microscopic level, one would see that the receptor sitesof various cells no longer send and receive a steady stream of messages, withoutwhich a cell’s normal life is impossible. Going out of balance is actually ascomplex as staying in balance (which is why a cure for cancer, the most drasticbehavior in cells, seems more distant and complicated as time goes by), but onemajor negative factor is awareness. Being well begins by being aware of yourbody. Nothing is more sensitive, and when awareness is withdrawn or becomesblocked, the body loses part of its ability to know itself, and monitoringbreaks down. As precise as medical tests may be, there is no substitute for theself-monitoring that goes on thousands of times per minute inside the mind-bodysystem.The solution: Break out of the duality of “I’m okay” and “I have to see adoctor.” There are many shades of gray, not a simple black or white. Payattention to our body’s subtle signals. Take them seriously; don’t withdraw yourattention. There is a vast array of hands-on healers, energy workers, andbody-oriented therapies that specifically address subtle imbalances before theyreach the stage of disease.AGING CREATES FEAR AND LOSS OF ENERGY.If aging were purely physical, it would affect people the same around the worldand in different eras of history. But this is far from the case. The breakdownof the body over time has shifted dramatically according to time and place. Forevery symptom of the aging process once considered normal, there are someindividuals who escape the symptom or even reverse it. Rare as they may be,there are people whose memory has improved with age, others who have gottenstronger by taking up exercise in their eighties or nineties, and still otherswith organs that function like someone ten, twenty, or even thirty yearsyounger.Physically, despite the huge advances in public health that have extended ourlife span, the body itself was always capable of longevity. Paleontologists havediscovered that Stone Age humans died through exposure to the elements,accidents, and other environmental factors like famine. Without these outsideinfluences, prehistoric people could potentially live as long as we do—witnesstribal societies that still live beyond modern civilization and that have a fewindividuals who survive into their eighties and nineties.Here is another area where too much emphasis on the physical aspects of aging isshortsighted. The creation of the “new old age” over the past few decades waslargely a shift in attitudes and expectations. When the elderly are set aside asuseless and worn out, unwanted and isolated, they conform to expectations.Passively awaiting decay and death, their decline fits the model imposed bysociety. The current generation that is becoming old has rejected thoseexpectations. In one poll of baby boomers, when asked what age they consideredto be the start of old age, the average responder said eighty-five! Peopleexpect to be healthy and active well beyond three score and ten. By and largethis new expectation is turning into reality.If someone objects, pointing to advances in the medical treatment of the elderlyas the chief cause for how long we live, two responses come to mind. First, suchadvances became possible only after medicine stopped giving up on the elderly.Second, doctors still lag far behind the public in embracing the new old age, ascan be shown by the pitifully small number of medical students who choosegerontology as their specialty. Yet without a doubt, whether viewed socially orpersonally, the aging process is powerfully affected by your state of awareness.The solution: Become part of the new old age. Resources for this are everywhere,so lack of support isn’t the issue. What’s critical is inertia and your responseto it. Becoming isolated and lonely doesn’t happen to most people overnight.There are months and years during which passivity and resignation begin to takehold. The period of late middle age (now expanded from fifty-five to seventy, ifnot beyond) gives you time to construct your own old age, building on the firsthalf of life not for declining years but for renewed inner values that can beexpressed in wiser, more fulfilled activity.DEATH IS THE MOST FEARFUL PROSPECT OF ALL.The last frontier to be conquered by awareness is death. That is inevitable,given that almost everyone avoids thinking about death. But at a deeper level,dying would seem to be immune to consciousness. After all, doesn’t the mindperish when the body does? What can being aware do about that, the finaltermination of itself? The answer, of course, is survival after death. The greatpromise of the afterlife is summarized in Saint Paul’s enticing words, “Death,where is thy sting? Grave, where is thy victory?” Almost all world religionsecho the same promise, that death doesn’t have the last word.But promises about the future do little to assuage the fears that visit here andnow. If you are afraid to die, your anxiety is probably hidden; you may deny itor refuse to feel that this is an important issue. No medical test has beendevised to show how cells are affected by a precise kind of fear, death asopposed to fear of spiders. Yet if you stand back, the most pervasive influenceon your whole life begins with how you feel about life and death. Once youdefine well-being in holistic terms, it is undeniable that being afraid of deathmust have consequences, such as feeling unsafe in the world, constantly beingvigilant about threats, and holding death to be more powerful than life. Only byreversing these consequences can a deep, abiding sense of well-being exist.The solution: Experience the meaning of transcendence. To transcend is to gobeyond an ordinary waking state. You already do that through fantasy, daydreams,visions of the future, imagination, and curiosity about the unknown. Taking theprocess a step further through meditation, contemplation, and self-reflection,you can expand your awareness to reach an experience of pure awareness. When youare established there, fear of death is replaced by knowing the state ofimmortality. This is what Saint Paul meant by “dying unto death.” You no longerfuel your fears and give them life. Instead, you activate the deepest level ofawareness and draw life from it.Disease and distress need to be healed. Yet over a lifetime, the key towell-being is a person’s coping skills. With poor coping skills, you become preyto every accident, setback, or disaster. With strong coping skills, you becomeresilient in the face of misfortune, and resilience has been shown repeatedly tobe present in people who survive to great old age with a sense of fulfillment.Coping begins in the mind. Your state of awareness is the foundation for allyour mental habits and attitudes. From there you develop the behavior of alifetime. Contracted awareness severely limits your behavior—ultimately that iswhy people indulge in activities that endanger their health. They can’t see away out because they are trapped inside a very limited vision of possibilities.We will have much more to say about coping skills as these chapters unfold. Mostpeople, sadly, haven’t looked at themselves this way. They haven’t found theroot cause of their dis-ease and distress. The usual recommendations to improveour lifestyles is valid enough, but a higher level of well-being awaits whenpeople tap into the true source of all fulfillment."},{"pageContent":"SUCCESSSuccess is so eagerly pursued that you would suppose it to be well understood.Certain advantages—being born rich, going to the right college, making socialand business connections—are generally seen as keys to success. But researchundercuts these factors; they do not predict success very well, and somesuccessful people rise to the top without any external advantages. When askedhow they became successful, the most common factor that leading businessmen giveis luck; they found themselves in the right place at the right time. Thisimplies that if you want to be successful, your best course might be to throwyourself into the hands of random chance.If there is a better approach to success, we first have to ask what successactually is. A simple definition that cuts through much confusion is this:success is the result of a series of good decisions. Someone who makes the rightchoices in life is going to reach a much better result than someone who makesbad choices. This holds true despite setbacks and failures along the way. Asevery successful person attests, their road to achievement was marked withtemporary failures, from which they took positive lessons and thus were able tomove forward.What, then, goes into a good decision? Which choices ensure a positive outcome?Now we come to the heart of the mystery, because there is no formula for goodchoices. Life is dynamic and constantly changing. Tactics that worked last yearor last week often don’t work anymore because circumstances have changed. Hiddenvariables come into play. No formula can account for the unknown, and despiteour best efforts to analyze what is going on today, there is no getting aroundthe fact that tomorrow is unknown. By itself, the unknown constitutes a mystery.Mysteries are entertaining in fiction; in real life they bring a mixture ofanxiety, confusion, and uncertainty.How you deal with the unknown determines how well you make choices. Baddecisions are the result of applying the past to the present, trying to repeatsomething that once worked. The worst decisions are made by applying the past sorigidly that you are blind to anything else. We can break down bad decisionsinto specifics. What we see is that each factor is rooted in contractedawareness. By its very nature, contracted awareness is rigid, defensive, limitedin scope, and dependent on the past. The past is known, and when people aren’table to cope with the unknown, they have little choice but to remember the past,using old decisions and habits as their guide—a very fallible guide, as it turnsout.For each factor that holds you back, the solution is to expand your awareness,leaving limitation behind to discover a clearer vision of the problem. Beforeyou read the following list, consider a really bad choice that you made—inrelationships, career, finances, or any other critical area—and measure itagainst the aspects of contracted awareness as applied to decision-making.LOOKING BACK ON YOUR BAD CHOICESDid you have limited vision of the problem you faced?Did you act on impulse, despite your better judgment?In the back of your mind, were you panicked by fear of making the wrongdecision?How many obstacles came out of the blue, unforeseen in advance?Did your ego get in the way, making you the victim of false pride?Were you unwilling to see how much the situation had changed?Did you focus too much on seeming to be in control? At a deeper level, did youfeel out of control?Did you ignore other people who tried to stop you or change your mind?Did you overlook a hidden agenda, such as wanting to fail so that you wouldn’thave to take full responsibility?This quiz isn’t offered to discourage you. Quite the opposite. Once you bringinto view the drawbacks of contracted awareness, the advantage of expandedawareness becomes completely evident. Let’s take each factor one at a time.LIMITED PERSPECTIVEIn any situation, we never have enough information. Too many variables enterinto difficult choices. Since we all make decisions based on less than totalknowledge, our limited perspective handicaps us. You can overcome suchlimitations to a certain extent by learning more about the situation; that is avaluable thing to do, so far as rational solutions go. But imagine choosing yourlife partner by first reading their past history in complete detail, leaving outnot a single day since they were born. Imagine choosing a job by first analyzingevery business decision your prospective employer ever made. The more variablesyou try to take into account, the more ambiguous everything looks.The solution: Take into account only the information that affects success orfailure. No rational model exists for doing this, but at the level of pureawareness, all variables are being computed at the same time. When you expandyour awareness, you don’t have to sort out a host of confusing factors. Thecritical factors for making a good choice come to mind from the source, which iswithin you, not in the external environment.IMPULSIVENESSActing on impulse is emotional, and most bad decisions are impulsive. That partis no mystery. (As one popular adage puts it, “Ready, fire, aim.”) Turningdecision-making into a rational process is the holy grail of many researchers,who see emotions and personal bias as the enemy of clear-sighted choices. Butall such efforts have failed, because emotions are woven into every decision. Ifyou are in a good mood, you are likely to pay too much for an item, buy it on awhim, overestimate how well the future will turn out, and be blinded to thenegatives in your situation.The usual answer to emotional bias is impulse control. Being able to control ourimpulses is considered a crucial aspect of emotional intelligence. Apparentlythere are predictors for this from a very early age. In one experiment a childis told that he can have a piece of candy right now, or, if he waits fifteenminutes, he can have two pieces of candy. Only a minor percentage of very youngchildren will take the second option, but those who do are likely to have goodimpulse control for life. They can tell immediate gratification from delayedgratification and choose the latter. The catch-22 is that the better you are atcontrolling your impulses, the less you will trust a snap decision, and snapdecisions have been shown to be more right than not. Pausing to analyze adecision tends to lead to worse, not better choices.The solution: Know when to choose now and when to choose later. This isn’tsomething that fits any model. Some impulses lead to good outcomes, others leadto disappointment. At the level of pure awareness impulses are aligned withfuture outcomes, which means that what you want to do at this very moment willturn out to be right for the future. With expanded awareness, you spontaneouslyhave the right impulse, and if you don’t, you instinctively recognize that youneed to pause and reconsider.FEAR OF FAILUREGood decision-makers are considered to be bold and fearless. With that in mind,most of us fake it, trying to appear more confident and sure of ourselves thanwe really feel. The great frauds in history achieved their success by masteringa look of complete self-confidence. But in reality the most momentous decisionsare made in the presence of fear and anxiety; a glance at photographs of Lincolnduring the Civil War and of Winston Churchill during the Blitz of World War IItestifies to their depression, worry, and sorrow.When fear is an inescapable factor, the real question is how to keep it fromdestroying your clarity of mind. Someone who is blinded by fear usually feels atthe emotional level that a powerful impulse must be followed; they are tooafraid to make any other choice. What is more insidious is hidden fear, becauseyou may make the same bad choice as another person who is full of anxiety, yetyou will delude yourself into believing that you are not anxious. The paradoxhere is that we pick leaders who act the most confident, but such leaders arealmost guaranteed to make bad decisions due to lack of self-knowledge.The solution: Find the level in yourself that is actually fearless. This levellies deep within. On the surface the mind is unruly, agitated with the effectsof anxiety. A layer below that, the voice of fear continually talks about risks,failure, and worst-case scenarios. At the next layer, other voices make the casefor reality, pointing out that fear is convincing but not always right. Onlywhen you can transcend this level do you reach the true self, which views everysituation without fear. This is because fear comes from the past, arising frommemory of pain. The true self lives in the present; therefore it has no contactwith old hurts and wounds. In clarity it can see that risks and bad scenariosexist—these aren’t shoved aside or denied—yet in seeing the negatives there isno coloration of fear.UNFORESEEN OBSTACLES AND SETBACKSIn the state of contracted awareness, uncertainty is your enemy. You don’t fullyknow how other people are going to behave, and even if you got sworn affidavitswith promises to act a certain way, other people don’t know how they will behavein the future. Society is in constant flux between things that remain more orless reliable and things that nobody foresees. The so-called black swan theoryeven holds that history is determined far more by totally surprising, anomalousevents than by anything one could have predicted. Individuals seem to feel thesame way about their own biographies—as I mentioned above, the most successfulamong us owe their rise, as they see it, to good luck.More common than good luck is bad luck or no luck at all. The popularity ofMurphy’s Law is due to the inevitability of obstacles, though there may notactually be a natural law that if something can go wrong, it will. Blindpessimism is as unrealistic as blind optimism. But a good deal of successinvolves the ability to cope with unforeseeable setbacks. The best marriageshave nothing to do with being perfect, but with coping skills. Everyone has aright to behave erratically, and when this results in conflicts, demanding thatother people get back on track and behave predictably doesn’t work. Still lessdoes it work to retreat from life because you can’t handle the knocks.The solution: Make uncertainty your ally, not your enemy. All leaps forwarddepend on reaching into the unknown. Once you see the unknown as the source ofcreativity, you no longer fear it. Instead, you welcome the fact that liferenews itself in unexpected ways. This attitude cannot be applied arbitrarily,however. Unforeseen obstacles reflect a genuine inability to see deeper, andwhat you cannot see has no power to aid you. It takes expanded awareness to opena channel to the underlying creativity that exists within you.EGOIf you want others to follow you, make yourself look larger than life. Thebigger your ego, the more people will use you as an umbrella. Human nature seemsto force those who feel weak to give away even more of their power. But ego isalmost as bad in decision-making as fear. One overestimates dangers, while theother won’t admit that dangers exist. Under the sway of ego, a person mustperform constantly. The one thing the ego is good at is building up an image,and images demand that you put on a show that other people will believe in.It is exhausting, therefore, to devote so much energy to being a winner, whileeven more energy must be expended to keeping self-doubt at bay. Anyone who hasdrawn close to world-famous celebrities senses the unreality that surroundsthem, and without reality, there is no basis for good decisions. Ironically,famous people make bad choices because everyone around them says yes toeverything. Unbounded freedom is a spiritual state; when the ego pretends to beunbounded, it isn’t free but trapped in illusion.The solution: Act from the true self, where “I” is no longer personal. Instead,the ego of the true self is simply a focus for perception—you have a uniqueperspective without investing in it. As awareness expands, the ego doesn’t die,but changes jobs. The old job was to look after number one; the new job is tolook out for the whole situation. You no longer have such a personal stake inthe world. Our aim is to benefit yourself while causing no harm to others.Ideally, what you want leads to benefits for everyone. That ideal is onlyattained at the level of pure awareness, however. At every other level there isduality, and with duality there is a clash between “me” and “you,” as we pursueseparate self-interests. In expanded awareness you take a closer step towardunifying duality, and as that happens, automatically the conflict betweenseparate selves begins to be resolved.UNWILLINGNESS TO CHANGE AND ADAPTAdaptation comes naturally to the body, as we have seen. For a cell to survive,it must respond to the messages that arrive this very minute. Our minds,however, are not comfortable living completely in the moment. Like an inchworm,which keeps half its length on one leaf while reaching the other half to a newleaf, we rely on the past to guide the present. This tactic works in situationswhere you have to remember a skill; it would be futile, for example, to decidethat driving a car must be learned every day. Obviously all knowledge is anaccumulation; you build on the past in order to know more in the present.Where the problem arises is psychologically. The past is your psychologicalenemy when it “teaches” you that old hurts, wounds, humiliations, failures, andobstacles are relevant to the present. Most people know the value of beingadaptable. Few of us announce at a meeting that we are rigid; we pay lip serviceto being flexible. Even so, we find ourselves making decisions based on thepast, which means that behind every open mind is a mind firmly closed.A closed mind isn’t like a clenched fist, which you can open voluntarily.Something inside tells you that you must be closed. This is hard to understandwhen it isn’t affecting you. If you have no racial, ethnic, or religiousbigotry, you can’t easily comprehend that prejudice feels involuntary. Choiceisn’t an option. Reality itself is dictated by prejudice, so that the mere sightof a person who comes from a different race, religion, or ethnicity is enmeshedwith prejudicial beliefs. In the same way, the fusing of past and present in ourminds is occurring unconsciously. Even more insidiously, rigid thinking actslike a defensive wall, turning new ideas into threats for no other reason thanthat they are new. Giving up your old ways is equated with personal defeat orexposing yourself to an enemy.The solution: Live from the level of the self that is always present. You cannotwill your past to go away. Everyone drags around the burden of memory. Even ifyou could somehow obliterate your past hurts and failures, it wouldn’t bepossible to make your amnesia selective. You would also lose the positiveaspects of your past, including your emotional education, personal growth, andaccumulated knowledge. Memories, for good and ill, are woven into your personalself. Fortunately the true self does not have to be guilty from personalexperience. It exists in and of itself; it is the vehicle for pure awareness.The more your awareness expands, the lighter the burden of the past. You findspontaneously that your attention is focused on the present, from which allcreative possibilities emerge.LOSS OF CONTROLBeing in control is a thorny issue. Some people, who psychologically fall intothe category of control types, cannot be comfortable with even small amounts ofchaos and imperfection. They go too far in the direction of trying to controlother people and their surroundings. Another personality type ignoresself-control and creates an environment that has almost no boundaries orstructures. Both are examples of contracted awareness, each in a different way.Problems arise when control is either lost or becomes too dominant. Most of uswould never make a choice that takes away self-control. For some that meansjumping out of an airplane with a parachute, for others that means putting moneyinto a risky venture like oil wells. Risk and control are closely related. Whenyour tolerance for risk is exceeded, what happens? A rational risk becomes athreat instead, and threats make us feel that we will no longer be in control.The more contracted your awareness is, the less reliable is your sense of risk.Thus you feel overly threatened, even by small risks, and you wind up makingdecisions within tight boundaries. Paradoxically, when you feel really paralyzedis the moment when you are likely to act recklessly; your sudden decision,almost always a bad one, comes about because you want to escape the stress ofnot making any decision.The solution: Replace risk with certainty. You have no worries about losingcontrol if you aren’t threatened. Once you are certain about yourself, externalthreats don’t exist anymore, because threat is the same as fear, and knowing whoyou are is a fearless state. Who you are is the true self. Expanded awarenesstakes you closer to the true self; therefore, fear decreases. When that happens,the issue of control lessens. In its place you experience a state of increasedfreedom. Reality is allowed to be beyond your control—it always was to beginwith—and you feel comfortable joining in.OPPOSITION FROM OTHER PEOPLEBad decisions are made when you don’t know whom to listen to. The worstdecisions are made when you can’t even decide whom to trust. There will alwaysbe contending voices in the room; total agreement is suspicious whenever itoccurs, in fact. Somebody isn’t telling the truth. When faced with widelydiffering opinions, most people choose the ones they already agree with. If youlook back on the times you seriously asked for advice, you’ll probably discoverthat what you really wanted was permission to act the way you were going to actanyway. Your motive wasn’t to get the best advice; you wanted to feel good abouta choice that contained an element of doubt, shame, or guilt.Contracted awareness is isolating. You are more alone with thoughts and beliefsthat are completely private. One effect of being isolated is that other peopleseem to be far away. You can’t reach out to them; sometimes you can’t even finda way to communicate with them. The most common example is teenagers, whoisolate themselves from their parents as they move from childhood dependency toadult independence. Adolescence is the limbo in between those two states, whenno one seems to be on your side except other teenagers. But the isolation of oldage resembles being an adolescent in the shared attitude of “no one understandsme” (one reason that the very old are sometimes the only refuge foradolescents).The solution: Understand yourself completely. It is futile to seek to becompletely understood by others. No one else has the time to understand whereyou are coming from except in a fairly superficial way. And even if you spenttime with the most empathic person in the world, someone who wanted tounderstand you down to the last detail, what would be achieved? They would havefull knowledge of a person who was constructed from the haphazard circumstancesof the past, a rickety, jerry-built collection of old experiences. To trulyunderstand yourself is to know the true self. With that knowledge comes completetrust in yourself. Once you have that, the opinions of others can be seenwithout threat, and you will have a reliable inner guide that allows you toweigh fairly, without undue personal bias, what contending voices are tellingyou. Even more important, those other voices will be much less contentious. Thesecret of operating from expanded awareness is that you are already aligned withthe right choice. Others can sense that, which makes them more willing tocooperate.HIDDEN PERSONAL AGENDASMost adults have enough experience to judge when someone else has an agenda.Usually agendas fall into predictable categories. There are givers and takers.There are the ambitious and the timid, the selfish and the selfless. It’scrucial to society that we wear our agendas on our sleeves. Otherwise, doubt andsuspicion play too great a part. Cooperation collapses when you can’t trustother people’s motives. At bottom, your own motives are about getting what youwant, making your dreams turn into reality.The snag is that some agendas are hidden, even from the person who has them. Weare trapped between “I must” and “I won’t.” If you have to be liked or tobelong, you might not realize how powerfully this “must” affects you, but if youwere asked to fire an employee, say no to grown children asking for money, ortake an unpopular stand about same-sex marriage, for example, your hidden agendawould make those actions difficult if not impossible. Or consider misers and thehabitually stingy. Hidden inside is a fear of lack, and since this fear isn’tbeing confronted, it gets acted out instead. No amount of hoarding or stinginesswill make up for the lack, which is psychological, not material. All hiddenagendas are psychological, and whatever they are, they will lead to baddecisions because of the contracted state that they are coming from.The solution: Renounce personal agendas. This involves bringing them to lightfirst. Then you must turn over the rocks and look at what is hiding underneath,which is almost always fear. Fear is the most powerful force contractinganyone’s awareness; it demands that we retreat, put up barriers, and defendourselves. But it becomes far easier to renounce your hidden agendas if youexpand your awareness. Bringing the light is always better than fighting thedarkness. The true self is the source of light, and you need to discover thatthe true self is available. Nothing is truer than Jesus’ teaching, “You are thelight of the world,” and yet it seems easier to believe that the light comesfrom outside ourselves. Hard as it is to claim your darkness, it is almost ashard to claim your light. Fortunately the light is timeless, and even if youturn away from it, messages from your true self never stop being sent.The ultimate success is to live in the light permanently. Then there are norigid boundaries, no fears, no limitations. As with everything, the point of ourlives is to realize who we are. Once you are established in your own being, thestruggles that hinder success melt away. The next time you succeed at anything,even in bringing a smile to a child or appreciating the sun setting over thesea, remind yourself that you have taken a step closer to the real measure ofsuccess, the pure awareness that is your source and the source of everyhappiness you’ve ever experienced.[images/Chop_9780307719195_epub_L02_r1.jpg]THE ESSENCEBy ordinary measures success is unpredictable. So many factors create it, andsome, like timing and opportunity, appear to be random. But what is success? Aseries of decisions that leads to a positive result. If decision-making can bemaximized, success is far more likely.Decisions based on contracted awareness are unlikely to work out well, becauseof the following drawbacks:limited perspectiveimpulsivenessfear of failureunforeseen obstacles and setbacksegounwillingness to change and adaptloss of controlopposition from other peoplehidden personal agendasWith the expansion of awareness, each of those drawbacks begins to lessen, anddecisions begin to be supported at a deeper level. In pure awareness alldecisions are in line with the universe and the underlying laws that govern boththe inner and outer worlds.[images/Chop_9780307719195_epub_L03_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"PERSONAL GROWTHGetting closer to your true self has many practical benefits. So far we havefocused on the practical side, because it is crucial for spirituality to solvethe very real problems that people face. But if you are a parent raising a youngchild, it would be shortsighted to think of walking, talking, and reading aspractical things only. We don’t say to a toddler, “Start walking. You may needto run after a bus to get to work.” To grow from infancy to childhood, fromadolescence to adulthood is valuable in itself. Life unfolds in all its richnessas we unfold. The inner and outer worlds mesh into a single process known asliving.Spirituality has its own value, leaving aside all the practical considerations.When you are alone, facing no problems or crises, the situation doesn’t call forsolutions. Yet your need for spirituality is greater than ever. When youconsider what it means simply to exist, the true self beckons. It can tell youwho you really are, and nothing is more valuable. That’s a grand pronouncement,I know. Anyone can spend a rewarding lifetime ignoring the riddle of “Who am I?”Or, to be more precise, people answer the question by identifying with theeveryday self. “I am” can be followed with countless words that apply toordinary existence. I am my job, my relationships, my family. I am my money andpossessions, my status and importance. Into the equation you can add race,ethnicity, politics, and religion. The everyday self is an expanding suitcasecrammed with every thought, feeling, memory, and dream you’ve ever had.And yet for all that, the true self has not really been touched. The soul, theessence, the source—by whatever name, your deepest identity doesn’t unfoldwithout personal growth. Spirituality is voluntary, and in the modern age thevast majority of people opt out. Now that we’ve covered the practical reasonsfor not opting out, it’s time to see whether the true self is worth seeking forits own worth, not just for what it can accomplish. Lofty ideals are not what weneed, either. We need to experience the true self and say, “I choose you over myeveryday self.” A new kind of self-worth is implied, and a higher kind of love.The bliss of simply existing, if you can experience it, would be chosen byanyone over the ups and downs of ordinary existence, the fragile happiness thatis always accompanied by sadness, anxiety, and disappointment.The everyday self is already flooded with experiences. To arrive at a deeperlevel requires a process that takes you higher. On a daily basis you must orientyourself to grow in the following areas:A PATH TO THE TRUE SELF Maturity—developing into an independent adult Purpose—finding a reason to be here Vision—adopting a worldview to live by “Second attention”—seeing with the eyes of the soul Transcendence—going beyond the restless mind and the five senses Liberation—becoming free of the “reality illusion”Your success in these areas depends on your really wanting them to unfold.Personal growth involves the same things that go into learning how to play thepiano or to master French cooking: desire, motivation, practice, repetition, anddiscipline. This is your life you want to transform. A generation ago it wasunusual to hear anyone speak about personal growth in these terms. “Finding yourtrue potential” was just emerging as a catchphrase, along with “consciousnessraising.” Can we say that either one showed people how to reach the goal? Didthousands of aspiring seekers manage to transform themselves? Sadly, the answerwas usually no. To find success, you must acquire a trait that protects you fromfickleness, illusion, self-indulgence, and loss of motivation. That trait issobriety. Sobriety is a combination of serious intent and realism. It is anexpanded state of awareness that has to be cultivated. If you don’t walk thewalk, you will remain in a contracted state of the kind known as everydayexistence.Let me apply sobriety, then, to each point on the preceding list.MATURITYMaturity is a psychological state, not a physical one. It involves things likeemotional balance, self-reliance, moderation, and the possession of foresight.Children aren’t expected to have those things. Adolescents move erratically intheir direction. If the journey isn’t completed, you can be fifty while stillviewing the world through the mind of a fifteen-year-old. The demands ofeveryday life tend to work against maturity. There are so many distractions andpressures that a person can use as excuses.You can even say that society now devalues maturity. Mass media creates theillusion that being young and hip is much more fun. By comparison, not arrivinglate at work or staying after to finish up some paperwork is deadly dull. But inreality the young are more stressed and anxious than at any other stage of life.Immaturity begins with the brightness of youth, but it wanes over the yearsbecause to remain immature is to miss the learning curve that allows you tomaster your life. Maturity doesn’t sound like a spiritual word, but unless thespiritual path is grounded in mature psychology, it quickly evaporates intowispy dreams.Reaching maturity means that you practice the following on a daily basis: Takeresponsibility for yourself. Provide the necessaries of life without dependingon others. Stand up for moral values and play your part in keeping societytogether, beginning with the basic unit of society, your family. Treat otherswith respect and expect the same in return. Behave fairly and work towardjustice in every situation. Learn the value of restraint and self-possession.PURPOSEAlmost no one would say that they lead a purposeless life. We don’t randomly putone foot ahead of the other. Our lives are formed around short-term andlong-term goals. Yet, despite this, at a deeper level countless people do wonderwhy they are here. They regard with nostalgia a bygone time when being a goodChristian, obeying God’s laws, fitting into one’s social class, or defendingyour country—among many other kinds of ready-made purposes—was enough to givelife meaning. We are left to find our own purpose, one person at a time. Buthere nostalgia is misplaced. It was always true that life’s real purpose was tobe found through a personal search.I’ve offered the true self as a purpose worth devoting yourself to. Short ofthat, you can find purpose simply through growing and evolving. Looking to theunseen horizon, your purpose could be as profound as reaching enlightenment. Ifyou are suspicious of being told what your purpose in life should be, that’shealthy. The most one should accept is inspiration, which is also the most onecan give. The point is to remain aware of your purpose, whatever it is. Everydayexistence tends to blur our purpose for being here, swamping it in mundanepractical demands. Purpose only survives by paying serious attention to it.Reaching your purpose means that you practice the following on a daily basis: Doat least one thing that is selfless. Read a passage of scripture, poetry, orinspirational prose that makes you feel uplifted. Share your ideals with someonewho feels sympathetic. Without proselytizing, express your purpose for beinghere; aim to inspire with modesty, not to persuade with force. Help yourchildren to find their purpose; make them see that this is important. Act fromyour highest values. Don’t sink to the level of those who criticize or opposeyou.VISIONWhen I was young I committed to memory a quotation from the poet Robert Browningthat in our grandparents’ day was known by almost everyone: “A man’s reachshould exceed his grasp, or what’s a heaven for?” The religious context may havefaded away, but it is still necessary to aspire. Our highest aspirations speakto the visionary side of the true self. There are practical aspirations, ofcourse, that are not visionary, such as aspiring to make partner in a law firmor to earn a billion dollars. Material aspirations occupy the front of people’sminds, yet in reaching them they don’t attain heaven or any other higher ground.The gap between everyday life and the soul remains wide. The yearning forsomething more isn’t fulfilled.A vision is broader than a purpose. It embraces a worldview, which impliesaction. You step outside the worldview of those who don’t share the same vision.Walking the spiritual path unites you with generations of other visionaries. Atthe same time, however, you can’t ride two horses—the demands of material lifeare renounced. This isn’t the same as giving up on comfort and success. One kindof vision sees such a wide separation between the worldly and the spiritual thatmaterialism is turned into an enemy of the soul. Fortunately, there’s anothervision that speaks of renunciation, not through physical means but as a neworientation. You put your highest value on spiritual growth while maintainingyour everyday life, even engaging in it fully. This is what is meant by being inthe world but not of it.Reaching your vision means that you practice the following on a daily basis:Look beyond everyday events to their higher meaning. What is your soul trying totell you? Question your habits of consumption. Put material success in itsproper place. Leave time to be with yourself. Put your values to the test bytrusting in the universe or God to take care of you. Appreciate the presentmoment. See others around you as reflections of your inner reality. Read deeplyinto the scriptures and literature that express your vision.“SECOND ATTENTION”Being in the world but not of it has to be real, not simply an ideal. We areengulfed by the material world and its demands. How can we put it in its properplace while still earning a living, raising a family, and enjoying somecomforts? The answer lies at the level of attention. The things you considermost important draw your attention, and in essence they become your world, yourreality. For someone fixated on his career, work becomes his reality becausethat’s what he pays the most attention to. In an age of faith, God became realfor the same reason. People didn’t necessarily meet God personally or haveexperiences of the divine but hours of every day were spent either in devotionor doing God’s work.In spiritual terms, this single-minded focus can be called first attention. Butthere’s a different flavor of awareness, so to speak, known as second attention.With second attention you see through the eyes of the soul. To put itsuccinctly:First attention: From this level of awareness a person focuses on events in thephysical world, pursues individual desires, accepts social values of family,work, and worship, sees the world in linear terms, operating through cause andeffect, and accepts the boundaries of time and space.Second attention: From this level of attention a person transcends the physicalworld, follows intuition and insight, accepts that the soul is the basis of theself, seeks his source in the timeless, aspires to higher states ofconsciousness, and trusts in invisible forces that connect the individual withthe cosmos.Second attention connects with the true self and takes you to the essence ofreality. This essence can never be destroyed or completely suppressed. The soulawaits its resurrection, not through an apocalyptic end of time but through eachindividual beginning to wake up.Reaching second attention means that you practice the following on a dailybasis: Listen to the quietest part of yourself, trusting that its messages aretrue. Put less trust in the physical world, and more on the inner world. Learnto center yourself. Don’t make decisions when you are not centered. Don’tmistake frantic action for results; results come from a deeper level of being.Bond with at least one other person from the soul. Seek silent communion withyourself and your surroundings. Spend time in the natural world, soaking up itsbeauty. See past the mask of personality that people wear in public. Expressyour truth as simply as possible.TRANSCENDENCEThe phrase to transcend means to go beyond, but how can you really know if youhave? In a parable from my childhood, a holy man sits in a cave until the dayarrives when he reaches the cherished goal of enlightenment. He cannot wait totell the good news to the villagers in the valley down below. All the way downthe mountain the holy man is in bliss. He’s walking through the marketplace onhis way to the temple when somebody pokes him accidentally in the ribs.“Out of my way!” the holy man shouts angrily.Then he stops, thinks for a second, and turns around to go back to his caveagain.This could be read as a parable about false pride, but it’s also abouttranscending. If you are really established in your true self, the knockabout ofthe everyday world doesn’t shake you. You feel detached, but not because youdon’t care or because you have zoned out. Spiritual detachment means that youview the world from a timeless place. The place isn’t found in a cave on aremote mountaintop. There can be no location for this place except inside you.In practical terms, to transcend involves finding such a place, knowing it, andmaking it your home.The traditional methods for transcending lead to second attention. These aremeditation, contemplation, and self-reflection. Time has not made these methodsoutdated, but there’s no denying that as modern life becomes more stressful, asthe everyday world gets noisier and faster, people have less time formeditation. Even setting aside a few minutes a day somehow slips away and bestintentions are forgotten. It would be worrisome if personal growth couldn’t beachieved because of external distractions. Personal growth can’t be destroyed,however, but only postponed. As long as the true self is real, we will beattracted to it, because deep down each of us has a craving for reality. Wedon’t want to base our lives on illusion. To go beyond, then, isn’t about anyorganized spiritual practice. It’s about following your own nature as you seekgreater happiness and fulfillment. Spiritual practices have no value except asan aid to get you to your goal.I fully agree with the teaching that true meditation is twenty-four hours a day.There is great value in setting aside a time-out for sitting silently andexperiencing a deeper state inside. But once you open your eyes, refreshed andmore centered, what good will it do to throw yourself back into stress andstrain? The crucial issue is how to bring inner silence into the real world andmake a difference. That’s the part that takes twenty-four hours, because it’s afull-time occupation to become aware of who you really are. It’s also a joyfuloccupation, and the most fascinating project you could possibly undertake foryourself.Reaching the transcendent means that you practice the following on a dailybasis: Stay centered. Notice the external influences that are making demands onyour attention. When carried away by a strong emotion or impulse, take a momentto come back to yourself. Walk away from stressful situations when you can.Don’t remain in any situation that makes you so uncomfortable that you aren’tyourself. Don’t give in to the anxiety of others. Be mindful that you are morethan a set of reactions to your environment—you are an expression of the trueself, always. In every situation where you feel confused, ask, “What is my rolehere?” Until you find out, don’t act or make decisions. Hang loose until realitybegins to reveal itself a little more.LIBERATIONIn a spiritual vein it is said that creation is the eternal play ofopposites—good versus evil, light versus darkness, order versus chaos. Yet theultimate drama is played out over illusion versus reality. No one wakes upthinking that it’s going to be a good day for living in illusion. We assume thatour personal reality is real, and therefore it’s baffling to realize thateverything we see, hear, touch, taste, and smell could be an illusion instead.Modern science has already provided a basis for dissolving the physical world.Every solid object disappears into invisible packets of energy when you delveinto the subatomic level, and beyond that, even energy collapses into aconstruct that has no boundaries in time and space, the so-called wave function.If you want to lead a life based on reality, the fact that the physical world isan illusion cannot be taken merely as a curious fact, to be ignored as youcontinue to do what you always do. Just as matter vanishes when you go deepenough, so do time and space. They spring from the quantum vacuum, a void thatappears to contain nothing, but that in actuality serves as the origin of everyevent since the Big Bang, along with infinite possibilities that have not yetemerged in the cosmos. In the world’s spiritual traditions, the state ofinfinite possibilities is not a faraway, unimaginable condition but the veryground state of existence.The true self liberates you because it brings you out of limitation, groundingyou in a reality that is timeless, without boundaries, and infinite in itspossibilities. The whole issue of illusion versus reality must become personalif you want to be free (we’ll discuss this in more detail in the final sectionof this book). The first step is a moment of disillusion. You stand back andadmit that you do not really know the basis of your existence. By surrenderingto what you don’t know, you can allow knowledge to flow in. That’s the truemeaning of surrender. You are like a prisoner who stares at four narrow wallslit by a small window high up. The prisoner faces reality if he admits that heis in prison.But what if he doesn’t? What if he thinks that his cell is the whole world? Thenhis notion of freedom would be insane. The same conclusion applies to each of usin our limited lives, but we don’t label ourselves insane. After all, everyonewe know accepts being imprisoned as normal. Only a small, strange band ofsaints, sages, and visionaries sends up a loud cry for freedom. When you hearthat cry, the beginning of transformation is at hand. Liberation is real becausethe timeless is real, more real than anything your five senses detect.Reaching liberation means that you practice the following on a daily basis: Seebeyond your limited situation. Take as your first principle that you are a childof the universe. Dwell on those moments when you feel free, exhilarated,unbounded. Tell yourself that you have touched what is truly real. Seek love asyour birthright, along with bliss and creativity. Dedicate yourself to exploringthe unknown. Know that there is something infinitely precious beyond the reachof the five senses.Someone might protest, “How can I ever change? This is all so overwhelming.There’s too much to do.” I sympathize. When you lay out the particulars ofpersonal growth, the panorama looks vast. It’s for good reason that the Indiantradition speaks of enlightenment as being like a gold palace, which bringsbliss and freedom, while dismantling your old reality is like tearing down ahut, which brings panic and dismay as the walls collapse around you. To statethe case without metaphors, when you look around, the world seems real. And soit is, but it’s a reality without the true self. When you reach the end of thejourney, you look around, and once more the world looks real. Only this time youare fully awake, established in the true self. In between these two poles, lifeis confusing. There are days when you get it. Events unfold as if someoneupstairs were watching over you (in fact, you are watching over yourself). Thereare other days when the spiritual life vanishes like a dream, and you are miredin the same hard slog as everyone else.What keeps you going? Think of children and how they develop. Through good daysand bad, through smiles and tears, a hidden reality is unfolding. The surface oflife doesn’t tell the real tale of neural pathways, genes, and hormones as theycome together in concert to make a new person out of the unformed material wewere given at birth. Nature protects our growth. Spiritual growth is liberatedfrom that kind of determinism. Destiny is no longer biology. You have to make achoice to evolve, but that, too, is natural. If evolution is going to shift fromthe body to the mind, then the mind must enter into the decisions that determinehow you evolve. Despite life’s ups and downs, the project of evolving isn’tcomplex. All you need to ask is one question: If I choose X, will it add to myevolution or take away from it?You may not like asking that question. There are plenty of times when immediatepleasure or recklessly giving in to an impulse is more attractive. You may notlike the answer you get, either. Evolution is usually unselfish, and we are allconditioned to look out for number one, either from greed or from desperation.None of these obstacles matter; nor does resistance, disappointment, orbacksliding. As long as you can ask that one question—If I choose X, will it addto my evolution or take away from it?—you are stepping toward freedom. The greatwisdom teachers would declare that failure is impossible, in fact. Simply to askyourself if you are evolving is evolution itself.[images/Chop_9780307719195_epub_L02_r1.jpg]THE ESSENCEYour true self is the real you, but how can this be experienced? The everydayself is already flooded with experiences. To arrive at a deeper level requires aprocess. On a daily basis you orient yourself to grow in the following areas: Maturity—developing into an independent adult Purpose—finding a reason to be here Vision—adopting a worldview to live by “Second attention”—seeing with the eyes of the soul Transcendence—going beyond the restless mind and the five senses Liberation—becoming free of boundaries and attachmentsWhen all these aspects of your true self begin to grow, they combine toward onegoal: breaking down the “reality illusion” that keeps you from knowing who youreally are. The end of the reality illusion marks the stage of evolution knownas enlightenment.[images/Chop_9780307719195_epub_L03_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"[images/Chop_9780307719195_epub_003_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":" Nothing can replace connecting with people grappling with problems in real life.This book grew out of letters written from around the world, and in this sectionyou’ll find a selection of them.Each writer felt troubled, and most felt unable to solve their dilemmas. The aimwith my answers was always to open up a fresh perspective, following theprinciple that the level of the answer is never the level of the problem.Feeling UnlovableI’ve worked hard to change my life for the better, but I continually deal withnegative thinking even when things are actually okay. I get into a space ofhating myself and thinking that the love people show me is a fiction. I’veconquered a lot in my life, but this pattern is affecting my relationships andhow I treat myself. How do I change?—Evelyn, 43, TorontoWhat you are talking about is past conditioning, and it affects us all. Whetheryou call these influences from the past emotional debt or karma, they functionthe same way. A new experience enters the mind, but instead of being evaluatedfor itself, the experience is shunted down a well-worn track. This happens soautomatically that we don’t have time to intervene. Let’s say that pastconditioning tells you that you are unlovable. Then when someone says “I loveyou,” you react not to those words but to old doubt, insecurity, and negativeexperiences with love. The new gets obliterated by the old.If this is the case, how do we get rid of old conditioning? I often approach theproblem through the concept of “stickiness.” Some old memories are stickier thanothers. They cling to us and we can’t shake them loose. What makes an experiencefrom the past so sticky? If we can break it down, perhaps each aspect will beeasier to deal with one piece at a time. Let’s stay with feeling unlovable.Feeling that you are unlovable usually has the following aspects that make itstick to you:1. SOMEONE IN AUTHORITY, USUALLY A PARENT, TOLD YOU THAT YOU WERE UNLOVABLE.Solution: Realize that this person no longer has authority over you, and you arenot the child you once were. Ask if this person was in fact the one who wasunlovable. Ask if this person could even give love to the most lovable child inthe world. If the information you took to be true is actually highly unreliable,why accept it?2. BEING LOVED WAS SCARY IN THE PAST.Solution: Find safe ways to get over the scariness. One way is to help a needychild. You will find yourself loved in an innocent, grateful way that is verysafe. Examine what the scariest part of being loved is for you. Is it rejection?A sense that the real you will be exposed and found unworthy? Don’t evade thesequestions, but examine them, first alone and then with a confidant you trust.3. LOVE SEEMS FAR AWAY AND LONG AGO.Solution: Get to the bottom of regret. Regret is a two-edged sword. It has akind of nostalgic side, a sweet melancholy that feels protective, but it alsohas a self-defeating side. It tells you that it is never better to have lovedand lost. The experience is painful, and when it turns into an excuse to neverlove again, regret is a mask for fear. Look at your regrets and then renouncethem.4. LOVE IS TIED IN WITH NEGATIVE EMOTIONS.Solution: Realize that emotion is the strongest glue of all. The things we feelstrongest about turn into indelible memories. The way to unstick the memory isto work through the emotion. Bad feelings have to be faced. The trick is not torelive them again. To avoid that may take a good counselor or therapist. Butknow in advance that there’s a big difference between a negative feeling you arehiding and one that is leaving you. Give yourself permission to experience whatletting go really feels like.5. MEMORIES HAVE TURNED INTO BELIEFS.Solution: Stop generalizing. We all turn our worst experiences into rules aboutlife, but such beliefs are false. Just because a schoolyard bully made your lifemiserable at age ten doesn’t mean that the world is out to get you. The worstbreakup in the world doesn’t mean you are unlovable. Look at your most negativebeliefs and untangle them from bad experiences that no longer exist. As youyourself point out, your present life is good; it’s your interpretation of it,based on flawed beliefs, that is undermining you.6. ELECTRIC FENCES CAN’T BE TOUCHED.Solution: When a feeling is so painful that you can’t bear to look at it, itacts like an electric fence. The very prospect of touching it, which is the realsolution to any feeling, becomes a deterrent. You will find that touching thefence is possible, but it has to be worked up to. If you feel shame inside, orif a parent abused you or otherwise betrayed your trust, then love becomes anelectric fence. What should be a joyful feeling has been merged with pain. Thetwo must be untangled before you can touch upon love without hurt. If you knowthat you are suffering in this way, professional help is definitely called for.7. “I HAVE TO BE THIS WAY.”Solution: The voice that tells us that we can’t change is one that countlesspeople believe. They choose inertia, yet think it was forced upon them. Theanswer is to reclaim your freedom of choice. Look at the thing that simplycannot be changed. Sit down and approach this as not your problem, but as onebelonging to a friend. Write this friend a letter containing all the best, mostobjective advice you can devise. Tell your friend that she has a choice tochange, always, and then give specific steps to bring about this change. If youfind that you draw a blank, consult a good book about change and adopt theadvice given there.When you approach old conditioning through these steps, getting free of the pastbecomes viable. It’s never easy to delve deep into oneself, where the oldtraumas and wounds lie in hiding, but if you approach the project rationally andpatiently, it will be possible to bring light and dispel the darkness.Good Works, No RewardI am a smart, educated woman with a successful career in fundraising. I haveraised millions of dollars for elected officials, education organizations, andthe arts. However, I do not have a penny to show for it. I face five years ofunfiled taxes with no savings, and last year I lost my home to foreclosure. Whatis my shadow trying to teach me?—Rachel, 41, Fort Lauderdale, FloridaThank you for such an honest question, and I congratulate you on realizing thatyour shadow—the darkest aspect of the unconscious mind—is trying to tell yousomething. You haven’t fallen back on blaming others or feeling victimized byfate and bad luck. (Of course, all of these ingredients could be circulatinginside at a deeper level.)As you state the case, you are a natural helper. You have been successful atgiving others more well-being while depriving yourself. Why would anyone do sucha thing, since, for most people, charity begins at home? There are severalpossible answers, and I’d like you to examine each one carefully to see if itapplies. • You think self-sacrifice is a form of virtue. • You want your good works to be spontaneously rewarded because they provehow good you are. • You view charity work as a kind of martyrdom, and that appeals to you. • By helping others, you avoided looking at yourself. • You hoped that your good works would solve your own unfaced problems. • You knew you were getting into trouble but didn’t want to face reality. • Some unforeseen things happened that were beyond your control.Depending on which of these statements holds true for you, the message will bedifferent. Yet I can venture a generalization and say that the shadow alwaysdoes the same thing: it keeps you in a fog of illusion. The list I’ve just givenyou is really a list of foggy illusions. The shadow has brought to your doorstepthe very thing you most feared. By not facing it but choosing to remain in afog, you have wound up facing it anyway, and probably in a more desperatecontext. Only when you bring awareness to your situation and face reality willthe healthier, more positive aspects of consciousness come to your aid. Theseexist, I assure you, despite your present bad situation. Everything you can doto make facing reality more desirable, as a way of life, than self-delusion willbe a step in the right direction.WHY AM I HERE? WHAT’S IT ALL ABOUT?Are we born with a spiritual or divine assignment to fulfill on Earth, and if weare, what happens if we don’t fulfill it? What is the difference between aspiritual assignment and a purpose or calling? Can one miss a divine connection,and is that it, or do you get another chance somewhere down the line? Is itnormal for a person to have more than one dream?—Aphrodite, 49, Dallas, TexasYou ask not one question but a twisted tangle, and the thread that runs throughthis tangle is self-doubt. I imagine you find it hard to find a purpose or tofeel engaged. You easily drift away into speculation, and by seeing so manysides to every question, the urgency to do anything evaporates. My basic issue,then, is whether you really want an answer. Are you happier spinning outunanswered questions? Some people are. They prefer fantasy, daydreams, andpassivity to staking a claim to real life.As to the specifics of your question, some spiritual teachers declare that wemake a soul bargain before we enter a new incarnation, and fulfilling thisbargain becomes the focus of our existence. How is such a purpose discovered? Byfollowing your natural inclinations. What is right for you won’t be hidden ifyou are connected to yourself and willing to follow where your desires lead you.But many people find this a hazy and untrustworthy notion. They flirt withhaving a unique purpose, while at the same time maintaining a safe existencebased on conventional norms. No higher power is going to punish you for this. Asoul bargain, if such a concept is valid, is nothing more than an agreement withyourself. Can there be more than one dream? Certainly. The real question to askis if you have disappointed yourself. Does anything else really matter? If youaren’t disappointed, then you are following the right path. If you aredisappointed, you face a choice. You can continue to live with yourdisappointment or you can retrace your steps and pick up your heart’s desirewhere you abandoned it.I know what I would do in such a situation, and I think you do, too.Carrying a Heavy BurdenSeventeen years ago, I gave birth to a beautiful daughter born with birthdefects. I thought that I had moved on and made peace, but I am afraid that Ijust buried my pain. I was preoccupied with raising three young kids and keepingup with the doctor visits, therapists, and household duties. Now it feels thateach missed milestone is unbearable. I used to be resilient, but I just can’tbounce back. I am overweight, my house is a mess, and I can’t seem to claw myway out.— Christa, 44, Syracuse, New YorkThere are solutions to your situation, but you must take them seriously andbegin to act. The basic tenet I have to offer is that happiness is built up bymaking your day happy. You have to think long term about your daughter, but youhave made this an obsession. Situations as tough as the one you describe must bedisentangled here and now. Here are the steps that will make your daysincreasingly happy.Step 1. Clean your house and straighten out the external mess. There’s no reasonto be depressed by having to look at chaos every day. If you feel inclined tobeing miserable, attack a chore. You need to be moving physically in a positiveway.Step 2. Set aside one hour each day to do something that you enjoy a great deal.Don’t skip this hour. Don’t fill it in with eating, cooking, or television. Whatyou want is an inner sense of creative satisfaction.Step 3. Spend at least one hour and preferably two hours every day connectingwith other parents of disabled children. Seek a support group, telephoneconnections, e-mails, and online blogs. Research has shown that personalconnection of this kind is a key factor in becoming happy. I would make room forconnecting with friends and family—that’s also beneficial—but in your case it’skey to get sympathy and support from others who, like you, are walking the walk.Step 4. If therapy is making your daughter worse, pull her out and go elsewhere.A trained therapist can help her. Don’t stop short in this area. Be patient butkeep going.Step 5. Sit down and address your hopelessness. I am not speaking of thepsychological reasons so much as the practical ones. You seem hopeless primarilybecause you feel that your daughter is doomed. That is a negative belief and aprojection, not reality. Nobody can foresee the future. By believing that yourdaughter can have a good future, you will find that opportunities will unfold tobring it about. Before that can happen, however, you need to sit down and writeout the ten things that make you feel hopeless about your daughter, followed bythe realistic steps you can take to avoid those outcomes.You are carrying a burden that doesn’t need to be so obsessive, dark, anddifficult. The key may be to find other parents who have gotten out of theirdark place, and in so doing you will get out of yours. Your old self isn’t dead;it’s just hidden under blankets of sadness and helplessness that you can clearaway.Ask More from LifeI have been searching my whole life for my purpose, only to discover that maybeI don’t have one. I am even more questioning since I’m unemployed after workingmany years with the same company. Does each life have a specific purpose? (Don’tworry; I don’t expect a great revelation in your answer. You are only human.)—Deborah, 61, Pittsburgh, PennsylvaniaI don’t know if this will come as a revelation, but your purpose in life is toquit asking for so little. Working for the same company has dulled yourexcitement and sense of expectation. I’m sure you had those things once, andthey can be revived. The secret is to peek under the blanket. What have youhidden under there? I have in mind all the tiny seeds of dreams and desires thatgot tucked away for a rainy day.Write these words in lipstick on your mirror: “The rainy day has arrived.” Youare at a time in your life where fulfillment counts for everything. With two orthree decades still ahead of you, there’s more than enough time to sprout someof those seeds. I can’t tell you what they are, but I know they exist.CHOOSING BETWEEN RIGHT AND WRONGWho decides something is moral or immoral? What I consider immoral might beperfectly fine with someone else.—Gurpreet, 26, IndiaIt is not hard to see that your question is incomplete. You are facing aparticular moral dilemma. You want to know if your choice is immoral and mightbe condemned by others. Yet you are already guilty enough that you don’t want totell us what the problem really is. Because countless people find themselves insimilar predicaments, let me address how to make moral decisions. I feel thatthis will be more practical than addressing the cosmic question of what makesthings moral (good) or immoral (bad).In a dualistic world, we are told that the play of light and shadow, good andevil, has roots in the eternal. Creation is set up that way, and we are caughtup in the play of opposites. If this explanation, which is essentiallyreligious, has a strong hold upon you, then decisions about right and wrongbecome easier. You can consult the religious system you adhere to, and followits precepts about how to live the life of a good person.On the other hand, you may be caught between desire and conscience. You want todo something, yet you feel guilty or ashamed about what you want. A marriedperson who is tempted to cheat goes through such a struggle. Society says thatthe desire or temptation is bad and should be resisted, while remaining faithfulin marriage is good and should be honored. If you value the judgment of societyand want to be seen as respectable, the right choice is clear. Most of everydaylife consists of balancing desire and conscience—doing the right thing even whenyou don’t completely feel like it. People who live successfully within thesocial system have learned impulse control. My only comment is that choosing tobe respectable is itself a desire, so the choice is not between good and bad.Quite often the choice is between a fleeting impulse and a more mature desire.The condemnation of desire doesn’t make someone moral; it just makes them out oftouch with desire.Finally, I would say that with even more maturity, a person can evolve to thepoint where decisions about right and wrong become less judgmental. You findthat your inner guide can make such choices without fearing social condemnation.You are no longer so attached to rigid rules and dictates. A doctor who mustdecide whether to assist a patient to die, in the interest of relieving the painof a fatal illness, will make that decision based on very personalconsiderations. There is no fixed answer in advance. Society rejects too muchfreedom of choice. It is easy for someone to excuse their own bad actions bysaying, “What is immoral for others is moral for me.” That is self-centeredrationalizing, not higher evolution. Yet higher evolution exists, and theworld’s scriptures tell us that in higher consciousness unity prevails overduality. In other words, instead of condemning evil, a person becomescompassionate toward the wrongdoer and practices forgiveness.I hope these comments are of some help to you.KISSING LESSONSI picked up the morning newspaper and found an article on different types ofkisses. I hid the paper, fearing that my teenage daughter would read it. Did Ido the right thing?—Shipra, 46, Dehradun, IndiaKeep up the good fight. But know this: If keeping unsuitable printed matter awayfrom young people helped them to walk the right path, publishers would go out ofbusiness overnight and the world would still be full of teenagers learning howto kiss. Such is human nature.TAKING CHARGE OF YOUR LIFE?Every day I wake up and promise myself that I’m going to live each day to thefullest and not let my emotions or fears hold me back. I’m going to do thatthing that I’ve been putting off, talk about that issue that has been eatingaway at me with someone, but after bathing and having my breakfast, I lose mynerve. How do I take charge of my life? How do I stop letting fear get the bestof me?—Marissa, 19, Botswana, South AfricaWhen you say “take charge,” you are actually defining the obstacle, not thesolution. You are setting up the situation so that it takes effort, will, andfortitude to face life’s challenges. As long as you confront a dauntingobstacle, quite naturally you will take the course of least resistance. The samesetup causes millions of people to overeat, for example, because the alternativeis too much effort and trouble. Let’s put it off until tomorrow. Meanwhile, passthe chocolate cake.The solution is to keep making it easier to overcome your resistance. If youcould face life’s challenges, including your fears, with enthusiasm and energy,that would be ideal. You can’t achieve the ideal overnight, but you don’t haveto. Taking positive steps every day is good enough—better than good enough,really, since most of the resistance we encounter inside comes down to old,outworn habits and inertia. Getting past them is more than half the battle. Hereare the steps I have in mind.Step 1. Look at your procrastination. This is an ingrained habit, but why do youcling to it? Because putting off unpleasant things offers itself as a kind of“solution.” It’s a feeble solution, on the order of “out of sight, out of mind.”But the things we put off aren’t really out of our minds. Just below the surfacethey nag at us and make it impossible to be carefree. Sit down and absorb thisconcept: procrastination is a false friend. Recall all the times in the pastwhen you faced up to a problem and felt good about yourself. Realize thatprocrastination never feels good. It is based on wishful thinking, that somehowa problem will solve itself. Believe me, any outcome is better than waiting,because the longer you wait, the more your mind will invent worst-casescenarios.Step 2. Make a list for how to have a good day. First thing in the morning,write down what you are going to eat, the errands you are going to run, thebills you are going to pay. Don’t extend this list beyond one day. Include on itat least one thing you want to accomplish that you have been putting off. As youwrite, check in on your comfort level. Everything on your list should lead tothe same result: you will feel good today.Step 3. Carry out your list, and as you accomplish each thing, check it off. Atthat moment, see how you feel. If you wind up feeling tired or bored or anythingnegative, revise your list. The whole point of the list is to build yourself anew comfort zone, one based on fulfillment and accomplishment. These things canonly come about when your life is manageable. Nobody is happy when their day isoverwhelming and exhausting. When you get into the grip of procrastination, allthe things left undone build up until they truly are overwhelming, yet you can’tbreak out of this vicious circle until you begin to act. Once you learn that youcan face a few challenges while still feeling good—in fact, facing them makesyou feel even better—then that little voice inside that says, “Put it off; onemore day won’t hurt anybody,” will begin to lose its power to persuade you.SPIRITUALLY STUCKI have been on a spiritual journey for twenty years and have studied manydifferent approaches. I work at encouraging others to trust in the process, butright now I’m in a financial situation of lack and limitation. I know that thereis a spiritual lesson here about trust. But I seem to be stuck and cannot breakthrough.—Bernice, 63, Raleigh-Durham, North CarolinaTo begin with, this isn’t a case of now or never. By putting pressure onyourself, you are closing off the channels of help and support. I am not beingmystical here. Spirituality is about consciousness, and whatever expandsconsciousness serves to open up subtler realms of experience. At the same time,whatever closes down your awareness and contracts it with fear cannot beconsidered spiritual. In other words, I detect that you would like to love andtrust, yet at the same time a powerful instinct leads you to be anxious andapprehensive. This is the two-way glass you describe in your letter.If I may, let me talk about “spiritual materialism,” because I think it appliesto many of us. When we ask God or Spirit to bring us money—usually disguised inthe more polite term, abundance—then spirituality descends to the level ofgetting and spending. From the ego level springs all the insecurity that makesus want to protect ourselves with money, status, possessions, and variousworldly things. Certainly providing for yourself is important. It’s not that Godgives more if you live up to certain standards and gives less if you don’t.There is no all-seeing judge above the clouds, keeping tabs on who is naughtyand nice. To think in those terms is spiritual materialism.Why do so many people fall into such thinking? The reasons are not hard to find.We live in a material society, and in America it’s particularly harsh becausethere are few if any safety nets. The hidden side of prosperity and success isthe fear that if you fall, nobody will catch you. Moreover, we have been filledwith simplistic promises about God saving the poor and weak, like an all-purposerescue mission. And even though countless prayers go unanswered, people cling towishful thinking. Told as children that God is looking out for them, they see noalternative but to cling to those beliefs.That is why, in the end, spirituality is a path that every person must walk. Thepath only leads inward. It doesn’t lead to a teller’s window where you exchangelack for abundance. I know that I’m throwing a splash of cold water, but whenyou stop believing in illusions, there’s space for reality. The reality is fargreater than money or anything material. As you walk the path, you discover yourtrue self, and as that discovery deepens, peace and security become permanentaspects of yourself. Fear has been disguising your true self. Ego has beenenticing you to measure your progress by externals.Yet what really matters is a process that allows you to switch your allegianceaway from spiritual materialism while finding a new allegiance in being awake.With expanded awareness you find that life has more to offer than you ever knewabout. I can’t predict whether anyone will become rich or poor. But you areright to trust in the process of life, so long as that doesn’t turn intofatalism. There is a right and good place for you in this world; it opens to youwhen your awareness is open enough to perceive it.A DOMINEERING MOTHERI am my mother’s only child and had to move her in with me when she becameseriously ill six years ago. She is much better now, fortunately, but stillhere. Mom has always been negative toward me when it comes to my choices inlife. We have never had an adult mother-daughter relationship built on respect.I used to stand up to her bullying, but nothing ever changed. Now I’vesurrendered to keep peace. She may have loved me as a child, but I don’t thinkMom loves me as an adult. What can I do?—Terry, 40, Charleston, South CarolinaDon’t feel alone with this problem; many grown daughters are walking in yourshoes. You have two problems to solve, actually, not one, and the beginning of asolution is to untangle them: Problem No. 1: psychological dependence on your mother Problem No. 2: your mother’s narcissism and self-centerednessThese two issues are entangled, which makes them more difficult to deal with,but the second is the easiest. Your mother is selfish and self-centered. Insofaras she cares about you, it’s only as a reflection of herself. The first thingshe thinks about is “How does this situation make me look?” If you choose a man,a job, or a pair of shoes, she doesn’t care how it affects you. She cares abouther own image and egotistical sense of self.You cannot solve this issue, because it’s not yours to solve. As long as youkeep giving in to your mother, she has “solved” her narcissism by keeping itunder wraps and denying that it’s a problem. If she were the slightest bitunselfish, she would see the bad effect she is having; she would empathize withyour feelings. She would thank you for nursing her and quickly move on. She doesnone of these things. Therefore, you really don’t have to consider her feelingswhen it comes to repairing your own life.The first problem, your dependency—or, to use modern jargon, codependency—ismore difficult. It’s one thing to be a fly caught in the web struggling to breakfree. It’s quite another if you’re a dog or cat who claims to be caught in aweb. They can easily break free if they want to. So the big question is, whydon’t you want to be free of your mother, given that a real desire to be freewould immediately lead to action? When you have a rock in your shoe, you don’tput up with it unless you happen either to like pain or want to suffer as amartyr.Dependency is rooted in a child’s need for love. A healthy child grows out ofdependency and realizes that “I am lovable.” A dependent child remains attachedand says, “I am only lovable if Mommy gives me love. Otherwise, I am not.” Untilthis root cause is resolved, dependency will spread to other areas. Approval,success, the feeling of being safe, personal accomplishment, and so on, becomebased upon what others say about you, rather than securely grounded in knowledgeof your own self-worth.I think it would help you to read about codependency. Once you feel that you seeyourself realistically, find a group that deals in codependency issues. You willneed help extricating yourself. Your mother is a powerful personality. She knowshow to keep her hooks in you. Remember, when you break free, you will be able tolove her more honestly. That is better than feeling trapped and pretending tolove your tormentor.PARENTING AN ADDICTHow am I to emotionally deal with having an adult son who is drug dependent?When he is using or his life is in chaos, I don’t know how to keep his situationfrom occupying my mind 24/7—there’s a feeling of doom surrounding me. Can I dealwith this from a spiritual standpoint? How does a parent let go of the pain andanxiety I feel?—Bernadette, 61, MilwaukeeIt would take days to go into detail about parent-child relationships, but youare asking about an issue we can isolate: the guilt, anxiety, and frustration ofnot being able to help. In spiritual terms, this is about attachment. Youidentify with someone who is separate from yourself. You all but lose theboundary between yourself and your son. Attachment makes you obsess over yourson’s chaotic life. It makes his pain feel like yours.Please see that I am not criticizing the loving empathy that connects a motherand son. You can get beyond crippling attachment through a process that involvesthe following steps:1. See that attachment isn’t positive. It helps no one. The most effectivetherapists tend to be unattached, even detached. It gives them clarity andobjectivity. It allows their skills to be used most effectively.2. See that your attachment is harming you. As close as you feel toward yourchildren, the life that is closest to you is your own. Sacrificing a good partof it to suffering is destructive. You must value yourself enough to want a goodlife for yourself. From this goodness you will offer more help to those in need,not less.3. Reject false hope, wishful thinking, and the constant recurrence of“solutions” that never work and that your children reject anyway. If they sayno, be an adult and accept that no means no.4. Heal your wounds. Most addicts have lost the ability to care about thosearound them. They are in the habit of hurting, rejecting, betraying, keepingsecrets, and breaking faith. The disease works that way. But all that negativebehavior has hurt you. Don’t let parental guilt turn you into a punching bag ora rug to trample over. Heal yourself where you hurt.5. Fulfill your primary relationship. You don’t mention your husband, but if youare still married, repair your bridges with him. This is not a path to walkalone. Realize that your children are not your primary relationship. If they areall you have, that still doesn’t make them your primary relationship, becausethey aren’t relating to you at all. Find someone to relate to who cares for you.They certainly don’t.6. Find a vision to follow. Right now, your vision is an illusion. It is fixedon the false notion that if you found just the right key, you would solve yourchildren’s lives. Please see that no parent solves any grown child’s life, whichmeans you haven’t failed. It’s impossible to fail at what was unachievable tobegin with. The mind abhors a vacuum, and you need a purposeful goal in life tofill the place where anxiety and guilt now reside.If you seriously undertake these steps, you will go a long way toward reclaimingyour own life from the self-destructive tendencies that have set in from beingpart of an addict’s life. It’s never too late to find yourself.IS BEING GAY THE ISSUE?Since I was six I somehow knew I was different inside. I’m twenty-one now andrecognize that “it” is part of me. By “it” I mean having a queer interest inmembers of the same sex (I was brought up as a Christian, so you can imagine myturmoil inside). Sadly, I have been struggling to kill this part of me since Iwas a kid. My world was shaken when I realized that it wasn’t going away.Now I’m sure that I was genetically programmed to think and feel the way I do. Ihad my first bout of depression seven years ago. Currently I’m on medication toprevent its return. What direction should I be going in? Honestly, I detestmyself for being “queer.”—Luke, 21, SingaporeThe pressing problem here isn’t sexual orientation but judgment against theself. Instead of being gay, let’s say you were bald. Most men are self-consciousabout being bald, and it can serve as a focus for loss of self-esteem and asense of not being masculine enough. They resent the condition and feel cheatedcompared to others. I hope you see that it isn’t baldness that’s causing suchself-judgment, which can become quite obsessive and overpowering.Being gay is more difficult to come to terms with than baldness, of course,because of society’s attitudes. You don’t actively detest yourself—you havepassively absorbed other people’s negative attitudes. Religion is part ofsociety, and when it enters the situation, one winds up with yet another layerof disapproval, perhaps the most severe of all, since to be gay, according toChristian fundamentalists, is to put your soul in jeopardy. In your position, Iwould list the problems you feel inside, putting them in order of severity andthen writing down a specific remedy for each. For example:1. FEELING LONELY AND DIFFERENTRemedy: Meet other gay people who have good self-esteem, join a gay social club,make one good gay friend, and make one good straight friend who is fine withhomosexuality.2. SELF-JUDGMENT AND INSECURITYRemedy: Find one thing you are good at, join with people who value youraccomplishments, find a confidant to share your feelings with, and make friendswith somebody who can serve as a model or mentor.3. RELIGIOUS GUILTRemedy: Read a book on modern faith and gay tolerance, find a gay friend who isalso Christian, and seek out a gay pastor.4. SEXUAL DISSATISFACTIONRemedy: Join a gay group that is about something besides sex (hiking, movies,dancing, hobbies), read about heroes and pioneers of gay liberation, identifywith strong role models who have successfully combined sex and love.There are many more issues I could have included, but the point is first to getyou out of yourself so that you can form less self-destructive beliefs aboutbeing gay, and, second, to use those outside contacts to build up your sense ofself. You are a unique person with unique value in this world. It doesn’t matterwhether genes, upbringing, predisposition, or early behavior contributed to yourhaving a gay identity. This is your main life challenge, here and now. A lotdepends on confronting the challenge head-on with a positive outcome in mind. Ihave faith that you can.A DEPRESSED SPOUSEMy husband becomes depressed every year, and the episode typically lasts twomonths. The trigger that makes the depression pop up is usually a familygathering or a party with friends. He always compares himself unfavorably witheverybody else. (In general he has low self-esteem.) I love my husband dearly,but he also starts drinking when he is depressed. Even though friends advise meto walk out, I can’t bear the thought of him struggling alone. The hardest partis that when he feels good again, he refuses to go to therapy, read books, ormeditate. But I know that there is always a next depression, and a next, and anext. What should I do?—Lisa, 38, AmsterdamYour situation is very common among those who must live with cyclicaldepression. We tend to think of bipolar depression swinging rapidly betweenblack despair and manic elation. But there are other kinds of cycles, such asthe one your husband is experiencing—and taking you with him.In cyclical depression it is also common for sufferers to say, “I’m fine,there’s nothing wrong,” when they enter the up part of the cycle. They want tohear nothing about treatment or prevention. When they sink into the down part ofthe cycle, many tend to self-medicate with alcohol. I’m not mentioning this tomake you feel that your difficulties are any the less for fitting a pattern. Aregular MD and perhaps even a psychiatrist may not be enough. They tend toregard this condition as so hard to treat therapeutically that the only remedythey offer is antidepressants (which, sadly, the patient almost always throwsaway as soon as he feels good again).Let’s turn to the only aspect of this situation that you have any control over,which is your own participation. Let go of any illusion that you are “helping”the depressed person in your life. You are maintaining the status quo. Thereforeit is up to you to ask the essential questions: 1. Is this something I can fix? 2. Is this something I must put up with? 3. Is this something I have to walk away from?Because of your love and loyalty to your husband, I sense that you rely onnumber 2, and that reliance has made you codependent with his depression. I amnot saying you are his enabler. Rather, you have adapted to his needs, andadaptation can only go so far. That is why you dread the next occurrence andfeel more drained by each one. It’s time for him to adapt to your needs, too.Instead of pleading for him to get help when he doesn’t want to, start assertingwhat you actually want and need. Leave depression out of it as much as you can.What if he had a debilitating chronic illness instead? It would be reasonable tosay one of the following things: • I can’t handle it all by myself. • My well-being is also important. • I am deeply sympathetic, but I can’t be your constant lifeline. You mustlook out for yourself, too. • I want to relate to the part of you that isn’t sick. Please help me. • I can’t take all this denial. We have a problem in common. • Once we talk through the problem and begin to be honest about it, as acouple we need to work together toward a solution. In that solution, both of usmust find relief.I hope you will begin to see that you have adapted too far for your own good. Idon’t join your friends in saying that you should walk out (although I hope youcan find time for yourself apart from this problem; your friends are right thatyou deserve a life). I want you to reclaim your life with your husband, notwithout him. There has to be a balance, and right now the balance seems to befavoring him and his way of life too much.A DHARMA BUM?My problem is an eighteen-year-old son who doesn’t think that he needs to workor go to school. He says he just wants “to be” and that “the less you do, themore you get done.” How can my husband and I inspire our son to realize that hemust do something in order to survive while at the same time not going againsthis spiritual ideals?—Kathy, 39, Des Moines, IowaI’m afraid that your dilemma is going to bring a lot of rueful smiles toreaders. What you’re asking about is a spoiled child who has his parents wrappedaround his little finger. At eighteen, young people are trying on new identitiesand throwing them off again. Only time and maturity will tell us what kind ofadult your son will turn into, and what he will do with his life.You are at a delicate crux, also, because you can’t keep coddling him like achild, yet you can’t place adult expectations on your son, either. Try moving inthat direction, however. I know it’s difficult. In this family the idealisticones are the parents. The child is doing everything he can to remain asdependent as possible. At the very least, you need to inform him about the factsof life: go to school or support yourself. The alternative is to keep treadingwater with nobody being the happier for it.OVERPOPULATION OF SOULSI’ve always wondered how souls multiply. If, in fact, we are reincarnated, wheredo new souls come from and how did there get to be six billion of them on thisplanet?—Sally, 32, Silver Spring, MarylandYou’d be surprised how often this question comes up, usually in the spirit of“gotcha.” Skeptics say, “There are twice as many people in the world as fiftyyears ago. If all have a soul, and souls are immortal, there can’t be more soulsthan previously. Therefore, reincarnation must be wrong.” I notice that you areasking in a friendlier spirit, so here are my candid thoughts.First, reincarnation isn’t being tested by this question. For all we know, soulsmay be released in some kind of order that human beings cannot fathom. Maybethere’s an endless supply in an infinite Pez dispenser. The rhythm of soul birthisn’t our concern. All we know is that each of us is here, doing the best we canto evolve.Second, the ego is used to thinking in terms of “I,” or the separate self. Butlet’s set aside the ego for a moment. Your soul is your deepest consciousness,the source of your awareness. To me, consciousness is a singular that has noplural. One piece of gold can be made into many gold ornaments, one fire makesmany flames, one ocean many waves. Souls are patterns of movement and behaviorin a single consciousness. Whether we call it the mind of God or the womb ofcreation, this single source can give rise to as many souls as the universecalls forth, just as the ocean can have a few waves or many without depletingitself. To be fully conscious is a twofold state. You see yourself as anindividual, but you also belong to the unity known as mind.RECESSION BLUESThis was the year the roof fell in. Within a matter of months my husband and Iseparated. We declared bankruptcy and lost our business, a winery anddistillery. Now I try to cope as a single parent living in a house that is aboutto be foreclosed on. I’m about to turn fifty, and there are moments when I feelcompletely lost. Mostly, however, I try to be optimistic and believe that my newjourney will be an opportunity to find my life’s true purpose. I want nothingmore than to provide a secure and happy future for my children. People like meand respond to my positive energy. Surely there’s an open door for me. Myquestion is, how do I keep that door open?—Sara, 49, British ColumbiaI can assure you that your letter has sent a shudder through many hearts. In thecurrent recession, older workers who thought that they were nearing thefulfillment of their careers find instead that the bottom has dropped out. Theyare poorly prepared for the loss of job or home or savings—all the safety netswe provide for ourselves in a working lifetime.To open a new door, I think we must fall back on the adage about Natureabhorring a vacuum. Right now you have a space inside that contains thefollowing: regret, disappointment, nostalgia for better times, hope for thefuture, anxiety over the future, self-esteem, and self-doubts. In other words,there’s a disorganized tangle of conflicts. Shadow energies are coming up tomake you feel afraid. The instability of your outer life is mirrored by innerinstability as well.You need to create space for clarity, inspiration, and new beginnings. Youalready possess the life skills for all of that. The problem is that so much isswirling around inside that no clarity is possible, or it only comes by fits andstarts. Realize that you are in crisis mode. You cannot ask everything ofyourself. Where are outside helpers, support, and most of all, where is yourhusband? I know he has his own anxieties, but he was part of the collapse thatled to this crisis. He should be part of the path that leads out of it. Askingyou to bear the burden alone is inexcusable.I’m afraid that you also need to be tough-minded right now. Go to those youhelped in the past and make it known, in no uncertain terms, that you needsupport during this crisis. Don’t be brave; don’t be a martyr; don’t fall intovictimization and the wishful thinking that comes packed with it. Look atyourself as if you were another person—someone you know well who needs sound,rational advice. What would you tell her? Being objective helps to clear out theconfused swirl of emotions that tug one way and another day after day.You have a good sense of your core self; that comes through clearly when youwrite. It’s the core self that gets people through crises. Externals comesecond. Yes, the recession and the blows it has delivered to the lives of good,well-deserving people are real. But inner resilience and the ability to bounceback are personal qualities, and they prove decisive in cases like yours. Alignyourself with someone who has this kind of resilience so that your own can bestrengthened. Find another oak to weather the storm with you. Anyone who is intouch with his or her core self will always respond. Before you worry aboutstaying positive, take steps, however small, to get out of crisis mode. Once youorient yourself realistically in that direction, the doors that need to openwill begin to do so.CAN I BECOME ENLIGHTENED?Is it man’s purpose to seek and reach enlightenment? What are the obstacles togetting there, and how does one overcome them? I preach positive thinking toeveryone around me, but sometimes I find myself feeling hopeless. I can’t getout of this rut. Please help.—Claudine, 41, Sherman Oaks, CaliforniaYou have asked two questions, but let me see if we can link them. Positivethinking is very good, even necessary, in order to have a hopeful vision oflife. Your vision is of enlightenment, and nothing could be more positive.Having found your vision, however, you don’t have to force yourself to thinkpositively all the time. That is an artificial way to approach the mind. I findthat if you don’t force your mind, it works more naturally and with less stress.Now, having set your goal at enlightenment, how do you get there? First, let’snot think in terms of obstacles. Enlightenment is the product of personalgrowth. When a rose is growing in your garden, aiming for the day it will giveforth a glorious blossom, it doesn’t think, “What are the obstacles to overcomebefore I can flower?” It simply grows, taking the good and the bad as they come,with the assurance that one day the flower will appear.Yet roses bloom best with rich soil, lots of nourishment, and tender care. Thesame holds true for you. Only two things are needed on the spiritual path: avision of the goal, and the means to expand your awareness. Whateverenlightenment may be—and many traditions describe it differently—every steptoward enlightenment is a step of self-awareness. Throughout history, spiritualtraditions point to meditation as the single most important tool forself-awareness. As you become more aware, however, not everything that revealsitself is positive. Life is a mixed blessing, and everyone has a shadow self.But no matter how difficult some aspect of your life may be, it need not serveas an obstacle to spirit. Your body may face obstacles, and so may your psyche.Deal with these the best way you can find; in other words, lead a normal lifewith support from family, friends, and others who are spiritually minded. Butspirit is about awareness, and as long as you know that, the opportunity forexpanded consciousness will always appear. Sometimes it appears in meditation,sometimes as a new insight, at other times as guides and teachers who appear tohelp us. Let your higher self be the ultimate guide and keep firm in knowingthat the whole path takes place in consciousness.HER UNRULY SONMy twenty-two-year-old son lives at home, going to college part time and workingpart time. He never volunteers to help out with chores, to cook a meal, or washthe dishes. He comes and goes in a surly mood, without saying hello or good-bye.Toward me he takes a superior attitude, as if he’s in charge. Yet he sits aroundplaying video games every spare moment. I’m divorced and a single mom. How can Iget my son to be kinder to me? Frankly, if he just pretended, that would be goodenough at this point.—Audrey, 46, Oak Park, IllinoisYour son is extending his adolescence as far as he can stretch it. The attitudesyou describe—including the superior air, the addiction to video games, avoidanceof chores, and disregard for you—are well known to every parent of asixteen-year-old. They are pretty inexcusable in a twenty-two-year-old, however.In addition, your situation is compounded by two aggravating factors. Your sonlearned his callous attitude from his father, I’m afraid. And you areexperiencing the downside of being a single mom, which is that you have becometoo dependent on your son for emotional feedback and too ready to let him lingerin immaturity.What this comes down to is that you are no good for him and he is no good foryou. This is a mutually unbeneficial relationship. As the adult, it’s up to youto face reality as it applies to you. Get a life outside your son. Forceyourself to let him grow up. Stop paying so much attention to him; stopburdening him with your disappointments and failed expectations. I know this isa strong dose of medicine, but it will heal you in the end.As for your son, your worry is well placed. He isn’t in a good position to growup. He has little motivation to do so, and he’s too immature to see the downfallthat awaits him if he refuses to grow up. Your role is to help open his eyes.First, he needs a strong talk from a man he respects. This man needs to deliversome hard truths. Second, he needs a role model who fits the kind of person heshould be growing into.I can’t tell you what kind of role model is exactly right. This will take someclear-headed thinking on your part. At twenty-two, many young adults can’tidentify their strengths and weaknesses. They need more experience, perhaps somementoring. No doubt that’s true of your son. But find a man whose career andlife choices will make your son say, “I want to be like that. I can be likethat.” Without such a figure in his life—or in the life of any young adult—theprospect for the future is more aimless drifting.YOUTH AT A CROSSROADSI am having a really hard time with choices when it comes to finding a directionin life. I want to do something I love and am passionate about, but I haven’tfigured out what that is yet. In the meantime I’m not willing to compromise myideals just to be practical. School and work felt meaningless to me, so Idropped out and spent a year not going out, basically just reading books onspirituality and psychology in hopes that I could find myself.Now I feel more grounded spiritually, but in my practical life I haven’taccomplished anything. I want to trust that everything is as it should be. Evenso, there are times when I feel dead inside. I have no aspirations; I don’t evenknow why I’m here.—Annie, 24, New Haven, ConnecticutYour letter gets more and more negative as it goes on, culminating in a starlingstatement: I feel dead inside. So what started out as one thing—a letter from anidealistic young person who has postponed her identity crisis—winds up soundinglike a letter from someone who is acutely depressed. Therefore, the only way youcan get an answer is to go inside and find it. You’ve read a lot of spiritualbooks. The seed is sown. Now it’s time to let some seeds sprout.To find out which ones, here are five questions to ask yourself. Write them downand keep the paper available, because you will need to ask each question everyday until it is answered. I’ll list the questions first and then tell you aspecial way to answer them, because the method is as important as the answers:1. Am I depressed and sick of my life?2. Am I drifting because I know something perfect is waiting just over thehorizon?3. Is today going the way I want it to?4. When I look around, does my life tell me who I am? What do I see in thereflection of the outer world?5. If I could jump ahead five years and meet myself, who would I meet?These are questions that get asked during the identity crisis of one’s earlytwenties. They are always asked in confusion, because late adolescence isn’tquite over and fully fledged adulthood has not quite begun. People experiencetheir identity crises in very different ways. They tend to bring out what wemost fear and what we most dream of. This is a time for love, ideals, a career,growing confidence, and the excitement of taking flight.That’s the ideal, but of course many people experience other elements of theidentity crisis: a paralyzing sense of indecision, loss of self-confidence,panic that old behaviors that worked in your teens no longer work, and afrightening sense of emptiness. Right now you are mired in the negative side offinding your true identity. So let’s eliminate the negative and let the positivepart of your life start to guide you.That’s where the five questions come in. Pull out your list in the morning. Readeach question, then close your eyes and wait for an answer. Don’t force; don’texpect anything. If you hear a lot of chatter in your mind, exhale and mentallyask this chatter to stop for a moment so you can have a clear mind. Whateveranswer you receive after a few minutes, that’s today’s answer. Move on to thenext question. Once you have your five answers, go on and enjoy your day. Don’tthink about the questions again. Don’t return to them. You have done your jobfor the day. The rest is for enjoyment.Repeat this procedure every day. One day—no one can predict when—one of theanswers will seem totally right to you. This means that your true self hasdelivered the answer. Don’t jump for joy just yet. Come back two more times andsee if the same answer returns. If so, cross that question off your list.Proceed for as long as it takes until you have five good and true answers. Whathave you done? You’ve caught up with where you need to be. Because you areyoung, your answers may change next year, but what you want is answers for rightnow. They will serve to get you out of your rut.A HOPELESS SEARCHI am constantly in search of “something” and have wound up exhausted, lost, andsad. I thought surviving cancer would keep me on track and living simply. It didfor a while, but now I am back searching and hoping again. I pray and talk toGod, angels, and guides, but I think I am making it all up or just fantasizing.Where do I go from here? I know there is more, but what? Where?—Janet, 60, Sacramento, CaliforniaPerhaps we should begin with your age. At sixty it’s only natural to wantvalidation in your life. You should be able to look inside and find a set ofcore values by which to live. Whatever that something is that wants to unfold,it does so on the basis of the core self that you have established.In your case core seems weak or absent, which means one of two things: eitheryou have postponed the work of establishing a stable, meaningful self or thatself was weakened by trauma, hurt, and disappointment. I can’t tell you which istrue—perhaps there’s an element of both. In any event, the way forward is thesame. The “more” that you are seeking is you. It isn’t a revelation delivered byangels or an epiphany from God.I don’t mean to imply that you shouldn’t seek a connection with the sacred. Butif you spent years trying to chop down a tree with a butter knife, wouldn’t yourealize that you haven’t gone about it the right way? In your case, the reasonthat inspiration from many sources hasn’t stuck is that you haven’t beenrealistic about what it means to be on the spiritual path. Beyond anything else,it’s the path to reality. So you must become realistic about your life and beginto do the work of finding yourself. The reality you seek is as close asbreathing. There’s no need to search for it in the sky or the wind.THE OUTSIDERI was born with physical defects, and over my life I’ve had thirty-sixsurgeries. When I was small, I didn’t really know there was anything wrong withme. Once I went to elementary school, however, things became very difficult. Thethings the other kids said were awful—“Scarface, Frankenstein, you’ll only havea boyfriend if he puts a sack over your head.” My mom was oblivious to myissues. My stepfather sat me on his lap and said, “You’ll never be beautiful, sobe smart instead.” The trouble is, even though I did well in school, he stillcalled me stupid.I know that I am smart, caring, and a really kind and loving person. But when Iwalk into a room, I see people staring and doing double takes. Telling them whyI look this way only confirms how ashamed I already feel about myself—it’s acatch-22. How do I win? I have been in therapy, and still I cannot let this go.—Leonie, 39, Baltimore, MarylandYour issues, painful as they are, can be treated. If your therapist hasn’t madeheadway, you need to talk to someone who can. The essential problem is that youare carrying into adulthood strong beliefs imprinted by your parents. Yourmother was unable to overcome her guilt at having an imperfect child, and yourstepfather fortified her feelings instead of helping to resolve them. Before youhad a self, when you were so little that you had no choice but to attach youridentity to your mother, you were conditioned in totally the wrong way.I congratulate you for winning your life back. Through adversity you became abetter person than all your tormentors from the past, including those who raisedyou. On the basis of your own strength, your healing depends on reaching thefollowing realizations: • It wasn’t your job to make your mother happy. • It wasn’t your fault that she couldn’t forgive herself. • You didn’t fail as a child, because there was no way you could have won.Your parents simply were who they were. • You need a new set of parents, and they exist within you. These parentsconsist of your own sense of worthiness. • There is a way to let go of past pain. • It’s safe to be different. You don’t have to keep defending your right toexist.Unless you find a therapist who explicitly works on these core issues, there’sno point in going back. At the same time, please write down these points andbegin to work on yourself. Healing is always within reach. You have gone a longway. Now you’ve reached the nitty-gritty. It may be harder to heal, yet the taskhas been accomplished many times, and once you find the right guidance, you willaccomplish it, too.MY BAD BOSSEight months ago I resigned from my job because my boss was a bully anddisrespectful of me. When I brought this up to her superiors, they did nothingto correct the situation. Now she has given me a bad reference to prospectivenew employers. I can’t seem to get away from her. How do I move on?—Celine, 58, Minneapolis, MinnesotaThere’s a short-term answer to your dilemma, and a long-term answer as well. Theshort-term answer is to explain the friction to prospective employers quiteopenly in your job interview. Be forthcoming and adult, without blaming your oldboss or making excuses—employers will pick up on your honesty. Offer to giveother references from your old job if you want, but I think no one will miss whoyou are just because of a nasty reference.The long-term answer requires some inner work on yourself. I sense that you feelwronged and hurt, but also offended and perhaps guilty, as if you had provokedher bad behavior or failed to make it get better. These feelings are the stringstying you to this old boss. You need to talk about them with a mature person whowill understand and compassionately guide you. No good will come if you stew inyour own juices and keep reliving the past, trying to make yourself feel better.You have real wounds inside, even if they are invisible. Take steps to find away to heal them. I hope this helps.LONGING TO HAVE ANOTHER BABYMy husband and I have a beautiful girl who just turned four. I want anotherchild, but my husband doesn’t. We have been fighting a lot, and now he is havingtrouble performing in the bedroom. To me, this is just another way to avoid whatI want so badly. I can’t believe he is not feeling what I am.—Marianne, 36, Denver, ColoradoYou need to take the pressure off your husband and yourself. The stress ismaking him limp. May I suggest a modified time-out? Sit down and write a letterto him listing all your reasons for wanting a new baby and expressing yourselfas fully as you can. Ask him to write you a letter expressing his reasons fornot wanting another child, expressing all his doubts.After you each read the other’s letter, in private, put them away for fourmonths. Don’t bring up the subject again. Let time do its work. At the end offour months, take out the letters again. Read only yours, and ask yourself ifyour position has changed. Your husband should do the same. If neither of youhas changed, put the letters away again for four months. But if, as I suspect,there is a softening of either position, talk it over. If there is still noagreement, write new letters. I think this will work if you really promise toleave the subject alone in the interim.FAMILY FEUDMy grown-up son and my husband had a heated argument over Christmas, and eventhough my husband has apologized and asked for a second chance, my son and hisfiancée refuse to have anything to do with either of us. My son blames us foreverything bad in his life. We are devastated, but he is controlling thesituation. We had a good family until this happened.—Carlene, 56, New HampshireCan a good family be torn apart by a single argument, however bitter? There ishidden resentment here, and it’s been hiding for a while. Your son’s feelingsare totally justified as he views them, and totally unjustified as you and yourhusband view them. You have arrived at an impasse. When that happens, the bestthing to do is back away. Having a third party, his fiancée, in between onlyhardens the distance between you.Since you are fifty-six, I assume your son is a full-fledged adult. He may notbe acting like one. The chances are that he is being emotionally immature—hispetulance sounds adolescent as you describe it. Yet, as you say, he controls thesituation. He is faced with that age-old question, “Can you ever go home again?”The answer is yes, but there’s a catch. You can go home again after you havemade peace with your past. I wish I had better news for you, but your son isn’tat peace. He isn’t reaching out to you for advice or healing. I wish he would.But for now, let him have his distance. Put no pressure on him of any sort. Bepolite and kind on the phone if he calls. Eventually he will remember the goodthings about you and his father. When that happens, it will be up to him to makethe first gesture of reconciliation.ENLIGHTENED OR HAPPY?Are enlightenment and happiness the same thing?—Dee, 52, BostonThe simplicity and directness of your question are refreshing. But I’m being puton the spot a bit by not knowing why you ask this question. If you feel thatenlightenment is a good way to be happy, such hopes are probably an illusion.Enlightenment means the awakening to full consciousness, a state where theconcerns of the ego no longer exist. That is a faraway state by any measure.But to get to enlightenment, a person must walk the spiritual path, and indeedsuch a journey does increase one’s happiness. That’s because of where the pathleads, which is closer and closer to your true self. The true self lies at thecore of the self you call “me.” But it isn’t overshadowed by the everyday upsand downs of life. Your true self has no agenda. It is content simply to be. Inbeing, there is a quality of bliss that is innocent and simple. We allexperience it in moments when we are in a state of peaceful enjoyment—it’s likegazing at the blue sky on a spring day without the slightest troubling thoughtinside.Not every sky will be blue and not every day is springtime. So on the spiritualpath a person learns to find this kind of happiness without needing nice thingsto happen on the outside. Rather, you find happiness by being who you reallyare. This isn’t mystical. Young children are happy being who they are. The trickis to regain such a state when you are grown and have seen the light and darksides of life. I encourage you to try the path for yourself. For guidance, I’vewritten a recent book, The Ultimate Happiness Prescription, which talks aboutthe path to happiness in detail.WHEN IS IT CHEATING?I have been married or living with the same man for six years and together weare raising three teenage children. My husband cheated on me prior to ourwedding with the mother of his youngest child. Because this woman is the motherof his child, she is still a part of our lives. I recently found out that myhusband has been calling her in secret. His excuse is that he isn’t cheating andthat I need to get over it. But I feel betrayed. Should I leave him? Do I have aright to feel this way? I’m confused.— Sherry, 35, Los AngelesAlmost anyone would share your response. Cheating is more than an action, it’san attitude. To stop cheating requires the man (let’s assume we are talkingabout cheating husbands for the moment) to change his attitudes first. Only thendoes changing his behavior really mean anything. If only the behavior changes,the result will be superficial. His wife will always be nervous and insecureabout a relapse, as you are right now.I don’t insist that “once a cheater, always a cheater,” but that saying was bornout of bitter experience. Here are the ingredients that go into a cheater’spsyche: • The more women I have, the sexier I feel. • Men aren’t designed to be monogamous. • Sleeping with other women gives me breathing room in my marriage. It’slike a vacation. • The other women don’t mean anything. I don’t see why my wife is so upset. • A real man can satisfy more than one woman. • I do whatever I can get away with. • I have a right to be myself, and this is who I am. • It’s easier to run to another woman than to face problems with my wife. • It’s my wife’s fault, really. She doesn’t satisfy me. • I am open-minded, and I can’t help it if other people, including my wife,aren’t.I am not saying that your husband harbors all these attitudes—no cheaterdoes—but your letter indicates quite a few. He has made them part of himself.It’s his story, and he’s sticking to it. Can you make him change his story outof love for you? No. If he loved you enough to change his story, he wouldn’tcheat in the first place.I don’t want to sound gloomy. Have hope, but follow up on your hope. If yourhusband is telling the truth and no longer cheating, you need to takeresponsibility and deal with your own insecurity. It’s inevitable that having acheating spouse is devastating to one’s own sense of being desirable, worthy,protected, nurtured, and cherished. You must use your vulnerable state toacquire those things in yourself. But if you undertake such a journey to heal,the first step is that your husband must agree to change his attitude. Otherwiseyou are trying to empty the bathtub while he keeps dumping in more water.LINGERING GRIEFMy only son died ten years ago in a roll-over highway accident. He wastwenty-three and my shining star. We both worked in the ER of our localhospital. His father and I have been divorced since my son was three. After thiscrushing loss I am just beginning to breathe again. I have post-traumatic stressdisorder from this, and my spirituality was deeply shaken. I feel verydisconnected from everything and everyone, although most people don’t sense it.I live in a very good place on the Yellowstone River and I find comfort watchingthe wildlife on the river, especially in the winter when the eagles are here.But my mental suffering hasn’t ended, and I don’t know what to do.—Brenda, 63, MontanaGrief is a devastating condition under circumstances like yours, and you have myheartfelt sympathy. But I am also going to be realistic, which requires somebluntness. You were living through your son, as so often happens with singlemothers. He became part of you, and when he died, part of your identity wentwith him. This happens in close relationships where two people create a singleperson, each filling the gaps and holes in the other’s psyche.In time, a twenty-three-year-old son would have found a way to separate himself,and although the process would have been difficult, you would retain his love.With the sudden separation due to accidental death you were wrenched apart, andthe numbness, confusion, alienation, depression, and “walking dead” feelingsthat you now have are the result of not being able to assemble a whole personout of the fragments left behind.For you, reading spiritual books, although comforting, hasn’t led in the rightdirection; they have made you more indwelling and isolated. I’m glad that youhave the balm of Nature to comfort you, but a big practical project lies aheadof you: putting a self back together without the missing pieces from your son.Here are the major steps in such a project:1. Decide that you want to be a complete person.2. Recognize that your son cannot replace the gaps he once filled.3. Judge yourself as worthy to be happy and deserving of a rich future.4. Connect with people who want you to be whole and fulfilled.5. Ask the most mature and fulfilled people in your life to help and supportyou.6. Find a mentor or therapist who can mirror your progress and setbacksrealistically.7. Come to terms with the residues of memory, loss, grief, and woundedness.8. Walk away from the role of victim once and for all.9. Learn to honor your grief while giving a greater place to love.Write down these nine steps and seriously consider them. Passively waiting fortime to heal you won’t work. You must work to become objective and realistic.You must be fully committed to reclaiming your own life. If you can do that, youwill be a living memorial to your son instead of a living gravestone. A livingmemorial is one that he would be proud of.FEELING BLUE—OR IS IT MORE?I have been trying to change my thought process to reflect more positivity.Negative thoughts do come, but I want to push them aside and not pay them anymind. I am doing okay most of the time, but there are moments of depression. Iam not on medication and don’t want to be. What is a good first step to changethis situation and begin to create my own reality, because I know that I can?Jennifer, 47, Northern VirginiaWhenever someone says “I’m depressed,” usually a reason follows, but your letteris quite guarded. You only reveal that you struggle with negative thoughts andwant reassurance that you can be positive again—this implies a state ofinsecurity, self-doubt, and feeling unsafe. Why do you fear that you won’t beokay?The answer to that lies within yourself, so the first step is to look atyourself closely in the mirror and find a reason for your depressed state,whenever it occurs, that you can trust. For example, • I’m stuck in a bad situation. • Someone else is controlling me. • I feel powerless to change my circumstances. • I feel like a victim. • I feel that I will never succeed. • I am in drastic lack. • I have had mood difficulties for a long time, but can’t seem to figure outwhy.These aren’t ready-made answers. I don’t want you to suddenly apply them toyourself. But if any do apply, they indicate a way out. For example, badcircumstances and situations that make you feel trapped can be changed. If youhave to, you should walk away until you land somewhere safer. Likewise, ifsomeone else is controlling your life, you need to reclaim it for yourself. Ifyou feel like a failure or hopeless, you need to address issues of self-esteem.If your moods turn negative for no reason you can find, a doctor’s care isindicated.The tendency with depression, because it makes you feel helpless and hopeless,is to cloud the truth. The truth that you need to glimpse is that a way outexists. I am not so sure you are depressed. My sense is that you feel insecureand controlled for reasons you haven’t disclosed. Perhaps you don’t feel safeenough even to divulge the problem in a letter?THE DOORMATI have a longtime friend who is always in the midst of a crisis. She calls me tocomplain about her loneliness, and she can’t think of one thing to be gratefulfor. She is on medication for bipolar disorder and also drinks heavily. She alsosmokes, involves herself with married men, and is about to lose her home afterspending a large inheritance. I have listened with a sympathetic ear for yearsnow, and I care about her well-being, but recently I have begun to feel like anenabler. Her calls are emotionally draining, but my suggestions about being morepositive cause resentment. What should I do?—Selma, 35, ChicagoReaders must be shaking their heads, wondering why you want to be a doormat forsomeone else to walk over. You have wasted years indulging your friend’s manyself-inflicted problems, a role that’s as thankless as any I can think of.You’ve permitted yourself to count for very little while she magnetizes everyconversation to herself. Now, to top it off, you’re looking for ways to feelguilty about not doing enough.Please, try to develop the inner quality known as strength. Otherwise, even ifyou walk away, you will be somebody’s doormat again. The first place to start iswith boundaries. Your friend trampled on you because you let her, and whenyou—feebly and gently—stood up for yourself, she was outraged. Let her go herown way. Learn when to say no by first checking on how you feel. If someone istaking advantage, the feeling is never good. Notice when it doesn’t feel good,and put up limits, such as “I can only talk for a few minutes.” Then, when youfind that your limits are respected, you will discover that, good as it feels tohelp others, it feels just as good to be strong.SHOULD SHE GO OR STAY?I married my husband seventeen years ago, even though I wasn’t in love with him.As a single mother, I wanted my young children to have a real family; I toldmyself that it was “the right thing to do.” Now that my daughter is old enoughto leave home and my son is fast on her heels, I feel as though my world isclosing in on me. All I have left is a lukewarm marriage—not so bad that I haveto leave, but not so good that I can enjoy having done well with my life. I feelas though I settled, and settled miserably. Help me to know if this is just amenopausal phase or an outcry from my soul.—May, 46, SeattleWhen people bring up various problems, one category stands out. Whatever theissue, whatever the conflict, at some level the person already knows what to do.They are basically asking for permission to do it. You fall into that category.Nobody asks loaded questions like “Should I go back to being bored andmiserable?” unless they already know the answer. In your view, what would make amarriage bad enough to leave it—having your husband set you on fire?There’s a touching aspect to your situation, which is that you value duty—doingthe right thing—over happiness. That’s very old-fashioned and in its way noble.But you’ve wound up with a devil’s bargain in this marriage, and one has towonder why your husband wanted a wife who didn’t love him. I think it’s obviousthat the two of you don’t communicate on any level of intimacy or emotionalhonesty. So getting out of the marriage may be the most honest thing you’ve donein many years. I applaud you for waking up and smelling the coffee.THE PROBLEM WITH LIFE IS …I’m bothered by the expression “may all beings be blessed.” How can all beingsbe blessed at the same time? The life of one being will sometimes involve thedeath of another. If you look around, life feeds on life in order to survive.Even vegetarians who wear no leather must claim some part of the earth as theirspace and banish or kill the insects that might have lived there. Does one needto make a distinction between physical blessing and spiritual blessing tojustify this seeming paradox?—Lee Ann, 54, El Paso, TexasMy first instinct is to ask if you are a worrywart. You don’t have to frustrateyourself by asking ultimate questions for which there are no answers. A blessingexpresses warm feelings, wishes, and benediction. Blessings weren’t made up byphilosophers with PhDs. But on reflection I realize that your question is moreindirect. You aren’t worried about vegetarians hurting the carrots they pull outof the ground. You are worried about the existence of cruelty and pain, the kindof pain that every life brings with it.The issue of suffering isn’t resolved for you, and I admire that. But let’sfocus on your suffering rather than whatever afflicts life itself. If youexperience your own life as something full of risk, danger, unfairness,inhumanity, and so on, that means you are a feeling person. Having me resolve apoint of morality isn’t going to erase those feelings. What will? Taking yourempathy seriously and doing one of two things. Either go out and help others whoare in suffering and pain or begin to walk the path of self-awareness. Thesearen’t incompatible choices, of course.I think you will find, once you begin to help others, that suffering doesn’tkill the human spirit. We are here to question and yearn. If we deal with ournature in a healthy way, this yearning makes us grow. If we don’t deal with ournature in a healthy way, we sit around and worry with no results but more worry.PUTTING UP WITH A GROUCHAs my husband is growing older, he is becoming a grouch, to the point that Idon’t want to go out in public with him. He finds fault with every little thing,and he can’t resist haranguing me and anyone else within earshot. At restaurantshe bawls out the server. He uses terrible language over the phone. As for me, hecriticizes the smallest incident. Two years ago I wrote him a letter saying thatI wouldn’t tolerate his bad behavior any longer. If he didn’t change, ourrelationship would come to an end. After that, things went well until six monthsago, when the quick temper and rude behavior returned. Believe it or not, Istill love my husband, but I don’t like him. What should I do?—Elizabeth, 65, DetroitI hear a voice inside me, and inside most readers, muttering, “Walk out on theSOB.” Your husband is set in his ways, even with temporary improvements. But youcannot leave until you make some basic decisions. The first is the mostimportant: Is this a situation you can fix? To answer yes, the following must betrue: • Your husband recognizes and acknowledges the problem. • He regrets losing his temper. • He asks for help. • He wants to include you in the healing process. • You see signs of improvement when you take action.In your case, the last point is cause for hope. You saw signs of improvementwhen you presented your husband with an ultimatum. He took you seriously, butnow he’s had a relapse. Can you get through to him again? Ultimatums stopworking after the first time; they turn into empty threats once you prove thatyou won’t leave.Also, I sense that you are a people-pleaser. It may take professional guidanceto steer your decision. Only after a counselor or therapist helps you to seethat fixing it is hopeless will you find the strength to extricate yourselfwithout guilt and remorse. I can assure you that this man’s life is going to godownhill fast without you.I’d also like to mention a bit more about his anger. At his age, I assume he’sretired. Men who leave a job that meant everything to them wind up, through nofault of their own, feeling bitter and wronged. It’s this internal bitternessthat causes the outbursts. He feels “better” by making others feel worse. Hissense of loss is compensated for by showing others that he is in distress. Butsince he doesn’t want to admit that he is in distress, he displays his hiddenfeelings as anger. If you feel that a sudden personality change has occurred,consider having medical tests run also.There are other ingredients that come to mind, such as his need to be right.This is a symptom of control issues. Perhaps at his work he had authority andcould tell others how to do their job. Perhaps he was always a finickyperfectionist or someone who never could be pleased. Age may have exacerbatedthose tendencies. This happens because older people often let down their socialboundaries. Their excuse for turning boorish is “I’m too old to care what otherpeople think.” That’s sad but quite common.I hope I’ve given you enough information to make the right choices, none of themeasy. You don’t need to live with an insufferable grouch who won’t admit thathe’s the one who needs to get right, not the waiter who spills coffee. Don’tlapse back into inertia. If you examine yourself closely, that’s how you willfind the means to make some hard choices.LOVE JITTERSI’ve been in a happy relationship for sixteen months and have never been thismuch in love, ever. He loves me unconditionally and tells me so every chance hegets. So why do I feel so insecure? Why, all of a sudden, do I panic that I’mgoing to lose him to someone else? I don’t want to mess this up over negativefeelings that I cannot get over.—Laura, 43, New JerseyWell, that’s how love is. It creates pain and joy at the same time, and for thesame reason, because deeper aspects of ourselves are brought to light. Theopenness that love brings, if you are lucky, isn’t just being open to the bestthings in life. You also feel like a child again, and that brings a sense ofneed that is very vulnerable.I also paused over your words “unconditional love.” Nobody loves youunconditionally who has only known you for sixteen months. It’s a lovely promiseand a desirable goal, but you’re not there yet. Some part of you knows this. Youaren’t a teenager, and you’ve fallen in and out of love before. So my advice isto look at your feelings as the normal turmoil of love and press ahead. Whensomeone asks, “How do I find the right one?” my answer is “Don’t look for theright one. Be the right one.” The same holds true for you.LOOK AT IT THIS WAYWhen I look around, I see that there’s too much pain and suffering caused byevildoing, catastrophe, and economic crisis. Is danger hovering around us allthe time, or is there another way to look at things?—Len, 31, Portland, OregonI’m sure you realize that there is another way to look at things, so the realquestion is how to adopt another way. You can’t talk yourself into seeingsunshine on a rainy day. If you try, you are deluding yourself. Many people,thinking of themselves as realists, feel the same about good and evil. Theydon’t want to take their eyes off the negative aspects of life, because realismdemands that we take the bitter with the sweet.Yet who is to say that the bitter is more real than the sweet? If your vision oflife contains love and peace, if you yourself have renounced violence, if youset yourself on the spiritual path, these things don’t mean you aren’t arealist. They mean you aim for a higher reality. I don’t mean God, although I amnot excluding religion. We are talking about hidden potential. Human nature isdivided; it contains both darkness and light. You can choose to accept thedarkness and lament it, or you can choose to expand the light until the darknessno longer dominates.There is no getting around this choice, which is highly personal. I know thatmillions of people are alienated and disenchanted. They sit passively watchingthe latest reports of violence and catastrophes, corruption and misdeeds, floatby on the evening news. But the old adage is true: one candle is enough to causethe darkness to go away. Once you choose to raise your own awareness, you willhave done the most you can to defeat the dark side of human nature and todiscover that a higher reality can actually be found and lived.PATTERN OF ABUSEI have been divorced for almost five years. I was married for twenty, but my exwas emotionally abusive. The first relationship I got into after my divorceended badly because of [my lover’s] alcoholism. Now I’m afraid that I will windup in a disastrous relationship again. How can I break the pattern and move on?—Rhonda, 46, Grand Rapids, MichiganGetting sucked into abusive relationships involves two tendencies that areintimately connected. The first is the tendency to overlook warning signs.People aren’t closed books or secret codes. They give off signals. They behavein indicative ways. If you don’t ignore the warning signs, it’s not that hard tosee who is going to be abusive, controlling, self-centered, uncaring,dominating, cruel, or severely addicted. I am not saying that the men you meetare going to present themselves with total candor and honesty. Of course theyaren’t; no one does. We show the best sides of ourselves in social situations,particularly when we want to win someone over.The second tendency is to miss the signals that tell you who is a good match foryou. Missing the red flags seems easy enough. You want to see the best inothers. You think, quite rightly, that suspicion and distrust aren’t good thingsto bring to a new relationship. But overlooking the good in others is just asdestructive. Because most people carry around an image in their heads of “theright one,” they dismiss others based on that image. Think of the men you haverejected as boring, not good-looking enough, not rich or smart enough, and so onwhen in fact their only fault was not living up to an artificial image. This iscompounded by society’s addiction to external qualities being the mostimportant. Dozens of beautiful, successful, charming singles have appeared ontelevision shows that are supposed to find perfect mates for a bachelor andbachelorette. How many happy marriages have resulted? One or two at most, andeven those have yet to stand the test of time.The critical issue, then, is how to overcome both tendencies. You want to spotthe warning signs in advance, but also the hidden virtues. The ability to dothese things comes naturally, but we block it in various ways. You’ve mentioneda big blockage, fear based on past failures and hurt. As Mark Twain once noted,a cat that has sat on a hot stove won’t sit on any stove afterward, whether itis hot or not. Which is to say, you can’t trust your old wounds. You must learnto be open and new as opportunities arise. You must learn to look past youringrained image that keeps you from seeing other people as they actually are,which is always a mixture of good and bad.Much of this comes down to ambivalence. When you can see the good and bad insomeone else, how do you react? If you are mature, you accept what is good andtolerate what is bad, but only to a point. Being ambivalent isn’t the same asperfect romance. It’s a state of tolerance. Having reached that state, somethingnew emerges. No longer blinded by a fantasy of perfect love, you find that youare less critical; you don’t judge others as much; you have less fear anddistrust. At that point you will be able to do the most important thing: youwill know what you need and how to get it. Most people are confused about whatthey actually need, and therefore they seek it in the wrong places.I would suggest that you need safety, security, reassurance, love, andnurturing, in that order. We can’t discount the wounding relationships in yourpast. At a more advanced stage, when you feel safe and secure, you might lookfor love, compassion, and wisdom as first priorities. Having identified yourneeds, look at a prospective mate realistically, as someone who might fulfillyour needs. Go on dates, relate for a while, and test the other person’scapacities. I know how easy it is to feel that you can’t place demands. Youfocus your energies on pleasing another. You self-consciously worry over beingyoung enough, pretty enough, and good enough. But that is how bad relationshipsexplode in your face. Having focused on your own shortcomings, you failed totest whether the other person actually met your needs.Once you turn around your attention, you can begin to be realistic about whothis other person is and what he has to give. I think that’s the most importantstep, and I hope I have given you enough clues about what to look for in thefuture so that it isn’t simply a repetition of the past.SPIRITUAL GRASSHOPPERNo matter how much I work at something, no matter how much I reach for others,no matter how much I meditate, contribute, or alter my mental state, everythingin my life remains the same. Nothing ever changes. I work on myself inside andoutside, but my situation doesn’t budge. What’s wrong, and why am I stuck?—Danny, 50, Athens, GreeceYou are suffering from a bad case of superficiality. If I asked you to cookdinner, would you run into the kitchen, open the cupboards, and start throwingfood around the room? That’s what you are doing with your life. You are like apanicky bird running from one thing to the next. The tone of your letter ismelodrama verging on the edge of hysteria. I suspect that you are a frazzled butcharming person who dithers and frets, but gets along well enough. So my adviceis to stand in front of the mirror and decide when you want to get serious. Atthat moment, help will come, and so will change.What you are experiencing now is almost constant change, but it’s fritteringaway your time. Happily, if there is a higher power, it takes care of spiritualgrasshoppers, too.WHAT DO MY DREAMS MEAN?Sometimes I have dreams that mean nothing, but I often have dreams that aremessages. These dreams seem to be linked to things that happen in the nearfuture. When I dream about my oldest son, most of the time it’s a warning forhim, and he has been saved a few times. In December I had a dream about fourpeople dying on the same day. Later that week it was in the news that fourconstruction workers had died falling from a building. I wouldn’t say that Ihave powers, but deep down I feel that something real is going on. Is it all inmy head, or is there a special name for this?— Carla, 35, Tampa, FloridaI agree that something is going on, but it’s not always easy to find a name forit. It’s even harder to make others believe in an experience they haven’t hadthemselves. Dreams have a long history of delivering messages. At the very leastthey have been considered meaningful and mysterious. At present, however, thependulum has swung the other way, and neuroscientists tend to say that dreamsrepresent random or garbled brain activity.If your dreams have meaning for you, isn’t that enough validation? I havemeaningful dreams myself. Sometimes they serve as a spur to creativity.Sometimes they comment on my current emotional state or on things that seemuncertain in the future. By their nature, dreams are personal and unpredictable.Your dreams contain the element of premonition. You see or sense future events,usually negative events. Why? Because despite any worries about being calleddelusional or flaky, you have opened a channel to a subtler part of your mind.You gave yourself permission to step into the domain of intuition and insight—orperhaps we should say far sight. Be happy about this. Millions of people lessopen than you have sealed off the subtler levels of the mind and have no accessto intuition and insight. As for the practical use of your dreams, a lot dependson what you think is acceptable. Maybe you can help more people than just yourson. Or maybe this will remain a private experience. Don’t resist anypossibility. Let the guidance of your heart carry you to the next step.ONE LEVEL AT A TIMEFor many years now I have been on a healing journey that becomes increasinglyspiritual, and this has made me more attuned to the things that make me feelwhole and right. But there is one person in my life, my common-law husband, whokeeps pulling me back into the shadows of doubt and negativity. I am so confusedover how I should perceive our relationship. We are raising two daughters. Idon’t feel an intimate connection with this man, yet I continue to stay becauseI feel a moral responsibility to do so. We have two young daughters to consider.I try to believe that I can achieve my own inner peace regardless of him. Hethinks we represent a normal family (from the outside). He is also veryconcerned about his self-image, which would take a blow if we separated. ShouldI continue on my own personal journey while staying in an unsatisfyingrelationship?— Gloria, 31, OntarioYour dilemma has two levels that you have mingled, and that is the main sourceof your present confusion. Let’s separate the two and see if some clarity can bereached.On the first level, you live with a man to whom you are not intimately connectedand who doesn’t want things to change. This is a self-esteem issue. Do you feellovable and worthy? If so, you wouldn’t live with him on a false basis,pretending to be normal when every fiber in your being tells you that thereality of your relationship is dysfunctional. However, this doesn’t mean thatyou should walk out tomorrow. Your priority should be to look at yourself andfind out why you feel unlovable, unworthy, ashamed, victimized, or deserving nobetter than this kind of mistreatment.I’m not suggesting that all these terms apply, but only that you need to get tothe bottom of your own motives. We know his motives. He wants to keep you underhis thumb. You rationalize your entrapment by using morality and citing youryoung daughters. In what way is it moral to raise children in an unhappyatmosphere? I think if you look a bit deeper you will see that what keeps youthere is insecurity and fear. These are serious personal issues, but they can befaced, and in your case I think you must face them.On the second level, you also want to grow spiritually. Isn’t your whole lifesending you a spiritual message right now? The message is “You aren’t in theright place emotionally. You are settling for too little. Your awareness isdominated by resistance.” Your partner is an adult, albeit a selfish and limitedadult. Accept his word—he has no interest in joining you on your journey ofpersonal growth. Maybe he feels threatened by it; maybe he thinks it’sridiculous; maybe he’s just bored. But surely you can see that he’s not going tosupport you.Having cleared out that fantasy, you will find that beneath your wishfulthinking lies a good deal of sorrow and regret. I’m very sorry for that, but tobe frank, the spiritual path is all about confronting resistance and findingstrength from within. Otherwise the whole enterprise easily turns into a frolicin dreamland. I’m glad that you feel sustained, at least somewhat, by yourspirit, given your difficult circumstances. But your spirit doesn’t want you tobe trapped like this. It doesn’t want you to retreat inside to some kind ofmythical peace while all around you is rejection and obstacles. The positiveside of the reflections you are being given is that your life can be muchbetter.Solve the first level of this dilemma, and the second level will begin to solveitself.GOING INSIDEExactly how does one “go inside” oneself?—Marian, 48, AtlantaThank you for an invaluable question. When you know exactly what it means to goinside, many riddles about personal growth begin to clear up. Actually, everyoneis already going inside. If someone asks you how you feel or what you think orif you remembered to lock the back door, you automatically go inward for theanswer. Your attention is no longer on the outside world but on the insideworld.What do you find when you go inside? A rich world, streaming with thoughts,feelings, sensations, memories, hopes, wishes, dreams, and fears. No one isimmune to the allure of this world. We experience ourselves in here, andeverything we can possibly imagine. But for every experience that’s pleasurable,there’s another that is painful.Here is the starting point of spiritual growth, because human beings, seeingthat their pain was centered inside—through painful thoughts, memories,foreboding, and guilt—wanted a way out. Is it possible to go inside and notexperience pain? Even when you feel happy and your day is going well, the shadowof bad things to come cannot be denied. So the level of thinking isn’t where thecure for pain exists. No one can control painful thoughts.Therefore, all the great spiritual guides have taught that there is anotherlevel of the mind, where silence dominates. If you can experience this silence,your mind begins to shift. Instead of being dominated by fear, guilt, and otherforms of inner pain, it is dominated by a quiet, steady state. From this stateblossoms a sense of well-being and a feeling that you are safe. If you remain onthe path and keep experiencing inner silence, peace dawns, and then joy andbliss. This is the unfoldment of the true self. It’s the whole meaning of “goinginside.”TEACHERS AND GUIDESIf someone has a problem finding their purpose in life, can another person(maybe a spiritual teacher) do it for them?—Irene, 34, IstanbulYour question is on the mind of every seeker, whether they are spiritual orseeking something else, such as love and success. For many people this processis helped along by finding a mentor. I’ve never heard anyone warn, “Be careful.Don’t let your mentor turn you into a mindless follower.” Yet one hears thatquite often when it comes to spiritual seeking.I mention this because I don’t know if you deeply want a spiritual teacher or,at the other extreme, fear being overly influenced by a counselor or guide. Letme say that no one can take from you what you don’t willingly give. There arecountless so-called teachers who want to seize power and control (not just inspirituality but in all walks of life). You must be careful not to allow this.The best safeguard is alertness. Be aware of who you are and what you seek. Youare not here to gratify any teacher, mentor, or guide. You are here to fulfillyour deepest personal goals.You can see why your question doesn’t lead to a simple answer. Yes, a guide canhelp point the way to your own sense of self and your purpose in life. No, aguide can’t replace your own search. When you are in your car driving throughtown, signposts can tell you where each road goes, but only you can turn thesteering wheel.WHERE DO WE COME FROM?I’m confused. If we all come from the same source, then where does individualitycome into play? I believe that we all come from God. We are God living a humanlife. But I am still struggling with how my individual life could mean anythingif we are all the same spirit.—Helen, 31, Terre Haute, IndianaIf I may say so, you’ve seized on a very abstract dilemma, and now it serves tomake you feel insecure. I’d guess that your motive isn’t to find a final,absolute answer. If you received a text message from God saying, “I contain allthings. The wholeness of creation is expressed through individuality, just asindividuality contains and expresses infinite intelligence,” would you suddenlyfeel secure? I’m afraid not.The issue here isn’t where people get their individuality, but how you feelabout yourself. Something about who you are is deeply bothering you. Since yourletter doesn’t give clues to the source of this insecurity, it could be hidingsomewhere. Most people look in the mirror and know what they dislike aboutthemselves (I don’t mean just physically). At your age, thirty-one, the list offlaws is usually long (it’s generally an age when people put heavy demands onthemselves, and heavy demands lead to disappointments).This kind of self-consciousness doesn’t mean you are inferior. It means that youare becoming mature and seeing yourself in realistic terms. Having seen that youaren’t perfect, you can leave adolescence behind and come to terms with reality.This isn’t a curse or a burden. It’s not something to avoid. Indeed, finallyfacing reality is the great adventure of life. Beyond maturity are horizons andpaths that lead to the heart of many mysteries. I encourage you to explore them.Perhaps, as you say, God made all of us, but he (or she) didn’t have to use acookie cutter, did he?LEARNING TO CHANGEHow do you change? At fifty-nine years old, how do you learn to think a new way,see through new eyes, keep growing with the fluidity of youth? How do I keep thecuriosity and wonderment of every day alive? Perhaps I’ve simply lost touchsomewhere along the way.—Barbara, 59, Eugene, OregonI’m afraid your chief obstacle is your belief system, which you have absorbedfrom others around you. In this belief system, youth is a time of change andflexibility. Really? In actuality the young are the most insecure among us, andthe least able to make mature life choices. They stumble and experiment. Theyworry about finding a self.In another part of the same belief system, to be middle-aged is to be washed up.You think the best of life has passed you by. Instead of renewal and freshness,there’s the day-to-day struggle not to fall into boredom and lack of enthusiasm.In actuality, in middle age you know who you are. You have a self. You’vearrived.So the answer to your dilemma is that you must examine your stuck beliefs andold conditioning. Talk with those who aren’t burdened by such limiting beliefs.This will require a bit of courage. You feel safe in your gloomy shell. Yet ifyou look around, you’ll see middle-aged people who are enthusiastic,accomplished, ready for any challenge, and eager for tomorrow. Be with them. Beopen to what they believe about life. Change will come.DIFFERENT FAITHSI converted to Buddhism in 1993, but my family is Christian, and they constantlyremind me that I won’t be with them in heaven when I die. Usually I just smileand nod because I don’t know how to respond. They are always praying for me.What can I do about this constant guilt trip?—Mira, 57, Albany, New YorkFrom what you intimate, your family is very traditional and closely bonded. Behappy for that if you can. Trying to achieve close bonding is an enormousdifficulty in the lives of millions of people. But every good thing is entangledwith other things that aren’t so good. In traditional societies, religion iswhat makes you who you are: a member of a family, tribe, ethnic group, race, andculture.Perhaps only a few of these identity tags apply to your situation, but yourletter could just as easily be coming from someone whose family was aghast thatshe was marrying a man of another skin color or ethnic group. Tradition makespeople want to cling to their identity. Change is the enemy.At fifty-seven, you need to accept their perspective and move on. You are tooold to be placating your family. One would expect such worries from a personhalf your age. I suspect that you are giving them mixed signals. You doeverything you can to get your family to believe that you are still the old you,the one they fully accept. Yet an odd difference, Buddhism, sticks out.You can’t change their resistance, but you can stop playing both sides of thefence. Show them that you are happy and secure being a Buddhist. Make clear thatcriticism isn’t fair or welcome. The next time it crops up, leave the room orthe house. Keep doing this until they get the message that your deeply heldbeliefs are off limits. The rest of you is someone they can accept.THE MAN UPSTAIRSFor quite some time I’ve struggled with God always being referred to as “He.”Can you suggest how I can be more accepting of this gender bias? Or should Iseek a more neutral approach to God, with no gender at all?—Doria, 36, PhiladelphiaIn the Judeo-Christian tradition, the concept of God as male has becomeingrained. It leads millions of people to imagine a patriarch with a long whitebeard, sitting on a throne above the clouds. I don’t know if this irks you,threatens you, arouses a sense of unfairness, or simply strikes you as toolimiting for a universal deity who is all-embracing.In the East believers tend to want it both ways, personal and universal.Personal deities are worshipped and prayed to, with various images and shrines,in the belief that having a humanized object to look at and venerate is onlyhuman. At the same time, however, it’s understood that the true nature of theGodhead is infinite, beyond limits, and boundless. Two compatible versions ofGod coexist. Does that work for you?If not, my best advice is to use this dilemma as part of your spiritual growth.Get to the bottom of what really bothers you. Explore the question with others.Read and grow. One thing I would warn against: don’t let this single issue—orany other—become a thorn in your side. There’s a lot more to the spiritual paththan whether a letter mailed to God should be labeled Mr. or Ms.A LONELY SEEKERI’ve been searching for God for several years. I’ve also been on antidepressantsfor the biggest part of my life. I have felt the presence of God before, and thefeeling was awesome but fleeting. I work as a nurse in hospice, and I can seeother people’s concept of God comforting them, yet I can no longer connect witha greater consciousness or the traditional God. I believe far more in scienceand the probability that there is no afterlife. It’s a very lonely feeling, butwhy pray? When I pray I feel like I’m just talking to myself.I want to find another concept of God that I can hope for. Atheists have nothingto hope for. I know there are no right and wrong answers, yet maybe there’sanother way to see the meaning of life without a “heavenly father.”—Cora, 52, Taos, New MexicoI’ve quoted your letter at length because many readers will empathize with youand would put their situation in the same terms. It’s much easier to walk out ofa church or temple than to find a new one to walk into. There really is no newdoor, however. There is only a journey. Traditional religion has the advantageof being ready-made. If you pray, follow the commandments, believe in thetheology, and don’t stray, you have no need to forge your own path.You are beyond ready-made paths, and despite your loneliness, you should honoryourself for where you’ve arrived. You aren’t at the end of the road, nor areyou at the end of belief. This is a way station. There are many steps ahead onceyou find out how to walk them. Because you work with the dying, you don’t havethe luxury of avoiding the big questions about life and death that most of usdelay until a crisis shakes us out of our inertia. For you, death isn’t an idletopic. Much in your life depends on sorting out the relationship between lifeand death. Instead of turning this into a burden, you could choose to make it anadvantage. Appreciate that you are motivated to find out who God really is.I think for you the best thing would be to solve your lonely feeling first,however. Even though you don’t live in a major city, I’m sure that there arespiritual groups nearby where people would welcome you on the terms you offer:you are a troubled seeker who wants new answers. So are they. Find thelike-minded, and experience fellowship and support from them. You are a bornhelper. It’s time you helped yourself by nourishing the part of you that wantsto belong and be comforted. The God part will come in due course.DID I MAKE MYSELF SICK?I was diagnosed with breast cancer last February at the age of thirty-eight.Since then I’ve read a lot about the mind-body connection. Now that mytreatments are finished, I can’t escape a nagging doubt: Could I have caused mycancer through my thought patterns, negative or otherwise? I’ve read oneexplanation, which says that breast cancer arises from nurturing others whileignoring your own needs. Is this true? I feel so guilty thinking this way.—Yasmin, 39, Santa Monica, CaliforniaOne of the frustrating things about mind-body medicine is that so many patients,perhaps the majority, focus on “How did I do this to myself?” Guilt substitutesfor healing. Nagging doubts block the intention to heal. As this worry turnsinto an obsession, it gets entangled with lots of other anxieties, chief amongthem the fear of recurrence. Thus what started out as help in getting the mindto aid the body turns on its head, and the mind becomes a place of dread, worry,and fear.How do you get out of this vicious circle? What can release the mind’s helpwithout incurring its pain?First, realize that you have put yourself into a double bind by blaming themind. Imagine your mind as your parent instead. Would it work to say, “I needyour love because you’re the one who hurt me in the first place?” No, becauseonce you blend love and hurt, blame and healing, the two poles war against eachother. What you are feeling, and describing, is inner conflict.Second, face the conflict. The issue isn’t “Did I do this to myself?” The issueis “What can I do about the war inside myself?” Rest assured, no studiesindicate that there are “cancer personalities.” Despite the hypothetical linkbetween the emotional style of a person and the possibility of being at highrisk for disease, such links are very, very far from dooming anyone to cancer.Genetic links are also far from simple. In fact, no one-to-one correlation hasbeen established between anything and breast cancer.Third, having faced the real problem, consider the positive side of mind-bodymedicine. It’s a vast field, and what it offers is a route to wellness ingeneral. That is a great thing for all of us to bring into our lives. Look atyour situation and decide, as realistically as you can, what two things out ofthe following list would lead to wellness: • less external stress • a supportive group of survivors • treatment for anxiety and depression • a deeper understanding of the latest mind-body research • spiritual exploration and growth • medical reassurance • a helper to cope with everyday demands • better working conditions • meditation to calm your mind • being touched and soothed physically (massage, bodywork, etc.) • emotional closeness from a partner • prevention and lifestyle changesYour enemy is isolation and the lonely, helpless feeling that it brings. In thislist of suggestions, each one helps to combat isolation and helplessness. It’sup to you to examine yourself from the inside in order to assess your immediateneeds. Modern medicine is impersonal, I regret to say. The support oftraditional society is long in the past for most of us. So it falls to eachpatient to structure his or her own wellness. I encourage you to begin thisjourney. The dark time you are experiencing now can be healed.AT PEACE BUT NOT HAPPYIs inner peace the same as happiness? I cannot say that I’m happy, but I’m nolonger sure this is even the appropriate question. I do feel an inner peace thatappears to be persistent. Would that peace disappear if I found myself homelessor freezing with cold? Would it disappear if I won the lottery? Maybe I need tofind ways to stay connected with this peace in extreme circumstances.—James, 48, Cork, IrelandYou aren’t experiencing peace. You are caught in stasis, and what most peoplewould call the blahs, you call peace. Sad to say, millions of us are grateful tobe blah, because it’s a lot better than being homeless or ill. However, eventhough hiding in a hole is certainly safe, it’s nobody’s notion of sheer bliss.Happiness has become a hot topic of research in psychology, and I suspect thatyou have encountered some of that. One branch of so-called “positive psychology”echoes your belief that happiness is temporary and fleeting. Outside conditionscontribute to whether we feel happy or sad. So does an “emotional set point,”which for some people is preset on the sunny side and for others on the gloomyside. Yet whatever makes a person happy or sad, research suggests that personalchoice is the biggest factor. Which means that your peace is the result ofmaking choices in the past. We have all been conditioned to mistake ingrainedbeliefs for reality and stubborn habits for the inevitable.There are other kinds of choices that bring a new level of happiness, known asbliss or ecstasy. This sort of happiness is permanent, deep, and part of yourtrue self. It’s the only happiness that no one can take away from you. Once youhave explored the choices open to you, you can decide if you want to settle foryour current state of peace. If you decide to move ahead, the path is one ofexpanded awareness—that’s the secret to experiencing happiness and peace at thesame time.FINDING FORGIVENESSHow can I be sure I have completely forgiven my former spouse for his abuse,abandonment, and alcoholism? Can this really be done properly without contactinghim? We were together for twenty years, and I haven’t spoken to him since themessy divorce fifteen years ago. Through much work spiritually I have learned toembrace all the good things we had together. I feel compassion for him and hisabusive childhood. Is this enough? I am more content and confident than ever,but I must have more work to do here.—Ellen, 53, Virginia Beach, VirginiaYou are asking a question to which the answer might seem self-evident. What ifyou had written, “How do I know if my arm doesn’t hurt anymore?” When pain isgone, it’s gone. But the mind isn’t that simple, for two reasons, and both applyhere.First, there’s more than one layer of pain in the mind. You are experiencingresidual pain that lies deeper than you have yet reached. It’s lodged in a placewhere your identity is. In this place you may not want to remember the past orhold on to it, yet somehow another aspect of yourself says, “I have to hold on.”It’s complicated to get at such feelings because in a sense you must unwind awhole tangled ball of yarn, pulling out some threads and keeping others.Intensive self-examination and often long-term psychological therapy arerequired, with no guarantee of success. In my experience, the deepest traumaturns into one’s cross to bear. I’m sorry to use that phrase, but please knowthat old burdens can be lightened. You have been lightening yours for fifteenyears, and the healing process will continue, thanks to your degree ofself-awareness.Second, the mind keeps looking at itself and finding flaws. This is a familiargame and one you can’t win. Your letter expresses self-doubt more than residualrage against your husband. Thus in writing to him you hope—in fantasy—to gainhis support or an apology. Banish this from your mind; it will never happen.Self-doubt also comes through in your remark that not finding a new relationshipreflects something left undone by you.If so, what’s left undone is finding your own feet and becoming your own personwithout a man. One big reason that you stayed married to an alcoholic husbandwho abused you was that you desperately believed you needed him. That needcontinues to linger in the back of your mind, and you hope you can transfer itto a new man in your life. My best advice is to work more on finding your trueself and less on forgiveness. Forgiveness will come when being yourself isenough to fulfill you.A BLESSED SOUL OR PETER PAN?I’ve enjoyed my life, and since the age of twenty-two I’ve always felt blessedwith a deeper connection to God. I’ve come to know that I’m a spiritual beingliving a human experience. But my career has been very erratic. I’ve alwaysmoved on when a job wasn’t fulfilling or another opportunity presented itself.Currently I’m unemployed and on the verge of bankruptcy. Yet deep inside I knowthat everything is unfolding perfectly and that my children and I will be okay(I’ve been divorced for fifteen years).My question is this: Why am I continually attracting lack into my life when I’mtrying to attract abundance?—Teddy, 53, Toledo, OhioSeveral aspects of your story don’t hang together. A connection to God impliesself-knowledge, but you seem mystified by how you got where you are today. Youcall yourself blessed, but you seem rather unconcerned about leading a life thatprobably has put a good deal of stress on your family. My instinct is that thisisn’t about attracting lack or abundance. In my experience, two types of menmove restlessly from job to job. The first kind are creative, curious, livelypeople who love new challenges, dislike routine, and keep their eye fixed on thenext horizon. The second type are irresponsible, restless, and unable to growup. They are the Peter Pans of this world, a charming trait when you’re a boy,but not so good when you’re supposed to be an adult.So, which are you?Once you have seriously examined yourself and found the answer, your presentsituation will become clearer. If you are creative and curious, then probablyyou need to start your own business and find an outlet that won’t turn into abore in six months or a year. If you are the second type, however, things willcontinue to be rough. Probably the best you can do is simply find another jobfrom which you will eventually move on. The sad thing is that at fifty-three,your time is running out, and so is your strategy for not turning into a matureperson."},{"pageContent":"[images/Chop_9780307719195_epub_004_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":" Consciousness leads to solutions by its own nature. Once you know this, yourlife will require much less struggle. In every situation, if you allow yourconsciousness to do what it naturally wants to do, the quickest and mostcreative way to meet any challenge will unfold itself. So what doesconsciousness want to do? It wants to express itself. That’s a very generalanswer, like saying that a seedling wants to reach the sun or that a child wantsto grow up. In living things, self-expression is always present, but to see whatis really happening, we have to examine the specifics. At any given moment aseedling is performing numerous processes at the cellular level, and inside ayoung child’s brain millions of neural pathways are maturing.What are the specifics when it comes to consciousness? The answer can be brokendown into the qualities of consciousness. You’ve already read about the twistsand turns of problems to which people want personal answers. Behind thesepersonal difficulties lie broader aspects of how life works, and since life isconsciousness in action, nothing is more helpful than standing back andexamining the essential qualities of your own awareness. Our examination will bea bit abstract at first; afterward we’ll look at how to apply these qualities toour situation here and now.Once you realize that consciousness is trying to express itself, simply allowingthat to happen is enough. You don’t have to intervene, plan, calculate, ormanipulate your awareness. In fact, this is the first quality of consciousness:QUALITY NO. 1: CONSCIOUSNESS WORKS WITHIN ITSELF.I remember a spiritual teacher being asked, “Is the growth of awarenesssomething we do or something that happens to us?” Without pause he replied, “Itfeels like something you are doing, but actually it’s something that ishappening to you. Consciousness is unfolding within itself. You don’t drive it.It drives itself.” To see the importance of this point, think of consciousnessas being like the ocean. Oceans are vast ecosystems that support life; theycontain everything needed inside themselves: water, chemicals, food, oxygen, andan array of living things. Each living thing leads its own existence. Coralsdon’t think about fish and vice versa. The balance of nature is such that simplyby being itself, fulfilling its own needs, every form of sea life supports everyother form. The ocean is self-sufficient. In the same way, consciousnesscontains everything it needs to regulate your life, leaving nothing out. Cellsare within its reach, and so are thoughts. Feelings are overseen byconsciousness, and so are muscle reflexes.In this first quality, many things are implied. First, there is nowhere else youneed to go in order to find a solution. Since it is all-embracing, consciousnesscontains all possibilities, which means that the solution you are seekingalready exists in potential. You can trust your own awareness, but your trustdoesn’t lead to egotism or isolation. Answers that come from other people, evenfrom totally unexpected sources, are just as available. Working within itself,consciousness wants to find the answer at the same time that you do. You areconnected to wholeness.QUALITY NO. 2: CONSCIOUSNESS USES INTELLIGENT FEEDBACK LOOPS.It can easily be seen that consciousness is always on the move, because ourminds are a constant stream of thoughts and sensations. To be alive is to bedynamic. This dynamism isn’t random. To sustain life, there has to be purpose. Acheetah running after a gazelle is no different from an amoeba going throughcell division or a child learning the first letters of the alphabet.Consciousness is pursuing a goal. But goals change and they often clash. Acheetah also needs to sleep; an amoeba needs to seek light; a child needs toplay. In order to balance the myriad functions that keep you alive, yourconsciousness talks to itself, sees what it is doing, and changes course when itneeds to.The technical term for this kind of self-monitoring is a feedback loop. Theclassic example of a feedback loop is a thermostat, because it senses when thetemperature is too warm or too cold and adjusts the heat accordingly. Theexample doesn’t go nearly far enough to describe a living feedback loop,however. The feedback loops that run your body coordinate hundreds of functions;they respond to changes both “in here” and “out there”; they run automaticallybut also pay attention to your wishes and intentions; finally, they areintelligent. The ability of consciousness to intelligently monitor brain, body,action, reaction, thoughts, feelings, and intentions is a miracle so vast inscope that no one will ever fully comprehend it. Yet everything you do dependsupon it. The best solutions take advantage of as much intelligent feedback aspossible.QUALITY NO. 3: CONSCIOUSNESS SEEKS BALANCE.Even if we will never unravel the full mystery of consciousness, we need tounderstand the basics, and one of these is balance. As it monitors itself, yourawareness is making sure that no process runs to extremes without being drawnback. In the body this is known as homeostasis, and it’s a peculiar kind ofbalance. Unlike a mechanical balance scale with two pans that go up and downdepending on which side is heavier, the body maintains dynamic balance, meaningthat even when everything is on the move, homeostasis isn’t thrown off.Imagine a young runner training for a race who doesn’t know that she’s justbecome pregnant. As she runs, her lungs, heart rate, and blood pressure keep theright balance of nutrients and oxygen, a balance very different from what thebody needs at rest. At the same time the hormonal changes associated withpregnancy are automatically kicking in. The brain is controlling both thevoluntary side (wanting to go for a run) and the involuntary side (making ababy). At a certain point the woman will register that she doesn’t feel the sameas usual. The physical signs of pregnancy will come to her awareness, and thenshe will make new decisions that will lead to a new kind of balance.Life is much more dynamic than just going for a run and making a baby.Homeostasis regulates hundreds of functions at every moment. But in this examplewe see the three domains of consciousness: voluntary, involuntary, andself-aware. In other words, to be in balance you do what you want to do, allowthe automatic processes to run as they need to, and keep watch on both. A trulyeffective solution reaches into all three domains and keeps them in balance.QUALITY NO. 4: CONSCIOUSNESS IS ENDLESSLY CREATIVE.Even when we grasp that life works through intelligent feedback loops, wehaven’t yet arrived at the real secret. Feedback loops don’t need to evolve.Early life-forms like blue-green algae or one-celled amoebas were tremendoussuccesses. They could have survived forever without evolving, as we see by thefact that they have already flourished unchanged for two billion years. Nothingvisible in a cell gives the slightest clue that new life-forms are going toemerge. Indeed, nothing at the instant of the Big Bang implied that stars andgalaxies would appear. That first instant was a swirl of superheated matter inits most primitive state, containing subatomic particles in embryo. As matterand antimatter collided, the result was annihilation for both. The universecould have—in fact, should have—collapsed back into the void from which it wasborn. But it didn’t.Matter exceeded antimatter by around one part in a billion, and that tinyimbalance led to the visible universe, giving rise to DNA on planet Earth elevenbillion years later. At the level of consciousness, an infinite thirst forcreativity seems to have been at work. We don’t need to go into the speculationthat the cosmos is alive and always has been. Reduced to personal experience,the drive of creativity is evident everywhere in your life. Since birth, yourbody has been growing and developing; using its raw potential, you have mastereda set of skills such as reading and writing but also any number that suit yourown desires (sailing, walking a tightrope, playing the violin); your brain hasconfronted a unique stream of data from the outside world, amounting to billionsof bits per hour, streaming through the five senses, and every minute is unique,never exactly duplicating that stream from the moment before.In the midst of this flood of new experience, you have no choice but to becreative. Your cells don’t store life. It is estimated that cells retain only afew seconds’ or minutes’ worth of food and oxygen, which is why the brain cansuffer permanent damage with as little as seven to ten minutes of oxygendeprivation. Adapting to all kinds of climate, diet, altitude, humidity, andother variables in the environment requires enormous creativity, and we haven’teven arrived at what we normally think of as creative—the work we do, the artsand crafts we pursue, the responses we give to our thoughts, feelings, anddesires. Yet from this astonishing complexity one strand runs througheverything: consciousness seeks to be as creative as possible. The bestsolutions allow this inner hunger to be satisfied without restraint.QUALITY NO. 5: CONSCIOUSNESS ABSORBS EVERY PART INTO THE WHOLE.If you look around, you see infinite variety in nature. A teaspoonful of dirtfrom your garden could occupy the entire lifetime of a biologist to understand,and even then he would have to depend on specialists in insects, microorganisms,and chemistry. If something contains infinite parts, what is the whole like? Itcan’t be more than the sum of its parts, because nothing is larger thaninfinity. The universe isn’t more than the sum of its atoms, molecules, stars,and galaxies. The body isn’t more than its five trillion cells. Yet somehowconsciousness defies such logic.The infinity of consciousness is bigger than the infinity of its parts. I’vesaved this concept for last because it is the most abstract; at the same time,it is also the most crucial. Consider the thoughts in your head. A machine couldbe invented that ticked off each thought like a turnstile clicking off customersentering a store. Between the cradle and the grave you will tick off a certainnumber of thoughts, let’s say ten million. But how many thoughts are possible ina lifetime? That number is much bigger than ten million. Instead of thinkingabout the color blue, at any given moment you can think of any color. Instead ofbuying a Fuji apple at the market this morning, you could have bought anyfruit—or nothing at all. In other words, the potential to think is infinite,even though the actual thoughts that come into your head are finite.The infinite potential of consciousness constitutes its true reality. What weexperience isn’t even the tip of the iceberg, because icebergs are solidobjects. Consciousness contains every possible impulse of the mind, everypossible configuration of events, and every possible outcome that those eventsmight lead to. By comparison, the cosmologists who theorize that there may betrillions of other universes lying in dimensions we cannot see or contact—theso-called multiverse theory—have barely considered the scope of reality. Thereis more than one size of infinity, and consciousness embraces them all.Let’s take a step back from this breathtaking view. As an individual, you takecomfort in not facing infinity. You don’t want countless varieties of applesexisting in infinite grocery stores. (The great marketing secret of McDonald’sis that essentially it sells only one thing—a hamburger—to which a few frillscan be added, giving the illusion of choice. This secret was powerful enough tolaunch the world’s most successful fast-food chain.) To remain comfortable, wehide from infinity, but in so doing we are hiding from reality. There is a“reality illusion” that denies the infinite nature of consciousness. We all livein our own bubble, taking ourselves to be the center of the world—that’s wherethe reality illusion is manufactured and upheld, moment by moment.If you sit in a restaurant and look around, it’s not hard to see how each personconstructs their own reality illusion. One person is withdrawn, anotheroutgoing. One feels victimized and defensive, another in control and expansive.Each person builds boundaries from basic materials like success and failure,belonging or being an outsider, playing the victim or the martyr, the boss orthe underling, leader or follower. In order to find a solution that works, youmust dismantle your own reality illusion in order to arrive at the real reality,which is consciousness. The five qualities we’ve just covered offer an openingto becoming real, and that is enough to solve any problem. Solutions are alwaysavailable at the level of reality; problems arise at the level of the realityillusion.BREAKING DOWN THE ILLUSIONNow we have the mechanics for any spiritual solution: let your inner awarenessexpress itself. The technique couldn’t be simpler. You stop interfering withwhat your higher consciousness wants to do. It takes a shift in perspective tobegin to implement this strategy, because everyone is used to jumping intosituations with prefabricated responses. Those who rely on control try tocontrol the situation. Those who compete try to win and be number one. Those whocan’t stand confrontation lie back and hope that “things will work out.” It mayseem at first glance that this last option is the one I am advocating. Are yousupposed to stand aside and let consciousness do whatever it wants, likewatching a seed grow after you’ve watered it?In a way, yes. But there’s a big difference. You can’t stand aside fromconsciousness. You need to let it unfold without resisting, yet at the same timeyou give your full participation. There’s no other choice, since even the mostpassive, aloof, or uninvolved person has made a choice to be that way; they areparticipating in doing nothing. I’m not recommending passivity. There is a lotto do when you want a solution that comes from the deepest level of awareness.HOW TO AWAKEN YOUR DEEP AWARENESSLook at your hidden assumptions and beliefs.Remove the obstacles you’re raising. Stop resisting.Become objective.Take responsibility for your own feelings. Don’t blame or project.Ask for answers to come from every direction.Trust that the solution is there, waiting to unfold.Become part of the discovery. Use curiosity. Follow hunches and intuition.Be willing to turn on a dime. Quick changes are part of the discovery process.Accept that everyone inhabits his or her own reality bubble. Become aware of thereality that other people are coming from.Approach every day as if it’s a new world, because it is.Until you follow these steps, the possibility of finding new answers will bevery limited, because you are reinforcing your reality illusion when what isneeded is a breakout. It takes energy to maintain an illusion; you have to beconstantly vigilant to defend your boundaries; you censor the messages cominginto your awareness that you don’t like and favor those that fit your concept ofwhat is acceptable. In short, the reality illusion is a construct for creatingproblems. It isn’t a construct for creating solutions.If this checklist seems too daunting, let me share a simple technique that worksfor me. In any given situation, I don’t act until I run through the ingrained,unconscious things that my first impulse tells me to do. The choices are notmany. You can choose from a short menu of very basic options:Emotionally, I react to negative situations by beingangryanxiousWhen action is called for, I am usuallyleadingfollowingIf someone else is doing something I don’t like,I usuallyconfrontwithdrawGiven a major challenge, I prefer tobe part of a groupgo it aloneIf I sit back to view myself overall, my style isdependent: I let others make the big decisions. I like being liked. I put offtough decisions. I often don’t say what I feel, or do what I really want to do.controlling: I am fussy about details. I have standards and expect others tolive up to them. I’ve been called a perfectionist. I find it easy to tell otherswhat to do. I find excuses for my bad decisions but hold grudges against others.competitive: I am always aware of who is winning and losing. I go the extra mileto be on top. I see myself as a leader and others as followers. I like toperform and often feel that I have to. I find it easy to step over other people,but I also crave the approval of others.In any situation, I keep in mind how I will reflexively react, and I take amoment to stop doing what comes automatically. By stepping back, I ask for adifferent, more flexible response to emerge, either inside me or in mysurroundings. This isn’t the same as making myself wrong. Instead, I allowexpanded awareness to have a chance. Unless it is given a chance, the onlyresponse available to me will be the same anger or anxiety, leading orfollowing, winning or losing. Life is ever fresh. It cannot be met withconditioned responses. If life is to renew itself, you must renew your reactionsas well.SEVEN LEVELS OF ILLUSIONBy breaking down your own reality illusion—the one that is unique to you—youaccomplish two things: first, you come out of contracted awareness into expandedawareness; second, you merge into the intelligent feedback loops that are incharge of every aspect of life. Naturally, the process needs to be morespecific, so let me outline seven levels of problems that arise from contractedawareness and the solutions that take you one step closer to reality.LEVEL 1: PROBLEMS CREATED BY FEAR, ANGER, AND OTHER NEGATIVE IMPULSESThe basic response is defensive. Anger and fear are primal but unevolved. Almostall your energy is directed at survival. At this level you want to lash out andblame others. You feel frustrated that the situation is happening. Everythingseems to be out of control, and as others put more pressure on you—or evendirect abuse at you—you contract with anxiety and anger.You are stuck at this level if you feel helpless, victimized, anxious,paralyzed, lost, or in need of guidance from those who are stronger than you.Weakness dominates your response.The solution: Feel your negative response, but don’t trust it. Move beyond fearand anger. Ask for guidance from people who aren’t reacting at such a primallevel. Make no decisions until you feel balanced and clear once more. Haste isyour enemy. Impulse control is your ally.LEVEL 2: PROBLEMS CREATED BY YOUR EGOThe basic response is self-centered. Thoughts arise like “This shouldn’t behappening to me. I don’t deserve it,” or “Nobody is doing what I want.” At thislevel you don’t feel afraid; you feel blocked in getting what you want, usuallybecause someone else’s ego is opposing yours. A spouse doesn’t agree with yourway of doing things; a boss has ideas about how to get things done that aredifferent from your ideas; you see the goal but can’t reach it despite yourdrive to win and accomplish.You are stuck at this level if you feel overly competitive, contrarian, driven,blocked by opponents, unsuccessful, or like a loser. “What about me?” dominatesyour thinking.The solution: Start to share and give, especially of yourself. Let others standin the limelight with you. Pass around the credit for achievements; takeresponsibility for setbacks. Stop focusing on external rewards like money andstatus. Make others feel equal to you. Perceiving every situation as win or loseis your enemy. Finding inner fulfillment is your ally.LEVEL 3: PROBLEMS CREATED BY CONFORMITYThe basic response is going along to get along. You want to fit in and not makewaves, but peer pressure is making you give away too much. You feel that certaincore values, such as self-respect and honesty, or worthiness and independence,have been sacrificed. Thoughts arise like “This isn’t me,” or “I don’t agreewith what everyone else is saying.” You get into binds that involve makingpromises you can’t keep, pretending to be more competent than you really are, oreven faking it in order to fit in.You are stuck at this level if you feel anonymous, untrue to yourself, passive,bullied, coerced, lost in the shuffle, or empty. Dull conformity dominates yourthinking, and probably a not-so-secret urge to rebel.The solution: Take back the power you gave away. Speak your truth when itcounts. Draw a line when your core values are violated. Stay out of cliques andfactions. Walk away from gossip. Learn to question conventional wisdom andgroup-think. Give a higher priority to self-respect. Falling into line is yourenemy. Becoming an individual is your ally.LEVEL 4: PROBLEMS CREATED BY NOT BEING UNDERSTOOD AND APPRECIATEDThe basic response is to isolate yourself. Because you don’t feel that othersunderstand you, you retreat inside, becoming lonely and unsupported by peoplearound you. It becomes difficult either to love or be loved. Personalconnections fray; there is little ability to bond. You wonder if you evenmatter.You are stuck at this level if you feel alone, abandoned, unloved,unappreciated, shut out, shut down, or drifting. “Nobody is here for me”dominates your thinking.The solution: Seek the company of mature people who are capable of empathy.Examine how you isolate yourself through silence, walking away, and passivity.Show that you value your feelings by actually expressing them. Show the sameunderstanding that you want to receive. Wearing a mask is your enemy, even apleasant mask. Opening up our inner world is your ally.LEVEL 5: PROBLEMS CREATED BY BEING UNIQUEThe basic response is self-expression without limits. You want to be the mostyou can be, and this drive has led you into art, discovery, invention, and otheroutlets for creativity. What others call your narcissism is what you call yourinspiration. You are frustrated unless life brings something new every day; youcrave being recognized. This attitude, which should be liberating, leads toproblems in meeting the needs of others. Authority rankles and makes you want tobreak free. Rigid rules were created for other people, not you.You are stuck at this level if you feel stifled in your creativity, blocked bythe stupidity or conformity of others, answerable only to your own muse, orentitled to be yourself no matter what the cost. “I have to be me” dominatesyour thinking, and you feel justified by your uniqueness.The solution: Form attachments to other creative types. Allow relationships toanchor you, so that you are more in touch with reality. Treasure fantasy, butdon’t get lost in it. Share your talents by teaching and giving of your time. Bea mentor. Look to greater minds for inspiration and also humility. Vanity isyour enemy. Constantly renewing your imagination is your ally.LEVEL 6: PROBLEMS CREATED BY BEING A VISIONARYThe basic response is idealism. You possess a strong moral compass. Thinkinglittle about yourself, you want to improve the human condition. But your loftyvision, as much as it inspires some people, brings up resistance in others. Theyfeel as if you are making them wrong, even though that is far from yourintention. You want a better existence for everyone, with injustice banished andspiritual equality the norm. You have gone beyond rigid definitions of right andwrong, only to find that countless people follow such definitions and are notopen to having them challenged.You are stuck at this level (a very high one) if you feel weighed down by life’ssorrows, disappointed in humanity, overwhelmed by the troubles you see allaround you, and baffled by the lack of vision that you meet every day. “I amhere to bring the light” dominates your thinking.The solution: Exercise tolerance. Use moral values to uplift others rather thanjudge them. Don’t try to imitate impossible models, the great sages and saintsof the past. Take time for basic enjoyments like laughter and the beauty ofnature. Being loved for your perfection is your enemy. Being loved as a person,however fallible, is your ally.LEVEL 7: THE STATE OF NO PROBLEMSThe basic response is openness, acceptance, and peace. You are no longertroubled by a divided self. For you, reality doesn’t present itself as goodversus evil, light versus darkness, or “me” against “the other.” You express thewholeness of life, which is like a river flowing free. You allow the river tomove instead of clinging to the banks. Life unfolds as it was meant to, as ifevery event, no matter how small, has its place in the divine plan.You have attained the state of no problems if you feel spontaneously creative,completely at home in the cosmos, eternally at peace, and merged with all ofcreation. “I am everything” dominates your thinking, although there is no reasonto have such thoughts, since unity has become your natural way of being.FINDING YOUR TRUE SELFAny good psychologist, even an amateur one who has studied human nature, wouldagree with the list just given. I think they would also agree that the vastmajority of problems occur at the lower levels, where negative impulses and egoare dominant. Much of humanity struggles to survive, and when life becomeseasier, the door is opened for the ego’s “all about me” thinking. This makes ithard to see how spirituality can make a dent, much less be the guiding light ofone’s life. The way that spirituality works, however, is not from the bottom up.Fighting to survive is about limitations, which is the state where your trueself, or the soul, is most masked and hidden from view.The world has needed its great spiritual teachers to guide us away from thesurface of life. We need to be taught not to believe in the mask that realitywears. As a basic fact, everyone believes in his or her reality illusion.Despite this fact, however, the real reality is untouched by sorrow andstruggle. Whether we know it or not, all of us are in the world but not of it.In practical terms, spirituality works from the top down. Your true self is yoursource. You cannot be separated from it, and therefore you have a choice. Eitheryou move toward the true self, the level of the soul, or you move away from it.One direction is evolutionary; the other is static at best, and usuallydestructive.To keep evolving, it is necessary to know the signs of evolution. They indicatethat you are getting closer to your true self. To evolve is a process. It hasits ups and downs. There are days when you lose sight of it, and others when youstop believing that you are evolving at all. No one is immune from the twistsand turns of the spiritual path. Yet the world’s great teachers have seen andlived the true self. From them we receive a picture of what pure awareness is,the basis of the true self. With that in mind, it is much easier to measure yourown evolution. Here are the most important teachings about the true self, whichwill then be described in detail. All have practical implications. Working fromthe top down, the true self is trying to draw closer every day.WHEN YOU ARE YOUR TRUE SELF 1. Your life has a unique purpose. 2. That purpose is unfolding continually, becoming richer and deeper. 3. If you align yourself with your purpose, that is enough. 4. As your life unfolds, awareness expands without limits. 5. With expanded awareness, desires can be fulfilled completely. 6. Challenges are solved by rising to a level higher than the challenge. 7. Your life is part of a single human destiny: arriving at unityconsciousness.As you can see, nothing here is couched in religious terms. You can rephraseevery item using words like God, soul, or spirit, but it’s not required. Insteadof saying, “My life has a unique purpose,” you could say, “God has given my lifea unique purpose.” The same reality holds even if the terminology changes. Letme expand on each aspect of the true self, with the aim of making them personalto your life here and now.1. YOUR LIFE HAS A UNIQUE PURPOSE.Everyone pursues a purpose in life. The human mind is goal-oriented, and eachday brings new desires to fulfill. With a family to raise, relationships tonurture, things to acquire, and a career to focus on, short-term purpose issupplied almost automatically (and when someone loses their sense of purpose, weworry that they are seriously depressed). There is no need to introducespirituality until you change the question from “Does your life have a purpose?”to “Does life have a purpose?” The second question is much more uncertain. Itopens up a gap that needs to be closed. In the world’s wisdom traditions, lifehas always been seen to have a purpose, which can be stated in various ways. Thepurpose of life isto find out who you really areto grow and evolveto reach higher states of consciousnessto experience the divineto become enlightenedIf you can find fulfillment on any of these levels, you are achieving yourvision, not simply meeting the demands of everyday existence. A greater visioncloses the gap between you and the universe. If life itself has a purpose, yourexistence fits into the cosmic scheme. The threat that existence is meaningless,which would lead to anxiety and despair, or an aching sense of loneliness, isremoved when you are certain of your place in creation.2. THAT PURPOSE IS UNFOLDING CONTINUALLY, BECOMING RICHER AND DEEPER.This principle is about connecting the present and the future. The purpose oflife cannot be postponed; unless it unfolds every day, the future will never beanything more than a repetition of old patterns and behavior. Psychologistsobserve that when old age is a time of satisfaction, looking back on a life welllived, the reason is that the person has successfully met many challenges overthe years. For those who find old age empty or bitter, the opposite hashappened: relationships didn’t work out, careers fell short, families driftedapart. In other words, every day has long-term consequences.It helps tremendously to know that you are part of a larger scheme. This wasonce a given—in an age of faith, people lived for the glory of God or to attainsalvation. Every day brought you one step closer to your goal. The need for avision hasn’t gone away, but it isn’t a given anymore, except for those whoretain deep religious faith.When the purpose of life isn’t a given, what is it? A process. You discover thegoal of existence by living it. The present is the only time when you canevolve, experience the divine, expand your awareness, or reach enlightenment.But this cannot be a haphazard journey that falters and wanders off the path.It’s easy for that to happen when a crisis develops. Sudden losses and setbacksshake everyone up; those who keep moving forward are buoyed by knowing thattheir path cannot be destroyed, only interrupted.3. IF YOU ALIGN YOURSELF WITH YOUR PURPOSE, THAT IS ENOUGH.This principle is about effort and struggle. It says that in spirituality,neither is necessary. The cosmic purpose unfolds automatically, not becausethere is a fixed design, but because creativity and intelligence are built intocreation. Nature isn’t outside us; it moves in, around, and through us. If youalign yourself with the movement of creation, you will experience flow and ease.If you oppose the movement of creation, you will meet obstacles and resistance.In many ways this is the “crunch point” of everyone’s life. If you approachspirituality as an ideal that would be nice to achieve, your real allegiancelies elsewhere. For people ruled by ambition, nothing is more real than gettingahead. For people ruled by anxiety, nothing is more real than the threats theytry to keep at bay. Your life at this moment is expressing where your allegiancelies. It could be an allegiance to family, status, money, possessions,career—anything is possible. None of these are bad; they are not unspiritual, infact. The problem is that such allegiances are superficial, acting out on thesurface of life, without the support of spirit, God, the universe—choosewhatever term you feel comfortable with.This means that spirituality becomes practical only when you switch yourallegiance to a deeper level. It’s not more faith that people need, but moreproof, day in and day out, that relying on life’s deeper purpose actually works.That’s where the process comes in. You move from a fragile beginning, where youhope and wish that God or the universe will support you. Then you reach themiddle of the journey, when you have a strong belief that you are supported.Finally you arrive at the place where you know that you are supported. You canmove from hope to belief to knowing. It’s the natural unfolding of each life,and the journey doesn’t take years and years. Every day can bring thefulfillment of hopes and wishes, changing them into certainty that you are seen,understood, and nurtured.4. AS YOUR LIFE UNFOLDS, AWARENESS EXPANDS WITHOUT LIMITS.This principle tells you where your support will come from. It comes from yourown awareness. In order for the process of unfolding to continue, it must growinside. On the outside, life brings new challenges, and what makes them new isthat old answers don’t work to solve them. Today’s riddles need today’s answers.This back-and-forth allows your life to rise continually, because at the deepestlevel you are inviting the challenges to become more difficult—with greatermysteries come greater revelations.In an age of faith, God showed his pleasure and displeasure in countless ways.Each believer monitored whether the deity was favoring them or not. Sickness,poverty, and misfortune were signs that God had turned his face away from you.Riches, happiness, and sunny days indicated that God’s light shone upon you. Butsince no one’s existence can be either one or the other, the deity seemed fickleand elusive. All manner of theories tried to explain why life brought a mixtureof pleasure and pain, but one thing was lacking: a steady assurance that humanbeings were favored in the universe.Spirituality is broader than any single religion. While one faith grappled withsin and another with karma, the wider wisdom didn’t look to God or any outsidepower. It looked inward, to consciousness. The fact that life has answers builtinto it gives us a clue to why Jesus emphasized living in the present:“Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself.Each day has enough trouble of its own” (Matthew 6:34). So that his listenerswouldn’t get stuck on the word “trouble,” Jesus had another teaching about howtroubles are to be met, quoted in Matthew 6:22: “Look at the birds of the air;they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Fatherfeeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?” In Buddhism the sameteaching is given more metaphysically: every question answers itself. So bygoing within, the very existence of a problem means that its solution exists.5. WITH EXPANDED AWARENESS, DESIRES CAN BE FULFILLED COMPLETELY.This principle tells us that spirituality brings more fulfillment, not less. Thepath unfolds through the expansion of life, which must follow once awarenessexpands. The two go together. You see more possibilities; you have less fear;when you act, your actions succeed, and thus success breeds success. All of thatcan sound quite foreign to traditional religious belief, where renunciation andtemptations of the flesh sound much more familiar. The conflict between worldlylife and spiritual life was a given for centuries.Everything depends on how you view your desires. If you see them as selfish,wrong, or sinful, then it’s only natural that God would disapprove, too. Whathappens isn’t a punishment delivered by the hand of God; rather, you cut offchannels of fulfillment. Desires that are judged against cause innerconflict—you want them to come true, but at the same time you don’t. When peoplesay, “I have to fight the urge,” they are expressing this conflict. The notionthat God, the soul, or the universe supports inner conflict is a drasticmistake. Conflict grows out of itself. As long as you are fighting a war withyour own desires, every day brings hope of winning the war and resignation overlosing it.If spirituality is about fulfilling your desires, however, new channels open up.There is a clear connection between wanting and receiving. I realize that manypeople will instantly object, “But what about bad desires? Are you saying thatthey don’t exist?” We all know that some desires, no matter how we label them,either work out beneficially or lead to setbacks and failure. The terms ofmorality don’t fly out the window when you follow spiritual principles. Youdevelop a finer sense of what is good and what isn’t. Good can be defined asbeing aligned with your spiritual purpose, so that your actions arelife-enhancing. Your desires are woven into your evolution. When thathappens—and it happens more and more as the process unfolds—then desire becomesthe path. This only makes sense, because you can’t evolve without wanting to,and a want is the same as a desire. The path that is the most successful in lifeis guided by desire.6. CHALLENGES ARE SOLVED BY RISING TO A LEVEL HIGHER THAN THE CHALLENGE.This principle reminds us of the main point in this book: the level of theproblem is never the level of the solution. When two parties are fighting, theyturn to a judge, because impartiality and detachment are a higher level ofawareness than combativeness and a refusal to budge. When a woman is strugglingwith issues of body image, telling her “You look fine,” or “How you look isn’tso important,” won’t help her; the solution is for her to find better ways tofeel worthy. When you value yourself for your ability to love, empathize, and becompassionate, it’s much harder to be obsessed by what you see in the mirror.Spiritually, there is a level that is the highest of all. This is the level oftranscendence. When you transcend, you release personal attachments. No longerstuck in old habits and conditioning, you ask for your highest awareness toenter the situation and find a solution. Transcending is more than simplyletting go. In practical terms, several other steps are involved: You step backfrom the problem and acknowledge that there is more than one way to look at it.You give up your claim to know the truth already. You open yourself to newpossibilities. You remove inner resistance to finding an answer; such resistancemight come in the form of anger, resentment, envy, stubbornness, or insecurity.Finally, you invite the answer to unfold any way that it wants to, which meansbeing alert to unexpected shifts and changes—your bitterest opponent maysuddenly agree with you, or long-held grievances may melt away.What makes transcendence viable isn’t blind faith. You are allowing a completeworldview to unfold through you. If you don’t feel that the earlier principlesare true, your higher self won’t sweep down on a magic carpet to solve yourproblems. But if you have dedicated yourself to the process of personal growthand the expansion of consciousness, then powers that once were hidden or blockedwill emerge. A famous quotation from the great German writer Goethe proclaims,“Be bold, and mighty forces will come to your aid.” Boldness is the ability tostep outside boundaries created by fear and insecurity. In other words, youtranscend your own limitations. No test of courage is required. As we willdiscuss, solving problems by rising to a level higher than the problem is one ofthe most practical and natural ways to achieve success in difficult situations.7. YOUR LIFE IS PART OF A SINGLE HUMAN DESTINY: ARRIVING AT UNITY CONSCIOUSNESS.This principle tells us about the underlying harmony of life. On the surface,differences predominate. Each of us is proud to be unique and different. Thecause of discord can be traced to the same factor, however. If “they” aredifferent from “us,” we have an automatic reason to feel estranged and perhapseven hostile to “them.” The wars and violent conflicts that never seem to ceaseare rooted in differences that led to irreconcilable hatred. But at a deeperlevel, spirituality holds that the clash of opposites—not just “us” versus“them” but also good versus evil, light versus darkness, my God versus yourGod—can be overcome.To find the harmony that lies deeper than differences is the primary goal ofspirituality. This is not a passive project, fueled by curiosity. Unity is thepurest state of awareness. As the eminent physicist Erwin Schrödinger asserted,“Consciousness is a singular that has no plural.” There is only oneconsciousness that you and I express in our unique ways. Our source lies insideeach of us, and the goal of every life, no matter how different it looks on thesurface from every other, is to reach the source. At that point there are nomore divisions, inner or outer. The state of unity has been reached.I realize that this may sound impossibly high-flown. If you are worried aboutthe mortgage or who your teenage daughter is dating or the threat of extremismin the world, unity consciousness seems to have zero relevance. But nothingcould be more relevant, because every spiritual solution comes to us from thelevel of unity. Things we call inspired, insightful, creative, intuitive, orrevelatory are messages from the source. In past ages the vocabulary of religionheld a virtual monopoly on how to think about unity consciousness; without God,the soul, or divine grace, there was no viable way to conceive of it.Which is why this book has been about practical solutions instead. Making thetrue self relevant to your life, here and now, is the only way that it can comealive. Outside the context of religion, every experience happens inconsciousness. If there is a reality beyond the human mind, we will neverdiscover it, since nothing is real until it enters our awareness. If the divineexists but has no contact with human beings, there is no basis for worship andfaith. Even though we no longer live in an age of faith, the divine can still beexperienced. To meet God isn’t like meeting another person, however exalted andawe-inspiring. To experience the divine is to experience the entire domain ofhigher consciousness, which is infinite. All of it is accessible. I am notasking for a leap of faith. There is no need to journey anywhere mystical. Theonly necessity is to open yourself to a worldview that begins with your trueself as the answer to the challenges that life brings. Since everyone faces suchchallenges, there is ample motivation to see if better solutions can be found.If anyone asks, “What is the spiritual solution?” in their particular situation,the best answer is “Seek for one, and you will know.” When the toughest problemsmeet the right answers, there is a deep meeting of the self with the self. Thisbook was written to make that meeting possible.[images/Chop_9780307719195_epub_L02_r1.jpg]THE ESSENCEConsciousness is designed to lead to solutions. All that is needed is to let itunfold naturally and spontaneously. The process is not passive. You mustparticipate in unblocking the flow of your own awareness.The main block is the “reality illusion” that traps you in limitations. We allbelieve in our reality illusion. We are uncomfortable with infinity and itsendless possibilities. By breaking down the reality illusion, you automaticallyexpand your awareness and life becomes much less of a struggle.The great secret that illusion hides from us is that we are always connected tothe true self, which exists at the level of the soul. The true self drivespersonal evolution. It sends messages through intuition, insight, andimagination. It arranges the best possible outcome for any situation. The closeryou come to the true self, the more you can rely completely on consciousness.[images/Chop_9780307719195_epub_L03_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"ACKNOWLEDGMENTSBefore I ever wrote my own books, I used to turn immediately to theacknowledgments in every book I picked up.
