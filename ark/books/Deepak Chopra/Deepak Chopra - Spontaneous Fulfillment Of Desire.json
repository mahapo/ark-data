Not just in remote country villages or at holy siteshalfway across the globe, but here, in our own lives. They bubble up from theirhidden source, surround us with opportunities, and disappear. They are theshooting stars of everyday life. When we see shooting stars, their rarity makesthem seem magical, but in fact, they streak across the sky all the time. We justdon’t notice them during the day, dazzled as we are by sunlight, and at nightthey emerge only if we happen to look up at the right place in a clear, darksky.Although we think of them as extraordinary, miracles also streak across ourconsciousness every day. We can choose to notice or ignore them, unaware thatour destinies may hang in the balance. Tune in to the presence of miracles, andin an instant, life can be transformed into a dazzling experience, more wondrousand exciting than we could even imagine. Ignore it, and an opportunity is goneforever. The question is, Would you recognize a miracle if you saw one? If yourecognized it, what would you do? And if you could somehow orchestrate your ownmiracles, which miracles would you choose?Beyond your physical self, beyond your thoughts and emotions, there lies a realmwithin you that is pure potential; from this place anything and everything ispossible. Even miracles. Especially miracles. This part of you is interwovenwith everything else that exists, and with everything yet to come. I havededicated my life to exploring and teaching ways to tap into this infinite fieldof possibilities so that we can redirect and improve our lives materially,emotionally, physically, and spiritually. In previous books I focused onspecific outcomes. For example, I’ve written extensively about attaining perfecthealth, finding the path to love, and discovering how to know God. This book waswritten with a broader goal—to guide you to a way of seeing the profound truththat lies behind the illusion of everyday life, and by doing so to discover yourtrue destiny—and how to shape it. This is the path to fulfillment, andeventually to enlightenment.For more than a decade I have been fascinated by the idea that coincidence isinvolved in guiding and shaping our lives. We have all experienced events thatmight be considered amazing or uncanny. Perhaps you were cleaning out a closetand found a gift from someone you hadn’t spoken with in years; then an hourlater, out of the blue, that person rings you on the phone. You might have reada newspaper article about an experimental skin cancer treatment, and for noapparent reason you decided to save that particular newspaper. A month later, arelative calls to say that he just received a diagnosis of skin cancer—and thatinformation in the article you saved influences his choices and ends up savinghis life. Or perhaps your car breaks down on the side of a deserted road, andjust when you had resigned yourself to being stranded for hours, the very firstvehicle that comes along is a tow truck.Can such moments be ascribed to mere coincidence? Of course they can, but oncloser examination they can also prove to be glimpses of the miraculous. Eachtime we have an experience like these, we can choose to dismiss it as a randomoccurrence in a chaotic world, or we can recognize it for the potentiallylife-altering event it may prove to be. I do not believe in meaninglesscoincidences. I believe every coincidence is a message, a clue about aparticular facet of our lives that requires our attention.Have you ever listened to that calm, quiet “little voice” deep inside you? Didyou ever get a “gut feeling” about something or someone? That little voice andthat gut feeling are forms of communication that usually turn out to be wellworth heeding. Coincidences are also a kind of message. By paying attention tolife’s coincidences, you can learn to hear their messages more clearly. And byunderstanding the forces that shape coincidences, you can come to influencethose forces and create your own set of meaningful coincidences, take advantageof the opportunities they present, and experience life as a constantly unfoldingmiracle that inspires awe in every moment.Most of us go through life a little afraid, a little nervous, a little excited.We are like children playing hide and seek, wanting to be found, yet hoping wewon’t be, biting our nails with anticipation. We worry when opportunityapproaches a little too closely, and hide deeper in the shadows when fearovercomes us. This is no way to go through life. People who understand the truenature of reality, those whom some traditions call enlightened, lose all senseof fear or concern. All worry disappears. Once you understand the way lifereally works—the flow of energy, information, and intelligence that directsevery moment—then you begin to see the amazing potential in that moment. Mundanethings just don’t bother you anymore. You become lighthearted and full of joy.You also begin to encounter more and more coincidences in your life.When you live your life with an appreciation of coincidences and their meanings,you connect with the underlying field of infinite possibilities. This is whenthe magic begins. This is a state I call synchrodestiny, in which it becomespossible to achieve the spontaneous fulfillment of our every desire.Synchrodestiny requires gaining access to a place deep within yourself, while atthe same time awakening to the intricate dance of coincidences out in thephysical world. It requires understanding the profound nature of things,recognizing the wellspring of intelligence that endlessly creates our universe,and yet having the intention to pursue specific opportunities for change as theyappear. Before we explore this theme in greater depth, let’s try a small experiment.Close your eyes and think about what you’ve been doing over the past twenty-fourhours. Then move backward through your memory from where you are right now towhere you were exactly one day ago. In your mind’s eye, conjure up as muchdetail as you can about the things you did, the thoughts that passed throughyour mind, and the feelings that affected your heart.As you do this, pick one theme or subject from the past twenty-four hours andfocus on that particular thought. It doesn’t have to be anything especiallyimportant or spectacular—just something that you remember dealing with duringthe day. If you went to the bank, you might choose money or finances. If you hada doctor’s appointment, you could choose health. If you played golf or tennis,you could focus on athletics. Consider this theme for a few seconds.Now, think back five years. Concentrate on today’s date, and then work back,year by year, until you reach the same date five years ago. See if you canrecall more or less where you were and what you were doing at that time. Try topicture your life at that moment as clearly as you can.Once you’ve created a clear mental image of your life as it was five years ago,introduce the theme or subject that you chose to focus on from the pasttwenty-four hours—finances, health, religion, whatever it was. Now, track yourinvolvement with that subject over the past five years and right up to thepresent. Try to remember as many incidents as you can in that particular area ofyour life. If you’ve chosen health as your topic, for example, you mightremember any illnesses you’ve had, how they might have led you from one doctorto another, how you may have decided to stop smoking and how that may haveaffected various areas of your life, or the diet you chose, or any of a thousandother possibilities. Go ahead and begin this exercise now.As you were thinking about your chosen subject, how it evolved in your life andhow it affects the way you live now, I’m certain you discovered many“coincidences.” So much of life depends on chance meetings, twists of fate, orpathways that suddenly branch out in a new direction. And it is likely that yourone topic very quickly connected with many other areas of your life, even if thesubject seemed totally insignificant at first. By tracing your personal historyin this way you can gain enormous insight into the role that coincidence hasplayed in your life. You can see how, if even one tiny detail had turned outdifferently, you might have ended up somewhere else, with different people,engaged in different work, moving on an entirely different life trajectory.Even when you think you have your life all mapped out, things happen that shapeyour destiny in ways you might never even have imagined. The coincidences orlittle miracles that happen every day of your life are hints that the universehas much bigger plans for you than you ever dreamed of for yourself. My life,which to others seems to be so well defined, is a perpetual surprise to me. Andmy past, too, is filled with remarkable coincidences that led me to become who Iam today.My father served in the Indian army as personal physician of Lord Mountbatten,the last Governor-General of the British Empire in India. While performing hisduties my father spent a great deal of time with Lady Mountbatten, and theybecame friends. Through this friendship my father was encouraged to apply for ascholarship to become a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, which tookhim away to England when I was about six years old. Soon after, my mother alsoleft India to join my father for a while, and my younger brother and I were leftin the care of our grandparents.One day, my father sent a telegram from England saying that he had finallypassed all his examinations. This was a momentous day for everyone. Mygrandfather, so proud of his accomplished son, took us out to celebrate. Therehad never been such an exciting day as this in our young lives! He took us tothe movies, and a carnival, and a family restaurant. He bought us toys andsweets. The whole day was a glorious whirlwind of happiness. But later thatnight, my brother and I were awakened by the sound of wailing. Although we didnot learn this immediately, my grandfather had died, and the sound that hadwoken us was the anguished cry of women in mourning. His body was taken away andcremated, and his ashes were scattered over the Ganges.This affected my brother and me profoundly. I lay awake nights wondering wheremy grandfather was, and whether his soul had survived in some way after hisdeath. My brother had a different reaction—his skin started peeling, as thoughfrom a bad sunburn. There was no physical reason for this, so we consultedseveral doctors. One wise physician recognized that the recent traumatic eventsin our lives may have left my brother feeling vulnerable and exposed, and thatpeeling skin was an outward sign of his vulnerability. He predicted that thepeeling would stop when my parents returned to India. And, indeed, when theyreturned, it disappeared.Looking back I can see that these early events were the seeds of my life’swork—my search to understand the nature of the soul, and my studies of themind-body connection in health. My chosen profession was one long series ofcoincidences that begins anywhere I choose to look, in this case with my fatherbefriending Lady Mountbatten.Other seemingly random events influenced me further. When I was in school, mybest friend was a young fellow called Oppo. He was very skillful with words. InEnglish class, whenever we had to write an essay, he always got the highestmarks. He was also great fun to spend time with. Whatever Oppo did, I wanted todo, too. When Oppo decided he wanted to pursue writing as a career, I made thesame choice.My father’s dream for me, however, was that I should become a physician. When wesat down to discuss it I told him, “No. I don’t want to be a doctor. I have nointerest in medicine. I want to be a great writer one day. I want to writebooks.” Not long after, on my fourteenth birthday, my father gave me some greatliterature to read, including Of Human Bondage by W. Somerset Maugham,Arrowsmith by Sinclair Lewis, and Magnificent Obsession by Lloyd C. Douglas.Although he didn’t mention it at the time, all these books are about doctors.And they made such a deep impression that they sparked in me a desire to becomeone myself.Becoming a physician seemed to me to be an ideal way to begin to explorespirituality. I thought that by unraveling the mysteries of the human body,perhaps I could someday get down to the level of the soul. If I had not metOppo, I might never have developed my love of literature and writing. And if myfather had acted differently, fighting me about my decision to be a writerinstead of encouraging me with literature about physicians, I might have becomea journalist. But these seemingly unrelated events and this web ofrelationships—from Lady Mountbatten, to my father, to my grandfather and mybrother, to Oppo—were synchronized with one another. It was as though aconspiracy of coincidences shaped my personal history and led me to the life Ienjoy so thoroughly today.Each of us is immersed in a network of coincidences that inspire us and helpdirect our lives. At this very moment, my destiny has led me to write this book,to commune with you through the words on this page. Just the fact that you arereading these words now—that you walked into the library or bookshop, found thisbook, chose to open the cover, and are investing time and energy to learn aboutsynchrodestiny—is one of those potentially life-altering coincidences. Whatcircumstances brought you to this book? How did you choose this book over thethousands of others? What changes did you think you might like to make in yourlife as you read through the opening paragraphs?Seeing the web of coincidence in our lives, however, is just the first stage inunderstanding and living synchrodestiny. The next stage is to develop anawareness of coincidences while they are happening. It is easy to see them inhindsight, but if you catch coincidences at the moment they occur, you arebetter positioned to take advantage of the opportunities they may be presenting.Also, awareness translates into energy. The more attention you give tocoincidences, the more likely they are to appear, which means you begin to gaingreater and greater access to the messages being sent to you about the path anddirection of your life.The final stage of living synchrodestiny occurs when you become fully aware ofthe interrelatedness of all things, how each affects the next, how they all are“in sync” with one another. “In sync” is a colloquial way of saying “insynchrony,” which means operating in unison, as one. Picture a school of fishswimming in one direction, and then in a flash, all the fish change direction.There is no leader giving directions. The fish don’t think, “The fish in frontof me turned left, so I should turn left.” It all happens simultaneously. Thissynchrony is choreographed by a great, pervasive intelligence that lies at theheart of nature, and is manifest in each of us through what we call the soul.When we learn to live from the level of the soul, many things happen. We becomeaware of the exquisite patterns and synchronous rhythms that govern all life. Weunderstand the lifetimes of memory and experience that have molded us into thepeople we are today. Fearfulness and anxiety fall away as we stand in wonderobserving the world as it unfolds. We notice the web of coincidence thatsurrounds us, and we realize that there is meaning in even the smallest events.We discover that by applying attention and intention to these coincidences, wecan create specific outcomes in our lives. We connect with everyone andeverything in the universe, and recognize the spirit that unites us all. Weunveil the wondrousness that is hidden deep inside us and revel in our newfoundglory. We consciously shape our destinies into the limitlessly creativeexpressions they were meant to be, and by doing so we live out our most profounddreams, moving closer to enlightenment.This is the miracle of synchrodestiny. The pages ahead are divided in two sections. The first explores the workingdynamics of coincidence, synchronicity, and synchrodestiny; it answers thequestion “How does this work?” The second section covers the seven principles ofsynchrodestiny, along with day-by-day plans for using what you learn; it answersthe question “What does this mean for me?”Those of you who are strongly goal oriented or have read all my past books maybe tempted to skip right to the lessons, but there are nuances to the discussionhere, along with additional information and focused observations, that you’llwant to understand before proceeding. Also, please note that over the past tenyears the concept of synchrodestiny has evolved, and it continues to do so. Youmay have attended a synchrodestiny course or listened to tapes in the past, butregard this volume as both Synchrodestiny I, an introduction to the subject, andSynchrodestiny II, a more advanced and clearer understanding of this phenomenon,both as a theory and as an experience.For those of you reading this fresh, with no past experience of my work, Iencourage you not to lose momentum. I have tried hard to make this book my mostaccessible to date, and I hope I have succeeded. However, we do grapple withsome profound questions, and at times you may feel as though you’ll never “getit” all. You will. Try not to get stuck in any one paragraph, or page. Eachchapter builds upon the last, and readers usually find that later chaptersclarify points that may have been less obvious at first encounter. We have twogoals here; one is to understand how synchrodestiny works; the other is to learnspecific techniques for harnessing its power to our everyday lives.This book will not change your life overnight, but if you are willing to devotea little time every day, you will find that miracles are not only possible, theyare abundant. Miracles can happen every day, every hour, every minute of yourlife. At this moment, the seeds of a perfect destiny lie dormant within you.Release their potential and live a life more wondrous than any dream. Let meshow you how."},{"pageContent":"image [../images/00002.jpeg]"},{"pageContent":"1image [../images/00003.jpeg]Matter, Mind, and SpiritFrom the moment we become aware of the world around us, we begin to wonder aboutour place within it. The questions we ask are timeless: Why am I here? How do Ifit into the scheme of things? What is my destiny? As children, we tend to thinkof the future as a clean sheet of paper upon which we can write our own stories.The possibilities seem endless, and we are energized by the promise of discoveryand the sheer pleasure of living immersed in so much potential. But as we growup, become adults, and are “educated” about our limitations, our view of thefuture becomes constricted. What once lifted our imaginations now weighs us downwith dread and anxiety. What once felt boundless becomes narrow and dark.There is a way to regain the soaring joy of unlimited potential. All that isrequired is an understanding of the true nature of reality, a willingness torecognize the interrelatedness and inseparability of all things. Then, aided byspecific techniques, you will find the world opening up to you, and the goodluck and opportunities that popped up every once in a while will occur more andmore frequently. How powerful is synchrodestiny? Imagine for a moment that youfind yourself with a flashlight in your hand in a room that is totally dark. Youturn on the flashlight and see a beautiful painting hanging on the wall. Youmight think, “Sure, this is a wonderful work of art, but is this all there is?”Then, all at once, the room becomes illuminated from above. You look around andsee that you are in an art museum, with hundreds of paintings on the wallsaround you, each more beautiful than the last. As these possibilities standrevealed to you, you realize you have a lifetime of art to study and love. Youare no longer constrained to view just one painting lit by the weak glow of yourflashlight.This is the promise of synchrodestiny. It turns on the lights. It gives us theability to make real decisions instead of blind guesses as we move forward inour lives. It allows us to see meaning in the world, to understand theconnectedness or synchronicity of all things, to choose the kind of life we wantto live, and to fulfill our spiritual journey. With synchrodestiny, we gain theability to transform our lives according to our intentions.The first step to living this way is to understand the nature of the threelevels of existence.Level 1:THE PHYSICAL DOMAINThe first level of existence is physical or material, the visible universe. Thisis the world we know best, what we call the real world. It contains matter andobjects with firm boundaries, everything that is three-dimensional, and itincludes everything we experience with our five senses—all that we can see,hear, feel, taste, or smell. It includes our bodies, the wind, the earth, water,gases, animals, microbes, molecules, and the pages of this book. In the physicaldomain time seems to flow in a line so straight that we call it the arrow oftime, from the past to the present to the future. This means that everything inthe physical domain has a beginning, a middle, and an end, and is thereforeimpermanent. Sentient beings are born and die. Mountains soar from the moltencore of the earth and are brought low again by the relentless scouring of rainand wind.The physical world as we experience it is governed by immutable laws of causeand effect, so that everything is predictable. Newtonian physics allows us topredict action and reaction, so that when billiard balls hit each other with aparticular speed and at a particular angle, we can anticipate exactly what routeeach will travel across the billiards table. Scientists can calculate preciselywhen a solar eclipse will occur and how long it will last. All of our“commonsense” understanding of the world comes from what we know of thisphysical domain.Level 2:THE QUANTUM DOMAINAt the second level of existence everything consists of information and energy.This is called the quantum domain. Everything at this level is insubstantial,meaning that it cannot be touched or perceived by any of the five senses. Yourmind, your thoughts, your ego, the part of you that you typically think of asyour “self” are all part of the quantum domain. These things have no solidity,and yet you know your self and your thoughts to be real. Although it is easiestto think of the quantum domain in terms of mind, it encompasses much more. Infact, everything in the visible universe is a manifestation of the energy andinformation of the quantum domain. The material world is a subset of the quantumworld.Another way of stating this is that everything in the physical domain is made upof information and energy. In Einstein’s famous equation, E = MC2, we learn thatenergy (E) equals mass (M) times the speed of light (C) squared. This tells usthat matter (mass) and energy are the same thing only in different forms—energyequals mass.One of the first science lessons taught in school is that every solid object ismade up of molecules, and molecules are made up of even smaller units calledatoms. We come to understand that this seemingly solid chair we are sitting onis made up of atoms so small that they cannot be seen without the aid of apowerful microscope. Later in the lesson we learn that tiny atoms are made up ofsubatomic particles, which have no solidity at all. They are, quite literally,packets or waves of information and energy. This means that, at this secondlevel of existence, the chair you are sitting in is nothing but energy andinformation.This concept can be difficult to grasp at first. How can invisible waves ofenergy and information be experienced as a solid object? The answer is thatevents in the quantum domain occur at the speed of light, and at that speed oursenses simply cannot process everything that contributes to our perceptualexperience. We perceive objects as being different from one to the next becauseenergy waves contain different kinds of information, which are determined by thefrequency or vibration of those energy waves. It’s like listening to the radio.A radio tuned to one station, say 101.5 FM, might play only classical music.Change to a slightly different frequency of radio waves by tuning in to, say,101.9 FM, and you might hear only rock and roll. Energy is coded for differentinformation depending on how it vibrates.So the physical world, the world of objects and matter, is made up of nothingbut information contained in energy vibrating at different frequencies. Thereason we don’t see the world as a huge web of energy is that it is vibratingfar too fast. Our senses, because they function so slowly, are able to registeronly chunks of this energy and activity, and these clusters of informationbecome “the chair,” “my body,” “water,” and every other physical object in thevisible universe.This is similar to what happens when we watch a movie. As you know, a motionpicture is made up of individual photographic frames with gaps in betweenframes. If you looked at a movie film on the reel in a projection room, youwould see the individual frames and gaps. But when we watch the movie itself,the frames are strung together and played back so fast that our senses no longerobserve the frames as discontinuous. Instead, we perceive a steady stream ofinformation.At the quantum level, the various chunks of energy fields vibrating at differentfrequencies that we perceive as solid objects are all part of a collectiveenergy field. If we were capable of perceiving everything that was happening atthe quantum level, we would see that we are all part of a great “energy soup,”and everything—each one of us and all the objects in the physical domain—is justa cluster of energy floating in this energy soup. At any given moment yourenergy field will come into contact with and affect everyone else’s energyfield, and each of us responds in some way to that experience. We are allexpressions of this communal energy and information. Sometimes we can actuallyfeel this connectedness. This sensation is usually very subtle, but on occasionit becomes more tangible. Most of us have had the experience of walking into aroom and sensing “tension so thick you could cut it with a knife,” or of beingin a church or holy shrine and being engulfed by a sense of peace. That is thecollective energy of the environment mingling with your own energy, which youregister on some level.In the physical domain we are also constantly exchanging energy and information.Imagine that you are standing on the street and you smell cigarette smoke fromsomeone walking a block away. This means you are inhaling the breath of thatperson about one hundred yards away. The smell is just a tracer notifying youthat you are inhaling someone else’s breath. If the tracer wasn’t there, if theperson walking by wasn’t smoking, you would still be inhaling that person’sbreath; you just wouldn’t know it without cigarette smoke to alert you. And whatis breath? It is the carbon dioxide and oxygen that come from the metabolism ofevery cell in that stranger’s body. That is what you are inhaling, just as otherpeople are inhaling your breath. So we are all constantly exchanging bits ofourselves—physical, measurable molecules from our bodies. At a deeper level, there is really no boundary between our selves and everythingelse in the world. When you touch an object, it feels solid, as though there wasa distinct boundary between it and you. Physicists would say that we experiencethat boundary as solid because everything is made up of atoms, and the solidityis the sense of atoms bumping against atoms. But consider what an atom is. Anatom has a little nucleus with a large cloud of electrons around it. There is norigid outer shell, just an electron cloud. To visualize this, imagine a peanutin the middle of a football stadium. The peanut represents the nucleus, and thestadium represents the size of the electron cloud around the nucleus. When wetouch an object, we perceive solidity when the clouds of electrons meet. That isour interpretation of solidity, given the sensitivity (or relativeinsensitivity) of our senses. Our eyes are programmed to see objects asthree-dimensional and solid. Our nerve endings are programmed to feel objects asthree-dimensional and solid. In the reality of the quantum domain, however,there is no solidity. Is there solidity when two clouds meet? No. They meld andseparate. Something similar happens whenever you touch another object. Yourenergy fields (and electron clouds) meet, small portions meld, and then youseparate. Although you perceive yourself to be whole, you have lost a bit ofyour energy field to the object, and have gained a bit of its energy field inreturn. With every encounter, we exchange information and energy, and we comeaway changed just a little bit. In this way, too, we can see how connected weare to everything else in the physical world. We are all constantly sharingportions of our energy fields, so all of us, at this quantum level, at the levelof our minds and our “selves,” are all connected. We are all correlated with oneanother.So it is only in our consciousness that our limited senses create a solid worldout of pure energy and information. But what if we could see into the quantumdomain—if we had “quantum eyes”? In the quantum domain, we would see thateverything we think of as solid in the physical world is actually flickering inand out of an infinite void at the speed of light. Just like the frame-and-gapsequence of a motion picture, the universe is an on-off phenomenon. Thecontinuity and solidity of the world exists only in the imagination, fed bysenses that cannot discern the waves of energy and information that make up thequantum level of existence. In reality, we are all flickering in and out ofexistence all the time. If we could fine-tune our senses, we could actually seethe gaps in our existence. We are here, and then not here, and then here again.The sense of continuity is held only by our memories.There is an analogy that illustrates this point. Scientists know that it takes asnail about three seconds to register light. So imagine that a snail waswatching me, and that I left the room, robbed a bank, and came back in threeseconds. As far as the snail was concerned, I never left the room. I could takeher to court and she would provide a perfect alibi. For the snail, the time thatI was gone from the room would fall into one of those gaps between the frames offlickering existence. Her sense of continuity, assuming snails have one, wouldsimply not register the gap.So the sensory experience of all living beings is a purely artificial perceptualconstruct created in the imagination. There is a Zen story in which two monksare looking at a flag that is waving in the wind. The first one says, “The flagis waving.” The second one says, “No, the wind is moving.” Their teacher comesover and they pose him the question. “Who’s right? I say the flag is moving. Hesays the wind is moving.” The teacher says, “You are both wrong. Onlyconsciousness is moving.” As consciousness moves, it imagines the world intoexistence.So the mind is a field of energy and information. Every idea is also energy andinformation. You have imagined your physical body and the whole physical worldinto existence by perceiving energy soup as distinct physical entities. Butwhere does the mind responsible for this imagination come from?Level 3:THE NONLOCAL DOMAINThe third level of existence consists of intelligence, or consciousness. Thiscan be called the virtual domain, the spiritual domain, the field of potential,the universal being, or nonlocal intelligence. This is where information andenergy emerge from a sea of possibilities. The most fundamental, basic level ofnature is not material; it is not even energy and information soup; it is purepotential. This level of nonlocal reality operates beyond the reach of space andtime, which simply do not exist at this level. We call it nonlocal because itcannot be confined by a location—it is not “in” you or “out there.” It simplyis.The intelligence of the spiritual domain is what organizes “energy soup” intoknowable entities. It is what binds quantum particles into atoms, atoms intomolecules, molecules into structures. It is the organizing force behind allthings. This can be a slippery concept to grasp. One relatively simple way ofthinking about this virtual domain is to recognize the dual nature of your ownthoughts. As you read these words, your eyes are seeing the black print on thepage, and your mind is translating the print into symbols—letters and words—andthen trying to deduce their meaning. But take a step back and ask, Who is itthat is doing the reading? What is the consciousness that underlies yourthoughts? Become aware of the duality of these interior processes. Your mind isbusy decoding, analyzing, and translating. So who is doing the reading? Withthis one little twist of attention you may become aware that there is a presencewithin you, a force that is always doing the experiencing. This is the soul, ornonlocal intelligence, and its experience takes place at the virtual level.Just as information and energy forge the physical world, this nonlocal domain(“without location”) creates and orchestrates the activity of information andenergy. According to best-selling author and metaphysical pioneer Larry Dossey,M.D., nonlocal events have three important qualities that distinguish them fromevents confined to the physical world: They are correlated, and this correlationis unmediated, unmitigated, and immediate. Let’s briefly explore what he meansby this.The behavior of two or more subatomic events is acausally interrelated, meaningthat “one event is not the cause of another event, yet the behavior of one isimmediately correlated or coordinated with the other.” In other words, they seemto be dancing to the same tune, even though they are not communicating with eachother in the conventional sense. This is the meaning of unmediated.The correlation between these nonlocal events is also unmitigated, which meansthat the strength of the correlation remains undiminished with distance in spaceand time. For example, if you and I were in a room talking, my voice would soundvery different than if we were standing across the street from each other. Atthat greater distance my voice would sound much weaker, if you could hear me atall. If you were in the nonlocal domain, I would be heard clearly, regardless ofwhether I was standing right next to you, across the street, a mile away, oreven on another continent.Third, immediate means that no travel time is needed for nonlocal events. We areall familiar with the fact that light and sound travel at different speeds,which is why we see lightning in the distance before we hear the rumble ofthunder. With nonlocal events there is no such lag time, because nonlocalcorrelations do not follow the laws of classical physics. There is no signal,there is no light, and there is no sound. There is no “thing” that has totravel. Correlations between events that occur at the nonlocal or virtual leveloccur instantly, without cause, and without any weakening over time or distance.Nonlocal intelligence is everywhere at once, and can cause multiple effectssimultaneously in various locations. It is from this virtual domain thateverything in the world is organized and synchronized. This, then, is the sourceof the coincidences that are so important to synchrodestiny. When you learn tolive from this level, you can spontaneously fulfill your every desire. You cancreate miracles.EVIDENCE FOR THEVIRTUAL DOMAINThe virtual domain is not a figment of the imagination, the result of some humanlonging for a universal force greater than ourselves. Although philosophers havebeen discussing and debating the existence of “spirit” for thousands of years,it wasn’t until the twentieth century that science could offer proof of theexistence of nonlocal intelligence. Although the following discussion issomewhat involved, if you read it through to the end, I hope you will be filledwith the same sense of wonder and excitement that I felt when I first learned ofthis work.As most of us learned in science class, the universe is made up of both solidparticles and waves. We were taught that particles were the building blocks ofall the solid objects in the world. For example, we learned that the verysmallest units of matter, such as the electrons in an atom, were particles.Similarly, we were taught that waves—such as sound and light waves—werenonsolid. There was never confusion between the two; particles were particles,and waves were waves.Physicists then discovered that a subatomic particle is part of what is known asa wave packet. Although waves of energy are typically continuous, with equallyspaced peaks and troughs, a wave packet is a concentration of energy. (Imagine alittle ball of static, with quick, sharp peaks and troughs representing theamplitude of the wave.)image [../images/00004.jpeg]There are two questions we might ask about the particle in this wave packet: (1)Where is it, and (2) what is its momentum? Physicists discovered that you canask one of these questions, but not both. For example, once you ask “Where isit?” and you fix a wave-particle in a location, it becomes a particle. If youask “What is its momentum?” you have decided that movement is the criticalfactor; therefore you must be talking about a wave.So is this thing we are talking about, the “wave-particle,” a particle or awave? It depends on which of the two questions we decide to ask. At any givenmoment, that wave-particle can be either a particle or a wave because we can’tknow both the location and the momentum of the wave-particle. In fact, as itturns out, until we measure either its location or its momentum, it is bothparticle and wave simultaneously. This concept is known as the HeisenbergUncertainty Principle, and it is one of the fundamental building blocks ofmodern physics.Imagine a closed box with a wave-particle in it. Its absolute identity is notfixed until it is observed or measured in some way. At the moment beforeobservation, its identity is pure potential. It is both wave and particle, andit exists only in the virtual domain. After observation or measurement takesplace, the potential “collapses” into a single entity—either particle or wave.Given our usual, sense-based way of evaluating the world, the idea that a thingcan exist in more than one state at the same time is totally counterintuitive.But this is the wonder of the quantum world.A famous thought experiment by physicist Erwin Schrödinger points out the kindsof odd occurrences that are made possible by quantum physics. Imagine that youhave a closed box that contains a wave-particle, a cat, a lever, and a bowl ofcat food with a loose lid. If the wave-particle becomes a particle, it will tripthe lever, which will flip the lid off the bowl of food, and the cat will eat.If the wave-particle becomes a wave, the lid stays on the food. If we open thebox (thereby making an observation), we will see either an empty bowl of catfood (and a happy cat) or a full bowl (and a hungry cat). It all depends on thetype of observation we make. Now here’s the part that boggles the mind: Beforewe look in the box and make an observation, the bowl is both empty and full, andthe cat is simultaneously fed and hungry. At that moment, both possibilitiesexist at the same time. It is the observation alone that turns possibility intoreality. As remarkable as this might seem, physicists recently completed anexperiment proving this phenomenon by demonstrating that a charged, unobservedberyllium atom was capable of being in two separate locations at the same time! Perhaps even more mind-boggling is the notion that the very idea of two separatelocations may be a perceptual artifact. In other words, two correlated events intwo different locations might in fact be the movements of a single event.Imagine a single fish in a tank, with two video cameras recording its movements.The two cameras are at right angles to each other and project their respectiveimages to two separate video screens in another room. You are sitting in thisroom looking at both screens. You see two different fish and you are amazed whenone fish turns or moves in a certain direction and its behavior is immediatelycorrelated with the behavior of the other fish. Of course you do not know whatis happening behind the scenes. If you did, you would see that there is only onefish! If we placed many different cameras at many different angles, andprojected these images to different screens in the same room, you would beamazed that all these different fish are in instant communicational correlationwith one another.Great seers from mystical traditions suggest that what we experience every dayis a projected reality where events and things only “appear” to be separate inspace and time. In the deeper realm we are all members of the same body, andwhen one part of the body moves, every single part of that body is instantlyaffected.Scientists also propose a level of existence called Minkowski’seight-dimensional hyperspace. In this mathematically conceived dimension thedistance between two events, no matter how separate they appear to be inspace-time, is always zero. This once again suggests a dimension of existencewhere we are all inseparably one. Separation may just be an illusion. When wefeel love in any form, it has the effect of beginning to shatter that illusion.Because observation is the key to defining the wave-particle as a single entity,Niels Bohr and other physicists believed that consciousness alone wasresponsible for the collapse of the wave-particle. It might be said, then, thatwithout consciousness, everything would exist only as undefined, potentialpackets of energy, or pure potential.This is one of the key points of this book. Let me repeat it because it is soimportant: Without consciousness acting as an observer and interpreter,everything would exist only as pure potential. That pure potential is thevirtual domain, the third level of existence. It is nonlocal and can’t bedepleted; it is unending and all-encompassing. Tapping into that potential iswhat allows us to make miracles.Miracles is not too strong a word. Let me return to physics to describe howscientists have documented some of the astounding events that can occur fromthis level of potential.Intrigued and troubled by the possibilities suggested by quantum physics, AlbertEinstein devised his own thought experiment: Imagine creating two identicalwave-particles that are then shot off in opposite directions. What happens if weask about the location of wave-particle A and ask about the momentum ofwave-particle B? Remember, the particles are identical, so whatever measurementis calculated for one will, by definition, hold true for the other. Knowing thelocation of wave-particle A (and thus collapsing it into a particle)simultaneously tells us the location of wave-particle B, and therefore alsocollapses it into a particle.The implications of this thought experiment (which has been confirmedmathematically as well as experimentally) are enormous. If observingwave-particle A affects wave-particle B, that means that some nonlocalconnection or communication is occurring in which information is exchangedfaster than the speed of light, without the exchange of energy. That is contraryto every commonsense view of the world. This thought experiment is known as theEinstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox. And indeed, laboratory experiments have shownthat the laws of quantum physics do hold up, and that nonlocal communication orconnection is a reality.Let me try to illustrate the magnitude of this point with an example that is abit of an exaggeration, but at least it takes place in the physical world so itseffects are easier to see. Imagine that a company simultaneously sends out twoidentical packages, one to me in California, and one to you at your home. Ineach of the boxes is a correlated, unobserved wave-particle, pure potential. Youand I receive and open our packages at exactly the same moment. Just before Icut the tape and open the flaps, I create a mental picture of what I want thebox to contain. When I open the box, I find that it contains just what Iimagined, a violin. But that’s only half the miracle. When you open your box, italso contains a violin! When I imagined what I wanted the box to contain, thewave-particles collapsed into a specific form. And whatever I imagined alsoaffected the wave-particles in your package. We could repeat this experimentover and over again, and we’d always have the same outcome: Whatever I imaginefor myself is matched, at the exact same moment, for you. Not only can Iinfluence the form of one set of wave-particles, but the wave-particles aresomehow able to communicate the form they are taking across the distance from myhouse to yours, faster than the speed of light. This is what is meant bynonlocal communication or correlation. Interesting experiments have been performed by researcher Cleve Baxter, anassociate and friend of ours at the Chopra Center. In 1972 he developed amethodology for studying human cells that had been isolated from a person’sbody. For example, in one of his experiments, he took human spermatozoa andstudied them in a test tube by electroding them and measuring theirelectromagnetic activity using EEG-type instrumentation. The sperm donor waslocated in a room about forty feet down the hall from the lab. When the spermdonor crushed a capsule of amyl nitrate and inhaled the fumes there was aninstantaneous spike in the electromagnetic activity of the lab sperm three roomsaway.One day Cleve Baxter was isolating white cells in order to study them, and avery interesting thing happened. As part of the procedure he centrifuged hissaliva to get a concentrated number of white cells, then placed them in a smalltest tube and inserted gold wire electrodes connected to EEG-typeinstrumentation. He had the sudden idea to inflict a small cut on the back ofhis hand to see if this might affect his white cells. He went to search for asterile lancet on a nearby shelf. When he came back he glanced at the chart thatwas recording the electromagnetic activity of the white blood cells: It hadalready registered intense activity among the white blood cells during hissearch for the lancet. In other words, his white cells were reacting to hisintention to cut his hand even before he actually inflicted the cut.On another occasion Cleve Baxter was training a colleague of his to collect oralleukocytes. Somehow they got into a discussion about an article in Playboymagazine, an interview with William Shockley, a scientist who was verycontroversial at the time. Cleve Baxter suddenly remembered that his partner hada copy of that particular issue of the magazine in his office desk. He dashedoff, found the issue under discussion, and brought it up to the lab. By thistime, Steve, his lab associate, had finished the cell collection and hadelectroded his cells. Cleve Baxter then aimed one video camera, mounted on atripod, over Steve’s shoulder to allow for later correlation of what Steve wouldbe viewing. Another video camera was mounted over the chart recording inprogress. The two video camera images were then combined through split-screentechnology. This ensured that there would be an accurate record of the timing ofpossible reactions. As Steve leafed through the Playboy magazine to find thearticle, he came across the centerfold featuring Bo Derek in her nothingness.According to Cleve Baxter, “Even as Steve said aloud ‘I don’t think she’s aten,’ his white cells in the test tube showed a full-scale reaction, hitting thetop and bottom limit stops on the chart recorder.” After two full minutes ofcontinuous reactivity, Cleve Baxter suggested that Steve close the magazine.When he did so his electroded cells calmed down. Then, a minute later, whenSteve reached over to reopen the closed magazine, the cells spiked again. CleveBaxter states, “When Steve experienced this high-quality observation, knowingthe feelings and thoughts of his own mind, it put an end to any skepticism.”Cleve Baxter has performed many similar experiments revealing that the cells ofall biological organisms, including plants and a variety of bacteria, havebiocommunication ability. All living cells have a cellular consciousness and areable to communicate with other cells of the same or other species even when theyare a distance apart. Moreover, this communication is instantaneous. Sincedistance in space is also distance in time, one could therefore say that eventsseparated from each other in time, occurring either in the past or in thefuture, could be instantly correlated.In an extension of this research, nonlocal communication has been demonstratedin people, too. In the famous Grinberg-Zylberbaum experiment, published in 1987,scientists used a device known as an electroencephalograph to measure the brainwaves of two people meditating together. They found that some pairs of peoplethey measured showed a strong correlation in their brain wave patterns,suggesting a close bond or mental relationship. These meditators could identifywhen they felt that they were in “direct communication” with each other, andthis was confirmed by the machines measuring their brain waves. These stronglybonded pairs were asked to meditate together, side by side, for twenty minutes.Then one of the meditators was taken to a different room that was closed andisolated. With each person in a separate room, the meditators were asked to tryto establish direct communication with each other. The meditator who had beenmoved was then stimulated by bright lights flashing in the room, which causedlittle spikes in his brain waves called evoked potentials. Because the brainwaves of both meditators were still being measured, the scientists were able tosee that the meditator who was exposed to light did, indeed, show the littlespikes of evoked potentials. But the fascinating part of this experiment is thatthe meditator who was not exposed to the light also showed little spikes ofbrain waves that corresponded to the evoked potentials of the light-exposedmeditator. So these two people were connected at a deep level (via meditation),and that connection allowed for measurable physical reactions even in the personwho was not exposed to the light stimulation. What happened to one person alsohappened to the other, automatically and instantly.These results cannot be explained by any means except nonlocal correlation,which occurs in the virtual domain, the level of the spirit that connects,orchestrates, and synchronizes everything. This boundless field of intelligenceor consciousness is everywhere, manifesting itself in everything. We’ve seen itoperate at the level of the subatomic particle—the building block of allthings—and we’ve seen it connect two people at a level that transcendsseparation. But you need not go into a laboratory to see this nonlocalintelligence at work. Proof is all around us, in animals, in nature, and even inour own bodies."},{"pageContent":"2image [../images/00003.jpeg]Synchronicity in NatureWe see examples of synchronicity in nature so often that they begin to seemordinary. But look again with eyes that are tuned in to the near-impossibilityof what’s taking place, and the concept of synchronicity will begin to makesense. For example, look up at the sky on any summer’s day and wait for a flockof birds. Like the school of fish I mentioned earlier, they all seem to bemoving in formation; when they change direction, they all execute the samemotions synchronistically. A single flock of birds can include hundreds ofindividuals, yet each bird moves in harmony with every other bird without anobvious leader. They change direction in an instant, all birds altering theircourse at the exact same moment, and they do it perfectly. You never see birdsbumping into each other in flight. They climb and turn and swoop so that theylook like a single organism, as if some unspoken command was issued that theyall obeyed at once. How is that happening? There’s not enough time for anyexchange of information, so any correlation of activity among the birds must behappening nonlocally.Physicists have been working for years to discover the properties that guide themovements of birds, and so far they have been unsuccessful. The complexity andabsolute precision of the birds’ behavior stumps physical science every time.Engineers have been studying the movements of birds to see if there is a way todiscover principles that might translate into solutions for traffic jams. Ifthey could somehow harness the sensory mechanism used by birds and translate itinto guidelines for road or car design, then there might never be another caraccident. We would know in advance what every other car on the road was going todo at every moment. This project will never succeed, however, because there isno analogy that can be brought to the mechanical world. The instantaneouscommunication we commonly see in flocks of birds and schools of fish comes fromthe spiritual level, the organizing nonlocal intelligence in the virtual domain.The result is synchronicity, beings that are totally in tune with theirenvironment and with each other, dancing to the rhythm of the cosmos.Although birds and fish provide the most striking example of synchronicity innature, there are as many examples as there are creatures on earth. All socialcreatures show evidence of nonlocal communication, and extensive studies havebeen conducted with insects and herd animals showing that their responses tothreats are immediate, quicker than could be explained by normal communicationmethods.Scientist Rupert Sheldrake has conducted some fascinating studies of what seemto be cases of nonlocal communication between dogs and their human companions.People and dogs can form very close bonds, and Sheldrake has documented cases inwhich dogs seem to know when their owners are coming home. From ten minutes totwo hours before the owner arrives, the dog will sit at the front door and wait,as if anticipating the owner’s return. Skeptics have said that this was simply acase of habit, that the owner comes home at a specific time each day, or thatthe dog can hear the car or smell the owner from miles away. But these dogs areable to predict their owners’ arrival even when he or she comes home atunexpected times, or by a different car, or on foot, or even if the wind isblowing in the opposite direction, so that there is no possible way the owner’sscent could reach the house.This doesn’t happen with all dogs or all owners, but when it does, it is a verypowerful phenomenon. Even more startling, Sheldrake has demonstrated that dogscan pick up on intention. Let’s say the owner is in Paris on a two-weekvacation, and the dog is at home in London. If the owner suddenly changes plansand decides to go home a week early, the dog shows the same signs ofanticipation a week early. As soon as the owner thinks, “It’s time to go home,”the dog gets up from wherever he has been sleeping and sits at the front doorwagging his tail, waiting for the owner’s arrival.To make sure that these observations weren’t just a matter of wishful thinkingon the owners’ part, studies looked at how specific dogs reacted to theirowners’ intentions to come home. Video cameras were set up in the house andfocused on places the dog was likely to be—his bed, the front door, the kitchen.The owner would go out with no idea of where she was going or when she wouldreturn home; that determination was made by the scientists. Only after she gotinto her car was she given instructions about where to go. Later, at randomtimes, a scientist would page the dog’s owner to signal that it was time tostart home. The time was noted and compared to the actions of the dog on thevideotapes. As the owner started for home, the dog would almost always go to thedoor and await her return, regardless of where she was, or what time it was, orhow long it would be until she actually arrived home.There’s no doubt that certain people have a very strong connection with theirdogs; they are correlated with their dogs. They are synchronized. And throughthis bond the owner and dog experience nonlocal communication.Examples of synchronicity can be found most often in the animal world becauseanimals are more in touch with the essential nature of things. We humans loseour sense of connectedness in a welter of concerns about rent payments, whichcar to buy, or any of a million other distractions. As soon as we develop anego, a sense of “I” that is different from everyone else, those connections areobscured.But some people do experience strong synchronicity, and they don’t need to bemeditators. We’ve all heard stories of identical twins who can readily tune into what the other twin is feeling or thinking. This same kind of connection canbe seen in other strongly bonded individuals. I was talking with a patient oncewhen he suddenly had a piercing pain in his abdomen and began rolling around onthe floor. When I asked what happened, he replied, “It feels like somebodystabbed me over here.” Later we found out that at that precise moment his motherhad been mugged in Philadelphia and stabbed in the abdomen. He had a very strongconnection to his mother; it was easily the most important relationship in hislife. They were so closely attuned that, at some level, their physiology was asone. We could say that they were entrained.Entrainment is just another word for correlation or synchronization; it is usedmost often by scientists to describe the state of being “caught up” by anothersubstance or force. For example, particles can be entrained in a stream ofliquid and flow along immersed in it. The word helps us describe how thingsbecome correlated with each other. Remember, synchronicity occurs only whenpeople, animals, or objects have some close relationship, or are entrained.In one example of entrainment, field researchers have observed African tribes inwhich mothers have very close relationships with their children, starting withtheir unborn babies. At the moment of conception, the mother will choose a nameand then write a song for her baby. She sings this song throughout pregnancy,while the baby is still in the womb. When the baby is being delivered, all theneighbors come and they sing the song for the baby, too. Later, at everyimportant milestone, they’ll sing that baby’s song: on birthdays, at theinitiation when the baby becomes a young child, during puberty rites, at theengagement and wedding. The song becomes the anchor for the original bondbetween mother and baby, and even extends beyond death, when the song is sung atthe person’s funeral. This is one way the child is entrained into the world ofthe mother and the tribe. It creates such an intimate connection that if thebaby is somewhere in the bushes and the mother is out in the fields, if the babyfeels discomfort of any kind, the mother will experience the same discomfort inher body at that very moment.Another well-known example of nonlocal communication between mother and child isthe leakage of breast milk when the child cries out with hunger, even if the twopeople are in different locations.The meditators I described in the previous chapter knew and liked each otherbefore the experiment, but they were further entrained by the meditation itself.It’s one thing to be connected socially, to be husband and wife, or sisters orbrothers, but for nonlocal communication to occur there must be a deeperconnection as well. Put that way, it sounds as though it must be terriblydifficult to make this sort of connection. But in fact we are all constantly intouch with nonlocal intelligence. The very fact that our bodies exist at all istotally dependent on nonlocal communication.How can something as real and substantial as our bodies depend on virtualcommunication? Consider that the human body consists of approximately onehundred trillion cells, about one thousand cells for every bright star in theMilky Way. It takes only fifty replications, starting with the one-celledfertilized ovum, to produce those one hundred thousand billion cells. The firstreplication gives you two cells. The second replication gives you four. Thethird replication gives you sixteen cells, and so on. By the fiftiethreplication, you have one hundred thousand billion cells in your body, andthat’s where the replication stops.So all of the cells of your body start from just one cell. That one cellreplicates and replicates, and somewhere along the line the cells differentiate.There are some 250 different types of cells in the human body, from thespherical simple fat cell to the thin, branching nerve cell. Scientists stillhave no idea how that one cell ends up dividing into so many different kinds ofcells, which then are able to organize themselves into a stomach, a brain, skin,teeth, and all the other highly specialized parts of the body.In addition to doing its specific job in the body, each cell does a few millionthings per second just to keep functioning: creating proteins, adjusting thepermeability of its membrane, and processing nutrients, to name just a few. Eachcell also has to know what every other cell is doing; otherwise your body wouldfall apart. The human body can function only if it is operatingsynchronistically, and all this can happen only through nonlocal correlation.How else could one hundred trillion cells each doing one million things persecond coordinate their activities so as to support a living, breathing humanbeing? How else could a human body generate thoughts, remove toxins, and smileat a baby, or even make a baby, all at the same time?In order to wiggle my toes, first I have the thought that I’d like to do so. Thethought activates my brain cortex, which then sends a nerve impulse down throughthe spinal cord into my legs and moves my toes. That in itself is miraculous.Where did the thought come from? Before the thought, there was no energy, but assoon as I had the thought and the intention to wiggle my toes, it created acontrolled electromagnetic storm in my brain, which transferred down the nerve,and caused it to discharge a certain chemical. Then my toes wiggled. That’s avery linear, mechanical, and local phenomenon—except for that very first part,the thought that started it all. How did the thought first create theelectricity? Scientists understand the body’s mechanisms—action potential,neurotransmitters, and muscular contractions, all of it. But no one can showthrough experiment where the thought came from. The thought cannot be seen, butwithout it, we would be paralyzed. No thought, no toe-wiggling. Somehow yourawareness becomes information and energy. Where does that happen?The answer is that the thought originates in the virtual domain. Our bodies behave synchronistically all the time. Whenever there’s even a slightperturbation in our physical body, the whole body reacts. For example, supposeyou haven’t eaten all day, so your blood sugar level starts to drop.Immediately, a whole synchronicity of events works to bring your blood sugarback up. The pancreas secretes a hormone called glucagon, which converts storedsugar in the liver into glucose, which immediately becomes available for energy.In addition, fat cells release fatty acids and glucose into the bloodstream, andthe nervous system stimulates skeletal muscles to give up their glucose stores.All these things happen at once. Insulin levels will go down and your heart ratewill speed up to mobilize energy. Nearly a million things will happen in thebody with the intention of bringing that sugar level back to normal. And that isjust one function among all the others occurring simultaneously throughout thebody. All this could be possible only through nonlocal communication,information correlated faster than the speed of light, outside the bounds ofstandard physics.It has been suggested that this nonlocal communication is set up by theresonance of the electrical activity of our hearts. Your heart has somethingcalled a pacemaker, which keeps the normal heart beating at about seventy-twotimes per minute. The pacemaker in your heart sets off an electrical impulseevery few seconds, and that electrical impulse causes the mechanical contractionof your heart. Any time you have an electrical current, you have anelectromagnetic field around it. (Electromagnetic fields are basically photonsbehaving in a certain way.) So the heart, with every beat, broadcasts itselectromagnetic energy to the rest of your body. It even sends itselectromagnetic field outside the body (if the field is amplified, other peoplecan register receiving these signals!). The energy is sent throughout your body.In this way, the heart is the master oscillator of the body, with its ownelectromagnetic field. It creates a field of resonance so that every cell in thebody starts to entrain with every other cell, which makes every cellsynchronistically attuned to every other cell.When cells are caught in the same field of resonance, they are all dancing tothe same music. Studies show that when we’re thinking creatively, or when we arefeeling peaceful, or when we’re feeling love, those emotions generate a verycoherent electromagnetic field. And that electromagnetic field is broadcast tothe rest of your body. It also creates a field of resonance where all the cellsof the body lock in with each other. Every cell knows what every other cell isdoing because they’re all doing the same thing, while still expressing theirunique functions efficiently: Stomach cells are making hydrochloric acid, immunecells are generating antibodies, the pancreatic cells are manufacturing insulin,and so on.In a healthy body, this synchronicity is perfectly regulated. Healthy people arefirmly locked into these rhythms. When disease occurs, one of those rhythms hasgone awry. Stress is the biggest disrupter. If you’re stressed, if you’refeeling hostility, your body’s balance gets thrown off. Stress breaks ournonlocal connection with everything else. When you are experiencing disease(“dis-ease”), then some part of your body is beginning to get constricted. It istuning itself out from the nonlocal field of intelligence.There are many emotions that can cause a disruption of the electromagnetic fieldin the heart, but the ones that have been most precisely documented are angerand hostility. Once this synchronization is disrupted, your body starts tobehave in a fragmented manner. The immune system gets suppressed, which leads toother problems, such as increased susceptibility to cancer, infections, andaccelerated aging. This effect is so strong that animals can pick it up. If adog sees a person who is harboring hostility, it will bark and act ferocious.Wherever you go, you are broadcasting who you are at this very intimate level.But our connection with nonlocal intelligence doesn’t end at the boundary of ourbodies. Just as our bodies are in balance, so the universe is in balance also,and it displays that balance in rhythms or cycles.As it travels around the sun, the earth creates seasonal rhythms. Winter turnsto spring, and birds start to migrate, fish seek their spawning grounds, flowersbloom, trees bud, fruit ripens, eggs hatch. That one change in nature—a slighttilt of the earth—initiates a cascade of nonlocal events. All of nature isacting as if it were one organism. Even people feel different during variousseasons. Some people tend to get depressed in the winter, and to fall in love inspring. Biochemically, certain changes in your body correspond to the movementof our planet. All of nature is a symphony, and we are part of it.As the earth spins on its axis, it gives us something called a circadian, ordaily, rhythm. Nocturnal creatures awaken at night and go to sleep during theday. Birds forage for food at specific times known as bird hours. Our bodies arealso synchronized to circadian rhythms. I spend most of my time in California,and without conscious effort, my body falls into a California rhythm in keepingwith my time zone. My body begins to anticipate the sunrise, allowing me toawaken at about the same time every day, and it slows down in evening, allowingme to prepare for sleep. During sleep, my body is still highly active, moving methrough the different stages of sleep, changing my brain waves. Hormones thatcontrol and regulate different body functions are still being produced andsecreted, but in different amounts than during my awakening hours. Each cellstill carries on its million different activities, as the body as a wholeconducts its nighttime cycle.On earth, we feel the effects of the sun in the circadian rhythm, and theeffects of the moon in the lunar rhythm, as it waxes and wanes. The cycles ofthe moon play themselves out in our body, instantly correlating with planetarymovements. A woman’s twenty-eight-day menstrual cycle is affected by the moon,and there are other, more subtle monthly rhythms that affect mood andproductivity in all people. The gravitational effects of the sun and moon on theearth cause ocean tides, which also affect our bodies. After all, millions ofyears ago we, too, were inhabitants of the ocean. When we slithered onto shorewe brought some of the ocean along with us. Eighty percent of our body has thesame chemical composition as the ocean we once called home, and is stillaffected by its tidal pull.All these rhythms—circadian, lunar, and seasonal—are tuned in to each other.There are rhythms within rhythms within rhythms. And these drumbeats echo allaround us and within us. We are not outsiders to the process; we are part of it,throbbing to the pulse of the universe. Nonlocal intelligence is within us andall around us. It is spirit, the potential from which everything emerges. It isthe ground of our being; it is dimensionless; it has no volume, no energy, nomass, and it occupies no space. Nor does it exist in time. All experiences arelocalized projections of this nonlocal reality, which is a singular, unifiedpotential. Here everything is inseparably one. At this deeper level of realityyou are this nonlocal intelligence, a universal being observing itself through ahuman nervous system. Just as a prism breaks up a single beam of light into thecolors of the spectrum, nonlocal intelligence, by observing itself, breaks asingle reality into a multitude of appearances.Think of the universe as a single, huge organism. Its vastness is a perceptual,projected reality; even though “out there” you may be seeing a big footballstadium filled with thousands of people, the real phenomenon is a smallelectrical impulse inside your brain that you, the nonlocal being, interpret asa football game. Yoga Vasishta, an ancient Vedic text, says, “The world is likea huge city, reflected in a mirror. So too, the universe is a huge reflection ofyourself in your own consciousness.”It is, in short, the soul of all things."},{"pageContent":"3image [../images/00003.jpeg]The Nature of the SoulIn the vastness of the ocean, there is no ego. Seen from a great distance, fromthe moon or a satellite, the ocean looks calm and inanimate, a large swath ofblue girdling the earth. But as we get closer and closer to the ocean itself, wesee that it is in constant motion, roiled by currents and tides, eddies andwaves. We see these ocean patterns as distinct entities. As each wave iscreated, we can watch it crest, break, and race to the shore. Yet it isimpossible to separate the wave from the ocean. You cannot take a bucket, scoopout a wave, and bring it home. If you take a photo of a wave and come back thenext day, no wave will be an exact match.When we are beginning to understand the soul, the ocean provides a wonderfulanalogy. Imagine the ocean as nonlocal reality, the field of infinitepossibilities, the virtual level of existence that synchronizes everything. Eachof us is like a wave in that ocean. We are created from it, and it makes up thevery core of who we are. Just as a wave takes on a specific shape, we, too, takeon intricate patterns of nonlocal reality. This vast, unending ocean ofpossibility is the essence of everything in the physical world. The oceanrepresents the nonlocal, and the wave represents the local. The two areintimately connected.Once we define the soul as deriving from the nonlocal, or virtual, realm, thenour place in the universe becomes remarkably clear: We are both local andnonlocal, an individual pattern emerging from nonlocal intelligence, which isalso part of everyone and everything else. We can think of the soul, then, ashaving two parts. The vast, nonlocal soul exists at the virtual or spirit level.It is powerful, pure, and capable of anything. The personal, local part of thesoul exists at the quantum level. This is what reaches into our daily lives andholds the essence of who we are. It, too, is powerful, pure, and capable ofanything. The same unbounded potential of the infinite spirit also resides ineach and every one of us. Our personal soul, which we think of when we think ofour “selves,” is an outcropping of the eternal soul.If we could learn to live from the level of the soul, we would see that thebest, most luminous part of ourselves is connected to all the rhythms of theuniverse. We would truly know ourselves as the miracle-makers we are capable ofbeing. We would lose fear, and longing, and hatred, and anxiety, and hesitation.Living from the level of the soul means diving past the ego, past thelimitations of the mind that harness us to events and outcomes in the physicalworld.In the vastness of the ocean there is no individual “I” clamoring for attention.There are waves and eddies and tides, but it is all, in the end, ocean. We areall patterns of nonlocality pretending to be people. In the end, it is allspirit.And yet, we all feel quite individual, don’t we? Our senses reassure us thatthese bodies are real, and we think our own very personal, individual thoughts.We learn, fall in love, have children, and work at our own careers. How is itthat we do not feel this vast ocean churning inside us? Why do our lives feel socircumscribed? It all comes back to the three levels of existence.At the physical level, what we call the real world, the soul is the observer inthe midst of the observation. Anytime you observe something, there are threecomponents involved. The first, which occurs in the physical world, is theobject of your observation. The second, which happens at the level of the mind,is the process of observing. The third component of observation is the actualobserver, which we call the soul.Let’s look at a simple example of the three components of observation. First, afour-legged, furry animal becomes the object of your observation. Next, youreyes receive the visual image of the object and transmit the signal to yourmind, which interprets that object to be a dog. But who is observing the dog?Turn your awareness inward and you become aware of a presence within you. Thatpresence is your soul, the extension of the vast nonlocal intelligence that iscropping up in you. So the mind is involved in the process of knowing, but thesoul is the knower. This presence, this awareness, this knower, this soul, isunchanging. It is the still point of reference in the midst of all the changingscenery in the physical world.We each have a soul, but because we are each observing from a different placeand a different set of experiences, we do not observe the same things in exactlythe same ways. The variations in what we observe are based on our minds’interpretations. If you and I both were to observe a dog, for instance, we wouldhave different thoughts. I may see it as a ferocious animal, and I may becomeafraid. You may look at the same dog and see it as a friendly companion. Ourminds interpret the observation differently. When I see a dog, I run. When yousee a dog, you whistle and play with it.Interpretation happens at the level of the mind, but it is our individual soulsthat are conditioned by experience, and through that memory of past experiencethe soul influences our choices and interpretations in life. These tiny kernelsor seeds of memory build up in the individual soul over a lifetime, and thiscombination of memory and imagination based on experience is called karma. Karmaaccumulates in the personal part of the soul, the wave at the core of our being,and colors it. This personal soul governs the conscience and provides a templatefor the kind of person each of us will turn out to be. In addition, the actionswe take can affect this personal soul, and change our karma, for better orworse.The universal, nonlocal part of the soul is not touched by our actions, but isconnected to a spirit that is pure and unchanging. In fact, the definition ofenlightenment is “the recognition that I am an infinite being seeing and seenfrom, observing and observed from, a particular and localized point of view.”Whatever else we are, no matter how much of a mess we may have made of ourlives, it is always possible to tap into the part of the soul that is universal,the infinite field of pure potential, and change the course of our destiny. Thatis synchrodestiny—taking advantage of this connection between the personal souland the universal soul to shape your life.So the seeds of memory built by experience, our karma, help determine who weare. But the individuality of our personal soul is shaped by more than karma;our relationships also play an important role in the construction of the soul.Let me explain by more closely examining the different aspects of our existence.When we consider our physical bodies, we discover that we are, really, acollection of recycled molecules. Cells of our body are created, die, and arereplaced many times throughout our lives. We are constantly remaking ourselves.In order to regenerate, our bodies convert the food we eat into basic buildingblocks of life. The earth itself provides the nutrients we need to renewourselves, and when we shed cells, they are returned to the earth. We might say,then, that we are constantly transforming our physical bodies by recyclingearth.Next, consider our emotions. Emotions are just recycled energy. Emotions do notoriginate with us. They come and go depending on situations, circumstances,relationships, and events. On September 11, 2001, the date of the World TradeCenter disaster, fear and terror were common emotions, triggered by the eventsof that day. Those powerful emotions continued for months. Emotions are nevercreated in isolation; they always come about because of some interaction withthe environment. In the absence of circumstances or relationships, there is noemotion. So even though I may fly into a rage, it is not actually my anger. Itis anger that has settled on me for the moment.Think about the last time you were surrounded by people who were allexperiencing similar emotions—an angry mob, mourners at a funeral, or fans at awinning soccer match. It is nearly impossible not to get caught up in thatemotion because it is so potent when expressed by so many people simultaneously.It would not be “your” anger, sadness, or jubilation, in those situations. Eachemotion is dependent on the context, circumstances, and relationships thatdefine your reality at that moment.And what about our thoughts? Well, our thoughts are recycled information. Everythought we have is actually part of a collective database. One hundred years agoit would have been impossible to say, “I’m going to Disney World on Delta AirLines.” There was no concept of those things in the world at large; therefore Icould not have that thought. There was no Disney World, no Delta Air Lines, letalone any commercial air travel. All but the most original thoughts are simplyrecycled information, and even the most original thoughts are actually quantumleaps of creativity that occur from that same collective, recycled bed ofinformation.Although the phrase “quantum leap” has become common in everyday conversation,it actually has a very specific meaning. When we are taught about atoms inschool, we are usually told that there is a nucleus that contains protons andneutrons, and that electrons circle the nucleus in fixed orbits or shells thatare varying distances from the nucleus.image [../images/00005.jpeg]We are told that electrons stay in one particular orbit, but sometimes change toa different orbit. If it absorbs energy, an electron can jump to a higher orbit;if it releases energy, it can drop to a lower orbit. What most of us are nevertold is that when an electron changes orbits, it does not move through space toarrive at its new location; rather, at one moment the electron is in orbit A,and in the very next moment it is in orbit B, without having traveled throughthe space in between. This is what is meant by a quantum leap. A quantum leap isa change in status from one set of circumstances to another set of circumstancesthat takes place immediately, without passing through the circumstances inbetween.Scientists have learned that they cannot predict when and where a quantum leapwill occur. They can create mathematical models that allow them to estimate thequantum leaps, but they are never totally predictable. On a subatomic level,that little bit of unpredictability seems inconsequential. If an electron jumpsfrom orbit to orbit, what does that have to do with me? Well, when we considerall the atoms in the world and all that unpredictability, we’re obliged to lookat the world in completely new ways.Scientists recognize the unpredictability of nature, and have been trying tomake sense of it. Even the most seemingly simple events are governed by thisunpredictability. When and where will bubbles appear in a pot of boiling water?What patterns will be made by the smoke of a lit cigarette? How does theposition of water molecules at the top of a waterfall relate to their eventualposition at the bottom? As James Gleick wrote in his book Chaos, as far asstandard physics is concerned, God might just as well have taken all those watermolecules under the table and shuffled them personally.The new science of chaos is attempting to predict the unpredictable throughintricate mathematical models. In the classic example, a butterfly flutters itswings in Texas and there is a typhoon in Tokyo six days later. The connectionmay not seem obvious, but it exists. That little change of air pressure causedby the butterfly can get multiplied and magnified, resulting in a tornado. Butit can never be entirely predicted. That’s why weather forecasters seem to bewrong so often, and why any forecast longer than about forty-eight hours away isunreliable. Yet among all the possible occurrences in the world, weather is morepredictable than just about anything else.What this says on a spiritual level is that we can never really know whatdirection life will take, what changes those small butterfly-flutters ofintention and action might cause in our destiny. And at the same time, it alsotells us that we can never truly know the mind of God. We can never fullyunderstand the how, where, and when of anything, even something as simple asboiling water. We have to surrender to uncertainty, while appreciating itsintricate beauty.All creativity is based on quantum leaps and uncertainty. At particular momentsin time, truly novel ideas emanate from the collective bed of information. Theseideas did not originate in the fortunate individual, but in the collectiveconsciousness. This is why significant scientific discoveries are often made bytwo or more different people at the same time. The ideas are already circulatingin the collective unconscious, and prepared minds are ready to translate thatinformation. This is the nature of genius, to be able to grasp the knowable evenwhen no one else recognizes that it is present. At any given moment, theinnovation or creative idea doesn’t exist, and in the next moment, it is part ofour conscious world. In between, where was it? It came from the virtual domain,at the level of the universal spirit, where everything is potential. Sometimesthis potential creates something predictable, sometimes it creates somethingnovel, but in this realm all possibilities already exist.So if our bodies are recycled earth, our emotions are recycled energy, and ourthoughts are recycled information, what is it that makes you an individual? Howabout your personality? Well, the personality doesn’t originate with us, either.Personality gets created through selective identification with situations andthrough relationships. Think about a close friend. How do you define thatperson? Most of us do so by describing the people in their lives—their spouses,their children, their parents, the people they work with. We also describepeople in the context of the situations in their lives, what kinds of jobs theyperform, where they live, what they do for fun. What we call personality isbuilt on a foundation of relationships and situations.So now we may ask, if my body, emotions, thoughts, and personality are notoriginal or created by me, who am I really? According to many of the greatspiritual traditions, one of the great truths is that “I am the other.” Withoutthe other, we would not exist. Your soul is the reflection of all souls. Imaginetrying to understand the complex web of personal interactions that have made youwho you are today—all your family and friends, every teacher and classmateyou’ve ever had, every shop clerk in every store you’ve ever visited, everyoneyou’ve ever worked with or come in contact with at any point in your life. Andthen, in order to understand all those people and the type of influence they mayhave had on you, you have to find out who they are. So now you have to describethe web of relationships surrounding every one of those people who form yourrelationship network. Eventually, you would find that you would need to describethe whole universe in order to define a single person. In truth, then, everysingle person is the whole universe. You are the infinite, seen from a specific,localized point of view. Your soul is the part of you that is universal andindividual at the same time, and it is a reflection of all other souls.To define the soul in this way, therefore, is to understand that your soul isboth personal and universal at the same time, which has meaning and implicationsbeyond your personal experience of life. The soul is the observer who interpretsand makes choices in a confluence of relationships. These relationships providethe background, setting, characters, and events that shape the stories of ourlives. Just as the soul is created through relationships and is a reflection ofall relationships, the experience of life is created from context and meaning.By context I mean everything that surrounds us that allows us to understand themeaning of individual actions, words, occurrences, or anything else. A word, forexample, can have different meanings depending on what surrounds it, or itscontext. If I say the word “bark” without context, you won’t know whether I meanthe bark of a dog or the bark of a tree. When we say that someone took our words“out of context,” we know that the meaning of our words was misunderstood,because context determines the meaning of everything. The flow of meaning is theflow of life. Our context determines how we will interpret what we encounter inlife, and these interpretations become our experience.Finally, we come to a more complete definition of a soul. A soul is the observerwho interprets and makes choices based on karma; it is also a confluence ofrelationships, out of which emerge contexts and meaning, and it is this flow ofcontext and meaning that creates experience. So it is through the soul that wecreate our lives.As I will discuss later, the best way to approach an understanding of the dualnature of the soul and to tap into the nonlocal field of potential is throughmeditation. Meditation allows us to reach the level of the soul by easing pastthe tangle of thoughts and emotions that usually keep our attention bound to thephysical world. When we close our eyes to meditate, thoughts spring upspontaneously. There are only two kinds of thoughts you can have, memories andimaginings. But, as we’ve discussed, these thoughts do not originate in yourphysical body.Try this little thought experiment: Think about the dinner you ate last night.Can you remember what you were eating? What the food tasted like? Whatconversations were going on around you? Now, where was that information before Iasked those questions? That dinner took place, but the information about itdidn’t exist except as potential information. If a surgeon went inside yourbrain, there would be no trace of information about the food you ate for dinner.Memory resides at the level of the soul until we call it up. Once we consciouslydecide to recall our dinner, electrical activity and a release of chemicalssignal that the brain is at work. But before we pull up the memory, it has nolocation in your brain. Simply asking a question or trying to recall an eventconverts a virtual memory into a real memory.The same is true of imagination. Until a thought arises from the virtual realm,it does not exist in your mental or physical life. But imagination can have apowerful effect on the mind and body. A common but highly effective thoughtexperiment is to imagine slicing a lemon into large wedges, putting a wedgebetween your teeth, and biting into the flesh of the lemon. Imagine the juicesquirting into your mouth as you bite down. If you are like most people, justthat quick thought led to a rush of saliva in your mouth, your body’s way ofsaying that it believes what your mind is telling it. But again, where was thatlemon before I asked you to think of it? It did not exist anywhere but at thelevel of potential.So intention, imagination, insight, intuition, inspiration, meaning, purpose,creativity, understanding, all these have nothing to do with the brain. Theyorchestrate their activity through the brain, but they are qualities of thenonlocal domain, which is beyond space and time. Still, their impact is feltvery strongly. Once they enter our minds, we have to do something with them, andwhat we do with them determines, in part, who you define yourself to be. That’sbecause we have rational minds, and we tend to create stories around thesethoughts. You might think, “My husband loves me,” or “My children are happy,” or“I enjoy my work.” You create rational stories around these thoughts, and thenyou create meaning out of them. Then you go and live out these stories in thephysical world, and this is what we call everyday life.Our stories are derived from relationships, contexts, and meanings triggeredthrough memory, arising from karma and experience. As we live out these stories,we start to realize that they are not original. Although the details of thestories vary from individual to individual, the themes and motifs are timeless,basic archetypes that replay endlessly: heroes and villains; sin and redemption;the divine and the diabolical; forbidden lust and unconditional love. These arethe same themes that keep many of us fascinated by soap operas, gossip columns,and tabloids, where we see them expressed in slightly exaggerated form. We’refascinated because we can identify some aspect of our souls in those stories.These are the same archetypes that are represented in exaggerated form inmythologies, so whether we examine Indian mythology or Greek mythology orEgyptian mythology, we find these same themes and motifs. The drama of thesestories is more compelling and more dramatic than fiction because they resonatein our soul.So now we can refine our definition of the soul even further. The soul is theconfluence of meanings, contexts, relationships, and mythical stories orarchetypal themes that give rise to everyday thoughts, memories, and desires(conditioned by karma) that create the stories in which we participate.In nearly everyone, this participation in the stories of our lives is happeningautomatically, without awareness. We live like actors in a play who are givenonly one line at a time, going through the motions without understanding thefull story. But when you get in touch with your soul, you see the whole scriptfor the drama. You understand. You still participate in the story, but now youparticipate joyously, consciously, and fully. You can make choices based onknowledge and born out of freedom. Each moment takes on a deeper quality thatcomes from appreciation of what it means in the context of your life.What is even more thrilling is that we, ourselves, are capable of rewriting theplay or changing our roles by applying intention, grasping the opportunitiesthat arise from coincidence, and being true to the calling of our souls."},{"pageContent":"4image [../images/00003.jpeg]IntentionEvery child who has ever heard the story of Aladdin dreams of finding a magiclamp that, when rubbed, would deliver a genie who could grant every wish. Asadults, we understand that there are no such lamps and no such genies, whichleaves all those wishes bottled up inside us. But what if wishes could cometrue? What wishes would you make for yourself? What would fulfill your needs atthe deepest, most basic level? What would allow your soul to complete itsdestiny?Everything that happens in the universe starts with intention. When I decide towiggle my toes, or buy a birthday present for my wife, or drink a cup of coffee,or write this book, it all starts with intention. This intention always arisesin the nonlocal or universal mind, but it localizes through the individual mind.And having localized, it becomes physical reality.In fact, physical reality would not exist were it not for intent. Intentactivates nonlocal, synchronized correlation in the brain. Whenever there iscognition or perception of physical reality, the brain’s disparate regions showa “phase and frequency locking in” of the firing patterns of individual neuronsin different parts of the brain. This is nonlocal synchronization around afrequency of forty hertz (forty cycles per second). This synchronization, alsocalled binding, is a requirement for cognition. Without it you would not see aperson as a person, a house as a house, a tree as a tree, or a face in aphotograph as a face. You might just observe dots of black and white, scatteredlines, patches of light and dark. In fact, the objects of your perceptionregister only as on-off electromagnetic signals in your brain. Synchronizationorganized by intent converts dots and spots, scattered lines, electricaldischarges, patterns of light and darkness, into a wholeness, a gestalt thatcreates a picture of the world as a subjective experience. The world does notexist as pictures, but only as these patches of on-off impulses, these dots andspots, these digital codes of seemingly random electrical firings.Synchronization through intent organizes them into an experience in the brain—asound, a texture, a form, a taste, and a smell. You as nonlocal intelligence“label” that experience and suddenly there is the creation of a material objectin subjective consciousness.The world is like a Rorschach blot that we convert into a world of materialobjects through synchronization orchestrated by intent. The world before it isobserved and the nervous system before the desire or intent to observe somethingboth exist as a dynamic (constantly changing), nonlinear chaotic field ofactivities in a state of non-equilibrium (unstable activity). Intentsynchronistically organizes these highly variable, seemingly chaotic andunrelated activities in a nonlocal universe into a highly ordered,self-organizing, dynamic system that manifests simultaneously as an observedworld and a nervous system through which that world is being observed. Theintent itself does not arise in the nervous system, although it is orchestratedthrough the nervous system. However, intent is responsible for more thancognition and perception. All learning, remembering, reasoning, drawing ofinferences, and motor activity are preceded by intent. Intent is the very basisof creation.The ancient Vedic texts known as the Upanishads declare, “You are what yourdeepest desire is. As is your desire, so is your intention. As is yourintention, so is your will. As is your will, so is your deed. As is your deed,so is your destiny.” Our destiny ultimately comes from the deepest level ofdesire and also from the deepest level of intention. The two are intimatelylinked to each other.What is intention? Most people say it’s a thought of something that you want toaccomplish in your life or that you want for yourself. But really it is morethan that. An intention is a way of fulfilling a certain need that you have,whether that need is for material things, for a relationship, for spiritualfulfillment, or for love. Intention is a thought that you have that will helpyou to fulfill a need. And the logic is that once you fulfill that need, youwill be happy.Seen this way, the goal of all our intentions is to be happy or fulfilled.First, if we are asked what we want, we might say, “I want more money,” or “Iwant a new relationship.” Then if we are asked why we want that, we may saysomething like, “Well, so I’ll be to spend more time with my children.” If weare asked why we want to spend more time with our children, we might say,“Because then I’ll be happy.” So we can see that the ultimate goal of all goalsis a fulfillment at the spiritual level that we call happiness or joy or love.All the activity in the universe is generated by intention. According toVedantic tradition, “Intent is a force of nature.” Intent maintains the balanceof all the universal elements and forces that allow the universe to continue toevolve.Even creativity is orchestrated through intent. Creativity occurs at theindividual level, but it also occurs universally, allowing the world toperiodically take quantum leaps in evolution. Ultimately, when we die, the soultakes a quantum leap in creativity. In effect it says, “I now must expressmyself through a new body-mind system, or incarnation.” So intent comes from theuniversal soul, becomes localized in an individual soul, and is finallyexpressed through an individual, local mind.From experience in the past we create memories, which are the basis ofimagination and desire. Desire is the basis of action, once again. And so thecycle perpetuates itself. In Vedic tradition and in Buddhism this cycle is knownas the Wheel of Samsara, the basis of earthly existence. The nonlocal “I”becomes the local “I” as it filters through this karmic process.When intention is repeated, that creates habit. The more an intention isrepeated, the more likely it is that the universal consciousness will create thesame pattern and manifest the intention in the physical world. If you recall thephysics discussion earlier, a wave-particle in an unobserved box issimultaneously a wave and a particle, and takes on definite shape only once itis observed. At the moment of observation, the probability collapses into adefinite form. This is the same idea, only with repeated intention the patternin the nonlocal mind is more likely to collapse in the direction of yourintention and therefore will manifest as physical reality. This creates theillusion of what is easy and what is difficult, what is possible and what isimpossible. That’s why, if you really want to break out of the mundane, you mustlearn to think and dream the impossible. Only with repeated thoughts can theimpossible be made possible through the intention of the nonlocal mind.The nonlocal mind in you is the same as the nonlocal mind in me, or, in fact, ina rhinoceros or in a giraffe or in a bird or in a worm. Even a rock containsnonlocal intelligence. This nonlocal mind, this pure consciousness, is whatgives us the sense of “I,” the “I” that says “I am Deepak,” the “I” that says“I’m a bird,” the “I” that says who you are or who you believe you are. Thisuniversal consciousness is the only “I” there is. But that single, universal “I”differentiates; it morphs itself into an almost infinite number of observers andobserved, seers and scenery, organic forms and inorganic forms—all the beingsand objects that make up the physical world. This habit of the universalconsciousness to differentiate into particular consciousnesses exists prior tointerpretation. So, before the “I am” says “I am Deepak,” or a giraffe, or aworm, it is simply “I am.” The infinite creative potential of the “I” organizesthe communal “I” into the “I” that is you, or me, or any other thing in theuniverse.This is the same concept as the two levels of the soul, the universal soul andthe individual soul, but put into a personal context. As human beings, we areused to thinking of our individual selves as “I,” without noticing orappreciating the greater, universal “I” that is also called the universal soul.The use of the word “I” is merely a clever reference point we use for locatingour unique point of view within the universal soul. But when we define ourselvessolely as an individual “I,” we lose the ability to imagine beyond theboundaries of what is traditionally considered possible. In the universal “I,”everything is not only possible, it already exists, and simply requires intentto collapse it into a reality in the physical world.The differences between the individual “I” or local mind and the universal “I”or nonlocal mind can be clearly seen in the following chart:Local Mind--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1. ego mind2. individual mind3. individual consciousness4. conditioned consciousness5. linear6. operates within space, time, causality7. time-bound and limited8. rational9. conditioned into habitual ways of thinking and behavior, shaped by individualand collective experience10. separates11. inner dialogue: This is me and mine12. fear dominates--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Nonlocal Mind--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1. spirit2. soul3. universal consciousness4. pure consciousness5. synchronistic6. operates outside space, time, causality7. timeless and infinite8. intuitive/creative9. unconditioned, infinitely correlated, infinitely creative10. unifies11. inner dialogue: All this is me and mine12. love dominates--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Local Mind--------------------------------------------------------------------------------13. requires energy14. needs approval15. interprets the “I” within the observer as different from the “I” in theobserved16. thinks in cause-and-effect modalities17. algorithmic18. continuous19. conscious20. active when senses are active because sensory experience is local21. expresses itself through the voluntary nervous system (individual choice)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Nonlocal Mind--------------------------------------------------------------------------------13. operates without energy14. immune to criticism and flattery15. knows it is the same “I” in the observer and the observed16. sees an acausal interconnectedness or interdependent correlation17. nonalgorithmic18. discontinuous19. supra-conscious20. always active, but more available to itself when senses are in abeyance orwithdrawn, as in sleep, dreams, meditation, drowsiness, trance, prayer21. expresses itself through autonomic and endocrine systems, and, mostimportant, through the synchronization of these systems (and also through thesynchronization of the particular and the universal, the microcosm and themacrocosm)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The difference between local mind and nonlocal mind is the difference betweenordinary and extraordinary. The local mind is personal and individual to each ofus. It holds our ego, the self-defined “I” that wanders through the world aslave to our conditioned habits. By its very nature, the local mind separates usfrom the rest of creation. It puts up thick, artificial boundaries that many ofus feel compelled to defend, even when this means cutting ourselves off from thedeeper meanings and joyous connections that come from feeling part of theuniversal. Local mind is plodding, exhausting, and rational, with no sense ofwhimsy or creativity. It requires constant attention and approval, and istherefore prone to fear, disappointment, and pain.Nonlocal mind, on the other hand, is pure soul or spirit, known as universalconsciousness. Operating outside the boundaries of normal space and time, it isthe great organizing and unifying force in the universe, infinite in scope andduration. By its nature, nonlocal mind connects all things because it is allthings. It requires no attention, no energy, no approval; it is whole untoitself, and therefore attracts love and acceptance. It is imminently creative,the source from which all creation flows. It allows us to imagine beyond theboundaries of what local mind sees as “possible,” to think “outside the box,”and to believe in miracles.The creative leaps taken by nonlocal mind have been supported by science. Gapsin the fossil record during evolution suggest creative leaps of imagination innature itself, a hypothesis known as punctuated equilibrium. For example, thereare ancient fossils of amphibians, and ancient fossils of birds, but there is nofossil record of a connecting creature between amphibians and birds. Thatsuggests a quantum leap of imagination, where amphibians wanted to learn how tofly, and birds manifested as a result of that intent. Scientists believeprimates evolved into humans, but there is no fossil record of the phase inbetween, the “missing link.” First there were only primates, and then suddenlyhuman beings appeared. In between? Nothing.These leaps of imagination are constantly evolving into what we see as theuniverse. In our lifetime, we’ve seen the development of television, theInternet, e-mail, nuclear technology, and space exploration. Imagination leadswherever we go. And although imagination is a property of the universalconsciousness, it gets conditioned through all these localized expressions.Human beings have the ability to go beyond that. They have the ability, throughthe local mind, the local “I,” to make choices through intention. And thenonlocal mind, the nonlocal “I,” takes care of the details synchronistically tofulfill the intention. That is how dreams become reality.Let me explain this with an example. The local “I,” which is Deepak, wants tofeel good by exercising and losing weight. So, Deepak, the local “I,” goesrunning every day, either on the treadmill or by the beach. The nonlocal “I” inDeepak makes this possible by making Deepak’s body perform many functionssimultaneously: The heart has to beat faster and pump more blood, the tissueshave to consume more oxygen, the lungs have to breathe faster and deeper, andthe sugar, which is the fuel in my system, has to quickly burn into carbondioxide and water so that energy can be generated. If the fuel supply gets low,then insulin has to be secreted so that glycogen stored in the liver can be usedas fuel. Immune cells have to be stimulated so the body mind becomes resistantto infection as I’m running through the environment. This is only a veryabbreviated list of things that must happen simultaneously and synchronisticallyso that my intention to run can be fulfilled. In fact, trillions upon trillionsof activities have to happen nonlocally, simultaneously, in order for Deepak toenjoy running.As we can see, the operation of the body is being organized by the nonlocalmind. And while all these activities are being synchronized, Deepak is enjoyinghis run. He’s not worrying about whether his heart will pump the right amount ofblood, or whether his liver will forget to metabolize glycogen into sugar.That’s the job of nonlocal intelligence. The local “I” intends, and the nonlocal“I” organizes all the details synchronistically.But the local “I” does not always cooperate, and sometimes makes bad decisions.Imagine a man named Jim Smith. He’s at a party and the local Jim Smith says,“I’m having a good time at this party.” He sips a little champagne, loosens up,and makes new friends. The nonlocal Jim Smith at the party is also having fun,connecting and enjoying the moment. But what if the local “I” says, “This is alot of fun. Maybe I should drink more and get drunk.” Getting drunk is a way ofdisconnecting; therefore the nonlocal “I” lets the local “I” know that thatdecision has a price. The nonlocal “I” gives the local “I” a headache and ahangover the next morning. This is its way of communicating with the local “I,”saying in effect, If you abuse yourself, you’ll get sick.If the local “I” ignores the nonlocal “I” in its efforts to dissuade it fromthat decision, it will face worse repercussions. If, for example, the local “I”ignores that message and gets drunk every day, then the local Jim Smith mightlose his job, lose his income, disrupt his family relationships, and perhaps getcirrhosis of the liver and eventually die. Why? Because the decision to drinkwas not serving the interests of both the local and the nonlocal Jim Smiths. Itwas not a pure intention because the local “I” warped it. It changed form as itmoved from the nonlocal mind to the local mind. An intention can be fulfilledsynchronistically only if it serves the needs of both the local and the nonlocal“I.” The nonlocal intention is always evolutionary and therefore moving in thedirection of harmonious interactions that serve the larger good.Intention always originates in the universal domain. Ultimately, it is universalintention that fulfills the local intention, as long as it serves the needs ofthe local mind (me) and the nonlocal mind (the universal spirit). Only then willboth local and nonlocal minds cooperate. But there is a confounding factor atplay. There are billions of human beings and trillions of other entities onearth, all with local intentions. Let’s say I’m going to have a party, and Iplan to bake lots of pastries and lots of cakes. In preparation I have boughtsugar, flour, and all the other items that I need. All of this is stored in mypantry, where it attracts ants and mice, whose intention is to consume the sugarand the flour, too. When I discover the activity of the mice, I buy rat trapsand insecticide. Some of the mice die. Bacteria arrive and start breaking downtheir bodies.If we step back and take a wider look at this scenario, we see a conspiracy ofrelated events. They all co-arose and co-created each other. In order for thisdrama to occur, wheat and sugarcane must be grown. That involves farms, farmers,rainfall, sunshine, tractors, consumers, retailers, wholesalers, truckers,railroads, financial trading markets, grocery stores and their employees,investors, insecticides, chemical factories, knowledge of chemistry, and on andon. The number of individual local minds involved is enormous.The question might fairly be asked, then, Who is influencing what? Whoseintention is creating the events? My intention was to bake pastries and cakes.Is my intent influencing the behavior of the entire planet, from farmers tostock market analysts to wheat prices—not to mention the behavior of the antsand mice in my pantry, and the activities of other elements and forces in theuniverse? Was my intent to serve pastries and cakes the only intent in which thewhole universe has to cooperate? A mouse, assuming it was able to consider itsintent, might believe that its intent was responsible for creating this seriesof events, from the activity of grain traders to weather conditions to mydecision to make cakes. In fact, the bacteria could just as easily believe thattheir intent orchestrated the activity of the whole universe, including mydecision to buy the poison that created the protein for their consumption. Itcan seem very confusing when you start to ask whose intent orchestrated anygiven event.Whose intent is creating all this activity? In the deeper reality, the “I” thatorchestrates all these events is the nonlocal, universal “I.” This organizingforce is coordinating and synchronizing an infinite number of eventssimultaneously. The nonlocal mind constantly turns back into itself, renewsitself and its creativity, so that the old never gets stale but is born afreshevery moment. Even though intent comes from the single nonlocal “I,” from myperspective and that of the cat, the mouse, the ants, the bacteria, and thepeople who are coming to the party, it appears to be the intent of a personal“I.”At every location, every organism could be thinking “It’s my intent!” Each andevery one believes it is their personal local “I” that is doing something, butin the larger scheme, all these different local minds are actually co-arisingand co-creating each other, through the intent of the nonlocal mind. The treesmust breathe so I can breathe. The rivers must flow so that my blood cancirculate. In the end, there’s only one exuberant, abundant, eternal, rhythmic,inseparable “I.” All separation is illusion. The local “I” only realizes itselfas the nonlocal “I” when the two connect. Then you start to sense that there’sonly one universal “I.” And when you connect, you start to experience trust,love, forgiveness, gratitude, compassion, surrender, nondoing. This is howprayer works. The great poet Alfred, Lord Tennyson, once said, “More things arewrought by prayer than this world dreams of.” But it’s not prayer through forcedintent; it’s finesse, timing, surrender, gratitude, trust, love, and compassionthat allow me, the local “I,” to experience and become the nonlocal “I.”We are so attached to our local, individual, personal “I” that we are blinded tothe magnificence that lies beyond it. Ignorance is constricted awareness. Inorder to notice something, you have to ignore everything else. That’s hownonlocal becomes local. When I notice anything, I ignore everything else aroundit, which nevertheless contributes to its existence and is therefore a part ofit. When the “I” that is my ego observes, it observes only the particular andignores the universal. But when “I” the spirit sees, it sees the flow of theuniverse that makes the particular possible.It is this interconnection, this inseparability, that makes life not onlypossible, but miraculous. The world’s sea of interrelatedness collapses intoindividual waves that scatter into foaming drops that sparkle like diamonds,reflecting one another for a moment, only to subside back into the ocean’sdepths. There is only one eternal moment—an eternal love, spirit, orconsciousness—that constantly becomes seer and scenery. We are those crystallinedrops, each of us beautiful and unique for a moment, each a part of the other,each reflecting the other. We all derive from eternal love, spirit, orconsciousness, an imagining of the universal “I.” While interpretation, memory,and habit create the illusion of familiarity or sameness, of our continuationfrom minute to minute, in reality, there are infinite possibilities at our core,infinite possibilities that need only intent to make them real.Intention orchestrates infinite possibilities. You might wonder what kind ofintent is ideal. What would you ask if your intention could be fulfilled rightnow? If your intent is a mere personal wish, and serves only personalgratification, the local and nonlocal “I” might be out of sync. How many timeshave you heard people wish they might win the lottery? It might happen, but onlyif the fulfillment of that intention serves both you and the larger purpose. Youmight say to yourself, “I want to win the lottery so I can get myself a newBMW.” Even that intention serves many people: you, the car manufacturer, itsemployees, investors, and the economy. However, it is not as powerful as theintent of someone like Mother Teresa, because her desire to raise money was theresult of a desire to bring fulfillment to others, to give and receive at adeeper level—to serve the great chain of being. When the intention of thenonlocal mind is served by the local mind, it is more holistic, and thereforemore effective.For every intention, we might well ask, “How would this serve me and how wouldit serve everybody I come into contact with?” And if the answer is that it willcreate true joy and fulfillment in me and all those affected by my actions, thenmy intention, together with surrender to the nonlocal mind, orchestrates its ownfulfillment. There are techniques for discovering the pure and proper intentionthat is your life’s destiny, which we will discuss in detail later on. But thecore technique is to start from a place of quiet and settled awareness, tocreate a proper intention in your heart, and then to let your local “I” mergeback into the nonlocal “I,” allowing the will of God to be completed throughyou. I have taught this technique to many thousands of people and they tell methat it works for them, as it works for me.Part of the difficulty is forming an intention that doesn’t interfere with theintention of the universal. In developing countries with a food shortage,scientists recently attempted to introduce “golden rice,” a geneticallyengineered variant that contains natural insecticides so that the rice growsabundantly. But there were problems. The genetically engineered rice doesn’thave natural odors that attract various insects important for maintaining andpropagating the food chain. Ecologists fear that this rice might upset the localecosystem, eventually disrupting the weather, which could have dire consequencesfor the entire planet. Constricted or local awareness, looking only at aparticular situation, tries to solve it locally. Expanded awareness, thenonlocal “I,” looks at the relationships, the birds, the bees, the squirrels,the groundhogs, and the weather (there has to be a given population of trees andflora and fauna to enable a certain type of weather to arise). A good intentioncan backfire if the intent of the nonlocal “I” is ignored. The intricate bondsof interconnection require not only selflessness but coordination with all otherindividual “I”s that stem from the universal “I.”Intent cannot be pushed or forced or bullied. Think of it as catching soapbubbles in the air. It is a delicate endeavor that cannot be rushed or pushed.The same is true of meditation or sleep. One cannot try to meditate or sleep.These activities require letting go, and the harder you try, the less successfulyou will be. Meditation happens; sleep happens. It is the same with intention.The less we interfere with it, the more we see that it has its own “infiniteorganizing power.” Intent has within it the mechanisms for its own fulfillment,like a seed has within it everything it needs to become the tree, the flower,and the fruit. I don’t have to do anything with that seed. I just have to put itin the ground and water it. The seed itself, without any prompting from me, willcreate everything thereafter.Intent is a seed in consciousness, or spirit. If you pay attention to it, it haswithin it the means for its own fulfillment. Intention’s infinite organizingpower orchestrates countless details simultaneously.Intent creates coincidences; it is the reason why, when you’re thinking ofsomething, it happens. Intent is the reason why some people have a spontaneousremission or heal themselves. Intent orchestrates all the creativity in theuniverse. And we, as human beings, are capable of creating positive changes inour lives through intent. So why do we lose that ability? The ability is lostwhen the self-image overshadows the self, when we sacrifice our true self forthe ego.The realization that “I” am separate from “you” starts to happen at around agetwo or three. At this stage a baby starts to differentiate between “me” and“mine,” and “not me” and “not mine.” This separation creates anxiety. In realitythe world is not separate from us, but part of the continuum of consciousness.Intent works by harnessing the creative forces inherent in the universe. Just aswe have our personal creativity, the universe also displays creativity. Theuniverse is alive and conscious, and it responds to our intent when we have ourintimate relationship with the universe and see it not as separate but as ourextended body.We can restore the power of intent through a return to the true self, orself-actualization. People who attain self-actualization reestablish theirconnectedness to the nonlocal mind. They have no desire to manipulate andcontrol others. They are independent of criticism and also of flattery. Theyfeel beneath no one, but they also feel superior to no one. They are in touchwith the internal reference point that is their soul, and not their ego. Anxietyis no longer an issue, because anxiety comes from the ego’s need to protectitself. And that anxiety is what interferes with the spontaneity of intent.Intent is the mechanics through which spirit transforms itself into materialreality.Mature spirituality requires sobriety of awareness. If you are sober, you areresponsive to feedback but at the same time immune to criticism and flattery.You learn to let go and you do not worry about the result. You have confidencein the outcome, and you start to see the synchronicity that is always organizedaround you. Intention provides opportunities that you have to be alert to. Goodluck is opportunity and preparedness coming together. Intention will provide youopportunities, but you still need to act when the opportunity is provided.Whenever you take action, have the attitude that you are not performing theaction. Have the attitude that your actions are really the actions of nonlocalintelligence, the organizing universal spirit. You will begin to notice a greatdiminution of anxiety. You will also be less attached to the result.Stress is a form of anxiety. If you’re stressed, then you can’t even begin tothink about synchronicity. Synchronicity is a means of getting in touch withGod. It’s a path to meaning and purpose in your life. It’s a means of having theexperience of love and compassion. It’s a means of connecting to the nonlocalintelligence of the universe. If my attention is on situations that generatestress, then it is difficult to access synchronicity. To do so effectively youhave to have an attitude of surrender to the universal domain, which is muchgrander than anything you could imagine. Surrender requires a leap of faith, ajump into the unknown. Your inner dialogue can support this by saying, “Thingsare not going my way. I’m letting go of my idea of how they should. My sense of‘me and mine’ has to expand.” If you take this leap of faith, you will be richlyrewarded. If you find yourself worrying about next month’s bills, it would beappropriate to remind yourself that it is your intent not only to fulfill yourneeds but also to send your children to school, to contribute to your community.All people want to fulfill these needs in their lives. However, havingarticulated and expressed your intent to fulfill them takes them to the infinitemind, and in effect says, “I put all this at your disposal. I’m not going toworry about it because you, the nonlocal intelligence that resides within me,will take care of it.”Great artists, jazz musicians, writers, and scientists talk about having totranscend their individual identities when they create. I’ve worked with a lotof musicians and songwriters and I’ve never known any who are thinking aboutroyalties when they are writing a song. A new song or a new piece of musicinvolves letting go, and incubating in the nonlocal domain, then allowing themusic or song to come to you. All creative processes depend on a phase ofincubation and allowing. Synchronization is a creative process. In this case,however, the creative mind is the cosmos itself. When self-concern departs,nonlocal intelligence enters.Remember, your thoughts must not conflict with the designs of the universe.Wishing to win the lottery can magnify your sense of separation from theuniverse. Frequently lottery winners report alienation from friends and familyand no greater happiness. When money alone becomes the goal, it alienates you.How do you know which of your intentions is likely to be fulfilled? The answerlies in paying attention to the clues provided by the nonlocal mind. Notice thecoincidences in your life. Coincidences are messages. They are clues from God orspirit or nonlocal reality, urging you to break out of your karmic conditioning,your familiar patterns of thinking. They are offering you an opportunity toenter a domain of awareness where you feel loved and cared for by the infiniteintelligence that is your source. Spiritual traditions call this the state ofgrace."},{"pageContent":"5image [../images/00003.jpeg]The Role of CoincidenceTo talk about coincidences as coded messages from the nonlocal intelligencemakes life sound like a mystery novel. Pay attention, watch for clues, deciphertheir meanings, and eventually the truth will be revealed. In many ways, that’sexactly what happens. After all, life is the ultimate mystery.What makes life mysterious is that our destiny seems hidden from us, and only atthe end of our lives will we be in a position to look back and see the path wefollowed. In retrospect, the narrative of our lives appears perfectly logical.We can easily follow the thread of continuity upon which we gathered our life’sexperiences. Even now, at whatever point you are in your life, look back andnotice how naturally your life flowed from one milestone to the next, from oneplace or job to another, from one set of circumstances to an entirely differentset. Notice how effortless it all could have been if you had only known whereyour path was leading. Most people look back and ask, What was I so worriedabout? Why was I so hard on myself, or on my children?If we were able to live at the level of the soul all the time, there would be noneed for hindsight to appreciate the great truths of life. We would know them inadvance. We would participate in creating the adventures of our lives. The pathwould be clearly marked, and we would need no signposts, no clues, and nocoincidences.Most of us don’t live at the level of the soul, however, so we must depend oncoincidences to show us the will of the universe. We have all experiencedcoincidences in our lives. The word itself perfectly describes its meaning: comeans “with,” and incidence means “event.” So the word coincidence refers toevents or incidents that occur with other incidents—two or more events occurringat the same time. Because the experience of coincidences is universal, mostpeople take them for granted, life’s little quirky moments that we marvel over,then quickly forget.Coincidences are so much more than amusements. A coincidence is a clue to theintention of the universal spirit, and as such it is rich with significance.Some people use the phrase “meaningful coincidence” to describe events happeningat the same time that have some special meaning for the person who experiencedthem. But I believe “meaningful coincidence” is redundant because everycoincidence is meaningful; otherwise it would not happen in the first place. Thevery fact that it happens is meaningful. It’s just that sometimes we are able toglimpse its meaning and sometimes we aren’t.What is the meaning in a coincidence? The deeper part of you already knows, butthat awareness has to be brought to the surface. The meaning does not come fromthe coincidence itself. It comes from you, the person who is having theexperience. In fact, without our participation any incident is essentiallymeaningless, the whole universe is meaningless. We are the ones who give meaningto events, and we give meaning to events through intention. Coincidences aremessages from the nonlocal realm, guiding us in the ways to act in order to makeour dreams, our intentions manifest. So first you must have an intention, andthen you must get in touch with your spiritual self. Only then will you have away of using coincidence to fulfill your intentions.Having an intention is easy; it’s as simple as making a wish for one’s life.Becoming more spiritual is difficult. Many people who believe themselves to bespiritual are still not tapping into the vast ocean of the spirit force. Rather,they swim across the surface of that ocean, never diving to discover the depthsof the universal experience.MIRACLES IN THE REAL WORLDMiracles are real phenomena. Every tradition addresses the existence ofmiracles, but they all use different language. We label events as miracles whena desired outcome manifests in a dramatic fashion: We want to be healed from aterrible illness, or attain material wealth, or find our purpose. Then whenthese events occur, we say, how miraculous! Someone has an intention or a desireor a thought, and then it happens. A miracle, then, is a very dramatic exampleof what happens when a person is able to tap into the spiritual domain and applyintention to manifest their destiny.Let me give you an example of a remarkable coincidence. David was in love with awoman named Joanna. He was utterly in love, but a little tentative aboutcommitment and marriage. He finally decided that he would take Joanna to a parkand propose to her. He was still leery of commitment, but when he awoke thatmorning he felt overcome by a feeling of peace, a sense that all would be well.David set out the picnic blanket and was just getting up the nerve to pop thequestion when a plane flew overhead trailing an advertising banner. Joannalooked up and said, “I wonder what that banner says.” Without thinking Davidblurted out, “The banner says, ‘Joanna, marry me.’ ” They both looked moreclosely, and there indeed was a banner that read, JOANNA, MARRY ME. She fellinto his arms, they kissed, and at that moment David knew that marrying her wasexactly right for him. The next day, they read in the local newspaper thatsomeone else had proposed to his girlfriend, Joanna, with a banner over thepark; the plane just happened to be overhead at exactly the right moment forDavid. This remarkable coincidence was a clue to David’s future, a miracle. Thetwo remain happily married to this day.People who are not interested in spirituality attribute these kinds of events toluck. I personally believe that “luck”—at least the way we usually define it—hasnothing to do with it. What most people call luck is nothing more or less thanthe application of synchronicity to the fulfillment of our intentions. LouisPasteur, the scientist who discovered that microbes can cause disease, said,“Chance favors the prepared mind.” This can be converted into a simple equation:Opportunity + Preparedness = Good Luck. It is entirely possible, through thelessons of synchrondestiny, to create such a state of mind that you will beginto see that there are opportune moments in life, and when you notice and takehold of them, they change everything. “Luck” is the word we in the modern worlduse to describe the miraculous.So synchronicity, meaningful coincidence, miracles, good luck—these are alldifferent terms for the same phenomenon. As we have seen, the intelligence ofthe body works through coincidence and synchronicity. The extended intelligenceof nature and the ecosystem, the great web of life, also works throughcoincidence and synchronicity, as does the fundamental intelligence of theuniverse.When you begin seeing coincidences as life opportunities, every coincidencebecomes meaningful. Every coincidence becomes an opportunity for creativity.Every coincidence becomes an opportunity for you to become the person theuniverse intended you to be.This is the ultimate truth of synchrodestiny—that the sum total of the universeis conspiring to create your personal destiny. To do so it uses “acausalnonlocal connections.” What are acausal connections? If we look at all thedisparate incidents in our lives very deeply, they all have a history woventogether with a personal destiny. Acausal means that the incidents are connectedto each other, yet without a direct cause-and-effect relationship, at least onthe surface. They are acausal, from a Latin phrase meaning “without cause.”Going back to the example I mentioned in the first chapter, what does LadyMountbatten liking my father have to do with my reading Sinclair Lewis, or mybeing inspired by my best friend, Oppo? There is no connection, other than thatthey are all part of my history, which led me to my particular destiny. Not oneof those events caused the other events to occur. Lady Mountbatten did not ordermy father to give me a Sinclair Lewis book, and yet those two incidents workedtogether to shape my destiny. They were all connected at a deeper level.We cannot even imagine the complex forces behind every event that occurs in ourlives. There’s a conspiracy of coincidences that weaves the web of karma ordestiny and creates an individual’s personal life—mine, or yours. The onlyreason we don’t experience synchronicity in our daily lives is that we do notlive from the level where it is happening. Usually we see only cause-and-effectrelationships: This causes that, which causes this, which causes that—lineartrajectories. Yet beneath the surface, something else is happening. Invisible tous is a whole web of connections. As it becomes apparent, we see how ourintentions are woven into this web, which is much more context-bound, much morerelational, much more holistic, much more nurturing than our surface experience.Very often we fall into ruts in our lives; we maintain the same routines and actin the same manner predictably day after day after day. We set our minds on acertain course of action, and simply proceed. How can miracles happen if wemarch mindlessly, unthinking and unaware, through our lives? Coincidences arelike road flares, calling our attention to something important in our lives,glimpses of what goes on beyond everyday distractions. We can choose to ignorethose flares and hurry on, or we can pay attention to them and live out themiracle that is waiting for us.When I was finishing my medical training, I knew that my interest was inneuro-endocrinology, the study of how brain chemicals work. Even then, I couldsee that this was a place where science and consciousness met, and I wanted toexplore it. I applied for a fellowship to train with one of the world’s mostprominent endocrinologists. This highly respected scientist was doing NobelPrize–worthy work, and I was eager for the opportunity to learn from him. Out ofthousands of applicants, I was one of six selected to work with him that year.Shortly after I started, I realized that his laboratory was more about egogratification than about real science. We technicians were treated likemachines, expected to mass-produce publishable research papers. It was tediousand unsatisfying. And it was terribly disillusioning to work with someone sofamous, so respected, and still manage to feel as unhappy as I did. I had takenthe position with such idealism, and I found myself doing nothing but injectingrats with chemicals all day long.Every morning I scanned the Boston Globe newspaper want ads, aware of mydisappointment, but thinking that this path I was on was the only way to go. Iremember reading a little advertisement for a position in a local hospitalemergency room. In fact, every day when I opened the newspaper, I would see thatlittle ad. Even if I was only flipping through the paper quickly, it would fallopen to that same page with that same ad. I would look at it and then push itout of my mind. Deep inside, I could imagine myself working in the emergencyroom and actually helping people, instead of injecting chemicals into rats, butmy dream had been to land this fellowship with the renowned endocrinologist.One day that endocrinologist addressed me in a cruel and demeaning manner. Weargued, and I walked away to the lounge to calm myself down. On the table wasthe Boston Globe newspaper, opened to the page with the little want ad—that samead that I had ignored for weeks. The coincidence was too powerful to ignore.Everything finally clicked into place. I knew I was in the wrong place doing thewrong thing. I was fed up with the routine, with the ego of thatendocrinologist, with the rats, with the feeling that I was not doing what wasin my heart to do. I walked back into his office and quit. He followed me outinto the parking lot, screaming at the top of his lungs that my career wasruined, that he would see to it that no one would ever hire me.With his voice still ringing in my ears, I drove directly to that littleemergency room, applied for the position, and started work that very day. Forthe first time, I got to treat and help people who were really suffering. Forthe first time in a long time, I was happy. The Boston Globe ad had beenbeckoning me for weeks, but I had ignored it. Finally I noticed the coincidenceand I was able to change my destiny. Even though laboratory work seemed to bethe very thing I had been striving for all my life, paying attention to thiscoincidence allowed me to break my habitual patterns. It was a message just forme, my life’s personal road flare. Everything I had done up to that point wassimply preparation for that change. Some people thought the endocrinologyfellowship itself was a mistake. But if I hadn’t gotten the fellowship, I mightnot have been in Boston. And if I wasn’t working in the endocrinologist’s lab, Imight not have seen that ad and I might never have felt my heart’s true calling.Endless details had to fall into place in order for this part of my life to playout the way it has.According to a poem by Rumi, one of my favorite poets and philosophers, “This isnot the real reality. The real reality is behind the curtain. In truth, we arenot here. This is our shadow.” What we experience as everyday reality is merelya shadow play. Behind the curtain there is a soul, living and dynamic andimmortal, beyond the reach of space and time. By acting from that level, we canconsciously influence our destiny. This happens through the synchronization ofseemingly acausal relationships to mold a destiny—hence, synchrodestiny. Insynchrodestiny, we consciously participate in the creation of our lives byunderstanding the world that is beyond our senses, the world of the soul.THE COINCIDENCE OFUNIVERSENothing—absolutely nothing—would exist were it not for a remarkable set ofcoincidences. I once read an article by a physicist describing the Big Bang thatgave birth to our universe. In that moment, the number of particles created wasslightly more than the number of antiparticles. The particles and theantiparticles then collided and annihilated each other, filling the universewith photons. Because of the initial imbalance, there were a few particles leftafter the annihilation and these created what we know as the material world. Youand I and the rest of the universe, including all the stars and galaxies, areleftover stuff from the moment of creation. The total number of particles leftover was 1080 (that’s the number 1 followed by 80 zeros). If the number ofparticles had been even slightly greater, gravitational forces would have forcedthe young universe to collapse on itself, forming one huge black hole, whichwould mean no you, no me, no stars, or galaxies. If the number ofmatter-particles had been even slightly smaller, the universe would haveexpanded so fast that there would have been no time for the galaxies to form asthey did.The first atoms were hydrogen. If the strong force that holds the nucleus of anatom were even a fraction percent weaker, deuterium, a stage that hydrogenpasses through before becoming helium, would not have occurred and the universewould have remained pure hydrogen. If, on the other hand, the nuclear forceswere even a fraction stronger, all the hydrogen would have burned rapidly,leaving no fuel for the stars. So just as the gravitational forces needed to beexactly the strength they were, the electromagnetic forces that held electronsin place needed to be exactly as they were—not a fraction more or a fractionless—for stars to evolve into supernovas and for heavy elements to develop.The development of carbon and oxygen, essential for the creation of biologicalorganisms, required many coincidences to occur and to continue to occur from themoment of the Big Bang. That you and I exist, and that the universe with itsstars, galaxies, and planets exists, is a highly improbable event! A totalcoincidence! A miracle, tracking back to the birth of time.If you could have looked out on the universe at any particular point in thattime, you would not have seen the entire pattern that was developing. When starswere forming, you could not have imagined planets, not to mention giraffes andspiders and birds and humans. When sperm met egg to create the human being thatyou are, no one could have imagined the remarkable tale of your life, thefantastic twists and turns of your past, the people you would meet, the childrenyou would bear, the love you would create, the impression you would leave uponthis earth. And yet here you are, living proof of daily miracles. Just becausewe cannot observe miracles the way we marvel over magic tricks—withinstantaneous gratification—does not mean that they are not occurring. Manymiracles take time to be revealed and appreciated.Here’s another example from my life, one that illustrates the slow mechanics ofsynchronicity. It started one day when I was about ten or eleven years old andmy father took me and my brother to see a cricket match between India and theWest Indies. The Caribbean countries had amazing cricketers, some of whom couldhurl the ball 95 miles an hour. During that game, India was being walloped bythe West Indies, down by five wickets for a few runs, which is a disaster incricket. And then two young players came on the scene. To protect their privacyI’ll call them Saleem and Mohan.They were amazing. They civilized the game, defended every ball, and scored“sixers” at every turn. Because of them, the India team went on to win thisabsolutely impossible match. There were near-riots in the stadium fromcelebration. People burned the wickets. For my brother and me, these twocricketers became our heroes. All we did was dream of cricket. We created acricket club, and we started a scrapbook to collect information about Mohan andSaleem.Forty years later, three friends and I were traveling in Australia. We couldn’tget a taxi to the airport because they were overwhelmed with business due to acricket match going on between the Australia and West Indies teams. We couldn’teven hire a car because they were all taken. Eventually, the hotel conciergetold us that there was a limousine going to the airport—there were other peoplein it, but they didn’t mind sharing. We felt lucky to find a ride and got in thelimo. Inside were a woman named Kamla and another man. As we drove to theairport, every once in a while we would hear the driver of the limo screamingand we wondered what was going on. He told us that the West Indies was soundlybeating the Australia cricket team. At that moment, my consciousness was totallyflooded by memories of that childhood match. It was such an amazing feeling thatI shared it with my fellow passengers. The match had taken place decadesearlier, but I could still describe it in every detail.When we finally got to the airport ticket counter, the clerk told Kamla that herflight wasn’t scheduled until the following afternoon. She had come on the wrongday! She asked if she could get a flight that day, but no, they were allcompletely booked. She called her hotel to arrange another night’s stay, butthey, too, were full thanks to the cricket match. So we suggested that she comewith us to Brisbane. One of my friends told Kamla about the conspiracy ofimprobabilities, how coincidences were clues to the will of the universe. Sheended up joining us on our flight. On the plane, the Indian fellow sitting on myleft recognized me and pulled out a copy of one of my books, The Seven SpiritualLaws of Success. He asked me if I would sign it. I asked his name, and he said,“Ramu.” I said, “Okay, Ramu. What’s your last name?” He said, “Menon.” I said,“You’re not Mohan Menon’s son, are you?” He said he was. Mohan Menon was my herodecades ago at that cricket match with my brother! We ended up talking for twohours. I was totally overcome with emotion. For me, it was like talking with theson of Babe Ruth. I asked if he played cricket, and he said not now, but in histime he had played with some great cricketers. When I asked whom he played with,he said, “Ravi Mehra.” As soon as he said that, Kamla, sitting behind me,squealed. Ravi Mehra was her brother. When they started talking, it turned outthat they each had business contacts the other could use, and were later able tohelp each other in a way that brought both of them considerable wealth. And Iwas the lucky catalyst in transforming the lives of these two strangers whom Ihad just met! Some forty years after that first cricket match, the complex andunforeseeable web of relationships created fresh opportunities. You never knowhow and when any life experience will reappear. You never know when acoincidence will lead to the opportunity of a lifetime.ATTENTION AND INTENTIONConsciousness orchestrates its activity in response to both attention andintention. Whatever you put your attention on becomes energized. Whatever youtake your attention away from dwindles. On the other hand, intention is the keyto transformation, as we have seen. So you could say that attention activatesthe energy field, and intention activates the information field, which causestransformation.Every time you speak you transmit information through an energy field usingsound waves. Every time you send or receive e-mail, you use both information andenergy. There is information in the words you select, and the energy is theelectromagnetic impulse that travels through cyberspace. Information and energyare inseparably connected.Have you ever noticed how, when you start paying attention to a particular wordor color or object, that very thing seems to appear more often in yourenvironment? My first car was a Volkswagen Beetle. I never really paid muchattention to cars, and I rarely noticed Volkswagens on the road. But after Ibought my Beetle, I saw them everywhere. It seemed that every third car on theroad was a red, convertible Beetle! It’s not that these little cars were playinga bigger part in the universe, but my attention to them made anything associatedwith Beetles “pop” into my field of attention.Millions of things happen every day that never penetrate our conscious minds:sounds from the street, conversations of people around us, newspaper articlesthat our eyes quickly scan, patterns on clothing, shoe colors, smells, textures,flavors. Our consciousness can handle only so much information, so we haveselective attention. Whatever we choose to focus our attention on will make itpast the mind’s filtering system. For example, imagine that I’m talking to youat a party. You and I are having an interesting conversation and the rest of theparty is buzzing in the background. But then somebody at the end of the roomstarts talking about you, and suddenly you start listening to what’s being said.The buzz of the party disappears, and even though I might be standing right nextto you talking in your ear, you don’t hear me. Such is the power of attention.In the physical world, we have many different ways of acquiring information:newspapers, books, television, radio, cell phone conversations, shortwaveradios—all these ways of tapping into various kinds of information, and manymore, are readily available to us. You can simply tune in to them with yoursensory apparatus—look, listen, feel, smell, taste the environment around you.But if you want to tap in to the information at the level of the soul, you needa different way to get the information.We don’t normally have our attention in that unseen dimension, but everythingthat’s happening in the visible world has its roots there. Everything isconnected with everything else. In the spiritual world, those connections becomevisible. But in the physical world, we only glimpse the connections in the cluesgiven to us through coincidence. As our attention creates energy, intentionbrings about the transformation of that energy. Attention and intention are themost powerful tools of the spiritually adept. They are the triggers forattracting both a certain kind of energy and a certain kind of information.So the more attention you put on coincidences, the more you attract othercoincidences, which will help you clarify their meaning. Putting your attentionon the coincidence attracts the energy, and then asking the question “What doesit mean?” attracts the information. The answer might come as a certain insight,or intuitive feeling, or an encounter, or a new relationship. You may experiencefour seemingly unrelated coincidences, then watch the evening news and have aninsight. Ah-ha! That’s what they meant for me! The more attention you put oncoincidences and the more you inquire into their significance, the more oftenthe coincidences occur and the more clearly their meaning comes into view. Onceyou can see and interpret the coincidences, your path to fulfillment emerges.In most people’s experience, the past resides only in memory and the futureresides only in imagination. But at the spiritual level, the past and the futureand all the different probabilities of life exist simultaneously. Everything ishappening all at once. It’s as if I’m playing a CD, and the CD has twenty-fivetracks, but at the moment, I’m listening to only track 1. Those other tracks arestill on the CD at this very moment; I’m just not hearing them. And if I’munaware of them, I may assume they don’t exist. If I had a track changer for mylife experience, I could listen to yesterday, today, or tomorrow with equalease. People who are tuned in to the deeper self can access this deeper domainbecause this self is not separate from the universe; the Buddhists say that your“self” is an inter-being that is interlinked with all that exists. You areinseparably part of the cosmic quantum soup.NURTURING COINCIDENCENow we know that putting your attention on coincidences attracts morecoincidences, and applying intention reveals their meaning. In this waycoincidences become clues to the will of the universe, providing a way for us tosee its synchronicity and take advantage of life’s boundless opportunities. Butwith billions of different pieces of information coming at us at any given time,how do we know what to put our attention on? How do you keep from looking formeaning in every cup of tea, or every television commercial, or every glancefrom a stranger on the street? And conversely, how do we keep from missingvaluable opportunities?Those questions cannot be answered simply. Part of learning to livesynchrodestiny is learning to become a sensitive instrument in yoursurroundings. For a moment now, close your eyes. Try to sense everything in yourenvironment. What sounds do you hear? What do you smell, feel, or taste at thisvery moment? Put your attention for a moment on each sense individually and befully aware.If you have not performed this exercise before, you will likely have missed someof these common stimuli—not because they are faint, but because we grow soaccustomed to them that we no longer pay them any mind. For example, what didyou feel? What was the temperature? Was there a breeze, or was the air still?What parts of your body were making contact with the chair you are sitting in?Did you notice the pressure on the backs of your thighs, or on your lower back?What about sounds? Most of us can easily pick out the distant barking of a dog,or the noise of children playing in the next room, but what about more subtlesounds? Could you hear the blowing of the furnace or air conditioner? Could youhear yourself breathing? Your stomach growling? What about the faint hum oftraffic?People who are sensitive to events and stimuli around them will be sensitive tocoincidences sent from the universe. The clues we receive will not always comein the mail or flash on a television screen (although sometimes they will).Clues may be as subtle as the smell of pipe smoke wafting through an openwindow, which makes you think of your father, which reminds you of a book heloved, which then somehow comes to play an important role in your life at themoment.At least once a day, focus for a minute or two on one of your five senses—sight,hearing, taste, touch, smell—and allow yourself to notice as many differentaspects of this sense as possible. Although this will take effort initially,you’ll soon find yourself doing it naturally. Close off other senses if you findthem too distracting. For example, try eating different foods while holding yournose and closing your eyes; focus on the texture of the food, without beingdistracted by sight or smell.The most powerful and unusual stimuli will naturally draw your attention. Thoseare the things in your environment you need to look at most closely. And themore unlikely the coincidence, the more potent the clue. If you are consideringgetting married, becoming more aware of advertisements for wedding rings is aminor coincidence because these advertisements are abundant. But having a bannerreading JOANNA, MARRY ME fly over your head while you are considering proposingto Joanna is highly unlikely, and a very powerful message about the path theuniverse has planned for you.When a coincidence arises, don’t ignore it. Ask yourself, What is the messagehere? What is the significance of this? You don’t need to go digging for theanswers. Ask the question, and the answers will emerge. They may arrive as asudden insight, a spontaneous creative experience, or they may be something verydifferent. Perhaps you will meet a person who is somehow related to thecoincidence that occurred. An encounter, a relationship, a chance meeting, asituation, a circumstance will immediately give you a clue to its meaning. “Oh,so that’s what it was all about!”Consider how my final-straw argument with the endocrinologist finally gavemeaning to the Boston Globe want ad I had been noticing but not attending to.The key is to pay attention and inquire.Another thing you can do to nurture coincidence is to keep a diary or journal ofcoincidences in your life. After years of note-taking, I classify coincidencesas tiny, medium, whoppers, and double-whoppers. You can do this in any way thatis easy for you. For some people, it is easiest to maintain a daily journal andunderline or highlight words or phrases or names of things that show up ascoincidences. Other people keep a special coincidence diary. They start a newpage for each significant coincidence, then jot down any other connections tothat event on its page.For people who want to delve deeply into coincidence, one of the processes Irecommend is recapitulation. This is a way of putting yourself in the positionof observer of your life, and of your dreams, so that connections and themes andimages and coincidences become clearer. Because our connection to the universalsoul is much more obvious when we are dreaming, this process allows you toaccess a whole new level of coincidences.When you go to bed at night, before you fall asleep, sit up for a few minutesand imagine that you are witnessing on the screen of your consciousnesseverything that happened during the day. See your day as a movie. Watch yourselfwaking up in the morning, brushing your teeth, having breakfast, driving towork, conducting your business, coming home, eating dinner—everything in yourday right up to bedtime. There is no need to analyze what you see, or evaluate,or judge . . . just watch the movie. See it all. You may even notice things thatdid not strike you as important at the time. You may notice that the color ofthe hair of the woman behind the drugstore counter was the same as your mother’swhen you were young. Or you might pay special attention to a little child whowas crying as his mother was dragging him down a supermarket aisle. It’s amazingthe things that show up in the movie of your day that you may not haveconsciously noted during the day itself.As you watch your day go by in the movie, take this opportunity to view yourselfobjectively. You may find yourself doing something that you’re particularlyproud of, or at times you may notice yourself doing things that areembarrassing. Again, the goal is not to evaluate, but to get little insightsinto the protagonist’s behavior—this character that is your self.When the recapitulation is over—which can take as little as five minutes or aslong as a half hour—say to yourself, “Everything that I’ve witnessed, this movieof a day in my life, is now safely stored away. I can summon those images on thescreen of my consciousness but as soon as I let them go, they disappear.” Themovie is over. Then, as you go to sleep, say to yourself, “Just as I nowrecapitulated the day, I am giving instructions to my soul, my spirit, mysubconscious to witness my dreams.” Initially you may not notice much of achange. But if you practice this every night for a few weeks, you will start tohave a very clear experience that the dream is the scenery, and you are theperson watching it all. When you wake up in the morning, recapitulate the night,just as you recapitulated the day at night.Once you are able to recall the movie of your dreams, write down some of themore memorable scenes. Include them in your journal. Make a special note ofcoincidences. Nonlocal intelligence provides clues in our sleep just as it doesin our waking hours. During the day I meet people, I have interactions, I findmyself in situations or circumstances, events, relationships . . . and in thenight I also find myself in those situations. The difference is that in the day,there seems to be a logical, rational explanation for what happens. Our dreamsare not only projections of our own consciousness; they are, in fact, how weinterpret our life paths. The mechanics of the dream and the mechanics of whatis happening to us in the so-called reality are the same projections of thesoul. We are merely witnesses.What starts to happen, then, is that gradually we see correlations, images thatrepeat themselves both in dreams and in everyday reality. More coincidencesprovide more clues to guide our behavior. We start to enjoy more opportunities.We have more “good luck.” These clues point out the direction to take our lives.Through this process of recapitulation we see recurring patterns and we start tounravel life’s mystery.This process is especially helpful for departing from destructive habits. Lifehas certain themes that it plays out. Sometimes those themes operate to ouradvantage. Sometimes they work against us, especially if we repeat the samepatterns or themes, over and over, hoping to get a different result. Forexample, many people who get divorced fall in love again, but they end up inexactly the same kind of relationship they were in before. They repeat the sametrauma, relive the same anguish, and then they say, “Why does this keephappening to me?” The process of recapitulation can help us witness thesepatterns, and once we discern them, we can make more conscious choices.Journaling isn’t absolutely necessary, but it helps bring insights andcoincidences to the surface.So remain sensitive, observe coincidences during both your daytime living andyour nighttime dreaming, and pay special attention to anything that breaks theprobability amplitude—the statistical likelihood of a space-time event. We allneed to plan things to some extent, to make assumptions about tomorrow eventhough we actually don’t know what’s going to happen. Anything that upsets ourplans, anything that takes us off the trajectory we think we are on, can providea major insight. Even the absence of events that you expect can be clues to theintent of the universe. People who have a hard time getting out of bed in themorning to go to a job they hate, who find it difficult to become engaged intheir professional activities, who feel emotionally “dead” after a day at theoffice, need to pay attention to those feelings. These are important signalsthat there must be a way to get more fulfillment out of life. Perhaps a miraclelies in the wings. You’ll never know unless you form an intention, becomesensitive to the clues from the universe, follow the chain of coincidence, andhelp create the destiny you most desire.Of course, life can be difficult, and we each have daily chores,responsibilities, and obligations that can become overwhelming. Coincidences maycome flying at you from all directions, or they may seem to dry up entirely. Howdo you find your way in such a complex world? Take five minutes every day andjust sit in silence. In that time, put these questions to your attention andheart: “Who am I? What do I want for my life? What do I want from my lifetoday?” Then let go, and let your stream of consciousness, your quieter innervoice, supply the answers. Then, after five minutes, write them down. Do thisevery day and you’ll be surprised at how situations, circumstances, events, andpeople will orchestrate themselves around the answers. This is the beginning ofsynchrodestiny.For some people, answering those questions for the first time can be difficult.Many of us are not used to thinking in terms of our own wants and needs, and ifwe do, we certainly don’t expect to fulfill them. If you haven’t defined yourlife’s goal for yourself, what do you do then? It would be helpful if theuniverse would give us one big clue, or a giant compass, if you will, pointingto the direction we should be taking. In fact, the compass is there. To find it,you need only look inside yourself to discover your soul’s purest desire, itsdream for your life. Sit quietly. Once you reveal this desire and understand itsessential nature, then you have a constant beacon, which we can make manifest inthe form of archetypal symbols."},{"pageContent":"6image [../images/00003.jpeg]Desires and ArchetypesWe come now to the heart of synchrodestiny. We have discovered the dual natureof the soul, and we understand that we are fully part of the nonlocalintelligence, just as a wave is part of the ocean. We have learned to see thesynchronicity in all things, the matrix that links us to the source of theuniverse. We have learned to value coincidences as messages from the nonlocalintelligence that point us in the direction of our destiny, and we know that ourintentions can influence this direction. All these revelations are essential forliving a fulfilled life. But when we look for guidance in how to construct oureveryday lives, we still need to answer the central question of self: What aremy dreams and desires? And that can only be answered by asking, in addition, Whoam I? What do I want? What’s my purpose in this lifetime?We know that our deepest relationships and meanings and contexts derive from thesoul. And our aspiration, that grand and wonderful and mythical thing that weyearn to do, also ultimately derives from the soul. In our time here on earth,this individual soul will not be fulfilled unless it completes its mythicalquest, which we can think of as the Grand Plan around which our destinies areorganized. Inside every human being there is an overarching theme, a templatefor heroic living, a god or a goddess in embryo that yearns to be born. This iswho we were meant to be, the self that we deny ourselves because most of uscannot see the field of limitless potential that is open to us. This is our bestself, the egoless self, that bit of the universe acting through us for the goodof all.People who live ordinary, mundane lives have not gotten in touch with themythical being inside them. You can pave the path to enlightenment byunderstanding the plan written on your soul, by nurturing the relationships thatgive you context and meanings, and by enacting your mythical drama. Out of thatis born love and compassion. Out of that comes fulfillment and completion.These mythical stories, these heroes and heroines within, are called archetypes.Archetypes are perennial themes that reside at the level of the collective,universal soul. These themes are representations of our collective soul’syearnings, imagination, and deepest desires. These themes have existed forever.We see them in the writings of ancient cultures, in literature throughout theages. Their shapes shift depending on where we are in history, but their coreremains the same. These archetypes are enacted in modern-day movies, televisionsoap operas, and tabloid newspapers. Anytime a person or character is “biggerthan life,” we are seeing the enactment of an archetype. These characters areusually presented as uncomplicated, with purity of intent, regardless of whatthat intent may be. Divine or diabolical, sacred or profane, the sinner or thesaint, the adventurer, the sage, the seeker, the rescuer, the love object, theredeemer—all are exaggerated expressions of the conscious energy of thecollective soul.Archetypes are born of the collective soul, but they are enacted by individualsouls. Their mythical dramas play out daily in our physical world. We can lookat Marilyn Monroe and easily see the embodiment of Aphrodite, a goddess of sexand beauty. We can see Robert Downey Jr. as the embodiment of Dionysus orBacchus, the untamed, fun-loving spirit. Princess Diana was Artemis, thenonconformist, the wild one, the rule breaker, the fearless warrior who fightsfor what she believes.Every human being is attuned to some archetype, or two or three archetypes.Every one of us is hardwired at the level of the soul to enact or modelarchetypal characteristics. They are seeds sown within us. When a seed sprouts,it releases the patterning forces that allow it to grow into a certain type ofplant. A tomato seed will always grow to be a tomato plant, not a rosebush. Theactivation of an archetype releases its patterning forces that allow us tobecome more of what we already are destined to be. And our individual archetypesare reflected in our desires or intentions. So, who are you? What do you want?What is the purpose of your existence? At the deepest level these questions areasked of the soul. And to find the answers you must speak to that part of thesoul that is unique to you. And as we do, we learn to define our individualarchetypes.We live in a society that is so totally goal oriented that everything has tohave a label, but this is less helpful when you explore the nature of your soul.Some people call me an author. Others call me a spiritual thinker, or amind-body doctor, or a personal adviser. My children think of me as a father,and my wife sees me as her mate. All these roles help to define me, but who I amis continually emerging as my destiny unfolds. If you label yourself, you becomestuck, like a butterfly caught in a jar. Adopting an archetype is not labelingbecause it is not about limitations. Quite the opposite. Archetypes are lifemodels, images and ideas that guide the direction of your life toward yoursoul’s ultimate destiny. Recognizing your true nature and allowing it to blossomis part of the beauty of living from the level of the soul—you become the heroor heroine of a mythical saga.If we allow ourselves to become swayed by forces in the physical world, whetherthey are well-meaning or not, then we are lured away from our soul’s destiny. Westart to desire things that may not be meant for us; we begin to have intentionsthat do not match up with the intentions of the universe. What do these forceslook like? They can be as innocent as friends giving advice they think is inyour best interest; they can be as pervasive as media messages enticing us tobuy an endless line of products; they can be as seductive as a corner officewith the title of corporate vice president and a seven-figure salary. These aremessages from the physical world, not from the universe. The blueprint that theuniverse intends for you is found at the level of the soul. We get clues in theform of coincidences, and we get guidance in the form of archetypes.So how do you know which destiny is meant for you, and which dream is just theproduct of our mass-market culture? How many little girls dream of being thenext Britney Spears? How many little boys aspire to be the next Michael Jordan?We emulate these celebrities because they are enacting their own archetypes,they succeeded in following their own inner quests. You can begin to know yourown archetypes and your own destiny only by accessing the will of the universalsoul, by looking deep inside and defining your innermost desires, by choosingthe archetype that most closely matches your intentions, and following itsancient pattern.THE PURPOSE OF ARCHETYPESDiscovering archetypes is a highly personal experience. No one can look at you,even if they know you well, and tell you, “Oh, you are this archetype.” Vedicscience, the ancient wisdom tradition of India, says that unless you can get intouch with that embryo of a god or goddess incubating inside you, unless you canlet that embryo be fully born, then your life will always be mundane. But oncethat god or goddess expresses itself through you, then you will do grand andwondrous things.These days, we tend to seek symbolic archetypes in celebrities, but we need tonurture a full expression of the archetypes in ourselves. They are part of whatcreates us. This is the stuff our dreams are made of. This is the stuff ofmythology, of campfire stories, of legends. This is what inspires great movies.In Star Wars Luke Skywalker is the expression of the archetype of the eternaladventurer, willing to take risks to explore the unknown. Princess Leia is likeArtemis, the independent huntress, the protector. Yoda is the wise seer, thekeeper of powerful knowledge who is connected to the nonlocal intelligence.These are figures of our collective imagination, ancient archetypes infuturistic form.Archetypes are vital to understanding and defining who we are, individualexpressions of a collective consciousness. Mythology is the wellspring of ourcivilization. One of the consequences of depriving people of mythology is thatthey join street gangs. Why? Because gangs have a leader, they have rituals,they have initiation rites—the stuff of mythology. Our children are joininggangs in search of a mythical experience. Whenever somebody does anythingremarkable—when astronauts walk on the moon, when a pilot embarks on the firstsolo flight across the Atlantic—these are mythical quests, Jason in search ofthe Golden Fleece, Icarus soaring in his wings of feathers and wax. FromPersephone’s abduction by Pluto to Orpheus seeking his bride among the shades ofHades, to Apollo, Krishna, and all the stories of Celtic mythology—this is thedeepest wellspring of civilization and identity.Gangs and movies and soap operas and celebrities are seductive precisely becausethey strike this mythic chord. But they are second-class substitutes formythology. Real archetypes are enacted by people like Mahatma Gandhi, MartinLuther King Jr., Rosa Parks, anyone who reaches beyond daily life into the realmof the wondrous. They are able to achieve greatness because they tapped into thecollective consciousness, which gave them the ability to see several event linessimultaneously and predict the future based on choices in the moment. They saythat when Mahatma Gandhi was thrown out of the train in Durban, South Africa, heclosed his eyes and saw the British Empire crumbling halfway across the world.That one episode changed the course of history.These events create a shift in cognitive and perceptual mechanisms. Normallythis hardware allows us to see only what’s happening here, right in front of us.But from time to time we can awaken dormant potentialities and the wisdom to usethem. In Sanskrit, these are referred to as siddhis, which means supernormalpowers—extrasensory perception, synchronicity, telepathy—all products of thenonlocal domain. These are the powers that bloom as myth.FINDING YOUR ARCHETYPESThe process of finding an archetype should be joyous. Don’t worry about choosingunwisely. Because archetypes spring from the collective consciousness, everyarchetype is present in every one of us. But some archetypes are representedmore strongly. Your goal is to find the one, two, or even three archetypes thatresonate with you most powerfully, those that represent your heart. Do notchoose who you wish to be, or even which qualities you most admire, but seek outthe qualities that you feel drawn to, that motivate you, that inspire you. Youwill know them when you find them. Best of all, there are no wrong answers.To help you on your search, try the following exercise, which has been modifiedfrom the work of my friend Jean Houston, author of A Mythic Life: Learning toLive Our Greater Story. She has many other exercises in her books, which Ihighly recommend. Get comfortable and clear your mind. Ideally, the followingparagraphs would be read to you while your eyes are closed; if possible recordthem on tape or CD and play them back so you can imagine the scenes moreclearly. But reading with a clear and open mind can work, too.Start by taking a few deep breaths. Slowly inhale and exhale, releasing anytension or tightness or resistance that you’re carrying in your body. Keeptaking slow, deep, smooth breaths, allowing each exhalation to take you to adeeper, quieter, and more relaxed place.Now imagine that you are walking along a beautiful, tree-lined country path, farfrom the turbulence of the city. You observe the lush countryside as you strollalong, with birds soaring overhead, white-tailed rabbits scampering across thepath, and butterflies fluttering about. You come to a clearing and you notice acharming, rustic cottage with a thatched roof. The door is open and welcoming.You look inside and see a den and a hallway leading to the back of the house.You feel very safe and comfortable here, as if you’re returning to your ownhome, and you begin to walk down the hallway into a small room. You notice acloset door, which you open. Pushing aside the clothes, you discover an openingat the back of the closet. Moving through the opening, you find that it leads toan ancient stone staircase, which winds down and around, down and around. Thelight is dim, so you carefully descend, one step at a time, holding onto therailing and being very careful not to fall, descending deeper and deeper anddeeper. You finally reach the bottom of the stairway and you find yourself atthe edge of a broad river reflecting rays of silvery moonlight. Sitting by theside of the river, you listen to its hushed passage and gaze into thestar-filled eternity of the night sky.Off in the distance you see a small boat sailing toward you. It glides up, and afigure shrouded in linen robes stands in the boat and beckons you to enter.Feeling safe and protected, you step aboard and you’re given a flowing garment,decorated with ancient symbols, to change into. The boat sails through a narrowtunnel, which seems to go on forever. The bearded boatman in the stern beginschanting some unfamiliar mantras, and after a few moments you notice that yoursenses have become much more alert. You’re relaxed yet curiously exhilarated.A light appears at the end of the tunnel and grows brighter. As you move closerto the light, you become aware that it is an invitation to enter the virtualrealm. As you accept, and immerse yourself in the light, you suddenly findyourself becoming weightless. You begin floating off the boat and experienceyourself merging with this nourishing light. You become this light. You are nowa virtual being, a sphere of pulsating light. From this realm of purepotentiality, you can emerge into quantum and material reality in any form orshape, and at any location in space-time that you choose.You reach into the depths of your light being and emerge as the goddess Hera,Queen of Olympus and all the gods of Greece, the symbol of regal power andbeauty. You’re in command of the world, filled with confidence and authority.Your subjects rely upon your certainty and strength. You are the ultimateexpression of self-assurance. Feel what it is like to have the consciousness ofthis powerful goddess. Feel the sensations of moving in her body. Feel what itis like to have her gestures, to have her speech, her facial expressions. Lookat the world through her eyes. Hear the world through her ears.Now bid farewell to this goddess and return to your virtual light form. Onceagain you’re in the realm of pure potential, pulsating with possibilities. Reachinto the depths of your light being and emerge as the wise old king, skilled inthe ways of navigating the storms of life. You are the bearded sage, the greatrishi who sees the forms and phenomena of the world as a cosmic dance. You arein this world but not of it, and each of your thoughts, words, and actionsexpresses absolute impeccability. Feel what it is like to have the consciousnessof a sage. Your mind is the mind of a seer. Feel what it is like to have histhoughts, his speech, and his gestures. See the world through his eyes.Now release the seer and again merge back into your essence as a virtual lightbeing. Reach into your depths and emerge as the redeemer. You are the light ofcompassion, radiant with forgiveness and hope. Your very presence dispels thedarkness, no matter how foreboding it may seem. You are the essence of avatars,the essence of Christ, of Buddha. Your very nature transforms experience intofaith. Witness the thoughts that arise in the mind of the redeemer. Feel theemotions in the heart of the redeemer. Experience the world through the eyes ofthe redeemer, overflowing with compassion and love for all sentient beings.Now release the redeemer and return to your primordial essence. You are avirtual light being, a distilled pool of universal energy. You are the fullpotential of all that was, is, and will be. Reach into the depths of this lightnature and emerge as the divine mother. You are the essential nurturing force,alive with life-giving energy. You are Demeter, Shakti, the feminine face ofGod. You are the divine mother, bestowing your loving kindness on all sentientbeings. You are the primordial creative force, giving birth to forms andphenomena. Experience the consciousness of the divine mother. Feel the feelingsof the divine mother. See creation through her eyes. Hear creation through herears. Inhale and exhale the breath of the divine mother.Now release the divine mother. Resume your essential nature as pure light, theprimordial virtual energy, alive with possibilities to manifest anything youchoose to become. Plunge into the depths of your being and emerge as Dionysus,the god of sensuality, of ecstasy and intoxication, the god of excess andabandon. You are the personification of total surrender into the moment. Yournature is to hold nothing back, to immerse yourself in the experience of beingalive. You are drunk with love. Experience the world with the consciousness ofDionysus. Feel intoxication. Perceive the world through Dionysian eyes. Hear themusic of the universe as a celebration of your being. Give yourself over to theecstasy of the senses and of the spirit.Now release Dionysus and merge back into your primordial energy state of purevirtual light. Find the impulse of wisdom and intelligence within your infinitepotential and emerge as the goddess of wisdom, Saraswati or Athena. You’re theprotector of civilization with your commitment to knowledge, wisdom, the arts,and scientific knowledge. You’re a true spiritual warrior, dedicated todestroying any ignorance that impedes the expression of truth. Experience theconsciousness of a goddess of wisdom. Look at the world through her eyes; hearthe prevailing conversation through her ears. You are refinement, you areelegance, and you are civility and wisdom at its highest value.And now let go of the goddess of wisdom. Return to your original state of purevirtual light. Merge back into your unbounded, unmanifest being, pulsing withpotential. Dive into your essential light essence and emerge as Aphrodite, asVenus, the goddess of love and beauty. You’re the embodiment of sensuality,passion, and sexuality. In your presence, sentient beings lose their heads andcrave the rapture of Eros. Express and experience the consciousness of thegoddess of love. Experience the body of the goddess of sensuality. Savor hersensuality. See the world through the eyes of the goddess of love.Now release the love goddess, returning into your core as light, as pureundifferentiated being, as infinite possibilities. Dive deeply into your essenceand emerge as the holy child, the expression of pure divine potential. You arethe incarnation of innocence embodying the expectation of unconditional love,both as giver and as receiver. You are born of divine parents, and you are ripewith destiny and cosmic potential. Observe the world through the eyes of theholy child. Feel the love flowing through your heart of innocence. Experienceyour playfulness as a child of light, rejoicing in your own being.Release the holy child. Experience yourself as a virtual light being. Rest inyour boundlessness. You’re a throbbing heartbeat of energy, capable of creatinganything you desire. Dive deeply into your light core and emerge as the cosmicalchemist. You’re the ultimate magician, capable of turning nothing intosomething and something into nothingness. You know the world of the senses to benonsensical. You experience the material world as an expression of yourconscious energy, which you can transform into matter with your intention andattention. You can assume any form you choose, living or inanimate, because youare consciousness in all its disguises. You are Krishna; you are infinitepossibilities. Experience yourself as Krishna, the cosmic alchemist, capable ofmanifesting anything you choose. Experience yourself transmuting your thoughtsinto phenomena. See the universe through the eyes of Krishna. Experience thecosmos as your body. You are not in the universe; the universe is in you.Now for the next few minutes, play with your creative energy, manifestingyourself as any form you choose. It may be one of the common archetypes we havejust reviewed, or it may not. Become any being you would like to experience.Assume the consciousness of a great artist or musician. Experience the world asa powerful political leader. Become an eagle; experience the world as a soaringbird. Become a whale and experience the consciousness of a playful underwaterbeing. There are no limits to your possible expressions. Enjoy your virtualself, exuberant with the knowledge and experience of your infinite potential. Inthis form you are all the many gods and goddesses, archetypes, and mythicalimages in one body. For the next few moments, allow any images, any phrases, anysymbols, any words that arise to take shape in your consciousness.When you feel that you have experienced a wide range of interestingpossibilities, choose three archetypal images or symbols or words or phrasesthat resonate within you, that inspire and motivate you. They could be familiargods or goddesses known to you, images, animals, symbols of the elements, forcesof the cosmos, words, phrases, or any other quality that means something to you,anything that feels most comfortable when you experienced it in your mind. Youshould feel that if these people or qualities could come into your world andexpress themselves through you, you would be capable of grand and wondrousthings. I always recommend that men choose at least one female or femininearchetype, and that women choose at least one male or masculine archetype. Weall have both masculine and feminine qualities inside us, and to ignore oneparticular side of our selves is to smother that source of personal passion.Write down your three symbols or archetypes. Then, begin to collect artwork orpictures or symbols or jewelry that remind you of this archetype. Some peoplecreate a small altar for their archetypes as a place to center the search forself. If the principal qualities of your archetypes can be expressed in words orphrases, write them on a piece of paper so that you have something to remind youof them. At least once a day, preferably after meditation, look at thesereminders and silently issue them an invitation: “Please come and expressyourself through me.” Let them be a reminder of your life’s inspiration. Whenyou feel lost or distracted in the world, they will be your compass back to yourtrue self.Instead of following the latest fashion trend or emulating a movie star, modelyourself, your thoughts, and your actions on your archetypes. People do thisevery day, without even realizing what it is they are doing. Have you ever heardthe question “What would Jesus do?” Christians who feel stuck at a crossroads intheir lives or who have to make a decision about how to act are encouraged toask themselves that question. It is a way of using the powerful archetype of theredeemer, as embodied by Jesus Christ, as a life guide. Use your personalarchetypes in the same way. Ask yourself, “Am I acting in a way that would beconsistent with my archetypes?” This is a profound way of asking, “Am I beingtrue to myself?” You will find fulfillment through your archetypes by allowingthe gods/goddesses/totems/personalities to enact their drama through you. Theyare the keys to your true and miraculous destiny."},{"pageContent":"image [../images/00006.jpeg]"},{"pageContent":"7image [../images/00003.jpeg]Meditation and MantrasThe most powerful tool we have for learning to live synchrodestiny, to see theconnective patterns of the universe, to make miracles out of our desires, ismeditation. Meditation allows us to place our attention and intention in thesemore subtle planes, giving us access to all that unseen, untapped informationand energy.If your doctor gave you a prescription to walk for twenty minutes twice a day,and told you that those walks alone would lead to good health, peace of mind,freedom from worry, increased success in your personal and professional life,would you follow her recommendation? Most people would at least give it a try.The synchrodestiny prescription is to meditate for fifteen to twenty minutestwice a day, followed by a moment of extending an invitation to your archetypes(as described in the previous chapter). If you do that twice a day, you’ll startto see a transformation in your life. Beyond that, conduct yourself just as youalways have before. Meditate in the morning, live the rest of your day, and thenmeditate again in the evening. That alone will start you on the road totransforming your life and creating the miracles you want.Everything that you have read in this book has been preparation for the actualpractice of meditation that will lead you to enlightenment and livingsynchrodestiny. That background isn’t necessary; it’s just fun. If everyoneneeded to understand quantum physics to get enlightened, then only quantumphysicists would attain enlightenment. As it happens, the great pioneers ofquantum physics also advanced the cause of spirit by questioning the deepermeaning of life. Some of these remarkable scientists include Wolfgang Pauli, whoalong with Carl Jung first spoke about synchronicity. Erwin Schrödinger, PaulDirac, Werner Heisenberg, Max Planck, David Bohm, and John Wheeler are otherswho felt that quantum physics could never be understood unless we includedconsciousness as a primary component of fundamental reality. But you don’t needto understand religion, or philosophy, or science to access spirit. All you needto do is pay attention to the following instructions.Meditation is a simple process that is difficult to describe, but is very easyto do once you begin to practice it regularly. Here I will present the basics ofmeditation so that you can successfully apply the principles of synchrodestinydescribed in the rest of the book.HOW TO MEDITATEOur minds are constantly active, always jumping from thought to thought, emotionto emotion. Getting in touch with the nonlocal intelligence, the universal soulthat lies within us and is part of us all, requires finding a way past the fogof distracting thoughts that typically hide it from us. We cannot fight our waythrough that barrier any more than we can fight our way through a real fog. Ifyou want to see across the street on a foggy day, nothing you can do physicallywill help. You must wait, patiently and calmly, for the fog to thin and lift onits own. Once in a while, a clear patch will emerge, and you can glimpse whatlies ahead. The same is true of thoughts. If we are quiet, we encounter momentsof pure silence—I call them thought “gaps”—and through these gaps we can glimpsethe deeper level of the soul. Each glimpse increases our understanding, andeventually our consciousness becomes expanded.The purpose of meditation is to stop thinking for a time, wait for the fog ofthought to thin, and glimpse the spirit within. Controlling the flood ofthoughts is very difficult for most people. Beginners can sometimes become veryfrustrated, but frustration is just another thought, another emotion that getsin the way. The goal is to release all thoughts, quietly, passively.A common way to begin meditation is to gently focus on one thing so that itbecomes more difficult for stray thoughts to enter your mind. I like to startwith a breathing meditation.To begin meditation, find a comfortable position. Sit in a comfortable chair,with your feet flat on the ground. Place your hands in your lap with the palmsfacing upward. Close your eyes and begin witnessing your breath. Observe theinflow and outflow of your breath without attempting to control it in any way.You may find that your breathing spontaneously gets faster or slower, deeper orshallower, and may even pause for a time. Observe the changes without resistanceor anticipation. Whenever your attention drifts away from your breath to a soundin the environment, or a sensation in your body, or a thought in your mind,gently return your awareness to your breathing.This is the basic meditation. Once a person becomes comfortable with simplysitting quietly and focusing on breathing, I recommend adding a mantra, whichcreates a mental environment that will allow you to expand your consciousness.MANTRASThe word mantra has two components to it: man, which is the root sound of theword mind, and tra, which is the root sound of the word instrument. So, the wordmantra literally means an instrument of the mind. The ancient wisdom traditionof Vedanta examined the various sounds produced in nature, the fundamentalvibrations of the world around us. According to Vedanta, these sounds are anexpression of the infinite or cosmic mind, and provide the basis for every humanlanguage. For example, if you sound out all the letters of the alphabet, thevowels and the consonants, you’ll hear that these are the same sounds that allbabies make spontaneously. These sounds also contain the same vibrations thatanimals make. And if you listen carefully, you’ll notice that these sounds areeverywhere in nature. These are the sounds of the wind, of fire crackling, ofthunder, of the river rushing by, of ocean waves crashing on the shore. Natureis vibration. The infinite being vibrates, and that vibration is rhythmic,musical, and primordial. Vibration is the means through which infinite potentialexpresses itself as the manifest universe.We know that the manifest universe—which appears to be made up of solidobjects—is actually made up of vibrations, with different objects vibrating atdifferent frequencies. Of course, if I kick a large rock, I don’t feelvibration. I feel pain. But the fact is that the foot that feels the pain andthe brain that records the pain are also vibration. Vibration interacts withvibration, and we interpret that as matter and sensation. Mantra is just a wordthat describes this quality of the universe.The ancient seers are said to have heard these vibrations of the universe whenthey were in deep meditation. We can all hear these same vibrations any time. Itis very simple. If you quiet your mind and sit silently, you will hearvibrations. You can try it any time you want. Even when you cover your ears,you’ll hear them. Your body is also constantly vibrating, but the sounds are sosubtle that you usually don’t hear them. But if you sit quietly when there is nonoise around you, you’ll hear a background hum in the air. And if you startpaying attention to that background hum, with practice you’ll actually end uphearing all the mantras that have been recorded in the Vedic literature.The Vedas also maintain that if you recite a mantra out loud, its specialpattern of vibrations creates its own effects, and can create events in ourcurrent physical realm. Reciting the mantra mentally creates a mental vibration,which then becomes more abstract. Ultimately it takes you into the field of pureconsciousness or spirit from where the vibration arose. So a mantra is a verygood way to transcend and go back to the source of thought, which is pureconsciousness. This is why specific mantras are recommended—because of thespecific vibrations they induce.The mantra I use, and that I recommend for achieving synchrodestiny, is thesimple mantra “so-hum.” This is the mantra of the breath; if you observe yourbreathing you’ll hear “so-hum” as air moves in and out of your lungs. As youinhale, the sound of that vibration is “so.” And as you exhale, the soundbecomes “hum.” If you want, you can experiment with this. Inhale deeply, closeyour eyes and your mouth, and exhale forcefully through your nose. If youconcentrate, you’ll hear the “hum” sound quite clearly.One of the techniques of meditation is, in fact, simply focusing on where yourbreath comes from. With your eyes closed, inhale and think the word “so”; on theexhale, think the word “hum.” Gradually both the breath and the sound willbecome quieter and quieter and quieter, and the breath becomes so quiet that italmost seems to stop. By quieting your breath, you quiet your mind. When youtranscend, the mantra “so-hum” entirely disappears, and your breath pausesmomentarily. Time itself comes to a stop and you’re in the field of pureconsciousness, the nonlocal domain, spirit, the ground of being.The mantra, then, is a way to experience nonlocal consciousness. Aborigines,Indians, Native Americans, and many other traditional cultures have used it forthousands of years. In every tradition mantras involve chanting to createspecial vibrations, sounds of the universe that create something fromnothingness, that move energy from the unmanifest into the manifest.SUTRAThe sutra is a mantra that has meaning. The mantra itself has no meaning. It’sjust a vibration, a sound. It becomes a sutra when there’s an intention coded inthe sound. The word sutra is a Sanskrit word, related to the Latin noun sutura,which is the base of the English word suture, meaning “to join together bysewing.” So a sutra is actually a stitch on the soul, and the stitch is one ofintention. Both mantras and sutras allow you to transcend to a deeperconsciousness. Therefore you could use the “so-hum” mantra, for example, totranscend. Then you could use an actual word, a sutra, to embed a particularintention into your consciousness.The messages in a sutra are simple and complex at the same time. If I say thesutra “aham brahmasmi” (“the core of my being is the ultimate reality, the rootand ground of the universe, the source of all that exists”), it might take awhole day, or half a book, to explain and understand that one sentence. Yet thesutra contains the complete understanding of that complex thought. So thissutra, these two words, summarizes the whole understanding. By simply puttingyour attention on this sutra, you will experience and understand the entireexplanation contained within it.There are mantras and sutras that have been used successfully for thousands ofyears, and you will find them in the chapters that follow. They provide a pathto synchrodestiny. Although the Sanskrit words that embody those sutras maysound foreign to you, that doesn’t diminish their effectiveness. You do not evenhave to understand the meanings of the sutras in order for them to work.Remember, these are the sounds of nature, with meaning attached. The soul willunderstand their meaning even if you do not.Why do we use these ancient words as our mantras and sutras instead of moremodern language? The answer has to do with potency. Using newer mantras andsutras only makes the process of experiencing synchronicity more difficult.Consider that there are many ways for me to go from my home to my office. I cantake the highway. I can follow a road map or a contour map. I can take ahelicopter. I can go to the coast and take a ship. But if I take a path that’swell trodden, one that is familiar and that I’ve taken many times, then thejourney is easier. Similarly, mantras and sutras that have been used forthousands of years by millions of people over generations provide the easiestroute to transcendence and to the nonlocal domain.But there’s an additional value in using something that’s been used many timesbefore for a particular purpose. Every time a mantra or sutra is used, it helpsincrease the probability that a similar outcome will result from a later usageof the same mantra or sutra. If you recall the discussion of the wave-particlein Chapter 1, you’ll remember that every time a wave-particle collapses as aparticular wave pattern, it increases the likelihood that it will collapse asthat same pattern of wave again in the future. Sutras are actually intentionsthat increase the statistical likelihood of the collapse of a wave functionalong predictable probability amplitudes. This means that the more a sutra isused, the greater the likelihood that its chosen intention will be fulfilled.Therefore it is better to use an old, well-used sutra than a new sutra. Try notto be put off by the use of Sanskrit, but welcome the ancient words as allies inyour search for the transcendence that leads to synchrodestiny. The following chapters describe the seven Principles of Synchrodestiny andprovide exercises to strengthen your understanding of them. These sevenprinciples are ways of thinking about the qualities of nonlocal intelligence andrelating them to your life. Each principle offers a new lesson, a new way ofrelating that brings you closer to spirit, with its infinite possibilities.Here is the program for achieving synchrodestiny, a specific way to use all theelements I’ve discussed so far:1. Begin each day by going to a quiet place where you will not be disturbed.Gather symbols of your archetypes and place them in front of you.2. Meditate for twenty minutes using the so-hum mantra. This expands yourconsciousness and puts you in a receptive frame of mind.3. Immediately upon completing the meditation, when you open your eyes, lookupon the symbols of your archetypes and invite or invoke the archetypal energiesto express themselves through you. Say, “I ask that you become part of me andwork through me. Guide me through my life.”4. Read the synchrodestiny principle for this day. There are seven Principles ofSynchrodestiny and seven days of the week. On the day you begin, read the firstprinciple. You don’t have to understand every concept contained in thatprinciple. Just read it. On the second day, move on to the second principle. Onthe third day, move on to the third principle, and so on. I recommend that youdon’t skip around; the principles are arranged in an order that builds, one uponthe other. On the eighth day, go back to the first principle and start theseries over again.Each principle has a sutra that encapsulates the teachings of the principle.Thoroughly understand the meaning of the sutra. Perform the exercises associatedwith the sutra until they have become part of your reality. After many weeks,you will be able to read the sutra alone and gain the benefit of the entirechapter. Ideally, you will continue this program every day, with each week, eachmonth bringing you closer to fulfilling your life’s destiny.These first four steps should take no longer than twenty or thirty minutes.Repeat the process at night.For the rest of the day, you do not need to do anything special. Just live yourlife the way you normally would. The morning meditation focuses your intentionfor the day, even when you are not even thinking about it. By reading theprinciple, you create that intention, and then allow nonlocal intelligence tosynchronize all the millions of individual events that need to occur to have theintention be fulfilled. That’s all you need to do.Although intention works on its own through synchronicity organized by nonlocalintelligence, synchronicity can become blocked by the ego. How can you tell whenyour ego is getting in the way of your dreams? There are many clues, but themost important is anxiety. Whenever your self or your spirit is overshadowed byyour self-image or your ego, you feel anxiety. Your true, core self does notfeel stress or anxiety. A person who is centered does not feel stress oranxiety. These feelings are a signal that your intimate connection to thenonlocal entity is blocked. For many people, this happens all too often. The wayto break through this obstacle, and to regain the focus you lost by feelingstressed, or anxious, is through a process I call heliotropism.Heliotropism is the natural mechanism in plants that allows them to always growin the direction of light. By extension, I believe that your thoughts, yourintentions, are the equivalent of that light, and the world itself grows in adirection to meet those intentions. Use the Sutra Statements at the end of eachof the following seven chapters whenever you feel stressed, anxious, or loseyour center during the day. Each day, simply turn to the Sutra Statement forthat day. (You might find it helpful to photocopy these statements and carrythem with you so you can use them when needed to reestablish your sense ofself.) Read the first statement silently and allow an image to come to yourconsciousness. As soon as you register the image, say the sutra for that day (asincluded in the exercises). Do the same for each of that day’s statements. Assoon as you finish all the statements, which will take only about a minute orso, you should feel centered once again.At the end of each chapter you will find one or more exercises designed to helpillustrate the principles and guide you to a deeper understanding of the sutras.These are not part of the daily meditation, but a supplement. Try them wheneveryou feel you would like to take that extra step toward understanding thePrinciples of Synchrodestiny.In the end, that’s really all you need in order to reach the place wheresynchrodestiny happens—the seven principles, the seven sutras, your archetypes,an ability to meditate using the “so-hum” mantra, and the Sutra Statements toread when you feel yourself beginning to lose your center. In your hands theseare the tools that make miracles happen."},{"pageContent":"8image [../images/00003.jpeg]The First Principle:You Are a Ripple in theFabric of the CosmosSUTRA: Aham Brahmasmi (ah-HUM brah-MAHS-mee)The core of my being is the ultimate reality, the rootand ground of the universe, the source of all that exists.The first principle of synchrodestiny acknowledges the underlying intelligencethat gives rise to my body, your body, and the universe as a whole—everythingfrom stars and galaxies to subatomic particles. This conscious intelligencefield is the wellspring of the cosmos. It is the extended body we all share; itconnects us all. The core of my being is also the core of your being, and thecore of all beings.You and I and the universe are the same. I am the universe, localized in asingle human being. You are also the universe, localized in your body, readingthese words at this particular moment in space-time. We both exist only asparticular ripples in the conscious intelligence field. Every aspect ofourselves is articulated and orchestrated by this boundless nonlocalintelligence, the endless sea of consciousness from which you and I and theuniverse arise. Even our thoughts, our wishes, our desires, our dreams are nottechnically our thoughts, wishes, desires, or dreams. They are manifestations ofthe total universe. And when you realize that the intentions and desires thatarise in you are the very intentions of the universe, you can relinquish yourdesire for control and let the miraculous life you were born to lead unfold inall its unimaginable magnificence.Once you understand this premise, you will understand the sutra of the firstprinciple of synchrodestiny: The core of my being is the ultimate reality, theroot and ground of the universe, the source of all that exists. As simple asthis sounds, its depth can take a lifetime to plumb, and its meaning for ourlives is profound. When we fully understand this simple sutra, everythingbecomes possible because everything already exists within us. You and I are thesame, and each of us is the infinite being projecting a particular point ofview—your point of view and my point of view. My self is inseparable from allthat exists, just as your self is inseparable from all that exists.The power in this thought emerges when we realize that the self functionssynchronistically. Because I am an extension of the conscious intelligence, andthe conscious intelligence is the source of all reality, then I am the source ofall reality. I create my own experience. Intention springs from our deepest desires, and those desires are shaped bykarma. You and I don’t have the same karma; therefore we don’t have exactly thesame desires. We have loved different people, knelt at different graves, prayedat different altars. The specifics of desire are unique to each of us.Yet if you follow the chain of desire, in the end we are all the same. We wantto be happy. We want to be fulfilled. We want meaning and purpose in our lives.We want a sense of connection with God or spirit. We want other people torespect us and love us. And we want to feel safe. These desires are universal.But the route each of us takes to satisfy them is uniquely our own, based on ourindividual experiences and memories, or karma. We’re all heading for the samedestination, but we take different roads. We arrive together, having traveledour different paths.Exercise 1:THE SILENT WITNESSGo to a quiet place where you are not likely to be disturbed. Put on a tape orCD of your favorite soothing music. Close your eyes. As you do so, turn yourattention to who is really listening. Begin to notice two different facets ofyourself. Your ears pick up the sound and your brain processes the notes, butthat’s only the mechanics of hearing. Who connects the notes so that they formmusic? As you are thinking about listening, who is doing the actual listening?Notice the silent witness, the silent listener who is always present. Thispresence exists not only in yourself, but also in the space around you. It isthat part of yourself that is beyond the thoughts and feelings of the moment,the part that never tires and never sleeps. Nor can this part of you ever bedestroyed. Recognize that this silent witness is always there. It is that partof you that can be glimpsed when the chatter of your thoughts is silenced bymeditation. Can you feel this deeper current of consciousness within you?Awareness of this silent witness is the beginning of awareness of the consciousintelligence field—the source of all the synchronicities in our lives.Exercise 2:WHY ARE YOU HERE?For this exercise you will need paper and pen, and ten minutes of uninterruptedtime.Ask yourself, Why am I here? Write down the first thing that comes to mind. Thisquestion is open to many interpretations, so jot down whatever thoughts ittriggers. Don’t worry about the writing itself. You don’t even have to usecomplete sentences.Then pose the question again: Why am I here? Write down a new response. Do thistwenty times. Keep looking for different ways to interpret the question so thateach answer is unique and speaks to a different facet of the question.Now look over your responses. What do they tell you? Do you see any pattern orprogression in the answers? What does this tell you about how you see your life?You can see your life as a series of external and internal events, but you canalso learn to see those events as connected with each other and with somethingmore spiritual. When you do that, you will begin to see your life as anopportunity to share the special gift you alone can bestow upon the world.That’s one answer to the question of why you are here. Having this kind ofclarity of purpose will help you focus your intentions.Sutra Statementsfor the First Principleimage [../images/00003.jpeg]Imagine that the whole universe is being played out inside you.(When you have an image in your mind, say, “aham brahmasmi.”)Imagine that you are connected to everything that exists.(aham brahmasmi)Imagine that you are like a crystal bead. You reflect the light of all othersentient beings. You also reflect the light of the whole universe.(aham brahmasmi)Imagine that you’re a strand in the cosmic thread connected to all the otherstrands.(aham brahmasmi)Imagine that you are eternal.(aham brahmasmi)"},{"pageContent":"9image [../images/00003.jpeg]The Second Principle:Through the Mirror ofRelationships I DiscoverMy Nonlocal SelfSUTRA: Tat Tvam Asi (taht t’vahm AH-see)I see the other in myself and myself in others.Understanding how human relationships work is one of the most important keys tosynchrodestiny. In the West, we tend to rely on popular psychology to come upwith strategies for managing our thoughts and feelings. All too often self-helpbooks propose manipulating our relationships so they can become more satisfying.But creating positive human relationships is much more than a tactic: It meansproviding the human environment in which synchrodestiny can take place. It’sabsolutely fundamental, in the same way that gravity, or having air to breathe,is fundamental.The mantra for this principle means “I am that.” This principle builds on thefirst principle, in which we learned that we are all extensions of the universalenergy field, all a single entity with different points of view. I am thatinvolves looking at everything in the world, everyone else in the world, andrealizing that you are looking at another version of yourself. You and I are thesame. Everything is the same. I am that, you are that, all this is that. We areall mirrors for others, and we need to learn to see ourselves in the reflectionof other people. This is called the mirror of relationship. Through the mirrorof relationship I discover my nonlocal self. For this reason, nurturingrelationships is the most important activity in my life. When I look around me,everything I see is an expression of myself.Relationship, then, is a tool for spiritual evolution, with the ultimate goal ofreaching unity consciousness. We are all inevitably part of the same universalconsciousness, but the real breakthroughs happen when we start to recognize thatconnection in our daily lives.Relationship is one of the most effective ways to access unity consciousnessbecause we’re always in relationships. Think of the web of relationships youhave at any time—parents, children, friends, co-workers, romantic relationships.All are, at their heart, spiritual experiences. When you’re in love, forexample, romantically and deeply in love, you have a sense of timelessness. Youare, at that moment, at peace with uncertainty. You feel wonderful butvulnerable, you feel intimate but exposed. You’re transforming, changing, butwithout trepidation; you feel a sense of wonder. This is a spiritual experience.Through the mirror of relationship—all relationships—we discover extended statesof awareness. Those whom we love and those whom we are repelled by are bothmirrors of ourselves. Whom are we attracted to? People who have the same traitsas we have, but more so. We want to be in their company because subconsciouslywe feel that by doing so we, too, might manifest more of those traits as well.By the same token we are repelled by people who reflect back to us traits thatwe deny in our own selves. So if you are having a strong negative reaction tosomeone, you can be sure that they possess some traits in common with you,traits that you are not willing to embrace. If you were willing to accept thosequalities, then they wouldn’t upset you.By recognizing that we can see ourselves in others, every relationship becomes atool for the evolution of our consciousness. And as consciousness evolves, weexperience expanded states of awareness. It is in those expanded states ofawareness, when we get to the nonlocal domain, that we can experiencesynchrodestiny.The next time you’re attracted to someone, ask yourself what attracted you. Isit beauty, or grace, or elegance, or influence, or power, or intelligence?Whatever it is, know that that quality is also blossoming in you. Pay attentionto these feelings, and you can begin the process of becoming more fullyyourself.Of course, the same is true of people who repel you. In becoming more fully yourtrue self, you have to understand and embrace the less attractive qualities inyourself. The essential nature of the universe is the coexistence of oppositevalues. You cannot be brave if you do not have a coward inside you. You cannotbe generous if you do not have a tight-fisted person inside you. You cannot bevirtuous unless you also contain the capacity for evil.We spend much of our lives denying that we have this dark side to ourselves, andthen end up projecting those dark qualities onto other people in our lives. Haveyou ever known people who naturally attract the “wrong” people into their lives?Usually they don’t understand why this happens time after time, year after year.The truth is not that they attract that darkness, but that they are not willingto acknowledge it in their own lives. Finding a person you dislike is anopportunity to embrace the paradox of the coexistence of opposites, and todiscover a new facet of yourself. It is another step toward developing yourspiritual self. The most enlightened people in the world embrace their fullpotential of light and dark. When you’re with people who recognize and own theirnegative qualities, you never feel judged by them. It’s only when people seegood and bad, right and wrong, as qualities outside themselves that judgmentsoccur.When we are willing to embrace both the light and the dark sides of our selves,we can begin to heal both our selves and our relationships. Start very simply,with the most distasteful person you can think of. For example, think of AdolfHitler and say, How could I possibly be like Hitler? Most people refuse toaccept that they contain even the smallest shred of an Adolf Hitler. But thinkmore deeply. Have you ever expressed prejudice toward any group of people justbecause they had a certain name, or a certain skin color, or a certain accent,or a certain disability? If you can think of any example of that in your life,then you must embrace the similarity between yourself and Adolf Hitler. We areall multidimensional, omnidimensional. Everything that exists somewhere in theworld also exists in us. When we embrace these different aspects of ourselves,we acknowledge our connection to the universal consciousness and expand ourpersonal awareness.There’s a wonderful Sufi story that illustrates how this mirror affects ourlives. A man entered a village and went to see the Sufi master, the wise old manof the village. The visitor said, “I’m deciding whether I should move here ornot. I’m wondering what kind of a neighborhood this is. Can you tell me aboutthe people here?” The Sufi master said, “Tell me what kind of people lived whereyou came from.” The visitor said, “Oh, they were highway robbers, cheats, andliars.” The old Sufi master said, “You know, those are exactly the same kinds ofpeople who live here.” The visitor left the village and never came back. Half anhour later, another man entered the village. He sought out the Sufi master andsaid, “I’m thinking of moving here. Can you tell me what kind of people livehere?” Again the Sufi master said, “Tell me what kind of people lived where youcame from.” The visitor said, “Oh, they were the kindest, gentlest, mostcompassionate, loving people. I shall miss them terribly.” The Sufi master said,“Those are exactly the kinds of people who live here, too.”This story reminds us that the traits we see most clearly in others exist moststrongly in our selves. When we can see into the mirror of relationship, then wecan begin to see all of our selves. To do this, we need to be comfortable withour ambiguity, to embrace all aspects of our selves. At a deep level we need torecognize that we are not flawed simply because we have negative traits. No onehas only positive traits. Recognizing that we have negative traits simply meansthat we are complete. And in that completeness we gain greater access to ouruniversal, nonlocal selves.Exercise 3:EMBRACING DUALITYFor this exercise, you’ll need a piece of paper and a pen.Think about a specific person whom you find very attractive. On the left side ofthe paper list ten or more desirable qualities that person possesses. Listanything that comes to mind. Write quickly. The secret is not to allow yourconscious mind time to edit your thoughts. Why do you like this person? Why doyou find him or her attractive? What do you most admire? Is that person kind,loving, flexible, independent? Do you admire that he or she drives a nice car,has a flattering hairstyle, or lives in a desirable house? You are the only onewho will see this list, so be completely honest. If you get stuck before comingup with ten characteristics, then say out loud, “I like this person because———,” and fill in the blank. You can write down as many qualities as you like,but don’t stop before reaching ten.Now switch gears and bring into your awareness somebody whom you find repulsive,someone who irritates you, annoys you, aggravates you, or makes youuncomfortable in some way. Start to define those specific qualities that youfind unattractive. On the right side of the paper, list ten or more of theseundesirable qualities. Why don’t you like that person? Why are you infuriated orannoyed by that person? Write down as many qualities as you like, but don’t stopbefore reaching ten.When you have completed both lists, think again about the person you findattractive and identify at least three unattractive traits in that person. Don’tfight it—nobody’s perfect. (The more you can accept this in others, the morereadily you’ll be able to accept it in yourself.) Then think about the personyou found unattractive and identify three traits that are relatively appealing.Now you should have at least twenty-six qualities listed on the page. Read overeach one and circle every quality that you own yourself. For example, if youwrote compassionate about the attractive person, ask yourself if you are evercompassionate. If so, then circle that word. If not, then don’t circle the word.Don’t think too much about it—just respond to your first impressions. Go throughall words on both lists and circle every word that describes a quality that youcan identify in your own nature.Look at the list again. For every word that you did not circle, identify theones that are absolutely inapplicable to you, words that definitely do notdescribe you. Put a checkmark next to those.Finally, go back and look at the words that you circled and identify the topthree that describe you most strongly. Turn the paper over and write down thosethree words. Then go back and look at the words that you checked and identifythe top three that define you the very least—ones that in no way whatsoeverapply to you. Write those three words on the back of the paper under the threewords that apply to you the most. Read those six words—the three that describeyou best and the three that least apply—out loud. You are all of these qualitiesand traits. The qualities you most strongly deny in yourself are also part ofyou and are likely the qualities that create the most turbulence in your life.You will attract people with all six of these qualities—the extremely positivequalities because you may not feel that you deserve them and the extremelynegative ones because you refuse to acknowledge their presence in your life.Once you can see yourself in others, it will become much easier to connect withthem, and through that connection to discover unity consciousness. The door tosynchrodestiny will open. Such is the power of the mirror of relationship.Exercise 4:NAMASTEThe Sanskrit word namaste (pronounced nah-mah-STAY) means “The spirit in mehonors the spirit in you.” Whenever you first make eye contact with anotherperson, say “Namaste” silently to yourself. This is a way of acknowledging thatthe being there is the same as the being here.When you do this, everything about you—your body language, your expression, andyour tone—will be recognized by the other person at some profound level. Eventhough this greeting is silent, the other person will consciously orunconsciously register the respect implicit in your greeting. Practice thisexercise for a few days, and see if you notice a difference in your interactionswith other people.Sutra Statementsfor the Second Principleimage [../images/00003.jpeg]Imagine that your spirit is not only in you but in all other beings andeverything that is.(tat tvam asi)Imagine that everybody is a reflection of yourself.(tat tvam asi)Imagine that when you look at the universe you are looking at your mirror.(tat tvam asi)Imagine that you see what others see.(tat tvam asi)Imagine that you can feel what others feel.(tat tvam asi)Imagine that you are the qualities you most admire in others.(tat tvam asi)Imagine that others reflect the qualities you cherish in yourself.(tat tvam asi)Imagine that you are a person in a hall of mirrors where you can see yourselffor miles and every reflection you see is of yourself, but appears different.(tat tvam asi)"},{"pageContent":"10image [../images/00003.jpeg]The Third Principle:Master Your InnerDialogueSUTRA: Sat Chit Ananda (saht chit ah-NAN-dah)My inner dialogue reflects the fire of my soul.The third principle describes how your mind creates your reality—and how, bymastering your inner dialogue, you can literally transform reality to createabundance.The mantra—sat chit ananda—tells us that our soul is that place which isspontaneously love, knowingness, and bliss. Sat means truth, freedom from alllimitations. Chit means total knowledge, spontaneous knowing or pureconsciousness. Ananda means bliss, total happiness, complete fulfillment. Sowhat that phrase really says is, “My soul is free from limitations. My soul hasspontaneous knowing. My soul exists in complete fulfillment.”Inner dialogue is one of our most basic characteristics. When we meet newpeople, we’re used to looking at how they’re dressed, the kind of car theydrive, the wristwatch they’re wearing. Based on all these external clues, weform an impression of the individual. But this snap judgment is nothing morethan the result of the ego having a conversation with itself. That little voiceinside your head is constantly assessing this and evaluating that. This innerdialogue has an important function: By making judgments, it contributes tosurvival. This person may be dangerous. That fruit may be good to eat. This maynot be a good time to ask my boss for a raise. Useful though it is, this littlevoice would have you believe that you and it are one and the same, that itsgoals are your goals. But as we’ve seen, there is another place inside you wherethe silent witness dwells. This is the place where you connect to spirit, wherethe local mind gives way to the nonlocal mind. This is the place you can accessthrough meditation.INNER DIALOGUEAND SELF POWERBeing synchronized with the intelligence field creates balance physically,emotionally, and spiritually. It gives you strength and flexibility that allowyou to meet any challenge effortlessly. You become capable of transforming thechallenge in such a way that it nourishes you, and you draw greater strengthfrom meeting the challenge.Our inner dialogue gives us that kind of bright power because it is, in fact,the inner dialogue of the conscious intelligence field. When we are in tune withthe universal consciousness, when we are synchronized in the nonlocalintelligence field, we take on the power that emanates from that boundlessforce. This power comes from within, and when you have it, nothing is beyondyour reach.There are two kinds of power that emanate from the self. The first is the powerof agency—the power that comes from having a famous name, lots of money, or animpressive title. The power of agency can be formidable, but it eventually comesto an end. True power comes from within, and it has a spiritual rather than amaterial foundation. It is permanent and does not die with your body. Withagency, identity and power come from some external reference—an object, asituation, a status symbol, a relationship, money. With self-power, identitycomes from listening to the true self, and power comes from the internalreference of spirit.When you work from this internal reference, your sense of self is clear and isnot affected by external factors. This is the source of personal power. Whenexternal factors fail to influence your sense of self, you become immune tocriticism or to praise. You also understand that we are all equal, because weare all connected to the same conscious intelligence flow. That means that youunderstand that as you move through your life, you are beneath no one andsuperior to no one. You don’t have to beg or plead or convince anyone ofanything because you don’t have to convince yourself.As wonderful as this sounds, very few of us actually achieve a state of internalreference. All too often, we muddy the message by allowing our ego to intervene.Our thoughts, influenced by external factors—money worries, job stress,relationship tensions—end up hindering our spiritual development, and we findourselves moving in a direction opposite from where we want to go.The two best ways to overcome that tendency are to meditate and to consciouslypractice positive inner dialogue. Positive inner dialogue helps move us in theright direction, fosters synchronicity, and promotes spiritual development. Withpositive internal dialogue, we can create self-power.For example, suppose you are dissatisfied with your job and want to find a newone. You start looking through the newspapers and talking to friends who arefamiliar with your career, but nothing turns up. You might become frustrated andyour inner dialogue might conclude, “There’s just nothing out there for me.”Observe how that response contrasts with another example from a very differentpart of the world. Suppose a hunter in the Amazon rain forest is havingdifficulty finding game. If he goes to a shaman to deal with the situation,neither the hunter nor the shaman looks anywhere but within the hunter himselffor the solution to the problem. It never occurs to them to say something like“There’s no game out there,” because they know there is. The problem is thatsomething within the hunter is preventing him from finding the game. Maybesomething in the hunter is even driving away the game. So the shaman asks thehunter to participate in a ritual that is designed to change what is in thehunter’s heart and mind—because it is the heart and mind that control theexternal reality.When we find ourselves looking at the world and saying, “There’s nothing outthere for me,” we should probably also look into our hearts and ask, “If there’snothing out there, is there anything in here?” We need to examine our innerdialogue to discover where we might be blocking the conscious energy flow, thenremove the ego, step out of the way, and let the fire of the soul shine throughus.If you have fire of soul, then Vedic sages say it is reflected in the shining ofyour eyes. It’s reflected spontaneously in your body language and bodymovements. Everything you think, feel, say, and do will reflect that same fire.How does it look? There are no absolutes, but the spirit is reflected inimpeccable speech and behavior, refraining from anything that could potentiallybe considered hurtful. The spirit is reflected in confidence, happiness, goodhumor, fearlessness, kindness, and thoughtfulness. The quality of your innerdialogue is instantly obvious to other people, although it might not berecognized for what it is. When you practice positive inner dialogue, peoplewill want to bond with you, help you, be near you. They want to share in thelove, knowingness, and bliss that shines through your eyes and is reflected inyour every action. This is true inner power.Exercise 5:THE FIRE IN YOUR EYESThe fire in your soul will be reflected in your eyes. Whenever you look into amirror, even if it’s just for a second or two, make eye contact with your imageand silently repeat the three principles that are the foundation ofself-referral. First, say to yourself, “I’m totally independent of the good orbad opinions of others.” Second: “I’m beneath no one.” Third: “I’m fearless inthe face of any and all challenges.” Look into your eyes in the mirror and seethose attitudes reflected back at you. Just in your eyes, not in your facialexpression. Look for the shine in your eyes to remind yourself of the fire inyour soul.Sutra Statementsfor the Third Principleimage [../images/00003.jpeg]Imagine that you are centered and totally at peace.(sat chit ananda)Imagine that you are looking at the world with knowingness and peace.(sat chit ananda)Imagine that all beings are your equal.(sat chit ananda)Imagine that you are not affected by flattery or criticism.(sat chit ananda)Imagine that you are focused on the journey, not the destination.(sat chit ananda)Imagine that in your presence all hostility is overcome by a profound peace.(sat chit ananda)Imagine that you’re detached from the outcome.(sat chit ananda)Imagine that a deeply profound ocean of calm exists in you that is not affectedby any turbulence.(sat chit ananda)Imagine that love radiates from you like light from a bonfire.(sat chit ananda)Imagine that you are in love with everything and everybody.

And our intentions hold within them the mechanics of theirfulfillment. All we really need is clarity of intent. Then if we can get the egoout of the way, the intentions fulfill themselves. Our intentions attract theelements and forces, the events, the situations, the circumstances, and therelationships necessary to fulfill the intended outcome. We don’t need to becomeinvolved in the details—in fact, trying too hard may backfire. Let the nonlocalintelligence synchronize the actions of the universe to fulfill your intentionsfor you. Intention is a force in nature, like gravity, but more powerful. No onehas to concentrate on gravity to make it work. No one can say, “I don’t believein gravity,” because it is a force at work in the world whether we understand itor not. Intention works the same way.As a simple example, think back to a time when you were trying to remember somebit of trivia, a person’s name or the title of a book. It was on the tip of yourtongue, but you just couldn’t quite recall it. Once you try to remember, you’veintroduced intention. But the harder you try to remember, the farther theinformation seems to slip away from your conscious recall. But if you eventuallytake your ego out of the way, and let go of the process of remembering, thenyour intention goes into the virtual domain, with its infinite organizing power.Even when you’ve moved on to other thoughts, the virtual domain continues tosearch for the information, even without your conscious participation. Later,you could be falling asleep, or you could be sitting in a movie, and suddenlythe name you were trying so hard to remember simply pops into your awareness.This common example illustrates the way intention works. All we have to do iscreate the intention and let the universe take over.The only preparation or participation required to unleash the power of intentionis a connection to the conscious intelligence field, which can be attained manyways, one of the best being meditation. When a person achieves a certain levelof consciousness, whatever he or she intends begins to happen. There are peoplewho are so connected with the conscious intelligence field that their everyintent manifests itself—the whole order of the universe orchestrates around it.Of course, it is not strictly true that their every personal intention is beingmet; in actuality, people who are connected with the conscious intelligencefield adopt the intentions of the universe. Their intentions are being met, butthat’s only because the cosmic mind is using their intentions to fulfill its owndesires.We must look for opportunities to exercise intentions, because for the most partour society doesn’t provide them. If you’re like most people, there won’t bemany opportunities for going on a retreat to a mountaintop where you canconcentrate on the development of your spirit. You are much more likely to havea free moment when you’re stuck in traffic or while you’re waiting for animportant telephone call in your office. Those are more likely opportunities forpracticing timeless awareness and spirit-based intention.Intention is not simply a whim. It requires attention, and it also requiresdetachment. Once you have created the intention mindfully, you must be able todetach from the outcome, and let the universe handle the details of fulfillment.If you don’t, ego gets involved and clouds the process. You’ll feel frustratedif your intention isn’t realized soon enough. Your sense of self-importance maybe threatened, or perhaps you’ll start feeling sorry for yourself. Intent innature orchestrates its own fulfillment. The only thing that could interfere isdomination by your own ego needs and totally selfish concerns.Of course, the best way to have all your intentions realized is to align yourintentions with the cosmic intent, to create harmony between what you intend andwhat the universe intends for you. Once that congruence comes into being, you’llfind that synchronicity takes on a larger role in your life. The best way tocreate that harmony is by nurturing an attitude of simple gratitude. Acknowledgeyour gratitude for everything in your life. Give thanks for your place in thecosmos and for the opportunity you have to further the destiny we all share.Part of creating harmony involves abandoning grievances of all kinds. Grievancecomes from the ego. Animals don’t have any problems with grudges or grievances.It’s only among us human beings that intention is so often encumbered by allsorts of emotional baggage. You must let all that go in order to create a pureintention.Exercise 6:FOCUSING INTENTIONThe best way to focus on intentions is to write them down. Although this maysound like an obvious first step, it is a step that many people ignore. As aresult, their intentions often remain unfocused, and therefore unrealized.Go to a quiet place where you are not likely to be disturbed. Write down whatyou want on all different levels of desire. Include material, ego gratification,relationship, self-esteem, and spiritual desires. Be as specific as possible.Ask yourself what you want on the material level, in terms of abundance andaffluence. Do you want to own your own house with four bedrooms? Write thatdown. Do you want to be able to send your children to college? Write that down.Think also of your desires for sensory gratification—sound, touch, sight, taste,smell, and sensuality—anything that gratifies the senses. Write those down.Ask yourself what you want in terms of relationships. Write down your desiresfor all your relationships—romantic partners, children, peers, parents, friends,and professional relationships.Write down what you want in terms of personal accomplishments or recognition.Note what you want on a more universal level—how can you help? What do you wantto do with your life in terms of your society, your country, your civilization?What do you want to contribute? Write down what you want when you think ofdiscovering your highest sense of self. Whom do you want to be? What spirituallydo you want to add to your life? Write down everything you desire on a singlesheet of paper. Add or subtract from the list as your desires change or becomefulfilled.Meditate on what life would be like if all these desires were to manifest. Seeif you can create inner visions of genuine fulfillment on both material andspiritual levels. Don’t be concerned about having these visions in any kind oforder, or whether they’re very realistic or not. Just see them allhappening—feel them with all your five senses. The goal is to have congruentattention on all these four levels of aspiration. When that kind of congruencyis in play, the internal dialogue is very powerful and clear, and will help yougain unity of consciousness.Intentions do not need constant attention, but they do need to remain focused.This is a habit that you develop over time. Look at your list once or twiceduring the day. Read it over again just before you meditate. When you go intomeditation, you silence the self. The ego disappears. As a result, you detachfrom the results and outcomes, you don’t get involved in the details, and youlet the infinite organizing power of the deeper intelligence orchestrate andfulfill all the details of your intentions for you. The key is to move away fromthe level of the ego, away from the level of the self and self-esteem, to letthe nonlocal intelligence orchestrate the fulfillment of your desires throughsynchronicity.In the beginning, you can be as selfish as you want. In the beginning yourintentions may be all about “self” and the little details of what you want tohappen in your life. But eventually you will realize that the goal isfulfillment at all levels, not just the personal or ego level. As you start tosee the fulfillment of your intentions, your self-interest will diminish becauseyou know you can have it all. When you have enough food to eat, you don’t obsessabout eating all the time. It’s the same with intentions. When you know thatfulfillment is possible, you will think less about your personal needs and moreabout the needs of the rest of the world. This is a process that works throughstages. Be patient, but watch for the miracles to begin.Exercise 7:THE HEART SUTRAThis is a meditation exercise that demonstrates the power of intention. But itis more than a mere demonstration. Do this regularly so that this ritual canfocus your attention and your intention.Go to a quiet place where you are not likely to be disturbed for fifteenminutes. Close your eyes, practice the primordial sound mantra—”so-hum”—for fiveminutes, placing your awareness on your breath.After five minutes, put your mental awareness in the area of your heart, in themiddle of your chest. With your attention on your heart, you may begin to feelyour heart beating more strongly. This is normal. As you experience the beatingof your heart, begin to also experience gratitude. The way to experiencegratitude is to think of all the things, events, and relationships in your lifefor which you have reason to be grateful. Allow those images to surface in yourconsciousness while you keep your attention on your heart. Take a moment tothink of all the people whom you love and all the people who share their lovewith you.Then say to yourself: “Every decision I make is a choice between a grievance anda miracle. I let go of grievances and choose miracles.” Certain resentments andgrievances—and the people associated with those resentments and grievances—maysurface in your awareness. If they do, just say, “I let go of the grievances. Ichoose the miracles.” Then become aware of your heart again, and consciouslystart to breathe into your heart. As you do, say to yourself, “Love . . .knowingness . . . bliss . . . love,” and then breathe out for the same count offour. Between each inhalation and exhalation pause for several seconds. Do thisfor three or four minutes.Through the heart sutra meditation, the fire of your soul—which is love,knowingness, and bliss—will start to broadcast itself through the heart. This iswhere the third principle of synchrodestiny meets the fourth principle: The fireof your soul now begins to create your intention.After having said “I let go of grievances and choose miracles” a few times,start to repeat mentally the phrase “Thy will be done.” This prepares your mindto receive the intention of the nonlocal intelligence, and to understand that itis, simultaneously, your intention.After about a minute, let go of all thoughts and bring your awareness fully toyour heart. Experience your heartbeat, either as a sound or as a sensation. Feelit throbbing. Once you can sense your heart, transfer your awareness into yourhands, and feel the throbbing of your heart in your hands. Introduce theintention to increase the blood flow to your hands. Just have the intention. Asthe blood flow to your hands increases, either the throbbing will increase oryou’ll feel warmth, tingling, or some other sensation. Introduce the intentionof increasing warmth so that your hands become warmer and warmer. Feel thewarmth in your hands as your intention alone increases the blood flow.When your hands have become warm, move your awareness into your face, the upperpart of your face around the eyeballs, and have the same intention. Increase theblood flow to your face so your face starts to flush and get warm. Just have theintention. You may feel a pulsing or tingling sensation around your eyes as theblood flow increases and your face becomes warm.Finally, bring your awareness back into your heart. Imagine that there is apinpoint of light pulsating in your heart, matching your heartbeat. Thispinpoint of light pulsating in your heart is the light of your soul and itpulsates with the three qualities of the soul: love, knowingness, and bliss, orsat chit ananda, which is also the sutra for the Third Principle in Chapter 10.As it pulsates, experience the pinpoint of love, knowingness, bliss. It issending radiant light to the rest of your body. Slowly let that pinpoint oflight fade away from your awareness, and tune in to your whole body. Feel thesensations. Then open your eyes. The meditation is over.Sutra Statementsfor the Fourth Principleimage [../images/00003.jpeg]Imagine that the whole universe is a vast ocean of consciousness, and yourintentions shoot out from within your heart and ripple across the vast ocean ofconsciousness.(san kalpa)Imagine that your intention is orchestrating the infinite activity of theuniverse, counterbalancing the whole ecosystem.(san kalpa)Imagine that your intention can heal those who are not well.(san kalpa)Imagine that your intention can bring joy and laughter to those who are insorrow.(san kalpa)Imagine that you can bring success to those who are failing.(san kalpa)Imagine that you can bring strength to those who feel weak and fearful.(san kalpa)Imagine that you can bring hope to those who are feeling helpless.(san kalpa)Imagine that your thoughts affect the natural forces of the universe, that youcan bring rain and sunshine, clouds and rainbows.(san kalpa)Imagine that every thought you have, every word you utter, every deed of yoursbrings some benefit to the world.(san kalpa)"},{"pageContent":"12image [../images/00003.jpeg]The Fifth Principle:Harness YourEmotional TurbulenceSUTRA: Moksha (MOKE-shah)I am emotionally free.Once we understand that external reality can’t be separated from internalreality, once we understand that the universe really is our extended body, itbecomes very clear that negative energy within ourselves is destructive.Emotional turbulence is a major barrier to the spontaneous fulfillment ofdesire, but it is possible to transform negative energy into a higher level ofawareness.The word moksha means “freedom.” As this sutra resonates within you, itexpresses “I am emotionally free. My soul is disengaged from melodrama. I amfree from resentment, grievances, hostility, and guilt. I am free ofself-importance. I am free of self-concern. I’m free of self-pity. I can laughat myself. I see the humor in life.” These are all contained in that freedom; ifI’m not emotionally free, then I overshadow and cloud the experience of thespirit with the ego, and my best intentions cannot be fulfilled.Ultimately emotional freedom leads to psychological and spiritual freedom aswell. There are really only two emotions: pleasure and pain—either it feels goodor it hurts. Most people believe that the two fundamental emotions are love andfear, but these are really just the ways we respond to the potential forpleasure and pain. Love means we want to get closer to it because we think itwill bring us pleasure. Fear means we want to move away because we think it willbring pain.We spend our lives seeking pleasure and avoiding pain. The things that bringpleasure or pain are different for each of us. Pleasure and pain flow from theneeds that you have. If I have a craving for chocolate ice cream, and you bringme chocolate ice cream, then I interpret that as being pleasurable. If you havean allergy to chocolate and someone brings you chocolate ice cream, that gift isassociated with pain. It’s all about perception and interpretation. It’s the egothat interprets things as being pleasurable or painful, and the ego experiencesany crossing of the boundary of ego without permission as being painful.The optimal and truest condition is one of balance. Any time we have emotionalturbulence, we upset our natural internal balance, which can block our spiritualevolution and may even disconnect us from synchronicity. This is not to say thatemotions are, in themselves, harmful or to be avoided. As human beings we willalways have emotions; these are part of the human condition. But extremes ofemotion will set us off course for our true life purpose. There will always beevents or relationships in our lives that trigger strong emotions in us. Therewill always be things in this world that cause great pain or anxiety. But weneed to avoid getting stuck on one emotion.Think of life as a river with two banks—pleasure on one side, pain on the other.The best way to float down that river is to stay in the middle, moving evenlybetween the two banks. If you stray too close to either side, your passageslows, and you run the risk of running aground. Too much pleasure leads toaddiction. Too much pain can eclipse your enjoyment of life.It is important to note that pain does not have to be physical. It can beemotional pain, or even the memory of a past pain. Although our natural instinctis to avoid pain, we must deal with it when it occurs; otherwise, it willresurface later in life in some form of emotional turbulence. The form it takesmay be different from what you expect, but it will resurface, perhaps asinsomnia, or illness, or anxiety, or depression.Perhaps the most destructive emotion is anger. The ultimate goal of spiritualtransformation is enlightenment, the perpetual state of unity consciousness, theconstant awareness that you and I and all the rest of the universe are patternsof the same fabric, woven of nonlocal intelligence. Anger motivates us to harmothers, moving us in the opposite direction from enlightenment and unityconsciousness. Anger clouds any perception of unity. Anger is about only theego. Rather than moving you forward toward synchronicity and enlightenment,anger pushes you backward, closing you down to the transformative messages ofthe universe.It is therefore critically important to control this form of emotionalturbulence. Venting anger really does not help. Venting simply gives fuel to theanger and allows it to grow. Angry feelings need to be dealt with in a positiveway as soon as possible after they arise. The goal is not to fuel the anger, orto try to smother it by burying it. Instead, we must convert the anger, or anyother destructive emotion, within ourselves.The first step to converting emotions is to take responsibility for what you arefeeling. In order to take responsibility, you must recognize the emotion. Whatare you feeling? Where do you feel it in your body? Once you can identify thefeeling, witness it. Experience it as objectively as possible, as though you areanother person looking in. Anger is triggered by pain. Describe the pain fromthis objective point of view.After the pain is identified in these ways, you can begin to express, release,and share the pain. Transform the painful experience into new awareness.Eventually you may even be able to celebrate the pain as another step on yourroad to spiritual enlightenment. When you embrace the pain in this way,emotional turbulence will disappear and the path to synchronicity again becomesclear.Exercise 8:DEALING WITH PAINThis exercise will require about ten minutes of quiet time in a place where youare not likely to be disturbed. Begin by meditating for a few moments.With your eyes closed, recall some event or situation in the past that was veryupsetting to you. It may have been an argument, or some time when your feelingswere hurt, or some random encounter that made you angry. Once you’ve settled onan upsetting situation, try to recall as many details about it as possible.Create a mental movie of exactly what happened.The first step to dealing with the pain of this situation is to identify exactlywhat you are feeling. What word best describes how you feel because of thisevent or situation? Try to come up with a single word that encompasses as manyof the feelings as possible, your best description. Now, focus on that word fora few seconds.Let your attention gradually shift from that word to your body. What physicalsensations are you feeling as a result of reliving that emotion? Every emotionhas both mental and physical aspects that cannot be separated. Our feelingsoccur both in our minds and in our bodies at the same instant. Feel thesensations that this incident you are thinking about has created. Have yourhands automatically clenched into fists? Do you feel a tightening of yourstomach? A pain in your gut? Notice the physical experience of the emotion, andlocalize it to a specific spot on your body.The next step is to express the feeling. Place your hand on the part of yourbody where you sense that the feeling is located. Out loud, say, “It hurtshere.” If there is more than one location for the pain, touch each place andrepeat the phrase, “It hurts here.”For every emotional hurt, we have the power within us to make the paindisappear. Our reactions to external events localize in our bodies. We createemotions, which create physical pain. When we understand that simple fact, wecan learn to change the way we respond to outside events. We can choose the waywe react to incidents in the world. If we react with anger, hostility,depression, anxiety, or another intense emotion, our bodies follow along andcreate the necessary hormones and muscle contractions and other physicalmanifestations that eventually cause us actual pain. Therefore, we must alwaysremember that these effects are our responsibility in the sense that we canchange our reactions in ways that are less personally harmful. We can becomefree of emotional drama and turbulence. Meditate for a moment on the concept ofpersonal responsibility for emotional reactions.Once the pain has been located and acknowledged, and after you’ve takenresponsibility for it, you can release the pain. Place your attention on thepart of your body where you are holding the pain. With every exhalation ofbreath, have the intention of releasing that tension that you are holding. Forhalf a minute, focus on releasing tension and pain with every breath. Let it go.Breathe it out.The next step is to share the pain. Imagine that you could speak to the personwho was involved in the incident that you have recalled for this exercise. Whatwould you say to that person? As you consider this, remember that the person wasnot the true cause of your pain. You had the emotional reaction that manifestedin physical pain. You have taken responsibility. Knowing this, what would yousay to that person? What you choose to say will be personal to you and yoursituation. Whatever you say to share the pain you experienced will help tocleanse the experience from your consciousness forever. Share what you felt,share how you feel now, and share how you intend to deal with such feelings inthe future.This exercise can be used whenever you feel emotional turbulence in your life.When you have completed the exercise, take a moment to celebrate that you haveused this painful experience to transcend to a higher level of consciousness. Ifyou use this exercise consistently, you will eventually be able to entirely freeyourself of emotional turbulence and pain, freeing your way to experiencesynchronicity.Exercise 9:NONVIOLENT COMMUNICATIONThere will always be situations and circumstances in your life when someone willcross some personal boundary, triggering strong emotional responses. Thisexercise is derived from Marshall Rosenberg’s excellent book NonviolentCommunication.There are four basic steps to nonviolent communication, which involve fourquestions you ask yourself whenever you find yourself becoming defensive. Whensomeone pushes your buttons, it’s tempting to want to push back. But that is notan optimal response—it is not productive, it wastes valuable personal energy,and it creates more turbulence in the world. For this exercise, think of arecent situation when something irritated or upset you in some way. Keeping thatexperience in mind, follow these four steps.STEP 1:Separate Observation from EvaluationDefine what actually happened, instead of relying on your interpretation of whathappened. Be as objective as possible when describing the event. Ask yourself:What are you actually responding to? What actually occurred? What did you seeand hear?For example, you may be driving along in the car, wondering whether you needanything for dinner tonight when your spouse notices your silence and asks,“What are you upset about?” You say, “I’m not upset about anything, I was justthinking about dinner.” Your spouse responded to your silence with anevaluation, not an observation. Any time you attach meaning to an action, thatis an interpretation or evaluation. For the following sets of sentences, see ifyou can figure out which is the evaluation and which is the observation:1. “I saw you flirting with that woman at the party.”2. “I saw you talking with that woman at the party for more than an hour.”1. “I can see that your work has become more important to you than your family.”2. “You have been leaving for work before dawn and coming home after 10 P.M.every day for the last three weeks.”1. “You don’t love me anymore.”2. “You don’t kiss me when you come home from work anymore.”In all three sets, the first statement is the interpretation or evaluation.Whenever you find yourself responding with an emotional reaction, stop for amoment and try to discern the difference between your interpretation of theevent and the objective observation of the event. Observations are empoweringbecause they allow us to recognize how much of our response to others is basedon interpretation, which in turn allows us to change our patterns of respondingto the actions of others.STEP 2:Define Your FeelingsThink to yourself, What feelings arose as a result of the situation? What am Ifeeling? As you describe your feelings, use language that reflects only thefeelings that you are responsible for and avoid words that victimize you. Forexample, you might feel appreciated, angry, antagonistic, anxious, afraid, bold,beautiful, confident, blissful, bewildered, glad, free, exhilarated, calm,astonished, cheerful, eager, hopeful, joyful, optimistic, proud, radiant,relaxed, sensitive, ashamed, bored, confused, dejected, disgruntled, displeased,dull, fatigued, guilty, hostile, irate, jealous, lazy, or lonely.Avoid words that require another person to “make” you feel a certain way. Forexample, you cannot feel “attacked” by yourself—that emotion does not arise fromyou but from your response to another. Other words to avoid: abandoned, abused,betrayed, cheated, coerced, diminished, manipulated, misunderstood, overworked,rejected, unheard, unseen, unsupported. When you use these words to identifyyour feelings, this means that you are giving others too much power over youremotions. If so, you’ll tend to attract people who evoke these feelings, and getcaught in a vicious cycle. It’s very difficult to be happy until you startowning your own emotions.STEP 3:State Your Needs ClearlyAsk yourself, What do I need in this situation? You wouldn’t be having strongfeelings if all your needs were being met. Identify the need as specifically aspossible. Start with your gut reaction; then work your way down the chain ofdesires until you find some specific examples of things to ask for. For example,“I need to feel loved. Why?” “I feel lonely—I need to feel less alone. Why?” “Idon’t have close friends—I need to find some friends and develop relationships.”This line of thought eventually leads to something you can ask of anotherperson. You cannot ask another person to make you feel loved; that is beyondanyone’s capability. But you can ask another person to go out to a movie withyou, to come to a party, to have a cup of coffee.STEP 4:Ask, Don’t DemandOnce we identify a need and are ready to make a request, we often demand ratherthan request that our needs be met. Demands are less likely to be fulfilledbecause people inherently respond poorly to demands. Most people, however, arehappy to fulfill a request.For example, instead of demanding, “Pick up the dry cleaning,” you’ll be morelikely to get a positive response if you ask, “Would you please pick up the drycleaning?”In addition, as in step 3, you’ll want to ask for a particular specificbehavior. The more specific the behavior, the more likely it is that yourrequest will be answered. For example, instead of saying, “Love me forever,” youmight ask, “Will you marry me?” Instead of asking the general question, “Can wespend more time together?” you might ask, “Can we go to the park thisafternoon?” These steps are helpful in all situations, but they are especially helpful ifthere’s a conflict. Whenever you are part of a tense situation, allow yourselfto take a step back from the emotions of the moment and choose consciouscommunication. What do you observe? How does it make you feel? Determine yourneed. Make a request. This should help short-circuit a potentially volatilesituation and allow you to maintain your equanimity—or at least regain it.Exercise 10:HEALING CHILDHOOD ANGERFor this exercise, you will need approximately ten minutes of uninterruptedtime.Think back to yesterday. Imagine that your memory is a videocassette that youcan rewind to any time you choose. Right now, take it back just twenty-fourhours. What were some of the things you did during the day? Did anythingfrighten you or make you angry? It doesn’t have to be anything especiallyimportant or dramatic—you may have felt impatient waiting in line, or you mighthave witnessed someone being rude or inconsiderate. For the next minute or so,try to remember the events of the day in as much detail as you can. Focus on amoment of anger, becoming aware of the sensations in your body as well as theemotions in your mind.Next, rewind that videotape back even farther. Think back exactly one year. Tryto recall what you were doing a year ago on this date, or as close to it as youcan remember. What was on your mind at that time? Do you recall being worried orangry about something? Try to feel the emotions of that time in your mind and inyour body. Are the feelings the same as the feelings you remember feelingyesterday?Rewind the tape even farther back to when you were a teenager. Again, focus on asituation that made you angry or frightened. Relive the feelings, mentally andphysically. Notice how the anger that you experienced yesterday has been builton emotions from so long ago.Try now to remember an incident from childhood. What is the earliest time inyour life that you can recall being really angry? Bring that experience intoyour awareness. Where were you when it happened? Who else was there? Who or whatwas it that made you so angry? Feel all the sensations created by that anger.Notice how the fear and anger have accumulated over the years. Although youcannot remember it, there was a time in your life before you ever felt anger orfear, a time of total peace and tranquillity. Try to imagine what thatexperience of utter bliss might have been like. Focus on a time before fear oranger. Rewind that imaginary tape of your life until the screen goes black, andfeel the boundaries evaporate between yourself and your surroundings. For thenext minute, feel the total loss of all your accumulated anger, fear, and ego.With that feeling of total bliss still in your awareness, begin to move thatimaginary videotape forward again. Visit the same points in your life that youstopped at earlier—those angry or fearful moments from your childhood, yourteenage years, a year ago, yesterday. As you envision these scenes again,introduce the experience of bliss back into the setting. Instead of allowing onemoment of anger to build upon another, begin to erase these moments one by one,from earliest childhood to just yesterday. Spend a minute or so feeling theanger and fear being erased by this memory of bliss. And as those feelings areerased, allow the toxic buildup of years of anger and fear to be erased fromyour spirit.You can use this exercise at any time to attack the anger problem at its roots.Many people find it especially useful at night, just before they go to sleep, sothey wake up blissful and without residual anger.Sutra Statementsfor the Fifth Principleimage [../images/00003.jpeg]Imagine that you are without physical form, a field of awareness everywhere atall times.(moksha)Imagine that you have left behind forever any sense of anger or resentment.(moksha)Imagine that you are free from blaming, free from feeling blame and guilt.(moksha)Imagine that you are never drawn into melodrama or hysteria.(moksha)Imagine that you can choose any emotional feeling you want to experience.(moksha)Imagine that you can set any goal you want to achieve and actually achieve it.(moksha)Imagine that you are free of your habitual compulsions and patterns of behavior.(moksha)Imagine that you are free of any addictions.(moksha)Imagine that you never participate in any gossip.(moksha)Imagine that you are free to respond at the highest level, no matter what thesituation is or how anyone else behaves.(moksha)Imagine that there are no limitations to what you can manifest.(moksha)Imagine that you can see infinite possibilities at all times.(moksha)"},{"pageContent":"13image [../images/00003.jpeg]The Sixth Principle:Celebrate the Danceof the CosmosSUTRA: Shiva-Shakti (SHE-vah SHOCK-tee)I am giving birth to the gods and goddesses inside me; they express all theirattributes and powers through me.The sixth principle encourages us to live life fully by embracing both themasculine and the feminine aspects of our being.One way to embrace both aspects of your self is to call upon both masculine andfeminine archetypes. According to Carl Jung, archetypes are inherited memoriesrepresented in the mind as universal symbols, and can be observed in dreams andmyths. They are states of awareness. Archetypes are universal concentrations ofpsychic energy.Archetypes exist as potential and lie dormant in your consciousness. Everyonehas at least one archetype, which stays dormant until triggered by somesituation in the environment or in the conscious or unconscious mental life of aperson. Once triggered, the archetype will manifest its powers and attributesthrough you. What you do with your life is usually a representation to someextent of the combination of your archetypes. For example, a person who wieldsexceptional power in the world, such as a king or a president, will likely haveZeus or Hera as archetypes of power and leadership. But if that person is alsoexceptionally wise, he or she might also have Athena as an archetype of wisdom.It is possible to consciously trigger your archetype through intent. Once youdiscover your primary archetypes, you can begin to call them to you daily.Surround yourself with symbols, words, or representations that remind you ofyour archetypes. With such symbols next to your bed, let these be the firstthings you look at when you wake up in the morning. Ask your archetypes fortheir guidance and wisdom, and ask that they become part of you and work throughyou. This can be as simple as saying, “I ask that you become part of me and workthrough me. Guide me through my life.”If you invite your archetypes in this way just after your daily meditation, youwill start to feel their presence more strongly and more directly. They canprovide access to the hidden strengths within you.Exercise 11:FINDING THE COSMOS WITHINRead this into a tape and play it to yourself.Sit or lie comfortably with your eyes closed. Quiet your internal dialogue byobserving your breath.After a few minutes put your attention on your heart. Visualize your heart as apulsating sphere of light. In this sphere visualize two or three divine beingsor archetypal energies. These could be angels, gods, or goddesses. Now visualizethe rest of your body also as a body of light. Now slowly imagine this lightbody with its pulsating sphere of divine beings expanding so it fills the entireroom in which you are sitting or lying. Allow the expansion to occur beyond theconfines of the room so that you are no longer in the room but in fact the roomis in you. Continue the process of expanding your light body so that the entirecity in which you live exists in your being—the buildings, the people, thetraffic, and the countryside.Continue to expand your sense of self to include in your physical being thestate in which you live, your country, and ultimately the entire planet. Now seethat the whole world exists in you—all the people, all other sentient beings,trees and forests, rivers and mountains, rainfall and sunshine, earth andwater—these are different components of your being, just like different organsin your body.Now quietly say to yourself, “I am not in the world; the world is in me.”Whatever imbalances you see in this world of yours, ask the divine beings stilldancing in your pulsating sphere of a heart to correct them. Ask these divinebeings to fulfill any desire you have and to bring harmony, beauty, healing, andjoy to the different parts of your cosmic self. Continue to expand your sense ofself to include planets and moons, stars and galaxies.Now say to yourself, “I am not in the universe; the universe is in me.” Slowlybegin to diminish the size of your cosmic self until you can once againexperience your personal body. Imagine trillions of cells in your personalbody—all part of a dance, each cell an entire universe unto itself. Remindyourself that your true being inhabits all these levels of creation, frommicrocosm to macrocosm, from the atom to the universe, from your personal bodyto your cosmic body. Remind yourself that at each of these levels of yourexistence you have available to you the divine energies that nonlocallyorchestrate the cosmic dance to create the harmonious interaction of elementsand forces that can fulfill any desire. Express your gratitude to thesearchetypal energies.Now just remain sitting or lying quietly, feeling all the sensations in yourbody. You may feel tingling or exhilaration. After two or three minutes, openyour eyes. The exercise is over.Sutra Statementsfor the Sixth Principleimage [../images/00003.jpeg]Imagine that you are a shape-shifter.(Shiva-Shakti)Imagine that you can be both masculine and feminine if you choose.(Shiva-Shakti)Imagine that you are strong, decisive, courageous, articulate, and powerful.(Shiva-Shakti)Imagine that you are beautiful, sexual, intuitive, nurturing, and affectionate.(Shiva-Shakti)Imagine that you are as stable as a mountain.(Shiva-Shakti)Imagine that you are as flexible as the wind.(Shiva-Shakti)Imagine that you are an angel with wings.(Shiva-Shakti)Imagine that you are an enlightened being with infinite compassion.(Shiva-Shakti)Imagine that you are a divine being of God playing in celestial realms.(Shiva-Shakti)Imagine once again that you are a shape-shifter, that you can become any animal,any bird, any insect, any plant, or even a rock.(Shiva-Shakti)Imagine that all the mythical beings reside in you, although there are some thatareyour favorite archetypes.(Shiva-Shakti)Imagine that you can become the heroes and heroines you most admire.(Shiva-Shakti)"},{"pageContent":"14image [../images/00003.jpeg]The Seventh Principle:Accessing the Conspiracyof ImprobabilitiesSUTRA: Ritam (REE-tahm)I am alert, awake to coincidences, and know that they are messages from God. Iflow with the cosmic dance.The seventh principle incorporates all the other aspects of synchrodestiny toform an approach to life that comes from peaceful awareness.Ritam means “I am alert to the conspiracy of improbabilities.”Every event has a particular likelihood of happening, or probability. Theprobability of winning the lottery is very low. The probability of winning thelottery without buying a ticket is even lower.We maximize the probability that something will happen by our actions. And manyof our actions are determined by our karmic conditioning—those interpretationsof past experiences and relationships that form and affect our life’s memoriesand desires. If we have had past experiences of being lucky, the probability ofbuying a lottery ticket increases. But a person who has never won anything feelsdefeated even before the ticket is purchased, and may never buy the ticket atall.In order to change your life, therefore, you must break free of your presentkarmic conditioning. You’ve got to change your interpretation of what happens inyour life. You must transform yourself into the person for whom the probabilityof great things happening increases. And this transformation starts at the levelof the soul. The soul gives meaning to events. The soul takes actions byinfluencing our minds. And for every action, there is a memory, aninterpretation. Meaning, experience, interpretation, memory, desire—all of theseare very closely connected through the karmic cycle. We get used to a certain way of doing things and continue that pattern out ofhabit, simply because it is comfortable. In order to change your life, you haveto find a way to break the pattern. This is not easy, but people do it everyday. The best way is to watch for signs of new probabilities—and those signscome to us in the form of coincidences.Coincidences are messages from the nonlocal domain, invitations to break ourkarmic bonds. Coincidences invite us to relinquish the known and embrace theunknown. A coincidence is a creative, quantum leap in the behavior of theuniverse itself. Since the known is itself a habit of past conditioning,creativity and freedom exist in the unknown—anything that breaks through theprobability amplitude set by karma. That is why it is important to look forcoincidences, to keep a record of them. When you notice coincidences, you candiscover their hidden meanings for your life.A coincidence is, by definition, a synchronistic experience. It comes from thenonlocal domain, and affects our world in unpredictable ways. The very fact thatit’s a coincidence means that it is a message from God. We must take heed, andthen take action. This is our opportunity for a creative response. The goal ofenlightenment is to go beyond the probability pattern and experience truefreedom. This is why it is important to never ignore a coincidence. Never passup a chance to see what the universe has planned for you. And if you payattention to coincidences, you’ll find that they accelerate, creating even moreopportunities.This is the secret of synchrodestiny. All the ideas presented here are theruling principles of the universe. If you make them the guideposts of your ownlife, you live the life of your dreams. Understanding that these principles arenot just abstractions, that actually they are operating in everything we do, isreally more than just awareness: It’s really a kind of celebration. When youhave mastered synchrodestiny, when you have learned to synchronize your lifewith the universe itself, you are celebrating the cosmic dance.Exercise 12:PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHERGo to a place where a lot of activity is taking place, such as a shopping mall.Buy something to eat from the food court. Sit on a bench. Close your eyes. Withfull awareness, taste the food, smell its aroma, and feel its texture. Whilekeeping your eyes closed, pay attention to all the sounds in your environment.What’s that music in the background? Christmas carols? The theme song of amovie? Can you tune in to the conversation of the people next to you? Can youhear scattered phrases, words? Do any sounds strike you as attractive, or drawyour attention more than others?Now put your awareness in your body; feel everything around you. The hardness orsoftness of the bench or sofa—is it wood, or metal, or fabric?Now open your eyes and observe the scene around you, the people walking, thecolors, the shops, the items in the windows, and the art galleries.Now close your eyes and in your imagination note once again what you haveexperienced—the tastes, the smells, the textures, the colors and the objects yousaw, the sounds you heard. Now pick an item from each of your sensoryexperiences. An example of these might include the following: strawberry icecream on your tongue, the smell of baking bread, the touch of craggy rocks underyour feet, a beautiful painting of the sun setting over hills, Christmas carols,and the theme song from the James Bond movie Goldfinger. Now tell yourself thatall these sounds, smells, textures, and tastes are part of a story. Ask yourselfwhat the story is. Ask your nonlocal self to reveal the story to you. Now let goand assume that your nonlocal self will provide the answer in the form of asynchronistic experience.The exercise above is an actual example of an experience I had at a shoppingmall during Christmastime. One year later I was in Jamaica. I had taken a driveinto the countryside. I saw a scene very similar to the picture in thepainting—a beautiful sunset over a hill by the ocean. Upon inquiry I learnedthat this place was called Strawberry Hill and the James Bond movie Goldfingerhad been shot here. There was a beautiful hotel on Strawberry Hill. I decided togo inside. They had a luxurious spa. The spa director was delighted to meet me,and he told me that he had been looking for me for the last several weeksbecause he wanted advice on Ayurvedic therapies. We ended up talking about amutual collaboration. Several years later I also met the owner of the hotel, whowas a record company executive. His wife had an illness for which she consultedme, and we became close friends. He helped me with great advice when I producedmy first music CD with healing meditations. Many years later our friendshipshave continued to evolve, and we feel bonded to each other in the spirit oflove; we know we are karmically connected.Sutra Statementsfor the Seventh Principleimage [../images/00003.jpeg]Imagine that you move in rhythm with the impulses of a conscious universe.(ritam)Imagine that you dance to the rhythm of the universe.(ritam)Imagine that your body’s rhythms are in perfect order.(ritam)Imagine that your body is a symphony.(ritam)Imagine that you are the harmony of the universe.(ritam)Imagine that every time you seek something, the universe provides clues in theform of coincidences.(ritam)Imagine that there is a connection between what happens in your dreams and whathappens in your waking life.(ritam)Imagine that you are transforming and evolving into a higher being.(ritam)Imagine that there is meaning and purpose to everything that happens andeverything you do.(ritam)Imagine that you have a contribution to make to the world.(ritam)Imagine that life is full of coincidences.(ritam)Imagine that you notice what others may not notice.(ritam)Imagine that you see the hidden meaning behind events.(ritam)Imagine that life is full of peak experiences.(ritam)Imagine that you have unique talents that you use to serve and help others.(ritam)Imagine that all your relationships are nurturing and playful.(ritam)Imagine that you delight in play and humor.(ritam)"},{"pageContent":"15image [../images/00003.jpeg]Living SynchrodestinyI’d like to return again to the question I asked at the beginning of the book:If you knew that miracles could happen, what miracles would you wish for?Most people dream first of having enough money. Having a billion dollars in thebank would certainly mean less financial anxiety. We tend to think that once wehave that kind of security, then we would be free to choose the life that makesus happiest, that fulfills our inner needs, that marks our stay on earth asvaluable in some way. If you knew you could have it all and do anything youwanted, what would you choose to have and what would you choose to do?Synchrodestiny allows you to make these miracles happen, without limits, withoutend. And it does this by gently and progressively nudging you from the local tothe nonlocal domain. When we live only in the local domain, we are impoverished.Our spiritual bank accounts are empty. In the local domain, where most of usreside all the time, you can never be sure of what’s going to happen next. Areyou going to make it through the day, the week, the month? Here your actionswill carry the burden of anxiety. Your thoughts will be clouded with doubt, andyour intentions will be blocked by ego concerns.But using synchrodestiny to get in touch with the nonlocal domain allows you toenter into a realm of infinite creativity and infinite correlation. Here youhave inner security; you are free of anxiety, and free to be the person you weremeant to be. You have the spiritual equivalent of a billion dollars in the bank.In the nonlocal domain you have an unlimited supply of knowledge, ofinspiration, of creativity, of potential. You have access to an infinite supplyof everything the universe has to offer. Whatever else happens in your life, youare calm, secure, and infinitely blessed.The principles of synchrodestiny offer a direct route to developing yourconnection with the nonlocal domain. Practice meditation and review the dailySutra Statements, and in time you will find yourself connected with spirit in away that makes miracles not only possible, but a natural part of your everydaylife.Like any other worthwhile journey, living synchrodestiny will require somesacrifice on your part. You need to sacrifice your mistaken ideas that the worldoperates like a well-oiled machine without consciousness. You need to sacrificeyour notion that you are alone in the world. You need to sacrifice the myth thata magical life is not possible. Some people live magical lives all the time.They have learned how to get back in touch with the boundless energy that liesat the heart of the universe. They have learned to watch for clues to theintention of the nonlocal expressed through coincidences, and to derive meaningfrom those clues so they know what actions are needed to increase theprobability that wondrous things will happen.SYNCHRODESTINY AND STATES OFCONSCIOUSNESSAccording to Vedanta, there are seven states of consciousness, but many of themhave not been thoroughly investigated by modern medical researchers. Indeed,some of them are not even recognized by mainstream science. In India, one of thegreatest seers of the twentieth century, Sri Aurobindo, said that because we arein a very early stage of human evolution, most of us experience only the firstthree states of consciousness: sleeping, dreaming, and wakefulness. Eventuallywe will recognize and understand the more expanded states of consciousness, andwhen we do, such concepts as synchronicity, telepathy, clairvoyance, andknowledge of past lives will become commonly accepted.Each of the seven states of consciousness represents an increase in ourexperience of synchronicity, and each progressive state moves us closer to theideal of enlightenment. Everyone commonly experiences the first three.Unfortunately, most people never move beyond these three basic states.The first level of consciousness is deep sleep. In deep sleep there is someawareness—we still respond to stimuli such as sound, bright light, or touch—butmostly our senses are dulled and there is very little cognition or perception.The second state of consciousness is dreaming. During dreams, we are a littlemore awake and a little more alert than during deep sleep. When we dream, we arehaving experiences. We see images; we hear sounds. We even think in our dreams.While we are dreaming, the world of our dreams seems real, important, andrelevant. It’s only after we wake up that we recognize the dream as a realitythat was confined to that particular moment when we were dreaming and perhapsnot directly relevant like our waking life.The third state of consciousness is being awake. This is the state most of usare in most of the time. Measurable brain activity during the waking state ofconsciousness is quite different when compared with brain activity during bothdeep sleep and dreaming.The fourth state of consciousness occurs when we actually glimpse the soul, whenwe transcend, when we become, even for a fraction of a moment, absolutely stilland quiet and become aware of the observer inside us. This state ofconsciousness occurs during meditation, when we experience the gap, that quietmoment between our thoughts. People who meditate regularly have this experienceevery time they meditate. As a result, their state of self expands.The fourth state of consciousness also produces its own physiological effects.Cortisol and adrenaline levels decrease. Stress is reduced. Blood pressure goesdown. And immune function improves. Brain researchers have shown that when youhave the experience of the gap between thoughts, your brain activity is verydifferent from when you are merely awake and alert. This means that glimpsingthe soul produces physiological changes, both in the brain and in the body. Inthis fourth state of consciousness, just as we can glimpse the soul, we can alsoglimpse the beginnings of synchronicity.The fifth state of consciousness is called cosmic consciousness. In this state,your spirit can observe your material body. Your awareness goes beyond simplybeing awake in your body, and beyond simply glimpsing the soul, to being awakeand alert to your place as part of the infinite spirit. Even when your body issleeping, your spirit—the silent observer—is looking at the body in deep sleep,almost as if you were having an out-of-body experience. When that happens thereis an alert witnessing awareness, not only when you’re sleeping and dreaming,but also when you’re fully awake. The spirit is observing, and you are thespirit. The observer can observe the body while it’s dreaming, andsimultaneously observe the dream. The same experience occurs in wakeningconsciousness. Your body might be playing a tennis match or speaking on thephone or watching television. All the while, your spirit is observing thebody/mind in these activities.This fifth stage is called cosmic consciousness because you have two qualitiesto your awareness, local and nonlocal, at the same time. In this fifth state,when you sense your connection to nonlocal intelligence, synchronicity reallystarts to manifest. In this state, you realize that part of you is localized andpart of you, being nonlocal, is connected to everything. You fully live yourinseparability to all that exists. Your intuition increases. Your creativityincreases. Your insight increases. Research shows that when people have achieveda state of cosmic consciousness such that they have this witnessing experience,their brain waves have the quality of meditation even when they are engaged inactivity. These people might be playing soccer, but their brain waves areidentical to those of a person who is meditating.The sixth state of consciousness is called divine consciousness. In this state,the witness becomes more and more awake. In divine consciousness you not onlyfeel the presence of spirit in yourself, but you start to feel that same spiritin all other beings. You see the presence of spirit in plants. Ultimately youfeel the presence of spirit in rocks. You recognize that the animating force oflife expresses itself in all the objects of the universe, in both the observerand the observed, in both the seer and the scenery. This divine consciousnessallows us to see the presence of God in all things. People in a state of divineconsciousness are even able to communicate with animals and plants.This is not a constant state of consciousness for most people. You move in andout of it. But all the great prophets and seers, including Jesus Christ, Buddha,many yogis, and many saints, lived in divine consciousness.The seventh and last stage of consciousness, the ultimate goal, is called unityconsciousness. This may also be called enlightenment. In unity consciousness,the spirit in the perceiver and the spirit in that which is perceived merge andbecome one. When this happens, you see the whole world as an extension of yourown being. You not only identify with your personal consciousness, but you seethat the whole world is a projection of your own self. There’s a completetransformation of the personal self into the universal self. In this stage,miracles are commonplace, but they are not even necessary because the infiniterealm of possibility is available at every moment. You transcend life. Youtranscend death. You are the spirit that always was and always will be.HOW TO MOVE THROUGH THESTAGES OF CONSCIOUSNESSSynchrodestiny accelerates our ability to advance through the stages ofconsciousness using four approaches. The first, and most important, is dailymeditation. Meditation allows us to glimpse the soul through the gaps betweenthoughts and discover the silent observer within us. It is the step that allowsus to move from the third to the fourth state of consciousness, from beingmerely awake to being awake and aware of the soul.The second approach involves practicing recapitulation as described in Chapter5. Recapitulation allows us to cultivate that silent observer who can move usfrom the fourth to the fifth state of consciousness. Recapitulation allows us torecognize that what was real during the day is now already part of the dream,just as the reality of a dream fades as we awaken. Just telling yourself, “I’mgoing to witness my dreams,” allows you to experience what people call “luciddreaming.” Soon you can become the choreographer and the director of yourdreams, changing them as you go. If you recapitulate your waking day and yourdreams, you eventually start to have that experience of witnessing both yourdreams and your waking moments.The third approach involves nurturing relationships, experiencing them as theconnection of spirit to spirit, not ego to ego. This facilitates moving to thesixth state of consciousness. Letting go of your need for approval and controlaccelerates this process. When people are truly in tune with each other, thenthey experience synchronicity in their relationship. The fourth approach entailsreading the sutras. In my experience, if you read the same sentence, the samesutra, every day, that sentence will begin to take on new meanings and engendernew experiences as your consciousness or awareness expands. Vedic wisdom holdsthat “Knowledge is different in different states of consciousness.” As yourconsciousness expands, the same sentences start to take on new nuances ofmeaning, which in turn yield a deeper understanding. That understandinginfluences how you experience the world, and those experiences can influenceyour state of consciousness. With time and practice, you will learn to see theworld in ways you never thought possible, full of magic and miracles, fulfillingyour heart’s every desire.WHAT TO EXPECT FROMSYNCHRODESTINYAlthough the ideas presented in this book can be the beginning of a lifetime ofpersonal evolution and fulfillment, it’s up to you to choose whether or not topenetrate the conspiracy of improbabilities and find the hidden treasure thatlies behind it. You may start on the path to synchrodestiny as a way to attainwealth, or to find more meaningful relationships, or to become successful inyour career. Synchrodestiny certainly can do that for you. But the ultimate goalof synchrodestiny is to expand your consciousness and open a doorway toenlightenment. Enjoy the journey. Each stage brings new wonders, new ways ofperceiving and living in the world. Think of synchrodestiny as a kind of rebirthor awakening. Just as your waking days are dramatically different and moreexciting than being in a deep sleep, so does awakening to the fifth, sixth, orseventh states of consciousness provide an expansion in what you can experience.Through synchrodestiny, you can finally become the person the universe intendedyou to be—as powerful as desire, as creative as spirit. All it takes is aneagerness to join the cosmic dance, and a willingness to seek the miracles ofthe soul.Once these miracles start to increase as part of your experience of life, youwill begin to realize that synchrodestiny is just the symptom of a more profoundphenomenon. This profound phenomenon is a shift in your identity and anawakening to who you really are. You begin to understand that the real you isnot a person at all. The real you is a field of intelligence in which the personyou have identified yourself with, all other persons, as well as the environmentin which they exist all co-arise and co-evolve as a result of your ownself-interactions. You no longer think of the universe as a sum total ofseparate and distinct particles but as a coherent, unbroken wholeness in whichthe personality you currently identify with and its thoughts, all otherpersonalities and their thoughts, and all events and relationships are mutuallyinterdependent, interpenetrating patterns—a single behavior of your nonlocalself. You are the luminous mystery in which the entire universe with all itsforms and phenomena arises and subsides. When this realization dawns there is acomplete transformation of your personal self into your universal self; there isexperiential knowledge of immortality, the complete loss of all fear, includingthe fear of death. You have become a being that radiates love the same way thesun radiates light. You have finally arrived at the place from which yourjourney began. The local self is a transient and impermanent behavior of the nonlocal self. Itcomes and goes while the nonlocal self continues to evolve into higherexperiences of abstraction and creativity. Don’t stand by my grave and weep,For I am not there.I do not sleep.I am a thousand winds that blow,I am the diamond’s glint on snow,I am the sunlight on ripened grain,I am the gentle autumn’s rain.In the soft hush of the morning lightI am the swift bird in flight.Don’t stand by my grave and cry,I am not there,I did not die.—UNKNOWN NATIVE AMERICAN AUTHOR"},{"pageContent":"If you have an example from your life of harnessing the infinite power ofcoincidence to experience the spontaneous fulfillment of desire and would liketo share it, please visit our website, www.chopra.com [http://www.Chopra.com],and click on “Spontaneous Fulfillment of Desire.” I would be delighted to learnof your experience.

These techniques, particularly the sutras, aredrawn from one of the world’s most ancient wisdom traditions, Vedanta. InSanskrit the word veda means “knowledge.” Vedanta is the culmination, the peak,or the end of all knowledge. In other words, Vedanta is the cream of the Veda.The core premise of this ancient body of knowledge is that spirit, orconsciousness, is the ultimate reality. It is the nonlocal ground of being,which differentiates into objective and subjective reality simultaneously.Subjective reality exists as your thoughts, feelings, emotions, desires,imagination, fantasies, memories, and deepest aspirations. Objective reality isyour physical body and the world you experience through your senses. Both theserealities coexist simultaneously and interdependently. They do not cause eachother, yet they are interdependent. They are acausally related to each other.Just as a single cell in the womb differentiates into brain cells, nerve cells,and retinal cells, and through them gives us an experience of the world, so toothe single non-local spirit becomes both observer and observed, the physicalsenses and the physical world, the biological organism and its environment,thoughts as well as emotions.Your inner and outer worlds are both part of a continuum, a single, unifiedfield of activity. The outer world is a mirror of who you are at any particularpoint in space-time. Many have expressed this idea in various ways. Spiritualteachers tell us if you want to know the state of your personal consciousness,just look around and see what is happening to you. If you want to know the stateof the collective consciousness, just look around at what is happening in theworld. At any given point in time your personal reality is synchronistically,coincidentally orchestrated by your sense of self.If your sense of self is constricted, then it expresses itself as a tight andconstricted body, a fearful outlook, and an insecure environment. On the otherhand, if your sense of self is expanded, it experiences a relaxed body and afriendly, open environment where your intentions synchronistically fulfillthemselves. Your expanded self always feels a sense of worth, feels at peace,feels free and unbounded, feels in flow, and feels a sense of awe at the mysteryof existence. Sense of self also determines attitude. Greed, arrogance,aggression, and a demanding, disgruntled, and unhappy disposition all arise froma constricted sense of self. Sharing, humility, nurturing, a conciliatory,gracious, and fulfilled disposition all arise from the expanded self.In the broader sense of self, a critical mass of people in societies,communities, and institutions also determines the attitude of these largerbodies. When a culture has a constricted identity, its emphasis is predominantlyon profit-making, ruthless competition, economic imperialism, extremenationalism, military conflict, violence, and fear. If a critical mass of peoplewere to express their expanded selves, not only would they spontaneously fulfilltheir personal desires, they would change the very way culture articulatesitself. In such a transformed culture the emphasis would be on service ratherthan on greed, cooperation instead of competition, open hearts instead of onlymarkets. Cultural hallmarks would be nonviolent conflict resolution, compassion,humility, peace, and social and economic justice.If we look at the world today, we see a tangled hierarchy of interdependentlyco-arising events. Social scientists claim our collective behavior is creatingan unsustainable environment due to depletion of timber, minerals, and fossilfuels, leading to other devastating effects such as the greenhouse effect,changing weather patterns, hurricanes, and rising ocean tides. On the surfacethese different events don’t seem related, but they are. They are the result ofour constricted collective sense of self, and they synchronistically,simultaneously co-arise. Religious conflict, pollution, terrorism, depletion oftopsoil, nuclear plants, drug addiction, extinction of species, poverty, crime,drug wars, the gun industry, floods and famine, dangerous chemicals in the foodchain, and wars are all acausally related.If each of us could aspire to express the expanded self, and if we could sharethe knowledge and experience of our expanded selves with one another, perhaps wecould create an environment based on respect for life, and achieve a restorationof balance in the oceans, the forests, and the wilderness. This transformedenvironment would, in turn, result in the simultaneous co-arising of events thatwould lead to a completely new world. On this ideal planet we would find peaceof mind, a sense of the sacred, economic partnerships and prosperity, efficientand clean energy industries, a scientific understanding of the new reality, aflourishing of the arts and philosophy, and a true awareness of ourinseparability. In such a society we would see clearly that love is the ultimateforce at the heart of the universe. Your ability to spontaneously fulfill your desires is directly proportional toyour experience of your nonlocal self. Although the wisdom traditions,particularly Vedanta, give us deep insight into the nature of nonlocal reality,only recently have scientists begun to explore this domain of existence.Throughout this book I have emphasized this new, scientific basis for theunderstanding of synchronicity and the spontaneous fulfillment of desire. TheChopra Foundation is actively involved in collaborative studies with scientiststo further explore the scientific basis of nonlocality.The following is a subjective, selected list of references for further readingon nonlocality. Some of the entries, including certain scientific journals, arequite technical, and may not be easy to understand without a scientificbackground. Other sources, such as Larry Dossey’s book Healing Words, are veryaccessible. In either event this list is offered in the hope that you will useit to deepen your understanding of the world where we are all instantlyconnected, where we are, in fact, inseparably one."},{"pageContent":"SELECTEDREFERENCES ONNONLOCALITYAstin, J.

The first appendix articulatesmuch of what we have already learned, but this time we shift from a historicaland philosophical perspective with roots in the ancient East to the great earlycivilizations of Greece, Rome, and Egypt. As always, there is value to bederived from seeing things from a fresh point of view. The second appendix usesa story from one of the great Vedic texts to illustrate “that which cannot beseen but makes seeing possible, that which cannot be known but makes knowingpossible, that which cannot be imagined but makes imagination possible.”I hope you will find these additions helpful.—D.C.APPENDIX AIn the previous pages we have explored how the nonlocal self differentiates intothe cosmos, and we have also learned how to make practical use of this knowledgefor the spontaneous fulfillment of desire. To these ends the wisdom tradition ofVedanta has been reinterpreted in our modern, contemporary, scientificframework. Lest you, the reader, think that this knowledge exists only in theesoteric schools of the East, I offer in the following paragraphs closelyparallel insights from hermetic philosophy, or hermeticism as it is also known,which have been passed down to us through the ages from ancient schools inGreece, Rome, and Egypt.Hermeticism is a mystical philosophy that deals with magic, alchemy, and othermanifestations from the spiritual into the material world. The origin ofhermetic knowledge traces back to Hermes Trismagistus, about whom not much isknown, including the date or place of his birth. Scholars suppose that he livedaround 2,000 B.C.E. Many think he was an Egyptian priest, the inventor of bothart and science as we know them in the western world. The mystery of HermesMagistus—“the three-time great”—was addressed by both Greek and Roman mystics invarious ancient documents. Mythology has elevated him to the rank of a god,perhaps the ibis-headed moon god Thoth, the Egyptian god of healing,intelligence, and letters. According to one tradition, Thoth was the architectof the great pyramids of Giza.Over the last two millennia hermetic wisdom has been a source for a variety ofGnostic writings or teachings. It is not clear whether these were originally theteachings of one person or in fact the mystical visions of several seers ofGreek, Roman, and Egyptian origin. In any event the fundamental tenets ofhermetic philosophy can be summarized in the following insights or principles. The first insight is that everything is a manifestation of spirit. Spirit is thestate of being that gives rise to space, time, causation, matter, and energy.Infinite and unbounded, spirit contains the entire universe that we experience.Nothing exists outside it. Spirit is the source of the whole chain of being, thewhole of existence. The universe arises from spirit, is contained in it andultimately disappears back into it. This is the first insight, which provides uswith a very clear description of the nonlocal domain. The second insight is that as spirit becomes manifest, it does so in such a waythat the whole is contained in every part. Today’s science calls this theholographic model—that the whole is contained in every part. As atoms reflectthe universe, so too does the human body reflect the cosmic body and the humanmind the cosmic mind. What does this mean? It proposes that in any one thing youbehold, indeed in every conceivable thing you can imagine, there also exists thelatent potentiality for all things—for absolutely everything. The whole universeis contained in every point just as the whole ocean is reflected in every dropwithin its depths. In Vedanta this insight is expressed as “What is here iseverywhere, and what is not here is nowhere.”This principle means that you don’t have to go in search of anything to find thetruth. The truth is always right here, staring at you in the face. So when wewonder, “If there are human beings here, does that mean that life existselsewhere in the universe?” the answer is absolutely yes. Exploring the moleculeis like exploring the galaxy. Similarly, everything is contained in the groundof your own being. Rumi says the whole universe is contained within your self,and this is a fundamental truth. According to biblical literature the kingdom ofHeaven is within you. The treasure house lies right here, before you. In the NewTestament Jesus says, “Ask and you shall receive. Knock and it shall be openedunto you. Seek and you will find.”Our educational system is based on accumulating more and more information, butactually the more information we gather, the more confused we become and themore we lose sight of the wisdom that is already inherent within us. So learn toask the truth of yourself. Learn to knock on the door of your own being. This iswhat is known as intuition, creativity, vision, and prophecy. This is why a sageis focused on the seer and not the scenery. The seer is the nonlocal self. The third insight states that everything is vibration, that consciousnessconsists of vibrations in various frequencies, resulting in all the forms andphenomena of the universe. Human beings are conscious energy fields, along withthe rest of the universe. If you want to change the world around you, you needonly change the quality of your own vibration; as you change that, the qualityof what is around you changes. Incidentally, this is the reason why sutras work.They provide one particular way to create a certain vibration of spirit, or aparticular flavor of the nonlocal self.The situations, circumstances, events, and relationships that you encounter inyour life are a reflection of the state of consciousness you are in. The worldis a mirror. If you are anchored in your nonlocal self the whole world isavailable to you. The fourth insight is that change is the only constant. Everything isimpermanent. Holding on to anything is like holding on to your breath; if youhold on long enough, you’ll suffocate. Ultimately the only way to acquireanything in the physical universe is to let go of it and not hold on.This is a very delicate point. It means that the best results are achieved whenwe focus on process rather than on outcome. Focusing on the outcome createsanxiety and stress, which interferes with the spontaneous flow of intelligenceas it moves from the unmanifest domain (spirit) to the manifest domain (thematerial world). The fact that change is the only constant means that we arealways living in the unknown.Everything that we call the known is past, and the only thing we can say aboutit with certainty is that it is no longer here. The known is the prison of pastconditioning. The unknown is always fresh, which is a quality of the field ofinfinite possibilities. Zen masters, martial artists, and great spiritualteachers have always advised that we must go with the flow. The flow is thefield of change. What doesn’t change decays and dies. Change is the dance andrhythm of the universe. To have one-pointed intention, to flow with the change,and to be detached from outcome at the same time: These are the mechanics of thefulfillment of desire, which orchestrates synchrodestiny. The fifth insight is that everything, whether it is an experience or an attitudeor an object, contains its opposite. In fact, whatever you have right now, goodor bad, contains its counterpart. No matter how deep you may be in the depths ofdepression, for example, if you identify its opposite—joy or gratitude—and payattention to it, you’ll see that it starts to grow in your awareness. Removingyour attention from despair and placing it on happiness actually makes the newfeeling blossom. Similarly, if you’re at the heights of ecstasy, be aware thatits opposite walks by its side. By being mindful of this principle—that all ofcreation is based on the co-creation and co-existence of opposites—you can usethe quality of your attention to bring out whatever aspect of experience youdesire. The sixth insight states that there is a rhythm to everything. The life cycleprovides a classic example: Conception is followed by gestation, birth, growth,maturity, death, and renewal. All things happen in cycles. Synchronicityinvolves appreciating that the cycles and seasons of life are coordinated withthe cycles and seasons of the cosmos. According to a Chinese expression, “Springflowers, summer breeze, autumn leaves, and winter snow: If you are totally tunedin, this is the best season of your life.” When you are grounded inlife-centered, present-moment awareness, you are in touch with your nonlocalself, which orchestrates the dance of the universe. When your rhythms are inharmony with the rhythms of the universe, synchrodestiny works its magic. The seventh insight states that every event has infinite causes that lead to aninfinity of effects. The so-called “cause/effect relationship” is not linear. Wehave explored this principle as “interdependent co-arising,” the phenomenon thatallows us to use synchrodestiny to see the patterns behind every event. The eighth insight posits that the creative energy of the universe is alsoreflected as sexual energy. All things that exist are born from this primalenergy. A child is born out of it. A flower blossoms through that energy, asdoes a fruit. Nothing in creation is exempt from this princiiple. In humanbeings this primal energy manifests as passion, excitement, and arousal. When weare in touch with our nonlocal self we spontaneously experience enthusiasm andinspiration. The word enthusiasm contains two roots: “en” and “theos.” Thismeans to be one with God, or the nonlocal self. (The word inspiration similarlymeans “to be one with spirit.”) Inspiration, enthusiasm, passion, and excitementgive energy to our intentions and thus accelerate the spontaneous fulfillment ofour desires. The ninth insight says that we can direct primal energy through the power ofattention and intention. As we’ve seen, whatever we put our attention on (andthereby make the focus of this energy) blossoms. Whatever we withdraw ourattention from starts to wither away. Attention and intention are the keys totransformation, whether it is of a situation, circumstance, person, or thing.The sutras in this book are codes for triggering and activating intention andattention. The tenth insight states that we can achieve harmony through those forces andelements in the cosmos that we call masculine and feminine. A hermeticphilosophy called “the principles of gender” proposes that true passion can onlyoccur if there’s a balance between the masculine and feminine forces in your ownbeing. Masculine energy drives qualities such as aggression, decisiveness,action, and courage, whereas feminine energy can be seen in an appreciation forbeauty, intuition, nurturing, affection, and tenderness. Great works of artalways contain the harmonious interaction of masculine and feminine, yin andyang. The sutra shiva shakti is meant to activate the harmonious interaction ofthe masculine and feminine archetypal energies of your nonlocal self. The eleventh insight posits that the inner nature of every being, no matter howevil it may seem to be, is love, and that this essential quality can always berevealed by unmasking our own love. Love, therefore, is not a mere sentiment; itis the ultimate truth at the heart of all creation. It is unconditional andunbounded, and it radiates from us when we are in touch with our nonlocal self. These eleven principles then are the principles of alchemy found in the work ofHermes Trismagistus, Vedanta, and indeed in all the perennial philosophies ofhumanity. Once we have absorbed these insights, then our own inner attitudes,our thoughts, our dreams, and our feelings in response to various situationsbecome much more expansive. For example, by becoming fully attuned to thecycles, the rhythms, and the seasons of life, we never get distressed orovershadowed by one particular situation.APPENDIX BThe following story, which derives from one of the greatest Vedantic texts, theChandogya Upanishad, beautifully describes the nature of the nonlocal self.Thousands of years ago the great sage Uddalaka Aruni sent his twelve-year-oldson, Svetaketu, to a great guru so that the boy could learn deeply about theultimate reality. For a dozen years Svetaketu studied under his master andmemorized all the Vedas. When Svetaketu returned home, his father noticed thathis son acted as though he had learned all there was to learn. So Uddalakadecided to pose the young man a question.“My learned son, what is that thing which cannot be heard but makes hearingpossible, which cannot be seen but makes seeing possible, which cannot be knownbut makes knowledge possible, which cannot be imagined but makes imaginationpossible?”Svetaketu was perplexed and silent.His father said, “When we know a single particle of clay, all objects of clayare known. When we know a single grain of gold, all objects of gold are known.The difference between one piece of golden jewelry and another is only in itsname and form. In reality all the jewelry is just gold, and all the pots arejust clay. Can you tell me, my son, what is that one thing which by knowing allcan be known?”Svetaketu replied, “Alas, my master did not give me this knowledge. Will you?”“Very well,” said Uddalaka. “Let me tell you.“The whole universe is one reality, and that reality is pure consciousness. Pureconsciousness is absolute existence. It is One that is not followed by a Second.In the beginning the One said to itself, ‘I shall differentiate into the many,and so become all the seers and all the scenery.’ The One entered into the many,and became the Self of each. The beings of all things are the One, and that Oneis the subtle essence of all that exists. You are that, Svetaketu.“In this same way bees make honey from the nectar of numerous flowers, but oncethe honey is made the nectar cannot say, ‘I am from this flower, or that.’ Sotoo, when you merge with your nonlocal Self you become one with the Self of allthat exists. This is the true Self of all, and Svetaketu, you are that.”The young man replied, “Enlighten me more, my father.”Uddalaka paused before speaking. “The river Ganges flows to the east. The riverIndus flows to the west. However, they both ultimately become the sea. Havingbecome the sea they no longer think ‘I am the Ganges’ or ‘I am the Indus.’ Sotoo, my son, everything that exists has its source in the nonlocal Self, andthat Self is the subtlest essence of all. It is the true Self. Svetaketu, youare that.“When the body withers and dies, the Self does not die. Fire cannot burn it,water cannot wet it, wind cannot dry it, weapons cannot shatter it. It isunborn, has no beginning or ending. It is beyond the boundaries of space andtime, pervading the entire universe. Svetaketu, you are that.”“Enlighten me more, father,” Svetaketu responded enthusiastically.Uddelaka said, “Bring me a fruit of the nyagrodha tree.”Svetaketu brought the fruit.“Break it open.”Svetaketu did so.“What do you see, my son?”“Tiny seeds, father.”“Break one now.”Svetaketu broke open the tiny seed.“What do you see, my son?”“I see that nothing is left, father.”“That which you do not see is the subtle essence, and the whole of the nyagrodhatree comes from it. So too the universe sprouts forth from the nonlocal Self.”Finally Uddelaka asks Svetaketu to place a cube of salt into a pail of water.The next day the sage asked his son to give him back the cube of salt.“I cannot give it back,” the young man responded. “It has dissolved.”Uddelaka asked his son to taste the surface of the water. “Tell me, how is it?”“It is salty, father.”“Taste it in the middle, and see how it is.”“It is salty, father.”“Taste it at the bottom, and tell me how it is.”“It is salty, father.”“Just like the salt is localized in the cube and dispersed in the water, so tooyour Self is simultaneously localized in your body and pervading the entireuniverse.“My dear son,” Uddelaka said. “You do not perceive the Self in your body, butwithout it perceptions would not be possible. You cannot conceptualize the Self,but without it conceptualization would not be possible. You cannot imagine theSelf, but without it imagination would not be possible. However, when you becomethe Self and live from the level of this nonlocal Self, you will be connected toall that exists, because the Self is the source of all that exists. Truth,reality, existence, consciousness, the absolute—call it what you will, it is theultimate reality, the ground of all being. And you are that, Svetaketu.“Live from this level, Svetaketu, and all your desires will come true becausefrom this level they will not just be your personal desires, they will bealigned with the desires of all that exists.”Svetaketu practiced all that he had learned and became one of the greatest seersof the Vedantic tradition."},{"pageContent":"ABOUT THE AUTHORDeepak Chopra’s books have become international best-sellers and classics oftheir kind.
