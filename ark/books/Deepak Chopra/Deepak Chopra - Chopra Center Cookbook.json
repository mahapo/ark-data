Observer and observed, knower and known, seer and scenery are different expressions of the same underlying spirit. The sci- ence of Ayurveda takes this insight to a very deep level in which body, mind, and soul are understood as interwoven domains along the continuum of consciousness. These differentiated aspects of consciousness—which is in its essence pure exis- tence, pure knowledge, and unbounded love—express them- selves as our physical body of matter, our subtle body of energy and transformation, and our causal body of information and intelligence. Wherever there is energy, there is information, intelligence, and transformation. Life evolves by regularly consuming and recreating itself. On our sun-drenched planet, the energy of our nearest star nurtures the lavish and extravagant growth of the ecosystem that supports the great chain of Being. Ultimately, we are all beings of light, the dust of stars circulating in the cosmos. Quantum physics tells us that at its essence all matter is trapped light. The same field of electromagnetic energy that creates thunder and lightning in the sky also generates the ideas that v Preface"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"emanate from the synaptic networks of our brains. Human lan- guage, emotions, and thoughts are as much an expression of the pattern of swirling energy of the universe as a rock, a tree, or a human body. In other words, even our thoughts are photons of light originally trapped by the plants that grow from the earth. All life nourishes itself through this light. Ayurveda holds that food is more than just protein, carbohy- drate, and fat. It is concentrated intelligent energy of the uni- verse. In fact, an ancient Vedic hymn boldly declares, “Food is Brahman,” that is, “Food is Consciousness.” When we nourish ourselves with food that is derived from the blissful marriage of Father Sun and Mother Earth, this food nurtures not only our bodies, but our minds and souls as well. The same intelligence that differentiates into seer and scenery, biological organisms and their environments, and messenger molecules and their receptors, differentiates into six types of taste receptors and the six codes of intelligence that are expressed as the flavors in food. No other biological science has this deep and profound understanding that our taste receptors are designed to access the intelligence of the universe so that we can nourish ourselves in body and soul. Subconsciously, we recognize the relationship between food and spirit, because our language uses taste metaphors to denote emotions. We are all familiar with expressions such as sweet love, sour grapes, salt of the earth, pungent remarks, bitter resen t- ment, and astringent humor. Ayurveda suggests that a little sweetness adds delight to life, whereas too much can be cloying. A touch of sour adds interest, but too much makes us grimace. A little salt provides endurance, but too much raises our blood pressure. Bitterness, pungency, and astringency add spice and complexity to life, but too much may cause us to feel irritable, resentful, and withdrawn. The flavors of life in the right pro- portion add richness to both our food and our experience. All this might be interesting philosophy were it not for the fascinating recent scientific discoveries that the most healing foods are those that contain potent concentrations of plant vi P REFACE"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"chemicals that are responsible for their flavor and color. The six tastes present in food are clues to these healing phytochemicals ( phyto is Greek for plant), which demonstrate that good food is good medicine. Although a popular myth suggests that food that is good for you cannot be pleasing to the senses, the fact is that healthy food was designed by nature over millions of years of evolutionary time to be pleasurable. With our modern emphasis on nutritionally empty, highly processed, and additive- rich foods, it is no wonder that we have epidemics of heart dis- ease, cancer, and degenerative disorders. It is time for us to remember that nature provides us with the nutrients we need to create meals that are delicious and nutritious. Over the years, thousands of people have come to the Chopra Center to heal themselves, to learn more about themselves, to improve their relationships, and to accelerate their spiritual evo- lution. Repeatedly they have told us that the meals they enjoy with us are among the most gratifying components of their experience. The food at the Chopra Center is designed to delight the senses, enliven vitality, and create joy for just being alive and having the opportunity to eat. As a result of the fre- quent requests of our guests we offer you the recipes of the Chopra Center for Well Being. We trust that you will experience for yourself how food can nurture not only your body, but also your soul.

J OSEPH C ONRAD Y ou become what you eat. This basic principle proclaims the straightforward yet profound fact that almost every molecule that currently resides in your body was derived from food you put into your mouth. From the chemical-rich blood that flows through your circulatory system to the jellylike mass of neurons that composes your brain to the rigid calcium- reinforced girders that make up your skeleton, your body is, in essence, food woven around your DNA. Did you have a piece of cantaloupe for breakfast this morn- ing? Within hours, carbohydrate molecules of the melon will be in your liver, waiting to supply you with energy when it is time"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"to shop for more fruit. The vitamin C in your cantaloupe will be a component of your antioxidant shield, protecting your lungs from carcinogens you inhale on the way to the market. Some of the beta-carotene contained in your breakfast fruit will be con- verted into vitamin A, shoring up the pigment cells in your retina so you can distinguish a ripe melon from one that has passed its prime. At its most fundamental level, food is energy and information. The energy component of food is quantified by the number of calories it carries. The informational component of food is char- acterized by its composition of vital nutrients. The proportion of protein, carbohydrates and fats, vitamins and minerals, and the specific natural chemicals that a food source provides all describe the informational aspect of food. Digestion is the process of metabolizing the energy and information of food into the energy and information of your body. When your diet provides the right constituents and your body is capable of extracting the energy and information you need, you create a healthy, vital body. Healthy Nutrition Should Be Easy Next to breathing, eating is the most natural process in the world, and we believe that it should be easy and enjoyable to follow a healthy diet. Nevertheless, we see people every day who are confused about what to eat. Why has nutrition become so complicated? Partly it is because of the amazing choices that are currently available. Never before have so many people had so many food options. We enjoy choosing from dozens of dif- ferent kinds of pasta, cereals, grains, and nuts. We appreciate the opportunity to sample fruits and vegetables from distant regions of the country and exotic places around the world. We welcome the access to unprecedented varieties of milk and dairy products, as well as other protein sources. And yet, with these expanded choices arise greater uncertainty. Is there a 2 T HE C HOPRA C ENTER C OOKBOOK"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"difference between frozen, canned, and fresh vegetables? Are whole grain products really better for you than refined and enriched pastas and breads? Should you be drinking nonfat, 2 percent, or whole milk? Are organic foods worth the additional cost? These are some of the questions we hear each day at the Chopra Center that reflect the sometimes overwhelming options available today. Our access to diverse sources of information has also gener- ated confusion. On a regular basis, new experts in nutrition offer their convincing arguments for an innovative dietary plan. One exhorts you to eat more protein and fewer carbohydrates, while another proclaims the opposite is best. One tells you to eat more animal products, another encourages you to become vegan. Recently an author has suggested that your blood type has a role to play in your nutritional choices. For every diet or nutritional plan that is aggressively promoted you can find a contradictory approach that is as vigorously advocated. It is not surprising that people are confused. Reestablish the Mind-Body Connection We believe that part of the problem underlying this confusion is a loss of connection between mind and body. People are so busy thinking about what to eat that they have lost the ability to hear what their body is asking for. This breakdown in commu- nication probably began in childhood when orders to “finish everything on your plate” were obeyed even when you may not have been hungry. Most of us were taught to eat when it was time to eat and eat as much as was on our plate. Considering how many children were encouraged to disregard the signals of their body, it does not surprise us that overeating and obesity are at epidemic levels. One consequence of the disconnection between body and mind is that many people view their appetites as the enemy. They fear that if left unchecked their hunger for food will I NTRODUCTION 3"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"compel them to eat vast quantities. This shows the extent to which we’ve lost mind-body integration, for a strong appetite is one of the most important signs of good health. When con- sciously listened to, it can tell you when and what to eat in order for you to remain vital and free from illness. People have as much emotional attachment to their diet as they do to their politics and religion. We define ourselves by what we eat, and this is not entirely inappropriate, for our body is made of food. We just don’t believe that healthy nutrition has to be so complicated. If you are straining to follow a diet that is supposed to be good for you, the stress probably outweighs the benefits. Eating is biological alchemy that transforms vegetables and grains into muscles and bones. Celebrate the Magic! Eat food that is good for you and you will enliven renewal in body and mind. The question is, what food is good for you? To answer this question we draw upon two primary sources: Ayurveda and modern nutritional science. Ayurveda (pro- nounced ah-your-vay-duh ), the most ancient healing system on earth, dates back to India five thousand years ago. The word Ayurveda has two Sanskrit roots: ayus, meaning life, and vid, meaning wisdom. Ayurveda, then, is a science of life wisdom, which can guide us in making the healthiest possible choices. We also draw upon the latest information from modern sci- ence, which illustrates that healthy food can nurture and renew us in body and soul. The Chopra Center Cookbook is about teaching you how to eat in healthy ways so that both your need for nutrition and your need for enjoyment are satisfied. The recipes are simple and delicious. They are nutritionally bal- anced and consistent with both modern nutritional science and the most ancient healing system on the planet.

We encourage you to choose to eat healthy, delicious foods so you can create a healthy, vital body. Pay attention to these seven simple precepts and your diet will help you create greater mental and physical well-being. 1. Eat a wide variety of foods during the day. 2. Listen to your body’s signals of hunger and satiety. 3. Use food to fill the emptiness in your stomach, not your heart. 4. If the meal isn’t delicious, it isn’t nourishing you. 5. Favor foods that are natural and vital. 6. Use herbs and spices liberally as both flavor and health enhancers. 7. Eat with awareness. Let’s explore each point in more detail. 1. Eat a wide variety of foods during the day. Most anthropolo- gists date the origin of modern human beings to about 150,000 to 200,000 years ago. Up until about 10,000 years ago, we spent most of our days hunting and gathering food. During the course of a day, we sampled dozens if not hundreds of food sources. In addition to any animal protein we could snare, we ate a diverse range of roots, leaves, fruits, nuts, berries, beans, mushrooms, and seeds. Some primates in the wild today have been observed to nibble on more than two hundred different kinds of plants each day. The average Western diet is much more limited in variety, and as a result we miss out on the extensive natural pharmacy that is available. Unfortunately, burgers, fries, and a diet Coke do not allow us to take advantage of the nourishing properties that a delicious, widely varied diet offers. Each day, nutritional scien- tists are discovering new health-promoting chemicals that are available to us through food. Think variety when it comes to your diet, and be sure to include the six tastes described later in this chapter. 6 T HE C HOPRA C ENTER C OOKBOOK"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"2. Listen to your body’s signals of hunger and satiety. Jonathan Swift once said, “My stomach serves me instead of a clock.” Your appetite is your ally. Listen to it. You probably don’t go to the gas station when your fuel tank is half full. Don’t sit down at the meal table if your stomach is half full. Consider your appetite as a fuel gauge from 0 (completely empty) to 10 (stuffed). Do not eat until you are at a level 2 (very hungry) or 3 (definitely hungry). Eat until you reach a level 7 (satisfied). Do not go beyond this to a level 8 (rather full), 9 (uncomfortably full), or 10 (stuffed). Once you have reached your satisfaction level of 7, wait until you are back down to a level 2 or 3 before you eat again. 10 stuffed 9 uncomfortably full 8 rather full 7 satisfied 6 almost satisfied 5 no hunger awareness 4 could eat 3 definitely hungry 2 very hungry 1 hunger pains 0 completely empty 3. Use food to fill the emptiness in your stomach, not your heart. We learn to associate comfort with food at an early age. When you were upset as an infant, the chances are your mother offered you a bottle or her breast to calm you. As adults we sometimes seek food for its soothing, rather than nutritional, properties. If you do this on a regular basis, you are almost certainly not listening to your appetite. This often results in poor digestion, disturbed sleep, and weight gain. Use food to feed your body. Develop conscious communication skills to fill your heart. 4. If the meal isn’t delicious, it isn’t nourishing you. Enjoy your meals.

If you are struggling with a diet that you believe is good for you, but do not find at all appetizing, it will not ultimately be nourishing and you will not be able to stay with it for long. In this book we will convince you that you do not have to sacrifice delicious meals for good health. 5. Favor foods that are natural and vital. According to most tra- ditional health systems, food carries a vital force in addition to carbohydrates, proteins, fats, fiber, vitamins, and minerals. This life force is known as prana in Ayurveda and chi in Traditional Chinese medicine. Freshly picked green beans from your garden are abundant in prana; beans that have been sitting in your pantry for six months are lacking in prana. To the extent possi- ble, favor fruits and vegetables that are locally grown, freshly harvested, and prepared as soon as possible after picking. Not only are they more delicious, but you are sending your body the message that it is receiving the highest quality health-promoting nutrients. The longer that a food has been sitting on a shelf since its har- vesting, the more likely it is to be affected by oxidation. Free radicals initiate the decomposition of a fruit or vegetable imme- diately after it is disconnected from its source. A sliced apple or banana that has been sitting around for an hour begins turning brown because free radical molecules floating in the air deplete it of its natural antioxidants. Rancid food is this process taken to the extreme. We therefore encourage you to favor fresh foods as much as possible and to the extent that is practical reduce your intake of frozen foods, leftovers, highly processed, microwaved, and canned foods. Reduce Favor Frozen Recently harvested, when possible Leftover Freshly prepared Highly processed All natural ingredients Microwavable Conventionally prepared Canned Fresh, when possible 8 T HE C HOPRA C ENTER C OOKBOOK"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"As more information becomes available on the harmful effects of pesticides on our personal and environmental health, we encourage you to favor organic fruits, vegetables, and dairy prod- ucts as much as you can. Reduce your consumption of processed and highly refined foods. Favor fresh as opposed to canned or frozen, recognizing that there are some foods, such as garbanzo beans, tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, salsas, and condiments that are just too difficult to regularly prepare fresh. Whenever you can, avoid leftovers or reheated foods. We are not encouraging you to become overly zealous about this point. Simply have the intention to eat foods that are as freshly prepared as possible. 6. Use herbs and spices liberally as both flavor and health enhancers. We encourage you to take advantage of nature’s edi- ble gifts to make your meals delicious and nutritious. Become familiar with the culinary and health-promoting effects of herbs and spices and use them generously. Even the simplest quickly prepared meal can be transformed into a culinary delight through the appropriate use of seasonings. We will share with you what we consider the essential ingredients to create the nutritional alchemy that will bring pleasure to your senses and well-being to your body. 7. Eat with awareness. A principle of Ayurveda is: How you eat is as important as what you eat. If you gobble down your meal while driving or watching television, it will not be as nourishing or life supporting as when you eat with awareness. Savor your food through all five senses. Try to minimize the chaos in your environment while you are eating. Even if you only have fifteen minutes for lunch, hold the phone calls and allow yourself to appreciate the miracle of food. Occasionally eat a meal alone and notice the sounds, sensa- tions, sights, tastes, and smells that are available to you. If you are following the previous principles, your meal will not only be sumptuous to the taste, but will also look and smell delicious. A healthy meal nourishes all the senses, and when you pay atten- tion to all five senses, your food will be more nourishing. T HE W ISDOM OF F OOD 9"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"The Six Tastes A simple and practical approach to ensuring healthy nutritional variety is to pay attention to the tastes of your food. According to Ayurveda, everything edible can be classified according to one or more of six basic tastes: sweet, sour, salty, pungent, bitter, and astringent. If you sample foods that correspond to each of these tastes throughout the day, your meals will provide a wide assortment of health-promoting nutrients. Let’s look at these six tastes one by one. Sweet. Sweet is the taste of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Foods that carry the sweet taste increase your body bulk. Breads, grains, nuts, pasta, most fruits, starchy vegetables, dairy, oils, and all animal products are considered sweet. Sweet foods supply the majority of what we consume in a day. In every category of taste, there are foods that are highly nutritious and others that should be eaten more sparingly. Favor fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, cereals, breads, and nuts. In addition to supplying your energy needs, they are good sources of fiber. If you are not ready to go vegetarian, reduce your intake of red meats, favoring cold-water fish and egg whites. Minimize your intake of highly refined sugar and wheat products. Favor low-fat dairy, polyunsaturated and monounsat- urated oils while minimizing cholesterol-rich products and foods containing partially hydrogenated oils. Sour. Any food that is mildly acidic is experienced as sour. Citric acid, lactic acid, ascorbic acid, and butyric acid are just a few of the acidic chemicals that contribute to the sour taste of foods. As with the sweet taste, there are sour foods that are more nutritious than others. Favor oranges, grapefruits, strawberries, blueberries, rasp- berries, and tomatoes while reducing your intake of pickled foods, green olives, alcohol, and vinegar. Small helpings of low- fat yogurt and buttermilk can aid in digestion. Although aged sour cheeses can be delicious, use them judiciously, as they are usually high in cholesterol and difficult to digest. 10 T HE C HOPRA C ENTER C OOKBOOK"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Salty. Salt is the flavor of ion-producing minerals on the tongue. The principal salt of our diet is sodium chloride, which comes from mines or naturally salty bodies of water. The salty taste is also carried in soy sauce and many other sauces, sea- weed, fish, and salted meats. In the right dose, salt adds flavor and stimulates digestion. Too much salt can contribute to high blood pressure and fluid retention. Pungent. We often use the term “hot” to describe the pun- gent flavor. The spiciness of pepper, ginger, and other pungent sources comes from essential oils that interact with chemical receptors on the tongue. Most pungent foods contain natural antioxidants and infection-fighting chemicals. Due in part to their antispoiling properties, pungent spices have been highly prized for millennia. A shortcut to the land of spices was a major incentive for the fifteenth-century journey of Columbus. Pungent flavors stimulate digestion and help mobilize stagnant secretions. Recent studies have suggested components of garlic and onions, also pungent foods, may help lower cholesterol lev- els and blood pressure. Commonly available pungent foods include: chili peppers, cayenne, black pepper, fresh and dry ginger, horseradish, onions, garlic, leeks, mustard, cloves, cinnamon, peppermint, thyme, cumin, cardamom, basil, oregano, and rosemary. Adding spices and herbs to your life will serve both your palate and your health. Bitter. Bitter is the taste of most green and yellow vegetables. Some green leafy vegetables such as endive and kale are partic- ularly bitter. The bitterness is due to natural plant chemicals known as phytochemicals, which have detoxifying, disease- preventing, and healing properties that improve our chances for long, healthy lives. Broccoli and cauliflower, for example, are rich in the phytochemicals known as isothiocyanates, which have been shown to help fight cancer and heart disease. Aspara- gus, green peppers, and cabbage are rich in flavonoids, which help resist genetic injury, fight infections, and may even reduce your risk for memory loss. The bottom line: Eat your vegeta- bles—they are good for you. T HE W ISDOM OF F OOD 11"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Astringent. The last of the six tastes is more of an effect than any actual flavor. Astringent foods have a drying, compacting, and puckering influence on your body. Beans, legumes, and peas are considered to fall within the astringent category, and provide excellent sources of vegetable protein, complex carbo- hydrates, and fiber to your diet. Several fruits are astringent, such as cranberries, pomegranates, persimmons, and tart apples. Green tea is also astringent and has been found to be a rich source of natural cancer-preventing chemicals. Astringent foods are an essential component of any diet that promotes renewal. Weight Loss and Wellness Many people struggling to shed unwanted pounds seek quick and effortless solutions, often bouncing from one weight loss diet to another. Unfortunately, quick fix diets seldom produce lasting benefits and may not be nutritionally balanced. At the Chopra Center for Well Being, we believe that attaining and maintaining an ideal weight is most easily achieved by following a consciousness-based approach. The principles outlined earlier, combined with a regular fitness program, will enable you to lose about one pound per week until you reach your optimal weight. Honoring your appetite and eating with awareness will reawaken a healthy connection between your mind and body. When listened to, your body will tell you when it is hungry and when it is satisfied. Pay attention to the messages it is sending— it is trying to tell you what it needs to be healthy and fit. Ensure that all six tastes are available at every meal and you will satisfy the cravings that can sabotage your efforts to lose weight. Please avoid crash diets. Although you may see quick results, study after study has demonstrated that the benefits cannot be sustained. Start a nutritional and lifestyle program today that will serve you throughout your entire life. Do not try to lose weight through diet alone.

The Chopra Center 30-Day Nutritional Plan will support you in achieving this goal. Wine and Well-Being: A Word on Alcohol The fermentation of fruits and grains into alcoholic beverages dates to antiquity. Egyptian references to an intoxicating bever- age derived from fruits stored in warm places can be identified over four thousand years ago. Around 1500 B . C ., Middle East- erners created the first malt beverage from fermented grains. Wine, beer, and distilled alcoholic drinks have long played a role in cultures around the world, offering the potential for both pleasure and suffering. Although overindulgence in alcohol- containing beverages can contribute to emotional and physical distress, an occasional offering to Dionysus, the god of grapes and ecstasy, can be part of a healthy lifestyle. Studies have shown that there are natural health-promoting chemicals in wine that may have a protective effect against heart disease and cancer. These natural disease-fighting substances, which have been shown to have potent antioxidant properties, go by such names as polyphenols, flavonoids, and resveratrol. These compounds are most concentrated in the skins of grapes. Because the production of red (but not white) wine involves prolonged contact of the juice with the grape skins, red wine has the highest concentration of these health-enhancing chemicals. If you are so inclined, enjoy an occasional glass of wine as part of a delicious meal in the company of friends and loved ones. From a taste perspective, wine contains predominantly sour and astringent flavors, with traces of bitter and sweet; therefore, T HE W ISDOM OF F OOD 13"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"it can complement and contribute to a balanced meal. This is not the case for distilled alcohol. With over 40 percent of North Americans affected by a fam- ily member with alcoholism, it is important to remember that alcohol has potentially adverse effects on almost every system and cell in the body and can contribute to serious illnesses affecting the nervous system, liver, and digestive tract. It is also a source of essentially empty calories with each gram of alcohol contributing about 7 calories—almost as much as a gram of fat, which has 9. A pint of beer or eight ounces of wine carry about 200 calories, while an ounce of distilled liquor has about 80 calories; therefore, alcohol is not a useful component of a weight-loss program. Our bottom line is to consider an occa- sional glass of wine as another source of flavors and phyto- chemicals that can be part of a healthy nutritional program. 14 T HE C HOPRA C ENTER C OOKBOOK"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"15 The Art of Cooking, The Art of Eating One cannot think well, love well, sleep well, if one has not dined well.

Ask yourself, “Am I being nourished by all my senses when I sit down to eat?” If you are eating while watching television, on the run, in your car, or in front of your computer, the chances are you can improve your sensory nourishment. Make a com- mitment to get back in touch with the delights of dining, and you will see benefits in your health, your vitality, and your relationships. Preparing and eating delicious food can be an art form. It provides a daily opportunity to express your creativity. Have the intention to be more conscious as you plan your meals, shop for ingredients, cook your dishes, and finally enjoy the delicious product of your efforts. Your body, mind, and soul will relish the experience.

Pay attention to colors, sounds, and textures that enliven your senses. Consider eating in your formal dining room on a regular basis, rather than saving it only for those rare holiday dinners. Use your special dishes occasionally for a family meal, savoring the sumptuousness of food served on beautiful plates. Light candles and play beautiful music during your meals. Make a pact with your family to engage only in lighthearted conversa- tions while eating, saving the heavy discussions for later. Even when you are eating alone, make your dining experi- ence special. You can be your own delightful dining companion. Become an artist in the kitchen. Begin by renewing your rela- tionship with Mother Earth. Take a walk outside and connect with the energy around you. Appreciate the beauty of the plants, flowers, land, and natural bodies of water that compose your environment. The energy of the earth becomes the energy of your body through your intake of fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Favor foods that are in season, and to the extent possible, locally grown. Artists thrive on inspiration. Develop a collection of inspiring cookbooks. Arrange your kitchen to be beautiful, alive, and inviting. Plant an herb garden in your home or apartment—you can create an amazing botanical bounty in pots. Take a walk through your local food store and pay attention to the vibrant colors, fragrances, and textures of the fruits and vegetables available to you. Appreciate the luscious red peppers, yellow squashes, and white mushrooms. Savor the aroma of ripe straw- berries and fresh asparagus. Enjoy the cobbled texture of corn on the cob, the smoothness of tomatoes, the velvety softness of peaches. Listen to the sounds of the people moving about you. Feel their energy and excitement. If you feel intimidated by the food market because you have not previously considered yourself an inspired cook or chef, try this simple experiment: Go into your grocery store and select one item from the produce department.

Mainstream food markets are beginning to carry more natural and organic foods. As increas- ing numbers of people purchase natural and organic items, the market for these products will grow and they will become more widely available. If you live in an area where a natural food store is not available, encourage your local grocery store man- ager to stock food products that are healthy and organic. Give the manager a list of a few items that you will buy, and then buy them as they become available. Stock up on essential items for the pantry, but also plan on purchasing food on a regular basis to have the freshest possible foods on hand. If you live in an area where a particular food sta- ple is not readily accessible, you’ll need to plan ahead. Try not to keep food items too long. The Ayurvedic approach to health val- ues freshness and encourages limiting canned, packaged, or frozen foods. If you are eating meat, poultry, or fish, use fresh, not frozen products whenever possible. Remember—fresh is best! Herbs and Spices Purchase your spices in small quantities. Buy what you will use.

As part of a nutritional program diet, we recommend five to nine serv- ings of fresh fruits and vegetables each day. This is easily accom- plished by favoring a mostly vegetarian diet (see next page). There are many different varieties of organic grain products.

Culture, upbringing, personal health issues, envi- ronmental concerns, as well as religious and spiritual beliefs all contribute to a person’s dietary preferences. Our basic recom- mendation is to eat with awareness and follow your heart. While the Ayurvedic approach to diet does not require strict adher- ence to a vegetarian diet, we encourage vegetarianism as the optimal nutritional plan for health and vitality. There is abun- dant scientific evidence that a vegetarian or mostly vegetarian diet plays an important role in reducing your risks for heart dis- ease and cancer. For health, environmental, and ethical reasons, reducing your intake of animal products makes sense. We recognize that if you are accustomed to eating meat on a daily basis, you will not be inclined to stop abruptly. We suggest you initially try substituting one or two vegetarian meals a week and see how you feel. If you consume animal products, choose those that are raised as humanely as possible and are free from hormones and antibiotics. Also, consider changing the way you consume meat. Rather than devouring a large piece of meat along with a few vegetables, try eating a small helping with a larger quantity of vegetables. Favor fish and free-range fowl while reducing your intake of red meat. Although most of the recipes in this book are vegetarian, if you choose, you can add small portions of chicken or fish to many of the dishes. Always try to eat with awareness, gratitude, respect, and delight. These are the most important qualities to awaken renewal of the body and soul.

If you follow the program as outlined, you will attain your desired weight while consuming a diet that reduces your risks for heart disease and cancer. Over the course of a month, the Chopra Center Nutritional Plan will provide the fol- lowing nutritional components: Total fat less than 22% of total calories Saturated fat less than 7% of total calories Protein between 15 and 20% of total calories Although some proponents of a heart healthy diet have sug- gested lower intakes of total fat, the Chopra Center 30-Day Nutritional Plan is low in saturated fat and cholesterol and is much more palatable than more restrictive diets. It is also high in protein and fiber. 26 The Chopra Center 30-Day Nutritional Plan for Renewal"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"This nutritional plan provides a guideline for planning your weekly meals. We have included information on total calories, fat, and protein per meal and per day to help you more con- sciously choose the quality and quantity of the foods you eat. Depending on your needs—building muscle, losing weight, or maintaining your current body size—you will be able to mix and match each menu to create a nutritious and well-balanced diet. Most of the recipes are for four servings. If you are cooking for one or two people, cut the recipe in half. Decrease the amount of black pepper and red chili flakes when dividing a recipe. You can always add more spice to a dish. As you balance your eating habits and daily routine, you will likely find your food cravings will decrease. Use your eating awareness tech- niques to help gauge the amount of food you prepare for a meal. Refer to the Appetite Gauge on page 7. Ask yourself, “How hungry am I?” Prepare the quantity of food that reflects the hunger you are feeling. Healthy desserts bring joy and delight. Get into the habit of eating small portions of dessert to satisfy your cravings for sweets without over-indulging. The Ayurvedic approach to eat- ing is about nurturing and honoring the signals your body sends to you. Depriving yourself of the basic foods you love may cause more harm than the few extra calories you may consume. Be moderate and balanced in your eating habits. Thinking ahead a few days can be helpful. If you want to make Rosemary White Bean Soup, for example, soak the beans overnight the night before and cook them slowly in a slow cooker while you are at work, then finish the soup when you get home.

We also feel more satisfied after we eat a meal where the six tastes are present. As you become more aware of the six tastes in your daily meals, you will find that you can easily round out a meal by, for example, adding a squeeze of lemon to enhance the sour taste or by adding some sautéed spinach to a meal to complete the bitter taste. Learning to make the Staple Recipes will increase the variety of food choices and enable you to add additional “tastes” in your daily meals. By doing so, you will be able to incorporate the recommended five to nine servings of fruits and vegetables and the six tastes into your diet.

Ordinary butter contains about 80 per- cent butterfat, 15 percent water, 3 percent salt, and 1 to 2 per- cent milk solids or curds. During the process of making ghee, water is boiled off and the curds are cooked into a sediment that is easily removed. The result is a fragrant, flavorful oil that does not become rancid, even without refrigeration. In the tradition of Ayurveda, ghee is prized for its unique medicinal and bal- ancing qualities. Even those with sensitivity to dairy products can usually enjoy ghee, as it is free of milk proteins and sugars. Ghee plays an important role in Indian and Ayurvedic cuisine, lending a subtle taste and fragrance to the food. It is heat tol- erant, making it useful for quick sautéing and browning. A teaspoon of ghee contains 5 grams of fat, of which 3 are sat- urated, and a little more than 8 milligrams of cholesterol. Because it is so flavorful, you can usually use less ghee than an equivalent amount of another oil. If you are concerned about high choles- terol and prefer to avoid any unnecessary saturated fat and cho- lesterol, feel free to substitute olive oil for ghee in any recipe. You will need the following to make 1 1 ⁄ 2 cups of ghee: 3- or 4-quart heavy-bottomed stainless steel pot 4-inch wire mesh strainer lined with terry cloth or a flour-sack dish towel heat-resistant bowl or pot to strain hot ghee into clear glass container with tight-fitting lid 1 pound of organic unsalted butter Place the butter in the pot. Bring the butter to a boil, and then reduce the heat to produce a slow, steady, rolling boil. Keep an eye on the butter to avoid burning it. Allow the foam 38 T HE C HOPRA C ENTER C OOKBOOK"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"that forms to settle to the bottom of the pot. As the foam is reduced, it produces a crackling sound, which is caused by moisture evaporating from the butter. Let the butter simmer for up to 30 minutes. Keep the heat on your stove as low as possi- ble. The ghee is complete when you see browned butterfat caramelized on the bottom of the pan, while the top portion of the ghee is mostly clear. Allow the mixture to cool slightly, then strain it through a cloth-lined strainer or a flour-sack dish towel into a heat-resistant container. Allow the ghee to cool com- pletely before storing it in a clear glass jar. You can keep the ghee for up to one month without the need for refrigeration. You can also make ghee in an electric slow cooker without the risk of burning it. Place the butter in the cooker on the low- est possible setting. It usually requires about 6 hours for the solids and moisture to completely cook out, leaving the pure golden ghee. Ghee is delicious drizzled on toast, oatmeal, or rice; it adds flavor and character to any sautés for soups, sauces, and stews. A teaspoon of ghee each day in your cooking supplies 7.5 per- cent of your recommended daily fat, 15 percent of your satu- rated fat, and 3 percent of your daily cholesterol intake. If your diet is otherwise low in saturated fat and cholesterol, ghee will make a minor contribution. If you wish to avoid completely the saturated fat and choles- terol of ghee, we recommend olive oil as a useful and tasty alter- native. Olive oil is rich in oleic acid, a monounsaturated fatty acid. Diets rich in olive oil may help reduce cholesterol levels, lower high blood pressure, and reduce the risk for colon cancer. Always use “extra virgin” olive oil, which meets the highest stan- dards for purity. Most of the recipes in this book call for ghee or olive oil, which can be used interchangeably except for baking sweet recipes, for which canola oil is preferable to olive oil. Unless specific amounts are given in a recipe, when using ghee or olive oil to coat a pan, please use as little as possible, only adding more to avoid burning your food.

Ginger tea has a strong cleansing effect on the body, helping to mobilize toxins and restore bal- ance.

Ginger helps soothe and cleanse the respiratory tract, making it a valuable tea during cold and flu season. We recommend that you drink two to three cups of hot ginger tea a day. Make it a habit. For variety, try sweetening your tea with raw organic honey or adding chopped mint or lemon slices. One Quart of Ginger Tea Coarsely chop an unpeeled 2-inch piece of whole ginger. Place the pieces into a 2- or 3-quart pot with one quart of purified water. Bring the water just to a boil and reduce the heat to a sim- mer. Let the tea simmer for 15 minutes.

Your homemade vegetable stock will be fresh and salt-free and will add valuable nutrients to your diet. Buy a large flat plastic container that fits in your refrigera- tor and begin collecting the outer layers of vegetables that you would normally toss into the trash. These “scraps” will make a delicious stock for your soups, sauces, and sautés. Every time you prepare vegetables for a dish, save the peeling, cores, ends, tops, outer leaves, stems, and anything else that is not actually eaten. Save the ends and peels from the following vegetables: broccoli, carrots, cauliflower, leeks (use onion skin sparingly). Save apple cores, lemon and orange peels, and any green ends such as lettuce or unappealing cooking greens. Just about any type of fruit, herb, or vegetable scraps can go into a stockpot. Avoid large amounts of green or red cabbage, beets, beet greens, and banana peels, however, as they will all cause the stock to be cloudy or discolored. Save your usable scraps in a plastic container for up to five days in the refrigerator. When you have a good supply, place all of the scraps into a large stockpot. Cover with water to 2 inches above the scraps. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 1 hour or more. Cool the liquid, then strain it and pour into recycled glass or plastic juice containers. Label the tops of the containters with a bold “STOCK” sign. Store them in the refrigerator. If you are an avid gardener, the vegetable scraps will be very wel- come in your compost pile. Use the stock in place of extra oil for a low-fat cooking process.

Common fruits to sauté include apples, apricots, bananas, berries, peaches, pears, and strawberries. Wash the fruit, and cut into slices or bite-size pieces. You may want to peel the fruit first, especially if the skin looks less than desirable. If it is not too bad, leave the skin on, as it provides important dietary fiber. Sautéed fruits are easy to digest and make a great complement to any meal. Including fruit chutney or sautéed fruit in a meal is one way to ensure that you are incorporating the six tastes.

In every culture, tradition, religion, and cuisine, bread has always captured the human heart and soul with aroma, taste, texture, romance, and intrigue—always chal- lenging our resistance to indulge in more. Why do we love homemade bread so? Someone—our mother, wife, lover, or friend—has put much love and attention into the bread: carefully and gently combining the yeast and the sugar with not too hot nor too cool water; mixing the stone-ground wheat, fresh herbs, salt, oil, all combined in a large earthen bowl, then kneading with the energy that comes only from within. With every stroke of attention creating soft and flexible dough to sculpt into a vision of perfection—a loaf of bread, a batch of sweet cinnamon rolls, an abundant pizza, pita bread for a dip, a pastry filled with savory delight. Baking is a gift. You don’t need to be gifted to bake; baking is a gift to be shared. As part of a healthy balanced diet, freshly baked breads, muffins, cookies, cakes, fresh pastas, and freshly cooked whole grains bring sweetness into our lives, adding comfort and pleasure.

Over the past thirty years, the taste, texture, and quality of soy-based products has greatly improved. Some of the soy products available in markets today include: soy cheese, soymilk, soy burgers, tofu ice cream, tofu breakfast sausage, ground “meat,” soy cold cuts and tofu hot dogs. Soybeans are an important source of phytoestrogens. Phytoestro- gens are naturally occurring plant-based substances that contain chem- icals related to the hormones produced by mammals. One type of phytoestrogen, isoflavones, has been credited with many health- promoting benefits. Including soy products in your diet may help reduce the risk of osteoporosis and some of the uncomfortable symp- toms of menopause. Studies have shown that the daily use of soy prod- ucts may also help lower cholesterol levels and protect against certain types of cancer. Soybeans are rich in protein, iron, B vitamins, and zinc. Soy products also provide a good source of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. We recommend the regular use of soy products in a well- balanced diet. Soy Products Tempeh is a type of fermented soybean cake that is originally from Indonesia. Tempeh is made from the whole soybean and is high in protein. Like tofu, tempeh can be marinated to enhance the flavor. Use tempeh as a ground meat replacement in chili, Italian sauces, savory casseroles, and Mexican dishes. Tofu is composed of fermented soybeans made into a concentrated cheeselike form. It is originally from Japan. Tofu is astringent, sweet, cooling, heavy, and mild tasting. Tofu is very versatile and will take on the flavors of any food with which it is cooked. It is high in calcium, iron, and phosphorus. Tofu is easy to digest and is well suited to com- bine with flavorful warming spices. There are two types of tofu: fresh tofu, packaged in water, and silken tofu, which is best used in sauces. We generally recommend using firm or extra-firm low-fat tofu."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Soymilk is the liquid that comes from soybeans that are cooked and pressed. Soymilk is naturally high in calcium and contains no choles- terol. Soymilk comes in full-fat, low-fat, and nonfat varieties. You can find it flavored with vanilla, cocoa, carob, or just plain. Soymilk can be used to replace milk in many recipes. We recommend the use of low-fat soymilk products. Textured vegetable protein (TVP) is made from defatted soy flakes. It is a dried, granular product, often sold in bulk at natural food stores. TVP needs to be reconstituted in liquid to become soft and flavorful. Marinades work well with TVP. Use in recipes as a ground meat sub- stitute. Fresh soybeans (edamame), high in protein and phytoestrogens, look much like Chinese snow peas. They are best eaten steamed. Steam the pods for 20 minutes. They can be found in most food stores and Asian markets, either fresh or frozen.

Vegetables play a predominant role in a healthy, well-balanced diet. If you really try to include 5 to 9 servings of fruits and vegetables each day into your diet, you will need to eat a variety of them. How can you cook vegetables so you and your family (even the kids) will really like them and want to eat them? Be creative; mix colors and flavors that appeal to you. Our favorite combinations include: car- rots and broccoli, cauliflower and greens, eggplant and sweet potatoes, and zucchini and tomatoes. There are many different ways to cook veg- etables; for example, roasting, sautéing, steaming, braising, and blanch- ing. You can also include vegetables in many soups, stews, sauces, and casseroles. In the Ayurvedic approach to eating, we recommend that most veg- etables and fruits be lightly cooked or steamed to aid in digestibility. This does not mean that you should avoid fresh salads made with beau- tiful organic cucumbers, tomatoes, shredded carrots, sprouts, and organic field greens. For ease in digestion, we recommend that cold foods, such as a salad, always be eaten before a soup or hot main dish. People with delicate digestive systems should mostly eat slightly cooked or steamed vegetables for ease of digestion and comfort. A wonderful way to add greens to your meal is to place a handful of salad greens— such as field greens, spinach, watercress, or arugula—on the plate, then add hot, steaming grains or vegetables on top to lightly steam the greens. It also makes the plate look beautiful. Preparing Vegetables Plan on 1 to 1 1 ⁄ 2 cups of different vegetables per person at each meal. For cooking greens, use 2 cups per person, as greens reduce in volume during the cooking process. Start with your favorite vegetables. Peeling vegetables is not necessary if you are using organic vegetables. The skins of most vegetables have abundant vital nutrients and fiber so it is best to keep them on whenever possible. Wash all fruits and vegetables, organic or nonorganic, before you use them. (Remember to keep all the"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"washed ends and scraps for your stockpot.) Most varieties of squash are peeled, unless you are using the squash as a boat. Use lots of fresh and dried herbs with your vegetables. Not only will the vegetables taste better, you will benefit from the medicinal qualities found in them. As mentioned in the Condiments and Baking Supplies in the Basics of Nourishment (page 23), we also recommend the use of a product called Bragg Liquid Aminos, found in most health food stores. It is a nonfermented soy-based product that provides a savory and salty taste similar to soy sauce. Use it to flavor vegetables. Vegetables should always be cooked al dente, or almost tender. Cook them a little longer for those with delicate digestive systems. Begin your sauté or steaming process with the vegetables that will take the longer time to cook. For example: cauliflower, asparagus, carrots, pota- toes, squash, and other hard vegetables will take 5 to 6 minutes to cook to a tender stage, whereas zucchini, broccoli, and green beans will take only 3 to 4 minutes.

Rinse and drain the grains in a wire mesh strainer before cooking and be on the lookout for small rocks or twigs. Cooking on the Stovetop Bring the water and grains to a boil, according to the cooking direc- tions. Reduce the heat to the lowest possible temperature. Most grains cook best when left alone. Don’t be tempted to raise the lid and look inside. If your temperature is as low as possible and the appropriate amount of water is used, the grains will cook to a perfect consistency if you resist looking inside.

Eating lighter at night is particularly beneficial if you are trying to drop a few pounds. You will also tend to sleep better if you have eaten a lighter evening meal. The main meals are best enjoyed during the midday period. Your digestion is at its peak, and since you are more active dur- ing the day, your fuel requirements are higher.

Try gradually eating more at lunchtime and less at dinner and notice how you feel. You and your family can still spend quality time together in the evening—you just don’t need to eat as much. Helpful Pointers • Almost all of the recipes can be prepared for 1 or 2 people by dividing the ingredients in half or in quarters. Experiment with your favorites. • If you are cooking for one, a trip to the salad bar may yield just the right vegetable combination of broccoli, cauliflower, bell peppers, carrots, and celery for a soup, stir-fry, or stew. Look for the freshest produce you can find. • Use low-fat fresh tofu that is firm or extra firm for the best cooking results. •K eep some marinated tofu on hand to speed up the process of making a quick stir-fry or sandwich. It also makes a protein-rich snack. • Keep a cup of vegetable stock nearby whenever you are cooking. If you are tempted to add additional oil or fat to a dish to add moisture, try adding some vegetable stock instead. This will help to reduce extra fat in the diet. We have used only 1 teaspoon of oil in most of our dishes serving four. You can increase or decrease as desired. • For added variety, you can add chicken or fish to some of the entrées. • In the entrée recipes, we have used a standard 16-ounce package of tofu or tempeh. Package sizes will vary according to brand. Use the amount of either tofu or tempeh that is available. It does not need to be an exact amount. • When planning a menu for a meal, a day, or a week, think about what you may be doing. Will you need some extra food to take for lunch the next day? Will you need to have a very quick, eat-on-the-run dinner before a meeting? 108 T HE C HOPRA C ENTER C OOKBOOK"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Thinking ahead will give you time to prepare foods that will be better for you and more nourishing, and you will be able to resist the temptation to run through a fast-food place or pick up food that may not be very nourishing.

The second most important item is the soup pot or kettle. You should have a good stainless steel pot—18 to 20 gauge steel—from 6 to 9 quarts in size, and a good long spoon to go with it.

Be sure to have tight-fitting lids for your pots."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"Helpful Pointers • Be creative. Make simple soups by trying different vegetables and mixing and matching herbs and spices. A general rule about spices: you can always add more. Start simple, and then go from there. • Use Bragg Liquid Aminos or tamari to help create a rich savory flavor. Use a good stock, some aminos, leeks or onions, spices, and a dash of pepper to make just about any vegetable taste great in a soup. • Soup makes the perfect light supper after a long day. Learn to make several simple soups in 20 minutes time. See Staple Recipes for examples and ideas about simple soups. • One of the most useful tools for blending soups is a hand blender, which makes blending soups and cleaning up easy. • Using a slow cooker is also an easy and carefree way to make soup. If you are adding dried beans, for the best results soak all dried hard beans overnight in water to make them easier to digest. Drain the beans and place them into the slow cooker. Add vegetable stock or water to cover the beans up to 2 to 3 inches above the level of the beans. The uncooked beans will absorb a lot of liquid as they cook. To enhance the flavor, briefly sauté some vegetables—such as leeks, celery, and carrots—with the spices before adding them to the cooker. Combine all the ingredients in the cooker and place the setting on low. Cook for 4 to 6 hours, or until the beans and vegetables are tender. Keep in mind that a soup with vegetables only, without meat or beans, will take only 2 to 4 hours to cook in a slow cooker. With that in mind, don’t leave a vegetable soup to cook for 8 hours while you are at work for the day. • Time saver: Pre-cook dried beans in the slow cooker the day before or during the day. Keep canned or jarred beans on hand to speed up the cooking process. 144 T HE C HOPRA C ENTER C OOKBOOK"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"Soup Recipes Asian Clear Broth* Cuban Black Bean and Sweet Potato Soup* Italian Vegetable Soup Butternut Squash Soup Nutty Broccoli Soup Rosemary White Bean Soup Spinach and Lentil Soup Potato Leek Soup Spinach Soup Summertime Tomato Basil Soup Sweet Potato Ginger Soup Tomato Florentine Soup Tortilla Soup with Avocado and Cilantro* Vegetable Barley Soup* Vegetable Hot and Sour Soup* Very Simple Pumpkin Soup Zucchini Tofu Bisque *Soups with optional chicken or fish additions.

S HAKESPEARE O ne of the greatest pleasures at the end of a day is coming home to a meal ready and waiting for you. Especially during the cold months, a warm stew and a piece of good bread make the perfect light meal. Making a stew in a slow cooker in the morning will ensure that a hearty and healthy meal is avail- able for the whole family later in the day. Stews provide us with an abundance of tastes and textures, all found in a convenient one-pot meal that is hearty, warm, healthy, comforting, and very nurturing. Stews are easily made from a mixture of beans, vegetables, spices, and fresh herbs. Traditional stews are stewed with large cuts of meats and vegetables for long periods of time. The mod- ern twist on stew cuisine decreases the stewing time to a quick and delicious stew in less than 30 minutes using previously"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"cooked beans. Using either the soup kettle on the stove or an electric slow cooker, you can create wonderful, hearty stews with a variety of beans, legumes, root vegetables, seasonal veg- etables, and fresh herbs. Vegetable and bean stews without meats can be cooked in a slow cooker for from 4 to 6 hours. Stews with added meats such as beef or chicken can take longer, from 6 to 8 hours. Presoaking your beans overnight before placing them in the cooker will aid in digestion, and the beans will not absorb as much liquid during the cooking process. If you want to add meat to a stew, always brown the meat first before adding the beans and the vegetables. Helpful Pointers • Keep marinated tofu or tempeh on hand to add to a stew. • Canned beans shorten the cooking time of a stew. • Use good-quality vegetable stock for the best flavor. • Use minced or crushed fresh garlic instead of garlic powder in most recipes. The use of garlic is always optional. Granu- lated garlic can also be used. Use 2 or 3 whole cloves of gar- lic to 1 ⁄ 2 teaspoon garlic powder or granulated garlic. • Use fresh or dried herbs. Generally, use twice the amount of fresh herbs as you would dried herbs. For example: 1 1 ⁄ 2 tea- spoon dried basil equals 1 tablespoon finely sliced fresh basil. • Be creative. Use what you have in your refrigerator and pantry to create your own stew recipes. • Use a slow cooker for effortless cooking. • If you are using beans in your stew, for the best results soak the beans overnight. Place all of the ingredients in the cooker, making sure there is at least 3 inches of vegetable stock above the level of the beans. Sauté the leeks and the spices together first, and then add the leek mixture to the slow cooker with the other ingredients. Leave out quick-cooking vegetables like spinach until the end.

Make sure the beans are tender to the touch and taste to ensure completion. Using Beans Always drain and rinse soaked beans before using them. The benefit of using already cooked beans is to speed up the cooking process. Use them in the slow cooker and reduce the cooking time to 4 hours on low. On the stovetop, add the beans along with the heavier vegetables, such as squash, carrots, and pota- toes. You can also use 1 14- or 15-ounce can of organic beans to replace 1 cup of dried beans.

O LD R USSIAN P ROVERB I ncluding dessert in every meal is one way of incorporating the sweet taste into each meal. Some of our dessert recipes are wheat-free, dairy-free, egg-free, and gluten-free. Some are protein-enhanced with tofu and nuts and sweetened with mango purée and applesauce. Admittedly, some of our tradi- tional dessert recipes cannot be considered low-fat, as butter, cream, and sugar are used—we believe that an occasional indul- gence is good for the body, mind, and soul. Balance your deca- dent desserts with lighter meals. The quality of ingredients is the most important aspect of good baking. Favor organic dairy products. Use organically raised eggs from free-range chickens, and raw, unbleached"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"sugar. Purchase high-quality organic whole wheat pastry flour, which works well in most applications, for your baking. The recipes for Apricot Pecan Cookies, Double Almond Cookies, Linzertorte Cookies, and Walnut Chocolate Chip Cookies are all variations on a theme. These power-packed cookies make great midday snacks and will satisfy your craving for sweets. You can make all of them in less than 30 minutes. The cookie recipes can be made without wheat by using alter- native flour products such as soy, rice, spelt, or barley flour. The dough also works well as the base of a baked fruit tart. Press the dough into a tart pan, arrange some sliced fruit, such as apples or apricots, on top, and bake for 30 to 40 minutes. Glaze by brushing the fruit with melted jam. This makes a very simple, healthy, and elegant dessert. The Blueberry Orange Cake recipe can be used in a variety of different ways by following the basic cake recipe and changing the fruit and/or the spices to your taste. Helpful Pointers • Careful measuring is important in baking. • Always blend or combine the ingredients very gently, a method referred to in baking as folding in. Use a rubber spatula or a spoon. • Use a whisk to blend together both wet and dry ingredients. The dry ingredients will sift together well without the use of extra tools. • A good assortment of whisks, spoons, spatulas, and stainless steel bowls is essential for baking. Our favorite tool is the 1-ounce ice-cream scoop for quick cookies. 252 T HE C HOPRA C ENTER C OOKBOOK"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"Dessert Recipes Almond Tart Apple Cobbler Apple Custard Pie Apricot Pecan Cookies Banana-Cocoa-Tofu Frozen Mousse Blueberry Orange Cake Berry Tofu Sorbet Cardamom Butter Cookies Chocolate Tofu Mousse with Walnut Coconut Praline Coconut Cookies Cranberry Bliss Balls Double Almond Cookies Double Delight Cookies Kabocha Squash or Pumpkin Pie Lemon Birthday Cake Ginger Cookies Lemon Poppy Seed Cake Mother Earth’s Apple Pie Linzertorte Cookies Oatmeal Power Cookies Peanut Butter Cookies Traditional Awesome Brownies Traditional Chocolate Chip Cookies Unbelievable Double Chocolate Cake Walnut Chocolate Chip Cookies D ESSERTS 253"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"Almond Tart S ERVES 12 1 ⁄ 4 cup whole almonds 1 1 ⁄ 4 cups whole wheat pastry flour 1 ⁄ 4 cup turbinado sugar 1 pinch salt 1 ⁄ 2 cup butter, cut into 1 ⁄ 2 -inch pieces 1 ⁄ 2 teaspoon nutmeg 1 egg yolk or 2 teaspoons mango purée 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 4 cups fresh or sautéed thinly sliced fruit of your choice 1 ⁄ 2 cup turbinado sugar 1 teaspoon arrowroot powder 2 tablespoons butter, cut into small pieces 1 ⁄ 2 cup apricot jam, melted Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.
