The search forholistic approaches to enhance health is permeating every aspect of our cultureand society. Why is there such an explosive interest in natural medicine? It iscertainly not for lack of success from our scientific approach to illness. Majoradvances in physiology, biochemistry, pharmacology, and genetics haveexponentially expanded our understanding of disease, and we have developedpreviously unimaginable new ways to diagnose and treat the afflictions ofhumanity. Within the last fifty years we have eradicated smallpox, minimized therisk of many life-threatening childhood diseases, performed sophisticated brainsurgery, and transplanted organs. In view of these obvious successes of ourmodern medical system, we might imagine that the status of the institutions ofmedicine would be at an all-time high. And yet we know there is pervasivedissatisfaction and frustration with our health care. How can we explain thisparadox?It is the nature of life to strive continually for more evolutionary solutionsto the endless challenges that arise. In this information age, every intelligentperson has access to a vast body of facts and opinions on any subject ofinterest. People facing health concerns no longer depend solely upon theirphysicians for advice and information on the management of their illness.Whether or not you have a health-care background, you have unprecedentedopportunities to learn about your problem. Through the Internet, books,journals, newsletters, and support groups, more and more people are formulatingtheir own view of their illness and how they want to approach it. Patients areno longer passive and are not inclined to be as patient as they once were. Thereis a powerful movement of self-empowerment and consumerism in the world todaythat grew in part out of the sixties mindset of challenging authority.Thalidomide, DES, Fen-Phen, and other highly publicized drug recalls over thepast generation have dampened our unbridled enthusiasm for consuming every newpharmaceutical product as the shortest distance between sickness and health.With expanding information on the role of diet, stress, and activity on healthand disease, many people are asking these new questions of their healthproviders: What should I be eating to help my body heal? How can I better managemy stress? Is there a role for nutritional supplements in the treatment of mycondition?Such questions reflect a deeper one, which we hear each day at the Chopra Centerfor Well Being: What more can I do to be an active partner in my healingprocess? Unfortunately, most of our medical colleagues are ill-prepared toanswer these questions, and often discourage their patients from asking them,directly or indirectly. Consequently, more people are seeking alternativesources of information. The now well-known report of Dr. David Eisenberg showedthat more than two in five Americans sought out “unconventional” medicaltreatment in 1997, while other studies have put the number at closer to one intwo.1 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts1], 2[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts2]What needs are being fulfilled by these unorthodox modalities? In our experienceat the Chopra Center, most people have not rejected medical care; they simplywant to explore other, less toxic alternatives before resorting to a potent drugor procedure; they want to be more than passive receptacles ofphysician-prescribed drugs; they want to go beyond compliance to activepartnership. It is here that herbal medicine can make a contribution to thewell-being of individuals and of our community.According to Ayurveda, India’s ancient medical system, human beings are notmerely thinking physical machines frozen in time and space. Rather, we arenetworks of intelligence in a universe of energy and information. The consciousenergy field of the universe organizes into forms and phenomena spanning theentire range from galaxies to subatomic particles. Somewhere in between arehuman beings, with their physical, emotional, psychological, and spirituallayers. We are in constant and dynamic exchange with our environment through ourbreathing, eating, eliminating, perceptions, and interpretations. It is anillusion of our senses that our boundaries end abruptly at the surface of ourskin.Within this framework, health is more than the mere absence of a laboratoryabnormality; it is the dynamic integration of environment, body, mind, andspirit. Herbal medicine offers a gentle approach to enhance this integration,particularly when the imbalance has not gone too far. Healing plants allow us toreconnect with our environment, accessing the power of nature as our ancestorshave done since antiquity. Herbs can help us normalize disturbed physiologicalfunctions including digestion, elimination and sleep. They can help restoreweakened immunity, settle a turbulent mind and promote detoxification andrejuvenation. Plants provide us expanded and diverse options to synthesizeddrugs, but they do not replace the appropriate use of pharmaceuticals.We wouldn’t use a jackhammer to knock a nail into a wall, nor would we expect toremove the nail with a tweezers. There is an appropriate tool for every job, andthis is certainly true for medicines. In our earlier days as medical doctors, wewould at times prescribe a medication, simply because we did not have any othertools in our toolbox. If we saw someone with annoying migraines, we wouldprescribe a headache medicine. If we believed that a patient was suffering withmild depression, we would prescribe an antidepressant. Difficulty sleeping?Chronic back pain? Indigestion? We could justify prescribing a pharmacologicalagent for just about any problem you might have.When we began seriously and systematically to use holistic approaches, we sawpeople with conditions in which subtler, natural options were more effective,with fewer side effects, than any medication we could offer.One of David’s first experiences with natural medicine was with a woman withmigraine headaches who had not responded to treatment for over a year. Despite atrial of every known headache drug, her discomfort persisted, creatingfrustration for the patient and her doctors, who received regular calls from theemergency room announcing her arrival. Finally, out of desperation, she wastaught a simple meditation technique, instructed to make minor changes in herdiet, and she was prescribed an herbal tea made of feverfew. After just a fewweeks she related a major improvement in her headache pattern, and within sixmonths no longer required medical care for what had been a lifelong condition.Deepak vividly recalls one of his early cases in which he prescribed herbalaromatherapy for a woman with life-threatening heart irregularities. She wastaught to associate the herbal scent with a healing meditation technique and waseventually able to eliminate her need for medication, to the astonishment of hercardiologist. The plural of anecdote is not science, but even doctors can beimpressed by their personal experiences. We are increasingly reassured by thegrowing body of scientific literature demonstrating the measurable benefits ofherbal remedies, which we see every day at the Chopra Center.On the other hand, people sometimes have unrealistic expectations of herbs.Resorting to a blend of wishful thinking and denial, women with abnormalmammograms, smokers with problematic chest X-rays, and overweight people withdangerously elevated blood sugars may go on quests to find the “magical” herbthat will cause their physical problem to evaporate, preferably without anyother lifestyle change. With these patients, we have learned that compassionate,honest education is the key to enlisting their choice of a course that isrealistic and likely to succeed. Herbs can add tremendous value in thesecircumstances, but they are not a substitute for appropriate medical care.An herbal medicine can be a powerful ingredient in a holistic health program,but it should not be expected to carry the entire healing responsibility. Herbscan help support, nourish, and balance the physiology, and they can helpdetoxify and replenish, but although they can play an important role, herbsshould not, by themselves, be expected to eradicate metastatic cancer, cureinfertility, or reverse an inherited degenerative disease. Our goal in this bookis to honor plant-based medicines for their contribution to our health withoutover- or underestimating their value. With this approach, we believe we will seea greater interest in, and acceptance of, these powerful, ancient healingsubstances.THE ANTIDOTE TO ANGUISH AND ALIENATIONIn our growing mastery of the world, we may forget that there is a profoundunderlying intelligence that expresses itself in nature. Many people living inurban centers spend days, weeks, and months without the opportunity to immersethemselves in a natural environment. Driving through rush-hour traffic to workin an office without access to fresh air alienates us from our environment andultimately from ourselves. Fast-food meals and commercial entertainment providefew reminders that we ourselves are magnificent expressions of Mother Nature. Webelieve that deep in our evolutionary soul we long for a sense of connection toour environment. Our resurgent fascination with herbs may nurture that part ofour spirit that is calling for a simpler life and a more innocent time when wefelt closer to the natural world. Perhaps we are enamored with herbal medicinesbecause it is in our nature to use the plants in our environment to balance andheal us. To this end, we hope The Chopra Center Herbal Handbook providesvaluable guidance on your journey to well-being."},{"pageContent":"2A BRIEF TOUR THROUGH HERBAL HISTORYHe preferred to know the power of herbs and their value for curing purposes,and, heedless of glory, to exercise that quiet art.—VIRGIL, AENEIDOnce upon a time, a small, apelike creature pulled itself up on two legs to geta better view of its environment. Over the next several million years, its braingot bigger while its hair got thinner, until about 100,000 years ago atool-using, language-creating being evolved that anthropologists now call human.While sampling their surroundings, human beings developed an unwritten roster ofwhich plants in their environment tasted good, tasted bad, made them feelbetter, or made them sick. This knowledge of vegetative power, passed down fromgeneration to generation, was collected to answer the perennial questions thatall of us face at times: How can I fulfill my hunger? How can I relieve mysuffering? How can I maintain my vitality?Long before our beginning as human beings, we were inextricably interwoven withthe plant kingdom. We cannot imagine a world without green things, because wecould not exist without plants. From the time that plants and animals took theirfirst separate evolutionary steps, we have remained interdependent. Without thealchemy that plants perform of transforming light into sugar and oxygen, animalscould not have arisen or survived. We owe our very existence to the herbalkingdom, although most of us rarely even consider the contribution of herbs toour well-being. Although we supply carbon dioxide for their consumption, ourgrowing exploitation of the natural environment leaves us in deepening debt tothe generous greenery that has sustained the animal world for millions of years.One of our hopes in writing this book is to add to the growing chorus of voicesstriving to alert humanity to the recklessly dangerous self-destructive paththat decimating our natural habitats heralds. Immense untapped healing wisdomlives in the plants of our planet, and it is both our responsibility and ourbirthright to honor the gifts they offer. Let’s spend a few moments looking atthe important role that healing plants have played in our lives since the dawnof humankind.IN THE BEGINNINGThe evolution of herbal medicine is a fascinating story. As every parentexperiences firsthand, infant human beings have a tendency to put everythinginto their mouths. We suspect that early humans had a similar propensity,sampling every fruit, flower, leaf, bark, and root, looking for sources ofnourishment. At times they discovered powerful medicines, and at other timespowerful poisons. Often the same plant could be both, depending upon the dosageand part ingested. A few leaves of foxglove infused into a tea could strengthenthe heart, while a more potent brew could stop it altogether, after firstcausing vomiting and turning one’s vision green. Drops of sap from an unripepoppy could soothe a crampy digestive tract and relieve the pain of a wound, buttoo much would lead to constipation, lethargy, and even death. A decoction ofsenna pods might induce a complete bowel evacuation, but a few too many leavescould empty a person to the point of dehydration. Some plants had powerfulactions, while others were subtler. After discovering the effect of a particularplant, efforts to define the most potent components would follow, be it theleaf, root, or berry. Herbal knowledge advanced through trial and error, withoutthe benefit of animal testing, but almost certainly with the benefit of animalobservation. Many wild animals, from birds to gorillas, seek out specific plantswhen they are feeling under the weather. Attentive hunters may have noticed thebear chewing long pepper after her fray with a venomous viper, or a wolf eatingipecac to induce vomiting after consuming a poisonous lizard, and subsequentlyinvestigated their medicinal properties.As tribes became more proficient in meeting their basic survival needs,specialized roles could be supported, the first of which was that of themedicine person. In addition to knowledge about the spirit world, the tribalhealer developed a repertoire of secret healing substances that was jealouslyguarded, selectively handed down to suitably prepared initiates. Native cultureson every continent developed healing traditions replete with medicines derivedfrom nature’s pharmacy. Although the herbal traditions of Africa may be older,the recording of medicinal substances was first achieved in Asia.Over 4,500 years ago the Chinese emperor Shen Nung cataloged a compendium ofmedicinal herbs. At about the same time, Indus Valley healers organized the bodyof knowledge that has come to be known as Ayurveda. In both of these ancientcultures, healing herbs and the knowledge of how to use them were held to be ofdivine origin. In their compassion for the suffering of humanity, the godsbestowed their wisdom on the humble healing sages of antiquity, who transmittedit to their students.In Ayurveda, the timeless healing system from India, the ascetic sage Bhardwajawent to Lord Indra to learn how human beings could live long, happy lives.Bhardwaja imparted this knowledge to Atreya, who handed it to Agnivesa, thefirst to write it down. The subsequent expansion by Charaka, a later disciple inthe school of Atreya, is still available today and remains one of the classictexts of Ayurveda, describing almost four hundred medicinal herbs. One ofAtreya’s eminent students, Jivaka, is said to have passed his final exam byreturning empty-handed after receiving instructions to bring back all uselessplants from the kingdom. With this response he demonstrated the essentialprinciple of Ayurveda—that all things have healing potential.Closer to home, the Egyptian school of medicine founded in Alexandria threehundred years before the birth of Christ is believed to have accumulated asubstantial body of medical knowledge. Unfortunately, we’ll never know for sure,since all the medical texts, along with 700,000 other books, were burned byreligious fanatics in the fourth century A.D. The Greek system of medicine,established at about the same time as the Alexandrian school, fared somewhatbetter. Hippocrates, in his Materia Medica, carefully described many herbalmedicines still prized today, including poppy, rosemary, sage, and mugwort.Several hundred years later, in the first century A.D., another Greek physician,Dioscorides, compiled De Materia Medica. In his work, the physician to EmperorNero described the use of over five hundred healing herbs. This work remainedthe standard text of the medical arts through the Middle Ages.The discovery of the New World by European explorers can largely be attributedto the importance of herbal medicine. Five hundred years ago the great WesternEuropean powers felt exploited by the merchants trafficking in herbs and spicesfrom the Far East. Finding a shortcut to the botanical riches of India was theprimary goal of Columbus when he sailed west at the end of the fifteenthcentury. The unanticipated interruption of his trip between Europe and Asia bythe American continent opened a new chapter in the history of the world andmedicine.The New World unveiled a bounty of natural resources, including tens ofthousands of unique botanicals. Europeans encountered Native American culturesthat possessed rich and reliable knowledge of the medicinal value of hundreds ofindigenous plants. Early settlers in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuriesexperienced the healing potency of many native plants that remain householdwords today. Ginger, goldenseal, black cohosh, sassafras, ginseng, and angelicaare just a few of the original flora that were known to aboriginal Americans andvalued as healing substances. Efforts to systematically catalog the naturalpharmacy of America were unfortunately neglected until many of the traditionalhealing cultures had been destroyed. The contribution of indigenous Americanmedicine was finally recognized by the renowned Philadelphia physician BenjaminRush, who thus empowered other early-nineteenth-century doctors to compileguides to Native American plant lore. The practice of medicine innineteenth-century America blended a rich botanical pharmacy with an expandingchoice of chemically derived substances at a time when the division betweennatural and scientific medicine had not yet been established.MEDICINE IN THE SCIENTIFIC AGEThe medical pharmacopoeia two hundred years ago was a primarily a botanicalcompendium; not until the early 1800s were the first chemically derived drugsdeveloped. One of the earliest efforts was that of F. W. A. Sertürner, whoextracted white crystals from opium, which, when given to dogs, put them tosleep. He called this powder morphine, after Morpheus, the Greek god of dreams.With the development of more-sophisticated chemical methods, alkaloids fromother powerful plants were distilled, including cocaine from coca leaves andquinine from the cinchona tree. As more purified and concentrated derivatives ofplants became available, the importance of the original botanical sources fadedinto the background. The prioritization of synthesized drugs over naturalsources became so complete that modern students at Western medical universitiesreceive no formal training in the use of botanicals. Today’s physicians applythe term “medicine” solely to compounds created by a pharmaceutical company andingested in the form of a tablet or capsule. The idea that an infusion, tea, ortincture derived from an herb can be a therapeutic substance is a foreignconcept to most Western medical doctors.The scientific age has brought us unparalleled prosperity. The application ofmodern physics and chemistry principles has enabled human beings to survive andthrive in an almost unlimited range of environments. With cellular telephones,fax machines, lightweight plastics, and synthetic fibers we are capable ofexploring and communicating from outer space and the depths of the oceans.Applying scientific principles to medicine has led to remarkable diagnostic andtherapeutic discoveries that have improved the quality and length of our lives.Our ability to treat acute illnesses is unprecedented in the history ofhumanity. However, our exclusive reliance upon drugs in the treatment of illnesshas also led to antibiotic-resistant bacteria and hundreds of thousands ofserious annual medical complications resulting from the overuse or misuse ofpharmacological agents.In our quest to synthesize new and more-powerful pharmaceuticals, the medicalcommunity has forgotten the important role that medicinal plants continue toplay. Of the 150 most popular pharmaceutical products sold today, over eightycontain active ingredients derived from natural sources. From morphine toMetamucil, from quinine to camphor, from aspirin to atropine, many of our modernmedicines are rooted in substances with roots. Recently we have been reminded ofthe importance of plant sources of drugs with the discovery of taxol, thepowerful chemotherapy agent derived from the Pacific yew tree. This was theresult of a concerted National Cancer Institute program in which more thanthirty thousand plants were screened for medicinal activity.1[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts1] Other important cancer-fightingdrugs have been derived from botanical sources, including vincristine andvinblastine, from the Madagascan periwinkle, and etoposide, a powerfulchemotherapy agent from the May apple plant.Only about 2 percent of the more than 250,000 species of higher plants have beencarefully evaluated for medicinal activity. One company, Shaman Pharmaceuticals,has used anthropological information about healing substances to test plants formedicinal activity. In a review of over two hundred plants that are used tofight infectious diseases in traditional healing systems, they found that over60 percent showed some activity against viruses growing in a laboratory.2[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts2] The potential for deriving uniqueand powerful medicines from the vegetable kingdom is immense, but withdeforestation of our rain forests occurring at a rate of over 34,000 squaremiles each year, we are at continuous risk of losing valuable and irreplaceablehealing plants. For our health and the health of our ecology, we need to regainthe reverence for the plant kingdom that was expressed in an ancient Vedic hymn:You Herbs, born at the birth of timeMore ancient than the gods themselves.O Plants, with this hymn I sing to youOur mothers and our gods.THE ECONOMICS OF NATUREHerbal medicine has never left us, although for most of the last generation shehas been in hibernation. In the United States we have not established a placefor herbs in our therapeutic armamentarium, so we have relegated them to thesame category as food. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires anysubstance purported to have therapeutic value to go through a safety andefficacy process that usually costs hundreds of millions of dollars. Since mostherbal products use unprocessed or minimally processed plant material, it isessentially impossible to get an exclusive patent on a medicinal herb. Thereforeit is not financially feasible for a pharmaceutical company to invest the moneynecessary to obtain FDA approval. The only other option has been to label herbsas dietary supplements, which means that no specific therapeutic claims can bemade for them. This approach has led to very little regulated or reliableinformation on how to use herbal medicines safely and rationally. Unfortunately,owing to the lack of information on herbs provided to physicians in training atWestern medical colleges, the role of herbs has remained marginal.This does not mean that the American public has neglected medicinal herbs.Indeed, recent estimates are that one in three Americans spends more than fiftydollars per year on herbs, adding up to a collective value of over $3 billion in1996.3 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts3] Just one year later theestimate rose to over $5 billion.4 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts4]Over $90 million is spent on Gingko biloba alone, and with recent studiesconfirming its efficacy in Alzheimer’s disease, gingko’s usage will undoubtedlyexpand even further.5 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts5] Reportsconfirming the value of St. John’s wort for depression will surely increase itspopularity above and beyond the nearly fifty million dollars spent on it in1997.6 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts6]In Europe, unlike America, herbs have held a more acceptable status among themainstream medical establishment. Herbal products stand side by side withprescription drugs in European pharmacies and are classified as medicines. About1,400 herbal substances are available in the European community, with 1996 salesamounting to more than $7 billion. In the field of herbology, Germany stands outas the most progressive Western country, with an estimated 30 percent of allbotanical medicines prescribed by medical doctors, and more than three out offour doctors routinely prescribing herbs in their practice. The AmericanBotanical Council has recently published the English translation of the GermanCommission E Monographs, which is a compilation of the medicinal value of almostfour hundred herbs.7 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts7] Thecommission, founded by the German Federal Health Agency, reviewed informationfrom scientific and traditional sources to reach its findings on the safety andefficacy of these herbal products. The result of this integrative approach isthat the polarity between mainstream and alternative medicine has diminished,and mainstream medical doctors have the opportunity to witness the benefits ofherbal medicine firsthand. Our hope is that as our collective awareness of thevalue of nature’s pharmacy rises in America, our health-care system willremember that the purpose of medicine is to relieve suffering, and that thispurpose transcends all other concerns. Fortunately there are recent signs thatwe are moving in this direction. A recent report in the Journal of the AmericanMedical Association found that almost two out of three medical schools are nowoffering some type of introductory course in complementary and alternativemedicine.8 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts8] As credible informationon the value of herbal medicine becomes available, we can hope to see acontinuation of this trend and the dissolving of the artificial boundary between“orthodox/allopathic” and “holistic/alternative.” This book is dedicated tomoving us a few steps closer to the integrated approach to life and health that,as understood by Jivaka and King Solomon, recognizes that “to every thing thereis a season, and a time to every purpose under heaven.” Surely there is a timeand purpose for the abundant healing resources from our herbal kingdom."},{"pageContent":"3HOLISTICALLY HERBALGod Almighty first planted a garden.—FRANCIS BACONThe relief of suffering is a noble goal. In pursuit of this end, herbalmedicines can play an important role. However, we are not proponents of herbalallopathy. One of the most frequent complaints we hear about Western medicine isthat it is too symptom-oriented. If you have indigestion, your doctor canprescribe an antacid or an H2 receptor blocker. For your arthritis there’s ananti-inflammatory medicine. There are laxatives for your constipation, sleepingpills for your insomnia, and muscle relaxants for your back strain. Most ofthese pharmaceuticals provide temporary symptomatic relief, but have limitedimpact on the basic cause of the illness. Mahatma Gandhi once lamented that theproblem with Western medicine is that it is too effective. A person can eat ameal of junk food devoid of nutritional value, develop terrible indigestion, andthen take a couple of antacid tablets. Within a few minutes the condition isrelieved without the person having to pay any consequences for his choices. Themedications short-circuit Mother Nature’s feedback loop, and as a result thereis little motivation to change behavior.It is possible to use herbal medicines in a similar way. If your bowels aresluggish, you can take some Cascara sagrada. For your migraine headaches thereis feverfew. Feeling a little anxious? Try some kava. These days there arealmost as many herbal approaches to common health concerns as there arepharmacological ones. We often see people who believe they are following anatural health-enhancing program because they are taking a host of herbs andnutritional supplements. Although herbs can provide value as symptomaticmedicines, they are much more powerful when used as part of a holistic healingprogram. Rather than simply taking valerian to help you sleep at night, look atthe underlying issues that are keeping you awake. Instead of automaticallyresorting to amalaki or licorice for your heartburn, explore your diet andlifestyle for areas of improvement that may make the need for anacid-neutralizing substance unnecessary.Years ago we heard a renowned Ayurvedic doctor say that herbs are to healing asan inheritance is to success. If children are truly worthy, no inheritance isnecessary, because they will be capable of generating their own success.Alternatively, if the children are unworthy of the inheritance, no amount ofmoney will be of much value to them, as they are likely to squander theirresources. In an analogous way, if a person is living a balanced life, herbalmedicines provide health-promoting advantages, but if a person is not living abalanced life, an herb alone will not be able to compensate fully for poor diet,lack of exercise, or a toxic lifestyle. The gifts from nature’s garden are oftremendous value, but they are not a substitute for a life in balance. Let’slook at how we can use herbs in conjunction with basic components of a healthylifestyle to create the highest level of well-being.EAT HEALTHYAccording to Ayurveda, food is our best medicine, for the physical body isessentially DNA wrapped in food. What we eat and how we eat it determines ourhealth and vitality. Before adding herbal supplements, look at your diet andmake certain that it is balanced and delicious. To ensure that your meals arenourishing and appetizing, become familiar with the “Six Tastes” approach.Everything we can ingest through our mouth can be classified according to one ormore of six primary tastes: sweet, sour, salty, pungent, bitter, or astringent.Sweet taste characterizes foods that are sources of carbohydrates, protein, orfat. Pasta, bread, dairy, rice, grains, fish and meat are considered sweet. Weconsume the sour taste, which is due to natural organic acids, in the form ofcitrus fruits, berries, and tomatoes. Fermented foods, including yogurt, cheese,and vinegar, are also sources of dietary sour. We get the salty flavor fromtable salt, soy sauce, and seafood. The pungent taste is carried in onions,garlic, peppers, and many spices, including black pepper, cayenne, thyme,cinnamon, basil, and cloves. Foods with the bitter flavor include green leafyvegetables, other green and yellow vegetables, and many bitter herbs such ascilantro, coriander, cumin, dill, and fenugreek. Most medicinal herbs have apredominantly bitter taste. The astringent taste creates a sensation ofpuckering on the mucous membranes due to the presence of tannic acids. Beans,legumes, cranberries, pomegranate, and green tea are common sources of theastringent taste. If all six tastes are present at each meal, ample calories,protein, vitamins, minerals, and natural, health-promoting plant chemicals willbe abundant in your diet.Taste Function Common Sources SWEET• most nutritive• builds body tissuesugar, honey, milk, butter, rice, breads, pastas, meats (carbohydrates, fats,proteins) SOUR• improves appetite and digestion• promotes digestioncitrus fruits, yogurt, cheese, tomatoes, pickles, vinegar (organic acids) SALTY• mildly laxative/sedative• promotes digestionsalt, sauces, salted meats and fish (mineral salts) PUNGENT• stimulates digestion• clears congestionhot peppers, salsa, ginger, radishes, mustard, cloves, horseradish (essentialoils) BITTER• anti-inflammatory• detoxifyinggreen leafy vegetables, celery, sprouts, beets, lemon rind (alkaloids,glycosides) ASTRINGENT• drying• compacts systembeans, tea, apples, cabbage, pomegranates, cauliflower, dark leafy greens(tannins)We can use herbs to ensure that all six tastes are available at each meal. Herbsand spices add flavor and help enhance our appetite and digestion. Bitter andpungent herbs are most useful to stimulate our digestive juices. A gingerapéritif made from equal parts fresh ginger juice, lemon juice, and water,sweetened with a little honey, is a delicious and potent appetite enlivener. Ifyour appetite has been suppressed by recent illness or emotional distress,bitter herbs can stimulate your digestive fire. The classic bitter herb isgentian, a root used in cultures around the world for its detoxifying andappetite-enhancing effect. Fifteen minutes before a meal, mix one-quarterteaspoon of gentian powder with black pepper and allow it to dissolve on yourtongue before swallowing the blend. This will start your salivary and gastricjuices flowing, enabling you to digest your food more effectively.Many culinary herbs and spices have both flavor-enhancing and digestivebenefits. Basil, cayenne, mustard seeds, oregano, savory, and thyme all supplythe pungent taste and strengthen digestion. Cumin, coriander, fennel, and dillare less intense digestive enhancers, ideal for people who need digestivestimulation but have a tendency toward heartburn and indigestion. If you areinclined toward gas and bloating, try adding bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon,cloves, mint, or nutmeg to your cooking. The balanced use of culinary herbs andspices can transform a boring meal into a sumptuous feast that is nourishing anddigestible.EAT CONSCIOUSLYHow we eat is as important as what we eat. The way we prepare and consume a mealis as essential to its nourishing effects as its composition of carbohydrate,protein, vitamins, and minerals. Trying to make up for food hastily prepared andhurriedly eaten with nutritional supplements doesn’t work. Your attention is themost powerful healing force available to you, and eating with awareness cantransform your meals from mere refueling into a healing experience. Try payingattention to the following five simple principles, and watch your quality ofnourishment rise.1. Listen to your appetite. Eat when you are really hungry and stop when you arefull. This means listening to and honoring the signals of your body. When it ismealtime, ask yourself, “Am I really hungry now?” If the answer is no, wait awhile, observing your appetite until you are ready to feed your digestive fire.2. Pay attention to what you are eating. Try not to be doing other things wheneating, such as watching television, talking on the phone, driving, or working.Focusing on the sensations, sights, flavors, and smells of your food enhancesyour digestion and improves your ability to extract nourishment from your meals.3. Eat to fulfill your nutritional needs. You cannot satisfy emotional needswith food. Although you may experience temporary calming of emotional turbulenceafter eating a piece of cheesecake, the benefits will be short-lived. Addressyour emotional needs through self-inspection and open and honest communication.Address your nutritional needs through healthy, balanced, lovingly preparedmeals.4. Favor freshly prepared foods. To the greatest extent possible, minimize yourintake of canned, frozen, leftover, microwaved, and highly processed foods. Taketime to choose and prepare vegetables, whole grains, and legumes that are richin vital energy. For most people, lightly cooked vegetables are easier to digestthan raw ones. Fresh fruit and vegetable juices are rich sources of nutrientsand a healthy alternative to nutritionally empty sodas.5. Honor your mealtimes. Define a time and space for your meals that allow youto honor the sacred act of metabolizing the energy and information of yourenvironment into the substance of your body. If you are eating in a rush, youare less likely to be discerning about what or how much you consume. Stop eatingwhen you are satiated, rather than when there is nothing left on your plate.Make certain that all six tastes are present at each meal, and you will avoidthe tendency to eat more in order to feel satiated.ELIMINATE TOXICITYEverything we ingest can be evaluated in terms of whether it provides us withnourishment or toxicity. Look at your environment and see if there are sourcesof toxicity that you can reduce or eliminate. We may not be able to controldirectly the concentration of ozone in our atmosphere, but we can eliminatetoxic substances from our personal environment. We may not be able to createpeace in the Balkans, but we can improve our personal relationships throughgreater understanding and tolerance. Look at your home and work environments andsee how you can transform toxicity into nourishment. Eliminate tobacco,excessive alcohol, and drugs from your life. Release from your heartself-destructive emotions such as resentment, hostility, and regret. Releasefrom your mind limiting beliefs, including self-loathing and prejudice. In theclearing of toxicity from your body, mind, and soul, vitality and well-beingwill again flow freely.Herbs can be very helpful in reducing physical toxicity. If you have beenovereating or indulging in unhealthy behaviors, simplify your diet and take aloevera juice internally in a dosage of one ounce twice daily. Ginger tea, madefrom one teaspoon of grated fresh ginger per pint of hot water, is also helpfulin encouraging your body to detoxify. If you are attempting to stop smoking, trysucking on a natural cinnamon stick whenever you have the urge; the sweetspiciness of cinnamon can be a natural substitute for tobacco while satisfyingyour oral needs. Sucking on clove buds can provide a similar benefit. Short-termuse of bitter herbs such as goldenseal, echinacea, and neem can be helpful inclearing congestion and toxicity after surgery, an illness, or an emotionallyand physically challenging time. Since these herbs can be depleting, do not takethem continuously for longer than two weeks at a time.HONOR NATURE’S RHYTHMSNature functions in seasons, cycles, and rhythms. Every cell in our body has anintrinsic beat of rest and activity that evolved over millions of years ofevolutionary time. Hormone levels, temperature regulation, immune function,digestive enzymes, sleep-wake cycles, and cellular reproduction all go throughphases of rest and activity. In this age of technology we have the possibilityof ignoring our internal biological clock and can stay up until two o’clock inthe morning, eat our meals at any hour of the day or night, and sleep untilnoon. Despite our apparent freedom to disregard the rhythms of nature, ourbodies pay a toll. Our lack of resonance with the environment contributes toinsomnia, depression, concentration problems, and digestive ailments. Most of ushave had the experience of jet lag, in which our inner clock is out of sync withthe environment in which we arrive, and we feel disoriented and disconnected. Byfollowing a natural daily routine, we can improve the harmony between our innerand outer rhythms. Establishing an ideal daily routine is essential to enhancingour well-being. See if you can shift your choices in the direction of thisrecommended lifestyle pattern.HERBS AND ROUTINENo herb is going to force you into bed by ten o’clock, but a calming herb canhelp you drift off to sleep more effortlessly. A tea made from chamomile,valerian, hops, passionflower, or the Ayurvedic herb jatamansi can help quiet aturbulent mind and allow you to drift from waking into the sleeping state ofconsciousness. Even a cup of hot milk to which nutmeg, cardamom, or a fewsaffron threads are added can encourage restful sleep.Ideal Daily RoutineAwaken around sunrise.Empty your bowels and bladder.Shower, brush your teeth, clean your tongue.Meditate.Eat breakfast if you are hungry.———Eat lunch at noon, preferably as your largest meal.Take a walk after lunch.———Meditate before dinner.Eat a light dinner, no later than seven o’clock.Take a walk after dinner.———Have light evening activity.Be in bed with the lights out no later than 10:30 P.M.If you are having difficulty with regular daily elimination, several gentleherbal agents can help normalize digestion. Psyllium, flaxseed, or a classicalAyurvedic formula called Triphala are bulk-forming herbal products that enhancemovement through the digestive tract without irritating the colon or creatingbowel laziness. A diet rich in fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, andlegumes will provide natural sources of the fiber that is essential to regularelimination.If you have difficulty maintaining the energy level you need for success and joyin your life, first look at the basics of your daily routine, then consideradding a tonic herb to your diet. There is a class of Ayurvedic herbs known asrasayanas or rejuvenatives that provide a subtle level of nourishment. Theprimary woman’s rasayana is a type of wild asparagus called shatavari. Theprimary men’s rasayana comes from the root of the winter cherry bush, calledashwagandha in Sanskrit. Ginseng has an established tradition in Asia as arejuvenative, and is receiving growing attention in the West. Other, morecommonly known tonics include garlic, almonds, licorice, milk, and honey.Ingesting these nourishing substances can contribute to a healthy daily routinein which you have energy available when you need it.USE YOUR SENSESWe consume the world through our five senses. What we hear, touch, see, taste,and smell is metabolized into the chemistry and electricity of our body and canmake the difference between health and sickness, life and death. Soothing,beautiful sounds can calm colicky babies, improve the immune response of aperson with AIDS, and reduce the chance of surgical complications during anoperation. Regularly immerse yourself in natural environments where the onlysounds you hear are those of nature—the breeze rustling through the trees, thebirds warbling in the bushes, the stream rushing over the rocks. Theseprimordial sounds bring us back to our centered place of healing.Stimulating our inner pharmacy through the sense of touch has been a feature ofhealing traditions around the world since the beginning of humanity. Usingbotanically derived, herbalized oils during massage can enliven the integrationbetween mind and body. Sesame, almond, coconut, olive, sunflower, or jojoba oilsto which sandalwood, jasmine flowers, neem, camphor, or ginger have been addedcan be soothing or enlivening, depending upon the plant added.A daily self-massage is one of the simplest and most important therapeuticapproaches we can do for ourselves. Try adding this ritual to your daily routineprior to your bath or shower, using a few tablespoons of a natural oil, warmedabove body temperature.Visual stimuli to which we are exposed also affect our well-being. Receivinguplifting rather than demoralizing visual input can trigger the release of ourinternal healing chemicals. Just looking at a bountiful, lush landscape canlower our blood pressure and reduce the level of circulating stress hormones.Spend time in your garden, hiking through the woods, or strolling in the park.Take in the sights of nature for their balancing and healing influence.The fragrances of the world have a subtle yet profound effect on our mind andbody. The surging interest in aromatherapy reflects our need to reconnect withnature. Essential oils derived from flowers, fruits, herbs, and spices enable usto take nature into our home environment. Almost any plant-based substance thatcan be ingested as an herb can be extracted to produce an essential oil.Lavender, rose, chamomile, nutmeg, and olibanum extracts are just a few of themany essential oils that can be used to calm and soothe. Juniper, ginger,cinnamon, rosemary, and cardamom are examples of aromatic oils that arestimulating and enlivening. Explore the fragrances derived from the plantkingdom and create an aromaphar-macy for yourself.HERBS AND WHOLENESSWe are inextricably connected to the plant kingdom. The air we breathe and thefood we eat, along with the sounds, sensations, sights, and smells that surroundus, are infused with the essence of plants. We encourage you to consider yourrelationship with herbs as more than alternative medicines that you take for theinevitable uncomfortable symptoms of life. Rather, use your botanical friends toremind you about gaining and maintaining balance in life, through what you eat,the rhythms of your day, and your sensory experiences. We can use the herbalkingdom to point us in the direction of health, which, in essence, is a state ofwholeness.Performing an Oil MassagePour a tablespoon of warm oil on your scalp, massaging the oil in vigorously.Cover your entire scalp with small circular strokes, as if you were shampooing.Move to your face and ears, massaging more gently. Apply a little oil to yourhands and massage your neck, front and back, then your shoulders.Vigorously massage your arms, using a circular motion at the shoulders andelbows and long back-and-forth motions on the long parts. Using large, gentle,circular motions, massage your chest, stomach, and lower abdomen. A straightup-and-down motion is used over the breastbone. Apply a bit of oil to your handsand reach around without straining to massage your back and spine, usingup-and-down motions.Vigorously massage your legs as you did your arms, in a circular motion at theankles and knees, straight back and forth on the long parts. With the remainingoil, vigorously massage your feet, with attention to the soles and toes.Washing off the oil: Keeping a thin, almost undetectable film of oil on the bodyis considered beneficial for toning the skin and keeping the muscles warm duringthe day. Therefore, wash yourself with warm, not hot, water and mild soap."},{"pageContent":"4SCIENCE-OF-LIFE HERBOLOGYDrugs which have been observed to be efficacious from time immemorial shouldalone be used in the course of a medical treatment.—SUSHRUTA SAMHITAThe timeless wisdom of Ayurveda provides the framework for our healing programsat the Chopra Center for Well Being. The name itself expresses itsall-encompassing domain. Ayur means “life” in Sanskrit, and veda means“knowledge.” Ayurveda, then, is the knowledge or science of life. As an oraltradition passed down from generation to generation, Ayurveda has its roots inthe mists of antiquity. As a codified body of wisdom, two major schools ofAyurvedic medicine are acknowledged. The Charaka school resembled our moderndiscipline of internal medicine, with a primary focus on the prevention andtreatment of chronic disorders. Charaka strongly emphasized the importance ofmind-body interactions in the promotion of health. The Sushruta school had agreater focus on the treatment of acute diseases, which included the developmentof many surgical procedures. Although there is ongoing debate concerning whichsage lived earlier, most medical historians date Charaka and Sushruta to aboutthe fourth or fifth century B.C. Considering how much we have learned abouthealth and sickness over the past several millennia, it is remarkable how manyof the ancient principles of Ayurveda remain relevant today.According to Ayurveda, life is the harmonious interweaving of our environment,body, senses, mind, and spirit. Illness results when there is a loss of balanceand integration between these layers. To establish and maintain good health, weneed to understand our natural state of health and identify the tendencies thattake us away from our optimal state of balance. One of the most importantcontributions of Ayurveda is the recognition that each of us metabolizes theenergy and information of the environment in a unique way. The better weunderstand our intrinsic nature and how our environment influences our state ofbeing, the better we can make choices to optimize our health.Our inner and outer environments are organized according to five primaryelements, described in Ayurveda as space, air, fire, water, and earth. Each ofthese principles represents a primary force that can be applied to the physicalinanimate world, our living biology, and the workings of our mind. Let’s explorethese principles in more detail.The first element, space, represents the potentiality principle from which allpossible expressions of nature arise. Ultimately, the silent emptiness of spaceis the source of all the other elements. Although it is beyond the perception ofthe senses, space is the media in which all sensory experiences arise. In thelanguage of modern physics, space is the unified field in which all the knownforces of nature are expressed.Space gives rise to the second element, air, which represents the movementprinciple that governs the motions of galaxies, the transport of biochemicalsand the activity of subatomic particles. When the movement force flows smoothlywithin living systems, energy and information circulate freely, supportinghealing and evolution.The third element, fire, is the principle of transformation and metabolism.Nuclear reactions in stars are governed by this element, as is energy productionin cells. This force regulates metabolism in the body and must be at an optimallevel of functioning in order to accomplish its mission of energy production. Aswith a nuclear power plant or a fire in your fireplace, there is an ideal levelof activity that allows the energy to be harnessed efficiently. Too much or toolittle fire can have harmful consequences.The fourth element, water, represents the forces of attraction and cohesion. Thegravitational pull between planets, the cohesive forces in a molecule, and theattraction of sweethearts in love are all manifestations of the water principle.Within biological systems, water is the stock of the living soup in which thechemistry of the body brews.Finally, the earth principle is expressed as the matter of the physicaluniverse. Modern physicists assure us that despite the appearance of soliditythat our senses provide, all matter is ultimately nonmaterial, composed ofcondensed energy. Still, the planets, rocks, trees, bodies, organs, cells, andorganelles that make up the stuff of everyday life do exist and are governed bythe earth principle.THE ELEMENTS OF PLANTSThe five primary forces come together in all life forms, where they areorganized into cells, tissues, organs, and organisms. Health results from theharmonious interaction of all the forces and elements in our mind and body.Illness is a loss of this delicate equilibrium. When we experience an imbalancein our physiology, we can use the resources of our environment to reestablishharmony and balance.Plants are elegant expressions of the primary elements, for all five forces arerepresented. They extract the elements from the earth and are our primary sourceof minerals and trace metals. Fortunately, plants have learned how to digest theearth so we don’t have to eat dirt to get our daily helping of minerals. Thereare unique relationships between botany and geology, with certain plants havinga special affinity for specific elements. Wild buckwheat likes to grow wherethere is an abundance of silver in the ground, wild poppy has an appetite forcopper, and horsetail seems to prefer gold. The ability of plants to concentratemolecules of matter provides us with essential elements in forms that aredigestible and absorbable. Certain herbs are inherently more grounding, carryingwithin them an abundance of the earth element. Examples of these heavier, denserherbs derived from roots include ashwagandha, marshmallow, shatavari, and lotus.Plants have evolved elaborate systems to integrate the water element into theirstructure. From roots to leaves, from cacti to melons, water is an essentialcomponent of our botanical friends. Plants are abundant sources of moisture foranimals, and are providers of many water-soluble healing chemicals. Although weconsume an abundance of water when we eat fresh fruits and vegetables, mostmedicinal herbs are dried before we ingest them. Assuming this dehydration isperformed with care, the extraction of water stops the metabolism of the plantbut leaves the active chemicals to be released when we consume them. Medicinalherbs that are naturally rich in the water element include amalaki, aloe vera,slippery elm, and licorice.The fire element is captured by plants through the process of photosynthesis,which converts solar energy into carbohydrates. When we consume plants andherbs, we liberate that energy for our benefit. Without this trapping of lightby our botanical friends, we could not exist. Many herbs concentrate fire, anactivity expressed in their pungency. Ginger, black pepper, cayenne, thyme,cloves, and cinnamon are fiery herbs that generate heat in the body when weconsume them and can be used to kindle a weak digestive fire.From an animal perspective, the air element is one of the prime reasons for theexistence of plants. Plants are the lungs of our living planet, generating ouroxygen and trapping our carbon dioxide waste gases. Many aromatic herbs,including the mints, fennel, camphor, cinnamon, rosemary, and jasmine, can beused therapeutically to improve respiratory function.Certain herbs have unique effects on the nervous system that can be seen asexpressing the element of space. These tend to be consciousness-altering orhallucinogenic substances that have the effect of temporarily expanding themind. Because substances such as peyote, datura, marijuana, psilocybin, andayuhausca are potentially dangerous and illegal in most countries, we won’t beexploring them further in this book. Other, safer herbs that influence the mind,such as Gingko biloba and gotu kola, will be explored.THE ELEMENTS OF HUMANSAs creatures of the universe, we, too, are composed of the five primaryelements. According to Ayurveda, the five primary forces can be reduced in humanbeings to three primary principles that govern our bodies and minds. The firstprinciple, known as Vata in Sanskrit, is responsible for all movement within thephysiology. Composed of a mixture of space and air, the motion principleregulates the movement of thought, muscles, circulation, digestion, andelimination. When the movement principle becomes aggravated or excessive, weexperience anxiety, insomnia, tremor, palpitations, gaseousness, andconstipation. We can settle the movement principle through grounding and calmingbehaviors, foods, and herbs.The second mind-body principle, called Pitta in Sanskrit, is composed of thefire and water elements. Acting as a chemical fire, this principle isresponsible for digestion and metabolism of matter or information we ingest fromthe environment. When the fire principle is aggravated, we experience heartburn,inflammation, skin rashes, hot flashes, and irritability. Herbs that have acooling, soothing influence are useful in pacifying Pitta-aggravated conditions.The third principle is Kapha, composed of the earth and water elements. Kapha isresponsible for maintaining the structure and lubrication of our physiology.When it accumulates excessively, we experience retention and congestion. Sinusproblems, weight gain, diabetes, excessive sleepiness, and fluid retention aremanifestations of too much earth and water in the system. Herbs that have light,heating, and aromatic qualities are beneficial in the treatment of Kaphadisorders.According to the Ayurvedic framework, three issues need to be considered whenapproaching a health concern: the first is the nature of the illness, the secondis the nature of the intervention, and the third is the nature of the person whohas the health problem. Although in Western medicine once we diagnose a disease,we tend to treat it similarly in every person, this is not the case in manynatural health care systems. As physicians, we may collectively label asmigraines, headaches characterized by sharp pains that disturb sleep, those withburning pain that cause irritability, and those associated with a sense ofcongestion and nausea. From an Ayurvedic perspective, however, they reflectdifferent imbalances and require different interventions.Knowing the qualities of an herb is essential if we are to use it effectively.You don’t want to take a depleting herb if your system is already run down, norwould you add predominantly pungent herbs to your diet if you were regularlyoverheating or having hot flashes. We’ll discuss the useful definingcharacteristics of herbs a little later in this chapter.Understanding the person who has the illness is as important as understandingthe illness that has the person. People who naturally have more of one elementin their nature will experience different manifestations of an imbalance orillness from someone who has a natural predominance of another element. Theywill also respond differently to treatment. Although medical doctors experiencethis phenomenon every day, we were not taught to ask, “Why did one patient havea good response to the medication, whereas another patient with similar symptomshad a very negative reaction?” Knowing more about a person’s mind-bodyconstitution can help personalize treatments.If you have not identified the predominant mind-body principles in your nature,complete the following brief survey. Understanding the proportion of elements inyour physiology can help you choose healing interventions that are most suitedfor you. For those who are interested, a more in-depth discussion ofconstitutional typing is available in our earlier books, Perfect Health, TheWisdom of Healing, and Vital Energy.MIND-BODY PRINCIPLESFor each of the twelve traits listed below, see if you can identify onecharacteristic pattern that best applies to you. If you believe that two choicesare equally applicable, you may circle both. Total your scores for each columnto learn the relative proportion of the three principles in your nature.[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_001_r1.jpg]INTERPRETING YOUR SCORESRank your tallies for Vata, Pitta, and Kapha from the highest to the lowestnumber. The highest score usually identifies the principle that is predominantin your mind-body nature. If the largest number is four or more points greaterthan the next principle, you can say that that principle is dominant in yourphysiology. For example, if your scores were Vata = 10, Pitta = 5 and Kapha = 3,Ayurveda would characterize your nature as having the greatest abundance ofVata, with less prominence of Pitta and Kapha. If your two highest scores arewithin three points of each other, then your inherent mind-body naturepredominantly reflects the two top principles, with the third less represented.For example, if your scores were Vata = 4, Pitta = 8 and Kapha = 9, then youwould be classified as Kapha/Pitta with Vata less prominent. Most people willhave two principles within a few points of each other, with the third lessrepresented. The rarest constitutional type is when all three principles areclosely clustered. An example of this pattern would be Vata = 7, Pitta = 6 andKapha = 5. People with this pattern are generally more tolerant of a wider rangeof foods, climates, and sensory experiences.As you learn about the therapeutic effects of specific herbs, pay some attentionto the influence they have on Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. If you have identifiedPitta as the predominant energy in your nature, you may want to be cautious wheningesting an herb that has the tendency to aggravate Pitta. This additionallevel of understanding can be very helpful in effectively using herbalmedicines.HERBAL ENERGETICSHerbs can influence mind and body in different ways. According to Ayurveda, thethree primary levels that must be understood to maximize the value of an herbalmedicine are (1) the proportion of elements as carried in the taste of the herb;(2) the heating or cooling potency of the herb; and (3) the special medicinalqualities that the herb possesses. As an example, nutmeg has a spicy, pungenttaste. In Ayurvedic theory, the pungent taste is composed of the air and fireelements; therefore, taking nutmeg will add to the quantity of these elements inthe system. It has a heating potency, and will therefore tend to increase thetemperature and metabolic activity of the body. What we could not predict on thebasis of its taste or potency is its sedative effect on the nervous system,which makes it an effective sleeping aid when taken in warm milk. Knowing itsother qualities, however, you would use nutmeg more cautiously if you werefeeling overheated or irritable.Symptom-oriented herbology does not take into account the nature of the personor illness. The overall effect of echinacea may not be beneficial in persons whohave a predominance of Vata in their nature, particularly if theirsusceptibility to colds is triggered by poor nutrition and sleep/wake cycles.The use of ginger for morning sickness in a woman with high Pitta may increaseher irritability. Before you take any herbal supplement, we recommend that youask yourself the following questions:Tastes and Elements Taste Elements sweet earth and water sour earth and firesalty water and fire pungent fire and air bitter air and space astringent airand earth1. What are the predominant qualities of the problem I am attempting to resolve?For example, if I have a lingering cough, is it dry or wet, scratchy or thick,cold or hot?2. What are the predicted qualities of the herb, and what are its specialqualities that may benefit my condition? For example, is the herb drying,moistening, purifying, or heating? Does it possess a specific anti-infectiousquality that may help clear up a lingering bronchitis?3. Knowing my predominant mind-body principles, are there any specialprecautions I should exercise? For example, if I am experiencing Vataaggravation, evidenced by anxiety, insomnia, and constipation, could this herbtaken for my cough worsen my mental and physical turbulence?Considering the greater context in which an herb is used honors its potency andenhances the prospect that the herb will have the desired effect on yourwell-being. Remember that herbs are gifts from nature and as such are deservingof our appreciation and respect. Ask from them what they are capable ofproviding and use them with discrimination. Keep in mind the wise words ofSushruta, one of the great Ayurvedic sages, who eloquently expressed the essenceof effective medicines: “A medicine, too strong for the disease it has beenapplied to combat, not only checks it but may give rise to a fresh malady,because its surplus energy is not used up by the weakened and conquereddistemper.… On the other hand, medicines of inadequate potencies, unequal to thestrength of a disease, fail to produce any tangible effect. Therefore, onlymedicines of appropriate power should be administered.”1[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts1]Appropriately applying the power of herbs allows us to tap into the healingpower of nature. Great healers across time and space have understood that healthis a state of dynamic balance and that nature is the supreme healer. TheUpanishads describe our relationship to the elements and forces around us inthis simple description of evolution:“From consciousness arose space—from space, air—from air, fire—from fire,water—from water, earth—from earth, plants—from plants, food—from food, man.”Our botanical friends can help us regain and maintain the harmony we seek withnature and for this gift, we owe our deepest gratitude."},{"pageContent":"5RESTORING BALANCE, CREATING HEALTHRejoice plants, bearing abundant flowers and fruit, triumphing together overdisease like victorious horses, sprouting forth, bearing humanity safe beyonddisease.—RIG VEDAAccording to Ayurveda, every illness progresses through stages of developmentbefore it becomes apparent. Even a simple cold does not spontaneously arise. Thenasty viruses that cause the sneezing, congestion, and misery of anupper-respiratory infection incubate for days, hiding from and then overridingour immune defenses before filling our heads with phlegm. Other chronic diseasessuch as arthritis, heart disease, and cancer generally take years before theyare fully entrenched and declare themselves with signs and symptoms.Ayurveda describes the development of disease as moving through progressivestages of imbalance until the normal homeostatic mechanisms of our body areincapable of reestablishing equilibrium. If we accept this principle, theearlier we intervene therapeutically, the more likely we are to see a benefit.This is particularly true in the use of herbal medicines. Herbs can play animportant role in helping to reestablish balance and are particularly effectiveif the illness has not fully manifested as abnormalities on blood tests orX-rays. The use of herbs in digestive disturbances, anxiety, insomnia,depression, fatigue, menstrual and menopausal discomforts, weight control, andchronic pain syndromes can be very rewarding. In these conditions, we think ofherbal medicines as supplying a subtle form of nourishment to help replenish andrestore physiological systems. When we recommend an herb for a patient withcancer, it is with the intention to reduce toxicity and strengthen immunity. Ifwe suggest an herb for a woman going through menopause, it is to help restorebalance during a time of physiological and emotional transition. Although herbscan effectively address specific symptoms and diseases, they are particularlyhelpful in strengthening the person with the problem, rather than solely as anattack on the problem itself. This approach derives from the model that diseaseis the absence of health, rather than health as the absence of disease. In thisspirit let’s explore various categories of illness and the role that herbs canplay in reducing the distress and suffering that attend these problems.HERBS FOR DIGESTIONEssential to health and well-being is our ability to digest packets of energyand information we derive from the environment and efficiently transform theminto the energy and substance of our body. In Ayurveda, the body is known asanna maya kosha, which means the layer composed of food. Basically, our body iscomposed of molecules derived from food and directed by our DNA into theappropriate sites. Amino acids from the protein in the milk you had forbreakfast may now be serving as a molecular girder in your biceps muscle. Thesugar molecule carried in the tortilla you had for lunch may be providing energyto a nerve cell in your brain. The next time you consume a fruit salad, considerhow the carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicalsare being absorbed in your digestive tract and distributed to the cells andtissues throughout your body. When the processes of digestion, absorption, andelimination are occurring optimally, we take in the nutrition we require andeliminate the waste we don’t need. Each stage of the nutritional process—theinitial digestion of food in the mouth and stomach, the absorption of nutrientsin the small intestines, and the elimination of waste from the colon—must behealthy for us to be healthy. And we can use herbs to enhance each phase of thedigestive process.STAGE 1. APPETITE AND DIGESTIONAppetite and digestion are closely linked and reflect the quality of ourdigestive fire, known as agni in Ayurveda. When our digestive fire is strong, weare able to break down the food we ingest into its basic elements, allowing forthe appropriate sorting of components into those that are nourishing and thosethat are best eliminated. People can have problems with either too little or toomuch digestive fire, resulting in delicate digestion on the one hand andheartburn or acid indigestion on the other. Herbs to stimulate the digestivefire are generally spicy in nature and best taken immediately prior to or with ameal. Ginger, black pepper, cayenne, celery seeds, and long pepper containessential oils that have effects at several levels of the digestive process.Studies from Germany, for example, have suggested that ginger stimulates theflow of salivary enzymes, activates stomach activity, and contains enzymes thathelp digest proteins.1 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts1]Bitter herbs can also enhance the first stage of digestion by way of a neuralreflex between the tongue and our gastric stimulation center in the brain stem.The classical bitter digestive tonic is gentian, which enhances stomach emptyingand stimulates the secretion of enzymes by the stomach, gallbladder, andpancreas. Other bitter herbs that are useful in small quantities to stimulateappetite and digestion include golden seal, aloe vera, and chamomile.On the other end of the spectrum are those conditions in which there isexcessive digestive fire. Hyperacidity, heartburn, gastroesophageal reflux, andpeptic ulcers are expressions of an inefficient digestive fire that isimbalanced in both location and quantity. Cooling herbs that pacify theexcessive heat and encourage a cleaner digestive fire can help reduce heartburnand improve digestion. These include cumin, coriander, fennel, and licorice aswell as the Ayurvedic herbs amalaki and shatavari. They are generally takenafter a meal or when the symptoms of acid indigestion are prominent.STAGE 2. ABSORPTION AND TRANSITOnce food leaves the stomach and enters into the intestines, our body isinvolved in the process of digesting and absorbing the essential nutrientsrequired for meeting the energy and molecular needs of the body. Problems withthis phase of digestion result in gas, bloating, and heaviness after a meal.People with assimilation difficulties often report that even though they areeating healthy foods, they do not feel they are being adequately nourished.Herbs that assist with this phase help coordinate the movement of food throughthe intestines. Nutmeg, chamomile, peppermint, and lemon verbena are herbstraditionally used to reduce abdominal spasms and bloating. Cinnamon, cardamom,and bay are known as the “three carminatives” in Ayurveda, meaning that theyhelp dispel congested intestinal gas. In people who are sensitive to dairyproducts but may not have an actual lactase deficiency, warming milk withcinnamon, cardamom, or nutmeg can often improve their tolerance. Other culinaryherbs useful in reducing bloating include basil, oregano, thyme, coriander,cumin, dill, and fennel. Ayurvedic herbs useful in reducing gas that are not aswell known in the West include wild celery seeds, nutgrass, and long pepper. Ifyou are among the many people who experience bloating after eating beans orlegumes, cooking with asafetida can improve digestive ability.STAGE 3. ELIMINATIONAlthough we were taught in medical school that daily bowel movements were notrequired for good health, most people feel better if they are eliminatingregularly. A fiber-rich diet, with plenty of fresh fruits, vegetables, and wholegrains is the most important contributor to daily elimination. When necessary,adding fiber in the form of psyllium or flaxseed can invigorate sluggish bowels.A classic Ayurvedic formula called triphala consists of three fruits—amalaki,bibhitaki, and haritaki. Like psyllium, the fiber in triphala can help enhanceelimination in people whose bowels are slow, and normalize bowel movements inpeople who tend toward loose stools.Only rarely should an herbal stimulant cathartic be used. Castor oil, cascarasagrada, senna, and aloe are the most common plant-based laxatives that act bystimulating the nerve fibers to the colon and by causing the accumulation ofsalts and water in the intestines. These laxatives can cause abdominal cramping,with cascara the mildest and castor the strongest. The main problem withrepeated use of these herbal stimulants is that the bowel gets lazier the morethey are used. People who resort to them regularly often become trapped in adependency cycle and cannot evacuate without the herbs. Usually, diet, exercise,and bulk-forming herbal remedies are sufficient to keep the bowels movingwithout resorting to stimulant cathartics. Good food is preferable to goodmedicines.HERBS FOR THE MIND AND EMOTIONSEmotional ups and downs are a part of life. Many people go through periods whenthey are feeling enthusiastic and other times when the challenges of life feeloverwhelming. Episodes of worry, anxiety, insomnia, and sadness affect people atall ages. Usually, with the passage of time, the wheel of life turns anduncomfortable emotions transform into more comfortable ones. But occasionally,distressing feelings persist, seeming to take on a life of their own,interfering with relationships and daily activities. When the emotionalchallenge is bothersome but not disabling, a trial of an herbal aid may provideneeded support while the underlying life issue unfolds. In cases of mildanxiety, insomnia, and melancholy, herbs may provide sufficient relief to avoidthe need for prescription medication. If you are in more severe emotionaldistress, however, we strongly encourage you to seek professional assistance anduse all the resources of modern medicine available to get you through yourdifficult time.Herbs that may be of value in supporting emotional balance can be classifiedinto two categories, calming and enlivening. Calming herbs are beneficial whenthe mind is overly turbulent, generating worry and anxiety during the day andinsomnia at night. Enlivening herbs can be helpful when fatigue and depressionare clouding access to your inner source of energy. Modern science is justbeginning to assess seriously the value of herbs to soothe and invigorate themind and emotions.CALMING HERBSThere is a long history of herbal approaches for soothing emotional turbulence.One of the best-known calming herbs is valerian root, used since the time of theRoman Empire. Studies have confirmed valerian’s sedative properties, althoughits active components have yet to be conclusively identified. Hops, anothervaluable relaxing herb, has been prescribed to encourage sound sleep and pacifymental restlessness since the Middle Ages. A sachet of hops is traditionallyplaced under a child’s pillow to deliver sleep-inducing aromatherapy. Anotherplant, passionflower has been shown to have calming activity in animals and iswidely used in European herbal sedative formulas. Rapidly gaining in popularityas a natural sedative is kava kava, an important herb of the Pacific Islands,where it has been used in rituals and ceremonies for thousands of years. Studieshave confirmed that kava possesses measurable anti-anxiety effects, possiblyacting through mechanisms similar to the tranquilizing drug Valium.2[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts2]The Ayurvedic herbal pharmacy offers a number of herbs traditionally used tosupport emotional balance. Ayurveda distinguishes emotional distress accordingto which element is most imbalanced. If a person is having excessive mentalturbulence with stressful, anxious thoughts, a Wind-pacifying herb such asjatamansi is favored. If irritability and anger are creating distress, coolingherbs such as brahmi or gotu kola are prescribed. When there is excessiveaccumulation of toxic, morbid emotions, purifying herbs such as sage or gugguluare recommended. Considering the subtler qualities of an emotional symptom canhelp fine-tune a therapeutic choice.The Western herb St. John’s wort is one of the most popular natural remedies inEurope for the treatment of depression and is currently receiving widespreadinterest in the United States as well. Several studies have attested to itsefficacy in the treatment of mild to moderate depression.3[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts3] Although it takes longer to actthan most pharmaceutical antidepressant drugs, its safety profile makes it anattractive natural mood booster.HERBS TO ENHANCE MENTAL PERFORMANCEAll of us would like to maintain optimal mental performance throughout ourlifetime. Herbs purported to enhance mental function have been a part of thelore of healing traditions for thousands of years. Ginseng, gotu kola, brahmi,and ginkgo are among the best-known botanicals that have been promoted toimprove memory and cognitive function. Traditional texts extol the virtues ofthese mind-enhancing herbs, although it has been challenging for science toconvincingly document the benefits of many of these plants. The notableexception has been ginkgo, which has been the subject of several studiesconfirming its memory-improving potential in both animals and humans. Ginkgo isa potent antioxidant, but its demonstrated value in slowing the progression ofAlzheimer’s disease almost certainly involves other mechanisms. An interestingrecent animal study from Germany demonstrated that a combination of ginkgo andginger could reduce anxiety without impairing memory, unlike pharmaceuticalagents such as Valium, which characteristically sacrifice memory for theirsedative effects.4 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts4] It is obviousthat there is a treasure chest of untapped herbs for the mind and emotions thatare calling for scientific exploration. The next century may become the era ofrediscovering nature’s pharmacy.HERBS TO ENHANCE WOMEN’S HEALTHWomen have traditionally used nature’s botanical gifts during times oftransition in their reproductive cycles—to relieve premenstrual distress, toprovide support during pregnancy and labor, and to ease the symptoms ofmenopause. Often the same herbs are used throughout a woman’s life and areclassified as “female tonics.” Black cohosh from America, chaste-tree berriesfrom the Mediterranean region, and dong quai from China are the best-known herbsused to balance the female reproductive system. Although their precisemechanisms are not fully understood, there is scientific evidence that thesetraditional medicines work.One of the most popular women’s herbs is black cohosh, prized by Native Americanwoman for use during both reproductive and menopausal years. Studies havesuggested that black cohosh can alleviate menopausal symptoms, although it isunclear exactly how it acts. Another popular botanical, vitex agnuscastus, comesfrom the berries of the chaste tree, once believed to inhibit sexual desire.Tinctures and tablets of this plant have traditionally been used to regulatemenstrual periods as well as to relieve breast tenderness. In addition to itsrole in premenstrual symptoms, chaste tree is widely recommended to reduceuncomfortable symptoms in menopause, although scientific research in this realmis limited.Although not as well known in the West, Ayurvedic herbs have a long history insupport of a woman’s physiology. Shatavari, or Indian asparagus, is the primaryAyurvedic female tonic used in India during both reproductive and postmenopausalyears. There is some evidence that shatavari reduces uterine irritability, whichmay account for its reported benefit in premenstrual syndrome. From an energeticstandpoint, most Ayurvedic women’s herbs have cooling, soothing effects and arebelieved to pacify accumulated heat that causes the irritability of premenstrualsyndrome (PMS) and the hot flashes associated with menopause. The juice of thealoe vera plant is another traditional Ayurvedic female tonic. Considered acooling blood purifier, it is commonly used to alleviate the symptoms of PMS andmenopause. Although there is considerable scientific research on itswound-healing value, aloe vera’s impact on women’s health has not yet beeninvestigated by Western medicine.In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), dong quai has been used for thousands ofyears in the support of women’s health, treating symptoms from menstrualcramping to menopausal hot flashes. Reports from China have highlighted theantioxidant and phytoestrogenic properties of dong quai, but a recent study fromCalifornia failed to confirm a measurable estrogenic effect in menopausalwomen.5 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts5] Further research will benecessary to see if scientific explanations for the traditional claims ofwomen’s tonics can be uncovered.HERBS TO BALANCE METABOLISMObesity, with its many potential medical complications, is a serious problem inthe Western world. More than one-third of Americans are overweight, asubstantial increase from just ten years ago. It is natural that someone tryingto lose weight would hope that a simple substance could make the processeffortless. Unfortunately, this magical commodity has not yet been discovered.Balanced nutrition and regular physical activity remain the cornerstones of aneffective weight-loss program.Herbs with stimulant properties have been used to reduce the appetite andincrease the metabolism. The Chinese herb ma huang, which contains the chemicalephedrine, can cause elevated blood pressure, rapid heart rate, and anxiety.When used in a carefully controlled fashion, ephedrine can be helpful intreating the symptoms of allergies and asthma, but the use of this chemical,either naturally or synthetically derived, is not warranted for weight loss. AnIndian herb, Garcinia cambogia, the source of a chemical hydroxycitric acid, hasbeen suggested to be an effective weight loss agent. However, the onlyplacebo-controlled study to look at this herbal agent failed to confirm itsefficacy.6 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts6]Since we are unlikely to discover an herb that magically suppresses the appetiteor melts away fat, how can we use herbs in support of healthy metabolism? Froman Ayurvedic perspective, weight gain represents a Kapha or Earth imbalance.Herbs that create lightness and heat help reduce excessive accumulation of bodymass. In Ayurveda, there is a classical formula that includes three herbs toenhance the first phase of digestion, three to enhance tissue metabolism, threeto foster elimination, and one to clear the blood.Trikatu means “the three pungent spices.” They have a heating effect on thesystem and enhance appetite and the digestive process. Although people withweight problems often perceive their appetite as a devouring enemy, being intune with your appetite is the best way to ensure that you eat when you need toand stop when you don’t. The three heating herbs that make up Trimada are notwell known in the West and have not been rigorously researched. They shareheating properties and are traditionally considered to help metabolize storedfat. Triphala has been discussed previously as a bowel tonic to encouragebalanced elimination. Guggulu, derived from the resin of a plant that is acousin to myrrh, has been shown to effectively lower cholesterol andtriglyceride levels.Ayurvedic Metabolism FormulaHerbs to Enhance DigestionTRIKATU(black pepper, long pepper, dry ginger)———Herbs to Enhance Tissue MetabolismTRIMADA(chitrak, vidanga, musta)———Herbs to Foster EliminationTRIPHALA(amalaki, bibhitaki, haritaki)———Blood-Clearing HerbgugguluIf you are trying to lose weight, our recommendation is to use herbs and spicesto create meals that are delicious and balanced in the six tastes. This willensure that you are not overeating because you are craving a taste, even thoughyou have had enough food volume. Use herbs to kindle your digestive fire,enhance your metabolism, and encourage regular elimination. Practice consciouseating techniques and strive to fulfill your emotional needs with loving,nurturing relationships rather than with food. Herbs can be valuable allies in aweight-loss program, but cannot substitute for healthy eating, regular exercise,and love.HERBS TO ENHANCE MEN’S HEALTHSexual potency and concerns about prostate gland function are the two majorareas in which herbal medicines have been promoted for the benefit of men’shealth. Throughout the ages, men have sought a magic elixir to maintain orregain the potency of youth. In Ayurveda we have a category of herbs known asvajikarana, which are characterized in an understated manner as “producing along lineage of progeny, providing quick sexual stimulation, enabling one toperform sexually with women uninterruptedly and vigorously like a horse, makingone charming for women, promoting corpulence, and infallible and indestructiblesemen even in older persons, rendering one great, having a number of offspringlike a sacred tree, branched profusely and commanding respect and popularity insociety.”7 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts7]Herbs such as amalaki and ashwagandha are reputed to provide these potentqualities. Like ginseng in China and Korea, these Ayurvedic herbs have powerfulreputations that have thus far been difficult to characterize scientifically.Amalaki has potent antioxidant qualities, as does ashwagandha, but it is unclearhow these properties influence male potency. Of interest is a recent Koreanstudy of ginseng that suggests this ancient herb may work through a nitric oxidepathway, similar to the mechanism by which the recently fashionable Viagraworks.8 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts8] Studies are in progressaround the world in attempts to characterize the efficacy and means of action ofthese traditional herbal medicines.Yohimbine is a minor herbal medicine used to treat difficulties with erection.Derived from the bark of an African tree, Pausinystalia yohimbe, this chemicalblocks the effects of nerves that constrict blood vessels. Although severalstudies have shown yohimbine to be mildly to moderately effective, it can causeanxiety, sweating, and nausea and should therefore be used with caution.HERBS FOR THE PROSTATEEnlargement of the prostate is one of the most common health concerns of men. Byage fifty, almost half of all men will have microscopic evidence of benignprostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and by age eighty, almost 90 percent will showchanges. A swollen prostate can cause difficulties with urination in many ways:it can make it difficult to start urinating, create problems with completeemptying, make it necessary to get up several times during the night, andpredispose to bladder infections. Up to 25 percent of men may eventually requiresome form of surgery to help improve urinary flow. A number of new medicines areeffective in treating the symptoms of BPH, but their side effects and expenseare sometimes limiting. Herbal alternatives may play a cost-effective role inmild prostate enlargement, but every man should have an evaluation from aqualified physician before starting an herbal remedy to be certain that thesymptoms are due to benign prostate enlargement and not prostate cancer.The documented benefits of saw palmetto berry have transformed this NativeAmerican plant from a weed to a cash crop. A number of studies have confirmedits value in reducing the symptoms of prostate enlargement without serious sideeffects.9 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts9] A lesser-known botanicalmedicine, Pygeum africanum, has also been shown to have measurable benefit onthe symptoms of BPH, with improvement seen in both subjective and objectiveaspects of urination.Ayurveda offers a number of substances to improve urinary flow in men.Purnanarva, gokshura, and shilajit each have a long history of usage, but nonehave been scientifically researched for the treatment of BPH. Studies onshilajit have demonstrated anti-inflammatory activity, but whether this has anyimpact on the prostate is uncertain. Used to alleviate painful urination, thesesubstances have mild diuretic effects. In view of their long-establishedtraditional usage, they deserve formal scientific study.HERBS TO ALLEVIATE PAIN, ARTHRITIS, AND INFLAMMATIONAs long as human beings have been in motion, they have experiencedmusculoskeletal aches and discomforts. Consequently, traditional healing systemsaround the world have sought and identified botanical substances to relievepain. Our most potent narcotic pain relievers are derived from the juice of thepoppy, a plant well known to the ancient Sumerians over five thousand years ago.The bark of the willow tree is the original source of salicylates, the basis ofaspirin. Although a multitude of effective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatorymedicines are available today, natural alternatives continue to gain inpopularity.Glucosamine and chondroitin sulfates are widely used in degenerative arthritis.Although they are not herbal products, they are mentioned here because they arecurrently among the most commonly used “natural” arthritis medicines.Controversy as to their efficacy abounds, but recent reviews have suggested thatthey do reduce pain and may slow or stabilize joint deterioration.10[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts10]Massaging the skin with herbalized oils has been used to reduce tissue pain forthousands of years. Oil from the winter-green shrub, menthol from mint, camphorfrom the camphor tree, and capsaicin cream from chili peppers are rubbed over asore joint or muscle to increase blood supply and reduce pain. Capsaicin, whichdepletes nerve endings of the neurotransmitter known as substance P, reduces thetransmission of painful impulses. It has been useful in painful conditionsranging from diabetes to osteoarthritis.Internally, many common herbs and spices have measurable anti-inflammatoryeffects, although their clinical relevance remains to be fully defined.Turmeric, basil, rosemary, thyme, and chamomile are a few of the many culinaryherbs and spices that can cool inflammation.Frankincense and myrrh, gifts of the Three Wise Men to the Christ Child, areclosely related to two Ayurvedic herbs used in the treatment of arthritis. Anextract of Boswellia serrata, a close cousin to frankincense, has shownanti-inflammatory activity in both animals and people. Guggulu, the resin fromCommiphora mukul, is in the same family as myrrh (Commiphora molmol). A numberof recent studies attest to the long-standing reputation of guggulu as aneffective anti-inflammatory agent.11[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts11]Finally, feverfew, an herb used for over two thousand years to treat headaches,is effective in the treatment of migraines and arthritis. Phytochemicals in thisdaisylike plant inhibit inflammation and muscle spasm. New users of feverfewshould be cautious, as allergic reactions to this herbal medicine are not rare.Herbs can be helpful in reducing the discomfort of chronic discomforts, but itis important to remember that pain is a symptom of some underlying dysfunctionor imbalance. If a part of your body continues to call for attention, pleasehave a competent health-care provider evaluate your symptoms to be certain thatyou are not ignoring an underlying illness that requires more-specifictreatment.HERBS TO ENHANCE IMMUNITYLike animals, plants face challenges from their environment. Bacteria, viruses,and fungi seek the energy and nutrition that plants capture, just as animals do,and plants have evolved sophisticated defense mechanisms to protect themselvesfrom hostile creatures. We may gain some immunologic advantage by eating certainherbs, perhaps because the same chemicals that protect the plants frommicroorganisms may support our immune system. Many Native American, Ayurvedic,and Chinese herbal medicines have been used traditionally to strengthenimmunity. Laboratory and animal studies have confirmed that many plants have aninfluence on the immune system. Research documenting the value of thesebotanical medicines in humans is relatively scarce, but suggestive of measurablebenefit.The most popular immune-enhancing herb in the West is echinacea. Although it isnot directly toxic to germs, echinacea does enhance several aspects of theimmune system. Native to North America, both the flowers and roots of thispurple coneflower have therapeutic value ranging from treating the common coldto healing wounds. Echinacea is often combined with another Native Americanherb, goldenseal. Although there has not been any convincing support ofgoldenseal as having immune-enhancing effects, it contains a chemical calledberberine that has antibacterial activity.The Chinese herb astragalus has been used for thousands of years to enhanceresistance to infection. Studies over the past several years have confirmed itsability to enliven components of the immune system.12[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts12] The most effective way to useboth echinacea and astragalus is uncertain. Although some herbalists recommendtaking echinacea throughout the cold and flu season, there is some evidence tosuggest that its potency wanes after a couple of weeks. Therefore it shouldprobably be taken at the first sign of a viral illness and continued for a weekto ten days.Ayurveda has its own offering of herbs that enliven immunity. Ashwagandha isamong the most popular Ayurvedic herbs that have been shown to influence theimmune system. In several studies, it seems to reduce the toxic effect of cancerchemotherapy drugs on the bone marrow. At least part of its effect is probablydue to its antioxidant activity.Another little-known Ayurvedic herb that has shown promising immune-enhancingproperties is guduchi, also known as amrit (Sanskrit for immortality). This herbhas demonstrated the ability to stimulate both antibody production and cellularimmunity in animals.13 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts13] Amalakiand shatavari are other Indian herbs traditionally used to nourish the subtlesubstance of immunity known as ojas. According to Ayurveda, when ojas isabundant and circulating, cells and tissues function optimally and in support ofthe whole physiology. Depletion of ojas makes us vulnerable to internal andexternal challenges. As with most Ayurvedic herbs, there has been little formalscientific research to date on these revered plants, but interest is growing toexplore their possible clinical benefits.HERBS FOR DETOXIFICATIONOther than poisoning by industrial or environmental toxins, the concept oftoxicity is generally rejected by Western medicine, while the idea that we storetoxins in our body that can interfere with normal physiological functions is acommon principle of natural healing systems. From an Ayurvedic perspective,accumulated toxins, known as ama, result from poor eating habits, exposure toalcohol and drugs, and environmental pollutants. Imbalancing life stresses canalso result in toxic accumulations, manifesting as fatigue, weakened appetite,and susceptibility to infection. Many people today who are labeled with thediagnosis of chronic fatigue or systemic candidiasis are considered by Ayurvedato have ama accumulations.Perhaps a bridge between the long-standing natural healing systems and modernmedical science is the recognition that free radical molecules can damagehealthy tissues, leading to an accumulation of chemicals that interfere withnormal cellular function. Smoking, high-fat diets, environmental toxins,radiation, and potent chemicals can increase the production of free radicals,accelerating the development of illnesses ranging from Alzheimer’s disease tocancer, from arthritis to heart disease.Many of the herbs traditionally used to detoxify the body contain antioxidantcomponents and phytochemicals that help the body neutralize damaging freeradical molecules. Allspice, clove, oregano, pepper, rosemary, sage, andturmeric have all been shown to possess potent antioxidant abilities. Herbs andspices were used in ancient times to reduce food spoilage. Today we are learningthat they help protect our cells from damaging reactive molecules.Among the most important detoxifying Ayurvedic herbs is ginger. One of itsSanskrit names is vishwabhesaj, which is translated as “universal medicine.”From an Ayurvedic perspective, ginger enhances all phases of digestion and helpsto reduce the accumulation of ama. From a scientific viewpoint, ginger hasantioxidant properties and can reduce nausea and enhance digestive enzymes.Another important Ayurvedic detoxifier is aloe vera juice. It also is rich inantioxidants and is useful for a variety of chronic disorders includinginflammatory conditions and liver problems.A lesser-known detoxifying herb is neem, traditionally used to treat fevers andinflammation. It can enhance immunity and is highly regarded in India for itsantiseptic and purifying properties. Neem is protective against yeast andbacterial infections and has been used in the treatment of malaria. It caninduce abortions and should not be used by pregnant women.Several herbs have been gaining attention for their possible protective role inconditions of liver damage. Kutki, phyllanthus, and silybum are traditionalbotanical medicines that have been shown to reduce liver damage as a result ofinjury by drug or infection.14 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts14]From a natural medicine perspective, they support the liver in its detoxifyingrole.HERBS FOR REJUVENATION AND ENERGYHerbal tonics and elixirs have been components of healing systems around theworld for thousands of years. As people grow older, it is understandable thatthey seek out substances that promise to restore vitality and slow the agingprocess. Of course, if such a magic potion were reliable, we would have it inour water supply and there would be scant need for cosmetic surgeons.As we discussed earlier, there is a growing recognition of the role of freeradicals in the aging process. Biological molecules damaged by these reactivesubstances accumulate in cells and eventually interfere with normal functioning.Enhancing our ability to neutralize free radicals before they wreak their havocis the basis of new treatments for several degenerative conditions includingParkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s, heart disease, and multiple sclerosis.We may learn that traditional herbal “tonics” provide value through theirspecial chemical properties. The fruit of amalaki is one botanical substancethat may deserve its reputation as a rejuvenative. It has been shown to be oneof the richest sources of vitamin C available on earth. Studies in animals offormulas containing amalaki have suggested that it may confer protection againstboth heart disease and cancer.15 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts15]Ashwagandha, from the Ayurvedic tradition, and ginseng, from the traditionalChinese and Korean medical systems, are two herbs that play similar roles. Bothare reputed to enhance energy and vitality, and are important rejuvenatives. Thelore about these substances goes further, promising the recovery of the potencyof youth. Is there a way to assess scientifically the claims of these almostmythical substances?If we look at the idea of a rejuvenative from a modern perspective, what wouldwe want it to accomplish? Simply speaking, we would like the herb to neutralizethe damaging and degenerative effects of stress on mind and body. The Russianscoined the term adaptogen to describe this protective effect. When animals aresubjected to threatening situations, they respond with rises in stress hormonesand weakness in the immune system. An adaptogen blunts the response of harmfuleffects of stress, and both ginseng and ashwagandha have shown someeffectiveness in this regard. Whether this blunting of the stress response isdue to antioxidant properties or some other effects is still to be defined. Whatis clear is that these tonic herbs have been around a long time and are likelyto grow in popularity as our society ages.In addition to tonic herbs, both traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Ayurvedaemphasize the tonic value of specific foods. In TCM, rice, walnuts, and grapesare considered to be rejuvenating. In Ayurveda, milk, honey, almonds, andclarified butter are viewed as having specific tonic properties. In bothAyurveda and TCM, tonic foods are not recommended until after one has undergonea detoxification program. As more westerners embrace these principles, it willbe interesting to see how we are able to integrate the concepts ofdetoxification and purification with our Western molecular medical model. Ifscientists take these ideas seriously enough to approach them with an open mind,we are certain that new discoveries of the healing value of natural substanceswill unfold.HERBS TO ENHANCE CIRCULATIONAlthough the modern description of the circulatory system is generally creditedto William Harvey in 1628, an understanding of the channels of circulationcarrying energy and vital fluids to the tissues of the body was known to ancientChinese and Indian physicians. Ancient healers also recognized that blockages tocirculatory flow resulted in illness and death. Herbal medicines to improvecirculation have been explored around the world, and many of them have beenessential in the development of modern medicines. Digitalis, the heartstimulant, is derived from foxglove, an important cardiac tonic prized by theancient Egyptians, and the blood pressure medicine called reserpine is anextract of snakeroot, well known to Ayurvedic doctors since antiquity. Becauseof the wide natural variation in the potency of these botanical medicines, thestandardization of pharmacologically derived drugs was a major advance in thesafe use of these powerful substances.Circulatory herbs that are less potent and less risky can be grouped into threemain categories: those that reduce fats in the blood, those that have a thinningeffect on the blood, and those that have a tonic effect on the heart. Garlic andguggulu fall into the first category. Although many earlier reports suggestedthat garlic had a modest fat-lowering effect, a recent study has cast somedoubts on this property.16 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts16]Guggulu, the resin from a small native Indian tree, has consistently shownitself as a safe and effective lipid-lowering herb.The tendency for blood to stagnate or clot contributes to the risk ofcardiovascular attacks. Low daily doses of aspirin have been shown to reduce therisk of heart attacks and strokes. A variety of herbs and spices have been shownto affect platelets, the tiny blood components that initiate the clottingprocess. Turmeric, cumin, feverfew, and onions all keep platelets from stickingtogether too easily, although their clinical effectiveness remains to bedefined. Although garlic’s role in lowering blood lipids may be controversial,its effect on platelets is generally well accepted.Circulatory tonics have a supportive effect on the heart. In the West, hawthornhas been used since the Middle Ages. It increases blood supply to the heart,inhibits the development of atherosclerosis, strengthens heart contractions, andmildly lowers blood pressure. These combined effects improve the quality of lifein people with heart disease.17 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts17]The Ayurvedic equivalent of hawthorn is arjuna, the bark of a tree that has beenused in India for over three thousand years. Studies have suggested that thisancient heart tonic can reduce cholesterol levels, improve the strength of heartcontractions, and lower the frequency of chest pain episodes.18[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts18] Although these herbal hearttonics may offer new approaches to the treatment of our society’s most commonserious illness, we strongly recommend that you consult with your physicianbefore using them.HONOR HERBS AND BE SMARTHerbs are nature’s gifts. Used appropriately and respectfully, they can serve asvaluable tools on the path toward regaining and maintaining your health. As withany tool, a medicinal herb can be useful in some circumstances, but not in all.Learning to use plant-based medicines in the right context and with the rightintention is vital to tapping into their healing power.If you are facing a serious illness, engage your physician in an open discussionof your needs. If you do not feel you can honestly explore your interest innatural healing approaches with your doctor, seek out a health-care provider whosupports your role as an active partner in your healing journey. If you aretaking medication for a problem, do not abruptly discontinue it without theguidance of your doctor. If you are on medication and wish to start an herbalremedy, discuss it with your health-care provider to be certain that there arenot potentially dangerous interactions between the medicine and the herb.19[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts19]Used responsibly, plant-based medicines are important and valuable healing aids,but they are neither a substitute for necessary medication nor good nutrition.If we are to see the return of herbal medicines to their rightful place in ourmodern healing inventory, we need to use them judiciously.

After a brief introduction to the herb, we review thescientific research that has been published on the plant or its derivedcomponents. We share with many of our readers an aversion to unnecessary animaltesting; still, we have chosen to reference all published sources that providecredible information that can help us advance the cause of natural choices inhealth care. To the spirits of the creatures that have been sacrificed in thename of science, we offer our deepest gratitude.Following the scientific review is a description of the practical uses of theherb, which draws upon both ancient and modern healing systems. The traditionaluses of an herbal product may be different from the popular applications, whichare often based upon scientific findings. We feel most confident when there isalignment between the traditional and scientifically supported uses.Next, we address the currently available forms of the herbal medicine in themarketplace, including usual dosing recommendations. Several studies have foundthat not every herbal product delivers on what it is advertised to be. In lieuof regulations and enforcement of herbal product quality, you must take theresponsibility for ensuring that you are receiving high-quality herbs. Researchthe manufacturer, and favor those lines that produce a standardized product. Alist of the constituents in our Chopra Center Herbal Formulary product line isprovided in the appendix.Each herb is then analyzed from an Ayurvedic perspective. Two-thirds of theherbs we explore in detail are traditional Ayurvedic medicines, with theremainder representing botanical substances derived from Native American,European, Chinese, and Australian herbal systems. Even if the herb was notoriginally known in India, we analyze it according to basic Ayurvedicprinciples, which elaborate its effects on the primary mind-body elements.Finally, we address any potentially negative effects related to use of the herb.Precautions or known adverse side effects are reviewed. As a general principle,we do not encourage the use of herbal medicines in conjunction withpharmaceutical drugs unless you are under the guidance of a health-care providerwho can help you navigate safely in both worlds. Similarly, because so littleresearch has been done in this area, we recommend that you do not take medicinalherbs while pregnant or nursing a baby.At the end of each description is a table that includes the ten basicphysiological systems that may be influenced by the herb under discussion.On this page [Simo_9780307829108_epub_col2_r1.htm#page56]–this page[Simo_9780307829108_epub_col2_r1.htm#page57] is a chart that covers each of theforty herbs, listed in alphabetical order according to their Latin names andshowing their primary uses.

Itspenetrating fragrance heralds its potent medicinal qualities, which have beenidentified and prized around the world. In Ayurveda it is considered arejuvenative that nourishes all the tissue layers. A native to central Asia,garlic was well known to the ancient Chinese, Greeks, Romans, and Egyptians. Theslaves who built the Great Pyramid were fed garlic to improve their endurance.In 1858, Louis Pasteur, the great French scientist who developed the process ofpasteurizing milk, was the first westerner to document garlic’s anti-infectiveproperties, known to herbalists for thousands of years. Its has a long-standingreputation as a healing ally in cardiovascular disease and cancer. Thousands ofscientific studies have been published on this complex botanical substance thatcontains almost two hundred different chemical components, most of which havenot been carefully researched. Other than its strong odor, which unabashedlyannounces the presence of its aficionados, garlic has a very high safety profileas both food and medicine.BOTANICAL AND PHYTOCHEMICAL INFORMATIONThe characteristic fragrance of garlic is not released until the clove is brokenand the odorless substance alliin makes contact with the enzyme allinase tocreate the familiar-smelling compound allicin. Allicin is not a stable compoundand is further broken down by stomach acid and heat into a number of othersulfur-containing chemicals. Although most medical research has focused onallicin, these other components of garlic may also play importanthealth-promoting roles. In addition to its chemical constituents, garlic is agood source of vitamins and trace minerals, including selenium. Although garlichas the greater reputation as a healing herb, onions also have similarsulfur-containing substances that may provide comparable benefits.THE SCIENCE OF GARLICGarlic has been promoted as a natural protector against heart disease. Itspotential benefits derive from its effects on blood lipids, clotting factors,and blood pressure. Several reports in the mid-nineties suggested that garlicwas capable of lowering cholesterol levels by about 10 percent.1[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col3-nts1], 2[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col3-nts2] More closely controlledsubsequent studies produced inconsistent results, with some demonstratingdefinite benefit while others showed no value.3[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col3-nts3], 4[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col3-nts4] For example, a recent report inthe Journal of the American Medical Association did not find any lowering ofhigh cholesterol levels in people who took steam-distilled garlic oil.5[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col3-nts5] One of the challenges in makingsense of these contradictory findings is that different forms of garlic are usedin each study. In some reports, less than 10 percent of commercial garlicpreparations contain even measurable allicin levels. Until we know what forms ofgarlic are most effective, we recommend you simply add garlic to your diet andenjoy the flavor, knowing that it may also be helping to lower your cholesterollevel.Garlic has other potential benefits on the cardiovascular system other than itspossible role on fats in the blood. It inhibits the stickiness of platelets,reducing the tendency for blood vessels to clot.6[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col3-nts6] Garlic also seems to keep bloodvessels from becoming stiff, which may explain its ability to lower bloodpressure.7 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col3-nts7], 8[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col3-nts8] Although each property of garlicneeds further documentation, its combined effects support the addition of thisrich and complex herb to the diet of anyone who is concerned about heartdisease.Does the deodorized form provide equivalent benefits? Thus far, it is not clearwhat, if anything, is lost when the powerful-smelling allicin is neutralized.Enteric-coated forms may diminish the smell of garlic on your breath and skinwithout losing the therapeutic benefits.Garlic’s role in the prevention and treatment of cancer has receivedconsiderable attention. Studies in animals have shown that garlic reduces therisk of chemically caused tumors and can treat certain types of cancer in dosesthat are proportionate to what humans can get in their diet.9[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col3-nts9], 10[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col3-nts10] Garlic added to human coloncancer cells grown in a laboratory is also effective in inhibiting theirgrowth.11 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col3-nts11] Studies in people haveshown that a diet rich in garlic may provide protection against stomach andbreast cancer, although further research is needed to see how meaningful thiseffect is.12 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col3-nts12], 13[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col3-nts13]Garlic’s role as an anti-infective agent is receiving renewed interest. It hasbeen known for years to diminish the growth of viruses, bacteria, and fungi.Recent studies have suggested that garlic oil may help treat disease-producingagents ranging from athletes foot to Pneumocystis carinii, a serious infectioncommonly seen in AIDS patients.14[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col3-nts14], 15[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col3-nts15] One of the most practicaltherapeutic applications of garlic may be its role in the treatment ofHelicobacter pylori, a bacteria that has been associated with stomach ulcers andstomach cancer.16 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col3-nts16] The usualtreatment for this infection involves several expensive medications. If furtherstudies confirm its efficacy, garlic may be a cost-effective treatment for thiscommon condition.THE PRACTICAL USE OF GARLICThe repertoire of illnesses to which garlic has traditionally been applied isvast. Garlic has a reputation as an effective treatment for lung congestion,arthritic stiffness and pain, and to calm people with hysteria. It has been usedto promote normal menstruation in woman and to improve libido in men. Appliedexternally, garlic oil is used as a liniment for sore muscles and to hasten thehealing of festering sores. In addition to its role in heart disease and cancer,garlic is a natural pharmacy unto itself that can keep medical scientists busyfor many years researching its potential therapeutic uses.We use garlic as a grounding rejuvenative for people who have a predominance ofmental turbulence. For those with mildly elevated cholesterol or high bloodpressure, a daily clove of garlic added to sautéed vegetables or pasta sauce mayreduce the need for medication. For people with recurrent peptic ulcers, it maybe worth a trial of a couple of cloves of garlic per day before starting theprolonged antibiotic therapy that is usually required to eliminate theinfectious agent associated with ulcers. For stubborn skin infections, applyfreshly squeezed garlic oil directly to the area three times a day for a week.For people who cannot tolerate the strong smell of garlic or wish to avoid itfor other reasons, leeks can provide similar but less odoriferous benefits.HOW TO USE GARLICGarlic is available in many different forms, including capsules, tablets, andpowders. It can be deodorized or enteric-coated. Although the precise chemicalsand dosage that deliver garlic’s benefits are still being defined, a daily cloveof raw garlic is probably your safest bet that you are consuming adequatequantities of allicin. If you are taking a processed garlic product, try to findone that delivers a daily allicin dose of 4 to 5 milligrams (4,000 to 5,000micrograms).AYURVEDA AND GARLICAyurveda has long recognized the healing potency of garlic, which carries fiveof the six tastes, missing only sour. It is balancing to Vata and Kapha, but hasa moderately heating influence that may aggravate Pitta. You may read inAyurvedic books that garlic is to be used sparingly by those engaged inspiritual practices because it has a dulling effect on the mind. Others suggestthat it stimulates sexual passion and therefore is distracting for those on aspiritual path. If you are a monk or a nun, you may want to reduce your garlicuse. For anyone else, a little garlic may help enhance your health andwell-being.PRECAUTIONSPrecautions with garlic follow its therapeutic effects. If you are onblood-pressure medications and begin taking regular doses of garlic, be certainto monitor your pressures so you are not overtreating your hypertension. Becauseof garlic’s potential blood-thinning properties, be cautious taking garlic ifyou are on blood-thinning medicines.[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_009_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_010_r1.jpg]ALOE VERAFAMILIAR: aloe veraLATIN: Aloe veraSANSKRIT: kumariAloe vera has been honored as a healing plant for thousands of years around theworld. The ancient Mesopotamians, Egyptians, and Greeks knew of the therapeuticbenefit of this hardy succulent. In Ayurveda, aloe is known as kumari, which,alluding to its recuperative properties, can be translated as “the vitality ofyouth.” There are several hundred species of aloe plants, of which aloe vera isbest known for its medicinal qualities. Native to southern and eastern Africa,aloe is now cultivated throughout the Mediterranean, India, the Caribbean, andAustralia. Thriving easily as an indoor potted plant, families on almost everycontinent keep aloe close at hand to treat minor burns and abrasions.Although aloe is best known as a topical treatment for injuries to the skin, italso has potent therapeutic effects when taken internally. It has an establishedrole in Chinese medicine, where it is used to clear excessive heat from theliver. It plays a similar detoxifying role in Ayurveda, Tibetan medicine, andother traditional healing cultures across the globe.BOTANICAL AND PHYTOCHEMICAL INFORMATIONThe fleshy leaves of aloe vera are easily recognized by their spiny margins.Individual leaves may be up to a foot and a half long, and each plant may havemore than two dozen leaves. The aloe vera plant can be easily propagated byseparating a small cluster of leaves that have rooted and replanting them inloose soil.An aloe vera leaf has three layers, including an outer thick skin, an innerlining, and a central pulp of gel-containing cells. A very bitter, dark yellowjuice is obtained from the inner lining, which contains several anthraquinonechemicals that have a strong laxative effect. The gel of the leaf is usedtopically and internally for its antibiotic and wound healing properties. Aloevera juice, readily available in health-food stores, is essentially the geldiluted with water.Many other chemical compounds are found in aloe, including glycosides, steroids,vitamins, and minerals. One chemical constituent of aloe, called acemannan, hasbeen shown to activate immune function, interrupt viral replication, and reduceinflammation.THE SCIENCE OF ALOE VERAAloe vera is best known and most widely studied for its ability to promote woundhealing. Serious scientific interest in aloe dates back to the mid 1930s, whenit was reported to relieve the smoldering skin inflammation in a woman who hadradiation damage to her forehead.1[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col4-nts1] Within a day of applying freshaloe gel, her symptoms improved, and within five months her skin irritationhealed fully. Subsequent reports have suggested that the therapeutic effect ofaloe may be related to its ability to stimulate the turnover of collagen in theskin, facilitating faster wound repair.2[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col4-nts2]Acting as an inhibitor of prostaglandin chemicals, aloe has potentanti-inflammatory effects when used both orally and topically.3[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col4-nts3] In addition to its ability tocool inflammation, aloe has antibiotic activity against both bacteria and fungi.The combination of these properties contributes to its efficacy in enhancingrecovery from burn injuries. A recent report found that patients on a burn unittreated with aloe gel healed in less than two-thirds of the time of those whosewounds were treated in the customary manner.4[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col4-nts4] Aloe cream has been usedsuccessfully in the treatment of psoriasis, with more than 80 percent ofpatients in a Swedish study reporting substantial benefit.5[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col4-nts5] The widespread benefits of aloein the treatment of tissue injury were demonstrated in a study on frostbite inwhich aloe showed an ability to limit permanent damage and speed recovery.6[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col4-nts6]Aloe may have value in the prevention and treatment of cancer, although thisapplication is in the preliminary stages of investigation.7[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col4-nts7] Potentially valuable uses foraloe vera include its role in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease andchronic fatigue syndrome. The anti-inflammatory properties of acemannan, acomponent of aloe vera, may pacify the autoimmune process that damages thedigestive tract in ulcerative colitis.8[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col4-nts8] Aloe vera may also play a part ina holistic approach to the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome, a common anddebilitating illness for which modern medicine has few effective interventions.9[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col4-nts9]Aloe vera’s role in the digestive tract has been studied for many years. Aloin,the chemical component responsible for aloe’s laxative effect, was identified inthe mid-1800s. In small amounts it helps tone the intestines, but becomescathartic at higher doses. Although it can be helpful in constipation, it has anirritating effect on the bowel and is not recommended for regular usage. Thesoothing inner gel contains chemical components that are effective in reducingstomach acid and treating peptic ulcers.10[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col4-nts10]THE PRACTICAL USE OF ALOE VERAMany traditional properties ascribed to aloe have not yet received scientificattention. In both Chinese and Ayurvedic medicine, aloe is used to help smoothmenstrual-cycle concerns, including premenstrual mood swings, bloating, andbreast tenderness. It is also reported helpful in reducing the hot flashes ofmenopause. Aloe has been recommended in the treatment of other hormonalimbalances, including hyperthyroidism and pituitary conditions.We use aloe vera juice liberally at the Chopra Center. It is a standardcomponent of our detoxification program, in which we encourage people to consumehalf an ounce of juice twice daily. For people with inflammatory imbalances suchas hepatitis, heartburn, skin rashes, emotional irritability, and inflammatoryarthritis, we encourage people to take one to two ounces of aloe vera juicethree times a day. For teenagers with acne, two ounces of aloe juice mixed intofour ounces of carrot juice can help reduce their aggravated skin.Topically, we routinely recommend aloe gel for stubborn skin irritations. Thecombination of turmeric powder mixed with aloe and applied directly to insectbites, burns, or acne sores can facilitate rapid healing. Blended with driedlavender flowers, cumin, and comfrey, aloe gel makes a nice facial mask thatreplenishes dry skin and improves tone.We rarely use aloe vera powder for its laxative effect. Other herbal cathartics,including senna and cascara sagrada, are equally effective and do not cause asmuch cramping as aloe.HOW TO USE ALOE VERAAloe vera juice is readily available at health-food stores. We recommend purealoe vera without other herbal additives. The usual dosage is one-half to twoounces, mixed in apple or cranberry juice, two to three times per day. Freshaloe gel can be obtained by splitting a leaf with a knife and scraping the gel.We caution against taking homemade gel internally, as it is not always easy toseparate the bitter cathartic component from the inner soothing gel.AYURVEDA AND ALOE VERAAccording to Ayurveda, aloe is a complex herb that has bitter, sweet, andpungent flavors with an overall cooling influence on the physiology. Used tocleanse the liver of excessive Pitta while toning digestive power, it is agentle yet powerful detoxifying substance that is balancing to all three doshas.It is commonly mixed with other substances such as cranberry or pomegranatejuice to enhance its purifying properties. Aloe vera juice mixed with raw sugaris used as a general rejuvenative tonic for women transitioning through theirmenopause.PRECAUTIONSPowdered aloe vera obtained from the inner lining of the leaf is stronglylaxative and can create bowel laziness. Aloe vera juice derived from the gel isgenerally safe in usual doses. We do not recommend its internal use duringpregnancy.[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_011_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_012_r1.jpg]ANDROGRAPHIS PANICULATAFAMILIAR: Indian gentian, king of bittersLATIN: Andrographis paniculataSANSKRIT: kirata, kalmegha, bhunimb, mahatiktaThousands of years ago, the Kiratas, a small tribe of people living in theforests of the Himalayan Mountains, utilized a bitter herb to treat fevers. Theearliest Ayurvedic sages named this plant kirata tikta, meaning the bitter herbof the Kirata people. It was used for the treatment of a wide range ofinfectious diseases and to clear excessive heat from the liver. During theiroccupation of India, the British military and administrative forces used thisplant, which they called Indian gentian, to treat malaria. Modern scientificstudies have confirmed the detoxifying and anti-infectious properties of thisancient remedy.BOTANICAL AND PHYTOCHEMICAL INFORMATIONIndian gentian is an annual tropical shrub that grows wild throughout the plainsof India. It has characteristic four-sided stalks giving rise to three-inch-longpointed leaves. Delicate pink to purplish flowers arise on thin stems andproduce small encapsulated fruits containing six to twelve flattened seeds. Theentire plant is used medicinally.A variety of terpenes and flavonoids have been identified in kirata, includingseveral unique compounds called andrographolides. These chemicals appear to beresponsible for many of the immunological and circulatory actions of Indiangentian, although some studies have reported that the whole-leaf extract hasprotective effects on the liver that is not fully accounted for by theandrographolide component.1 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col5-nts1]THE SCIENCE OF INDIAN GENTIANScientific research on Indian gentian has focused on its immune-enhancing andcirculatory activity. It has received a lot of attention since the recentpublication of a Swedish study that reported a significant benefit of kirata inreducing the symptoms of the common cold.2[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col5-nts2] Compared with those taking aplacebo, people given Indian gentian showed a faster recovery from the cold,less severe symptoms, and less time missed from work. Earlier studies from Asiaand Latin America suggested similar benefits.Laboratory studies on Indian gentian have demonstrated a variety ofpharmacological effects. Mice given extracts of kirata show enhancement of theirimmune systems, with more aggressive antibody production and cellularresponsivity.3 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col5-nts3] Although Indiangentian does not appear to have a direct antibacterial effect, it may conferprotection from a wide range of infections including malaria, parasites, andretroviruses.4 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col5-nts4]–7[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col5-nts7] People with tonsillitisexperience more rapid relief of their fever and sore throat, and patients whoundergo treatment for kidney stones have fewer urinary tract infections.8[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col5-nts8], 9[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col5-nts9] Early clinical trials inHIV-infected men have suggested that an Indian gentian extract may lead tomodest improvements in immune function.10[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col5-nts10] Although these findings arelimited, they do provide the impetus for further scientific study into theimmune-enhancing potential of Indian gentian.Another potentially important role for Indian gentian is in the treatment ofheart disease. Studies in animals have shown it to have a wide range ofphysiological effects that may benefit people with coronary heart problems.Indian gentian has blood-pressure-lowering and heart-rate-slowing effects, bothof which can reduce the strain on oxygen-deficient heart muscle.11[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col5-nts11] In studies of animals with heartattacks, Indian gentian reduces the damage to heart tissue and the frequency oflife-threatening irregularities in the heart rhythm.12[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col5-nts12] Several reports in both animalsand people have confirmed kirata’s ability to reduce the stickiness ofplatelets, which has the effect of reducing undesirable blood vessel clotting.13[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col5-nts13], 14[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col5-nts14] A study in China tested thecombined benefit of these different properties in dogs fed a high-cholesteroldiet.15 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col5-nts15] After their severelyobstructed blood vessels were opened by angioplasty, those who were given Indiangentian had much milder reblockage despite continuing a high-fat diet. Suchfindings warrant further studies to see if these benefits are applicable topeople with heart disease.Kirata has traditionally been used to protect the liver, and several studieshave provided scientific support for this role. Animals given Indian gentianalong with chemicals known to be toxic to the liver have much less liverdamage.16 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col5-nts16], 17[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col5-nts17] In one study, Indian gentian wasmore effective than silymarin (milk thistle) in protecting the liver.18[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col5-nts18] In addition to an antioxidanteffect, kirata stimulates the flow of bile, which could be helpful in theprevention of bile stones.19 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col5-nts19] Inview of its long history in Ayurveda and encouraging laboratory studies, Indiangentian is deserving of further research to see what role it may play in theprevention and treatment of liver disease.THE PRACTICAL USE OF INDIAN GENTIANIndian gentian is just beginning to be noticed in the West, despite its use forover a decade in Scandinavian countries. In addition to its importance in theAyurvedic herbal pharmacy, it is valued by Chinese medicine, where it is knownas chuan xin lian. It is not yet readily available as a single herb, but is acomponent of many immune-enhancing formulas.For the treatment of viral upper respiratory symptoms, it usually is taken atthe earliest sign of symptoms and continued for one week. As an aid in adetoxification program, it should be taken at most for two weeks, unless aknowledgeable health-care provider prescribes it and is monitoring you.Preliminary studies in HIV-infected patients reported positive laboratoryfindings within six weeks of beginning the herb.20[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col5-nts20] If you are going to use it forthis condition, be sure to work closely with your health-care adviser so thatyou can carefully monitor your viral counts and immune function.HOW TO USE INDIAN GENTIANWhen treating the symptoms of a cold or flu, the dose used in published studiesis 340 milligrams three times daily for five days. The available products in theWest usually are standardized to 10 percent andrographolides. About the samedosage was used initially in the HIV studies (5 milligrams per kilogram of bodyweight three times daily) and was then increased (10 to 20 mg/kg) during thecourse of six weeks. Indian gentian is also available in herbal extractsrecommended for sore throats and colds.AYURVEDA AND INDIAN GENTIANIndian gentian is very bitter in taste and has a drying, cooling influence onthe physiology. It is pacifying to Pitta and Kapha, but can be aggravating toVata. It is traditionally used in conditions of Pitta aggravation in which aperson has excessive heat congestion attributed to accumulated liver toxicity.PRECAUTIONSIndian gentian has a detoxifying effect and can be depleting if used for aprolonged time. Animal studies have suggested that kirata has anti-fertilityproperties in both males and females.20[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col5-nts20] Although this effect has notbeen reported in people, those trying to get pregnant are best to avoid it. Itis also contraindicated in pregnancy.[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_013_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_014_r1.jpg]ASPARAGUS RACEMOSUSFAMILIAR: wild asparagusLATIN: Asparagus racemosusSANSKRIT: shatavariShatavari is one of the prime rejuvenating herbal medicines in Ayurveda. It isconsidered particularly helpful in conditions affecting the female reproductivesystem. One of its names means “having one hundred roots,” which bespeaks itsreputation as a fertility-enhancing plant.A member of the same family as the common asparagus, shatavari has nutritiveproperties. Commonly used in India to improve the production of breast milk innursing mothers, it is even fed to cows to enhance their milk output. It is alsoeffective in relieving inflammatory conditions and in soothing irritatedtissues.BOTANICAL AND PHYTOCHEMICAL INFORMATIONShatavari’s native home is in the lowland jungles of India. The asparagus plantis a natural climber that is commonly cultivated in Indian gardens. It producessmall, white, fragrant flowers and red berries, but it is the roots andsucculent tubers that are used as both food and medicine.Active saponins, which are chemically extracted from shatavari using alcohol orether, have the effect of suppressing uterine contractions. Water extracts ofshatavari have been shown to reduce the growth of various microorganisms.THE SCIENCE OF SHATAVARIThere has been relatively little scientific research into shatavari, despite itslong-standing reputation as a valuable tonic. Studies in the 1960s explored itsrole as a milk promoter in animals.1[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col6-nts1], 2[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col6-nts2] Although preliminary studiessuggested that it could increase breast milk production in buffalo and rats, arecent controlled investigation in lactating women did not find any differencebetween those consuming shatavari and those taking a placebo.3[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col6-nts3]Its traditional role as a digestive aid has received some scientific support. Inmen with a history of heartburn and indigestion after meals, shatavari was foundto be as effective as metoclopramide, a pharmaceutical agent commonly used totreat nausea.4 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col6-nts4] Although it hasnot been formally studied, shatavari also has an established history as ananti-diarrhea agent.The immune-modulating properties of shatavari have received the most scientificattention. Shatavari has a measurable effect on the functioning of macrophages.These important immune cells are responsible for digesting potentially harmfulorganisms as well as cancer cells. Studies on shatavari have shown that it canenhance the ability of macrophages to do their job against the fungus candida.5[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col6-nts5] Shatavari helps the immune systemrecover more quickly after it has been exposed to toxic chemicals, both byenhancing the production of natural immune-regulating messenger molecules and byprotecting blood-producing cells in the bone marrow.6[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col6-nts6], 7[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col6-nts7] Shatavari’s various effects onthe immune system have been shown to reduce the development of scar tissue aftersurgery in animals.8 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col6-nts8] All of theseproperties may have important clinical applications in people, but more researchis needed to determine whether the laboratory findings are relevant to humans.THE PRACTICAL USE OF SHATAVARIShatavari is described in Ayurveda as having a nourishing, smoothing, cooling,lubricating influence on the physiology. As such, it is used in conditions whenthe body and mind are overheated, depleted, or out of balance. It is commonlyrecommended for women who are having menstrual problems, particularly whenirritability and mood swings are prominent. Its cooling influence may alsobenefit the hot flashes of women going through menopause. Shatavari isbeneficial in cooling off an irritated digestive system as expressed byheartburn, diarrhea, or irritable bowel syndrome. It can also be helpful tosoothe irritation in the urinary tract.Its nutritive properties are invaluable in people recovering from illness,particularly when there has been substantial weight loss. Shatavari has areputation as an enhancer of fertility. It is said to increase the health ofboth male and female reproductive tissue.HOW TO USE SHATAVARIShatavari is now available in the United States in both powdered and capsuleforms. When used to treat digestive distress, one teaspoon in one-half cup ofwarm milk is taken after each meal. It mixes well with equal parts of amalakiand licorice for symptoms of heartburn or indigestion. For symptoms of PMS ormenopausal hot flashes, 500-milligram capsules can be used in doses up to 2grams per day.A teaspoon of powdered shatavari mixed with brown sugar and organic milk can beadded to the diet several times per day in anyone recovering from a debilitatingillness or surgery. Taken in cool water, shatavari can be used to treat theirritation associated with nonspecific urethritis or interstitial cystitis, twoconditions that modern medicine treats with difficulty.AYURVEDA AND SHATAVARIShatavari is sweet and bitter in taste. It is balancing to Pitta and Vata, andin excess can mildly increase Kapha. It is one of the primary rasayanas of valuefor both men and women.PRECAUTIONSAlthough it is traditionally recommended for lactating mothers, we have not comeacross any studies that have evaluated its safety. It is closely related to thecommon asparagus, and we would not anticipate serious health concerns arisingfrom its use by breastfeeding mothers. Its rich qualities can occasionallyaggravate sinus congestion in people with Kapha tendencies.[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_015_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_016_r1.jpg]ASTRAGALUS MEMBRANECEUSFAMILIAR: astragalus, milk vetch, yellow vetchLATIN: Astragalus membraneceusCHINESE: huang qiAstragalus membraneceus, one of the most important tonics in traditional Chinesemedicine, is just beginning to gain popularity in the West. Often considered thecounterpart of ginseng, astragalus has long been used in Asia to enhance vitalenergy and strengthen the defensive forces of the body. Recent scientificstudies have documented profound immune-enhancing properties of astragalus thatmay be of therapeutic value in the treatment of illnesses ranging from cancer toautoimmune diseases.BOTANICAL AND PHYTOCHEMICAL INFORMATIONThe Astragalus genus of plants includes almost 2,500 hundred species, making itthe largest on earth. Astragalus is a member of the legume or pea family, but itis the roots that are the source of the prized herbal medicine. A perennialplant that grows to a height of about one and one-half feet, astragalus isnative to eastern China and Mongolia. The dense bushy leaves composed of a dozenpaired leaflets give rise to purple pea-like flowers. The roots of plantsseveral years old are harvested, dried, and made into powders and tinctures.A number of chemical constituents have been identified in astragalus roots,including polysaccharides, triterpenoids, isoflavones, choline, and saponins.Several unique compounds called astragalosides have been isolated. The chemicalsresponsible for the various pharmacological actions of astragalus have not beenfully characterized; however, the polysaccharides and saponins are the mostlikely candidates for its immune-modulating properties.THE SCIENCE OF ASTRAGALUSDozens of studies in both animals and people have demonstrated dramatic effectsof astragalus on the immune system. Different experiments have tested theprotective effect of astragalus on the immune system by giving animals animmune-suppressing drug or radiation. In many studies the administration ofastragalus partially or completely reversed the effects of the toxicintervention on the bone marrow and lymph system.1[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col7-nts1], 2[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col7-nts2] Other studies have shown thatastragalus can stimulate immune cells to respond to a variety of challenges moreaggressively, resulting in a slowing of cancer cell growth and viralreplication.3 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col7-nts3], 4[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col7-nts4]One of the nasty secrets of cancer cells is their ability to secrete chemicalsthat have the effect of sedating immune cells. This immune depression reducesthe ability of the body to identify and eliminate malignant cells. Laboratorystudies have shown that taking suppressed immune cells and incubating them withastragalus helps substantially to restore their potency.5[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col7-nts5], 6[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col7-nts6]Modern cancer researchers are increasingly looking to nature for ways to fightthis dreaded disease. A developing class of medicines known as biologicalresponse modifiers makes use of the natural disease fighting chemicals of thebody. One of these substances, interleukin-2 (IL-2) has been shown to be apowerful weapon in certain types of cancer. Unfortunately, it also has powerfulside effects, limiting the amount that can be safely tolerated by cancerpatients. A laboratory study from Texas found that astragalus potentiated thetumor-cell-killing effect of IL-2, allowing for lower doses to be used without aloss of efficacy.7 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col7-nts7] If this can beshown to be applicable to people, astragalus could play a valuable role infuture cancer treatment protocols.The clinical application of these laboratory findings has been tested in a groupof patients with lung cancer who received astragalus along with standardradiation and chemotherapy. Those receiving the immune-enhancing herb hadsignificantly improved rates of survival, even in patients with more-advancedstages of illness.8 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col7-nts8] The potentialof astragalus to improve the outcome of people with cancer is worthy of furtherexploration.Astragalus may provide value in the treatment of other health concerns. Patientswith the autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are susceptibleto infections, despite their aggravated immune state. A study from China foundthat their immune cells were usually unable to respond normally to challenges,but the addition of astragalus could improve their function.9[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col7-nts9] Astragalus has also been reportedto enhance immunity in people suffering with viral infections of the heart, arare but potentially disabling condition.10[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col7-nts10]The role of astragalus on other heart conditions has received attention, withseveral reports suggesting it can improve function and reduce the symptoms ofpeople with coronary heart disease. Heart patients given astragalus have shownfewer episodes of anginal chest pain, improvement in their EKGs, and healthiercardiac function.11 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col7-nts11], 12[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col7-nts12] A laboratory study reported thatastragalus improved the utilization of oxygen by heart cells.13[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col7-nts13] The investigation of astragalusin the treatment of heart disease, the most common serious health problem of oursociety, is a worthy scientific pursuit. Preliminary reports of the benefit ofastragalus on memory, infertility, and protection from liver damage highlightthe diverse potential benefits of this ancient healing herb.14[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col7-nts14]–16[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col7-nts16]THE PRACTICAL USE OF ASTRAGALUSAs a rejuvenative, astragalus can be valuable for people who do not have theenergy they desire. It is particularly useful for those who feel theircirculation is weak because they frequently have cold hands and feet.As an immune-enhancing agent it seems to have a sustained benefit, unlikeechinacea, which tends to lose its efficacy after a couple of weeks. If you arefacing a serious health challenge such as cancer, discuss the use of astragalusas an immune tonic with your doctor. It can also be used at the onset of a coldor flu to boost your body’s defenses.Its role in heart disease is less clearly defined, although reports havesuggested it can be valuable in both acute and chronic cardiac conditions. Ifyou are under treatment for a heart ailment, be sure to discuss the use ofastragalus or any other medicinal substance with your health-care providerbefore adding it to your regimen.HOW TO USE ASTRAGALUSAstragalus is now readily available through health-food stores. It is usuallyfound in capsules of 400 to 500 milligrams of the dried root. Extracts andtinctures are also available, in which astragalus is usually combined with tonicChinese herbs. Tea bags containing astragalus are coming to the health-foodmarket.For general immune enhancement, take 2 to 4 grams daily in divided doses. If youcan find dried astragalus root at an Asian food or herb store, simmer a heapingtablespoon for ten minutes, strain, and drink a cup two or three times per day.AYURVEDA AND ASTRAGALUSNot described by the original sages, astragalus can be understood in Ayurvedicterms. The root is predominantly sweet in taste with a warming potency.Astragalus is a valuable rejuvenative for all doshas and is particularlybalancing for Vata. In excess, it can mildly increase Kapha and Pitta.PRECAUTIONSAstragalus has a long safety record. We have not encountered any accounts fromthe traditional or scientific literature of adverse reactions attributed to it.Theoretically, its immune-enhancing effect could be aggravating to autoimmuneconditions, although none have been reported.[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_017_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_018_r1.jpg]AZADIRACHTA INDICAFAMILIAR: neem, margosa, Persian lilacLATIN: Azadirachta indicaSANSKRIT: nimba, arishtaThe neem tree, native to India, is revered as its own botanical pharmacy,providing leaves, seed oil, and bark with a wide range of healing benefits. Thisbeautiful evergreen tree is highly resistant to insects and infections, whichalerted ancient healers to its diseaseresistant properties. Traditionally, neemwas taken internally as a blood purifier and detoxifying agent in patients withchronic fevers and infections. Ayurvedic medicine considers neem to beespecially effective as a medicated oil for the treatment of skin infections,inflammatory skin conditions, joint pain, and muscle aches. In rural areas ofIndia, twigs of the neem tree are used as toothbrushes to strengthen the gumsand prevent gingivitis.BOTANICAL AND PHYTOCHEMICAL INFORMATIONChemical analysis of neem flowers, leaves, seeds, and bark have identified avariety of bitter substances, some of which are unique to this tree. Nimbin andazadirachtin have been identified as bitter components of neem tree bark andseeds that may confer disease resistance. Antifungal, antibacterial, andantimalarial activity have been documented for extracts derived from neem leavesand seeds. Neem is also widely used as a component of nontoxic insecticides andhas been the recent subject of international controversy as Western pesticidecompanies seek patents for effective chemical compounds identified in neem.THE SCIENCE OF NEEMNeem has traditionally been used to treat infections, diabetes, obesity,anxiety, and pain. It is also reputed to protect the liver against toxicinjuries caused by drugs or viruses. Modern studies have suggested that many ofthe properties traditionally attributed to neem can be scientifically validated.Extracts of neem have been shown to inhibit bacterial, fungal, and parasiticinfections.1 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col8-nts1], 2[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col8-nts2] In addition to a direct effect onpotentially harmful organisms, neem also enhances several aspects of immunefunction.3 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col8-nts3] A recent report fromthe UCLA School of Dentistry found that neem could reduce the ability ofstreptococcal bacteria to colonize the surface of teeth, providing anexplanation for neem’s long-standing reputation as a cavity fighter.4[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col8-nts4] A neem and turmeric paste appliedto the scalp is very effective for the treatment of scabies, a common andcontagious skin infection caused by a tiny mite.5[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col8-nts5] In tropical countries, neem’santibiotic properties are applied for the treatment of malaria and to curtailmosquito growth.Neem has been shown to have measurable anti-inflammatory actions, anti-anxietyeffects, and significant pain relieving properties.6[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col8-nts6], 7[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col8-nts7], 8[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col8-nts8] A potentially important clinicalbenefit of neem is its ability to reduce the incidence of stomach ulcers inresponse to stress by blunting the release of inflammatory chemicals.9[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col8-nts9] Although its efficacy in humanbeings is yet to be fully documented, neem has been shown to lower blood sugarlevels in animals, giving support to one of its traditional roles as ananti-diabetes herb.10 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col8-nts10]Neem has been shown to have contraceptive and abortifacient effects in animalstudies, which may eventually have practical applications in people.11[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col8-nts11], 12[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col8-nts12] Because of these properties,neem products should not be taken by women who are or may be pregnant.THE PRACTICAL USE OF NEEMWe prescribe neem when we believe a person needs gentle detoxification. Peoplewho have been overeating, abusing drugs or alcohol, or who have recently takensteroids, antibiotics, or cancer chemotherapy drugs benefit from the cleansingeffect of neem. People attempting to lose weight and those facing Type IIdiabetes mellitus may also be helped by the toxin-reducing properties of neem.Externally, neem is useful for inflammatory skin lesions such as allergicdermatitis or eczema. It can also be directly applied to acne skin lesions. Ifsomeone appears to have toxic accumulations but is quite debilitated, we useneem cautiously, as it has a depleting effect on tissues.HOW TO USE NEEMNeem leaves are available in Indian and Middle Eastern food stores, where theyare sold as a culinary spice. Neem leaves added to soups, casseroles, orvegetable dishes add a pleasant bitter flavor and serve to reduce toxicaccumulations. Neem powder and neem oil are available at most health-foodstores. If you are using neem as a detoxifying agent, take one-half teaspoon injuice or water three times daily for one week. If you are using neem topicallyfor a skin infection, make a paste with neem powder and apply it twice daily.For dry, irritated skin, apply medicated neem oil twice daily until the areaclears.Neem trees are now readily available from farms where they can be grown inclimates where it does not freeze, such as Florida or Southern California.Whether you are able to pick the leaves off your tree or obtain them from anIndian market, try steeping them in hot water, then spraying the infusion onfruit or vegetable plants to limit insect and fungal infestations. Neem leaveshave been used for centuries to protect clothing and papers from mold andmildew. According to Ayurveda, neem should be included in everyone’s homepharmacy.AYURVEDA AND NEEMFrom an Ayurvedic perspective, neem is bitter, drying, and cold, making it auseful medicinal herb in conditions that are hot and damp. It can be helpful inKapha and Pitta conditions, but may exacerbate Vata problems. Its drying andpurifying qualities contribute to neem’s role in inflammatory and toxic states.Neem’s detoxifying properties also explain its value in problems of retentionand excess, such as diabetes and obesity.PRECAUTIONSDue to its contraceptive and possible abortion-promoting properties, neem shouldbe avoided in woman of childbearing years who are pregnant or may want to becomepregnant. It should also be used cautiously in people who are severely depletedfrom chronic illness or poor nutrition.[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_019_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_020_r1.jpg]BOSWELLIA SERRATAFAMILIAR: boswellia, Indian olibanum, salai guggalLATIN: Boswellia serrataSANSKRIT: shallaki, kunduruBoswellia is also known as Indian frankincense, one of several plants in afamily of resinous trees famous for their aromatic oils. Prized from NorthAfrica to India, frankincense, along with myrrh and gold, was among the originalofferings to the Christ Child. Referenced in the earliest Ayurvedic texts,boswellia was traditionally used to treat respiratory ailments, disorders of thedigestive system, and joint diseases. Pharmacological studies performed in thelate 1960s and early 1970s identified unique pain-relieving, sedating, andanti-inflammatory properties in extracts of boswellia. Clinical studies are nowconfirming many of the traditional uses for boswellia, including the treatmentof asthma, arthritis, and inflammatory bowel diseases.BOTANICAL AND PHYTOCHEMICAL INFORMATIONMany closely related trees yield the fragrant resin known as frankincense.Boswellia trees are native to North Africa and the Middle East, but it is onlyin the dry, mountainous forests of western and central India that Boswelliaserrata can be found. The tree, which can grow slowly to eighteen feet inheight, has a thick, papery bark that yields a gummy exudate when peeled away orcut.The gum contains a variety of natural sugars, volatile essential oils, andterpenoids. Several unique triterpene acids, identified in the terpenoidcomponent, have been named boswellic acids and appear to account for boswellia’smedicinal properties. Animal studies on the alcoholic extract of the gum havedemonstrated potent anti-inflammatory actions by inhibiting the production ofprostaglandins.1 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col9-nts1]THE SCIENCE OF BOSWELLIAProstaglandin chemicals play an important role in many different physiologicalfunctions. They are essential in the regulation of the digestive, respiratory,and urinary tracts. They also play a pivotal role in the clotting system and arethe fundamental chemical messengers in an inflammatory response. Boswellia hasbeen shown to inhibit an important enzyme in the formation of inflammatoryprostaglandins, known as 5-lipoxygenase.2[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col9-nts2], 3[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col9-nts3] The blocking of this enzymereduces the production of chemicals called leukotrienes, which provoke andperpetuate inflammation.4 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col9-nts4], 5[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col9-nts5]Excessive production of leukotrienes has been implicated in a variety of immunedisorders including asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, and ulcerative colitis.Boswellia has been shown to provide potential therapeutic benefits in each ofthese health conditions. In a recent paper from Germany, 70 percent of patientswith bronchial asthma who received boswellia showed improvement in theirbreathing, compared with only 27 percent of those given a placebo.6[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col9-nts6] The benefits were apparentclinically as well as through breathing and blood studies.Boswellia has classically been used in the treatment of joint pain andinflammation. Animal studies have shown boswellia to reduce the deterioration ofjoint sugars and proteins required for healthy function.7[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col9-nts7] People taking boswellia alongwith ashwagandha, turmeric, and zinc for degenerative osteoarthritis reportedless joint pain, better movement, and improved strength without any serious sideeffects.8 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col9-nts8] Although case reportshave suggested that boswellia is also beneficial in rheumatoid arthritis, arecent German report did not find any difference between those taking the herband those on a placebo, although over half of the patients did not complete thestudy.9 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col9-nts9]Leukotrienes have been implicated in the smoldering inflammation associated withulcerative colitis, an inflammatory bowel disorder that affects about one in onethousand people. A study from India that compared the use of boswellia with thestandard drug treatment for ulcerative colitis found that 82 percent of patientstaking the herb went into remission, compared with 75 percent on themedication.10 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col9-nts10] A wide range ofmeasurements improved, including the frequency of bowel movements and themicroscopic findings on biopsies.Although these studies in people are limited, it is encouraging that thisapparently safe and inexpensive herb can provide such a wide range of potentialbenefits. It may be very rewarding for medical research to explore the potentialvalue of boswellia in the many inflammatory conditions that afflict people.THE PRACTICAL USE OF BOSWELLIAFrom an Ayurvedic perspective, boswellia is useful in the treatment of anexpansive variety of health concerns. It is said to have stimulating properties,can help mobilize phlegm in respiratory conditions, and treats digestivedisturbances, from heartburn to diarrhea. It is part of several Ayurvedicobesity formulas, in which it is said to enhance metabolic activity. As a paste,boswellia can be applied directly to skin irritations ranging from diabeticulcers to acne. As a cream or poultice applied to joints, it can reduce the painof arthritis and injury.Boswellia can normalize menstrual irregularities and treat liver ailments. Ithas been used traditionally to treat both syphilis and gonorrhea. As amouthwash, it can treat bad breath due to gum disease. If there is a commontheme to the traditional role of boswellia, it is its purported efficacy inconditions of excessive inflammation.HOW TO USE BOSWELLIABoswellia is now widely available in the West from a variety of herbalcompanies. Most doses are standardized to contain between 37.5 and 65 percentboswellic acids, yielding 150 to 200 milligrams per tablet or capsule. Check theinformation on the bottle to determine whether the dosing is in terms of theherb compound or the boswellic acid extract. For example, a 300-milligram tabletstandardized to yield 65 percent boswellic acids will provide 195 milligrams ofboswellic acids. Studies have used daily doses between 450 milligrams (150milligrams three times a day) and 1,200 milligrams (400 milligrams three times aday).Boswellia is also available as a component of a topical cream, combined withcapsaicin and salycilates. This can be applied to sore muscles and aching jointsseveral times daily.AYURVEDA AND BOSWELLIAAccording to Ayurveda, boswellia carries the astringent, bitter, and sweettastes. It has a cooling effect on the physiology. It is most pacifying to Pittaand can also reduce Kapha. It is mildly aggravating to Vata in high doses.PRECAUTIONSUnlike most anti-inflammatory medications, boswellia is not reported to causestomach ulcers or gastritis. People rarely report mild nausea, diarrhea, or askin rash.[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_021_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_022_r1.jpg]CAMELLIA SINENSISFAMILIAR: teaLATIN: Camellia sinensis, Thea sinensisSANSKRIT/HINDI: chaiOther than water, tea is consumed by more people than any other beverage onearth. Tea has been a part of the human diet for close to five thousand years,since its discovery by the legendary Chinese emperor Shen Nong. The story goesthat he stopped with his entourage for refreshment, and while his cook wasboiling water, the leaves of a nearby bush blew into the water, resulting in thefirst herbal infusion of what we now call tea.This invigorating herb from China spread to Japan and India, then across Europeand Russia. Arriving in the New World in the late seventeenth century, teabecame the symbol of the struggle between independence-minded colonists andtheir British oppressors, sparking the revolution that birthed the UnitedStates. Tea has always had the tendency to arouse passions.Although prized for its astringent taste and refreshing energy boost, tea hasalso been long valued for its medicinal properties. It has been used to settlethe digestive system, treat infections, soothe pain, and overcome fatigue.Recent scientific studies have documented tea’s health-promoting effects inconditions ranging from dental cavities to cancer.BOTANICAL AND PHYTOCHEMICAL INFORMATIONThe bush from which we obtain tea leaves can grow wild to thirty feet in height,but the cultivated evergreen plants are usually trimmed to stand below six feet.The finer teas use only the two young top leaves and bud. Green tea leaves arepicked and allowed to wither in the hot air, then panfried to stop thefermentation process. Oolong tea is derived from leaves that are shaken andbruised and allowed to partially oxidize until the edges of the leaves turn red.Black teas are allowed to ferment in cool, humid rooms until the entire leafdarkens. These different processes alter both the flavor and chemical content ofthe teas.Tea leaves contain many compounds including flavonoids, polysaccharides, andvarious vitamins, but it is the polyphenols that seem to be the most potenttherapeutic phytochemicals. Originally known as tea tannins, polyphenols make upabout one-quarter of fresh dried green tea leaves. The polyphenols in tea areknown as catechins, and include gallocatechin, epigallocatechin, epicatechin,epicatechin gallate, and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). These catechins arepotent antioxidants and appear to play a role in protecting the body from cancerand cardiovascular diseases. The EGCG polyphenol component comprises almostsixty percent of the total catechins present in tea and seems to have thegreatest health promoting impact. The darker the tea, the lower the content ofantioxidizing polyphenols available in the leaves.THE SCIENCE OF TEAOne cup of tea has the antioxidant activity of ten glasses of apple juice orthree glasses of orange juice.1 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col10-nts1]A group from the National Institute of Nutrition in Italy found that theantioxidant capacity of green tea is six times that of black tea.2[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col10-nts2] Interestingly, when humansubjects took their tea with milk, the antioxidant effect of both the green andblack varieties was reduced.Laboratory studies on tea or tea components have shown potential benefits in thesuppression of cancer growth. In mice given carcinogenic chemicals, tea improvedtheir immune cells’ ability to identify and eliminate potentially malignantcells.3 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col10-nts3] In laboratory culturesof tumor cells, green tea extracts showed potent inhibition of cancer cellgrowth.4 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col10-nts4] Both green and blacktea have been found to inhibit DNA reproduction and promote the demise of tumorcells.5 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col10-nts5]Studies looking at the relationship between tea drinkers and cancer in peoplehave generally suggested a protective effect from tea. Japanese women whoregularly drank tea before developing breast cancer had significantly reducedrecurrences and improved outcomes.6[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col10-nts6] The incidence of prostate cancerin Chinese men is the lowest in the world and correlated with their tea intake,suggests that green tea may confer some protection against this commonmalignancy in men.7 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col10-nts7] The risk ofcolon cancer may be slightly reduced in green tea drinkers, while the risk oflung cancer may be slightly elevated in black tea drinkers who also smoke.8[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col10-nts8] Overall, the polyphenols presentin green tea seem to have a cancer-protecting effect, although it is not clearhow long and how much one has to drink to gain the benefit.Tea has also been associated with a reduction in coronary heart disease. Animalstudies have shown that tea has a mild cholesterol-lowering effect, althoughthis has been harder to demonstrate in people.9[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col10-nts9]–11[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col10-nts11] Studies from around the worldhave suggested that tea drinkers have lower blood pressure and fewer coronaryheart attacks, and live longer.12[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col10-nts12]–14[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col10-nts14] Not every report has confirmedthis advantage, raising the possibility that people who take their tea with milkdo not derive the same benefit as those who take their tea alone.15[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col10-nts15]Other therapeutic effects of tea have been reported, including the prevention ofdental cavities, accelerated weight loss in dieters, and reduced digestivesymptoms in people with inflammatory bowel disease.16[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col10-nts16]–18[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col10-nts18] Tea has known antibacterialproperties, which are greater in green tea and lesser in black. This may in partexplain its traditional use in the treatment of infectious dysentery. Inaddition to providing refreshment, this ancient herbal brew has many potentialtherapeutic benefits.THE PRACTICAL USE OF TEAAlthough green tea tablets are now available, the best way to partake of thishelpful herb is to savor a cup of tea. Green tea and oolong are usually consumedalone or with a little sweetener, but not with milk or lemon. The blacker thetea, the greater the tendency to add milk, but this may reduce its medicinalvalue. For a delicious treat, try a cup of masala chai, prepared by mixingcardamom seeds, cloves, fresh ginger, and a black peppercorn with tea and milk.Sweeten to taste for an afternoon pick-me-up.HOW TO USE TEAHigh-quality green, oolong, and black teas are readily available from specialtygrocers, coffee shops, and Asian food stores. Although five to six cups of tea aday are often consumed in China and Japan, one or two cups of green tea willprovide a hefty dose of polyphenols without charging you up with caffeine.Use one cup of boiling water per one teaspoon of loose tea, and steep for fiveminutes before sipping slowly. You can make iced green tea by placing twoteaspoons per cup of cold water and brewing the mixture in a closed jar placedin the refrigerator for a couple of hours. Powdered green tea tablets andcapsules are available in doses equivalent to up to ten cups of tea, but weprefer the more natural infusion.AYURVEDA AND TEATea carries the bitter and astringent tastes, and has a cooling influence on thephysiology. It is balancing to Pitta and Kapha, but can be aggravating to Vata.PRECAUTIONSAdverse reactions to tea are exceedingly rare. Owing to its caffeine content, itcan produce nervousness and insomnia in sensitive individuals. The caffeinecontent differs by the type of tea; green tea (8–36 milligrams) contains lessthan oolong (12–55 milligrams), which has less than black tea (25–110milligrams). By comparison, a cup of coffee has 100 to 160 milligrams, while acan of Diet Coke has 46 milligrams of caffeine. Heavy tea drinkers canexperience caffeine withdrawal headaches if they suddenly discontinue theirintake.Two medical complications of tea drinking have recently been reported. In one, asixty-one-year-old woman developed a low potassium blood level leading toirregularities in her heart rate after drinking two to three liters of oolongtea per day.19 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col10-nts19] In another case,a man taking blood thinners began drinking up to a gallon of green tea on adaily basis. The blood thinning effects of the medication were neutralized,presumably due to the high dose of vitamin K he was receiving from the tea.20[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col10-nts20] These are both extreme examplesbut highlight that even though something is derived from natural sources it cancause problems if used inappropriately. Used in a balanced way, this ancientbeverage can be a health-promoting ally.[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_023_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_024_r1.jpg]CASSIA ANGUSTIFOLIAFAMILIAR: sennaLATIN: Cassia angustifolia, Cassia acutifolia, Cassia sennaSANSKRIT: rajavriksha, markandikaWith several hundred known species of Cassia, traditional medicinal culturesaround the world have recognized the potent laxative effects of senna. Native tonorthern Africa, senna is now grown on most continents and is one of the mostpopular bowel agents in the world. Used appropriately, senna is an effectivebowel stimulant that can get sluggish bowels moving without serious sideeffects. However, if you feel the need to use a laxative on a regular basis,look to your diet for ways to improve your digestive function before resortingto an herbal stimulant.Well known to both Ayurveda and traditional Chinese medicine, senna’straditional therapeutic properties have extended beyond its actions on thedigestive tract. In Ayurveda, senna has been used in the treatment of chronicinflammatory skin disorders, premenstrual symptoms, and high blood pressure. Intraditional Chinese medicine, senna is useful in balancing excessive heat in theliver and as a treatment for cardiovascular disorders.BOTANICAL AND PHYTOCHEMICAL INFORMATIONThe medicinal herb is derived from the dried leaves or pods of this three-foothigh bushy plant. Stems have between five and ten pairs of leaves and smallyellow flowers. The slightly curved pods are harvested in the fall. The powderedpods produce a gentler laxative response than the leaves.The laxative effect of senna is due to its content of anthraquinone chemicals,which stimulate the digestive tract to contract and alter the transport offluids and salts across the intestinal lining. The primary anthraquinonesidentified in senna are named sennoside A and B. These are closely related tosimilar compounds found in castor oil, the latex of aloe vera, rhubarb, andCascara sagrada. Anthraquinones present in herbal products are converted intoactive ingredients by normal bacteria in the colon. Once activated, thesechemicals have complex effects on intestinal cells, resulting in theaccumulation of salts and water in the gut and the stimulation of colonicmovement.1 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col11-nts1]THE SCIENCE OF SENNASenna is a moderately potent herbal laxative that has predictable effects on thedigestive tract. Ingested leaves or pods have minimal effects until they reachthe large intestines, where normal bacteria metabolize the chemical constituentsinto active metabolic products. These activated sennosides, called rhineanthrone and sennidins A and B, interact with colon cells, resulting in therelease of prostaglandins. These prostaglandins, along with calcium, cause waterand salt to be secreted into the colon and stimulate the contraction ofintestinal muscle cells.2 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col11-nts2] Thecombined effects result in more-liquid bowel movements. Constipation can be dueto inadequate dietary bulk and insufficient fluids. At appropriate doses, sennarestores normal consistency to bowel movements by increasing the moisture in thecolon, but when an excessive amount of senna is taken, diarrhea can result.Several studies have found senna to be a cost-effective treatment for chronicconstipation. In studies in elderly patients from both Ireland and Finland,senna significantly improved bowel function with minimal side effects and atlower cost than lactulose, another commonly used bowel agent.3[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col11-nts3], 4[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col11-nts4] Senna has also been found usefulfor patients with constipation resulting from narcotic medication use. Abdominaldiscomfort is common in cancer patients because the opiate pain medicines theyrequire often cause a slowdown in digestive function. Senna has been shown toimprove bowel function in cancer patients on narcotic medication, but crampingmay be a limiting side effect.5 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col11-nts5],6 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col11-nts6]People immobilized by illness or injury often experience sluggish bowelfunction. Studies looking at the value of senna after major surgery andchildbirth have found it to be effective, with only minor adverse effects.7[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col11-nts7], 8[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col11-nts8] Senna has also been shown usefulin preparing patients for surgery, with greater efficacy and fewer side effectsthan other standard bowel agents.9[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col11-nts9]When used intermittently, senna is effective and generally well tolerated. Animportant question is whether or not it is safe to use senna on a consistentbasis. Animal studies have shown that taking senna in doses that induce diarrheawill eventually lead to fluid and salt imbalances, and its effectiveness ininducing bowel movements diminishes.10[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col11-nts10] Animals do not seem tohabituate to senna at the lower doses that stimulate normal-consistency bowelmovements. In fact, some reports have suggested that appropriate doses of sennamay help to “reeducate” the bowels to function more regularly.11[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col11-nts11], 12[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col11-nts12] Although there may not be anyserious complications to using senna on a regular basis, from a holisticperspective we believe that it is preferable to make the necessary diet andlifestyle changes rather than rely on an herbal medicine to sustain a normalphysiological function.Although the bulk of the attention on senna has focused on its obvious digestiveeffects, studies have suggested that senna has other potentially beneficialhealth properties. A study in rats found that a close cousin to sennasignificantly reduced both cholesterol and triglyceride levels without causingany serious negative effects.13 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col11-nts13]Other studies have shown that the anthraquinones in senna are potentantioxidants.14 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col11-nts14] Finally, bothantiviral and antibacterial properties of senna have been demonstrated.15[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col11-nts15], 16[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col11-nts16]THE PRACTICAL USE OF SENNASenna is a component of many digestive herbal products. The most commonlyavailable form of senna is a standardized extract, Sennokot. After ingestingsenna, a bowel movement usually occurs within six to twelve hours. A dose takenat bedtime will therefore usually act by the next morning. Some people are moresensitive to senna than others, so if you are a first-time user, allow enoughtime for it to take effect, or you may find yourself rushing to the bathroom inthe middle of an office meeting.Senna is not recommended for more than one week’s use continuously. If you feelthe need to use senna, first take an honest inventory of your diet andlifestyle. Are you eating enough fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole grains? Areyou getting adequate fluids in your diet? Are you getting enough exercise? Ifyou can answer yes to those questions and are still having difficulty withelimination, try using a bulk-forming digestive aid such as psyllium or flaxseedbefore resorting to a stimulant laxative. If you have experienced a significantchange in your bowel habits for no obvious reason, discuss your situation withyour health-care adviser before embarking on a course of laxatives.HOW TO USE SENNAMost senna preparations are standardized to contain a predictable quantity ofsennosides. In Sennokot, each tablet delivers 8.6 milligrams of sennosides, withthe usual dosage ranging from two to four tablets at a time. Other preparationsusually provide a specific amount of dried senna leaves or pods, ranging from150 to 450 milligrams. Standard doses are more difficult to get in herbal teascontaining senna. If you prefer to use a tea, become familiar with a specificbrand, and steep it a consistent amount of time to ensure a reproducibleresponse.AYURVEDA AND SENNASenna is considered a laxative of moderate potency. With its bitter and coolingeffects on the physiology, it is pacifying to Pitta and Kapha. Used excessively,it can be depleting and aggravating to Vata. According to Ayurveda, thedigestive tract should be prepared before taking senna by eating lightly andincreasing your intake of oily foods such as sesame seeds or ghee (clarifiedbutter). This “oleation” is said to ensure a smoother, more comfortableelimination in response to the herbal laxative.PRECAUTIONSAlthough occasionally taking an herbal laxative is generally safe, there arerisks associated with regular usage. Radiologists have described a pattern oncolon X-rays associated with long-term laxative use called “cathartic colon.” Arecent report showed that this pattern, which consists of dilated portions ofthe large intestines and loss of the usual anatomic complexity, is occasionallyseen in people who chronically use senna, and may reflect damage to the colonand its nerve input.17 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col11-nts17]The possible role of senna use in development of colon cancer has been studiedfor many years, and the general consensus is that there is not an increased riskof cancer, even in chronic users of herbal laxatives.18[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col11-nts18] A benign condition that hasbeen associated with senna is called melanosis coli.19[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col11-nts19] This describes a dark stainingof the lining of the colon that can be seen on internal colonoscopicexamination. Senna stimulates the accumulation of pigment in the colon, whichusually becomes apparent within a year of regular laxative use. If senna isdiscontinued, the pigmentation gradually fades over the course of about a year.Although this condition has been known for over thirty years, it has not beenassociated with any clinical problems.Senna is usually considered to be among the safer laxatives in women who arebreastfeeding, for only a small portion is absorbed and enters thebloodstream.20 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col11-nts20] Studies haveshown that metabolic products of senna do enter the breast milk but at levels ofabout one one-thousandth those of the mother.21[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col11-nts21] The occasional use of sennaprobably causes no measurable harm to the infant, but should raise the questionof what more can be done to normalize digestive function through appropriatediet and lifestyle choices.[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_025_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_026_r1.jpg]CENTELLA ASIATICAFAMILIAR: gotu kolaLATIN: Centella asiaticaSANSKRIT: brahmiGotu kola, also known as Indian pennywort, carries two different Latin names,Centella asiatica and Hydrocotyle asiatica, both referring to the same plant.Its name in Sanskrit, brahmi, means consciousness or wisdom. In India severaldifferent botanical specimens have been named brahmi, for their influence onimproving memory and clarifying thinking. The most widely available form ofbrahmi, gotu kola is one of the most important plants in Ayurveda. It is usedfor a wide spectrum of illnesses ranging from indigestion to dementia. Native toIndia, it can now be found throughout the world including the southern UnitedStates.Described in the original Ayurvedic textbooks several thousand years ago, gotukola was also known to Chinese physicians for its ability to promote longevity.It carries a long-standing reputation as a wound healer and brain enhancer. Gotukola has gained a recent following in the West among students, who believe itcan improve their ability to retain information while preparing forexaminations.Although gotu kola has a long history of enhancing cognitive function, it hasthus far received scarce scientific attention in this area.BOTANICAL AND PHYTOCHEMICAL INFORMATIONGotu kola is a perennial creeping plant with distinctive leaves that look likeopen Japanese fans. It grows throughout India, preferring marshlands, where ithas ready access to fresh water. The trailing herb bears small white flowers andlays down roots along its stems. The leaves, which can be eaten fresh, areharvested throughout the year. Dried aerial parts are used internally and as anexternal poultice.Gotu kola is a chemically complex herb that contains many different componentsincluding alkaloids, glycosides, sterols, and tannins. Unique substancesidentified as brahmoside and brahminoside may account for its calming effect.Other chemical constituents in gotu kola have antibiotic and wound-healingproperties.THE SCIENCE OF GOTU KOLAAlthough gotu kola is best known in India as a mind tonic, most research hascentered on its ability to facilitate the healing of wounds. Creams andointments containing gotu kola extract have been shown to hasten wound healingand improved the strength of the scar that forms.1[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col12-nts1] A component of gotu kolaincreases the synthesis of collagen, enabling wounds to heal faster and better.Taking advantage of these qualities, gotu kola has been used to help heal skinulcers, traumatic injuries, and surgical wounds.Taken internally, gotu kola has been shown effective in reducing leg edema inpeople with chronic venous insufficiency.2[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col12-nts2] It reduces pain, cramping, andswelling without any serious side effects. It may also provide some value inshrinking varicose veins.Gotu kola’s value in a number of other health concerns is just beginning to beexplored scientifically. Reports have suggested that it may be helpful in herpesinfections, cancer, and stomach ulcers, but more research is needed. Despite itsaccepted role in Ayurveda as an herb to enhance mental function, the onlyscientific study to look at this issue was performed over thirty years ago inmentally disabled children.3 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col12-nts3]Researchers reported that those who took gotu kola for twelve weeks had betterattention and concentration ability. Further studies are clearly indicated onthis potentially important property.Another herb that has traditionally been called brahmi has the Latin name Bacopamonniera. It has recently become available in the West, with reports indicatingthat it influences brain neurotransmitter levels and has potent antioxidantactivity.4 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col12-nts4] These effects mayhelp explain its common usage in India to improve memory and treat insomnia andanxiety. An animal study has shown that brahmi significantly enhances bothmemory and performance.5 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col12-nts5]THE PRACTICAL USE OF GOTU KOLAGotu kola is valued for its purifying and balancing influence. We recommend gotukola when people are having difficulty concentrating because of mentalturbulence. The combination of a meditation practice and gotu kola caneffectively reduce anxiety and improve mental clarity. It combines well withchamomile or valerian for a gentle sleep aid.Gotu kola tea is prescribed for headaches, particularly when a person isdetoxifying from alcohol or caffeine. We often prescribe gotu kola as a generalrejuvenative herb for people recovering from illness or surgery. Herbalizedbrahmi oil is applied to the skin to soothe irritations and is taken as nosedrops to calm an agitated mind.HOW TO USE GOTU KOLAAs a tea, steep one teaspoon of dried gotu kola leaves in a cup of boilingwater. Sweetened with honey, it can be sipped before bed to induce a deep,restful sleep. A cup of tea can also be helpful in relieving headache orindigestion from overeating or a poor diet.As a paste for skin conditions, combine one-quarter cup of dried gotu kolaleaves with one-quarter cup of chamomile, and steep in one-half cup of boilingwater for ten minutes. Strain and blend the liquid with cornstarch to make athick paste. Apply lightly for relief of irritated skin. Rinse off the pastewith room-temperature water once it has dried. As an oil for itchy and irritatedskin, boil one-half cup of dried brahmi leaves in two cups of water until thevolume is reduced by half. Remove the leaves and add one cup of almond or sesameoil and slowly boil off the water until you are left with the herbalized oil.This can be used for local skin or muscular concerns as well as for a generalmassage. Dried gotu kola is usually available in one-third- to one-half-gramtablets or capsules. The standard dose is 1 to 2 grams daily to improve memory.AYURVEDA AND GOTU KOLABrahmi has many uses in Ayurveda. In addition to its role in memory, it iscommonly prescribed to reduce fever, treat eczema, and relieve respiratorycongestion. It has a mild laxative and diuretic effect, and plays a traditionalrole as a blood purifier. Taking advantage of its wound-healing properties,women are encouraged to soak in brahmi sitz baths after giving birth, to sootheirritated tissues.Gotu kola is bitter, pungent, and sweet in taste, and cooling to the body. Itcan be useful in balancing all three doshas, but is particularly effective forPitta-aggravated nervous systems.PRECAUTIONSCare must be taken when applying gotu kola topically, as it can occasionallycause an allergic dermatitis. In very high doses it may aggravate rather thanrelieve headaches.[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_027_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_028_r1.jpg]CIMICIFUGA RACEMOSAFAMILIAR: black cohoshLATIN: Cimicifuga racemosaBlack cohosh is a traditional Native American herb that has been employed in thetreatment of women’s health issues for thousands of years. It was calledsquawroot by North American Indians for its reputation in easing the pains ofchildbirth. Although originally a component of the American pharmacopoeia, blackcohosh fell out of favor in the 1930s when a paper disputed its efficacy.1[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col13-nts1] Despite its abandonment byAmerican medical doctors, black cohosh has been accepted by European physiciansfor the past half-century. Over one and a half million German women have safelyused black cohosh, and the German Commission E has approved it for the treatmentof menstrual complaints and menopausal symptoms. After being ignored for oversixty years, black cohosh is again gaining in popularity in the United States.BOTANICAL AND PHYTOCHEMICAL INFORMATIONBlack cohosh, native to the eastern half of North America, can be found fromCanada to Florida. It has elongated, serrated leaves and produces spires withclusters of tiny white flowers. The roots are harvested in the fall from thisperennial shrub that grows to about six feet in height. Black cohosh is nowwidely cultivated in Europe, where its roots are collected and dried.Black cohosh contains a number of glycosides, flavonoids, and terpenes. It alsocontains tannins and salycilates. Although the active constituents have not beenfully characterized, the most popular proprietary form of black cohosh, known asRemifemin, is standardized to contain two milligrams of a chemical,27-deoxyacetein. Some studies have suggested that black cohosh has estrogeniceffects, but the chemicals responsible for its hormonal properties still need tobe identified.THE SCIENCE OF BLACK COHOSHSeveral studies over the past forty years have evaluated the effects of blackcohosh on menopausal symptoms. A German study evaluated the benefits of blackcohosh in over six hundred menopausal women and reported that almost 80 percentnoticed some type of improvement in their symptoms, with very rare sideeffects.2 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col13-nts2] Other studies havefound that black cohosh improves both the physical and psychological symptoms ofwomen going through menopause as soon as one month after starting the herb.3[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col13-nts3], 4[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col13-nts4] A German study in eighty womenfound that those taking black cohosh had less anxiety, fewer hot flashes, andimproved vaginal tissue.5 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col13-nts5] Whencompared with a standard estrogen replacement drug, those taking black cohoshreported better relief of menopausal symptoms without substantial side effects.Another German report found that over 40 percent of women taking hormonereplacement for the treatment of hot flashes were able to reduce or eliminatetheir medication.6 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col13-nts6]The question of how black cohosh relieves menopausal symptoms has not yet beenanswered. It has been suggested that it acts as a phytoestrogen, and in somestudies components have been shown to bind to estrogen receptors and influencethe release of pituitary hormones.7[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col13-nts7] Other reports, however, have notbeen able to show a definite estrogen-like effect on the uterus.8[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col13-nts8] How black cohosh works todecrease the hot flashes and psychological symptoms of menopause is not just anacademic question, for if it does act as a natural estrogen, it is important todetermine the optimal dose, how long it should be taken, and if there are anylong-term side effects.Does black cohosh have any role in the prevention of osteoporosis or heartdisease? Although one study in animals suggested that black cohosh could improvebone density, this property has not been evaluated in women.9[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col13-nts9] From a scientific perspective,we know that black cohosh improves the short-term physical and mental symptomsof menopause, but we do not know its long-term effects. Most reports emphasizeblack cohosh’s safety, particularly in comparison with standard hormonereplacement therapy.10 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col13-nts10]Although black cohosh has other traditional uses, including treatment forpremenstrual syndrome, arthritis, and high blood pressure, the scientific basisof these claims is limited. A study from the 1960s suggested that black cohoshcould dilate blood vessels and lower blood pressure, but there has not beenrecent confirmation of this effect.11[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col13-nts11] Other reports have listed bothanti-inflammatory and blood-sugar-lowering properties of black cohosh, but theclinical application of those laboratory findings remains to be explored.12[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col13-nts12], 13[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col13-nts13]THE PRACTICAL USE OF BLACK COHOSHBlack cohosh is effective in treating the hot flashes associated with menopause.It may also have some value in dampening the emotional ups and downs that areoften associated with the physiological changes of midlife. At this time we donot know if black cohosh provides protection against osteoporosis or heartdisease. If you are taking black cohosh in lieu of estrogen replacement, becertain to get enough calcium in your diet (1,500 milligrams per day) andperform regular weight-bearing and aerobic exercise.Traditionally, black cohosh has been useful in the treatment of a wide range ofwomen’s health concerns. It may help to reduce the congestion, breasttenderness, and irritability associated with the hormonal changes precedingmenstruation. Believed capable of reducing menstrual cramping, black cohosh wasalso recommended during childbirth, where it was used to regulate uterinecontractions. Although this property has not been scientifically verified, blackcohosh should be avoided during pregnancy because of its potential stimulatoryeffects on the uterus.In addition to its role in women’s health, black cohosh has been promoted forthe treatment of joint and muscle pain. Native American healers have used blackcohosh for its anti-inflammatory effects, possibly a result of its aspirin-likesalicylate compounds. Black cohosh has also been traditionally employed in thetreatment of asthma, where its relaxant properties are believed to reduce airwayrestriction. These many traditional healing properties of black cohosh areclearly worthy of further scientific exploration.HOW TO USE BLACK COHOSHBlack cohosh is readily available in health-food stores, in tablets andextracts. Most American herbal companies are following the lead of Europeanbrands, offering tablets standardized to contain 2.5 percent triperteneglycosides. As noted above, the most popular form of black cohosh in Europe,Remifemin, contains a standard 2 milligrams of 27-deoxyacetein. Extracts ofblack cohosh are also increasingly available. The usual dose is two tablets orforty drops of a standardized liquid extract twice daily. Some formulas combineblack cohosh with St. John’s wort to provide greater mood-stabilizing benefit.AYURVEDA AND BLACK COHOSHThe ancient Ayurvedic physicians did not know black cohosh, but it can beanalyzed according to Ayurvedic principles. It carries the bitter and pungenttastes, and has a cooling influence on the physiology. It can balance both Pittaand Kapha, and may aggravate Vata after prolonged use.PRECAUTIONSBlack cohosh has a long history of safety. The German Commission E suggests itmay cause occasional stomach discomfort and does not recommend its use forlonger than six months. Black cohosh is not to be taken during pregnancy.[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_029_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_030_r1.jpg]COLEUS FORSKOHLIIFAMILIAR: forskolin, coleusLATIN: Coleus forskphliiSANSKRIT: pashanbhedi, balakaMembers of the coleus species are familiar as popular colorful houseplants, butthe little-known perennial Coleus forskohlii made pharmacological history whenit was discovered to have unique medicinal properties. Native to the subtropicalzones ofIndia, Nepal, and Thailand, coleus has a long traditional history of benefit inthe treatment of respiratory problems, heart ailments, and skin conditions. Inthe early 1970s we learned that many of the therapeutic effects of coleus resultfrom its content of a unique substance, forskolin. This chemical increases thecellular levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP), one of the most elementary compounds oflife. This compound is intricately involved in our most basic biologicalfunctions, from the regulation of blood pressure to the response of the immunesystem. Since its discovery, over twelve thousand scientific articles haveappeared, investigating the effects of forskolin on cellular physiology. Thismember of the mint family is demonstrating potentially far-reaching clinicalapplications.BOTANICAL AND PHYTOCHEMICAL INFORMATIONThe Coleus forskohlii plant grows on temperate mountain slopes between onethousand and six thousand feet. The small shrub grows to about two feet inheight, with new plants easily propagated by stem cuttings. The paired alternatefragrant leaves are commonly cultivated as a pickling spice in the Gujaratdistrict of India. Flowers, leaves, and stems all contain forskolin, with thetuberous roots and stem base containing the highest concentrations.1[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col14-nts1]A number of diterpenoids have been identified in coleus, of which forskolin hasreceived the most attention. Forskolin activates the enzyme adenylate cyclase,which increases the formation of cAMP.2[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col14-nts2] Increased concentrations of cAMPwithin cells leads to the relaxation of smooth muscles, and diminishes allergicand inflammatory responses.3 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col14-nts3], 4[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col14-nts4] All the clinical effects ofcoleus cannot be fully accounted for by changes in cAMP or the chemicalforskolin, but the other important active plant constituents have not yet beenidentified.THE SCIENCE OF COLEUSForskolin has been most studied in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases andasthma. Animal studies have shown that forskolin can improve the efficiency ofheart muscle contractions and lower blood pressure by relaxing the muscles thatcontrol blood vessel tone.5 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col14-nts5]These effects have been shown to be clinically beneficial in patients withcardiac failure, whose hearts responded to intravenous forskolin by pumping morestrongly without consuming more energy.6[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col14-nts6] Forskolin’s ability to inhibitthe tendency of platelets to clump together could provide additional benefit inreducing coronary blood vessel blockages.7[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col14-nts7] The importance of these findingsin the prevention and treatment of heart disease remains to be fully exploredthrough further research.Forskolin has also been shown to reduce the tendency for the respiratorypassages to go into spasm, making it a potentially useful remedy for asthma.Animal studies have shown forskolin to reduce the allergic response tosubstances that trigger the closing of small airways in the lungs.8[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col14-nts8], 9[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col14-nts9] The applicability of thesefindings to people has been supported in studies that have compared forskolinextract to standard asthma pharmaceuticals. Inhaled doses of forskolin inasthmatic patients improved their breathing function without the usual jitteryside effects associated with asthma medications.10[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col14-nts10]–12[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col14-nts12] The improvement seemed toresult from relaxation of the smooth muscles that regulate the size of theairways. The question that still needs to be answered is whether coleus takenorally has as substantial a benefit as inhaled forskolin in patients withreactive airway disease.Forskolin has been tested in other conditions with promising but, at times,mixed results. Animal studies have shown that forskolin eye drops reduce thepressure in the eyes, suggesting that it may have a role in the treatment ofglaucoma.13 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col14-nts13] This action hasbeen tested in people, with some reports showing a benefit and others not.14[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col14-nts14]–16[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col14-nts16] Taking advantage of its abilityto dilate blood vessels, researchers have tested forskolin in the treatment ofmale impotence and found it potentially useful in both animals and humanswithout significant side effects.17[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col14-nts17]Preliminary studies have suggested that forskolin may also have antidepressantand cancer fighting properties.18[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col14-nts18], 19[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col14-nts19]The diverse potentially therapeutic effects of forskolin reflect its ability toinfluence one of the most basic biochemicals of life, cyclic AMP. Thetraditional healers of India and Nepal recognized forskolin’s value in disordersof circulation, breathing, and digestion. Medical science is just beginning toexplore the full range of therapeutic applications of this unassuming member ofthe mint family.THE PRACTICAL USE OF FORSKOLINMost people will not have access to pharmaceutically pure forskolin that can beinhaled, injected, or applied to the eyes. Standardized powdered extracts fororal consumption are increasingly available, derived from the dried leaves orroots of the Coleus forskohlii plant. The traditional use of Coleus forskohliifor respiratory and circulatory disorders usually involved ingesting a stronginfusion of ground roots and leaves several times per day. A paste of thepowdered herb applied directly to the skin has also been used for eczema andinfections.Before ingesting forskolin for its lung or circulatory effects, discuss its usewith a health-care provider who is familiar with this herb and can closelymonitor your response. Do not mix forskolin with prescribed medications.HOW TO USE FORSKOLINColeus forskohlii products available in the West are usually standardized tocontain between 0.25 percent and 1 percent forskolin. Tablets provide between 1and 5 milligrams per dose. The usual recommended daily intake is 3 to 15milligrams in three divided doses. The effects of forskolin are rapid andshort-acting, so, if you are taking it for a specific health concern, such asmild asthma or elevated blood pressure, you will know within a week whether ornot it is providing benefit for your condition.AYURVEDA AND FORSKOLINThe predominant taste of forskolin is bitter, with a secondary weak astringency.It has a cooling effect on the physiology. This herb is pacifying to Pitta andKapha. It can be mildly aggravating to Vata if used for a prolonged time.PRECAUTIONSNo serious adverse reactions have been reported with forskolin, and animalstudies have suggested that it is well tolerated. Since studies evaluatinginteractions with pharmaceutical agents have not been performed, we do notadvise mixing forskolin with asthma or blood pressure medications unless you areunder the supervision of a knowledgeable health-care adviser.[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_031_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_032_r1.jpg]COMMIPHORA MUKULFAMILIAR: guggulu, gum gugalLATIN: Commiphora mukulSANSKRIT: GugguluGuggulu is one of Ayurveda’s most important purifying herbs. It cleansesunhealthy tissues, increases the white blood cell count, and rejuvenates theskin. Traditionally it has been considered the consummate blood detoxifier,useful in any condition characterized by congestion or stagnation. Derived fromthe resin of a small tree native to India, guggulu is a close relative of myrrh,one of the gifts offered to the baby Jesus by the Three Wise Men.Guggulu was well known to the Ayurvedic sages Charaka and Sushruta. In theoriginal texts from over two thousand years ago, guggulu was recommended toclear the sinuses of congestion, relieve chronic skin disorders, treat obesity,shrink swollen glands, and cool inflamed joints. It is fascinating how medicalscience is now validating many of the traditional uses for this ancient herbalmedicine.BOTANICAL AND PHYTOCHEMICAL INFORMATIONThe guggulu tree grows to about ten feet high in both northern and southernIndia as well as regions of the Middle East. The medicinal substance is ayellowish resin exuded when the inner bark of the tree is injured. The resin isusually harvested in the winter from branches that have dropped their leaves.The resin obtained from guggulu trees contains several different chemicalcompounds that can be extracted with organic solvents. These soluble portionshave documented anti-inflammatory and cholesterol-lowering properties. Mostcurrent herbal formulas of guggulu contain standardized amounts of thecholesterol-lowering constituents, known as guggulsterones. Most studies onguggulu have used a 2.5 percent extract of guggulsterones standardized to a50-milligram dose. This extract is commonly referred to as gugulipid. Otherimportant components of guggulu, including organic acids and sterols, seem topossess anti-inflammatory activity.THE SCIENCE OF GUGGULUScientific research has focused on two main properties of guggulu: its abilityto lower serum cholesterol levels and its anti-inflammatory effect. Sushrutaextolled guggulu’s penetrating properties, used to dissolve the deposition ofama (toxins) in the channels of circulation. The development of atherosclerosis,known as medoroga in Ayurveda, encompassed much of our modern understanding ofthis illness. According to Ayurveda, eating excessively rich foods and notgetting enough exercise leads to an accumulation of fat in the blood thateventually builds up and obstructs the srotas, or channels of circulation.Guggulu helps to prevent and reverse this process by stimulating digestion andclearing fat from the blood.Studies dating back to the late 1960s suggested that taking guggulu could resultin significant reductions in blood levels of cholesterol and triglycerides.1[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col15-nts1] More-recent reports haveconfirmed these preliminary findings in both animals and people. Researchers inIndia found that men taking 50 milligrams of gugulipid twice a day for sixmonths had about a 12-percent drop in their cholesterol levels.2[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col15-nts2] Side effects in a few patientsincluded mild headache, nausea, and stomach gas, but over 95 percent of subjectstook the herb regularly without difficulty.In another study, gugulipid was compared to a standard cholesterol-loweringdrug, clofibrate, in over two hundred patients with raised cholesterol ortriglyceride levels. Gugulipid was more effective than clofibrate in patientswith high cholesterol, slightly less effective in patients with hightriglycerides, and equivalent in people with elevations in both. Perhaps mostimportant, patients taking gugulipid had elevations in their HDL cholesterollevels, the so-called good cholesterol component.3[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col15-nts3]In addition to its cholesterol-lowering activity, guggulu reduces the stickinessof platelets,4 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col15-nts4] the bloodcomponents that stop us from bleeding when we cut ourselves, but that alsocontribute to undesired clotting of blood vessels. The combination of guggulu’sfat-lowering properties and its ability to slightly thin the blood makes it adesirable substance to reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke.Guggulu’s other important medicinal effect is its ability to reduceinflammation. It holds an established place in the Ayurvedic pharmacy as afirst-line treatment for arthritis. Animal studies comparing guggulu toestablished anti-inflammatory medicines such as ibuprofen and phenylbutazoneshowed that guggulu was equally effective in reducing joint swelling.5[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col15-nts5] The anti-inflammatory benefit ofguggulu has also been found useful in the treatment of acne. In a studycomparing guggulu to the antibiotic tetracycline, guggulu was slightly moreeffective, particularly in people with oily skin.6[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col15-nts6]THE PRACTICAL USE OF GUGGULUTraditionally, many therapeutic properties are attributed to guggulu. It hasbeen used for thousands of years in the treatment of obesity, where it isbelieved to stimulate the digestion of stored toxins. It can be applied directlyto festering skin sores, including acne lesions. As a mouthwash, guggulu can behelpful in the treatment of canker sores and gingivitis. Wherever there is acondition of stagnation, guggulu’s penetrating properties can clear away thetoxins.We use guggulu liberally at the Chopra Center in people who have accumulatedtoxicity from significant life stresses. People who are recovering from seriousillnesses, who have required prolonged courses of antibiotics, or who haverecently stopped using recreational drugs or alcohol benefit from guggulu’sdetoxifying properties.In people with elevated cholesterol levels, guggulu can be an initial approachbefore resorting to the more potent cholesterol-lowering drugs. Although it istraditionally used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, we have foundguggulu to be most helpful in relieving the discomfort of people withnonspecific pain. Myofascial pain syndrome, fibromyalgia, and rheumatism areconditions that often respond to the cleansing activity of guggulu.A combination of guggulu and Triphala is helpful in strengthening digestivepower. The mixture is particularly beneficial when someone has both weakdigestion and irregular elimination. We use a suspension of guggulu as a garglefor sore throats, mouth sores, and gingivitis. A crushed tablet mixed with warmwater is swished in the mouth or gargled several times daily until the sorenessresolves.HOW TO USE GUGGULUGuggulu is now readily available through several herbal producers. Since moststudies have found that 25 milligrams of guggulsterones three times daily iseffective in reducing elevated cholesterol levels, be certain that you arereceiving this amount. Some formulations list the total guggulu content, whichshould be at least 500 milligrams per tablet. For the treatment of rheumaticconditions, try taking two tablets three times a day after meals. You should seea response within two weeks.As a gargle or mouthwash, crush a tablet in one-half cup of warm water and usethree times daily. This same mixture can be applied to superficial skin woundsto facilitate healing.AYURVEDA AND GUGGULUAs one of Ayurveda’s primary detoxifying substances, guggulu is beneficial in awide range of conditions. A complex herb, carrying four of the sixtastes—bitter, pungent, astringent, and sweet—it is especially effective forstabilizing Vata and Kapha imbalances without irritating Pitta. Whenever thereis an accumulation of toxicity in the system, guggulu can be a powerful aid todigesting and eliminating it.PRECAUTIONSGuggulu is slightly heating and is occasionally associated with mild digestivediscomfort. In view of its role in reducing platelet stickiness, it should notbe used in patients receiving blood-thinning medications.[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_033_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_034_r1.jpg]CRATAEGUS OXYACANTHAFAMILIAR: hawthorn, May blossomLATIN: Crataegus oxyacanthaWell known to European healers of medieval times, hawthorn was identified as asacred herb, supposed to be the source of Christ’s crown of thorns. During thefourteenth century, the unusual smell of hawthorn berries became associated withthe bubonic plague, and for the next two hundred years it was avoided as ahealing aid. By the 1600s, hawthorn regained its reputation as an importantherbal rejuvenative through the writings of the famous English herbalistNicholas Culpeper. Traditionally used as a treatment for urinary tract problems,it came to be known by Western herbalists as an important cardiac tonic. Modernscientific studies have confirmed the circulatory benefits of the bright redberries and flowering tops of this familiar tree, now found throughout thetemperate zones of Europe, North America, and Asia.BOTANICAL AND PHYTOCHEMICAL INFORMATIONA member of the rose family, the deciduous hawthorn tree, with its sharp thorns,can grow to heights of thirty feet. It blooms in small white flowers withroselike petals during the spring, accounting for one of hawthorn’s commonnames, May blossom. The flowers give rise to small red berries with one or twoseeds. The dried berries have traditionally been the source of the herbalmedicine, although active phytochemicals have also been identified in theflowers and leaves.A wide range of chemical constituents is present in hawthorn, includingpolysaccharides, amines, tannins, phytosterols, and organic acids. Mostscientific attention has focused on hawthorn’s flavonoid components,particularly quercetin, rutin, and the proanthocyanidins, also known asprocyanidins. Also abundant in grape seeds, pine bark, cranberries, beans, andbran, proanthocyanidins have potent antioxidant properties and protectiveeffects on collagen tissue. According to some reports, proanthocyanidins aremore potent neutralizers of free radicals than the antioxidant vitamins C andE.1 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col16-nts1] The proanthocyanidinsidentified in hawthorn include catechin and epicatechin, also present in greentea and red wine. These and other natural chemicals in hawthorn contribute toits beneficial effects on cardiovascular health.THE SCIENCE OF HAWTHORNThere are several possible ways in which hawthorn may contribute to cardiachealth. It has a mild blood-pressure-lowering effect, believed due to itsability to block the enzyme that activates the chemical, angiotensin, asubstance that constricts blood vessels and induces the kidney to retain salt.2[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col16-nts2] Many modern blood pressuremedicines act by blocking this angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE); these areknown as ACE inhibitors.Hawthorn has also been found effective in lowering blood cholesterol levels andstrengthening the collagen component of connective tissues.3[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col16-nts3], 4[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col16-nts4] These combined effects can slowthe development of atherosclerosis in heart blood vessels that leads to heartattacks. Some of the most interesting studies on hawthorn have found that it canreduce the damage sustained by heart tissue as a result of blocked coronaryarteries.5 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col16-nts5], 6[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col16-nts6] These heart-protecting effectsof hawthorn are mainly due to the free radical–neutralizing properties of theabundant proanthocyanidins it contains.7[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col16-nts7] Hawthorn may also help dilatecoronary blood vessels, allowing for greater oxygen and energy delivery to theheart.8 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col16-nts8] In addition to limitingthe amount of heart muscle that is injured, hawthorn reduces the risk of seriousheart rhythm irregularities triggered by inadequate blood flow.9[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col16-nts9]A number of reports from Europe have shown that the diverse effects of hawthornon the circulatory system can be of benefit to people with heart disease. In onestudy of seventy-eight patients with chronic heart failure, those taking a dailydose of hawthorn extract had a lowering of their blood pressure, a reduction intheir heart rate, and a significant improvement in their exercise tolerance.10[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col16-nts10] Another report, from Germany,evaluated 136 people with heart failure and found that both objective andsubjective measurements of cardiac function improved.11[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col16-nts11] Measurements of cardiacfunction improved, and people reported a better quality of life.Hawthorn is generally very well tolerated by heart patients without serious sideeffects. Considering its low toxicity and many positive actions, it is clearlyworthy of further scientific research to clarify its rightful place in thetreatment of heart disease, the most pressing health concern of our age.THE PRACTICAL USE OF HAWTHORNIn European countries, hawthorn is often prescribed by physicians in thetreatment of mild heart conditions, characterized by nonspecific fatigue,exercise intolerance, and occasional palpitations. It is best viewed as a tonicthat must be taken daily for several weeks before a noticeable benefit is seen.Hawthorn may have a mild sedative effect, adding to its value instress-exacerbated conditions.If you have a diagnosed heart condition, be certain to discuss the use ofhawthorn with your health-care provider before using it. Do not abruptlydiscontinue any of your current heart medicines without the approval of, andclose monitoring by, your doctor.HOW TO USE HAWTHORNHawthorn is widely available in a variety of preparations, including tablets ofdried berries, tinctures, and flower extracts. Dried-berry tablets or capsulescontaining approximately 500 milligrams are the most common forms obtainable inthe UnitedStates. Extracts standardized to contain 1 to 3 percent vitexin, one of theisolated flavonoids in hawthorn, are also available. The usual dose is .5 gramto 1 gram of the dried berries twice daily.In Germany, most hawthorn is in the form of a water-ethanol extract of theleaves and flowers. The dose recommended by the German Commission E is 160 to900 milligrams per day, corresponding to 3.5 to 20 milligrams of flavonoids.Standardized extracts available here usually contain about 1.8 milligrams offlavonoids, so two to four tablets daily will provide a dosage within thesuggested range.AYURVEDA AND HAWTHORNAlthough not recognized in the ancient Ayurvedic formularies, hawthorn’s effectson the doshas can be understood by looking at its basic properties. Thepredominant tastes of hawthorn berries are sour, bitter, and sweet. It has amildly heating potency on the physiology. Hawthorn is pacifying to Vata andneutral to Pitta, but may be aggravating to Kapha in high dosages.PRECAUTIONSHawthorn is a generally safe herbal nutritional substance. Studies from theearly 1980s reported very low toxicity in animals.12[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col16-nts12] Despite the fact that hawthornis well tolerated, it should be used cautiously by people with heart ailments.Studies assessing its interactions with standard cardiac drugs have not beenperformed. It is generally not recommended for women who are pregnant orbreastfeeding.[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_035_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_036_r1.jpg]CURCURMA LONGAFAMILIAR: turmericLATIN: Curcurma longaSANSKRIT: haridraThis beautiful yellow spice belongs to the same family as ginger. Knownprimarily as a culinary herb in the West, turmeric holds an established positionin healing systems around the world, including India, China, and the Polynesianislands. It is a component of most curry powder blends and contributes to theyellow color of many mustard preparations. Used as a cosmetic agent in ancientIndia, it was known to heal the skin as well as provide a lustrous golden glow.BOTANICAL AND PHYTOCHEMICAL INFORMATIONCulinary and medicinal turmeric is derived from the rhizomes of this perennialherb that grows to about three feet high. The usable part is harvested in thewinter, boiled or steamed, and then dried. Although about 5 percent of therhizome is composed of an essential oil, most turmeric is available as a powder.Chemicals identified in turmeric include curcumin, tumerone, and zingiberone,along with a carotene equivalent to 50 IU of vitamin A per 100 grams. Themedicinal effects of turmeric are probably related to the curcumin, which hasbeen shown to have potent antioxidant properties.1[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col17-nts1]THE SCIENCE OF TURMERICTurmeric is a pharmacy unto itself. A wealth of scientific studies havedemonstrated that this golden spice can have health-promoting effects on thedigestive, cardiovascular, rheumatic, and immune systems. It has a very highsafety profile without serious side effects at usual dosages.Turmeric has a soothing effect on the digestive system, with studies showingthat it helps to increase the mucous protective lining of the stomach, reducingthe risk of ulcers due to stress or drugs.2[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col17-nts2] It has a protective effect onthe liver and can help reduce elevated blood cholesterol levels.3[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col17-nts3], 4[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col17-nts4]The most common medicinal uses of turmeric involve its anti-inflammatoryproperties. Constituents of turmeric have been shown to suppress inflammation byblocking the production of certain prostaglandin chemicals.5[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col17-nts5] Through a similar mechanism, ithas been shown to keep platelets from sticking together, which, along with itsdocumented cholesterol-lowering effect and its ability to suppress the growth ofblood vessel muscle cells, may give turmeric an important role in lowering therisk of heart attacks.6 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col17-nts6]One of turmeric’s traditional uses has been in the treatment of arthritis, andscientific studies have suggested that, alone or in combination with otherherbs, it can reduce pain and stiffness.7[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col17-nts7], 8[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col17-nts8] Several studies in animals havedemonstrated that turmeric can prevent or inhibit the development of certaincancer cells, but whether this is relevant to people has yet to be determined.9[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col17-nts9], 10[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col17-nts10] It does seem to help the bodydetoxify itself of potentially cancer-causing substances.11[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col17-nts11]Turmeric has long been used as a natural antibiotic agent.

It is not recommended for use in people with known gallstones.PRACTICAL USES FOR TURMERICTurmeric powder adds its pleasant taste and beautiful color to soups and sautéedvegetable dishes, and can be used liberally as a culinary spice. Its traditionalpurifying effect makes it a useful spice for people participating in adetoxification program. Turmeric can be taken at the earliest sign of a sorethroat or cough by sprinkling it onto organic honey and licking a teaspoon everytwo hours. It can also be added to a variety of herbal teas, including blends ofchamomile, licorice, and slippery elm when facing a cold or flu. Occasionally,capsules of turmeric are prescribed for the treatment of mild arthriticconditions. In patients facing cancer, we recommend the liberal use of turmericin food dishes. It is also encouraged for people diagnosed with mild adult-onsetdiabetes mellitus.Powdered turmeric mixed into a paste with water can be directly applied topimples and other irritated skin lesions before bedtime. The bright yellow colormay make you reluctant to use turmeric on your face during the day. Once thepaste dries, the residual powder can be washed off with plain water.HOW TO USE TURMERICTurmeric is widely available in grocery and Indian spice stores. It is atraditional component of most curry spice blends in which it combines well withcumin, coriander, and fenugreek. A quarter teaspoon of turmeric added whilecooking a cup of basmati rice adds its subtle flavor and golden color to thedish.As a tea, add one-half teaspoon to a cup of boiling water, reduce the heat, andsteep for ten minutes. Add a little honey and drink several times per day for anagging cold or flu. It combines well with fresh gingerroot and cardamom.If you have a sore throat, scoop up three-quarters of a teaspoon of honey andadd as much turmeric powder as will stick to the honey. Then slowly lick thehoney-turmeric mixture, allowing it to coat your throat as you swallow it. Thiscan be repeated many times per day until your throat discomfort subsides.For skin eruptions, take one-half teaspoon of turmeric powder and add a fewdrops of water at a time until you have a thick paste. Then apply the mixture toan aggravated pimple and allow it to dry fully. Wash the caked powder off, andrepeat up to four times daily. For irritated rashes on parts of your body otherthan your face, mix turmeric powder with ghee (clarified butter) or coconut oil,one-half teaspoon of turmeric per ounce of oil or ghee. Then massage theherbalized oil into the irritated area. Repeat this two or three times each dayfor several days. To benefit from turmeric’s generalized inflammatory anddetoxifying properties, take one teaspoon in low-fat milk three times daily.AYURVEDA AND TURMERICTurmeric is an important cleansing and detoxifying agent in Ayurvedic medicine.Classified as bitter and mildly heating, it is used both internally andtopically. For fevers, colds, and flu, turmeric can be added to coriander andcinnamon teas or taken mixed with honey. Mixing it with clarified butter orvegetable oil enhances its absorption. It can be applied directly to sites ofirritated skin, in the form of a paste or ointment. Taken internally, it has aparticular effect of balancing excessive Kapha.PRECAUTIONSAlthough no clinical problems have been reported, turmeric’s effect on plateletstheoretically suggests that high doses should be avoided by people on prescribedblood thinners.[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_037_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_038_r1.jpg]ECHINACEA PURPUREAFAMILIAR: echinacea, purple coneflowerLATIN: Echinacea purpurea, Echinacea angustifolia, Echinacea pallidaPerhaps the most popular herbal medicine in the United States, echinacea isnative to North America.

At least fourteen Native American tribes used echinaceamedicinally for upper respiratory infections, snake bites, and toothaches. Ofthe nine known species of echinacea, three are commonly available today and seemto have equivalent actions. In addition to its reputed medicinal value,echinacea is popular in flower gardens for its attractive flowers.Echinacea has been the subject of intense scientific investigations in bothEurope and America to assess its reputation as an immune enhancer. Although notevery study has yielded positive results, there is considerable evidence thatechinacea can enhance our immunity. It is a generally safe herbal medicine withrare serious adverse effects reported despite millions of doses consumedannually.BOTANICAL AND PHYTOCHEMICAL INFORMATIONBoth the flowering tops and the roots of echinacea are used for medicinalpurposes. All species of echinacea belong to the daisy family, and their flowersshow characteristic raylike petals projecting from a central cone. The size ofechinacea plants ranges from the smaller E. angustifolia, which is usually lessthan two feet in height, to the three-foot-tall E. purpurea to the even largerfour-foot E. pallida. Echinacea’s range extends from southern Canada through thecentral and eastern United States, with colors ranging from deep purple to lightpink.The chemical constituents of echinacea responsible for its medicinal propertieshave not been clearly characterized. Although sugars, glycosides, tannins,terpenes, and phenolic compounds have been identified, the polysaccharidecomponent has received the most attention. Laboratory studies looking intoechinacea have shown that a polysaccharide extract activates immune cells andinhibits the ability of bacteria to invade healthy cells. Several recent studiesapplying these test-tube findings to people have shown that the polysaccharidecomponent of echinacea may be responsible for its anti-infective benefit inpeople.THE SCIENCE OF ECHINACEAMany studies have looked at the role of echinacea on the immune system. Studiesin mice have shown that echinacea extract can enhance the production ofimmune-stimulating chemicals including interleukins and tumor necrosis factors,important in identifying and eliminating potentially harmful germs and cancercells.1 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col18-nts1] Components of echinaceaalso help attract and stimulate white blood cells, whose job it is to gobble upinvading organisms.2 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col18-nts2], 3[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col18-nts3] Known as macrophages, thesewarriors of the immune system are important in fighting viral, bacterial, andfungal infections. Interestingly, echinacea also contains naturalanti-inflammatory chemicals, suggesting that this herb is intrinsically balancedso as not to overly excite an immune response.4[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col18-nts4]The ability of echinacea to influence immune function in people has been studiedin both healthy volunteers and people with illnesses. In a recent review of fivestudies that measured immune function in healthy people taking echinacea, twoshowed a definite effect, while the other three did not.5[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col18-nts5] The authors of this reportpointed out that it was difficult to interpret the different results as themeasurements of immune function, and the echinacea extract used was different ineach study. In another report of twelve patients who had undergone surgery forcancerous tumors, echinacea did not have any detectable effect on their immunefunction.6 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col18-nts6]The important question regarding echinacea is whether or not it benefits peoplewith real-life immune challenges. Although dozens of studies have looked at thisquestion, most have weaknesses that make their reliable interpretationdifficult.7 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col18-nts7] Two well-designedinvestigations published in the early 1990s did find measurable benefit from theuse of echinacea. In one, patients began taking echinacea drops at the start ofa flu-like illness. Those who took a higher dose of echinacea extract had afaster recovery than people who took a lower dose or a placebo.8[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col18-nts8] Another study, from Germany,looking at people with a tendency to get upper-respiratory infections found thatthose taking echinacea had fewer and less severe episodes over an eight-weekperiod.9 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col18-nts9]Recent studies have been less clearcut. Subjects given daily doses of echinaceafor twelve weeks showed no objective advantage in terms of a reduced frequencyof respiratory infections, compared with those taking a placebo, although thoseon echinacea reported subjective benefits.10[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col18-nts10] In yet another German study,people taking echinacea were followed for eight weeks and compared against thoseon a placebo. Although the average number of respiratory infections was .78 inthe echinacea group and .93 in the placebo group, and the average length of acold was 4.5 days in the echinacea group and 6.5 days in the placebo group, thedifferences did not reach statistical significance.11[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col18-nts11] A more positive result wasreported in a recent Swedish study in which people who took a concentratedechinacea extract at the start of a cold had faster relief of symptoms thanthose taking a placebo.12 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col18-nts12]Summarizing the findings of these various studies, it appears that echinacea hasa benefit in reducing the symptoms of a cold or flu if it is taken early in thecourse. It is less certain that it has definite value as a preventive agent.THE PRACTICAL USE OF ECHINACEAEchinacea can provide natural support to your body’s immune system for minorself-limiting respiratory infections. Keep some echinacea in your home pharmacyand begin taking it at the first signs of a cold or flu. Its role in otherconditions where an immune boost may be valuable, such as other types ofinfections or cancer, has not been well documented. One report using echinaceain people with chronic fatigue syndrome and AIDS found that it could enhanceimmune function over the short term, but long-term follow-up was notavailable.13 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col18-nts13] Whether you arebasically healthy or are dealing with an illness that compromises your immunesystem, we do not recommend the use of echinacea on a regular basis, for it maylose its effectiveness after taking it steadily for a couple of weeks and not behelpful when you actually need it.In addition to its internal use, echinacea has also had a traditional use as atopical medicinal substance. Dried herbal tablets can be crushed and suspendedin water to be used as a gargle for sore throats. The juiced extract can also beapplied directly to abrasions or sores to reduce the chance of infection.HOW TO USE ECHINACEAEchinacea is available in many forms today. Tablets and capsules containing thedried herb and tinctures are the most common products, although you can now findechinacea in teas, cold remedies, and even throat lozenges. Many herbmanufacturers have standardized their doses to provide a specific percentage ofchemical ingredients, usually 15 percent polysaccharides and 4 percent phenoliccompounds. Tablets and capsules deliver between 125 and 300 milligrams ofechinacea extract per dose. Recommended daily intake is between 500 milligramsand 1 gram in two or three divided doses.Echinacea is also available as a liquid tincture, usually extracted in ethanolin a 1:1 or 1:2 dilution. The extracts can be derived solely from the root ormay include material from seeds, leaves, and flowers. Echinacea extract is oftencombined with extracts of other herbs that have a reputation for immuneenhancement, most commonly goldenseal. The usual dose of the liquid extract istwenty-five to sixty drops, two or three times daily.Although some herbalists suggest taking it on a routine basis, the evidence morestrongly supports the short-term use of echinacea at the start of an infection.Its effectiveness probably wanes after taking it for more than ten days in arow.ECHINACEA AND AYURVEDAAlthough not known to Ayurvedic physicians in India, echinacea can be understoodas a potent detoxifying substance, similar in some ways to neem. It carries thebitter and pungent tastes and has a net cooling effect on the physiology. It isreducing to Pitta and Kapha, but can be aggravating to Vata if used for aprolonged period.PRECAUTIONSMost studies of neem emphasize its safety in both adults and children. A recentreview stated the only adverse reactions were to the taste of the extract.14[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col18-nts14] Echinacea has been shown to bevirtually non-toxic to mice and rats.15[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col18-nts15] However, a recent report fromAustralia identified a woman who may have had a severe allergic reaction toechinacea, and cautioned that people with a history of allergy may show ahypersensitivity to echinacea, even upon first exposure.16[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col18-nts16][images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_039_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_040_r1.jpg]ELETTERIA CARDAMOMUMFAMILIAR: cardamosLATIN: Eletteria cardamomumSANSKRIT: elaFor millennia the enticing, sweet, and pungent aroma of cardamom has been prizedaround the world. Described in the early Ayurvedic texts, valued by the ancientGreeks, and coveted by European powers during the Renaissance, cardamom hastraditionally been associated with royalty and haute cuisine. The famouscollection of stories known as The Arabian Nights is spiced with references tocardamom, a favorite Middle Eastern flavoring added to soften the bitterness ofcoffee. Both historically and today, this unique spice is highly sought afterand relatively high-priced. Cardamom is the spice of celebrations andhospitality.BOTANICAL AND PHYTOCHEMICAL INFORMATIONThe cardamom plant, found in the tropical rain forests of India and growing wildon the coastal hills, is a perennial that grows up to ten feet high and bears adelicate yellowish white flower with violet stripes. The spice comes from thearomatic green seed pods, which can hold up to eighteen seeds. The pods areharvested before they ripen, and are sun-dried until they open and release thetreasured seeds.Up to 8 percent of a cardamom seed consists of an essential oil that contains avariety of volatile substances including limonene, cineol, terpineol, andterpinene.THE SCIENCE OF CARDAMOMCardamom has received very little scientific attention for its medicinalqualities. Animal studies from Saudi Arabia have demonstrated that thesteam-distilled oil has anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving properties.1[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col19-nts1] It also reduces muscle spasms,acting on receptors for acetylcholine, the neurochemical that generates musclecontractions.Studies from Asia have shown that cardamom oil enhances the penetration of otherdrugs through the skin. Mixing cardamom oil with the anti-inflammatory medicineindocin and with the steroid drug prednisolone increased the amount of themedicine that penetrated the skin.2[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col19-nts2], 3[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col19-nts3] These effects may eventually behelpful in improving the delivery of dermatological medicines.In a study from China, cardamom, along with other herbs, was reported to reducethe side effects of different chemotherapy drugs.4[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col19-nts4] Cardamom’s aromatic essentialoil may help reduce nausea.THE PRACTICAL USE OF CARDAMOMCardamom is best known as a culinary spice. It is considered a member of thesweet spices group and is commonly used to flavor candies and bakery goods.Cardamom is often added to curried spiced blends, rice pilafs, and pastries toprovide its distinctive flavor and aroma. Although it is not as well known inAmerican cooking, cardamom is an important spice in kitchens ranging from Indiato Africa, and from Arabia to South America. The essential oil extracted fromthe almost-ripe fruits is used in perfumes and to flavor coffees and liqueurs.Cardamom seeds can be chewed to sweeten the breath and are offered to guests atthe end of a meal as a sign of hospitality.Cardamom has been used medicinally for many health concerns. The generallysoothing effects of the essential oil are applied to conditions affecting boththe respiratory and digestive tracts. Cardamom tea or crushed seeds may be givento people with asthma to relieve respiratory spasms. Sinus congestion resultingfrom a cold may also respond to the aromatic properties of cardamom.In the digestive system it is considered a carminative, useful in relieving gasand bloating. It enlivens the digestive fire and is usually well accepted bypeople with poor digestion who have difficulty tolerating the hotter spices suchas ginger or cayenne. It has a very mild laxative effect and can be particularlyhelpful in relieving abdominal discomfort after overeating. When peopletransition from a meat-based diet to a primarily vegetarian one, theyoccasionally go through a phase of gaseousness and digestive irritability.Cardamom tea will often promptly alleviate the gastrointestinal stagnation. Itcan safely be given to children for mild stomach aches with a potency similar tochamomile.Cardamom has a warming effect on the system, which can help with mildcirculation problems characterized by cold hands and feet. It can also relievechills when one is facing a cold or flu. Its pleasant taste makes it a good herbto combine with other, less appetizing ones in order to improve theirpalatability.We recommend adding a pinch of cardamom powder to hot milk before bed as an aidto sound sleep. The combination of nutmeg, cardamom, and a teaspoon of brownsugar or honey enhances milk’s relaxing effect. The cardamom also seems toimprove the digestibility of milk in people who are sensitive to dairy. Cardamomis a good example of a spice that illustrates the close relationship between anherb’s medicinal and culinary value.HOW TO USE CARDAMOMCardamom is readily available as whole and ground seeds in most grocery, healthfood, and herb stores. It can be used singly or as part of a digestive formulaconsisting of equal parts ground cardamom seeds, cinnamon, and nutmeg. As a tea,place one-quarter to one-half teaspoon steeped in a cup of boiling water for tenminutes. This will create a weak infusion that can be sweetened or taken alone.Cardamom seeds mix well with fennel seeds to soothe indigestion afterovereating.This mixture also makes a nice natural breath freshener. Cardamom mixed with alittle grated gingerroot can help reduce nausea and may be helpful in pregnancyfor morning sickness.Adding one-quarter teaspoon of ground cardamom seed to your coffee will softenthe bitterness and give you a taste of Arabia. Cardamom can also be combinedwith black tea, cloves, milk, and honey for a delicious and exotic fatiguereliever.AYURVEDA AND CARDAMOMFrom an Ayurvedic perspective, cardamom is a warming herb whose potentialPitta-aggravating qualities are balanced by its sweet taste. It can be usedliberally by people with a Vata or Kapha constitution, and will notoverstimulate Pitta except in high quantities.PRECAUTIONSTaken as a culinary spice, cardamom is very safe. Occasionally people withactive peptic ulcers report mild digestive distress with high doses.[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_041_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_042_r1.jpg]EMBLICA OFFICINALISFAMILIAR: amalaki, Indian gooseberryLATIN: Emblica officinalisSANSKRIT: amalakiAmalaki is considered the best herbal medicine for rejuvenation in Ayurveda. Itcan be used alone or in combination with many other herbs. The basis of the mostfamous Ayurvedic herbal jam, Chavan Prash, amalaki is considered capable ofreversing the aging process. From a taste standpoint, it is among the mostcomplicated edible substances, possessing five of the six basic flavors (lackingonly the salty taste). Native to the forests of India, amalaki is valuedthroughout Nepal, Tibet, and the Middle East.Amalaki is one of the richest natural sources of antioxidant vitamins, with itsjuice possessing almost twenty times as much vitamin C as orange juice. It haswide traditional uses, including the treatment of skin diseases, lungconditions, diabetes, and indigestion. It is one of the three ingredients ofTriphala, the most important Ayurvedic bowel tonic.BOTANICAL AND PHYTOCHEMICAL INFORMATIONAmalaki fruits are obtained from the Emblica officinalis tree, which grows intropical and subtropical climates. The fruit is less than an inch in diameterand has a segmented appearance. Yellowish brown when fresh, the fruit turnsnearly black as it dries. There is almost one gram of vitamin C in a half-cup ofamalaki juice.1 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col20-nts1] Small amounts ofcalcium, potassium, iron, and B vitamins are also present in the amalaki fruit.Many different tannins as well as pectin are constituents of amalaki.THE SCIENCE OF AMALAKIAmalaki’s traditional role as a rejuvenating herbal medicine has been studied intwo major health areas: cancer and heart disease. Studies in animals havesuggested that amalaki may slow the development and growth of cancer cells. In astudy from India, mice given a known cancer-causing chemical along with amalakihad significantly fewer harmful genetic changes than those given the carcinogenalone.2 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col20-nts2] Amalaki has also beenshown to reduce genetic mutations in bacteria exposed to substances that havebeen identified to cause cancer.3[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col20-nts3]An herbal jam made with amalaki, called MAK-4, has been studied in severalanimal models. In one study it was found to inhibit cancerous changes induced bya toxic chemical.4 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col20-nts4] In another itwas found to reduce both the number and size of metastatic cancerous lesions.5[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col20-nts5] The relevance of these reportsto human cancers remains to be clarified, but the preliminary results areencouraging.The other major area of scientific interest in amalaki is its role in thelowering of serum cholesterol levels. Several studies in rabbits have shown thatamalaki is effective in reducing blood cholesterol values and the deposition offat into blood vessels.6 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col20-nts6], 7[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col20-nts7] In a study in rabbits, amalakireduced serum cholesterol levels by over 80 percent.8[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col20-nts8]This cholesterol-lowering effect is applicable to human beings as well. Menwhose diet was supplemented with amalaki for one month demonstrated lowering oftheir serum cholesterol levels, whether or not their cholesterol was elevatedbefore they began taking the amalaki.9[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col20-nts9] Other studies have suggestedthat amalaki-based supplements can reduce the harmful oxidation of cholesterolin men.10 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col20-nts10] It may also decreasethe stickiness of platelets, lowering the risk of unwanted blood clotting.11[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col20-nts11]Other potential therapeutic effects of amalaki have received preliminaryscientific attention. It has been used traditionally in the treatment ofheartburn, and one report has provided some support for this use.12[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col20-nts12] It also has a reputation forthe treatment of liver and pancreatic conditions, and in one animal study it wasable to reduce the extent of tissue damage caused by experimentalpancreatitis.13 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col20-nts13] Althoughamalaki has classically been recommended in the treatment of diabetes mellitus,there has been no scientific research to evaluate this use. Studies have shownthat amalaki does have antibiotic activity against a wide range of bacteria,possibly explaining its traditional role in the treatment of lung infections.14[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col20-nts14]THE PRACTICAL USE OF AMALAKIAmalaki forms the basis of the premier Ayurvedic rejuvenative jam traditionallyknown as Chavan Prash, named after the doctor who developed the formulathousands of years ago. We recommend this mixture of amalaki fruit with manyother tonic herbs for people recovering from illness as well as for thoseseeking rejuvenation. A teaspoon twice daily is the usual dosage, either takenstraight or mixed in juice or warm milk.Amalaki is also readily available in Triphala, the gentle Ayurvedic bowel tonicthat can be helpful in people with chronic constipation as well as those withirritable bowel syndrome. Mixed with shatavari, fennel, and turmeric, it can beeffective in reducing hyperacidity.As a cholesterol agent, amalaki combines well with guggulu. This samecombination may be helpful in diabetes, rheumatic conditions, and liverailments.HOW TO USE AMALAKIAs a component of triphala, amalaki represents one-third of a typical half-gramtablet. The usual dose to improve colon function is one to two grams daily individed doses. As a treatment for elevated cholesterol, begin with one gramtwice daily. In the form of amalaki herbal jam, a teaspoon morning and eveningwill provide you with a good dose of this potent herbal antioxidant.AYURVEDA AND AMALAKIAlthough the sweet taste predominates in amalaki, its complex nature makes itappropriate for all three doshas. Because it is a rich rasayana, wheneverpossible it is advisable to first undergo a period of detoxification beforetaking amalaki. It is traditionally considered to be rejuvenating for Pittaimbalances, and strengthening to the liver, stomach, heart, and blood.PRECAUTIONSOwing to its laxative qualities, amalaki should be used carefully in people witha tendency toward loose bowels. Many herbal jam formulations of amalaki havehigh concentrations of sugar and clarified butter (ghee). Chavan Prash shouldtherefore be used carefully by people with diabetes and high cholesterol;without the sugar and ghee, amalaki is considered helpful for these conditions.[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_043_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_044_r1.jpg]GINKGO BILOBAFAMILIAR: ginkgoLATIN: ginkgo bilobaGinkgo may be the most ancient tree on earth, dating back 200 million years.Once found in North America and Europe, it survived only in China after theprehistoric ice ages. Prized for its medicinal properties for almost fivethousand years, ginkgo is now one of the most popular herbs in Europe and theUnited States. The name ginkgo is derived from the Japanese words gin, meaning“silver” and kyo meaning “apricot,” referring to the inedible fruits that appearin the summer.Serious interest in ginkgo has been expanding in the West over the pastquarter-century as scientific research has documented the therapeutic benefitsof this ancient herb on circulation, memory, hearing, and balance. A dry extractof ginkgo called EGb (extract of Ginkgo biloba) is now the standardized herbalproduct that is receiving attention around the world.BOTANICAL AND PHYTOCHEMICAL INFORMATIONGinkgo is a deciduous tree that can grow to heights of over one hundred feet andmay live as long as one thousand years. Originally cultivated in China, ginkgotrees are now grown on farms in Japan, France, and, most recently, thesoutheastern United States. It is a remarkably hardy plant, tolerant ofpollution and pests, and able to thrive in modern urban environments.The characteristic fanlike leaves of ginkgo have two lobes, accounting for itsspecies name, biloba. The leaves are harvested in the fall and put through anextraction process using an acetone-and-water mixture. The solvent is removedand the extract is standardized to yield 24 percent flavone glycosides and 5 to7 percent terpene lactones. These compounds have a variety of pharmacologicaleffects, including antioxidant, circulation-enhancing, andnerve-cells-protective action. Ginkgo extract also inhibits a natural substancecalled platelet activation factor (PAF) that is an important component of theclotting system. The various properties of ginkgo may combine to explain itsclinical value in improving memory and circulation.THE SCIENCE OF GINKGOHundreds of scientific studies have been published on the laboratory andclinical effects of ginkgo. It is a complex medicinal substance whose full rangeof properties have yet to be characterized. It has diverse actions, includingthe ability to protect cell membranes, neutralize free radicals, protect tissuesfrom oxygen deprivation, and improve circulation. Because it appears to havevery few side effects, medical researchers have been performing clinical studiesto test the applicability of the laboratory and animal findings to people.Initial studies on ginkgo in human beings focused on its ability to enhanceblood supply to the brain as well as to increase the brain’s ability to utilizeoxygen and energy sources.1 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col21-nts1], 2[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col21-nts2] Ginkgo extract has also beenshown to protect the integrity of nerve cells deprived of oxygen.3[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col21-nts3] These initial findings led to anumber of clinical studies in people with impaired neurological functioningbelieved to result from lack of circulation to the brain. At the time of many ofthese studies, memory impairment was often blamed on lack of blood supply, andimproving circulation to the brain was believed to help people think moreclearly. Several reports of people given ginkgo demonstrated that they performedbetter on tests of mental functioning.4[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col21-nts4], 5[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col21-nts5]We have since learned that most elderly people with serious memory problems havea degenerative condition such as Alzheimer’s disease or multiple small strokesrather than a generalized lack of blood supply to the brain. Recent studies haveevaluated the role of ginkgo in patients with these conditions and found that itcan provide definite value. A small German study found that people withAlzheimer’s disease taking 240 milligrams of ginkgo extract per day showedimprovement in their mental functioning compared with a deterioration in thosetaking a placebo.6 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col21-nts6] A largerstudy of people with dementia resulting either from Alzheimer’s disease ormultiple small strokes also found that ginkgo improved their memory and qualityof life.7 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col21-nts7] A recent NorthAmerican study also found that people with dementia taking ginkgo did notdeteriorate as quickly as those on a placebo and in a number of cases actuallyimproved.8 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col21-nts8] Although the benefitshave generally been mild to moderate, these are nonetheless remarkable findings,for there has been very little else to offer patients with this devastatingcondition. The currently available pharmacological agents are not veryeffective, have substantial side effects, and are very expensive.Does ginkgo provide any memory benefit to people without brain diseases? We donot yet know the answer to this question. Mice given ginkgo learn more quickly,with less anxiety, but we do not know if this has relevance in people.9[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col21-nts9] Of interest is the finding thatmice receiving ginkgo show subtle changes in nerve cells that reside in thememory center of their brain, providing a possible anatomical explanation forthe observed enhancement of memory.10[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col21-nts10] A study of basically healthypeople with fatigue found that those taking ginkgo in combination with ginsengscored slightly higher on tests of cognitive function than those taking aplacebo.11 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col21-nts11] Although we do notrecommend that everyone take ginkgo as a brain food, it does appear to provide asafe approach for those having difficulty maintaining their mental focus.In addition to the memory-enhancing effects of ginkgo, this ancient botanicalmedicine has shown many other potentially beneficial health effects. A commoncondition that develops as people age is impaired circulation to the legs, whichresults in pain when walking. Some studies, but not all, have shown that ginkgomay benefit this condition, known as intermittent claudication. Reports fromGermany found that patients taking ginkgo are able to walk farther with lesspain than those taking a placebo.12[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col21-nts12], 13[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col21-nts13] Another study from Denmark didnot find improvement in the ambulatory capacity of people taking ginkgo, but didfind that these patients had improved concentration and memory.14[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col21-nts14]Ginkgo has been tested in the treatment of hearing and balance problems andfound to have potential benefit. Cats with damage to their balance systemsshowed faster recoveries if ginkgo was added to their diet, while guinea pigsexposed to loud noises and given ginkgo had less damage to their hearing nervesthan those left untreated.15 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col21-nts15],16 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col21-nts16] A study in people withepisodes of dizziness and ringing in their ears demonstrated some improvement inboth symptoms after taking ginkgo for several months.17[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col21-nts17]A potentially important application of ginkgo is in the prevention of mountainsickness. In a report from France, mountain climbers on a Himalayan expeditionwho took ginkgo weathered the high altitude much better than their colleaguesgiven a placebo.18 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col21-nts18] None of thesubjects hiking to over fifteen thousand feet taking ginkgo developed acutebrain mountain sickness, compared to over 40 percent in the control group.Breathing problems were six times as likely in climbers who took a placebo as inthose on ginkgo. The mountain climbers on ginkgo also had fewer problems withthe blood vessel changes that lead to frostbite.Ginkgo has also been used in the treatment of asthma, with studies showing itcan reduce the severity of wheezing caused by exercise, dust, and pollen.19[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col21-nts19] One of ginkgo’s pharmacologicaleffects is to inhibit a natural inflammatory chemical called platelet activatingfactor (PAF), which has been implicated in asthma and allergies.Another potential use for ginkgo is in the treatment of sexual dysfunctionassociated with antidepressant medications. Although the new antidepressantmedicines are often very effective in improving mood, they may cause sexualdysfunction in both men and women. A recent report from San Francisco found thatginkgo was effective in improving all four phases of the sexual response(desire, excitement, orgasm, and resolution) in 91 percent of women and 76percent of men.20 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col21-nts20] Consideringthe recent frenzy created by Viagra, further testing of ginkgo is warranted inpeople with sexual potency problems from all causes to see if this safe herbalmedicine may be of value.Ginkgo has been studied in the treatment of ulcerative colitis, anxiety, andpremenstrual syndrome.21 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col21-nts21]–23[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col21-nts23] It may help enhance immunefunction, reduce oxidative stress during coronary artery surgery, and improverecovery after spinal cord injury.24[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col21-nts24]–26[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col21-nts26] It is obvious that this ancienttree has evolved a vast pharmacy of natural healing substances that we have justbegun to appreciate in modern times.THE PRACTICAL USE OF GINKGOMost people who use ginkgo have concerns about their memory. This may show up asdifficulty with concentration, trouble recalling names, or simple forgetfulness.Most of the time these minor concerns do not represent a serious neurologicalcondition, and it is reasonable to try ginkgo for a few months before undergoinga formal memory evaluation. If someone has been diagnosed with Alzheimer’sdisease, a trial of ginkgo is warranted under the supervision of a physician whois familiar with this illness.The use of ginkgo in intermittent claudication should be discussed with yourdoctor to be certain that other treatments are not more appropriate. Forsymptoms of dizziness or ringing in the ears, be certain to have a medicalevaluation to rule out treatable specific causes before starting ginkgo. Therisks of taking ginkgo for sexual dysfunction are very low, but we recommend youdiscuss its use with your health-care provider if you are taking any prescribedmedications.HOW TO USE GINKGOGinkgo products in the United States have followed the lead of Europeanmanufacturers with almost all tablets and capsules standardized to 24 percentflavone glycosides and 6 percent terpene lactones. The ginkgo extract usuallyrepresents a 50:1 concentration that provides 40 or 60 milligrams per tablet.Most studies have used between 120 and 320 milligrams on a daily basis individed doses.When you first begin ginkgo, start with 120 milligrams per day, in two or threedivided doses. Wait at least a month to assess the effects before graduallyincreasing the dose by 40 milligrams per day.AYURVEDA AND GINKGODespite its ancient Asian heritage, ginkgo was not described in the ancientAyurvedic texts. Its properties are similar to the Ayurvedic herb gotu kola. Thepredominant taste of ginkgo extract is bitter, with a minor sour component. Itcan be balancing to all three doshas and has a net cooling effect on thephysiology.PRECAUTIONSAlthough rare, headaches and mild digestive upset can occur in people takingginkgo. The headache is usually mild and can be minimized by starting with a lowdose. There have been two case reports of people developing bleedingcomplications while on ginkgo. One involved bleeding into the eye in aseventy-year-old man who had been taking aspirin.27[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col21-nts27] The other was a case of a youngwoman on ginkgo for two years who developed blood clots on her brain.28[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col21-nts28] No obvious explanation for thebleeding could be uncovered. Although these possible complications areexceedingly rare, it is recommended not to take ginkgo if you have any type ofbleeding condition or are taking any blood-thinning medication, includingaspirin.[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_045_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_046_r1.jpg]GLYCYRRHIZA GLABRAFAMILIAR: licoriceLATIN: Glycyrrhiza glabraSANSKRIT: yasthimadhuThe chewy black candy that many of us loved as children is derived from theroots of a plant long treasured by healing cultures across Asia, Europe, and theMediterranean. In addition to providing a sweet flavoring that is fifty timesmore intense than sugar, licorice contains a number of therapeutic medicinalsubstances. It has many potential uses in conditions of the digestive andrespiratory systems. Its intensely sweet taste makes licorice an ideal additiveto disguise other, less palatable medicines and herbs. Its name in Sanskrit,yasthimadhu, means “stick of sweetness.”Honored for thousands of years as a treatment for inflammatory conditions,modern studies have documented that licorice has steroidlike actions. Usedcautiously and with respect, licorice is a valuable healing plant, but atexcessive levels it can cause potentially dangerous side effects.BOTANICAL AND PHYTOCHEMICAL INFORMATIONThe shrub from which licorice is derived is a member of the legume family. Thisperennial plant produces small, pealike blue flowers and may reach six feet inheight. The roots are harvested and processed to yield a sugary paste that isused as a flavoring for candy and medicine.Licorice contains a number of chemical compounds including phytoestrogens,sugars, and flavonoids. The most investigated component of licorice isglycyrrhizic acid. This substance seems to be responsible for many of licorice’santi-inflammatory properties through mechanisms that have only recently beenunraveled. It appears that in the digestive tract, glycyrrhizic acid isconverted into glycyrrhetic acid. This chemical inhibits the enzyme thatmetabolizes the natural steroid cortisol, resulting in higher circulating levelsof this steroid, with its known anti-inflammatory effects.The downside of licorice’s steroidlike actions is the potential for elevatedblood pressure, because it can cause the body to retain too much sodium. Forthis reason, the medicinal use of licorice must be moderate and carefullymonitored. Licorice contains many other natural chemicals, including componentswith estrogenlike effects, immune stimulating activity, and antiviralproperties.THE SCIENCE OF LICORICEHundreds of scientific studies have been published on licorice, documenting itspotent physiological properties. It is a strong anti-inflammatory substance thatreduces pain and fever. Although its actions are related to cortisol andhydrocortisone, it does not cause ulcers in the digestive tract or suppress theproduction of blood cells as standard steroids do.1[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col22-nts1] Components of licorice functionas powerful antioxidants that may be helpful in reducing both heart disease andcancer.2 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col22-nts2], 3[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col22-nts3] Laboratory studies paint acomplex picture of the pharmacological properties of licorice. Licorice appearsto reduce elevated cholesterol levels and to prolong the clotting time ofblood.4 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col22-nts4], 5[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col22-nts5] These combined effects could bebeneficial in patients at risk for coronary artery disease. One possibleexplanation of how licorice works is that it stimulates enzymes in the liverthat neutralize toxic substances from the environment.6[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col22-nts6]A potentially important use for licorice is in the treatment of viralinfections. Studies have reported that licorice has the ability to inactivate awide range of different viruses.7[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col22-nts7] Reports from Japan havesuggested that licorice can have a beneficial impact on people with chronichepatitis B infection.8 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col22-nts8]Glycyrrhizin can stimulate the production of the potent immune-enhancingsubstance interferon and is capable of enhancing the activity of key immunecells.9 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col22-nts9], 10[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col22-nts10]The medicinal applications of licorice in people are still being explored. Oneof its traditional uses has been in the treatment of peptic ulcers, and animalstudies have shown that licorice stimulates the production of protective mucusin the stomach lining.11 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col22-nts11]Studies from over forty years ago demonstrated that licorice extracts couldpromote the healing of ulcers.12[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col22-nts12] Concerns about side effects andthe development of acid secretion blocking agents has essentially eliminated therole of licorice in the mainstream therapy of ulcers in the United States,although it remains in comparatively wide use for this purpose in Europe.Taking advantage of its blood-pressure-raising potential, researchers haveemployed licorice in the treatment of low blood pressure caused by diabetesmellitus.13 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col22-nts13] It has also been ofbenefit in the treatment of low blood pressure that is sometimes associated withchronic fatigue syndrome.14 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col22-nts14]Although there is a legitimate concern about the side effects of licorice, mostcomplications occur in people taking excessive doses. Elevated blood pressurehas been reported in men consuming 50 grams of licorice candy daily, whichcorresponds to a dosage of between 100 to 200 milligrams of glycyrrhizic acid.15[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col22-nts15] Other reports have suggestedthat people do not show any ill effects from licorice until their daily intakeof glycyrrhizic acid approaches 400 milligrams for two weeks.16[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col22-nts16] To stay within a safe range, donot consume more than 100 milligrams of glycyrrhizic acid per day. This usuallymeans taking no more than 2.5 grams of dried licorice root on a daily basis andnot using it continuously for more than four to six weeks at a time.THE PRACTICAL USE OF LICORICELicorice has traditionally been used in the treatment of coughs and colds tohelp mobilize secretions. A tea composed of equal parts licorice and freshginger provides the right balance of pungency and smoothness to loosen anddischarge mucus. Mixed with amalaki and shatavari, it is useful in the treatmentof heartburn and hyperacidity. A strong infusion made with licorice root andslippery elm is a useful soothing gargle or mouthwash for sore throats andcanker sores.We occasionally prescribe licorice to reduce the accumulated heat in womenexperiencing hot flashes during menopause. Its mild laxative action cancontribute to the efficacy of Triphala. For people trying to lose weight or stopsmoking, we suggest that they suck on natural licorice-root sticks, which cansatisfy oral cravings.For people suffering with chronic fatigue, a daily cup of licorice tea may provehelpful in generating vitality when taken upon awakening in the morning. Inother conditions where a person may be trying to decrease his or her steroidrequirement in conditions such as chronic bronchitis or asthma, a cup oflicorice-and-ginger tea two to three times daily may tip the balance in favor ofless medication. Be certain to work closely with your health-care adviser if youare using licorice more than occasionally.HOW TO USE LICORICEBulk chopped licorice root is available at most health-food stores. A tablespoonof the chopped roots or a teaspoon of the shredded roots in a cup of hot watermakes a moderately strong tea. The addition of one-quarter teaspoon of powderedlicorice root to bitter herbs makes them much more palatable.Powdered licorice in the form of capsules can be taken in doses up to 2.5 gramsper day. Most of the major herbal companies have standardized the glycyrrhizicacid content of their licorice capsules. Check the amount per capsule, and limityour total daily intake to 100 milligrams. The German Commission E recommendslimiting a course of licorice to no longer than six weeks at a time.AYURVEDA AND LICORICELicorice is predominantly sweet and bitter, with a cooling effect. Although,with its sweet taste and cooling potency, one might not anticipate its value inKapha conditions such as upper respiratory congestion, its special properties ofloosening and mobilizing mucus outweigh its potential Kapha-augmenting effects.Its heavy, sweet smoothness is balancing to Vata, while its cooling influencemakes licorice particularly useful for balancing aggravated Pitta.PRECAUTIONSDo not take licorice if you have elevated blood pressure or are taking diureticmedications. Be certain that you do not exceed the safe recommended dose. Mostlicorice root contains between 4 and 8 percent glycyrrhizic acid, so a500-milligram tablet of the dried powdered root will have 20 to 40 milligrams.Do not take unnecessary risks with this herb.[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_047_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_048_r1.jpg]GYMNEMAFAMILIAR: gurmarLATIN: Gymnema sylvestreSANSKRIT/HINDI: mehasringi, gurmarGurmar is a fascinating example of an herb that complies with the “doctrine ofsignatures.” This ancient precept postulates that nature intentionally providesclues to the medicinal value of an herb. When the leaves of gurmar are chewed,the tongue becomes insensitive to the taste of sweetness for about an hour. Thiseffect is the origin of the Hindi word for this herb, gurmar, meaning “destroyerof sweet.” Ayurvedic doctors reasoned that if this plant neutralized the effectsof sugar on the tongue, it might have a similar action in the body. Consequentlyit was given to people with diabetes mellitus and found effective in reducingthe symptoms of this common metabolic condition. Many modern studies haveconfirmed a therapeutic influence of gurmar on sugar metabolism.BOTANICAL AND PHYTOCHEMICAL INFORMATIONGymnema sylvestre is a climbing plant commonly found in the southern and centralparts of India. It has one-inch-long elliptical leaves and small yellow flowers.The leaves are the source of many unique phytochemicals, six of which have beencharacterized as gymnemic acids. Many triterpene glycosides and triterpenoidsaponins have been identified in gurmar, which may contribute to itsglucose-regulating properties. A sweetness-suppressing polypeptide calledgurmarin, consisting of thirty-five amino acids, appears to fold itself into athree-dimensional structure that binds with the sweet taste receptor, blockingthe effects of sugar on the tongue.1[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col23-nts1] The chemicals responsible forgurmar’s effects on sugar metabolism in the body remain to be characterized.THE SCIENCE OF GURMARDiabetes mellitus is a common and often disabling illness affecting almost 16million Americans. It is a condition in which sugar is not normally managed,resulting in higher blood glucose levels. Diabetes can be caused by inadequateproduction of insulin by cells in the pancreas (Type I) or by a decreasedsensitivity of cells to insulin (Type II). Chronically elevated blood sugars canlead to kidney, nerve, eye, and blood vessel damage; therefore, good control ofdiabetes is essential to reducing the risk of disabling complications. Theappropriate use of supplemental insulin and oral agents has led to markedimprovements in the lives of people with diabetes. Gurmar may be another usefulagent in therapy of this prevalent illness.Studies in animals have shown that gurmar has many different effects on themetabolism of sugar. One of the most consistent findings is the reduction ofglucose absorption from the digestive tract in animals given gurmar. Chemicalsin gurmar inhibit the uptake of sugar from the small intestines resulting in alowering of blood sugar levels.2[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col23-nts2], 3[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col23-nts3] In addition to blocking sugarabsorption, gurmar extracts have also been shown to inhibit the absorption ofoleic acid, a building block of fat in the body.4[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col23-nts4]Gurmar has other interesting effects on glucose metabolism. Components of gurmarslow the uptake of glucose into muscles and inhibit the storage of glycogen inthe liver.5 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col23-nts5], 6[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col23-nts6] Absorption of cholesterol isalso reduced.7 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col23-nts7] The net effect ofthese various actions is better sugar tolerance. Diabetic rats fed daily dosesof gurmar extracts showed lower blood sugar levels, higher insulin levels, and adoubling in the number of cells in the pancreas responsible for producinginsulin.8 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col23-nts8] If these findings areapplicable to people, gurmar could be an important advance in the treatment ofdiabetes mellitus.Although formal studies in human beings are limited, initial reports areencouraging. Patients with insulin-dependent diabetes given a daily dose of agurmar extract had a reduction in their insulin requirements and a lowering oftheir fasting glucose levels.9 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col23-nts9]Diabetic patients who did not require insulin also benefited from gurmar,showing a reduction in their blood sugar levels and a reduced need for theiroral diabetic medicines.10 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col23-nts10] Fiveof the twenty-two patients in the study were able to completely discontinuetheir medications, maintaining control solely with gurmar. These reports areintriguing and warrant further studies to define the appropriate role for gurmarin the treatment of diabetes.Another application for this herb is in the treatment of obesity.Neurophysiological studies have found that when gurmar is present on the tongue,taste nerves fail to send the information about sweetness to the brain.11[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col23-nts11] Along with its effect ondecreasing the absorption of sugar from the digestive tract, gurmar could be ahelpful nutritional aid to reduce the cravings and caloric load of people withobesity. The possible value of gurmar in reducing caloric intake was tested by asmall study that found that people given Gymnema sylvestre prior to a snack mealate less total calories than those that did not take the herb.12[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col23-nts12] A study from the 1960ssuggested that gurmar actually led to an increase in the weight of rats, butthis has not been reported in human beings.13[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col23-nts13] Given the rising incidence ofobesity in this culture and the relative lack of success of most weight-lossprograms, gurmar may represent a valuable adjunct to a balanced nutritional andexercise program for people trying to shed excessive pounds.THE PRACTICAL USE OF GURMARGurmar is currently available from a few major herbal suppliers. If you arewishing to use it as an aid in a weight-loss program, try placing a pinch onyour tongue, fifteen minutes before your meal or whenever you find yourselfabout to indulge in a sweet craving that you know is not in your best interest.In the Perfect Weight programs at the Chopra Center, we recommend that ourparticipants take a taste of gurmar before their main meals and swallow acapsule with each meal.If you have diabetes mellitus and are using gurmar as a blood-sugar-loweringagent, be certain to discuss its use with your health-care provider beforeadding it to your diet. Because gurmar has been shown to have measurableblood-glucose-lowering effects, you must closely monitor your blood sugar levelsto quantify its effects and adjust your other medications accordingly.Be sure to pay attention to the other essential components of a healthymind-body program, including a balanced diet, regular exercise, and listeningcarefully to your internal signals of hunger and satiety. Do not rely on gurmaras the sole approach to balancing your metabolism. View it as a short-term allyas you establish long-term healthy practices.HOW TO USE GURMARGurmar is available in 450-milligram capsules, standardized to 150 milligrams ofgymnemic acids. For weight control, try breaking open a tablet and placing asmall amount on your tongue. Notice how your craving for sweetness is altered asa result of the change in your taste sensations. Ingest the rest of the capsulewith your meal. Do not take more than two doses per day while monitoring yourfood intake.If you have diabetes, first consult with your health-care adviser and make thecommitment to closely monitor your blood sugar levels. Begin with one dose inthe morning and see how you feel and what your glucose levels do. Wait at leasttwo weeks before increasing your dose to twice daily, before breakfast and inthe late afternoon. Watch closely for any signs that your blood sugar is gettingtoo low.AYURVEDA AND GURMARAccording to Ayurveda, gurmar carries astringent and pungent flavors with a netheating effect on the physiology. It is pacifying to Kapha and essentiallyneutral to Pitta and Vata.In addition to its long-standing role in the treatment of diabetes, gurmar hasalso been used in Ayurveda in the treatment of upper respiratory infections andfevers. Applied topically to skin infections, a paste of gurmar is used to drawout infection.PRECAUTIONSAlthough there have not been reports of serious hypoglycemic reactions, youshould be alert to the possibility, especially if you are takingblood-sugar-lowering medications. A problem with the regular application ofgurmar to the tongue is that sweetly flavored foods become less palatable.Therefore, use gurmar to add motivation to your weight-loss program, but putyour attention on developing good nutritional habits so that you can maintainyour appropriate weight through healthy diet and activity.[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_049_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_050_r1.jpg]HYPERICUM PERFORATUMFAMILIAR: St. John’s wort, hypericumLATIN: Hypericum perforatumOf all the herbs in the modern botanical medicine chest, few can rivalhypericum’s meteoric rise to fame. It has received enthusiastic reception fromthe lay public and grudging acceptance from the scientific medical community. Asa generally safe and effective natural remedy for the treatment of mild tomoderate depression, St. John’s wort offers an alternative to the standardantidepressant medications. It is readily available and inexpensive, and carriesminimal risk.The origin of the name St. John’s wort (wort is from Middle English for “plant”)is clouded in the mists of myth and history. Some believe the name was appliedbecause hypericum blooms in late June, around the time that John the Baptist’sbirthday is celebrated. Others say its name was a reference to the red juicefrom its petals, which presumably symbolized the blood of St. John. However itacquired its name, St. John’s wort has been an honored medicinal plant since thetime of the ancient Greeks. Popular during the Middle Ages, it has a traditionaluse in the treatment of a wide range of psychic and physical ailments, frommelancholy to varicose veins.BOTANICAL AND PHYTOCHEMICAL INFORMATIONHypericum grows wild throughout Europe and the United States. It is a perennial,sun-loving plant that grows up to three feet in height. During the summer monthsit produces numerous yellow flowers with five petals that are marked with smallblack dots and lines. The flowering tops and leaves of St. John’s wort are thesource of the medicinal constituents that are the object of intense scientificinterest.Chemical analysis of hypericum reveals many different components includingnaphthodianthrones, phloroglucinols, flavonoids, phenylpropanes,proanthocyanidins, and amino acids. The most important medicinally activeingredients, which are extracted in methanol, are found in the naphthodianthroneand phloroglucinol portions. The natural chemicals that account for hypericum’santidepressant activity are not yet fully sorted out. Hypericin, anaphthodianthrone, has been the leading candidate for several years, and almostall commercially available St. John’s wort is standardized to yield a .3 percentextract. However, several recent studies have suggested that a phloroglucinolchemical called hyperforin is the most likely constituent responsible for theantidepressant actions of St. John’s wort.1[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col24-nts1], 2[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col24-nts2] This unique chemical influencesseveral important brain neurochemicals that have been associated with mood andemotions.THE SCIENCE OF ST. JOHN’S WORTAlmost half a century ago it was discovered that people given certain drugsexperienced an improvement in their moods. Subsequent research to identify thebiochemical correlates of depression has led to important discoveries about howthe brain functions in health and illness. We now know that antidepressantmedications work by restoring the balance of neurotransmitter molecules in thebrain.Chemicals found in St. John’s wort have a significant influence on the levels ofmany important brain chemicals. Recent studies on hyperforin have shown that itincreases the levels of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine by blockingtheir reuptake by nerve cells.3 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col24-nts3]It also influences other brain chemicals, including GABA and glutamate.4[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col24-nts4]Other components of St. John’s wort may also play a role in its antidepressanteffects. Until very recently, hypericin was felt to be the active ingredient andwas thought to possibly act by inhibiting one of the enzymes that breaks downnorepinephrine, called monoamine oxidase (MAO).5[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col24-nts5] More recent studies, however,have suggested that at usual therapeutic doses, there are insufficient levels ofhypericin levels to interfere with MAO.6[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col24-nts6], 7[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col24-nts7] Other components of St. John’swort may bind to the same anti-anxiety receptors in the brain as the commontranquilizing drugs such as Valium do.8[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col24-nts8]Regardless of exactly how St. John’s wort exerts its effects, there isconvincing evidence in support of its antidepressant efficacy. More thantwenty-five studies have evaluated the effects of hypericum on depression ascompared with a placebo or a standard antidepressant medication, with mostshowing the benefit of St. John’s wort. A meta-analysis that evaluatedtwenty-three randomized clinical trials concluded that St. John’s wort was moreeffective than a placebo for mild to moderate depression, with only minor sideeffects.9 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col24-nts9] Compared with theolder tricyclic antidepressant medications, including imipramine andamitriptyline, hypericum was equally effective with fewer adverse reactions.10[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col24-nts10], 11[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col24-nts11] In addition to a reduction intheir depressive symptoms, people taking St. John’s wort usually show lessanxiety and improved sleep. Overall, between 60 and 80 percent of people respondto St. John’s wort with some improvement in their mood.12[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col24-nts12], 13[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col24-nts13] Hypericum has not yet beenstudied in comparison to the newer selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)antidepressant medications such as fluoxetine (Prozac) or sertraline (Zoloft).A recent report found hypericum to be useful in the condition known as seasonalaffective disorder or SAD. People with SAD become depressed during the wintermonths when there are fewer daylight hours, and one of the popular treatmentsfor SAD is exposure to bright lights for a couple of hours each morning. A studyof 168 people from England found that people taking St. John’s wort had lessanxiety, improved libido, and better sleep, whether or not they also receivedphototherapy.14 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col24-nts14]Although scientific research has been limited, hypericum has other potentiallytherapeutic properties. It has been shown to have antiviral and antibacterialactivity in laboratory studies.15[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col24-nts15]–17[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col24-nts17] Components of hypericum mayfunction as antioxidants and suppress inflammation.18[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col24-nts18], 19[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col24-nts19] Anticancer effects have alsobeen suggested for St. John’s wort.20[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col24-nts20], 21[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col24-nts21] Although we do not know if anyof these potential effects will prove to be of benefit in people, it isreassuring to know that there may be positive side effects to taking hypericum.THE PRACTICAL USE OF ST. JOHN’S WORTIt is very important to remember that depression is potentially serious, evenlife-threatening. If you are experiencing persistent sad thoughts or have evenentertained the idea of committing suicide, seek professional help immediately.Hypericum seems to provide the greatest benefit for people with mild to moderatedepression, but it will not magically elevate your mood. A beneficial effect maytake up to six weeks to be apparent, so patience is required. Although somereports have suggested that higher doses of hypericum may benefit people who donot respond to lower ones, we do not recommend going beyond the standardrecommendations unless you are under the care of a knowledgeable doctor.22[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col24-nts22] The safety of St. John’s worttaken along with standard antidepressant medications has not yet been adequatelystudied, so do not mix hypericum with your existing drug, except under thesupervision of your physician. Also, do not stop your antidepressant oranti-anxiety medicines without first discussing the matter with your health-careprovider.HOW TO USE HYPERICUMMost hypericum products contain 300 milligrams of hypericum extract,standardized to deliver .3 percent hypericin, so that each dose delivers .9milligrams. Unfortunately, studies have shown that many available compoundsdeliver substantially less than claimed on the label. In a recent Los AngelesTimes investigation, most capsules or tablets delivered 20 to 90 percent of thestated amount, although products by two companies, Nature’s Herbs and NaturesResource, actually delivered more than the label stated.23[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col24-nts23] For a complete review of thisissue, check out the hypericum Web site at www.hypericum.com[http://www.hypericum.com].The usual dose of St. John’s wort is 300 milligrams three times daily,equivalent to a daily hypericin intake of 2.7 milligrams. As noted earlier, somereports have suggested that a higher daily intake, of 600 milligrams ofhypericum extract three times daily, may provide additional benefit. With recentinformation that hyperforin rather than hypericin is the most importantantidepressant component of St. John’s wort, it makes more sense for herbalmanufacturers to standardize the newly defined chemical constituent.Although there are liquid extracts of hypericum, we prefer the standardizedsolid extracts. It may be discovered that more than one component is importantin St. John’s wort, and you are less likely to miss one if you take a productthat is closer to the whole herb.It may take as long as six weeks to experience a therapeutic benefit. We oftensee people who tried hypericum for a short time at less than the recommendeddose without noticing any benefit, but when they took it regularly at theprescribed level, a therapeutic effect was seen. If you do not see improvementafter four to six weeks, discuss your condition with your health-care providerfor other medical options, including prescribed medication.PRECAUTIONSWhen St. John’s wort was believed to act by inhibiting the enzyme monoamineoxidase (MAO), warnings were sounded about potential side effects in peopleingesting certain substances while taking the herb. Adverse reactions can occurwith MAOinhibitor antidepressant medications when people eat aged cheeses, driedsausages, alcohol, or stimulant drugs, because they contain substances thatpotentiate the effect of the medicines. Although there has been only onereported case of a possible reaction in a woman taking hypericum along with astimulant drug for a bladder problem, it is prudent not to combine St. John’swort with MAO-inhibiting antidepressants or stimulant drugs.Another commonly discussed potential complication of St. John’s wort isphotosensitivity. Sunlight can change hypericum molecules in the skin, provokingan allergic reaction. Although photosensitivity is often talked about, it hasonly been reported once in a woman who had been taking St. John’s wort for threeyears.24 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col24-nts24] The skin reactionrapidly subsided when hypericum was discontinued.Other adverse reactions are generally mild and include digestive disturbances,fatigue, headache, and restlessness. In most studies, minor side effects areseen as often in people taking a placebo as those on St. John’s wort. It is arelatively rare person who needs to discontinue the herb because of sideeffects.Do not take St. John’s wort if you are pregnant, because safety studies have notbeen done to determine whether it poses any risks to the unborn child. Do nottake St. John’s wort along with any prescription medication without firstdiscussing it with your health-care provider.[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_051_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_052_r1.jpg]LAVANDULA ANGUSTIFOLIAFAMILIAR: lavenderLATIN: Lavandula angustifoliaThe sweet and pungent beckoning aroma of lavender reminds us of its romantichistory. The early Romans used lavender to scent their baths, providing us withthe explanation for this fragrant herb’s name, which is derived from the Latinlavare, meaning “to wash.” Native to the Mediterranean, lavender was prized bythe ancient Egyptians and Turks. When brought to Europe, it found its way intochurches and monasteries, where its pure aroma was believed to ward off evilspirits and disease-causing agents. For thousands of years lavender has been apopular herb used in perfumes, soaps, and sachets.Lavender’s color, pleasant aroma, and delicate flowers contributed to itslong-standing reputation as a promoter of romance and dreamy tranquillity.Modern studies have demonstrated that many of lavender’s traditional uses arebased upon scientifically verifiable effects. Components of lavender carryantiseptic properties, while its leaves, flowers, and essential oil have adocumented calming influence on the mind.BOTANICAL AND PHYTOCHEMICAL INFORMATIONThere are twenty-eight known species of lavender, an evergreen, shrubbyperennial. It has small, slender leaves, and its flowers are spikes of aromatic,two-lobed flowers that are usually purple or blue, but can vary from soft pinkto bright pink. Depending on the species, it grows from eight to forty inches inheight, and its leaves and bracts vary from a rich green to silver gray.Lavender flowers have a bittersweet smell, while its leaves have a balsamicscent.The aromatic oil of lavender is extracted from the oil glands of the abovegroundparts of the plant. The species known for the best-quality essential oil are L.stoechas and L. angustifolia. Up to 1.5 percent of the plant is composed ofvolatile oils that contain a variety of tannins, terpenes, and coumarins.Chemicals identified in lavender, including linalyl acetate, linalool, andlavendalol have have measurable calming effects in animals.THE SCIENCE OF LAVENDERLavender oil has traditionally been used as an antiseptic, a mild sedative, anda painkiller. Modern studies have shown lavender to have an antiseptic effect onboth bacteria and fungi.1 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col25-nts1], 2[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col25-nts2] This property has been exploitedto treat conditions ranging from wound infections to diaper rash. As a componentof mouthwash, lavender may also reduce the chance for gum infections.Midwives have extolled the virtues of lavender since the Middle Ages. It wasburned in delivery rooms to reduce infections and used in sitz baths to soothediscomfort after delivery. Recent studies have suggested that lavender oil addedto a bath may reduce some of a woman’s discomfort after childbirth, providingtentative support for one of its traditional applications.3[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col25-nts3]Lavender is most widely recommended for its sedative properties. An Austrianstudy showed that lavender oil and two of its components had pronouncedtranquilizing effects in mice.4 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col25-nts4]At sufficient concentrations, lavender was not only sedating in normal mice buthad a substantial calming effect in animals that were previously given astimulating dose of caffeine. A French report found that lavender oil wassedating, but that its efficacy diminished after five days.5[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col25-nts5] An animal study from Englandshowed that lavender was even able to reduce stress and travel sickness inpigs.6 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col25-nts6]Although lavender has been used to calm human minds for millennia, its sedatinginfluence in people has not been well documented. Following the French penchantfor fragrances, a study from Lyon, France, reported that people exposed tolavender oil had reductions in several physiological measures of stress.7[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col25-nts7] In an English report, patientsadmitted to an intensive-care unit were studied to see if there were benefits ofadding lavender oil to massage therapy. Although no objective differences werefound between those that did and did not experience the aromatherapy, patientswho were exposed to lavender reported less anxiety and a better mood.8[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col25-nts8]A novel use for lavender oil was recently described by a Scottish group ofresearchers who applied essential oils including lavender, thyme, rosemary, andcedarwood to the scalps of people with a condition known as alopecia areata.People with this problem, usually resulting from an autoimmune inflammatoryprocess, lose patches of hair. This study, in which essential oils were massagedinto patients’ bald spots, reported improvement in over 40 percent of thosereceiving the essential oils, compared with only 15 percent treated with anon-herbalized carrier oil.9 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col25-nts9]THE PRACTICAL USE OF LAVENDERIn ancient herbal compendiums, lavender was reported to reduce the sting ofinsect bites, cool the pain of burns, soothe sore throats, relieve headaches,and calm stomach upsets. Applied to emotional concerns, lavender has atraditional role in the treatment of insomnia, anxiety, and melancholia. Watermade from lavender flowers, applied as a skin toner, renews cells and treatsacne. This multitalented plant can aid in digestive problems ranging from agassy stomach to bad breath.Lavender aromatherapy provides a subtle soothing influence. We regularlyrecommend adding drops of lavender fragrance to massage and facial oils toencourage relaxation. At the Chopra Center we apply eye packs and warmedshoulder pillows scented with lavender for relaxation before treatments.Lavender is an important component of our sleep routine, in which we recommend afew drops of the essential oil added to a bath before bed. As a component of ourprenatal program, new mothers are encouraged to take lavender sitz baths aftergiving birth, to soothe irritated tissues. Lavender tea is beneficial to calmmild anxiety.HOW TO USE LAVENDERAs a tea for anxiety, tension headaches, and depression, steep two teaspoons ofdried lavender flowers in one cup of boiling water. Add a few drops of lavenderessential oil to a neutral massage oil and apply to the temples and nape of theneck for neck strain and headaches. A drop of the undiluted essential oil can beapplied directly to insect bites and stings to relieve burning.For mild digestive upsets, try adding a few drops of lavender oil to a sugarcube and allow it to slowly dissolve in your mouth. For irritated tissues ormuscles, add five to ten drops to your bath water. As a sleeping aid, diffusethe essential oil in your bedroom, or keep a lavender flower sachet on yourpillow. Children who are having trouble settling down to sleep often respond tothis approach.AYURVEDA AND LAVENDERAlthough lavender was not known to the original Ayurvedic doctors, its herbalenergetics can be understood in Ayurvedic terms. Its mildly pungent taste andslightly cooling influence make it a useful herb for all three mind-bodyconstitutions. Lavender oil pacifies both Pitta and Kapha and has a balancingeffect on Vata. It can calm an agitated mind without creating undue dullness.PRECAUTIONSOther than a rare skin sensitivity to the essential oil, this gentle plant has ahigh safety profile.[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_053_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_054_r1.jpg]LINUM USITATISSIMUMFAMILIAR: flaxseed, linseedLATIN: Linum usitatissimumSANSKRIT: umaFlax has been part of the diets of human beings since the dawn of civilization.Archeologists have discovered irrigation systems in seven-thousand-year-oldMesopotamian cities that supported the cultivation of flax. Flax was one of themajor sources of clothing fiber until the late eighteenth century, when cottonbecame popular. Native to the temperate regions of Asia and Europe, flax wasintroduced to North America in the early 1600s, and it flourished there. It isnow grown throughout the world as a source of food, fiber, and oil.Flaxseeds are a valuable health-promoting nutritional substance. In addition toproviding a rich source of both soluble and insoluble fiber, flax suppliesimportant omega-3 fatty acids and phytoestrogens. In the Ayurvedic tradition,flax has been used in the treatment of respiratory disorders, digestivecomplaints, and urinary tract irritations. Hippocrates described the benefits offlaxseed in the treatment of abdominal cramping in the seventh century B.C.BOTANICAL AND PHYTOCHEMICAL INFORMATIONFlax is an annual plant that grows two to four feet in height. It has arelatively thin stalk with elongated leaves and attractive blue or whiteflowers. Each small fruit yields ten yellowish to dark brown seeds, which areharvested in early autumn. The seeds are odorless, with an outer mucilaginouswall that swells when exposed to water.Flaxseeds consist of 20 percent protein, 40 percent fat, and 28 percent fiber,with the remainder composed of water, vitamins, and minerals. Abundant inpolyunsaturated fatty acids, flaxseeds are among the richest natural sources ofalpha-linolenic acid (ALA), an omega-3 fatty acid that has been shown to helplower cholesterol levels and dampen inflammatory reactions.THE SCIENCE OF FLAXSEEDSeveral studies have indicated a beneficial role for flaxseed on health. Addingflaxseed to the diet may help lower serum cholesterol levels in both animals andhuman beings. A recent study in rabbits showed that supplementing their dietwith flaxseeds reduced the deposition of fat into major blood vessels by overtwo-thirds, even when the alpha-linolenic component was removed.1[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col26-nts1] In another recent studyinvolving rabbits, a phytoestrogen component of flaxseed, SDG, was found toreduce serum cholesterol, increase HDL cholesterol (the “good” cholesterol), andreduce the amount of atherosclerosis.2[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col26-nts2]Studies in people have also suggested some benefit from flaxseed in loweringcholesterol levels. In a Canadian study of people with high cholesterol levelsgiven muffins with 50 grams of defatted flaxseed each day, there was a small butsignificant reduction in total and LDL cholesterol levels.3[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col26-nts3] In another report of peopleconsuming 50 grams of flaxseed daily, there was a reduction in their LDLcholesterol levels of 8 percent after only one month.4[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col26-nts4] Although not every study hasshown a definite benefit of flaxseed on cholesterol levels, most reports havesuggested that flaxseed provides a safe and moderately effective way to lowerone of the major risk factors for heart disease.In addition to serving as a source of omega-3 fatty acids, flaxseed is thehighest natural supplier of lignans, which are a type of phytoestrogen. Severalstudies in animals have suggested that the lignans in flaxseed have protectiveeffects against hormonally sensitive tumors, particularly breast cancer, butalso colon cancer and malignant melanoma.5[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col26-nts5]–7[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col26-nts7] Lignans are known to alter themetabolism of sex hormones, which may partially explain their beneficial role incancer.8 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col26-nts8] Although we do not yetknow how and to what extent flaxseed can influence our susceptibility to cancer,there is convincing evidence in human beings that adding flaxseed to the diethas potentially important effects on hormone levels.9[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col26-nts9]A potentially useful role for flaxseed is in the treatment of inflammatoryconditions. In animal studies, the high concentration of omega-3 fatty acids inflaxseed has been shown to reduce inflammatory prostaglandins. This property hasbeen tested in people in two autoimmune inflammatory conditions: rheumatoidarthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosis (SLE). In a report from Finlandof twenty-two patients with RA, the addition of flaxseed to their diet did notprove beneficial in reducing their symptoms.10[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col26-nts10] In a Canadian study of ninepeople with inflammatory problems in their kidneys resulting from SLE, flaxseedresulted in many positive changes, including improvements in kidney function, areduction in inflammatory chemicals in the blood, and lower cholesterollevels.11 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col26-nts11] Clearly, furtherresearch is indicated to assess the potential role of flaxseed in combatinginflammatory and autoimmune disorders.THE PRACTICAL USE OF FLAXSEEDAdding flaxseed to your diet is one of the easiest and least expensive ways toenhance your health. In addition to the potential benefits of flaxseed inreducing your risk for cardiovascular disease and cancer, flaxseed is anexcellent source of fiber that improves bowel function.12[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col26-nts12] You can use whole flaxseeds, orgrind them in a coffee grinder. Flaxseed can be added to granola, sprinkled onsautéed vegetables or combined with wheat flour for breads and muffins. Wholeflaxseed can be stored at room temperature for up to a year. Milled flaxseedshould be refrigerated once ground and used within one month.Several farms and dairies are adding flaxseed to the feed of chickens and cowsin order to increase the amount of omega-3 fatty acids in eggs and milk. It willbe interesting to see if these food products can help lower cholesterol levels.Traditionally, flaxseed has been used as a poultice for skin infections andabscesses. A few tablespoonfuls are wrapped in a white cotton bandage and boiledin water until the seeds are soft. They are then applied to the wound andcovered for fifteen minutes every few hours. The flaxseed has a drawing effectand maintains heat in the area to increase circulation.HOW TO USE FLAXSEEDFlaxseeds are readily available in health-food stores and many grocery stores.The usual dosage in studies that have shown a benefit from the addition offlaxseed is 50 grams per day, providing about 6 grams of dietary fiber. Fiftygrams is equivalent to about one-quarter cup of flaxseeds daily. Use flaxseedsliberally in your cooking and baking, and your body will benefit.AYURVEDA AND FLAXSEEDAccording to Ayurveda, raw flaxseeds are soothing and emollient, whereas roastedseeds have a drier, hotter quality. Flaxseeds carry the primary tastes of sweetand astringent, with a heating potency. They are pacifying to Vata, but may bemildly aggravating to Pitta and Kapha when taken in high dosages.PRECAUTIONSAs a component of human diets for thousands of years, flaxseed is a very safenutritional product. Respiratory allergies have been reported in textile workerswho inhale the fibers of flax, but this is not relevant to the internalingestion of the seeds. Flaxseed acts as a mild bulk laxative, similar topsyllium. It is more appropriately used as a preventive bowel tonic than for theacute treatment of constipation.[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_055_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_056_r1.jpg]MELALEUCA ALTERNIFOLIAFAMILIAR: tea treeLATIN: Melaleuca alternifoliaThe tea tree has been valued by Australian Aborigines since before recordedhistory. Its name is attributed to the eighteenth-century English explorerCaptain James Cook, who added the leaves of the tree to an herbal brew in orderto make his crew’s beer more palatable. A century and a half later, anAustralian surgeon described the use of tea tree oil as an antiseptic to reducesurgical infections. A resurgence of interest in tea tree has been fueled bystudies over the past ten years, which have confirmed its value as an effectiveand safe natural germicidal agent in a wide range of conditions from acne toathlete’s foot.BOTANICAL AND PHYTOCHEMICAL INFORMATIONThere are over three hundred members of the melaleuca family, but it isMelaleuca alternifolia that has risen to prominence for its beneficial essentialoil. A rapidly growing evergreen tree that reaches twenty-five feet in height,it has a soft, papery bark with clusters of small white flowers. Native tosoutheast Australia, tea trees are now grown commercially in Africa, CentralAmerica, and India.The essential oil of tea tree is obtained from the leaves through steamdistillation. It contains a number of terpenes, of which terpinen-4-ol isbelieved to be responsible for its beneficial anti-infective activity. Othervolatile constituents, including limonene, alpha-terpinen, cineole, andaromadendrene, are present in lower concentrations and appear responsible forthe occasional skin irritations that are reported by people sensitive to teatree oil. Trees that produce high levels of terpinen-4-ol are being propagatedin order to maximize the therapeutic-to-toxic ratio of essential oilcomponents.1 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col27-nts1]THE SCIENCE OF TEA TREE OILTea tree oil first played an important role in Western society during World WarII, when it was added to machinery oil for equipment used in weapons production.The antibiotic properties of tea tree were said to reduce the infections infactory workers who injured their hands on the munitions production line. Thecommercial development of Australian tea tree farms in the early 1980sstimulated scientific research into its therapeutic effects. Many studiespublished within the past decade have documented unique beneficial qualities oftea tree oil.Tea tree has demonstrated value in the treatment of fungal skin infections. Astudy evaluating the benefit of a 10-percent tea tree oil cream applied topeople with athlete’s foot caused by the fungus Tinea pedis showed that thecream resulted in clinical improvement in over 60 percent of people, and thefungus was completely eliminated in about 30 percent.2[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col27-nts2] A study from New York looked atthe role of tea tree in the treatment of the most common nail fungus calledonychomycosis and found that tea tree oil was as effective as the most popularpharmaceutical medicine.3 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col27-nts3]Laboratory studies looking at tea tree oil’s potency against a wide range ofpotential disease-causing fungal organisms have shown it to be efficacious atconcentrations readily achieved by applying the oil to the skin.4[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col27-nts4]Tea tree oil has been consistently effective against different species ofcandida. This ubiquitous yeast can cause both vaginal and oral infections, andis capable of invading deeper tissues if a person’s immune system iscompromised. Studies from the Netherlands have demonstrated that tea tree oil isactive against most species of candida, even after it has been diluted in asuppository.5 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col27-nts5] As a component ofa mouthwash, it may be helpful in the treatment of oral candida infections.Tea tree oil is also effective against a wide range of bacteria. It has beenstudied as a potential antimicrobial agent in the treatment of skin infectionsand has been found active against many potentially harmful bacteria. Tea treeoil seems to have a selective effect against potentially harmful bacteria whileonly minimally interfering with the normal bacteria that usually inhabit ourskin.6 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col27-nts6] It is active against thegerms that cause acne and has been shown to be as effective as the most commonlyused topical acne medication, benzoyl peroxide.7[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col27-nts7], 8[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col27-nts8] Although tea tree takes somewhatlonger to act, it has fewer negative side effects.Tea tree oil has been studied in the treatment of burns. It is effective inreducing some of the common infections encountered in burn units, but otherpotentially serious germs are not sensitive to tea tree oil.9[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col27-nts9] Therefore it is not recommendedfor patients with severe scaldings, but may still have value in the treatment ofminor burn injuries.A potentially important use for tea tree oil is in reducing the spread ofmethicillin-resistant staphylococcus infections (MRSAs). This virulent bacteriais commonly found in hospitals and nursing homes, where it is often spread bystaff members. In an Australian study, all sixty-six samples of MRSA weresensitive to tea tree oil at relatively low concentrations. Adding tea tree oilto hand-washing lotions may provide a safe and effective alternative to thechemical antibacterial soaps currently in widespread use.10[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col27-nts10]THE PRACTICAL USE OF TEA TREE OILTea tree oil is finding its way into an expanding range of health-care products.As an essential oil, it can be applied directly to fungal skin infections suchas athlete’s foot. Most people tolerate the direct application of pure tea treeoil, although occasionally it results in a skin reaction requiring itsdiscontinuation. The oil can also be directly applied to acne sores, but again,if irritation develops, it should be stopped. As a component of a lotion orcream, tea tree oil can be applied to minor cuts, abrasions, and burns.Tea tree oil is showing up in toothpaste and mouthwash. You can make your ownsolution by adding drops of tea tree oil to water for use as a mouthwash orthroat gargle. Deodorants, shampoos, throat lozenges, soaps, and evenanimal-care products with tea tree oil are now being sold in the marketplace.Capitalizing on its potency against candida, douches and suppositoriescontaining tea tree oil are potentially useful for the treatment of vaginalyeast infections. Tea tree is active against another common vaginal infectiousagent, trichomonas. A study from the 1960s suggested that a vaginal douche withtea tree oil could be useful in the treatment of cervical and vaginalinfections, but needed to be applied weekly for four to six weeks.11[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col27-nts11] Tea tree oil vaginalsuppositories are currently available and may be effective, but can occasionallycause vaginal irritation that may be difficult to distinguish from the symptomsof the original infection.12 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col27-nts12] Ifitching and a discharge persist after five days, the tea tree product should bediscontinued and medical advice sought.HOW TO USE TEA TREE OILEvery household should keep some tea tree oil close at hand. It can be applieddirectly to skin irritations, or diluted into a bland cream or lotion. It mixeswell with a vitamin E cream or aloe vera gel for minor abrasions and burns. Addten drops of tea tree oil to four ounces of warm water, and use as a gargle ormouthwash. If you are using tea tree oil in the treatment of athlete’s foot orother minor fungal infections, apply it twice daily and observe the problem areato see if there is improvement after several days of usage. For stubborn fungalinfections, application of tea tree oil may be necessary for months until theproblem is resolved. Commercially available skin creams containing tea tree canbe useful to treat and prevent diaper rash, but watch your baby’s skin closelyto ensure that he or she is not developing a negative reaction.AYURVEDA AND TEA TREE OILFrom an Ayurvedic perspective, tea tree oil carries the bitter, pungent,astringent, and sweet tastes. It cools the inflammation of Pitta, clears thecongestion of Kapha, and is essentially neutral toward Vata. Tea tree oil has anet cooling influence on the system.PRECAUTIONSUp to ten percent of people may have a skin sensitivity to tea tree oil.13[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col27-nts13] Although the chemicalconstituent cineole is usually held responsible, several other components canalso be irritating in susceptible people.14[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col27-nts14] A tea made from the leaves ofthe tea tree is commonly used by Aboriginal natives, but generally should beavoided due to concerns about toxicity. A case has been reported of accidentalpoisoning in a two-year-old boy who ingested two teaspoons of tea tree oil. Thesymptoms were mental confusion and unsteadiness that resolved after fivehours.15 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col27-nts15][images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_057_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_058_r1.jpg]MUCUNA PRURIENSFAMILIAR: atmagupta, cowage, cowitch plantLATIN: Mucuna pruriensSANSKRIT: atmagupta, kapikacchu, vanariThe ancient Ayurvedic physician Sushruta described atmagupta as one of thepremiere rejuvenative substances for both men and women. It has been considereda powerful aphrodisiac for thousands of years, which, according to Ayurveda,implies enhancing both sexual potency and fertility. Atmagupta is held in highesteem as a tonic herb to reverse the aging process. Modern studies havedemonstrated a therapeutic role for it in the treatment of Parkinson’s diseaseand diabetes, which may partially explain its reputation as a vitality-restoringherb.As a member of the legume family, atmagupta is a nutritionally rich substancecontaining over 25 percent protein.1[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col28-nts1] It is also a rich source ofcomplex carbohydrates and fiber. It contains many unique alkaloids that havereceived only preliminary scientific investigation. The efficacy of atmagupta inthe treatment of Parkinson’s disease is due in part to its ability to generateL-dopa (L-dihydroxyphenylalanine) from simpler amino acids. The pharmacologicalmechanisms of its other demonstrated medicinal properties, from lowering bloodsugar to treating snakebite, remain to be elucidated.BOTANICAL AND PHOTOCHEMICAL INFORMATIONMucuna pruriens is a climbing legume that thrives in tropical climates. It growswild in India and the Caribbean, and has been identified in southern Florida.The name pruriens (from the Latin prurire, to itch) refers to the irritationcaused by tiny barbs on its pods that attach to the skin of unsuspectingharvesters. Ayurvedic doctors use the processed pods to treat internalparasites, but it is the inner seed that is the primary medicinal product.The plant is an annual climber with slender vines and clusters of three leaves.It produces inch-and-a-half-wide flowers that yield the two- to three-inch-longcurved pods containing the dark seeds. Several unique alkaloids, includingmucunine, mucunadine, prurienine, and prurieninine, have been identified inatmagupta, as well as a variety of organic acids, sterols, tannins, and L-dopaand other amino acids. The complex sugars of atmagupta are broken down withboiling, but the L-dopa content is not substantially affected.2[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col28-nts2]THE SCIENCE OF ATMAGUPTAAlthough atmagupta has been traditionally extolled as a rejuvenative substance,scientific investigation into this tonic herb has been in two main areas, thetreatment of Parkinson’s disease and the treatment of diabetes mellitus.Although Parkinson’s disease was first described in the West by James Parkinsonin the early nineteenth century, a neurological condition that included tremor,slow movements, and muscle stiffness was known to ancient Ayurvedic doctors asKampavata.3 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col28-nts3] We now attributethis disabling degenerative condition to diminishing amounts of the naturalbrain chemical dopamine. The most effective modern treatment for this illness isto enhance the production of dopamine by providing its precursor chemical,L-dopa, which is converted in the brain to dopamine. Atmagupta has the naturalability to generate L-dopa in concentrations up to 6 percent of its dry weightwhen grown under ideal conditions.4[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col28-nts4] A recent scientific study ofsixty patients with Parkinson’s disease found that those taking atmagupta showedsubstantial reductions in their symptoms and improvement in their overallquality of life within twelve weeks of treatment.5[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col28-nts5] This confirmed an earlier reportof twenty-three patients given atmagupta who demonstrated benefits in everyaspect of the illness, including reduction in muscle stiffness and tremors,along with improvements in walking, dressing, and speech function.6[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col28-nts6] An interesting aspect of thisstudy was the recognition that the calculated dose of L-dopa was generally lowerthan is usually required to see a therapeutic effect, and conventional sideeffects were noticeably absent. These observations suggest that otherunidentified constituents of atmagupta may have therapeutic value and help tocounteract the side effects of the “active” chemicals.Atmagupta has also shown potential medicinal benefit in the treatment ofdiabetes mellitus. Diabetic rabbits given atmagupta had significant reductionsin their blood sugar levels.7 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col28-nts7] Astudy published over thirty years ago in rats found that atmagupta reduced bothblood glucose and cholesterol levels.8[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col28-nts8] Although Mucuna pruriens hasbeen used classically to stabilize metabolic function in people, scientificresearch has not yet been focused on its value in the treatment of diabetes inhuman beings.An interesting study reported from London looked at the effects of Mucunapruriens on the treatment of snakebite. Although, fortunately, this is not acommon concern in most Western countries, it is a recurring health problem inmany tropical regions of the world. Some snake venoms act by causing the bloodto clot, and effective herbal approaches, including atmagupta, have been shownto act by inhibiting the clotting cascade.9[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col28-nts9] The potential benefit ofatmagupta on a whole range of clotting disorders remains to be explored.Science has just scratched the surface of the therapeutic potential ofatmagupta. Its role in the treatment of impotency and infertility is an area ofgreat potential value, and its traditional use as a rejuvenative substance isworthy of serious scientific evaluation.THE PRACTICAL USE OF ATMAGUPTAAtmagupta is traditionally used as a tonic for men and women in conditions oflow energy and reduced sexual desire or potency. A teaspoon of the powderedseeds is mixed in sweetened warm milk. It is a common component of Ayurvedicrejuvenative formulas that include ashwagandha, shatavari, or amalaki. It can betaken on a daily basis or prior to an anticipated intimate encounter.Studies using atmagupta for Parkinson’s disease have used starting doses ofapproximately 5 grams, gradually increasing the amount as needed. If you haveParkinson’s disease, discuss the use of atmagupta with your health-care providerbefore using it. The interaction of atmagupta with standard Parkinson’s diseasemedications has not been studied, and therefore adding this herbal medicineshould only be done under close medical supervision. Atmagupta is used in lowerdoses as a rejuvenating substance and has a long-established traditional historyof safety.HOW TO USE ATMAGUPTAAtmagupta is not yet readily available in the West, although it is finding itsway into more Ayurvedic herbal mixtures. It is usually combined with ashwagandhaas part of a male potency formula, where it is present in doses of 100 to 200milligrams. Powdered atmagupta is also available from a few herbal importers.The suggested dose to enhance vitality is 1 teaspoon daily, mixed in warm milk.AYURVEDA AND ATMAGUPTAAtmagupta carries the sweet and bitter tastes. It has a warming effect on thephysiology and is useful in balancing all three doshas. In excess, it canincrease Kapha and Pitta. It is a valuable Vata balancing tonic.PRECAUTIONSThe pods of Mucuna pruriens can cause pronounced itching. In a 1985 case, aHispanic New Jersey couple developed an irritating rash as a result of exposureto what they called “voodoo beans.”10[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col28-nts10] The emergency medicaltechnician and the emergency room nurse who treated them developed the same skinirritation. The beans were later identified as Mucuna pruriens. The inner seeds,which are used medicinally, do not have an irritating effect.An outbreak of toxic psychosis was reported from Mozambique in 1990.11[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col28-nts11] During a time of severe famine,residents of a rural district developed headache and confusion, attributed tothe consumption of excessive amounts of Mucuna pruriens seeds as a source ofnourishment. Because of a water shortage, the seeds were not properly cooked,which contributed to the toxic effects.Although these rare complications are interesting, they are clearly extreme andnot relevant to the usual therapeutic use of atmagupta, which has a high safetyprofile as a rejuvenative tonic. Caution should be exercised if you are takingit with any other medications that may act upon the nervous system.[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_059_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_060_r1.jpg]OCIMUM SANCTUMFAMILIAR: holy basil, sacred basilLATIN: Ocimum sanctumSANSKRIT: Tulsi, TulasiHoly basil has both medicinal and spiritual significance in Ayurveda. It issacred to Lord Vishnu, the Hindu god of preservation, and is consideredpurifying to body, mind, and spirit. A living tulsi plant is kept in many Indianhomes, where it is endowed with a sacred aura and believed to provide divineprotection for the household. Rosaries made from its cut stems are commonly usedas meditation beads.Closely related to the sweet basil plant widely available in the West, holybasil has been used as a valued culinary and medicinal herb. Its traditional usehas been in the treatment of colds and flus, where its purifying actions arebelieved to cleanse the respiratory tract of toxins. It is also helpful in therelief of digestive gas and bloating. Recent scientific reports have confirmedthe healing properties of holy basil in medical conditions ranging from diabetesto cancer.BOTANICAL AND PHYTOCHEMICAL INFORMATIONBasil is found on almost every continent, although Ocimum sanctum is native tothe Indian subcontinent. It grows to about eighteen inches in height, with ovalserrated leaves and delicate lavender-colored flowers. The plant is an annual inthe wild but can be maintained as a perennial by trimming it before it isallowed to form seeds. The fruit consists of tiny rust-colored nuts.The leaves are the richest source of essential oil, which contains eugenol,nerol, camphor, and a variety of terpenes and flavonoids. A recent analysis ofholy basil oil revealed five fatty acids, including stearic, palmitic, oleic,linoleic, and linolenic. The triglyceride component was found to have potentanti-inflammatory properties. The oil is antiseptic against a wide range ofdisease-causing organisms including bacteria, fungi, and parasites. Both water-and alcohol-based extracts of basil leaves have demonstrated pharmacologicalactivity.THE SCIENCE OF TULSIHoly basil oil has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity. Several studieshave demonstrated that constituents of holy basil can neutralize free radicalsand inhibit the production of inflammatory prostaglandins.1[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col29-nts1], 2[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col29-nts2] An animal study found an extractof holy basil to be essentially equivalent to a standard dose of aspirin.3[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col29-nts3] These effects may explain one oftulsi’s traditional roles in the treatment of pain and arthritis.The antioxidant properties of holy basil may also underlie its effectiveness indampening the effects of stress on the physiology. A study in rats subjected torestraint stress found that those taking holy basil had less derangement intheir biochemistry than did animals receiving a placebo.4[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col29-nts4] In addition to its ability todampen the chemical changes of stress, holy basil also appears to influence theneurochemistry of the brain in a manner similar to antidepressant medications.5[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col29-nts5] Holy basil has even been shownto reduce the levels of stress hormones produced when an animal is subjected tochronic noise stress.6 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col29-nts6]These interesting pharmacological properties have recently been applied todifferent clinical situations with potentially important results. A number ofstudies have looked at the ability of holy basil to protect healthy cells fromthe toxicity associated with radiation and chemotherapy for cancer.7[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col29-nts7], 8[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col29-nts8] Components of holy basilconsistently limited the damage that radiation causes to the bone marrow anddigestive tract in animals. When the cells were looked at microscopically, thoseanimals that received holy basil had less chromosomal damage than those thatreceived a placebo.9 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col29-nts9]Holy basil has also been shown to protect the heart from damage caused by awidely used chemotherapy drug, adriamycin.10[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col29-nts10] It seems to work by protectingcomponents of heart and liver cells from oxidative damage caused by freeradicals generated by the chemotherapy. Other studies have shown holy basil tohave a protective effect against chemical carcinogens.11[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col29-nts11], 12[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col29-nts12] Adding to its potential valuein the prevention and treatment of cancer, holy basil has also been shown toenhance different aspects of the immune response in animals.13[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col29-nts13]Another medical condition that holy basil may benefit is diabetes. Animalstudies have shown holy basil to have substantial blood-sugar-lowering effects,similar to standard oral diabetes medications.14[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col29-nts14], 15[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col29-nts15] It also appears capable oflowering cholesterol and triglyceride levels.16[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col29-nts16] Diabetes is one of the fewareas where holy basil has been formally tested in people. In a recent study offorty patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), peopletaking 2.5 grams of dried tulsi leaf powder every morning showed significantreductions in their blood glucose levels first thing in the morning as well asafter their meals.17 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col29-nts17] Inaddition to lower glucose levels, they also had a mild reduction in theircholesterol levels. This simple intervention could have a substantial impact onthis common health problem, particularly in regions where expensive diabetesmedication is out of reach for many people.One of tulsi’s traditional uses has been in the treatment of digestive disordersranging from heartburn to bloating. Studies in animals have suggested that thereis a scientific basis to these long-standing claims. Holy basil has been shownto have significant anti-ulcer activity.18[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col29-nts18] It reduces the effect of pepticacid or irritating drugs on the stomach lining and increases the production ofprotective stomach mucus.19 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col29-nts19]This popular plant has many potential therapeutic applications. In addition tothe uses reviewed above, tulsi may possess useful antibiotic activity, have ablood-pressure-lowering effect, and be effective as a birth-control agent. Thissacred healing plant deserves further scientific attention.THE PRACTICAL USE OF HOLY BASILTulsi leaves are traditionally used to make a strong tea for the treatment ofcolds, flus, and sore throats. Fresh, dried, or powdered leaves are taken aftermeals to soothe digestive upset. The extract can be applied directly to acnelesions, where its antibiotic effect hastens healing. The juice of the freshleaves can also be applied topically to skin conditions ranging from allergicrashes to athlete’s foot.If you are taking holy basil for its stress-relieving properties, I recommendyou obtain seeds or cuttings and grow your own plant. Place the seeds betweenwarm, moist paper towels for a day and then bury them a half-inch under thesurface in rich potting soil. A sprout will break through within ten days. Onceit reaches about a foot in height, pinch back any flowers to keep it from goingto seed, or allow it to seed and start a new generation. Nibble on a few leavesevery day for their health-promoting effects.HOW TO USE HOLY BASILMost Indian food stores carry tulsi leaves in a dried or powdered form. If youare taking holy basil for a specific health concern, such as diabetes orindigestion, take a standard dose of one-half teaspoon three times daily aftermeals. If you are using it as a nutritional aid while undergoing chemotherapy,prepare a strong holy basil tea by placing one tablespoon of dried leaves perpint of hot water and sipping it throughout the day, aiming to drink two to fourpints within twenty-four hours. If you are inspired to grow your own plant, useholy basil freely in your cooking as well as in the making of freshly brewedtea.If you cannot find holy basil (Ocimum sanctum), common sweet basil (Ocimumbasilicum) is a reasonable substitute. Although not as extensively studied asholy basil, sweet basil does appear to share many of the same phytochemical andmedicinal properties.TULSI AND AYURVEDAAccording to Ayurveda, Tulsi creates purity and lightness in the body. Itcarries the bitter, pungent, and astringent tastes, and generates a warminginfluence on the physiology. It has a sweet post-digestive effect. Its effect onthe doshas is predominantly Kapha-reducing, but it can be used to pacify Vataand Pitta as well. In severely overheated individuals, Tulsi can have a mildlyPitta-aggravating effect.PRECAUTIONSHoly basil is generally a very safe healing herb. Studies from the 1970ssuggested that holy basil might have a mild anti-fertility effect in animals.Although this has not been shown to occur in people, if you are pregnant ortrying to become pregnant, do not take medicinal doses of holy basil.[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_061_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_062_r1.jpg]PHYLLANTHUS NIRURIFAMILIAR: phyllanthusLATIN: Phyllanthus niruri, Phyllanthus amanusSANSKRIT: bhumyaamalaki, bahupatraKnown for thousands of years to Ayurvedic doctors, phyllanthus has beenrespected as a detoxifing herb throughout Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Ithas been used in conditions ranging from recurrent fevers to skin disorders tohiccups. Ayurvedic physicians recognized the ability of phyllanthus to reducethe jaundice associated with liver ailments. Recent scientific investigationshave supported the role of phyllanthus as a liver protectant, particularly inresponse to the hepatitis B virus.BOTANICAL AND PHYTOCHEMICAL INFORMATIONPhyllanthus niruri is a small branching annual plant that is one and one-half totwo feet in height at maturity. It has many small leaves with very smallflowers. The young leaves are used for infectious and inflammatory conditions,while the juice of the leaves is applied to irritated skin lesions. The leaves,stems, flowers, and roots all have medicinal value.Several unique chemical constituents have been characterized in phyllanthus.Lignans called phyllanthum and hypophyl-lanthum have been identified in theleaves. Organic acids and alkaloids have been found in the leaves and roots.Extracts of phyllanthus have been demonstrated to inhibit the replication ofviral DNA, block the transmission of pain impulses, reduce muscle spasms, andlower blood sugar, but the precise chemicals responsible for these specificeffects remain to be fully defined.THE SCIENCE OF PHYLLANTHUSDozens of scientific studies have been published on phyllanthus over the pastfifteen years. Most research has focused on the ability of chemicals inphyllanthus to bind to various components of the hepatitis B virus. Earlystudies in mice suggested that extracts of phyllanthus could eliminate themarkers of viral infection in a high percentage of animals.1[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col30-nts1] These encouraging laboratoryresults were subsequently applied to people who were carriers of the hepatitis Bvirus. In a study from India, almost 60 percent of people with hepatitis Bshowed conversion of their blood tests from positive to negative.2[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col30-nts2] Further studies clarified therole of phyllanthus as binding to proteins produced by the virus and reducingthe activity of viral DNA.3 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col30-nts3], 4[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col30-nts4]Many studies, but not every one, have shown positive results. A report fromThailand found that only 5 to 6 percent of adults carrying hepatitis B virusshowed conversion of their blood tests from positive to negative.5[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col30-nts5] A Bombay study of thirty chroniccarriers of hepatitis failed to find any clearing of the markers for hepatitisafter one to two months of treatment with phyllanthus.6[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col30-nts6] These contradictory findingshighlight the fact that science rarely moves in a straight line. However, inview of the limited treatment options available to people with chronichepatitis, phyllanthus is a potential bright spot on the therapeutic horizon.Phyllanthus has also shown potential in the treatment of other viral infections.Constituents of phyllanthus have demonstrated activity against the Epstein-Barrvirus, the infectious agent responsible for mononucleosis and loosely associatedwith chronic fatigue syndrome.7 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col30-nts7]Other researchers have suggested that phyllanthus may be active against the HIVvirus responsible for AIDS. A report from Japan found that an extract ofphyllanthus could inhibit the enzyme that enables HIV to reproduce itself.8[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col30-nts8] These preliminary laboratoryfindings are encouraging, but we have some distance to go before they can besystematically applied to people with AIDS.Phyllanthus also shows promise in protecting the liver from other toxic insults.A recent report found that it reduced the damage to liver enzymes caused byexcessive alcohol.9 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col30-nts9] Anotherstudy demonstrated the ability of phyllanthus to reduce the liver damage causedby toxic chemicals, including carbon tetrachloride and galactosamine.10[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col30-nts10] How phyllanthus protects theliver remains to be discovered, but it seems that this ancient healing plantcontains potential healing treasures.In addition to its value in liver conditions, phyllanthus has been studied forits possible therapeutic role in several other medical conditions. In both Indiaand Latin America, it is a popular remedy for kidney stones. Researchers inBrazil have studied the effects of phyllanthus on the urinary system and havemade some interesting discoveries. In one report it was found to reduce thelikelihood of the smooth muscle lining of the urinary tract to go into spasm.11[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col30-nts11] This relaxation effect couldimprove the ease with which small kidney stones are passed. In a recent report,phyllanthus was found to inhibit the formation of calcium oxalate crystals inkidney cells.12 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col30-nts12] Phyllanthus hasalso shown promise in the treatment of high blood pressure, possibly by helpingthe kidney eliminate excess sodium from the body.13[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col30-nts13] This same report also foundthat phyllanthus had a blood-sugar-lowering effect. These many beneficialproperties of phyllanthus may help explain its traditional reputation as atherapeutic herb for kidney problems.Finally, there have been several reports emphasizing the pain-relievingproperties of phyllanthus. Its chemical constituents reduce both inflammatoryand pain responses in animals through mechanisms that have not yet beendetermined.14 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col30-nts14], 15[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col30-nts15] These properties, possiblyreflecting interactions with the prostaglandin system, may ultimately accountfor the traditional role of phyllanthus in the treatment of chronic fevers andinflammatory conditions.THE PRACTICAL USE OF PHYLLANTHUSAccording to the Ayurvedic framework, the bitter detoxifying qualities ofphyllanthus predict its therapeutic value in conditions characterized byexcessive heat and toxicity. Since the liver is the primary organ ofdetoxification, liver ailments, including hepatitis, have traditionally beentreated with phyllanthus. Almost all of the modern scientific studies onhepatitis have focused on hepatitis B. We do not yet know if phyllanthus has anybeneficial role in the treatment of hepatitis A or C. It does seem to be quitesafe, without reported side effects. If you are facing a liver problem for whichyou are considering using phyllanthus, we strongly encourage you discuss it withyour health-care provider and establish objective ways to measure the presenceor absence of a therapeutic effect. Most published studies have found that ifphyllanthus is to show a benefit on blood markers of hepatitis, it will occurwithin the first two months of use. If no measurable effect is seen within thistime frame, there is little justification in continuing it.HOW TO USE PHYLLANTHUSPhyllanthus is not widely known in the West. It is a component of severalAyurvedic liver formulas, where it is often combined with kutki. Phyllanthus isnow available from several herb companies as a single herb, standardized to 10milligrams of total sesquiterpenes. The usual dose of the nonprocessed herb is250 to 500 milligrams, two to three times per day. The general recommendation isto use phyllanthus for up to two months at a time.AYURVEDA AND PHYLLANTHUSPhyllanthus is composed of the bitter, astringent, and sweet tastes. These arethe three flavors that pacify Pitta. Because the bitter taste is predominant,phyllanthus also pacifies Kapha. It can be mildly aggravating to Vata. Its neteffect is to have a cooling influence on the physiology.PRECAUTIONSNo serious side effects have been reported with phyllanthus. Because of itscooling, detoxifying influence, it should be used cautiously by people who aredepleted. If you are using phyllanthus with the specific intention of treating aviral illness, please work closely with your health-care provider to monitor itssafety and efficacy.[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_063_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_064_r1.jpg]PICRORHIZA KURROAFAMILIAR: kutki, picrolivLATIN: Picrorhiza kurroaSANSKRIT: kutki, katukaAlthough not yet well known in the West, kutki has a long-established reputationin Ayurveda as a detoxifier and liver tonic. This hardy, mountain-dwelling plantcan be found above ten thousand feet in the Himalayan Mountains. The kutki plantproduces pink flowers during the months of summer when the snow melts, but it isthe underground roots and rhizomes that are harvested for their medicinaleffects. Although used for thousands of years by Ayurvedic doctors, it has onlyrecently received serious scientific attention for its liver-protectingproperties. As chronic viral liver infections pose a growing public healththreat in the West, botanical allies such as kutki may play an increasinglyimportant role.BOTANICAL AND PHYTOCHEMICAL INFORMATIONKutki is a perennial shrub that has two- to four-inch leaves, small flowers, anda five- to ten-inch-long main root, from which the medicinal herb is obtained.It grows at high altitude in the northwestern Himalayas in the region ofKashmir. Close botanical relatives to kutki are found in Mongolia and Tibet.Many different chemical constituents are found in the roots of kutki, includingglucosides, flavonoids, and sterols. The component that has received the mostattention is kutkin, which is a combination of two glucosides called glucoside-Aand kutkoside. The most commonly available form of kutki is standardized tocontain 10 milligrams of kutkin per tablet.THE SCIENCE OF KUTKIExploring the traditional use of kutki in the treatment of bilious fever,studies from the mid-1960s reported that patients with infective hepatitis givenkutki showed faster recoveries.1 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col31-nts1]Many reports over the past ten years have confirmed the benefits of kutki inprotecting the liver from a wide range of toxic and infectious insults.Investigation in animals has shown that kutki can help reverse the liver damagecaused by poisonous mushrooms, noxious chemicals, and toxic amino acids.2[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col31-nts2]–4[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col31-nts4]Although liver cancer is relatively rare in the West, it is one of the mostcommon malignancies in developing countries. The major risk factors for livercancer are hepatitis B viral infection and exposure to a food contaminant calledaflatoxin. This toxic chemical, produced by a common mold, is a widespreadproblem throughout Africa and Asia. Animal studies from India have demonstratedthat kutki protects the liver from most of the harmful effects of aflatoxin.5[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col31-nts5] Kutki has also been shown toprotect the liver against various tropical parasites and to strengthen theimmune system’s response to tuberculosis.6[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col31-nts6], 7[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col31-nts7]These infectious diseases and poisonings are fortunately uncommon in the West,but kutki may also provide benefit in two common conditions that affect theliver: alcoholism and hepatitis B. Animals exposed to enough alcohol to causeliver damage showed much less toxicity when they were also given kutki.8[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col31-nts8] Another report from Indiademonstrated that in the laboratory kutki has some potential to neutralizecomponents of the hepatitis B virus.9[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col31-nts9] It also stimulates the flow ofbile, which may be helpful in the prevention of gallstones.10[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col31-nts10] The application of kutki’sliver-protecting qualities to diseases in people still requires furtherresearch, but this herb seems to have considerable therapeutic potential. Insome studies kutki is more potent than silybum, a popular herb that is commonlyrecommended for liver ailments.11[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col31-nts11]In addition to its potential role in the therapy of liver disease, kutki hasbeen studied as a possible medicinal herb in the treatment of asthma andallergies. Laboratory studies have suggested that kutki dampens the release ofallergy-causing chemicals and reduces the severity of airway spasm in animals.12[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col31-nts12], 13[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col31-nts13] Chemical constituents of kutkialso have anti-inflammatory activity and inhibit the action of histamine.14[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col31-nts14], 15[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col31-nts15] Despite its suppression of anallergic response, kutki has been found to have immune-enhancing properties.16[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col31-nts16] These combined effects givecredence to the traditional use of kutki in the treatment of bronchial asthmaand support the value of further scientific research on this ancient healingherb.THE PRACTICAL USE OF KUTKIKutki is one of Ayurveda’s powerful purifying herbs. Since the liver is thebody’s primary site of detoxification, kutki was classically used whencongestion in the liver was identified. Kutki is now recommended when there is achallenge to the liver from toxins or infection. If someone has been abusingalcohol or drugs, or eating poorly, kutki can be a helpful component of adetoxification program. Although its role in the treatment of chronic hepatitisis receiving increasing attention, its clinical efficacy is yet to bedetermined. If you are facing a diagnosed liver problem such as chronichepatitis, discuss the use of kutki with your health-care provider before usingit.Kutki also has a traditional role in the treatment of bronchitis and asthma. Itspungent bitterness is cleansing to the respiratory tract. It also has a mildlycathartic effect on the digestive system when taken in higher doses. Combinedwith amalaki and licorice, it can help relieve indigestion.HOW TO USE KUTKIKutki is now available through major American herbal suppliers, where it goes bythe name of picroliv. The usual dose is 300 milligrams two to three times daily.Take it for one month at a time, and assess whether it is achieving the effectsyou are seeking. Do not take it for longer than three months at a stretch.Kutki is also a component of other herbal formulas for the liver, combined withother Ayurvedic or Western herbs. It combines well with turmeric, gotu kola,neem, and phyllanthus. A formulation combining kutki with silybum is currentlyavailable in the United States.AYURVEDA AND KUTKIThe predominant taste of kutki is bitter, with a secondary pungent component. Ithas a net cooling influence on the mind-body physiology. Kutki is mostappropriate for Pitta and Kapha conditions. Its sustained use may be mildlyVata-aggravating. As a bitter detoxifying herb, it was traditionally recommendedfor toxic conditions of the blood, characterized by low-grade fevers,generalized pain, and fatigue.PRECAUTIONSThere are no reported cases of toxicity due to kutki. Because it has a strongdetoxifying effect on the physiology, it should be used cautiously in people whohave illnesses that are depleting. It is to be avoided during pregnancy.Although it has traditionally been used for lactating mothers to purify theirmilk, there are no scientific studies to verify its safety in young children;therefore, breastfeeding mothers should avoid it. If you have a form of chronichepatitis and are considering using kutki, first carefully discuss this withyour health-care provider and follow his or her recommendations.[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_065_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_066_r1.jpg]PIPER METHYSTICUMFAMILIAR: kava kava, kavaLATIN: Piper methysticumKava kava, an ancient medicinal plant indigenous to the South Pacific, hasgained recent popularity in the West. Sometimes known as awa by nativeHawaiians, extracts of the roots of this tropical plant have been used forceremonial, recreational, and medicinal purposes by Polynesian natives formillennia. Kava creates a mildly calming euphoric state and appears to avoid thecommon side effects of many tranquilizing medications.Kava was traditionally prepared by chewing the root and mixing it with water orcoconut milk as part of a ceremonial event. In modern times it is occasionallyingested in ceremonies, but is more commonly consumed as a relaxing beverage andtranquilizing medicine. Modern scientific studies are confirming the beneficialeffects of kava in the treatment of anxiety and insomnia, but it should not beused indiscriminately, as rare side effects can occur.BOTANICAL AND PHYTOCHEMICAL INFORMATIONKava is a member of the pepper family. A nonclimbing shrub reaching on averageup to six feet in height, it has an affinity for warm, swampy areas. Cultivatedkava plants no longer produce viable seeds, so the herb is now propagated by wayof cuttings throughout the South Pacific and Hawaii. It produces characteristicheart-shaped leaves arising from smooth stems. The underground roots andrhizomes are the source of the medicinal components.Chemical analyses have determined that both water- and fat-soluble compounds canbe extracted from the kava root. The water-soluble components have not been welldescribed, whereas the lipid constituents have been characterized as belongingto a new class of compounds called kava lactones or pyrones. Several of thesechemicals, including desmethoxyyan-gonin, methysticin, and yangonin, have beenshown to have pain-relieving and sedating effects through complex actions on thenervous system.THE SCIENCE OF KAVAStudies have suggested that almost 50 million Americans struggle with anxiety ona regular basis, and many of today’s most widely prescribed drugs are directedtoward the treatment of anxiety and insomnia. Unfortunately, most medicationsfor nervousness and sleeping problems carry the side effects of daytime sedationand possible drug dependency. Alternatives to the use of standard anti-anxietymedication would be welcome if they provided relief with fewer adverse effects.Kava may offer a useful natural option, although it should not be seen as amagic elixir for dissolving the stresses of life. From a holistic perspective,the need for kava should trigger an honest search for the underlying cause ofthe anxiety or insomnia.For occasional short-term relief, kava has been shown to be effective inreducing nervousness without the impairment of thinking that usually accompaniestranquilizing drugs. In two studies from Germany, kava was found useful inreducing anxiety without negative reactions after just one week of treatment.1[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col32-nts1], 2[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col32-nts2] In a report of fifty-twooutpatients with anxiety, more than 80 percent of those taking kava rated theirtreatment as “very good” or “good.”3[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col32-nts3] Another study of forty womengoing through menopause showed that those taking kava had measurableimprovements in their mood and sense of well-being, with significant reductionsin both anxiety and depression, when compared with those on a placebo.4[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col32-nts4]Kava may be as effective as many of the standard medications without as manyside effects. In a study comparing kava to an anti-anxiety benzodiazepine drugcalled oxazepam, physiological brain reactions were altered with the medication,but were not affected by kava.5 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col32-nts5]Another study looking at the ability of people to identify novel visual stimulifound that subjects given oxazepam performed more poorly than those in a controlgroup, whereas those given kava actually performed better.6[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col32-nts6]Concerns have been raised about kava’s potential compounding effects if mixedwith alcohol. A German study looking into this issue reported that combiningkava with alcohol did not additionally impair performance on a number ofneurophysiological tests, and in procedures measuring concentration ability,those subjects taking kava with alcohol actually performed better than thosetaking alcohol alone.7 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col32-nts7] Thisshould not be interpreted as suggesting that you should take kava along withyour glass of wine; rather, it highlights the low risk of kava-induced sideeffects usually associated with sedating substances.There has been considerable scientific interest into how kava influences themind and nervous system. Laboratory studies have demonstrated that kava hascomplex effects on the physiology and chemistry of the brain. Extracts of kavahave been shown to dampen the electrical fluctuations of nerve cells.8[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col32-nts8] This modulation seems to bethrough interaction with the receptor for an inhibitory neurochemical known asGABA (gamma-amino-butyric acid).9[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col32-nts9] This mechanism is closelyrelated to the way that the common anti-anxiety medications act, but appears tobe different enough to avoid many of the common side effects of the standarddrugs. Kava’s potential therapeutic role in other neurological conditions,ranging from epilepsy to chronic pain to stroke, is just beginning to beexplored.10 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col32-nts10]–12[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col32-nts12]THE PRACTICAL USE OF KAVADespite its ready availability, kava should be used cautiously, sparingly, andrespectfully. For occasional insomnia or an acutely stressful time of life, ashort-term course of kava may provide temporary relief. If you are currentlytaking a prescribed tranquilizer or sleeping medication, discuss the use of kavawith your health-care provider before you start it or discontinue yourmedication. Do not mix kava with any recreational or prescribed drugs that mayhave sedating effects.HOW TO USE KAVAStudies using kava extract have found that doses of 70 to 100 milligrams ofkavalactones three times per day are effective in the treatment of mild anxiety.As a sleeping aid, a single dose of 150 to 200 milligrams an hour before bedtimeis usually suggested.One question that has not been fully answered is whether the effectiveness ofkava diminishes with repeated use. This issue, known as tolerance, has beeninvestigated in animals and found to be of minor concern. Mice given kavaextract daily for weeks showed no tolerance at low dosages and only slighttolerance at high dosages.13 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col32-nts13]Despite the minimal loss of efficacy over time, we encourage you not to relysolely on an herbal approach to treat anxiety or insomnia. Do not use kava as asubstitute for daily meditation, regular exercise, good nutrition, and healthyemotional choices.AYURVEDA AND KAVAFrom an Ayurvedic perspective, kava can be classified as containing the sweet,bitter, and astringent flavors. It is pacifying to Vata and Pitta, but can beaggravating to Kapha.PRECAUTIONSRare but potentially serious side effects have been reported in people takingkava. Despite its relative safety when taken on its own, it can interact withsedating medications. A report from Georgia described a patient who took kavaalong with his sedative medication, alprazolam, and became confused andlethargic for several hours.14 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col32-nts14]He recovered fully, but did require hospitalization.A more serious complication of liver injury was reported in a woman takingkava.15 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col32-nts15] Her liver testsrecovered after the herb was discontinued, and no other cause for her hepatitiscould be determined. Another complication, well described among native drinkersof kava, is a skin condition that has been called kava-induced dermopathy.16[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col32-nts16] Heavy chronic users of kava candevelop thickened, scaly skin. Although it has been suggested that this mayrepresent a niacin deficiency, recent studies have contradicted thisexplanation.17 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col32-nts17] Rare allergicskin reactions have been reported in westerners taking kava extract.18[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col32-nts18], 19[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col32-nts19]Our bottom line regarding kava is that it is a valuable herbal remedy that mayprovide an alternative to pharmaceutical anti-anxiety and sleeping medications.However, it should be used appropriately and as part of a holistic program thataddresses the underlying issues that contribute to the potential need for kava.[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_067_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_068_r1.jpg]SERENOA REPENSFAMILIAR: saw palmettoLATIN: Serenoa repens, Sabal serrulata, Serenoa serrulataSaw palmetto is a small palm tree native to the southeastern United States. Itis found throughout Florida and parts of South Carolina and Mississippi. Theberries of this plant were prized by Native Americans as a general tonic, as atreatment for impotence and painful urination in men, and as a natural remedyfor infertility and menstrual irregularities in women. Today saw palmetto is oneof the most widely used herbal medicines in the treatment of benign prostatichyperplasia (BPH). This condition, which affects over half of men in theirsixties and as many as 90 percent of men in their eighties, accounts for over350,000 operations each year in the United States. Although saw palmetto is nota cure for this common condition that may cause difficulties with urination, itcan improve the quality of life for many men.BOTANICAL AND PHYTOCHEMICAL INFORMATIONSaw palmetto is a low-growing palm that has sharp, spinelike leaf blades, whichaccount for its common name. The mature plant may reach fifteen to twenty feetin height and may live as long as seven hundred years. Each palm producesclusters of white flowers in the spring that give rise to fruits in the summer.Each plant produces up to five hundred berries that turn from green to orange todeep bluish black over the course of several months.For years, saw palmetto was viewed as an undesirable plant that was difficult toremove when clearing grazing pastures and farmland. With the growing interest insaw palmetto as a medicinal substance, the economic value of this plant has beenrecognized. It is now viewed as a cash crop by many of the same landowners thatpreviously saw it as an unwelcome weed.Tablets and capsules of saw palmetto contain dried berries, often standardizedto specific concentrations of sterols or fatty acids. Chemical analyses haveidentified a variety of free fatty acids in the fruits, including capric,lauric, and oleic acids. Several different medium- and long-chain alcohols andsterols have also been characterized. Although the responsible substances havenot yet been identified, it is the fat-soluble components of saw palmettoberries that appear to contain the chemicals that influence the prostate gland.THE SCIENCE OF SAW PALMETTOBenign prostatic hyperplasia is a condition in which a man’s prostate glandenlarges, at times resulting in the obstruction of the outflow tract from thebladder. The underlying cause of BPH is not fully understood, but seems to berelated to the concentration of sex hormones that stimulate the prostate gland.The most important of these hormones is dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which isderived from testosterone. A popular medication for BPH, finasteride, blocks theenzyme that converts testosterone to DHT. Several studies have suggested thatone of saw palmetto’s actions is to inhibit this same enzyme, possiblyaccounting in part for its efficacy in the treatment of BPH.1[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col33-nts1]–3[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col33-nts3]The nervous system plays an important role in coordinating normal urinaryfunction, and several drugs used to treat BPH act on the neurological inputs tothe lower urinary tact. In addition to its role on hormonal levels, saw palmettoalso influences the neurochemicals that coordinate urinary function.4[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col33-nts4], 5[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col33-nts5] The effect of these actions isto reduce the spasm that can interfere with normal urination.Saw palmetto fruits have also demonstrated anti-inflammatory activity.Components of a saw palmetto extract inhibit the formation of inflammatoryprostaglandins.6 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col33-nts6] This propertymay also contribute to the value of saw palmetto in the treatment of BPH.Regardless of how it works, there is convincing evidence that saw palmetto doeslead to improvements in urinary function in men with BPH. Saw palmetto seems tohelp with several aspects of bladder emptying. It can improve urinary flow,decrease discomfort, and reduce the amount of residual urine that is left in thebladder after voiding.7 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col33-nts7], 8[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col33-nts8] A report from Germany found thatmore than eighty percent of men taking saw palmetto reported a good to excellentresponse to the herbal extract.9 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col33-nts9]A study from Hungary reported that nine out of ten patients on saw palmetto hadmarked improvements in their ability to empty their bladders.10[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col33-nts10] Although not all reports haveshown definite objective improvements in urinary function,11[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col33-nts11] a recent review of eighteenstudies encompassing almost three thousand men found that overall saw palmettois effective in improving both the symptoms and flow measures of men with BPH.12[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col33-nts12] It seems to be as effective asthe most popular medication, finasteride, with fewer side effects.THE PRACTICAL USE OF SAW PALMETTOIn the treatment of BPH, saw palmetto berry extract is usually taken twicedaily. Studies have reported an improvement in symptoms in as little as onemonth after taking the herb, although benefits accrue over the course of threeto six months.In addition to its use in BPH, saw palmetto berries have a traditionalrejuvenating role for both men and women. It was used by Native Americans tohelp people recover from debilitating illnesses or injuries. Saw palmetto wasrecommended to increase both male and female fertility, although there has notbeen any scientific evidence to support this property. The berries have asoothing, toning effect on mucous membranes and can be taken for colds andcoughs.HOW TO USE SAW PALMETTOSaw palmetto extract is now widely available. Most tablets and capsules containa standardized concentration of fatty acids from 80 to 95 percent. Individualcapsules usually contain 80 or 160 milligrams with a daily recommended dose of320 milligrams. Crude berries are occasionally available, which can be taken ata dose of 10 grams twice daily.AYURVEDA AND SAW PALMETTOThe fresh berries, which carry the sweet, pungent, and astringent tastes, have amild warming effect on the physiology. They are pacifying to Vata and Pitta,with the potential to increase Kapha in high doses. The actions of saw palmettoon the urinary system are similar to those of the Ayurvedic herb gokshura(Tribulis terrestris).PRECAUTIONSRare digestive distress is associated with saw palmetto ingestion. In contrastto its traditional use for fertility, saw palmetto has been found in laboratorystudies to inhibit sperm motility at high concentrations.13[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col33-nts13] Although there have not beenany reports of clinical fertility problems with saw palmetto, it should probablybe avoided by a potential father if pregnancy is desired. Because BPH rarelycauses problems before the age of fifty, this potential concern about sawpalmetto is usually not relevant.[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_069_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_070_r1.jpg]SILYBUM MARIANUMFAMILIAR: milk thistleLATIN: Silybum marianum, Carduus marianusMilk thistle is an ancient European medicinal herb that has gained modernpopularity as a liver protectant. Its name derives from its characteristicwhite-veined leaves, which, according to legend, contain the milk of theMadonna. Drawing upon the ancient “doctrine of signatures,” which holds thatnature provides clues to the therapeutic value of a plant, milk thistle wastraditionally taken by nursing mothers seeking to improve the quality of theirbreast milk.Since the time of the ancient Greeks, milk thistle has been prescribed as aremedy for liver ailments. Physicians throughout medieval times and theRenaissance praised its ability to detoxify the body of “bad bile.” As modernresearchers began to look seriously at milk thistle, they discovered that itoffered genuine value in the treatment of liver disease. It has subsequentlybecome one of the most popular herbs among patients with liver disease.BOTANICAL AND PHYTOCHEMICAL INFORMATIONMilk thistle is native to the Mediterranean region and grows widely throughoutEurope. It was brought to America by early Western European settlers and is nowwell established in the United States and Latin America. Milk thistle is amember of the Compositae family, which includes chicory, burdock, and artichoke.The full-grown milk thistle plant can reach five feet in height and is easilyrecognized by its purple flower heads and spiny, white-veined leaves. Themedicinal herb is primarily derived from the small, hard fruits that are oftenmistakenly referred to as seeds.The chemical constituent in milk thistle that has been identified as thebiologically active substance is called silymarin. Silymarin is composed ofseveral unique flavonoids, the most important of which is silybin. Commerciallyavailable milk thistle extracts are usually standardized to contain 70 percentsilybin.Silymarin is easily absorbed from the digestive tract and processed by theliver, where it is concentrated in the bile.1[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col34-nts1] This may explain why its potentantioxidant properties seem to have their greatest impact in protecting theliver from toxic and infectious insults.THE SCIENCE OF MILK THISTLEMilk thistle has shown promise in a number of medical conditions includingdiseases of the liver, high cholesterol, and psoriasis. Studies from over thirtyyears ago on patients with liver damage resulting from a variety of causes foundthat those taking silymarin were more likely to show both clinical andlaboratory improvement than were control subjects.2[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col34-nts2], 3[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col34-nts3] Subsequent investigations inpeople with viral hepatitis have shown that those given milk thistle have fasternormalization of liver function tests and more-rapid clinical recoveries.4[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col34-nts4] These findings were true forpatients with both hepatitis A and hepatitis B infections.Reports on patients with cirrhosis of the liver who were given silymarin alsohad encouraging results. People with scarring of their livers due to alcohol orinfection who received milk thistle were more likely to live longer than controlpatients, even though there were not significant changes in laboratorymeasurements of liver function.5 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col34-nts5]Other studies have shown that silymarin also has a beneficial effect in avariety of liver ailments, including injuries from poisonous mushrooms,chemicals, and pharmaceutical drugs.6[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col34-nts6], 7[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col34-nts7] Another potentially useful rolefor silymarin is in the treatment of high cholesterol. Studies in both rats andrabbits have shown that silymarin has a positive effect in normalizing lipidmetabolism, reducing serum cholesterol levels and slowing the development ofatherosclerosis.8 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col34-nts8]–10[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col34-nts10] This effect has yet to beformally studied in people.THE PRACTICAL USE OF MILK THISTLEAlthough milk thistle has many potential therapeutic uses, its predominantmodern role is in the treatment of liver disease. The German Commission E hasapproved it for the treatment of dyspepsia and in the supportive therapy ofinflammatory liver conditions and cirrhosis. If you have active or chronic liverdisease, discuss the use of milk thistle with your health-care provider. Incases of viral hepatitis, milk thistle may improve both how you feel and thedegree of liver function abnormalities as measured by blood tests. If you arerecovering from the excessive use of alcohol, a month of silymarin may help yourliver to recover more rapidly and completely. If you have been diagnosed withcirrhosis of the liver due to toxic or infectious damage, a trial of milkthistle may be warranted. Although your liver blood tests may not show dramaticimprovement, you may feel better.Theoretically, milk thistle could play a beneficial role in reducing thetoxicity to the liver from pharmaceutical drugs, including cancer chemotherapymedicines. Unfortunately, there has not been any formal scientific investigationof milk thistle for this use. Because of its concentration in the liver, youshould use silymarin cautiously if you are taking a prescribed medicine that ismetabolized by the liver, as it theoretically may alter the level of the drug inyour system.HOW TO USE MILK THISTLEMilk thistle is widely available in health-food stores, where it is available astablets and tinctures. Most tablets have between 100 and 300 milligrams of milkthistle standardized to contain 70 percent silymarin. The usual therapeutic doseis between 300 and 800 milligrams of silymarin per day in two or three divideddoses. Milk thistle has been used by patients in studies for up to two yearscontinuously without apparent side effects.AYURVEDA AND MILK THISTLEThe original Ayurvedic sages did not know milk thistle. Although not botanicallyrelated, milk thistle, kutki, and phyllanthus have comparable medicinal profilesand are applied in similar clinical conditions. From an Ayurvedic perspective,milk thistle is bitter in taste and carries a cooling potency. It is pacifyingto Pitta and Kapha, but can be mildly aggravating to Vata if used for aprolonged time.PRECAUTIONSMilk thistle has a remarkable safety profile. Other than the possibility ofslightly loose stools, we have not come across any reports of untoward sideeffects. If you are taking a pharmaceutical agent, discuss the use of milkthistle with your health adviser to monitor any influence it may have on yourmedication levels.[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_071_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_072_r1.jpg]TANACETUM PARTHENIUMFAMILIAR: feverfew, bachelor’s buttonsLATIN: Tanacetum parthenium, Chrysanthemum partheniumWell known to ancient Egyptian and Greek physicians, feverfew received its namefor its ability to lower the fever in people facing infections. Sometimes knownas “feather-few” in recognition of its feathery leaves, it has a long-standingreputation in the world of natural medicine as an effective pain reliever.Scientific studies over the past thirty years have investigated the traditionalclaims surrounding feverfew, with most supporting its value, particularly in theprevention of migraine headaches. Other reports have lent credibility to thevalue of feverfew in the treatment of arthritic conditions.BOTANICAL AND PHYTOCHEMICAL INFORMATIONFeverfew is related to the chrysanthemum, producing daisylike flowers of whiterays on a yellow center. The hardy, perennial feverfew plant grows to about twoand one-half feet in height and is widely cultivated in gardens for itsattractive leaves and flowers. Native to southern Europe and the Caucasus regionbetween Europe and Asia, it is now found throughout the world in temperateclimates. A component of its essential oil has a characteristic pungent odorthat repels bees.The volatile oil of feverfew is chemically complex, containing a variety oforganic acids, ethers, and sesquiterpene lactones. The most importantconstituent appears to be parthenolide, although other natural chemicalcomponents play a role in feverfew’s therapeutic properties. These chemicalsappear to block the production of inflammatory prostaglandins, influence thebrain’s production of neurochemicals involved in pain regulation, and inhibitblood vessels from going into spasm.THE SCIENCE OF FEVERFEWPharmacological studies since the 1980s have demonstrated that feverfew haspotent anti-inflammatory activity, capable of inhibiting the production ofprostaglandins.1 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col35-nts1]–3[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col35-nts3] Closely associated with itsanti-inflammatory effects is feverfew’s ability to keep platelets from stickingtogether and releasing serotonin.4[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col35-nts4] Since altered serotoninmetabolism has been associated with migraine headaches, this property offeverfew may, in part, explain its efficacy in the treatment of vascularheadaches. Other chemicals contained in feverfew, including melatonin, may alsoplay a role.5 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col35-nts5]Regardless of what components may be pharmacologically active, the real questionconcerns feverfew’s effectiveness in the treatment of migraine headaches. Arecent review of published studies found that three of five reports showedsignificant benefits of feverfew over a placebo, with one of the two negativestudies providing only minimal data to substantiate its conclusion.6[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col35-nts6] In the majority of reports, thefrequency of migraines and the severity of headache pain diminished in thepatients taking feverfew.7 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col35-nts7]–9[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col35-nts9] In addition to reducing theheadache, feverfew helped diminish the associated symptoms of nausea and lightand noise sensitivity. In one study comparing people taking feverfew with thoseon a placebo, the mean number of monthly headaches decreased from more thanseven to less than two.10 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col35-nts10] Inanother study of seventy-six patients, there was, on average, about a 25-percentreduction in the number of headache attacks in those taking the equivalent oftwo medium-sized feverfew leaves per day.11[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col35-nts11] Side effects were generallymild, consisting of mouth sores, mild digestive symptoms, and an occasionalrebound increase in headaches when feverfew was discontinued.Feverfew is considered useful as a pre-ventative migraine medicine rather thanas a treatment once the headache has established itself. The benefits offeverfew may be seen as early as during the first months of treatment. It isimportant to realize that for most people feverfew does not completely eliminatemigraines; rather, it reduces their frequency and severity.The role of feverfew in other health conditions has not been well studied. Oneof its traditional uses has been in the treatment of inflammatory arthriticconditions, but the one modern study that researched its role in rheumatoidarthritis failed to demonstrate any definite value.12[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col35-nts12]One concern regarding studies on feverfew is the variable content of activeingredients in different batches of the herb. Researchers from England, lookingat many different formulations of feverfew, found levels of parthenolide rangingfrom none to almost 1 percent of the herbal dose.13[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col35-nts13] Whether the lack of activeconstituent is due to misidentification of the herb, deterioration over time, orintentional substitution, these findings emphasize the need for quality controland standardization in the herbal industry. Most feverfew formulations availablein the United States are now standardized to contain between .2 percent and .9percent parthenolides.THE PRACTICAL USE OF FEVERFEWMigraines are characterized by throbbing pain, often associated with nausea andsensitivity to loud sounds and bright lights. Anyone with more than anoccasional headache should have a thorough medical evaluation to rule out otherconditions that may cause headaches. Although there are many effectivemedications available for the prevention and symptomatic treatment of migraines,many people prefer to take a holistic approach.If you are susceptible to frequent migraine headaches, feverfew may be worth atrial. You will likely need to take it daily for at least a month beforenoticing a reduction in the frequency or intensity of your headaches. It willnot have much value if you take it during a migraine attack. Before beginningany medicine or herbal remedy for migraines, first evaluate the basic aspects ofyour lifestyle. Be sure you are getting enough rest, and that you are eatingwell and have eliminated alcohol and caffeine from your diet. Look at thechronic and acute stresses in your life, and take steps to reduce them. Althoughthere are genetic components to migraine susceptibility, lifestyle issues canhave a major impact.HOW TO USE FEVERFEWFeverfew is easy to grow in your garden, and a few leaves can be taken daily toprevent headaches. Tablets and capsules of the herb are widely available, butmake certain that you are obtaining feverfew from a reputable source that offersa standardized formulation. Clinical studies have used a daily dose of driedfeverfew leaves in the range of 50 to 100 milligrams. Depending upon theconcentration of the preparation, this is equivalent to about 2 milligrams ofparthenolide. Most commercially available capsules contain between 80 and 250milligrams of dried feverfew, with a recommended dose of between two and fourcapsules per day.If you are growing your own, two to three fresh feverfew leaves daily areusually sufficient to produce a therapeutic benefit. The flowering tops containthe highest concentration of parthenolide, closely followed by the leaves. Thestems and roots have only minimal amounts of the presumed active constituent.AYURVEDA AND FEVERFEWFeverfew was not an original Ayurvedic herb, but can be understood according toAyurvedic principles. It has a predominantly bitter taste and a coolinginfluence on the system. It is helpful in reducing Pitta and Kapha, but may beaggravating to Vata. According to Ayurveda, migraine headaches are usually aPitta aggravation, as opposed to tension headaches, which are usually more Vata.In our personal experience, we have seen both Pitta and Vata imbalances respondto feverfew.PRECAUTIONSSome people are sensitive to chemical components of feverfew. A small percentageof regular users who chew feverfew leaves will develop mouth sores, although, inone study, people taking the placebo actually reported this problem more oftenthan those taking feverfew. People tending gardens with feverfew occasionallydevelop an allergic skin reaction.Although we have not seen any modern reports, one of feverfew’s traditional useswas to induce menstruation, so pregnant women should avoid it. Because of itsability to inhibit platelet aggregation in laboratory studies, people takingblood-thinning medications should not take feverfew.[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_073_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_074_r1.jpg]TERMINALIA ARJUNAFAMILIAR: arjuna myrobalanLATIN: Terminalia arjunaSANSKRIT: arjunaThe arjuna tree, which grows throughout India, has been valued for itstherapeutic properties since the original Ayurvedic writings thousands of yearsago. It is revered both for its wood and as a source of herbal medicine. Themyth surrounding arjuna relates that the two sons of the Tree Spirit Kinginsulted a wizard, who turned them both into arjuna trees. Even in modern times,in recognition of their enchanted heritage, lumbermen perform rituals of respectbefore cutting arjuna trees.1 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col36-nts1]Arjuna’s traditional use has been as a heart tonic, with modern studiessupporting its therapeutic role in cardiac conditions. It has effects on thecirculatory system ranging from the lowering of cholesterol levels to improvingthe strength of heart contractions.BOTANICAL AND PHYTOCHEMICAL INFORMATIONArjuna is a beautiful deciduous tree that can reach heights of one hundred feet.It grows throughout the sub-Himalayan region of India and Sri Lanka, preferringwet, marshy regions. The arjuna tree has ovoid leaves and produces clusters ofsmall white flowers. It is the inner layers of its silver-white bark that areused for medicinal purposes.Arjuna’s bark contains amino acids, phenols, nitrates, and tannins. Ellagicacid, a chemical constituent of arjuna, has been shown to protect DNA strandsfrom mutations. Arjunin, a unique tannin isolated from arjuna, may also havepotential anticancer properties. The chemical components responsible forarjuna’s effects on the circulatory system have not yet been identified.THE SCIENCE OF ARJUNAArjuna is good example of an herb whose traditional use inspired scientificresearch that confirmed its historical value. Studies around the world havedemonstrated beneficial effects of arjuna on important aspects of thecardiovascular system. Animal studies have shown that arjuna can substantiallylower serum cholesterol levels and improve the HDL:cholesterol ratio withoutsignificant side effects.2 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col36-nts2], 3[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col36-nts3]People with known coronary artery disease who took arjuna showed a significantreduction in the number of anginal chest pain episodes along with a reduction intheir blood pressure.4 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col36-nts4] Arjunawas not effective in heart patients with unstable angina pectoris, but was ableto reduce by half the anginal episodes in patients with stable heart disease. Inpatients with a history of heart attacks and impairment in heart musclefunction, arjuna was associated with a reduction in the frequency of chest painattacks and improvement in the ability of their heart muscles to contract.5[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col36-nts5] Another study of people withcongestive heart failure found that those taking arjuna improved in severalmeasures of cardiac function.6 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col36-nts6]They also showed sustained enhancement in their overall functioning and qualityof life. When combined with guggulu, arjuna was shown to protect the heartmuscle in animals when subjected to cardiac-damaging drugs.7[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col36-nts7]Although the benefits of arjuna appear to be substantial, its appropriate rolein the modern treatment of heart disease remains to be defined. Cardiovasculardisease is a serious health concern, representing the number-one cause of deathin Western society. An herbal approach that may improve the quality of life forpeople with heart disease is worthy of serious consideration by the medicalcommunity. On the other hand, if you have heart disease, it is not the time toexperiment on your own with an herbal medicine that may interact with thepharmaceutical drugs you are taking. Our recommendation, if you have coronaryartery disease, is that you use an herbal approach only under the closesupervision of your physician. You may wish to refer your doctor to the articlesreferenced in this book for his or her consideration.In addition to its role in heart disease, arjuna has shown other potentiallybeneficial effects. It can inhibit the growth of certain cancer cell lines andhas antibiotic activity against several disease-causing germs, including thebacteria that cause gonorrhea.8 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col36-nts8],9 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col36-nts9] Traditionally, arjuna has beenused to regulate blood sugar, treat skin sores, and help heal bone fractures.These properties have yet to be scientifically investigated.THE PRACTICAL USE OF ARJUNAIn Ayurvedic medicine, the astringent properties of arjuna are applied toconditions that require the clearing of toxins and the healing of wounds. Inaddition to its use in heart disease, arjuna is often prescribed for disordersof the digestive tract, including acute gallbladder and liver diseases,diarrhea, and dysentery. In such cases a strong tea is given three times dailyuntil the symptoms improve.It is a useful topical herb for skin conditions including wounds and ulcers. Inthe case of acne, a paste applied directly to a sore and left to dry can helpclear the infection and stimulate healing. Arjuna is traditionally used to treatpeople who bruise easily, although whether it works on blood vessels or theclotting system has not been researched. Its cleansing and hemostatic propertiesare also applied to people with bleeding gums, who are encouraged to gargle witha suspension of powdered bark.HOW TO USE ARJUNAArjuna is not yet readily available in the West, although an increasing numberof Ayurvedic heart tonics contain arjuna as their first ingredient. It isavailable in bulk powdered form from herbal importers.The standard dose for heart disease is 500 milligrams three times daily.Traditionally it is mixed with warm milk and sugar. For digestive disorders,arjuna is prepared as a tea with one teaspoon per cup of hot water taken everysix hours until the diarrhea or cramping has passed.As a topical wash for sores, a decoction can be prepared by boiling onetablespoon of arjuna powdered bark in two cups of water until the volume isreduced in half. Wash the wound with the liquid several times a day. This sameformula can be used as a mouthwash or gargle. As a treatment for acne, arjunapowder is mixed with water to make a paste that can be directly applied to theskin lesion.AYURVEDA AND ARJUNAThe predominant taste of arjuna is astringent, with a slightly pungent secondarycomponent. It has a cooling, anti-inflammatory influence on the physiology. Itis pacifying to both Pitta and Kapha, but may increase Vata after prolongedusage.PRECAUTIONSSerious side effects have not been reported with arjuna. If you are consideringarjuna in the hope that it may help with your heart disease, it is absolutelyessential that you first discuss it with your heart doctor. You should not stopany heart medication before starting arjuna, and you should be closely monitoredby your health-care provider.[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_075_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_076_r1.jpg]TINOSPORA CORDIFOLIAFAMILIAR: amrit, heart-leaved moonseedLATIN: Tinospora cordifoliaSANSKRIT: amrit, guduchiA classical Vedic myth relates that the ancient gods churned the primordialocean, producing an ambrosial nectar that conferred immortality on any beingthat partook of it. This nectar was called amrit, meaning “imperishable.” Theapplication of this powerful name to this native Indian plant reflects itsposition in the Ayurvedic pharmacy as a valued tonic herb, conferring vitalityand the energy of youth. Although modern studies cannot yet confirm itsimmortalizing qualities, there is an expanding body of research to suggest thatamrit does offer broad health-promoting properties.BOTANICAL AND PHYTOCHEMICAL INFORMATIONTinospora cordifolia is an attractive perennial creeping plant with heart-shapedleaves. It favors shady, damp environments and tends to grow among hedge bushes.Amrit has a papery, light gray bark and small yellow flowers. The leaves, stems,and roots are all used medicinally.Several characteristic bitter principles have been identified in amrit. Variousglycosides and terpenes, including unique compounds called tinosporine andcordifolisides A, B, and C, have been isolated from alcohol and water extractsof its stems and leaves.THE SCIENCE OF AMRITMany studies have evaluated the effects of amrit on the immune system.Laboratory studies have shown that amrit can enhance the production ofantibodies and improve the function of macrophages, the cells responsible forgobbling up foreign proteins.1 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col37-nts1]In animals that receive immune-toxic drugs, amrit helps restore the productionof natural immune-enhancing chemicals such as interferon and tumor necrosisfactor (TNF).2 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col37-nts2] Animals withserious infections given amrit are able to more effectively clear the bacteria,resulting in more rapid and complete recovery. Tinospora cordifolia does notappear to have direct antibiotic activity; rather, it seems to stimulate thehost’s immune defense system to function more effectively.3[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col37-nts3] This has been shown to be trueagainst fungal and parasitic as well as bacterial infections.4[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col37-nts4], 5[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col37-nts5]The immune-potentiating properties of amrit have been applied to peopleundergoing surgery. A series of reports from Bombay, India, have shown thatpatients receiving an amrit extract prior to major abdominal surgery had fewerpostoperative infections and significantly improved outcomes, compared againstthose receiving standard surgical care.6[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col37-nts6], 7[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col37-nts7] Studies to determine why thosepatients did so much better found that the white blood cells of those whoreceived amrit were better able to engulf and eliminate disease-causingbacteria.8 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col37-nts8]Amrit has also demonstrated potentially useful properties in cancer. A recentstudy reported that amrit killed tumor cells very effectively when added to aculture of cancer cells.9 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col37-nts9] Inanother animal study, amrit was shown to have potent antioxidant properties thatsubstantially reduced the side effects of a cancer chemotherapy drug on theblood-producing cells in bone marrow.10[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col37-nts10] These different propertiespaint an interesting picture of amrit’s potential therapeutic effects. Itstrengthens natural immunity, may have anticancer activity, and is capable ofprotecting healthy cells from toxic influences. Reports have also suggested thatamrit helps to stabilize blood sugar and lower cholesterol levels.11[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col37-nts11], 12[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col37-nts12]Amrit can be classified as an adaptogen, a substance that helps the individualadapt more readily to life challenges. This class of herbs, which includesginseng and ashwagandha, offers protection against the deleterious healtheffects from a wide range of stresses. An example of its protective propertiesis a recent study that showed amrit was able to reduce the harmful action of thechemotherapy drug cisplatin on the digestive tract.13[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col37-nts13] It limited the extent of damageto the stomach lining, normalized gastric emptying, and stabilized intestinalfunction. With no reported serious side effects, amrit is a prime candidate forfurther scientific research as an agent that can enhance the body’s recuperativepowers.THE PRACTICAL USE OF AMRITAmrit is just beginning to become available in the West. It is usually acomponent of Ayurvedic formulas designed to enhance immunity and modify aperson’s response to stress. Its traditional role has been in the treatment ofinfectious illnesses, ranging from colds to syphilis. It is rejuvenative as wellas detoxifying. Amrit is often a component of formulas used in the treatment ofchronic skin disorders such as psoriasis or eczema, although we have not seenany scientific studies that have quantified its role in dermatologicalconditions. It is also reported to be one of the best herbal medicines for gout.HOW TO USE AMRITTinospora cordifolia is available in powdered form from herbal importers. Theusual dosage for immune enhancement is one teaspoon twice daily. This can betaken on a maintenance basis if you are facing a persistent challenge such ascancer, or can be used at the onset of a cold or flu to be taken for a week. Itcan be combined with shatavari or ashwagandha as a general tonic, or with aloevera juice as part of a detoxifying formula. It can also be made into a pasteand applied directly to chronic skin irritations.AYURVEDA AND AMRITAmrit contains the bitter, pungent, and astringent tastes. It has a heatingpotency with a sweet post-digestive effect. It is classically used to clear thesystem of excessive Pitta accumulation, but is balancing to all three doshas.PRECAUTIONSNo significant adverse effects have been reported with amrit. It can be slightlyconstipating if used for a prolonged time by people who are prone to sluggishbowels.[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_077_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_078_r1.jpg]TRIGONEHA FOENUM-GRAECUMFAMILIAR: fenugreekLATIN: Trigonella foenum-graecumSANSKRIT/HINDI: methiFenugreek is one of the earliest spices used by human beings for culinary andmedicinal purposes. Native to the lands that surround the Arabian Sea, fenugreekwas known to the ancient Egyptian and Greek physicians, and was valued byHippocrates in the fifth century B.C. A member of the legume family, fenugreekis now cultivated in the Middle East, India, China, and Greece. With itsdistinctive aroma, fenugreek is commonly added to perfumes, candies, and curriedspice blends. It has traditional therapeutic value as a nutritive tonic and inthe treatment of digestive disorders and respiratory complaints. Scientificstudies have shown fenugreek to be beneficial in lowering elevated blood sugarand cholesterol levels.BOTANICAL AND PHYTOCHEMICAL INFORMATIONFenugreek is an annual herb that grows to about two feet in height. The Latinname Trigonella, meaning “three-angled,” refers to the oval-shaped leaves thatgrow in triad clusters. The plant produces white flowers in the early summerthat give rise to sickle-shaped pods, containing ten to twenty yellow seeds. Theleaves and pods are used medicinally.Chemical analysis of the seeds reveals a strong-smelling volatile oil, amucilaginous polysaccharide, and a variety of alkaloids and flavonoids. Severalunique saponins called trigoneosides have been identified. Diosgenin, a saponinalso present in wild yams, is synthesized into female hormones used inbirth-control pills and hormone-replacement therapy. Over 25 percent of the seedis composed of fiber. It has been suggested that the fiber and saponins areresponsible for fenugreek’s cholesterol-lowering action, by binding cholesterolin the digestive tract so it cannot be fully absorbed into the bloodstream.1[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col38-nts1]THE SCIENCE OF FENUGREEKFenugreek has been most researched for its effect on blood glucose levels. Manystudies in diabetic animals have shown that the leaves and ground seeds offenugreek lower blood sugar levels.2[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col38-nts2]–4[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col38-nts4] The ability of fenugreek tolower glucose levels may be due to its content of an amino acid(4-hydroxyisoleucine) that stimulates the release of insulin.5[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col38-nts5]The effects of fenugreek on blood sugar levels have been shown to be relevant tohuman beings. Insulin-dependent diabetics given fenugreek seed powder withbreakfast and dinner showed reduced fasting blood sugar levels and improvedglucose tolerance tests.6 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col38-nts6] Theyalso had a lowering of their cholesterol and triglyceride levels. In anotherstudy, patients with mild noninsulin-dependent diabetes given fenugreek at adose of 2.5 grams twice daily showed a significant reduction in their bloodsugar levels.7 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col38-nts7] Other patientswith coronary artery disease given fenugreek for three months showed lowercholesterol and triglyceride levels. In this report from India, healthy peoplewithout diabetes or heart disease given fenugreek did not demonstrate any changein their sugar or cholesterol values.Fenugreek’s effect on cholesterol was predicted by an earlier animal study thatfound an extract able to reduce blood cholesterol levels by about 25 percent inrats over a one-month period.8 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col38-nts8]This cholesterol-lowering effect is in part due to the binding of cholesterol bythe fiber component of the seeds. The saponins present in fenugreek may alsoplay a role by blocking the absorption of bile acids that carry cholesterol intothe bloodstream.An interesting feature of fenugreek is its ability to increase appetite,resulting in greater food conusmption.9[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col38-nts9] Although this may not soundappealing for people trying to lose weight, it can be a valuable aid for peoplewith chronic illness or depression who have trouble consuming enough dailycalories to support their recovery. It is interesting that despite itsappetite-enhancing effects, fenugreek is able to lower serum cholesterol levels.In addition to its glucose- and cholesterol-lowering effects, fenugreek leaveshave demonstrated antioxidant and pain-relieving effects.10[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col38-nts10], 11[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col38-nts11] Although the leaves are notwell known in the West, they are used in a manner similar to spinach in theMiddle East and India. The antioxidant properties may be due to their richcontent of vitamin C and beta-carotene.12[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col38-nts12] Another traditional use forfenugreek leaves and seeds in Saudi Arabia is in the treatment of kidney stones.A study in animals found that rats receiving fenugreek daily for a month had asignificant reduction in the quantity of calcium oxalate deposited in theirkidneys, supporting its folk medicine use.13[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col38-nts13] It’s obvious that this pungentspice has many potential health-promoting benefits, worthy of further scientificinvestigation.THE PRACTICAL USE OF FENUGREEKFenugreek is best consumed as part of a balanced diet. If you have elevatedcholesterol levels or suffer with diabetes, try to get a couple of teaspoons offenugreek into your diet on a daily basis. A teaspoonful in a cup of hot milk,sweetened with honey, before bedtime can help induce sound sleep. Fenugreek teataken after a meal can be soothing to an upset stomach. One of the herb’straditional uses has been to increase the quantity of breast milk in nursingmothers. Other than making mom smell a little like maple syrup, it seems to bewell tolerated and moderately effective.HOW TO USE FENUGREEKFenugreek seeds are usually available at grocery stores, although you may needto go to a Middle Eastern or Indian spice shop to find it as an individualspice, rather than as part of a curry blend.Health-food stores usually carry ground seeds in capsule form with about 500milligrams per dose. To make a digestionsettling tea, simmer two teaspoons ofcrushed or ground seeds in a cup of hot water. As a gargle for sore throats andcolds, boil two teaspoons in a cup of water down to one-half cup and use whilestill warm.As an aid to lowering cholesterol, take one gram twice daily, either as a powdermixed in food or liquid, or in the form of tablets. Anecdotal reports offenugreek to increase breast milk suggest that 2 to 8 grams in divided doses canenhance lactation. Be sure to drink plenty of water if you are using fenugreekfor this purpose.The ground seeds can be made into a paste with water and used as a poultice inthe treatment of skin eruptions. A fenugreek paste is used to draw out infectionfrom boils and can be applied directly to acne lesions, left until dry, and thenwashed off.AYURVEDA AND FENUGREEKThe bitter taste predominates in fenugreek, followed by pungent and sweet. Thenet effect of fenugreek on the physiology is heating. It is pacifying to Vataand Kapha, but has the potential of aggravating Pitta if taken in excess.PRECAUTIONSFenugreek should generally be avoided during pregnancy, as it may have astimulating effect on the uterus. Rare allergic reactions have been described,but considering its long-standing worldwide use, it is a very safe culinary andmedicinal spice.14 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col38-nts14][images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_079_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_080_r1.jpg]ULMUSRUBRAFAMILIAR: slippery elmLATIN: Ulmus rubraSlippery elm is a wonderful medicinal herb that is an American original. Prizedby Native Americans, it was embraced by early settlers for its value as both afood source and medicine. Although introduced to Europe in the seventeenthcentury, it never received wide acceptance. In America, however, slippery elmwas included for over a century in our official pharmacopoeia, and remains onthe FDA’s “safe and effective” list. Nevertheless, there are no formalscientific studies published on it.Traditionally, slippery elm has been used for a wide range of health concerns,whenever there is evidence of inflammation. Its soothing mucilaginous qualitieshave been applied to conditions ranging from sore throat to inflamedhemorrhoids. A popular ingredient in modern herbal teas and throat lozenges,slippery elm is one of nature’s gentlest healing allies.BOTANICAL AND PHYTOCHEMICAL INFORMATIONThe slippery elm tree is native to North America, where both the outer and innerbark are harvested. Its Latin name Ulmus rubra, meaning “red elm,” refers to thereddish color of its inner bark. It grows best in soil that has been disturbed,such as abandoned farmland. Slippery elm is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, afungal infection spread by bark beetles, but less so than other species of elm.It is primarily the inner bark that is used medicinally. It contains manydifferent sugars, terpenes, and sterols that result in its mucilaginousproperties. A fine powder of the bark can be taken internally as a nutritiousgruel, made into throat lozenges, or applied as a poultice to irritated skin.Slippery elm’s natural mucilage binds to and protects internally and externallyinflamed membranes.THE SCIENCE OF SLIPPERY ELMSlippery elm is used industrially in many food and medicinal products. It servesas binder material in suppositories, as a demulcent in throat lozenges, and as athickener in creams and ointments. Slippery elm also serves as an antioxidantpreservative in cooking oils. With the many benefits attributed to this herb, itis surprising that it has been ignored by modern medical science. Perhaps it hasbeen overlooked because it is on the boundary between food and natural medicine.PRACTICAL USES FOR SLIPPERY ELMSlippery elm has many diverse uses. Native Americans found it beneficial in thetreatment of cough and sore throat. Its lubricating qualities loosen andmobilize secretions throughout the respiratory tract. It also has therapeuticeffects on the digestive system, where it acts as a gentle bowel tonic, usefulin the treatment of both diarrhea and constipation. Heartburn and peptic ulcersrespond to the soothing influence of slippery elm, which can cool inflamedmucous membranes. It has properties very similar to marshmallow, which is widelyused in Europe for inflammatory problems.Native American women taught early European settlers the value of slippery elmin easing the pain of childbirth. In addition to its internal use, slippery elmwas externally applied to lubricate the birth passage. It was also used afterdelivery to soothe swollen and irritated vaginal tissues.Mixed with brown sugar or maple syrup, slippery elm makes a gruel of the kindthat sustained early American explorers. George Washington and his armies usedit as a source of nutrition during the revolutionary war. It can be helpful inpeople who are convalescing from an illness and is even digestible by babies.Slippery elm’s benefits extend beyond the digestive system. It is useful incooling inflamed membranes of the urinary tract. Chronic bladder inflammation,prostatitis, and urethritis have traditionally responded to slippery elm. Itsanti-inflammatory qualities can also be recommended for rheumatic conditions,including degenerative arthritis and gout.Externally, slippery elm can be applied to sores, wounds, and burns. It can beused to treat cold sores, eczema, and festering insect bites. A dilute solutionof a slippery elm infusion may help soothe inflamed eyes. A poultice made withpowdered slippery elm bark can be applied directly to painful, swollenhemorrhoids, which may also benefit from the internal use of this lubricatingsubstance.In patients receiving treatment for cancer, we recommend slippery elm to reducethe discomfort of inflamed mucous membranes, a common side effect ofchemotherapy or radiation. Made into a porridge with milk, cinnamon, and honey,slippery elm can also provide a nourishing nutritional supplement.Externally, slippery elm can be combined with comfrey and applied directly toslow-healing skin ulcers. Mixed with cocoa butter or olive oil, it is a soothingsunburn remedy.HOW TO USE SLIPPERY ELMAs a tea, one ounce of slippery elm bark is added to one pint of hot water andsteeped for five minutes. To use the powdered inner bark as a nutritive gruel,boil one tablespoon in a cup of milk and season with brown sugar and cinnamon.As an external poultice, soak the shredded bark in equal parts of hot water andapply directly to the site of irritation. Slippery elm throat lozenges arewidely available at most health-food stores; these can be used for relief of asore throat or prior to a public speaking or singing event.An ointment can be made by combining one ounce of slippery elm bark powder withthree ounces of cocoa or jojoba butter and massaging into the inflamed area. Tomake a paste, mix powdered bark with purified water until it is the consistencyof thick oatmeal, and apply to the irritated skin. Leave it on until it hasfully dried, then rinse it off with room-temperature water. This can be repeatedthree to four times per day until the burn or sore has healed.AYURVEDA AND SLIPPERY ELMAlthough not described in the classic Ayurvedic texts, slippery elm can beclassified as possessing sweet and cooling properties, effective in thetreatment of excessive Pitta and Vata. Although it can increase Kapha in highdoses, it has a mucus-mobilizing effect that can benefit people with asthma,chronic bronchitis, and upper respiratory infections. Highly nutritive, it isused in states of tissue depletion. Slippery elm can restore balance to theblood and heal the mucous membranes of the lungs and stomach.PRECAUTIONSThe gruel can be slightly difficult to digest in large amounts. At usual doses,slippery elm is a safe, gentle herbal aid.[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_081_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_082_r1.jpg]VALERIANA OFFICINALISFAMILIAR: valerianLATIN: Valeriana officinalis, Valeriana jatamansi, Nardostachys jatamansiSANSKRIT: tagara, jatamansiEffective for quieting an overactive mind, valerian has played the role of anatural sedative for millennia. Valerian species have been valued for theircalming influence by healers in Asia, Europe, and North America. Dozens ofmodern studies have confirmed that this strong-smelling herb has measurabletranquilizing properties with minimal side effects.Widely available in tablets, teas, and tinctures, valerian is approved by theGerman Commission E as a safe sleep-inducing substance and by the United StatesFood and Drug Administration as a food and beverage flavoring. Although modernstudies have focused primarily on its sleep-inducing effects, valerian also haspotential value in the treatment of muscle spasms and hypertension.BOTANICAL AND PHYTOCHEMICAL INFORMATIONValerian is a perennial shrub that grows to a height of about four feet. It hasclusters of small pink flowers that blossom on long stems. The roots and rhizomeare the primary source for the herbal medicine. They contain the uniquechemicals known as valeprotriates and valeric acid that appear to be responsiblefor valerian’s calming properties.Both water- and alcohol-extracted components of valerian root have sedativeactivity. Even aromatherapy with valerian essential oil can have a calmingeffect. One of the possible mechanisms for valerian’s tranquilizing effect isits ability to increase levels of an inhibitory brain chemical called gammaamino-butyric acid or GABA. Benzodiazepine drugs, such as Valium and Ativan, acton receptors for GABA in the brain, suggesting that the action of valerian maybe similar.1 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col40-nts1] Other importantneurochemicals, including dopamine and serotonin, are also influenced byvalerian, so its effects on the brain may be more complex than was initiallybelieved.THE SCIENCE OF VALERIANValerian has an established history of safety and efficacy. It is one of themost popular herbs in Europe, with over 100 million units prescribed in Germanybetween 1974 and 1993.2 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col40-nts2] Studiesfrom around the world have demonstrated that valerian taken before bedtime canimprove the quality of rest a person receives. A report from Sweden demonstratedthat valerian was substantially more effective than a placebo in enhancing sleepwithout side effects.3 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col40-nts3]Brain-wave studies of people receiving valerian have shown that it increases theamount of time people spend in the deeper stages of sleep.4[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col40-nts4] Other studies have shown thatvalerian reduces the time it takes to fall asleep, reduces the number of times aperson awakens during the night, improves the quality of rest gained during thenight, and produces minimal or no drowsiness in the morning.5[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col40-nts5], 6[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col40-nts6]Animal studies have confirmed that valerian has measurable calming effects.Valerian can prolong the effects of sedative medication and reduce thewithdrawal symptoms of animals given tranquilizers for one month.7[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col40-nts7], 8[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col40-nts8] Supporting the relevance ofthese findings to people, a pharmacist from New Zealand recently reportedsuccess in using herbal medicines, including valerian, in a drug detoxificationunit.9 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col40-nts9]Studies have suggested that valerian may have stress-neutralizing effects thatextend beyond its capacity to promote sound sleep. There are reports that it maydiminish the risk of stress ulcers and reduce spasms in the digestive tract.10[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col40-nts10], 11[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col40-nts11] Valerian may also havelipid-lowering effects, with one study demonstrating that extracts of Indianvalerian lower total cholesterol levels and raise the HDL (good) component.12[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col40-nts12] Finally, extracts of valerianhave also been shown to have antibiotic activity against a variety of molds.13[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col40-nts13]PRACTICAL USES FOR VALERIANValerian is useful as a natural relaxant. Although it has not been shown to haveany serious long-term side effects, we do not encourage the chronic use ofvalerian for the treatment of insomnia or anxiety. If you are consistentlyhaving trouble sleeping, look to the underlying cause. Are you stressed at work?Are there relationship issues that need to be addressed? Valerian is a valuablebotanical gift, but should not be thought of as a substitute for tranquilizingdrugs, taken chronically to cope with unresolved emotional imbalances in yourlife.Valerian can be helpful in the occasional treatment of sleep difficulties,muscle tension, and mild functional digestive imbalances. As a natural bridgeacross stressful life challenges, it is a gentle stress-relieving ally.Valerian has traditionally been used in the treatment of health conditionsrelated to stress, such as heart palpitations, mildly elevated blood pressure,and tension headaches. Although there have not been scientific studies toconfirm these benefits of valerian, it is worth a short trial of the herb if youare experiencing intermittent stress-related symptoms. Be certain to discussyour use of valerian with your health-care provider. If valerian is effective inreducing your physical symptoms, it is a good sign that taking otherstress-reducing measures, such as meditation, regular exercise, or massage, maybe more effective in the long run.HOW TO USE VALERIANValerian is widely available in tablets and capsules at health-food stores.Studies have suggested that a 450-milligram dose is as effective as 900milligrams in people taking valerian to help induce sleep.14[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col40-nts14] A cup of valerian tea atbedtime, sweetened with honey, can also be helpful. In India, valerian root isused as a potpourri pillow. Children or adults inhale the distinctive fragranceof valerian at bedtime to induce sound sleep.For anxiety or other stress-related conditions, valerian can be taken threetimes a day, not to exceed a daily dose of two grams. If you are using valerianmore than a few days in a row, ask what more you can do to address theunderlying tension in your life.AYURVEDA AND VALERIANAyurveda recognizes two different medicinal plants in the valerian family:tagara and jatamansi. Tagara is closest to Valeriana officinalis, which is theplant most widely used in Western herbal formulas. Jatamansi sometimes goes bythe Latin name Valeriana jatamansi and is also called Nardostachys jatamansi. Itis said to be slightly less sedating than tagara, but this has not beenconfirmed scientifically.Both are bitter, sweet, pungent, and astringent, although tagara is warming inpotency whereas jatamansi is somewhat cooling. Tagara is better for Vata andKapha, while jatamansi has particular value in pacifying the overheatedruminating mind that excessive Pitta can generate.PRECAUTIONSThere has been one reported case of a person taking twenty times the recommendeddose of valerian and showing mild symptoms of oversedation that fully resolvedwithin a day.15 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col40-nts15] Although therehave been concerns about morning drowsiness after taking valerian, a recentstudy comparing valerian with a standard sleeping medicine, flunitrazepam, founda hangover effect from the drug, but not from valerian.16[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col40-nts16] There was a very mild decreasein alertness within a couple hours after taking valerian.Although these effects are subtle, we do not recommend driving a car oroperating machinery if you are taking valerian during the day. Also, do not usevalerian without the approval of your health-care provider if you are taking anyprescribed sedative or tranquilizing medication.[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_083_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_084_r1.jpg]WITHANIA SOMNIFERAFAMILIAR: winter cherryLATIN: Withania somniferaSANSKRIT: ashwagandhaAshwagandha is among the most important herbs in the Ayurvedic pharmacy.Classically known for its rejuvenative benefits, it is the subject ofconsiderable modern scientific attention. It has recently been referred to as“Indian ginseng” for its reputed restorative benefits, although these twotimeless tonics, ginseng and ashwagandha, are botanically unrelated.In Sanskrit, the name ashwagandha means “the smell of a horse,” implying thatthis aromatic herb provides the strength of a stallion. It has a traditional usein supporting rejuvenation after illness and as a sexual enhancer for both menand women. Ashwagandha is sometimes referred to as an aphrodisiac, which inAyurveda is a term applied to substances that enhance the quality ofreproductive tissues as well as enlivening sexual potency. Ashwagandha is theprimary rasayana, or rejuvenative, for masculine energy.BOTANICAL AND PHYTOCHEMICAL INFORMATIONAlthough the leaves and fruit of ashwagandha have therapeutic value, most of theherbal medicine available in the West is derived from the roots of the shrub.The plant, native to India, northern Africa, and the Middle East, is nowcultivated in temperate climates around the world, including the United States.Ashwagandha contains many chemical constituents, including unique compoundscalled withanolides. The medicinal components have been characterized assteroidal alkaloids and steroidal lactones. Choline, fatty acids, amino acids,and a variety of sugars are also found in the roots of ashwagandha. Theessential oil responsible for its strong aroma has not been definitivelycharacterized.THE SCIENCE OF ASHWAGANDHAAshwagandha is often classified as an adaptogen, which means it helps to modifythe harmful effects of stress on the body. Studies in animals have suggestedthat ashwagandha can limit the damage of free radicals through its antioxidantactivity.1 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col41-nts1], 2[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col41-nts2]Ashwagandha has been shown to have a measurable effect on the immune system. Itis capable of protecting the activity of immune cells that are subjected tochemicals that usually inhibit their function.3[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col41-nts3], 4[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col41-nts4] This immune-protecting propertyof ashwagandha has been studied for the possible benefit of reducing the sideeffects of radiation and cancer chemotherapy treatments. The bone marrow ofanimals pretreated with ashwagandha that then receive radiation shows lesssuppression of production of infection-fighting white blood cells.5[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col41-nts5] A similar protective effect wasreported in animals taking ashwagandha prior to receiving a dose of the potentcancer-fighting drug cyclophosphamide.6[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col41-nts6]Ashwagandha may have a direct effect on limiting the growth of cancer cells.Extracts of ashwagandha may also increase the sensitivity of cancer cells to theeffects of radiation therapy.7 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col41-nts7]The combination of its ability to protect healthy cells while making cancerousones more susceptible to treatment suggests that ashwagandha may play animportant role in modern cancer therapy. Further studies are needed to determineif this potential benefit can be realized in people.One of the classic uses of ashwagandha is to calm mental turbulence. Somestudies looking into the influence of ashwagandha on the brain have reportedeffects on GABA receptors, the site of action of tranquilizing drugs such asValium and Ativan.8 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col41-nts8] Otherinvestigators have shown that the herb acts on acetylcholine receptors, known tobe important in the processing of memory.9[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col41-nts9] Studies on the relevancy ofthese laboratory findings to humans are limited. One report of men and womengiven daily doses of ashwagandha for forty days showed that those receiving theherb performed better on tests of logical thinking, problem solving, andreaction time than did a control group taking ginseng.10[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col41-nts10] These reports suggest that themind-tonic reputation of ashwagandha may be understood in scientific terms. Moreresearch is clearly warranted.THE PRACTICAL USE OF ASHWAGANDHAWe use ashwagandha at the Chopra Center for its tonic and rejuvenative effects.With its beneficial influence on the nervous system, we commonly prescribe itfor people who complain of fatigue, difficulty in concentrating, and a generalsense of ungroundedness. Mixed with warm milk and taken before bed, ashwagandhais useful for people with insomnia and anxiety. It has a reputation in Ayurvedaas a rejuvenative in conditions of nerve and muscle weakness. It is also usedfor men and women who are having trouble with fertility. Although it issometimes recommended in India to strengthen pregnant women, we do not recommendnonculinary herbs or spices in pregnancy until safety and efficacy studies areperformed.In patients facing cancer, ashwagandha can be a valuable ally. As discussedabove, it may have value during treatments but we more commonly recommend it inthe recuperative phase as people are attempting to regain their energy andstrength.HOW TO USE ASHWAGANDHASeveral American herbal companies are now offering ashwagandha in doses of 300to 500 milligrams. In some formulations the tablets are standardized to aspecific dose of withanolides. The usual dose is 600 to 1000 milligrams twicedaily. A tablet or teaspoon of powdered ashwagandha crushed in hot milk andsweetened with honey or sugar enhances its sedating qualities.AYURVEDA AND ASHWAGANDHAAshwagandha is a beneficial rejuvenating herb for both Vata and Kaphaimbalances. Carrying the three tastes of bitter, astringent, and sweet, it canbe a tonic for all three doshas, although because it is mildly heating it canslightly aggravate Pitta when taken in excess.PRECAUTIONSVery large doses of ashwagandha have been reported to induce abortions inanimals. Despite the lack of similar reports in human, ashwagandha should beavoided in pregnancy. Large doses may also cause mild digestive upset so itshould be used cautiously in people with known peptic ulcer disease.[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_085_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_086_r1.jpg]ZINGIBER OFFICINALEFAMILIAR: gingerLATIN: Zingiber officinaleSANSKRIT: andraka (fresh); sunthi (dry)Known in Ayurveda as the universal remedy, ginger has been honored around theworld and across time for its unique culinary and medicinal properties. FromConfucius to Marco Polo to the Indian King Akbar, those who experienced theunique pungent flavor of ginger praised this powerful natural agent. Healers ofmedieval times traced the origins of ginger to the Garden of Eden, while, on theIndian subcontinent, references to this “king of spices” are found in theearliest myths. Known for its concentrated heating potency, ginger has been usedacross Asia and Africa to kindle the body’s internal fire.BOTANICAL AND PHYTOCHEMICAL INFORMATIONThe ginger plant grows to about one meter high, but it is the undergroundrhizome that is prized for its spicy aromatic flavor and aroma. About 2 percentof the rootstock consists of a yellow volatile oil that contains a number ofchemicals including camphene, zingiberine, and gingerol. The last of these,gingerol, appears to be responsible for ginger’s pungent taste.Originally from Asia, ginger is now widely cultivated throughout warm climaticregions, where its rhizomes are harvested before their first birthday. Ginger isused fresh, dried, and as a frequent ingredient in candies, chutneys, andpreserves. Drying the root increases its irritant properties, but serious sideeffects have not been described.THE SCIENCE OF GINGERGinger is best known for its effects on the digestive system. When takeninternally, it stimulates the release of salivary enzymes and enhances stomachemptying. As a result, ginger has been used successfully to treat nausea andvomiting in a number of conditions. A study from England showed that ginger canprevent nausea after gynecological surgical procedures, although a more recentreport from South Africa could not confirm this benefit.1[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col42-nts1], 2[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col42-nts2] A Swiss study looked at ginger’sefficacy in the treatment of seasickness and found it to be as useful as mostmedications commonly used, confirming an earlier report that showed ginger to beeffective in motion sickness.3 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col42-nts3],4 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col42-nts4]One of the most promising uses of ginger is in the treatment of morning sicknessassociated with pregnancy. Because of risks to the fetus, most drugs arediligently avoided during pregnancy. Ginger-root seems to offer a safe andeffective option. Studies from Denmark found that almost three out of fourpregnant women experienced some relief from their nausea without any limitingside effects.5 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col42-nts5] The GermanCommission E has suggested that ginger be avoided in pregnancy owing totheoretical concerns, although no cases of ginger toxicity have yet beenreported.Considering its widespread usage without documented problems, ginger seems to bean acceptable antinausea substance when taken in normal doses.6[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col42-nts6] Use only natural freshgingerroot to gain maximal benefit with minimal risk.Another potential use for ginger is in the treatment of nausea associated withcancer chemotherapy. In a recent animal study from India, ginger helped tostimulate the stomach to empty after a potent chemotherapy drug, cisplatin, wasgiven.7 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col42-nts7] Although there are manynew effective antinausea drugs available to treat the side effects of cancertherapies, they are generally very expensive and carry side effects. In thisstudy, ginger was found to be as effective as the most commonly used drug.Ginger also has potentially beneficial effects on circulation. Animal studiessuggest that ginger may help lower cholesterol levels and reduce the stickinessof platelets.8 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col42-nts8], 9[Simo_9780307829108_epub_nts_r1.htm#col42-nts9] A benefit that has been notedfor thousands of years is ginger’s ability to improve circulation. Both Chineseand Indian physicians prescribed ginger for people troubled by cold hands andfeet, a remedy we have found consistently helpful at the Chopra Center.THE PRACTICAL USE OF GINGERGinger is a beloved healing ally at the Chopra Center. We make fresh gingerroottea continuously available to our guests and patients, encouraging them to sipthree to four cups per day as part of their detoxification program. According toAyurveda, ginger is one of the few medicinal substances that works on all threephases of gastrointestinal function: digestion, absorption, and elimination. Weuse ginger as part of our herbal apéritif, prepared by combining freshgingerroot juice with equal parts water, lemon juice, and honey. An ounce takenat the start of a meal adds a spicy kick-start to the digestive process.The juice can also be used for external purposes when added to a carrier oil andmassaged into the sore spot. The essential volatile oil in ginger has a mildlocal heating effect. When applied to the skin for the treatment of rheumaticconditions, it stimulates local circulation, acting as a counterirritant. Aginger paste can also be applied directly to the head for the treatment oftension or migraine headaches. For sore muscles we recommend adding a fewteaspoons of ginger powder to a hot bath before soaking.Its pungent properties are also used to treat respiratory and circulatoryproblems. For people with cold hands and feet, drinking ginger tea or chewing onfresh or candied ginger can bring heat into the system. If you are feeling theonset of a cold, chew on fresh gingerroot to help clear your congested nasalpassages.If you are traveling on a boat or anticipating a turbulent plane ride, keep apiece of fresh ginger with you and nibble on it when your stomach feels queasy.If you are pregnant and experiencing morning sickness, chewing on a small pieceof ginger may settle your delicate stomach.HOW TO USE GINGERGinger is now universally available. It can be found in almost every grocerystore, where it can be purchased for less than twenty cents an ounce. It isreadily obtainable as a ground, dried powder, and can be found as a candy inmany Asian food markets.Our recipe for ginger tea uses one teaspoon of grated root per one pint of hotwater. If the tea is a little too pungent for you, try adding a teaspoon ofshredded or chopped licorice root along with the ginger. When used as anexternally applied substance, obtain the fresh juice by removing the outerfibrous layer and putting the inner part of the root through a juicer. Then mixequal parts of the ginger juice with a carrier oil such as almond or sesame, andmassage into the sore muscle or joint. To relieve a migraine, mix a tablespoonof dry powder with a few drops of hot water until it is the consistency of apaste, then apply to your forehead and temples and sit in a warm bath.AYURVEDA AND GINGERFrom an Ayurvedic perspective, ginger’s heating qualities make it useful forboth Vata and Kapha disorders. Fresh ginger is better for Vata imbalances, asits moisture content does not aggravate the dryness of the Wind element. Dryginger is good for Kapha accumulations, where both the heat and dryness canbalance the wet coldness of Kapha, expressed in such conditions as sinuscongestion and obesity.PRECAUTIONSIf you are experiencing indigestion or heartburn, limit your internal use ofginger, as it can cause overheating. Combining ginger with licorice root canhelp to balance its Pitta-aggravating properties. Since ginger appears to havemild anti-platelet-forming effects, it should be used cautiously by people whoare on prescribed blood thinners.[images/Simo_9780307829108_epub_087_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"8NAVIGATING THE HERBAL FORESTThroughout this book we have presented our view that herbal medicines arevaluable components of a holistic health approach. During your exploration ofthe different botanical allies we have described, several important questionsmay have arisen in your mind. When discussing herbs, we commonly hear thefollowing ones:• How do I determine which herb I should take?• Over what period of time should I take an herbal remedy?• Is it beneficial to take several herbs together?• Can I safely mix herbs and pharmaceutical drugs?• What is the appropriate role of other, non-herbal nutritional supplements?These are significant questions, and you will get many different answersdepending upon the experience, background, and theoretical framework of theperson you ask. Before offering you our responses, we again want to remind youto evaluate honestly the other important aspects of your life before expectingan herb to heal you. Take time each day to settle your mind through meditation.Commune with nature on a regular basis. Focus on eating a healthy, balanced dietwith abundant fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and beans. Be sure to get enoughrest. Minimize toxic substances, emotions, and relationships in your life. Onlyafter you have addressed these essential elements of good health is it time toconsider the appropriate use of herbal medicines. An herb is much more likely tobe effective if your overall lifestyle is nurturing to your body, mind, andsoul. So, without claiming that we have the definitive answers, we offer ourresponses to the questions posed above.HOW DO I DETERMINE WHICH HERB I SHOULD TAKE?We recommend beginning with a rasayana or rejuvenative herb if you are notfacing a specific or serious health concern. A daily dose of ginseng or gotukola can help raise your overall level of well-being. According to Ayurveda, theherbal tonic jam derived from amalaki (traditionally called Chavan Prash) can betaken by almost anyone, regardless of age or sex. Rejuvenative substances aredesigned to provide balanced herbal nutrition to enhance the body’s naturalresistance to illness. They are best considered subtle foods that provide anherbal foundation to strengthen mind-body integration.If, after taking a general herbal tonic, you feel the specific need to enlivenyour masculine energy, consider adding ashwagandha or atmagupta to your diet. Ifyou feel your feminine energy is lacking, try taking shatavari or black cohosh.A basic rejuvenative such as amalaki combined with ashwagandha or shatavari maybe all you need to maintain optimal vitality.Using an herb for a specific symptom or ailment requires sensitivity andawareness. We recommend that you first identify your primary health concern andchoose one or two herbs that address your problem. Be certain that you arereceiving a high-quality botanical agent, and take it as recommended. Althoughmany herbal formulas contain dozens of components, be sure that you arereceiving enough of any individual one to justify its inclusion. We generally donot encourage people to take more than a few supplements at a time. Be clearabout your intended outcome, and tune in to your body’s inner wisdom to see ifyou are achieving the effects you are seeking.If, after an adequate period of time, you are not satisfied with the results,consider discontinuing the supplements you are taking and reevaluating theproblem at another level. For example, if you have been dealing with recurrentviral infections, rather than trying other immune-enhancing herbs, considergoing on a detoxification program for a couple of weeks to cleanse your system.Then add a rejuvenative herb to boost your body’s immunity. The effective use ofherbal medicines is more art than science, and the artistry requires that youregularly check in with your inner intelligence.OVER WHAT PERIOD OF TIME SHOULD I TAKE AN HERBAL REMEDY?If you are dealing with a chronic health concern, you may need to take an herbfor at least a couple of months before you notice its benefit. We often seepeople who are simultaneously taking many different nutritional supplements, buthave not allowed enough time with any substance to adequately assess itseffects. If you are experiencing incomplete benefits, it may be helpful toincrease the amount you are taking. In our experience the safest way to do thisis to add another dose during the day. In other words, if your muscle ache isslightly reduced by taking guggulu twice daily, increase your intake to threetimes a day. It is important to remember that most herbs are subtle medicinalsubstances and need time to help your mind and body reestablish balance.Patience is an important virtue in healing.It is also helpful to bear in mind that some herbs work best when taken on acontinuous basis, and that others have a limited duration of efficacy. Echinaceais a good example of an herb that is best used for a short time during the earlystages of a cold or flu, but loses its potency if taken regularly. Herbs thathave an influence on the mind, such as kava kava or valerian, are also best usedon an intermittent basis.IS IT BENEFICIAL TO TAKE SEVERAL HERBS TOGETHER?There is not a simple answer to this question. In many of the traditionalmedical systems, the combining of numerous herbs into a formula has been therule. The classical texts of Ayurveda and traditional Chinese medicine expoundthe view that the blending of different herbs has a synergistic action and canminimize undesirable side effects. Modern medicine takes the opposite point ofview, with an emphasis on standardized single chemicals. We take a middle road.Our experience has demonstrated that combining different herbs can balance andpotentiate their efficacy. On the other hand, formulas that contain dozens ofbotanical constituents in subtherapeutic doses are unlikely to produce thedesired effects. If you are taking a large number of nutritional supplements andyou experience an adverse reaction, it is difficult to identify the responsibleagent. We encourage you to gain as much information as possible about the herbalproduct you are taking and, to the extent possible, keep it simple.CAN I SAFELY MIX HERBS AND PHARMACEUTICAL DRUGS?The classical medical systems never addressed this question because synthesizeddrugs were not available at the time they were compiling their herbalformularies. We do not support the point of view that because herbs are“natural” they do not negatively interact with pharmacological medications.There are enough reports in the medical literature on adversesupplement/medication interactions to tread cautiously when mixing herbs withdrugs. Calming herbs may potentiate the tranquilizing effects of drugs. Herbsthat have a blood-thinning action may interfere with anticoagulant medications.How an herb is metabolized and eliminated from the body can influence themetabolism and elimination of drugs.Our approach at the Chopra Center is to use herbs sparingly if a person is on aprescribed medication. If the possibility exists of eliminating a medicine andaccomplishing similar benefits with a natural approach, we monitor thetransition very carefully. We encourage you strongly to have an open and honestdialogue with your health-care provider before adding a medicinal herb ordiscontinuing any prescription medication. Do not risk your health throughdenial or wishful thinking. On the other hand, we believe it is a worthy goal tofind the subtlest approach that can accomplish the intended outcome.WHAT IS THE APPROPRIATE ROLE OF OTHER, NON-HERBAL NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS?We envision a nutritional spectrum that spans the range from food on one end todrugs on the other. In between are supplements and herbs. As anyone who hasrecently walked into a health-food store is aware, there is an explosive growthin the nutriceutical world; dozens of new isolated substances are coming tomarket with a wide range of claimed health benefits. Nutritional derivativesincluding pycnogenols, coenzyme Q-10, grapeseed extract, green tea catechins,quercetin, MSM, blue-green algae, SAM-e, carnitine, and others are beingconsumed by increasing numbers of people. The research on many of thesesubstances is often compelling, but it is difficult to know how to use themappropriately other than in a scattershot manner. In several of our vitamin andcirculation formulas we have included these derivatives in combination withstandard vitamins and minerals, because we believe the preliminary data warrantstheir inclusion. We view them as helping to supplement the nutritional value offood, but not as a substitute for good nutrition or for the appropriate use ofherbal medicines.Our recommendation for you is to do what we do—monitor the data. When we learnabout a new supplement, we gather as much information as possible before addingit to our nutritional program. Research what is known, and determine whether itsintended benefits are of particular value for you. Our general principle is“when in doubt, leave it out.” Again, do not substitute the latest extractedagent for freshly prepared delicious meals.NEW CONTEMPORARY MEDICINEThe evolutionary process moves in spirals. As our society circles back around toa more natural approach, we believe it is important to keep an open heart andmind, integrating the best of the old and the new. To us this means that whetheran approach is ancient or modern does not, on it own, insure its significance.The only constant in life is change, and we must be open to a dynamic vision ofhealing if we are not to overlook potentially valuable approaches. On the otherhand, in our exuberance to find the fountain of youth, we must temper ourenthusiasm for every new promise with a mature, balanced assessment. Our goal isnothing short of perfect health. To this end, we hope that The Chopra CenterHerbal Handbook provides you with a valuable map for this stage of your journey."},{"pageContent":"EPILOGUEWisdom traditions from time immemorial proclaim that the human body and thecosmic body are reflections of each other. The intelligence that orchestratesthe activity of our minds and bodies is the same as that which orchestrates theactivity of the universe.When we look out at nature and see a plant, we normally do not say to ourselves,“This plant has a body and a mind.” And yet the intelligence that isorchestrating the activity of the plant is the same as the intelligence withinus. The environment is our extended body, and the plants and trees of thisplanet are aspects of ourselves. We are intimately and inseparablyinterconnected. We share the same raw materials—the same recycled earth, lifeforce, mind, and spirit. The ancient sages declared that the inner intelligenceof our bodies is the ultimate and supreme genius of nature, and mirrors thewisdom of the universe.In the pages of this book you have gained a lot of information about how thebody/mind of the herbal kingdom functions. When you read about the properties ofherbs, you are learning about how the universe expresses itself in the botanicaldomain of awareness. When you ingest the herb, you are using the elements andforces in your extended body/mind—the world of plants—to correct the mistakes inyour personal body/mind.Knowledge and information are not synonymous. As we look at the great strides wehave made in the biological sciences, we see that in many instances we havesacrificed wisdom for knowledge, knowledge for information, and information fordata. The data is of minimal value if it does not lead to the expansion ofwisdom. No book can replace your inner knowing, your inner genius, your innerwisdom. However, we hope this book will inspire you to explore those domains ofawareness where you intuitively feel how to use the inner and outer resources ofnature to enliven your healing process. Read this book carefully, over and overagain. Study the traditional applications of the different herbs and formulas,but most important, listen to your body. Even as you make use of the suggestionsin this book, become aware of the intuitive, wondrous, miraculous processes inyour own body. At the same time, cultivate the awareness of what is happening inyour subtle body—your emotions, feelings, memories, and desires.In time you will begin to witness your self as you breathe, move, sit, eat,digest, metabolize, eliminate, and experience the world through your fivesenses. Creating balance in body and mind is the first step in healing, buthealth is more than the absence of disease. It is more than physical, emotional,and social well-being. It is more than fitness and vitality. Health isultimately a higher state of consciousness.Ayurveda reminds us that we are ripples of awareness in a vast ocean ofconsciousness. Every time we become imbalanced, even with a minor illness, itreflects a disruption in our harmonious relationship to the whole. The universecontains within its very nature the ability to reestablish balance. The cosmosis too grand, too powerful, and too intelligent to tolerate disruption for long.When we consciously participate in restoring our well-being to its ultimatelevel, we join in the cosmic dance. Health becomes more than just physical,emotional, and social fitness. It becomes the spontaneous fulfillment ofdesires. It becomes a domain of awareness in which there is magic, enthusiasm,and wonder. It becomes a state of personal transformation—a journey intohealing. It becomes a journey toward God. Nothing less will provide the level ofhealth we are all seeking. Nothing less will satisfy us."},{"pageContent":"NOTESCHAPTER 1.THE HERBAL RENAISSANCE1 [Simo_9780307829108_epub_c01_r1.htm#c01-nts1a].
