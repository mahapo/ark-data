What do you see? Teens glued to a video gameor hanging out in shopping malls. Teens who hate school and make fun of anyonewho is different from them. And when they try to be funny, teens come off as toosmart for their teachers and too cool for their parents.In other words, they have no soul.But my experience tells a very different story. Teenagers worry about theirsouls more than any other group. Life is a riddle they are eager to solve butalso feel troubled by. Teens really want to know who they are. They are oldenough not to accept the stories given to children when the big questions comeup:Where’s my life going?Does God really exist?Why does he allow so many bad things to happen?Do I matter?How am I ever going to make a difference?Since you are a teenager holding this book in your hands, all these questionshave run through your mind at some time. But I bet that since you first askedthem, somewhere back in your childhood, most of the answers you received aren’tthat helpful anymore.This isn’t a book about Grandma going to heaven when she dies or God frowningdown on you when you swipe cookies from the cookie jar. Whenever I talk withteenagers, they report having heard things like this as a child. They discoveredsomething that’s very true: Adults squirm when the big questions come up,especially the big spiritual ones. They don’t want their kids to worry, so theygive answers that all say one thing: “Don’t worry. It’s all okay.”And yet the big questions still keep coming up. At every age we all need to knowwhat life is really all about. Not just on the surface, but deep down.Teenagers are no exception. They deserve a spiritual life all their own. Onethat offers the kind of comfort we hope to give our children, but is differentat the same time. More full of ideas. More mature. More fitting for the wholewide future that lies ahead.That’s what I’ve tried to do in this book, as fully and as honestly as possible.Not all the answers are nice answers. Does God let bad things happen? Yes; notalways, but quite a lot of the time. Does that mean he is cruel? No, but you’rereally going to have to think, because a person who sits back and lets badthings happen is often cruel. Why is God different from a person, then? Let’stalk about it.That’s the kind of discussion you are going to find in these pages—challengingbut not delivered in big words or nice thoughts that aren’t really all true.It’s based on the questions teenagers actually ask me. Some were asked inperson, at public talks. Others were asked around the dinner table, because myson and daughter, Gotham and Mallika, were full of questions when they wereteenagers (they’re now adults and happily married, with families of their own).The remaining questions were submitted over the Internet, where a Web site wasset up to invite teenagers to ask anything they wanted to know aboutspirituality.So here it is, the thing you asked for. Not just answers to the big questions,but a guide to spirit as seen through the eyes of teenagers, a special group insociety that deserves a spiritual life different from anyone’s before or since.I salute your uniqueness and invite you to read on."},{"pageContent":"1HOW SPIRIT WORKS(…AND IT DOES WORK)I was shuffling through a pile of questions that teenagers had asked, and onepopped to the surface. It’s so easy to answer, and yet it’s so important that Iknew I had to begin with this one.Dear Deepak,If you could change one thing about the history of our Earth, what would it be?That question came from a fourteen-year-old boy. Now, what if you asked it, notto me, but to yourself? There’s a lot of changes you might wish for. You mightwish that nobody had discovered gunpowder, since that led to such an enormousincrease in terrible wars. You might wish that medicine had discovered cures fordiseases centuries ago, or that every baby who had ever been born survived tolead a productive life.But my answer would be different. When it comes down to one and only one choice,here is mine: I wish everyone knew from birth that they had a soul.You might not think that’s much of a change. Doesn’t everyone already know theyhave a soul? Certainly everyone—or nearly everyone—istold that they have a soul.But being told and knowing are two different things.If you truly knew you had a soul, you could change the world. Which is what I’minviting you to do. The world is changed from the inside. All the greatestpeople you can think of became great from the inside. Albert Einstein becamegreat by dreaming in a new way about time and space. Leonardo da Vinci becamegreat by imagining inventions that did not come to pass for hundreds of years(did you know that he sketched a helicopter four hundred years before the Wrightbrothers learned to fly?) and by having a vision of a new way to paint.Yet there is a kind of greatness open to you right now, even if you think youare a very ordinary, average person. It’s the greatness of living from yoursoul. What does that mean?LIVING FROM THE SOULImagine that you could have a thought and it would come true.Imagine that you could feel safe and at peace, no matter what happened aroundyou.Imagine that you could love yourself as much as you wanted others to loveyou—and more.Imagine that you could wake up every day to greet a new world.Imagine that you could feel the presence of God.Anyone who achieved these things would be considered a great success in life.I’m pretty sure that, as a teenager, you worry about how to make a good life foryourself. It can seem like an incredibly difficult project. But if all thosethings I asked you to imagine came true, wouldn’t that be real success? Livingfrom the level of the soul isn’t about being goody-goody and hoping that Godnotices and smiles down on you. It’s about the best kind of life you canpossibly lead.One fifteen-year-old boy asked a really important, basic question:Dear Deepak,What is the difference between religion and spirituality?To me, they don’t have to be different at all. To be religious and spiritual canand should be the same thing. But we have to be real here, and religion almostalways means a traditional faith like Christianity or Islam or Judaism. It’spracticed in groups. It takes place in churches or mosques or synagogues. Thereis a given set of beliefs, along with priests, scriptures, and services.Spirituality, on the other hand, doesn’t need a group. It is done one person ata time, almost always in private. I think every spiritual person reads inspiringscriptures, often from many different religious traditions. Such a person may ormay not go to church. They may or may not know the set of beliefs that guide thefaithful. So you can be deeply spiritual and yet not be a “good” Catholic, Jew,or Muslim. This book isn’t about religion. It’s about the spiritual side, theprivate life of the soul.A Spiritual QuizQ: I think I am spiritual, but I’m not sure, especially when things start goingwrong. Then I feel really alone. I’m all by myself, still struggling.A: I think what makes spirit real is change. Spirit changes you, and when thechange is very big, it can be called a transformation. Fairy tales are about achild’s deep wish to be changed: Frogs transform into princes, ugly ducklingstransform into swans. The amazing thing about human nature is that we are theonly creatures on Earth who can transform ourselves just because we want to. Acaterpillar has no choice but to be reborn as a butterfly. You do have a choice.Here’s a quiz to show you just how many things in your life—things you probablytake for granted—could be transformed. Then you can see in advance what spiritcould be doing for you right now.WHAT CAN SPIRIT DO FOR YOU?Directions:Put a check8 [Images/8.jpg] beside each sentence that you agree with most ofthe time. Then score yourself (25 points maximum) by counting up the totalnumber of checks. * box [Images/box.jpg] I worry about what my body looks like. * box [Images/box.jpg] What others think about my body is important. * box [Images/box.jpg] If I had a better body, people would like me more. * box [Images/box.jpg] I should work hard to get a better body. * box [Images/box.jpg] It’s always better to have more money. * box [Images/box.jpg] If you don’t have money, you won’t be able to lead a good life. * box [Images/box.jpg] My personality bothers people, and I wish it didn’t. * box [Images/box.jpg] Being supported by others is really important to me. * box [Images/box.jpg] Going against the group doesn’t pay.

Compared with most teens, you don’tfeel insecure and you don’t depend so much on externals such as approval fromothers. You have a sense that outer things like money and popularity aren’tall-important. Your sense of security will be an excellent foundation for thespiritual journey that lies ahead.11-20 pointsSpirit can do a lot to make you feel more secure and happy. Right now you dependa lot on conforming to the group and making sure that your life has comfortablethings in it. Body image is important to you because you don’t want to lookdifferent, and secretly you wish you were perfect. You look upon externals asimportant because almost everyone you know believes this too.21-25 pointsYou are very hungry for spirit, even though you might not know this yet. Whatyou do know is that you are frightened that you don’t fit in. Group pressurehasn’t helped, because you want to be approved of so much that any kind ofnegative reaction makes you miserable. In your fantasies you’d like to have asmuch money, fame, and success as possible because you don’t really see any otherroute to happiness. For you, contact with your soul will bring much moresecurity and peace of mind if you stick with the spiritual journey and don’t getdiscouraged.After taking this quiz, you might ask, “What was spiritual about thesequestions? You didn’t even mention the soul, and God came up only once.” Ididn’t mention spirit because, to me, being spiritual is about knowing yourselfand finding the deep secrets of happiness. The more you look for happiness inexternal things, the farther you are from your soul. Being a teenager brings allkinds of peer pressure, and for most people, adapting to the group sets thestage for the rest of their adult life. However, this is also a great age tolearn to turn inward and find out what’s really going on inside you.There was a famous medical study in which thousands of Harvard graduates werefollowed from college onward until they reached fifty and beyond. The studywanted to find out the reasons that men get so many premature heart attacks (thestudy began in the 1950s, when the epidemic of heart attacks was highest in thiscountry).You might think that heart attacks strike people who are the most stressed, whoeat a bad diet, or who have a history of heart disease in their family. Thosefactors certainly do contribute. But the surprising fact is that in this studythe number one risk was none of these. It was whether the person had taken timeto really look at himself. Men who faced their inner conflicts and problems veryearly, in their twenties, were least likely to have a heart attack. Men whoavoided looking inward had the most heart attacks.This study made a big impression on me when I started out as a doctor, because Isaw that something invisible made a huge difference in people’s bodies. Thoughtswere killing people, if you really come down to it, while changing thosethoughts helped their hearts to remain alive. That’s a big clue to why thespiritual life is actually the best life you can lead, even on the physicallevel.God for a DayQ: If you could be God for a day, would you?A: When you live from your soul, you are coming as close as you can to beingGod. And not just for a day. Your soul is permanent. It is always with you,always urging you to become more than you think you can be. Of course no one canactually be God—I have a hard time even imagining what it would be like to beGod for a day. God is infinite, and I can’t imagine being infinite. God knowseverything at once. God is beyond time. God is in every atom of creation. Ican’t imagine those things either.But I can imagine touching my soul with my mind and my heart. When I do that, mysmall speck of God is present with me. Then I don’t have to fall back onimagining—I can have a spiritual life for real. And so can you.Most people don’t realize this because they don’t really know their own soul.First of all, your soul is invisible.You know you have a face and hands and that they are attached to a body. No onehas to tell you those things. You know you have feelings, even though they areinvisible, and thoughts in your head. No one has to tell you about those,either.SLEEPY SOULSMany people go through life as if they don’t know they have a soul. Somebodytold them they did, but it didn’t sink in. Or not very deeply. In these cases,the soul grew sleepy; it drifted off into a kind of never-never land, where itstill lives. You can’t see it because it’s too far away. You can’t visit it orlisten in on it, because wherever this never-never land is, nobody knows how toget there. So basically the soul is a nice story, and when things get reallyrough, you can always fall back on this strange, invisible thing called yoursoul, which is your connection to God. (And to be really honest, does he seem tobe any closer? God, too, lives in an invisible place far away from Earth,although we all were told in childhood that when you die, you will go to thatplace to meet him. Or her. Let’s be fair and give God a chance to be either a heor a she—or maybe both.)I want to clear up this mystery and bring the soul back down to Earth. If Icould imagine changing the history of the world, that’s the change I would havemade long, long ago. (Although I must admit that half the fun is searching foryour soul, so perhaps the world was created perfectly just the way it is.)The fact that you are reading this book means that you are already searching foranswers and seeking your soul. You are into the mystery. You are excited, Ihope, by the chase. Let’s chase together, because at your side I can show youhow spirit works here and now.If you know about that, you will have a huge advantage, not just in thespiritual chase, but in the game of life.SPIRIT WORKSTo me, that’s always number one. If you ask me whether angels are real, forexample, I will give you my personal opinion, but I will also step outside mypersonal opinion to give you an answer that will work for you.These answers will make you think on your own.These answers will be honest. If I don’t know how to solve a problem, I willtell you so.These answers will open a door.An open door is what everyone really needs. Unless I open a door into your ownlife, what good is this book? Concerning angels, anybody can say, “Sure, angelsexist.” Or they can say the opposite: “Angels are a nice story that you canbelieve in if you want to, like the tooth fairy.” One answer is yes, the otheris no. But neither one will really do you much good. You already know in advancethat some people believe in angels, while others don’t.However, if I can open a door in your mind, you might just meet an angel oneday. Or you might explore your desire to meet one so deeply that it will bringyou great peace. Or a vision. Or a road to heaven. I don’t know exactly whereyour doors will lead to, but I do know that you need to have as many open doorsas possible.AN ANGEL STORYI do have a good angel story, though. Right after World War I there was an oldvillage priest in France. He was much beloved by all the villagers, whoconsidered him very holy and very brave. You see, he had gone into the trencheswith the common soldiers in the heat of battle so that he could pray with them.Sometimes he had to deliver the last rites to the young fighters, who were noolder than teenagers, many of them.One day the priest got caught in an attack of mustard gas, a poison that driftedthrough the air and did terrible damage to any part of the body that it touched.The gas touched the priest’s eyes, and he lost much of his sight.So now it’s several years after the war, and the priest is walking down a dustycountry road. Suddenly a bicycle comes speeding around the corner, moving veryfast. There’s no time for the priest to jump aside, and he can’t see well enoughto know that he’s about to be hit.All at once a stranger appears from nowhere and lifts the bicycle, rider andall, out of the road. He gently sets it down on the shoulder of the road andwalks away. The cyclist can’t believe what just happened, and he reports in thevillage that this was a genuine miracle: The stranger who appeared out ofnowhere was an angel. But the old priest, who accepts the story of whathappened, never gives an opinion one way or another. Was it an angel? Was it amiracle? The old priest never said.But I think the priest would have smiled at a saying from Albert Einstein, whopointed out that there are only two ways to look at the world: Either nothing inthe universe is a miracle, or everything is.I want to show you how to see the second way.The Greatest MiracleQ: If everything is a miracle, why haven’t I ever seen a real one?A: You have; you just didn’t notice it. A miracle is going on right before youreyes. In fact, it is the greatest miracle. It’s you. You will never see any kindof miracle until you begin to see this one first. Let’s take a short trip intoouter space. Step out into your backyard any night and look up at the sky. Thebright wash of stars that sweeps across the sky, looking like a broad ribbon, isthe Milky Way, our galaxy. It contains billions of stars, and although they lookclose together to your naked eye, in fact each one is many light-years away fromthe other.YOUR BODY IS A MIRACLENow consider this: Your body contains a thousand cells for each star in theMilky Way galaxy. But instead of floating in space like stars, these trillionsof cells are talking to one another. They know exactly what every other cell isdoing. Billions of messages shoot through your nervous system, your bloodstream,and everywhere else in your body. You cannot take a breath of air into yourlungs without its being known by your brain, your liver, even the tiniest bloodcell far away in your little toe.That’s only the beginning of the miracle. Right now your brain is reading thesewords (it is also doing hundreds of other things simultaneously, but we can talkabout only one miracle at a time). Your brain uses only one basic food to doeverything it does, a food called glucose, or blood sugar. Now, blood sugarisn’t that different from the white sugar in your kitchen cabinet. Take that bagof sugar off the shelf and ask it to think. Ask it to read a book or fall inlove. It can’t, no matter how long you wait. How did blood sugar learn to fallin love? It cannot be explained. The miracle of your body encloses many, manyother miracles.Just so that you are convinced, let me give another amazing example. Theelements sodium and chlorine are very nasty stuff. Sodium is extremelypoisonous, and chlorine is such a toxic gas that taking just a whiff of it wouldimmediately start to kill the cells in the nose. Yet when sodium and chlorineare combined, what do you get? Salt, a chemical totally necessary to lifeitself. Now, how did two radical poisons ever get together to make life? No onecan explain it.THE GREATEST MIRACLEHere you sit, then, the greatest miracle in existence. I could go on and onabout your miraculousness. Nobody can explain how your DNA learned to divide andduplicate itself. I’m sure you already know that this happens, since a baby isformed when one fertilized cell in the mother’s womb divides over and over toproduce the billions of cells in a newborn infant. No other chemical can divideto duplicate itself. For at least ten billion years after the big bang theuniverse rolled along, perfectly content with gases and liquids and solids thatnever duplicated even one atom. Yet DNA, which has billions of tiny connectedparts, duplicates itself every second inside you.If you are the greatest miracle, then it’s not too much for you to ask for moremiracles. That’s really how spirituality works. You notice one miracle, and itleads you on a trail hunting for more. The trip starts by sitting down andrealizing that you are a miracle. If you ever forget that fact, go back to it.Remind yourself over and over. Because walking the trail of miracles isn’talways easy. It has lots of ups and downs. Yet no matter how twisty or confusinglife becomes, your own personal miracle keeps going, in billions and billions ofcells. You are living proof that miracles exist. That’s a wonderful thing toremember at any age.Flipping the SwitchQ: Why don’t I feel like I am a miracle?A: You don’t feel like a miracle because you haven’t flipped the spiritualswitch yet. Life is choices, and some people spend year after year not flippingthe switch. Therefore, they’re not seeing any miracles at all. Imagine a darkroom at night. You walk in, but you can’t see a thing. So you flip the lightswitch, and now the things that were in darkness can be seen. Yet what did youactually do? That little switch on the wall is connected to a power plant faraway. Enormous energy is generated in the plant, all controlled by the flick ofa finger. Without the switch you would never know that you could tap into such ahuge supply of energy.Spiritual power is like electricity; it can run a lot of things. But unlikeelectricity, the power isn’t physical. It comes from the soul. Or if you like,you can say that the power begins with God or spirit itself. I don’t care whichword you use—they are all good ones. The key thing is to decide to flip theswitch. That’s the only way to see the miracles that you could be doing.The Power SourceQ: What kind of power is spiritual power?A: This is a huge question, because spiritual power is everywhere. It goesunnoticed because in a way it’s hidden behind a screen. Spirit seems to like tohide itself, yet it also likes to show itself too. To make it come out ofhiding, you have to begin to pay attention to a different part of life. Ialready mentioned that the blood sugar in your brain is not all that differentfrom the white sugar you buy at the store. But I didn’t tell you what thatdifference actually is. Blood sugar has spiritual power in it. In fact, all theatoms and molecules in your body contain the same spiritual power, so let’s lookat them a little more.A MYSTERY IN EVERY BREATHLet’s look at air. The air around you is quite amazing. When you take in yournext breath, you will be breathing in atoms that someone in China breathed out afew days ago. With each breath you will be taking in several million atomsbreathed out by Jesus Christ and Buddha. But even more amazing is this: When youbreathe in an atom of oxygen, it is invisibly filled with spiritual power. Theatom starts out as a dead, random bit of matter floating around the world. Yetthe instant it enters your lungs, it becomes alive. It attaches itself to a redblood cell and gets to work. Three seconds later it could be powering your heartor fueling a thought or doing thousands of other jobs.Life happens incredibly fast. Your cells have only three seconds of oxygeninside them, so this little oxygen atom has to race where it’s needed, and whenit arrives, it has to know exactly what to do. A fireman putting out a fire isworking very slowly compared with the oxygen in your blood, which has to slipinto a cell, where millions and millions of other atoms are working at topspeed, linked together in astoundingly complicated tasks—so complicated that Ican’t stop to describe them except to say that a high-speed computer is about amillion times simpler.The fantastic voyage of one oxygen atom takes place on a supersmall scale, yetthe power of the universe is at work here. And what is the universe’s power allabout? Exactly what you are about:Life Growth IntelligenceThese three things shape the grand plan of the universe. When oxygen floatsaround in the air, you can’t see that it’s part of the universe’s grand plan,but the instant that oxygen gets inside you, the plan fires up and gets going.Your body is nothing but a huge storm of life, growth, and intelligence. Everysingle process in it serves the grand plan, and so does every other miracle youcan name.Liferushes forward like a huge river, tumbling over obstacles, shaping thelandscape, filling up the empty places, conquering death every inch of the way.Growthbrings new things into existence, turns random matter into incredibleshapes, blossoms into dreams that come true, and turns a primitive universe ofswirling gases into amazing, complicated forms, no two ever exactly alike.Intelligenceinvents what is going on and imagines unknown stories that come truebefore your very eyes.If you want to be part of the universe’s grand plan, these three things arewhere you will get your power.Thepower of life is waiting to be ever more alive and fresh and ready to speedyou on your way.Thepower of growth is ready to unfold new regions of creation that are sleepinguntil you wake them up.Thepower of intelligence is waiting for your next idea, dream, or wish. Theseare invisible things, but spirit has placed them in your hands. You can flip theswitch and get all this power to flow through you. Unlimited power. The powerthat lights up the stars even as it lights up your life.Finding Your PowerQ: Where is this switch you’re talking about?A: In you, of course. There’s no other place it could be. There’s a wonderfulold poem by Kabir, who lived in India many centuries ago but is still reveredtoday. He says, “I visited the wisest men but didn’t find God there. I read allthe sacred books but didn’t find God there. I bathed in the holy rivers andtraveled to the most ancient temples, yet nowhere did I find God, until one dayI opened the door in my own heart, and what a surprise! There was God waitingfor me with a smile.”You’ll find the same search in every religious tradition—and the same answerbeing given. The switch you have to flip is in your own heart. We could also sayit is in your mind, because spirit doesn’t have just one home. The three powersof life, growth, and intelligence flow through every particle of you (everyparticle of this world, too).So the good news is that spirit isn’t going anywhere. You’ll never lose out onit. You’ll never misplace your portion of the universe’s power or accidentallybe left out of the cosmic plan.The trick is that all this power lies at the source, not on the surface. Mightyrivers flow from a tiny source in the mountains; where the Mississippi Riverbegins there’s a place so narrow you can walk across it with one step. So don’tworry that your source is small. At the source you already possess far morespiritual power than you can imagine. Enough to create a world. Enough totransform you. Enough to solve your deepest worries and bring about your mostcherished hopes.HUNTING FOR THE UNICORNHave you ever thought much about the unicorn, that mythical beast that isimagined as a flashing white horse with a single horn in its forehead? In theMiddle Ages many artists made paintings and tapestries describing the hunt forthe unicorn. It wasn’t an actual animal, but a symbol for Christ or God or thesoul. The tapestries and paintings showed the unicorn running through the woods,but it was understood that this mythical beast actually lived inside eachperson.The unicorn is still alive, and it still lives where it always has. You and Iare going on our own personal unicorn hunt. It may take a whole book to turn youinto a good hunter, but I’ve already shown you how the hunt begins:Know that you are a miracle.Know that you have a unique place in the cosmic plan.Know that spiritual power is yours for the asking.Know that the hunt is going to take you to your source, where all the powercomes from.Got all that? Good, because even if each thing doesn’t seem totally true rightnow, you really have flipped the switch that lights up the world. We are off andrunning. We’re not in the dark anymore.Getting More Out of LifeQ: Okay, I flipped the switch. How will I know that I am starting to bespiritual? I have friends who believe in God and go to church, but they aren’talways the nicest kids or the ones who live the best life.A: Spirituality is a way to get more out of life. I connect it to power becauseif you don’t have the power, spirituality will remain pretty thin and not veryuseful. Every other way to get more out of life takes place on the surface.You’ve already heard, over and over, that success takes hard work. You’ve beentold all the bad things that happen to anyone who drops out of school and “ruinstheir life.” You’ve been reminded about the rules of right and wrong. Youprobably have even thought about getting the right social connections and makingmoney. Preferably a lot of money.GOING DEEPERBut spirituality isn’t about any of these things. It’s about going deeper intolife and finding out what the big plan is, the universal plan that you play yourpart in. You could call this a secret voyage, because very few people know howto take it. You have to be part explorer, part psychologist, part detective.When you go on this secret voyage, only you know about it. Nothing is moreexciting. Your friends who go to church aren’t on this journey just because theygo to church. Your friends who don’t go to church aren’t missing out on thisjourney just because they don’t go to church. Everyone decides on their own, intheir heart of hearts.But one thing is for sure: Since you have spirit inside you, you are ready forthis most exciting of journeys.We’ve only peeked through the doorway of spirit, but already a dozen questionsmust be popping up in your head: How do I know God is real? How does spiritwork? What good will it do me? What can I expect to happen to me if I try to bemore spiritual?I’m going to try to answer each and every question, but here are some quickanswers in advance:Is God real?Yes, but you might be surprised how different God’s reality is from what youthink right now.How does spirit work?It works by showing you the best way to solve any challenge.What good will it do me?You will grow and grow all your life, and every step will bring you closer totruth.What can I expect to happen to me?You will be transformed. Even a month from now you might look in the mirror andsay, “Is that really me?”THE BASICSSpiritis the word I am using to describe the whole invisible world that liesbeyond your five senses. It covers everything and is therefore the most generalword we will be using. An artist who paints an inspired picture is spiritual tome, even if he doesn’t care about God. A mother’s love is spiritual—in fact, alllove is spiritual.The wordsoul means your own spirit, your personal spark of creation. To me, thesoul is my source. Every thought, wish, desire, dream, and fantasy can be tracedback to the soul. It has also been called your higher self. It’s the part of youthat belongs with God at all times.Godmeans the creator, but more than that. God is the highest and purestintelligence in the universe. He (or she) stands for all the sacred things thatyou will be searching for on your inner journey: truth, faith, love,inspiration, creativity. If any of these words are important to you, you arealready standing at the beginning of your search for God.Where Am I Going?Q: If I take this spiritual journey, where does it end? Do I get to see God? DoI become a holy person like a saint?A: Traditionally the spiritual journey ends when you are enlightened. This isn’tan easy word. When I came to America from India, the whole concept of“enlightened” did a flip-flop. In India, where I grew up, an enlightened personwas like a holy saint, someone who had gone beyond all the sorrows and ignoranceof normal life. To be enlightened meant you were close to God. In America, whereI took my first job as a doctor, the most enlightened people were scientists.They generally looked upon spirituality as superstition, and beliefs about Godwere something you kept to yourself and didn’t talk about.STAGES OF THE JOURNEYSo I’ve thought and thought, for more than twenty years, about how to presentthe spiritual journey. And here’s my sketch of two people who have made realspiritual progress. You can use these outlines as a kind of mirror to the waysyou will change.#1: Making ProgressThe first person has really taken spirituality seriously. He (or she) startedout wanting more self-knowledge. If you met him, you would immediately noticethat he’s not just an ordinary person. He’s pretty unique. The approval ofothers isn’t that important. He’s not that impressed by money. He doesn’tbelieve that just because you’re better off, that means you’re better.Over time he has found quite a lot of inner peace. Extreme events can shake himout of this peace, but he isn’t thrown off balance for long. He isn’t scared byhis own emotions, and when he feels a strong worry or a burst of anger, he knowsthat this is just a passing event. In general he has learned to love andappreciate life, both his own life and the life around him. Other people aresouls equal to his, and for that he offers respect. He doesn’t judge people byexternals. He has found a way to forgive the wrongs done to him, and he can alsoforgive himself.If you asked him what he is proud of, he would point to his vision of life andthe love that has come to him.If you asked him who he is, he would say, “I am a work in progress.”#2: A Real MasterThe second person has done enough spiritual work to be truly transformed. If youmet her (or him), you’d notice a strong presence of peace. This person feelswise. Her inner peace is rock solid. Without hesitating, she is kind to you, andafter two seconds you know you can trust her completely.MAKING PROGRESSKEY WORDSSecureAt peaceAble to forgiveAcceptingKnowing yourself wellLovingFollowing your visionSeeing your life as successfulShe loves life and everything in it. Everyday anxiety about the world’s badstate doesn’t shake her belief in spirit. Somehow she has found a way toenvision life as perfect. Her knowledge of human nature runs very deep, and sodoes her knowledge of God and spirit. She doesn’t just talk about spirit; shelives it at every moment.If you asked her what she is proudest of, she might surprise you by having nopride at all. Or she would say that she is proud to be a drop in the eternalocean of Being.If you asked her who she is, she would say, “I am one with everything.”These are very brief sketches, but in them I’ve tried to show you who you couldbe. Person #1 could easily be you if you really want to go on the spiritualjourney. All you have to do is start making progress. Life isn’t about beingperfect, it’s about being a little better every day. Person #1 knows this. Bymaking a little progress every day, he (or she) has overcome a lot of the doubtand insecurity that you probably know all too well. We all know doubt andinsecurity. They don’t go away just with wishing. They don’t get better just bygrowing up. You have to turn inward to find a place inside yourself that you cantrust as your home and safe haven. The world around us isn’t going to changeautomatically for the better, so you have to. Every day is a challenge, andgoing inward is the best way to meet those challenges. Person #1 was just likeyou as a teenager, but now he has learned how to change himself to meet thechallenge of life.A REAL MASTERKEY WORDSReverenceUnityBeingWisdomIn tune with everythingTotally at peaceDeep trust in GodCompassionPerson #2 is someone I call a master. I could use other terms, likesage, saint,guru, orenlightened one. Those words are a bit too loaded for me, meaning thatsome people have negative opinions about them that they’ve picked up along theway. But everyone, I think, wants to be a master at something. Masters knowtheir craft very, very well. They aren’t beginners anymore. They have experienceand skill under their belt. If that appeals to you, why not take it a stepfurther and be a master of your own self? Person #2 has done that. She has goneinto the light and discovered her true home. She may never say the wordGod, butshe has a deep reverence for all of creation. Hers is a blessed life, and my ownlife’s journey is modeled on such visionaries. They are like the older, wiserbrothers and sisters of humanity. I hope you are fortunate enough to meet such aperson, because once you do, you will never forget them. Masters have a presencethat is truly astonishing. But they aren’t aliens. They don’t come from anotherplanet. They are the result of the transformation that you are about to begin atthis very moment. Which means mastery could be in your future too.MAKING PROGRESSREMINDERSA journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.This is my journey. I can travel it at my own speed.My soul is always with me.My life is about spirit, even when it seems to be about a thousand other things.I am a unique part of the cosmic plan. I am needed in the universe.I am about life, growth, and intelligence. Every day I can acquire a little moreof each.The greatest person on Earth may be a huge bonfire compared with my littlecandle, but both are made from the same light.First StepsQ: I am excited by all these new ideas, but I admit that I am also a totalbeginner. What do I have to do to go on the spiritual journey?A: There are three steps that will ignite your spirit and bring it out ofhiding. They are simple steps; you don’t need to be special or gifted or smartto take them.Step #1Notice the hints life is giving you. I am talking about unusual things thathappen every day. For example, have you ever thought of somebody’s name and thenhad that person call you on the phone a moment later? Have you had a dream thatcame true or said a prayer that was granted? These are hints coming from thesoul, and so are the following experiences from young people:A REAL MASTERREMINDERSAt my age every master was still a student.Learning is the key to greatness.My soul is already a master.My goal is to live from the soul.The power of a master is part of God’s power.The universe is thinking and living through me at this very second.I really love rainbows. It’s like magic when one appears, and although thissounds weird, I have actually asked for a rainbow and then seen one that day.I was looking after my baby brother when he was two. He was a real handfulthen—the terrible twos. But after running around, he got settled down, and whenhe fell asleep, I had the feeling that I was looking at an angel. I wished Icould be as peaceful as he looked lying on the carpet sleeping.Step #2Make the spiritual clues in your life, even the tiny ones,significant. Payattention. Don’t turn your back on what your soul is saying. This is importantbecause the conversation with your soul is two-way. A hint coming to you is likethe soul saying, “Hello, are you there?” and when you pay attention, you arereplying, “Yes, I’m here.” Most people don’t acknowledge their clues, which islike hanging up the phone when somebody calls you. The conversation is suddenlyover.Here are some experiences that young people did find significant:I was hiking up in the mountains, and we came to a mountain lake. My friend andI took out our cameras to take pictures. Just at that instant all the cloudsparted, and a big ray of sunshine hit the mountain lake. I had a shiver go downmy spine, as if God was noticing us and smiling down.I don’t tell anybody this, but sometimes I feel as if I love everyone in thewhole world.I think I have seen a light around me, or at least I dreamed that I was in thelight. It’s happened only a few times, but this experience made a big impressionon me.Step #3Valuewhat you are experiencing. Only the things you think are valuable arereally going to grow and improve. If you own a new car but let it go without anoil change or a wash, you are not giving it any value, and therefore it runsdown much more quickly. If you don’t value what your soul tells you, yourexperiences will fade away quickly. By saying to yourself, “This is important. Ireally want to know what my soul is saying,” you are making the spiritualconnection stronger every day.Here are experiences that two young people valued:I was playing football and it was a really tense game. A long pass came my way,and as I jumped up to catch it, I had the feeling that time slowed down. I was,like, in a slow-motion movie, and for that one moment I was sure the ball wasgoing straight into my hands. (It did.)I have days when I really feel like I’m walking on air. If I stepped on a scale,my body would be half as light as usual. On these days I feel I could doanything. The whole world is friendly to me. God is on my side.HINTS FROM SPIRITDid any of these happen to you today?A feeling of lightness in your body.A streaming or flowing sensation in your body.A sense that all is well, that you are at home in the world.A feeling of complete peacefulness.A feeling of landing in a soft place where you are safe.A feeling that you are not what you seem to be, that you have been playing apart that isn’t the real you.A feeling that something lies beyond the sky or behind the mirror.A thought that said, “I know more than I think I do.”A thought that said, “I need to find out what’s real.”A thought that said, “I need to find out who I really am.”Your inner voices became very quiet.You suddenly sensed that you were walking through a dream.You could do something without having to think about it (this is automaticaction).You sensed a greater power acting through you.You acted out of your own truth, not what others think or say.You got something you really wanted without having to struggle for it.Things started coming really easily.You stopped fighting back, and yet things worked out all right.You sensed that your life is part of a larger plan.You realized that you are cared for.You realized that your life has purpose, you matter.You sensed that random events are not random, but form a pattern.You saw that you are unique.You realized that life can run itself. Everything is taken care of.You felt drawn to your center.You realized with wonder that life is infinitely worthwhile.I imagine you are a bit surprised by these three steps. They don’t involveanything religious. In fact, they are just new mental habits. If you are lookingfor a new friend, having just moved to a new town, what do you do?Younotice people who might be potential friends.You putsignificance on the gestures of friendship that somebody might show you,such as helping you find a class or complimenting you on how you are dressed.Youvalue those people who are willing to accept you and take you into theircircle.Finding your soul is not that different from finding a new friend. By now you’velearned my little trick, that I don’t use the spiritual terms you are used tofrom church or Sunday school. But these three steps are very spiritual anyway,and here’s why:You are much more than you think you are. At this moment you are leading aspiritual life, only you haven’t noticed it (most people don’t, so that’s not afailing). Your soul is always sending you hints about where your spirit wantsyou to go. All I want you to do is notice those hints, give them a bit ofsignificance, and then value them. If you do that, something very surprisingwill happen. You will start to make friends with your soul. You will open up achannel to spirit simply by paying attention.So, what are these hints your soul is dropping? I am going to give you a longlist because I don’t want to leave any out. Don’t be alarmed or discouraged. I’mnot asking you to notice everything on the list, much less to memorize it. Mypurpose is to open your eyes to how many ways spirit is trying to make contactevery day.In one way or another the greatest spiritual experiences in history are allconnected to this list. I would call all of these experiences hints from thesoul. They are how someone, young or old, is beginning to think, feel, and actfrom the level of spirit. If you are close enough to your parents or to a goodfriend you can be really honest with, sit down sometime and discuss the items onthe list. That’s valuable because these aren’t experiences we tend to talkabout. Around the dinner table families talk about events of the day or wherethey need to be in an hour or what’s on television. With friends we tend togossip or talk about school and parents. How amazing it would be if we talkedinstead, even once, about the state of our souls.Naturally, that’s quite a high level of communication, so having even one ofthese experiences in a day is quite good. It shows that you are starting to beawake to your soul.A DOCTOR’S STORYI know that this list may seem very abstract, so let me make it a bit morepersonal. When I was a young doctor, I had time for only two things: work andfamily. I got up around five each morning and rushed off to the first hospitalwhere I had patients. By eight in the morning I might have gotten to two orthree more hospitals before starting to see patients in my office. At noon Iusually ate at my desk because there was always a backup of patients waiting tosee me; I never had time to step out and eat in a nice restaurant. Work camefirst. Always.The day didn’t end after the last patient walked out the door. I had to revisitthe hospitals I’d gone to that morning, and so I arrived home, dead tired,around suppertime, if I was lucky. Many days I didn’t get home until after dark.My wife and I dearly loved our two little babies, but it’s a wonder that theyeven knew their daddy’s face sometimes. Between work and family I didn’t have aclue about the very things I put on this list. I had no spiritual life thatreally touched me, because there simply wasn’t enough attention to go around.Gradually that began to change. Partly because my mother was so spiritual,partly because I took an interest in spiritual books, and partly because ofsomex factor I don’t know about, I changed. I began to notice things. The listof items I am asking you to notice all happened to me. I was getting hints fromspirit all the time, and once I paid some attention to them, once I gave themsignificance and value, you know what happened? More and more clues came my way.That’s how it always is. What you pay attention to grows in your life. Have youknown people who get angry very quickly? If you spend time around them, you’lldiscover very soon that they find a lot of things that set them off. Innocent,tiny things that nobody else gets angry about, such as a car parked the wrongway, a slow ticket line at the movie theater, or random remarks from strangers.Their anger is what they keep returning to, over and over, fueling it with tinyevents during the day. That’s the negative side of paying attention. Thepositive side is to notice the tiny events during the day that are hints fromspirit. Other people may not notice anything unusual in their life, but if youstart noticing these tiny clues, soon you will have a true spiritual life.These Things Will Start to GrowAPPRECIATIONYou’ll begin to appreciate your own uniqueness, your own inner world, your ownplace in creation. Here is how some kids put it:I am really starting to feel like I might be special and could lead a speciallife.If I am by myself just looking around at things, I can see a lot more thanbefore. Even just watching my dog play is different than before. I can see howreally alive he is and how much he enjoys his life.What you said about miracles is coming true for me, in that I don’t see myselfas just an ordinary kid anymore. I really am unique, and that means something tome.WONDERInstead of walking past something that could fill you with awe, whether it’s afull moon, a rose, a baby’s smile, or a look of love, you will begin to have amoment of wonder. Here is how some kids put it:Everybody uses the word “awesome” all the time, so it barely means anythinganymore. I am starting to see “awesome” instead of just saying it.I saw this surf movie just because some of my friends dragged me along. I don’tcare about surfing, but suddenly there were shots of these mighty waves, so hugeand powerful, towering over these tiny surfers. I really did feel awed by them.I began to see that life could be like that, surfing the enormous power of iteverywhere around us.ALERTNESSYou will begin to feel more awake and less dull. Everyday things won’t beroutine anymore. They will start to show you the spark of life that is insideeverything. Here is how some kids put it:I call it the zing. I am not just looking at stuff, but actually feel a zing, atiny thrill, at bright colors and certain music.In commercials they show stupid stuff like eating some kind of candy and gettinga burst of excitement in your mouth. But recently I have felt this burst ofexcitement just because I started looking for it. Not from candy, but fromsomething like the tropical fish in a tank. I look at them closely and keeplooking, and all at once I feel very excited by this incredibly beautiful thingI am seeing.FULLNESSYou will lose that bored, empty feeling that comes about when we take our lifefor granted. Instead, waking up each day will be like waking up to a new world.Each dayis a new world, so this is a great change, a big step into a better andhigher reality. Here is how some kids put it:I have started this thing where I lie in bed when I first wake up. I close myeyes and try to feel the new day. It’s like a special morning feeling. When Ifeel it, the day becomes this new thing and I am full of hope for what mighthappen.I look for one special moment every day. It has to be a moment where somethinghappens that never happened before. When I wasn’t looking, I thought my life wasmostly the same stuff every day. But actually, there is always a special momentonce you open your eyes. You could say that I am on the lookout for change. Idon’t just see the same old things anymore.PRESENCEYou will begin to feel the presence of spirit. It’s like sensing that there’ssomebody behind the scenes who knows you and is looking out for you. It’s likewatching a play and knowing that there is somebody offstage running the show.Here is how some kids put it:I go out to hear the woods breathe. The only woods in my town are in the park,but if I go there and lie down among the trees, the branches are stirred by thebreeze. If I listen really closely, this is like the world breathing. I tellmyself,This is God breathing.I talk to God when I am out walking. I say to him, “Nice clouds,” or, “You did agood sunrise today.” I try to imagine that we are close, that he is listening.And sometimes, you know what? I feel that he is.CONNECTIONYou will begin to connect with the world in a new way. Instead of feeling aloneor like a stranger, you will see patterns that include you. The whole creationis connected, and life is nothing but patterns being born and rising to thesurface before disappearing like bubbles. Being connected is how you actuallyare—you are one thread in the cosmic tapestry. It may be a small thread, but allof life would be different without it. Here is how some kids put it:I read the stories about great men and women, and when I come across somethingthey did that I can relate to, I feel close to them. My heroes are like me buthave gone way beyond me. They lead the way.I often stand on an empty beach and stretch out my arms. Then I turn aroundslowly and say, “This is my home.” Since we all came from the sea, it’s truethat the ocean is my home. Since we all breathe the air, the atmosphere is myhome. The light from the sun is part of my home. As I think these thoughts, Ifeel at home in the whole universe. I belong."},{"pageContent":"2SUCCESS“WHAT’S THE SECRET OFBEING REALLY SUCCESSFUL?”Try to imagine your future. It could go a lot of different ways. What if youwind up getting a very good job, maybe as a doctor or a lawyer, that earns you alot of money? Imagine yourself with your own house, the beginning of a family, acar you are proud of.Is this a picture of success?For most people it is. They see success in material terms, meaning money andstatus and all the things success can buy. But I think that doesn’t really gofar enough. Why not have success both outside and inside?Success is abundance in both the inner and the outer.It’s one thing to be rich in possessions, but another to be rich in love orhonor or friendship. Being spiritual doesn’t mean you have to give up on theouter riches of life. After all, they are just as much a part of creation aslove or beauty. Your soul wants your life to be complete in every way.In this section we’re going to find out how inner and outer abundance can bewon. It’s clear that teens worry about their future. A sixteen-year-old boyasked:Dear Deepak,Where does motivation come from? I have a hard time finding any motivation atall, yet other people don’t seem to. Is something wrong with me?This is a major question, because without motivation a person cannot besuccessful. Everyone has motivation to do certain things. If I ask you to playyour favorite video game, eat your favorite food, or talk to your best friend,you will have instant motivation. If someone offers you a lot of money, thatbecomes a good motivating force also.MOTIVATION ISN’T ITBut motivation doesn’t stick. Tons of people join the gym thinking they aregoing to get into shape, yet after five or six visits they drop out. Youprobably have a friend who bought an electric guitar, only to leave it in thecorner after a few months or maybe even a few weeks.Why does motivation wear out? Because it comes from outside yourself.If you try to motivate yourself from the outside, the day will come when moneydoesn’t work anymore. Buying new stuff stops working also, once you already havemore than you need. Being a famous celebrity is basically empty. It’s not thereal you. Ever. So to really find your motivation, you can’t depend on outsidethings.True motivation comes from within. So does true success.INSPIRATION IS ITInstead of motivation, look for inspiration. Inspiration comes from the sameword asspirit . When you are inspired, the spirit moves you. Have you ever seena sunflower following the sun, turning to follow the sun’s path across the sky?A sunflower is fascinating because it never stands still. From sunrise to sunsetit turns, naturally seeking the light. The same impulse is everywhere in nature.If you put one-celled animals like amoebas in a dish and shine a light on oneside, they will naturally head toward the light also, even though amoebas haveno eyes and no nervous system.That’s what inspiration is: the natural tendency to head for the light.Your soul wants to inspire you.It wants to show you where your inner light shines.Going into the LightQ: I have never seen my inner light. Where is it?A: Some people actually see a light inside themselves—you’d be surprised howmany have seen it at least once. But when you see a picture in your head, that’sa form of inner light. The ability to see images is called imagination, andeveryone is born with it. Sometimes we say, “You’re just imagining things,”which makes it sound like the mind’s images are a fantasy. But haven’t you heardof someone following their dream? That’s also imagination, because a dream isjust another kind of image.HOW TO GO INTO THELIGHTWhen you first wake up and are just getting ready for your day, take a fewmoments to yourself.STEP 1Sit quietly until you feel calm and centered. If you have never centeredyourself, it’s very simple: Just close your eyes and focus your attention whereyour heart is, right in the center of your chest. Feel your body from thiscenter place and let your mind grow easy and quiet.STEP 2Once you are centered, begin to see the day ahead. See yourself as you eatbreakfast, go to school, attend class. Be specific and visualize your dayas youwould like it to be. See yourself asHappyConfidentFeeling joy and laughterMeeting no obstaclesHaving positive interactions everywhere you goSTEP 3If there is any image that makes you feel stressed or anxious when you see it inyour mind’s eye, pause and stay with that image. Does your body feel tight? Didyou stop breathing for a moment? Just relax your body and start to take deep,slow breaths. Do this until the image feels less stressful. See yourself gettingthrough the tough moments very easily and comfortably.STEP 4Once you feel easy in your body, say to yourself, “I am writing the futuretoday. It is my future to see and create. I will go forward today as the trueauthor of my life.”Open your eyes and have a great day.You need to have a dream you can follow.When you have your special dream, you will be going into the light.Special DreamingQ: I have dreams at night, but I don’t have a special dream. How do I get one?A: A special dream doesn’t come when you are asleep, although it can. Sometimeswe know more in our dreams than we think. Some years ago I heard an amazingstory about an island in the South Pacific where everyone dreams together. Thewhole tribe gets up every morning to discuss their dreams, and whatever thegroup has dreamed will happen that day, that dream turns into their reality.Basically they dream the future one day at a time.This made me think that anyone could do the same thing. I began my own specialdreaming, but I don’t do it when I am asleep.In fact, the more awake you are, the stronger your dreams will be. They have abetter chance of coming true.The sidebar “How to Go into the Light” shows how it works.The process of special dreaming starts to work better the more you use it. Atfirst you may find that not every situation comes out exactly the way youwanted. But you will see improvements. Look for them. Believe in them. Here’show one person did it.A GOLFER’S TALEI got really excited about golf a few years ago. I went out for the school team,and the coach said I had some talent. I enjoyed every practice session, yetthere were problems. I got very nervous during competition, and sometimes a badshot made me so frustrated and mad that it would ruin my whole round.Then I learned to see every hole in advance. I would sit quietly and visualizemyself making the perfect tee shot. I could feel how great that would be. I feltthe swing going like liquid through my body as the ball soared in a perfect arcand landed in a perfect spot on the fairway.I would do the same thing for every shot, all the way up to the perfect putt.And it worked. I didn’t always make the perfect swing, but I felt much morerelaxed. The big change is that now I am playing the game, where before the gamewas playing me.That last phrase is really key. You want to feel that you are playing the gameof life, not that it is playing you. With special dreaming you can start to putyourself in control of the game, not by forcing things to happen, but by seeingthe best outcome for your day and then relaxing and letting things unfold theway they will.This principle of creating your own reality is very ancient. Thousands of yearsago in India the great sages would rise before dawn to do their yoga meditation.They lined their souls up with the energy of the new day, and it was believedthat this was enough to bring peace and harmony to everyone in society. I thinkwe need to try that experiment again, so when you do your own special dreaming,congratulate yourself: You are adding to peace and harmony around you every timeyou go into the light.Making a Habit of SuccessQ: Do you think successful people have something in common? A certain way ofdoing things the rest of us don’t know?A: There’s lots of good advice out there about the kind of habits that makesomeone a success. A lot of that advice centers on how to use your time and howto treat employees and the work staff. That’s not really important for teens.You don’t have employees, you aren’t supporting a family, and your day ismanaged for you (so far as time goes) when you are at school.So I sat down and asked myself what I see in the successful people I know, goingmore toward the spiritual side. I wanted to know more about finding innerfulfillment and growth.Here’s the list of habits I came up with.Habits for Success:Dos and Don’ts in Everyday LifeDofollow your inner guide, even if it goes against the group.Don’tbe swayed by outside opinion.Dowhat feels comfortable and right.Don’tstruggle and strain.Dovalue who you are. Enjoy your uniqueness.Don’tcompare yourself with others and put yourself down.Dogive freely of your time and energy. Make a difference to others on theirjourney.Don’tbe selfish and act as if only what you want is important.Dolisten to what others say.Don’tbe self-centered in your opinions.Doshow respect, even if you disagree with someone else.Don’tassume that only you know what’s best.Dotake responsibility for your life.Don’twait for others to do things for you.Dohave a dream and heroes you look up to.Don’tdrift and isolate yourself.Dokeep an open, creative mind, looking for things that are beautiful, novel, andworth exploring.Don’tstick to your old way of doing and seeing things.Dotrust in the future, which is full of infinite possibilities.Don’tfall prey to short-term setbacks.Putting this list into play is easy because you can start one point at a time.Each habit for success is within your reach today. Below is a program you mightwant to follow, although you should feel free to adapt it to your own situation.A Week of Success:Putting Your New Habits to WorkDay 1Today is aboutbeing true to myself. I will look at one situation in my lifetoday where I have been too influenced by peer pressure.ExamplesDefend someone who is unpopular, or speak up for something you believe in, orvoice an unpopular opinion that you know is right. If you catch yourself goingalong with the group just so nobody will criticize you, turn inside to be moretrue to yourself. Know who you are and what your mind is before followinganybody.Day 2Today isBust the Stress Day. I will find one thing today that puts stress andstrain in my life and try to improve it.ExamplesMake peace with your little brother or sister over some annoying habit.Sincerely tell your parents that they are pressuring you too much in a certainarea, like school or homework. At the same time ask them to plan a better waythat gets the job done without making you feel so stressed. Look at yourschedule and try to get the important tasks done early, so that you are notstruggling against a deadline at the last minute. Think about how to use timebetter in general. Successful people find time precious, so they fill it up withthe most important things. Empty time is not a friend.Day 3Today is about myuniqueness. I will look today for all the things that nobodyhas in the world but me. I will catch myself if I start putting myself down. Iwill catch myself when I am tempted to compare myself with somebody I think isbetter than me. I will find my own special talent and work to make it evenbetter.ExamplesTake your mom and dad aside and say that you want to talk about what makes themfeel special. Ask them to say what is special about you, and in return sharewhat you think is special about them. Since you are part of a much biggerpicture, sit down and write about the things that make your family special, yourschool special, your community and nation special. These are also part of yourunique place in time and space.Day 4Today is aboutgiving. I will give of my time and energy today where I know itwill be appreciated.ExamplesWithout being asked, wash the dishes that have piled up in the sink. Or helpyour little brother or sister with homework. Or find someone in class who needshelp and gently ask if you can assist them. Opportunities to give areeverywhere. All you have to do is look for them.Day 5Today is aboutlistening. I will take special care today to let others expressthemselves. I will ask for their opinion first, before giving mine. I will catchmyself being bored just because I am not the center of attention.ExamplesPick two topics to bring up at the dinner table, and make sure that everyone inthe family knows that they will be able to speak. Ask your mom and dad to tellyou more about the work they do. In between classes walk with a favorite teacherand ask why he or she took up teaching as a profession.Day 6Today is aboutrespect. I will make it clear today that others can open up to me.I will seek a situation where I haven’t shown respect and try to correct that.ExamplesAt lunch bring up a topic for discussion and say that you want everyone to arguea position opposite of what they usually defend. Find someone who alwaysdisagrees with you (generally it’s a family member, since they know us the best)and apologize for being so contrary. Afterward ask to hear what they reallythink.Day 7Today is aboutresponsibility. I will be as self-reliant today as possible. Iwill try to pick up the slack where it’s needed. I will not just think,It’s notmy job.ExamplesMake your own breakfast or pack your own lunch without being asked. Makebreakfast and pack a lunch for your little brother or sister. Do a load oflaundry. Vacuum the living room. Make yourself responsible for being where youneed to be on time. When you catch yourself whining that you want somebody elseto do for you, do for yourself. If you want money, find a way to earn ityourself.Day 8Today is aboutidealism. I will take time today to learn more about the life ofmy heroes and role models. If I know them, I will go talk to them. If they areheroes in history or myth, I will read about their lives and try to apply theirideals to my life.ExamplesGo to a minister or preacher and ask if you could spend some time with him (orher) as he does good works. Visit a disabled person and ask her (or him) whereshe gets her courage from. Read biographies of great men and women. Look intoworld mythology to find out what the greatest human adventures have been. Ineach case apply the story or myth to yourself—become idealistic by absorbing abit of the great ideals from the past.Day 9Today is aboutcreativity and opening my mind. I will do one thing today thatbrings a bit more beauty into the world. I will apply myself today to findingthe solution to a problem that faces me.ExamplesSurprise yourself by doing something you’d never dream of doing. If you’re thecaptain of the football team, pick a flower for your English teacher. If youstand around at parties with the same old people, ask somebody to dance. Find adrab little place in your house and make it look nicer: flowers, a bright cloth,a painting, a small piece of art you buy at a secondhand shop. Pick a problemfacing humanity that interests you, such as pollution, overpopulation, AIDS, orpoverty. Put yourself in charge of the world and make a list—a blue-skydreamer’s list—of all the ways you would solve such a massive problem. Be asimaginative as you want, without rules or restrictions.Day 10Today is aboutthe future. I will take time today to think about the futurepossibilities in my life. I will be positive and imaginative, trying to seemyself in many roles doing many things. Wherever I see future problems, I willnot lament them, but try to see the best way they can be solved.ExamplesGo to the library and ask for a book about occupations. Spend time learning howsomeone becomes a doctor or lawyer or small-business owner. Pay attention to thekind of person who really enjoys each kind of work. If you can, actually visitsuch people. Get a feeling for what life might be like five years or a decadefrom now. Apply what you learn to yourself. See yourself in as many roles as youare fascinated by. Let your future be as rich and open as possible in terms ofpersonal fulfillment.SUCCESS PROFILEAs you follow this ten-day program, please don’t stop after the first ten days.Keep going through the cycle, not as if it is a chore or a job, but as a way toreally take charge of your own success.

We are told to belike our parents, which means listening to how they think everything should bedone. Is this fair?A: I sympathize with what you’re saying. Until you are old enough to be on yourown, there will be conflicts between you and your parents about the right way todo things. This conflict isn’t negative as long as you get to win some of thetime and they get to win some of the time. In fact, it’s very useful to testyour ideas about life against theirs. When you finally do go out into the world,you will be yourself, but you will have been partly molded by your parents.Nurturing and freedom go together.I want to tell you a fantastic story of a teenager who became amultimillionaire. He did it all on his own, and yet he also did it for hisfamily.SALEEM AND THE COFFEESaleem was born to an Indian family who had traveled across the Arabian Sea intoAfrica. But they didn’t get there in an ordinary way. His grandfather ran awayfrom home at the age of eleven, along with his twelve-year-old brother. Whenthey landed in Kenya, they walked all by themselves across the country untilthey reached the next country of Uganda. They were farm boys, and the long trekwas in search of land they could farm.In Uganda the older brother fell sick and died. Saleem’s grandfather started afarm on that spot, planting coffee beans. Young though he was, the farmprospered, and soon there were many workers and a rich harvest that was sold tocountries in Europe. By the time Saleem came along, the coffee business was soprosperous that he dreamed as a teenager of becoming a doctor.But Saleem’s father came from the old school of discipline and hard work, andSaleem was sent out into the fields to toil alongside the paid workers. He didas he was told, and soon he got to go to London to sell that year’s crop. Hisfather sent the chief foreman along to conduct the transaction, but when theygot to England, Saleem found that the buyer had too much coffee already. Heoffered £2,000 (about $3,200) for each shipload of coffee. Saleem wasdiscouraged and didn’t know if he should sell his father’s whole crop at such alow price.Then a remarkable coincidence happened. He went down to the hotel lobby to havetea, and he saw a young woman who looked so sad she was almost crying. Saleemtook pity on her and asked what was wrong.“I have the worst boss in the world,” she complained tearfully. “He mistreatseverybody, especially me.”“What does your boss do?” asked Saleem.“He buys coffee,” she said. “And he pretends that there is a surplus when thetruth is that he is very short of supplies and desperately needs to buy moreshiploads. Otherwise he may be ruined.”Saleem couldn’t believe his ears. The very man that had made such a stingy offerwas this girl’s boss. He said nothing to her and went back up to his room. Onthe next phone call to the buyer Saleem told him that he could have the croponly for the highest going price. Her boss sounded very angry, but in the end hegave in. Saleem had saved his father’s business.This is astonishing enough for a sixteen-year-old boy, but the story takes amysterious twist. Saleem was afraid for the future in Africa. He saw that a newregime might seize all his father’s land and ruin him overnight. So he orderedthe foreman to take all the extra money—more than $2 million—and put it in aLondon bank. They went home and told his father that they had received the usualprice for the coffee, which made him happy. Saleem’s father had no idea that insecret his son was investing the extra money in banking.Saleem was so alert and ingenious that he started the first currency exchangeshops in airports, making it easier for tourists to get their money turned backand forth from dollars into local currency. (This was thirty years ago, whenexchanging money often took hours in line and a lot of paperwork.) The day camewhen the boy’s prediction came true. A brutal regime took power in Uganda, andovernight his father’s whole fortune was seized, along with his land. The fatherescaped to London with barely $50 in his pocket.Yet when he landed, there was a limousine waiting at the airport for him. Ittook him to a fancy hotel, where Saleem, still barely out of his teens, met himwith these words:“I knew this day would come. I have a surprise for you, Father. I took the moneywe made on that first shipment of coffee, and now I have turned it into tenmillion dollars. It is all here in the bank waiting for you.”Saleem thought his father would be overjoyed. Instead his father’s face turnedred and he shouted, “You had no right to lie to me! I am ashamed of you!”Saleem was usually gentle, but at that moment he got into a furious argumentwith his father, which ended with his stalking out of the room. The two didn’tspeak for more than three months.“I was crushed,” Saleem recalls today, “because I had earned all that money forhim. But my father was very strict, and to him this was a breach of honor.”After a while Saleem realized that his father knew he’d been rash. Instead ofremaining angry, Saleem offered his father forgiveness, and there was areconciliation. Saleem’s father grew very proud of his son’s amazing success,and the bond between them became even stronger. This is such a wonderful storybecause it’s not just about material success.It’s about the incredible possibilities that the soul opens up.It’s about fatherly love and a son’s love in return.It’s about forgiveness.It’s about realizing that life has to be rich on both the inner and the outerplane to achieve true success.Fear of FailureQ: I am really afraid of failing, so I don’t try many new things. How can Ichange this?A: No one loves failure, but if you are too afraid of it, you can’t really goout into the world and succeed. Also, when you are feeling self-conscious, asmany teenagers do, the bogeyman of failure gets much scarier. It seems as ifbeing young makes each small wound feel so much bigger. Instead of beingtheoretical about failure, I’ll share a telling story someone once told me.NO FUN DANCINGWhen I was thirteen, my parents forced me to go to dance class. I kicked andscreamed, but they insisted. So I found myself one summer night on the gym floorholding a girl I didn’t even know, while a teacher tried to teach us to fox-trotand waltz. I felt very clumsy and stupid.The teacher must have noticed, because he came over and pulled me and my partnerto the front of the class. What a horrible moment! I felt my cheeks grow red; myheart pounded. The teacher made us repeat the same steps over and over, but themore I tried, the clumsier I got. Of course I stepped on the girl’s feet, andthat wasn’t great either.My torture ended when the teacher gave up. He shot me a sad smile and said,“Well, I’m sure you’ll get better soon.” After that nothing could make me goback, and I have avoided social dancing like the plague ever since.In this tale we find most of the ingredients that make failure so frightening:Feeling that you will fail in advanceHaving your worst beliefs come trueBeing seen by othersSuffering humiliationRunning away and never trying againIf you want to overcome your fear of failure, the best way is to tackle each ofthese ingredients one at a time. Failure is one of those problems that is bestsolved by breaking it down, instead of trying to charge at it all at once.FAILING IN ADVANCEEveryone has a little voice inside that crops up at the worst possible moment towhisper, “You’re no good. You’ll never do it right. You’re bound to fail.” Eventhe most successful people suffer from this little demon inside. Some greatactors and singers report that they are almost paralyzed with stage frightbefore the performance. This happens each and every time, yet they still manageto go on and do wonderful work. So can you.Some people just tough it out. They believe in the adage “Feel the fear and doit anyway.” Maybe your dad thinks you should be that way too, or some coach atschool. I am not much of a believer in this approach. If a little kid getsscared in the deep end of the pool and has to be pulled out, you don’t want toput him in the deep end again. You start in the shallow end and go easily, onestep at a time. That’s what we will do here also.SOME HELPFUL TIPSHere are some tips on making that little voice of failure go away:Take deep breaths.Do this steadily and easily for five minutes with your eyesclosed.Visualize a pleasant scene,such as seeing yourself on the beach with palm treesswaying overhead. Feel how wonderful it is to just lie there without a care inthe world.Relax your body—don’t pace restlessly.Be quiet—don’t chatter about how nervous you are or hang around people who actnervous and restless. If you have to go off by yourself to calm down, do it.Don’t even hesitate.Stretch your muscles.Most mental tension actually starts in the body and can bereleased there. A few minutes of simple bending and stretching are all that isneeded. Don’t exercise to the point of exhaustion, which would becounterproductive to meeting the challenge of what you really want to succeedat.You can do these things any time you feel the jitters, whether it’s before amusic performance or a test at school, or before a job interview. They willhelp.However, fear of failure can go deeper. You can have more-troubling thoughts,such asI’ll never be any good at this.Everyone else knows I suck.If I fail in front of my friends, I’ll just die.What does it matter anyway? It’s stupid to win.Nobody thinks I can succeed, so why should I?If you have such thoughts, I again want to reassure you that you are not alone.The mind is a funny thing. It uses fear in order to help you. I know that’s apeculiar idea, but think about early humans walking the jungle with nothing morethan a spear and some rocks. In that primitive state failure to obey your fearcould mean death. Everyone had to be alert to danger, which was very real andvery physical.Part of your brain—sometimes called the old brain or the reptilian brain becauseit developed so long ago in our evolution—still thinks that way. It doesn’t knowthe difference between a small humiliation at dance class and being attacked bya saber-toothed tiger. In both cases powerful hormones are released to providesome “helpful” fear so that you can save your life. In a very real way when youthink,I’m just going to die if that girl turns me down, part of your brain isbeing serious.DEALING WITH FEARFortunately, the old brain isn’t the whole story. You have to live with it, butyou don’t have to let it rule your life. Not by any means. When you are feelingreally afraid of failure, do the following three things: * 1. Get a reality check:Don’t just trust your own worst fears. Go talk to someone who cares about you and ask, “How am I doing?” Discuss what you are afraid of. Get a genuine appraisal of how good you really are. Let them reassure you. Try to see yourself through the eyes of someone you really trust. * 2. Restore balance:Fear can throw you off balance and make you see the world as much scarier than it really is. Realize this: You are young. The weight of the world is not on your shoulders. The future is not your responsibility. You are here to grow naturally, and that doesn’t include being scared. Do something you really enjoy when the pressure gets to be too much. Allow time for laughter. Schedule time for things you know you are good at. * 3. Seek improvement:It’s amazing how many people think they are bad at something, when in fact they never learned it properly. You aren’t expected to be perfect, or even pretty good, until you put in the time to train. This goes for sports, music, drama, subjects at school, and relationships. Every part of life is a challenge, and we help one another through these challenges by learning, teaching, and sharing. Don’t put pressure on yourself beyond your ability. Seek someone who can help you improve. This is a very powerful way to gain confidence, and confidence is the sworn enemy of failure.If you want to see how things are going, here’s a quiz called “A Recipe forFailure.” This is the kind of quiz where it’s good to get thelowest scorepossible.A RECIPE FOR FAILURE: HOW MANY INGREDIENTS ARE IN YOUR CUPBOARD?Directions:First, think of a challenge you are afraid to face.

Things are better than youthink. You should start today to develop more habits for success.How to Be ExceptionalQ: I would like to have a really exceptional life. Is there one secret to doingthat?A: An exceptional life is one that reaches for the highest possibilities. I dothink there is a secret to this. The secret can be named in one word:Vision.Many people don’t know this secret. They don’t realize that spirit helps usreach our visions, but first the vision has to exist. Give someone a vision ofhappiness, a vision of a better future, a vision of a loving family, or a visionof the ideal life, and suddenly there are invisible forces that will come tohelp make that vision a reality.TELL ME YOUR VISIONThis also goes back to motivation. When someone asks, “How can I get motivated?”I immediately say, “First tell me your vision.” If they don’t have one, rightaway we both know why they aren’t feeling motivated. I’m going to simplifythings, but here are sketches of two people, one who has a vision and one whodoesn’t.Thevisionary lives with a goal and a purpose. If you ask, “What is your lifeabout?” such a person has an answer. Every day brings him (or her) closer to hisvision. He can see the future before him. Images come to mind; he feels hisvision getting more and more real. There are discouraging days when he has totake a step backward, or maybe more than one step, but soon his vision isignited again, and like a fire in the heart, it drives him forward.Examples would be great artists like Pablo Picasso and Michelangelo, greatpolitical leaders like Mahatma Gandhi and Abraham Lincoln, great souls likeMother Teresa and Nelson Mandela.Thenonvisionary is adrift. Such a person follows the crowd. She (or he) likeswhat most people like, she does what most people do. She is happy when things goher way, but if they don’t, she feels really miserable. The future seemsuncertain or perhaps worse—it could be empty. A nonvisionary has to go with thecrowd because if she struck out on her own, she would be like a ship lost atsea. It’s much easier to live a safe life with small expectations.I don’t have to name examples because society contains millions ofnonvisionaries. But you don’t have to be famous to have a vision. Everyoneshould have one. All it takes is a desire to have spirit be on your side. Spiritis the home of visions, because at the level of the soul anything is possible.FOUR KEY QUESTIONSFor someone like you, a person young enough to make almost any choice in life,this is a great time to choose your own vision. You don’t have to accept anyoneelse’s. You can model your future—or at least the next few years—according toyour own viewpoint.To have your own vision means asking four questions:What kind of person do I want to be?What kind of work is best for me?What kind of life do I see myself leading?What is my deepest desire and highest hope?Every exceptional life came about by asking these questions. There’s no suchthing as becoming exceptional by accident, or by sitting back and letting itcome to you. Recently I read a story about a fifteen-year-old girl in Denver whodid something exceptional. She started a political movement all on her own. Themovement centered on one issue: cruelty to animals. This girl began to feel thatit was cruel for circuses to travel around with animals in cages. The more shethought about it, the more she felt that it was unnatural for animals to beconfined behind bars and let out only to do tricks for people.She could have forgotten the whole idea and done nothing. She could have printedup a few leaflets and passed them out at the circus the next time it came totown. Instead she did something exceptional. She managed to collect enoughsignatures to get the issue on the ballot so that Denver voters could decide forthemselves. It’s thought that she is the youngest person ever to have put anissue on a ballot, but now the voters will be able to choose whether the circuscan come to Denver or not.MAKING IT PERSONALYou can see how this girl was acting on a vision, and although I haven’t talkedto her personally, I can imagine how she would answer our four questions:What kind of person do I want to be?A person who cares.What kind of work is best for me?Political activism within my community.What kind of life do I see myself leading?The life of a leader or activist.What is my deepest desire and highest hope?To see a world without cruelty to any living creature.If you can answer the same four questions yourself, you can find your own visionand put it into action. (I don’t necessarily mean political or community action,but the action that feels right for you.) None of these are trick questions, butthey are really hard to answer anyway. What makes them hard is that teens (andmany adults) only want to be what looks good in someone else’s eyes.BE YOURSELFPressure from your peers and family makes it hard to have your own vision andnot just a copy of somebody else’s. You know, in all the questions I receivedfor this book, not a single teenager asked me how to find their own vision. So Iknow there’s a lot of work to do in this area. I did get a lot of questions thatwanted to know about being rich or famous or a celebrity—which tells me thatyoung people are too often addicted to the empty, shiny promises of MadisonAvenue. Yet if you live according to your own vision, you will have the kind offulfillment that most celebrities can only dream about. You will most probablywind up happier than the rich, believe it or not.So how are you going to answer those four questions?A good idea would be to ask your soul to answer for you. If your soul could dothat—and remember, your soul is a part of you, not a strange alien living inouter space or on a cloud—its answers would be something like this:What kind of person do I want to be?A person of peace and love who experiences joy.What kind of work is best for me?The kind that satisfies me deeply.What kind of life do I see myself leading?A life of freedom, where every day is a new world.What is my deepest desire and highest hope?To find out the truth about myself.Now we’re getting close to a real vision. It isn’t yet your vision. It doesn’thave your name on it, your own personal touch. We’re going to add the personaltouch in the next chapter, which is about finding the good life. What’s the goodlife going to be for you? Well, I haven’t met you, but there’s one thing thathas to be present for any life to be good. Love and health are contained in it.So are satisfaction and a spiritual fire in the heart. What is this one thing weall must have?I simply call it well-being."},{"pageContent":"3WELL-BEING“HOW DO I FIND TRUE HAPPINESS?”I’m sure you want a good life. Everyone does. But not everyone winds up having agood life. What’s the secret? Teenagers worry about this a lot, often more thantheir parents guess. Here are two letters from opposite sides, but somehow theymeet in the middle. The first is from a sixteen-year-old girl.Dear Deepak,When am I going to be happy? I feel so blah most of the time. Is this how I’msupposed to feel when I am so young?The second came from an eighteen-year-old boy.Dear Deepak,I am going to graduate this year, and I guess this sounds crazy, but what ifhigh school turns out to be the best time of my life? How can I tell ifeverything is downhill from here?The first person is worried that she will never be happy because she isn’t happynow. The second person is happy now but is worried that it won’t last. There’san old saying that happiness is fleeting. I don’t think that has to be, andneither does your soul.Well-being is a permanent part of you.This is where the two questions meet in the middle. Both teens want to know howto make happiness last. And my answer to both is that happiness lasts only if itcomes from inside you, and the deeper the well of happiness, the more intense itwill be all your life.FINDING THE OPPORTUNITYI don’t want to shock anyone who feels blah or depressed or miserable, butreally you have an opportunity in disguise here. You have an incentive to makeyour own happiness, because you have experienced how sorrowful it is to dowithout. And being a young person, you are just the right age to learn how tocreate well-being for yourself. Many adults are stuck in ruts that have beenworn down for many years. They know more than you do about life, but they haveless ability to create something new. So congratulate yourself, even if youdon’t feel wonderful today.I am calling this chapterWell-Being instead ofHappiness because well-beingincludes more things. Happiness can be just a mood that will change when thingsgo wrong. Well-being is stronger and more permanent. When you have it, you feelcomfortable in your body. You appreciate nature and the beauty around you. Youfeel love. You value other people. You have a sense of inner security that ishard to shake. Put these all together and I think the thing that everyonewants—a good life—is very reachable.First, however, let’s look at your sense of well-being right now.A HAPPINESS QUIZDirections:Read each sentence and respond by checkingYes orNo. Give yourself 1 point foreveryYes answer.box [Images/box.jpg] Yes box [Images/box.jpg] No I like my body. box[Images/box.jpg] Yes box [Images/box.jpg] No I get enough sleep and exercise.box [Images/box.jpg] Yes box [Images/box.jpg] No I have good, happy thoughtsabout myself. box [Images/box.jpg] Yes box [Images/box.jpg] No I rarely getdepressed or down. box [Images/box.jpg] Yes box [Images/box.jpg] No I find itpretty easy to stay out of trouble. box [Images/box.jpg] Yes box[Images/box.jpg] No I don’t drink or take drugs. box [Images/box.jpg] Yes box[Images/box.jpg] No I have true friends who stand by me. box [Images/box.jpg] Yes box [Images/box.jpg] No I can share pretty much anything with my friends.box [Images/box.jpg] Yes box [Images/box.jpg] No I don’t fall into being hardon myself. box [Images/box.jpg] Yes box [Images/box.jpg] No Others treat melike one of the good guys, which I am. box [Images/box.jpg] Yes box[Images/box.jpg] No I have a spiritual life that comforts me and helps me grow.box [Images/box.jpg] Yes box [Images/box.jpg] No I believe in a personal God.box [Images/box.jpg] Yes box [Images/box.jpg] No I spend some time every weekdoing good for others. box [Images/box.jpg] Yes box [Images/box.jpg] No Itmakes me feel good to give. box [Images/box.jpg] Yes box [Images/box.jpg] No Iam good about my temper.

It’s much morecomplicated when you’re not. But the good news is this:Well-being is the realyou. Your soul contains a deep reservoir of well-being that you can tap into.When you find the real you, you will be secure, at peace, and joyful in yourheart. This is true at any age, old or young. It is the spiritual promise wewere all born to fulfill.Why haven’t you found the real you already?Because your life has gotten too complicated. Because it’s easier to coastthrough, even when you don’t feel so great. Because no one gave you any helpfulinformation about making your own happiness. For all these reasons and more,teens often wind up feeling miserable without seeing a way out.To be honest, these can be the toughest years of life emotionally. But takeheart: These are also years of great promise and incredible potential.Whether you feel great at this moment or not, there is a way to createwell-being for yourself. First I will outline the program, then we will takeeach point one at a time.Ten Keys to Well-Being:Daily Promises to Keep 1. I will make sure my body is healthy. 2. I will make sure my mind is healthy. 3. I will do what I know is right. 4. I will be around people who really care for me. 5. I won’t judge against myself or put myself down. 6. I will make friends with spirit. 7. I will make a contribution. 8. I will avoid violence in all its disguises. 9. I will cherish nature. 10. I will never stop growing.If you can keep these promises to yourself, you will be doing the maximum tocreate well-being in your life. This list is a life plan that works on alllevels, starting with your body but also including mind, relationships,self-image, and emotions.Want to know the secret of happiness?The secret of happiness is to include all these levels. Each one counts.A BALANCED LIFENow you know the secret, so you can stop struggling to make yourself happier orpretending to be happy when you’re really not. All you have to do is include allof yourself in a balanced approach to life. It’s the most natural way and theone that works the best.You’d be amazed how many people neglect one or more of these levels. Thechampion athlete has a body to die for, but he may forget how to relate toothers or how to have a strong self-image when he loses a game. The genius inmath class may forget that he has a body or that there is a beautiful world ofnature to explore. The girl with the totally charming personality may turn herback on giving happiness to others rather than just taking all the time. Theseimbalances are not good for lasting well-being.I want each point in the program to sink in personally, so each one will includethree personal profiles. Mark the profile thatbest applies to you right now. Inthis way you will have a good starting point for seeing how much progress youmake as you continue on your spiritual journey.Profile #1 is a person with astrong sense of well-being.Profile #2 is a person with anaverage sense of well-being.Profile #3 is a person with afair to poor sense of well-being.I don’t imagine you will see yourself exactly in any single profile—you don’thave to—but they outline some typical beliefs that I’ve encountered over theyears among many young people.The First Key to Happiness:A Healthy BodyWhich profile is closest to you?Profile #1I like my body. I exercise more than most kids because it feels good. I don’tobsess over my physical looks. I realize that my body is my friend and supportsystem. I respect that and don’t put things into my body that aren’t good forit.Profile #2My body is just there. I don’t notice it unless I get sick or there’s asituation that makes me feel self-conscious. Exercise isn’t my thing—I prefer tohang out in my room doing other stuff. I’m pretty hooked on junk food. I may ormay not have used drugs and alcohol.Profile #3I feel bad saying this, but sometimes I just hate my body. Why isn’t it as goodas other people’s? I worry about how others see me. I know they think I am notgood enough physically. Body issues are major with me, and yet as much as I wanta better body, I do abuse it with the wrong food or too much food. My impulsecontrol is awful. Help!A MEDICAL DISCOVERYThe first key to happiness is a healthy body. Your body makes a big differencein your sense of well-being. One of the big medical discoveries since you wereborn is the discovery that our bodies help make us happy or unhappy. Certainbrain chemicals, such as serotonin, actually make your mood better. If you canincrease these natural mood enhancers, things that once got you down won’t be asstrong. You may have heard about the runner’s high, a natural sense of euphoriathat many people feel when they exercise. That’s a good example of how a purelyphysical act can increase the chemicals (called endorphins) that help raise yourmood.So being into your body isn’t just about looking good. In fact, looking good—inthe sense of striving for the perfect body—doesn’t necessarily trigger the rightchemicals. You can be the most beautiful supermodel and yet feel so insecurethat your body will produce exactly the opposite chemicals, the ones that raiseyour inner stress level. You can be a champion football player and wind up withso many injuries that your life becomes wracked with pain for years afterward.STRESS DOESN’T HELPIt’s not good to force your body into doing what you or somebody else wants. Alot of people forget this. A fifteen-year-old boy asked:Dear Deepak,I come from an athletic family, and when I was younger, my father pushed me intoheavy-duty physical activity. I don’t really like to train hard, but I’m afraidI will be a wuss if I don’t. What can I tell my father that will make himlighten up?Tell him that doctors have proved over and over that stress is much worse for aperson than exercise is good. When you enjoy exercising, your whole body courseswith chemicals that alleviate stress, such as serotonin and dopamine, whereaswhen you hate to exercise, your body is flooded with chemicals that increasestress, such as cortisone and even adrenaline. (Contrary to the popular myth ofthe adrenaline high, this hormone breaks down tissues and leads to physical andmental exhaustion if too much is released into the body or if it is released toooften.) Nor is it all-important to go in for heavy workouts. It’s the rightactivity, not pushing it to the limit, that gives a sense of well-being. What’sthe right activity?GOOD ACTIVITY FOR THE BODY * A little light exercise that gets you off the couch and away from the computer * Exercise that makes you feel better after you’ve finished than you felt before you began * Any physical activity that relaxes your mind * An activity that is in balance with the rest of your lifeThese points are easy to apply once you put your mind to it. One thing that fewpeople know is that it is more important to do any kind of exercise than to keeptotally fit. The biggest health risks, such as heart disease and diabetes, facethose who do absolutely nothing but sit at home or work all day in an office.Once you get out for a brisk walk four times a week, you have made the biggeststep toward avoiding those risks. Going further and becoming totally fit is alsogood, but that is more or less icing on the cake.NO PAIN, NO GAIN?I am not a great fan of the “No pain, no gain” school of sports. It works forsomeone who is highly competitive and motivated to win at all costs. Thatdoesn’t include 90 percent of teens, which may explain why the number of teenswho exercise has fallen off steadily since the early 1960s. Today only about 6percent of the adult population engages in any regular exercise—the most popularbeing walking.So start early, before you get so adjusted to sitting around all day that youronly exercise is going to the refrigerator to see if there’s still some leftoverpizza inside. I know that for many kids PE class was an early torture that gaveexercise a bad name. If that’s true for you, then don’t force yourself to go outfor a team sport or any activity that would open you up to mean remarks fromother kids. You can bike on your own or with a friend. You can talk for an hourwith your buddy while walking, instead of lying on your bed with a phone to yourear.“I HATE MY BODY”Let’s say that the situation isn’t good at all, that you really hate your body.This question from a fifteen-year-old girl comes from such a place:Dear Deepak,Why are kids so mean to someone just because they are fat?My heart goes out to her because kids can be very cruel. Children today aregetting to be overweight at an earlier and earlier age. She has probably enduredsome hard teasing for quite a long time (which would no doubt make her eat evenmore in order to numb the pain). Young people in general have become terriblyself-conscious about body image.Here’s the advice a teen with a weight problem will usually get:“You’re beautiful in other ways.”“You’re such a great person. Forget the weight.”“You are so fortunate in other areas.”“Don’t think about yourself so much.”“Your problem is that you don’t have enough discipline.”“I don’t see you as fat.”“Have another bowl of ice cream. You’ll feel better.”None of this is really helpful when kids are being so mean to you that youbarely want to show your face in public. Of course there’s the sensible advice,which is to go on a diet and stop eating so much. But that can be very hard todo when you’re stuck in bad habits, or when your whole family uses food to feelgood, or when other things make you feel so sad that eating is about the onlything that makes you forget. Overeating is an emotional problem most of thetime, not a purely physical one. And even if it starts out being a physicalproblem, emotional issues take over once the teasing and the bad self-imagestart to pile up.In some societies beauty is measured by how well fed a girl looks, and it is thelittle skinny girls who don’t fit in. But skinny or fat, you’re not going to beperfect. You’re not always going to fit in. You’ll have to live with people whodon’t care how you feel.BETTER ADVICEI would like to offer another kind of advice:Make a good life for yourselfanyway.If you work on all ten points of the well-being program, one day you are goingto feel so good about yourself that one of two things will happen: (1) You willrealize that being overweight is not the tragedy you think it is now; (2) Youwill feel so good about yourself that the emotional reasons for overeating willdisappear. Until one of these two things happens, you will find it verydifficult to get rid of the extra weight. It is serving you. As much as you hatethe mean kids, you need food more.I know this sounds funny. Most overweight kids are really miserable inside abouthow they look. But here’s another secret that not enough of us realize:Paindoesn’t motivate people to change. Whether it is the fat kid who is mercilesslyteased, the chain-smoker who can barely breathe and faces all kinds of diseases,or the addict who has caused immense grief to everyone around him or her, painisn’t enough. All these bad habits are terrible for the body. They are terriblefor achieving well-being. Yet until something better comes along, these habitsare often the only way a person knows to feel good.MIND-BODY CONNECTIONSYou see, the body is connected to the mind. If you have a rock in your shoe, youcan just say, “Ouch,” and pull it out. It’s a no-brainer. But when the mindenters in, there is psychological pain to deal with. Then things get morecomplicated than having a rock in your shoe. I meet lots of overweight adultswho eat only skimpy salads in public and yet sneak extra pieces of chocolatecake when they are in private. Something psychological makes them do that. It’sa war between the “good me” and the “bad me.” We all take part in that war. Theonly way to win it is to make such a good life for yourself that the “good me”is empowered. When it feels strong enough, you will be able to look the “bad me”in the face and start to work on its problems.That’s the deep reason for asking you to be good to your body. You need to getit on the side of the “good me,” because you deserve it. Your soul already knowsthat all of you is good, and as you grow, you will arrive at the samerealization.DRINKING AND DRUGSNow for the darker side of how teens use their bodies. A junior in high schoolasked:Dear Deepak,My parents are totally opposed to me drinking or using any kind of recreationaldrug. That’s fine, but they don’t realize how common alcohol and drugs are atschool. Isn’t it better for me to tell them that I use occasionally than tosneak around behind their backs?It wouldn’t be honest for me to say that it’s completely wrong to use alcoholand drugs. Adults have been telling their kids to avoid both for decades, andyet at a time when almost every school has antidrug classes, the use of drugs isat or near an all-time high. Peer pressure makes kids try drugs and alcohol.Curiosity and the lure of a guilty pleasure reinforce the peer pressure.So the real question isn’t what you tell your parents—after all, you alreadyknow that they are dead set against your using. The real question is what youtell yourself. Morality can only go so far. At a certain point each of us isresponsible for our own actions. If a teen is younger, from twelve to fifteen, Iwould agree with parents who go to almost any length to keep their child cleanand sober. I say this not out of alarm that one drink will ruin someone’s life,but out of knowing that it’s unfair to ask a young teen to make adult decisionswhen something as volatile as drugs or alcohol is concerned.From age sixteen on up I think you are old enough to know yourself a bit better.One drink or one pill will tell you if you are going to use sensibly or not. Anexperiment is useful in telling you more about yourself. Once the curiositypasses, the vast majority of kids will walk away of their own accord.SOCIAL DRINKING?However, the big exception is social drinking. Teens now use alcohol far morethan previous generations. Alcohol is wrongly considered the “harmless” drug,when in fact it is associated with huge numbers of highway deaths, crime,domestic violence, and accidents. Ask yourself the most basic question: Whydrink at all? The answer is that it makes you feel good. Alcohol takes awayinhibitions, at least in small doses. But it is also a toxic substance, anobvious fact, given that a single overdose can kill you.Since antialcohol campaigns have done little to discourage teendrinking—especially binge drinking—I can offer one new idea. If drinking makesyou feel free, try to become that free without alcohol. Your soul can make youthat free. Alcohol makes you feel good because its molecules fit into certainreceptors on the outside of brain cells. Those same receptors can be filled withmolecules that you produce yourself. Look at the joy on the face of someone whohas just won the lottery or fallen in love, and you are seeing the result ofreceptor sites being filled spontaneously, without the use of an outside drug.Which brings us to a general rule about substance abuse:If you are addicted toone kind of pleasure, the best way to end your addiction is to find a greaterpleasure.HOW ADDICTIONS WORKContrary to popular opinion, it’s not the drug that makes the addict. A hundredpeople can take a drink and walk away without feeling addicted, compared withthose five or six who cannot. For them the drink leads to addiction for otherreasons:Alcohol makes them feel better than they can on their own.It gives them a way to forget their troubles.It gives them a way to forget themselves.It leads to a temporary sense of power and freedom.It provides false self-esteem.If you look at this list, everything on it is good. It’s good to have pleasure,self-esteem, a sense of personal power and freedom. These are, in fact, some ofthe highest personal goals in life. Most people can tell the difference betweenthe real thing, however, and the kind induced by drugs and alcohol. Addictscan’t. They want to access these good things but fail without the use of anoutside substance. In that sense addiction is a spiritual problem. The bestantidote, I believe, is to pursue spirit and try to fill the empty spaces insideyourself. I am not all that concerned about recreational drugs and alcohol; I ammore concerned about people who feel empty and soulless. If you can rid yourselfof those feelings, then substance abuse disappears automatically.The Second Key to Happiness:A Healthy MindWhich profile is closest to you?Profile #1I like what goes on in my mind. I have good thoughts about myself and otherpeople. My imagination comes up with things that delight me. I feel mentallyfresh, and I like a good challenge to my intellect. I know there will always besomeone smarter than me, but I will make the best use of the intelligence I wasgiven.Profile #2My mind’s okay, but it lets me down sometimes. I can remember being embarrassedin school because I said something dumb in class. I’d rather use my mind to playa video game or figure out sports statistics than to study. Being averagementally is okay, I guess, but I admit that I keep away from mental challengesmost of the time.Profile #3I don’t want to think about my mind. I’m not into that game. I mostly shut up inclass. I have bad memories of school, starting pretty early. Nobody hasencouraged me to think or use my imagination. Secretly I wonder if maybe I am asdumb as others might suppose.SMART OR DUMB?Smartanddumb are loaded words, and I try not to use them. Einstein himself wasconsidered dumb in his early youth. Now, as then, people make snap judgments.Many a child with bad eyesight or poor hearing has wound up in remedial classesbecause some adult didn’t take the time to see that the problem wasn’t lack ofintellect, but a disability. And the mind isn’t the same from person to person.Each of us has strong points and weak points in how we use our mind. The averageAmerican adult can read and reason fairly well, yet not be able to draw beyondthe level of a grade-schooler. (How different in Switzerland, where everyone,not just the artistic kids, learns to draw.) In many schools the shop classesare for the “dumb” kids, and yet in a country like New Zealand the smart kidsare in there learning how to do household repairs and work with their hands.When you are old enough to own your own home, you may mourn the day you didn’tlearn how to fix an overflowing toilet or install a tile floor. The so-calleddumb kids get their revenge when they grow up and turn into skilledcraftspeople.The real question is whether your mind adds to the good life. All the very bestthings come through the mind: Art and science. Joy and love. Dreams andimagination. But the mind can get discouraged, and when that happens, it stopscontributing to the good life. I find that with teens this is the biggestproblem, that they have discouraged minds and don’t realize it.Here are some symptoms of a discouraged mind.A Discouraged Mind:Do You Fit Any of These Symptoms?Giving up on lessons in classBlowing off class, ignoring deadlines for homeworkSitting back in class and not participatingActing up in class, turning into a clown or a rebel to attract attentionNo longer reading for pleasureNot using your imaginationKeeping your thoughts to yourselfRefusing to debate your beliefs and pet ideasBecoming narrow and prejudiced in your thinkingThe early things on this list are the most obvious. Kids who have given up onschool aren’t hard to spot. But did you think that the class clown might have adiscouraged mind? Or the narrow-minded bigot who says nasty things to people ofcolor? When it’s healthy, the mind isn’t narrow, and there’s no need to clownaround or put people down when what you really want is to be proud of your mind.MAKING IT BETTERThe first step in getting a healthy mind is to heal any signs of discouragement.Do it early, before you go too far and there’s not enough time to catch up withyour dreams for yourself. If you allow your mind to remain discouraged, you willsettle for second best on your dreams or give up altogether. Your mind will gethealthier the more you use it in the right way. Here’s a list for that, too.A Healthy Mind:Using Your Mind in the Right WayRead good things instead of junk.Use your imagination.Think for yourself, not the way you’ve been told to think.Accept new challenges.Don’t give up so easily. Go back and think again.Be around people smarter than you. Enjoy and appreciate them, don’t worry aboutcompeting.Find a mental hobby (other than video games).Learn a bit of math and science.Get into good, hard discussions.Think about the big picture, such as world peace and AIDS.Use your mind to help others.What’s important about this list is that everything on it adds to the good life.Your mind is the most important partner in your well-being. It’s not about IQ.Share your thoughts with people who care and who listen. The adults I know whohave healthy minds aren’t always the big brains—they are people who follow thethings on this list. You can have a huge intellect, forming pet theories ofimmense complication, and yet hide yourself away from the world and have veryunhealthy mental habits. I also know bright kids who feel very sad and bitterthat nobody in their family will talk with them or share ideas. Either the otherfamily members are intimidated—you’d be amazed how many fathers and mothers areintimidated by a bright youngster—or just don’t care.But you have to care. The mind is a muscle like any other, and if you neglectit, it will start to wither away. Of course, in a way this whole book is abouthaving a healthy mind, because spiritual experiences must come through thenervous system also. There’s no such thing as a mindless awakening. It takesalertness and willingness and desire, all of which come through your mind. Yourmind can be one of the glories of your life.Look at the profiles in the next section. They describe the kinds of mentalattitudes kids often take. You won’t fit any of them perfectly, but they mighttell you something about yourself.The Third Key to Happiness:Doing the Right ThingWhich profile is closest to you?Profile #1I definitely see myself as one of the good guys. I have stood up for someone introuble. I’ve walked away when other kids tried to get me to do something I knewwas wrong. I don’t judge others. Being good is a private thing, and I know whatmy values are. I’m open-minded about any lifestyle that doesn’t hurt anybody. Idevote some time every month to helping those in need.Profile #2Sure, I’m good, but I like to do what I want too. If I found a wallet on thestreet, I’d be tempted to keep at least some of the money inside. I’ve beenknown to sneak around if I really want something badly, and I’m not thatthrilled with authority. Mostly I have a good conscience, though, as long as Idon’t look at myself too hard.Profile #3Hey, it’s good to be bad. I don’t think others have a right to tell me how tobehave. I’m my own man (or woman). I know what it’s like to get into trouble,but I get by. I cut corners when I have to, and I have good enough luck andsmarts not to get caught. Sometimes I have a bad conscience, and I know thatother kids don’t have a good opinion of me, but so what? I’m past the point ofno return, or very close to it.WHY DO WE DO THE WRONG THING?I just talked about the discouraged mind. When someone goes even further pastdiscouragement, something new happens. They stop doing what they know to beright. Most criminals, as marked by society, know right from wrong. But theylong ago lost the ability to figure out how to do what they know is right. Theyfeel that the “bad me” took over somewhere along the line. They might even saythat “it,” the force of evil, is in control. But these extreme cases began withsomething simple: not acting on good impulses and giving in to bad ones.To have a sense of well-being, you need to act on your good impulses. The badimpulses aren’t going to vanish. They want to have their say; they are going tocompete for your attention. So the issue isn’t about being an angel or sogoody-goody that you start believing in your own sainthood. The issue is aboutbeing alert enough that you can tell good from bad when it counts.The Moment of Decision:When Does Good and Bad Really Count?When your actions might injure you or anotherWhen you might humiliate anotherWhen you know you are going to feel guilty tomorrowWhen you might hurt an important relationshipWhen you might open the way for even more bad thingsWhen you might violate someone else’s rightWhen you might give away your dignityWhen you might lower yourself in your own eyesSome parents would be shocked by this list because it doesn’t begin with “Whenyou break the law” or “When you disobey your parents.” It’s not that I don’tthink those things are important. They are. But laws and parental rules existoutside yourself. Desire exists inside yourself. When it comes to a contest, theexternal rule is almost always going to lose out. So many teens act on desiresfor alcohol or sex or cutting school or breaking the law because they want toknow how it feels. Rules feel cold. That’s just the nature of rules. Desirefeels warm, or maybe even burning.BETTER CHOICESSo at the moment of decision you need to go to other things that are also insideyou. If you look at the list again, you will see that each point centers onsomething desirable about yourself:Wanting to be a good personKeeping your dignity and self-esteemNot wanting to hurt anybody elseNot wanting to feel guilty after it’s too late to change thingsWanting to feel safe and in controlThere is a lot of emotion attached to bad or reckless desires, but there’semotion attached to these good things also. Only you can find the balance.That’s the key to living with both the “good me” and the “bad me.” Crossing theline isn’t forbidden, but you know when it’s okay. Letting loose can be verygood for you. Losing your inhibitions will show you a side of yourself you mightnot ever meet otherwise. No one is asking you to be the preacher’s daughter orson (they are often the first to run into temptation that’s too sweet torefuse). The point is that doing the right thing is part of the good life. Itbuilds a better self than if you do the wrong thing. It builds a better selfthan if you shrug your shoulders and decide not to think about good and bad.Good and bad will always be with us, and navigating a true course between themwill always be one of life’s greatest rewards.The Fourth Key to Happiness:Someone Who CaresWhich profile is closest to you?Profile #1My family loves me, and at least one family member is like my best friend. I amnot afraid to say how I really feel. They respect me and listen to what I haveto say. I know I will always have people in my life who care for me as a person.Profile #2I have a good family, but we don’t spend a lot of time together. Everyone is offdoing their own thing. I’m careful what I say sometimes—it’s not always thatgood if I say what I really think. I wish I had someone I could really confidein, but at least I have pretty good friends, and I expect to be friends with afew of them for a long time.Profile #3My family doesn’t understand me very well. There are rules and behavior at myhouse that I don’t agree with. But it’s not like my opinion counts, so I toe theline at home and save what I really want to do for my own time and my ownfriends. We have a good time together, but to tell you the truth, I don’t shareany deep stuff with the friends I hang out with.BELONGINGOne important part of being happy is to feel that you belong. Belonging isn’tjust about being part of a clique or a gang or even a posse of friends who hangout together. It’s about bonding with someone so closely that you can sayanything you feel like saying. Being young is an experimental time. You have totry on different ways of talking about yourself, different moods and ideas thatjust come to you. In a few years these attitudes will probably change a greatdeal, but you won’t know how they feel right now unless you try them out.I can remember walking down the street in India trying on all kinds of attitudeswith my close buddies. We’d pretend to be outlaws or movie stars. We’d act toughone minute, then turn into excited children the next. I think that was a veryproductive period, and I hope you are going through it too. But one thing Ilearned only much later: You have to open up to people who care about you.Otherwise you’re just pretending to put on attitudes. You are going along to getalong.The deeper someone else cares for you, the deeper you care for yourself.WHEN SOMEBODY REALLY CARESThis is one of life’s spiritual rules, even though lots of teens try to duck outof it. They pretend not to care. They try to go it alone. They keep secrets anddevelop a private world in their room. Yes, you can retreat into a private worldfor a while, but it’s not a real substitute for hearing someone else say suchthings as“You’re great. I don’t know what I’d do without you.”“I love hearing what you have to say.”“You really know your own mind. I like that.”“People are going to want to listen to you.”It would be great if every teen heard these words at home. Even if you don’t,it’s up to you to find a way to hear them from somebody. You need a reflectionof your worth. That’s how real, lasting self-confidence is built. You get toknow that you matter. You don’t matterif. That is, you don’t matterif you’resmart, orif you do what your parents say, orif you’re good-looking and popular.All thoseif s are irrelevant. You should matter just because you are you. Isthat an idea you already agree with? Ask yourself the following questions:Am I sure I’d be forgiven at home if I did something really wrong?Would my parents sympathize if my grades fell, or would they look disappointedand critical?If I dated a black person or became best friends with a gay person, would myclique still like me?If I passed out political buttons at school for an unpopular candidate, would myfriends still respect me?MAKING THE GRADEIn your life these may be hypothetical questions. The real-life situations mightnever come up. Yet the time always arrives when you’ll find out if people carefor you just because you’re you, or if they want something from you instead.Friends of course have a right to want things. They want companionship. Theywant us to sympathize with them. They want shared interests and like opinions.If you fall into line and give these things, it’s fairly smooth sailing.One girl said to me, “I hung around with my best friend for four years, and thenone day she suddenly turned to me and said, ‘Don’t come over to my houseanymore. We’re finished.’ I was totally shocked, but after a while I realizedthat in all those years I’d never had the nerve to ask her how she really feltabout me. I guess she had some pretty bad feelings, and the only way she couldlet them out was to say good-bye. I learned a lesson there. Now even if I’m alittle afraid, I try to find out how someone really feels about me before we gettoo deep.”Like this girl, you need to know if you are wanted just for yourself. Maybeyou’ll dare to step out and do something the crowd doesn’t like. Then thingswill get really interesting. There’s a lot to be said about this. In the nextchapter on relationships, I’ll go deeper into how to make true friends. For themoment just know that to really enjoy a sense of well-being, you have to caredeeply about yourself and be with people who care for you just as much.The Fifth Key To Happiness:No Self-JudgmentWhich profile is closest to you?Profile #1I feel pretty complete and happy with myself. I don’t get intimidated. Otherscan’t put me down because I don’t put myself down. I don’t care what others sayabout me. It may hurt for a day, but I forget their opinion and go on doing whatI always do: trying to be the best me I can be.Profile #2I have an all right self-image, but I get shaky when the going gets rough. Ithurts when other kids are mean, and in secret I wonder if they say other badthings behind my back. Worse, those bad things may be true. But on the whole Iam getting by pretty well, and once I am grown up, I expect to feel better aboutmyself.Profile #3I’ve been told that I’m too hard on myself. Yes, I can be self-critical. ButI’ve always been that way, and I’d rather see the bad parts of myself first,before someone hurts my feelings by pointing them out later. I can say thingsabout them that are just as mean as what they can say about me. If I could finda way not to be down on myself so much, I’d love to stop, but no one has evershowed me how.SELF-DOUBTA whole book could be written—and I’m sure has been—on why teens are so hard onthemselves. Self-doubt seems to be part of the package during these in-betweenyears. But that doesn’t mean that it is natural to judge against yourself. A lotof things are new. You are experiencing them for the first time, and thereforedoubt can be a healthy thing. It helps to show you whether you are going to begood at something like baseball or math or dancing or being in a rock band.Unhealthy doubt isn’t helpful because it says, “You’re not going to be any goodat this,” before you even start.DOUBT CAN BE HEALTHYThis is such an important issue that I want to expand on it. Think of somethingyou were really in doubt about. It could be anything where the outcome wasuncertain, maybe in the dating scene or going out for sports or trying a newactivity. Which kind of thoughts went through your head?Two Kinds of DoubtHealthy doubt says, “Maybe I’ll be good at this, maybe not.”Unhealthy doubt says, “I’m going to be no good at this, I just know.”Healthy doubt says, “I won’t find out anything unless I give it a try.”Unhealthy doubt says, “Don’t bother to try. What good will it do?”Healthy doubt says, “Nobody else has much confidence in me, but this just mightwork anyway.”Unhealthy doubt says, “Everybody’s right. I shouldn’t do stuff I’m no good at.”Healthy doubt says, “This might be fun, even if I’m not the best one here.”Unhealthy doubt says, “If I’m not the best, I won’t have any fun.”Healthy doubt says, “I’ll stick with it just a little while longer.”Unhealthy doubt says, “The first thing that goes wrong, I’m out of here.”There’s a wonderful Jewish anecdote about God right after he created the world.He took a look at his creation and said, “Let’s hope it works.” As this listshows, healthy doubt is a lot like hope. You know that you might fall down. Youknow that every moment isn’t going to be a triumph. But even with those doubtsyou move ahead. You ask the girl out who might be too good for you. You go todance class even if it embarrasses you. You try out for crew even though everyother rower outweighs you by forty pounds.DON’T BUY INUnhealthy doubt is hopeless. It gives up in advance. This kind of doubt istricky because it sounds so reasonable. It’s very easy to buy into the idea thatthe girl you like really is too good for you, dance class really is for wimps,and those other rowers on crew really are huge. You need to step back when youhave those kinds of doubts and say, “I’m not buying into doubt. Those externalsdon’t matter. What matters is that I go and try. I have to see for myself.” Inother words, you have to be a little braver than you feel, a little moreconfident, and a little more optimistic.You know what? If you can go that extra step, your reality will change. You willwind up being more brave, confident, and optimistic. Doubt will be conquered,not by fighting it in a big battle, but by winning one small victory at a time.The Sixth Key to Happiness:Make Friends with SpiritWhich profile is closest to you?Profile #1I know I have a soul. I go inside whenever I have a tough problem to solve, andI trust that an answer will come. I believe this is a good world and thateveryone has a spiritual side. You may not see it all the time, but it’s enoughto make me have faith in the human race.Profile #2I believe in God and try to be a good person. But when I have a tough problem tosolve, I work and struggle on my own. I know that life is unfair. It’s sort ofwishful thinking to believe that God is going to change anything.Profile #3God? A soul? Why are we even discussing this stuff? I will believe in thesethings when I see them live on TV. Otherwise, the smart thing is to look out fornumber one. If you don’t, nobody else is going to.Being in touch with spirit helps to get you through the difficult times in yourlife. Your spirit offers hope and reassurance. In that way it’s like a friend,and when I think about being in contact with spirit, it’s like any otherfriendship. You need to be able to trust in your soul. You need to be able totalk to it and bring your problems to it when things don’t go so well.MEDITATION IS RIGHT FOR YOUWe talked a little bit already about meditating. That’s the main way I know ofto contact spirit. You see, your soul is mixed in with the other things insideyour mind. All day you experience thoughts and images, mental pictures, desires.In fact, every action you take today will have some kind of thought behind it.There’s a whole drama—sometimes a circus—going on in there. Meditation allowsyou to step out of the drama. When everything is more settled down in your mind,then a softer, quieter part comes forward. That part is closer to spirit, and asyou make friends with it, new things happen:You begin to like it when your mind is quiet and peaceful.You don’t get as shaken up by the storms around you.You feel like a real person, not a Ping-Pong ball tossed around by events.You start to talk to the real you and make friends with it.All these changes don’t happen overnight, but just like any other aspect ofhappiness, befriending your soul will happen. All you need to do is keep at itand learn to appreciate the steps of progress that you make.AN EASY WAY TO MEDITATEIf there’s one thing in your life that should be totally easy and comfortable,it’s meditation. But sometimes the pressure from the rest of your life spillsover. A seventeen-year-old boy wrote:Dear Deepak,I am finding it hard to sit still to meditate. My mind races around, and I feelso restless after a few minutes that I want to jump up. What do I do?It’s okay to feel restless. You’ve spent a lot of years allowing your mind torace around. It’s in the habit of being restless, and you can’t expect it tolearn to calm down overnight. Be easy on yourself, and try the followingpointers: * Lie down for a few minutes to relax and get in the mood before you meditate. * Take a few deep breaths if your mind feels restless. * Open your eyes and look around for a second if you feel like jumping up. Then close them and try to meditate a few minutes more. * Make sure you always pick a quiet room and a quiet time of day to meditate. Unplug the phone and be sure that others around you know that this is your private time.A few minutes twice a day is better than pushing yourself to sit for a longertime. Don’t push at all. This is your time to make friends with a new part ofyourself. You’d never want to be friends with someone at school whom you had toforce yourself to like. The same is true for your friendship with your ownspirit.I once heard a spiritual teacher say that there are two ways to keep a dog closeto home: You can tie it up or you can leave a little food by the back door. Thefirst way forces it to stick around. The second way entices it by holding outsomething the dog likes. The soul can be attracted only in the second way, bygiving it something enticing. Instead of keeping away, it will say to itself,“Oh, he’s actually paying attention. He wants to know me, and it feels real.”The soul is attracted to be with you in many ways. Meditation is only one ofthem. Include some of the activities from the sidebar “Food for Your Soul” inyour daily routine.FOOD FOR YOUR SOUL:THINGS THAT HELPYOU MAKE FRIENDSWITH SPIRITLaughing from the heartListening to inspiring musicReading inspiring booksShowing loving behaviorBeing kind to yourselfShowing gentlenessPlaying games that bring out the fun of lifeWalking in the moonlight, gazing at the oceanBeing in a still forestSharing a beautiful experience with someoneGiving and helping, offering to be of serviceAs you can see by that list, you don’t have to plunge into a strange or exoticspiritual life to be in touch with your soul. These are all everyday things thatattract spirit as naturally as sugar water in a feeder attracts hummingbirds.They bring out the peace and stillness, the joy and awareness, that are insideyou right now, ready to show themselves.I put laughter first on the list because of a delightful question I got from ahigh school junior from Brazil:Dear Deepak,I am very interested in the philosophy of life, but on a beautiful day I can’thelp myself: I skip my religion class at our Catholic school and go dancing withmy friends. I love to dance! Don’t you think a person can learn as much aboutlife from dancing as from class?Don’t show this to your parents, but yes, I do. Pure happiness, which is whatdancing is all about, brings you very close to your soul. I am reminded of astory about the famous writer Gertrude Stein when she was in college. She cameinto class to take her philosophy final, and to her professor’s surprise, sheturned in her exam after two minutes and left.On her paper she had written, “This is such a beautiful day, I don’t think I canstay indoors and write about philosophy.”The professor wrote back, “You’re right,” and gave her an A.KEEPING THE SOUL AWAYI won’t dwell on the opposite topic, the things that keep the soul away. Yoursoul isn’t really a delicate hummingbird. It’s eternal and cannot be hurt, nomatter what you do or what anyone does to you. But the soul can be covered over,like clouds covering the sun. After four or five gloomy days in a row you stareat the grayness and say, “Is the sun ever coming back?” You know it is, but thegrayness puts you in a glum mood.If you spend too many gloomy days inside yourself, you can begin to doubt thatyour soul is even there. To avoid that kind of glum doubt, don’t engage in harshactivity. That includes harsh music, being mean to others, hanging around withhard, tough people—that sort of thing. But distractions also keep the soul outof sight. You can’t really expect to contact spirit if your head is buzzing withTV, music, and video games every free minute of the day. I’m not saying this ina mood of disapproval. Everyone has their pet distractions. But if you want tomake friends with your soul, it deserves some quality attention like any otherfriend.The Seventh Key to Happiness:Make a ContributionWhich profile is closest to you?Profile #1I really like being helpful and giving to others. So much so that I may go intoone of the helping professions, like medicine. It makes me feel good to see thehappiness I can bring to others, and I am aware of how much needs to be changedin the world.Profile #2Helping isn’t high on my list, but I pitch in when asked. I think it’s good tomake a contribution where you can. Maybe someday I will have to ask for helpwhen I am in a jam, so maybe I’m building up some brownie points with God byhelping someone else.Profile #3I don’t think about making a contribution. It’s not that I am so selfish, but mylife is pretty full right now. Anyway, I’m not so sure one person can reallymake a difference. I will have more time for others once I make a good life formyself.SHARE YOUR SPIRITAny time you help to increase someone’s well-being, you are contributing totheir life and also to everyone else’s. That’s because spirit is shared. When awave rises on the ocean, it could look around and say, “I’m alone. I’m myself,and this is my ocean.” But of course each wave is just one small event in thevastness of the ocean. In the same way, your soul feels separate when in fact itis part of spirit as a whole. Wherever there is kindness and love in the world,you are invisibly benefitted. Wherever there is violence and hurt in the world,you are invisibly diminished.I’m not asking you to believe a mystical idea. You’ve already experienced whatit’s like to have something really good happen to your family, or somethingreally bad. I remember when I was quite small and woke up in the night to hearwomen crying all over the house. This was in India, and my grandfather hadsuddenly died in the night. Just that day he had taken me and my youngerbrother, Sanjiv, to the movies. We both loved him very much, and the moment hedied, the whole atmosphere in the house changed. I was old enough to know whatdeath was, but Sanjiv kept tearfully asking where Baba had gone and when he wascoming back. Everyone was very upset, for something dreadful had happened, andit was happening to all of us.YOU ARE A PART OF EVERYTHINGWhen you watch the TV news and see war unfolding around the world, that samefeeling of “It’s happening to all of us” is present. Your spirit is helped orhurt by events far away. I think it’s important to do something with your lifethat helps everyone’s well-being, because that’s how you show that you careabout the whole human family.Alfred Stieglitz was one of the century’s greatest photographers, and he alsoreached out and helped many other artists. As a child he showed a very specialattitude toward life. His parents noticed that on snowy winter nights he wouldslip out the back door for a few moments and then return silently without sayingwhy. They soon discovered that there was a homeless man who camped out in thealley, and their son was giving him some of his own allowance.“That’s wonderful,” Stieglitz’s parents said. “You’re doing good for anotherperson.”The boy looked a little baffled. “Don’t you see? I’m doing it for myself,” hesaid.Some people have a different idea of what the wordcontribution means. They mightcontribute to one political party so that it can beat another. But a spiritualcontribution doesn’t take sides; it works to help the whole human spirit. Somepeople make contributions to charity, which is certainly a good thing to do. Butto me, a spiritual contribution is personal; it involves human contact and notjust a number written on a piece of paper. Your contribution doesn’t have to bebig. Think about doing any of the following: * Don’t you know someone who might be lonely? Visit them. * Don’t you know someone who could use a friend? Be that friend. * Don’t you know someone who’s falling behind in class? Offer to tutor them. * Don’t you see homeless people on the street, including kids your own age? Help them by working at a shelter. * Don’t you know that many children have few advantages in life? Become a big brother or sister to a disadvantaged child. * Don’t you see a way to help your own little brother or sister? Act on your good impulses and be a better big brother or sister.You aren’t changing the world when you do any of these things, yet in a way youare. At the invisible level you’ve added a bit toward the well-being of thehuman soul. Your contribution touches everyone even when you seem to be touchingone person at a time.The Eighth Key to Happiness:Avoid ViolenceWhich profile is closest to you?Profile #1I feel enough peace with myself that it’s easy to be peaceful toward others. Idon’t have anger and resentment that I keep hidden. It’s okay for me to tellsomeone else when they have made me mad, and I take responsibility for its beingmy anger and not their fault. I look for ways to forgive, and my natural urge isto find a way to settle conflicts.Profile #2I don’t go looking for trouble, and so my life runs pretty peacefully. I do havea temper, and I can hold grudges when somebody makes me mad. It’s not my faultif I resent others; it’s their fault for doing the wrong thing. It makes me feelgood to forgive somebody, but I don’t go out of my way to do it. They have tocome to me first.Profile #3I can remember getting into quite a few fights, and I still have a temper. Idon’t put up with stuff. You better know that if you cross me, you’ll havetrouble on your hands. Things can get pretty rough at home—at least one of myparents has a hot temper. It bothers me that I hold grudges a long time, butwhat else am I supposed to do?WHY ARE WE SO VIOLENT?One of the biggest questions in life is whether human beings are born to beviolent. In a typical year, like 2003, there are thirty wars going on somewherearound the world. In the entire history of civilization it has been computedthat 92 percent of the time human beings were at war. No one needs statistics toprove that crime has been present 100 percent of the time. Personal violence isthe root cause of war, and even though you and I may consider ourselvespeaceful, we’ve probably gotten into a fight at one time or another, egged on afistfight at school, rooted for one side to win a war, or gotten into hotheadedarguments.So violence is with us all. It mars the human spirit every day. Can we dowithout it? That’s a totally personal question, because violence has to end oneperson at a time. Avoiding violence means avoiding all its disguises, too. Iimagine you didn’t beat anybody up today, but what about these forms of hiddenviolence?Violence in DisguisePicking an argument with a family memberSpeaking ill of someone behind their backWishing that something bad will happen to someoneJudging someone to be evilRooting for the bad guys to be wiped outCheering on a warWanting criminals to be punished to the maxMistreating or neglecting an animalInsulting someoneUsing a racial slurHaving contempt for a whole group of peopleYou might not think these are violent acts. You might even be in the habit ofhaving bad thoughts or using ethnic slurs with the vague notion that it’s okayas long as you don’t carry things too far. But if you’ve ever stood around abonfire, you know that throwing a log on the fire isn’t the only way to get itto burn higher. All it takes is a little extra breeze. When you indulge in thesehidden forms of violence, you are adding to the breeze. You haven’t actuallyhurt someone physically, yet you have made it easier for that to happen.BE ON THE LOOKOUTIt takes a little vigilance to avoid violence. Think about what it’s like to getinto a really heated debate. Let’s say you’ve gotten into a political debatewith somebody. Isn’t it easy to cross the line and sneer at the other side, totrash their opinion and make them feel as if only you are the good person? Onesees that kind of political fight on television every night. Yet it is a form ofviolence. You are verbally and mentally trying to wipe somebody out. Makingsomeone out to be a bad person is uncalled-for aggression. At the very least,two people can have opposite opinions and yet be equally good people.A STORY OF SELF-DEFENSEThere is a difference between aggression and self-defense, however. When I was astarving intern fresh out of medical school, I lived in a rough part of Bostonwith my young wife and newborn baby girl. One night I was alone in the apartmentwith my daughter. There was a pounding at the door, and without warning a manbarged in. He was acting very violent, and without thinking, I picked up abaseball bat. He charged at me, and I swung at his head, knocking him out. Whenthe police came, they discovered that he had a long criminal record, and therewas no question that I had a right to defend myself.A TWIST TO THE STORYBut that incident must have preyed on my mind. Even though I had used aggressionto defend myself against violence, I felt a deep sorrow for what had happened.Almost thirty years later I left a lecture hall by the back door and was walkingdown a dark alley. Three youths approached me, pulled out a gun, and demanded mywallet. I froze for a second, then I said, “You can have my money, but I need mywallet. Don’t use that gun, because you will be hurting yourself much more thanyou’ll hurt me.”These were kids no more than sixteen or seventeen, and I could sense that theyhad not yet become completely bad. The one holding the gun trembled, and I couldsee that my words had had an effect. I did wind up handing over some money butkeeping my wallet. As they ran away, I had the sense that these kids got to seetheir own violence through someone else’s eyes. Maybe that will make adifference in their own lives. For myself, I felt that I had helped to restorethe balance. I had committed violence long ago, and now I might have reduced itby a fraction.This tale isn’t about putting yourself in harm’s way. I just hope you will lookat the list of disguised violence and make a good effort to stop doing anythingthat fits your current behavior. Never again use a slur, even in jest. Don’troot for war and fall into the trap of thinking that a whole nation or group ofpeople is evil. No matter how angry you get at someone, it is a truism thatevery person on Earth has someone who loves them. If a person is worth someone’slove, they aren’t worth your hatred. It’s as simple as that. Violence in all itssubtle forms ends with you and every other spiritual person who is willing towalk away.The Ninth Key to Happiness:Cherish NatureWhich profile is closest to you?Profile #1I am close to nature. I know that I am part of Mother Earth, who deserves loveand respect. None of us would be alive without the nourishment of our planet,and whenever I can, I get out into nature so that I can appreciate it firsthand.Profile #2I know the earth has problems, and I care. But there are a lot of other problemsa lot closer to home. I figure the planet has always been here and always willbe. Maybe somebody will figure out what to do about global warming. In themeantime, I enjoy going to the beach or the mountains, but mostly my life isspent at home and at the mall.Profile #3I think all this alarm about the planet has gone too far. We need oil and gas,that’s the reality. I’m not cutting down the rain forest, so it’s not myproblem. My kids may seriously have to worry long ahead in the future. For rightnow, I have television and the Internet. Nature feels pretty far away, frankly.FIRST, AN APOLOGYMy generation has to apologize to your generation. We did more to harm theplanet than anyone born before us. This isn’t because my generation is made upof people with bad instincts. We have the same instincts as the human beings whocame before us. But unfortunately, modern life gave us undreamed-of powers to doharm. As a result, the earth has been stripped of its treasures as never before,and its most delicate ecosystems are in peril.Your generation must cherish the planet once more. It’s not possible to behealthy in an unhealthy world. You may never dive under the sea to gaze inamazement at a coral reef, but the fact that a third of the world’s coral reefsare dying is part of your life now, along with the dying rain forests and globalwarming. There is no better time to learn to love this planet.CHERISHING THE EARTHThe only healthy way to be on this planet is to see yourself as a brief flickerin the infinite progress of life and yet as a cherished child of nature. Thebest reason to cherish the earth is that it cherishes you. Here are the dyingwords of a Blackfoot Indian chief named Isapwo Muksika Crowfoot:What is life? It is the flash of a firefly in the night. It is the breath of abuffalo in the wintertime. It is the little shadow which runs across the grassand loses itself in the sunset.I can see each image and feel the chief’s love and wisdom, which came to himfrom the earth. No other creature except man is capable of loving all othercreatures. Yet no other creature is capable of doing so much harm. You andeveryone your age will have to make decisions based on sympathy for the earth orcruelty toward it.Which is more important, doubling the price of gasoline or doubling thepollution in the air?Which will harm you more, paying extra taxes or dirty factory smokestacks?Is it more important to water our lawns three times a week or to send riverwater to another country, like Mexico?My generation has asked these questions without successfully answering them. Wewanted to answer without selfishness, but ultimately good intentions weren’tenough. So there has to be a change of attitude that goes as deep as the soul.You would never harm your family just for cheap gas, and in time you will haveto realize that you are harming the human family by insisting on cheap gas. It’snot simple, because global issues force us to see the world through the eyes ofstrangers from other countries. I think the answers must begin with a love fornature. Loving nature is like loving your own body, because in the largerpicture the air is the breathing of your lungs, the forests are the fiber ofyour muscles, and the ocean is the water in every cell. You came from thesebeginnings as surely as you came out of your mother.The Tenth Key to Happiness:Never Stop GrowingWhich profile is closest to you?Profile #1I believe that my life can be exceptional. I embrace new things every day—newknowledge, new experiences, new hopes for my future. I can’t wait to grow up, sothat I can “grow on” for the rest of my life. The people I admire most haveadventurous spirits.Profile #2I look forward to having a good life. I think family is the most importantthing, and I intend to provide for my own family one day with a good house andall kinds of great things. The people I admire the most have done this and more.They have great material accomplishments to their credit.Profile #3It’s tough to be where I am right now, and what I most hope for is to get out ofschool and out on my own. I want to stop following someone else’s rules. This ismy life, and when I get the chance, I’m going to do whatever I want. The peopleI admire the most are rockers and rebels, the kind who don’t let anyone tellthem what to do.GROWING IS PECULIARGrowing starts out as something you can’t help doing. Babies and young childrendon’t think about growing; the whole process is built into their genes. Did youknow that just before birth a baby is growing a million new nerve connectionsper minute? Or that a single liver cell, something you’ll never see or thinkabout, has to perform more than fifty operations perfectly? Or that the storm ofchemical activity in one cell erupts with a new reaction about every one hundredthousandth of a second? The most complex object in the universe, the human body,has to grow on automatic because none of us, even the most gifted genius, couldfigure out how to build one.But gradually things change, and by the time you get out of your teenage years,growing becomes a choice. The master control is given over to you. Your body andmind have played their automatic software; the genes have done their infinitelycomplex work. There’s no ribbon-cutting ceremony, but in fact your genes areturning to you right now and saying, “This is yours to drive. Where do you wantto go? What do you intend to do?”If I could answer my genes, I’d say, “I want to grow forever.” These years arereally the turning point. You can use this incredible genetic gift for anythingyou want. Most people use it to stop growing, which is sad. Instead of surfingthat tidal wave of progress that has been moving forward for twenty years, theysay to themselves, “Let’s slow down. The adventure is over.” In other words,they become settled, comfortable adults with a lot of habits.SHARKS AND CATTLEHabitis just another word for “training your mind to follow a groove.” Here aretwo examples that caught my attention years ago, one from an aquarium full ofsharks, the other from a cattle range in Montana. As you probably know, sharksare perpetually restless creatures that must keep swimming to stay alive. Theones I heard about prowled their tank every hour, swimming from one end to theother, almost touching the glass wall of the tank before veering off.One day their keeper tried an experiment and moved the wall a few feet away. Butinstead of swimming up to the new barrier, the sharks turned just before theyhit the old wall, which wasn’t even there. This story says a lot about our ownhabits. We stay inside of invisible barriers because we assume that they exist.What if they don’t? What if you have a much bigger tank to swim in? You’ll neverknow if you train yourself to follow a narrow set of habits, because these willact like invisible barriers.The other story is about keeping cattle on the ranch. Cattle like to grazewherever they can wander, and the ranches in Montana are too vast to fence in.Long ago the ranchers learned that cattle won’t cross a road that has a metalgrate in it, because their hooves get caught in the grate. This technique workedvery well, but then someone discovered a clever improvement. Instead ofinstalling a real grate in the road, they painted a picture of a grate, and thecattle, seeing that, took it for the real thing. They didn’t want their hoovescaught in the grate, so they stayed on the other side of the road permanently.Our habits are also like that. Once we feel hurt by an experience, we don’treturn to it. We are spooked like cattle, and the minute we get near anythingthat smells of our old hurt or failure or humiliation, we veer away.HOW TO KEEP GROWINGIf you want to grow for the rest of your life, you’ll have to overcome boththese tendencies: the tendency to stay inside old walls, and the tendency to shyaway from experiences when they don’t turn out perfectly. As a wise person oncesaid, “Life isn’t about being perfect. It’s about being better every day.”The kind of habits that hold you back from growing aren’t simple things likebrushing your teeth every morning or always catching your favorite TV show. I’mreferring to psychological habits, the kind that keep life from expanding. Seeif you fit any of the sketches listed in the sidebar “The Habit Trap.”We all fall into these traps at one time or another. But it’s good to be on thelookout in case you find that one is really sinking in and becoming your pethabit. For more than eighty years fans mourned the Red Sox and always expectedthem to lose out on the World Series—that would be pessimism—but that didn’thelp them win (which they finally did in 2004). And what if you believe thatyou’ll never find the right person to marry? That’s also pessimistic, and yourgloomy expectations hurt your chances of finding love. Each of these traps islike that. There’s no harm in seeing the world through rose-colored glasses ifyou are planning the senior prom and want it to be the prettiest event you’veever seen, but what if someone came to you with a drug problem? Then smiling andsaying “Oh, it’ll all turn out okay. You’re still a beautiful person” isn’tright.THE HABIT TRAP: HOWTHE MIND GETSSTUCK IN A GROOVETRAP #1:Blindly OpinionatedI make up my mind fast. Once I do, I don’t look any further. My opinion is myopinion. Don’t try to change it.TRAP #2:The ConformistMy buddies and I know what we think. We know what kinds of things we like anddon’t like. I keep with the group’s ideas. I think others envy me because I knowI belong.TRAP #3:The Black SheepI’m a rebel, so I reject whatever somebody tells me just because they are incharge. If my father thinks something—or anyone else his age—it’s automaticallywrong.TRAP #4:The Little MouseI steer away from big topics. I don’t follow the world of politics or majorissues of the day. My life is simple. I keep to the things that concern me everyday.TRAP #5:The CynicWhy believe in anything? I know in advance that most people are either lying orfooling themselves. Only a sucker believes that goodness prevails. The smartpeople have figured out life in advance.TRAP #6:Rose-Colored GlassesEverything’s going to turn out fine, just you wait and see. I don’t bother aboutall the problems people see everywhere. Life always has problems, but if you arepatient, the best will happen in the end.TRAP #7:The PessimistI hate to be blindsided, so I expect the worst. If I’m wrong and something goodhappens, well, great. Thanks for the surprise. But I’ve been burned too manytimes, so now I protect myself.STAY OUT OF THE TRAPI ran across a brilliant article on advertising. It talked about how to get themost people to buy what you have to sell, whether it’s cars, soft drinks, orshaving cream. There was one secret to all of them:Make the consumer think he’sa rebel. Show a tough, macho guy riding off on a Harley, and the viewer willwant to be that guy (of course, this works only for males, really). Now put abottle of soda in his hand—or a video game, or give him a certain pair ofjeans—and presto!Drinking this cola makes you a rebel! It doesn’t really,though. All it does is invite the viewer to share in Trap #3, the Black Sheep.The writer of the article didn’t talk much about female consumers, but thehypnotic image for them is romance and glamour. In other words, Trap #6,Rose-Colored Glasses, which make you a supermodel if you buy this diet cola.Funny how the same soft drink can make you either macho or glamorous, but suchis the power of habit. You’re not expected to think, only to respond.If you really want to grow for a lifetime, start rejecting these habit trapsnow. It’s the best way to keep growing, because the only mind that keeps growingisn’t the brilliant mind, but the free mind. It’s a gift you and only you cangive yourself."},{"pageContent":"4RELATIONSHIPS“HOW DO I FIT IN? WHERE WILL I FIND LOVE?”The spiritual rule about relationships is simple: Everything is connected. Thisrule is so important because it cancels out a lot of what our emotions tell us.Emotionally it’s a lot easier to be out for yourself. You want others to satisfywhatever it is you want. You feel different, set apart. In your worst momentsyou feel completely alone.But it’s not really like that.Everyone harbors a fantasy about being the most important person in the world,or always being right and never contradicted. This fantasy works when you are ababy, because at that age your mother and father rush to meet your every need.By the time you are a teen, however, the world has changed. Parents say no alot. Teachers make demands that you have to fulfill if you want to move ahead.Friends divide into cliques that only grow more divided over time. The fantasyof being number one fades, and what replaces it?Relationships—and all the work that goes into them.AN EASIER WAYI’d like to show you that spirit can make these relationships much less work andmuch more fulfilling. At the level of the soul your fantasy comes true. You arenumber one, but at the same time you make room for the needs of all those otherpeople who want to be number one also.I’m sure you’ve heard someone say, “I’m not in a relationship right now.” But isthat really possible? Our whole life is spent in relationships. Think about thesimplest of sentences, “I am.” No matter what word follows, you’ve named arelationship.“I am a son or a daughter.” That’s a relationship with your family.“I am in school.” That’s a relationship with your peers and your town.“I am captain of the football team.” That’s a relationship with your team andyour fans.“I am from Ohio.” That’s a relationship to a state and a country.You can begin to see why the spiritual rule of relationships—everything isconnected—is true. An invisible web holds the world together. Every person onEarth is part of it; every living creature depends upon it. With that in mind,look at the following questions:Dear Deepak,What do you think about premarital sex?Should parents spank their children?Where will the world be in twenty-five years?What do you think about interracial dating?Do you like everyone you work with?Why are my parents so crazy?All these questions came from different young people, but they could have beenfrom one. I remember asking all these things myself, and yet they come down tothe same question: “How am I supposed to relate?”If you can answer that question, the smaller ones become much easier. Sex,parents, school, race—all these issues become easier once you realize thateveryone is connected. Because then it is never “us versus them.” It’s neverwho’s the bad guy and who’s the good guy. You begin to see that there’s good andbad in everyone, and we’re all in this together.FIGURING IT ALL OUTThe pressure to figure out relationships gets much stronger in the teen years.You worry about being seen with the right crowd, about fitting in and avoidingcriticism. As a result, a lot of teens make short-term choices. They fall forthe “us versus them” mentality in the desperate hope that this attitude willoffer some much needed protection.My friends are cool. Those guys aren’t.I’m a junior. Don’t talk to me, because you’re only a freshman.Our team is going to kill your team.Our school is the best. Their school is the pits.Don’t you hear these statements—or very close equivalents—every day? Theyillustrate the “us versus them” mentality. People who talk like this aren’tusually being mean for the sake of being mean. They want to belong. They want tofeel good about who they are. They want sharp lines to exist between good andbad. In time they might even believe in those things. But it’s not the spiritualway to see the world; it’s not how your soul sees you or anybody else.Everyone is connected, which means that we are all the same spiritually. That’sthe soul’s view, and I believe it’s the best way to deal with relationships. Youweren’t put here on this earth to sit in judgment over who is cool or superioror good. You are here to contribute to the delicate web of humanity. By makingconnections stronger in any way you can, you are giving hope for the future.IS THIS YOUR FANTASY?There are other fantasies that grip teens. One is this: “If only I can find theright man (or woman), then all my troubles will be solved.” Another is this: “IfI build a beautiful family in a beautiful house, my life will be perfect.” A lotof effort is put into both fantasies, not just by teens, but by our wholesociety. Well, I was fortunate and married my first love. We built a beautifulfamily, but that was only the start of fulfilling many other needs. Needs can befilled only through relationships.Let’s look again at those teen questions, and others, with that in mind.When is Sex Right?Q: What do you think about premarital sex?A: What I think is just another adult’s opinion. What do you think about sexamong your friends and the other kids at school? Now we’ve taken the questioninto the area where it counts. You are going to live by the values you believein, and what are they? Adults seem to think that sex is dangerous among teensbecause they have no control over “raging hormones.” Yet surveys show that teenssplit off into groups over sex. If you have friends who are already having sex,you won’t hold the same values as someone whose friends don’t have sex. Butwhatever group you belong to, 80 percent of teens say that having sex whenyou’re too young isn’t cool. It makes you a loser, to use their own word.I don’t believe this is about being cool or being a loser. As a teen, you feel asexual drive and must come to terms with it. Which means that sex comes up andyou have to make a decision. These are the questions you need to ask:Will I feel good about my decision tomorrow?Will I keep my dignity and reputation?How do other kids whom I admire act?Which adults seem to have the best advice on this subject?By asking these questions, you are relating. You aren’t just stuck by yourselfin the backseat of a car or on a bed before your parents come home from work. Itbecomes hard to resist that other person who is saying, “Come on, let’s do it.It will feel good.” In the context of your whole life feeling good for half anhour may have a sorrowful payback later.So get in the habit of asking the questions above. You’ll find it easier to sayno. The day will come when you can ask these same questions and come up with adifferent answer: “Yes, my friends, my age group at school, and everyone I trustwill be glad that I am going to experience sex.” When you can say that, you havea good chance to experience the beautiful side of sex and not just a brief rushof excitement.BAD REASONS FOR SEXIn any case, if you find yourself pressured to have sex, always say no. Ifsomeone is going to strip you of your dignity, always say no. If someone isgoing to talk behind your back and label you as loose, always say no. If someoneasks for unprotected sex, always say no.But here’s the hard one. If you are tempted to have sex so that someone willlike you and make you feel more secure, absolutely say no. You won’t get whatyou’re hoping for, and often you will get the exact opposite.How Much Discipline?Q: Should parents spank their children?A: This is really a question that I’d expect from parents, but I think it camefrom a teen because teens are thinking about the future. You are starting torelate more to the adult world, where parental decisions will be yours. Let’sbroaden this question a little and ask, “How much discipline should parentsexert at home?” To me, the rules here are pretty straightforward.WHEN DISCIPLINE FAILSIf you demean with punishment, you’ve gone too far.A child should never behumiliated or made to feel unloved.If you remove a child’s dignity, you’ve gone too far.A child should never bemade to feel like a bad person. We all make mistakes, but we remain good peoplenonetheless.If you try to force good behavior, you will fail.The best discipline sends amessage, “I am disappointed in your behavior. I expected better.” Trying toforce a child to follow certain values only instills resentment and rebellion.Discipline without love is cruelty.Every parent who has ever struck a child inanger feels guilty afterward. In your heart you know whether you lashed out infrustration or to let off steam or because you didn’t know any better way toreact. Those aren’t acceptable excuses. Punishment should be a reluctant choicethat is made out of love and caring for a child.As for what I think is fair during the teenage years, I don’t believe in toughlove. So-called tough love is like shutting the barn door after the horse isgone. Real love has already failed. Real love is always the answer, and it mustdevelop over time, starting very early. Real love makes a kid feel worthy andrespected. Real love makes a kid feel safe and wanted. Real love drawsboundaries but doesn’t guard them with fear.CHANGING THE PASTYou need to see that your actions form a pattern. Something you do today isconnected to what you did yesterday. Parents discipline according to how theirchildren have acted in the past. So don’t isolate yourself and try to cut yourparents off. This isn’t “us versus them.” Change your pattern, and then youractions will speak for themselves. Ask yourself about your past: * Do you have a habit of ignoring requests from your parents? * Do you tune them out? * Do you say you will do something just to get them off your back? * Do you resent having to do your fair share around the house? * Do you just want them to leave you alone?All these things will cause any parent to step up the discipline. Why? Becauseyou are letting down your half of the relationship, and they see no alternativebut to impose more discipline. It really comes down to that. They aren’t on yourcase. They don’t want to turn you into a military recruit. What’s happened isthat you have disconnected from them. As soon as you disconnect, you violate thespiritual rule of relationships, which is that everything is connected.MAKE THE CONNECTIONIf you reconnect, things will get better. Your parents will sense the loweredstress and tension, and once that happens, they won’t feel a need to try to getyour attention through rules and schedules.So how do you reconnect?You have to make today different from yesterday. Your parents have an image ofyou built up over the years. You have an image of them built up over the years.It’s these images that have gotten stuck. In reality you are more than an image,and so are they. So by acting more real and human, you can get unstuck.It’s human to talk and communicate. It’s not human to tune people out.It’s human to be interested in others. It’s not human to be in your own fortressof solitude.It’s human to care. It’s not human to be apathetic.It’s human to cooperate. It’s not human to throw up obstacles and resistance.Put yourself on the human side of the equation again. Yes, I know that I haveloaded the wordhuman here. There are many human beings who are apathetic,uncooperative, obstructive, and isolated, but that’s not the side of humannature you want to encourage. I think you can find one thing to do today thatfits each point:You can take ten minutes to talk to each parent alone.You can communicate one thing that interests you.You can show interest in one thing they care about.You can do one chore without being asked.You can find one rule that you have stubbornly resisted and tell them that youfeel like cooperating.Don’t feel as if you are giving in to the enemy by doing these things. Youaren’t. It may be that on some issues you are more in the right than yourparents. It may be that they need to change as much as you do—or at least some.But there’s only one way to get to a fair balance. You have to soften from yourside and then learn to negotiate over unfair rules. Disobedience will onlyharden the battle lines further. At the soul level your parents have perfectlove for you; at the soul level you have perfect love for them. With this inmind, you have a basis for hope—every situation can be brought closer to thespiritual ideal.The World is a MirrorQ: Where will the world be in twenty-five years?A: Not being a psychic, I can’t tell you where the world will be, but I can tellyouwhat it will be. It will be a reflection of the people in it. The world is amirror. It always has been and always will be. Nothing exists in it except whatwe humans put there. For me this is a spiritual truth that takes a lot ofadjusting. I’m tempted to think that the good things that happen to me are dueto my wonderful actions, while the bad things are unfair or accidental.But I can’t deserve the good and not deserve the bad. In truth I am relating onmany levels all the time, and since life is really complicated, I have learnedto trust the reflections I see around me. Reflections don’t lie. If people stayaway from you, there’s a reason, and the reason begins with you. It’s not fate;it’s not those horrible kids who are such losers and snobs. If you lose threejobs in a row, there’s a reason, and it begins with you. It’s not that awfulboss and the impossible working conditions.CAN YOU SEE YOUR REFLECTIONS?Now, some people heartily disagree with this view. They don’t see anyreflections. They are right and the world is just unfair. Life itself is unfair.You can take that position and try to live it. We all have an ego. We’d all liketo be right all the time. The harder road by far is to look honestly at thereflections you’re getting. Here are some hard things that some young peoplesuddenly realized:I always thought my dad was awful, very mean and unfair. Then one day I went toa meeting where he was in charge. He really got people to pay attention, andthey voted for the things he wanted. It was really surprising to see him in thatrole. I had to ask myself why he didn’t treat me that way and whether part ofthe problem was me.I am outgoing and speak my mind. I think of myself as cheerful, but other kidssay I am stuck up and unapproachable. That never made sense. Then I saw avideotape of a birthday party where someone filmed me without my knowing it. Isaw myself looking down my nose and sometimes saying really sharp things. I hadthought they were funny, but they weren’t. This was a wake-up call for me tochange. I totally hadn’t seen what others saw so easily.I was watching TV with some friends, and we were just hanging out. Then I wentinto the other room for a few minutes. I heard them all laughing and soundingvery loose and happy. Then it hit me: They weren’t like that when I was there. Iasked myself if anyone ever laughed and relaxed around me, and I didn’t like theanswer I was getting. I think I have to loosen up.WHAT IS KARMA?In India the idea that the world is a mirror is known as karma.Karma has manymeanings. Basically the word just means “action” in Sanskrit. But karma is aspecial kind of action, the kind that balances out the good and bad of ourlives. In other words, karma carries out the maxim that what you sow, so shallyou reap. I don’t want you to adopt this new word, but I would like you toconsider that if the idea of “Good brings good, and bad brings bad” has existedfor thousands of years—not just in India, but in every culture—maybe there’ssomething to it. The world is not just a mirror, but a karmic mirror. It showsyou where you need to do more good by bringing bad reflections.This is a deep topic, and there is lots of controversy around it. Some peopleare dead set in believing that they are victims who deserve nothing bad thatever happens to them. Some people accept the scientific tenet that the world isa place of random actions that have nothing to do with good and bad. You willhave to keep thinking about that for your whole life. I can speak only assomeone who has tried to learn a lesson from every bad reflection, turning itinward to see where I could be better. I don’t make karma a heavy thing. Icertainly don’t use it to say, “Oh, I deserve all this bad stuff that is comingmy way.” I’d call that attitude passive and fatalistic. Instead, I look in themirror every day, and frankly, although I don’t always like what I see there, Itry to have the character to admit that what I see is true. There I am, wartsand all. The good news is that I can work to change every reflection. Karmaisn’t a cage that shuts you in. It’s a clue to where the key is that lets youout.Follow Your HeartQ: What do you think about interracial dating?A: I think that the person you want to be with is the person you want to bewith. Two forces are always at work here. One force brings people into closerconnection. The other force tries to keep people apart. Usually the second forcehas a lot of anger and prejudice on its side. The teen who asked this questioninformed me that his parents had strong religious convictions that made it wrongto date someone from another race. Well, there used to be religious reasons notto dance or listen to music, not to let women out of the house, not to have sexexcept to procreate children, and so forth. Supposedly those rules came fromGod, and yet somehow in almost every modern society they were allowed to change.The level of ignorance in this world is sometimes helped by religion andsometimes not. You have to use your own heart to decide. I’d say that if youside with the first force, the one that brings people into closer connection,you will have a happier time personally, and you will be riding the wave of thefuture.Liking EverybodyQ: Do you like everyone you work with?A: My answer is yes, the people I work with are all wonderful, but you don’thave to like everybody. You can’t expect to blend perfectly with every personyou meet in life. However, you can give everyone the benefit of the doubt. We’reall connected, and if you decide too rashly on whom to like, you areautomatically disconnecting yourself. That’s never a good idea. You will missout on a lot, and you will never see how much each person has to offer. At thesoul level you are saying yes to everybody. Try to see the positive in eachperson so that you can get closer to the reality of your soul. Don’t fake it anddon’t strain. The great Indian saint Sri Ramakrishna was asked if he loved everyperson he ever met, including all the bad people and rough customers. He wiselyreplied, “I know that everyone is my brother and should be loved like a brother.But some brothers I can love from a distance.”The Problem with ParentsQ: Why are my parents so crazy?A: An excellent question. It has been asked by every breathing child at somepoint in his or her life. The reason parents are so crazy is that they aren’tyou. You have crossed over the line where you easily blend into your parents’lives, and that is as it should be. You will always be connected to yourparents. Even if you run away from home or get so mad that you never speak tothem again or wind up losing your parents too early, that connection is forever.It was forged invisibly by the thousands of hours that you paid attention tothem and they paid attention to you.So, what is the right connection that will make you happy and them less crazy?HOW TO TAME A WILDPARENTDo not give them reason to worrySee things from their point of viewGive them the benefit of the doubtMake housework a little easierBe responsible for your own scheduleTake care of your healthMake a few sacrifices of time and effortShow that you care about the sacrifices they’ve made for youTAKING CAREI think I have at least one simple answer: Start to take care of each other. Youare moving past the age of needing them to take care of you. Independence is onyour mind and grows stronger every day. Well, independent people take care ofothers. They don’t shoot off into isolation, thinking only of themselves. Haveyou thought about showing your independence by taking care of your parents? Thismeans all kinds of things, like those listed in the sidebar “How to Tame a WildParent.”I bet you’ve never heard anyone suggest that teenagers should begin to take careof their parents. I think that’s because we all think in terms of materialthings like money and food and a roof over your head. Your parents don’t needthose things from you. But at the soul level you are equal. It’s only during theearly years that adults must act out the part of being in charge. We have to bestrong and responsible because that’s how children are raised. But at a certainpoint equality returns. You will one day look at your parents from the samelevel. It’s a wonderful change, a kind of growth that brings a new kind of loveand respect into the family. I don’t want you to jump the gun. Enjoy being ateenager; let your parents take care of you as much as they want and you cantolerate. But realize too that you are an equal soul. You can begin to live thatrealization by taking care of them a little. That’s how two souls show love foreach other, by sharing the same soul journey together. Which, if you think aboutit, is exactly what you and your parents have been doing since the day you wereborn.The Golden Rule of FriendshipQ: I was really attracted to this one girl at school, and now we’ve started tohang out. But all her other friends seem to have a lot more money than me. Theyspend hours shopping, and there’s no way I could afford to do that. I know thatthey judge everyone by how much money they have. What should I do?A: There’s a golden rule of friendship, which is equality. At the soul level weare all equal. Being a friend means getting close to someone’s soul, and twofriends need to feel that they are equal. Otherwise the sense of inequality willalways create tension. In your case, you don’t want to be friends with everyonethis girl knows. You just want to be friends with her. So when you feel themoment is right, take her aside and say you’re not that interested in shopping.Don’t bring up money or how embarrassed you feel about not being able to keep upwith her crowd. Make this girl your personal friend based on things you canshare as equals.You’ll never have enough money to impress people who judge others only by howwell off they are. It’s not possible to share your soul with people who are thatsuperficial. Do your best to ignore their attitude and concentrate on yourfriend. If it turns out that she is too much like them and judges others by howmuch they spend, then she is the one who hasn’t followed the golden rule offriendship. That would be sad, but it’s not your responsibility. Yourresponsibility is to follow the golden rule yourself.Hard Time Making FriendsQ: I have a hard time making friends. What should I do?A: Making friends is harder now than it used to be. Many families move severaltimes while their children are still young. Few of us grow up in a small townwhere everybody knows everybody else. And it’s said that schools are moredivided than ever into cliques. What all this means is that you can’t takefriends for granted. You have to focus your attention on making a friend insteadof just waiting for one to come along.So, how do you do that? How do you make a stranger into a friend? Here are sometried-and-true behaviors that seem to work:Listen more than you speak.Notice someone’s good points and mention them.Show that you admire the other person.Accept who the other person is.Be kind and thoughtful.Anticipate something the other person might like and then offer it.I realize that there is one big drawback to all of these points: You actuallyhave to know the person at least a little bit before you can use any of them.And for most kids that’s the toughest part—getting to know someone who couldreject you, no matter how nice you are or how friendly you act. Just know thatyou aren’t alone in feeling uncomfortable during those first moments of sayinghello. There are no magical ways to skirt the awkwardness that might arise.KEEP IT SIMPLEIn a way nothing beats simplicity. Walk right up and say, “I’d like to befriends.” If you are afraid that this is too bold for you, then think of anatural compliment that will open the conversation, such as noticing somethingabout how the person is dressed. Saying “That’s a cool haircut” or “Where didyou get that cool bike?” immediately shows that you admire that person. Don’t dothe opposite and talk about yourself first. Too often we are tempted to saythings like “I have that same bike” or “I got that same shirt last week.”Putting yourself first in the conversation is usually an automatic turnoff.You’re asking someone else to admire you, but it won’t work until they reallyhave a good reason to.I believe in the direct approach to making new friends, but you risk beingrejected that way. Fear of rejection is probably the number one reasonteenagers—and most adults—would rather be safe alone than risk the chance ofbeing humiliated. And it only takes being burned once—having someone turn theirback and walk away as if you are an insect they almost stepped on—to feel veryscared from that moment on. Once burned, twice shy, as the saying goes.So here are a few thoughts to help you bolster yourself for that awkward firstmoment.BOOSTING YOUR CONFIDENCEOther kids are just as shy and self-conscious as you are, even if they don’tshow it.Anyone who rejects you isn’t likely to turn into much of a friend.You have a lot to offer. If someone doesn’t want to be a friend, it’s theirloss.The worst you can imagine almost never happens. It’s just an energy of fear, andfear isn’t always right, no matter how convincing it is.There’s so much to learn from each of these sentences that you will be able tospend a lifetime and never really run out of lessons. But for now just use themas simple reminders. You are not alone. Everyone wants friends, and everyonefinds it hard to make them.Not Good EnoughQ: I am so self-conscious that the people I want to make friends with scare methe most. I reject myself in advance. What can I do?A: Why do you reject yourself? Almost always it’s because you see yourselfthrough someone else’s eyes. In your head you hear someone’s voice saying,“You’re not good enough,” and so you think everybody must share that opinion.But really, can anyone see themselves through anyone else’s eyes? It’s hardenough to see yourself through your own. (And believe me, everyone is looking atthemselves all the time. You aren’t alone in this.)HOW TO SEE YOURSELFHere’s a new way to see yourself. Whatever the situation, when you feel insecureor inferior or just painfully shy, tell yourself this: “I am a work inprogress.” I think that’s one of the best things you can tell yourself, becauseit’s true. Your time is coming. One day you are going to blossom. What is strongabout you is only going to get stronger. What embarrasses you or makes you feelinferior can be improved—sometimes the worst things just melt away. You couldfind yourself in a place where quiet, shy people are seen as attractive, andthen someone who really loves you may spot you sitting there, like an overlookedflower. For now just remember that nothing is finished: You are truly a work inprogress.Bursting His BubbleQ: I have this friend who sits in the back of class all day and doodles. Hedoesn’t care about grades because he says he’s going to be a rich and famouscartoonist one day. The problem is he’s no good! How can I tell him to stopthrowing away his life?A: Let’s put your question a different way. Aren’t you asking me for a pin soyou can burst your friend’s bubble? Is that a good thing to do to a friend, evenif you are right? Lots of people will be there to tell him he’s not that good.The world never runs out of critics. But a friend is different. He’s there tosupport you. If things really get out of hand—if you see him doodling all nighton a date—then sure, you might step in.But I bet you are pretty good in class, or else you wouldn’t feel so concernedabout your friend’s future. Maybe your energies would be better used to get himinterested in class. Pick the subject that you like the best and share yourenthusiasm. That’s a good way to jump-start a friend who is having a hard timefinding any inner motivation. And if your friend says, “Thanks, but no thanks,”then know you’ve done the best you can and continue to be supportive whatever hechooses to do.Being a True FriendQ: How will I know when I have found a true friend?A: A true friend is someone you can hold very close to your soul. You can tellsuch a friend by how he or she behaves in certain situations. You have to gothrough good times and bad times together. That’s also how you can tell if youare being a true friend.That means you usually can’t tell your true friends in advance. But there arethings that work to keep a friendship together that will help you out all yourlife. If I were making a list of how my best friends behaved, ten things wouldmatter the most to me.What a True Friend Is: Ten Qualitiesto Look for 1. A true friend listens to you when you need it most, not just when it’s convenient. 2. A true friend feels happy for the good things in your life, even when she doesn’t get anything for herself. 3. A true friend tells you the truth when it counts. 4. A true friend accepts who you are without judging you. 5. A true friend is someone you can tell a secret to without being afraid he will spread it around. 6. A true friend loves you even though you aren’t perfect. 7. A true friend inspires you. 8. A true friend doesn’t care what others say about you. 9. A true friend respects you. 10. A true friend lives in your heart like a part of yourself.Now, I don’t expect one person to live up to all ten of these things. If I hadten true friends and each one embodied just one of these qualities, I wouldconsider myself very blessed. Let’s look at them one at a time.1. A true friend listens to you when you need it most, not just when it’sconvenient.Parents may get impatient when their kids talk on the phone all day to theirfriends, but it’s hard to imagine teenage life without that. In societies wherethere aren’t many telephones, teens still gather around the village fountain orin the corner of the marketplace to talk and talk and talk. It’s as if our soulswant to share everything when we are young. But what about listening? I’m sureyou have friends you like very much who would rather talk than listen. But whenyou really feel sad or troubled, it’s your turn to talk and theirs to listen.Will they? Can you count on it?Bylistening I mean really taking in what you have to say. If I say to a friend,“I’m scared that I’ve done something wrong,” or, “I’m facing a tough decisionand I just don’t know what to do,” I don’t want him to reply with, “Don’t worryabout it,” or, “Let’s get a pizza. You’ll be okay.”I want him to listen.I want to know that he understands and cares about my situation. That’s how truefriends react. They don’t try to change the subject quickly. They don’t bringthe conversation back to themselves. I know that one of the hardest things inthe world is to talk about what’s really bothering you. This isn’t restricted toteens. Only the youngest children—and the most honest adults—can find thecourage to show that they have doubts and fears deep down. But we all do, andwhen the time comes to speak out your secret worries, you want someone there whowill accept what you have to say. Even if it makes him squirm. Even if it makesyou squirm. When the talk is over and you have brought your hidden worry outinto the open, you will know if you have been listened to, because you and yourfriend will feel closer than ever. And if you are fortunate and your friendreally takes your feelings to heart, you will find that a little bit of yourburden has been lifted.Just because someone listened.2. A true friend feels happy for the good things in your life, even when shedoesn’t get anything for herself.Maybe this is a subtle point, but I’ve put it high on the list. A true friendknows how to be happy for you. When you get an A on a test or make the varsityteam, her eyes shine with as much joy as yours. She doesn’t feel secretlyjealous. She doesn’t envy your happiness and wish it belonged to her instead.Your happinessis hers.The reason I put this quality high on the list is that after years of observingpeople, I think being happy for others is a rare gift. Not as rare as an extinctanimal, but rare enough. This quality is called empathy, which is likesympathy—they share the same root word—but sympathy carries a sad association.We send sympathy cards when someone dies or gets sick. Empathy is both positiveand negative. It means you are open to how others feel. People who have empathyare never alone, because in their heart they know how to bond with other people.Empathy means you never shut anyone out. You aren’t afraid of people justbecause you can feel them.In fact, youwant to feel them.See why I call this a rare gift? Do you want to feel how sad it is for someoneto lose a parent in a divorce? To feel someone who has come in last in a race orhas run out of money? These are tough things to feel. But unless you can feelother people, you will not be able to have one of the greatest joys in life,which is to bond. When you and a friend bond, it’s like having someone insideyour heart. You are so close you almost breathe the same breath—at least whenyou have those special close moments.Sharing tears and laughter is what a true friend is about. And just because itis difficult to feel someone else’s happiness when they won the race but youdidn’t, when they got the A and you got the C, I treasure any friend who feelsthat close to me.So close that my happiness is automatically theirs.3. A true friend tells you the truth when it counts.What if the worst thing someone told you was the truth? Would you walk away fromhim? Most people would. So having a friend you can be really honest with is agift. Truth has a lot of enemies, and not all of them are lies. Early on in thegame I’m sure you learned one of the tricks of making friends with someone:flattery. “Oh, you are so beautiful today. I can’t wait to see those clothes onyou. Everything you do is so cool.” Flattery isn’t like lying. You don’t exactlysay what’s false. You just learn to pick out the things that will please theother person the most. But flattery isn’t the same as telling the truth, either.Why? Because you are being selective. You are leaving out all the unpleasantthings, like picking through a box of chocolates for the best creams and leavingbehind the rest. If you have to flatter someone to be friends with him, I doubtthat you have a true friend. In fact, I can almost be sure of it. And if someoneis always playing up to you, trying to make you think you’re wonderful all thetime, I wouldn’t be sure that he can tell you the truth when you need to hearit.What kinds of things does a true friend tell you when it counts? I’m notthinking of negative things. You don’t need someone to tell you that you’re notgood enough or that people don’t like you or that your dreams are foolish andwill never come true. Those sorts of negative opinions never help anyone. Thetruth helps. That’s how I would judge what I need to hear. Does it help me tosee something I couldn’t see for myself? Imagine your best friend saying any ofthe following things to you:“You’re giving up. Keep going.”“You need me to help you, and I’m not going away until you let me.”“You’re hurting somebody else, and it has to stop.”“You’re too full of yourself.”“That’s just self-pity talking. Be brave.”These are the kinds of sentences we all have to hear at one time or another.They sting. They aren’t what we like to tell ourselves. They don’t make us feelterrific when we hear them. But if they come from a true friend, they are oftenthe truth. Not that the truth has to be negative. A true friend also knows whento say “You’re great” and “I love you, man” just when it helps you to hear thosethings. Our souls want us to live the truth, and they are constantly sending ussignals so that we can find the truth for ourselves. That’s mostly whatspiritual life is about. But when your soul isn’t getting the message across toyou, it’s your true friends who step in and do it for you.4. A true friend accepts who you are without judging you.I just said that I want a true friend to tell me the truth. But I don’t want herto put me down. In our heart of hearts we all have less than wonderful thoughtsabout other people. That includes the people we call our friends.He’s too fat.She’s not as pretty as she thinks she is. He tries to be cool, but it comes offas cocky. When you have these negative opinions, they are called judgments. Ajudgment isn’t just any negative thought. It’s a thought that makes anotherperson wrong or guilty or shameful. Strangely, many people think they are beinghelpful by voicing their negative judgments.Consider the following examples.Bad-mouthing in Disguise: “Helpful” Advice That Really Hurts“You need to work on that body of yours.”“There you go, saying all the wrong things.”“That girl/boy will never go out with someone like you.”“I heard something really mean about you.”“Some kids are saying you’re not cool.”“Don’t be so stupid next time.”“You’re better off keeping your mouth shut.”“I would never do that. What were you thinking?”Let me be very clear. If I had a friend who said these things, even jokingly,more than a few times, we would stop being friends pretty fast. And I don’t saythese things to my friends either. If you’re in doubt about the advice you wantto give, just apply the same opinion to yourself and imagine how you’d feel.Does it make you feel bad about yourself that you’re not pretty or that you’refat or that some kids talk about you behind your back? No question. So you don’tneed to deliver that news to anybody.Do you already feel afraid that you might say the wrong thing or look dumb? Ofcourse. So you don’t need to call anybody else out on that score.Would it make you feel ashamed if someone called you stupid, uncool, a badperson, a slut? I don’t have to answer that one. You already know you’re notdoing anyone a favor by repeating such things.These are all harsh judgments, and yet teens blurt them out all the time. It’sone of the most regrettable aspects of peer pressure that we try to belong byrunning others down. We try to feel big by making them look small. It neverworks, and yet because judging others is the easy way out, many people learnthis bad habit in adolescence and keep it up as adults.A true friend doesn’t judge. If you are fat, your friend accepts you. Not inspite of the fact that you are fat. Not overlooking that you are fat. Not hidingthe truth in her heart that she thinks fat is disgusting. Anyone can do thosethings, telling you, “Oh, you’re not really that fat. Everyone loves you anyway.Have another ice cream sundae. You’ll feel better.” That’s not what a truefriend does. A true friend loves you from the soul level, and at that level noneof us are victims of our worst qualities. What hurts so much about being judgedis that secretly—or not so secretly—you believe the bad things that are beingsaid. You feel ugly or dumb or ashamed. Your soul exists to tell you that thesejudgments aren’t true. Period. They are things you’ve gotten stuck in your mindlike stubborn bacteria. Each and every day your soul is trying to find ways todefeat these nasty bugs that attack the truth, which is that you are totallygood and beautiful, totally worthy to be loved. On your soul journey you willdiscover just how totally wrong your judgments have been.Take a true friend with you on this journey. You have a lot of truth and a lotof joy to share along the way.5. A true friend is someone you can tell a secret to without being afraid hewill spread it around.Gossip is a funny thing. We all know it’s wrong, but we all do it. The bestgossip, of course, is when you know a secret about someone. Then you get thethrill of telling everyone else, and for that little moment when you are inprize possession of a naughty secret, just itching to spread it around, the impof gossip has you in its power. It’s about to make you do something malicious,and even though you may live to regret it, you can’t help but give in.Gossip isn’t going away because it’s wrong. But at least my true friend won’tgossip about me. He won’t take a secret that I had the courage to share andspread it around like free five-dollar bills. He won’t make me the butt oflaughter. He won’t have fun at my expense. I think gossip is usually just a signof how bored some people are with their life. In that sense it’s harmlessenough. But at the soul level it’s not so harmless. We hurt another person’sspirit when we ridicule them or betray their feelings.Even when they aren’t there to hear us.That’s the thing most of us don’t realize. Talking behind someone else’s backhas the same power to hurt as doing it to their face. But the hurt is moreinvisible. It happens at the spiritual level. When you ridicule someone to theirface, you can immediately see the hurt you’ve caused. But just think of somebodyat school who everyone agrees is a loser. They laugh at her expense behind herback. They think it’s really funny when she messes up one more time. When yousee her in the hall, doesn’t that girl avoid your gaze or hang her head or shootyou a look that says,I know what you’re saying about me ? That’s because shedoes know. At the spiritual level we all know who is on our side and who has settheir judgment against us. We know when we’ve been hurt, even when we weren’tthere to see it.So, hard as it is to resist juicy gossip, a true friend just does. No matterwhat. And if he slips and betrays what I have told him in secret, he is braveenough to come to me and confess what he did. He knows I won’t be happy. Heknows that our friendship has been wounded for a while. But it would be a worsewound to hurt me behind my back and not tell me.6. A true friend loves you even though you aren’t perfect.“I’m not perfect, but I’m getting better.” I can’t remember where I first heardthat saying, but it’s a fine one to live by. Nobody expects you to be perfect,because it’s impossible in the first place and very hard work in the secondplace. Yet the desire to be perfect isn’t easy to give up. Some inner voicetells us we have to be perfect or we aren’t any good at all. If you have neverheard this voice, I’m glad, because many if not most young people do. Where doesthis voice come from? It comes from other people who expect a lot from you.Parents and teachers, to begin with. They apply pressure for you to succeed, andbecause you are afraid to let them down, the inner voice starts saying, “Youcan’t fail one little bit. If you do, nobody’s going to like you anymore. Youhave to be perfect.”I want one true friend who doesn’t look at me this way—not at all. This friendloves me even when I fall flat on my face. She expects me to do my best, andthat is good enough. Being perfect isn’t the same as being happy. When peoplehear this, they often don’t believe it. They think that being perfect, likebeing rich, has to equate with happiness. After all, that’s their wholemotivation. Being perfect or rich—how wonderful if you can be both!—stands forthe ideal life.A true friend is there to give you a little kick in the pants if you startthinking that way. Because perfection has this nasty little habit of becoming anaddiction. Don’t you know girls who obsess about being the perfect weight? Weall do, at every stage of life. It’s pretty easy to see that in time they willwant the perfect boyfriend, followed by the perfect college, the perfect job,the perfect husband, and, to crown everything, perfect children. What they don’tsee is that those children will feel miserable because so much pressure will beput on them. Perfect is impossible except at the soul level, and there it isn’ta matter of weight, boyfriends, jobs, husbands, or anything else in the outsideworld.Perfect at the soul level is perfect love. It’s perfect truth. It’s perfectattunement with the universe. These are inner pefections, not outer ones. Everyday your soul wants you to come closer and closer to achieving that kind ofperfection. It’s the only kind that never brings misery or stress or pressurefrom other people. All inner perfection can bring is increased joy and a moreexpanded life. I want a friend who can expand with me, who knows me from theinside and loves me from there.7. A true friend inspires you.I know it can be tough to hang around someone who is better than you at a lot ofthings. But instead of making it a competition, look at it another way. Beinspired by your friend without comparing yourself with him. Inspiration is aquality of the soul. The two wordsspirit andinspire come from the same rootword, in fact. When you are inspired by someone, you share in his spirit, and atthe same time you feed your own spirit.So find someone to look up to and become friends. You don’t have to flatter himor tell him how great he is. But do say what you find inspiring about him.Certainly that will attract his interest, because we all like to be told howgood we are. Sincere admiration is a great foundation for a friendship. Andoften you will find that the person who inspires you has another surprisingtrait: He will admire you in return. A true friend respects you and never usesyou as a foil to make himself look better. It doesn’t matter that you might notbe as pretty, smart, rich, or talented. Still your friend sees something specialin you—and that is inspiring in and of itself.8. A true friend doesn’t care what others say about you.Sometimes a friend has to be stronger than you are. It’s almost impossible to beindependent of what others think. When you hear that other kids are talkingabout you, even when you are afraid it’s bad, you still want to hear. Most ofthe time what they are saying isn’t good for your self-esteem. Gossip is aboutrunning people down behind their back. But at least your true friend can loveyou despite what anybody says. In your teenage years it’s hard to believe, butthe in crowd at school aren’t the ones who are going to be the most happy andsuccessful in life. Usually they are the ones most attached to looking good andimpressing everyone with their coolness.But what’s really behind this desire to be in? Think about it. Aren’t these thevery people who care the most about what others are thinking? If they didn’t,they wouldn’t have to try so hard. The in crowd also exists to reject those whodon’t fit in. They judge and put down other kids for no good reason except thatmaking someone else feel small or inferior makes them feel secure. Don’t befooled: There is no security in your life when you depend upon making otherslook small. You will always be resented, even if on the surface people pretendto admire you.A true friend keeps your head on straight about these things. She can say, “Coolisn’t everything. If they knew you the way I do, nobody would ever run youdown.” And these words will be sincere, because if a friend is close enough toyour soul, she can see how trivial all the social stuff really is. Have at leastone friend who can see you through the eyes of the soul, and you will beprotected—as best as anyone can be—from the social cruelty that plays such ahuge part in this time of life you are passing through.9. A true friend respects you.There are lots of reasons why kids are afraid to ask for respect. First, it’ssomething adults are always demanding in one way or another. “As long as you’rein my house, you will respect my rules.” Who hasn’t heard these words from anangry father at least once? Maybe a lot more than once. Adults talk about howrespect must be earned, which sounds intimidating. It can sound as if you haveto win a baseball game single-handedly, or save a baby from a burning house,before anyone will respect you.But respect is another quality of the soul. I would call it the “equality” ofthe soul, because for me to respect you, you don’t really have to do anythingbut show me your soul. Behind all the masks each of us is equal and deservesequal respect. If you can find a friend who knows this, you have found atreasure.Because kids don’t expect anyone to respect them, they often fall into behaviorwhere they don’t respect one another, either. You are disrespecting someone,even when you don’t mean to, by exhibiting the following behavior:Making fun of them when they are doing their bestPointing out their flawsShowing off that you have more money and nicer thingsRunning down their parents or their brothers and sistersCriticizing their faithTreating them as if their feelings don’t matterSchool is full of this kind of behavior, and I think the reason is what I’vejust mentioned: You can’t give respect when you are afraid to ask for it. Eachof us might pretend that it’s okay to hear someone rag on our little brother orboast that their father makes more money. We wince inside but pretend not towhen someone laughs at how badly we caught a football or missed an easy pitchplaying baseball. The right thing to do is not to pretend. When someone showsyou disrespect, you don’t have to call them on it. But don’t keep pretending itdidn’t happen. Either go up to them afterward and quietly point out whathappened, or if that isn’t possible, be on the lookout for those true friendswho really do respect you. They are the ones who don’t laugh at your weaknessand never boast about money.I’m sure you get the point, but there’s another thing I’d like to mention.Sometimes when you disagree with someone or call them out for good reason, theywill turn on you and say, “You’re disrespecting me.” Actually, when you knowyou’re in the right, it’s a mark of character to stand up for what you think,even if you have to disagree with somebody. It takes even more character whenthat somebody is a friend. Don’t let the worddisrespect scare you off. Truerespect isn’t about opinions. It’s not about who is right or wrong. It’s aboutequality of the soul. If you can keep that in mind, you will earn people’srespect and find it much easier to give respect in return.10. A true friend lives in your heart like a part of yourself.I left this quality for last even though you might think it should come first. Ileft it for last because this is one thing that can creep up on you. The peoplewho really live in our heart are not always easy to notice. We take them forgranted because they are always there. I hope you have the wonderful experienceof being able to take many people into your heart. It’s a rare ability becausemost people think that it’s just your family who should be given such a place.Or perhaps the person you fall in love with romantically.I think the heart is much bigger than that. It can include anyone whose soulfeels especially close. You find yourself feeling the way she feels, thinkingthe way she thinks. You can share silent moments without having to talk toomuch. And above all, you are never afraid or insecure around such a person. I’dcall these the touchstones, the telltale signs. For you’ll find that there willbe those you fall in love with who make you feel insecure and not very safe.That’s one of the peculiar things about romance, that it can make you afraidbecause you feel so open and vulnerable.Sometimes this changes, and those you love turn out to find a place in yourheart. But mostly, I find, it’s the true friends who get there first and staythere. Girls are supposed to be better at this than boys. Not because boys don’thave big hearts, but other things get in the way. Trying to look cool or acttough. Trying to be a winner. Trying to make others think you’re better than youare or turning every encounter into a competition. Boys are like that quite alot of the time. Even so, the soul doesn’t care if you are a boy or a girl. Itnaturally wants to be close to other souls, and if you let it do what it wants,there is no limit to the number of people who can live in your heart. Be on thelookout. You’ll be surprised who might belong in there after all.Soul MatesQ: Do I have a soul mate? When will I meet him?A: I sat down to answer this question when I noticed that it came from athirteen-year-old girl. I paused, trying not to be shocked. Why was someone thatyoung thinking about a soul mate already? But I quickly realized that thephrasesoul mate has become part of romantic lore, like Prince Charming. I have asoft feeling for romantic lore. I hope and believe that I am my wife’s PrinceCharming. But if you are asking me about the one and only love who is perfectlymatched to you and has traveled across the universe to find you, I don’t believein waiting for such a phenomenon.It’s a great achievement for any person to make a good match that allows bothpartners to grow. You can start now with someone you really like and feel closeto. It’s less romantic than sitting in your tower until the day a hero sweepsyou off your feet, but in truth, if you relate to everyone as an equal soul, youwill also be better off when it comes time to pick that special person who willbe your mate.Anyway, aren’t all souls a perfect match if you come right down to it?Falling in LoveQ: I have crushes all the time. Is this okay? What is the spiritual side offalling in love?A: The heart is a muscle, and like all muscles, it needs exercise. Crushes are away for the heart to feel bursts of intense joy, pain, fear, and wonder all atthe same time. That’s a kind of exercise, not physically, but emotionally. Iwould rather have too many crushes than none at all.As for the spiritual side of falling in love, I must confess that to me, fallingin love is spiritual all by itself. What’s it like to fall in love? You change,and everything around you changes. The ordinary world lights up. You feel thatyou are walking on air. The person you love is perfect in every way. The futurewill be just as perfect once you two are together forever.These perceptions don’t last, yet I think they give us a glimpse into how thesoul really feels. At the soul level there is lightness and love that changesthe world. You aren’t bound by fences on all sides, but are free. You can bewhat you want to be and do what you want to do. That feeling of power andfreedom comes with falling in love.Only, you have to turn fantasy into reality. The only problem with falling inlove is that it often turns out to be too much fantasy and not enough reality.The reality of the soul is waiting for you once you go on the spiritual journey.Let your crushes be what they are: a little taste of the soul’s reality.Falling Out of LoveQ: I am eighteen and almost married someone I deeply loved. At the last minute Ilistened to my parents, and after a few months my “true love” and I split upafter I found out he was seeing another girl. I am hurt and bitter. What isfalling out of love all about?A: I wish this were an easier question, because falling out of love doesn’t justhurt. It often brings disillusionment. When you fall in love, everything feelswonderful and perfect. There is a kind of shield that protects you from ordinaryworries and disappointments. When you fall out of love, the shield drops. Eventhough you are only returning to ordinary life, the experience feels bigger. Youfeel as if you almost touched perfection, only to lose it again.I don’t think that feeling should be trusted. Falling in love isn’t an illusion,but it’s not necessarily meant to last. As I mentioned above, this is a glimpseat the soul’s reality. As you fall out of love, that glimpse vanishes, but itwas still real, you still felt it and got to experience what it was like. Sodon’t be bitter and fight against disillusionment. Nothing wrong has happened toyou. Love is a cosmic force. Its glory awaits you and can never be lost. As younurse your hurt feelings, keep your eyes on a future in which love blossomsagain."},{"pageContent":"5GOD“DOES GOD REALLY EXIST? HOW CAN I BE SURE?”People fight over God. They always have, and it keeps on going. Here we are inso-called modern times, but the same ancient argument is still raging:My God isbetter than your God. If you don’t believe in mine, you must die. Someone oncecalculated that every year sees thirty wars around the world. Most are warsstarted about God, and even when they aren’t, the two enemies boast, “God is onour side.”It’s tragic enough that people fight over God, given that God is supposed to beabout love and forgiveness, about living together and being part of one family.But here’s an even stranger thing: Everyone seems to be getting worked up oversomebody they’ve never even met. God is invisible. He once walked in the Gardenof Eden, according to the Book of Genesis, but that was because he wanted toadmire the Paradise he had just created. Now he lives, well, somewhere else.Perhaps in heaven, perhaps in some home that is beyond time and space.FACE-TO-FACE WITH GODWouldn’t it be nice to actually meet God before starting a fight over him? Infact, wouldn’t it be right to meet God before having any strong opinion abouther? (Don’t get too comfortable calling God a he, since being part ofeverything, God is just as easily worshipped as a she. I’ll keep usinghe onlybecause that’s been the usual way for hundreds of years.)I know it’s too much to ask people to stop fighting over God right this minute.But you and everyone you know can still hope to meet God. Does that soundimpossible? In fact, God can be met in many ways that are everyday experiences.How Do I Meet God?He can be met in his creation.He can be met in your heart.He can be met in your mind.He can be met in love for other people.He can be met in your being.If you begin to notice each encounter you have with God, over time you will meetGod more often and more deeply. One day you will have a truly close encounter,one that will change your life.It all begins by being awake to those small moments when spirit is close,because spirit is God. Get yourself a blank notebook or diary. This is whatyou’ll use to record all your encounters. You might want to title it “CloseEncounters” or “My Time with God.”Now, for the next thirty days be on the lookout for anything that fits the listI just gave.Meeting God in His CreationExamples“Today I saw a beautiful sunset that took my breath away. I was out walking andmy eyes soared up to a towering white cloud—it was glorious.”“This evening I walked out and looked at the stars. My mind was filled withwonder to think about them and the infinity that lies beyond the stars.”Meeting God in Your HeartExamples“Today I was alone and felt really at peace. The world is okay and so am I.”“I was in the woods today and felt that I was totally one with nature—I wish Icould feel that every day.”“I began to feel that I might be able to love a higher power, just because I amso grateful for being here.”Meeting God in Your MindExamples“Today I looked at a rose, and it was so incredibly beautiful I wanted to knowwhat kind of mind could create such a thing.”“I thought of somebody’s name and the next minute they called me on the phone—Ifelt a shiver, as if the universe had read my mind.”“I closed my eyes and tried to imagine infinity. I didn’t get there, but Ialmost felt I touched it.”Meeting God in Love for Other PeopleExamples“I was amazed today at how much I love ____________.”“I think he/she is a beautiful soul.”“I noticed today that when someone is asleep, no matter who they are, they lookpure, for just a moment like an angel.”“I saw a stranger on the street, and all at once I felt I could love that personif we knew each other.”Meeting God in Your BeingExamples“Today for just a moment I realized that I belong and my life matters. I saw myuniqueness.”“Today I felt that my life is a privilege to live. I could be really exceptionalin some way.”“Today felt like the best time to be alive.”These are just a few samples to get you started. Notice that none of them usethe wordGod. You don’t have to; you only have to be personal and true to yourfeelings. That isn’t always easy. Boys in particular might not feel comfortableif their buddies thought they were writing down sissy things about gloriousclouds and loving life. But we all have these moments, and this diary of yourclose encounters with spirit is just for you. I can promise you that if youactually give this experiment a chance, your spirit will open up amazingly inthirty days—you won’t be the same person. Your appreciation of your ownexistence will begin to blossom, and once it’s started, there is no end to thatprocess.Now we’re going to take the radical step of inviting God to return to Earth andnot stay so far away. There’s no Garden of Eden for him to walk in, but myapproach isn’t religious anyway. We’ve already touched on the need to bespiritual without feeling that you have to obey a certain religion and followits beliefs to the letter. If you respect every religion, you have taken a steptoward peace. I think God loves peace more than any other quality of spirit, sothat’s a really good start. We’re off to actually find God by searching for himat the soul level—the biggest treasure hunt ever conceived and the only tripthat deserves to be called cosmic.So let’s get right down to it.Looking for GodQ: I know that some people spend all their life trying to find God. How doesthat work? Do I just pray and wait?A: It’s more than prayer and it’s more than waiting. First you have to decidewhether God is outside yourself. A God who is outside yourself would bedifferent from one who is inside. Of course, we all have been taught that it’s alittle of both. When you read poetry likeGod’s in his heaven—All’s right with the worldalmost automatically you see an image of a person, “God,” living in a place,“heaven,” that isn’t inside you. When people pray, they send their prayers toGod, so again it’s almost automatic to think of your prayer being like a letteryou send in the mail.Yet when you think about feeling God’s love, that feeling must occur inside you.The same goes for God’s peace and comfort. So should you look for God bothinside and outside? For thousands of years people have done both. In fact, justas you go somewhere on summer vacation, the faithful once spent vast amounts ofmoney and time to go to sacred places where God supposedly lived (in some partsof the world they still do). Pilgrims sought out holy temples or places ofancient power that were said to be special to God. Once they got there, theyexpected an inner experience that would validate that God’s presence wasactually to be found at the end of the trail.GOD IS A JOURNEYYou can seek God in this way if you wish. But I think the inward journey to findGod is the same as the outward journey, and it doesn’t require you to leavehome. The inward journey is the same as seeking your soul. In other words, youare really seeking a part of yourself. But unlike your hand, which you don’thave to seek because it’s just there in plain sight, or your mind, which youdon’t have to seek because you have thoughts all the time, your soul liesbeyond. Beyond what? Beyond the everyday activity of the world. If you are goingto find God, you have to find a way to see past all the things that life throwsat you day in and day out. Here’s how to do that.LEARNING FROM THE RIVERImagine that your life is like a river flowing very fast on the surface. Thatwould stand for all the actions that take up your time every day. From themoment you first open your eyes in the morning, you greet a world full of sightsand sounds. Other people want you to do all kinds of things. Your mind jumpsinto all this activity and rushes along with it.But just beneath the surface a river runs quieter and more slowly. You are likethat too. Beneath all the jumble of activity your mind is not so active. I’msure you’ve noticed this, although maybe you haven’t paid all that muchattention to what lies beneath the surface. You may not have noticed, forexample, those moments of peace that come when you are lying on your back in thegrass just staring at clouds, or when you drowsily begin to fall asleep, or whenyou are suddenly struck by how beautiful a sunset is. But the mind does pausefor a second and experience a bit more stillness then.At the very bottom a river flows very, very slowly. You are like that also,because if you go inward seeking God, you can learn to dive into the silence andtotal stillness of your mind. Now you are truly going beyond. You are takingseriously the great saying “Be still, and know that I am God.” What is at thevery bottom of a river? Bedrock, the support that holds the whole rivertogether. The bedrock doesn’t flow at all, yet without it the river wouldn’texist.Likewise, to find God, you must dive down to the bedrock of your own self.There, at the source, you will discover something amazing. As you encounter yourown soul, God will show up in the outer world. Your five senses will wake up toa presence that is behind everything, and that presence is alive, intelligent,and full of love.But What Do I Do?Q: I can understand your image of the river, but in practical terms what do Ido?A: If you think about it, there are only four things you can do:You can think.You can feel.You can act.You can be.These four things aren’t special or exotic. You do them every moment of the day.If I had a video camera mounted on your shoulder to follow you from the momentyou woke up to the moment you went to bed, it would discover you eitherthinking, feeling, acting, or being. You can’t escape these basic aspects ofbeing alive. (We’re assuming here that the video camera is special and can lookinside to watch you think.) Finding God turns on these four things. So the toolsyou need have always been part of your life.TURNING YOUR THOUGHTS TOWARD GODThere are lots of ways to do this. You can read about God in scriptures andother writings devoted to God. You can set a few moments aside to contemplateGod. You can pray. All of these are valid ways that people have used to turntheir thoughts away from the outside world, directing them toward the world ofGod. The two are the same world, but you are putting your attention on the fineraspects of creation. If you play baseball after school, your thoughts will be onthe game, but you might look up while standing in the outfield and notice howbeautiful the evening sky is. That’s a finer aspect of creation. These fineraspects are everywhere, waiting to be noticed. And although this may soundstrange, when you notice them, they notice you back. There’s an intelligencethat looks back at us when we look in its direction. When you begin to sensethis silent observer, your mind is beginning to notice God.TURNING YOUR FEELINGS TOWARD GODJust as you have finer thoughts, you also have finer feelings. For example, whenyou want to stay on the phone and talk to your friends, but your mother wantsyou to get off the phone and do your schoolwork, what do you feel? Irritated,impatient, put upon. Maybe a little stressed or frustrated. Those are typicalfeelings when we don’t get to do what we want to do. But at other moments youmight stop to notice how much love there is in your mother’s eyes or howpeaceful she looks. Those are finer feelings. All they require is payingattention. You can walk past a garden without noticing it, or you can stop andreally look. When you really look, your feelings shift.Ah, it’s beautiful. Thesame thing often happens looking at photographs of people from around the world.Someone who has no meaning to you except as a stranger or a foreigner (perhaps,alas, even an enemy) turns out to be just like you. A look in the eyes capturesyour attention, and suddenly you have a finer feeling. If you keep noticingthese finer feelings, you will discover a layer of emotion inside yourself thatdoesn’t care about differences. You begin to experience love for all of life, areverence for creation, and a special feeling of belonging. In this way youremotions have turned toward God.TURNING YOUR ACTIONS TOWARD GODWe all know that there are good actions and bad actions, selfish actions andaltruistic actions. For a long, long time people have felt that good actions arecloser to God, along with selfless or altruistic actions. Children are taughtthat it is better to give than to receive. They are taught to do volunteer workand to help those less fortunate than themselves. But in my mind action goesfurther than that. To really turn your action toward God, you have to complete acircle, and here’s what I mean by that.If someone surprises you with a small gift you weren’t expecting, you can muttera small, embarrassed thanks and walk away. Or you can return that gift with realthanks from your heart, meeting the person’s eyes and letting them see that youwere really touched. The first reaction breaks the circle, the second reactioncompletes the circle. That’s one example. You can find yourself getting a littleextra money. What do you do with it? You can hoard it away, intending to spendit all on yourself. Or you could give a bit of money to someone who has less.The first action breaks the circle, the second completes it. This second examplemay not seem so clear, however. What kind of circle are you completing by givingmoney to someone less fortunate?Here the second action is returning something to the source. Any time you give,you are saying, “I know this money came from God, and in thanks I am returningsome of it to the source.” It doesn’t have to be money—you can return a kindgesture, a favor, a compliment. Anything, really. Everything that comes your waymust have a source. I’m not saying you have to call this source God. You couldbe saying, “Everything comes from the universe and goes back to it. I want toshow that I understand this.” Whatever words you use, you are acknowledging thatthere is a source that gives, and when you give back, you are closing the circleof creation. Being kind to a young child closes the circle because you areshowing reverence to the time when you were a child. Being kind to older peopleshows reverence to the old age that will one day greet you. When your actionsclose the circle, you have turned them toward God.TURNING YOUR BEING TOWARD GODTo be is simple but deep. It’s simple because everyone exists. You don’t have todo anything to be. You don’t have to feel anything to be. You don’t have tothink anything to be. You just are. But existence is also deep. What makes itdeep? Your being is connected to awareness. Unlike a rock, which just sitsthere, you can say, “I am.” There’s no simpler phrase in any language, and yetIam contains a lot. It contains a sense of belonging. It contains a sense thatyou are where you should be. It contains a sense of alertness and observation.Iam is your connection to life itself.Some of these things may sound foreign to how you are living right now, but Iimagine that quite a few sound familiar. Some teens are already very alert. Theylook around with eagerness; they rush into the unknown, wanting to findeverything there is to find. Other teens (like people in general) are sleepier,dull, not curious. They rarely observe anything new. This isn’t a criticism; Ijust want to give you a very clear choice of how to participate. You can be asalert and alive as possible, or you can sleepwalk your way through the wholething. I’m not saying that your choice is to worship God or not. Just think backon that comment from Einstein, that there are only two ways to live: Eithernothing is a miracle, or everything is a miracle. When you live as if everythingis a miracle, you have turned your being toward God.Where Is God?Q: Where does God live? I mean, if he lives in heaven, where is that located,somewhere in the sky?A: God can’t have an ordinary home with an address, even in the sky, because heis everywhere. If everywhere is his address, that changes a lot of how we thinkabout him. Imagine yourself about to get into a fight. Just as you are about tounleash some nasty words or cock back your fist, your mind says,God iseverywhere. He is even in this guy I am about to fight with. That would bestrange, wouldn’t it? What if you were watching TV and the news showed a convictbeing led off to prison? There he is in his orange jumpsuit, head hanging downand wrists handcuffed behind his back. Suddenly your mind says,God iseverywhere. He is in this abject criminal. That would be strange too.Because the minute you really take seriously that God is everywhere, somethinghappens. You can’t pretend he is somewhere else. In other words, you can’t say,“I hate this guy I’m about to fight with, so God isn’t in him.” You can’t say,“That criminal robbed somebody, so God isn’t in him.” None of us has the abilityto say where God is and where he isn’t. The truth is that God, being cosmic,hasto be everywhere. He has no choice, and neither do we.It makes you think, doesn’t it? If each person paused for even five minutes aday to think this one thought—God is everywhere—ordinary life would never be thesame again. If you want to go deeply into it, here’s the next question that popsup:Where is everywhere?LOOKING EVERYWHERE FOR GODFirst, there’s the everywhere you can’t see. It is invisible and totally beyondthe five senses. This is because it’s not part of physical creation. Thestrongest radio telescope looking to the farthest reaches of the universe wouldnever be able to locate this place. It has no physical existence, even as afaint vibration. It uses no energy at all. Therefore, it has been called purebeing, because it exists without using matter or energy. The phrasepurepotential can also be used for this aspect of God. It’s the ability to createbefore anything is actually created. This may sound strange, but refer back toyourself. You have the ability to create sentences even when you aren’t sayinganything. God is that same potential—silent and unseen—on an infinite scale.That’s the first way of thinking about where God is.Second, there’s the everywhere that isalmost in the physical world, just shy ofbeing seen. This location, which sounds a bit like a ghost, has been called thesubtle world. It’s the world of images, thoughts, and inspiration. But alsolocated here are myths and dreams and wishes. The seeds of the future areplanted here.When we say that someone has a vision of possibilities, the subtle world is thesource of the vision. For many centuries the subtle world has been consideredthe home of God and the angels (also the devil and his demons). To me it is thezone of miracles, a place where physical boundaries disappear and rules ofexistence can be bent. When you hear about God sitting on his throne in heaven,that image comes from the subtle world.That’s the second way of thinking about where God is.Third, there’s the everywhere you are familiar with already, the infiniteexpanse of the universe. Here the five senses bring us all our information, andeven though God cannot be seen, what we can observe is the incredible order andbeauty of creation. That orderliness implies a creator. Therefore, it’s just asaccurate to say that God exists here as it is to say he exists in heaven or inthe realm of pure being.That’s the third way of thinking about where God is.Everywherehas three locations, and so does God. Of course, what would be evenmore fascinating is the possibility that you might also be living in all threeplaces. I think you are. You don’t have to wait to go to heaven to realize thatyou are already living with God, in the exact place where he is. Or rather, theexact three places.How Do You Know?Q: How do you personally know that God is real?A: As a doctor, I have a background in science. I learned something that holdstrue in any field of science, which is that nature is more powerful at theinvisible level. It took medicine more than two thousand years to discover thatinvisible organisms called germs could create disease—before that, it waspossible to believe that illness was carried into a house on the wind (thewordmalaria comes from the Italian for “bad air,” as if this disease wereactually caused by a certain kind of air).GOD’S INVISIBLE WORLDTo get even more basic, you can’t see an atom through a microscope, yet atremendous amount of power is contained in a single atom. I also learned thatnature is organized from an invisible level. You can’t see what holds your bodytogether, yet if some invisible force did not, your cells would fly apart intospace as a cloud of energy.I come from India, where this invisible region has been pondered for thousandsof years, an amazing thing when you consider that there were no microscopes.Nevertheless, the ancient sages and teachers wanted to know what existed beyondthe visible world. Who was it that controlled all this power and organization?The ancient ones were like detectives into the invisible. How do you become adetective when you can’t even see your clues? You go inside yourself. After all,you can’t see a thought or a feeling, but you know that these are real.The ancient ones went even deeper than thought. They decided that if you can seeGod, you haven’t found him yet. If you can think about God, you haven’t foundhim yet. If you can imagine God, you haven’t found him yet. (See what an amazingjourney this must have been? Because most people are satisfied to think aboutGod and imagine what he must be like.)Eventually what they found was the invisible region inside themselves. And therewas God, not as a person or a feeling or a thought, but as power itself,creativity itself, reality itself. This is hard to understand unless you go onthe journey personally—which I hope you will do. That’s what this book has beenall about, looking beyond the surface of life to find the infinite power andintelligence that lies beyond. You don’t have to finish the whole journey tofind God. The ancient ones, who spent generations on their detective hunt,didn’t find all of God themselves. But they discovered what God is made of, andyou can too. By understanding what science already knows, and by taking aspiritual journey into yourself, you can prove that God exists personally. Theversion of God that you find will be your own. Nobody else has to agree. You bethe detective and follow your own clues.Needing GodQ: I have a friend who got very sick. I prayed for him every day, but he isn’tbetter. This makes me wonder: Who needs God if he doesn’t answer our prayers?A: Let me thank you for the honesty of your question. Deep down we all getdisappointed when our prayers aren’t answered. We are told that God works inmysterious ways, but once you feel let down, it’s easy to begin to lose faith inGod.But I don’t believe in a God who is real only if he brings me what I want. Afterall, God isn’t supposed to be a vending machine that grants wishes every time Islip in a prayer. God exists to fulfill needs that no one can fulfill in anyother way. Here are just a few.TO INSPIRE YOUWhat inspires you? I mean really deep down. A painting that is so powerful youcould cry or laugh for joy just looking at it? Maybe music works that way foryou, or a person who has touched your heart. Life would be unbearably dull andflat if we didn’t, each in our own way, look for inspiration. In every part ofthe world the most beautiful objects created by man were made to praise God. Ifyou travel to Europe and stand in front of a French cathedral, you are seeing amonument to God that took hundreds of people to build. Often three generationswould devote their entire working lives to the project.Many times in building a cathedral disaster would strike. Roofs collapsed,killing everyone underneath. Fires broke out and destroyed decades of work. Theplague might wipe out half the workers in one summer. But nothing could stop awhole town from erecting a shrine to faith. Their purpose wasn’t to obtain moneyor success, but to build a house worthy of God’s majesty, which was the samepurpose, thousands of years before, behind building the Great Pyramid at Giza inEgypt, the largest man-made structure on Earth for more than three thousandyears. In both cases a whole society was inspired by an idea. Call the ideaeternity or infinity or almighty power, it was part of how they saw God.Now, you aren’t called upon to build a cathedral, probably not even a church,but God inspires more than art. He inspires people to be good, to rise abovethemselves, to look upon other human beings as equals. You can be inspired byyour own spirit. Just ask yourself, “What am I inspired to do?” You will get afeeling close to your heart. It will lead you to something a lot more beautifulthan you ever thought you could achieve: singing from your heart, painting apicture that expresses who you are, writing a poem, reaching out in kindness.But you could also be inspired to make the varsity team or invent a new dessert.Any inspiration is an inspiration from God in the end. God and spirit are thesame, and both want one thing only: expansion of your heart so that you feel thejoy of life.TO BRING INNER PEACEThe need for inner peace is greater than ever. A generation ago I doubt I wouldhave been talking to a young person about inner peace. Things have changed,however, to bring much more stress at a younger age, so that even grade schoolkids worry about the world and their future in it.What do you do when you are really worried? You can try to escape, but withoutpeace your worries and stress return very quickly. It’s like running into amovie house to get out of the rain, only to discover that the rain hasn’tstopped when the movie is over. The same is true of your inner storms. The onlysolution is to find a place inside yourself that is always peaceful.This is the peace of the soul. If you have ever learned about meditation, youknow that it’s a way of finding one’s inner peace. I’ve started lots of teensmeditating, and they often say it’s not easy at first: “Wow, I never knew it wasso noisy in my head.” “I felt so jumpy I could hardly keep my eyes open.” “Icould feel all these thoughts buzzing around my head.” These are typicalcomments at first. But without exception, each person eventually found the placeof peace that is inside everyone. Once they did, they really liked it. Thecomments changed: “I touched the silence.” “I felt something really special I’venever felt before—I was totally relaxed.” “I closed my eyes and twenty minutesflew by so fast I thought it was five minutes.”This quiet place is covered over by thoughts and feelings that rush through themind. In meditation you don’t stop those thoughts and feelings, but you ask tobe taken to a deeper place in yourself. Only in the place of peace can a persontruly commune with God and with the soul. But even getting a bit closer to thesoul brings a measure of peace, and you know it’s real because it lasts.TO LISTEN TO YOUR SOULAs a boy, I remember being really jealous of the Old Testament prophets who gotthe word directly from God. I dreamed about hearing God’s voice from the burningbush, like Moses. In my mind’s eye I was walking with Athena, the Greek goddessof wisdom, at the battle of Troy, the way Achilles did. Then I grew up, and Ifound out that getting instructions from God, although it sounds great, doesn’thappen too often. I’m not sure anymore what people mean by “the voice of God.”Maybe it’s just their conscience talking. Maybe it’s a soothing voice they wishthey could hear, and so they do.But I am sure that spirit communicates with us. I would not personally call thisspeaking to God. I like the termtuning in to your soul better. The voice youhear is your own, but it comes from a deeper place than other voices. Most ofthe voices we hear in our head are echoes of things our parents told us, or oldthoughts from the past that keep coming back: “You better not dothat again.”“Remember what happened the last time.” “Uh-oh, here comes temptation.”The voice of your soul isn’t the same old thing. It is alwaysnow. It gives you afresh impulse to do something: “Oh, I never thought of that.” “Do you see what Isee?” “I really want to check that out.” These don’t seem like religious or holythoughts. The soul doesn’t have to sound like God speaking from a burning bush.It mostly isn’t, at least not when I tune in. My soul is more interested ingiving me a fresh start every day, in making my life new. Keeping it from beingstale.Instead of echoing the past, your soul wants you to feel alive right now, readyto try something new or feel something new.Why not run for class president? Or try out for the cheerleading squad? Or jointhe debating team?Listen to that song you love! Why not write your own?Look at that gorgeous sunset! Why not take a really good photograph of it anddevelop the photo yourself?Everyone has experienced what it’s like to be bored by the same old things. Youget up in the morning to the same breakfast, the same family, the sametoothbrush. Yet there is a way that each day is fresh, or should be, as long asyou tune in, because in truth every dayis different. No two days are completelythe same, and what makes them different is that you get new opportunities eachday.If you can see each day anew, you are tuned in to your soul. One could also callthis having a telephone line to God, because God is the source of these newthings that life brings us. To me, if you can see something new in the face of aperson you love, or see the sunrise as new, or greet the day as if a whole newworld is being born, you are listening to your soul. “Hearing God’s voice” isanother way of saying the same thing.TO PROVIDE HIGHER VALUESYou’ve probably heard of Mother Teresa, the famous Catholic nun who traveledfrom Europe to India so that she could care for sick and starving children thatnobody else wanted. Mother Teresa won the Nobel Peace Prize, but there’s onething most people don’t know about this world-famous figure. A psychologyprofessor once showed a film of her kissing and caring for babies, and everyonein the audience who watched the film experienced a physical change. Their immunesystem, the system that fights off illness, got stronger on the spot—within afew minutes a chemical called IgA increased in their bodies. Not that you needto know what IgA is. The point is that just looking at love in action makes yourbody stronger, less vulnerable to disease.I find this amazing, all the more so because the people in the audience didn’teven have to like Mother Teresa. Their bodies responded regardless of theiropinions about her. The kind of love she displayed has been focused on God forcenturies. God gives us the strength to act on our highest values. Love is one,but so are honor and truth and faith in goodness.A soul is like a ship carrying precious cargo. But this cargo is invisiblebecause it’s your values, the things you live by. Here we are talking aboutreally personal values. If you know that good is more powerful than evil, you’vefound a soul value. If you know that you will never die, that is another soulvalue. One of the most important reasons for being alive is to explore your ownsoul and discover these things for yourself. I would rather know in my heart ofhearts that eternity is real than to read it from a great wise man.God is where these soul values come from. I once read this wonderful sentence:“To be truly human, you have to go beyond the human.” You’re not going to getthere by doing what everybody else does and only seeing what you’re supposed tosee. Look at your little brother slurping milk out of his cereal bowl. Can yousee that he is totally unique in the universe?WHAT THE SOUL CAN SEELook at your teacher scribbling words on the blackboard. Can you see that a soulis working out its deepest hopes and wishes?Look at your coach shouting to get you to run downfield faster. Can you see thathe is on the mysterious voyage of eternity?I know all this sounds mystical, but it’s also true. You see different thingswhen you look through the eyes of the soul. The whole adventure of having a soulis to get beneath the surface. People try to be good because they think itbrings them closer to God. I feel closer to God when I say to myself, “Open youreyes! There’s a world you never imagined out there.”If God makes you want to live your vision, then he’s doing his job. A spiritualvision of life might be one of the following: * To feel God’s presence personally * To be united with God * To feel what eternal love is like * To live fully in the moment * To find more beauty in the world every day * To uncover a new truth every day * To know yourself * To touch the edge of eternity * To be a child of the universeThis isn’t just a hypothetical list. These are phrases young people actuallytell me. For each of these visions, I know at least one teenager who is tryingto live it out. And in every case I would call that person someone who has foundthe secret of happiness. Not just happiness for a day or a month, or happinessthat lasts as long as everything is going your way, but deep happiness thatsatisfies the soul.“Give Me Faith”Q: How do you get faith? I have born-again friends who tell me all the time thattheir life is “faith based.” What do they mean?A: Faith is spiritual certainty. I think you’re afraid you don’t have enough ofit because your friends seem to have more. Don’t be discouraged. Faith doesn’tcome from never missing church. You don’t need God to begin to have faith. Doyou have faith that the sun will come up tomorrow? That gravity will still work?That your body will be healthy and sound? These are matters of faith that havenothing to do with spirit. They are more like trust. You trust your house to bethere when you come home from school, but no one would say that this makes you aperson of faith.Faith goes beyond visible things. When you have trust in something you can’tsee, you are getting closer to faith. The most powerful electron microscopecan’t see electrons or quarks, but the mind knows they exist. Keep an open mind.Look for those moments when your trust in God or goodness or doing the rightthing works out. That’s how faith begins to grow.But I don’t want you to plunge into blind faith. Blind faith is stubborncertainty. Some people settle the whole question of faith in about ten minutesby saying, “I know God exists because that’s what my religion says. The matteris closed.” I would consider that a perfect example of blind faith. But there isa faith that opens your eyes, and that is the kind that God values most. If youtake the time and look deep enough, I believe that all of the following wouldprove to be true:Good is more powerful than evil.All human beings are spiritual.Intelligence has organized the universe.The greatest force in nature is growth.Infinite possibilities are always present.Eternity can be found right now.God is love.Now, these are huge statements. Without exaggeration, it could take a lifetimeto prove that they are true. Look upon them as articles of faith. You canbelieve in them and live them in your own life, even though you haven’t totallyproved them to yourself. So try this: Pick one thing from the list, such as“Good is more powerful than evil.” Keep watch and notice all the good things inthe world, like families and the love that they show, charities, volunteer work,altruism, heroism, friendship, and so on. Keep reminding yourself of how thesegood things have continued for centuries, even as wars rise and fall, dictatorscome and go, sickness and death abound. In the balance life is winning, and it’swinning through our goodness.NEGATIVE FAITHSome people put their faith in negatives. They have faith in Murphy’s Law, forexample, which says that if something can go wrong, it will. They have faiththat life is unfair. They have faith that human behavior is basically selfish.This kind of negative faith throws a dark cloud over their days. Yet negativefaith isn’t automatically true. You can’t prove that things always go wrong orthat life is unfair or that people always act selfishly. There is too muchevidence on the other side. So why have faith in something that is unprovableand negative at the same time? In reality positive faith has endured forthousands of years, and if you remember just that one thing, I think yourproblem with faith will soon be over.How Are Miracles Chosen?Q: If God causes miracles, how does he choose who gets one?A: I imagine you’d like to have a miracle of your own. We all would. I waswatching TV a few years ago when I saw something amazing. A very sick man hadtraveled from Ireland to France, intending to bathe in the waters of a sacredhealing spring. The spring is very famous. It is located in Lourdes and has manyhealings to its credit. The man arrived late and couldn’t get in the gates,however, so he never got close to the waters that were supposed to heal him. Allhe could do was stand outside the walls and listen to the loudspeakers that werebroadcasting evening services.He went back to his hotel and lay down, feeling tired. His disease, which wasmultiple sclerosis (or MS), made him feel tired a lot of the time, and it wasgrowing worse, year by year. Eventually it would prove fatal, as MS isincurable.Suddenly, as he lay there, the man felt something unusual. His body grew hot,and with his inner eye he could see light inside himself. Both the heat and thelight grew very intense, until he lost consciousness. A moment later he woke up,and he knew that his illness was gone. Medical tests proved that it was, and heentered the ranks of the small number of people who have been healed at Lourdes.They are a tiny number compared with the millions of pilgrims who ask forhealing.WHO GETS PICKED AND WHY?Nobody knows, but I think miracles fit into a bigger picture. Whether you thinkof God as a higher power, a divine father, a protector, or any other conception,the world has witnessed too many miracles to doubt that they can occur. Whenthey do, everybody benefits because each miracle is a reminder that something isbeyond our world. That something is divine and holy. Sometimes it reaches intoour physical world and gives us an example of what lies beyond our knowledge. Amiracle wakes you up to a higher reality—walking on water, healing the sickthrough touch, spreading love by a single glance. I keep that in mind, andwhenever I am disappointed that I didn’t get my own personal miracle, I tellmyself, “Every miracle happened for me already. I am rich in miracles, no matterwhat happens.”The Glue of the UniverseQ: What does God do? I mean, once he created the universe, wasn’t he basicallydone?A: Creation isn’t just one step, like pulling a cake out of the oven. Right thissecond the universe is being created as new stars are born. Another part of theuniverse is holding still and changing only gradually, like the stars that werecreated billions of years ago. And a third part of the universe is breakingdown, giving way to destruction, like the stars that explode into novas orcollapse into black holes.God is the power and intelligence behind all three. He upholds the creation. Noteverybody loves this idea. In the age of science the universe isn’t upheld byits creator. It is upheld by physical forces like gravity. To believe that Godis waiting in the wings, like a choreographer running the show but neverappearing on stage, is considered a religious belief, not science.But I think there’s a deeper science that still allows for God. On one level thewhole universe looks like billions of galaxies tumbling out of control throughspace. The big bang blasted the universe into existence in a firestorm ofincredible energy, without pattern or form. Is this all there is? If so, thenone huge question cannot be answered: Why did life ever happen?Go out and explode a firecracker on the Fourth of July. Wouldn’t you be amazedto find out that it brought anything to life? Explosions blow things to bits.But the big bang didn’t do that. It exploded with a force billions of times morepowerful than all the firecrackers and bombs on Earth, yet this delicate strandcalled DNA was born out of it just as stars and galaxies were. To me, the notionthat DNA could just appear randomly out of swirling energy is not believable.Each bit of human DNA is made up of three billion tiny chemical pairs linked inperfect order. Move a few thousand to a new place and you get a totallydifferent person. Move 1 percent out of place and you get a mountain gorillainstead of a human being.Saying DNA is an accident is like saying I could write the dictionary bythrowing a Scrabble game up in the air and letting the letters fall where theymay.A much better explanation is that intelligence is at work. This intelligenceupholds the universe by creating images. Your body is an image of thisintelligence. So is everyone else you know, each image being slightly differentfrom every other. God’s purpose in upholding the universe is like the purpose ofanyone who is looking in a mirror. He wants to see what he looks like. Exceptthat in this case, since God’s intelligence is infinite, he needs infiniteimages to see himself. And that is what the universe is and always has been: themirror of infinity.Why Doesn’t God Step In?Q: Why does God allow bad things to happen? Couldn’t he just step in and fixthem?A: Only in a different world would God step in. That kind of a world would nothave free will in it. In this world we are all free to choose. Bad things happenbecause of wrong choices a lot of the time. If you go rock climbing withoutsafety equipment, that is your choice. But you might fall, and if you do, Godwon’t be there to catch you in midair.Freedom of choice is not just a rule set up for humans. If you look around, youwill see that animals and plants are also free. A seed from a maple tree getsblown by the wind, and where it lands isn’t always the right place for it.Sometimes it lands on harsh ground where nothing can grow. Sometimes it lands onfertile ground where it will grow perfectly. In a different world every seedmight find the perfect way to grow. But in this one nature explodes in a milliondirections, and some creatures perish while others survive.IS THIS FAIR?Couldn’t God have set up creation so that there would be no pain and sufferingat all? Of course. If you go out among the stars, immense galaxies are born anddie without the slightest pain. On our home planet pain isn’t part of the rainor the sun. Pain is more personal than that. For you and me and everyone weknow, both bad things and good things are part of the package. Light and dark,good and evil, are constantly at play. God’s purpose was to set the stage for usand then to allow us to create anything we wanted. If you and I ever get to seeanother world—perhaps the world of the angels—we will find proof that only goodcan exist. For now this world of light and dark is the gift we have receivedfrom the creator.Where Did I Sin?Q: I come from a strict religious background where bad people are punished fortheir sins. But how do you know when you have sinned? I have had bad thingshappen to me, and I don’t remember doing anything wrong.A: I think you have spotted a big weakness in the whole theory of sin. Itdoesn’t seem like such a good system if people are punished for things theycan’t remember doing. I don’t remember stepping on an anthill recently, but tosome faiths it is a sin to kill even the smallest being. I don’t rememberaccidentally saying a lot of things that may have hurt someone’s feelings. Isthat a tiny sin or a middle-size one?It would be even worse if the wrong people were being punished. When a jet planecrashes and everyone is killed, it’s hard to believe that God looked down anddecided that all one hundred passengers were guilty of sin and deserved to die.SIN IS A PUZZLEI am not sure there’s a good way out of this problem. Wise men have tried tosolve it for thousands of years. The best answer, for me at least, is to stopthinking that God punishes us at all. You already know when you are doingsomething bad. Your conscience tells you. Part of growing up is to listen tothat conscience. If you feel guilty about something, go and correct it. Do whatit takes until the guilt is gone. In that way you won’t have to worry aboutwaiting for God to punish you. As long as you balance your life so that there isfar more good in it than bad, sin becomes much less important. What’s reallyimportant is growing in your soul day by day. Focus your attention there and letthe heavy religious thinkers fret about the theory of sin without you. They aregoing to anyway.Original SinQ: What about the Garden of Eden? I was taught that Adam and Eve sinned, andthat is why we have so much suffering now.A: The story of the Garden of Eden poses a question: Is everyone a sinnerbecause sometime in the deep past our ancestors were sinners? People haveanswered this question with both yes and no. There is no one certain answer.This may surprise you, but billions of people have never heard the story of Adamand Eve. It isn’t part of their spiritual tradition, and therefore they havenever understood why the Garden of Eden is so important. They don’t feel likethe children of original sin. Original sin is the name given to the disobediencethat Adam and Eve showed toward God. For their disobedience they were drivenfrom the Garden of Eden, and from that time on, human beings have sinned andsuffered.One thing is certain. Everyone makes mistakes, and everyone has more bad thingshappen to them than they would like. Whether you believe in the story of theGarden of Eden or not, reducing the suffering in your life is important. Infact, that is the whole point of being spiritual: You can find a way to leavesuffering behind.God Is WatchingQ: Does God watch everything I do? That makes me feel that I could be punishedjust for my thoughts or that I will never be good enough to satisfy him.A: It’s very hard for most people to think about God except as a human beingsitting on a throne in the clouds. This kind of God is said to look down andwatch everything in creation. He knows who has been good and who has been bad,and we are all judged accordingly. But what if God is everywhere? Then he can’tbe sitting outside the game watching it. He is part of every person, and alsopart of every action, both good and bad. It’s harder to imagine God that way,but I think it’s closer to the truth. God is watching you because you arewatching yourself. When you have a thought, so does God. When you take a cookiefrom the cookie jar without permission, so does God.DOES THAT SOUND STRANGE?We don’t think of God’s taking a cookie from the cookie jar. Maybe we should,because the idea of a punishing God sitting up on his throne is veryintimidating. Getting away from God as the great judge in the sky is a challengefor millions of people who would rather believe in a God that acts like a humanbeing who likes some things and dislikes others. I think God sees everything andaccepts everything. That is what makes him God. Part of you is just like that.It sees everything about you and accepts all of it. In your spiritual life youwill be trying to reclaim that part of yourself, which is your soul. You willnot worry about someone in the sky passing judgment on you, because you will seeyourself as a unique part of the divine creation, and therefore as of infinitevalue. You are worth as much to God as he is worth to himself.McDonald’s in Heaven?Q: Is there a McDonald’s in heaven?A: I must tell you that this isn’t a question anybody has ever asked me—I readit in a book I picked up at the airport. But since it was a question asked by ateenager, I began to think about it. And to my surprise, I had to admit that myanswer wasn’t either yes or no. A lot of people want the answer to be yes,because they think of heaven as having all the best things here on Earth, andfor them a McDonald’s (or a Wendy’s or a really good ice cream stand) belongs inheaven.HEAVEN IS FOR YOUBut my answer is that heaven contains what you want it to. You may find it hardto believe, but I think everyone gets the heaven that matches their imagination.What is heaven but a place where what you deeply love comes true? God doesn’tforce you to love one thing or another—it’s your choice. Maybe you love hot dogsand hate fish, while someone else has the opposite tastes. Heaven isn’t a placewith fixed scenery. It’s the essence of God’s love. And I think that essence cantake any form. That is why every mother sees her own baby as beautiful, becausethe essence of love is found in her baby. Heaven for each of us will take theshape that brings out what we love and what we see as perfect.Does God Love Me?Q: How do I know that God loves me? There are a lot of times when I don’t lovemyself.A: This is a sensitive question because we all have moments when we don’t loveourselves. It’s attractive to think that at least God must love us, but thenthere is that speck of doubt. After all, if he knows me better than I knowmyself, maybe he doesn’t love me at all. Maybe he has ticked off a list of mybad qualities and I just don’t stack up as all that lovable. I think you can putthat worry away. God exists at the level of your soul. They are both made of thesame thing, which is pure love. I would never put anyone down because they had adifferent notion of God. Maybe to them God does sit back and decide who islovable and who isn’t.But for thousands of years spiritual people have said, “Love must come fromsomewhere. It is such a powerful feeling here on Earth that it seems to comefrom God.” In your life you will experience moments of intense love, and thenthis idea of divine love will make sense. You will feel in your heart that youhave touched God’s love or that it is touching you. Without such an experience,I guess this whole question is kind of theoretical. God’s love is empty until itis felt. But keep believing in love wherever it comes from, and one day I’m sureyou will have such an experience. It exists everywhere, waiting to berecognized.Waiting for GodQ: Don’t some people wait for God all their life and never meet him?A: Yes. But imagine that you went to a baseball game and you met someone sittingin the stands dressed in a uniform. This person says, “I want to be a goodbaseball player, so I am sitting here waiting until that happens.” Such anattitude makes no sense. You can’t sit on the sidelines and wait. That’s fine ifyou want to be a spectator, but not if you want to play. God is pure creation.He is all game, and many would say he is all play. If you sit and wait, so doesGod. But if you get into the game, then every day brings a chance to meet God.God is in the next great idea you have, in the next burst of joy, in the nextthing you suddenly love, no matter what that might be. God is the inner life ofeverything, not the outer mask. So if you plunge deep into any experience youlove, eventually your love will take you to that place where you meet the sourceof love, which is God.What Does God Look Like?Q: I’ve seen paintings that are supposed to be true images of God. Are thesewhat God looks like?A: God has appeared in millions of images over the centuries. Although manypeople cherish an image of God as a loving father (usually with a white beard),there are equally loved images of God as a mother. But all of these are humanimages. What if I changed your question into this: What does love look like?Love doesn’t have one face, and we don’t expect it to. Love can be in a sunset,in a mother’s smile, in music, or just in a beautiful feeling. God can’t reallybe caught in images either, but we keep trying because that’s one way to expressworship and reverence. Enjoy the images that appeal to you, but also keep inmind that no single image will ever bring you the real thing.Is God a Superstition?Q: What’s the difference between believing in God and believing in asuperstition like Friday the thirteenth?A: Superstitions wear out pretty quickly once you test them. There are usuallyseveral Friday the thirteenths a year, and bad things don’t happen on them anymore than on any other day. People who live around black cats don’t have worseluck than people who don’t. God has been called a superstition. When science wasmaking its greatest advances, around the time of Einstein, many people thoughtthat God would never survive the scientific worldview, since science deals inthings you can see and touch. But God has survived, and Einstein himselfbelieved that the most fascinating thing he could do with his own life was tokeep trying to find out what was in the mind of God.I think that’s a wonderful attitude. The more you look for a divine intelligencein the universe, the more you find evidence of the things God stands for: order,creativity, omnipresence, infinity, eternity. Science sees all these things inthe cosmos, and the other qualities of God—love, truth, compassion, joy—are leftto us to search for as individuals, following our own heart for a lifetime. Thisis the great journey of the soul that I believe we were all born to follow.Ticket to HeavenQ: If I don’t believe in God, can I still go to heaven?A: No one can answer that with certainty, but you bring up a point that’s reallyimportant. Believing in God could be a ticket to heaven, or maybe not. Just asnot believing in God could keep you out of heaven, or maybe not. But God is morethan a ticket to a better place after you die. God is part of you through yoursoul, and by exploring that part of you every day in some small way, you add toyour life. This life is improved by getting to know your soul. What happenslater will always be an open question. But if you only use God as a ticket toheaven, you will miss out on a lot here and now.Life After DeathQ: Do you personally believe there is life after death? I am afraid of dying,and I am most afraid that I will just disappear forever.A: I felt exactly the same way as a teen, which for many people is the mostintense time for worrying about death. This is the time when answers that maywork for a child no longer do. That’s because you are beginning to think foryourself in a deeper way. And I hope you continue. I have met many adults who“know for sure” that death is the end of things or who “know for sure” thatthere is life after death.I don’t know for sure.All I can say is that for me personally, all evidence is in favor of life afterdeath. The entire universe displays intelligence, power, and organization. Lifeis shaped by an infinite creative force. Death occupies an honorable placeinside this scheme. Every atom that once existed in someone’s body is part ofthe life I now enjoy. With every breath I take in millions of atoms from someonewho lived before me. My food comes from the earth, whose fertility is entirelydue to past life forms.DEATH IS NOT YOUR ENEMYThis means that death isn’t the enemy of life. It serves life. It balancescreation so that the universe doesn’t fall into total stagnation. If starsdidn’t die, if plants didn’t decompose, if whole ages didn’t rise and fall, youwouldn’t be here to read this page. Your very body depends on death, sincemillions of cells die every day to produce new tissue (if you looked athousehold dust under a microscope, you’d see that up to half of it consists ofdiscarded skin cells that people slough off).So nature is at ease with death. Why aren’t we? Because our minds explorepossibilities raised by fear. We are afraid to see our bodies grow old and cometo an end. We therefore adopt the fear that our personalities will come to anend, and maybe our very selves will too. What worked for me was to keep askingabout these possibilities but to get rid of the fear. When Socrates was about todie, having drunk the poison that the judges of Athens had condemned him to, hispupils wept to think that such a great philosopher and an innocent man shoulddie. But Socrates was amazingly calm. He’d been taking a small step toward deathevery day, he explained. Why should the last one make him afraid?I don’t know if Socrates had the answer to your question, but he did find outhow to end fear. Life and death are walking together, and you don’t have to beafraid as you join their walk. As you mature, keep gaining in power andintelligence. All kinds of fears will drop away, and one day you will find thatin your heart of hearts you have built a deep faith in these things. The closeryou get to your source, which is pure power and intelligence, the easier it isto believe that life goes on eternally. In that belief you will understand thatlife after death isn’t important. Life and death are important together, hereand now.Is Hell Real?Q: I just found out that some religions don’t believe in a hell after you die.But if hell is real, doesn’t every person go there who is bad?A: The existence of heaven and hell has not been a constant over the centuries.Throughout history many saints and sages have had visions of both, but of courseno one can truly know if either one exists. (It’s interesting that when peoplecome back from near-death experiences, such as being resuscitated from a heartattack, they often speak of being drawn by a white light. In almost every casethis light feels as if it is a loving light that leads to heaven. Only a tinypercentage of near-death experiences bring the feeling of hell.)THE DEVIL’S DRAMAHell is very dramatic, with its pits of fire and devils. But remember that theseare just images, and mostly they came from the imaginations of artists. Fear ofpunishment after death was once a major part of religious teaching in manycountries. I don’t think it needs to be, however, and whenever I meet people whohave stopped being afraid of hell, I feel encouraged that spirituality based onlove rather than fear is gaining ground. It’s much more important to try toimprove the huge suffering brought about by violence, crime, starvation,disease, and poverty around the world. The victims of these terrible things arealready in a kind of hell that we can help them to escape. Devote yourself tocreating a moment of heaven for someone here on Earth, rather than worryingabout something that will never be proved.How to See an AngelQ: I love angels, and I was wondering if there is a way to see one. I have readin books that angels have been seen thousands of times in many cultures. Is thatstill possible?A: It would be wonderful if angel-watching were like bird-watching. But angelsseem to appear when the time is right and only then. I have met people who tellme that they were visited by an angel. Nobody, as far as I know, was actuallylooking for one. It just appeared, but each time there was some kind ofimportant message—of either hope or healing—that the person received. You mayalready know that the wordangel comes from the Greek word formessenger. Maybethat’s the most important clue to how one might see an angel. If you are in needof a message from your soul, sometimes an angel will deliver it. But your soulhas many other messages to deliver to you, so don’t wait for an angel, but be onthe lookout yourself. Be your own angel and discover what your soul wants totell you.Guardian AngelsQ: What does my guardian angel do? Can I connect with it?A: Some people feel that they are very connected to a guardian. They feel apresence that protects and guides them in times of need. Their guardian angelisn’t a person, but more like an inner voice that says, “Make this choice. It’sbetter for you.” So whenever these people resist doing what they know is bad,they will give the credit to the guardian angel that showed them how to make theright choice.Can you also connect with your own guardian angel in this way? I would not doubtit, since people are capable of all kinds of sensitivity—maybe one day you willbe aware of a presence that guides and protects you. To me, it is even moreimportant to be aware of your own inner nature. Have you ever been in asituation of danger that you escaped without knowing how you did it? Perhaps youwere almost in a car accident or, without thinking, stepped off the curb infront of a bus. Just in time you swerved or pulled back. People who believe inguardian angels would say that it was the angel who protected them, but it isjust as valid to say that we all see and feel more than we realize. Some part ofyou sees beyond your five senses. Consciously you may not have seen the recklessdriver or the oncoming bus, but some part of you did. Whether you call this yourangel or your own higher self doesn’t matter. What does matter is to trust thatyou have a higher self that knows a lot about life and wants to connect withyou.Will I See God?Q: When I die, will I see God personally?A: The promise that we will all see God when we die is a source of great comfortand joy to hosts of people. Can anyone verify that it is true? I think this is amatter of faith, and in my experience, what you put your faith in, if youbelieve deeply, usually does come true.God’s TruthQ: How should I respond when other kids say that everything in the Bible istrue?A: You want to answer with integrity and yet not offend them, since argumentsover someone’s religion never lead to a good ending. Agree that the Bible is oneway that God’s truth has been expressed. But it isn’t the only truth, sincethere are many hundreds of scriptures that also contain the same truthsexpressed in other ways. If everyone could honor everyone else’s faith, theworld would be saved from a huge amount of violence and warfare. If your friendstry to argue that only one faith and one scripture is true, don’t beintimidated. They are reinforcing the age-old religious intolerance that hasbrought immense misery to human beings. You can still be their friend withoutjoining in. In this case, by not arguing, you are adding to the peace in theworld.Turning the Other CheekQ: Does turning the other cheek mean that if someone hurts me once, I should letthem hurt me twice? I have a hard time with this one. My natural urge is to hitback.A: Turning the other cheek is about not returning violence with violence. It’snormal that when someone hurts you, your first impulse may be to hit back.That’s the basic reaction of small children, and many people grow up trying hardto overcome it when they are adults. Nations fight because the spiritual valueof being nonviolent hasn’t sunk in. You don’t have to let someone hurt youtwice. Nobody wants you to become a victim. But if you can learn to resist yourown impulse to hurt them back, you will become one of the peacemakers in theworld. Peace begins one person at a time, and you can become such a person,starting today.Afraid of God?Q: If God is going to punish us for being bad, shouldn’t we be afraid of him?I’m mostly afraid of God, even though I know I am supposed to love him.A: Being afraid of God goes along with the whole notion of sin. If you see Godas a punisher, it’s only natural to be afraid. Since many people also believethat they are sinners, this makes fear of God almost impossible to escape. Mybelief is that you don’t need a punishing God for any reason. You can pray toGod as your consoler, protector, best friend, soul mate, divine father ormother—there are so many faces to God, without having to look at him as anangry, punishing deity."},{"pageContent":"POSTSCRIPTFOR EVER AND EVERAs a boy in India, I went to a school run by the Christian Brothers. I wasn’t aChristian myself; neither were most of the other boys in my classes. But ourteachers were. Many, as I remember, came from Ireland, a place so far away Icould never imagine visiting it.So there I was, a small brown boy learning the Lord’s Prayer from very devout,very pale Catholics. I’d bow my head and murmur those familiar words: “For thineis the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen.”Beautiful words, but did I believe them? Well, the kingdom part didn’t strikethe right chord because in 1945, right before I was born, India had gainedfreedom from an English king. “The power, and the glory” sank in. It tooktwenty-five years, but eventually I came to see that the best way to live yourlife is to pursue the invisible power and glory that is present everywhere inthe universe.Which leaves the last four words: “for ever and ever.”They stand for eternity, and eternity is the biggest concept anyone could hopeto explore. Here we are, you and I, at the end of a journey, yet as far as theeye can see, eternity stretches, as vast in front of us as behind us. Whichmeans we aren’t ever at the end of our journey. No matter how young you are, youhave eternity to go. No matter how old you are, you have eternity to go.Eternity is the great equalizer. It’s not how good or bad you are that makes youequal in the eyes of God. Rather, it’s how far into eternity you’ve come.Eternity is the school of life. Even if you believe that life began only twobillion years ago on Earth, even if you believe that the universe was bornfifteen billion years ago in the big bang, eternity isn’t shaken. At the deepestlevel of nature time disappears. There is only eternity left when all the matterand energy have gonepoof ! The miracle is that you can visit this timelessplace. I’m inviting you to go there with me—with everyone, if they want to cometoo.My last word to you is that you deserve eternity, and you deserve the power andglory that come with it. All three exist here and now. There’s no waitingaround. You have everything you need for the trip:You can think.You can feel.You can do.Turn these everyday things toward the far horizon of your deepest dreams, andyou will soon be in pursuit of eternity. Look for me. I will be just ahead ofyou, or perhaps just behind. In any event, we will recognize each other.We’re the ones who still have eternity to go."}]
