Surely thisrefrain has been heard throughout the ages, but in the second decade of thetwenty-first century, humankind poses a terrible threat to its own existence aswe blindly tear great holes in the life-sustaining fabric of our environment. Wecan no longer turn to government, however well meaning it may be, or to anyonebeyond ourselves, to provide answers for the great problems of our time. Andeven in turning to ourselves we must go beyond the constant clamor of ego,beyond the tools of logic and reason, to the still, calm place within us: therealm of the soul.Here we can begin by asking the basic questions that give our lives meaning. Whoam I? Why am I here? How can I tune in the soft-spoken urgings of the soul tofulfill my life’s purpose and to make a difference? In answering these questionsto the best of our ability, each of us must step into the role of leader, takingresponsibility first for directing our own lives, and then for interacting withother people—at work, at home, and everywhere in between. As we continue to drawon the soul for direction, we will eventually find that other people are turningto us for guidance, drawn to us by our ability to treat them with dignity and toskillfully respond to their needs from a higher place.My aim in this book is to give everyone the skills and insights to be aleader—not just any leader but an inspired one. At the deepest level, a leaderis the symbolic soul of the group. His role is to fulfill the needs of othersand, when each need is met, to lead the group on to fulfill ever higher needs,lifting the group’s potential at every step. The inspired leader’s power basecomes not from other people but from her very being, and the path she walks isguided by her own soul. Its hallmarks are creativity, intelligence, organizingpower, and love.Everyone who has a soul, which by my definition includes us all, has thepotential to be an inspired leader. When you change on the inside so that youdraw on the unlimited wisdom of the soul, you become a leader without needing toseek followers. As you put your vision for a better world into tangible form,they will find you. It is my fondest hope that after reading these pages,countless readers like you will discover their greatness and act upon it. Ofthese leaders, untold numbers may become public figures, and even more willperform a leadership role at work, at home, and in the community. Wherever youdo it, there is no doubt in my mind that leading from the soul is what the timedemands.As you’ll see in the pages that lie ahead, the leadership I’m talking about inthis book is not leadership as we’ve traditionally defined it. According to thatold definition, leadership belongs to the few. In a group the person selected tolead may stand out as the most popular, confident, or ruthless. By thesemeasures, not everyone can lead. When the strong and ruthless rise on the worldstage, we find ourselves led by kings and generals, autocrats and dictators,power-hungry premiers and presidents. History traffics in myth making, which isbased on personal charisma and uses spin to evoke an aura of destiny. But thesemeasures of leadership are flawed. None of the qualities mentioned here indicatethat a leader will actually improve the lives of those who follow him. Chancesare equally good that such leadership will bring misery, conflict, andoppression. The old definitions of leadership exalt power, and the use of powerhas always been directly linked to its abuse.Because leaders have turned out to be so completely unpredictable, and becauseso few great leaders have emerged from the ranks of those who have seized power,we have been led to believe that perhaps there is some invisible hand at work,selecting which leader will be great. But this is only more spin. The criteriafor inspired leadership don’t need to be shadowed in mystery. In fact, they aresimple: great leaders are those who can respond to their own needs and the needsof others from the higher levels of spirit with vision, creativity, and a senseof unity with the people they lead.You can be such a leader. The path is open to you. The only requirement is thatyou listen to your own inner guide. Once you step onto this path, you are onyour way to becoming what I call a successful visionary. A successful visionarymakes his or her vision manifest in the world. Invisible seeds planted in thesilence of your deepest awareness become tangible, visible realities. As theyunfold, you will manage their growth with passion and energy. Your purpose willbe apparent to all. The results you achieve will benefit everyone—you, the groupyou lead, and the world at large. On a planet challenged on every side withecological deterioration, everything you achieve must be sustainable, whichmeans supported by awareness. This is an essential part of any vision of thefuture that draws on the soul.When I talk about the soul, I’m not referring to the soul as defined by anyparticular religion, although all the great spiritual traditions acknowledge itsexistence. I believe the soul is an expression of an underlying universal fieldof consciousness. Your particular awareness, or soul, is like a wave in thisboundless sea, unique for a brief moment in time before it falls back into thelarger entity from which it emerged. At the soul level you are seamlesslyconnected with everything in the universe, to the silent domain from which allmatter and energy spring.In this context it is not surprising that the soul takes on qualities that areessential to creation: creativity, intelligence, organizing power, and love. Ifyou find this notion difficult to accept, perhaps you’ll agree with me that theold way of living on this planet is reaching its limits, and that the time hascome to try something new. If you find that, by turning to the soul forleadership in the ways I describe in this book, you are able to increase thecreativity, intelligence, organizing power, and love in your life and in yourlarger world, you can choose to credit your soul or not. It won’t care, andthose who share the world with you will be grateful, regardless of what termsyou use to describe your new way of being.A MAP FOR THE ROAD AHEADLeadership is an evolving journey. The twists and turns lying before you areunpredictable. But you can be provided with a map. The text that follows dividesthe map into three parts.First, I have laid out the core of what it means to lead from the soul in aconvenient acronym, L-E-A-D-E-R-S, with each letter outlining a key aspect ofdefining your vision and then bringing it to fruition.L = Look and listen. Do this with your senses, as an unbiased observer who hasnot judged anything in advance. Do it with your heart, obeying your truestfeelings. Finally, do it with your soul, responding to the vision and deeppurpose it provides.E = Emotional bonding. Leading from the soul means going beyond the melodrama ofliving in crisis mode. It requires recognizing and clearing away toxic emotionsso you can clearly understand your own specific needs, and those of others.A = Awareness. This means being aware of the questions that underlie everychallenge: Who am I? What do I want? What does the situation demand? A leadermust continually ask these questions of herself, and inspire her team to askthem for themselves.D = Doing. A leader must be action-oriented. In whatever he does, he must serveas a role model, holding himself responsible for the promises he has made. Thisrequires persistence and tenacity, but also the ability to view any situationwith flexibility and humor.E = Empowerment. The soul’s power comes from self-awareness that is responsiveto feedback but independent of the good or bad opinion of others. Empowermentisn’t selfish. It raises the status of leader and team together.R = Responsibility. Responsible leadership includes choosing considered risksrather than reckless ones, walking the talk, having integrity, and living up toyour inner values. Seen from the level of the soul, a leader’s greatestresponsibility is to lead the group on the path of higher consciousness.S = Synchronicity. This is a mysterious element from the underlying universalfield of consciousness that all great leaders harness. Synchronicity is theability to create good luck and find invisible support that carries one beyondpredicted outcomes to a higher plane. In spiritual terms, synchronicity is theultimate ability to connect any need with an answer from the soul.The map of leadership comes into more specific focus in the second part of thisbook, through the stories of ordinary people who have become successfulvisionaries. Here we’ll follow two such people—Jeremy Moon and Renata M.Black—who began with no material means and went on to lead successfulmultimillion-dollar enterprises that make a difference in the world. In bothcases the vision that started their journey was fueled with passion and purpose.That’s not unusual in success stories, but here we also find deeper values,drawn from the realm of soul.As we’ll see, Jeremy’s and Renata’s paths followed the steps described in theacronym L-E-A-D-E-R-S; everything from looking and listening to synchronicityplayed a crucial role. Besides being inspiring, this part of the book will giveyou more confidence that leading from the soul is a viable choice in therough-and-tumble of the real world. In fact, by choosing visionary leadership asa path to success, the real world became a miraculous place for both leaders, aplace where material success took a backseat to personal discovery.The third part of the book is a brief summary of what you will have learned. Ihope it is couched in such a way as to make it easier for you to recognize thelandmarks of soulful leadership as they begin to make themselves known in yourlife.WHY THE SOUL?How do leaders emerge from ordinary lives? Every group naturally gives rise toleaders who guide it to a shared goal. Yet some leaders fail, while otherssucceed. Some are destroyed by a flawed strategy, or by the overwhelming stressof their role. And when crisis arises, leaving us crying out for great leaders,there is a constant threat that such a figure will not appear, leaving theinfamous “leadership vacuum” that has become such a chronic problem in ourmodern society.In the deeper reality of the soul, a family in disarray, a company withoutvision, or a nation struggling to adopt a new level of freedom needs to respondto hidden spiritual drives and needs. Once this is understood, countless leaderscan rise to the highest levels of greatness. Inspired leadership is establishedin being, where there is no need to adopt a strategy for climbing to the top. Asyou unfold your potential for greatness, you unfold the same potential inothers. They will naturally turn to you for guidance and leadership in the wayforward, and one day they themselves will be able to provide enlightenedleadership to others.Our souls offer the highest inspiration at every moment. With our minds we maysee chaos, but the soul knows there is an underlying order, and seeks to findit. Until we turn to the quiet wisdom of the soul, we will continue to fall backon old habits and stale answers in response to new challenges. We will staymired in pointless struggles and confusion. But when we do understand the waysof the soul, and draw on them, someone will emerge to cut through the fog.Mahatma Gandhi, Mother Teresa, and Nelson Mandela undertook their journeys basedon the soul’s awareness (however much we clothe them in mythic status). Theyused this awareness to tap into a source of wisdom that remains constantthroughout history and is available to us all.In any group the members are acting out two basic themes in life—need andresponse. If we could see ourselves clearly, each of us would realize every daythat:• There is something we need, ranging from the basic need for food and shelterto the higher needs of self-worth, love, and spiritual meaning;• There is some response that will fill that need, ranging from struggle andcompetition to creative discovery and divine inspiration.These two themes dominate our inner and outer lives. They override all otherforces, and like the workings of the soul they are not random. Needs andresponses can be organized in a natural order. Lower needs and responses arefollowed by higher ones. (As the German writer Bertolt Brecht declared, “Don’ttalk to me of my soul until you’ve filled my stomach.”) This rising scale isknown as the hierarchy of needs. As a leader, if you are aware of the hierarchyof needs and their responses, you will be able to continue to respondeffectively as the group’s needs move up the scale from basic to increasinglyspiritual. This is the most powerful thing a leader can do.For example, extreme social movements (fascism, religious fundamentalism, ethnicnationalism, etc.) draw upon fear, the most primitive response of a group, whichmatches its most primitive need: survival. External pressures such as economicdepression, social migration, and competitive forces also trigger this need.Vaclav Havel was a Czech poet who became president of the new republic after thefall of Communism because he fulfilled his countrymen’s basic need for safety,and then went on to address their higher needs for unity and self-worth, whichhad been suppressed for decades. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., offered anoppressed minority the opportunity to go beyond the need to survive in order tomeet their higher needs for a sense of dignity and spiritual purpose. He offeredtransformation. Buddha and Christ offered their followers an opportunity to meettheir needs at the highest level, the universal desire for unity.Through the example of these great leaders, we see that leading from the soul isneither mysterious nor abstract. Inspired leadership matches real responses toreal needs. This is a skill that can be learned. You can do it, and so can I. Wecan meet needs at every level of a group’s outer and inner life, applying thesame awareness to a family, or a community, as to a corporation. In the deeperreality of the soul, leaders and followers co-create each other. They form aninvisible spiritual bond. Leaders exist to embody the values that followershunger for, while followers fuel the leader’s vision from inside themselves.THE BASIC PRINCIPLESThe journey that a leader takes is one of expanding awareness. The soul itselfhas complete awareness; it perceives every aspect of a situation. Itsperspective is available to you, but ordinarily you don’t access it because ofyour own inner obstacles. We see what we want to see—or what our biases andlimitations encourage us to see. On your journey to inspired leadership you willlearn how to remove these obstacles. When you do, what was once difficult willbecome effortless, as your soul clears the way for you. Your vision becomesclearer, and so does the path ahead, until it seems that the universe itself isconspiring to provide the creativity, intelligence, organizing power, and lovethat lie at the heart of visionary leadership."},{"pageContent":"PART ONEL - E - A - D - E - R - S"},{"pageContent":"ONEL = LOOK AND LISTENGreat leaders have a vision, and the ability to manifest it. Defining your ownvision begins with looking and listening. You look and listen to the situationaround you, but you also look and listen inside. Four steps are involved:Impartial observation—Look and listen with your senses.Analysis—Look and listen with your mind.Feeling—Look and listen with your heart.Incubation—Look and listen with your soul.Once you have gone through these four steps, your personal vision can begin toexpress itself.The best qualities you can have when starting your career are passion, corevalues, and dedication to a purpose. These are the elements from which a visionis forged. When you talk to the most inspiring leaders, the kind I callsuccessful visionaries, it turns out that they all began with passion and a viewof the big picture. They brought dedication to a deeply felt purpose. They heldcore values that they were not willing to surrender. In order to find greatnessin yourself, these elements should be your primary focus.Over the years, researchers have tried to find external reasons for the rise ofsuccessful leaders. Based on this research, it might seem that being born intowealth, going to the best schools, associating with other successful people, andscoring high on IQ tests would more or less guarantee that a person would turninto a leader. But as we all know, you can start with nothing and still emergeas a great leader, whereas you can start off in life with any number ofadvantages and achieve little or nothing of value. External advantages giveanyone a head start, but they are not a guarantee of success.So what if we reverse this approach and look instead at things that we allpossess? Everyone knows how to look and listen—these are the basic tools ofperception. But in a leader they grow into something more. A leader isresponsible for having a vision, which must be clear enough to guide others andinspire them. Having articulated her vision, a leader must be able to manifestit. The greatest ideas are nothing more than daydreams until they are pushed tobecome reality. If you want to be a successful visionary, here is where thejourney begins, with two crucial questions: What is my vision? How can I make ithappen?No vision is created in a vacuum. It emerges from the situation at hand. Thatsituation can be a crisis or a routine project, a management problem or afinancial emergency, anything that requires a leader to offer guidance, toassess the situation by looking and listening at the deepest level possible.This pertains to parents and sports coaches, mentors and counselors, managersand CEOs. Anytime you are called upon to guide, teach, command, motivate,inspire, or plan, opportunity is knocking.Imagine three people seated on a couch in an outer office, all dressed in theirbest business attire. The office itself belongs to a venture capitalist who hasagreed to give each of them a half hour to present a proposal for a start-upcompany. Success or failure depends upon this meeting. Who among the three willemerge as a leader, the one with the best chance of persuading the venturecapitalist?The first person feels so nervous his palms are sweaty. He tries to make casualconversation but realizes that he’s babbling, so he falls silent. He closes hiseyes, reviewing one last time the speech he is going to make. He got very littlesleep the night before, having spent hours going over every word of hispresentation. He keeps thinking one thing: Now or never. It’s do or die.The second person looks much calmer. He’s quite confident, in fact. He believesin his idea; he’s certain his new business will succeed once he finds a backer.Tall and clear-eyed, he’s used to being looked up to. In the back of his mind,he wonders if he can talk the venture capitalist into going out for a round ofgolf or a pickup basketball game. One-on-one has always been his best mode ofpersuasion.The third person is scanning the room with open curiosity. She notices the richOriental rug and fresh flowers on the reception desk, but she’s more interestedin the employees going in and out of the venture capitalist’s inner office.They’re dressed in jeans and skirts, not suits. They look focused and intent butnot stressed. Checking inside herself, the third person feels much the same way.Whatever happens, she’s open to the outcome. Once she sets eyes on the venturecapitalist, she’ll know what kind of personality she’s dealing with and respondaccordingly.Of these three people, the first one isn’t looking and listening to much beyondhis own feelings, which are tense and closed off. The second man is morecomfortable and is beginning to see from the heart. He assesses people andsituations by how they feel. The third person goes a step further, however. Sheis entirely open to her surroundings, looking and listening intently. From theclues she picks up, she begins to build a scenario. She can envision herself inthe scenario, and as it unfolds, she will adapt. If it turns out that shedoesn’t fit in, she won’t make the mistake of taking the venture capitalist’smoney; if the compatibility isn’t there, she’ll move on and find it elsewhere.In this imaginary scenario we can see that the leader with the greatestpotential in this moment is the one who can look and listen from the deepestlevel. Leadership requires a sound basis inside yourself. When you can arrive atthe point where looking and listening comes from your entire being, you aresetting the stage to be an inspiring leader.FOUR LEVELS OF PERCEPTIONTo be truly insightful, looking and listening must occur on four differentlevels. Seeing with our eyes is only the beginning. When we look and listenfully, we involve the body, the mind, the heart, and the soul.Body: The stage of observing and information gatheringMind: The stage of analysis and judgmentHeart: The stage of feelingSoul: The stage of incubationOnce you are satisfied that you have gone through all these stages, your visionin any given moment will emerge as the true expression of who you are, and itwill be founded on deep understanding.Observation: Begin by being as open and impartial as possible. See as much asyou can, and listen to whoever has something to say. In a sense you functionlike a video camera. Allow sights and sounds to come in freely and objectively.Analysis: At the same time, your mind is also taking in the situation. It beginsto weigh and analyze. Allow any and every idea to come to mind. Watch whatarises, and notice wisps of answers, new interpretations, and novelcombinations. Once again, steer clear of judgments and preconceptions. Beunbiased and clear-headed.Feeling: At the level of your heart, notice what feels right. Feeling is subtlerand truer than pure analysis. This is the level where sudden insight can strikeyou. You are bringing intuition into the picture, allowing for the “aha” momentthat accompanies quantum leaps of creativity.Incubation: Now let go and wait. When a vision is incubating, it goes into adeep, invisible place. A profound and infinite intelligence nurses your vision,adapting it to your needs and the needs of everyone around you. You have gainedaccess to something greater than yourself, whether you call it the higher self,pure awareness, or your connection with God. If none of these terms work foryou, you might want to think of the soul as “who I really am.”A leader, therefore, emerges from within himself. He matches his innerperception with the outer situation. A twenty-four-year-old Indian arriving inSouth Africa in 1893 saw that he would be beaten if he refused to ride on therunning board of a stagecoach to make room for white European passengers. If heinsisted on riding in the first-class compartment of a train because he had afirst-class ticket, he would be told that his place was in third class, nomatter what his ticket said. Yet if that twenty-four-year-old happened to beMohandas Gandhi, he could evaluate his situation using all four levels ofperception. With his eyes he looked around and perceived discrimination. Withhis heart he felt that the situation was intolerable. With his mind he analyzedthat a new tactic—civil disobedience—could change things. With his being hecommitted himself to a vision of freedom, whatever the price.Current leadership training, almost anywhere you look for it, uses the wordvision freely, but most often its basis is intellectual. Potential leaders aretaught to use their minds to analyze various hypothetical scenarios. By leavingout feeling, intuition, insight, and the profound wisdom of the soul, thistraining falls short of its potential. No one can deny the simple truth that thegreatest leaders are also great souls. Faced with apartheid in South Africa,slavery before the Civil War, or colonial domination in India, their eyes sawthe same thing that everyone else saw. Their minds had the same thoughts ascountless others around them. In their hearts they felt the same injustice. ButNelson Mandela, Abraham Lincoln, and Mahatma Gandhi each went deeper and asked,from the core of his being, how to elicit a new response, how to turn a newvision into reality.FINDING YOUR TRUE PURPOSEBeing in touch with the soul is the secret of great leadership. We are allcapable of following the path that unites body, mind, heart, and soul. By makinga soul connection, your true purpose in life will become the foundation ofeverything you do. Leaders exist to give of themselves, and you can give onlyfrom what you have. The soul—that is, the core of your true self—is the placewhere you will locate insight, creativity, imagination, and profoundintelligence. When you know what is happening at your very core, what you haveto give becomes limitless.In this chapter you will be formulating your life purpose in a single sentence,and once you are sure that this statement expresses your mission deeply andtruly, you will refine it further to a single word. The mission statement ofMartin Luther King, Jr., could have been “I am here to end racial discriminationand social injustice.” Refined to a single word, it might be “freedom.” Themission statement of Charles Darwin could have been “I am here to observe howlife changes and adapts to the environment.” Refined to a single word, it mightbe “evolution.”Your mission statement will fuse two components that we will develop in thischapter: a Soul Profile that reflects your values, and a Personal Vision thatreflects your deepest intentions.YOUR SOUL PROFILEUsing just a few words or phrases, answer the following questions. Be candid,and don’t dwell too long on the questions before you answer them. Let your firstresponses guide you. 1. What’s my contribution in life? 2. What’s the purpose in what I do? 3. How do I feel when I have a peak experience? 4. Who are my heroes and heroines (from history, mythology, fiction, religion)? 5. What are the qualities that I look for in a best friend? 6. What are my unique skills and talents? 7. What are the best qualities I express in a personal relationship?Now, using the key words you’ve developed in your answers above, write a briefprofile of your soul as if you were describing another person. For example:“Deepak’s purpose is to grow personally and to bring out inner potential andhidden possibilities. He contributes by being loving and supportive. When he hasa peak experience, he feels great inner peace and unity with everything aroundhim. His heroes are Gandhi, Buddha, Jesus, Mother Divine, and Krishna. In a bestfriend he looks for understanding and stimulation. He feels that his uniqueskill is communication. He has a talent for getting others to look beyond theirold conditioning and fixed boundaries. His best quality in personalrelationships is to love, support, and appreciate the other person.”Keeping your soul profile close at hand, now move on to the next step: definingyour personal vision.YOUR PERSONAL VISIONAgain using just a few words or phrases, complete the following sentences. Letyourself go. Don’t worry about being logical, or about the feasibility ofimplementing these ideas. Just write whatever comes to you. And above all, betrue to yourself. 1. I want to live in a world in which ______________. 2. I would be inspired to work in an organization that ________________. 3. I would be proud to lead a team that _________. 4. A transformed world would be ____________.To match your present work with your vision, answer the following:• How does your work in the world reflect the vision you outlined above?• What do you need (from your team or organization) to get closer to yourideals?• What can you offer (to your team and organization) to move it closer to yourideals?It may be that your present work is far from what your vision would want it tobe. The first step toward bridging that gap is to define your vision asspecifically as possible. Vague ideals remain passive; a focused purpose awakensthe unseen powers of the soul. On the other hand, you may be well on your way toachieving your vision, or at least you may have made the first steps. There isno right place to be right now. The point here is to clarify what kind of worldyou envision and how you see yourself in it.YOUR MISSION STATEMENTNow that you have written down your values and your vision, merge the two into asuccinct statement of your overall mission in this lifetime. Your statementshould describe what you want to accomplish as a leader from this point forward.Use the following template:My mission behind everything I do is ________________.• Keep it simple and concise.• A child should be able to understand it.• You should be able to state it even in your sleep.Example: My own mission statement originally was “to reach critical mass andachieve a peaceful, just, sustainable, and healthy world.” This needed to besimplified, which led me to come up with a clearer mission: “To serve the worldand all who live in it.”Finally, see if you can crystallize your mission statement into one word. Mineis “serve.” Yours might be “grow,” “evolve,” “inspire,” “peace,” or anythingelse. The key is that when you hit upon the most succinct way of stating yourpurpose, you will be listening to your true self, which is the first requirementfor anyone who aspires to lead from the soul.As a leader, your vision exists to be shared with enthusiasm and inspiration.The word enthusiasm comes from the Greek root en-theos or “in God,” remindingyou that you must look in your soul. Inspiration comes from the same Latin rootas to breathe and spirit. When you inspire others, you bring everyone into thespirit of your vision—you motivate them to breathe together in the sameatmosphere.PUTTING YOUR VISION TO WORKA vision is general; situations are specific. In every group situation you aregoing to find human beings, complete with complex feelings, beliefs, habits,experiences, memories, and agendas. Any leader is in a position to inspire sucha group, but it takes a successful visionary to influence every one of thoseaspects, most of which are hidden and highly personal. So having a vision isonly your first step. Now you must know how to enter situations and handle themat every level, from superficial (but necessary) managerial tasks toarticulating the core of values and beliefs that each of us protects andcherishes.Situations that cry out for leadership are easy to find. The next step is tofocus on the precise need that will bring productive change. As you begin toassess what is needed, you will soon discover that a need is different from agoal. The goal of a group may be to create a new marketing campaign, set up aproduction schedule, or reassign work to new management teams; but at a lessvisible level the leader must fulfill some basic needs that will determinewhether the goal is achievable. We have already touched briefly on these needs,which are universal. There are seven of them, listed below in ascending order.THE NEEDS OF THE GROUPSafety, securityAchievement, successCooperationNurturing, belongingCreativity, progressMoral valuesSpiritual fulfillmentThe pioneer who came up with this list of what people need and arranged it intothis hierarchy was the late psychologist Abraham Maslow. He determined that themost basic need (safety and security) must be met before a person can move on tohigher needs (love and social contact, for example). In the context ofleadership, we’re applying Maslow’s hierarchy to groups, which requires someminor adjustments to those needs, but the principle of meeting the most basicneeds before moving on to higher ones still holds true.A leader cannot make the mistake of trying to rise above basic needs beforeeveryone feels those needs have been met. And it takes immersion in thesituation—hands-on experience—to read what is going on. People don’t wear signsannouncing what they need—quite the opposite. The chronic complainer mayactually be afraid of losing his job; his need is for security. The outspokencritic of new ideas may feel left out; her need is for nurturing. Although we’vebeen discussing groups at work—project teams, the office you work in, themanagement group you belong in—these needs are universal, so they apply whereveryou go. The group could be your family, a volunteer organization, or a Scouttroop. To be the soul of the group, a leader must correctly perceive whateveryone needs and then put her perceptions into action.As a guide, here are some common situations that revolve around the seven needs:1. SAFETY, SECURITYSituations of threat and instability. People feel insecure. Discontent is in theair. You can see nervous faces, feel the prevailing anxiety. Who is going tomake the situation feel safer?2. ACHIEVEMENT, SUCCESSSituations of unrealized achievement. People feel unsuccessful. They want to bemore productive, but there’s not enough fire or passion to make it happen. Whois going to step up and provide the motivation so sorely needed?3. COOPERATIONSituations of incoherence and fragmentation. There’s no team spirit. The groupdisintegrates into bickering and petty wrangling. Meetings go on forever butreach no conclusion. Who’s going to be the glue that brings coherence to thesituation?4. NURTURING, BELONGINGSituations mired in bad feeling and apathy. Everyone is going through themotions, doing what they need to do, but feeling disengaged. There’s littlepersonal support or trust. Who’s going to bring heart to the situation and makeothers feel that they belong?5. CREATIVITY, PROGRESSSituations dominated by old solutions and stale ideas. People feel stymied.Everyone agrees that something new is needed, but all that emerges are smallvariations on the status quo. Who’s going to bring the spark of creativity tothe situation?6. MORAL VALUESSituations that are spiritually empty and corrupt. The weak feel hopeless, andthe strong are cynically taking advantage. People talk about righting wrongs,but no one knows where to start. The future feels like wishful thinking; thepresent is oppressive and suffocating. Who will bring hope and a renewed senseof innocence?7. SPIRITUAL FULFILLMENTSituations that symbolize the human condition. People are asking the bigquestions: Who am I? Why am I here? Many are seeking God. There is talk of ahigher reality, yet faith is lacking. Who can bring the light and demonstratethat holiness is a living reality?So far we’ve focused on looking, but listening is vitally important when itcomes to understanding the situation you are in, and what need is crying out tobe fulfilled. In almost every estimate of what makes a leader, the same qualityis mentioned: she’s a good listener. There’s real skill involved in becoming agood listener. When you meet one, the following factors are present.WHAT MAKES A GOOD LISTENER?1. Not interrupting.2. Showing that you empathize: not criticizing, arguing, or patronizing.3. Establishing a physical sense of closeness without invading personal space.4. Observing body language and letting yours show you are not distracted butattentive.5. Offering your own self-disclosures, but not too many, or too soon.6. Understanding the context of the other person’s life.7. Listening from all four levels: body, mind, heart, and soul.As with looking, listening begins with your senses, as you try to take in theother person’s story without judgment or partiality. Then you go beyond what youhear to analyze it with your mind. You also feel with your heart what the wordsare trying to convey—most people are expressing far more on the feeling levelthan the literal meaning of their words might indicate. Finally, you let thewords resonate with your soul, letting them incubate before you offer any adviceor take any action.The hierarchy of need is like a ladder, but life is about people—complexentities in the best of circumstances. Instead of a ladder to climb, lifepresents us with a ball of yarn to untangle. Situations overlap. Conditionsconstantly shift. Therefore you must remain flexible, looking and listening inorder to draw out the true need you are there to fulfill.Leadership is a way of life—a way you can now choose. A leader moves with lifeas naturally as possible even when there is no one following. Every step of theway he carries something with him, and this something sets him apart. It isn’tcharisma, self-confidence, ambition, or ego. Those qualities are identified withprominent leaders, but none are essential. The essential element isever-expanding awareness, which begins with looking and listening.THE LESSONS OF LOOKING AND LISTENING * Leading from the soul means looking and listening on four levels: body, mind, heart, and soul. * Once you have your own vision, it motivates and drives everything you do. * As a leader, you must respond to the hierarchy of needs, from the most basic to the highest.WHAT TO DO TODAYIt’s time to begin applying your vision to the needs of others. Today lookaround at the group that matters most to you—a team at work, your family, or avolunteer or school group. What does your group need? What response can youprovide? (Focus on what you see today; in later chapters, once the most basicneeds have been met, we’ll discuss how to lead the group to higher ones.)Your natural strengths will come out in your response to the situation, soconsider from the list below how well a leader’s response matches your own:Need: Safety, securityLeader’s response: I’m strong when it comes to defending others. I keep my headin a crisis; I’m good in an emergency.Need: Achievement, successLeader’s response: I know what it takes to win. I can motivate people toachieve. I can make them believe in me.Need: CooperationLeader’s response: I’m a conciliator who can see both sides of a conflict. I’msteady and not impulsive. I know how to get people out of their entrenchedpositions.Need: Nurturing, belongingLeader’s response: Empathy comes easily to me. I understand human nature. I knowhow to get people to forgive and see the best in one another. Handling emotionalsituations doesn’t fluster me; I’m comfortable with it.Need: Creativity, progressLeader’s response: I can get people to think outside the box. I know what makescreative people tick. I love to explore new possibilities. The unknown doesn’tfrighten me.Need: Moral valuesLeader’s response: I feel a calling. I want to heal old wounds, and I can helppeople see their higher purpose for being here. I want to share my understandingof why we were put on this earth.Need: Spiritual fulfillmentLeader’s response: I feel whole. I influence others who want the experience ofinner peace that I have. My inner silence speaks louder than words. I leadthrough my presence. Others consider me wise.The fruit of looking and listening is that you work from your own vision. It isyour passion, not because you thought it up, but because it comes from who youreally are. When you enter the situation and give of yourself as you really are,you grow along with the people you are helping. This is a merging of hearts,minds, and souls."},{"pageContent":"TWOE = EMOTIONAL BONDINGLeaders bring out the best in others, but successful visionaries go evenfurther: they form lasting emotional bonds. They are the kinds of leaders wehold in our hearts. When people are emotionally bonded to you, they want to havecontact with you. They want to be of service and share in your vision. Deepmotivation then develops. True, lasting loyalties are formed.To create such bonds, you must be willing to build real relationships. Shareyourself. Take a personal interest in others, and notice their strengths. At themost basic level, you must display healthy emotional energy yourself. Avoid thethree toxic A’s: authoritarianism, anger, and aloofness.In every situation, make it a habit to ask yourself the key questions ofemotional intelligence: How do I feel? How do they feel? What are the hiddenstumbling blocks between us? A leader who can answer these questions will be ina position to create lasting emotional bonds.Emotions are the invisible allies of successful visionaries. To carry out yourvision, you need to master this next area. When you think of a powerful leader,do you imagine a strong authority figure, a boss who cannot be defied, whosedisapproval is to be feared? Traditionally, leaders have sought to exerciseauthority, control, and power. In the long run this strategy doesn’t succeed;when motivated by fear, people perform either reluctantly or not at all. Aleader working with positive emotions, however, is able to unfold the potentialof everyone under her. If you are truly the soul of the group, you lead andserve at the same time. When others sense that you are willing to give ofyourself, your influence as a leader will expand tremendously.Successful visionaries in all ages forged emotional bonds, often instinctivelyand without a conscious agenda. We can tell that a bond exists because of thebehavior of those around them:They want to be in the leader’s presence.They want to be of service.They want to perform at their best, which brings them closer to the leader.They want to share in the leader’s vision.They want to participate in the leader’s success.None of this behavior is slavish; it’s how a group functions when it feelsinspired. Inspiration begins with emotional commitment. Stop for a moment, andconsider a leader who inspires you. If you were offered the opportunity to beclose to that person, wouldn’t you want to have personal contact, share in hervision, and be fulfilled by her success? These are qualities of emotionalbonding.BECOME EMOTIONALLY INTELLIGENTEmotional bonding isn’t the same as being touchy-feely, overly personal, orwearing your heart on your sleeve. It’s about working from a high level ofemotional intelligence, which has become an aspect of practical psychology. Tobe more specific, some basic principles grow out of emotional intelligence,allowing you to be emotionally clear and effective. These are skills that anysuccessful visionary must possess.Emotional Freedom: In order to bond effectively with others, you must beemotionally free. This means, first of all, being free of guilt, resentment,grievances, anger, and aggression. You aren’t required to be perfect, only to beclear about your own underlying feelings. We all have negative emotions, but aleader deals with them effectively, for the good of the group. He doesn’t givemixed signals or indulge in outbursts and moods—and if he does, he quickly makesamends. Only in clarity can you trust yourself emotionally and have others trustyou.To reach a point of clarity, it’s very useful to:• Stay aware of your body. Sensations of tightness, constriction, stiffness,discomfort, and pain are indications that negative emotions are asking to beacknowledged and released.• Witness your feelings. Emotions suck us in and inevitably color our judgment.But if you observe your emotions objectively, as passing events whose influencewill diminish over time, you can resist being drawn in by them.• Express your feelings. This means, first and foremost, expressing them toyourself when you know that they are negative and potentially destructive. Learnhow to release your negativity in private, and be diligent about it. Don’t letanger and resentment linger just because you have walked away. Unless youactively acknowledge and release them, they will build up and fester.• Take responsibility for what you feel. When someone else makes a mistake, itis her responsibility to correct it, but it is your responsibility to handle howyou feel about it—that emotion doesn’t belong to anyone but you. It often helpsto keep a journal of your emotional life, both positive and negative. Giveyourself credit when you’ve handled a tough situation without blowing up,blaming, or turning resentful. Take responsibility for the times when youremotions had an adverse effect on your leadership. Journals are good places tobe totally honest and admit your flaws, with the aim of improving on them.• Share your feelings with people you trust. Everyone needs a loved one or closeconfidant who will listen, understand, and offer a different view.• Find additional perspectives. Emotions are closely tied to beliefs, ego, andpast conditioning. When you get angry at someone, you are also saying, “I’mright.” Defuse this self-centered tendency by asking for as many viewpoints aspossible. Finding out what others think won’t make you wrong; it will broadenyour vistas.Doing these things is not just good for you. When you’re emotionally free, itmakes other people comfortable and happy to be around you. It energizes them,and encourages them to be clearer about their own feelings. Brain research showsthat mothers and children bond through a primal mechanism known as limbicresonance that entrains two brains: the same emotional centers of the brain, thelimbic region, are in sync, which leads to sharing biological rhythms, likeheart rate and respiration. If they are truly entrained, mother and child cansense what each other is feeling, and even thinking, without an exchange ofwords. The same mechanism remains intact as we mature; you can entrain withothers at a deep biological level, which includes sharing the openness ofemotional freedom. Otherwise, stress and hidden negativity can serve to pull twopeople apart.Shared Enthusiasm: Turn “this is great for me” into “this is great for all ofus.” Unless your enthusiasm reaches out to touch others, it may even have anegative effect. People aren’t moved to help a leader if they don’t think theyare also helping themselves. (You can’t help but wince and laugh at the smarmymanager in the television series The Office when he says, “The bad news is thatthere are going to be layoffs. The good news is that I’m being promoted.”) Besincere. Let your success be “our” success if it’s deserved. Otherwise, the bestmaxim is not to look great but to let others make you great.Genuine Caring for Others: Offering someone five minutes of praise and nodding“How’s it going?” when you pass in the hall isn’t the same as bonding. You haveto care. The same conditions that you care about in your life apply to others.Look the person in the eye, forget everything else, and respond naturally.Willingness to Build a Relationship: At bottom, all relationships are built onwhat two people have in common. The strongest adult bonds are between equals.You can’t be part of everyone’s family, but you can make others feel tied to youas a kindred spirit. At the soul level this is the only truth, because all soulsare equal. It’s the roles we play that enforce the illusion of inequality. As aleader, it’s your job to play a role, but you must be attentive to stepping outof your role once in a while. Make contact for the sheer pleasure of it, for thefun of spending time together.Reinforcing the Strengths of Others: Again and again it has been shown that thebest leaders focus on the strengths of their followers. They build a team byassessing who does what well. They encourage each person to develop his or herbest qualities. But that’s just the beginning. People want to be praised fortheir strengths, specifically and personally. Walking past a machine operatorand saying “Good job” is formulaic. Far better to know what he does well, pointit out, and show that the job was worth doing.Increasing the Self-esteem of Others: Self-esteem consists of three basicelements. People feel good about themselves, first, if they feel that they aredoing good work at a job that is worthwhile; second, if they developed apositive self-image while growing up; and third, if they are living up to theircore values. Knowing this, do your best to help those around you feel they areappreciated, and that they have every reason to appreciate themselves.Nonviolent Communication: Removing any sense of threat allows you to managesituations in a way that fulfills people’s needs. If you see stress, distrust,apathy, hidden hostility, or any other sign of resistance in the people you arecommunicating with, something is working against you on the emotional level. Allchange threatens the status quo. Inertia fights against vision. You can reducethe level of threat by looking at yourself closely and making sure that thefollowing things are true:You respect differences of opinion, even those that seem to undermine thesuccess of your vision.You don’t need others to change in order to be happy.You are coming from a place of peace.You genuinely want to understand why others are resisting you, without passingblame or judgment on them.You want change to benefit everyone, or as many people as possible.You can walk away from setbacks without being hostile to those who oppose youtoday—they may become your allies tomorrow.Conflict Resolution: We are all emotionally involved in our deepest beliefs.When two people cannot agree, the cause is almost always at the feeling level:someone is stuck. Negotiation is the only way to move them. When you cannegotiate with your opponents at the emotional level, the passion behind yourvision has a chance to speak to their hearts.Using emotional intelligence as a negotiating tool requires the following:You respect the opposition, and you see that they feel respected.You remain firm but flexible.You genuinely feel that the other side has a right to their position.Win-win is your ultimate goal. Everyone should walk away feeling they gainedsomething.You want the best for your opponents. Don’t aim to get the most from them interms of concessions.You remove right and wrong from your vocabulary during the negotiations. Like itor not, everyone around the table feels equally righteous.You see the other side of the coin, that every party feels equally aggrieved. Afeeling of injustice doesn’t exist on your side alone.You speak personally, from the heart. This requires you to present yourself in asimple, appropriate, and balanced way.Agree to forgive and to ask for forgiveness. Let the faults of others fade intothe past while taking the blame for your own faults here and now.Never turn the argument to ideology or religion. These are off limits, becauseno matter how diplomatic you may be, the other party will feel threatened.THE SEVEN SITUATIONSFeelings either fulfill a need or they don’t. A leader always keeps that inmind. She isn’t here to encourage any emotion for its own sake. Each of theseven situations presented in the first chapter has an emotional side that isthe best clue to the underlying need that must be filled. But you have torecognize it first.1. UNFILLED NEED: TO BE SAFE AND SECUREEmotions: Fear, anxiety, uncertainty, feeling threatenedYour strategy: Bring the group’s hidden anxiety out in the open. Provide yourpeople with reasons not to be afraid. Lay out a path that will lead tostability. Ask those who are strongest to share the source of their strength.Promise that everyone will get through the crisis, and keep that promise asquickly as you can. Offer reassurance and help through one-on-one connections.2. UNFILLED NEED: TO ACHIEVE, TO SUCCEEDEmotions: Lack of motivation, apathy, sense of failure and inadequacyYour strategy: Share your personal enthusiasm with the group. Reinforce theirsmall successes. Make it clear that all victories are “our” victories. Describethe new possibilities that are opening up. Specify how each person can succeedaccording to his or her strengths. Assign a single task or project that islikely to succeed, making sure it’s a success the person can be proud of.3. UNFILLED NEED: TO COOPERATE WITH OTHERSEmotions: Jealousy, resentment, divisiveness, selfishnessYour strategy: Locate one emotion that everyone can share (pride, self-worth,satisfaction in doing one’s best, mastery of a difficult task) and then ask foragreement on that feeling from everyone. Don’t give up until agreement isreached. Bring up the topic of divisiveness without assigning blame. Point outthe reasons why everybody wins if the group acts together. Be patient, but ifyou have to, weed out chronic complainers and backsliders. Negotiate differencesby bringing rivals together in private. Give strong negative feedback to anypublic display of fractiousness.4. UNFILLED NEED: TO NURTURE AND BE NURTURED, TO BELONGEmotions: Loneliness, isolation, feeling misunderstood and unheardYour strategy: Show that you care about everyone in the group. The whole groupis hurt when someone feels left out, but this feeling isn’t something to discusspublicly. Sit down in private with the alienated member and hear what she has tosay. Keep this contact going until she rejoins the group. Respect everyone’sright to privacy, but make it clear that participation is mandatory. Showpatience. Naturally, not everyone will participate to the same degree. Monitorthe wallflowers by asking if they agree, and how they feel. Engage them, butdon’t confront them directly (e.g., “Adam, want to join the rest of us?” “Itwould be great if you had an idea, Alicia.”). Instead, keep it simple andopen-ended (“Adam, how does all of this sit with you?” “I’d like to hear what’son everyone’s mind—Alicia?”).5. UNFILLED NEED: TO BE CREATIVE, TO GROWEmotions: Stagnatation, boredom, stifledness, feeling in a rutYour strategy: Openly acknowledge to the group that a fresh wind must blow. Settime aside for blue-sky sessions, where everyone can let imagination run free.Make it clear that good new ideas will be rewarded. Never put down any sign ofcreativity and imagination. Don’t point out obstacles, budgetary limits, orimpracticalities. Do surprising things that bring smiles. Say “astonish me” andmean it—you want everyone to stretch and feel safe when they do.6. UNFILLED NEED: TO BE GUIDED BY CORE VALUESEmotions: Guilt, emptiness, lack of guidance, aimlessnessYour strategy: Speak to the group from the heart. Inspire from the soul. Sharepersonal stories about peak experiences in your life. Ask for the same fromothers. Don’t step on other people’s moral values or act self-righteous aboutyours. Focus on the unlimited potential for growth in everyone. Put your highestvalues—compassion, love, loyalty, honesty, and integrity—into practice by actingas role model. If it seems appropriate, ask for group silence, meditation, orprayer. Don’t be afraid of an uplifting moment. Always be straightforward.Appreciate the innocence hidden in everyone.7. NEED: TO BE SPIRITUALLY FULFILLEDEmotions: Yearning, seeking, the desire for more from lifeYour strategy: The word strategy isn’t really appropriate in this case. You arehere to spread the light, and you do that by being in the light. You understandand accept all people. You feel compassion in all situations. Now you can spreadyour influence simply by being. If you have found your soul, your source in pureconsciousness, people will sense your state of bliss and unity, lifting theirspirits without effort on your part. Through you, they will sense that innerpeace and complete safety are possible.A ROSE CAN CHANGE A LIFELet me tell you a story about how I saw for myself the power of emotional bonds.When I was a boy growing up in India, my father was an army doctor stationed inJabalpur, a large town close to the center of the country. On one particular daythe whole of Jabalpur was aroused to a fever pitch by news of an impending visitby India’s prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. India had been born as a country in1947, just a few months after I was born, and as its first elected leader, Nehruwas somewhere between a father and a saint to the Indian people.As Nehru’s motorcade approached on the appointed day, a ripple of awe andexcitement ran through the streets as if Gandhi himself were coming, and indeedNehru had inherited Gandhi’s mantle. I remember our neighbors climbing lamppostsjust to catch a glimpse of Nehru’s car; treetops along the street sagged underthe weight of little boys hanging from their branches. My mother had dressed inher best sari, and it didn’t matter whom she had turned to—a maid, a bestfriend, or the wife of the head of hospital where my father worked—nobody couldtalk about anything but Nehru.When the motorcade finally wound its way through the streets, it passed directlyin front of our house. Then something remarkable happened. My mother had found aplace in the front of the crowd. Earlier she had confided to us that she wascertain Nehru would notice her among the tens of thousands thronging his route,and although we had teased her, her confidence remained unshaken. And when themoment came, she actually did catch Nehru’s eye! He paused for a second, andthen reached for the single red rose he always wore in his lapel. He tossed itto her. Even in all the tumult my mother caught it, and when the parade wasover, she took it inside and carefully placed it in her best vase.All that afternoon our house was filled with people coming over to marvel at therose, the kind you could buy in the market stalls for a few rupees. But becauseNehru had thrown it with his own hands, it had taken on his mystical status. Andbecause my mother had caught it, so had she. People who saw her every day nowlowered their voices to a whisper in her presence and looked on her withreverence. And when I looked at my mother, I saw that her brush with greatnessseemed to have given her a new sense of herself, too. At the day’s end Nehru’srose was saved for posterity, carefully pressed between the pages of a book likea sacred relic.Imagine yourself inspiring that kind of love and loyalty. It’s what everysuccessful visionary does.Political greatness comes to only a few, but most of us will find someleadership opportunities at our place of work, where it’s not unusual to find avacuum of emotional intelligence. In an extensive study of worker satisfaction,the Gallup research organization found that the workplace remains veryimpersonal. According to Gallup, just 17 percent of employees report that theirmanager “has made an investment in our relationship.” You don’t have to be theleader of a nation to heal this situation!SPIRITUAL INTELLIGENCEWith the last two needs—for higher guidance and for spiritual fulfillment—wemove beyond emotional intelligence. At this deeper level we are working in therealm of spiritual intelligence, which gets us in touch with love, compassion,joy, and inner peace. These values are transpersonal. They belong to humanity asa whole. Spiritual intelligence doesn’t address one specific situation. It’sabout finding the sacred in everyday life. You come from a place of love, joy,and equanimity because you are in touch with your own soul.Spiritual intelligence is a matter not of learning skills but of finding who youare at the soul level. We are all conscious; we all know what it’s like to haveinner peace, silence, trust, and joy. Where do these experiences come from? Ifthey come from the very core of our being, from the soul, then it’s only naturalto want to go there and experience ourselves.Exploring who you are at a deeper level than your everyday thoughts is the truedefinition of meditation. At the beginning it’s enough to practice a simplemeditation like the one that follows:MEDITATION ON THE BREATHSet aside twenty minutes in the morning and the evening when you can sit alonein a quiet place without being interrupted or disturbed. Turn off your phone andyour beeper. Close your eyes and do nothing for five minutes, letting yourbreathing rate settle naturally. Observe your mind chattering away, but don’tinteract with it. Let your thoughts and feelings simply be what they are.Now place your attention gently in the middle of your chest. As you do, followyour breath as it goes in and out. Feel each exhalation as if it were releasingthe breath from your whole body; feel each inhalation as if it were spreadingyour in-breath to every part of your body. Don’t impose a tempo on yourbreathing, fast or slow. Don’t try for deep or shallow breaths, but have theintention that over time your breathing will become subtler and more refined.Continue this meditation for fifteen minutes. It’s okay to fall asleep: thisjust means you have to catch up on your rest before you can meditate. At the endof the session, take a minute to come out of the meditative state; don’t jumpimmediately into action.Getting comfortable with this simple practice is taking the first big steptoward spiritual intelligence. By meditating every day, you will allow the soulto infuse daily life. As this happens, you will see a host of changes inyourself, such as:Unexpected moments of joyA sense of peace in the midst of activityThe ability to see yourself clearlyMore reasons to appreciate others, and fewer reasons to criticizeLess need to controlGreater trust that the right answers will appearA willingness to go with the flowA deep sense of belongingOnce you begin to have such experiences, you will effortlessly and naturallyextend them outside yourself. It will become clear to you that whatever isinside you must be inside everyone. At the level of the soul, everyone possessesthe same qualities. The spiritually intelligent leader acts on these qualitieseven when they may not be much in evidence. She gives each person space tochange. One might call this attitude “nurturing in silence.” At this point aleader has gone beyond the immediate situation; she is accepting fully the onerole that matters most, to be the soul of the group.When emotional intelligence merges with spiritual intelligence, human nature istransformed. Such a leader embodies what every wisdom tradition calls “thelight.” The light gives rise to love and compassion, even when the person showsno outward signs of acting from the soul. Rather, the invisible powers ofBeing—the pure consciousness at the base of all existence—begin to show thatthey are real. Struggle gives way to ease, and conflict yields to complete trustthat the best outcome will manifest. Your slightest desire is supported by theuniverse and made manifest. Every action is part of the flow of life. The firstday you meditate, you open a doorway to the light. You ask your soul for moreawareness, and your wish is granted. The soul is nothing but light, yet that isa metaphor—the real substance of the soul is awareness.Awareness is unlimited. The emotional bonds that link you to another person arebonds of light. At the soul level you are already united. Your role as a leaderis to help others see that this is so.THE LESSONS OF EMOTIONAL BONDING * Leading from the soul means bonding with others so that they want to share in your vision and be fulfilled through your shared success. * Once you value emotional intelligence, you can learn the skills that bond people together. This requires you to build relationships and give of yourself. * As a leader from the soul, you perceive the emotions hidden in any situation and show how to repair them. You know with certainty that everyone is already bonded at the soul level.WHAT TO DO TODAYEmotional intelligence grows through perception. Look around at your presentsituation (at work, in the family, with close friends) and observe it from thelevel of feeling. Your heart will tell you when other people are emotionallydistant from you. The signs are hidden or obvious tension; the other peopledon’t seem relaxed; they don’t laugh with you, or look you in the eye. Theydon’t seem to want to be around you or share in your success. How can you turnthis distance into a bond?Today your assignment is to take on the task of changing the emotional tone inyour life wherever it isn’t working. Look at the behaviors listed below. Pickone to apply today, and over the course of the next month choose each of the tenbehaviors at least once.CLOSING THE GAPTEN BEHAVIORS FOR MENDING EMOTIONAL DISTANCE 1. Notice where another person is strong or talented, and point it out to him. 2. Compliment him on getting better at something. 3. Praise him without expecting praise in return. 4. Go along with his wishes when it feels right in your heart. 5. If the heat gets to be too much, walk away, but then come back in a conciliatory mood. 6. Own your own feelings. Nobody else does. And accept that you don’t own the other person’s feelings: he does. 7. Don’t bring up sensitive issues when they could be embarrassing (especially in front of other people or the whole group). 8. Before bringing up a personal issue, wait until you’re in a good emotional place, and then make sure the other person is in a good place, too. 9. Avoid stale rituals. If you find yourself saying the same rote things day after day, that’s a ritual, not a genuine response. Find something new to say, and some new way to show you care. 10. Find one thing every day to forgive the other person for. Don’t let him know what it is; just forgive him, and let it go.As you apply these behaviors on a daily basis, turning emotional distance into abond, be easy with yourself and with the other person. Be sincere; don’t overdoit. Above all, don’t do it because you want to be right or to prove that you canmake someone like you; your aim is more objective than that. You aim to developthe emotional intelligence necessary to go beyond your old unhealthy patterns.To value emotional bonding is to bring yourself and someone you care about infrom the cold, even if it doesn’t directly benefit you.Emotionally speaking, you have only three kinds of situations with people: thoseyou can fix, those you put up with, and those you must walk away from. As aleader, it’s your duty to find as many ways to fix a situation as you can. Mostpeople put up with too much, and when they reach a point of unbearablefrustration, they walk out. By contrast, you can fix a situation throughemotional intelligence and skillful coping with emotions. By closing the gapthat isolates people from one another, you are proving that the emotional sideof life can be fruitful. Overcoming our fear and inner resistance leads toshared joy."},{"pageContent":"THREEA = AWARENESSAwareness is the birthplace of possibility. Everything you want to do,everything you want to be, starts here. To be a successful visionary, you mustbe as aware as possible. At every moment, many paths lead forward. Awarenesstells you which is the right one to take.As a leader, your own awareness affects everyone around you. Those whom you leadand serve depend on your grasp of the situation. You must reach inside for theright response. You alone can raise the group’s awareness from lower needs tohigher needs. To do that, you first must fulfill each need in yourself.Awareness is a synonym for consciousness. There is no limit to what you canchange, because consciousness brings light to every aspect of life. But if yourconsciousness is constricted, everything else will be, too. On the other hand,if you are in a state of expanded awareness, everything else will expand. Themost ancient wisdom traditions say, “Know that one thing by which all else isknown.” That one thing is consciousness itself. Nothing has a greater power oftransformation.Awareness is the birthplace of possibility. Everything you want to achievebegins here. As a new idea arises, it must gather power and influence. Otherpeople must want to support it: the means to turn vision into reality must cometo hand. All of these things depend on your awareness, because the moment youhave a new idea, many paths lead to the future. At a deep place inside you, theright path calls out. The successful visionary looks inside, day after day, tofind the next step in that path. For her, success is an evolving journey.Awareness isn’t the same as thinking. The world is so complex that the rationalmind cannot calculate all the possibilities in a given situation. Instinctively,we all know this. Therefore we don’t really use logic and reason the way we saywe do. We make our decisions intuitively, and afterward we bring in logic andreason to justify our choices. This doesn’t mean that logic isn’t valuable. Itmeans that we use much more of our awareness than we realize.Brain research shows that even in the simplest decisions, many centers of thebrain are involved, particularly the emotional centers. When you look at abanana in the grocery store, a cashmere scarf in a department store, or a usedcar at a dealership, you may be silently calculating what you think is a fairprice. Within seconds you will have made a judgment, yet you are barely aware,if at all, of what your brain has done. One shopper will think it’s fair to paytwo dollars a pound for organic bananas while another will pass them by at thatprice. If asked why, each could probably give you a reason, but at the moment ofdecision, multiple influences were at work. It would take a long time toverbalize these processes, even without accounting for how they intermingle andweigh against one another.As a leader, you must make decisions the way a shopper chooses bananas, usingmany centers of your brain. Most leadership training programs hold the oppositeto be true. Reason and logic are purported to dominate; 90 percent of decisionmaking is supposedly based on analysis. But behavioral research indicates thatwhen we make decisions, much more is going on in the brain.In one experiment, subjects were shown photos with strong emotional content,both positive and negative (a newborn baby, a wedding, a train wreck, a battlescene). Their brains were being scanned, and the photos lit up the emotionalcenter of the brain, the amygdala. Then the subjects were asked how much theywould be willing to pay for simple household items. Consistently, these subjectswere willing to pay much more than subjects who hadn’t been emotionallystimulated beforehand. And this held true whether the photos had arousedpositive or negative emotions. Feeling happier made them willing to pay up tothree and four times what they would normally pay, but so would feelingdepressed. Even more telling, the experimenters could not eliminate theemotional influence on decisions, no matter how hard they tried. The ideal ofthe completely rational solution is an illusion.This is probably a very good thing, for if you could rely solely on reason andlogic, you would be depriving yourself of the unseen power of your awareness.Awareness is a synonym for consciousness. In the world’s great spiritualtraditions, consciousness is considered an attribute of God and is thereforeinfinite and omnipresent. The divine sees and knows everything. That is why theVedic sages of India instruct us to “know that one thing by which all else isknown.” They are referring to consciousness. Yet even in secular terms, throughbrain studies like the one described above, we know that consciousness is vastand largely untapped. The thinking mind is only the tip of the iceberg.THE SEVEN ATTRIBUTES OF CONSCIOUSNESSAlthough you can only think about one thing at a time, your awareness issilently functioning on many levels. A leader takes full advantage of this factby speaking to those hidden levels. Consciousness delivers the followingpersonal attributes, in ascending order:CenterednessSelf-motivationCoherenceIntuition, insightCreativityInspirationTranscendenceYou may recognize that these attributes match the seven needs that a leader mustfulfill. The best leaders are always a step ahead of the group in the hierarchyof needs. When the group is beginning to feel safe and secure, the leader isalready thinking about achievement. When the group is starting to enjoy success,the leader is already thinking about team building, and so on up the ladder. Thegreatest leaders are tuned in to all seven levels, which prepares them for anysituation in advance. If you aspire to lead from the soul, you must havepersonal experience of these seven attributes of consciousness.Centeredness: Awareness is stable and secure within itself, needing no supportfrom the outside. When you are in contact with this quality, you are unshakablein a crisis. While others around you feel insecure and unsafe, you are centered.In this hour of need, you are prepared to relieve the anxiety of those aroundyou and bring out their best qualities.Self-motivation: Awareness is imbued with the quality of self-referral, whichmeans that it finds everything it needs within itself. From this inner source ofawareness, confidence and energy come naturally, and the supply of both isendless. When you are in contact with this quality of awareness, you have nodoubt that success is possible. While others see danger, you see hiddenopportunities. This ability to unfold a path to success prepares you to leadwhen achievement is the main goal.Coherence: Awareness is orderly and self-organizing. It receives streams of rawinput from the five senses and forms them into a coherent picture of the world.When you are in contact with this quality, you can inspire others to cometogether around your vision—whether it’s building a new teen center in town,reorganizing the local PTA thrift shop, or training animals to visit sickchildren in hospital to give them a lift. In place of confusion and conflict,you see a clear, united purpose. This ability makes you a leader capable ofbringing people together in support of your idea.Intuition, insight: Awareness is always observing. It’s observing you readingthese words right now. But unlike your everyday torrent of thoughts, thisawareness is unclouded by personal bias; it sees reality instead of illusion.When you are aware, you understand the situation directly, without having tothink too much. Insight comes spontaneously. You are adept at dealing withpeople because you understand what they need—perhaps more clearly than they dothemselves. This makes you a leader when the goal is to make each person feelunderstood and listened to.Creativity: Awareness is the meeting point between the unknown and the known. Itconverts dim possibilities into new realities. When you are aware, you feelcomfortable with uncertainty—you thrive on it, in fact, because you realize thatunpredictability is part of the very fabric of being. It is the essence ofinnovation, and you love to explore and discover new ways of doing things. Whenyou are aware, you can lead others by encouraging them to see beyond the oldways of doing things, and you can offer them the sheer excitement of replacingtheir outworn perspectives.Inspiration: Awareness is rooted in love, compassion, faith, and virtue.According to some of the great wisdom traditions, everything that exists arisesfrom an endless sea of awareness, or consciousness. That is also true of thesefundamental human qualities. We may lose sight of them, but they are no lessthere. No one had to invent love and compassion: they arise from that sea ofconscious awareness. When you are aware, you can inspire others. You help themsee their better selves, and by doing so, you lift them up. At a time whenpeople hunger for personal transformation and redemption, you are well placed tomake a difference.Transcendence: Awareness ultimately has no boundaries. It exists in this worldbut endlessly goes beyond it. The world’s great wisdom traditions all derivefrom a higher reality that is indescribable but can be experienced. This is thegreatest wonder and source of awe. As the ancient India sages declare, “Thisisn’t knowledge that you learn. It’s knowledge that you become.” When you fullyabsorb this insight, you know what it means to transcend. You don’t need totravel anywhere; all of reality exists in you. You exemplify wholeness becauseyou are united with everything and everyone around you. You exist to demonstratethat human beings can reach the infinite, and by simply being who you are, youhelp others get there.RAISING THE GROUPAs a leader, you try to raise group consciousness from its present level to thenext highest one in the hierarchy. This process is cumulative—it works only ifit can build on the previous step—so make sure to start at the beginning. Don’ttake anything for granted. Step by step, you can unfold the seven attributes ofconsciousness, as follows:Centeredness: This silent aspect of consciousness gives us a strong sense ofself. When a group is at this level, everyone feels secure.Exercise: One of the simplest techniques for becoming centered uses bodyawareness. Ask the group to sit still and take a moment to get in touch withtheir bodies, to relax into the simple state of being physically present. Askthe group to become aware of areas of comfort and discomfort.As a variation on this basic technique, ask the group to sit quietly and becomeaware of their breathing. Ask people to pay attention, gently and easily, totheir breath as it flows in and out. Another alternative is to become aware ofthe heart. Ask them to sit quietly and to bring their focus, easily and gently,on the area of the chest beneath the breastbone. The aim here isn’t to listen totheir heartbeat, but to be in contact with the heart as a center of emotion. Letwhatever feelings or sensations that arise be what they are. If you feelself-conscious about leading a group in this way, you can show people theseexercises in one-on-one sessions. There are very few groups that wouldn’tbenefit from these techniques for becoming more centered, which also have thebeneficial effect of reducing stress.Self-motivation: This aspect of consciousness inspires achievement. When a grouprises to this level, everyone feels that they have an equal opportunity tosucceed.Exercise: Announce that the best motivation is to work from each person’sstrengths, and to do that, we need to know what those strengths are. Divide thegroup into pairs, handing out pencil and paper. Have each partner write downthree strengths she sees in the other person. To get things rolling, offer somepossibilities: “My partner is good at coming up with ideas, making others feelcomfortable, scheduling and organization, being productive, meeting deadlines,negotiation, persuasion, innovation, etc.” If people are new to the group, havethem write down their own strengths.After five minutes have the pairs exchange lists. The two partners will nowdiscuss the strengths that were noted. Modify these if there are doubts ordisagreements. Then have the pairs draw up action plans that would maximizethose strengths. (A simple format would be: “To better use my strength, which is_______, I suggest the following: __________.”) The goal here is to match eachperson with what she is best at, and then to show that you intend to utilize herstrengths. This is an effective way to spark motivation. When someone feels thather strengths have been recognized and will be put to use, her motivation toperform will naturally increase.Coherence: This aspect of consciousness bridges differences. Group coherencemeans that everyone is pulling together and shares the same goals.Exercise: Realistically, it’s not easy to get a fractured, divided group to pulltogether into a cohesive team. But you don’t have to accomplish this right away.Instead, ask the team to divide into pairs of their own choosing. Each pair willwork as a partnership. They don’t have to share the same tasks, but they willshare everything else, from positive things (like the progress being made) tonegative things (like frustration and obstacles to progress). Each person willthus be a sounding board and a source of feedback.The point isn’t to assign one person’s work to two but to create a bond betweenpartners who care, help, and share. At their first meeting, each pair shouldagree on what benefit they want to get from being partners. They should meetonce a day for a few minutes if possible, or at least three times a week. At theend of the week the whole group gets together for an informal verbal report onhow each pair is doing. Then the group can move on to a general discussion ofhow their overall goal is coming along. By using pairs instead of trying tobring coherence to a large group, you are creating bonds at the most personallevel.Intuition, insight: This aspect of consciousness generates empathy. When a grouprises to this level, each person feels understood.Exercise: Divide the group into pairs again, putting together people who are notclose friends. (There’s a reason for this.) In fact, strangers would be the bestchoice, if possible. Sitting quietly in relative privacy, each person tells theother something he has never told anyone before. It shouldn’t be a deep, darksecret or a source of guilt and shame—more like something that has been on hismind that he hasn’t had a chance to say. The next step is to discuss eachother’s disclosure. One person may ask the other for advice with whatever issuehe’s raised, but that’s not necessary. The point of the exercise is to be heardand understood.As the leader, you may feel that sharing confidences is too personal. In thatcase, have each pair fill in the blank in the following sentence: “The thing Iwant others to understand about me is ___________.” All but the most reservedperson will be happy to answer this question. To follow up, meet again as pairsa week later and discuss whether each person feels more understood.Creativity: This aspect of consciousness unfolds the future in new ways. When agroup rises to this level, it embraces the new.Exercise: Creativity is an aspect of personal freedom, so find out if the peoplein your group feel free to let their creative juices flow. Hand out thefollowing self-assessment, asking each person to fill it out anonymously.CREATIVITY QUESTIONNAIREPart 1: In the interests of making our team more creative, please answer thefollowing questions by circling Yes, No, or Neutral.Yes No Neutral The rules are loose enough for me to breathe. Yes NoNeutral I’m appreciated. Yes No Neutral There is minimal pressure to conform.Yes No Neutral Things are not too organized. Yes No Neutral People are havingfun around here. Yes No Neutral New ideas excite those in charge. Yes No NeutralNew ideas move up the ladder quickly. Yes No Neutral Risk is equated withreward. Yes No Neutral I’m allowed to be independent in choosing assignments.Yes No Neutral There’s room for play. Yes No Neutral I am given time to myself.Yes No Neutral I admire what the group stands for.Part 2: Choosing from the above list, rank in order the three things that wouldenable you to be more creative.#1 ______________________________#2 ______________________________#3 ______________________________Collect the questionnaires and tote up the number of Yes, No, and Neutralresponses for each item. At the same time, list the three choices in Part 2 thatgot the most votes. The next time the group meets, hand out the results fordiscussion. You will have a good snapshot of how creative everyone feels. Youshould also have a good idea of where the quickest improvements can be made.Inspiration: This aspect of consciousness brings about inner change. When agroup rises to this level, all the members feel that they have found their truecalling.Exercise: The longest-lasting inspiration comes from within. Ask each person tocome up with a role model or archetype whom he or she finds truly inspiring, andto write down the person’s name. The aim is to help people express the samequalities of that archetype. For example, one quality may be the love embodiedin Jesus, the compassion of Buddha, the peaceful strength of Gandhi, the wisdomof Athena, the power of Wonder Woman. Have them write down the specificqualities that are most precious to them in their archetypes. Ask them to becomethe incarnation of these qualities.Here’s my own personal program for inspiration. I have set aside a special placein my home for meditation, and there I surround myself with images of myarchetype. (Actually, I have several archetypes, one of which is Krishna, theHindu deity.) When I finish my daily meditation, I open my eyes and look atthese images, focusing on Krishna’s strength, love, and all-encompassing wisdom.Quietly I ask for these qualities to increase in me. Knowing that all archetypesare symbols of consciousness, I am using Krishna to stand in for aspects of myown awareness. It is these aspects that I want to increase.As you can see, this exercise isn’t directly related to a project or group goal.But if your group has risen to the level where everyone is comfortable revealingtheir need for higher guidance, they can share their own inspiring stories ofpersonal growth and cherished role models. At this point every aspect ofconsciousness is being enhanced because the closer you get to the soul level,the more the invisible power of awareness can benefit you.Transcendence: This aspect of consciousness brings liberation. When a grouprises to this level, enlightenment is their shared goal.Exercise: Traditionally, people reach enlightenment through spiritualdiscipline, most especially through long, deep meditation. Nothing could be moreindividual. But three aspects of the spiritual path can be shared veryproductively:Be of service together.Share wisdom together.Become a community in spirit.Every wisdom tradition has espoused these three practices, which reflect thesame thing, really: the knowledge that each of us is more than our limited mindand body; we are part of the infinite consciousness that generates and governsthe universe. Therefore each practice is a way of going beyond the small,limited self.When you are of service, you value others as you value yourself, making theirneeds your own. When you share wisdom—through reading and contemplating theworld’s scriptures—you show that your real allegiance is to the soul. When youorganize as a community in spirit, you declare that living from the level of thesoul can peacefully unite people from any background. The overall effect is torise to a higher level of existence, the level embodied by the greatest saintsand sages. They represent the ultimate in successful visionaries.AWARENESS CAN TRANSFORMNothing has more power to transform than awareness. When you become completeinside yourself, the worst conditions in the world don’t matter. A few years agoI took a boat to Robben Island, which lies off Cape Town, South Africa.Continuously pounded by an Atlantic surf heavy enough to break apart any shipunlucky enough to run aground on it, this island was once considered the perfectplace to isolate lepers. A prison was built there for political prisoners, oneof whom would be Nelson Mandela.In 1964 Mandela was convicted of sabotage and of taking part in variousantiapartheid activities. Fortunate to escape hanging, he received a sentence oflife imprisonment instead. Today visitors can see for themselves the tiny jailcell with its iron cot where Nelson Mandela spent eighteen years of his life.The only other furniture is a small table and a covered can that served as atoilet.Walking around the prison grounds, which are now preserved as a memorial to thefreedom movement, one still feels the heavy air of oppression. Daily life forMandela was the lowest of the low. Because his offense was political, andbecause he was black, Mandela was given the worst and most meager rations. Forthe first fifteen years of his imprisonment, before he was given a bed, he slepton the floor. He performed hard labor in a limestone quarry, and he was allowedone letter and one visitor every six months.How did such a great leader emerge from such inhuman conditions? To speak ofordinary motivation would be to miss the point. Motivation temporarily raisesyour spirits, but it is difficult to sustain. Inspiration is more durable, andMandela’s inspiration came from his remarkable awareness, which he chose todevelop further during his ordeal. Mandela went into prison as a hot-headedrebel who condoned violence. He emerged after twenty-seven years a transformedman, still firm in his intentions, but having renounced violence and havingtranscended the pitfalls of hatred and bitterness. Guided by his enlightenedconsciousness, the African National Conference shifted its emphasis away fromblack domination and toward the creation of a united country that included allraces, with malice toward none.As the father of a free South Africa, which was born without the bloodbath thathad always been predicted, Mandela rose to the stature of a secular saint. Butthe personal qualities he developed sprang from a source we all have in common:awareness. This is the source of insight, nurturing, inspiration, andtranscendence—all qualities that emerge when a leader’s awareness expands. Theyare available to you, too. The seeds of greatness were planted in you the verymoment you were granted consciousness. If you follow the inward path using truthand clarity as your compass points, the outer world cannot help but respond toyour intention. Its exact responses may be unpredictable, but through itssupport the rightness of the path will be proved to you again and again.THE LESSONS OF AWARENESS * Leading from the soul means expanding your awareness in order to meet the needs of others. As you become more aware, invisible powers begin to support your vision. * Consciousness has its own innate qualities. Once you cultivate them in yourself, you can raise the consciousness of those you lead and serve. * The ultimate goal of awareness is to be transformed. Beyond any specific desire is the overarching need to become completely liberated. When you reach that point, you and your vision are one.WHAT TO DO TODAYAwareness is innate—you don’t have to seek it outside yourself. But expandedawareness must be cultivated. Today you can start out on the path to unlimitedawareness. The steps are simple, as you’ll see below. You don’t have to adoptthe whole program all at once. Return to this section as a road map. Whereveryou are starting from, the path to higher consciousness is always open.YOUR AWARENESS PROGRAMStop struggling.Keep listening to your inner voice.Meditate in order to reach the core of your awareness.Test your boundaries.Remain centered.Look beyond your personal beliefs.Gather information from every source.Learn to have clear intentions.Value inner peace.Even though awareness is invisible, taking these steps will make the benefits ofexpanded awareness evident very quickly. Let’s take a close look at each ofthese ways to expand your awareness.Stop struggling: The first step is to realize that life isn’t meant to be astruggle, and what makes a leader isn’t toughness in the face of obstacles.Rather, you could help others see that it is possible to find support withinthemselves, taking advantage of the smoothest, shortest, and least effortful wayto reach results. Until you actually test a new way of doing things—the way ofexpanded awareness—you will only be putting window dressing on your old beliefsystem.Keep listening to your inner voice: No matter how skilled you become at dealingwith challenges, in the end every decision gets tested inside. Whether you callit listening to your gut or obeying that little voice inside you, the process isthe same. But not every inner voice is the same, or equally reliable. A leaderpierces through layers of secondhand opinion, stress, anxiety, groupthink, andthe welter of opinions both within and without. Only when she finds the voiceinside herself that is almost silent has she located the voice that should belistened to. Start finding that voice today.Meditate to reach the core of your awareness: The practice of meditation hasenormous implications for awareness. Waiting inside you is a level of silentbeing. It is the source of your awareness and the womb of creation. Allsolutions exist here, as well as all possibilities. When you meditate and reachthis level of yourself, something magical happens. All boundaries disappear. Ifyou could maintain this boundless state permanently, you would achieveenlightenment, which is nothing more than residing in the state of pureawareness, where all possibilities coexist in this moment and in every moment.Although very few of us ever attain enlightenment, you and I can stillexperience that boundless state for a brief time. Every visit to this level ofyour consciousness refreshes your mind and body like nothing else.Test your boundaries: Becoming more aware is an internal process, but thatdoesn’t mean it’s passive. Meditation and turning within can also serve as verypowerful agents of change in the outside world. They can significantly improveyour life, as well as help you fulfill the needs of others. When you step out ofyour meditation and back into the arena of stress, turbulence, emotionalconflict, confusion, and competition, do so with this intention: I want to seewhat I am made of. What you are made of isn’t a given. It changes every day. Andyet the underlying aspect of awareness remains ever the same.I am not suggesting that you plunge into ordeals that will overwhelm yourawareness. Testing means checking a boundary to see if it has moved. Even aslight shift is enough. You don’t have to overcome massive resistance or proveyourself. Quite the opposite, in fact—what you’re doing here is expanding yourcomfort zone. As awareness expands, so do the areas in which you feel strong,confident, and capable.Remain centered: Your center is your place of power. When you remain there, theuniverse will channel everything you need. It’s as if your actions weresuperfluid, a term used in physics to describe the state of no resistance and nofriction. Leaders who handle crises exceptionally well aren’t keeping theirheads so much as they are keeping centered. How is that done? First you need toknow what it feels like to be centered, if you don’t already. As discussed,meditation is a good way to experience this state. Being centered comesnaturally to all of us, and you can recognize it by the following indications:Your mind is quiet. Mental chatter is gone.You feel safe and confident.Your mood is carefree.You have a strong sense of being.You feel a quiet but intense energy from being alive.Your attention is fully in the present moment.Everyone has experienced such a state from time to time. It’s up to you tocultivate it. Then when you find yourself in difficult situations, when thereare forces pulling you in all directions, you can locate the quiet zone insidethat you have grown familiar with. You will have access to your place of power,the still point in a turning world.Look beyond your personal beliefs: The stronger your beliefs, the narrower yourviewpoint. Strongly held beliefs are a sign of restrictive boundaries andconstricted awareness. We all harbor a mental image of leaders being pillars ofstrength who cannot be shaken from their core beliefs, and in some situations,such as wars or major political upheavals, such leaders may be necessary. But inthe end it’s the person who is flexible, who can see the situation from allsides and is alert to subtle changes, who succeeds best. Being able to seebeyond your personal beliefs is a vital step in actually going beyond thoseboundaries. Your attitude should be “I think I’m right, but that doesn’t mean Isee the whole picture.”Gather information from every source: There’s a big difference between beingcentered and being self-centered. When you are centered, information flows infrom all directions. You function as the switchboard, gathering as manyviewpoints as you can. But when you are self-centered, ego takes over. Youbecome convinced that your idea must be the best simply because it’s yours. Atfirst this is a difficult distinction to make. Most leaders are afraid to seemweak or uncertain. They place such a high value on being decisive that they findit hard to take in other opinions. But the more viewpoints you absorb, the wideryour awareness will be.A great leader practices what appears to be a peculiar kind of alchemy. Helistens to everyone around him, taking in all each has to offer; but when itcomes time to make a final decision, he stands behind it with total conviction.There is no magic involved, actually. If you are centered, you won’t be shakenby contending opinions; you will become wiser for them. If you aren’t centered,the opposite happens: the more voices you listen to, the more you vacillate. Asa leader, you must learn that if you want to avoid indecision, the answer isn’tto make up your mind alone and insist on your way or the highway. The answer isto become open to all influences, but be swayed by none.Learn to have clear intentions: A good leader is comfortable giving orders andhaving them carried out. A great leader goes one step further: he has anintention, takes steps to realize it, and then lets go of the outcome. Action isstill required. You don’t just make a wish and blow out a candle. But because itresides at the deepest level of awareness, intention is a very powerful thing.Having expressed a completely clear intention from the deepest level ofawareness, or consciousness, you expect the forces of nature to support you, andas they do, you obey the signals that the situation sends to you. Perhaps youwill have to do very little, or you may have to fight against tremendous odds.Both extremes are possible. But what is really happening is that your intentionis leading to a result.Our society, which is materialistic, doesn’t teach us that intentions have theirown power, although we are told to “follow our dreams,” which is roughly what aclear intention is—a core desire, or dream, that leads you on day by day. Beyondthis vague notion of following a dream, you must realize that intentions cometrue when the following conditions are ripe:You desire from a deep level of awareness.Your desire is true to who you are.You trust that the universe can bring about the result you want.You let go and don’t force the issue.You resolve your inner conflict and confusion.You remain alert to receive any feedback, however faint.You tune in to find out what is needed next.Rarely when you put in a penny does the candy machine spit out the reward youseek (although sometimes things turn out this way). The path to making anydesire come true is to be aware every step of the way. Begin to walk this pathnow. Small intentions lead the way, but even the greatest wishes are achievedthrough the same steps.Value inner peace: In this society we proudly announce how much coffee we drink,and we celebrate our status as adrenaline junkies. Surrounded by chaos andstress, people often mistake being excited for truly feeling alive. There’s nodenying that a surge of adrenaline can give you a great high—for a few hours. Asthe adrenaline ebbs, however, body and mind are exhausted, and over time thenegative effects of stress take their toll. It’s a dead-end strategy to thinkthat you must be as amped up as your surroundings. Nobody thrives on stress, nomatter how convinced they are otherwise. The most productive state of being ispeace. Many leaders find this hard to learn. They trade the present for thefuture, throwing themselves into chaotic situations with a promise that one day,years from now, they will have time to rest.This is a devil’s bargain. Peace is either here in this moment or it doesn’texist. By peace I don’t mean passivity. Peace has nothing to do with lethargy orlack of involvement. True peace is a vibrant state. It’s alive with potentialand the expectation of great things to come. It’s the moment just before birthbrings new life. The first step to achieving such peace is to value it.Awareness brings you more of whatever you value—that’s a basic rule ofconsciousness. So by valuing the state of peace with its inner silence, youinvite it to become part of your daily life.As your awareness expands, you will become of greater service to the world.Because we are so used to leaders being authority figures, it’s hard to acceptthat to lead is to serve. But this becomes second nature once you realize thatservice isn’t self-sacrifice—it’s the effortless expression of your state ofawareness. (I’m reminded of an aphorism, “I can’t hear what you’re sayingbecause who you are is deafening.”) So who are you? You are your awareness, inevery fiber of your being."},{"pageContent":"FOURD = DOINGA leader is action-oriented. Only through action can you bring a vision to life.But vision and action must be compatible; to make them so requires skill. Thatskill begins with walking the walk, energizing others around you, and recruitingthem to your mission.Every situation calls out for the right action. As a leader, you must identifythe role you are expected to play. If you are aware, your role will call out toyou. Successful visionaries are able to fulfill any role—their flexibility comesfrom the soul’s infinite flexibility.Doing is different when you lead from the soul. It turns into nondoing, which isthe same as allowing. You step aside and let your soul act through you, withoutstruggle, worry, or resistance. Nondoing isn’t the same as doing nothing. It’sthe most powerful way to lead, because you trust that your soul wants to bringthe best possible outcome. Your role is to tune in and witness how perfectlylife can organize itself when the soul is in charge.We have been focusing on the vision aspect of “successful visionary,” but therecan be no success without action. Once a leader points the way, everyone isexpected to follow her direction. The burden of leadership is that outcomes arealways unpredictable. The most common complaint one hears from leaders is thatevery minute of the day they must choose between one course of action andanother. This leaves them almost no time to cultivate the deepest level of theself. In a world where the future cannot be controlled, however, it’s foolhardyto ignore the very source of action, which is the core of one’s being, the soul.By now you are far ahead of most leaders. You’ve learned the hidden power ofemotional bonding, and you know the value of expanded awareness. Your actions,when grounded this deeply, will come directly from your vision. But you alsoface the challenge of making your actions as effective as possible. Doing is askill. It is based on five steps that make the difference between success andfailure. Whenever you are in a position to lead:1. Be action-oriented. The atmosphere around you must be dynamic. Everyone inthe group should feel energized by the call to action.2. Act as a role model. Be willing to do the same things you ask others to do.That way you will recruit others to act. A leader doesn’t have to perform thejobs he assigns; if you can, however, that’s a great advantage. A leader servesas a role model in giving of himself completely.3. Commit yourself to good, honest feedback. Show that you want to hear thetruth, and when you give feedback to others, be candid but positive. Emphasizetheir contributions first and foremost.4. Be persistent. There will always be setbacks and obstacles. The course of anysignificant project never ran smoothly. When others are secretly worrying aboutfailure, your unflagging persistence is a strong asset.5. Take time to celebrate. Every time there’s a significant achievement, createan atmosphere of celebration around it. Work and nothing but work willeventually deplete people’s enthusiasm. By celebrating signposts along the wayto final success, you give everyone a taste of that success in advance.A visionary leader won’t be satisfied with building a team of competent, skilledpeople. Important as that surely is, it’s even more vital to show the group—andthe world at large—that your actions are authentic. Every time you stand up in agroup, you affirm the truth voiced by Italo Magni, prize-winning public speaker:“If you’re talking with your head, you’re going to speak to their heads. Ifyou’re talking with your heart, you’re going to reach their hearts. If you talkwith your life, you’re going to reach their lives.”You can put these words can be put into practice immediately. Bring your grouptogether, and in front of everyone, make a personal commitment. Promise toinvest time, attention, energy, personal contact, and funding (if that isappropriate). Be specific. This isn’t a pep talk or a moment in the limelight.Your group deserves to know exactly how invested you are.Now go around the room and ask each person to make his or her own commitment.Ask what they are willing to invest. When everyone has done so, you have aworking plan for action. As progress is being made, follow upon everyone’scommitment. Carry through with all the resources you promised to invest. Recallthat only 20 percent of people in the workplace report that their boss iswilling to invest in a relationship with them. Nothing is more important if youwant to recruit others to act.Make sure that you keep the group abreast of every step of progress along theway to your goal. Make sure everyone realizes that you value feedback. And makesure that no one is left out of the loop.RIGHT ACTION IN EVERY SITUATIONIf you are aware, every situation will tell you which path is right and which iswrong. Each of the seven situations that we’ve been discussing calls for its ownkind of action.1. Protector: Your role is crisis manager. As a role model, you show confidenceand strength. You walk the walk by going to the center of the crisis andremaining there as long as it takes. You look for constant feedback as to howthe crisis is shifting. Your persistence ensures that every aspect of the crisisis being attended to, overlooking no foreseeable possibilities. When the crisisis past, your whole team celebrates by embracing those who were saved fromthreat, bringing them to a feeling of safety, and releasing the tension andstress that every crisis creates.2. Achiever: Your role is motivator. As a role model, you are the winner, theone who competes successfully. You walk the walk by bringing tangible rewards tothe whole group, not just yourself. You look for stories of success, but you arealso alert to the things people are less willing to share: their doubts andobstacles that block the way to success. You persist in the face of competitionand setbacks, which are inevitable. You encourage the group to realize thatevery challenge can be met. When success is finally achieved, you celebrate bysharing the credit and the rewards, pointing out each person’s uniquecontribution and allowing exultation to have its day.3. Team Builder: Your role is negotiator. As a role model, you convince thegroup that you support shared goals instead of rivalries and factions. You walkthe walk by being fair and just, showing no favoritism. The feedback you lookfor is agreement. Disagreement is inevitable, and you remain alert for potentialcracks in the group so that you can heal them before they turn into rifts. Youpersist by reconciling differences, even though each party may be stubborn andstuck in its own position. When you have achieved group unity, you celebrate byrelaxing as a group outside work, finding an activity that everyone can enjoytogether. Let the group feel its solidarity without the pressure of a deadlineto meet.4. Nurturer: Your role is counselor. As a role model, you express sympathy andunderstanding to anyone who comes to you in trouble or need. You walk the walkby never judging; your empathy extends to everyone, because everyone goesthrough tough times. The feedback you look for is any sign that people feellistened to and understood. On the other hand, you are also alert to anyone wholooks disengaged or alienated from the group. You persist by following up withthe people who need you, keeping tabs on how they are doing, and committingyourself to building a real relationship. Celebration takes place one person ata time, when you are able to share another’s intimate joys and steps towardhealing.5. Innovator: Your role is catalyst. As a role model, you encourage new ideasand show that you are comfortable with the unknown—in fact, it excites you. Youwalk the walk by creating a space for creativity to flourish, and by nurturingthe first sprouts of a promising discovery. The feedback you are looking for isany sign of a breakthrough. You keep your antennae out for signs of progress,steering the group away from dead ends and unpromising lines of inquiry. Whenthe breakthrough has been made, you celebrate by appreciating as a group thebeauty and wonder of being pioneers.6. Transformer: Your role is inspirer. As a role model, you exemplify a highercalling, and your voice amplifies the inner voice that calls every person to betransformed. You walk the walk by upholding the values you preach. The feedbackyou look for is any sign of an internal shift in your group—a group that couldbe as large as a whole society. You are alert to evidence that people are actingout of their better natures. You persist by showing compassion, no matter howoften your people backslide or show weakness. The celebrations you lead areoften rituals of thanks and worship. The group is drawn together as children ofa higher power.7. Sage and seer: Your role is pure light. You have reached the highest state ofawareness. As a role model, you are saintly, a purified soul. You walk the walkby emanating the very qualities of Being—love, truth, peace, and a deepknowingness. What you do is almost irrelevant. Your feedback is anything andeverything: the sage accepts that each person is following a unique path thatmust be honored. You persist by understanding human nature in any guise. Youcelebrate by uniting with the One, the field of pure being that is the source ofeverything. Others celebrate by absorbing your inner peace and joy.Because human nature is complicated, it is up to you to identify the role youneed to play. If you are prepared at the level of deepest awareness, every roleis open to you. The most powerful leaders in history, such as Gandhi, Churchill,and Lincoln, fulfilled all seven roles, which is the key to their greatness.Every situation calls for a flexible response, but some values cannot becompromised if you are to play your role successfully. These values come fromwithin. Without them, a leader will be torn by the conflicts bombarding him fromevery side. Don’t present such a strong ego that you won’t bend; rather, toresolve a problem, know where it is desirable to bend and where it isn’t.WHAT ISN’T NEGOTIABLEProtector: I won’t give up being centered. If I don’t feel strong and secureinside, I can’t manage the crisis at hand.Achiever: I won’t give up my self-confidence. If I don’t feel that I willsucceed, I can’t motivate others to succeed.Team Builder: I won’t give up my impartiality. If I don’t treat everyone fairly,I can’t persuade others to settle their differences.Nurturer: I won’t give up my insight. If I can’t see beneath the surface todiscover how people really feel, they won’t feel understood.Innovator: I won’t give up my curiosity. If I am not open to all possibilities,I can’t lead the way to new discoveries.Transformer: I won’t give up my moral vision. If I am not inspired, I can’t leadothers to a higher way of life.Sage and Seer: I am unique because there is nothing I won’t give up. Theuniverse brings all things and takes them back again. Being connected to thecycle of creation and destruction, I encompass both.These inner values will be your support in the most difficult situations. Youwon’t negotiate over them because they are part of you. To give them up would belike tearing yourself down. The surest way to know that you truly fit the roleyou are playing is to be totally secure about where you will compromise andwhere you won’t.ACT SMARTEven as you act out your role, there are some specific keys to successfulaction. Remember, it’s not how well you fit your part that will determine yourgreatness as a leader. The ultimate test is right action, the kind that is clearand decisive and leads to the intended result. Imagine you are in charge ofhandling an emergency like Hurricane Katrina or a massive oil spill. As thefirst person on the scene with your team, you must take decisive action in theshortest period of time. Three routes are open to you.A: You set up a chain of command with Washington. Your handbook containsapproved procedures for dealing with this kind of emergency. Even though thereis chaos everywhere, you await orders from above. You have a job to do, butthere’s a right way to do it. By looking out for yourself and your job, youaren’t doing wrong: you are being loyal to the powers who stand over you.B: You keep on the go, assessing the emergency from the field. You race to theworst damage spots in order to bring help where it is most needed. You check inwith Washington regularly, but you take on major responsibility yourself. Thisis your show, however it turns out. Like a general commanding troops in thefield, you give orders decisively, expecting them to be obeyed. Thanks to theconfidence that higher-ups place in you, you never lose control over thesituation.C: You visit the scene of destruction daily, but otherwise you stay put. Youdelegate authority with the understanding that your lieutenants must be willingto make some tough decisions on their own. Every step of the way you assess whois best to solve a given problem. You improvise in your methods. You don’thesitate to take risks, because you know that emergencies call for the greatestaccomplishments, and those don’t come without risk. You set nearly impossiblegoals and deadlines, yet somehow they get met.These three styles of action should seem very familiar. In an age of continuousmedia coverage, the public sees how emergencies are handled. The first kind ofleader (a team player who never breaks the rules) can be instantly separatedfrom the second kind of leader (who responds with intense personal commitmentand monitors the crisis on the ground himself). But the third kind of leaderisn’t so easily spotted, because he takes action that is unpredictable andspontaneous. He does more on the inside than on the outside. He can be extremelyinvolved or seemingly detached as his inner guidance tells him to be.This kind of leader has consciously chosen how he will act. Whatever theemergency, he works from a foundation of awareness. His actions are the smartestof the three because he reaches beyond his own perspective, trying to grasp theemergency from as many viewpoints as possible, then absorbing the whole picture.Intelligence is a quality of consciousness. It is personal, insofar as oneperson may be more intelligent than another. But that is a limited distinction.A great leader doesn’t have to possess the highest IQ in the group. His talentis to pool as much intelligence as possible, reaching in all directions.We can describe his methods using the acronym SMART, which applies to everyleadership situation, not just crises and emergencies. No matter what role youplay, you can act smart.• S—Stretch the group to exceed its grasp so that people see that a vision is atwork and can be realized. Avoid repetition and routine.• M—Measure every step toward achieving the goal. Measurable goals are tangible,visible. Information is shared and known by the whole group. Avoid beingimprecise and vague.• A—Agreement should be the basis of decisions. Move forward with the agreementof everyone who is participating. Avoid unilateral actions and arbitrary rules.• R—Record the progress being made. Let everyone know that he or she is part ofan unfolding story, a journey. Avoid random, meaningless procedures.• T—Time limits should be set for the goal. These limits are not constraints;they free each member to find his or her own personal rhythm while remainingaware of a definite end date. Avoid open-ended schedules.By consciously deciding to act smart, you avoid two great pitfalls of inadequateleadership. The first is ego, the reliance on yourself as the only authority,the center of attention, the person who has to be right. The other pitfall islack of outreach. Intelligence exists everywhere in the universe, in every cellof our bodies, and in all people. Therefore the most natural way to access thisfield is to widen your gaze—the farther you cast your net, the more you willknow.A great deal depends on taking right action instead of wrong action. Thedifference lies not in the uncertain future but in you and the authenticity ofyour vision. You are the source. With you and in you, the spark is ignited.Therefore your position is unique in the whole group. To ensure that you aretruly acting from the soul, where all right action begins, keep asking yourselfthese questions:Do your actions symbolize what the group is all about?Do you carry out the action demanded by your vision?Is your action responsive to the needs being expressed?Are you doing what you promised everyone you would do?Are you moving aside the resistance that lies in the way of every intention?Are you affirming the joy and fulfillment that is the result of successfulaction?THE SPIRITUAL SIDE OF DOINGThe classic sign that a person is leading from the soul is that she stopsstruggling and lets life unfold. In Eastern spiritual traditions this approachis sometimes called “nondoing,” which is considered more powerful than doing.You can actually accomplish more with less when you practice nondoing. It isvery far from doing nothing. Imagine that you are at a sports event, such as afootball or baseball game. An exciting moment has arrived—a last-minute pass fora touchdown or a high fly ball sailing for the fence. On the field the receiveror the outfielder knows that everything depends on him. His body and mind are atpeak alertness. Events are moving so swiftly that the difference between successand failure is a matter of split seconds.In such situations, athletes report that they sometimes go into “the zone.”Despite the tenseness of the moment, they feel extremely relaxed. The deafeningnoise of the crowds disappears, replaced by silence. The player feels calm andknows, with total certainty, that he will catch the ball. Sometimes he feels asif he is witnessing his actions, as if he is completely uninvolved and the ballis destined to arrive at the exact place in space and time. Spectators in thestands see no sign that the player is in the zone. The externals remain thesame, but the internal experience is dramatically transformed. Struggle hasturned into allowing. Doing has crossed an invisible line to become nondoing.Being in the zone is unpredictable, but you can learn to set the stage for it.Sometimes we push our bodies into extreme effort, but most of the time we standaside and let the body do what it does. The heart, lungs, kidney, and braindon’t operate less efficiently when we step aside. In fact, if you worry aboutyour blood pressure, it is likely to go up. If you try to force yourself toremember a word, it is less likely to appear. There’s a fine balance betweenletting the body’s intelligence operate on its own and taking control. TheEastern teaching about nondoing holds that just as you can step aside fromcontrolling your body, you can step aside from controlling your life. Your lifewill still work very well if you don’t control it. It will flow, unfold, grow,and evolve. By allowing, you become the witness to what your soul wants, andbecause you trust your soul, what it wants meshes perfectly with what you want.When that fusion takes place, being in the zone isn’t a matter of magicalmoments on the playing field. It’s a way of life.A successful visionary has reached the stage where nondoing is natural. Havingexperienced what it’s like to let life unfold on its own, she possesses a greatadvantage. Her approach to leadership can avoid the struggle, worry, stress, andcontrol that brings down so many cherished projects. Letting your soul do thework is the most efficient way to lead as well as the most spiritual. Inparticular, four principles operate from the soul level:Consciousness has organizing power.Consciousness makes quantum leaps of creativity.Consciousness moves naturally in the direction of growth.Consciousness creates order out of disorder.Now instead of using the word consciousness, substitute the word I. These fourprinciples exist through you. You activate them. This is the true meaning ofacting as the soul of the group. Allowing your soul to act through you opens apath so that the people you work with can activate their own souls. However,when you struggle, worry, and try to be in control, you block the soul’sinfluence. A successful visionary takes practical steps to ensure that thatdoesn’t happen. For each of the four principles there are definite do’s anddon’ts.CONSCIOUSNESS HAS ORGANIZING POWER.Do: Let events fall into place. When something gets stuck, first adopt await-and-see attitude. Act when you feel clear and centered. Allow other peopleto follow their own natural way of doing things. Tolerate diverse approaches.Trust that your soul has a plan, and even if you can’t see it completely, knowthat everything will unfold as it is meant to.Don’t: Plan excessively. When you make a plan, leave room for changes. Don’timpose one right way of doing things. Don’t try to nail down every detail inadvance. Don’t worry about the unknown—it contains the most creative solutions.Don’t take on the burden of knowing everything in advance. When in doubt, don’toverthink, and don’t rush in to control things.CONSCIOUSNESS MAKES QUANTUM LEAPS OF CREATIVITY.Do: Expect the unexpected, and be comfortable with it. Ask yourself for newsolutions, and then let go so they have time to gestate within you. Trust thatthere is always an answer. Look beyond the level of the problem: the solution isalmost always at another level. Rely on your intuition. Follow hunches, andenjoy where they lead you—chance encounters are often the most productive. Keepin contact with people whose minds work very differently from yours, and payattention to what they say from their unique viewpoint. Keep a journal of yourbrainstorms, and just as helpfully, let your imagination run wild in yourjournal.Don’t: Keep repeating the same failed approach. Doing more of what didn’t workin the first place won’t take you where you want to go. Don’t talk only to thosewho already agree with you. Don’t be closed to crazy ideas and outlandishdreams—they might lead to unexpected breakthroughs. Don’t forget that you arethe source of infinite creativity, waiting to be tapped.CONSCIOUSNESS MOVES IN THE DIRECTION OF GROWTH.Do: Trust that growth is endless, since awareness has no limits. Treat life as aclassroom where every day is the first day of school. If you have a choice, belast in the class ahead of you rather than first in the class behind you. Aimfor the highest achievement, and be guided step by step from the core of yourbeing. To activate growth, add some fertilizer in the form of energy, attention,and passion.Don’t: Think you’ve reached the end. There’s always another step of evolutionwaiting for you. Don’t assume that you know the whole story—there’s alwaysanother page to turn. Don’t set your sights low. Don’t settle for good enough.CONSCIOUSNESS CREATES ORDER OUT OF DISORDER.Do: Trust that everything has a reason. Look for that reason rather thanfocusing on the chaos. Keep your mind open to the bigger picture that isemerging. Keep in touch with the meaning and purpose of your work. Remindyourself of the greater good behind every day’s effort. As new levels of successunfold, aim even higher. There is infinite orderliness in Nature, therefore anyorder of complexity can be effortlessly arranged.Don’t: struggle against disorder. Creation uses disorder to bring about newanswers. Don’t impose an arbitrary or rigid kind of organization. The orderimposed by the mind is ugly compared to the beautiful order that Nature unfolds.Don’t add to the stress of the situation. Don’t put up resistance to change justbecause you feel uncomfortable: be open to the new order that wants to emerge.If you adopt these principles, you will discover that allowing has tremendouspower. Instead of trying to figure out every step of your personal journey, youcan let your soul reveal what is needed next. What is needed next cannot bepredicted. Do you know the day and hour of your next brilliant idea? Again, thisisn’t the same as doing nothing. Your soul may tell you to jump into action; itmay tell you to wait and see, or anything in between. The point is thatconsciousness flows where it is needed. The soul sends the message that suitsthe moment.Behind the mystery of nondoing lies a simple, profound truth: your soul wants totake care of you completely. All true leaders embody this truth, because intheir heart of hearts leaders want to serve. Their greatest fulfillment lies inbringing fulfillment to others. Therefore doing and nondoing, although theysound like opposites, actually merge. Nondoing brings you close to your soul.From that level, everything you do serves the highest purpose of life, thewell-being of the group, and your own personal mission.THE LESSONS OF DOING * Leading from the soul means doing what is right from the level of being. You actions are grounded in awareness. Coming from a deep level, your actions are supported by the universe. * The role a leader plays depends upon the situation and its needs. If your awareness is expanded, you can fill all seven roles that match the seven basic situations that life brings. * In spiritual terms the highest form of doing is nondoing, or allowing. This is action that comes directly from the soul. In the state of nondoing you witness the unfolding of your being as it directs every step that leads you to your highest goals.WHAT TO DO TODAYAs a leader you will be judged by your actions, and the step that precedes everyaction is decision making. You can increase your chance of making the rightdecision by being more aware. A decision that takes you in the right directiongives rise to a different feeling, a different atmosphere, and a different senseof other people from one that is wrong. This pertains while the decision isbeing made. If you tune in to how the process is going, you will become aware ofthe difference.Decisions that turn out to be successful have certain features in common. Todayif you find yourself having to make a critical decision, or even if you arecontemplating one in the near future, ask yourself a few simple questions:Does this decision feel right?Is it fair and honest?Can I trust what I’m being told?Where’s the catch?Am I in over my head?If you look at the really bad decisions in your past, you’ll see that you didn’task or answer these questions properly. Somewhere in the decision-makingprocess, you began to fool yourself—as countless others have done before you, atevery level of leadership. You fell for illusion instead of reality because youbecame disconnected from your true self, the core of your personal values andpurpose. This doesn’t have to happen again.The environment that surrounds good decision making has its own set of factorsto indicate that you are in tune with your soul. Look over the following listand see if your current decisions, whether large or small, are being supportedfrom the level of being.20 ELEMENTS OF RIGHT DECISIONS 1. You are optimistic. 2. You don’t indulge in wishful thinking. 3. You are not obsessively worrying about what can go wrong. 4. You can weigh the risks without undue fear. 5. You aren’t blaming anyone for past mistakes. 6. You don’t feel the need to ask for repeated reassurance. 7. You want the group to do what is best for everyone. 8. You assess criticism with detachment and fairness. 9. You decide to take reasonable risks. 10. You trust that there is always a solution waiting to present itself. 11. You encourage independent thinking. 12. You don’t obsess over minute details. 13. You listen to the broadest range of people. 14. You realize the best way to go is unique to each situation. 15. You offer honest judgments without being brutal. 16. You focus without distraction. 17. You praise fully when someone gives positive input. 18. You set down reasonable rules that cause minimal constraint. 19. You are modest about your authority; you make no one feel small. 20. You participate from genuine enthusiasm.If all or most of these elements are present, your decision making is highlyconscious—you are tuned in. If few of these elements are present, your decisionmaking is meeting with blocks and resistance. Until you become clearer inside,your choices will be too clouded to be reliable.So today, if you can perceive that the environment isn’t good, postpone makingyour decision until you have found the place inside you that is clear, coherent,calm, and self-aware. The secret, as always, is that every situation beginsinside you and reflects where you are at this moment. Trust that your soul wantsthe best for you and that, with expanded awareness, you can unerringly find theright path. When the conditions “in here” are settled and clear, the results“out there” naturally follow suit."},{"pageContent":"FIVEE = EMPOWERMENTEmpowerment is the fruit of successful action. Doing and having power gotogether, since without the power to sustain your vision through difficultiesand resistance, your vision will wither away. This isn’t ego empowerment, whichis driven by the demands of “I, me, and mine”; you are empowering others at thesame time as you empower yourself.The belief that power isn’t compatible with spirituality is misguided. At yoursource, there is a field of infinite possibilities. Packaged with everypossibility is the path to achievement. Your soul unfolds both at the same time.Your power is validated by what you can manifest as reality.There is a dark side to power, however, known as the shadow. This is whereanger, fear, envy, greed, and aggression create problems for leaders, warpingtheir good intentions and tarnishing their ideals. You must be aware of yourshadow, and then you can defuse it by integrating the dark into the light. Whenyou transcend the need for good and bad, for light and dark to war against eachother, the power of the soul will be completely yours. This is the power ofwholeness.Every leader needs power, yet nothing brings more problems. Doing without itisn’t an option. If you lack the power to reach your goals, your vision willremain inert. You have to be realistic about how power works before you cansuccessfully empower yourself and then discover how to empower others, which isthe greatest good a leader can do. The use of power is entangled with itsmisuse.Seen through the lens of history, power follows certain principles, wellillustrated by leaders ancient and modern.• Power accumulates. The more a leader gets, the more will come to him.• The powerful rise only to fall. The higher a leader climbs, the moreinevitable is his downfall.• Power corrupts. Leaders who start out to do good wind up doing evil.• Power is exceptional. The ordinary person willingly or unwillingly surrendershis power to a handful of power-seekers and is left with none for himself.These principles are acted out every day, and it doesn’t take the huge stage ofhistory to see them at work. As early as the sandbox, children can be seendividing into bullies and victims, givers and takers, strong and meek.Psychologists tell us that gender roles are determined in early childhood: boyslearn how to wield power, and girls learn how to appeal to power by beingattractive and compliant. But even making simple statements about young childrenleads to controversy. No one wants to be told that she is among the meek ratherthan the strong, or that being a girl destines her to playing a lesser role thanbeing a boy. Power has always been troubling.Leading from the soul means resolving these troublesome issues by taking aconscious approach to them. With expanded awareness, one sees that the patternsof power are neither fixed nor inevitable. Each of the four principles can bereversed and transformed into something much more humane.Power accumulates: To reverse this principle, renounce personal power fortranspersonal power. Transpersonal power can be found in everyone. It is basedon empathy, compassion, detachment, and going beyond ego to find your deeperidentity.The powerful rise only to fall: To reverse this principle, ground yourself inbeing, which is steady and ever-present. Its energy powers the universe from thelevel of the quantum field, the invisible starting point of all things visible.Here every possibility is equal. When you can bring out the fullest potential inany situation, your power will be steady, without the risk of rising too high ortaking a fall.Power corrupts: To reverse this principle, learn from your shadow and turn itsnegative influence into something positive. There is a dark side to everyleadership role; when you are unconscious of it, the dark side leads to personalcorruption. Yet the energies of the shadow, such as anger, resentment,selfishness, greed, and envy, are woven into life as a whole. They represent thedestructive aspect in Nature, without which creation cannot emerge. Once youmake creative use of the shadow, which is its ultimate purpose, power will notcorrupt you.Power is exceptional: To reverse this principle, empower others by showing themthat they are equal to you. In reality, power is universal. The same energy,creativity, and orderliness are present in an atom and a galaxy, a one-celledbacterium and the human brain. We are misled by appearances and miss the hidden,invisible level from which power comes. If you share this knowledge, you canempower others to activate the source of power in themselves. Then everyone isexceptional, not just the few.When you have reversed all four principles, you are fully empowered. Empowermentis not a desirable end in itself, however. Although being powerless brings manyproblems, so does misusing power. You must forge a link between power and deepervalues. We look around us and see a world where every kind of horror existsthrough tyranny, oppression, military force, and persecution of the weak. Youcan be a force to counter these troubles, but you have to be willing to confrontpower consciously, here and now.PERSONAL OR TRANSPERSONAL?The first principle we want to reverse is “power accumulates.” For many leadersthis poses a terrible temptation, because they are motivated by the need to bein charge, to control, to make every decision. Their vision may be benign—alltyrants tell themselves that they are serving the greater good—but being good orbad isn’t really the issue. The issue is ego, which needs no excuse to gain morefor itself. When “I, me, and mine” dominates, the leader identifies withposition and status. Ego is insecure by nature, so it is impossible to be strongwithout making others weak. As the ego sees it, every contest has winners andlosers, and if glory goes to the winner, shame comes to the loser.Before ego can undermine you, ground yourself in transpersonal power.Transpersonal power isn’t ego-based. It exists equally in everyone.Transpersonal literally means “beyond the personal,” or “belonging to everyone.”By drawing on universal qualities, you as a leader become first among equals.You are made first by embodying more of what everyone desires. Instead of beinga threat, your power inspires others. You are exercising transpersonal powerwhen you bring to others the things most universally desired. When thousands ofpeople were asked what they most wanted from a leader, four desires topped thelist: trust, compassion, stability, and hope. When your power comes fromsupplying these things, it has shifted from personal to transpersonal.Trust: People want to trust their leaders, to be secure in the knowledge thatthey will not be manipulated and misled. Trust is an invisible bond. It says, “Ican’t see what you are doing. I can’t control or check up on you. But thatdoesn’t matter. My trust is enough.” People must trust that higher-ups arecompetent and can be counted on not to break their word.By being open with everyone, keeping no secrets, describing situationsrealistically, and providing evidence that you are taking practical steps tomeet any challenge, you show that as a leader you can be trusted with power. Aleader who is not to be trusted does the opposite: she is obsessed with secrecyand closing down leaks. She reminds the group that she is to be feared. Shetells the story that will keep her in power rather than the story that is true.The tools for building trust are honesty, candor, and competence.Compassion: Compassion makes people feel cared for. It draws out everyone’scommon humanity and keeps a group from disintegrating. When difficulties arise,there is always a pull between “every man for himself” and “we have to sticktogether.” Empathy wars with selfishness. A leader can settle this conflictthrough compassion, a word that means “suffering with.” By showing that you feeleveryone’s pain, you inspire the group to draw together. Each is motivated tofeel for the person next to him. When you know what it feels like to walk insomeone else’s shoes, there is no choice but respect.Empathy isn’t only about pain. You feel the joy of another person’s life aswell. Their successes are yours and vice versa. When you feel empathy, you closethe gap that separates isolated individuals. Compassion may seem like a passiveor “soft” attitude, but it translates into powerful loyalties. Mutual help isoffered. Mutual gratitude is felt. Once people are grateful for the things theyshare, the boundary has been crossed from personal to transpersonal.The tools for building compassion are empathy, respect, and gratitude.Stability: The soul is peaceful, calm, and capable of adapting to any kind ofchange. These are transpersonal qualities, built into the deepest level of ourbeing. As a leader, you must project these qualities in order to make othersfeel stable. Instability embodies uncertainty. It makes people feel that theground beneath their feet is crumbling. Reason can easily give way to panic(which is why markets can topple a bank simply on the rumor of insufficientfunds).The most basic aspect of stability is survival. It begins with knowing that youare going to be paid for your work. (Gallup researchers have found that workerswho believe in the financial stability of their company are nine times morelikely to be engaged in their work.) But as a leader you are asked to provide adeeper sense of stability. When the circumstances get dicey, uncertainty becomesa powerful stress. Everyone feels very alone. To counter the isolation, a leaderoffers support. The promise “I’ll always be here for you” is carried out inactions. To counter uncertainty, he is always reliable. He won’t suddenly turnand look out only for himself. By his presence, such a leader has a calminginfluence; he serves as a haven in the storm, which allows people to find thissame quality in themselves. Then leadership has crossed over from the personalto the transpersonal.The tools for building stability are reliability, support, and peace.Hope: Hope is intangible because it rests upon belief. Your role is to bebeliever-in-chief. You hold out hope for a better future than anyone else cansee. Hopelessness is the most tragic turn that life can take, depriving peopleof a vision for their future. The suffering of today blights hope for tomorrow.But at the soul level the future is always open because unseen possibilities canalways awaken. (When Gallup pollsters asked workers if their leaders made themfeel encouraged about the future, 69 percent of those who said yes were alsoengaged in their work; only 1 percent of those who said no were engaged.)As a leader you must keep the horizon full of promise. Promise provides power.Instinctively people realize this, and they cling to hope even when a crisisseems beyond repair. In the worst storms, hope is the flickering candle that aleader cannot allow to be extinguished.To give another person hope, a leader’s inspirational words are only thebeginning. When we lose hope, we become directionless. Therefore a leader mustprovide clear direction, a definite step-by-step plan. Eventually people can beallowed to provide their own direction, which in itself will be a sign of hope,but until then you must provide it. Work hands on to guide the group through allthe recovery efforts that follow an immediate crisis. Also, respect the weakenedposition that people find themselves in. Guide them past shame and guilt.Providing guidance means holding out the values that need to be restored, suchas self-confidence, competence, and worthiness. Through your showing that yousee these values in others, they will begin to see them in themselves. When youshow others a concrete way to move forward, you give them a reason to havefaith. That’s proof that they have crossed over to the transpersonal, sincefaith is based on belief in a higher power, however you choose to define it.The tools for building hope are direction, guidance, and faith.POWER MADE PERMANENTThe second principle that needs to be reversed is “the powerful rise only tofall.” The reasons for taking a fall are many. Power-hungry people make enemieswho want to bring them down. They are insecure to begin with, and they engineertheir own fall by dirty deeds and secretive manipulation. The ego is so insecurethat it fails to see the mistakes it is making, intent as it is on building anoversized self-image that is bound to implode. But in terms of the soul, theseare all secondary causes. In spiritual terms, to seek power is to lose it,because what you seek you already are. The great Bengali poet RabindranathTagore put this truth beautifully when he wrote, “Those who seek, knock at thegate. Those who love find it open.” Love is an aspect of being, and when you actfrom being, the power you draw on is limitless because it comes from the source.This kind of power is steady. It doesn’t rise or fall. Therefore if you dependupon it, you don’t have to climb to the top to achieve power.Imagine three leaders who want to achieve the same thing: starting a company,building a bridge, or popularizing a new idea or invention. Leader A is a doer.He makes connections with people who can help him achieve his goal. He hires agood team; he knows how to get others as excited as he is about the project. Hisday is filled with appointments and decisions. At the hub of activity, hebecomes the linchpin. All decisions come through him. In short order he makeshimself indispensable. This kind of power can be very effective, but it is alsothe most insecure. For every success, there are many people who fail to achievealong this path. Someone stronger or more charismatic might beat them out. Theymay not be able to sustain the demands for energy and time that mount up,eventually swallowing up everything. Power based on doing can be taken from you,and even when it isn’t, every day brings a confrontation with uncertainty, sincethe world is full of risks.Leader B is a thinker rather than a doer. He might be the power behind thethrone, or the source of ideas who leaves the practical side of the project toothers. In either role, his strength is that he can analyze. He weighs options,observes other people, and comes to conclusions rationally. He isn’t tossedaround by the rough-and-tumble of everyday pressures. He is more distant butalso more isolated. The danger for such a leader is that personal bonds canweaken. Loyal followers who admire his ideas tend to drift away when betterideas come along. Still, the leader who thinks is more secure than the doer,because his mind sustains him. He is grounded at a deeper level than personalloyalties, connections, and the daily grind of making things happen.Leader C is grounded in being. He isn’t invested in either doing or thinking.Every day his existence is focused on keeping to the right path, wherever itleads. He is spared the constant demands for energy that the doer must keep upwith; he is also spared the isolation of the thinker, who needs doers to bringhis ideas into the real world. To others around him, the leader who is groundedin being often seems mysterious. They can’t quite figure out how he maintainshis calm in a crisis and how he decides when to act, because sometimes he allowsevents to unfold while at other times he leaps into action. Such a leader makesfor a successful visionary because he is selfless enough to permit his soul toguide him. He is immune to taking a fall because he has no desire to climb tothe top. His sole purpose is to watch his vision unfold, therefore his path isone of expansion, not rising.To become this kind of leader, your actions must be organized around theexpansion of consciousness. In previous chapters we’ve covered how to connect tothe level of being. Now you need to participate in the infusion of being intoeveryday life. Naturally, this new way challenges your old ways. As younegotiate your way, being will create the change you want. There is no need tofight against your past conditioning and familiar habits. Instead, a naturalshift takes place. To encourage that shift, here’s a guide.HOW TO ENCOURAGE YOUR BEINGBefore making a decision, ask inside for guidance. Be patient and await ananswer.Act only when you feel calm and certain.Trust that there is a right path.Trust that you are connected to your being, which knows what to do at all times.When you meet with resistance, inside or out, don’t fight back. Do what it takesto resolve the resistance and turn it into acceptance. If resistance persists,distance yourself and give it time.Be fully engaged, but at the same time cultivate detachment.Know that you are greater than any result, good or bad.Identify yourself with the bigger picture and not the minute details.Believe that your awareness can expand without limitation. To say “I am theuniverse” isn’t egocentric—it’s the truth of our soul.PURE POWERThe third principle that needs to be reversed is “power corrupts.” If youbelieve that human nature is innately selfish and greedy, the corruption ofpower will seem inevitable. But perhaps the premise is wrong. If human natureisn’t fixed, it is open to choice. You can choose not to abandon your ideals andkeep true to our vision. The trick is to escape either/or thinking, because it’scommon to believe that either you are powerful or you are an idealist. Thevisionary doesn’t have to be separate from the realist. At the level of being,your vision is united with the way to achieve that vision. If you can keep themunited, power will serve idealism instead of corrupting it.As we’ve seen, the dark side of human nature is called the shadow, the hiddenarea of the psyche where anger, fear, greed, envy, and violence are kept out ofsight. When any leader turns soulless, the shadow has triumphed. The simplestand most basic question, “Who am I, really?” has stopped being asked. The shadowcauses enormous problems; it’s hard to think of a human misery that isn’t rootedthere. Whatever you haven’t faced has power over you. You may set out to donothing but good, but unless you become conscious of your shadow, the resultwill be denial. In a state of denial you will face all kinds of negative effectsfrom the external world, but you will be ill equipped to defeat them. Negativityis defeated only when you can integrate it into the whole fabric of life. If youare caught up in separating good from evil, light from shadow, you may play thepart of goodness, but somehow badness will always crop up to counter you.Leading from the soul means finding a way to fuse opposites so that you standfor life as a whole, not simply the bright side.To begin with, be aware that every role you play as a leader has a specificshadow that matches it.The protector’s shadow is the temptation to become a tyrant. Instead of removingfear and threat, he promotes it. He wants to be told how much “the littlepeople” need him. His self-importance leads him to excuse how he abuses others.To keep himself in power, he exaggerates the threats that exist and even inventsimaginary rivals and enemies. The end, when it comes, is ugly and often violentas he is toppled against his will.To counter the shadow: Be aware of any sign in yourself of authoritarianism,self-importance, uncontrolled anger, the need for flattery, and paranoia aboutthreats and rivals. These are the seeds of the tyrant.The achiever’s shadow is addiction to winning, fueled by the never-ending desirefor more. Underneath, she has an even stronger fear of losing. This fear cloudsher judgment. She begins to indulge in excessive risk taking—she is so addictedto winning that the next high always needs to be greater than the last. Allproportion is lost, and with it the connection to others. Success now means morethan family and friends. While claiming that she is still in control of herself,the achiever who has turned into an addict eventually takes one risk too many.Then she brings herself down and others with her.To counter the shadow: Be aware of any sign in yourself of turning encountersinto win-lose situations, polishing your self-image, being ambitious at the costof family and friends, and obsessing over competitors. These are the seeds ofaddiction to success.The team builder’s shadow is conformity, fueled by the fear of not belonging.Constantly attuned to the reactions of others, he cannot bear to make enemiesand feels wounded by criticism. The conformist comes to epitomize the “tallpoppy syndrome,” punishing anyone who tries to stand out above the group. Hisneed to placate everyone leads him to overlook footdraggers and time-servers.Instead of fostering cooperation, he fosters complacency. The end, when itcomes, involves a smarter, more energized team-builder swallowing the conformistup.To counter the shadow: Be aware of any sign in yourself of going along to getalong, never making waves, acting against your conscience, and envying othersfor their special talents and abilities. These are the seeds of conformity.The nurturer’s shadow is judgment, fueled by the fear of not being good enough.This fear gets projected outward, making others wrong in order to feel right.Instead of empathizing with how other people feel, someone acting from judgmenttells them what they should be feeling. As real connections dissolve, the failednurturer falls back on pretense, a show of warmth and bonding. Secret biasesmust be hidden. She can’t afford to let anyone know that she secretly judgesthem. The end, when it comes, arrives through the exposure of hypocrisy. Theloving, fair, nonjudgmental nurturer has been leading a double life.To counter the shadow: Be aware of any sign in yourself of hiding yourprejudices instead of openly discussing them, showing favoritism, harboringsecret motives, and pretending to be better than you are. These are the seeds ofjudgment.The innovator’s shadow is solipsism, fueled by fear of risks. Instead of beingopen to new ideas, he promotes his past achievements. His reputation looms largein his own mind. He craves recognition—ideally, everyone should honor him as amaster of his craft. Beneath this show of self-centeredness, risk has taken itstoll. To hide from his inability to take chances, the failed innovator stopspeering into the unknown. The end, when it comes, finds him outmoded and behindthe curve.To counter the shadow: Be aware of any sign in yourself of smugness, jealousy,cravings for attention, insecurity about your reputation, and a reluctance toinvest yourself in unproven ideas. These are the seeds of solipsism.The transformer’s shadow is despair, fueled by society’s stubborn resistance tochange. In place of hope, which every transformer must show, depression beginsto gnaw its way in. The failed transformer finds herself personally wounded bysetbacks. She grows ever more disappointed by the moral weakness of others, buther greatest disappointment is reserved for herself. Her cherished ideals arebeing tarnished; she throws herself against the barricades over and over withoutsuccess. The end, when it comes, arrives not at the hands of reactionaries butwhen the crusade runs out of steam.To counter the shadow: Be aware of any sign in yourself of personal blame,guilt, cynicism, depression, and resignation that nothing will ever change.These are the seeds of despair.The sage and seer don’t have a shadow. They have uncovered their dark side andreleased themselves from it. Yet ironically, their liberation can make otherssuspicious. It’s hard to believe that the sage isn’t hiding some foible and thatthe seer hasn’t got a blind spot. But criticism and even open attack don’t fazethe sage and seer. They accept every aspect of the human condition. There is noend to the sage’s journey. He walks ahead, striving to turn suffering into joy.To him, the world’s suffering is a mask for eternal bliss.Once you become aware of your shadow, the next step is to defuse it. Whatdoesn’t work is to resist, fight, steel yourself, or go into denial. The shadowmay feel like an enemy, but Nature brings about creation through destruction.The wholeness of life depends upon reconciling these two forces. In yourself,anger, fear, resentment, envy, and greed emerge as negative forces because theyaren’t integrated. “Good me” and “bad me” are at war. Until you disengage fromthe war, you have no recourse except struggle. The seeds of anger and fear willgrow, and because they are flourishing out of sight, in the dark, they becomemore distanced from the light. Increasing isolation causes natural expressionsof the destructive force to become renegades, randomly causing harm whereverthey can.To take the shadow beyond war and strife, make it your goal to integrate “badme” into “good me.” Your soul is beyond opposites. If you aim at the fullintegration of every aspect of yourself, you are doing exactly what your soulwants you to do.MERGING WITH YOUR SHADOWBe aware of feelings like anger, anxiety, envy, grief, and selfishness.Acknowledge that these feelings are part of you.Forgive yourself for having a shadow.Take responsibility for what you feel. Don’t project onto others, blame them, ortake your negativity out on them.Take a vow against any form of violence and aggression.When you feel the emergence of a negative emotion, sit quietly and feel it inyour body. Ask for the emotion to resolve itself, which means that you releaseit, taking whatever time is necessary.Trust that all residues of fear, anger, grief, jealousy, and insecurity can bereleased. If you are able, seek help from a counselor, body worker, or otherguide who is skilled in releasing old traumas and past wounds.Resist the urge to push away or deny those feelings you judge against. If youforce them to exist out of sight, they will only undermine you.Don’t keep secrets. Find someone with whom you can share anything, and thenproceed, as appropriate, to bring “bad me” out for discussion.Work on the shadow one piece at a time. It is much easier to dismantle astrongly negative aspect of yourself, such as uncontrollable fear, free-floatinganxiety, a hair-trigger temper, or deep-seated resentment, than it is toconfront it head on. These uncontrolled tendencies are pieced together by oldbeliefs, childhood experiences, unrevealed secrets, hidden guilt and shame,judgment against the self, influences in your surroundings (such as stress,domestic strife, continuing abuse, and failure at work), and a superstitiousattachment to concepts like absolute evil or the devil. By addressing each pieceone at a time, even the most powerful shadow energy can be defused.EQUALITY OF POWERThe last principle that we need to reverse is “power is exceptional.” There’s nodoubt that it feels good to feel special, and leaders who attain power cannothelp but feel exceptional. That’s not what needs reversing. Rather, we need tocorrect the ego’s belief that only “I” am exceptional. The source of power isuniversal. Everyone contains infinite potential, and once it is released, theuniverse will either support it or not. As a leader, it’s up to you to show thedifference by guiding others onto a path that the universe will favor. You dothis by the same means that you used on yourself, by connecting with the soul.You cannot cajole, order, or force anyone else to reconnect with his soul, butyou can inspire him to find his own motivation. We’ve already covered some ofthe most critical factors: acting as a role model, forming emotional bonds,building trust, compassion, stability, and hope. But until the people you leadare able to identify with what is best in themselves, they can’t take the firststep on their own path. Duplicating your path isn’t a substitute. Ideally, youcould have everyone in your group write out a mission statement based on hersoul profile and personal vision. That is how we’ve been unfolding your ownpath. You can also take advantage of research, such as that performed by Gallup,which is used to identify each person’s strengths in detail. In the Gallup modelthere are thirty-four specific strengths. If a team contains as many differentstrengths as possible, it improves their chance of success.Taking this advice to heart, you can begin to share power by learning what tolook for as a strength. Don’t assume that people know their own strengths, butunderstand that until they discover them, they have no basis on which to buildpower. Look at each person you want to assess, and place him in three of thecategories below. If you don’t know the person well, you could choose only twocategories, but it would be better to make a guess at the third and modify yourassessment as you learn more.21 STRENGTHS TO BUILD UPON1.

Getssatisfaction from breaking the ice and making a personal connection.Once you gain insight into someone else’s strengths, you can help him find hisown path to empowerment. To begin with, tell him what you see and discuss hisown sense of what he’s strong at. If you are in a position to assign tasks, usehis strengths as a guide. Even if you aren’t assigning a task, keep in mind whateveryone’s strengths are. This will enable you to seek the right input from eachperson.If a single theme runs through empowerment, it’s the belief that all people havean equal right to power. Each of us is a complete person reflecting thewholeness of our soul. We may be hiding from our completeness, deliberately ornot. Instead of relishing how multidimensional we are, most of us have becomeresigned to a narrow slice of life. Empowerment is about expanding expectationsby revealing that all the negative assumptions about power don’t have to betrue. Power isn’t something you grab; it’s the infinite energy, intelligence,and creativity of the soul that wants to express itself through you. When youunderstand that everyone is the expression of a soul, you as a leader find joyin helping each individual uncover that truth. The highest spiritual lessonabout power that I’ve ever read comes from Tagore: “Power said to the world,‘You are mine.’ Love said to the world, ‘I am yours.’ Love won.”THE LESSONS OF EMPOWERMENT• Leading from the soul means reversing the ways that power is misused. Theguiding principle is to empower others every step of the way, as you empoweryourself.• Cross the boundary that separates personal power from transpersonal power.Transpersonal means “going beyond the individual.” This is the kind of powerthat exists within everyone at the level of the soul.• Treading the path to power begins by knowing your personal strengths andbuilding on them. The same is true when you empower others. With the expansionof awareness, you express the wholeness of your soul. Then your strength comesfrom the level of being.WHAT TO DO TODAYPower becomes a problem when the ego tries to co-opt it. Realize that powerisn’t about “I, me, and mine.” Cultivate detachment in your role as a leader.People confuse feeling high with being powerful, but power derived from the soulis a combination of stillness and dynamism. It never runs out, even after thehigh is over. In detachment you can experience the surge of power withoutgetting lost in it. You can move into any situation with a sense that everythingyou want is already inside you—this is a relaxed, assured state, and a place ofpower.Today you can begin to practice detachment while still being fullyengaged—that’s the real trick, since a cool, aloof detachment is the same asindifference. But there’s a model for detachment that comes naturally and is theopposite of indifference: play. When you watch a child at play, she’s completelyfocused and engaged. The game is all-consuming. Distractions aren’t a problem.The child is carefree and full of energy as long as the game doesn’t turnserious and become about winning. The following exercise can bring you into thisstate of play as an adult.When you wake up in the morning, allow yourself ten minutes in bed with youreyes closed. Visualize the day ahead. See the critical moments that holdimportant decisions or choices for you. See these situations turning out for thebest. Don’t tie yourself to a fixed scenario; just let your mind play withpossibilities. Once you feel happy with a scene, go back and view it fromanother perspective. Watch it turn out well, also, but along completelydifferent lines. Return two or three times, playing with enough possibilitiesthat you aren’t stuck on only one—be as comfortable as you can with whateveryour soul wants to bring to you.When you are finished, leave aside your visualizations and meet the day withopenness.This exercise is about lila (pronounced “leelah”), or “the playfulness ofcreation,” as it is known in Sanskrit. Lila is the way the soul operates, byenjoying the unfolding of every moment and turning “what is” into “what willbe,” not following a straight line or a predictable course but letting everyingredient contribute to something new. Lila is your natural state. You arefalling out of it whenever the following is happening:You invest your ego in winning.You hate losing.You have to be in control.You have to be right.You feel tense and uncomfortable.The stress is getting to you.Things get too serious.Nothing feels like fun.To truly play, you must become aware of these warning signs and do somethingabout them. Every situation is different, but the feeling of play can always berecaptured if you listen inside and respect the truth that creativity is meantto be carefree. I’m not talking about forced jolliness, or mischief, or turningeverything into a game. We all know what it’s like to be innocent and carefree,a state that the soul never leaves. This is playfulness of the spirit.If you keep up the exercise just described, you will begin to be less stuck onthe need for control and a narrow fixity on which outcome is best. Every day isa new world, but we inhabit it as people who don’t know how to be new.Detachment, in its purest form, is the willingness to renew yourself by lettinggo of old conditioning. In complete openness you let the new flood through you,and then you will become as playful as creation itself."},{"pageContent":"SIXR = RESPONSIBILITYLeading from the soul means taking responsibility for more than the group’sneeds. It means having concern for everyone’s personal growth. Thisresponsibility begins with your own evolution. In eight areas of your life youhave the power to be guided by your soul: thoughts, emotions, perception,personal relationships, social role, environment, speech, and the body. In allof these areas your behavior affects the people you lead. If you evolve, so willthey.Leading from the soul means that evolution is your top priority. You never actin such a way as to lower the self-esteem of others. You examine your underlyingbeliefs and modify them as new opportunities for growth reveal themselves.Because evolution is an unstoppable force in the universe, you draw uponinvisible powers. Therefore being responsible is no longer a burden. It restslightly on you as long as you continue to grow.Every leader takes on responsibilities, but if you lead from the soul, you havea different perspective. You take responsibility for your evolution and theevolution of those around you. You’ve chosen to start out with a vision. Inorder to fulfill it, you walk a path that is about much more than externalsuccess. The inner person is growing every step of the way. The group is havinghigher needs fulfilled. So how do you equip yourself to keep evolving? Personalcommitment plays a part, but to what do you commit? Once this question isanswered, you’ll know what your responsibilities actually are from day to day.Your soul doesn’t make any demands, because it isn’t involved in activity. Itfunctions as your source, the silent ground of your existence. Therefore yourresponsibility arises only when you have to act, think, and feel. Seeds areforever sprouting in silence. Each seed is a possibility arising from the fieldof infinite possibilities. A seed may sprout as your next thought. Yourresponsibility, then, is to make your next thought evolutionary—it shouldpromote growth and progress. But a possibility doesn’t always manifest as athought. It could be a sensation, an action, or a word. Possibilities encompassevery aspect of life. Your soul is capable of giving you anything you want, butthe other side of the bargain is that you are responsible for what you ask for.Knowing what to ask for can be quite subtle. However beautiful and inspiringyour overall vision, there are thousands of details that must be worked out on adaily basis. A leader may be dedicated to building world peace or to working fora sustainable economy or to finding an alternative to fossil fuels. Incomparison to such lofty goals, it seems petty to consider the next word you areabout to say, or the next sensation you will feel in your body. But these arepart of the fabric of life, and if they don’t evolve, your vision won’t evolve,either. The fabric of life is incredibly complex and interwoven, but we can findeight main strands, each with its own set of responsibilities. The joy oflooking at the subject from this perspective is that you will be taking onresponsibility not as a burden but as a way of nurturing yourself. Ask yourselfone question—“Will I evolve by doing this?”—and if the answer is yes, accept theresponsibility for your choice.A leader’s responsibilities can be divided into the following eight areas: I amresponsible for what I think; I am responsible for how I feel; I am responsiblefor how I perceive the world; I am responsible for my relationships; I amresponsible for my role in society; I am responsible for my immediateenvironment; I am responsible for my speech; I am responsible for my body. Nowlet’s take a look at each of these in more detail.I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT I THINK.This is the field of cognition, which is much broader than rational thoughts: italso covers insight, intuition, “gut feelings,” and creative impulses. Becausethey come to us spontaneously, we tend to accept that thoughts roam the mind atwill. If that’s true, how can we be responsible for mental impulses as they comeand go? After all, you don’t know what your next idea or hunch will be. Butthoughts come in patterns; you have habits of thinking. These you can takeresponsibility for. Promote the good habits and avoid the bad ones. Successfulleaders have learned to do both, often without knowing it (although a goodpercentage had to train their minds to meet the demands of being a leader).GOOD MENTAL HABITSThink clearly and concisely.Weed out prejudices and personal biases.Examine your assumptions to make sure they aren’t secondhand or unproved.Explore every thought in depth.Pay attention to subtle impulses, focusing on them until they expand and unfold.See each thought without judging or dismissing it prematurely.Walk around and see your thought from several angles.Be sure you aren’t influenced too much by stress, emotion, or the heat of themoment.Be above the drama of the situation.Each of these points is something you can take responsibility for. Left toitself, the untended mind is neither clear nor concise. It needs to be trainedto prune away repetition. In place of fuzzy, vague thinking, you shape yourthoughts clearly, wording them concisely. The same attention is needed for allthe other points. Unless we pay attention, prejudice creeps into our thinkingautomatically—that’s the nature of habit, to reappear on its own. Time and againyou have to pull up and say, “This isn’t what I want to think. It’s just oldconditioning from the past, a stale repetition of what I used to think.”With cognition, your overall responsibility is to be self-aware. Only you canspot the effect that emotions and stress are having. No outside perspective cansubstitute for yours, even though trusted advisers can bring you to your sensesby pointing out where you’ve lost clarity. Notice that two things are not on thelist: organization and discipline. Some leaders owe their success to having ahighly organized and disciplined mind. Examined closely, the need to force yourmind into a discipline is like training a wild animal whose behavior you don’ttrust and whose wildness is undesirable. But as restless as the mind can be, itis also the source of spontaneous answers and solutions. Spontaneity requiresfreedom, and it’s difficult for something to be free and disciplined at the sametime.Of course, your mind can’t be left ragged and wild. Even the pure artist whocannot tolerate rules or boundaries will accept the discipline of learning hiscraft. You can take your cue from that: discipline your mind as a means ofmastering your craft, but then let it be free. Otherwise you will dismiss toomany “stray” thoughts that in fact have something to tell you. In the same vein,allow every subtle impulse of the mind—the vaguest hunch or intimation—toexpand. This is particularly true when you feel a slight uh-oh. Under thepressure to agree with others, to find quick solutions, to be rid of a problem,we all jump to faulty conclusions. But the soul can’t be fooled by externals,and when you feel, however subtly, that something isn’t quite right, you musttrust yourself. In fact, the subtler the uh-oh, the more it can be trusted.I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR HOW I FEEL.Even more than thoughts, feelings seem to come and go at will. Beingspontaneous, emotions are often feared and distrusted. Nothing is more unwelcometo the mind than anxiety, and many a promising career has been undone by a badtemper. But we aren’t talking about trying to control fear, anger, or any otheremotion. (For one thing, programs for anger management and curing phobias havehad mixed results at best; even the promising field of positive psychology,which sets out to reframe negativity in a positive way, remains largelyunsupported by research.) But like thoughts, feelings fall into patterns, and bybeing aware of those patterns, you can take responsibility for changing them.A feeling is a response that seems to happen suddenly and automatically. If youare afraid of spiders, the sight of one causes you to recoil in fear. If dirtydishes in the sink make you angry, you can’t help being irritated when you walkinto the kitchen after a meal and see that someone has neglected to wash up. Butthis apparent lack of choice is deceptive. Think of what happens when somebodythrows a ball or a set of car keys at you. Even if you are caught off guard,either you will automatically put up your hand to catch it or you will move outof the way, mumbling “I can’t catch things.” These responses are opposites;somewhere in your life you either trained yourself to catch things or did not.Once trained, your response became ingrained, but you can always retrain it. Younever lose freedom of choice, and fortunately the most advanced brain researchindicates that new skills can be added to the brain over an entire lifetime.You have trained yourself to feel a certain way and to avoid feeling anotherway. The trick, if you truly take responsibility, is to replace a trainedfeeling with openness. We all value positive feelings over negative ones, but ifyou train yourself never to be negative, you miss the fact that “negativity” isactually a judgment against the self. It’s a label for “I am bad if I feel thisway.” We’ve all experienced the strain of being around people whose fixed smileand ever-present sunniness are unreal. Untraining your feelings means, first ofall, noticing patterns. If you automatically respond by doubting, for example,or by pushing away new things, if you cringe in the face of change or of newpeople suddenly appearing in your life, step back and notice your feelings.Having stepped back, wait and see. Quite often a first response will fade on itsown. When it does, an open space appears, and in that space you can guideyourself to the feeling you want to have. Don’t judge yourself. Let any feelingbe what it is, but at the same time don’t act on your fear, anger, resentment,envy, suspicion, or any other feeling that will promote stress in those aroundyou. Feelings are yours until you project them into the world. It’s yourresponsibility not to project what is harmful.When you have learned to experience an open space where once you filled it withautomatic reactions, something new appears. The soul begins to unfold its ownfeelings, which are always evolutionary. These aren’t passing emotional eventsbut a steady state of feeling. Silence, peace, and a calm sense of the selfdon’t come and go. Once you contact them, they give rise to what Buddhism callsthe four divine feelings: loving kindness, compassion, equanimity, and joy atthe success of others. But it’s not necessary to have a name for higherfeelings. (Labeling them might even tempt you to train your mind to be “good.”)All the higher emotions take us out of our separate selves. It’s the separateself that is trained to choose A over B, usually because the ego has decidedthat A contains a self-promoting benefit. Beyond the separate self there is anatural flow of feeling, and whatever reaction is appropriate will arise on itsown. The soul always aims to give you the most evolutionary response possible,and that goes for feelings, too.I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR HOW I PERCEIVE THE WORLD.Perception, like thinking and feeling, seems to be automatic. If I perceive thatthe sky is blue, this doesn’t seem like a choice, and you can only beresponsible for what you choose. But once again, the absence of choice isdeceptive. The one thing we do know is that possibility is never limited, sochoice must always be present. By definition, a leader is someone who can seemore possibilities than other people do. No matter what the hardship or setbackseems to be, evolution is at play. You can adopt a style of seeing the worldbased on this principle: higher evolution is unstoppable.The pioneering physicist Max Planck said, “When you change the way you look atthings, the things that you look at will change.” In a sense, this is howrelativity works at the soul level. As you shift your perception, reality shiftsto match. Therefore inner perception, which is your sense of self, is wherereality begins. The more expanded your sense of self, the more possibilities arereleased from the level of the soul. You will never run out of possibilitiesunless you limit them yourself. The cause of limitation is belief. Negativebeliefs act like censors. When faced with a set of possibilities, they say no tothe first appearance of things that they judge too dangerous, wrong, bad,impossible, not worth having, or “not me.” Your soul, on the other hand, wantsto deny you nothing, but you will never know that if your beliefs are blockingall but a few possibilities. Every possibility that cannot see the light of daydiminishes your future, doing its work invisibly and outside your awareness.What you need to do is become aware of these beliefs and then reverse them sothat you hold evolutionary beliefs instead.BELIEFS THAT BLOCK YOUR FUTUREI’m not good enough. I deserve less than other people.Reversal: The more I evolve, the more I deserve. Since evolution is unlimited,so is my deserving.Avoidance is a good way to postpone difficult decisions.Reversal: Postponement is never a solution. It simply freezes the problem inplace. If I solve the problem now, I have my whole future to enjoy the solution.It doesn’t help to focus on things that are wrong about me.Reversal: Problems aren’t bad. They are indications of where I need to grow.Beneath the difficulty lies a hidden ally. If I don’t focus on my problems, Iwill miss the path of my own evolution.The world is full of problems. What can just one person do?Reversal: Evolution carries humanity forward one person at a time. I can becomethe change I want to see. When that happens, I contribute to the collectiveconsciousness, and then everyone takes a step toward the critical mass requiredfor change on the global level.Change is too hard.Reversal: Life is nothing but change. Every cell in my body changes constantly,as do my thoughts, feelings, and the events around me. The real point is thatchange can be conscious or unconscious. Simply by becoming more aware, I havebecome a powerful agent of change. There is no need to force anything, only toexpand my awareness.We are prisoners of random events and accidents outside our control.Reversal: To be controlled by anything, including randomness, is to be a victim.Accidents are unknowable in advance. I have a choice to make the unknown eithermy friend or my enemy. As a friend, the unknown brings new life, new ideas, andnew possibilities. I will focus on that and let go of the rest.Everyone has enemies. I’d rather stay out of the fray and have as few enemies aspossible.Reversal: Enemy is just another word for obstacle. Whenever I meet an obstacle,my soul has put it there for a purpose and has provided a solution at the sametime. I don’t need to focus on what another person feels about me; my aim isn’tto make friends with everyone. Instead, I am here to evolve and follow the pathmy soul is unfolding day by day.I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR MY RELATIONSHIPS.Since relationships are two-sided, you can be responsible only for your part.But relating to someone else also brings a merging, so it isn’t easy to separateout what your part is. A leader follows one general rule: when things are goingwell, praise the other person; when things aren’t going well, be responsible forchanging them. If you wait for another person to change things, or themselves,you may wait forever. You must arrive at self-sufficiency, which is therealization that you are enough. You never need another person to complete you.Once this truly sinks in, you will stop asking others to change in order for youto feel better. It’s not their responsibility; it doesn’t show how much theycare; and no matter how hard they try, you might wind up feeling bad anyway.We’ve already discussed a more basic point. As a leader, you must commityourself to building relationships. That’s a necessary starting point but onethat many don’t reach. The undermining belief here is that relationships are toohard. You can reverse this belief by realizing that relationships, hard or easy,amount to everything in life. If you convince yourself that you can becompletely alone, you are deluded. Even if you escaped to a cabin at the NorthPole surrounded by vast emptiness, you would carry all your past relationshipswith you in your memories, habits, personality, and expectations.Every person is the sum total of relationships past and present. To takeresponsibility, a few guidelines apply:Clearly see the difference between past and present. Don’t inflict pastrelationships on present ones.Relate on the basis of shared positive values. Avoid relating on the basis ofprejudices and shared bias.As a leader, try to relate equally and impartially.Avoid making the other person wrong.Follow the Golden Rule: other people will sense when you are treating them theway you would want to be treated.Increase the other person’s self-esteem.In a way, the last point has become a kind of psychological Golden Rule. We’vecovered how a leader fulfills specific needs in the hierarchy of need. But youwill interact with others many times, and not every encounter is about need.What is common to every encounter is that one self makes contact with anotherself. Make sure that when you part, the other self feels nurtured, enhanced,validated, encouraged, or appreciated. This is the closest we come in everydaylife to one soul touching another. Relationship is a vast subject, but this isits spiritual essence.I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR MY ROLE IN SOCIETY.So far your responsibilities have been intimate and personal, but when weconsider society, many thousands of people are involved. Our connections becomemore invisible, too. You create an impact on society by casting a vote, choosingwhere to live, volunteering for certain causes, and giving to certain charities.But there has been a lot of recent research on connections that sociologistsnever anticipated. As a leader, you need to realize the power of “socialcontagion,” a term invented by researchers to describe how influence spreadsfrom one person to another.At the level of common sense, we all know that gossip and rumor have lives oftheir own, as do urban legends. Yesterday’s conspiracy theories give way totoday’s paranoid focus. But social contagion reaches deeper than common senseever indicated. Moods, attitudes, and habits are involved. If you are around adepressed family member, for example, you are more likely than average to becomedepressed yourself. But that’s also true if you know someone who has a depressedfriend, even when the person you know isn’t depressed.This is a very strange finding, but the data support it. You run a higher riskof being overweight or taking up smoking if a friend of a friend is overweightor smokes cigarettes. No one can account for these third-hand and evenfourth-hand influences. Yet these “degrees of separation” are actually degreesof bonding. Social contagion is real but invisible. It also cuts both ways.Positive influences have their own infectiousness, so if a friend of a friendhas good lifestyle habits or an optimistic outlook, you are more likely todevelop them, too. This means that if you want to be part of an invisible socialnetwork, it’s good to choose the one with the most positive and far-reachingeffects. You are having an influence even when you don’t sign up as an officialparticipant.Various catchphrases have cropped up to describe the power of influence.“Tipping point” and “critical mass” are among the most popular. They both referto a kind of chain reaction. At a certain moment enough people believe somethingthat its spread cannot be stopped. Innovators, politicians, advertisers, andmovie studios are in the business of creating tipping points, but in any fieldthe effect of critical mass is important. It takes a village to do anything, orrather it takes the social equivalent of cell division; ideas catch on byincreasing exponentially. (It’s no accident that popular videos on the Web “goviral,” indicating their infectious spread.)Social networking has become a necessity in the modern world, and the networksyou join or create should reflect your level of awareness:Join networks that specifically address your main purpose.Make positive, detailed contributions.Treat each message the way you would treat a personal encounter, with opennessand respect.Share your highest ideals and keep those ideals in mind every time you send amessage. Each transmission should reflect your core values, or at least not runcounter to them.Resist the temptation to amplify destructive gossip, rumors, and paranoidtheories.Keep in close, regular touch with the members of the network that matter most toyou. Don’t take up more personal networking than you are able to deal with.Although many types of messages are brief and fleeting, when you make extendedcontact, follow the golden rule of relationships: enhance the other person’sself-esteem.I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR MY IMMEDIATE ENVIRONMENT.We project ourselves into our surroundings, so every situation has its ownatmosphere. As soon as a new person enters a room, the atmosphere changes, ifonly a little. Leaders create big changes: their tone sets the kind ofenvironment that others experience. It doesn’t matter if you sit quietly and saynothing, your influence will still be powerful. But it can be difficult to readthe effect you are having. After all, the only way that you’ve seen peopleinteract all your life is with your being present. How they behave when you aresubtracted from the equation is an unknown.Spiritually, the projection that a person creates is total. You are the wholesituation that you find yourself in, creator of a continual mirroring effect.You can choose to accept or reject this principle, but it’s not very difficultto prove it to yourself. To do that, get into the habit of comparing “in here”and “out there.” To be self-aware, you must ask questions that reconnect insideand outside. The two domains are never separate, but we keep them that waythrough lack of awareness. Let’s take a look at four ways we shape ourexperience: mood, memory, expectation, and perception.Mood: Is the situation connected to my mood? At one level we all see the worldthrough glasses of different tints. The sunset doesn’t look the same to someonewho’s depressed and someone who’s in love. At a deeper level, the fact that youare outside looking at a sunset means that it is part of you; therefore, yourmood not only colors the sunset, it creates it. That is, when you are depressed,you aren’t looking at something beautiful and glorious without the ability toappreciate it: the sunset is depressing; for you, in this moment, it has noother way of being. Or think of someone you dearly love or heartily despise.When that person walks into the room, your feeling is part of her. As long asyou are the observer, she takes on the quality of your mood.Memory: Is the situation connected to something from my past? Your experience ofthe past creates the present. This, too, works at several levels. Obviously,when you see someone you recognize, you draw on memory; otherwise, the worldwould be full of strangers. It would also be full of strange objects. Indeed, itwould be a strange world. Memory also tells you that a car isn’t a painted lumpof metal but a machine that you know how to drive. All recognition is memory. Ata deeper level, you cannot undo memory: you can only see it for what it is. Abook is something you know how to read. You can’t make yourself turn the bookback into a collection of meaningless marks on a page the way it was when youwere two months old.Expectation: Is the situation what I expected it to be? Except in rareinstances, the answer is yes. Expectations precede involvement. As you getinvolved, your expectations guide what you think is happening. Imagine that youare about to meet a stranger. You hear that he is charming and witty. The momentbefore he walks into the room, however, someone whispers in our ear, “He’s awell-known con man.” The situation suddenly changes because your expectation hasbeen altered. At a deeper level, your expectations actually shape what othersare doing and saying. We subtly tune in to the expectations of others. We cansense whether they are going to be easy or difficult, open or self-involved,friendly or aloof. Silent signals shape all encounters. As for situations thatdefy expectation, usually the expectation was false or a projection: we arecovering up fear, apprehension, suspicion, or doubts. The “surprise” fulfillsthese more real but hidden expectations; it should be no surprise that all atonce you are aware of feelings you have denied and pushed out of sight.Perception: Am I seeing the situation through tinted glasses? Here the rule is“Seeing it so makes it so.” We’re talking about the subtlest level ofexperience, because perception is creative. Our belief that we passively observethe world is mistaken. As neurologists are quick to point out, every quality inthe world is created in the brain. Your visual cortex creates sunlight. Byitself, the sun’s radiation is a blank. It’s just a band of frequencies in theelectromagnetic field. With a different kind of brain, you might see the worldlit up by magnetism, or temperature, or even gravity. Raw data must betranslated into color, light, sound, texture, shapes, smells—indeed, everythingyou can possibly perceive.Taken to its deepest spiritual conclusion, you are perceiving nothing but yourcreation. If that sounds unbelievable, reverse the proposition. Can youparticipate in anything you don’t perceive? Neutrinos and gamma rays are passingthrough your body; hormone levels rise and fall; your metabolism regulatesitself according to how warm the room is and what you ate for breakfast. Youaren’t participating in these events because you can’t perceive them. Thespiritual aspect of this is that your soul perceives everything; therefore itparticipates in everything. There is no difference between regulating your liverenzymes and regulating the events that will happen to you today and the peopleyou’ll meet. At the soul level, perception creates everything. You may protestthat you cannot possibly be the creator of a rock and its hardness or a strangeron the bus and the words he will speak. Yet you control both in your dreams.Dreams are a domain of perception. They can have sight, sound, touch, taste, andsmell. But those sensations aren’t separate from us; we are the source of ourdreams and all that happens inside them. In the world’s wisdom traditions, thesame is true of reality “out there.” The same brain that creates every detail ofthe dream environment is responsible for every detail of the waking environment.If you don’t feel ready to make this spiritual leap, there’s no need to do so.Just keep testing whether or not the situation is you. The deeper you go, themore you will be convinced that it is.I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR MY SPEECH.The words you utter are events in their own right. They have an effect on otherpeople, which should never be forgotten. The reason I’ve saved thisresponsibility for next to last is that your words unfold thought, emotion,perception, relationships, and social role. Everything that came before isinvolved. Linguists tell us that speech does not serve only to communicateideas. A simple phrase is multidimensional. Think of everything we discoverthrough tone of voice, for example. In a moment you can assess fairly accuratelywhether the speaker is happy or sad, engaged or aloof, warm or cold, friend orstranger, open or closed, available or unavailable—and that barely scratches thesurface. (One prominent psychiatrist who had a long-running radio programclaimed that he could diagnose callers’ personality problems simply by hearingthem give their names.)When you take responsibility for your speech, you are going beyond just itscontent. This can be difficult. We all resist such comments as “I don’t likeyour tone,” “What are you trying to say?” “I know what this is really about,”and “You’re saying one thing and meaning another.” What bothers us is thereminder that we are revealing more than we want to, and yet we all know thatthis is going on. It’s natural for speech to be revealing on the level of how wefeel, what we want, what we’d like to hide, and what we expect the other personto understand. A leader takes responsibility for these additional dimensions.Once you take on this responsibility, two options are open to you. You candiscipline and control your speech, letting others receive only what you wantthem to. Or you can accept that being open is better, in which case you letpeople read into you what they want to read into you. The second option makesyou more vulnerable, but it’s the best choice, because people are going to readinto you all kinds of things that are beyond your control. The impression thatanybody has of you is his own creation. Since this is inescapable, shine yourlight as fully as you can. Keep as little as possible in the shadows. Don’tcreate ambivalent or inscrutable feelings on purpose. Be consistent in how youspeak. Observe the amenities of courtesy and respect for others. These are thenecessaries of owning your words and the effect they have on others. Speech is awindow on the soul. You will succeed far more by opening the window than bykeeping it shut.I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR MY BODY.You might think that taking care of your body is so basic that it should comefirst on the list. I’ve placed it last for a reason. Your body isn’t a machinemade of flesh and blood. Seen from the soul level, it is the projection of yourconsciousness. In fact, it is the most complete projection of who you are, moreso than your thoughts, feelings, and words, which come and go. Your body is aconstant projection of you in the world. Every cell eavesdrops on your thoughts.You cannot respond to the world without affecting your tissues and organs.Without a body you cannot connect to the universe; therefore your body is thevehicle of your evolution.Every leader wants to be tuned in. You can’t tune in without a body—that much isself-evident—but the quality of how you tune in is quite subtle. The loss of anhour’s sleep, for example, distorts reflexes and blurs perception almost as muchas losing half a night’s sleep. A heavy, fatty meal with a glass of wine dullsthe mind and makes decisions less reliable. Depleted biological energy, whetherfrom disease, fatigue, or stress, can’t help but deplete mental energy. Themind-body connection isn’t like a lamp plugged into a wall socket. It’s ahundred billion neurons all plugged into one another and then into trillions ofcells throughout the body. The same is true of our interactions with the world.All feedback loops begin and end with the body.Once you see your body as a projection of all that you are, takingresponsibility for it is no longer the choice to sign up for the gym or orderingfish instead of steak. Think of your body as metabolizing the world, taking inmore than just food, water, and air; your body is metabolizing every experience.This is because every experience uses energy supplied by food, air, and water.Chemical reactions transform raw data into “my” experience; you take possessionby literally internalizing every sight and sound. What was once “out there” isnow “in here,” and thanks to cellular memory, it is likely to remain with youfor a long time.This perspective doesn’t change the basics of a healthy lifestyle, which arefamiliar: a balanced diet low in fat, regular exercise with a focus oncardiovascular impact, good sleep, meditation, and stress management. However,it brings you closer to a simple truth: your body exists to serve you. But itcan only give what it has to give, no more. If you see your body asconsciousness that has taken material form, it’s clear that it has much more togive you through its awareness. The physical gift of awareness is present whenthe body is light, bright, flexible, energized, balanced, and quick to respond.Since these are all qualities you want as a leader, one way to have them is bytaking responsibility for your body.We’ve covered eight areas of life that you are responsible for, but please notethat they don’t add to your burden as a leader. Each can be masteredeffortlessly once you are committed to being guided by your soul. As you evolve,divisions disappear. Mind, body, behavior, and speech begin to flow together.Then you begin to master not just the art of leadership but the art of living.Your soul starts to influence you in everything you do, and as it does, the gapbetween you and your soul closes. Wholeness starts to dominate. In the nextsection we’ll see how life is transformed in wholeness. The miraculous becomesnormal; the field of possibilities loses every limitation. Before that canhappen, however, you must be responsible for all that you are and want to be.THE LESSONS OF RESPONSIBILITY• Leading from the soul means taking responsibility for your evolution and theevolution of others. Evolution is an unstoppable force. By aligning with it, youwill benefit yourself and everyone around you.• In every area of life, from mind and body to personal relationships and thesocial role that you play, your soul can bring continual progress. No aspect ofthe situation is ever left out.• In spiritual terms, the situation is you. Every experience reflects your levelof consciousness. The inner and outer world merge at the level of the soul.Being responsible ultimately comes down to accepting the wholeness of life.WHAT TO DO TODAYThis chapter outlines a plan for encouraging your own evolution and theevolution of others. But this involves the reverse as well—not discouraging theforce of evolution. You are the soul of the group. Your behavior acts like amagnet, attracting similar behavior. In spiritual terms the impulse to grow andexpand is an unstoppable force, yet we can resist it and make choices thatundermine our growth. When a leader stands against evolution, the whole groupwill be affected.Today take some time to look closely at yourself and ask if you are displayingany of the following behaviors that serve to undermine evolution.10 DISCOURAGING BEHAVIORSI obsess over risks. I keep worrying about what can go wrong.I don’t face a problem, even when it is staring me in the face.I secretly want the group to do what I want.I haven’t taken responsibility for my last bad decision and its consequences.I blame people around me; I make excuses for myself.I crave approval and reassurance.I don’t delegate authority, or I delegate it but keep a tight grip on alldecisions.I look out for myself more than for the group.I only listen to the same few voices in my inner circle.I find myself lying or covering up the truth.You must be vigilant about these traps because in mild or severe form, theylower the group’s consciousness. Physics uses the term entropy to describe howenergy dissipates in the universe. Wrong behavior has its own quiet way ofsapping energy. But eventually there will be a price to pay, as the groupfalters and stagnates, or becomes unfocused and divisive.If you adopt evolutionary behavior instead, you will be serving the soul’spurpose, which is to raise the consciousness of the group.Your soul gave you a desire to live a greater truth. In practical terms, youneed to reverse each discouraging behavior, as follows:10 EVOLUTIONARY BEHAVIORSDon’t obsess over risks. Keep your focus on positive outcomes.Face problems when they are still in seed form.Be attuned to the group’s needs first and foremost.Take responsibility for your last bad decision, and then let it go.Don’t blame others or make excuses for yourself.Be immune to the good or bad opinion of others.Show confidence in those to whom you delegate authority.Be generous in giving rather than taking.Open yourself to every avenue of information and wise counsel.Promise yourself to tell the truth, particularly when it’s most tempting to lie.Evolutionary behavior can’t be forced–it has to be cultivated. Many successfulleaders learn how to evolve naturally, as the result of being tuned in to theirinner voices and guided by intuition. Destructive behavior has a way of weedingout bad leaders through failure. But the behaviors listed above are aligned withthe evolutionary power of the soul, invisibly bringing that power to aid andsupport you. Right behavior keeps you subtly aligned with evolution itself, thetendency for all things to organically grow and expand."},{"pageContent":"SEVENS = SYNCHRONICITYEvery leader needs support, and no support is more powerful than that providedby the soul. It offers a continuous stream of small and large gifts from themystery. This is the work of synchronicity, the unseen intelligence that putsyou in the right place at the right time. The first six letters of L-E-A-D-E-R-Sgave you the preparedness for a leap in awareness, the leap that allows you tolive from the level of your soul. Here miracles are normal. Invisible powerscome to your aid. They make your vision a certainty.Successful visionaries expect miracles because they trust in constant supportfrom the soul. It is a natural and easy way to live. You allow your true self tounfold; then you can open the same path to those you lead and serve.As we will see, synchronicity is never accidental; it has a purpose. Itvalidates that your motive is true. It proves that your trust in the soul iswell placed. As your awareness expands, you will receive messages from the soulthat are unmistakable. All you need to do is to open yourself up and receivethem.This final aspect of leadership is more mysterious than the others. Successfulleaders can all look back at small miracles in their lives, but successfulvisionaries look back at major miracles. A small miracle involves a stroke ofluck, or being in the right place at the right time. A major miracle is verydifferent. The impossible turns into a certainty, and higher guidance intervenesand alters the course of your life. The soul can create miracles for anyone; thelimitations are in ourselves. Remove those limitations, and nothing will ever bethe same again.Leading from the soul involves having the kind of support that is hidden frommost people. This doesn’t mean trying to get God on your side. God is oneveryone’s side, because God is how we conceive of the infinite power thatorganizes creation. If the soul is your link to this power, it can arrange anyevent in time and space. The term for such arranged events is synchronicity. Thebasic definition, “a meaningful coincidence,” really isn’t adequate to describewhat happens. Coincidences link two unlikely happenings—for example, twostrangers meet and have the same last name, or went to the same schools.Synchronicity, on the other hand, alters events to bring in more meaning. Twopeople meet, and one has the answer to a problem the other hasn’t been able tosolve, and in the process a tiny seed of an idea is given an enormousopportunity to grow. A personal dream is suddenly given the chance to becomereality.When leaders are asked why they are outstanding successes, they reply using goodluck more often than any other phrase—they realize that they have ledexceptional lives but have no model to explain it. Synchronicity is the rightmodel. It describes a fundamental process in the universe. Your body dependsupon unimaginable synchronicity. Out of one hundred billion brain cells, eachlooks out for its own food, air, and water, as a paramecium or amoeba looks outfor itself in a green pond on a mild summer day. Yet somehow brain cells act inperfect coordination. Every thought is an exquisitely choreographed dance.Billions of neurons are coordinating in order for you to read this sentence. Novisible system connects them. Synchronicity has created a major miracle on analmost invisible scale. If it were to occur on a large scale, it would be as ifevery person on earth said the same sentence at the same moment without planningit in advance. Coincidence cannot come close to describing what is happeninghere.At truly synchronous moments, the universe is embracing you, and you see who youreally are. The real you is not separate and isolated. The world you experienceis not random but one where events are constantly being shuffled to bring youthe best result possible. Leaders are expected to produce results, so it’s notsurprising that the greatest leaders share the secret of synchronicity. Theyrely on invisible powers to come to their aid. Your personal vision needs thesame support, and you can learn to cultivate it. Miracles in your life indicatethat you have a strong connection to your soul. Regard them as sudden leaps inyour evolution. Once you expect synchronicity to be there when it is needed, itwill be. Then you can pass the benefit on to everyone around you.UPGRADING THE NORMALTo maximize your access to the miraculous, you can take practical steps. If youfollow them, you can become a successful visionary, the goal that gives thisbook its reason for being.THE PATH TO MIRACLESRegard synchronicity as normal.Look for the hidden message.Go where you are guided.Be here in the present.Understand the harmony of contained conflicts.Encourage unity; discourage divisions.Align yourself with a new belief: “I am the world.”As you can see, some of these steps are internal; they involve changing your oldbeliefs and expectations. Others are external; they involve how you act in theworld and relate to others.REGARD SYNCHRONICITY AS NORMAL.Your first step is to reverse any belief that synchronicity is abnormal. Withoutit life couldn’t exist. Ecology is exquisitely coordinated. A cat put inside asealed jar will die from lack of oxygen. A fern put into a sealed jar will diefrom lack of carbon dioxide. But put them together, and they will survive. On aplanetary scale, this delicate interdependence goes far beyond mere survival:Nature provides a setting for all species to thrive and evolve. You are part ofthe same stream of life. You were designed to thrive and evolve in the ecologythat surrounds and enmeshes you. Many would say that the events of a lifetimeare random. Certainly in the materialist worldview randomness dominates:intelligence is a secondary accident that somehow produced the human brainthrough trial and error. If you accept this worldview, of course you wouldregard synchronicity as no more than a small example of an intriguingcoincidence.Despite accidents and chance, however, in our everyday experience, we rely onawareness, wherever it comes from. Theory is one thing; practice is another. Ourlives mean something. We don’t have to claim that a higher power is at work;it’s much simpler to say that intelligence exists everywhere. Think about asynchronous event in your life, when you met a stranger who turned out to play avery significant role. If pure chance were at work, the odds would be millionsto one. It is simpler—and according to the principle of Occam’s razor thereforemore logical—to say that the meeting was meant to be, that a guidingintelligence is working invisibly, shaping the event to serve a purpose. In theworld’s wisdom traditions, this explanation extends to a person’s whole life.Successful visionaries adopt this belief because it has proved valid in theirown lives.Visionaries feel connected to a larger purpose.They experience a dream coming true.They have prayed and received an answer.They sense that their lives are deeply meaningful.They feel guided from within.They rely upon significant synchronicity.They walk the path that was destined for them.You don’t have to convince yourself that these things are true. They becometrue, easily and naturally, as consciousness expands. In fact they becomecommonplace. Synchronicity isn’t a form of divine favoritism that puts a fewprivileged people ahead of the rest of us. Everyone is totally and equallysupported from the level of the soul.LOOK FOR THE HIDDEN MESSAGE.If your soul is sending you messages at this moment, you need to receive them.This is no different from having a conversation with someone. If you ignore whatthe other person says, the dialogue comes to an end. In most lives, dialoguewith the soul is very tenuous and shaky. Being able to receive the soul’smessages makes a real difference, but the difference is easier to describe bywhat is absent than by what is present.You don’t feel uncared for and unloved.You aren’t isolated and alone.Your actions aren’t dictated by habit and random impulses.Your existence has stopped being a riddle.You are not a victim.I could have used the positive form of each statement (“You feel cared for andloved,” “Your existence becomes meaningful,” etc.), but I want to emphasize theproblems that have gone away. There are moments when changes are so easy to see,they can’t be missed. The first day you recover from a cold, you can’t help butnotice that you aren’t stuffed up and achy anymore. But over time this contrastdisappears. The same is true spiritually. You may suddenly notice that you nolonger feel lonely or misunderstood or unsafe in the world, if those were onceproblems for you. But most of the time there is simply a flow of connectionsthat feels unremarkable.“Look for the hidden message” means taking a moment to notice the negativethings that have slipped away: fear, uncertainty, threat, anger, resentment,envy, struggle, external obstacles, inner voices that criticize and judge you,traumatic memories, toxic relationships, guilt, and shame. It’s a long list, andmost of us rarely dwell on it. As your awareness expands, however, you willnotice that items on the list will steadily fade away, and your life will bemore smoothly and easily knit together. That is a sign that you are in truedialogue with the soul.GO WHERE YOU ARE GUIDED.Once the dialogue with your soul is set up, it leads somewhere. It guides you onyour path. But if your guide is silent, how do you know if you are heeding it?The clearest indication is that your ego no longer dominates your thinking.We’ve discussed the ego in Chapter Five [Chop_9780307451729_epub_c05_r1.htm];contrasting its focus on “I, me, and mine” with transpersonal values, where theperspective is “us.” As awareness expands, your ego’s role becomes more and morethat of the observer. Less and less will it make demands that you must heed.The soul’s guidance doesn’t come in the form of instructions, such as “Don’t beso selfish” or “Think about other people more.” Being silent, the soul worksdifferently—it makes old habits less satisfying. The sensation is like walkingon solid ground that suddenly stops supporting you. Someone might make youangry, for example, but instead of going off on them and feeling justified inyour anger, you find that the feeling of anger just evaporates. Guidance is thegradual melting away of ego and all its familiar responses: anger, fear,resentment, jealousy, and the constant need to compare yourself to others.You can see yourself being guided in the following stages:THE STAGES OF PERSONAL CHANGE1. Being stuck: I am used to acting this way. It fits who I am. The situationcalls for me to react this way. What’s the problem? I don’t have one.2. First doubts: My reaction doesn’t feel quite right. I have twinges of guilt.It’s as if I can’t help myself, but I wish I could.3. Self-questioning: I need to stop reacting this way. It’s pointless; it nolonger feels right. If I am ever going to change, these old habits have to go.4. Seeking change: I catch myself reacting and do my best to stop. Others know Iwant to change, and they help and encourage me. I notice people who don’t reactthe way I do. I want to be like them.5. Finding change: I have more control over my reactions. I have learned how tolet go. I get no satisfaction from the way I used to behave. I don’t evenrecognize the person I used to be.6. Reintegration: I’m new. There are traces of my old reactions, but they barelyinfluence me. I don’t think about who I used to be. I am clear about who I amand happy with the person I see inside.Although synchronicity is experienced privately and subjectively, being familiarwith these six stages of personal change is very useful to any leader. As aleader, your role is to motivate change, so you need to recognize its symptoms.People rarely have a sudden epiphany that causes them, Scrooge-like, to exchangethe very bad for the very good. In real life, Scrooge flirts with being nicerand less stingy, takes small steps in a new direction, and often backslides. Butchange is occurring. As a leader, you can encourage it every step of the way bynoticing and being sympathetic. Look upon yourself as midwife to a fragilebirth. Express your appreciation at the smallest signs of the new as it emerges.BE HERE IN THE PRESENT.In recent years the power of now has become a favorite spiritual topic. Beingpresent has an undeniable appeal. Joy and happiness can only occur right thismoment. If you dwell on past joys and wish for future happiness, they are notyours now. But the present is tricky. By definition, now lasts only a splitsecond before it turns into the past.There are instances when people experience being totally present. Theirexistence becomes free of all burdens. An inner illumination fills everythingthey see. The mundane is transformed into the extraordinary, the dull into thebrilliant. At the same time, however, they feel a disturbing loss of balance.The present moment can feel a lot like freefall. There’s no rope to hang on toconnecting past, present, and future. Nothing is certain anymore.Therefore it’s better to adapt to the present by stages. Your soul is always inthe present, so it’s not the now that you must seize. It cannot be seizedanyway. Respect the part of you that wants to cling to the familiar. Encouragethe part that wants to be open to the new. Here’s another way to enter into theprocess:• Be centered. If you notice that you have lost your center, pause and returnthere.• Remain open to your surroundings—let information and impressions flow infreely.• If you find yourself saying or doing what you habitually do, catch yourself.Pause and stand back. It’s okay not to react. Leave an open space for somethingnew.• Appreciate the present moment. Notice what is nourishing about it. Take amoment to really look at the people you are with.• If judgment, anger, or anxiety starts to color your mood, don’t resist. Tellthe negative feeling that you will pay attention to it later. Follow up yourpromise by contacting the feeling again to see if it still needs to be dealtwith.• Expect the best. Look for positive signals in the situation. These signals maycome from other people, but they can also be simply a good feeling in the air.Ask that good feeling to come in and uplift you.• Don’t open doors to the past. Nostalgia and reliving old times can bepleasant, but the bad parts about the past are given entry at the same time. Ifold memories come to you, look at them and let them be what they are, but don’tdo anything active with them.By meditating and remaining centered, you will get glimpses of the present quitesoon. The more you expand your awareness, the more naturally you will be presentwithout effort. One of the most obvious signs is that you feel lighterphysically, but any experience of being carefree, safe, welcomed, filled withlight, uplifted, or inspired is a gift from the present moment. In time thesemoments will merge into a continual experience. When that happens, the now willbe your home forever.UNDERSTAND THE HARMONY OF CONTAINED CONFLICTS.The soul doesn’t engage in conflict. When you feel pulled to defend your notionof right and wrong, you can certainly keep it and achieve some beneficialthings. There are many wrongs to confront in this world. But you won’t be actingfrom the soul. Spiritually, the way to deal with the eternal war between lightand dark, right and wrong, creation and destruction is to go beyond the battle.When this happens, you see that explicit enemies are implicit allies: neitherside can exist without the other. There is no good to fight for unless someoneelse is made to be bad or wrong. I know that this is a difficult shift; we canall think of horrors that seem absolute and must be defeated. But let go ofmoral arguments for a moment, and regard how Nature works. When two animals arepredator and prey, like the lion and the gazelle, life encloses them in the samecircle. When a rose blooms, it is paired with molds that turn the dead blossomsinto compost. Mold isn’t beautiful; decomposition stinks, unlike the fragranceof a rose. Yet without the other, neither can exist. To go beyond good and evilis simply to see the larger whole that embraces opposites. Wholeness containsconflicts, but they serve the greater good by keeping creation and destructionin balance.One reason we can miss the opportunities that the soul provides is that we shutout experience in advance, labeling certain things as unacceptable. For peacefulpeople it is unacceptable to use force. For self-contained people it isunacceptable to lose control of one’s emotions. If you look at your own valuesystem, you can make a personal list of “what I will never do.” Take a momentand make such a list. Once you’ve finished, realize this: you are tied to thethings you resist. The tie is unconscious but still powerful. What if you had anabusive parent and grew up swearing to yourself that you would never inflict thekind of harm you suffered through? Yes, you would consciously become a betterperson, but unconsciously you would have defined yourself through your abuser,limiting your freedom to experience everything.Resist a moral interpretation. I’m not saying that you should choose to abuseothers, not at all. Rather, look at the closed compartments that need to beopen. For example, many children of abuse find it very hard to trust anyoneafter they grow up; trust is a closed compartment. Others find it hard to showcompassion for “bad” people; still others adopt rigid codes of behavior thatthey impose on themselves and others. When the soul brings messages ofcompassion, openness, and nonjudgment, the person shuts them out because theydon’t fit her fixed beliefs. There is resistance instead of receptivity.This is understandable, but in terms of synchronicity, compartmentalizing yourmind is very limiting. Now you receive only what is acceptable. And if youalready know what is good and bad in advance, you have no real need for a soul.You have no intention of growing beyond your fixed belief system. But the soulis all about growing. To be receptive to the harmony of contained conflicts,practice the following steps:• Take the long view. Try to see how the worst things in your past benefitedyou. Have faith that setbacks in the present will also benefit you down theroad.• Realize that everyone is defined by his level of consciousness. What lookseasy to change from your perspective looks binding from his.• Accept that everyone is doing the best she can from her level of awareness.This can be difficult when others are doing things you strongly disapprove of.But you can come closer to acceptance if you add a second point: no matter howbadly people are behaving, they, too, have souls, which means that at some levelthey yearn for positive change.• Investigate in depth how Nature balances creation and destruction. Gestation,birth, growth, maturity, and decay exist at every level of the cosmos. Insteadof attaching yourself only to one aspect of this cycle, resolve to embrace itall. This is how your soul views reality.• On a behavioral level, fight the good fight if it calls out to you, but resistbecoming a polarizing force. Whatever it takes, see some good in your adversary.Show respect, and bend over backward to negotiate before the fight begins. Avoidrelationships with people who can see good only in their position. Anyone whovilifies the other side is creating enemies, which is ultimately moredestructive than anything else. You may be victorious, but your enemies willpersist after the conflict is over.ENCOURAGE UNITY; DISCOURAGE DIVISIONS.In the section on team building, we discussed the value of negotiatingdifferences so that the group doesn’t splinter. Now we have to look deeper. Youhave taken on the part of leading from the soul because you are on a personaljourney, the journey to higher consciousness. As seen by the soul, your visionwill ultimately be fulfilled only when you reach enlightenment. Enlightenment isabout the reconciliation of opposites. Unity replaces differences; wholenessbecomes a living reality. At that point everything human will be part of you.Knowing that this is the end point of your journey, act as if you have alreadyarrived. Be a force for bringing opposites together. Opposites begin with youyourself. They find voice in some typical responses:I have an angel on one shoulder and a devil on the other.I feel ambivalent. I can’t commit.Some days I love the person I’m with. Other days there’s no love at all.I swing between self-esteem and feeling unworthy.Am I real or a fraud? I’m afraid that somebody is going to see through me oneday and expose me.I’m grown up, but I still feel as helpless as a child.If others love me, why do I feel so lonely?These are the beliefs of someone who is divided against himself. Self-divisiongets projected outward. It’s impossible to truly accept others when you haveserious doubts about yourself. This is one of the few hard-and-fast rules aboutspirituality. Behind it lies a larger truth: you can give only what you have togive. If you don’t have self-esteem, you can’t find worth in others. The same istrue for love, compassion, and forgiveness. All will be yours to give once youapply them to yourself.Society doesn’t teach us how to grow spiritually, and therefore most people getstuck in the endless games that opposites play. Most leaders, in fact, aretrapped in divisiveness because it serves them. They foster winners instead oflosers. They want more for “us” and less for “them.” They identify rivals tobeat, market shares to grab, weak companies to gobble up, and areas where noconcession is possible.Here, leading from the soul is simple: if you have to tear somebody down inorder to feel bigger, don’t do it. Seek positive reasons to build up yoursituation without needing an adversary. Heal your own divisions, and you willradiate a sense of worth that has no need to tear down anyone else. The soul’smotto is “I am enough,” and as your awareness expands, you will become enough.From that point on, you will exhibit the generosity and compassion for thefallen that is a hallmark of the greatest visionaries.ALIGN YOURSELF WITH A NEW BELIEF: “I AM THE WORLD.”Here too you can live the goal before you reach it. None of us were raised tobelieve that we were the world. The statement sounds almost unintelligible. Eventhe ego would blush at such a gross exaggeration. But saying “I am the world” isactually humble. It’s your acknowledgment that you are a thread in the tapestryof life. Just as the complete code of DNA is enclosed in every cell, you containevery aspect of consciousness. What the world is made of, so it is with you. Youleave nothing out except by choice. There are many such choices, however, andwe’ve all made them.Every label you identify with excludes something else: my race, my gender, mynationality, my education, my status. Each label is one thing, but in possessingthat one thing, you push away many other things: all other races, nationalities,education levels, social roles, and people of the opposite gender. Labels aredefensive. It’s no accident that they allow you to reject everything that is“not me.” Life feels much safer when you draw a circle around your identity anddon’t step outside it.There are two types of leaders, then: those who defend the circle and those wholook beyond it. The first stance is much easier to adopt; people are usuallyinsecure without defenses, so the tighter their circle is, the better they feel.The second role belongs to the visionary. It speaks to a deeper yearning.Inside, we all know that human beings are one. The same joy and suffering infuseevery life. This knowledge is something we try to shut out, but we cannot fullyturn it away because being human comes from the soul. To insist that the outsideworld is “not me” is unreal. No matter how tightly you draw your family, tribe,race, or nationality around you, the result is not greater safety but isolationand illusion.Real freedom lies outside the circle. It’s the people you never expected to bondwith, the viewpoints that are completely different from your own, and the ideasyou never considered that will liberate you. We speak of meeting needs, bothyours and the group’s. But needs are only stepping-stones to one goal:liberating the spirit within. “I am the world” affirms that your real nature isspirit. It speaks of wanting to experience everything. If you align yourselfwith this deep yearning, you will be guided by the soul every day of your life.Nothing can stand in your way when you drop the foolish notion that you mustaccept boundaries. By nature you are unbounded.At journey’s end you will be whole. All the inner divisions that gave rise todoubt and conflict will be healed. So what good does it do to postpone that day?The unknown is a magnet drawing you closer to liberation. When you look for thenext horizon, you are reaching for a new place inside yourself. Each new placewhispers that the soul is near, until one day you merge with it, and then yourbeing and the eternal Being are one.THE LESSONS OF SYNCHRONICITY * Leading from the soul means gaining the support of invisible powers. You expect miracles to come to your aid. You trust in your soul to organize events to bring about the best results. * Synchronicity isn’t mystical. It is evidence of the hidden intelligence that pervades the universe. This intelligence coordinates everything in creation, and if you are open to it, it can coordinate the creation of your vision. * In spiritual terms, every visionary is on a personal journey. Each need that you fulfill, for yourself or for the group, is a stepping-stone to liberation. When you are free, you will be whole. Looking back, you will see that every miracle, large or small, was the exact thing you needed to reach fulfillment.WHAT TO DO TODAYSynchronicity is normal once you remove the obstacles that block it. Today youcan do that by divesting yourself of labels. When you say “I am X,” you arelabeling yourself. The more strongly you identify with any label, the moreclosed off you will be. You will miss all kinds of experiences that fall intothe category of “not me,” which in reality are just not your label, which is avery different thing. In the absence of labels, you will be much morecomfortable with everyone and everything. “All of this is me” is the ideal wayto live. To divest yourself of labels, here are some suggestions:• Instead of being labeled by your name, give anonymously to a good cause.• Instead of being labeled by your race, volunteer for a cause that helpsminority members.• Instead of being labeled by gender, join a group that aids battered women orprovides shelter for homeless men.• Instead of being labeled by your job, spend some time doing a job that is muchlower on the prestige scale.• Instead of being labeled by your money, go to the poorest part of town andvolunteer there.Many of these suggestions qualify as good works, but primarily they are intendedto take you beyond a narrow sense of who you are. If you carry your labels withyou, no matter where you go you will be constrained by them. So approach thesesuggestions with the intent of becoming part of the scene, engaging at the levelof shared spirit. Measure your success by ridding yourself of labels, which alsodivests others of theirs. Does that seem to be happening?A leader should aspire to be the soul of the group. You can attain this goal inany group once you see the soul in everyone else. In the phrase “all men arecreated equal,” the verb is in the present tense. It’s not that all men (andwomen) “were created equal.” Creation happens at every moment. Life refreshesand renews us. If you allow this process to touch you deeply, you won’t needlabels of any kind. To be a wave on the ocean of life will be glorious enough."},{"pageContent":"PART TWOTWO WHO LEAD FROM THE SOUL"},{"pageContent":"EIGHTJEREMY MOON,FOUNDER AND CEO OF ICEBREAKERIcebreaker is the little company that put New Zealand’s merino wool on the map.Nothing about the budding enterprise was conventional. When Icebreaker was tenyears old, in 2005, a local reporter described its headquarters in Wellington,on New Zealand’s South Island, as having “the look and feel of a giganticstudent party,” while founder Jeremy Moon was “wide-eyed and tousle-haired.” Yetbehind this youth-oriented casualness, he was doing some serious rethinkingabout how a company should be in the world, and what modern enterprise shouldstand for.Jeremy grew his company by making every step part of his own journey, in which avision unfolded first in consciousness and then took shape in the real world ofbusiness. His is the story of a young man who had a single experience thatchanged his life. Today Icebreaker is a massive team effort, focused on buildingthe most sustainable clothing business in the world. It uses beautiful,renewable, biodegradable merino wool sourced from the Southern Alps of NewZealand. As Jeremy sees it, this effort is wholly true to that first experiencethat ignited his enthusiasm.WHEN I STARTED Icebreaker, I was twenty-four, broke, and had absolutely no ideawhat I was doing. But I was driven by a passion for what I saw was possible, anda belief that I could make it happen. That passion was ignited by a meeting witha merino sheep farmer. Across the dining table, he threw me a T-shirt made froma merino wool fabric he’d designed himself. It felt soft and sensuous andnothing like regular wool. The shirt could be washed in the washing machinerather than by hand; it was silky and soft rather than itchy, and it felt lightinstead of heavy.I thought, “Wow! This is an amazingly beautiful, practical, natural material.This is a product I could sell around the world.” You see, from the firstmoment, I imagined myself flying around the globe and having a great time. I hadno idea how a business based on merino wool could work, but I had a strongfeeling that I could make it happen. My training is in cultural anthropology andmarketing, so I was interested in the meaning of objects, and I knew how todevelop plans for bringing ideas alive.I buried myself for two months in my bedroom, setting out how I could build aninternational brand from New Zealand. This took vision. New Zealand isn’t agreat place to build a company from—no one knows where we are, and we don’t haveany neighbors. But it’s a great place to live and connect with the world. Mybusiness plan set out the basic steps that would have to happen to turn thisdream into a reality. Who would be on the team? How would we raise money? Howcould we set up manufacturing and sell our products?I screwed up the courage to quit my job and borrow seed money. The going wasslow. It took five years to get a sense of what I was doing. Those years werepure desire and perseverance. I put in huge amounts of hard work and facedequally huge amounts of frustration and angst. I worked seventy to one hundredhours a week. I had to commit myself totally to the business because if itfailed, I would have been bankrupt. Never once did I lose my ability to see thebig picture. I never doubted that it was possible to succeed. My mantra was“This will work if I don’t screw it up.” I took full responsibility for myfuture.I’ve learned a few things about leadership over the past fifteen years, and I’dlike to share them with you. For me, leadership has been an evolving journey.Someone once told me that when you’re running your own business, you have morebreakthroughs and breakdowns in a month than most people have in a year. Itcertainly felt like that to me. Every few years I’ve had to critically review myown performance and that of the business to find better ways to lead the peopleI work with, and to provide better products for our customers.I didn’t start off wanting to be a leader. Rather, I connected with merino woolfiber on a deep level because of my identity as a New Zealander, my love ofadventure, and my belief in nature. Leadership began when I had to enroll othersin the Icebreaker concept. Money wasn’t everything. I wanted people who caredand could help me. I had the ideas and the belief, but I didn’t have theexperience or the wisdom. Friends introduced me to their fathers who had beensuccessful in business. One of them, a banker, asked me where my financialswere. “What are financials?” I said. He offered to show me, and after threeweeks of coaching, we had our first financial projections.An early investor taught me how important employees were in business. Idiscovered it was critical to make everyone feel a part of Icebreaker, and Ilearned to run it as an extended family business. This appealed to me because Icome from a strong family, and I wanted something that people could share in.I put more than half of my initial capital into design. People thought I wasmad, but more than anything else I wanted to create a deep, guiding brand storythat was true and real. It was the story of a fiber grown on an animal thatlived in the mountains of New Zealand, a fiber that could be developed into aclothing system that enabled people to go back into the mountains and reconnectwith nature. We mined this deep and powerful cycle to create a compelling visualstory that inspired the creation of the product. I loved it. I felt alive. Mycreativity was awakening.For a country known for three things–adventure, natural beauty, and sheep—it’sironic that the entire outdoor clothing market in New Zealand was dominated bysynthetics based on polyester and polypropylene. Why couldn’t we wear somethingnatural? Merino was a high-performance technical fiber that no one knew about.This was a great possibility, but the barriers to entry were huge. When Istepped into the marketplace, synthetics were king and wool was dead. It was upto me to convince people otherwise.My first employee was Michelle Mitchell, a good friend who had such confidencein what I was doing that she gave up her law career to join me. Together webegan to develop the core values of the business. Michelle told me, “A personwith integrity is the same person at work as they are at play.” I found thisidea inspiring and immediately committed myself to putting it at the heart ofIcebreaker. We opened ourselves to information from all sides. Our retailerstaught us about the garment industry and gave me feedback on what worked andwhat didn’t. Our suppliers taught us how to make clothes, how to use awarehouse, and how to deliver our goods. I was also learning from the otherpeople who were joining the business. Some nights I was so excited I couldn’tsleep. I felt my mind and soul expanding.We chewed through most of our capital the first year and had forty retailcustomers by the second year, when the first revenue started coming in. In ourthird year three more employees were added, all young and inexperienced. Nothingseemed to work out the way we wanted it to, and everything was difficult. Therewere frustrations and tears, and lots and lots of late nights. But we weredetermined that Icebreaker would succeed. Slowly we learned how to work togetheras a team. We started experimenting with styling. We’d put garments on the tableand arrange chopped-up bits of fabric on top to see what they looked like. Notsurprisingly, our initial styling was very simple, but there was a certainbeauty in that: it was honest, it was functional, and the fabric looked and feltbeautiful.We knew we were onto something special because our customers kept coming backfor more. They told us their Icebreaker garments felt fantastic, workedbrilliantly, lasted for ages, and were the best things they’d ever worn. A majorchange came when we started adding color to our products. I know, it’sunbelievable that a clothing company didn’t realize that color was important.Our first garments were blue and white, and then we added green, red, and black.(“Who’s going to buy black?” I said. Now it’s our best-selling color.)As we grew, we discovered that when lightweight merino garments are worntogether, air is trapped in between each layer, increasing the level ofinsulation—the layers lock together like a single garment, only warmer. It was abreakthrough, and it inspired us to evolve Icebreaker from an underwear range toa full layering system. Fifteen years on we now have offices in eight countries,we buy one quarter of the fine merino wool produced in New Zealand, we exportour clothing to thirty countries, and we have millions of customers around theworld. I’ve pledged that over the next fifteen years we will achieveextraordinary things and help reshape the face of business in the process.For me, leadership started off as passion for an idea. Now it’s about inspiringothers to unlock their potential. I’m proud to say that the key people who builtIcebreaker with me in those early days are still critical parts of the business.Another 250 employees have joined them. It’s this team, along with oursuppliers, customers, and our core values, that will determine what Icebreakerwill become in the future.JEREMY MOON AND L-E-A-D-E-R-SAfter recounting his journey with Icebreaker, Jeremy analyzed his experience ofbeing a leader using the acronym L-E-A-D-E-R-S. His response was detailed andinspiring at the same time.Look and listen: At the outset I asked myself two essential questions: whomshould we listen to, and why? The product didn’t exist yet, so I had to listento what was happening around me. Icebreaker’s customers wanted a product thatwas real and authentic. They told us they wanted clothing that was highperformance and built to last, that would help them reconnect to nature.I discovered our customers liked sharing their knowledge with a young person whowas hungry to learn. My first customer told me that I was a good listener. Beinga good listener was a win/win situation, and a great way to build arelationship.I also listened to Icebreaker’s board of directors, which meets for half a dayonce a month. They asked the big questions: What will Icebreaker look like inthree years’ time? Are we investing enough in the future? What is the internalhealth of the organization? What strategic issues need to be addressed? When Iwas deep in the trenches of the day-to-day detail of running a business, thosequestions made me focus on the bigger picture. For me, leadership has alwaysbeen about asking the right questions to trigger the next evolution.The volume of questions slowed down as the picture became clearer and Ideveloped my ability to lead others, but it’s still crucial to ask sharper,deeper questions. What is really important? How can a business contribute tosociety? How can an organization be a vehicle of consciousness? The evolvingjourney never ends; therefore you can never stop looking and listening.Emotional Bonding: The world has gotten faster, and there are many moretechnologies, but business hasn’t really changed that much. It’s all aboutrelationships. Icebreaker’s relationships are with suppliers, retailers, andcustomers. We don’t advertise, and yet we’ve managed to build a good-sizedbusiness based just on positive word of mouth.We depend upon building an emotional bond. One way was by setting up Baacode, aprogram that lets customers trace the fiber in their garment all the way back tothe sheep station where it was grown. Because it’s transparent, Baacode allowsus to set standards through the supply chain on quality, environmentalstewardship, and the treatment of animals and people.Our internal relationships are also very important to me. Icebreaker’s firstemployees were friends, people I got on well with already. We were all a bitcrazy and shared a sense of adventure. I became very conscious of the impacteach new person had on the team. New people had to be able to get on with theexisting group. We didn’t want everyone to be the same, but we wanted a realsynergy between people.We have an incredibly vibrant and fun culture at Icebreaker. It’s very creative;there’s a strong sense of spirit and purpose. My job is to ensure that wetreasure this culture and never take it for granted. It’s going to get harder aswe grow over time to become a billion-dollar company, but I know it can be done.When I reflect on the role of leadership in emotional bonding, it comes back toone central idea: how can others be allowed to contribute? People give theirfull commitment to a business only when they feel they’re genuinely a part ofit.Awareness: Leadership requires you to be conscious of your impact on otherpeople. In a great book he coauthored called The Leader’s Way, the Dalai Lamatalks about first finding the right view and then finding the right way. Anawareness of the right view is critical in business: it’s easy to look from oneangle, but you need almost a 360-degree view. And then the right way indicatesthe right thing to do, based on your values, your ethics, and the purpose of thebusiness. At Icebreaker, we have a process that helps us integrate ourperspective. When we’re creating new products or new systems, we seek out theviews of everyone who is affected. The best decisions we make have a completeview of what’s going on, and that reveals the right way.My biggest shift in awareness came when I started seeing Icebreaker as abusiness model. We call our model Ecosystem, because it balances ecology,economy, and resources. Our objective is profitable sustainability. When you aretruly aware, you see that the future has to be based on sustainable enterprises,which is what Icebreaker has been from the beginning.Doing: Dream and do: that’s the right order when it comes to action. It’s hardto have a meaningful life if we’re just doing. As for dreaming without doing, Idon’t know anyone who has become successful without purposeful hard work. It’sthe combination that inspires people and connects them with their dharma, theirpurpose. I dream of Icebreaker being the global leader in sustainability and thecleanest clothing company in the world. We can demonstrate that it’s possible tobuild a successful business while feeling proud of who you are, what you cancontribute, and what the business does.For me, a dream starts as a possibility. Slowly, the possibility grows and turnsinto a wave of energy—a feeling of being aligned with the purpose of my life.This takes practice and trust. My intuition hasn’t let me down yet. Thesuccessful people I know rely on their gut. They analyze the facts, but thenthey go deep into themselves and wait for the answers to emerge—maybe in themiddle of the night, maybe in the shower, maybe when they’re playing tennis ordrinking wine with friends. That’s why it’s so important to trust yourself torecognize the feeling deep inside before you leap into action. Doing is based onconsciousness.Empowerment: When you lead a business, empowerment is about allowing the peopleyou work with to find their own power. That’s spiritual power, creative power,judgment, mental power, and influence over others. Empowerment motivates othersto contribute. They feel valued and realize that they can make a difference. Iwant others to sense a rising power within themselves. If this power ispositive, they will stay loyal to you and the organization. If the power isnegative, or is motivated only by money, you will be traded in for a betteroffer.Early on, we got the culture right at Icebreaker, so everything has evolvedpositively. It’s a network of authentic relationships. Openness, directness, andhonesty create true empowerment within an organization, and then the businesswill go on to achieve great things. You also have to know when to give up power.To achieve Icebreaker’s long-term potential, I’ve had to shift the power baseaway from me to my management team. Seven years ago, when I was making thischange, I asked a management consultant how he thought I was doing as CEO. Hesaid, “You’re not a CEO. You tell people what to do, and you’ve got all theseone-to-one relationships. How can you create a network of relationships withinthe business so that other people can work out what to do for themselves?”That was a challenging thing for me to hear, but it was also a turning point.When I first started Icebreaker, I had to do everything myself. It was hard tolet go, and the business grew slowly as a result. It took us four years to getto five million dollars in revenues, and I was the constraining force. Two yearslater Icebreaker was taking in twenty million dollars. What happened in between?I learned how to delegate. I came to see my role as finding the right people andgiving them the power to take over the functions I used to think only I couldhandle. Five years later the business hit over one hundred million dollars, andit’s been growing strongly ever since.Empowering others is a way of saying you trust their judgment and their abilityto perform. You are giving them the space to express themselves. Icebreaker isall about our people. As its leader I can’t let that slip away. Products comeand go, but our company culture must remain strong, healthy, open, honest andenergetic if we are going to succeed in the long term.Responsibility: I used to think that responsibility was a burden. Now I knowit’s the freedom to choose. When you’re running a business, you’re makingdecisions about how to grow that business ethically. That means entering intothe unknown, which always carries a degree of risk. There are two types of risk:responsible risk and reckless risk. I’m an entrepreneur. I’ve always had a senseof adventure. People think I’m a risk taker, but I’m not. The risks I take withIcebreaker have been calculated ones. I’ve made an assessment, taken the rightview, and then acted, knowing that the risks were responsible. For a leader, nottaking any risks is abdicating responsibility. But so is failing to let go andassigning others the power to take their own risks.For me, this has been a maturing process. I take responsibility for our productsand our brand, and for making sure we’re heading in the right direction. But thebusiness isn’t everything. People look and listen to the CEO, so I need to beconscious of my behavior and how it affects others. With that in mind, I takeresponsibility for my well-being. I have to find the right balance between work,love, and play. If all of us can keep these three areas evolving continually,we’ll be leading a rich, harmonious life.Synchronicity: Entrepreneurs often talk about synchronicity. We share a sense ofbeing in the right place at the right time, but it’s more than that. Along theway we’ve found ourselves looking for something, frustrated by a problem wecan’t solve, and then a solution suddenly dawns. A chance meeting introduced meto merino wool. That meeting enabled me to connect internationally and to livethe kind of life I want to live. A chance meeting, the intention to dosomething, or the desire to solve a problem—the mysterious way thatsynchronicity weaves our lives into a pattern is a common theme for people whofind a way to be in control of their own destiny.I feel most “in the zone” when synchronicity is linked with inner purpose: myability to create intensifies, and so does my ability to inspire others. I’m notalways there, but when I am, it feels great. The secret is not to hold on toohard or get too attached to the outcome. Being open to new possibilities makesus feel alive. When we are in touch with our creativity, it’s important tolisten to how that feels. I believe that synchronicity is generated from thatplace. Be open to it. Don’t be afraid to declare what your soul desires. Attachyour intention to it, and be willing to see where it leads. Unless you areconnected to a sense of meaning that is totally personal to you, synchronicitycan’t be really effective. Our ability to engage with our deepest meaning is atthe heart of our ability to inspire and lead others. And it’s the very core ofleadership.When I was studying marketing at the university, I heard about a philosophy thatchanged my life: “To get what you want in business, you need to give others whatthey want.” It’s a variation on the Golden Rule, an ethical code that can befound in many world cultures: “Treat others as you would have them treat you.”To follow this way of thinking, you have to ask yourself a question: what do Iwant? For me if it was only about the money, forget it. Greed would take over,and I’d be destined to fail. Instead, I wanted the challenge of creatingsomething bigger than myself, something others could contribute to.How can business be a force for good? We need to challenge the old-schoolmethodology of exploiting resources, the environment, and workers purely forprofit. Imagine a society where business leaders are known for their ability toinspire others and create great companies rather than solely for their abilityto make money. This is the type of society I want to live in, and this is thenew breed of leaders I can see emerging around the world."},{"pageContent":"NINERENATA M. BLACK,FOUNDING DIRECTOR OF SEVEN BAR FOUNDATIONOf the leaders who are changing the face of charitable aid around the world, oneof the most inspiring is Renata M. Black. She exudes youth and boundlessenthusiasm. As a teenager, Renata had an idea to help the poor, and step by stepshe has carried her dream to the point where she is having a global impact. Herfoundation translates profits into microloans, a revolutionary change from theold model of charity as a handout from the rich to the poor. The Seven BarFoundation, begun by her, is a social enterprise based on her simpleobservation: that luxury lingerie from Europe was an untapped niche market inthe United States. (She likes to say that Seven Bar uses sensuality andseduction to have a social impact.) Through retail outlets and fashion shows,lingerie stamped with the Seven Bar logo is using its success to providemicroloans to women around the world.The hard truth is that there are not enough donor funds in the world toalleviate every preventable problem. The obstacle isn’t lack of generosity. In2010 the United States will give $316 billion to charitable causes. But eventhis wholehearted generosity has a limit: as soon as you give to one hand thatreaches out for aid, another immediately replaces it. Renata asked abreakthrough question: “What if we could take a percentage of that $316 billionand invest it in nonprofit organizations becoming self-sustaining entities?” Toher, nonprofits need to work smarter and not harder. The state of the worldcannot be left to hope and the unpredictable generosity of donors.There were specific reasons why Seven Bar targets microloans to women. “I pickedwomen as my vehicle for transformative change,” says Renata, “because, to put itsimply, they are the root of a society from which all else grows. Children’seducation, the family environment, health care, population growth—these dependon women and the choices they make. I also feel that women, being nurturers, aremore likely than males to spend their profits on their children’s well-being.Therefore, when you invest in a woman, you help break the cycle of poverty forthe next generation.”Like others who lead from the soul, Renata saw a new trend in the collectiveconsciousness. More consumers are making choices based on their personal values.As she puts it, “Products are no longer objects of necessity—they have become anextension of what we believe in. Research shows that 89 percent of consumers arevery likely to switch from one brand to another if the second brand isassociated with a good cause. This is even more true of the next generation.”Like Jeremy Moon, Renata tells her own remarkable story best.YOU CAN SPEND years working to reach a defining moment, but there are alsomoments you don’t seek that suddenly decide how you are going to lead the restof your life. That’s what happened to me at fifteen. Nothing was more confusingfor me than being a teenager. After my parents died in an airplane crash when Iwas very small, I was adopted by an aunt and uncle in the United States, where Ispent my entire childhood. I never quite knew who I truly was, so I decided tomove back to my native Colombia to find my roots. There I could experience theculture, the people, and their passion for life. At fifteen one yearns for thatsense of belonging. At the same time I had an abrupt and life-changing encounterwith poverty. One day I took the bus to the wrong side of the mountain. I hadwitnessed poverty in the United States, but what I saw that day in Colombiaadded a completely new dimension to the experience.This wrong bus ride was my instant moment of realization: I could have wound upas one of those kids living in a cardboard box. Thousands of them weren’tfortunate enough to have the opportunity that had come my way. It was then thatmy purpose was forever defined. Some of my friends jokingly tell me I have anillness to be so completely obsessed by purpose. I see it a different way: I amfortunate to know exactly why I am on this planet. I feel a largerresponsibility that goes beyond one person’s purpose. I owe it to my deceasedparents to make their lives count. I owe it to my adopted parents for theirsacrifice in raising me, and above all I owe it to my people in Colombia, whoseexistence I can improve. As seen by the rest of the world, getting to live inthe United States is like arriving at the top of the mountain. I also see it asan obligation to use the kind of opportunity that Americans take for granted andextend it to parts of the world where there is so much unfulfilled potential.Before I could turn my teenage ideals into reality, I had to face how enormouspoverty is. What could one person possibly do? On the other hand, why wouldanyone else care about Colombia? I wanted to have a significant lasting impact,so I did what any normal kid would do to get answers. First I went to college.By the time I graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Ihad the right skill sets to be materially successful, but that wasn’t enough. Icouldn’t feel successful without giving my life significance. In my next phase Itraveled around the world, volunteering in different countries. In Hong Kong Iworked with terminally disabled children, in New Zealand with mentally disabledelders, and in India with victims of the tsunami of 2004 who needed to rebuildtheir villages.During this last project a desperate woman came up to me and said in Hindi, “Iknow you have money, but I don’t want it. Why don’t you teach me how to makemoney for myself?” A second defining moment had come to me that directed me onmy unfolding path. At the time I didn’t know how to teach her how to make money,but I set out to find a way.I had already observed the bad effects of aid sent in from the outside, whichserved only to make impoverished people more dependent, while doing little tomake them self-sufficient. (Over the past thirty years, the most aid-dependentcountries have exhibited an average annual growth rate of minus 0.2 percent.)The only way to break this cycle was to offer real opportunity. For example,microfinance involves giving a small loan as seed money to start or growpersonal businesses. It’s an exit strategy from poverty where the person whoreceives the loan makes the effort to succeed. Providing this kind of incentivehas the opposite effect from simply giving aid.As my life purpose unveiled itself, I became dedicated to building a socialenterprise that provides rungs of opportunity to the poor on a global scale. Iam now in the business of providing such ladders to underprivileged women viamicrofinance. I feel that social enterprises are the future of nonprofits. Asocial enterprise is different from charity in that it runs like a business andis not reliant on unpredictable generosity. By aligning causes with products, welead consumers to a feel-good buy. At the same time, we allow nonprofits to havea consistent revenue stream.Today Lingerie Miami, New York, Los Angeles, and fifteen other cities serve as ahigh-visibility platform for the Seven Bar Foundation brand. Lingerie Miami wasthe official launch of the Seven Bar Foundation brand in 2009, generating 170million media impressions, 120 articles worldwide, and an estimated $1.7 millionin advertising value. In other words, with one event we reached a critical massin consciousness.Lingerie New York 2010 will feature the first ever couture line by Atsuko Kudo,whose designs are worn by celebrities like Eva Mendes, Beyoncé, and Lady Gaga.To give buyers the opportunity to purchase products directly from the runway,the foundation is partnering with the latest in technology, Overlay TV. Videofrom the runway show will be streamed on the most highly visited fashion andmedia websites, where consumers can click, freeze-frame, and purchase productsfrom any aspect of the show.As part of our business model for social impact, we have the potential to sendour shows around the world, conveying to the next generation our message ofsustainable development. The success of the initial shows positioned Seven Barfor its first cause-marketing venture. We partnered with a cosmetics line,Fusion Brands, to do a “Kiss Away Poverty” campaign. A dollar from each salefrom their line of lip glosses goes directly to the foundation. In the firstthree months of the campaign over 100,000 lip glosses were sold, bringing in$100,000 for us. The rise in Fusion Brands’ sales has led the campaign to expandglobally, sporting the foundation’s image and logo on lip gloss packaging andadvertising.The shows are there to inspire people to take two completely opposing conceptslike microfinance and lingerie and unite them to become a transformationalforce. All “Lingerie” brand products and events carry the symbol of a ladder,representing a hand up instead of a handout. My goal is to use the appeal ofluxury lingerie to provide exit strategies for underprivileged women around theworld far beyond my lifetime. I believe that companies who choose to run theirbusiness as “profit with a purpose” will leave more than just products andservices behind. They will leave a legacy.RENATA M. BLACK AND L-E-A-D-E-R-SLook and Listen: For me, looking and listening is an aspect of receptivity. Oneof the assets that made me the person I am today is an ability to sense themoods of different people. Receptivity to mood allows you to quickly address orredirect energy according to a person’s state. This comes, I think, from acultural inheritance of mine, which involves showing tact while relying onintuition and awareness of others. Looking in a receptive way also revealed anuntapped niche in the fashion market. I tuned in to the trends of a population.Also, I felt that the face of microfinance needed to be more appealing.Visually, the design of the products we brand is seductive and sensual, so thecustomer sees something that stimulates the purchase and leaves a pleasingimpression about supporting a good cause.Emotional Bonding: Finding an emotional connection drives me every day, and onceI make one, I want to maintain it. Emotions are like flowers that need constantnurturing to grow and blossom. However, the way emotions are directed—positivelyor negatively—is what makes the world turn, markets move, people react, andneeds get fulfilled. My own feelings led me to where I am today. I began with asudden bond to the poor in Colombia. That bond led to the belief that I couldmake a difference, and belief led to opportunity.More and more I realize that we invest in people rather than ideas. Everytransaction is built on a feeling like trust, hope, exuberance, compassion, andgenerosity. My foundation is actually in the market of emotions, and it tradesin their value. It’s our customer’s empathy for underprivileged women that fuelsa purchase—along with a very different feeling, the sensual feeling of luxurylingerie. It takes the merging of these seemingly opposite feelings, one selfishand the other selfless, to create our brand.We are building customer loyalty through another emotional bond, whichstimulates a sense of power in the customer, the power that comes from knowingthat your purchase supports your values and a desire to make a difference in theworld. Doing good at the point of sale: I believe that this is the future ofcommerce and will lead to meaningful change on the planet.But the deepest emotions go far beyond this. In developing countries peopleliving in poverty lack funds but have very strong value systems. They are hugebelievers in God. In the field the loans lent to women create a bond of loyalty.It is their integrity that has produced a 98 percent repayment rate globally. Inour office, from the interns to the managers, a shared dedication and passion isour bond. Seven Bar is a daily choreography of emotions in support of oneguiding vision.Awareness: The key to my leadership role is being aware of myself, and of whereI come from. Of course, circumstances along the way have shaped me and helpedmanifest my destiny. None of that would have happened, however, without my beingkeenly aware that I could easily be among the 60 percent of the world’spopulation who subsist on less than two dollars a day.Another important aspect of my self-awareness is purpose. The trail to successis littered with frustration and setbacks, and you must make sacrifices all thetime on behalf of your mission. I’ve been fortunate in having a sense of purposesince I was very young, long before I founded the Seven Bar Foundation. Mypurpose had three parts: to live life at the fullest, to be the best I could be,and to leave the world a better place because I had lived in it. These threethings define my self-awareness and drive me every day.I also have to be aware of the situation around me and how it is changing. Aturning point came when I noticed that people were ready to take on morepurchasing power, not in terms of money but in terms of making a difference. Sotheir desire for more meaning matched my self-awareness, which has always beenbased on meaning. The two came together naturally, which is a crucial element inall success stories.Doing: I look back and realize that I am the quintessential doer. My innatehunger drives my action. It’s in my DNA to take initiative, finding undiscoveredpaths and innovative solutions. I live by the idea that you are the architect ofyour own life. The amount of time and dedication that are required to get to mygoal have never been an obstacle. However, I also realize that every path hasredirected me to other paths; at times mine has been a winding road.The path you walk is the one you have paved. Doing entails leading by example.If I am going to be fueling businesses by impoverished women so that they canbecome sustainable, mine must be a sustainable business, too. Finally, I havelearned to work smarter, not harder. This implies a level of awareness that mustexist before action is undertaken. As much as possible, I want my actions toseamlessly tie over to other goals. With this strategy in mind, my day isincredibly active but coherent and smooth at the same time.Empowerment: As you know by now, my goal is empowerment first and foremost. Ican trace this back to an early age, when the rules imposed by teachers andparents seemed impossible to challenge. As a result, I felt repressed for mostof my childhood, and I found relief by rebelling. I never thought of changingthe rules because that simply wasn’t an option—the social systems were set instone.I remember when I first saw the light through the cracks. I was volunteering fora nonprofit in India when I approached the head of the organization with an ideaabout microfinancing for women. I did a full-on presentation that lasted nearlythree hours, after which he patted me on the back and said, “Do it.” That was myfirst empowering moment. I was encouraged to make something happen. I was insuch utter shock that I exploded with passion and dedication like a pressurecooker! One never forgets what it feels like to own one’s own power, alife-changing feeling that I want to give women everywhere. On that day Irealized that I could be a force for change without boundaries.Responsibility: I’m very attracted to the notion that responsibility is theability to respond. Some people are born with this ability; others have itthrust upon them. I responded to my circumstance by creating a model forsustainable change. I am a great believer in responding to your circumstance ina meaningful way. So from a very young age I’ve carried with me a sense that Iam deeply responsible to my Colombian people, my deceased parents, and myadopted family.Everyone is born into what I call their original responsibility. Then, if youaccept a leadership role, you gain a new level of responsibility, this time toyour employees and to the trust being placed in you financially. The moreresponsible I am, the more phenomenal are the people surrounding me. I feelresponsible every day for leading them on the path of growth. Yet always thereis a responsibility to myself to make it count. If I were a sailboat, emotionalbonding would be my boat, empowerment would be my sail, and responsibility wouldbe my rudder.Synchronicity: I thrive on unknown possibilities. I live very much by the mottoof Buckminster Fuller: “If you want to change something, build a new model thatmakes the existing model obsolete.” As a pioneer, you experience a rollercoaster of emotions. For years you wake up every day obsessed by an idea thatmany do not understand. You look ahead and tell yourself, “This isn’t thestraightest way to get there. But is there a bend in the road for a reason?” Asyou tango with destiny to arrive at your goal, a sequence of almost magicalevents occurs. Then you sigh, “Okay, this is definitely the right path.”More and more awareness fine-tunes your efforts until you get to the ultimateawareness, which defines your ultimate success. My big lesson recently has been,“You can do anything but not everything.” I know I am great at certain parts ofmy business, but I fall short in others. My weaknesses were holding me back fromreaching my maximum potential.At the exact moment that I realized this, I came across an empowered woman whowould become my future partner. Kim Hoedeman and I exactly complement eachother. We both found ourselves at a crossroads. We wanted to be redefined, andby supporting each other, we have manifested our mutual destiny. Although wezoom through fifteen-hour workdays, we still pause and look back to thisintersection as the strongest synchronistic moment in each of our lives.Together we are an unbeatable force.Renata M. Black has become the unstoppable force she describes. Although shespeaks of having drive and dedication in her DNA, she also describes havingwalked a path. Every step of the path involved deeper awareness. She discoveredher life’s passion while discovering who she was. The two have merged, which isthe purpose of leading from the soul. As she says, awareness fine-tunes yourpath until you reach your ultimate goal.The critical moment was when I received permission from my superior in India to“do it.” This moment set the precedent for my life today. There werepossibilities within me that I would never have guessed in a million years. Thebeginning was barely a glimpse of light through the cracks of the system, butthe effect has been huge, and I intend to pass it on for the rest of my life."},{"pageContent":"PART THREETEN PRINCIPLES OF LEADERSHIP"},{"pageContent":"TENA TEMPLATE FOR AWARENESSI have done my best in these pages to make this book rich in meaning. As aresult, what is a slender volume is still packed with ideas, exercises, andsuggestions. It’s a lot to absorb. But the basic message is simple. We all havea still place inside us that is the source of everything that gives our livesmeaning. This is the soul, and it is the place great leaders turn to for theirinspiration, and for the answers to all their important questions.How will you know that you are drawing from the soul’s unique perspective? Wehave looked at a number of ways to know that you are being true to the highestcalling of spirit, so let me close this book by pulling together ten basicprinciples that function as a template for awareness, which is the wellspring ofthe universe. When you recognize these principles in action, you will know thatyou are truly on the soul’s path.1. Leaders and followers co-create each other. Followers express a need, and theleader supplies a response. Both arise together. When they don’t, there is aleadership vacuum; at such times, needs become more intense and eventuallydesperate, paving the way for exploitation and dictatorship.2. Just as individuals grow from the inside out, so do groups. The group’s needsmust be met wherever they are. Sometimes a group needs a parent or protector, atother times a motivator, healer, or spiritual guide. Needs fuel change. Theleader operates from the soul level to cause inner change, which then getsexpressed on the surface as success.3. The outcome of any situation is defined in advance by the vision that goesinto solving it. Therefore inner qualities determine results.4. The responses shared by leaders and followers are built into us, guiding usto evolve and progress. The soul is aware of how to unfold our evolution toproduce the highest and best outcome in any situation.5. Needs are designed to evolve, and a leader must be aware of this in order toforesee the future of the group and anticipate its needs. In rising order thegroup’s needs are for safety and security, achievement, cooperation,understanding, creativity, moral values, and spiritual fulfillment. All theseare inner and outer needs that have evolved over time in the life of everysociety.6. For every need, a leader must play the right role. The need for securitycalls for a protector; achievement calls for a motivator; cooperation calls fora team builder; understanding calls for a nurturer; creativity calls for aninnovator; moral values call for a transformer; spiritual fulfillment calls fora sage, or seer. This matchup is organic—the soul knows how to fulfill any needwith the least effort and struggle. A leader who can tap directly into thisknowledge gains tremendous power for good, far beyond that of someone whoconcentrates only on external goals and rewards.7. The leader who understands the hierarchy of needs and responses will succeed;the leader who aims only for external goals (money, victory, power) will falterin the area that counts most: guiding the evolution of his followers.8. By ascending the hierarchy of needs, any group can be made to feel inspiredand unified. Great leaders are in touch with every level of human experience.They understand that their followers yearn for freedom, love, and spiritualworth; therefore they are not afraid to hold out higher goals that lie beyondmere material rewards. But at the same time they don’t lead from themountaintop. Every leader is also everyman. A lower need like the need to feelsafe must be understood, genuinely felt, and then fully met before moving to ahigher need. The challenge at hand can be as seemingly small as a guideddiscussion in which people feel safe to express their innermost feelings or asprofound as leading a society out of oppression. The soul knows every level oflife; a great leader aspires to know the same.9. Leading from the soul means giving of yourself. It means you supply trust,stability, compassion, and hope. You spend time investing in relationships withthose who turn to you for answers. Unafraid of forming emotional bonds, youdon’t hide from any need as it unfolds. By contrast, leaders who are led astrayby the desire to protect themselves emotionally, who limit their responses, orwho cling to their egos, wind up being failures. They may have success inmaterial terms, but if they do, it will be devoid of inner worth.10. The soul brings order out of disorder. It brings creative leaps, unexpectedanswers, and synchronicities that are like gifts from the heart of mystery. Nomatter how complex and confusing a situation looks, leadership is possible whenyou are comfortable with uncertainty. Once they see the hidden spiritual orderthat lies beneath what seems to be chaos, inspired leaders thrive onuncertainty. You must learn how to manage the fact that situations are tangled,otherwise the group you lead will be crippled by turmoil. There is always ajumble of needs and responses that must be sorted out. Fear and survival,competition and creativity, beliefs and personalities make their demands. Theyeach have a voice, whether we hear them or not, but underneath the jumbledsurface there is only one voice, the silent whisper of spirit, which understandseverything.Think of these ten principles as a template for awareness. Ideally, you wouldapply it to everything you do. All models of leadership give much the samegeneral advice when it comes to managing tasks and motivating other people. Butthey leave out the most important thing: a basis in Being. Being is the groundof everything. It is pure awareness, the womb of creativity, the generator ofevolution. When the final story is told, leadership is the most crucial choiceone can make—the decision to be. Only someone who turns for wisdom to the silentdomain of the soul can thrive in the midst of chaos. Such a person will beremembered as a great leader. Yet being is everyone’s birthright; awareness isbuilt into our brains as well as our spirit. There is always a new phase ofevolution, and evolution is guided by need.The world’s wisdom traditions define truth as a single spark that burns down thewhole forest. If a leader is willing to be that spark, others will see the truthwithin him. Craving direction and the fulfillment of their needs, they willvalue what he offers, which is the first step toward valuing it in themselves.As a leader, you may find occasion to tell your followers why you wanted toraise them to a higher level, but in your heart you will know that you did itfor yourself. To walk your own path is enough."},{"pageContent":"ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThis book was inspired by a course I teach at the Kellogg Graduate School ofManagement, Northwestern University.
