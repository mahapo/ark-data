The secular has seizedthe advantage today, but for many centuries the power lay with spirituality.Visionaries could shape the future as much as kings, often more. A king wasanointed by God, but visionaries were visited by God. They heard his messagepersonally before appearing in public to announce what God wanted people to do.I became fascinated by the perplexing situation that visionaries find themselvesthrust into. Very few asked for this power to affect other people. God wrenchedthem from the comfort of everyday life and guided their steps. The voice theyheard in their heads wasn’t their own, but divinely inspired. What was thatlike? On one hand, it must have been terrifying. In a world that made aspectacle of feeding martyrs to lions, crucifying saints as enemies of thestate, and jealously guarding old religions, the voice of God could bepronouncing a death sentence. On the other hand, to experience the divine wasecstatic, as witnessed by the mystical poets in every culture who had a loveaffair with the divine. That mixture of rapture and torment became the seed ofthis book.“God” is an empty term except as it finds expression through the revelations ofall the saints, prophets, and mystics of history. They exist to plant the seedsof spirituality as direct experience rather than a matter of hope and faith. Yetno one can say that God was revealed in one consistent shape delivering oneconsistent message—quite the opposite. Somehow revelations can be divine andcontradictory at the same time.Why doesn’t God just say what’s on his (or her) mind and let it spread to everypeople? The contradiction in holy messages arose because of our own limitations.Let’s assume that God is infinite. Our minds are not equipped to perceive theinfinite. We perceive what we are prepared to see and know. Infinity revealsitself in bits and pieces tailored to each society, epoch, and habit of mind. Welabel as God mere glimpses of higher reality, like seeing one figure in DaVinci’s Last Supper. A glimpse fills us with wonder, but the whole thing hasbeen missed.With that in mind, I’ve turned this novel into a meditation about God in us.Only half is fictional, devoted to ten visionaries entranced by the words thatGod spoke to them. The other half consists of reflections on what God meant whenhe singled out these sages, seers, prophets, and poets. The message wasn’t thesame each time—Job in the Old Testament heard something very different from whatSt. Paul in the New Testament heard—yet one sees a pattern.God evolves. That’s why he keeps speaking and never grows silent. The very basicfact that God has shifted between “he,” “she,” “it,” and none of the above showshow changeable the divine presence is. But to say that God evolves implies thathe began in an immature state and then grew into fullness, when every faithholds that God is infinite to begin with. What actually evolved was humanunderstanding. For thousands of years, perhaps as far back as cave dwellers, thehuman mind held a capacity for higher reality. Sacred paintings and statues areas ancient as civilization, preceding written language and probably evenagriculture.Nearness to God is a constant, not just in human history, but in human nature.If we are connected to our souls, the connection is permanent, even if ourattention falters. We think that God changes, because our own perception waxesand wanes. The messages keep coming, though, and God keeps showing differentfaces. Sometimes the whole notion of the divine gets hidden, when secular forcessnatch the steering wheel and attempt to drive alone. But the force ofspirituality never fully surrenders. God stands for our need to know ourselves,and as awareness evolves, so does God. This journey never ends. At this momentsomewhere in the world a person is waking up in the middle of the night hearinga message that feels uncanny, as if arriving from another reality. Actually,there must be many such visitations every night, and the people who step forthto announce what they’ve heard form a motley crew of crazies, artists, avatars,rebels, and saints.I’ve always wanted to join this motley crew, and in the following pages I get toimagine that I belong with them. Don’t we all, at some level, want to join theoutsiders? Their stories tear at our hearts and uplift our souls. The lessonsthey learned took the human race down unknown roads. One could do worse than tojump the track of everyday life and follow them.Deepak ChopraApril 2012"},{"pageContent":"1 [toc01.xhtml#cha01]Job [toc01.xhtml#cha01]“I Am the Lord Thy God” [toc01.xhtml#cha01]“Where does the world end?” the father asked.His son, Job, wasn’t prepared for being questioned. It was spring. Outside theirtent the first warm breezes carried the pleasant noise of birds and friskylambs. The boy’s friends were kicking a leather ball across the fields.“I asked you a question.”Job pulled at his sandal straps and stared at the carpeted dirt floor. “Theworld ends at the city walls, where the demons are locked out.”This seemed reasonable to a ten-year-old. He had been warned about demons veryearly, and their names, such as Moloch and Astaroth, stuck in his mind. Clawsand fangs held a dread fascination. When the winter cold drove the shepherdsback inside the city gates, Job felt trapped, but he was forbidden to venturewhere he might inhale a demon as easily as a gnat.His father shook his head. “Try again. Where does the world end?”A big man, Job’s father loomed over him; he wore a menacing look, which was outof place in a weaver who was almost as easy with his children as a woman. Thistime, though, Job knew without thinking that the look was dangerous.“The world ends where Judea meets the land of war,” he replied. This had to beright. Their green valley, known as Uz, petered out into the brown scorchingdesert, like milk spilled from a jug that flows until the sand drinks it up. Thedifference was that the land of war drank blood.But his father still loomed. “One last time, boy. Where does the world end?”Now the boy was tongue-tied with bewilderment. He lowered his eyes. Suddenly, hewas struck a hard blow on the side of his head, hard enough to hurl him flat onthe ground, where he lay, very still. When he stopped seeing stars, Job staredat his father, who was bending over him, examining him the way you examine awounded goat for maggots.“The world ends here,” his father grunted. He suspended his brawny arm overJob’s face. “Don’t ever forget my fist.”Why was he acting this way? There was no chance that the boy would cry. The blowwas unfair. A pride known to small children rose in him. He had been insulted,and insults deserve contempt, not tears. But his father’s fist remainedclenched, and Job wouldn’t risk a second blow. He bit his lip and wore a maskuntil his father, having made the point, straightened up and strode out of thetent without another word.He had dropped something and left it behind. A scrap of cloth, fine white woolwith a purple stripe in it. Job only just noticed it when his mother camerushing in, wringing her hands, which were wet from the washtub. There was notime to tell her what had happened. There wasn’t time for a word, in fact,before her face crumpled and she let out a shriek. She grabbed up the scrap ofcloth and pressed it to her cheek.Job was stunned. His mother was a dignified woman, the kind who turned awayrather than be watched suckling a baby. Job had never seen her anything butfully dressed. Suddenly she tore at her black shift and almost ripped it awayfrom her breast. It took a moment before her strangled sobs formed into a wordthe boy could understand.“Rebekah!”His sister? Why would his mother call out her name? In his confusion, Job waslost until a fact dawned, a simple fact now full of terror. His older sisterwore a fine white undergarment. Purple dye from Tyre was expensive, but she wasbetrothed, and the groom’s mother had paid a visit. The two families werepleased with the match, and before she left, the groom’s mother presented Job’smother with a ball of purple yarn. This was immediately woven into the hem ofRebekah’s white skirt, so that when she walked, a flick of purple could be seenat her ankles.“She’s dead?” Job murmured, afraid to ask the question, but more afraid not toknow. His sister had torn the scrap from her clothing—or someone else had.His mother grabbed him to her breast and squeezed him tight. He squirmed,feeling the hot skin under her bodice. He could hardly breathe, but she wouldn’tlet go; the boy began to gasp.“Job!”His father’s voice shouted for him. At the same time the sound of women runningtoward the tent made his mother’s body slump. The running feet entered. Suddenlythe boy was drowned in wailing.His father shouted again, and Job broke free. Running outside, he looked overhis shoulder. In the darkness of the tent his mother was enfolded by a dozenhands clutching at her, like a baby being yanked by midwives into a terrifyingbirth. Job wanted to protect his mother. He would have run back to tear her fromthe clutching hands except that his father whirled him around.“You understand now?” his father demanded.How could he possibly understand? Seeing his bewildered eyes, his fathercrouched down.“God gave us this place and made it beautiful. But he didn’t blind the eyes ofstrangers. They are jealous. They snatch away what is beautiful, and they knowthat they are evil, so they hide in the night.”Now it was dawning. Roads carried travelers past their city. Sometimes thestrangers came in a trickle, as traders or pilgrims to Jerusalem. No, thepilgrims were not to be called strangers, only the others. But when the tricklebecame a torrent, armies tramped on the roads. The land of war was brought totheir doorstep.“A battle?” asked Job. He wasn’t afraid. In two years he would have to standready at the city walls, in case the invaders from Persia or beyond killed themen and older boys. He was already armed with an iron-tipped stick. In two yearshe might even be as tall as a spear.“Not a battle, my son. A raid, by cowards, by men worse than animals.”Whatever blow had fallen, it made his father suddenly weak-kneed, and as hereached to hold his boy’s shoulders straight, his own hands trembled. Hecouldn’t bear to let Job see his face creased with tears. The boy didn’t knowthat this was the reason his father stood up and ran away without a word. Onlyhe never forgot. The day his father struck him to the ground was the day hissister, Rebekah, died. Probably she had gone to the well with an empty jugbalanced on her head to fill. Probably she was smiling and then vaguelydisappointed when she found that no other women or girls were gathered there togossip. Were the dun-colored wrens who dipped in and out of the water singing,or did they know?Rebekah would have had a minute to guess why she found herself alone, would havethrown the jug to the ground and heard it shatter. In two or three steps, notenough to escape, the raiders would have been upon her. When the men of Uz wentoutside the walls later, to the spring that was circled with stones to make awell, they found drops of blood. The girl had struggled, and she had torn ascrap of cloth from her undergarment. It was white wool, woven by her father,but it could have been a note written in ink.Forget me. I am defiled. We are lost to one another. Forget me, my dear ones.The circle of wailing women didn’t leave her mother’s side. Job and his fatherslept outside the tent that night. The sky looked darker than the boy everremembered it. He didn’t remember falling asleep, but he woke up at dawn, seeinga shadowy figure emerge from the tent flap. Suddenly he had an image of hismother creeping away to drown herself in the well. It was a shallow well, but ifshe was determined and lay face down in it—“Boy, wake up.”Job opened his eyes and realized that he had been having a bad dream. His fathersat on the ground next to him; he handed his son a bowl of curds with grainmixed in. With a nod Job took it. He was sure when he had rolled up in asheepskin to go to sleep that he would never want to eat again, but now he wasravenous. He scooped up the food with his cupped fingers, watching to see whathis father would do next. A child, if well loved, will give a parent a secondchance, but Job felt the bruised spot on the side of his head where it had hitthe floor. He waited. At first his father sat motionless, as if deciding whatkind of man he would turn into that day. His silence began to make Job nervous,until a moment later when his father arose and walked around to the other sideof the tent, where his loom was set up. Then there was the familiar clackingsound of his work, a sound Job always found reassuring.When he had finished eating, the boy walked to where the loom stood; in springall the weavers worked out in the open if the weather was good. His father wasthe first one to start; the sun was still half sunk below the horizon. Jobwatched him without speaking. The rest of their lives would fall under theshadow of the raid. He didn’t know particulars. Would they hold funeral riteswithout a body? Would a party of men strap spears to their pack animals and tryto rescue her? For a long time his father threw the shuttle, saying nothing.“God blesses his people.”When the sentence came out, Job was startled. He wondered if grief had turnedhis father’s brain. The words were repeated, louder this time, as if his fatherwanted the surrounding tents to hear him.“God blesses his people. We bring misfortune on ourselves. No one is withoutsin.”His father addressed no one in particular except, perhaps, the sky. Now he gazedat Job, as if noticing him for the first time.“Do you understand?” he said.The boy shook his head. Until the day before, he had considered his fatherperfect. The boy never thought about God; he had no need. His own fatherprovided everything, knew everything. What was he saying, that he had caused thecrime against Rebekah? From deep inside, Job wanted to cry, “Stop it! You didn’tkill her.” But he couldn’t, because if he did, his father might strike himagain, and he didn’t know how hard the blow would be. There was another reasonnot to cry out. If his father wasn’t responsible for this cruel twist of fate,there was only one other to blame.In a dull voice his father said, “It’s all right. I don’t expect you tounderstand, but remember what I said to you this morning.” He turned back to hisweaving, and as his hands moved swiftly across the tautly stretched yarn, achange took place. His body relaxed; his face resumed the mild expression italways wore. Soon he whistled softly to himself, and you would not have known,unless you did know, that anything amiss had ever happened.“My father was content. Do you know how that could be? One of you speak up. Howcan a man contentedly work the day after his daughter is stolen from him?”Job was no longer a boy. He was a father himself now, with sons and daughters.The men around him remained quiet. A new baby had arrived. Job held him in hisarms while he recounted the tale of Rebekah’s disappearance. It was his customto do this every time his wife bore him a son. The men had gathered for thecircumcision rite, but the priest held the knife back while Job told his story.The men, who had heard it before, could have answered Job, but they tookpleasure in hearing him deliver the moral.“My father was content because he knew that God would reward the righteous andpunish the wicked. My sister was no exception. I pray she survived, but if not,God is lawful, always.”The men in the dark room with the shutters closed murmured their assent. “God islawful,” one repeated. Candles burned on the table where the newborn baby hadbeen laid. He kicked his feet randomly, but didn’t cry out. When the priest’sknife touched him, he made a queer sound of surprise and distress. It was morelike a small animal’s cry, like a herding dog having its tail docked, than ahuman cry. The sound was the signal for Job’s wife to rush in, swaddle the baby,whose face had turned bright red, and rush him away to be bathed and bandaged.The solemn atmosphere turned when they left. The priest was the first to raise acup of wine, and the men cheered, showering the new father with praise. But noone slapped him on the back. Job was not someone you took familiarities with.After the third cup the men knew without being told that they should leave. Whenthey got home, they would be pestered by their wives. Were the wall hangingssilk, the plates gold? How pretty were the servant girls? Don’t tell me Jobdidn’t look them over first. The rich are a law unto themselves.One guest was exhausted, having stayed up all night to attend a difficultcalving. He might have lost both mother and baby, but as it was, God willed thatthe calf was stillborn. So the man was angry as well as exhausted, and he couldhardly hold his wine at the best of times.“Your father had no right to strike you,” he said. “I’ve known some sons to runaway, or worse.” The drunken guest pushed his face right up to Job’s. The otherslooked on, startled and embarrassed.Job regarded him tolerantly. “What would another son have done?”“Don’t ask me. But he wouldn’t have cowered. If it was my father, he would havehidden the knives after that.”A sudden passion burned in the drunken guest’s face. Without warning he turnedand grabbed the priest’s knife, which lay on the table waiting to be cleaned andblessed for the next rite.“Hide your knives!” the drunk shouted. “Because I’m coming!”As quickly as it came on him the passion faded. The drunken guest blinked andlooked around in confusion, as if he had heard his words, but didn’t know whohad shouted them.“Pardon,” he mumbled. He dropped the knife, which clattered on the stone floor,and ran out without meeting anyone’s gaze. Nobody spoke, waiting for Job’sreaction. Not one of them owned what he owned, and most had borrowed money fromhis coffers, which always stood open.“Is he the only one?” Job murmured quietly.The men around him shuffled uncomfortably at this baffling question, but Jobanswered himself.“You all wonder, and so did I. My sister was gone, and my father chose that verymoment to strike me. I was young, but I knew about knives.” Job smiled, as ifrevisiting an old impulse that had not quite died with time. “Even young boyshelp slaughter spring lambs.”“Your father was your father. He could do what he liked,” said a close friendnamed Eliphaz.“And that would have been good enough for you, if you were in my place?” askedJob.“I was in your place. When my father was in a rage, he threw it in everydirection,” Eliphaz replied. More than a few heads nodded; there was a generalmurmur of agreement.“Was your father’s rage a kindness?” Job asked.Eliphaz hesitated and then smiled. “You’re full of mysteries today.”“So is the world, and so is God. But this is a mystery I solved,” said Job. Hedidn’t pause for a reaction. “What do we know about our Lord?” (There was nochance that Job would actually pronounce the name of God, which was forbidden.)“He told us himself. He is a jealous and angry God. Did not Moses receive thatteaching? We have the law, so we know how to please God. Even when he is angry,he is just.”Job had wound himself up and could have delivered a sermon, but suddenly hestopped. He looked blank, like a man lost in thought or hearing voices, youcouldn’t tell which.Quietly he continued, “To a boy, what is his father? God in the flesh. This isrighteous. It is the law that fathers rule as God, and my father wanted toprotect me. How far could his protection reach? Only as far as his arm. Beyondhis fist I would be at the end of the world. I would fall into the same dangerthat snatched away my sister. The blow my father struck was pure love. I hatedhim in my heart until God showed me this meaning. Now I only wish I could havereturned such love, the kind that is willing to be hated and yet cannot bestopped by hatred.”Some of his guests murmured at these words, deeply moved. But not all. Anotherfriend, Bildad, was skeptical. “What is your teaching, that God strikes us downout of love? If so, what does he do when he hates us? Surely he condemns thesinners and rewards the righteous.”Before Job could reply, another friend, Zophar, jumped in. “This was only achild’s lesson. When you were a boy, the world ended with your father’s fist.Now you know better. There is no world out of reach of God’s wrath.”Job looked at his friends soberly. All three were smiling. To be close to therich, you must learn subtlety, and the first lesson is a concealing smile. Thekind an assassin wears until he draws close enough to strike.“What do you think of me, my friends, that I have never known suffering?”“Money is like a feather bed, only softer,” said Bildad, a favorite saying ofhis.“This is a day of celebration. Let’s not break our heads arguing over God,”Zophar chimed in.Job nodded. “There is no point in such arguments. What we know about God, weknow. True?”He bowed his head. Was he praying or being modest or feeling defeated? The roomwas dim. No one could tell. They were grateful simply to escape. Each departingguest grasped Job’s hand warmly, but he never raised his face. Whatever he mightbe thinking, the voice in his head had run out of words. A field hand stood dripping with sweat, holding out two blackened heads ofbarley. They were blighted, and the first thing Job asked was how far the stickysmut had spread. The field hand shrugged.“Go ask my friends,” Job said. “Their crops are planted close to mine. Show themwhat you’ve shown me. It’s probably nothing, but ask if they are worried.”The field hand retreated with a bow. For some reason the two heads of blightedbarley made an image that stuck in Job’s mind. He wasn’t concerned for himself.He owned the richest fields in the valley, and he always had a season’s harveststored in his granary. His neighbors were not so blessed; they lived from cropto crop. An hour later the field hand rushed back, shaking his head.“Your friends, their grain is clean,” he said, but he didn’t look like a mandelivering good news. He held a bulging sack close to his belly. With a gesturehe let go. Out of the sack spilled a hundred heads of barley, all smutty andwithered. They lay at Job’s feet like charred caterpillars. His brow furrowed.“Why didn’t you bring this many before?” he asked.“I brought all there was. This just happened. Whatever this is, it’s movingfast.” The field hand backed away a step, as if the grain really wasplague-ridden.Job was a mild man, as his father had been, but he shot the field hand a sharplook and ordered him to keep watch over the barley crop that night. He was tobring any news in the morning. But the blight moved with alarming speed. Therewas news before nightfall—one of Job’s largest fields had turned to blackenedstalks. Some invisible fire had killed his crop, and yet it stopped, as if bycommand, exactly where Job’s land met his neighbor’s. The people began tomutter. In their minds there was a fine line between ill fortune and beingcursed. When the sun rose the next morning, the invisible fire had spread to twoother fields, the best that Job farmed. The tips of the grain were charredalready. The next field over, owned by his friend Eliphaz, stood untouched. Theline between ill fortune and being cursed was crossed.Job went to his wife, who was being dressed by a servant girl. “Leave off yourjewelry, and if you go out, cover your head,” he said. She looked at him,puzzled, and waved the girl away.When they were alone his wife said, “Why do you ask this? Do you suspect me ofsomething? I’m completely innocent.”Another husband would have wondered why such a thought leapt into her mind, buthe was trusting. “My dear, there’s something bad in the fields. God seeseverything. If he is angry, let’s show that we’re not proud.” Pride was theeasiest sin for a rich man to fall into; Job had always kept that in mind. Hedidn’t feel that he had sinned, but God looks into the deepest recesses of theheart. Being doubly careful, Job had even sanctified his sons’ houses withofferings, just in case they had harbored evil thoughts.Later that day Job wrapped himself in sackcloth and appeared at Eliphaz’s door.“You’ve heard?” he said.“That your crops are wiped out? Everyone’s heard.” Eliphaz wore a grim look andinvited Job to step over his threshold. Was there a slight hesitancy on hispart? Job didn’t notice; he was anxious for his friend’s advice. He had doneeverything he could to appease the Lord. He hired priests to light their altarsand sacrifice a dozen of Job’s newborn animals. He ordered his sons anddaughters to follow their father’s example and wear rough sackcloth; the womenwalked to market with a streak of gray ash on their foreheads as a sign ofatonement.Eliphaz disagreed with this gesture. “You’re advertising that you’ve sinned.People will turn on you. I know them.”Job shook his head. “To walk this earth advertises that we have all sinned. Whatmatters is pleasing our Father.”Despite his penance, however, misfortune continued to rain down. Job’s flockstook sick and died. Overnight the grain he had stored up in his granary witheredaway. What could it mean? Behind his back not everyone was entirelygrief-stricken. Somehow they found the strength to survive a rich man’sdownfall. Eliphaz took Bildad aside. What was God saying to them?Bildad shrugged. “Who am I, Moses? God sent him to Pharaoh to say that Egyptwould be visited by ten plagues. I got no message.”Eliphaz twisted his mouth. “Only eight plagues to go.”His morbid joke didn’t reach Job’s ears. Envy and pity divided the people, butthey were all aghast as Job’s huge holdings of sheep and camels died. In thespace of a month his yoked oxen fell to their knees while plowing and never gotup again. A few surmised that demons were responsible, not the wrath of God,until the calamity of calamities befell. Job gathered his family together at hiseldest son’s house to pray for an answer. They knelt together, but when thefirst syllable of their prayer was uttered, the house collapsed around them, andall were killed except Job and his wife. Now pity turned to terror. Plagues hada nasty habit of spreading. Maybe curses did too.“We are alone and forsaken,” Job’s wife wailed.He didn’t reply, but took himself into the desert where he sat naked in the sun,pouring ashes over his head. The next day his closest friends came from the cityto console him, although cynics told it differently. Job was no longer rich.With everything gone, he was in fact wretchedly poor. He had become a strangeramong the righteous. There was no obligation to a stranger, was there?The three friends were horrified by what they saw, although it was the terriblesmell that reached them first. Overnight Job had become covered in weepingsores. He sat hunched over in the barren desert, scraping ashes and pus from hisskin with a shard of pottery from the smashed water jug by his side. If theyhadn’t been courageous and loyal, his dear friends would have fled such amonstrous sight.They knelt in a circle around Job, extending their hands (being careful not totouch his skin) and imploring, “Let us take you home. You can’t perish out herelike this.”Job said nothing. The sight of sores bursting as he scraped was nauseating.Eliphaz glanced at the other two. Would God punish them if they let Job diealone after seeing his distress?Suddenly Job spoke. His voice was a croak rising from his parched throat. “I amblameless and upright. If you believe in your hearts that I have sinned, runaway. If you stay, you’ll defile yourself.”“We are your friends. What should we believe?” asked Zophar.“That I walk the path of righteousness.”“I’m certain of that,” said Bildad, “but forgive me. Isn’t our God a just God?”Job raised his head and looked at his friend with pain in his eyes. “God bringsall things. He brings good and evil.”Perhaps this made Job’s friends afraid, because they started to weep and tear attheir clothes; they threw dust on their heads as if grieving for the dead. Theyprayed for God to release Job, and yet the next day the friends returned withJob’s wife. She almost fainted when she set eyes on her husband.“Tell him,” Eliphaz said.“I can’t weep forever,” Job’s wife said. “Be done with it. Curse God and die.”Job knew where her words came from. She wanted to be free to remarry a man whowasn’t hated by God.“I should curse you instead, for being so foolish,” Job replied, and his wifedeparted.His friends stayed behind, keeping watch. The sun rose and fell over the desert.They put up a tent to protect themselves from the elements and had water broughtfrom the city well. Job sat in the sun, hardly moving. His bones poked outbeneath his peeling flesh, but he didn’t die. Only, he started to speak andwouldn’t stop. He cursed the day he was born. He cursed all joy from this worldand called upon those who could summon dreadful monsters. He cursed the happynews that a woman would bear a son. His cursing was endless; it frayed hisfriends’ nerves, and they came out to reason with him.At that moment he was cursing the stars to return to darkness, but he pausedwhen they approached.Eliphaz spoke first. “I mean no offense, but your groans pour out like water.Where is the man who taught us so much, whose strength held us up? You shouldshow more patience. A few nights ago I shivered in my sleep, and my hair stoodon end. A spirit passed over me and whispered in my ear, ‘Who can be blamelessbefore God? The Lord doesn’t trust even those who are nearest to him. Were notthe angels cursed by God when they disobeyed? How much worse are men who plowthe earth and sow it with iniquity’.”Job hoarsely whispered, “So what would you have me do, friend?”“Make your peace with God. He performs all wonders. He brings rain to thefields. He causes sickness, but has a healing hand. Repent and accept yourdestruction in peace. You will be taken away, at one with the stones of theearth and the beasts of the field,” said Eliphaz.Job’s voice rose to a wail. “If only you could see how heavy my calamity weighs.I am rash because the arrows of the Almighty are in me. But believe me, I wouldrejoice in endless pain if only God would release me. I’m not made of stone orbronze. Don’t counsel patience. My strength is gone. I cry out like a woundedanimal.”He turned a burning gaze on Eliphaz. “Hear me. A friend who withholds kindnesshas betrayed God.”But I’m not the one he cursed, am I? Eliphaz thought to himself, keeping quiet.The others were shocked, and they became restless.Job held them with his accusing eyes. “Can one of you tell me where I’ve sinned?Have I spoken anything but the truth?”When he was rich, Job had never been embarrassed to fall to his knees in themiddle of the marketplace to pray. He looked up at the sky now.“God, watcher of men. What have I done to you? Why do you take such care of yourchildren and yet make the night so long and dark? Without you a man will notawake with the dawn. Show me my sin.”Bildad spoke up, more impudently than the first friend. “This wind from yourmouth, how long is it going to blow? God doesn’t pervert justice. You said so,more often than anyone wants to count. Now you forget everything our fatherstaught us. If you are upright and righteous, as we took you to be, your dayswill end in greatness. I see it now. Your mouth will be filled with laughter;your enemies will walk in shame. That’s what you’d tell me if I were in yourplace.”These stinging words had their effect. Job’s reply was muted. “Do you think I’mat war with God’s judgment? He is wise; he knows all. If I argued against him, Imight make one point when he makes a thousand.”Just as bitterly as he had cursed creation, Job lifted his face to praise it.“God moves mountains when no one sees it. He spreads out the heavens and makesthe earth tremble. When he commands the sun, it must obey. He can hide the starsfrom sight and trample the waves of the sea. He performs marvels without number;he does great things beyond understanding.” A pause. “God brings calamity toeveryone. He destroys the blameless and the sinner alike. Is he mocking us? I amblameless, but I don’t ask for myself. I loathe my life. I only want tounderstand this one thing.”“Then let me help you,” said Zophar, the last friend. “You babble on as if wordscan save you. You say that you’re pure and clean in God’s eyes. But look at you.You writhe in filth. So you beseech God to tell you his innermost secrets, toopen up the truth about your calamities. It’s ridiculous. You can’t fathom hiswisdom, which is without limits. He passes by and knows the worthless man.”A smile came to Zophar’s lips. “I don’t care if you cringe at my words. I said Icould help you. Put away your iniquity, however deep it is hidden. Stretch yourhands out to God. Once he touches you, you will forget your misery. It willvanish like water dried up by the sun.”Job’s reply was even more bitter than before. “In someone who enjoys his easethere is contempt for the misfortune of another. I see that I’m a laughingstockto my friends. But I’m not beneath you. Robbers sleep soundly at night in theircaves, even as they provoke God. He turns judges into fools. He makes nationsgreat and then smashes them into dust. How have you helped me understand any ofthis? Birds and beasts are born with the wisdom you think you are teaching. Allcreatures know that God made them and has power over them. My eye has seen allthis, and I understand, better than you three. Man who is born of woman is givenonly a few days, and they are full of trouble.”To which Eliphaz replied coolly, “If you understand so much, then you alreadyknow why you are lost to the Lord.”“Don’t ask us,” added Bildad.Or drag us down with you, thought Zophar, but he didn’t speak, since he was themost superstitious and feared that Job might, somehow, rise again.The group around Job thought that they were alone, but a voice behind them said,“You are all wrong.”Heads turned. No one had noticed an insignificant boy, brought along to carrythe water jugs. During their discussion he had sat cross-legged a few yardsaway, waiting in case one of the friends signaled that he was thirsty. The boy,who was no more than sixteen, stood up.“I’m young, and out of respect I would never speak up,” he said.“Then hold your tongue,” Eliphaz snapped. “Who are you?”“My name is Elihu, and I have no right to interfere. I know that you will sendme to be whipped when we get home. But the Lord can speak through dumb animals,can’t he?”“Apparently,” snapped Zophar.Elihu ignored him. “He speaks through anyone who is touched by the spirit. So Ibow to all of you, but I say you are wrong.”The youth gestured at Job’s friends. “First, you three. You are wrong becauseyou blame Job, and yet when he challenged you to find fault with him, youcouldn’t. That didn’t stop you from judging him anyway. You see sin in his heartbut none in your own, which makes you hypocrites.”The friends would have drawn their weapons and leapt upon the boy, but his voicesounded eerie, as if it didn’t belong to him. They didn’t want to stab him andrelease a demon, not when they were alone and defenseless in the desert.Elihu turned to Job. “And you, you protest that you are blameless. You haveobeyed the law and made burnt offerings to cleanse yourself and your sons. Buteven a blameless man doesn’t dare to question God. The Lord has no need tojustify his ways to men. He created us; we are his. The Lord’s gaze extends tothe end of eternity. He sees into you as you cannot see into yourself. In yourarrogance you would hold God to your petty conception of good and evil, as if heis bound by his own laws. Yet there is only one thing you can know, as he hastold us out of his own mouth: ‘I am the Lord thy God.’ There is no answer tothat, and no question either.”Job’s friends were shaken, not just by the rebuke they had received, but by thechange in Job, who had stopped trembling. His stooped body was beginning tostraighten. Tears flowed down his cheeks, and where a tear touched one of hisseeping wounds, the pus turned to clear liquid.While the trance was on Elihu—for it was clear that this simple youth, hardlybetter than a slave, was filled with the holy spirit—he began to unfold astrange tale. He could see into the next world, and he beheld God hurling intohell the disobedient angels. But even as they fell, God kept close beside him acounsel of evil. This Adversary, or Satan as he was named, spoke only evil, andtherefore he had a kind of twisted wisdom about humans. He whispered theirmisdeeds and sins in God’s ear. The transgressions of men were so numerous thatthe Adversary began to boast that he was the true ruler of the world.God grew impatient and said, “Go and seek out my servant Job. He is upright andblameless. As long as there is one such as him, you will never prevail.”Satan gave a knowing smile. “There is no one who is perfectly devoted to you, orthey would not have been born of woman,” he said.Then Satan flew over the face of the earth until he found Job, and just the actof setting eyes on him caused his crops to wither. The Adversary returned toheaven.“Let me test this Job,” he said.A kind of wager was struck. God gave Satan a free hand to bring any calamityupon Job and inflict any pain, with one exception. He could not cause Job todie. God said, “The son of man might curse the day he was born, but he willnever curse me.”“And so it befell you,” murmured Elihu. “Your afflictions have been a test, nota sign of wickedness.”At that instant he blinked twice and looked around in confusion. The holy spirithad left him as suddenly as it had taken him. Job said nothing, but staredstraight ahead. His breathing was steady now, and it seemed from his bewilderedstare as if he were waking up from a dream. The three friends scrambled to theirfeet and scattered, resentful and bewildered. As much as they had accused him,one truth was undeniable. In all the words that had poured from Job’s mouth, hehad never once cursed God.“I have not sinned,” he murmured, turning his eyes on Elihu. “I had onlyforgotten.”“Forgotten what?” asked the youth, grateful not to be beaten. Returning tohimself, he barely knew what he had been saying.“I had forgotten the most important thing. God blesses his people.”The words were hard to make out, because Job had started to weep uncontrollably.His father had trusted the Lord more than he ever had. Then Job knew thatSatan’s greatest power was not that he could inflict evil. His greatest powerwas to make the sons of God forget who they were.Afterward Job returned home, taking Elihu as his personal servant, and what hadbeen blighted turned into a miracle. Job’s wife bore him more sons anddaughters. His gold was restored, his granary filled to overflowing. Yet as hebecame richer, Job became more reclusive. He rarely left his house, and when hedid, he wore a prayer shawl and kept his face to the ground. People began to usehim as a kind of walking moral: never question God, or you will be made toanswer. Others took the opposite moral: keep faith with God, and he will rewardyou with glory and splendor.What no one guessed was that Job had become a seeker. He had once believed inthe wisdom passed down from Moses and the fathers. Now he believed in nothingand everything. The Lord had stopped his mouth, the better that he could openhis eyes. What did Job see? A mystery. Something that flew before the wind andanswered every question with an echo.Revealing the VisionIn the evolution of God, the beginnings are ancestral. That’s not the same asprimitive. God is already advanced by the time we encounter Job, because everyaspect of life in ancient Israel was centered on God. As long as there are laws,customs, and a shared identity, which are complicated things, God will be justas complicated.The book of Job dramatizes God’s voice with great intensity and high drama. Itisn’t a story you can read and walk away from. To use a modern phrase, the storyis about bad things happening to good people. The virtuous Job suffers on amythic scale, like Prometheus chained to a rock while an eagle plucks at hisinnards, but he also suffers in a very human way. The calamities arebreathtaking and swift. Job’s crops wither. His granaries become infested. Hiswife despairs as their precious sons die, Job contracts a grotesque disease, andhis friends run away from the sight of him. If these afflictions visited amodern person, he would cry out, in the middle of the night, “Why me?” Job isabout the human yearning to know why.As we suffer alongside Job, we question alongside him. Even the oldest recordsgive evidence that God was doubted. Various answers come from three friends,speaking one after another in ritualistic fashion. One answer: Job, you aren’tas good as you pretend. You may have hidden your sins from the world, but youcouldn’t hide them from God, and now he’s punishing you for it. Another answer:Job, you’re good, but you’re too proud. You think you have total control overyour life, but now God is showing you that disaster can strike anywhere,anytime. Explaining why we suffer is a thread that runs throughout the HebrewBible, and it’s why I couldn’t begin with a prettier story about some loving Godwho smiles down upon our lives.Whoever wrote the Hebrew Bible spent precious few pages on Eden. Paradise waslost almost before the paint dried. There is a beautiful passage about Godwalking in the Garden in the cool of the evening. Later on in the Old Testamentlove reappears, but it is mainly the love between men and women, as in theluxurious eroticism of the Song of Solomon:The song of songs, which is Solomon’s.Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love is better than wine.Because of the savor of thy good ointments thy name is as ointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins love thee. (1:1–3)Almost every culture has stories of beautiful gods that romp through the worldas lovers, gleaming youths like Lord Krishna, who is amorous with hundreds ofshepherd girls, or the more lascivious Zeus, who seduces in the shape of a bull,a shower of gold, and many other guises. In the West, the story is bleaker andmore existential. Affliction and disaster are never far away, nor is God’s harshjudgment.Job’s friends are a mystical three in number, like the three Fates and the threewitches in Macbeth, because they speak from the unconscious. Or, to use anothermodern phrase, they speak from the shadow, the dark realm of the psyche wheresin and punishment, shame and guilt, fear and vengeance are secreted away.Sometimes the shadow erupts, and then any kind of misery can ensue. The writersof the book of Job, who seem to be various, lived hundreds of years beforeChrist. The exact time isn’t known, although scholars tend to agree that this isone of the latest books, perhaps the very last addition to the Hebrew Bible.Something very modern is going on, however, because life continues to erupt withinexplicable catastrophes, and guilt hovers even when events are external,random, and beyond our control.The human mind can tolerate anything but meaninglessness, and nowhere in Job’stale, whether we are listening to his perspective (“I’m innocent”) or hisfriends’ (“No, you’re not”), is affliction ever considered random: “This isabout you. Somehow you made these terrible things happen.”Human life is balanced between believing these words and not believing them. Ifyou believe them, you will be driven to uncover what you did that was wrong. Adesperate cancer patient who is haunted by the possibility that she “did this toherself” winds up in Job’s predicament. In later centuries, as God evolved inhuman awareness, an escape was offered from the torment of self-accusation. “Idid this to myself” or “God must hate me” leads to healing, forgiveness, andproof of God’s love.But no such escape exists for Job. God speaks in adamant, absolute terms: “I amthe Lord thy God.” Job’s virtue counts for nothing if God wills it so. Divinepunishment needs no reason. After the fall of Adam and Eve in the Garden ofEden, life was ordained to contain suffering. The Hebrew Bible ends with thesame fatalism with which it begins. In Genesis 3:14 Yahweh says:Cursed are you above all livestock and all wild animals!You will crawl on your belly and you will eat dust all the days of your life.Such a God wants to be feared. We deserve no better, and for the rest of the OldTestament the mixture of good and evil in human life is thoroughly examined,leaving out nothing: murder, rape, incest, greed, pillage, lust, jealousy, thecorruption of power. Ever and always, life is perilously close to falling apart.To keep the shadow in check, law enters the picture; rules organize every momentof existence, not just with Ten Commandments, but through the hundreds of dailyduties outlined in Leviticus. Virtue was a necessity if you wanted to keep awrathful God at bay.Until the book of Job. It dares to question this entire setup by veering intothe unthinkable: virtue is no protection at all. The tale is framed by a wagerbetween God and the Devil, in which the Devil boasts that he can lead any maninto renouncing God, and God accepts the wager by offering up the most virtuousperson on earth. In and of itself, this cruel game is enough to destroy faith.Why would anyone pray to a God who offers no protection, but instead throws youto the Devil on a whim? At the very least Satan is made God’s equal, since hehas more than even odds that Job will fail. Which means that religion itselfwould fail, and thus the covenant between God and humankind—a contractguaranteeing that virtue is rewarded—would be rendered null and void.Hindsight tells us this daring step was necessary. For God to evolve, hecouldn’t remain a punishing force to be continually feared, just as the psychecouldn’t be a sinkhole of remorseless guilt. The book of Job breaks the eggsbefore the omelet can be made, because it turns obedience on its head. Jobobeyed all of God’s laws, yet his life blows up as if a bomb went off underneathit.At a subtler level, Job’s story explores how the good things in life might beconnected to the bad things. One of the most profound truths in the world’sspiritual traditions holds that the good in life cannot be meaningful unless thebad is also. Both teach us who we are, and with complete knowledge we cantranscend the temptations of good and evil. The temptation of good is also knownas the path of pleasure. That is, a person tries to seek as much pleasure aspossible, since pleasure is good, while avoiding life’s pain, which is bad.The path of pleasure comes naturally, and yet the Old Testament is rife withdisapproval of pleasure. Its excesses lead to the corruptions of Sodom andGomorrah, the cities of the plain that were such dens of iniquity that God wipedthem off the face of the earth. King David is the closest we come in the Bibleto a hero, a poet, and an Adonis too, but he was fatally corrupted by pleasure,sending Bathsheba’s husband to death on the battlefield so that he could enjoyher.Dire warnings against the seduction of worldly pleasure are still with us, ofcourse, but they don’t amount to wisdom. The spiritual argument against the pathof pleasure is blunt and unswerving: life can never be total pleasure. Pain isalways mixed in, and if you want to solve the negative aspects oflife—everything that is shoved away to fester in the darkness of the shadow—youmust go beyond pleasure also.Job’s story doesn’t enter that territory, however. It focuses on the temptationsof Satan, who wants us to give in and let the worst side of human nature runfree. In Hebrew the name Satan means “the Adversary,” and in Job’s story thearguments mounted against virtue are adversarial. Being good gets you nowhere.Whatever you are rewarded with can be snatched away in the blink of an eye. Youcan try being good to please God, but he couldn’t care less. The world’s wisdomtraditions encompass the temptations of both good and evil in order to answerthe Adversary. And the answer is that adversaries no longer exist when goodstops warring against evil. The essence of God is eternal peace.Here I am looking down the road. The theme of self-awareness, which is aconnecting thread in the evolution of God, begins darkly, but lets in more lightas time passes. The experience of bliss can be the purest one of all andtherefore the closest to God. God hasn’t evolved this far in the book of Job. Heis recognizably a tough customer, watching and judging us all the time, prone tofickle whims and answerable to nobody except himself. At the very end aninnocent youth named Elihu suddenly appears to resolve the argument between Joband his three friends. We reach a very unconvincing denouement. Having posedquestions that threaten to sever the bond between the human and the divine, thestory cuts off the debate with pat answers. The three friends are nailed forbeing hypocrites. Job is nailed for pride, as if God has to answer to him.Elihu is basically returning the whole situation to square one: God does whatGod does, period. The framing device returns, as God speaks in his own voice toreassure us that Job passed the test. His virtue regains its rich rewards, witha bonus to compensate for all the trouble he went through. Satan is routed; thestatus quo is justified once more. In an age of faith, when the ultimate goalwas always to make God right, no matter how horrible his behavior, this endingwould have been more satisfying. To the child in all of us, there is afairy-tale quality about it, a reassurance that good always prevails in the endjust before we are tucked under our warm blankets to go to sleep.From a modern perspective, it’s much easier to skip the pat ending and read thebook of Job for its existential realism. In doing that, we turn the writers’original intent on its head. Instead of being about God’s authority, the storyteaches us that suffering is both random and universal. Chaos nibbles at theedges of everyday existence. The shadow can erupt at any moment, bringing untoldmisery. More devastating than all of this, God is dismantled through doubt. Whocan worship a deity of caprice? He’s the same as chaos and randomness, butwearing a human mask as our eternal Father.In reply, I would say, “There’s more to come. We’re not at the end yet.” Still,a willful, punishing deity hasn’t disappeared; every kind of God survivessomewhere, taking root in our psyche. Religious fundamentalism, whetherChristian, Islamic, or Hindu, depends on the same archaic elements, in whichfear and sin dominate. But infinity cannot be circled and fenced in. Countlessforms of the divine pour forth, and always will. Beyond the wrath of Yahweh,humans keep delving deeper to find the essence of love and to heal fear, whichrequires the clarity of self-knowledge.There is a positive lesson in the book of Job, a reason to move forward. Godchallenges Job by saying, “Where were you when I created the world?” He iscalling for surrender, and surrender is necessary on the path. The sin of prideis about the ego thinking that it has all the answers. Job learns that God isnot answerable. God isn’t a puzzle that can be cleverly figured out or asupersize human being sitting on a throne in the sky. Where God is, the egocannot be. Everything that Job loses—wealth, social status, possessions, and asecure family—are irrelevant to the soul’s journey. They are not wrong or bad,as we see when God restores them. By the end, Job sees that he is connected toGod in a pure way, without having to gain or lose.A long road unfolds beyond Job’s story. He is a station along the way, and everystation must be experienced before the traveler can move on. Otherwise, we arefated to repeat Job’s predicament rather than solve it."},{"pageContent":"2 [toc01.xhtml#cha02]Socrates [toc01.xhtml#cha02]“Know Thyself” [toc01.xhtml#cha02]“What if I killed a man, Socrates, right now? Just supposing.”“Even a barbarian like you has limits.”“You think I’m joking. But what would happen to me? Look around us. Nobody’swatching.”Two Athenians stood on the brow of a stony hill. Or should we call it a stonehill, because there were ten rocks for every stunted scrap of vegetation? Thetaller man, Alcibiades, was lean and restless. He shaded his eyes from thewithering noon glare.The shorter one, Socrates, crouched on his haunches to rest his legs. “You’vemade a mistake. Someone is always watching.”“Who, the gods? That’s a joke.”“I do what I can to amuse you,” said Socrates mildly.“No one as ugly as you could be amusing.” Alcibiades licked his dry lips andtook a swig from a waterskin. “I’m not being callous. You always taught me totell the truth, didn’t you?”The trek from Athens into the hills had been long. The two set out at dawn, butso far they had bagged only a rabbit, which Alcibiades had shot with his sling.He carried the flea-bitten desert rabbit in a bag flung over his shoulder.Socrates waved his hand when the waterskin was passed to him.“I worry about you,” he muttered.Socrates had a gnarled, sun-baked body with a flat, snub-nosed face, like thatof a satyr painted on the side of a vase. He was much older than his lean, tallfriend, who could have been his son. “Do you know why?” he asked.“Why what?”“I worry about you.”Alcibiades wasn’t listening. Down below, a trail wended its way through a narrowravine. The dirt track barely squeezed between high walls of nubbly limestoneworn into a cleft by an ancient stream that once flowed there. It didn’t flowanymore. Phoebus Apollo had drunk it dry, or if you traffic in impiety, the sunhad dried it up. When travelers wanted to pass through the cleft, theirshoulders touched the walls on either side.Alcibiades became animated. “If I was a bandit, that’s where I’d hide. Theperfect ambush.” He pointed to a narrow ledge where two men could lie in wait.It was visible from above, but hidden from the sight of unsuspecting traders andfarmers going to market down below.“You are a bandit,” said Socrates. “A proven stealer of hearts. You’reruthless.”Alcibiades smirked. “I have a right to my spoils. I’m a soldier for the state.Anyway, you’ve never given your heart to anyone, much less had it stolen. Youpretend to love, but it’s just a game.”“You play at your own game,” said Socrates. “You act like you’re immortal, andthat game is fatal.”They bantered easily and quietly, in such a way that you knew after a while theycouldn’t be father and son. The younger one was too casual in his insolence, theolder one too fond in his gruffness, the way that even a lenient father wouldn’tbe. Neither one had had a lenient father when they were boys, which may explainwhy they drew together. That or something more mysterious and probably unsavory.Malicious tongues in the city voiced their opinion on that score, but we willget to lechery later.Suddenly Alcibiades took a running start down the hill, as if he had spottedsome prey. “Forget all that. Follow me,” he shouted.The two men scrambled down the slope, heading for the narrow ledge. Alcibiadescouldn’t be argued out of it or distracted by banter. His blood was up. Theywould crouch in their hiding place as long as it took before a victim passedbeneath them. Then Alcibiades would pounce. At that moment and only then wouldSocrates know if his companion was in a sporting mood or meant to do violence.The going was steep and slippery. Dry twigs and scree scattered under theirsandals. Their faces were matted with dust and sweat. Alcibiades, a trainedrunner, didn’t look back to see if Socrates needed help. Wasn’t the old manfamous for his toughness? In his soldiering days, during the battle at Potidaeain the north, Socrates stood guard on a cold midnight wearing only a lightcloak, yet without a shiver. He was already almost forty. On campaigns whereevery free male was expected to carry a shield, it was reported that he couldstand in place all night, never once stamping his feet or rubbing his armsagainst the chill. Rabbits mistook him for a tree and nibbled the grass aroundhis feet.When he was younger and even more impudent, Alcibiades had asked him his secret.“Do you have thicker skin than the rest of us? Like a boar’s hide?”“I didn’t move because I was thinking,” Socrates replied.“I think too,” laughed the youth. “I think I’d be smart enough to keep warm.”“So I’m told. You mostly keep warm under a blanket with a girl whose name youonly learn in the morning.”Which was true. Athens was filled at night with the shrill sound of the aulos,the twin pipes that wandering girls played as they went through the streets,signaling that they were available. Alcibiades was known to open his father’sdoors and let an aulos girl come in from the cold. Socrates, who was notoriouslyvirtuous, regarded this behavior tolerantly.He had fallen in the habit of fondness early on. People whispered about the oldman and the headstrong boy, but Alcibiades was proud to be the prize that everyglance ran after. At banquets the guests lay on couches that held three bodiesside by side. Alcibiades mocked Socrates for always being in the middle, withthe handsomest youths on his left and right.“How can you blame me?” Socrates would protest mildly. “Isn’t one of them pushedoff the couch when you appear? Usually stinking drunk.”To have the gift of beauty is like being absurdly rich. You can afford to becareless about how you affect others. Alcibiades was careless about those wholoved him. He was careless in most things, actually, and reckless in the rest.The one exception, the thing he took seriously, was the army. When his cholericfather beat him with a stick, the boy bent his back, covering his head toprotect himself. He told himself that it was good training if he was evercaptured someday and tortured by Spartans. Hate, but keep silent. At fifteen, healready knew how.When they got to the shady ledge a veil of coolness fell over them. The narrowwaist of the ravine was just below them; the place was silent except for nestingwrens who fussed at the two intruders. A brown mother wren circled their heads,her wings clipping the air in sharp, swift bursts.“Feel,” said Socrates, who was the first to crouch down.Alcibiades touched the loose dirt around his feet. “It’s damp.” He pointed towhitened streaks on the rock face behind them where water trickled silently in apale glistening ribbon.Socrates shook his head. “Someone’s been here first.” His voice had turnedsober.“How do you know?” Alcibiades felt his ankle being grabbed by Socrates’s dartinghand.“Don’t move. You’ll crush it,” whispered Socrates.Did he mean a snake? Prized for healing, small snakes sought the cool at noon,especially in this place dripping with water. Socrates loosened his grip. It wastaking a moment for the younger man’s sight to clear after staring so long intothe sun. He glanced around.“What?”“This.”Socrates brushed his fingers over a sprig growing out of a crack in the ledge. Asacred myrtle, its leaves shiny and pale. One touch was enough to release itsluscious scent. Alcibiades had been close enough to girls who wore it; myrtlefragrance made you favored by Aphrodite. Alcibiades liked such girls, for morethan being sacred.“You said you could think,” Socrates grumbled, pulling him from his daydream.“Try, now.”At twenty-five, Alcibiades had grown past the age of being Socrates’s pupil, andthere had never been a real school, with a roof and wax writing tablets. But herecognized a schoolmaster’s barked command. Looking closer, however, he sawnothing out of the ordinary.Socrates was disappointed, but he didn’t say so. Love made him foolish. He wouldbe stung if Alcibiades grew cross with him, seriously angry rather than playingat it, and nothing riled the handsome soldier more than wounded vanity. In alevel voice Socrates explained. “Myrtle can’t grow in the shade. It would witherand die. Someone has made it grow in the dark.”“How?”“Magic. How else?”Alcibiades shrugged, and Socrates said, “How else? That’s a serious question. Ifyou don’t believe in magic, how did this sprig grow here? Perhaps the godswanted it to. If so, they may have left it for us as a sign.”“What kind of sign?”“An omen.”Socrates casually plucked the sprouting myrtle out by the root and tucked itbehind his ear. “Your charade is dangerous. Travelers are on the lookout forbandits. The tough ones fight back.”Alcibiades frowned. Like most soldiers, he kept his courage intact by imaginingthat he would never be hurt. “I don’t heed omens.”“Why? Because you’re never afraid? You should be. Life is a walk to the edge ofa cliff. Every day we get a step nearer, and what lies over the brink, no onecan tell.”This turn in the conversation was making Alcibiades irritated. He drew his knifeand began to sharpen it with scraping swipes against the stone wall. He might aswell gut and skin the rabbit while they waited, to make sure it didn’t spoil inthe heat.Socrates went on. “I was taught to read omens. I had the greatest teacher, backwhen I was so ignorant that I am still ashamed of it. But I don’t speak of her.”“Her?”“She was called Diotima, and if the gods didn’t leave this omen, she did.”Alcibiades couldn’t hide his amazement. “So you think this Diotima knew that Imight be hurt today?”“Or worse. Would you like to read omens? It’s not hard once you learn to see.”Alcibiades had forgotten the rabbit by now. He squinted his eyes narrowly. “Noone can understand you. Half the time you say the opposite of what you know isthe truth. You’re tricky, and you’re proud. But you pretend to be ordinary,” hesaid.“That’s because I am ordinary. I believe in the gods, like all ordinary people.”“See? That’s what I mean about saying the opposite of the truth.”If Alcibiades had forgotten about the ungutted animal in his sack, Socrateshadn’t. He pulled it out. In death the creature looked like a limp gray rag.“Is this the truth?” said Socrates. “Are we like rabbits? We bleed. We can bestruck down. So why not call us animals and kill us for sport?”“Because we’re human.”“What does that mean?”“I’m sure you’ll tell me.”The peculiar thing about Socrates was that banter always led this way, into deepwaters. “What makes us human,” he said, “is that we think about the gods andthey think about us. You laugh, but that is what Diotima taught me. The gods arehere.”“Right this minute?”“Yes.”“You’re right, you are ordinary,” Alcibiades mocked. “If the gods are here, Iwant to see Aphrodite’s breasts.”Socrates ignored his jibe. “What do you see when you look around? The world asit is. Rocks, a narrow trail, a dead rabbit. But such a world is withoutpurpose. Life and death dance with each other, gripped tightly together. Neitheris willing to let go, and so the dance never stops. Animals accept this reality.Humans fight against it.”“Am I allowed to say something?” asked Alcibiades. “Rocks are hard. The trail isdusty. The rabbit will never feed its tender young again. I’m glad I see theworld as it is, not as it should be.”“So you don’t mind being an animal?” asked Socrates.“Not if I’m the one that survives.”Socrates looked grave. ”The omen is darker than I told you. If I read it right,it says that you will die violently. Not today, but one day. Your widow willbend her face to the ground with tears, but half of Athens will rejoice that youare gone. “The contours of the young man’s face sagged. “Why are you saying such horriblethings to me? You should spare a friend, the way a doctor spares a patient whodoesn’t know he’s dying.”Socrates gave his young companion a sharp look. “We are all patients who want tobe told that we aren’t dying. The truth is different.”Their talk had been so intense that neither heard the sound of horses’ hoovesuntil it was directly below them. Suddenly the noise caught their attention.Alcibiades’s body tensed. Getting on hands and knees, he peered over the ledge.A rickety wagon was passing beneath, loaded with straw baskets. The air washeavy with the oily smell of olives. The wagon’s driver didn’t look up.“Here’s your sport. Go ahead, jump,” whispered Socrates in Alcibiades’s ear.“It’s just a boy.”“All the better. You’ll probably win.”Crouching there, they could see that the wagon driver was no more than twelve, afarm boy in a wide-brimmed straw hat. It was all he could do to handle the oldmare pulling the wagon, who was spooked by the narrow passage and the ringing ofher own hoofbeats. After a moment they were through the waist of the ravine andthe noise faded away.“I restrained myself,” said Alcibiades sourly. “The way you provoked me, I couldhave done something stupid just then.”“Really? Do you enjoy deluding yourself?” asked Socrates. “You’ve killedSpartans in battle, and one time you went mad. You let your hatred consume youand hacked off their limbs. In your bloodlust you condemned the enemy to go tothe afterlife defiled. Now their shades want revenge.”“To hell with your omens. I fought for Athens. I killed as an act of honor.”Alcibiades’s temper gave way to worry. “How will I know which shades toappease?” he asked.“Wait and ask them. They’ll be lined up after you die.”Alcibiades bit his lip as he shoved his knife back into the sheath he wore athis waist. He looked overhead, squinting. The sun was past the zenith, showinglike a brilliant bead against the rim of the rock slope. For today, the game wasspoiled. Socrates was already inching upslope, retracing the way they had come.Alcibiades grunted and tossed the dead rabbit into the ravine for spite beforefollowing. They arrived back in Athens after sunset. Socrates had started towhistle. Alcibiades remained downcast. It wasn’t dark, but the aulos girls werealready piping. The shrill sound scraped against his nerves, but it aroused himtoo. He licked his lips to say something when Socrates interrupted.“I could never teach you to read omens. You care too much about staying alive.I’m going home.”On the way back to town Alcibiades had felt his blood subside, but now it sprangup again, the way a dead-looking coal in the ashes, when poked, comes back tolife.“That’s right, go home. You probably still have enough teeth to eat yourdinner.” There was a mirror in his mind, in which Alcibiades could see howridiculous the squat old man looked beside his own dazzling Apollo-like figure.“Terrify me and then run away,” he muttered under his breath.Socrates peered over his shoulder. “Forget today. I will come back to you whenyou’re calm,” he said as the shadows swallowed him up. The next morning Socrates wandered through the agora, the town marketplace,pinching an apple at one stall, sniffing the freshly slaughtered lamb hanging atanother. He would talk to anyone, rich or poor. Nobody could predict what wouldcome out of his mouth, but a band of youths were in the habit of following him,including Alcibiades, the wildest of them. They were eager to see whose unwaryego he would puncture. If Socrates ran into somebody of importance, that persondid well to turn his back. It was dangerous even to say hello. Limping away froman argument, which always began as an innocent conversation, his opponentssmarted. They had been bitten by words like horseflies that could make the skinbleed.But none of them knew who Socrates really was. He often felt that he himselfbarely knew. He was forever watching himself from the inside, whereas everyoneelse only saw him from the outside, a strangely cheerful, curious, squat,penniless, henpecked curiosity. Some called this curiosity harmless, but otherskept a sharper eye out and considered him a threat.“You are a teacher of misery,” said Antiphon, a rival teacher, a few months ago,publicly accusing Socrates. “You set yourself up as wise, but look at you. Youdon’t work. God knows how you get any food. You wear the same cloak summer andwinter. I’ve never seen you in a new pair of sandals or a decent tunic.”Antiphon had cornered Socrates near a temple on the Acropolis, speaking in aloud voice to attract attention. A small crowd of townsfolk lingered, wonderinghow Socrates would reply.“Go on, Antiphon,” murmured Socrates. “You describe me very well. If I can’t beadmired, at least I can be noticed, and by someone as esteemed as you.”“Am I esteemed?” asked Antiphon suspiciously, cutting him off.“Of course. Ask anyone here. Ask yourself.”Some bystanders chuckled, but Antiphon refused to be distracted. He said, “Wheredoes your mockery lead, but to more misery? Your pupils have learned to sneer atconvention. They are lazy and impudent, and because they imitate their teacher,they will turn out just like you, mired in poverty. Do you deny that money makeslife easier? It is far better than starving. In the end your followers will wakeup to their miserable existence, but by then it will be too late.”“Well argued,” said Socrates, who never raised his voice. “But unfortunately,you have proved the opposite of the case you were trying to make. I would showyou, but since you claim to teach wisdom, I would be like a cobbler stealing ashoe from another cobbler. With one shoe each, neither of us would profit.”The tips of Antiphon’s ears turned scarlet. He was one of a new class ofwandering teachers known as Sophists, who did claim to teach wisdom, as Socratessaid. Athens was divided about believing this claim.“Not a cobbler, Socrates. You’re more like a crab,” Antiphon snapped. “A crabscuttles sideways to escape, just as you’re trying to do now.”Socrates shrugged. “I only wanted to protect your reputation, dear Antiphon, butyou are that strange thing, a defendant in court who insists upon being foundguilty after the jury has just pronounced him innocent.”“Show me my guilt,” said the Sophist aggressively.Socrates paused a moment. “First, you are guilty of bad faith. You have nointerest in what I teach. You’ve accosted me to make a public spectacle, in thehope that you can attract some of my pupils to yourself after they see mehumiliated.“Second, you are guilty of false reasoning. It’s true that I am poor, that myfood is meager, and I wear the same cloak every season. But I am happy, or atleast that is what everyone tells me. Where does my happiness come from? Notfrom pleasure, because by your own accusation I lack the money by which men runafter pleasure. Therefore, my pupils will see that money has nothing to do withhappiness. So which example should they follow? Yours, which dwells onsuperficialities, or mine, which may lead them to the secret source of thetruth?”Antiphon abruptly turned on his heels, followed by the crowd’s jeers. That was atypical encounter, of the kind that sharply divided Athens between champions ofSocrates and those who wished him harm. But on this particular day he came veryearly to the agora and talked to no one. He was troubled by what had happenedwith Alcibiades. Like a cat to milk, the handsome soldier would be back, but itwould turn out the same way it always did. He would be ashamed for his wildnessand his lack of self-control. He would even shed tears. Yet within a few days hewould go back to being Alcibiades.And the dark omen? Socrates genuinely believed that the gods had caused themyrtle sprig to appear, or else that Diotima had left it there. He put nothingpast her. Watching the farmers set up their stalls, Socrates saw her once againas he had first seen her twenty years ago, with a wild tangle of black hair andheavy eyebrows. She wore a ragged shift and no sandals. She looked like a childraised by wolves. Very little about Diotima was becoming, and this had appealedto Socrates, because very little about him was becoming either.He was a young man working the family trade. “Can you carve me a statue?” askedDiotima, blurting out the words without introducing herself. “Or are you astatue yourself? In which case I apologize for bothering you.”Socrates faced her, covered in white marble dust. He blended in with the stonehe cut. “I’m a mason, like my father,” he said. “But I carve statues too. Whatkind do you want?”“What kind do you make?” she asked.“Only what you see,” replied Socrates, turning away. He was surrounded by smallgods and goddesses to be sold in the shops all around the base of the Acropolis.“That’s a shame. I wanted the invisible kind,” said Diotima.“Invisible? They’re the easiest to make. You can do it yourself.”It was a hot day, and Socrates, bare-chested except for his thick leathermason’s apron, was ready to take a break in the shade. He threw down his chiseland wiped his brow with a rag.Diotima shook her head. “You’re wrong. Invisible statues are the hardest tomake,” she said.“And why is that?”Diotima took up a small statue, a crude image of Athena with helmet and shield,turning it in her hand. “The point of all these statues is to show the likenessof divinity,” she said. “Otherwise they would just be ordinary mortals. How canthe divine be carved? Divinity is invisible, so any true statue of the gods mustalso be invisible.”Socrates didn’t know how to respond. What the wild woman said made sense, andyet it confused him at the same time.“You look bewildered,” she remarked. “Good. There’s a chance I may outwit yourignorance.”Socrates had a rough scrap of bread, some salt, and olive oil, which he hadbrought for his lunch. He sat under a tree and broke the bread, offering toshare it with Diotima. Anyone could see that she hadn’t eaten recently.“Can you teach me to carve a god’s likeness, then?” Socrates asked, not that hetook her seriously, but his curiosity was aroused.“I’m not a carver,” said Diotima. “But I can teach you to see the invisible, andthen you can decide on your own what to do.” She looked at him out of deep,knowing eyes. “Beware, though. Once you see what I have to show you, you’llthrow away your chisels and hammers.”Socrates laughed. “Why?”“Because the outer form of the gods is worthless, once you’ve viewed theirreality.” Diotima gave a wry smile. “I really should warn your wife.”“So the wisdom you teach destroys marriages,” said Socrates. “Mine is hobbledalready. My wife and I are so lame that neither of us can make it out the doorto leave.” Socrates was a butt of jokes for marrying Xanthippe, a notoriousshrew.Diotima said, “Ah, you are clever, and ugly too. No wonder your wife complains.”Homely as she was, Diotima was a seducer of souls. They returned to thestonemason’s site, and as Socrates chipped away, she sat in the shade talking.Her hair never grew tame; she didn’t appear to have a change of clothes. Atfirst he felt sorry for her, but it was obvious that he couldn’t bring her home.The best he could do was to take two pieces of bread instead of one and tellXanthippe it must be rats stealing into the larder.A typical lesson from Diotima minced no words. “You are no more blind andignorant than other men,” she would begin. “You are ruled by appetite. You envythose who get more pleasure than you can get. But there are moments when youcatch yourself, and then you are ashamed of your lusts.”“Is that what puts me above my cat, shame? Then it must be better to be a cat,which doesn’t have enough imagination to inflict suffering on itself.”Diotima laughed briefly. “Don’t try and compete with me. Just listen. Ours isthe shame of a rational creature who can look at its own image and wish to bebetter.”“But drunks wake up with remorse in the morning and skulk back to the tavernswhen night falls.”So it went between them, the stonemason and the wandering lost woman. Each dayDiotima dropped another hint about the mystery that hid behind veils. Peopleeavesdropped on these lessons; people also gossiped. It was said by a neighborthat Xanthippe met Socrates at the door with a heavy stick—or anything that madea handy weapon—gripped in her fist. Yet for all the misery she inflicted,Socrates found himself growing happier, and at unpredictable moments he wasstrangely ecstatic.Even so, these moods came and went. He found it hard to let go of his fatalism.“When the gods gave us reason, they forgot to make us perfect. It’s all theirfault. A potter chooses to make the best pot he can, because everyone knows thata leaky pot is worthless. But every human has a leaky soul. I’ll rail at Zeusabout this when I run into him.”“Don’t play at blasphemy,” snapped Diotima. “It’s worse than turning into aSophist, if that’s possible.” This was one of the few times Socrates ever sawher genuinely angry.She cooled down as quickly as she had flared up, and a new humor overtookher—sorrow. “Most men are condemned, as you can see. But it’s a strange prisonthat holds them, because each inmate has been handed the key to his cell. We getthe key when we’re born, and we could escape anytime we chose.”“Then why don’t we?”“Because our jailer is the mind, and a fiercer one never existed. Even if thecell door were flung wide open tomorrow, the prisoner would consider it somekind of trick and remain slumped on the floor of his cell, bemoaning cruelfate.”Diotima gave a faint smile. After making provocative statements she always fellsilent, leaving the mystery hanging in midair. It was part of her seduction,because she knew, as every tease does, to unveil her treasure slowly. She mightdisappear for a day or two, yet when she returned, her argument picked up at theexact point where it left off.“Fate is not cruel, however. It seems merciless only when you allow it to catchyou, like a shepherd who refuses to run from a wolf and winds up between itsjaws. If men weren’t so ignorant, they would see that the gods want only ourhappiness. That is why humans began to worship in the first place, out ofgratitude.”“Or fear,” Socrates interrupted.She shook her head. “Fear isn’t worship. Fear arises when you believe that thegods are gone. An absent god can be malicious or vengeful. He could be thehidden reason your crops failed or your house burned down. Anything is possiblewhen humans are no longer connected to the gods.”Socrates replied, “I could argue the opposite. The gods are amused by our ruin.They watch us murder and go to war, but do nothing to stop us. How can you claimthat they want our happiness? Where’s the proof?”By this point Socrates would be so immersed in conversation with Diotima thathis tools were lying useless on the ground. He didn’t notice the glances ofpassersby, who had already begun to whisper that Socrates was forgetting how towork.“It can’t be proven that the gods want us to be happy,” said Diotima.“But you just said—”She seized his hand to make him stop talking. Her clasp was warm and weathered,like the hand of someone destined never to live under a roof. “Listen closely.The gods are here, walking beside us. Our ancestors saw them. Pallas Athena rodein the same chariot with Achilles at Troy. They were blessed, our ancestors, butwe are more blessed. The gods no longer cradle us like nursemaids with adrooling infant. They have freed us, so that we can know ourselves. Without thatknowledge, life is meaningless.”How could anyone not be seduced by such talk? Socrates felt giddy, as if herwords were strong wine. Diotima noticed. “You’re trembling like a baby, but Iwon’t hold you to my breast. It’s a rather withered breast, as you can see. Takehope. There’s more to say.”She got up and went away. Only then did Socrates notice how late the hour was.The last light was fading, and he had no new statues to sell. That meant nomoney to take home, which meant that Xanthippe would be in a foul mood. Thesethings mattered, and yet in some part of him they didn’t amount to anything. Although at the end of their last meeting Socrates had promised to catch up withAlcibiades when his friend was calmer, he didn’t get the chance. Hotheaded,always running after lovers, after glory or after shame, Alcibiades was rarelycalm. But that wasn’t the reason. Socrates didn’t come to Alcibiades, becauseAlcibiades came to him first. He pounded on the door of his house, which stoodin the worst quarter of the city, where the springs had become foul and thewomen had to trudge a long way to fill their clay jugs. Alcibiades knockedagain. He was fearless, but he hoped that Xanthippe wouldn’t answer it, or ifshe did, he hoped she would not be holding anything she could swing.Still there was no sound of anyone answering the door. Alcibiades raised hishand to knock again, then thought better of it.“Did a secret voice tell you not to?”He whirled around to face Socrates, who had quietly come up behind him. “I havea voice like that. It tells me when I am about to do wrong.” He was dangling thethread of an innocent conversation, but Alcibiades didn’t take the bait.“There’s a war. You haven’t heard?”Socrates didn’t reply. He looked away toward the sea, even though the sea wasout of sight.“I have to sail on the first tide,” said Alcibiades. “But I wanted to ask you.Is this when I die? You said it would be violent. Will I never see Athensagain?”“How should I know?”“What about your voice—won’t it tell you?”Socrates held out his hands like a thief giving proof that he hasn’t snatchedgold trinkets from a stall. “It decides when to come, not me.”Alcibiades stared at the ground, not wanting to show that hope was desertinghim.“Stay home,” said Socrates mildly. “There’s always a reason.”“I can’t stay. My debts, my women. I just thought that you—” Alcibiades stoppedshort. “Never mind. I’m not myself. Come, let’s get drunk.”He pointed toward the closest tavern, but when Socrates didn’t follow, he turnedaround. “If you love me, old man, allow me an hour. Use your philosophy and makeme forget this damned war.”“All right, but we have to go where I want to.”Alcibiades nodded. Socrates led the way uphill, toward the Acropolis. Theywalked in silence, sharing the same thought. They both knew the real reason whyAlcibiades loved Socrates. The gossip about lechery was wrong, yet a pact oflove was sealed between them. There had been a day, seven years before, whenAlcibiades burned to prove himself a warrior. He was an aristocrat, which boughthim an officer’s cloak.The fighting in this battle broke out near the city of Potidaea, one of a stringof battles that had no end in sight. The delusion of empire inflamed Athens, andthe price was constant war with rebel cities. No longer a beardless youth,Alcibiades had reached his full height; he was strong enough to stand in frontof a phalanx of hoplites, citizen-soldiers armed with spear and shield.That day morale ran high. Athens was thirsty for victory, and the enemy had beenstarved by a long blockade from the coast. But Alcibiades couldn’t stand towait, and when he saw the first sign of the enemy, mere specks on a clearhorizon, he broke ranks and ran at them furiously, not looking to see how manyof his men followed. No one followed. The lowest plebe knew how green he was.Ignoring this, Alcibiades closed fast on the enemy, and if he sensed that he wasalone, he didn’t flinch. Hate, but keep silent. When he was close enough, hecocked his arm and flung his spear at a startled foot soldier among the enemy,who couldn’t believe that a lone officer was dashing toward him across openground. The spear soared and came to earth, hitting the ground twenty feetshort. It quivered as it stuck in the dirt. The enemy soldier was almost amused.“Take your spear back home,” he shouted. “Your father wants to teach you toshave.”Alcibiades could have retreated with honor after this futile gesture, butinstead he drew a short sword and swung it around his head, shouting for bloodas he charged.There were two of the enemy in front of him, but they weren’t armed to fight.They were advance scouts sent to count the number of Athenians arrayed over thehill. Both drew their small knives, looking at each other nervously. A madmanwas charging at them, but at least they outnumbered him, and the first clash ofweapons would draw some of their comrades, who were crouching over the risebehind them.A scrawny copse of trees stood to the left, and all at once a man strode out ofit, an older Athenian. The enemy scouts stopped in their tracks, startled, andAlcibiades, who wasn’t as crazed as he acted, slowed down.“Go back,” the older Athenian said gruffly. His voice was low and steady. Theenemy hesitated. It wasn’t clear who the intruder was addressing.The older Athenian brandished his sword. “I am the only one here who has foughthand to hand. This youth”—he nodded at Alcibiades—“thinks that blood is amedicine for fear. It isn’t. So take my advice. Return to your ranks.” He lookeddirectly at the enemy scouts, who, when seen up close, were no older thanAlcibiades. “Tell your comrades you’re lucky to be alive. You met one Athenianwho isn’t afraid to die and another who wishes he wasn’t.”Something in the man’s presence convinced them. The two scouts saluted with abow, as if they had just had a conversation about crops or women, and retreatedwithout shouting for support.The whole thing had the potential for comedy, but Alcibiades was trembling withrage.“You had no right!” he shouted.“To save you? I apologize,” said Socrates. “I fight for life. In your eyes thatmust be a crime.”“Cowardice is a crime. That much I know.” Alcibiades gestured over his shoulder.“My men are watching. What will they say?”Socrates began to walk back toward the Athenian line. “It won’t matter. Theywere never your men.” He turned and gazed at Alcibiades. “Do something to makethem yours. That’s what I just did.”This pact is what made Alcibiades his. The battle went to Athens that day, andAlcibiades proved himself a reckless killer. The troops cheered. And why not?They had witnessed the ridiculous valor of Alcibiades. Instead of laughing, itwas better to respect him. During the victory celebrations, Socrates pulledAlcibiades aside before he was too drunk to listen.He said, “You owe me nothing, except to think about this day. You’ve tried tobecome an animal, and for that you will be called great. But I am ashamed ofyou.”Now, as they reached the top of the Acropolis, Socrates found a block ofrough-hewn marble to sit on. He liked being reminded of his old profession.“It doesn’t matter if you march off and die in battle,” he said. Alcibiadescould have protested that it mattered to him, but he didn’t. He was gloomyenough to seize any consolation. Socrates went on.“War doesn’t simply break out today or tomorrow. Being divided, humans areconstantly at war inside. Even the most contented and calm-looking arepretending, or else they are deluding themselves. Fear and anger, hopelessnessand despair are the enemies in the mind. What is to be done? This war inside isa sickness. The cure is obvious even though few seek it. End the division thatcreates joy one day and sorrow the next.”If this was a tactic to calm Alcibiades down, it worked. He fell into a musingmood.“Maybe we were created to be at war,” he said. “Death is my fate. If you can’tlive with dying, you are not really living.” Like many people who ask forcomfort, he argued to defend his own misery.Socrates replied, “You are saying that you cannot cure yourself, any more than aman who has passed out with fever can prescribe his own medicine. But that’s notthe reality.”Against his will, Alcibiades heard bones crunch, the sickening sound when asword penetrates the enemy’s chest. “Don’t tell me that suffering isn’t real.You can trick me with words, but not about that.”Socrates shook his head. “Reality doesn’t trick anyone. Illusion does nothingelse.” He paused. “We may never meet again, and you are afraid.”“It doesn’t help to tell me,” growled Alcibiades.“We may never meet again,” Socrates repeated, “so listen. I have seen who youreally are, as no one else in the world has. Who you really are is shy, like amaiden afraid to leave her father’s house. I can’t show her to you directly. Shecan only be glimpsed with a sideward glance. Unless you are fortunate, she willevade you your entire life.”He regarded his young friend. “I will never lose you even if you lose yourself.You plaster a layer of pleasure over your pain, the same way a lazy builderthinly covers a wall to hide that it’s cracked and ready to fall down.”Alcibiades moaned. “Stop, just this once.” He turned to go. “Now, of allmoments,” he murmured resentfully.The Sophists weren’t entirely wrong about how Socrates’s students had becomeinfected.Socrates rose from the marble block with a shrug. “Let’s go pray. All thisbanter has made me forget the gods. One must never do that. Forgetting is verydangerous.”“You go. I won’t pray to our fickle gods. Sacrifice a grain of wheat or an ox,it doesn’t matter. They still let us die like flies on a sticky honeycomb,”grumbled Alcibiades.Socrates pointed to a dozen temples on the rocky brow of the Acropolis. “I oncethought the gods lived there, which is as futile as your thinking that theydon’t. To be divine, a god must be everywhere. Which means that the gods arehere, right beside us. When you know that, they will never desert you.”“How did you learn all this?” asked Alcibiades. It was hard to tell whether hewas humbled or just resigned. His debts, his women. He had no choice but to goto war, where Socrates didn’t matter a fig.“What I tell you comes from my lips, but not from me,” replied Socrates quietly.“I say what my daemon would have me say.” This was Socrates’s name for his innervoice.“So you are possessed,” said Alcibiades wryly.“Yes, like the madwoman who misled me.”They didn’t linger long on the holy mount. Alcibiades embraced his teacher andwhispered in his ear, “Don’t hate me. You’ve shown me the image of wisdom. Iwould rather die than forget it.”They both knew he only half meant it. Alcibiades galloped down the hill, notlooking back at Socrates or the Acropolis. A soldier knows what to do the nightbefore he sails. Debauchery can be as good as philosophy. Not everyone isblessed to be ugly and a nobody.Much evil news would follow, but Socrates ignored it. As tenderly as he lovedAlcibiades, he loved the mystery more. He continued to try and outwit ignorancewith words. It was the only way to give a glimpse, in a fleeting second, of thedivine.Everyone knows how Athens repaid Socrates. He was tried on a charge of promotingfalse gods and corrupting the city’s youth. Five hundred jurors sat for thetrial, and the verdict was “guilty” by four or five votes. After his sentencewas handed down, the condemned man sat up all night with a cup of hemlock by hisside, chatting cheerfully with his friends, even though death was at his elbow.They wept. They begged him to escape; a boat was ready for him in the harbor.But Socrates was completely indifferent. It was as if he wasn’t going to die, ornever could. Once he drank the poison cup, he was ready to solve the lastriddle.What about glamorous Alcibiades? The peculiar thing about omens is that theynever do any good, but they never wear off either. Alcibiades threw himself intoeverything. He spoke at the assembly, and listeners compared his silver tongueto that of Pericles. He led military expeditions and killed more Spartans, andwhen an expedition to Sicily turned into a fiasco, he took a ship by dead ofnight and joined the Spartans. He tried the same double game with the Persians,and whether it was beauty, courage, recklessness, or cunning that kept himalive, Alcibiades proved something. Omens can be beaten. Doom loses to thefastest runner.Until the day it happened. He stayed among the Persians, who were masters ofluxury beyond anything dreamed of in Greece. One afternoon Alcibiades strolledout of his house to walk off a hangover; even with his temples throbbing, hecould hardly remember the air smelling sweeter. He closed his eyes to inhalemore deeply and thus missed his attackers. They sprang on him with knives, andfive minutes later he was a corpse from which flowed a surprising amount ofblood. The dry ground thirstily drank it up. When his body was returned toAthens for burial, the widow of Alcibiades followed it in long veils with herface to the ground, hardly able to see her feet for the tears in her eyes, whilehalf of Athens rejoiced that he was gone.Revealing the VisionAncient Greece seems irrelevant, with its many gods and goddesses, if you acceptthat monotheism stands for progress. Socrates lived at least five hundred yearsafter the book of Job was written. From a Judeo-Christian perspective, anythingthat he has to say reveals much about philosophy, but almost nothing aboutreligion.But no one could be more relevant than Socrates if you change the lens. If Godis about our own awareness, then “Know thyself” has huge religious implications.In Athens during the life of Socrates, despotism was a constant threat, andsince despots tend to be reactionaries, religion was used to keep people inline. Obedience, superstition, and fear are powerful political tools. In thatregard, we are the children of Socrates, but also of his enemies. This soundsimpossible, since it’s like sympathizing with the executioner and his victim.But consider what each side stood for.When they condemned Socrates to death, the reactionary forces in Athens wantedto defend the gods and keep young people from being corrupted—in this case,“corruption” is a code word for having opinions that challenge the status quo.Socrates stood for the opposite, questioning all received opinions and authority(hence the label that most people remember when they think about Socrates, agadfly).What remains so astonishing about the trial of Socrates, nearly twenty-fivehundred years later, is that anyone cared. When was the last time a philosopherendangered the public welfare? Or when the definition of truth was a matter oflife and death? Reading the dialogues set down by Plato, in which Socrates isalways the best, wisest thinker and the most fascinating character, nobody sitson the sidelines. Soldiers, gadabouts, solid citizens, professionalphilosophers, and privileged youth all have their say about truth. A specialcase is the charismatic, but treacherous Alcibiades; we’ll get to him later.It doesn’t matter whether Socrates spoke of God or the gods. He was interestedin the divine. Why? Because he believed that creation had a divine origin, andtherefore so did humans. But there was a journey to take before a person couldexperience this truth personally. If you think of Socrates as only the bravemartyr who drank a cup of hemlock, you are missing the big questions we cannotescape: Who am I? What is the purpose of life? Is there supreme truth? To thesequestions Socrates gave answers that mystify people, then and now, because “Knowthyself” is shortchanged, turning into mild advice from a psychologist ratherthan a life-and-death command to transform ourselves. Socrates didn’t mean knowthat you have a hot temper, like to eat too much, or want to get ahead in theworld. The “self” in “Know thyself” was not the everyday ego personality withits hopes, fears, drives, and desires. Socrates refused to neatly define theself he had in mind, just as Buddha refused to use a word like “God.”Their reasons were the same: it defeats truth to use words, since words implythat you know what you are looking for. Instead, truth is an experience. Itcannot be anticipated, any more than one can anticipate, at age five, what itwill feel like to go to college, get married, and have children. Experience isfresh and new (or should be); thus truth is fresh and new. From there, it’s asmall step to demanding that God be fresh and new. More than anything else, suchan open-ended approach to the truth showed Socrates the way to his trial andexecution.The authorities were right to be afraid of him. As a teacher, Socrates taughthis pupils to question everything, but that by itself wasn’t treasonous.Intellectual freedom, as we would dub it, was a small part of the Socraticmethod. To grasp how truly dangerous Socrates was, you have to go back toDiotima and a revolution in the unfolding of God (in translation, we findSocrates speaking of God and the gods fairly equally). Every society co-opts Godto bolster the status quo. Good people go to church (or make sacrifices at thetemple of Athena), obey the rules, fear divine punishment, worry about theafterlife, feel patriotic, and go to war to defend their country. God supportsthese activities, and so did the Greek gods.Diotima, who gets credit from Socrates for being his teacher and much wiser thanhe, stands for a different perspective, one that is far more radical. She sawthe entire world as a mystery, and delving into the mystery meant overturningthe very notion of truth. What is true? In Athens during the fifth century BCE,the truth was a set of ideas that could be taught, and the better you masteredthese ideas, the wiser you were. A school of teachers known as Sophists (takingtheir name from sophia, the Greek word for “wisdom”) collected the best ideasand passed them on.It was insulting to them when Socrates exposed their methods as empty andmisguided; as a class, the Sophists are portrayed as self-deluded, if not vain,fools. Plato is our source for everything we know about Socrates, essentially,and his low opinion of them serves as a foil for the total integrity ofSocrates, who feared nothing, either as a soldier when he fought for Athens orin the face of death, when he refused all offers to help him run away after thecourt’s guilty verdict.Socrates was a kind of archseducer. He aimed to make truth so seductive that itovertook the mind, purified it of all false beliefs, and ignited a lifelonghunger for a higher reality. For Socrates, truth and reality were the same. Theywere like a brilliant light compared to ordinary reality, which was likewatching shadows playing on the walls of a cave. If you face one way, you arecaptivated by the shadow play; if you turn around, you are dazzled by the light.This position is known as idealism, and we are the children of it, just as weare the children of the practical, hardheaded realism that Socrates was accusedof subverting. Ideals, also known as Platonic forms, are the essence of everydayexperience. The ideal of beauty is perfect and transcendent; because it exists,we see flowers, children, and our lovers as beautiful. The ideal filters downinto the ordinary world, where we see it in diluted form. The same holds for theideals of truth, justice, and all other higher aspirations. We are seeking theideal, starting with everyday experience but rising higher and higher—if we aretrue philosophers, lovers of wisdom—until the pure ideal is revealed. This isthe soul journey Socrates outlined.It’s easy to condemn those who put him to death. And yet, being honest withourselves, we probably want the same thing they defended: a stable societywithout inflammatory radicals who incite discontent. To many good Atheniancitizens, Socrates was a disruptive force. Those who turn over the applecartmust die before they become martyrs and heroes; in their lifetime, they are seenas serious troublemakers.In reality, Socrates worshipped the same gods as every other devout person, andhe disapproved of youth run riot. Dissipation wasn’t part of his teaching, anymore than blasphemy was. Yet in a deeper way Diotima taught blasphemy to herpupil, because “Know thyself” is extremely subversive in the end. To take itseriously means that you will go on a search for God that enters the inner worldand places a lower value on the outer world. It means that you will be in theworld but not of it, that you will become the light of the world rather thanhiding your light under a bushel basket. I can use phrases associated with Jesusbecause the link to Platonism is quite strong.In fact, some scholars believe that the Gospel of John in the New Testament waswritten by someone well versed in Plato’s thought and the Greek ideals. TheChristian tradition is most people’s direct link to Socrates. John’s Gospelcontains no miracles and no Christmas story. It begins with the most abstractapproach to God in the Bible: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word waswith God, and the Word was God.” The word (logos, in Greek) took on a deepmeaning for early Christians. It described who Jesus was and where he came from.John is quite explicit about this:The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory,the glory of the One and Only, who came from the Father, full of grace andtruth. (1:14)But why should Jesus need Socrates and vice versa? One reason is that when Jesuswas crucified, his disciples were left behind expecting, quite literally, thatthe Messiah’s purpose had been to overthrow the Roman Empire, free the Jews frombondage, and reign supreme over the earth. Only then would the Old Testamentprophets like Isaiah be justified and fulfilled.When that didn’t happen, the disciples felt bereft and defeated. John is seen asthe rescuer of Jesus’s mission. He says, in simplest form, “The Messiah did whathe was supposed to do. The Jesus who walked among us was divine as a word, anideal, a spirit. Mortal eyes are fooled into seeing him as mortal too. Seen withthe eyes of the soul, Jesus was an incarnation of spirit, as are all of us whenwe come to God.”What else is John’s message but “Know thyself” restated in Christian terms? Andyet no teaching is harder to follow. One despairs that Socrates and Jesus wereboth persecuted for telling the truth, yet it’s not unexpected.If you want to see how challenging “Know thyself” really is, try to live it fora week. Once a person spends any amount of time looking inward, what is revealedis conflict, confusion, and a completely disorganized world “in here.” Fear andanger roam at will through the psyche. The shadow, which we touched upon in thestory of Job, rules over a hidden realm of guilt and shame. Atavistic impulseslike jealousy, lust, and revenge war with reason. Even if the inner worlddoesn’t reveal turmoil, the alternative may be a humdrum conventionality thatbecomes more depressing the closer you examine it. “Know thyself” makes for arough week and a challenging lifetime.The status quo depends on conformity, not just the dronelike conformity of beesin a hive, but a shared agreement not to look too deeply into human nature.Unable to rid ourselves of mindless drives like lust, greed, and aggression,human beings bought civilization at a price. We gave up complete authenticity inorder to stay safe and sane.Socrates taught the opposite, as did Jesus. He taught that if you go deepenough, there is supreme light beyond the confusion and chaos, the id and theego, sex and the lust for power. Only the light is real. In various guises, wewill encounter this claim over and over as human beings ponder who God actuallyis. Diotima apparently passed the idea on to Socrates, and he took it to thestreets. The Sophists were deluded to assume that the truth could be doled outin neatly wrapped packages. But Socrates may have been deluded to assume thatthe way to the truth can be taught at all.The raucous, brilliant, rebellious, treacherous Alcibiades raises grave doubtson that score. He led disastrous military adventures abroad, the worst being aninfamous war to conquer Greece. Then he abruptly turned on his heels andbetrayed Athens by selling his services to the Persians, who made what use ofhim they could before killing him. Socrates taught a high-born, gifted pupil whowound up making no use of his teaching whatever. When Alcibiades drunkenlybreaks into a banquet, he insists on lying on the couch closest to his oldteacher, and when the company takes to praising Socrates (this is in Plato’sSymposium), Alcibiades’s voice is the loudest. But he was not a good man. In ourday, preachers would frown and call him godless.Yet every morality tale needs a prodigal son, which is what Alcibiades turnedinto. The difference is that he wasn’t redeemed. That concept, which requiresgrace to descend from God to touch a person’s soul, has yet to arrive on thescene. Reflecting on Socrates, a skeptic may ask how much good wisdom has doneanyone. Isn’t God about faith in the end? Not necessarily. In India there is asaying about the spiritual path: “One spark is enough to burn down the wholeforest.”Which is to say, once you’ve glimpsed the light, eventually the darkness will beconquered. Socrates brought the light of the mind. He wasn’t so much a gadfly asa spark (he used a homelier term, calling himself a midwife to the truth), butwhether the truth needs to be born like a fragile infant or revealed by burningdown the forest of ignorance, the end result is the same. Reality is the light,and the light can only be found in ourselves. In the words “Know thyself” isburied a new belief, that human nature is capable of reaching God without dogma,authority, and fear. The inner journey is afoot, and God has become the highestgoal: complete self-knowledge. To quote another Indian saying, “This is wisdomyou cannot learn; you must become it.”"},{"pageContent":"3 [toc01.xhtml#cha03]St. Paul [toc01.xhtml#cha03]“I Am the Light of the World” [toc01.xhtml#cha03]The Roman Empire is law. It is peace and efficiency. But above all, the empireis power, enforced by its legions, who spread terror everywhere at a flick ofthe emperor’s wrist. It would be insane to laugh at these things. That is,unless God told you that empires are like straw in the wind and crumble likedust in the hands of the Lord.One man who had such thoughts wasn’t undone by them. They taught him how tosurvive. At this very moment he was parched and panting with exhaustion. Helooked sickly and underfed. His limbs were like sticks with knobs where elbowsand knees should be. No one would have given him much of a chance, if he hadbeen sentenced to the galleys. But he hadn’t been, luckily. The judge wasindifferent to religious fanatics, so to this one, who appeared on Rome’srecords as Saul, he handed down a light sentence.“Thirty days on the road gangs. And make sure he doesn’t get near any otherJews. They’re stirred up already.” As far as keeping order went, for the legionsputting down a food riot was half the trouble of a God riot.As Saul slaved on the road gang, sweat dripped into the scrawny prisoner’smouth; it tasted salty and dirty. A light wind had risen over the desert, whichwas a mixed blessing, since it stirred up a choking dust even as it cooled yourskin.The prisoner next to Saul, a fat Cappadocian who stole a loaf of bread butdidn’t run far enough before he started to devour it, poked him in the ribs.“You, pick up the pace. That guard is watching, and he looks like he could eatnails.”Saul nodded and passed a limestone block down the line. He never fought backwhen he wound up in prison, except with his tongue. You didn’t know who might beconcealing a dagger, even after the Romans did their morning search. Would Godwant one of his chosen to carry a weapon in self-defense? No. Of that Saul wassure.Under Roman justice he was named Saul, and he didn’t say different. Jewish namessometimes went down well, especially near Antioch, where the judges were mostlyJewish. Otherwise, he’d offer his Latin name, Paulus or Paul. There was always achance of leniency for someone like him, born a Roman citizen. Leniency wasnothing more than being given bread without green mold on the crust and waterwithout black specks in it—good enough. If you could look in his heart, though,Saul was dead. He perished the instant Paul was born.The watchful guard glowered at the sun overhead. He uttered an oath and turnedhis face away, so the pace slowed down again. The Cappadocian was bored enoughto make conversation.“What were you done for?”“I scare people, some of them,” said Paul.“How?”“I tell them that God loves them.”The conversation ended there. Paul smiled to himself. He was almost fifty, andso far what had he suffered for Jesus? He had been lifting rocks since dawn, andto keep his mind off the pain in his back, he counted up in his mind. Publiclywhipped? Five times. Thirty-nine lashes minus one, given by the Jews, his ownpeople. Clubbed over the head until he was senseless? Three times. Stoned? Onlyonce, thank God. Already several brothers had died from stoning. Stephen was thefirst, a horrible way to be taken into God’s embrace.Paul’s mind skipped ahead to avoid dwelling on the thought. Shipwrecked? Threetimes, including that one night he spent in the water, praying until dawn cameand the survivors were pulled from the sea. Most of his prayers had been aboutsea monsters.After surviving such torments, he wasn’t proud of his courage. Pride was a sin.The closest Paul came to being proud was this: among all the brethren, he toiledthe hardest, walked the farthest, and bore affliction with utmost silence. Heloved scaring people with God’s love. The poor Jews he met expected to fear andobey the Lord. Paul showed them a blinding love instead. No wonder so many ranaway.Did he feel loved at that moment, trapped in this killing heat with the guardstesting their short whips on their thighs, just for practice? Yes, he did. Infact, that moment was a supreme example of God’s love, because pain was areminder to look for grace, which was everywhere.For Paul there were only two kinds of men in this world, those Paul hadconverted and those he might convert. Nothing else mattered. Even under the lashhe never missed a moment to practice his skills at debate, running over hisopponent’s argument in his head.If God is love, why do we suffer?To remind us that we are children of Adam and Eve, who brought sin into theworld.But you say that your Messiah died for our sins.Absolutely.Then why are the Romans, who don’t believe in the Messiah, lording it over youand punishing you?Because they do not realize that they are damned.Damned? Look at them. They eat grapes and sit in the shade while you sufferunder them like a dog. So what good is your salvation?“My kingdom is not of this world,” said my master. I am promised a banquet inheaven at God’s table. The faint sound that will reach my ear is the screamingof pagans in the fiery pit.Just to imagine such a debate filled Paul’s heart with a sense of victory. Godhad delivered him so many times that he might do it again, at any moment. Theshackles and chains around his feet could turn to flowers. The guards could fallto the ground with shaking fits. Musing on this, he fumbled the next rock andalmost dropped it.Up the line a Greek Cypriot with half an ear missing and filed teeth growled,“Keep it moving. This is my last day. I’m not letting you screw it up.”“It could be your last day on earth,” Paul said.“What?”“God may hurl you into the furnace, where there will be wailing and gnashing ofteeth. Mind the Lord, my friend. He is watching.”The Greek Cypriot would have struck him except for the rock he had to passalong. “You’re saying the gods want to kill me?”“No. I’m saying that death comes to all. Have you considered how you will bejudged? You should. You don’t look like a man who lives carefully.” Paulindicated the missing piece of ear. Usually he didn’t preach in the middle ofhard labor. But you never knew the right moment, until the Lord showed it.On a mission to Philippi Paul had been jailed with another missionary, Silas.They were marched into a deep dungeon where half the prisoners were insane orparalyzed from the isolation and darkness.Paul could feel Silas trembling as they lay back-to-back for protection, wrappedin filthy rags.“Be strong, brother,” Paul whispered. “God sees us.” He had a premonition.Just before dawn the ground began to shake. Paul woke Silas and motioned towardthe door. The second tremor would come in a few seconds, and Paul knew withoutthinking that it would be much stronger. The dungeon would erupt in terrifiedcries and a crush to smash down the door. God’s timing had to be precise if histwo missionaries were to survive. The second tremor came like thunder from theearth; the prison walls started to crack—they were like eggshells to theLord—and glimpses of dawn could be seen among the falling debris. Silas sat upwith a start, staring in confusion.“Come, brother,” said Paul, pulling him to his feet before Silas was awakeenough to be terrified.The prisoners panicked, as Paul foresaw, but he and Silas were now nearest thedoor when it fell off its hinges. They made it to the stairs as the earthroared. Thick dust stifled the dim light, and a swarm of bodies clawing theirway up the stairs pulled the two Christians apart. Silas repeated God’s name ashe clung to the shaking walls, groping his way upward. At ground level he spieda three-foot fissure in the outer wall and slipped through.He bent over, coughing dust, his eyes running with tears. When he could seeagain, the scene filled Silas with awe. The earthquake hadn’t torn the prisondown, but made only the single crack that he had squeezed through. All around,the nearby buildings were still standing. The Romans in the barracks weren’teven awake, until a solitary guard began to shout as escapees ran down thestreet, many half-naked and dragging their chains.Silas called out Paul’s name with one breath and praised God with the next, butas one prisoner after another squeezed through the crack, he couldn’t spot him.There was no time to waste. The Roman garrison was alerted now; he could hearthe clank of swords and tramping boots. The first soldiers on the scene made awall of shields to push back the last stragglers coming out, and within minutesthe opening was surrounded.What choice did he have? Silas ducked into a twisting narrow alley and ran. Hewas still young, and he ran a long way before the burning in his lungs forcedhim to stop. He didn’t know the town, so he couldn’t find the cluster of smallhouses where several Christians lived. Lost and alone, Silas tried not to thinkof his wife back in Antioch. He slid to the ground from exhaustion, his backagainst a wall that was still cold from the night chill.“Look at this. Does bread get any finer? Eat. Terror is good for the appetite.”Even before he heard the voice, Silas had felt a man’s shadow pass over him. Helooked up. It was Paul, a glint in his eye and a round loaf of crusty bread inhis hand.“Don’t worry, I didn’t steal it. It’s a gift, from the jail keeper.”Silas was astonished. “Who?”Paul sank down and broke the bread in two. He muttered a short prayer and handedthe larger half to Silas.“I converted our jailer.”Astonishment kept Silas from eating. “During the earthquake?”“What better time? There was a miracle at hand. I couldn’t just let it go towaste.” Paul reached into the sack he wore at his waist. “Not leaving out olivesand cheese, which our sleepy jailkeeper had set out for his breakfast. Don’tlook so surprised. How many miracles do jailers see? He was impressed, and heoffered this bread as a token.” Paul ignored Silas’s astonishment. “It’s good,isn’t it? I should convert a few bakers.”Silas pointed to a stray dog that was sniffing at them from a distance. Itwhined, testing to see whether they would throw him a scrap or kick him away.“You’d convert him if you could, wouldn’t you?” said Silas.Paul gave his companion a sidelong glance before deciding that this was a joke.“Yes,” he said curtly. “He looks ready.”Raising the next bite to his mouth, he noticed that his hand was tremblingslightly. Paul felt immensely calm inside, but apparently his mortal body wasstirred by the earthquake and God’s intervention. Paul considered this incident with the converted jailer a great victory. Hereported it to the church at Antioch, where the strongest believers lived.Strong or not, they would falter if he didn’t regularly reinforce their faithwith good news. Faraway Jerusalem was harder to persuade. There the Christianswere as suspicious of Paul as an old rabbi in the provinces. Mistrust grew, nomatter how many miracles he reported. Called before the assembled faithful inJerusalem, Paul had to defend himself. His persecution of Christians as Saul waswell remembered. For now, the Romans were lax about letting Christians assemble,and when Paul appeared, the torch-lit hall was full.The elders, some of them styled as apostles, sat on a raised platform. Paul wasreminded too clearly of judges’ benches. If he was inclined to be nervous, herose in a fit of anger.“I am not here to be looked down upon,” he began. “Judge me as you wish. I havea calling no one here can challenge. If you speak against me, you speak againstthe mission I was given by Jesus.“This was a brazen claim, and it caused such an uproar that he couldn’t continue.“You never met Jesus!” a voice shouted. Half a dozen others took up the cry.Paul raised his hands to quiet their outrage. “I met Jesus in spirit. If youtruly knew him, you would understand.”The outcry against him doubled. His impudence was shocking. The leaders inJerusalem had claimed sole authority since the crucifixion. Chiefly they weretwo, Peter, the preeminent disciple, and Jesus’s own brother, James. Both wereseated in the company, but neither showed any reaction.Paul raised his voice over the din. “How can you deny me? If you say that onlyyou who were with the Master are the true church, it will die when you die. Isthat what you want?”He didn’t wait for a reply. “I know how you distrust me. I am a Roman citizen bybirth, and the Romans hate us. I persecuted you myself, because your beliefswere beyond reason. Back in Rome they don’t understand a king who is not of thisworld. Neither did I. But you also know what happened to me when I saw thelight.”“What you say happened,” an angry voice shouted.“So that’s it?” Paul shouted back. “The Lord calls me, but you have the right tosit over him? If I don’t win your love, then God’s love is cancelled?”The murmuring quieted. Paul felt the slightest wave of sympathy; he had to playon it.“When he was teaching, anyone could set eyes upon Jesus,” he said, “includingthe foolish eye, the ignorant eye, the lustful, vain, proud eye. I don’t demeanwhat you saw. You have a blessed eye, because you saw the Lord incarnate. At thesame time, don’t demean what I saw.”The disgruntled had quieted down completely; he was beginning to win them over.But Paul knew that very few of them had the courage to think for themselves;they looked at Simon Peter to find out what he thought.With a faint gesture that brought total silence, Peter had something to say.“The Lord’s blessing falls on everyone, like the rain. Didn’t our Master say so?Then how would you separate the worthy from the unworthy?”It was an ambiguous utterance, and Paul faced it head-on. “The man I once was,Saul of Tarsus, would be unworthy if he were standing here. By the grace of theLord he is dead. I had a second birth.”Grumbling arose; he had gone a step too far. The brothers were tired of hearingabout Paul’s miracle story. How Saul the zealous persecutor of Christians hadbeen struck from his horse while riding from Jerusalem to Damascus. How thelight of Christ blinded him for three days, until it was restored by a gentlebrother, Ananias. Paul repeated it in every sermon before Jews and gentiles.Some might call that vanity.Now an old man, Cleopas slowly elbowed his way to the front; the companyrespectfully gave way. He nodded at Simon Peter, who said, “Bear witness.” Theroom became quiet again.“I was too afraid to walk with the Master that terrible last day,” said Cleopas.“I didn’t pick up his cross when he stumbled. From a distance I beheld the threecrosses being raised on Golgotha, and I ran away.” Cleopas gestured toward Paul.“Is not my unbelief greater than his?”Someone vigorously shouted, “No!”Cleopas ignored him. “Our brother Paul preaches that even the worst may be savedthrough faith. He is stronger than me in that too. Let me tell you why.”The old man unfolded a story. He and another disciple were walking away fromJerusalem after the Romans executed Jesus. It was better to leave the cityquickly, for their own safety. The Pharisees might convince Pilate to crucifyJesus’s disciples next.On the road Cleopas said little, lost in his guilty thoughts, until hiscompanion began to weep. He rejected Cleopas’s attempts to comfort him. “We’llnever see him again. Our devotion was a waste,” the companion cried. “Wefollowed a false messiah. Don’t you see that?”His companion’s rashness upset Cleopas, who was naturally gentle, but he had tospeak out now. “I’ve seen him heal the sick with my own eyes. So have you. Andwhat of the three women, and the angels?”Three women of Galilee, including Mary Magdalene, had followed Jesus and hisdisciples as they wandered. These same three had gone to the tomb of Jesus thatmorning and found it empty. Suddenly, as they stood in confusion, angelsappeared to them announcing that Jesus was alive. Death was nothing to God, andhe had lifted his son from the grave. When the women ran back to the discipleswith this news, an uproar occurred; one faction rejoiced while the other angrilydenounced the thieves who had stolen Jesus’s body during the night.“I saw you rejoice with the women,” Cleopas reminded his companion, who wouldhave replied sharply, but they were interrupted by a stranger approaching on theroad. Instead of nodding and passing on his way, the stranger gave them apenetrating look.“What were you just talking about?” he asked, speaking in Aramaic.The two disciples shrugged nervously, unwilling to give hints about themselves.The stranger was a fellow Jew, but that didn’t make him safe.“You are walking from Jerusalem. Has something happened there?” the strangerdemanded. He never took his eyes off Cleopas, who felt his heart burning withgrief.“You don’t know? The city has erupted,” his companion told the stranger, and herecounted Jesus’s trial and his betrayal by the priests of the Temple.“So the Jews are squabbling over the Messiah again,” said the stranger.“Of course, what else?”“Messiah fever ends with sticks and stones,” the stranger mused.But the fever had not broken. Under Herod the Romans had recently redoubledtheir persecutions. More than ever, the Jews needed a mighty leader to drive theinvaders from the holy land.“You are a Jew,” said Cleopas, overcoming his wariness. “You must feel the sameneed as we do.”“So, the Messiah will come when our people are most in need?” the strangerasked. “Then why hasn’t he? We’re desperate enough.”“We thought he did come,” the companion replied in dejection.“Did he arm you? I don’t see weapons unless you are hiding them under yourcloaks,” the stranger remarked.“Jesus was a man of peace,” Cleopas interjected.“Then you must expect two messiahs. One to defeat Caesar, the other to calm thewaters.”The stranger’s talk was challenging, and the three became absorbed. He took themback to Moses and visited everything that scripture said about the Messiah, thathe would be persecuted and misunderstood, that the learned would not understand,but only the simple of heart. He would be a man of sorrows on this earth, but aking in heaven.“Our Master is in heaven,” cried Cleopas.He was shaken by the anger that flared up in the stranger’s voice. “Your masterhas fools for followers if he shows them miracles and still they do notbelieve.” This was his only outburst, and it subsided quickly.When they reached the village of Emmaus, Cleopas knew a place friendly todisciples, and he invited the stranger, who was about to continue on, to havesupper with them there. Seeing the darkening sky, he agreed.At this point in his tale Cleopas had a hard time suppressing his emotion, whichhappens with old men, but he was not ashamed of it as many old men are.“We sat down at table, the bread was brought. The stranger bent his head tobless it, and when he broke bread, our eyes were opened. It was Jesus! God hadblinded us to test our faith. Even as I rejoiced to see our Master again, Itrembled inside. For three days I had doubted him. How could I believe in aMessiah that the Romans could kill at their whim?”The old man pointed to Paul, raising his voice, which no longer quavered. “If Ican be blessed to see our Master alive, so can he.”It was a stunning moment, and Paul had to force himself not to follow it up withmore rhetoric. He embraced Cleopas and waited while he slowly hobbled back tohis seat. Did Peter, leaning back in his rough wooden chair, betray suspicion inhis eyes or approval? Paul, who had to read men well in order to survive, didn’tcare. He showed a careless disregard as he looked away. The spirit had anointedhim. It didn’t matter a straw what Peter, the great Simon Peter, thought aboutit. If Jesus wasn’t a king of this world, didn’t it follow that his truedisciples were not of this world either?The atmosphere had relaxed by now. From his throne Peter nodded without comment.He would relent that far, at least. If winning were enough, this was the end ofit. But who said that winning was enough for Paul?To the crowd he said, “I sense that you have given me your approval. But noteveryone with his full heart. I don’t care, because I love you all fiercely, assouls baptized in the name of the Holy Spirit.“I see you as ghosts compared to unbelievers. Your flesh is a mirage. You arereally the light of God. I say this to you, and I would say the same to Caesarbefore he killed me, or to the next gentile as he is about to spit on me.”Paul intended these words to create a stir, and they did. Jerusalem buzzed likea hornets’ nest all week. Jerusalem was happy to see his back as Paul went onthe road. Let him go and be as reckless as he wanted, people said. The Lordwould protect him—or not. The miracles never ceased. Paul converted the masses, one person at a time. Manywere so fervent in their belief that they witnessed the risen Christ with theirown eyes. Rome became nervous. These Christians believed in the impossible, andyet the impossible kept spreading without check, infecting one town afteranother. Local officials kept reassuring Rome that everything was under control.In fact, they could hardly tell Jews from Christians. Why even bother? Both hadgrandiose fantasies about a Messiah who would overthrow Caesar. The onlydifference was that the Christians had had their Messiah, and now he was dead.When miracles are abroad, people want more, and this left room for magicians.Paul was set against their kind: magus or sorcerer, whatever title they fancied,they were blasphemers and sons of the Devil. But it wasn’t yet the Lord’s willfor Paul to fight them. He bided his time, converting two thieves in one jail.Sometime later, when he had returned a third time to the faithful in Antioch,God’s hand moved over Paul. He was guided to Cyprus; the sea looked dark as hemade the passage over.“Do you see anything there, brother?” he asked Barnabas, the disciple whom Godhad picked for his companion. Puzzled, Barnabas gazed into the waters, whichwere unusually still; he shook his head.“Fish?” he said.Paul smiled. The calm sea, glassy and still, was like a mirror. Not one to seeyourself in, but one to see through. Just as the face hides the soul, areflection in a mirror hides what lies behind it. Infinite love was veiled by awoman’s eyebrow that needed plucking, a rouged cheek, the first wrinkles of apreening lover gazing at himself when his mistress wasn’t looking. Vanity makesus love the reflection, which is why God must send hints and omens, to stop ourself-love and force us to see the truth.They landed in Cyprus, and Paul immediately had an inspiration. “We must findthe God-fearing,” he told Barnabas. This was a special term among Christians. Ithad become fashionable to shop for a god. Pagans had become disgruntled seekers,and a few knocked on the door of the synagogues. The Jews inside felt afraid,but some argued that isolation only made them more hated. Let the pagans see forthemselves what a holy place was like.Cautiously the doors were opened to these seekers, who became known asGod-fearers, because they reverenced God even though they had no religion. Evenhigh-born Romans looked in. They sometimes heard the rabbi preach against theChristians, and this made them curious. On Cyprus there was one of these curiousRomans, Sergius Paulus by name, who presided over the city of Paphos asproconsul. The local Christians pounced on Paul and Barnabas with great news.This powerful man might want to be baptized. One more sermon, a powerful one,and his spirit would surely cross over.“I’d be ashamed not to convert a man named Paul, but what sort is he?” askedPaul.“He’s a man of reason, a sensible man,” the local brothers said.The worst kind, Paul thought, but kept it to himself.His premonition was justified. Sergius Paulus was found in his house recliningon cushions with a tolerant smile on his face and a beaker of wine, half empty,in his hand. At his feet sat—what else?—a magician making cotton balls appearand disappear under a red velvet cap. He wore an even wider smile and wasdrinking from an even bigger wine beaker.“Elymas, get up,” the proconsul ordered, wiping his mouth with a napkin. “YourGod is waiting for you to defend him, and put down that wine. Yahweh isn’tBacchus. He wants you sober.” So this Elymas was a Jew who had insinuatedhimself with the Romans.Elymas turned to Paul without extending his hand. “I’ve heard of your prophet.The one who rose from the dead. I won’t perform that trick today. I respect youas one mind to another.”“A magician with a mind would be refreshing,“ Paul replied.Elymas laughed with civilized tolerance. Paul was rankled, but he knew betterthan to be goaded. The two of them, the Roman and the magician, had probablyconcocted this little opening scene.Boldly Paul addressed the proconsul. “I am of no use to a reasonable man, andyou are of no use to me. My message is faith. Five hundred brothers and sistershave already witnessed the risen Christ. I am one of them.”Sergius Paulus frowned. “More politeness might serve you better.”“When a man’s house is on fire, who does him more good, the servant who is toopolite to wake his master or the one who pounds on his door?” asked Paul.Elymas interrupted. “I can produce fire if you want,” he said smoothly, “butnobody here is asleep.”“All are asleep who mock the risen Christ,” said Paul sharply and turned back tothe Roman. “I am not disparaging your understanding, but it takes no mind to seethe sun. Reason is great; faith is greater. With his paltry sorcery thismagician may persuade you of anything. Falseness is his trade. But I bring you amatter of life and death. Don’t fritter it away because you are amused byillusions.”Sergius Paulus saw an opening for a contest. “Will you take this lying down?” heasked Elymas.“I am not offended. Jesus was a great magus. His followers call him the HolySpirit. But I am master of spirits, and they speak when I command.” Elymas bowedto Paul with mock respect. “Even if your sincerity is undoubted.”“Are you entertained by your own blasphemy?” Paul asked.“As entertained as you are by your own rhetoric,” said Elymas. “Why do you thinkthe Romans are masters over us Jews? They use reason; they laugh atsuperstition. I suspect you rail against me, because you know that you havealready lost before you began.”The proconsul was enjoying himself, and Paul allowed the magician his oilyarguments. He had to, until the Lord told him what to do. All at once, he did.Paul turned fiercely on Elymas. “Unrighteous sinner, you shame yourself in theeyes of God. He knows you, and he is angry.”Paul raised his hand. The gesture looked so much like a magician’s that Elymassmiled.“The Holy Spirit commands!” Paul shouted.Suddenly Elymas groped at the air. Then with a moan he collapsed on the ground.“Do you see it, proconsul? I do, and so does this wretch,” Paul declared.The Roman, who had jumped to his feet, looked bewildered. “See it? What do youmean?”“The Lord has surrounded him with a dark mist. Now he’s clawing the empty air.For a season this blasphemer will be blind.”“Elymas, take my hand,” Sergius Paulus commanded. He held his outstretched handa foot from the magician’s face, but Elymas only made pitiful noises as hereached toward emptiness.The proconsul was shaken, but only for a moment. Magi visited every day. The newone knew higher magic. “Stay. Teach me,” he said, searching in his toga for somegold coins.Paul shook his head. “All you care about is power.”“Which I will share with you. Come.” The proconsul had found some gold and wavedit in the air.Paul pointed to the blind magus. “Here is power beyond your understanding. Itwas not my mind that did it, and your mind is equally useless before God.”He started to leave, and the Roman almost called for soldiers to block his way.His hand was halfway to the bell cord. But Paul stopped of his own accord,returning and kneeling by Elymas, who was no longer making a sound.Paul spoke to him. “This Roman has no more use for you. In an hour you will bewandering the streets helplessly, begging to be healed. Nothing will help. Butin a few months the blindness will lift of its own accord. The Holy Spirit hasdone this thing.”Elymas clutched at Paul’s arm. “Take me with you.”“You would suffer more than you do now.”“No!” Sheer panic was in the magus’s voice.The spirit shifted in Paul from anger to gentleness. “Jesus preached, ‘I am thelight of the world.’ He did not call himself the light of Jerusalem or the lightof the Jews.”“But he is the Messiah,” Elymas murmured. “He must be for the Jews.”“Which means you own him, as a Jew owns a cow or a prayer shawl?” Paul leanedcloser and reduced his voice to a whisper. “Hear me, sorcerer. He owns you. Thatis all you need to think on. There is no debate worth having.”He was ready to leave now, and he shot the Roman a hard glance, making his handfall from the bell cord.“So you won’t help him? You know very well that I’m going to have him draggedinto the street,” said Sergius Paulus.Paul shook his head and walked away.Later, Paul related the incident to Barnabas, who related it to the brothers inCyprus.Soon it spread throughout the Christian world. Skeptics in Jerusalem saidnothing. They kept their counsel, suspicious of the man who rode to Damascus andno less suspicious of the man who was riding to grace. Paul didn’t care. He sawevery convert he had made standing behind him, every possible convert waiting upahead. It was only a matter of time before they lined the whole road as far asGod’s eye could see.Revealing the VisionIf you were to meet someone from the golden age of Athens on the street today,you might look down on their belief in gods sitting atop Mount Olympus, enjoyinga never-ending party at human expense as they roiled the seas, inflicted famine,and destroyed individuals at will. But those fifth-century Athenians might lookdown on you for believing that God is a matter of faith. In the Christian erathe divine light moved from the mind to the soul. God rose above the naturalworld. He no longer roiled the seas or bothered with thunderbolts. He becamemore wondrous and mysterious. He kept one of his old ways, however, that offorcing his devotees into peril.Two peculiar phenomena dominate the early Christian church: miracles andmartyrdom. They account for why the new religion spread like wildfire. EarlyChristians were on the receiving end of persecution, but also the gift ofvisible miracles. In the first generation after the crucifixion, all of Jesus’sclosest followers died for their beliefs, and when a rabid mob stoned Stephen,the first martyr, only a year or two after the crucifixion, they were goaded onby a hater of the new faith, Saul of Tarsus.How this persecutor named Saul turned into Paul and became the greatest singleshaper of Christianity is one of the crucial conversions in human history.Paul’s experience on the road to Damascus has become the prototype for alldramatic conversion stories. Being blinded by the light, which is what happenedto Saul on his journey to inflict more pain on Christians, defines the essenceof experiencing God in a sudden epiphany. But there’s a larger question to ask.Why should the threat of a violent death cause a religion to spread? Persecutionis usually quite effective, for a short or a long time, at keeping the powerlessdowntrodden.Christianity had a secret weapon. Martyrdom opened the way to miracles. Thisconnection was made from the very beginning. The crucifixion was an act ofutmost violence, but it led to the resurrection, an event of suprememiraculousness. St. Paul played a central role in cementing this connection. Heinsisted that a true Christian must believe in the literal fact of theresurrection. Soon, to die for Jesus became a sacrifice that ensured a passageto heaven. The fact that the same belief exists in Islam derives directly fromChristianity; both are “religions of the Book” that promise salvation in theafterlife, placing the physical world so far below heaven that inviting death inGod’s name is a righteous act.Paul also states that five hundred converts had personally witnessed the risenChrist. If that is so, then the early church was the focus of the greatest massmystical event in history. Paul’s writings survive in the form of a sheaf ofletters sent to congregations in Ephesus, Corinth, and other areas from Israelto Asia Minor. Scholars believe that these letters could be the earliest genuinerecord of Christianity, predating even the writing of the four Gospels.Be that as it may, the force of Paul’s mind prevailed. If only the first letterto the Corinthians had survived, his words would be indelible, since they arewritten with such passion and confidence:Love is patient and kind; love is not jealous or boastful; it is not arrogant orrude. Love does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; itdoes not rejoice at wrong, but rejoices in the right. (13:4–6)These words echo Jesus, of course, but they are all the more reassuring becausethey come from a flawed mortal who had been transformed. In another voice Paulcan chide and correct the newly formed believers. In yet another he sets down inplain language what it means to enter the miraculous world opened by Christ:When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasonedlike a child; when I became a man, I gave up childish ways. For now we see in amirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall understandfully, even as I have been fully understood. (13:11–12)The poetic writing is breathtaking. The mind behind it had to work againstunseen opponents, however, to win the day. We don’t know if Paul was a rival toPeter, Jesus’s most favored disciple, or James, the brother of Jesus, who hadthe strongest hereditary claim to lead the new faith. I portray them in conflictbecause the picture of early Christianity has been turned on its head in thepast fifty years. It was once accepted that after the crucifixion there was auniform religion led by Peter and the other apostles, but this picture dependedon the absence of contrary scripture like the Gnostic gospels. When they came tolight, very late in the game, these documents revealed a contentious, fermentingsituation full of power struggles. Some very diverse beliefs were held byvarious groups for centuries until they were branded as heresy.I’ve placed Paul at the center of this turbulence and portrayed him as aspiritual warrior. We cannot say which of the early church leaders was the mostcharismatic, but it is undeniable that the volatile mixture of mysticism andviolence needed Paul to stabilize it. Without him, the Christian God would beeven more confusing and contradictory than he is already.Words like “confusing” and “contradictory” are not used by devout Christians,but the New Testament is full of peace juxtaposed with punishment, forgivenesswith vengeance. Christ predicted universal peace on earth, yet he is also quotedsaying, “I have come not to bring peace, but a sword” (Matt. 10:34). I’vealready touched on the fact that the shock of the crucifixion left the earlyfollowers of Jesus feeling left behind. They couldn’t help but cry out, “Whatshould we believe? What should we do?”Some answers were radical. The Gnostic gospels, as an alternative to the fourcanonical Gospels, are a late discovery; they were found in 1945 by accidentwhen two Egyptian farmers wandered into a cave near the town of Nag Hammadi andfound a jar full of ancient manuscripts. Their discovery, now called the NagHammadi Library, contains dozens of diverse documents. In the theological hubbubthat arose after they came to light, the official picture of the early churchwas strongly challenged. Here were believers a hundred years after Jesus’s deathwho held that God is both mother and father, that Mary Magdalene was Jesus’sfavored disciple, and that a congregation should gain nearness to Christ throughdirect revelation rather than written gospels. One document tells us that thecrucifixion itself was an illusion. As the mob watches Jesus’s agony on thecross, he appears in the flesh to Peter to tell him that only the ignorantbelieve in such spectacles, because they cannot see true spirit. In the modernera, these are fascinating possibilities, even though the Gnostic gospels arenot part of any recognized faith.We can’t escape the fact that Paul’s brand of Christianity crushed allopposition, and some of his harsher prejudices have cast a shadow over“Paulianity,” a term that is both admired and denigrated. The bad side ofPaulianity is that it is authoritarian, chauvinist, and puritanical. Sex, likeall temptations of the flesh, stands against spirit, and only marriage makes itpalatable in the Christian scheme. Faith must be absolute; church authoritystands in for God’s authority. If an ordinary person receives a message fromGod, it is mistrusted until tested and approved by the church leaders (incontrast, the Gnostics, whose name comes from the Greek word gnosis, whichliterally means “knowledge,” accepted messages received directly fromGod—perhaps the Shakers, with their ecstatic epiphanies, are an analogy).History is written by the victors, which is never more true than in the historyof the early church. Leaving ancient arguments aside, the God portrayed by Paulis remarkable as an evolution from the past. To begin with, this is no longer abargaining God, offering rewards for good behavior and punishment for bad.Divine love is now offered freely, as grace. It doesn’t have to be deserved. Intaking this step, Paul solved the problem of the fall, when Adam and Eve weredriven out of paradise. As long as the taint of their sin existed in everyperson, a lifetime’s struggle against it was necessary and probably wouldn’twork anyway. Sinners were always bound to backslide; such was the power oftemptation and the weakness built into human nature.But Paul offered redemption and salvation, wiping the slate clean. No longerfrowning down upon his errant children, God sent his son with a message oftransformation. Jesus is the perfectly transformed human being, the new Adam. Heis all goodness, and he dispenses all grace. This would be inspiring enough, butthe same transformation is also held out to true believers. Jesus tells hisdisciples that they are the “light of the world” and will perform even greatermiracles than his own.Paul portrayed a world full of the miraculous. Thanks to Jesus’s sacrifice, anordinary person could “die unto death,” transcending the ultimate fear. Thespectacle of early Christians singing hymns as they were devoured by wild beastsin the Colosseum proved that the spirit was more real than the flesh. This isthe secret that binds miracles and martyrs. Miracles reach down, via divinelove, in the midst of agony.One searches for passages in the Old Testament where God is primarily to beloved rather than feared. The New Testament is full of them. To theologians theterm agape, one of several Greek words for “love,” defines God’s bond withhumanity, and the touchstone is John 3:16, still one of the most moving versesin its simplicity: “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begottenSon, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlastinglife.”It cannot be verified if these words were written before Paul’s letters orafter, nor do we know if Paul read them anywhere else. Surely both writers knewthat the new message resonated with an old one: “By faith we understand that theuniverse was created by the word of God, so that what is seen was not made outof things that are visible.” Thus the New Testament echoes the mystical creationof the world in Genesis—the visible world came into being through divine words:“Let there be light.”Did John intentionally echo the Old Testament? That again we cannot know. Muchis lost; much is legend. But Paul drummed one formula into his readers: believeand you will be saved. It’s not a universal formula. In the East, religions likeBuddhism and Hinduism have no murdered saints, no emphasis on faith insupernatural events, no resurrection from the dead. Instead, the common threadin the East is consciousness. A religious person seeks to escape pain andsuffering by finding a higher reality that leaves pain and suffering behind,rendering them irrelevant. The entire journey is done within, and thereforeGnosticism, or direct contact with the divine mind, finds in the East a refugewhere it isn’t a heresy.This isn’t to say that religion as it flowered in Asia lacks divine love andmiracles. In popular Buddhism the young Prince Siddhartha was carried over thewalls of his father’s palace, where he lived a life of suffocating luxury, on amagical white horse held aloft by angels. A devout Hindu sees the beautiful godKrishna as an exemplar of love. But Christianity isn’t a religion based onhigher consciousness; it is based on salvation, the ultimate personal miracle.To atheists, all miracles are primitive and childlike, a form of wishfulfillment not far removed from fairy tales. In a recent book for young adults,the British evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins, who has become the outspokenvoice of modern atheism, looks into miracles from a rational point of view. Heconcludes that they are fakery spread by charlatans, including the miraclesreported in the New Testament. Science knows how reality works, Dawkins assuresus. We need to get past myths and wish fulfillment, since they promoteunreality. It’s a powerful, persuasive attack, if you insist that only thephysical world is real and only the rational mind can deliver the truth.But the argument loses its potency once you realize that spirituality is basedon the irrational, not by being feeble and childish, but by celebrating theinner world. There are levels of the mind where rationalism cannot go. Here wefind the source of imagination, art, beauty, truth, faith, hope, love, trust,compassion, and most of the other things that make life worth living. To anatheist this sounds like a sentimental justification for believing in theunreal. However, if you look deeply, Christianity cannot help but be aboutconsciousness, despite itself.To enter the miraculous world, where ordinary people can be transformed, whereGod’s presence is felt and death loses its sting, there is no physical journey.As Kabir, one of the most inspired of India’s mystical poets, says, you can readall the holy books and bathe in all the holy waters without finding your soul.The soul is an experience, not a thing. All experiences take place inconsciousness. This is undeniable even for so-called supernatural experiences ofthe kind that atheists scorn.Whether he is loved or hated, Paul was a teacher of higher consciousness,demanding that the early church accept the resurrection, which meant accepting aworld no longer imprisoned by natural laws. We think of Christianity as beingabout the life to come, when souls join their Father in heaven. But Paul changedforever how this world looks. He led a revolution of the mind by saying thatcoming back from the dead was not just real, but the most real thing that everhappened. His stubborn insistence that God dispenses grace to the whole worldwas the same as creating a new world. In my own mind, miracles don’t causedistress. As Einstein said, either nothing is a miracle or everything is. Thatmay seem like one person’s belief system competing with countless others. YetPaul added another argument for all the mystics to come. Miraculous worlds onlyawait the touch of awareness."},{"pageContent":"4 [toc01.xhtml#cha04]Shankara [toc01.xhtml#cha04]“Life Is a Dream” [toc01.xhtml#cha04]Five old men, the village elders, had come to listen to the young stranger. Butonly one was actually listening. Two others nodded off in the sun, another wascounting his money, and the fourth had smoked too much ganja that morning andwas no longer present on earth. They were squatting in the courtyard of thelocal Shiva temple, but no priests had emerged.“You come from the south?” asked the head elder, the one who was payingattention. “They have temples there. Respectable ones,” he added.“I wasn’t driven out,” said the stranger. He waited for a question that wasn’tpointless. His accent already told that he was from the south. He wore thesaffron robes of a monk and the marks of a Brahmin—those with the highestspiritual knowledge.The elder who was counting his money stopped for a moment. “We grow our ownbeggars here. We don’t need anymore.”The elder stupefied on ganja found his tongue. “Don’t tell him where I live.”His chin fell back on his chest.The stranger sighed. Monks fell under the law of hospitality, which was sacred.But people whined about it, except in the backwaters, where superstitionlingered stronger than in the towns. In both places an unwelcome monk could bekicked from the door.“I won’t trouble anyone for food,” he murmured.He didn’t absolutely need the approval of the five elders, known as thepanchayat, but he believed in showing respect. Besides, he would be stirring uptrouble soon enough. There were always five elders in every village he came to,just as there was always a grove of five trees on the outskirts of town. Five isa holy number. Every child was taught that; no one questioned it.Shankara felt the time crawl by. “I’ve been on the road for four days. Isurvived a bandit attack to get here. I only want to speak to your priests, andthen I’ll be gone.”“Bandit attack? Why didn’t they kill you?” asked the head elder.“They seemed interested in God, so we wound up talking.” The monk gave a briefanswer, not mentioning that the bandits had bowed to him and touched his feetbefore they let him go.The head elder rocked on his heels. It was the hottest part of the day, and forawhile the monkeys quit squabbling with the parrots overhead in the trees. Theair was sultry and heavy, but the clouds on the horizon meant it would takeweeks before a proper monsoon moved in for the season. The wandering monk worehis begging bowl on his shaved head as protection from the sun.“Your father blessed this pilgrimage of yours?” asked the money-counting elder.“My father is dead. But my mother blessed me before I left. She had to,” saidthe stranger. Again he didn’t expand his answer. In fact, a tale circulatedaround his leaving. When he was bathing in the pool near his house in thevillage of Kaladi, a crocodile had seized him by the foot. The other Brahminboys screamed and jumped out of the water. His mother ran to the bank of thepool, expecting her son to already be dead, but instead he was calmly waitingfor her, the crocodile still attached.“I must die to this life,” he told her. “I know what my new life should be, andeven this savage creature knows. If you bless me, he will let me go.” The boy,who was only seven, spoke very precociously.After that, his mother had no choice. The wandering monk was eight when heturned his back on Kaladi and took to the roads, which was astonishing, even ina land where highway robbers were interested in God. If he hadn’t found refugewith gurus on the way, the boy could easily have been snatched and killed.Years passed. It was impossible to guess his age now. Fifteen, sixteen? Helooked young, but his name was well traveled. Stories about the young Shankarahad reached everyone in India.“I really do need to talk to a priest,” Shankara repeated.The truth was known but unspoken. The panchayat had assembled to greet him themoment he set foot in the village. The local priests hoped he would be bored todeath by some old men. With any luck he would move on and not confront thepriests. In eight years of wandering, in all parts of India, the stories werethat Shankara had a devastating effect in debates. Wherever he went, Godtoppled, the god that paid priests’ salaries, that is.The last village he had stopped in was like all the rest. The chief priest, bornto a specific sect in the worship of Devi, the Divine Mother, sat down to arguewith supreme confidence. He had ruled village life for decades and begun tobelieve in his own invincibility. Novel ideas didn’t frighten him, any more thana new summer crop of mosquitoes. He had tufts of gray hair on his head, withsmaller patches on his chin and sprouting from his ears.“You say that the world is an illusion?” he asked.“It doesn’t matter that I say it. The sacred Vedas declare it,” Shankarareplied.“But you claim direct knowledge. You came here to dispel illusions, didn’t you?So make the world disappear.”“All right,” Shankara nodded. “Wait until this evening when you fall asleep. Theworld will disappear, as it does every night.”The invincible priest didn’t smile, although he had to admit it was a cleveranswer. He said, “Something harder. You declare that all things, big and small,exist as in a dream.”“Yes. Just as a man wakes up from a dream to see the light of day, so he shouldwake up from the dream of this existence if he wants to see the light of God.”They were both comfortable using the word “God,” since it was understood, aftermany centuries, that each of the many images worshipped in thousands of templesall wore a face of the same divine presence.“In dreams, anything can happen,” remarked the invincible priest. “So if thislife is a dream, you must grant that anything can happen here.”“I do. Nothing is impossible for one who knows God,” Shankara replied.“Ah. The maharajah has a palace so huge that a horse would collapse beforegalloping from one end to the other. In my dreams I can have such a palace. CanI have one when I’m awake?”“I can exceed your wish. Strip off your clothes on the coldest night of theyear. Stand naked outdoors for an hour. When you run back into your warm house,it will be better than any maharajah’s palace.”The priest allowed himself a smile, which was important. Shankara could alwayscrush his opponents and wander to the next village down the Ganges, but he wasdetermined to leave goodwill behind him. He didn’t want his opponents to resentit when they lost the debate. Far better if the priests became pillars of a newbelief.The invincible priest wasn’t there yet. “I can call on a servant to run into thejungle and bring back a cobra. If I laid a poisonous snake in your lap, wouldthat be an illusion too?”“I bow to you,” Shankara replied. “You know the scriptures well. For isn’t itwritten thus: ‘To believe in this world is like a man who stumbles in the darkupon a coiled rope. Unable to see clearly, he cries “Snake! Snake!” until thewhole village is aroused. Now everyone runs around in fear until one man bringsa torch and says, “See here, it is only a rope.” That is how Maya, the goddessof illusion, works’.”“But it doesn’t prove that cobras aren’t real, unless every snake is the same asa rope,” said the invincible priest, certain that he was pouncing on a point.Shankara replied, “I was proving that only the man who brings a light knows whatis real and what isn’t.” He smiled. “Anyone who reads the scriptures grasps thepoint, doesn’t he?”The invincible priest squirmed. The wanderer had perfected the technique ofmaking his opponent accept the truth by citing texts that every Brahminsupposedly knew by heart. Isn’t that how they kept control over simple devotees,with holy words no one else could read? As he flattered the Brahmins, Shankarasubtly turned the same words around. They discovered that, like a cobra’s sting,the sting of his mind was fatal.It seems ordained that those who bring light into the world become shrouded withlegends. Shankara was walking through a village one day when a gang of boysstarted running after him throwing marigolds in his path. He asked them why.“We want you to step on one,” an older boy replied, although even he was quiteshy.“Step on one?”“You are a sidha, a master of supernatural powers. If you step on a flower, wecan sell it to heal the sick.”“Who told you such a thing?” Shankara demanded.The boys were confused and intimidated, but between them they told a tale theyhad heard about the sidha standing before them.Shankara had taken a master by the name of Govinda, who lived in a cave by thesacred river Narmada. As was the custom, the disciple waited on the master,acting as his personal servant. Every morning Shankara would leave food beforethe mouth of the cave for his master’s breakfast. One day, however, the riveroverflowed its banks, threatening Govinda’s cave and the surroundingcountryside.Shankara prayed for guidance, after which he rushed to the cave and placed hissmall clay water pot in front. Immediately the pot swallowed up the flood, untilGod ordered the Narmada to return to its banks, for the flood had actually beena test of the young sidha’s powers.The boys’ eyes were shining as they retold the tale. Instead of scolding them,he obligingly stepped on a few marigolds, reminding himself to return when theboys had grown into men, so that he could give them something more useful thanlegends—although it isn’t recorded that he ever contradicted the tale.When he arrived in a new place, asking to debate the most learned men, theBrahmins usually made the mistake of underestimating him at first. He was thinas a reed, for one thing, and when you’re peddling wisdom, it’s better to be fatas well as old. If someone pointed this out, Shankara would say that he didn’twin by sitting on his opponents, only by persuading them. Of what? He shrugged.The truth.“Isn’t it arrogant for a stranger to come here and claim to know the truth?” hisopponents argued.“Ignorance is more arrogant,” Shankara replied. “It claims to blind all men anderase what is real from their minds.” He lowered his eyes. “Not that such athing has happened here.”On this day Shankara and the five elders had been meeting for an hour. Shankaraheard his stomach rumble. The one who kept questioning him was stubborn. Henever ran out of questions, and each one grew more trivial. The wandering monkcouldn’t hide his impatience any longer.“How much?” he asked.“What?”“How much were you paid to waste my time? Before you pretend to be outraged,I’ll say one thing. I’m not here to destroy your faith.”The head village elder had worn a tolerant expression up until this moment; itvanished. “They say you topple God. We can’t permit that.”“I see, so God needs you to protect him? I’m impressed. I’ve now met someonemore powerful than God himself.”The words were meant to sting, and they did. The head elder rose and gestured tothe others. “I’m not so impressed,” he said. “I’ve met someone who thinks God isdeaf and blind. But you’re wrong. He hears profanity, and he punishes it.”Shankara stood up and moved in on the old man. “Is that why I’m stuck talking toyou, because God is punishing me?”The old man’s face reddened, but Shankara didn’t wait for a spluttering reply.He raised his arms and addressed the empty courtyard. “I was told to come here.This is a marketplace, they told me. The peddlers of faith set up their stallshere. So where are you, peddlers? Come, sell me some faith if you think I havenone.”From inside the temple there was no answer to his challenge, only the faint buzzof chanting. The priests were obligated to perform rituals almost without pauseas long as the sun was up and several times during the night.“Have it your way,” Shankara shouted. “When I get to the next village, I willbring the news that this is the home where ignorance loves to dwell. It has madeits devotees too frightened to talk to me.”A sharp ear would have detected a change in the buzzing that issued from thesacred chamber inside the temple; now it was more like wasps than prayers. Aftera moment a priest appeared at the door. He held the implements of ritual in hishand—smoking incense, a bowl of water, some marigolds—as if he could barelyspare a moment.“Don’t scold me,” Shankara addressed him. “The rumors about me are wrong. I’mnot here to topple God. My words won’t crack the temple walls.”“Like all words, yours will vanish into thin air,” said the priest, who wastwice the age of the intruder, with a brow as heavy as his scowl.“Some words penetrate the heart,” said Shankara, more mildly.In a child’s tale he would have had to slay the demons that blocked his way, butShankara wielded a secret weapon. He charmed people, even when they thought thatthey should resist him. The priest’s scowl didn’t melt yet, much less his heart.But he didn’t call a servant with a switch either.“We are both Brahmins,” said Shankara. “I come from a family that gave almsevery day and performed the rites of puja, propitiating Shiva as you do. Irespect our way of life, which was dictated by God. I respect you.”The priest gave a slight nod.“As I look at you, I think you are the wisest man in this village,” saidShankara. “If so, please sit and debate with me. If not, send the man who isconsidered by everyone to be wiser than you.”He knew that he had caught the priest in a trap, his own vanity.“If you respect me as a Brahmin,” the priest said, hesitating unless he steppedfarther into the trap, “then you see that I am busy doing my duty right now.” Hebrandished the ritual implements. “Why should I interrupt holy work for idlearguments?”“Because you need to see for yourself if God speaks through me. That’s whatyou’ve heard, isn’t it? That my words are divine.”The priest lost his composure. “Outrageous!”“Why?” said Shankara. “Isn’t it held that the first words came from God? Are notwords the agent of reason? Therefore, if I speak to you with sound reasons,aren’t they from God? Otherwise, we would have to say that I speak for thedemons.”“Always a possibility,” interjected the head village elder. It was a lot oftrouble to cleanse a holy place after a demon infested it.Shankara smiled. “Even then, since all things are made of God, even the demonshave divine nature once you pierce their disguise. So come, sit. Either you willhear the voice of God or you will have your chance to defeat a demon, and a verythin, poor one at that. He would be grateful for a chapati and a cup of freshwater.”In the eight years since he left home, Shankara had repeated this scene hundredsof times, ever since his own guru, on the banks of the sacred Narmada River, hadsent him on his mission.This priest was craftier than most. “It would take too long for me to tell youhow I serve God,” he said. “But there is a villager, a householder, who lives alife of perfect devotion. I taught him every lesson. Go to his house, and if hisdevotion crumbles before your arguments, return to me.”The priest gave a flick of the wrist, which sent a servant to fetch bread andwater for the intruding stranger. Personally, the priest had no use forwandering monks: half of them were crazy and the other half criminals indisguise. But Brahmin to Brahmin, he couldn’t refuse hospitality.After the priest went back inside, the village elders relaxed, pleased with thisoutcome. They watched Shankara eat, which he only did after the requiredblessings.“Your priest is clever,” said Shankara, “which he mistakes for being wise.”“Why do you insult someone who offers you food?” exclaimed the head elder.“Am I insulting him? I thought he insulted me, because he portrays me as someonewho is willing to attack a devout man’s faith. If he keeps his faith, I mustwalk away as the loser in the debate,” replied Shankara.The elders smiled, since they saw very well what the priest’s tactics were.“How will I find this householder of perfect devotion?” Shankara asked.“His name is Mandana Mishra. You’ll have no trouble finding where he lives. Hekeeps six parrots caged at the gate to his house. They argue philosophy all dayand make quite a noise.” As Shankara was sent on his way, he could hear the snickers of the panchayatbehind him. He continued down the road until he spied the caged parrots, whosquawked a warning when he approached. If they had philosophical things to say,they kept them to themselves. On the porch of the house a man was performingritual offerings. Shankara knelt beside him, bowing with his forehead to thefloor. Mandana Mishra sprinkled water to the four points of the compass,muttering a prayer. It took several minutes before he acknowledged that anyonewas there.“Apologies for interrupting your devotions,” murmured Shankara.“There is no sin,” replied Mandana smoothly. “A guest at the door is God. We aretaught that this is more important than daily prayers.”He showed Shankara into the house and ordered his wife to bring refreshments,which she did silently. One look around told the story. Mandana Mishrasurrounded himself with images of the gods. The altar for puja was lit with adozen ghee lamps; the air was heavy with the mixed smell of incense, burntbutter, and ashes. When Shankara explained why he was there, Mandana beamed. Hewas thrilled to be offered as an example of perfect devotion.Shankara said, “We cannot debate without a referee. We could send for the highpriest, but I want the severest referee possible. Would you agree to let it beyour wife?”The couple stared at each other, startled.Shankara went on. “In a household like this, where God means everything, thewife must be as wise as the husband. If she says that he has been defeated, noone can dispute her. The last thing a wife would want is to see her husbandlose.”The couple agreed, and Shankara sat cross-legged on the floor opposite hisopponent; Mandana’s wife, Ubhaya, sat to one side .“Words are empty unless something valuable is at stake,” said Shankara. “Whatshall we wager?”Mandana smiled. “We are both too poor to wager much. I can offer a handful ofrice, but you have nothing.”“We have both given up any hope of riches,” Shankara agreed. “But we ownsomething more precious. Let’s wager our path to God. If you win, I will stayhere and become a householder, following your lead in every ritual and prayer.If I win, you will follow me and become sanyasi, a wandering monk.”Husband and wife hesitated a long moment, but in the end the wager was accepted.Shankara was courteously allowed to set the topic of the first debate; he chosefaith.“I was sent here to test your faith,” he began. “But I don’t need to, for I seethat your faith is like a cart with no wheels. It would be pitiful to challengeit.” He saw the offended look on Mandana Mishra’s pious face. “I’m being kind totell you this. A cart is only good if it can take you to market or haul in yourcrops. Faith is the same. It is meant to carry you to God. But if you bow downand perform empty rituals all day without finding God, you might as well bowdown to a broken-down cart.”Mandana raised his hand. “The scriptures command us to show our faith throughthese rituals you dismiss, and the scriptures come from God. Are you saying thatGod can be untrue?”“Why do the scriptures command you to pray?” asked Shankara.“It is not for me to question that.”“Because it would show a lack of faith,” said Shankara, finishing Mandana’sthought for him. “This is false reasoning, for, like a dog chasing its tail, yousay that one must have faith in faith. Give me a reason why.”“God is beyond reasoning,” declared Mandana.“If that were true, then any jumble of words could be called scripture. Nonsensewould be divine if all that is needed is lack of reason. Madmen would be betterthan priests.”“This is just trickery,” Mandana shot back. “Scripture cannot be denied.”“Oh, so the dog has found a second tail to chase. Now scripture is right becauseit is scripture. If that were true, then I could slip lies into the holy booksof the Veda and they would turn true simply because of where I put them.”Mandana’s wife became alarmed, sensing that her husband was on shaky ground.“Tell him from your heart why we all need faith,” she urged.Mandana nodded meekly. “You are right, my dear. A faith that doesn’t come fromthe heart is no faith at all.” He gazed benignly at Shankara. “Faith is the dutyof every man, because we are put here to lead a good life in God’s eyes. Youcan’t persuade me not to be good. Faith is my bargain with God. If I obey hisword, then when I die I will be liberated. The cycle of birth and rebirth willend, and with that, all suffering ends.”“So faith will make you immortal and bring you into the presence of God?” saidShankara. “It sounds ridiculous. A murderer could practice piety, and by yourargument, when he dies he only has to cry, ‘God, I believed in you. Liberate me,for what is one sin when I have so much faith?’”“A murderer?” said Mandana. “You can’t equate such a sin with the life of a goodman.”“So being a good man means being without sin? If you are without sin, my dearopponent, don’t bother with faith. You are God already,” Shankara replied. “Askyourself, why is this life full of suffering? Because men are ignorant of thetruth. How does it serve God to have the faith of ignorant men? If you needed ahouse to be built, would you say, ‘Send me only those workers who have neverbuilt a house?’ It’s the last thing God wants.”Mandana shook his head. “You can’t equate faith with ignorance. There are wisemen who have faith. I imagine that you are one of them, or have you lost yourfaith by becoming so wise?”Shankara looked pleased; he wasn’t debating a dolt. “The faith of the wise isdifferent from the faith of the ignorant,” he said.“Then grant me that mine is the faith of the wise,” Mandana shot back.“I can’t.”“Why not? Can you set eyes on me and instantly see whether I am wise or not?”“I don’t need to. I will prove your ignorance to you. Let’s say you met a manwho is selling amalaki fruit. You pay him, but instead of putting your fruit ina sack, he takes a scoop of air and, pretending it’s fruit, puts it into thesack. When you protest that he is handing you air, he says, ‘Have faith. Thereis amalaki in that sack.’ What would you say to that?”“You know what I would say.”“I do. You’d say he was a cheat. So is the faith of the ignorant a cheat. Theypay for it. They eat it and say that it’s sweet. But what nourishment is there?None. How much suffering do they avoid? Very little. On the other hand, thefaith of the wise is pure sweetness and nourishes the soul. How? By taking youwhere faith is meant to go. Faith is another word for hope. We have faith thatGod is real, because it is our dearest hope. I may hope for a child to be bornto me, but until the child is born, hope flutters on the windowsill like acandle. It signals to God, but is not the same as reaching God.“What does it take to actually reach God? Two things, knowledge and experience.The scriptures give us knowledge. We are told how to worship, how to perform ourduties in leading a good life. More than this, we learn how to go inward to findthe spark, the essence of God that is inside us. It is our source. Suchknowledge, though, is only half the path. The other half is experience. Whatgood does it serve you to know that a rose has a beautiful scent when you havenever smelled one?“Mandana Mishra, your house is full of hope for God, as an empty vase is full ofhope for roses. Yet you can have the experience, and then your hope will befulfilled. God wants to be felt, seen, touched. He is lonely sitting apart fromus. In finding God you find your own essence. Life exists for no other reason.Know that God is your self. At that moment you will awaken to eternity.”This exchange was only the beginning. For twelve days the villagers didn’t layeyes on Mandana and his wife. They peered in at their window to see if thewandering monk had done something terrible to the most devout man in thevillage. All anyone could see, whether by the light of day or candles at night,were the two debaters sitting facing each other on the floor.As dawn rose on the thirteenth day, Ubhaya began to weep. All three of them wereexhausted. Mandana had run out of arguments and resorted to repeating himself,mumbling feebly with heavily lidded eyes as sleep overtook him.“It’s no use,” said Ubhaya mournfully. She was ready to declare Shankara thewinner, even though it meant seeing her husband leave to become a sanyasi.Before she could render judgment, however, Shankara raised his hand. “There isno victory unless I defeat your husband, but according to scripture, the wife ishalf of the husband. So let me debate you before you tell me I’ve won.”Ubhaya was astonished, but she grasped at this straw. Everything that MandanaMishra knew about God she also knew, but she had more wits about her.“Does God want a man to have a worse life for believing in him?” she began.“No. God is our own nature. He can only want the best for each person,” Shankarareplied.“If that’s true, how is it the best for my husband to become a monk? As ahouseholder he gives alms, while a monk begs for them. A householder keeps thesacred fire burning; a monk shivers in the rain. On the road Mandana would faceall kinds of dangers. You barely escaped death yourself, or so you say,”declared Ubhaya.“You speak of danger to his body. It’s not the body that finds God or loseshim,” said Shankara.“I know my husband. He is meek. He will crawl from village to village in fear.Who can find God when he is constantly afraid?”“Fear can be an incentive too. When you realize that fear is born of duality,you long to go where fear is banished,” said Shankara. He was reciting a holyverse that Ubhaya would know. “You are a devout woman; your husband is humblebefore God. Yet look inside. Aren’t you afraid that you may take one wrong stepand then God will crush you?”“Are you deliberately frightening me?” she asked.“No. It isn’t by being more afraid that anyone conquers fear,” said Shankara.When Ubhaya looked away without reply, Shankara went on. “The world is dividedbecause we are divided inside. In everyone the same thing is happening. Goodwars against evil, light against dark. How can anyone find peace in such astate?”“I was at peace before you came to our door,” said Ubhaya.“It was the peace of one who is sleeping. A prisoner who is about to be beheadedin the morning can find the same peace if he manages to fall asleep.”“But if the world is created out of good and evil, that can’t be called anillusion,” argued Ubhaya. “It’s the will of God, who made the world that way.”“You are speaking what most people believe,” Shankara conceded. “But reality isslippery. A baby cries with rage if his mother takes away her breast. That ishis idea of evil. A little boy playing in the fields will hate another littleboy who throws a rock at him. That is his idea of evil. A Buddhist monk willwait by the side of the road holding out his begging bowl, and a passing Hinduwill spit on him. That is his idea of evil.”“Yet for all of them, evil is real,” said Ubhaya.“Are you so sure? Experience whirls around our heads like a swarm of flies. Butthere can be flies in a dream too. They are just as pesky; if they bite, ithurts and we see blood. But when you wake from the dream, your skin isuntouched, and you know that the swarm of flies was an illusion. It took placein your mind.”Shankara swatted at the air, which always had a fly or two buzzing aroundbecause of the sweet smell of offered fruit. “What makes these flies real? Yoursenses, because you see them and hear them buzzing. But they would be like fliesin a dream if you woke up. That’s the only difference. You know how to wake upfrom your dreams at night, but you haven’t learned yet how to wake up from thisworld. You asked me if God wants the best for us. He does, and the best is towake up completely.”Ubhaya, who was genuinely devout, felt moved. But her panic over losing herhusband was stronger.“If Mandana follows you, will you become his guru?” she asked.Shankara nodded.“And a guru knows everything necessary to remove darkness?”Shankara nodded again.“But you are sorely lacking,” said Ubhaya, raising her voice, “because you knownothing of how men and women live together.”It was the first time Shankara was taken aback. “I know they love one another,and God has shown me infinite love.”“Men and women also lie together. What do you know of that? If you want to stealMandana from my bed, how do you know that you haven’t deprived him of greatbliss? And for what, a promise that you can lead the way to a higher world? Youthink it’s higher because a woman has never shown you any differently.”It was a brazen speech. Shankara blushed and lowered his eyes. “I swore to becelibate. Whatever you are offering, it’s impossible for me to accept.”Ubhaya laughed softly. “You say that it takes experience to realize God. Yetwhen this experience comes near, you run away. If you are so easily routed, whyshould my husband trust his life to you?” Ubhaya was an honest woman, but shecould barely keep herself from stroking Shankara’s cheek if it meant that shemight win.He backed away, saying, “God wouldn’t deny me anything, and if this experienceis missing, the fault is mine. Give me eight days.”Ubhaya’s heart leapt with hope. “You intend to learn the art of loving a womanin eight days? All right, but if you experience bliss, you must admit defeat.”She stopped, knowing that Shankara had set a trap for himself. If he slept witha woman, he would be breaking his vows as a monk. It would be a sin for Mandanato follow him, no matter how clever his arguments were.Instead of getting up to leave, Shankara said, “I will sit here and not move. Nomatter what happens, see to the welfare of my body. Keep it warm. Protect itfrom harm, and pour water into my mouth when it gets dry.”Although they were startled, Mandana and his wife agreed. For the next eightdays Shankara sat with his eyes closed. He didn’t respond to sounds, and whenhis mouth was opened to pour water into it, he remained as motionless as acorpse. Finally, on the eighth day, he stirred.“I am ready,” he said, opening his eyes.“For what?” asked Ubhaya, suspecting a trick. “If you imagined the delights ofthe bed, that is more of an illusion than anything.”He shook his head. “I begged God to experience the love between a man and awoman without breaking my vows. You saw my body in this room, but I wasn’t here.I was taken to the palace where the maharajah enjoys his many wives. For eightdays I was inside his body. He is a vigorous lover, and his wives are skilled inevery art. I have returned with all the experience you mocked me for nothaving.”Ubhaya felt the ground give beneath her. “If that’s true, then you experiencedtender, all-consuming bliss. In the throes of love, nothing else matters. If Godwants the best for us, name something better than this.”Shankara replied, “After he made love, the maharajah was exhausted and hisspirits dulled. He was listless, like a man without a mind. His bliss sharplycame to an end. I won’t speak of the other problems of the bed, the jealousyamong his wives, the fear that he would one day lose his powers, the suspicionthat women didn’t really love him but put on a show. But God offers bliss thatis unending. It neither comes nor goes. Where I shall take Mandana, the fruitsof divine love will make him forget the bedroom forever.”Suddenly Ubhaya wailed and threw herself at Shankara’s feet. “I can’t bear tolose him! Why would God give my husband eternal bliss only to throw me into thegreatest pain?”Shankara replied gently. “The pain is not from losing your husband; it is fromlosing yourself. In this world the path of pleasure leads everyone to run aftertheir desires. You have been fortunate. You could have been pursued by a man whowound up beating you or betraying you with another. Wisdom looks beyond today’shappiness. Tomorrow Mandana’s love could turn to indifference or even hate.Emotions are fickle. He could wither and fall sick; you might die in abjectpoverty. Knowing this, wisdom rescues us. It restores us to our true self, andwith that, fear is banished. For as long as you are subject to pain, fear isyour ruler.”Ubhaya bowed her head and let her husband go. They wept when they parted, and helooked back many times before she saw his figure disappear in the distance. Itwas the custom for a sanyasito take on a new name when he renounced his oldlife. Mandana took the name of Suresvara. Wherever Shankara went, he followed;the years melted away and then there was a great shock. The master died at acruelly young age, only thirty-two. They were staying in a village that barelyappears on the map. Shankara felt feverish; the next morning he didn’t wake up.By this time there were many disciples, and a crowd followed the body to theghat where it was burned to ashes. Suresvara saw to it that the ashes werescattered over the river with a hundred floating lamps surrounding them, likestars gathering to mourn the sun after it goes out. The disciples scattered tothe four winds. Shankara had foreseen this. He established four great centerswhere wisdom would be preserved until the end of time.When young monks were presented to Suresvara, who became eminent as a guardianof truth, they were looked upon kindly, but with a little pity. It would take alifetime to absorb the teachings of Shankara. To keep up their courage,Suresvara told a simple story.“I was walking with Master when we came upon a filthy man in the road, anuntouchable, and I rushed ahead, shouting, ‘Get out of the way! A Brahmin iscoming.’ Not for anything would I have Master’s body be tainted by contact withan untouchable.“But Master raised his hand and said, ‘Who is supposed to step aside? If it isthis man’s body, you know that the body is unreal. If it is his true self, whichis infinite, how can he move anywhere? He already fills all of creation.’ Andwith that, Master fell to the ground and bowed before the untouchable.”Suresvara recounted this incident, because he remembered how he wept when ithappened and how shocked he was at the same time, as shocked as the newcomerswere when they heard the story. Untouchables were still despised; that was arigid custom, the way society was set up. Wisdom would have to wait.When Suresvara grew old, he lay on his deathbed and regretted only one thing,the fate of his wife, Ubhaya. His own life had reached eternal bliss; he had nofear of not being liberated. Yet this one hurt pinched at his soul. He breathedhis last. The room where he lay vanished, the four walls melting like smoke. Hefound himself in the high Himalayas, alone, with snowflakes pelting his face.In the distance a small speck appeared, and after awhile Suresvara saw that itwas someone on foot, walking in his direction. In a few moments a hoodedtraveler approached him. He removed his hood, but it wasn’t a man. It wasUbhaya, looking exactly as she did the day they were married.Suresvara quaked and sobbed, “Can you forgive me?”“What was best was best,” she replied.“But not for you,” cried Suresvara.“Shall I throw off my cloak and show you what I was reduced to?” she asked. Henodded, afraid to see her ravaged body and the rags she must be wearing.In the driving storm Ubhaya dropped her coarse wool cloak, but she wasn’tdressed in rags. Her body was pure light, more blinding than the white snow thatswirled around her. She was revealed as no mortal woman, but the goddessSaraswati. Suresvara reached to touch her hem, and at that instant they bothdisappeared. Bliss melted into bliss. He had used his life for the one thingthat matters most. The high peaks looked on and rejoiced.Revealing the VisionIn the East, God didn’t evolve as he did in the West. There is no punishingYahweh, no biblical prophets, no redeeming Christ. Without those threeingredients, God’s nature could follow entirely different lines. It is only byaccident that the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are three, and so is the Indianconception of Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva. But the fact that three gods areresponsible for creating, maintaining, and destroying the universe scandalizedWesterners when they first encountered India, for the same reason that they werescandalized in China, Japan, and other parts of Asia. “The gods” meant paganism;the benighted souls of Asia needed to be converted to “God,” the one and only.The charge of paganism is still leveled at the East, but with a twist. Withenough force, you can conquer a country and make conversion to God mandatory,upon penalty of death. But in Asia people shrugged off the difference betweenGod and the gods. They had been taught that material life was maya, an illusionof the senses. It hardly mattered if the illusion contained one God or manygods. When the scales fell away from their eyes, people would see the luminousreality that lies behind the veil of appearances. As their life mission, thegreat sages of India, China, and Japan gave directions for how to escape thebondage of illusion, which brought pain and suffering with it. If Christ taughtthat this vale of tears ended in heaven, Shankara taught that suffering endedwith enlightenment. Since both paths eventually lead into the light, would Jesusand Shankara have seriously disagreed if they had faced each other in a debate?That would have been a purely hypothetical question for Westerners arriving inIndia three hundred years ago. Most paid no attention to Eastern spirituality,since it was all dismissed as paganism. But when it was examined, the teachingthat life is a dream seemed like dubious metaphysics or else poetic licensetaken to extremes. There are times when all of us feel as if we are walkingthrough a dream. Some of these are happy times—as for a bride on her weddingday—others are tragic—as for survivors in the aftermath of an earthquake. Atrancelike moment could easily be a slipup in the brain or a lapse of focus. Buttwelve centuries ago, Shankara declared that our entire life is spent notunderstanding reality. What we take to be real is a walking dream, one fromwhich we must awake.Shankara was not trying to make people feel that their lives were worthless,though. He held that once awake, having freed ourselves from illusion, we couldmaster reality. His arguments were so powerful that he conquered all comers indebates that ranged the entire length and breadth of India.This is a topic that shouldn’t be restricted to antique debating contests or thesometimes bloody religious conflicts between East and West. Practical things areat stake—life and death, in fact. In one place Shankara writes, “People grow oldand die, because they see other people grow old and die.” Outrageous? Not iflife is created from awareness like a dream, for when you encounter any badevent in a dream, it vanishes as soon as you wake up. In a dream, if youcontract cancer, you could be just as frightened as if you were awake. But if itcomes naturally to dismiss dream cancer as an illusion, why are we trapped inwaking cancer?The modern-day South Indian guru Nisargadatta Maharaj was confronted with thisdilemma once when a student asked him how to overcome the fear of death. Thisstudent was in great fear of mortality and urgently wanted an answer.“Your problem,” Nisargadatta replied, “is that you think you were born. Whateveris born must die, and this knowledge gives rise to fear. But why do you acceptthat you were born? Because your parents told you so, and you believed them,just as they believed their parents. Look inside. Try to imagine nonexistence.You cannot, hard as you try. That’s because reality lies beyond birth and death.Realize this truth, and your fear of death will be no more.”The logic is impeccable and suspicious at the same time. What makes itsuspicious can be stated quite simply. If you spend a day at the beach, soakingup the sun, idly watching other people, and occasionally cooling off in the sea,everything seems real; the hours pass and events occur. If you did the samething in a dream, a day at the beach might take only a few moments as measuredby brain activity. Once you woke up, you would realize that your day at thebeach was an illusion because it all happened inside your consciousness.Shankara is saying that your “real” day at the beach also takes place inconsciousness. Physically, this fact is undeniable. All experience is mediatedby the brain. You cannot see, smell, hear, touch, or taste anything without theappropriate brain activity. If you view a rainbow, your visual cortex is at workwhether the rainbow is seemingly “in here” as part of a dream or “out there” aspart of the real world. We cannot prove that the rainbow “out there” exists onits own. Shankara says that it doesn’t. To him, all external things areexperiences in consciousness, and the ultimate consciousness, the beginning andend of everything, is a universal, absolute consciousness we can call God.It might seem that Shankara is reducing everything to the subjective. Actually,he is raising awareness above crude facts. Experience is far richer than thedata that science uses to explain things. In a court of law you cannotobjectively prove that chocolate is delicious or why you feel that the woman youlove is the most beautiful in the world. Yet that hardly matters. Onlyconsciousness can explain consciousness. What we experience is real for us,uniquely and mysteriously. To someone with agoraphobia, a fear of open spaces,it doesn’t matter that open spaces are harmless or that going outside is apleasure for most people. To the phobic person, anxiety is anxiety. Shankara issaying that consciousness is self-sufficient. It creates the world, as a sleepercreates a dream. The problem is that we have forgotten that we are such powerfulcreators. Shankara invites us to remember again.We could veer into a long discussion about science here, because science dependsentirely upon objective facts. Subjectivity is considered unreliable, wayward,and far too personal. But after all the arguing, we only wind up in Shankara’sclutches, because modern science has deposed the physical world entirely, whichis his main point. Quantum physics has reduced the physical world to anillusion. Atoms, the building blocks of the material universe, are not solid,tiny objects. They are a whirl of energy that is invisible and has no physicalproperties like weight or solidity. In turn, this energy winks in and out ofexistence, returning to the void that is the origin of the cosmos thousands oftimes a second. In the void there is no time or space, no matter or energy.There is only the potential for those things—so what is potential?To Shankara, along with the ancient Vedic sages in his spiritual tradition, thecreative potential that gives rise to everything in creation can’t be physical.This includes the creative potential in everyday life. Let’s say that youdiscover that your four-year-old child is a musical prodigy or an extraordinarymath whiz. As the days go by, his or her potential unfolds step-by-step, and youwitness the flowering of a talent that began as a mysterious, invisible seed.When potential unfolds, it’s not like a bag of sugar that you steadily empty.The more sugar in the bag, the more you can pour out. But there is nothingphysical stored somewhere giving rise to more and more creativity. Instead, aninvisible potential (such as musicality or a knack for numbers) finds a way toemerge into the physical world.God has done the same thing. According to Shankara, the only God that couldexist is not a person, even a vast, superhuman person, but something invisibleand yet alive, a kind of infinite potential that can create, govern, control,and bring to fruition everything that exists. This God cannot be limited;therefore, he cannot be described. Not that “he” or “she” or even “it” iscorrect. No single quality can define God, who like the air we breathe is mixedinto every cell without being detectable. Imagine that you hand a yellow tulipto someone who has no knowledge of genetics, and you say, “What makes thisflower yellow isn’t yellow. What makes it soft, shiny, and pliable has none ofthose qualities. It doesn’t sprout in spring or grow from a bulb.” The claimsounds preposterous until you understand the path that leads from a gene to aflower. In Shankara’s world, all paths lead from God, and all are inconsciousness.To name this all-pervasive source, the Indian spiritual tradition uses severalsuggestive labels. Brahman is the most all-inclusive, since it means “all thatexists,” derived from the root word for “big.” To get at the impersonal mysteryof God, the term tat, or “that,” is used. When someone becomes enlightened,three great realizations, or awakenings, are involved, like three stages ofwaking up in the morning. The first is “I am that.” I am not a self bound by abody and trapped in the brief space between birth and death. I am made of thesame essence as God. What is that essence? It can’t be put into words. It is“that.” This is a highly personal experience, as all epiphanies are. ButShankara isn’t bothered by the subjectivity of such an astonishing revelation.To stub your toe on a rock is just as personal, just as subjective, and just asmuch a product of consciousness.The second awakening occurs when the divine is seen in someone else. “I am that”expands into “You are that.” This widening continues until the whole world isconsumed, leading to the third awakening, “All of this is that.” Once the entireworld is experienced as divine, one enters the state of unity consciousness.There is nothing that is not yourself, in its pure essence.Shankara was established in unity consciousness; that is his claim toenlightenment. Can such a state be faked? Are there judges who can validate thatit exists? Skeptics pose such questions because they don’t accept the firstpremise of the Indian spiritual tradition, which is that consciousness is all.By accepting materialism instead—the doctrine that all things and events havephysical causes—we can agree on all kinds of things. Rocks are solid. Fireburns. Pleasure is different from pain. You and I have a stake in such a world,so we don’t question it. Shankara declares that you must stop having a stake inthe world, and when you do, you will be set free. Rid of fear and worry, totallyat home in the world, you become a child of the universe, liberated into a stateof complete openness with whatever comes your way.But what if you are the martyred Giordano Bruno, the Italian friar killed bycivil authorities in 1600 after the Roman Inquisition found him guilty ofheresy, and what comes your way is seven years of torture before you are burnedat the stake? Dreams can turn into nightmares, after all. What is the true wayto escape? Bruno could not, for all his brilliance and insight. There are twoanswers to this predicament. You can either wake up from this dream called lifeor you can master it. Here we touch on the human face of God. God forces nothingand expects nothing. Captivated by maya, or illusion, people have devised anangry, punishing, judgmental deity. You can devote a lifetime—or countlesscenturies—to pleasing such a God and end up empty-handed. You can spend the samelifetime defying God and still not escape life’s pain.But if God is pure potential, things change radically. Potential is infinitelyflexible. A God of potentiality doesn’t need to be obeyed, feared, or placated.He exists to unfold anything and everything. Our agonies arise because we do notrealize the divine potential in ourselves, which can alter our fate. If yourealize this fact, you may seek only to wake up from the horrors of the dream.In that case, your goal will be to return to the light, where total peace andcomplete absence of pain exist.Or you could decide to fulfill your divine potential here and now. In that case,God becomes much more human. He embodies all love, all creativity, all the goodpossibilities in life. With this realization, you don’t seek to return to thelight. Instead, you master the dream, a poetic way of saying that you expandyour consciousness. Expansion is how false boundaries are dissolved.Psychologists recognize a kind of ultrarealistic dream state, known as luciddreaming, that cannot be distinguished from being awake. While having a luciddream, you are there, fully, with all five senses operating. Then comes thefirst hint of waking up. Perhaps you are immersed in a jungle adventure runningfrom a tiger. You feel its hot breath on your neck when suddenly the faintestnotion occurs: this is just a dream. At the same time, you know that no one madethe dream but yourself, which is why it holds no danger.Shankara describes a permanent state that is very similar, in which you fullyparticipate in the world, but you faintly know that you are dreaming. This stateof so-called witnessing is the Vedic version of what Jesus names as being in theworld, but not of it. It’s a very desirable state, because you become creativeinstead of passive. Poised on that edge before you wake up from your jungleadventure, you know that the dream belongs to you. Suddenly you are an author.Some lucid dreamers can even reenter their dream, willing themselves not to wakeup. They can do this because they are, after all, the authors of their dream.In the same way, you are the author of your life. It may seem that all kinds ofoutside factors hem you in and deny your authorship: disease, aging, the forcesof nature, social rules and strictures, and ultimately death. But Shankara asksa simple question that explodes these external limitations: Has anything thatever happened in a dream actually hurt you? When you wake up, the whole dream isgone. Tigers, angels, demons, pursuing enemies, and voluptuous lovers. All sharethe same unreality.Mastering the dream is good news and bad news at the same time. The good news isthat you are the true author of your life, with the capacity to make anythinghappen. To arrive at mastery takes time. There are cautionary tales, like thereckless, unfortunate Giordano Bruno, who saw the light, but did not escape thedream. Shankara outlines how to undergo the process of mastery, using all thetools of Yoga. These tools are all about consciousness. They teach you how touse your mind instead of allowing your mind to use you.The bad news? It’s not the prospect of failure. Once the process of awakeningbegins, it is unstoppable, even if you have to cross into new lifetimes to reachyour goal. The bad news is that mastering the dream isn’t like being Midas. Youwon’t turn everything you touch into gold. The lure of riches, endless pleasure,power, and even saintliness starts to fade once you know that it’s all a dream.Unity consciousness is the ultimate mastery known to the world’s spiritualtraditions, but it cannot be described in worldly terms. When the two domains ofreality, “in here” and “out there,” finally merge, a new existence dawns. It isindescribable before you reach it, which is why there’s another saying thatShankara’s tradition insists upon: “Those who know It speak of it not; those whospeak of It know it not.”Making God disappear from the physical world is either a sign of progress,because it removes the self-centered belief that the deity must look and actlike a human being, or it is a scandal, just as it was to the first Westerners,because you can’t just wipe God away like that. He will notice, and his reactionwon’t be pleasant. What is liberation in the East remains heresy to many in theWest. The only certainty is that God has more faces to show. Matters are notsettled yet by any means."},{"pageContent":"5 [toc01.xhtml#cha05]Rumi [toc01.xhtml#cha05]“Come with Me, My Beloved” [toc01.xhtml#cha05]Defendants. Why don’t they know when to quit?“I didn’t beat my wife, Your Honor.”“How did she get those bruises, then?”“I was holding a stick and she ran into it.”Silence is blessed to a man of virtue. The Prophet, peace be upon him, wasfamous for his silence. When the men sat around the fire to sing and recitepoems in the desert, he sat tongue-tied in the dark, hoping not to be noticed.Then Allah sent an angel to speak through him. Gabriel touched his soul, andwith one word—“ Recite!”—the Prophet was filled with God’s truth. He surrenderedto the miracle, even when the voice of God made him quake with fear.In court it helped to think about miracles. The room stank of guilt anddesperation. The next defendant would be like the first, armed with a tongue ofbrass.“Your brother came in on you sleeping with his wife.”“It was the coldest night of the year. If I didn’t lie on top of her, she wouldhave frozen to death.”The court had no choice but to find the lot of them guilty. Not that theplaintiffs were satisfied. The next town over had twice as many thieves withtheir hands cut off. It was ages since anyone could remember a public execution.“Am I interrupting, Your Honor?”The qadi, or judge, blinked his eyes; he must have dozed off from boredom andthe heat of the day. The air was stifling. There was no jury. The trialconsisted of both parties arguing their case, without lawyers or prosecutors.But this qadi liked to be backed up by devout jurists who sat to advise him.They were half asleep too. The plaintiff coughed in his hand, delaying to makesure that somebody was paying attention.“There can be no doubt about the facts,” he said, raising his voice as if thecourtroom was packed with awed listeners. “Abdullah al-Ibrahim ran over his wifewith an oxcart. She was my daughter Aisha. Her ribs were crushed, and she diedin agony three days later.”A wail arose from the hapless defendant; this one, at least, was speechless. Sofar he had cowered abjectly, crouching on the floor without a word. He wassixty. The dead woman was barely twenty.One of the qadi’s jurists raised his hand. It was Jalal al-Din Muhammad.“May I ask our brother a question?”The judge nodded; the dead wife’s father frowned. Convictions went through thefloor when Jalal intervened. He was mild and kept to himself, a scholar. Heshould have stayed where he belonged, nodding over the law by candlelight.People knew why Jalal sat at trials. So he wouldn’t seem like a nobody, hisenemies sneered. Strangely, everyone among his enemies had land and gold, andthey spent a great part of the winter, when the fields lay fallow, bringinglawsuits.Jalal rose and approached the cowering defendant. It was fairly outrageous howhe called criminals “our brother” and placed his hand on their shoulders.“How many fingers am I holding up?” he said. He raised four fingers, standing nomore than a yard from the defendant.Abdullah hesitated. “Three,” he mumbled.Jalal turned to face the judge. “He’s innocent. Let’s go home.”He spoke quietly, but his words produced an uproar from the families on bothsides. In the din of voices the wife’s father let fly a curse. He had been afarmer himself before he gobbled up parcels of land during droughts. Now he wasvain enough to keep his best silk slippers in a cedar chest, just in case thesultan came calling.He vented his fury at Jalal. “Ridiculous! You’re claiming that someone else ranover Aisha? No one else was there.”“No,” Jalal replied.The qadi, who had retired from his large rug-weaving factory, where half thewomen in Konya worked, called for order. “Then what are you saying?”“Look at him. Our brother has milky eyes. He ran over his wife as she wasbending to sort the stalks of wheat, so that the ox cart could roll over them.He didn’t mean to.”The judge leaned down from his high table. “You didn’t see her?”The defendant crossed his arms over his chest, refusing to answer. It wasn’tpride. If he admitted that he couldn’t see, his sons would have the right toseize his land. He’d become no better than their slave. Abdullah had beencovering his eyes for months, claiming that flies bit them, when it wascataracts all along.The “not guilty” verdict made the spectators scream, half for joy, half in fury.The qadi shrugged. He knew how it was with these country folk. If Abdullah’ssons wanted his land badly enough, their father would be found in a ditch orsimply disappear. The judge wasn’t happy about Jalal, even so, who was pattingthe blind old farmer and trying to assure him that he was free to go. Advice andinterference were two different things. Making the qadi look foolish was out ofbounds entirely.Jalal found himself walking home alone. This would have been his wish anyway,even if a friend had caught up with him. He wasn’t fit for company. He washaving impure thoughts, and it was dangerous to let them slip out. There was nohelping that. Guilt loosens the tongue. It can take awhile. Impurity burrowsdeep and hides like a mole. But unfortunately guilt isn’t blind like a mole.Jalal felt that everyone could see into his soul. If he bought a fish in themarket and the old woman pressed his change into his hand to make sure no coinsfell through his fingers, her touch burned. When she mumbled, “Thank you, sir,”it was obvious she was crying, “Sinner!”Jalal spent hours examining his guilt, with the precision of the Arabastronomers he admired so much when they mapped the stars. Was guilt hot orcold? Cold, like a frozen rock pressing down on your heart. Shame, on the otherhand, is hot, like a fire spreading across your face. Guilt is nagging ratherthan stabbing, constant instead of intermittent, hard instead of soft. Jalalsmiled to himself. He should have been a court physician, he knew the anatomy ofhis guilt so well. But court physicians are frequently executed if they don’tcure the sultan. That was a sticking point. Jalal’s guilt was not being cured;it was growing worse, festering like an unlanced boil.He crept along with his head ducked and almost ran into someone. The man shouted“Hey!” before he almost ran over the absent-minded scholar with his cart. Jalallooked up and stepped aside, but the driver wasn’t moving on.“I have a question for you, sir.” The man took his hands off his cart andtouched his forehead with respect.A pang struck Jalal. The question was bound to be religious. People trusted himto be wise, to give them a fatwa no one could dismiss. Now he recognized thecart driver, vaguely, from the mosque.“Sorry, I’m on my way to—” he said.The driver cut him off. “It is written that God forgives no great sins, likemurder. I know that, but if I hate my wife and send her to live far away with arelative who starves her to death, gradually, you understand, am I a murderer?”Jalal took a deep breath to steady his nerves. “Yes,” he replied.The man shook his head, pursing his lips. “That’s what my cousin said, and he’sas ignorant as dried mud. Oh well.” He flicked his donkey with a light switch,nodded cheerfully, and moved on.Jalal leaned against a wall, feeling terrible. He was thirty-seven, and for hisentire life men came to his house, and before that his father’s house, withthese questions. He was proud of the answers he supplied. They came quickly, forhe had a good head for the Quran; it was a complex document. Allah didn’t alwayschoose to make his words clear, and if he contradicted himself, that was hisprerogative. The children of God aren’t babies to be spoon-fed. Who couldcomplain? However knotty the Holy Book was, to complain was a grievous sin.Impure thoughts came relentlessly to mind, and the worst of it was that hispiety masked his inner rot. There were moments when Jalal expected a student togrimace, holding his nose, and say, “Do you smell that too? Let’s open awindow.”Then what would the teacher say to the pupil? “That stink is just my soul.Please copy the next verse.”A flood of guilt swept over him. In the midday sun he shivered with cold andturned his steps toward the bazaar. He had nothing to buy; his wife went tomarket at dawn every day anyway. But when he was sure she wouldn’t see him,Jalal mingled with the noisy, jostling crowds. The press of other bodies againsthim made him feel less lonely. Merchants shouting in his ear distracted him fromthe misery of his impious thoughts.In a few minutes he got the relief he sought. In the narrow byways among thestalls all kinds of bodies rubbed shoulders and poked elbows. Since all the bestproduce was gone before noon, sellers had to work harder to push the datessqueezed by picky housewives and brass pots with tiny dents where they had beenknocked on the ground.“Fresh mint, there won’t be any more when it gets cold! Pomegranates picked fromthe Prophet’s orchards! Lamb fat rendered a day after they were born!”It was all show, yet Jalal felt comforted by it, since it pulled him out ofhimself. He smiled at a young girl peddling silver trinkets.“Very nice,” he murmured, thinking how innocent she looked.The girl smiled and leaned toward him. “Look into my eyes and see the worldbefore it began.”Jalal was startled. “What?”She raised her voice over the hubbub. “Your wife would look nice in these.” Sheheld up a pair of hoop earrings.Jalal was certain of what he first heard, and he was about to say so when itstruck him that the voice had been a man’s. Some man had leaned in from behindand said those shocking words into his ear.“Look into my eyes and see the world before it began.”Jalal whirled around to catch the man, but by now he was lost in the millingcrowd. Jalal’s ears burned; his heart raced. He didn’t want the girl at thestall to see him like this, so he rushed away, pushing into the mob. Anger beganto rise in him as he repeated the words and felt more and more offended.Strangely for such a mild man, he was suddenly overcome with fury. He pushed atottering old woman out of his way and blindly kicked at a stray dog.“Why won’t you look? Your eyes are small, but they can see across the universe.”There it was again, the same voice. This time Jalal was quicker. He turnedaround and grabbed at the cloak of the man behind him.“What did you just say to me? How dare you!”He had grabbed hold of a black porter, an Abyssinian with a bale of cotton overhis shoulder. The porter looked frightened and mumbled excuses in his nativetongue. It was obvious he didn’t know a word of Arabic. Everyone close by turnedtheir heads. Jalal let go of the poor man, turned red, and dashed away. At hisback he felt the sting of mocking voices.He ran fast enough to sweat, although he knew very well that it was panic sweat.Allah read his impure thoughts. That went without saying. Now he was beingpunished, and it was only the beginning. Rebuke from God is terrible. Worse, itcan be devious. Your own mind can torment you with words that could be satanicor divine, you never know which.When the angel Gabriel first came to the Prophet, peace be upon him, there wasmore fear than joy. The angel said “Recite!” The holiest of holy books was beingdelivered as a gift—to whom? To a simple, troubled man, a merchant of Mecca, whocraved to know God’s will. Muhammad went to the cave often, to meditate on thesinful world and the feebleness of faith. It seemed as if every people had beengiven the word of God except the Arabs. They had forgotten that they were thesons of Abraham. Allah had every right to destroy them. Instead, he showeredthem with the blessed words of the Quran.When a blessing arrives in a blinding light, however, the mind can becomeunhinged. Every Bedouin child is raised in fear of jinns and demons that can beinhaled while you sleep or tilting your head back to drink wine. The Prophet wasjust a man among men, and he had been raised in the desert by Bedouins. Thesight of Gabriel filled him with panic. He ran outside the cave, stumbling upthe mountain. When he got to the summit, his sandals torn, his feet bleeding,his only intent was to hurl himself off a cliff onto the rocks below. He wasstopped only when he gazed up at the sky and saw the angel in a new form, spreadout as a faint light as far as the horizon. Then Muhammad realized that Allahabides everywhere in creation. There is no escaping him, and so dying wasfutile.How desperate that moment must have been! Jalal could feel it now himself, thepanic of nowhere to hide. He wanted to clap his hands over his ears, shuttingout the insidious voice. But reason took hold. The voice wouldn’t return, not ifhe calmed down. Quickly Jalal left the bazaar. He found an empty square, a placehe knew about where an old well had dried up. Nobody went there anymore. It wasan empty place with blank walls on all sides.Jalal arrived quickly. The square was vacant. He sat on the crumbling edge ofthe well, looking around several times to make sure he was alone. Gradually hisheart slowed. He felt normal again, and almost safe. Strangely, his panic seemedto have driven out his guilt, because when he looked inside, there was a coolsensation of peace.“Come with me, my beloved. There is a field beyond the reach of life and death.Let us go there.”Oh God! Jalal’s heart leapt into his mouth. He didn’t bother to whirl around andfind the man who spoke in his ear. There wouldn’t be anyone there. But insteadof jumping to his feet and running away, Jalal felt himself paralyzed, his legsas limp as a baby’s. His body knew that there was no escape, and, like acriminal surrendering on the day of execution, it waited. When there is nowhere to hide, we all hide anyway. After the angel inspired him,the Prophet ran home and shut himself in his rooms. For months he didn’t tellhis family about the divine visitation, and it was a longer time before anyoneoutside the household heard the first words of the Quran. For Jalal, thingsbegan the same. He ran home and shut himself up, away from the sight of men, butthen everything sped up. On a cold, bright day there was a knock at the door.Jalal’s wife was out; he waited for a servant to answer it, and when one didn’t,he preferred not to shout and answered the door himself.It was a stranger, dressed from head to foot in black and leaning on awanderer’s staff.“I’ve come. I hope you’re better, although in your position I wouldn’t be,” hesaid. “Let me in.”The stranger’s voice, in well-accented Persian, was soft, but compelling. He wassomewhere around Jalal’s age, with the same scholar’s beard. Jalal stood asideto let him in. “In my position?” he asked haltingly.“You’re twisted into a knot. God does that. When a contradiction is tightenough, the mind gives up.”“And God wants this?” asked Jalal. He felt a tingle up his spine, but didn’twant to accept what it meant: the stranger’s voice was the one that had spokenin his ear.“God wants you to be clear about things. Right now you aren’t.” The strangerlooked around, chose the largest, most comfortable cushion, and sank to thefloor with a whoosh of breath. He had walked a long way.“Tea,” he ordered, as a maidservant entered the room. With a glance Jalal gaveher permission to bring some. The stranger threw his staff across the room witha clatter.“If you want to be an abject sinner, go ahead. The trouble is, you can’t beabject and proud at the same time. That’s why you are confused,” the strangerdeclared. The cushion he sat on, cross-legged and erect rather than slouchingback, was near a window. Jalal had a clear view of the man’s bright, dartingeyes. When they landed on Jalal, they seemed to laugh at him.“We must all live with the knowledge of our sins,” Jalal murmured.“Don’t evade,” said the stranger roughly. “You’re probably right to be abject,only you need better reasons. You’re proud because you think you’re better thanthe Prophet, peace be upon him. The Prophet hid under a blanket for two daysafter God’s voice spoke. You intend to hide forever. Isn’t that a kind ofpride?”The mention of God’s voice caused Jalal to go stiff. The maid arrived with thetea, so he had to seem calm while she poured two glasses. When they were aloneagain, the stranger jumped in first.“My name is Shams. I know about voices. For a long time I have prayed to Allah,asking for the companionship of one who can abide my company. He didn’t take meseriously, but then one day a voice asked me, ‘What are you willing to pay inreturn?’“I said, ‘My head.’ When you despair of finding someone who understands, yourlife is a small wager. So the voice told me who you are and where to find you.”Shams raised his glass in a toast. “So here we are. The two most fortunate menin the world—or the two most cursed.”Shams’s words shook Jalal to the core. If he had the wits to act like a lawyer,he could have peppered him with a stream of suspicious and disbelievingquestions. Something stopped his tongue. He leaned back and, to his greatsurprise, sighed with relief. He felt like a parched wanderer in the desert whohas a vision of an oasis. For days nothing lies ahead of the wanderer but thesame barren sands, and then, just when he has drained the last drop from hiswaterskin, he stumbles over the next rise and, behold, his vision is real.The stranger, Shams, smiled. “I was in the bazaar the other day. I saw you, infact. Among ordinary people I pass as a traveling merchant, a weaver. That is mytrade, in fact; but I am the son of an imam in Tabriz, a great man.”Jalal nodded. “The voice prepared the way, so I wouldn’t turn my back on you.”“Just as the voice I heard prepared my way to you. We are both blessed. Not thatI have forgotten the possibility that we are cursed.”The empire of the Seljuk sultans was vast, stretching from the Aegean Sea acrossmany lands conquered centuries before by the Romans. To the Arabs these landswere still Rum, or Rome. If you met a traveler from there, you might tell yourfriends that you ran into a Rumi, a Roman. But the world would stick the tag onone man in particular, not that Jalal knew it yet. He, our Rumi, began to posequestions. He was less nervous, and he wanted to know everything about thisShams-i Tabrizi who had been sent by the will of Allah. Who were his people? Washe the fortunate eldest son or the bereft youngest?“Who I am is unimportant. Let’s just say that I am you,” said Shams.“And who am I?”“An insect collector, apparently.”“Why do you say that?”Shams looked round the room. “Your books are scattered everywhere. You pore overthe Quran and the law. In my experience, weevils and worms gnaw their way intoold books, and since the words you read are useless, the only reason to hold onto your books must be that you collect insects.”Despite, this, the stranger knew as much about the contents of books as didRumi. To exchange learned words delights a scholar’s heart. It bores the world,however.Soon enough Rumi confessed his state of crisis. Once the words started pouringout, he couldn’t stop himself. Shams was a tireless listener, but notnecessarily a patient one.“Stop saying ‘God’ all the time,” he snapped. “It gets on my nerves.”“But we are talking about God,” Rumi objected.“Alas.”“What do you mean? You are a seeker yourself, aren’t you?”Shams shrugged. “And you are a fruit seller who has run out of peaches. God usedto be a luscious peach, the sweetest and ripest imaginable. He dropped likehoney on the tongue. Time passed. The sweetness dried up; the honey turnedbitter. Now what are you peddling? You cry, ‘Fruit here! Luscious, desirablefruit.’ But all that you have to offer is a dried, shriveled skin.”At first Rumi resisted. God, he was certain, isn’t a peach. “I want knowledge.You give me poetry,” he accused his visitor.“Of course. If you have no roses to smell, at least their scent can be capturedin a poem,” said Shams.Rumi threw up his hands. “Peaches. Roses. You’re laughing at me.”“So that I won’t weep.”“Meaning what?”“I see the emptiness in your heart. You’ve papered it over with fine words.Moving through the world you get respectful nods from other men. But they don’tlove you. In fact, they hate you for your learning. They fear that you will findout their secret and expose them.”“What secret?” asked Rumi.“That their hearts are as empty as yours.”If Shams continued to batter away at him like this, Rumi didn’t know what wouldhappen. He was exhausted after an hour. Any more and he might faint or fallsick. They sat alone in the room, surrounded by cold tea and dirty glasses, yetbehind the door Rumi had a wife and two sons. After a while there was a gentlerapping from the next room. Rumi sat up, suddenly remembering that he had a lifeto lead.Shams saw his eyes glance at the door. “I know,” he murmured. “The world is withus, but only for a little while longer.”There was no menace in his voice, but Rumi grew alarmed. “What’s going tohappen? Are you hiding a knife?”Shams refused to answer, gesturing for Rumi to go to his family. That night thevisitor slept in a rough wool blanket outside the house, taking breakfast withthe family, saying nothing except polite mumbles. Rumi eyed him uneasily. By thelight of a new day Shams seemed eerie, like an apparition that should havevanished in the night. Once they were alone, Shams told Rumi to ignore him.“I’m your shadow today. Act as if you don’t notice me.”“Why?”“Nothing mysterious. I only want to observe.”Rumi was certain that something mysterious had to be going on. He followedShams’s instructions, forcing himself not to look over his shoulder as the dayunfolded, a typical day. He prayed and studied and told his sons what wasexpected of them. He went to the madrassa, the religious school that he hadinherited from his father, where he taught twelve boys to read and write. Thehardest part came after sunset, when Rumi sat by candlelight to read the Quran.Seeing Shams in the corner made him too anxious to concentrate.Without preamble Shams spoke. “I told you about peaches and roses. Now it’s timefor candles and oceans.”He smiled at Rumi’s reaction. He looked relieved that Shams was no longer hissilent shadow, but he was baffled and a little annoyed that more riddles werebeing posed. Shams approached the candle that stood beside Rumi’s book, whichgave off good light with little smoke. It filled the room with the oily scent ofbeeswax.“If God is light, is he in this candle?” Shams asked.“Perhaps.”“Why perhaps? Is there a place that Allah is not?”“No, but the light of God isn’t the same as ordinary light. If the candle burnsout, can you say that God has disappeared?”Shams laughed. “God disappears all the time. When people lose a child or theirmoney or all their sheep, in my experience they usually lose God. But that’s notthe point. Accept for a moment that this candle is God.”Rumi nodded.“We worship the light. We call it God. But how many candles can you light, howmany holy lamps or ritual fires, before you get bored? The light no longerstands for anything. It’s just a smelly candle whose stub you will throw out inthe morning. Do you know what that means?”Rumi tried not to show his annoyance. “Tell me.”“It means that time is God’s enemy. If something can die, snuffed out like acandle, it cannot be God, since God has no beginning or end.” Shams held up hishand to keep Rumi from interrupting him. “I see your impatience. Hold still fora moment. Oceans.”“I’m listening. I’ve traveled and seen the ocean.”“I can read your mind when you beheld the ocean. How vast, how awesome! This toomust be God. You contemplated eternity. So what?”“Isn’t awe enough?”“Enough for what, to enclose infinity? You didn’t even embrace the ocean. If youdipped a cup in it and took a bit of ocean home with you, after a few days itwould evaporate. So much for your awe. Where is God in it?”“Tell me. I don’t want to guess,” said Rumi.“Nowhere. Space is God’s enemy. The oceans are vast. You can spend a lifetimesailing over them, beholding their expanse. But still infinity would stretchbeyond your eye. I’ve laid before you two truths you cannot escape. Time isGod’s enemy, and so is space. What can you do once you surrender to thesetruths?”Shams hadn’t changed his tone of voice, which was like a schoolmaster’s. Rumiused that tone all the time, droning flatly as half of his students dozed off.But instead of dozing, Rumi felt his spine tingle. Shams noticed.“Ah, the first glimmer,” he said with a note of triumph. “Think how long you’vewaited to hear my words. Sit back. Enjoy being stupefied. Bask in yourignorance.”He was mocking Rumi, but what he said was true. In a flash Rumi saw hisignorance spread out before him. He had spent years praying and studying. He hadtraveled to the far reaches of the sultan’s empire visiting holy shrines. But ifGod was beyond time and space, none of it mattered.Shams leaned close enough that Rumi felt his warm, moist breath. “You have triedto capture the sea in a teaspoon and the sun in a candlestick. Stop.”Rumi trembled. The room felt small and dark; he wondered if he shouldn’t beafraid of Shams. Wouldn’t you be afraid of inviting an assassin into your house?An assassin of the mind is more fatal. The instant this thought came to Rumi,the candle burned out, and without warning he felt Shams’s arms wrap around him.Rumi flinched; his instinct was to push the stranger away. But Shams held on,squeezing him tighter.“Love me!” he whispered fiercely.Rumi was shocked. He tried to jump up, but Shams’s embrace pressed him down inhis chair.“There’s no escape,” Shams whispered. “You will never go beyond time. You willnever touch the hem of God, which is outside the universe. There is only onechoice to make. Love me!”Rumi had never known such panic as he felt at that moment. The darkness wassuffocating. He had an overwhelming urge to cry out to Muhammad, the old servantwho slept across the threshold of the house at night to protect it fromburglars. Something in him, however, was not panicking. This surprised Rumi; itwas enough for him to hold still in Shams’s grip.“Better,” Shams murmured. His grasp loosened.“Really?” Rumi laughed nervously. He heard his heart beating wildly and was surethat Shams heard it too.Now Shams’s arms relaxed; they were still wrapped around Rumi, but loosely, theway a father might hold his son as they sat by the river in springtime enjoyingthe return of warmth. In a low voice Shams began to sing.Take me to that place where no one can go,Where death is afraidAnd swans alight to playOn the overflowing lake of love.His singing voice was sweeter than his speaking voice, which carried an edge.Rumi kept still. He loved poetry, and even more he loved to hear it sung, with areed flute playing somewhere in the distance. He felt a warm tear roll down hischeek.Shams took a breath and repeated the refrain.And swans alight to playOn the overflowing lake of love.There the faithful gatherEver true to their Lord.Rumi shivered and was glad that the room was dark, because tears covered hischeeks. An assassin had entered his house and turned into an angel. The shock of what had happened to Rumi quickly spread through the town. Konya’slearned jurist had lost his way. He wandered the streets at all hours,wide-eyed, holding his hands up to heaven. He seemed delirious and fevered. Hesang in a loud voice, and when people addressed him, he acted as if he didn’trecognize them. This might have been forgiven, attributed to the full moon, evenif some of his friends whispered darkly behind his back. Rumi was so respectedthat his reputation wasn’t ruined in a week. It took a whole month.“Our students are leaving. We’ll be ruined!” his wife wailed. Rumi gazed at herblankly, as if he didn’t know her either.It was obvious that this distressing change had occurred after Shams arrived.People accosted him.“You don’t like who he has become?” Shams replied.“You do? He’s lost his mind. Soon he will lose all his friends. Nobody will haveanything to do with him,” people said.Shams shrugged. “Sometimes a person decides to become real. If you are shocked,think how he must feel.”No one was satisfied with this cavalier explanation. Resentment against Shamsgrew, but Rumi rarely left his side. If Shams was in the room, he stared at himconstantly, and the simplest sentence that Shams spoke caused Rumi to exclaim“Ah!” in a loud voice.There were intervals when Rumi calmed down and could be questioned. Piecingtogether his words, which were rushed and fragmentary even during these calmermoments, his friends gathered what was going on with him.“I didn’t know who I was,” Rumi explained. “I clothed myself in false knowledge,not just about myself but about everything. Why are we here? To find the truth.All my life I’ve prayed and studied. My father was a Sufi, believing that God isdrawing us near. He taught me that my soul wants to join God, not after I die,but now, at this very moment.”So far, none of this was a secret. The Sufis were a sect with great influence.The common people respected them because they wandered harmlessly seeking God.They were gentle; they took their search seriously. Shams was also a Sufi, froma different sect, but, then, there were many of these, and each had its owntariqa, its methods and rituals for finding God. But that was no reason to loseyour mind, said Rumi’s friends.Rumi’s eyes would widen and his face glow with the innocence of a child. “Iknow, I know. But who ever finds God? The search is never-ending. If I countedup the words in all my prayers, there would be millions. I had to run away. Sodo you. Everyone must run away. It’s our only hope.”He would become quite worked up at this point and lapse into a kind of whirlingdance while singing songs that came into his head, passionate songs that mostpeople found outrageous.Death killed the one I was,Now I am love itself!If there is wheat around my graveO, make your wine from itAnd drink the elixir of life!Strangely, the more that Rumi made a fool of himself, the more that people beganto listen to him. They followed him in his wanderings, waiting to hear whatmight burst out of him. Then small clumps began to gather at his door. He hadlost his respectability—no, he had thrown it into the gutter with a wildlaugh—and in that moment God touched him. Always he sang about love and what laybeyond this world.Don’t come to my grave to weep.I have left there,I do not sleep,I have joined the deathless dance of lovers,And how my spirit flies!If they listened, people gradually understood. Love was something new in theirears. The holy books spoke much more of fearing Allah, who holds eternalpunishment over the heads of sinners. The faithful dreamed of the garden ofParadise promised by the Prophet, where wine flowed like a river and fruit fellfrom the trees, yet sin was inescapable. Children were warned to obey withoutquestion, because next to faith God most loves obedience.Deep down, though, they knew what Rumi was about. If you give a poor man an acreof land around his house, he will be pleased and stay there for life. Build awall around that acre, however, and all he will want is to escape. Rumi had goneover the wall, and although people held their breath, waiting for him to bestruck down, nothing happened. Months passed, and he still sang his delirioussongs, attracting anyone who heard the soft call of the soul to be free.Eventually Rumi noticed that he wasn’t alone. Every day his doorway was blockedby a small crowd sitting on the ground waiting for him to emerge. Someonestarted to write down his words. Even when he was swinging around a post,reciting for hours in a trance, teachings came out. Risking heresy, some beganto claim in private that he was reciting the Quran of the Persians.Nothing stays private long. The clerics of Konya were greatly disturbed. Theyformed a delegation and came calling. Rumi received them meekly. Gazing around,his guests were surprised that his library was neat and undisturbed. Rumi knewwhat they were thinking.“I didn’t burn my books. Why should I? Allah cannot be touched by fire. Butthen, I would probably have to write them all over again.”He spoke lightly, but the head cleric in Konya, a mullah who was twice as old asRumi, glared at him suspiciously. “You would defile the holy books, except thatit’s inconvenient? Is that what you are saying?”“I am saying whatever you hear,” murmured Rumi.An argument would have broken out, but the clerics were silenced by Shamswalking into the room.“A convention of insect collectors,” he said in greeting, which no oneunderstood. The sight of him was unpleasant enough.“You have corrupted our best teacher,” the head cleric accused.“I’ve liberated him,” said Shams. “Now he will be a perfect teacher.”“Only the Prophet is perfect, peace be upon him,” chimed in another cleric.“Every soul is perfect, but it shines through us as if through a dirty window.Who knows how we would be once the window is cleaned?” said Shams, as impudentas you please.He had eaten well and was picking his teeth with a brass toothpick. The clericsrustled angrily. They weren’t there to debate, only to issue a warning. A vaguewarning, as it turned out, since none had the power to exclude Rumi fromworship. If they kept him out of the mosque, he could pray privately. If theybanned children from his madrassa, there would be trouble among the commonpeople, who had begun to love him. Rumi had flung the school doors open to thewhole town.The clerics rose to leave when Shams held up his hand.“I wagered my head to find this man who outrages you. You wince when he gazes atme with love, refusing to accept that one soul is seeing another. God willing,we will all see each other that way one day.”“God willing, that day will never come,” snapped the head cleric, who had enoughproof that Satan lies in wait for the unwary.The scandal didn’t evaporate; neither did Shams. His presence was intolerable toanyone who mattered. One cold winter evening Rumi and his mystical friend sattalking. A servant came in, saying that someone at the back door wanted Shams.He still did his weaving. A customer, perhaps?Shams gestured that he would be right back. He went to the back door. He neverreturned. Captors may have thrown a black sack over his head and spirited himoff into the night. A whim may have taken hold, and Shams simply walked away onhis own. The rumor mill, seeing a satisfied look on the face of Rumi’s youngerson, held that he had organized an assassination. If so, Allah had exacted theprice of Shams’s head.Rumi refused to believe the rumors. He was too shocked to eat or sleep, almostto breathe. When grief no longer paralyzed him, he packed a horse, took twoservants, and searched for Shams everywhere he might be, as far away asDamascus. No trace was ever found.When he wended his way home, Rumi reflected for a long time. “I know what hashappened,” he finally announced.“That’s good. You can live with your loss,” people said.“Never.”What grief had taught him was this: to ache for Shams was the same as aching forGod. Rumi poured his ache into poems about Shams. First there were hundreds ofthese, then thousands, then tens of thousands. Yearning became his obsession.Then one day, after another spring had come, Rumi was wandering in his orchards,lost in himself. He felt a light touch on his shoulder.“Shams!”But when he turned around, it was just the petals of the plum trees, the firstto bloom in April, that had touched him. As his fingers brushed them away, Rumistopped. How can a person feel the touch of flower petals through thick woolclothing? Suddenly he heard Shams laughing, and his words came back.“God disappears all the time.”So that was it. This longing for Shams was the same longing we have for a Godwho disappears, not because he hates us, but because all of life is a search—forlove, for truth, for beauty. Whatever God stands for must be elusive; otherwise,we would all feast like a lazy rich man and fall asleep from excess anddullness.Rumi stooped and gathered a handful of white plum petals, raising them to hisnose. The scent was faint—some people smell nothing and wait for the cherrytrees a month later—but to Rumi it was intoxicating. From that moment on, hissearch for perfect love was tinged with joy, even though seeking would neverend.Hearing his poems, people were astonished; there was so much love in Rumi’swords and so much pain. Some couldn’t bear to listen. When they shuddered, theyknew it wasn’t just for him. They felt afraid for themselves. They feltunrequited passion. They felt a voice that beckoned from eternity.Motes of dust dancing in the light—That’s our dance too.We don’t listen inside to hear the music—No matter.The dance goes on, and in the joy of the sunIs hiding a God.Revealing the VisionIf the West was troubled by making the personal God disappear, as Buddha andmany sages in India had done, Rumi brought him back with a passion. In hisfervor, his thirst to make God his lover, his willingness to take his search tothe edge of madness, Rumi is the complete devotee. Worship becomesall-consuming. Every moment is spent in a feverish search for one thing: thebliss that comes from ecstatic union with God.From a romantic viewpoint, this sounds marvelous, but there was a sternnecessity behind it. Like Judaism, Islam follows scriptures that are about law,obedience, the peril of temptation, and fear of the Lord. Can human naturesustain such an austere, disciplined relationship to God? Perhaps, for the few.But human nature has a great talent that is the reverse of its greatestweakness. If told not to stray beyond the safe confines of virtue, we alwaysfind a way to transgress—jumping over the fence is our way to freedom and alsoto disaster.Rumi knew both extremes. His biography, about a respected jurist who overnightbecame a free spirit, appeals to our modern taste for rebels. But his time withhis beloved master, the mysterious wandering Sufi Shams-i Tabrizi, was brief, amatter of less than a year. During that time Rumi became versed in the ecstaticway, the path of increasing bliss through love of the divine. But there was afateful side to Shams, who seems to have known that the path, for him, would endviolently. He disappears from the pages of history by walking out a back door tomeet an unnamed someone. After that, nothing is known, except that Rumi’s griefwas unbearable.When grief is this intense, it’s common for people to find surrogates to fillthe void they feel inside. Parents who lose a child will preserve the child’sbedroom intact, moving nothing, as if love can be frozen in time. At leastremembrance can. Rumi did something like this in poems. He turned Shams into animmortal beloved, not for erotic reasons, but to regain the sense of perfectbliss that had descended upon him without warning, only to be lost just asunexpectedly.In many of Rumi’s poems you cannot tell God, the immortal beloved, and the lostteacher apart. Yet the way he writes about the search for God is so personal andpassionate that it is irresistible:In love that is new—there must you die,Where the path begins on the other side.Melt into the sky and break freeFrom the prison whose walls you must smash.Greet the hue of dayOut of a fog of darkness.Now’s the time!Outside the isolated sphere of Persian poetry, Rumi is known in translation forshort verses and pithy sayings:The idol of yourself is the mother of all idols.Fortunate is he who does not walk with envy as his companion.You’re misled if you think the self is easy to subdue. These make it seem that he is an effusive romantic, inspired to deliverbrilliant gems that are easy to assimilate. But within his own tradition, Rumiis celebrated for monumentally long discourses on the Sufi way. The term sufioriginated with the coarse wool cloak that wandering mystics wore, and to thisday their practices are outside the rigorous boundaries of the Quran. It’s ahistorical oddity that so many Westerners see the Sufis as appealingrepresentatives of Islam, when to insiders they may be too unorthodox, toooutside the Book. When Turkey became a republic under Mustafa Kamal Ataturk,after a three-year struggle for independence (1919–22), Sufism was outlawedalong with other public displays of Islam. For a time Rumi’s tomb in Konya wasclosed to the public, and it was decades before the whirling dervish dances thatare central to the Mevlevi order were allowed to be performed. Whatever we thinkof Sufism, the various orders posed a threat to the secular state andreactionary belief.When you are caught up reading the poems, none of that matters. The pure,undistracted path of the mystical lover of God is laid bare, along with its painwhen the divine lover is absent. Of course, when you aren’t under its spell,this kind of God-talk can seem histrionic, even hysterical. In the India of mychildhood, there were respected, even revered, holy figures who acted—andperhaps were—insane; they were known as mastram, those who are mad for God. SoRumi’s line, “You give away everything, even your mind,” isn’t poeticexaggeration. It is perilous to start out on a journey that could cost you yoursanity, not to mention home, family, and social acceptance.But it’s a mistake, I think, to assume that the devotional path laid out by Rumiis a kind of spiritual bargain in which you trade reason for unreason, safetyfor risk, and ordinary happiness for bliss. The devotional path, like allprofound paths, is about transformation, not bargains with an unseen God. Thegoal is still unity consciousness. However, instead of examining the obstaclesthat exist in our consciousness, which is the path of contemplation, or sortingout the real from the unreal by intellectual focus, which is the path ofknowledge, devotion is an all-consuming love affair.The romance of such a path quickly disappears, because no matter what path youtake, obstacles and resistance block the way. Someone on the path of knowledgemay be totally frustrated, saying, “I don’t know where I’m going. My mind feelsjumbled and confused. I’m exhausted thinking about God and never finding him.”The devotee’s frustration is emotional: “I feel numb. I can’t find the bliss Ionce knew. God runs ahead of me like a teasing lover, never allowing me to touchhim when I desperately want to.” What saves both paths is that the course of theunfolding of the soul is well mapped. You may feel exhausted and empty, and inyour struggle the condition feels unique. It isn’t. The tradition of seekers isthe longest in recorded history. For as long as we have records about God, wefind seekers working their way to the divine presence.Reading Rumi feels so persuasive because he reports everything from his ownexperience, no matter how humiliating. But he has a universal dimension thatamplifies the personal, making it far more significant. Here he is in detachedmood, speaking as if from an otherworldly perspective, a perch in eternity:When a lover of God gets ready to danceThe earth draws back and the sky tremblesBecause his feet could stomp with such wild joyThat the sun, moon, and stars might fall from heaven.Reading about how the poems were written, one gets the impression that Rumi wasalways in a trance, sometimes dancing, sometimes swinging in circles from apole. The sight of him doing those things riveted his followers and botheredrespectable society. Yet the word ecstasy comes from the Latin meaning “to standoutside or apart.” Bliss isn’t a hysterical, moody, changeable state. Rather, itis an attribute of God and therefore completely stable. What causes the apparenthysteria and moodiness of Rumi’s situation is loss. Feeling no bliss, runningafter an absent God, desperate not to be abandoned, a seeker on the devotionalpath isn’t acting out ecstasy, but the opposite.Which is why, I think, the respectable devotional paths found in the West, suchas you’d meet in silent convents and peaceful churches, would be foreign toRumi. Sufism is highly organized and disciplined, so we outsiders cannot speakcredibly about the kind of experiences anyone has in the order. One suspectsthat Rumi’s kind of spontaneous awakening is rare, however. He doesn’t teach apath to us Western readers. Yet as a torch held aloft at the beginning of thepath, who is more inspired? There is a bright flame inside Rumi, and his hope isthat he makes you see the same flame inside yourself.I’ll end with one of his most famous extended metaphors about the transformationthat devotion may finally bring. A pair of lovers wake up in bed, and thewoman—we imagine her tousled hair and intimate warmth—nestles into the man andasks him a question that feels vain:In the earliest dawn two lovers awokeAnd sipping some water she said,“Who do you love more,Me or yourself?”She wanted the truth.The man gives her an answer that isn’t kind to her vanity, yet speaks from theheart:So he replied, “I can’t love myself,I don’t exist anymore.I’m like a ruby held up to the sunMelting into one redness.Can you tell the gem from the worldWhen a ruby gives itself to sunlight?”Then Rumi enters to speak in his own voice, taking the man’s place and raising alovers’ chat into the sublime:That’s how holy ones can truthfully sayI am God.So be a ruby at dawnAnd hold to your practice.Keep up the work, digging your wellUntil you strike water.Hang a ruby in your earAnd it will become the sun.Keep knocking at the doorAnd joy will look out the windowTo let you in.If the West wants an antidote to the East’s habit of making God disappear, Rumidoesn’t fit the bill. He offers a personal God who is approached with love anddevotion, but the path of devotion makes the seeker disappear. The light thatembraces him extinguishes personality. It even extinguishes the lesser lovebetween two lovers. In the evolution of God, holding on to the image of apatriarch sitting above the clouds becomes more and more a stubborn habit. Thisis especially so when, as with Rumi, the divine is a feeling in the heart thatexpands into all-consuming bliss. Bliss has no name or face. The world’svisionaries go in a different direction. Their paths mingle, but still no singlepicture of God emerges. A deeper transformation is taking place."},{"pageContent":"6 [toc01.xhtml#cha06]Julian of Norwich [toc01.xhtml#cha06]“All Shall Be Well” [toc01.xhtml#cha06]Heads turned when Mistress Kempe rode through town. You couldn’t miss herscandalous white dress—she called it her “pompous array”—which properly belongedon a virgin. Mistress Kempe had borne fourteen children, the first of whichdrove her insane for a time. (She was lucky to recover from her distraction, ifrecover she did.) Now she wouldn’t let her husband touch her anymore.“You’ll enjoy pleasure enough when you arrive in heaven, John Kempe,” she toldhim tartly. He wasn’t so sure it was a fair trade.There was also talk about her crying in public, with big blobby tears andwailing for Jesus. You never knew when it would happen. Mistress Kempe said itcame from the unbearable ecstasy of beholding God’s works all around her. Was ahaywagon crossing her path or an old donkey one of God’s marvels? Perhaps, butthe crying was so loud and strange (something between a screech owl and asquealing piglet) that it unnerved people.“God has made me what I am, and I won’t apologize for him,” she replied to allcomplaints.A rich retinue followed her everywhere, even when she went to buy a sack ofturnips. Any new queerness to be spotted in Margery Kempe was a popular topic.She put on a show of enjoying the attention. “Jesus is the one who speaks to me,every day. That’s all I need or want. The rest is like dust on my slipper.”“Is he speaking to you right now?” people would ask, making her laugh.“How could he? I’m the one talking right now. Are you deaf?”She was actually worried about her holy outbursts, but in public she was brazen,as befits the daughter of a five-time mayor of Bishop’s Lynn. As a member ofParliament, too, he was regularly called down to London, especially duringtroubled times.“What times would those be?” asked the wags in the local taverns. “The plague,the war in France, the new taxes that have starved half the peasantry, or therebellions that killed off the rest?”If Margery’s visions came from anywhere, they came from the feeling that the endof days might be near. By God’s mercy, the whole of England saw nothing but woeeven before the boy-king, Richard II, proved to be a weakling, grossly deceivedby his corrupt ministers.In a land that prayed three times a day and attended church twice on Sunday, howmuch more did God want? The worst troubles had come in 1381 when Margery waseight. In one year the poll tax tripled, the lion’s share going to financeendless foreign wars and the rest lining the pockets of corrupt courtiers. A taxcollector was attacked by an enraged mob south of London. It was a spark, andthe peasants were dry tinder. Mobs assembled without warning. They marched infrom the country, moving over the land like a raging monster. Pitched battlesarose. A summer of violence cost the archbishop of Canterbury his life, and hewasn’t alone. The peasant army even faced down the king and demanded theirfreedom from serfdom. Who could believe it?Soon the rebels started marching north. If they entered a town, they sought outtax collectors for rough justice, burned down the best houses, and defiled God’splaces. The panic was akin to the panic that greeted the Black Death. Margerywas only eight, pampered and innocent. She was packed up in the night andwhisked away from their town, Bishop’s Lynn. She was frightened by being wrappedup in a thick wool blanket and half suffocated in the bouncing coach. She neverlaid eyes on the rioting serfs. She barely knew any to begin with, being a citygirl with a rich father.But worse didn’t come to worst. Before that summer was over the peasants wererouted. They were armed with sticks and knives, no match for arrows, lances, andarmor. Everyone ran to the center of Bishop’s Lynn to see the most notoriousleaders hanged, drawn, and quartered. Margery was torn between curiosity andfear. She couldn’t resist, however, and decided to slip a groat into her maid’shand to sneak off to the executions. It would be gruesome, no doubt, but shewanted to see something special.“My child, what could you dare to see?” her horrified maid asked.“Just before they tear the body apart,” said Margery soberly. “I hear that thehangman cuts out the man’s heart and shows it to him so that he can repent andfind God’s mercy. That’s something I’d like to see for myself.”Her maid balked, and in the end she got the groat anyway for promising not totell Margery’s father about such a wicked desire. Looking back, Mistress Kempedidn’t consider it wicked, but God must have disagreed. A stony repentance wouldtake up her whole life.The first crisis came when she was twenty, still a bride and the mother of herfirst baby. The delivery was difficult. Margery became feverish, and soon shefell gravely ill. No herbs or prayers could break the fever. Her body waswracked with pain. It was so severe that she became delusional; she saw demonsswirling around her, clawing at her with shrieks and laughter. Darkness blottedher mind, and when her husband came into the room, Margery turned her face away.“No visitor can do me good now except death,” she said.Hope was defeated. A priest entered the house for her final confession. He washesitant, though. “I will hear your confession, daughter,” he told Margery, “butlet’s also pray for your recovery. I will remain as long as God needs me.” Thiswas more than optimism and certainly not charity. Her family could afford to paya sizable piece of silver for a constant vigil.“No, I must die after what I will tell you,” said Margery weakly. “God will havenone of me then.”The priest had heard every possible sin in the confessional. He reassured herthat she could be forgiven, no matter what.“Don’t say that until you hear my great secret,” Margery replied.No one found out what she whispered in his ear, but the priest rushed from theroom, horrified. He refused to give absolution. He wouldn’t even finish theconfession. John Kempe watched in bewilderment as the priest fled the house.When he entered his wife’s room, she was raving, her eyes rolled back. He had nochoice but to clap her up in the storeroom until the demons that tormented hermind finally claimed her life.Months passed, and Margery woke up shaking every day, certain of her damnation.She wasted away as she pined. Since everyone accepted the same truth—her soulwas lost to Satan—there was no reason to take extreme measures to keep heralive. So it was a little upsetting when the family entered the storeroom, readyto wrap a corpse in a winding sheet, only to find her sitting up and claimingthat Jesus had appeared to her.It was a miraculous visitation. Jesus stood by her bed, looking down at her withmelting eyes. “Why have you forsaken me, and forsaken even yourself?” he asked.“I did forsake him,” she admitted. “But no more. He stretched out his hand, andwhat was damned in me is now blessed. The rest of my life belongs to God alone.”Her family was perplexed and skeptical. Margery wandered around for days in akind of ecstasy—the loud, strange crying started then. No one could deny thatshe had miraculously regained her strength; and her speech, when she could drawbreath to make sense, was sane. But having her around posed problems. A youngwife beset with an abundance of religious feeling should do the right thing andenter a convent; that had happened often enough. The family got Margery into thecloister, almost. The day came when her solitary bag was packed with the barenecessities for travel. She was found sitting on the floor, surrounded by hermany fine dresses, weeping into a rich brocaded handkerchief. She waved it ather family.“My beautiful things. I can’t leave them behind.”And she didn’t. The wagon was sent away, and Margery resumed her pompous array.She wasn’t proud of being proud. She just knew that a nun’s life would be toobarren. Life with John Kempe was far from barren, one baby following hard onanother, until he died suddenly after she bore him his fourteenth offspring. Therich widow started dressing herself in white and amplified the scandal byinsisting that Jesus was coming to her again, quite often as it turns out. Shecould be seen every day around Bishop’s Lynn silently moving her lips, andeveryone knew who she must be talking to. Everyone who believed her, that is.Did she believe it herself? That was a vexing question. She had no way ofproving that her visitations were divine. They could be demonic; she had had oneexperience of demons already. The only way to settle her dilemma was to findsomeone who spoke to God without a trace of doubt. A saint would be convenient.Second best was the blessed old lady who lived on the other side of the forest. Providence bestows all things. When it came to the city of Norwich, Providencebestowed three things: wood, churches, and dead bodies. The blessed old lady,called Julian, was a witness to all of them. The supply of lumber that made thetown rich seemed endless. Only the plague years stopped the carts trundling inlong lines from the forest (carts that came in handy for stacking up corpseslike cordwood during plague time). English oak was famous everywhere, so thestreets of Norwich were full of foreigners who had sailed from strange places tobuy wood. When Margery Kempe came to town, she took notice.“It was like Babel. I heard a Dane, a Russian, and a Spaniard on my way here,”she remarked.“You speak those tongues?” asked Julian.“No, but I travel. God’s body is scattered everywhere. I follow the pieces. Lastweek I was holding the skull of John the Baptist. Quite marvelous.” It was apeculiar way of saying that the Widow Kempe had enough gold to go on holypilgrimages for most of the year, anywhere in Europe she hoped to find peace—andanswers.“Where is the skull of John the Baptist?” Julian asked.“Here and there, it seems. France, Germany. I’ve seen several, sometimes justthe jaw. It was set in gold in the middle of a great salver on the high altar.”The blessed old lady wasn’t a relic yet. She was a recluse, dwelling in a barehut beyond the edge of town. There was a jug of elderflower wine on the tablethat stood between them. Widow Kempe poured half a cup for herself and dilutedit with water.“Call me Margery,” she said, sipping her wine.Everyone knew Julian’s name, although her birth name somehow had been forgottenduring the long years when almost no one saw her except for the serving maids,and they came and went. People got used to seeing a silent devotee kneeling inthe dimmest corner of the church of St. Julian, and that turned into the namethey gave her, Dame Julian.“So the wood trade has paid for all these churches,” Margery said. “I wonder ifanyone can fill them.”She knew about Norwich and the boons of Providence. Norwich boasted that it hadmore churches than any city in Europe north of the Alps. “And the churchescollect money to keep the dead bodies away.”Julian frowned. “The last time the plague came was twenty-five years before youwere born. I was only six, but I remember. Everyone does, if they survived.”Looking back, Julian was happy that she hadn’t been older. Older people stillwoke up with nightmares about the plague. Margery had never personally seen theBlack Death, only heard gruesome tales. A town’s populace could be mown down asif by one sweep of the scythe. Those who rushed to bury the dead would often beburied the next day. The stench of littered corpses made strong men faint. Mostof these stories were kept alive from the pulpit when priests warned about God’swrath. Nothing worked quite as well as a plague to squeeze tithes from the poor.“Does my white dress offend you?” Margery asked. She was reluctant to speakabout her real purpose for visiting. “Our reverend bishop hates it. More thanour bishop, actually. All the ones I’ve met so far.”“Do you meet many bishops?” Julian asked.“I’m forced to.”Which was a terse way of saying that Margery had been put to tests of faith manytimes, as you’d expect when someone makes a public spectacle of piety. None ofher stern examiners, however, ever caught Margery in heresy. None ever said hervisions were real either.“They haven’t led me to the stake or noose, not yet,” she boasted.In truth her worries had turned to anxiety and now to dread. Her pilgrimages hadbecome more frequent, because Margery was fleeing. She had enough riches to payoff a priest who might condemn her. No mobs had forced her to escapeimprisonment. But it was herself she was trying to flee. In dreams the demonswere clawing at her again, just as before. Only now it took days and muchwailing to get Jesus to appear to her. The trail was exhausting and lonely. Noone supported her holiness anymore, no matter how much gold she offered.Julian was a last refuge. She was revered without being feared. The poor had noqualms about calling her a saint, and superstition swirled around her. Herexistence was meager and stubborn. She wore plain brown homespun clothes and ateonly enough to sustain two medium-size stewing fowls. Her spirit was asuntouchable as a unicorn or phoenix. She spent hours praying, and the only timeguests were allowed was when God told her to open her door. So that grubby coinswouldn’t touch her, someone accepted alms before you went inside the darkchamber where Julian sat.Or more likely knelt. Julian hated surrendering a moment to anyone but God.Praying made her glow, even though she rarely saw the light of day.Margery was sure the old lady knew her purpose for being there, so she decidedto get in the first word. “I’ve come to find certainty about my visions,” shesaid after a moment’s silence. “How can I tell?”“If the bishops don’t know, how can I? They are in authority over poor soulslike us,” said Julian, who had suffered through her own examinations when shewas young. These were stern and harsh. If you failed, you sometimes didn’t leavethe room again.“The bishops are protecting themselves,” said Margery.“Then perhaps you should ask Christ the next time he talks to you.”Margery laughed. She could tell that she wasn’t being mocked. She was beingunderstood, and this made her relax.Suddenly Julian seemed to notice the white dress. “You aren’t a virgin?” sheasked.“No. I wear white because I want to be pure again. ”“It’s surprisingly hard to become a virgin again,” Julian mused.“I meant my soul.”“So did I.”Julian gave her an enigmatic look. “God speaks to you, and you want my advice?That could get both of us in trouble. What kind of answer would satisfy you?”“An answer I can believe in. Sin has weighed down my life. I admit it. Half myfortune has been spent trying to remove the spots from my blackened soul.”“My dear, you know the answers you were taught. When Our Lord rises again, allthe dead will return. Then and only then will we be perfectly pure.”Margery twisted her mouth. “I’m not one for waiting.”“You won’t be waiting. You’ll be dead.”Julian saw the look of disappointment on her guest’s face. What was she expectedto say? Behind her worldliness, Widow Kempe was suffering. Julian drew a deepbreath. “Our task is to believe in the teachings of the Church, not to createnew ones. All new ideas have the same thing in common. They are heresies.”Margery replied, “But what if the true teachings are kept from us? I meandeliberately, by the very ones who are supposed to tend our souls?”She was stepping on dangerous ground now, and she expected Julian, like everyoneelse who feared the Church, to choose her words carefully. But she didn’t.Julian’s voice grew sharp. “God doesn’t have to speak through priests. A crackedjug can carry only a little water.”“Sometimes none,” Margery added.“Sometimes none.”A passing cloud turned the room dark as it blocked the sunlight coming throughthe one window in the hut. The two women couldn’t help but notice, and if theywere the kind to read omens, this might have been a sign from above—and not agood sign either.Yet the veil of darkness seemed to draw them together. Margery heard a smallclicking sound, which she knew well. The whole time they were chatting, Julianhad been saying the rosary, her flicking fingers hidden under a lap shawl.“Priests believe that everyone is about to tumble into hell,” said the old ladycalmly. “That’s what frightens you. You might be in peril of damnation, if youlisten to them. I don’t believe it. Is it possible that God should love hischildren and yet see them damned?”A sense of relief swept over Margery. “So there’s a way out?”Julian’s eyes were small shining dots in the darkness. “Of course.” She pausedto gather her words while never ceasing the quiet click of her rosary beads.“I’m going to tell you the absolute truth. As with most things absolute, youwon’t believe me.”“Go on.”“Close your eyes and listen. These are not just words to reassure you. They willbe your salvation.”The power in Julian’s voice made Margery feel comforted and uneasy at the sametime, a strange mixture. She closed her eyes. The tiny window in the hutafforded no light. She saw only blackness, and she waited. A gift from a saintmight be at hand. What makes a saint? The world speaks in a way the rest of us cannot hear. Normallife deserts them. If Julian’s life was shaken by the plague when she was agirl, Margery’s was undermined by the peasant rebellion. God works on the soulin mysterious ways. Margery never got to see the hangman hold a villain’s heartbefore his eyes so that he might repent. But she passed burned-out skeletons ofhouses in town, with black holes where windows should be. Every time her maidpassed the fresh graves of victims murdered by the mob, the same warning wasrepeated. “That could have been your father.” Close friends of his—merchants,magistrates, landowners—disappeared overnight.Fear colored Margery’s memories, but so did other feelings, all sinful. Hatredof priests inflamed the peasants, and hatred is slow to die. When the rebelsconfronted King Richard, their leaders complained bitterly about priests whoowned vast lands and paid for their own private armies. The clergy were supposedto live in poverty and act like men of peace. What excuse did they have foroutrageously flouting their vows?These bitter questions didn’t get answered. There was no need once the rebelleaders had been executed. The mob scattered to the four winds, every mandisclaiming in a loud voice that he had sympathized with the revolt.Miraculously, no one had ever been the king’s enemy.Hatred stayed close to home, keeping quiet. One of the executed leaders, arenegade preacher named John Ball, was never forgotten. He’d had the courage todeliver sermons in the open air, like Our Lord himself. Crowds gathered on thecommons of south London. Ball read out loud from an English Bible, which wasclose to treason, almost as bad as preaching about God under the open sky. Asfor the rich, high-born priests, Ball said a sentence that lingered long afterhe was killed by the crown’s henchmen. It was a cry for the common folk againstthe aristocracy: “When Adam dug and Eve spun, who were the gentlemen then?”Those words reached Margery’s ears and burned into her conscience. She ran toher father, the mayor.“Did God give Adam and Eve the whole earth to tend?” she asked.Her father smiled. “Well, Adam.”“And did Adam work the soil?”Her father nodded.“So it was God’s wish that whoever works the land should own it?” said Margery.Her father reminded her with a frown that she was eight. Margery repeated thequestion.“God’s first wish doesn’t matter now,” her father replied.“He changed his mind?”“Yes.”“But if God is perfect, he’s always right. He wouldn’t need to change his mind.”Her father frowned again. He didn’t think about demons, not that early on, buthe was disturbed to have a child showing signs of stubbornness and peculiarity.“Have no fear; God is perfect. He doesn’t need to explain himself to younggirls.” One comfort to the mayor was that his daughter would never learn to readand write. There is no better protector of faith than ignorance.Which put an end to it. But questions have a way of burying themselves in theground, like seven-year locusts. When they emerge again, it surprises peoplethat there are so many more than anyone ever remembered. Margery’s consciencegave her no peace, as much as she prayed. Her father owned several farms in thecountry. He assumed she enjoyed sitting beside him when he visited his lands,and sometimes when he drove the horses himself, he let her hold the reins.Margery secretly began to fear these outings. The serfs lined the narrow dirttrack that led from the farmhouse to the fields. The men tipped their caps, thewomen curtsied as if none of them had taken part in the mass rage against theirowners. But they were owned as surely as slaves. None of them ever earned enoughmoney to buy their own land, and most wore out their bodies before they werethirty.Why had God made life so difficult for almost everyone, allowing comfort andease for the few? Guilt crept its way into Margery’s mind. She knew what theBible said. After their disobedience Adam and Eve were punished sorely. Godsaid, Cursed are you above all livestock and all wild animals!You will crawl on your belly and you will eat dust all the days of your life. (Gen. 3:14)Margery didn’t see the rich eating dust. At her father’s table they ate venisonand goose, and on holidays they feasted on roast peacock decorated in itsshining plumage, just like the king at Westminster. Being rich meant that Godloved you better than anyone else; but then a horrible thought occurred to her.If God’s love brings such comforts, he must hate almost everyone. On her ridesto the farm Margery had seen old women so tired and bent over that they actuallywere eating dust as they planted the spring seed.For years she kept her doubts to herself. They festered, and when she wentthrough the agony of her first childbirth, she had to have the boil on her soullanced. Her great secret must be told to the priest. Lying in pools of sweat ina room that sweltered with the shutters sealed, Margery felt the cool relief ofabsolution even before it was delivered, never suspecting the trap she had setfor herself.“I think God hates us. In fact, I’m sure of it,” she said in the priest’s ear.“My life hasn’t been spent closed up in my father’s house. I’ve seen witchesburned for believing that they consorted with the Devil, and two confessed thatthey bore his child, which had a tail that had to be hidden in swaddlingclothes. They drowned Satan’s child, and for that alone they were damned.”“My child!” protested the priest, wanting her to stop while there was stilltime. If she kept going, forgiveness would vanish.A wave of pain struck Margery, making her groan aloud. “No, I must.”The priest waited nervously while she regained the strength to speak. Her skinwas ashen, and he was as sure that she would die as Margery was.“God must hate us to give us corrupt bishops who condemn the innocent just sothey can seize another parcel of land for themselves. I’ve gone with midwivesand seen babies born in squalor, looking like raw-skinned animals before theydied a few hours later. God gives us no mercy. We sicken and grow old. We stewin our sins, knowing that divine punishment is certain while divine love neverarrives.”Now the priest was greatly alarmed. “You asked me for confession, but thesewords are proud and sinful.”Ill and wan as she was, Margery turned her head toward him with burning eyes. “Idon’t believe in you, priest, so you can’t frighten me,” she said. “Yoursalvation is as toothless as your punishments. Life here on earth is alreadyhell enough.”The priest felt a surge of outrage that swept away any compassion he had for thedying young mother. “God’s mercy will be to take you now. If you survive, youwill know what it means to be charged with witchcraft and blasphemy.” He heldhis voice steady, despite his anger, wanting to present the stony face ofauthority.Margery uttered a laugh that came out as a croak from her parched throat. “Ifyou stand for God at this moment, prove it. Does Our Lord forgive me or hate me?I need a sign. If you can’t summon one, I might as well consult an ass about Godas talk to you.”This outrage is what sent the priest flying out of the room in a black humor.Margery looked back on the incident with a heart full of strangeness. Perhapsshe spoke out of delirium. Perhaps her words were what drew the demons to dancearound her bed, because within hours she saw them. Or did her blasphemy drawJesus to her bedside? Was it necessary to swear against God’s mercy in order tomake him hear her? The only thing she was certain about is that Jesus did come,and her heart was flooded with mercy when he said, “Why have you forsaken me,and even forsaken yourself?”Her recovery and her visitation from Jesus became common knowledge. The priestwho could have destroyed her decided not to. He wasn’t showing mercy. Themistress he kept on the side talked him out of taking rash action that wouldprovoke retaliation from Margery’s powerful family. Better to let an uneasypeace prevail, and peace was always uneasy in the years following the revolt.Devotion soothed Margery for a long time. Jesus reassured her of his mercy bytelling her so every day, and when she went on her pilgrimages, she couldn’thelp but fall weeping at the foot of each and every holy relic.“I feel that God is here before me,” she said to the sacristan who had unveileda piece of the holy shroud in Italy.He smiled graciously, and Margery didn’t notice that he was holding out his palmexpectantly. But she knew a little Italian, and when her back was turned, sheheard him mutter to a lackey, “Stupida! Did she pay at the door? Show me.”One cynical remark isn’t enough to shatter faith. Margery’s was worn away byslow degrees, the way pilgrims slowly wear down the steps of a cathedral. Hertravels showed Margery unspeakable poverty, far worse than what she saw on herfather’s lands. The heads of prisoners were stuck on pikes lining London Bridgeafter the hangman was done with them. Margery couldn’t help wondering how manyhad been guilty only of irritating the king’s mistress when they refused to beher lover. A monarch can kill a few rivals on a whim; God killed everyone in theend. Was he indulging a whim?Margery’s faith was ravaged and torn by the time she came to Julian. When shewas asked to close her eyes, she felt a soreness around her heart and realizedthat she was powerless to heal it. What could Julian do to relieve her pain?Margery shivered as the old lady repeated her insistent words.“I am not going to comfort you. I am going to give you the same salvation thatGod gave to me. All shall be well, and all shall be well, and all manner ofthings shall be well,” she murmured and stopped.There was nothing more? Margery squeezed her eyes tight, awaiting a thunderclapor some other sign.“Do you understand?” asked Julian, speaking in quite a normal voice.Margery heard the clink of cups and then a splash. She opened her eyes andperceived, dim as the room was, that Julian was pouring more wine, this time forboth of them. She was wreathed in smiles.“Marvelous, isn’t it?” she said. “Oh, wait. I can see that you don’t understand.I’m so sorry.” The look of disappointment in Margery’s face was unmistakable.Instead of reproving her, Julian laughed. “What did you expect, dear woman? Ican’t shoot lightning out of my breasts.”“I expected—”Margery stopped there and meekly accepted the cup of wine being held out to her.Julian sat back in her chair. “I knew that your visions were genuine the momentyou stepped in. You weep from ecstasy, even though it embarrasses you and makesyou a spectacle. You spend your money on holy pilgrimages and give to charity.All of this speaks of your love for Jesus, and he comes to those who love himwith a full heart. How can I not believe this? He came to me.”This was the most that Julian had said since Margery arrived, and her frailtymade it difficult. But she wanted to keep on. “I wasn’t concerned about yourvisions, but about your sin.”Margery cringed. “You think I’m horrible.”Julian tilted her head back and laughed. “My child, no one is horrible. Sin isnot the sign of our evil. It is something no one imagines. I would not haveimagined it if Our Lord had not told me himself.”Margery couldn’t speak. She had spent years fearing that she would be declared adanger to the Church. Now she was sitting politely over wine with someone whocould shake the Church to its core, if the common people rallied around hervisions. The doctrine of sin had kept them as oppressed as the king’s soldiers.The room began to swim; Margery intended to say, “I don’t understand.” Insteadshe said, “You are very dangerous.”“So we are more alike than you think,” said Julian. “I was in my thirtieth yearwhen I fell so sick that I was expected to die. My first instinct, however,wasn’t to send for a priest.”“Why not?”“Because in my experience people die a little faster as soon as the priestcomes,” Julian replied coolly. “It’s common politeness. My case was different.God appeared to me every day, ending only when I was well again.”“I’ve heard tales.”“I know. It became the tattle. But you and I know how life overturns when Godspeaks.”The old lady paused, but not from shyness or a desire to keep things to herself.She was overwhelmed, even now, forty years later, by the light that had streamedinto her body then. She had left her sickroom, as if floating above the earth,and beheld the cosmos reduced to the size of a hazelnut. In that vision, seeingthat all of creation could fit in the palm of her hand, she knew that God was ineverything. If he was in everything, he must be in the sinner and his sin andeven the Devil himself.“I was amazed to see sin in a new way,” she said. “It is not our shame. Sin willbecome our worship.”Margery, who thought she was long past being shocked, felt more than shocked atthat moment. She almost panicked. “You cannot be praising sin,” she said weakly.“I praise all of God’s creations. It can’t be that one part is perfect and theother part diseased. We are pained by knowing that we have sinned. That pain wasgiven to us to show where we have lost love. If we listen to our own pain, wewill find a way through to love once more. Sin is repaid by bliss.”Julian took long enough to say these words that Margery could calm herself. Shelooked at her hands and noticed that she had emptied her cup of wine. She wasbeginning to understand, because her own pain had turned to ecstasy—not always,but more than a few times.“Sin is in God’s plan,” said Julian. “We are led by every sign, by everythingthat happens to us, toward love. That is why all is well. That is why all shallbe well. What I told you is absolute truth. Pain comes and goes. We sin todayand forget tomorrow. What abides forever is love.”Margery didn’t disguise that she was overwhelmed; she began to sob. There hadalways been a touch of humiliation when tears overcame her in public. Now shewept freely, and it felt as if grains of poison were being dissolved and washedfrom her heart.“I was so afraid to lose my soul,” she murmured when she was able to form words.“Too many people have told you that your soul was in danger. Before you believeanyone, ask if they have ever seen their own souls.”It seemed to Julian that she had revealed enough. The effort exhausted her, and,besides, she was a realist. Half of Norwich had made its way to her door; mostof them broke down crying when she spoke. But she didn’t observe that Norwichhad turned into a gleaming city of saints.Margery reached out in the darkness and took the old lady’s hand, even though itmeant separating it from the rosary. Julian drew it back.She said, “Don’t think I’ve blessed you. You bless yourself. Your soul willnever take rest in things that are beneath itself.”My soul blesses me. Even when I sin? thought Margery, but she didn’t say italoud. She could barely take in this new view of sin. The trip back to Bishop’sLynn hadn’t become shorter while she sat there. She rose; the two of themexchanged nods. As she walked out into the coolness of late twilight, Margeryhad no thoughts. A silence lingered inside that calmed her. In the coach on theway home, she wrapped herself in a blanket and tried to sleep as it jouncedalong. She wanted to envision a world where all shall be well. It was difficult.To imagine that all is well already was impossible. After awhile Julian’s imageseemed to fade away.To outward appearances Margery Kempe kept wandering restlessly. There was aparticularly holy relic in Danzig she had to see, a chalice that overflowed withChrist’s blood every Easter. But she was haunted by indelible words from Julian:“You will never be free until you see your own soul.” She found herself on aninvisible pilgrimage. A woman in white might be seen anywhere as the yearspassed. When she was too old to travel, Margery became calmer, but for the dayshe died.Witnesses recall that she became excited at the last. With a faint cry shereached out her hand, grasping feverishly for an object hovering over her bed.No one else saw it, however, and she passed away without a word. Whatever hadaroused her spirit was between herself and God.Revealing the VisionTurning to a Christian mystic after looking at Eastern mystics feels morefamiliar. We are used to terms like “soul” rather than “Atman,” Jesus ratherthan Shiva. But behind this familiarity God is departing from the reassuringfatherly images of church sermons. Not everyone is in favor of the divinedisappearing act. The pull of old images is strong, and breaking away from themis wrenching. Violence can ensue. The romance of being in the world but not ofit—which is the essential romance of mysticism—clashes with harsh socialreality.I can’t help but feel that Julian of Norwich is the most touching figure in thisbook. She wasn’t martyred; there is no evidence that she suffered anypersecution. We have no record that she was lonely, even though she lived awayfrom society in rural seclusion at a time when the deep forest crept to the edgeof even sizable towns in England. What makes her so touching is the gapingdistance between Julian’s inner life and the brutality of life around her. Ittook a long time before scholars stopped calling her era the “Dark Ages” andadopted the more polite and clinical term the “Middle Ages.” But how much darkercould an age get?The Black Death, which Julian witnessed early in her life, was a holy terror,literally. We can hardly imagine it—not just the shock of seeing corpses pilingup in the streets, as up to a third of a town’s population died in a matter ofdays, but also the terrifying conviction that God was indeed bringing down hiswrath. Scapegoats were sought out and killed—witches, Jews, and heretics.Death’s scythe swept with unstoppable savagery. Against this background, imaginea woman hearing this message from God: “All shall be well, and all shall bewell, and all manner of things shall be well.”These words are the ones Julian is remembered for in the annals of Catholicmystics, a fair share of whom were women. But in England in the fourteenthcentury, Julian stands out in a ravaged landscape full of violence, disease, thePeasants’ Revolt, and strong-handed clerics who sometimes supported their ownprivate militia. Julian’s only rival is Margery Kempe, who would not beremembered, since the Church didn’t pick her up, except that she published amemoir, the first published book written by a woman in English.They met when Julian was old and Margery middle-aged, and in imagining what theysaid to each other, I’ve raised the central issue that hovers around mystics:Are their revelations real? Once you are canonized, made officially saintly, thematter is settled by the book. But for everyone in this book, with fewexceptions, hearing from God led to an outcast’s status and general suspicion.In Julian’s time, every life was entangled, one way or another, with religion.This meant, without a doubt, that countless people claimed to be divinelyinspired, just as countless local churches claimed to have precious relics likea piece of the True Cross or the spear that pierced Jesus’s side.It doesn’t help if a mystic receives messages that disagree with the religiouspowers of the day. They often do, as if God chose the humblest to correct theerrors of the mightiest. Here is a sample from Julian that couldn’t have pleasedthe local bishop:God showed that sin shall be no shame to man, but worship. For right as to everysin is answering a pain by truth, right so for every sin, to the same soul isgiven a bliss by love.The language is archaic, but the import was shocking at the time: sin isn’tsomething to be ashamed of. God is sending you pain to show you where the truthlies. Therefore, sin is ultimately a way to find bliss through divine love.Do not be ashamed of sin? As everyone around her knew, sin was a universalcondition. It linked every person to the fall of Adam and Eve. No lessimportant, it created the durable mixture of fear and devotion that enabled theChurch to amass vast wealth. Every cathedral is a monument to redemption andsin, tightly holding hands. Margery Kempe was tormented by not knowing where shefell in this bargain. Was she a sinner who must devote every penny topilgrimages—she was incredibly well traveled for a woman, visiting the mainsites throughout Europe—for fear that she was damned? In her mind, Margeryseemed to feel this way, and we are told cryptically that, when she was veryill, she confessed such dreadful things that her confessor ran from the room,refusing to absolve her or to tell anyone what she had said in his ear.Or was Margery genuinely visited by God? There are doubting mystics, after all,and one imagines her trying to get Julian to clear away these doubts. Which shedid, after a fashion. Unable to detect whether Margery’s various visions, fits,sweats, and public exhibitions were really from God, Julian took a simplercourse. She said that since Margery devoted herself to charity and other holyworks, the outcome of her strange state, half ecstasy, half madness, wasgoodness in the end.The fourteenth century is far away, but our existence has enough fears andthreats that “All shall be well” needs explaining. To the modern mind, callingthis an article of faith is hardly a defense. Nor is Julian saying that allshall be well when we die and arrive in heaven. What was revealed to her canbest be described as a state of awareness that is much more expanded thanordinary waking awareness. Placed in that state spontaneously, Julian saw sin,evil, and suffering in an entirely new light:Truth sees God, and wisdom beholds God, and of these two comes the third: thatis, a holy marveling delight in God; which is love.This new kind of seeing represents her experience of being united with a divinepresence that transformed her. The actual visions lasted only a few days, buttheir effect was permanent (reminding us that people today who have near-deathexperiences report that, having “gone into the light,” they return with no morefear of death).Julian’s new perspective revealed truths that by now will seem familiar toreaders from earlier chapters:In God’s sight all men are one man, and one man is all men.Suddenly is the soul united to God when it is truly at peace in itself.We may never come to the full knowing of God till we know first clearly our ownSoul. There is no mistaking that some mystics bring warnings from God, but Julianisn’t one of them. Her message is that God contains no wrath and that “we areHis joy and His delight, and He is our salve and our life.”It was also made clear to her that awareness of God implies a journey fromsuffering to unity, again a common theme in this book. How is this journeyundertaken? The ingredients are familiar and Christian. Julian advocates prayerand contemplation, and her chief mission is to reinforce faith in God’s love.This can feel disappointing. After the rush that comes when reading the greatmystics, readers can feel let down. “What about me?” is a natural question, andoften there is no answer. Or rather, the same conventional answers are givenover and over. In the East the advice shifts from prayer to meditation. Still,each seeker is left to walk the path alone.I think it’s healthy to turn disappointment on its head by realizing thatinspiration isn’t empty or momentary. In Julian and her like we have evidence ofpersonal transformation. We witness the workings of a different state ofawareness. Above all, the spiritual path acquires a human face. She is someonewho had to figure out, as every seeker must, how to live in the world with suchextraordinary knowledge.The more cosmic Julian becomes, the more extraordinary her state seems. A famouspassage in her text, The Showing of Love, begins with a tiny, everyday object:He showed me a little thing, the quantity of a hazel nut, lying in the palm ofmy hand, as it seemed. And it was as round as any ball.Being in a new state of awareness, Julian perceives that she’s holding the earthin the palm of her hand, much like William Blake several centuries later seeingthe world in a grain of sand. Blake also speaks of holding infinity in the palmof your hand. Julian uses the image to support her view of the divine:I looked upon it with the eye of my understanding, and thought, “What may thisbe?” And it was answered generally thus, “It is all that is made.”I marveled how it might last, for I thought it might suddenly have fallen tonaught for littleness. And I was answered in my understanding: It lasts and evershall, for God loves it. And so have all things their beginning by the love ofGod.The way that Julian connects the humble and the universal has given her messageits staying power. I doubt that anyone could read her experiences withoutfeeling close to her. The three surviving manuscripts of her book have beenprinted, as I understand it, for meditation in convents. There is no doubt thatit exists as a document of Catholic faith.What inspires us today is a direct account of an ordinary person suddenly seeingwith the eyes of the soul. Throughout the evolution of God, people yearn fortransformation. Each religion is like a training program for dropping the shellof mortality in order to live in the gleaming sheath of immortality. Whenreligions insist that only one training program works (and disbelievers will bepunished as heretics if they say otherwise), immortality gets lost in dogma. Buteach mystic who attests to her or his transformation gives hope. Julian ofNorwich found transformation in a setting of death and strife. But she is closerto us than Eastern mystics, and so her familiarity makes our own transformationseem more possible."},{"pageContent":"7 [toc01.xhtml#cha07]Giordano Bruno [toc01.xhtml#cha07]“Everything Is Light” [toc01.xhtml#cha07]The Church sent a larger-than-average gondola to pick up the prisoner in Venice.A twisted sign of respect? The glistening black hull was wide enough for fourmen. It was outfitted with chains to bind the prisoner’s chest and manacles forhis feet. Dressed in a dirty brown shift, the short, erect man stood quietly onthe lowest step of the quay, letting the waves of the Grand Canal wash over hisbare toes. The guards assigned to him were watching from inside the prison,where they were keeping out of the cold. Two other men stepped out of the boat,a jailer with keys dangling from his belt and a young Dominican priest, who keptstaring down nervously.“Get in,” the jailer ordered roughly. “Don’t move until I have you chained in.We don’t need a fool jumping ship.”Not looking at the jailer, the prisoner did as he was told. He focused hisattention on the young Dominican.“Your first?” he asked.“I don’t know what you mean, brother,” said the young priest, who was having ahard time getting back into the boat as it swayed on the water. He wasn’tcoastal born. This might have been the first boat he ever met with.The prisoner faintly smiled. “I should have been more specific. Your firstexcommunication? Inquisition? Conspiracy against the innocent? And don’t call mebrother. I’ve been defrocked several times, when it suited them.”“This one’s a talker,” the jailer grumbled, nodding to the gondolier, who pushedaway from the palazzo steps. The dawn sat on the horizon, blessing Venice theway wealth and beauty expect to be blessed. By now the prisoner was shackled andbound. He sat in the middle seat of the black lacquered boat with its grandlycarved prow.As they glided past a row of waterside palazzos, no one noticed an onlookerwearing a nightcap who had appeared at an upper window of one palazzo, no onebut Bruno, the condemned man they were carting to Rome. Tilting his head, heshouted with unexpected violence.“I’ve been despised by bigger men than you! I’ve been despised by kings.Tomorrow I will be despised by the Pope. Traitor, coward!”The man in the upper window scowled and backed away out of sight.“Quiet down. Honest folk are sleeping. I don’t want to have to gag you,” warnedthe jailer.“Honest folk are sweating between incestuous sheets, half of them,” said Bruno.He laughed to see the look on the priest’s face, then leaned forwardconfidentially. “That man who was staring down at us, he has no conscience. Iwas his friend, his teacher. But he condemned me to the bishop anyway, forspite. I woke up in his house one morning to see five ruffians storm the room.They thrust me into his garret before the officials came. He’ll go back to sleepnow, and at noon he’ll pay for a special Mass. Just in case being a Judas irksGod a little.”The young Dominican had been forewarned about the prisoner’s silver tongue. Hewas determined not to respond, but it was a long row to the mainland where aprison cart awaited. The gondolier, who was fat and belched garlic fumes, pulledlazily on his oar. He was in no hurry.“God is just. Perhaps you will find mercy,” said the priest, judging his wordscarefully. The jailer was in the employ of the papal see, and he had ears.Bruno twisted his mouth. “Don’t give yourself away. Sympathy with a heretic isthe same as being a heretic.”“And are you a heretic, then? Do you hate God?”“God?” Bruno eyed the young priest. “The last duke I served took an interest inme personally. He sat at my feet for months. Then he concluded that I had not ascrap of spirituality in me. I took it as a compliment, although the duke wasshocked. He drove me away from court by night in a cloaked carriage and hopednever to set eyes on me again.”Bruno paused. “You think me very confident for a condemned man.”“Not condemned yet,” corrected the priest.“As good as.”The canal soothed the waves that rolled in from the Adriatic. If you judged theChurch by the magnificent domes that rose around them, you’d think Venice wasparadise. A better paradise than Eden, since this one was swathed in silk andgold.Bruno fought the sway of the boat to sit bolt upright. “Can you smell thecorruption? I was being tried by the bishop of Venice, but that wasn’t safeenough. Now Rome demands my body. We both know what they intend to do with it.Have you ever heard your own bones crack? Nasty. Pardon me, I realize that theclergy isn’t used to hearing the truth.”The young priest wanted to retort that his whole life was devoted to the truth,but he shrank back. The prisoner’s rashness pushed at him like a fetid wind.For the rest of the trip over the water, no one in the gondola spoke. Theylanded at a small stone quay that was deserted except for the prison wagon.Before he could be hauled into it, Bruno jerked on his chains. The jailer’sattention was caught. The Dominican had already climbed up to a seat on top.“I want to say good-bye,” Bruno said.“Good-bye to who? There’s no one about.”“If you’re blind.”The prisoner enjoyed being an enigma, clearly. He knelt on the bare ground for along moment, placing his cheek against the earth. He couldn’t blame the earthfor his troubles. Perhaps the times were to blame. The plague scoured hisvillage when Bruno was a boy, under the shadow of Vesuvius near Naples. Turksraided the countryside and hauled away slaves. Your sister or daughter mightdisappear overnight. Crops withered, as if so much ill fortune deserved nothingless.Despite any such curse, the real blame was in his nature. Giordano Bruno’s soulwas inflamed by anger, zeal, curiosity—many things—yet his insatiable appetitefor fame is what goaded him into insanity. Insanity made him the most notoriousheretic in Europe. Not a simple insanity either, like the visions that poorwretches had, screaming about Satan with a goat’s head and fiery eyes. Brunowanted to be the most notorious heretic in Europe. He wouldn’t be satisfieduntil the Pope sent for him personally, and then what?They would have a brilliant conversation. Bruno would rise up and dazzle theHoly Father with his arguments. What were his faults in the Church’s eyes? Heheld that the earth moved around the sun. So did Copernicus, a Catholic, whileAristotle, a pagan, said no. Bruno had written other controversial things: thatinfinite stars shone in the sky, each one a planet with human life on it; thatall things were made of God, not just by God; that in every man, even thegrossest sinner, divine light is present.These notions were not heresies. They were truths. They had their own divinity,if only you opened your mind. Bruno could already see the admiring look in thePope’s eyes as he unwound his defense. A torrent of eloquence climaxedgloriously as the Holy Father shrank into his ermine-trimmed robes like afrightened child, while Bruno, brandishing his fist, cried, “See? I have provenit beyond the shadow of a doubt. I am not the heretic, since I worship thetruth. You are!”He felt a kick in the ribs that wasn’t soft. “Get up. You’ve kissed the mud longenough,” the jailer growled.Bruno’s fantasy was reluctant to vanish. Staggering to his feet, the mostnotorious heretic in Europe fixed the jailer with icy arrogance.“Take me to Rome, immediately. I have things to say.”The jailer, who was not just a clod, appreciated the act. He gave a mocking bowand opened the door to the prison wagon. Bruno stepped inside, ignoring thestench that filled the dank interior, which was lit by a single barred window onthe door. There were no seats. He sat on the filthy straw-covered floor whilethe jailer chained him to two iron rings hanging from the side of the wagon.“Apologies. We left Your Honor’s satin cushion behind.”The door slammed shut, and soon the transport was bouncing on the hard stoneroad that led down to the water. The January chill pierced the cracks in thewagon boards, but he thought better in the cold. His manacles were mercifullyloose, and except for the stench Bruno wasn’t in any great discomfort. This wasall a hopeful sign. The Church wanted him back. It wasn’t going to subject himto such degraded suffering that he couldn’t keep his mind intact.Even better, he was not pursued by the demon of despair. Even at that moment,sitting in the filth on the wagon floor, Bruno appreciated being alone with histhoughts. They were his one consoler, as they had been since he ran away tobecome a monk at fifteen, almost thirty years before. I am as safe as mythoughts, he told himself.The Inquisition in Venice had been going his way. He would have won, but one daythe courtroom was vacated, and the accused was informed that his case had beentransferred to Rome, by direct order. Even though the demon of despair nevervisited Bruno, it brushed him lightly when he heard the announcement. Rome meansdeath. He quickly swept the fear from his mind. He would talk about the starsone more time. Look at them. See what I see. The revolving heavens would savehim before the Church brought heaven crashing down on Bruno’s head. The journey to Rome took two days. The prisoner wasn’t fed or let out of thewagon, even for the call of nature. He slept hanging from his chains. A weakerman would have doubted that the Church still cared for him. To Bruno, theseprivations proved the opposite. His mind was so feared by the authorities thatthe court wanted him to be fatigued. They would find him more compliant thatway. This belief redoubled when the wagon had almost arrived at the destination.The wheels stopped with a lurch. The door was flung open, and in the brilliantsun of the south Bruno’s eyes were dazzled.He heard a horse stamping in the dust, then a shadow blocked out the sunlight.In jumped a stout man who made the wagon boards groan. Bruno blinked. The doorslammed shut, and they were off again.“Greetings.” In the dimness Bruno recognized the black cassock and sash of aJesuit. “I have the honor of escorting you the rest of the way, doctor. We’llhave you out of these unfortunate bonds soon. Water?”The Jesuit fumbled for a moment and then held a silver beaker to Bruno’s lips.The prisoner drank from it, but not desperately. If he was being greeted withdignity, Bruno would keep his as well.“Where are we going?” he asked when his mouth was moistened.“To the castello. A room awaits.”“Ah.”Bruno was too weakened to summon more than a syllable. The castello meant thathe was going to a most feared place, the Castel Sant’Angelo, a huge circularbulwark on the bank of the Tiber. It was built as the tomb of the emperorHadrian centuries ago, but he wasn’t the first man to enter and never emergeagain. Certainly not once the Inquisition took over the castle as the place fortorturing suspected heretics.If the Jesuit relished the shudder he had produced, he never indicated it. Heheld the silver beaker to Bruno’s lips until he had drunk it dry. Next heproduced a folded napkin and undid it to reveal some good bread and cheese,which he fed to the prisoner with surprisingly gentle care.“It’s sad that such things should go on between educated men,” said the Jesuit.“I would not use the word ‘inquisition’ in your presence, except that yourealize, with your clarity of intellect, that it refers only to an inquiry.Quaero, quaerere, quaesivi, quaesitum. Latin is so much easier.”From another mouth this turn of pedantry would have amused Bruno, but he felt achill.“We have assembled some papers,” the Jesuit went on. “Sign them, make a fewmodest statements before the Curia, and by nightfall we will share supper on thepiazza. The whole unfortunate affair will be cleared up.”Bruno nodded without reply. None was expected, apparently. The wagon, thechains, and the stench of his own excrement spoke for themselves. Any escaperoute would be eagerly seized.The dirt road turned to stone paving, then to round cobbles. The door was thrownopen, and the jailer, after letting the Jesuit out (the priest had pressed aperfumed handkerchief to his nose by now), unlocked Bruno and bodily hauled himinto the outside light, which was now growing toward dusk.“A coin for your kindness,” Bruno said. “My footman will pay you.”The joke produced a scowl from the jailer. The water and scrap of food hadraised Bruno’s spirits. The huge stone drum that loomed over him wasn’t sofrightening anymore. The castellated roof looked less like jagged fangs, thegreat iron doors less like a maw. Once inside, he was led to a well-lit roomwith a bed and chairs, not a cell. Moments later a servant in Vatican liverybrought in a tray with steaming soup in a tureen.The prisoner, if that is what he was, ate alone. Just before falling exhaustedonto the bed, he was visited again by the solicitous Jesuit.“Someone will bring you a suit of clothes in the morning. Throw the rags you’rewearing into the fireplace. The necessary papers can wait until afterbreakfast.”They exchanged smiles, although Bruno was cynical enough to know that he wasbeing toyed with. He gave a shrug inside. Recantation? He had done it oftenenough to escape prosecution. He might even delay signing the documents. Heenjoyed being put on trial, to tell the truth. It was pure theater, and thestage belonged to him. In Venice, his case had been important enough that theassigned judges weren’t a row of hand-me-down Jesuits sitting like crows over acorpse, but the bishop himself. For seven months Bruno had argued his case alongclever lines.“Your Excellency, if I have made mistakes regarding Our Lord, give me paper andtime. I will recant everything. But these mistakes were accidental.”The bishop, who ate in the same banquet halls that welcomed Bruno and seducedthe women he met there, looked doubtful.“Accidental? You have theology. You took your vows as a priest.”“When I was a mere boy. I did not mean I am without God. But God comes to us inmany ways, not to be reasoned. He came to me as a brilliant, shining light thatrevealed the secrets of the natural world, not the world hereafter. I am athinker, an observer, a philosopher. My mind is astonishingly abstract. Was Inot almost made professor of mathematics last year at Padua?”This was a good card to play. The times were not ignorant, and the Church hadmoved with the times, recognizing after a long, bloody struggle that theuniversities added to God; they were not his enemy. Bruno had mixed himself upin the struggle. If the year had been 1393 instead of 1593, he would have beensecreted away and killed immediately. At least now the Church paused to reflectbefore it condemned novel ideas.“The chair in mathematics went to Galileo in the end,” remarked the bishop witha tone of respect.“And Galileo is no more a priest than I am,” Bruno reminded the court. “He turnshis eyes to the stars, and so do I. Does it offend God if a man examines hishandiwork with awe and wonder? The font of reason cannot hate reason. Itglorifies Our Father to have creation explored by the mind of man.”Yes, he had done well in Venice. The doubters were silenced. If his old friendhad not turned murderously jealous, Bruno would have won.Morning came, and with it the new suit of clothes and the promised breakfast.Bruno ravenously tore at the bread and bacon, washed down with good grappa. Healmost wept to see sunlight pouring in through curtains instead of barredwindows. He had his back to the room when he heard the solicitous Jesuit enter,but when he turned around, there was no Jesuit, just two guards in polishedsteel helmets.“Where are the papers?” Bruno asked. His mind already knew that he had beentricked.Without reply the guards rushed at him and pinned his arms to his side. Onemuttered to the other in a rough dialect Bruno didn’t understand. They draggedhim into the corridor, allowing him to shout out protests without gagging hismouth. A door studded with iron bolts stood at the end of the corridor. Oneguard grabbed a smoky torch from a wall sconce while the other shoved Brunothrough the door. The flickering flame was just bright enough to keep him fromtripping down the stone stairs that appeared at his feet. The circular stairwelltook four twists; at the bottom stood a hooded figure with his arms folded overhis chest.Rome means death.Bruno refused to allow the thought to take hold. “This is a mistake. I’ve agreedto recant. Someone should have told you.”Without a word the hooded figure gave a nod, and Bruno felt his arms jerkedbackward. He winced as ropes were knotted around his wrists. The two guardsgrunted and went back up the winding staircase, taking the torch with them. Theyleft blackness behind, and despite his best efforts Bruno might have felt terrorat that moment, except that the hooded figure opened the shuttered lantern hewas carrying by his side. Its flickering beam led them down several corridors,around two corners. Bruno tried not to listen for groans.The hooded figure unlocked a small door and swung it open, stepping aside asBruno stooped to enter his cell. It wasn’t entirely black inside, thanks to anarrow sun well dug from the surface above. Before Bruno could turn around tosay something, the door behind him slammed shut, and a lock clanked mercilessly.With a moan the most notorious heretic in Europe sank to his knees. There was a knock on the door when they came for him. Bruno promised himself toshow courage in the face of torture, but he quaked anyway. Then he realized thattorturers wouldn’t knock. Someone was giving him time to pull himself together.Still bound, he did, as best he could, and opened the door to see the solicitousJesuit, a bland look on his round face.“May I?”Bruno bowed and stepped aside. By the light in the sun well, Bruno knew that hehad been in his cell for a night and a day. No one had brought food or water. Hewouldn’t complain. The Jesuits wanted to shock and demoralize him. If that wastheir game, he had to figure out one of his own.“I had a bishop as judge in Venice. I expect no less here in Rome,” he said,getting in the first word. Boldness in the face of degradation, that would be agood tactic.The Jesuit examined the cell carefully, as if he expected to find an upholsteredchair in the corner. Being stout, he was winded from the long twisting stairs.“If it comes to a trial,” he said smoothly, “we will supply a cardinal. But thisisn’t a trial, I assure you. The Holy Office has earned a reputation forcruelty, but really the Jesuits are the most learned and knowledgeable of allthe brothers in Christ. We understand, and where we do not understand, weeducate.”“Do the Jesuits consider me uneducated? That would be novel,” said Bruno.“Indeed. But not all of your learning seems directed toward God.”Bruno began to feel more at ease. This was sounding like a debate, and heexcelled at debating. A guard appeared at the door. He loosened the ropes thatbound Bruno’s wrists behind his back. The muscles had grown so weak that hisarms flopped by his side once they were loosened, feeling cold and lifeless. Butafter a moment Bruno could rub his hands together. He practiced this while theguard led the way up the stairs to the main hall of the castle.The Jesuit motioned toward a side room, where four other Jesuits were waiting.They didn’t line up behind a bench like a tribunal, but sat around incomfortable chairs. The room gave off a warm smell of mocha and anise rolls, asif Bruno were slightly late for breakfast. He felt a gnawing ache in the pit ofhis stomach. Out of the corner of his eye he saw one of the Jesuits wipe hismouth with a linen napkin.“Ah, good. We shall talk. We shall all be comfortable,” this priest said. He wasolder than the others and apparently in charge.Boldness, Bruno reminded himself.He pointed to a bowl filled with fruit on a side table. “We all want this to endquickly. My defense is simple. I need an apple.”The Inquisition had been examining heretics since the twelfth century, enoughtime that nothing surprised them. Bruno could have begged, pleaded, wept, orcried out to God. Thousands of doomed unbelievers had done so, but he was thefirst to ask for an apple, if he correctly read the surprise that he caused.Without waiting for anyone to move, Bruno strode to the table and whirledaround, holding up the cold fruit, which had been spending the winter in acellar.“Who made this apple? The Creator. How did he make it? Red, round, crisp, andsweet. Tell me, have I committed heresy by saying those words? Does ‘red’ offendGod’s ears? Is ‘round’ against canon law? Are ‘crisp’ and ‘sweet’ evilincantations used to summon the Devil?”He held the apple higher as his gaze sternly swept the room. “No, of course not.I have described what is to be seen in this apple, as I have described what Isee in the skies. I lecture on mathematics and many other subjects. Kings havesummoned me to teach them my famous methods in memory. Queen Elizabeth ofEngland may be a damned Protestant, but we didn’t discuss theology. She isgrowing old, and she wanted instruction in how to remember the names of all hercourtiers. I politely obliged.”Several of the Jesuits nodded, just the way the bishop of Venice had. So it wastheater once more. Bruno paused for a second to gather his dramatic powers, butthe senior priest interrupted.“We don’t care.”“What?”The priest rose to his feet, padded over to the coffeepot, and poured a steamingcupful into his demitasse. “We don’t care how clever you are. You defendedyourself in Venice by claiming to know nothing of theology.”He wheeled on the prisoner with a bland expression and two cutting words. “Nothere.”Bruno felt strong enough to hold back his anxiety. “You are saying that thisapple offends God?”“I am saying that you offend God. Or are you so vain and puffed up that you’veforgotten your own words?” Balancing his cup in one hand, the senior Jesuitpulled a paper from his waistband, squinting a little as he read it:“ ‘The true aim in life should be illumination, true morality the practice ofjustice’.”“Yes, I wrote that, but what could be wrong—”The priest cut him off. “Let me finish. ‘The true redemption should be theliberation of the soul from error, so that it can reach union with God’.”Bruno saw that his accuser had screwed up his face, but his own words moved him,and he blurted out, “Beautiful!”“Horrible,” the Jesuit snapped back. “Can you stand there hearing your vileheresy and not see hell?”Bruno felt the blood drain from his face. Suddenly the room was colder, and heswayed as if his spine had softened.“No,” he muttered softly.The senior priest eyed him with an indecipherable look. Taking his seat, henodded to the solicitous Jesuit, who seemed to function as bailiff.“Giordano Bruno, the defendant,” he began, assuming a formal voice as he stoodup. “Witnesses have sworn that you returned to Italy to teach magic and initiatestudents into the supernatural arts. You traveled in Protestant lands to preachagainst the one true Church. You converted to Calvinism to curry favor and thensuffered excommunication by the Protestants when they could no longer abide yourlies. Your books teach a new religion that you call ‘light,’ which is anabomination to the correct faith established by the blessed Jesus Christ.”The accusations would have kept on unfurling, but the senior Jesuit raised hishand.“As you can see, Bruno, apples won’t save you.”The others smiled at the witticism. Bruno felt the urge to scream, butdesperation hadn’t blinded his reason. His predicament tightened around histhroat. He had followed the divine light. He had believed that all sins aresteps away from the light, all redemption steps toward it. He longed for the daywhen he would be one with God. Nothing else mattered.There were heretics as numerous as fish in the sea, damned by false witness,conspiracy, intrigue, and jealousy. A few saved themselves, if they knew whichway to twist. But Bruno was doomed by something far worse. He had cursed himselfbefore God by seeing the truth. He was right about one thing: when the torturers came, they didn’t knock. TheHoly Office ordered soft torments at first. He had a rag stuffed in his mouthwhile water was poured into his nose. From the outside this looked like nothing,but to the victim it created a panic unto death. Water gave way to steel tongs,hot coals, rocks pressed on his chest. The torturers never pressed Bruno so hardor heated the coals so hot that he was in danger of dying.The first year was spent this way, breaking his body. When Bruno was draggedbefore the four Jesuits again, still seated in armchairs before the fireplace,they asked if he had anything new to tell them.“I would like a diploma in pain. You can’t say that I haven’t applied myself.”So the process of breaking him continued. To the Holy Office, torturing aheretic had a spiritual purpose: mercy. Was it not merciful to force out demons,so that a purified soul might stand before God? This kind of mercy ran a fewrisks. Among the accused, a few would be innocent, yet they tended to confessevery kind of horrible sin even before their last fingernails had been pluckedout with pincers. The guilty too made lurid false confessions once they werehung from leather straps until their shoulders dislocated. It was necessary tokeep on hanging them until their confessions were reasonable. So the logic went.After the second year Bruno was shrunk to a collection of seeping wounds andscars. He could no longer walk, and it was hard to understand his speech becauseit was generally expressed as animal moans. The Holy Office reconsidered thecase. The accused had refused to recant, despite all persuasions. Fear of therack would reduce him to begging, and during those times he would confess to afew pitiful errors. But the heresies in his books were too many and tooflagrant. Worse, the people had sympathy for him. The word “martyr” was beingwhispered.One day Bruno looked up to see a new priest, lean and young, standing in hiscell. The clanking lock and the creak of the door hadn’t awakened himimmediately. Bruno spent uncounted hours sleeping; the difference between nightand day meant nothing anymore. The only reason he sat up was that the newcomer’shabit wasn’t Jesuit. His swollen eyelids prevented him from making out anythingmore.The priest, a Dominican, knelt beside the iron cot. “They’ve allowed me to visityou and bring food. Here.” He held out a basket of provisions. “I’m deeply sorryfor you, brother. Ah, I forgot. You didn’t want me to call you that.”Pain never left him, but as his eyes cleared, Bruno recognized the youngDominican from Venice.“They’re trying a new tactic. You’re it,” Bruno said.“I’m not one of them. Do you know how dangerous it is for me to say thosewords?”Bruno gave a dry, hoarse laugh. “So the tactic is to be subtle. Good. Talk on.”With a feeble kick he knocked over the basket. “Take your Judas offering whenyou go.”“You must eat.”“Only the living must eat. I am already dead. It has just taken a long time forthe news to reach God.”Carefully the priest gathered up the spilled bread and sausage, putting themback in the basket. “We never really met. I’m Father Andrea. I’m here to consoleyou.”Bruno held out his hand, made crooked and deformed by bones that were broken toooften to heal. “Console this,” he said.Father Andrea’s eyes widened. “Do you have no faith left at all? ‘Even faith thesize of a mustard seed—’”Harshly Bruno cut him off. “You dare? Get out!”He threw the basket at the priest’s head, sending the provisions flying. Theylooked at each other silently, the only sound being the scurry of rats, whocouldn’t believe that food suddenly fell from the sky.Father Andrea murmured, “I am your only hope.”“The dead don’t need hope.”And so the first meeting ended. But the virtue of patience was strong in theDominican. He returned every day. He was willing to sit for hours while Brunoturned his face to the wall, refusing to acknowledge his visitor. Finally, oneday was different. When the priest entered the cell, Bruno was pacing back andforth restlessly, as if his legs had healed overnight.“I will talk with you. Do you know why?”Father Andrea smiled. “You have care for your soul.”Bruno laughed. He sounded bizarrely merry. “No. I understand immortality now,for the first time, and I need to tell someone before they kill me. Something soprecious cannot go to waste.”The priest looked crestfallen, but his patience didn’t falter. “Go on.”Bruno became more animated. “I will unfold something stupendous. You see, I havegone beyond death. As the body withers, the soul expands. More and more I amblind to this world. It is dissolving, vanishing like a wisp of smoke. Lastnight, God held out immortality to me.”Bruno’s rheumy eyes burned and overflowed with tears. “But I didn’t take it.I’ve returned to tell the world what I know. You must pay attention. Do youunderstand?”This mixture of vanity and madness made Father Andrea’s heart sink, but he keptquiet.“The secret of immortality lies with God,” Bruno began, “but what is God? Inthese times, no one is safe who asks that question, even though it occurs toevery child. The only difference is that I never stopped asking. I couldn’t.”Sorrowfully Father Andrea said, “Perhaps it was a good question with evilconsequences.”“I don’t believe that. To question God is to move closer to him.”“And closer to danger.”Bruno gave a wry smile. “No doubt. Try to accept that I was not led by Satanwhen I questioned God. I am a man of the age, and in this age we want to knoweverything. My obsession with God brought answers, and the Jesuits cannot forceme into denying that these answers were divine.”Bruno raised his hand. “I know you want to object, but let me finish. Ifeverything was made by God, then God is in everything. We cannot limit theInfinite. Therefore, God is in every creature, every hill and tree, and everyperson. Why don’t we see the God in us? Because the light has been pushed awayby ignorance and error. This much I realized before I was betrayed in Venice.”Father Andrea couldn’t control himself. “The Church teaches none of this. Youare stepping on sacred ground, where you don’t belong.”“Peace. I have only a little more. When I was thrown into this hole, Idespaired. Not for my life, because it befits a wise man to accept death calmlyand sometimes to seek it. Yet in my agony something else happened. As my bodywas destroyed, the light shone brighter. The joke is on the Jesuits. Theirtorments stripped away all my fears, for nothing can be worse than the worst.Beyond the horror of pain I found the light I have searched for, and I wasbathed in it until, all at once, I became the light.”The fervor in Bruno’s voice caused the priest to bury his face in his hands; theprisoner was spelling his own doom. Bruno tugged at Father Andrea’s arm, makinghim look up.“You live for the truth, yes? If your vows mean anything, report that you didnot see madness in my eyes or the burning gaze of a demon. The light is thetruth. It is in all things, and when we know this, we can work back to thelight. Nothing else is needed. The stink and hypocrisy of the Church aremeaningless. I should have excommunicated the Pope long ago. But the lightembraces even the worst among men. Even a Pope can be saved.”After this, the Dominican paid no more visits. He was bound to report Bruno’swords to the Holy Office. They had enough evidence to condemn him then andthere. But Bruno’s cause was becoming scandalous, and the Jesuits retreated intosilence. No word was issued about the proceedings, and for seven years hisimprisonment continued. There were more tortures, more interrogations. To theimmense irritation of the tribunal, Bruno stood firm in his refusal to recant.It would have taken a brave lawyer months to untangle the convoluted chargesagainst Bruno, which kept changing—bravery was needed because the lawyer couldfind himself thrown into prison too. Bruno had no lawyer at all. He lapsed intostubborn, weary silence, listening apathetically to the rigmarole of obscureLatin. On the days when he had just been tortured, his head lolled against hischest; he sat in court half conscious and moaning.Finally the day came when people had forgotten the scandal. Seven years into histrial, Bruno was hauled before a cardinal, just as the senior Jesuit hadpromised that first day. The flash of red in the prelate’s costume glowed in thedim courtroom.“Does the prisoner have anything to say before the sentence is pronounced?”Bruno was a gaunt shell, with no bone left unbroken. He raised his head.“Nothing.”The court wasted no time with solemn gestures. Bruno was sentenced to burn atthe stake immediately, after a spike was driven through his blasphemous tongueand his heretical mouth was closed with an iron cage.He listened with a pensive look. “I believe you are more afraid to sentence methan I am to hear it,” he said.This was taken as one last impudence from a man who was determined to bereckless his entire life. The cardinal rose, casting a contemptuous glance. Ifhe replied to Bruno’s taunt, it was not recorded.The burning took place at the Campo de’ Fiori, a large and crowded flowermarket. Business stopped only briefly for the spectacle. The iron cage clampedaround his jaw prevented Bruno from crying out, although his body writhed in theflames. An impudent priest—or perhaps an impostor who had stolen a cassock—daredto jump on the woodpile to hold a crucifix before Bruno’s eyes. He turned hishead away, and Vatican guards quickly pulled the priest off the pyre to drag himfrom the scene.When the heretic’s body was consumed to ashes, the crowd had scattered. Anunknown member of the clergy took a handful of ash and scattered it to thewinds, where it disappeared in the Roman twilight like a thin wisp of smoke.Revealing the VisionWith the life and death of Giordano Bruno two worlds crash into each other, andthe reverberations are still with us. Faith and science began as enemies,because facts threatened to depose faith. This threat was clear to the Churchauthorities who pounced on scientific breakthroughs as if they were heresies. Afact cannot be a heresy unless you force it to be. One can conceive of a Churchthat welcomes science as a new way to glorify God’s creation. The Church couldhave permitted God to be a rational Creator working through natural laws. Thiswasn’t the Church that Bruno tried to accommodate, either by blending in as amonk, teaching as a professor, or prodding as a scientist.One problem with all of his tactics was that Bruno had many mad ideas—hisaristocratic pupil in Venice betrayed him to the Inquisition, because Brunorefused to teach him the supernatural arts. Bruno considered himself an expertin these arts; he toyed with “magical mathematics.” You have to pick through ajumble of fantasy and speculation to arrive at Bruno’s revolutionaryspirituality; but once you arrive, his insights still amaze.He saw what other mystics had seen, that nature is a field of light emanatingfrom the Godhead. But what makes Bruno revelatory is that he depended, not onfaith, but sheerly on the mind to see what he saw. He stands for the human mindas a part of God’s mind. Today we still struggle over whether spirituality isconsistent with reason. To be a scientist doesn’t automatically make you anatheist. But it does send you into the swampy ground where faith can sink underyou like quicksand.When Bruno was burned at the stake on February 17, 1600, it was a bright morningbustling with flower sellers in a busy Roman market. One can almost imaginehousewives in aprons buying winter roses. His case had grown infamous, so whatcame from the crowd was probably a mixture of jeers and tears. It was the finalcurtain in a long, cruel, slow drama that had lasted seven years. Bruno wasimportant enough as a thinker to survive this long; his recantation meantsomething to the Pope and the Holy Office.And the court’s judgment, holding that Bruno had denied the divinity of Christ,wasn’t a mistake. He had flirted with the Arian heresy, which questioned whetherChrist was equal to God. But it’s unlikely that this was more than a passingphase in Bruno’s mental journey—which was fickle, daring, inspired, ridiculous,noble, and bizarre, depending on where you try to pin it down. He is rememberedtoday as a martyr for intellectual freedom, especially by scientists, who grouphim with Kepler and Galileo, brave followers of the new astronomy that beganwhen Copernicus declared that the earth moved around the sun.One thing Bruno wasn’t is a scientist. In his lifetime he was best known for asystem of mnemonic techniques that interested even kings and queens, such asElizabeth I in England. As a personality he wasn’t able to please those inpower, however, and he managed to alienate every court he attached himself to,sometimes getting driven out of the country. He was a contrarian, and those whoremembered him said he was introverted and inclined to be melancholy.In the end, after his gruesome death, the piteous tale of Giordano Bruno becamean symbol, but an ambiguous one. I was drawn to the mystical side of him.Inspired by the new discoveries being made in the stars and planets, Bruno’smind took astonishing leaps. He was convinced that there were infinite worlds;life existed on these worlds and perhaps even angels. Instead of being fixed onthe seventh day of God’s creation, nature was constantly in motion. In fact, thecosmos was probably expanding at a fantastic rate, which means that creation isa continuing process. Taking such leaps enabled Bruno to sound amazingly like acontemporary of ours, as when he writes:Everywhere there is incessant relative change in position throughout theuniverse, and the observer is always at the center of things.That’s Bruno putting on his scientist’s cap, but there was not enough science inhis day to warrant such a daring leap. His real journey was toward thetranscendent, the field of light that in his mind was merged with God, nature,and the starry night sky:The Divine Light is always in man, presenting itself to the senses and to thecomprehension, but man rejects it.As the future unfolded, the domains of science got sorted out. Astronomy wasseparated from astrology. Evolution replaced Genesis. So it’s natural that Brunocan’t be a martyr for both camps—unless. In that small word “unless” anotherrevolution could be taking place. As modern people, we inherited the scientificrevolution. The conquest of superstition is part and parcel of that revolution,as is the separation of reason from unreason. It sends a shudder to read thatmore witches were burned in England after the death of Shakespeare in 1616 thanbefore; such hysterical persecution wasn’t just happening in Salem,Massachusetts.For four hundred years we have moved away from Bruno’s field of light only tocome full circle. The unit of light is the photon, and physics recognizes thatall interactions responsible for matter and energy in the cosmos involve thephoton. In other words, human beings exist in the field of light, and ourbodies, quite literally, came from stardust. Going even farther, some farsightedphysicists wonder if the universe has a mind; to them, it acts like a livingbeing as it evolves and develops more and more complex forms. The human brain,so far as we know, is the most complex thing in existence. Was it really aproduct of random chance over the past 13 billion years? To believe inrandomness as the only creative force in nature, one physicist quipped, is likesaying that a hurricane blew through a junkyard and built a Boeing 777.I lament that the two key words “intelligent” and “design” got hijacked byreligious fundamentalism for the purpose of defending the creation story foundin Genesis. There is no doubt that Genesis is actually a creation myth, and abeautiful one. It exists to tell us about ourselves at a mythical level; forthat, it doesn’t need to be rejected. More fascinating is a liberated view ofintelligence and design, which could lead to a cosmos reborn.Bruno was a witness to the last time that happened. In the rebirth of theuniverse thanks to Copernicus, Bruno had the most expanded vision ofpossibilities. He makes statements that could be straight from Shankara and theancient Vedic tradition in India:I understand Being in all and over all, as there is nothing withoutparticipation in Being.It is our loss that Being has ceased to be a mystery, as it was for Bruno andall mystics. “To be” seems like a given, a blank. “I am” simply means that youare present. Being suddenly acquires its mystery once more, however, when youdip into modern physics and discover that the entire universe emerged from avoid. This theme arises frequently as we touch on the visionaries in this book,and yet it must be emphasized that the void that preceded the universe is afact. Everything that looks solid and familiar is actually the product ofmystery.The noted English neurologist Sir John Eccles makes this point with starkclarity: “I want you to realize that there exists no color in the natural world,and no sound—nothing of this kind; no textures, no patterns, no beauty, noscent.” Every quality in nature is the opposite of reassuring; it belongs tothe reality illusion that we surround ourselves with. When two lovers holdhands, it seems as if two warm, pliant objects are enfolding, but that is pureillusion. Every sensation is created in our own awareness from invisibleproperties like electromagnetism. In fact, the atoms that are the buildingblocks of the universe have no physical properties at all; therefore, nothingmade of atoms can be physical either.Bruno was a rare combination of mystic and rationalist, which enabled him tograpple very early on with the reality illusion. He had been thrown out of theDominican order, but remained intent upon God, and he assumed that when hetalked about nature, he was talking about God at the same time.There is no being without Essence. Thus nothing can be free of the DivinePresence. . . . Nature is none other than God in things.Is that last sentence literally true? Looking for “God in things,” we no longerapply the lens of Christianity, yet there is no doubt that the search remainsthe same. What lens do we need? There are many answers floating around thescientific and spiritual community; some optimists believe the two will jointogether once they recognize that they are after the same unicorn: a vision ofGod and nature that erases all boundaries and yields the final answer tonature’s riddles.If that happens, Bruno’s tale will find its justification, not as a martyr’stale to be pitied, but a seer’s to be celebrated. To redeem him fully, we haveto accept another of his visionary sayings: “It is manifest . . . that everysoul and spirit hath a certain continuity with the spirit of the universe.”Bruno saw this truth with a courageous clarity we can only envy. In time God wasallowed to become a rational Creator. The Church regretted its persecutionphase, and today it is permissible to preach that facts glorify God’s marvelousworks. But as he evolved to make peace with gravity and thermodynamics, God isstill frowning over stem cells and the first days of life in the womb—or so theChurch holds. The truce between faith and facts remains uneasy."},{"pageContent":"8 [toc01.xhtml#cha08]Anne Hutchinson [toc01.xhtml#cha08]“Spirit Is Perfect in Every Believer” [toc01.xhtml#cha08]The mother stood on the shore with eleven children gathered around her andspread her arms.“Behold Leviathan!”It was hard not to behold a beached whale, and much harder not to smell it. Thestinking carcass was an unusual find, washed up from the schools of whales thatspouted like an Italian fountain garden off the Massachusetts coast. The localnatives (who were feared as “the savages” no matter how peaceful they acted) hadrushed to the scene ahead of the colonists. They lacked boats big and strongenough to launch into the teeming pods. But when a dead whale washed ashore, atime of plenty had arrived.Some braves straddled the back of the massive gray beast with long spears,slicing off swaths of flesh that flopped with a smack on the sand. Women kneltwith small stone blades to carve away chunks of meat for drying.“Do you know what this means?” the mother asked, addressing her flock like ateacher.“It means their tribe will eat this winter,” said Bridget, one of the olderdaughters.“If they don’t rob our barns first,” muttered Francis, one of the middle sons,who resented being dragged across the sea to please God. Dreaming about asweetheart in England, he had spent the summer digging rocks out of theso-called soil on a farm outside Boston.The mother frowned. “Think not of this world. Surely this is a sign.”The Hutchinson brood, which was excited to see their first dead whale, quieteddown. They knew, even down to the tiniest, that their mother could find a sermonin anything. She had already found one as they picked their way over the rockybeach. It began, “And the Lord said to Joshua, ‘Take up twelve stones from theriver Jordan’ ” and continued until they reached the spot where the whale laystewing in the unseasonal heat.If Anne Hutchinson could make a sermon from stones, she wouldfeast—theologically speaking—on a whale. She pointed at it, entirely ignoringthe smell, the half-naked savages clambering around, and the possibility thatvisitors from the Puritan colony might not be welcome.“What is Leviathan?” Anne asked. “The Bible tells us.”“One of the seven princes of hell,” a boy in the back piped up.“And is this dumb creature before us a prince of hell?” asked Anne.“He could be a princess, if he’s not a he,” suggested Katherine, one of theyoungest girls.Anne smiled. “The Bible speaks only of princes, child.” She decided to answerher own question, since the urge to sermonize was growing impatient. “No, thiscreature is not a prince of hell. But the Bible tells us that Leviathan wasguilty of pride, and thus is pride fallen here. No fish is prouder than thewhale, which rules the sea. Yet this one was smitten, and now he has becomecarrion for any passing dog.”None of her children complained as Anne discoursed. They had arrived in the NewWorld the year before, 1634, to join the new Eden that God had ordered them topopulate. Back in England the only reality they had ever known was Puritan. Aserious and godly reality, in the extreme. Everyone they saw at church wasexercised over the corruption of the Anglican clergy. All hated the papists andreviled King Charles for marrying a Catholic queen, or whore, as the Puritansopenly called her. Nobody crossed themselves or prayed to saints, as theirAnglican neighbors did. None of them venerated the Virgin Mary or knelt beforethe cross as they entered a pew.But the oldest Hutchinson children did know that having a sermonizing mother wasunusual. The most ambitious preachers in Boston, in their long black frockcoats, gave Anne Hutchinson a wide berth when it came to scripture. She was pastforty, not young and no longer of girlish features. It would never have occurredto her to wear makeup to disguise her years, just as, being a Puritan, she worehonest black and brown. Fancy colors were vanity. But her face glowed when sherecited scripture; in repose she showed the strain of bearing fourteen childrenand burying three. Since she wore a tight cap that covered her hair, the linesin her face stood out. So did her piercing eyes.At this moment, without preparation, she began reciting twenty verses onLeviathan from the book of Job, beginning, “‘Can you pull in the leviathan witha fishhook or tie down his tongue with a rope? Can you put a cord through hisnose or pierce his jaw with a hook?’”Her husband, William, came up over the dunes; he had lingered behind to arrangethe return coach to Boston. Winded and unprepared for the stench, he stopped tocatch his breath. He was close enough to hear Anne reciting, and it made himsmile. He had money, many children, and, rarest of all, a wife who knew as muchas any man about the Bible. The younger daughters giggled when their motherreached this verse: “ ‘Can you make a pet of him like a bird or put him on aleash for your girls?’ ”Anne was a tolerant preacher, unlike some, and she merely raised a finger. “Hereis what I want you to especially notice, my dears. ‘Who would approach him witha bridle? Who dares open the doors of his mouth, ringed about with his fearsometeeth?’ ”She paused expectantly, and when none of her children spoke up, their fatherfilled the breach. “What your mother means,” he said, half walking, half fallingdown the steep dunes, “is that Leviathan guarded the mouth of hell. So thewhale’s enormous mouth was given by God as a sign of the trap that awaits allsinners.”“Nothing less,” said Anne. “How marvelous is the book of Creation, and howblessed that God has opened it to us.”William liked the look of contentment that spread over her face. She saw God’shand in everything, which was the Puritan way. To trip over a curb or drop anegg meant that you needed to examine your spotted soul. Calamity and persecutionhad made the Puritans search for the tiniest grain of sin in themselves. Thefarmers joked that every spring brought a new crop of stones in their fields. Itwas a grim joke at that, and secretly a few saints, as they called each other,doubted if God approved of their errand in the wilderness.The first to throw their fate to Providence, the Pilgrims had landed fifteenyears before, in 1620. Prying sod from the ground to build huts, they couldn’thave foreseen Hutchinson’s fine white timber house in the center of Boston.Their grim records from that first year were terse, but horrifying.In December, bitter weather had set in, far worse than anything known inEngland. On December 25, the hardiest settlers departed the Mayflower to live onshore. The date wasn’t significant, since they didn’t observe Christmas, whichwas invented by the papists in Rome.Six people died that month, eight more in January. Seventeen perished inFebruary. What was killing them? For some, it was voluntary starvation asmothers gave their rations to their children. Thirteen of eighteen married womendied; only three children did. The rest died of scurvy or of a plague no onecould name. They would simply whisper “the sickness” when another fell victim.God was not smiling.Still the settlers built their crude shelters and still they prayed, everywaking minute that could be spared. It wasn’t until the first day of spring thatthe last Pilgrims came off the boat, and even as March warmed, thirteen moredied. Burials were conducted at night under the cloak of darkness, for fear thatthe savages would become bolder if they saw how the number of intruders haddwindled. (Not that the Indians showed their faces; that first winter theylurked like shadows in the forest.) Looking around the Plymouth graveyard, thesurvivors counted forty-five graves, almost half their number. The mouth ofhell, reflected William Hutchinson, had opened on that beach too.Unless it was the mouth of heaven. When they were alone he’d consult Anne, whohad a gift for reading God’s tests and rewards. The family spread a cloth on thehill overlooking the beach, picking a spot away from the smell. It was apleasant outing, and the children got a surprise at the end, a bit of honey topour over their bread. But as clouds moved in from the sea and they quickly roseto pack up and retreat to the wagons, a fleck of color caught Anne’s eye.Katherine, who tended to be dreamy, had taken a pink ribbon from her doll’sdress and tied it into her own hair. Anne stared for a second, controlling heranger.“Give that here, child,” she said, holding out her hand.Katherine knew that when Mother spoke in a flat, quiet voice, something bad hadhappened. She handed over the offending ribbon and forced herself not to cry.The walk back to the wagons was somber. The clouds had quickly gathered into agray blanket overhead; drops began to fall.They were lucky, and the shower was light, not enough to penetrate the homespuncloaks they bundled their heads in. Addressing no one in particular, Anne said,“Jezebel. We shall speak of her. Anyone can go first.”None of the other children spoke up, since it was obvious that Katherine neededto answer, even if she was barely seven.“Jezebel was an evil queen who worshipped idols,” said Katherine. “And she wasan adult.”Seven wasn’t too young to hear about adultery, but perhaps too young to befocused on it. Anne let the mistake pass. “The queen tried to kill the prophetElijah,” she said, “but the Lord killed Jezebel instead. Nothing escapes hiseye, even the most innocent transgression.”Fingering the pink ribbon, she unfolded a tale of miracles and gore. Jezebel,the wife of Ahab, was intent on destroying the God of Israel, so that her falsegod, Baal, might be victorious. She gathered 450 prophets of Baal to contest oneprophet of the Israelites, Elijah. Empowered by the Lord, Elijah proposed asimple test to prove who was the real God. A fire sacrifice would be mounted.The 450 prophets of Baal built an immense pyre of offerings and prayed to Baalto send fire to set it alight. Their voices arose in a loud chorus of pleading,and when no fire came, they cut their flesh with knives. But even the blood ofpriests brought nothing from their god.Elijah had built a small pyre, and to show his supreme confidence he poured abeaker of water on it three times. Lifting his eyes, Elijah asked God to senddown fire, and in an instant the pyre was ablaze. Jezebel was foiled; she neverforgot the insult.“She plotted against Elijah,” said Anne, “but her evil was to no avail. In timeJezebel was trampled to death by horses and her body eaten by dogs.”“Except for her skull and the palms of her hands,” interjected one of the boys,who was eager for biblical tests.“Except for them,” nodded Anne, taking Katherine’s doll and tying the pinkribbon around its waist again. The little girl had images that night of dogschewing on the corpse of a bedizened queen sporting pink ribbons in her hair.The gore didn’t disturb mother or child. As a child herself in England, Anne hadheard bloody readings from books of martyrs. They fascinated her, and she couldcalmly munch on a teacake while looking at engravings of a saint’sdisembowelment. It was only natural to sympathize with martyrs since her ownfather, a preacher with outspoken Puritan leanings, had been imprisoned andconvicted of heresy for defying official church authority. The family was insore deprivation during the period when he was under house arrest.The worse the Puritans were persecuted, the more righteous they became. The linebetween themselves and everyone else became hard and fast in the New World. Acommonwealth had been established to look out for everyone’s good, but thesaints, as they called each other, would never be like the strangers, asnon-Puritans were known. No one kept the line more definite than Anne, until shemade a mistake and suddenly being a saint was not so scandalously easy asbefore. For now, the crisis was waiting in the wings, not yet ready to occur. It would be awhile before the newborn baby, crying and thrashing as it enteredthe world, asked, “Am I saved or am I damned?” For the moment, he was simplybeautiful. Anne wrapped the infant in swaddling clothes and handed it around.The mother, exhausted from labor, had fallen asleep. But she was safelyattended. At least ten other women assembled for the birth, in an informalceremony known as a gossiping. They cooed over the new little boy. Anne, asleader of the group, was well satisfied. She knew that there was a danger thatthe mother, the child, or both might die in the coming weeks. It was importantto have pure attendants to keep that from happening.“Send word to the father, all is well,” she told one of the women, who scurriedfrom the room. Anne was in her element and happy to be there. She looked around.“In what condition is this child come into the world?” she asked.The other women knew that they were about to hear a pronouncement, and they wereeager to.“First, it is born into freedom from oppression and the reach of kings, unlikeour dear Lord, who was forced to flee Herod’s wrath,” Anne began. If anyone inthe room wondered how Boston could be out of the reach of King Charles, shedidn’t say so. Defiance to the crown was a popular stand.“In its condition, this baby arrives in the company of the righteous,” saidAnne. “We have determined our own fate, as a free congregation. But none of thiswill matter if a baby carries the stain of sin into this world. Look at him.Where is the stain? What has he done, weak and helpless as a kitten, to deserveGod’s censure?”This was the nub of the question, and one could hear a nervous cough in thebackground. But the women would protect her, no matter what she said in thatroom. The Puritan men knew this, and Anne counted on it. The newborn had beenpassed around the circle and came back to her. She kissed its forehead. To thewomen around Anne this was all but a benediction.“So he is saved?” one of the younger women asked.“I hope so,” Anne murmured. “But Christ spoke to me to tell me that I am saved,and that is a path open to everyone. Spirit is gracious, and spirit is perfectin every believer.”Christ had spoken to her personally? The women in the birthing room were awed.An outsider could be forgiven for taking Anne innocently. Grace and spirit werecommon coin in every church. But to the Puritans these were loaded terms,fraught with danger and hope. Those sojourners who had braved the ocean crossingwere betting their souls in a cosmic wager. To the naked eye the Puritans hadlanded in a trap, exchanging the familiar world of home for a savage wilderness.But home was a fouled nest. Here at least they could sit apart as the elect,favored by God to build a city on the hill.With one sticking point. When strangers, non-Puritans, landed in America, theycould strike out individually and damn the consequences. The saints could onlysucceed by holding together.Every Sunday Boston’s preachers leaned over the pulpit dangling torment anddamnation. “Work, work, work! Toil ceaselessly for your souls, brothers andsisters. If any of you slip, the fiery pit yawns open for us all.”The sticking point is that you never knew if your toil had succeeded. Originalsin was an invisible stain even on the freshest newborn baby, and for the restof his life only God knew if that baby was one of the elect or one of thedamned.Anne had grown up knowing no other theology. Her father took her by the hand oneday when she was seven or eight. He wasn’t yet the firebrand who would getthrown into prison for his sermons against the bishops. The family livedpeaceably in London, and it was a short walk to the Thames.Her father pointed to the south across the brown sluggish water. “Tell me whatyou see,” he said.Anne craned her neck over the parapet that lined the shore. “Little boats, bigboats. Men fishing. And those pretty flags,” she said, pointing to the theatersin Southwark, on the opposite bank, that ran up their pennants on sunny days tosignal that a performance would be held. They were woven of bright colors andsported emblems of lions and mythical beasts.“Not pretty flags, my child,” her father corrected. “Across the river is Sodom,where sin brazenly announces itself. There, the wicked tempt those who are aninch away from turning wicked.”Nothing showed the divide between the elect and the damned as much as thetheaters, which in the eyes of Puritans were a sinkhole of depravity. Diversionsand entertainments were diabolical tricks. Even on the rare occasion when adecent religious drama might be staged—not the disgusting works of a Devil’sdisciple like Shakespeare—the theaters were surrounded by inns wheredrunkenness, gambling, bearbaiting, and cockfights took place every night. Anhonest citizen could be ruined simply setting foot in the streets. True to theirname, cutpurses roamed the crowds with their knives at the ready, quick to cut avictim’s money purse loose and run away.Anne’s father looked grim. “I promise you, child, one day God will wipe thisiniquity off the face of the earth or he will send us to a place where virtuecan prevail.”It frightened Anne to hear such things. Fear for her soul stifled the other sideof her nature, which wanted to take one of the small skiffs across the river tosee for herself what iniquity looked like—to tell the truth, it might look likefun. That was only a momentary fancy, if it existed at all. But Anne tooksomething else away that day.“Am I an inch away from turning wicked?” she asked.Her father smiled. “Of course.”Only those two words. He didn’t turn their stroll into a sermon, but Anne feltstruck to the heart. “Of course” she was in peril of being damned; her fathercould tell her so with a satisfied smile. Growing up, Anne never mentioned tohim what his words did to her. Events moved quickly and tumultuously. Her fatherwas in prison and out again, transferred to a remote living in Alford, far awayfrom London in Lincolnshire, where he would cause no trouble. But he keptrailing against the bishops, and then the meager living was snatched away and hewas put under house arrest. The ups and downs never ended. If Anne hadn’tmarried two years after her father suddenly died, she might have wound up a poorservant.Anne grew up knowing travail, but each blow had a divine meaning, as all testsdo. The meaning was that God would not wipe the new Sodom off the face of theearth. He was showing through every setback and outrage against the Puritansthat they must seek a world elsewhere. No other choice was possible. Yet whenthey arrived in the colonies, the elect were throwing the dice. Raw nature posedworse travails than any bishop back home. London was scourged by bubonic plague,but this new place was scourged by “the sickness.” London had cutpurses, but thecolonies had savages. The only hope was to be more rigid, strict, and vigilantthan ever.“Why are we so sorely tested?” the preachers railed. “Because we are so close tothe goal. God must scour every spot of sin before he admits us into the companyof the blessed—it is just around the corner.” It was a message no onedisbelieved, or if they did, they fled Boston when no one was looking and neverreturned. The wilderness would deliver judgment on them soon enough. The onlythreat that shook the Puritans came unexpectedly, from within. Anne Hutchinsonhad been visited personally by Christ, and he showed her another way. There was no question of accusing her publicly, not at first. The Hutchinsonhouse, which stood very near the governor’s, attracted more and more people whowanted to hear Anne unfold God’s grace. These were not just women from thegossipings, although it helped that Anne attended almost every birth as midwife.Preachers rode in from surrounding towns. The freemen of the colony, being themost important church members, elected a new governor every year, and for 1636it was young Henry Vane, barely thirty, who supported religious tolerance—hemade a point of spending evenings at the Hutchinsons’. On a pleasant night asmany as sixty people might pass through their open door.Eyes were always watching outside the door, however. Some of those eyes belongedto families that felt the colony was their private possession. They had settledfirst, invested their money in shares, and prevailed in ensuring thatMassachusetts would be strictly Puritan. Newcomers were feared. There waspressure on the crown to change the original charter, which allowed almostanyone to settle in the Bay Colony. The old guard tightened its control overBoston.“Tolerance is all well and good,” they muttered, “until we are tolerated out ofexistence.”Boston was too small for the two factions not to pass on the street every day.One elder and former governor, John Winthrop, was the thorniest and mostoutspoken among the old guard. If anyone first uttered the word “sedition” aboutAnne, it was he or a man clinging to his coattails.“Don’t tell me I must stop speaking because one old stiff-neck thinks he ismightier than God,” said Anne. She was resolved, but so was Winthrop, and it wasworrisome that he had got himself elected deputy governor, which gave him aplace from which to attack young Vane, freshly arrived from England.“He won’t last. I’ll wager he won’t even stay,” Winthrop declared behind closeddoors.When William Hutchinson went about on business, pleasant greetings in the streetturned to curt nods and then nothing at all. Passing Winthrop was like awinter’s blast.“He says you offer the easy path,” William said one night after company hadleft. He stood in his nightshirt beside the narrow bed he shared with Anne,tucking in warm stones wrapped in cloth while she made sure the candles weresafely out.“Easy? In England I could walk out to look at the moon in December and not riskfreezing to death. There’s no easy path here,” said Anne.“You know what he means.”“He means that God wants every settler to break his back until John Winthropsays, ‘That’s almost enough, brother. Just ten years more, if you please.’ ”William bit his lip. “I only say this. Don’t tread on him unless you know whatyou do.”Anne had such calm self-assurance that she might have replied, “Let him trytreading on me. It’s the same as treading on God.” A grain of humility made herkeep the thought to herself. Yet no one could doubt that Anne’s defense was theBible and her fierce knowledge of it. Scripture was a tangled skein that sheunraveled easily, moving from the prophets to the Gospels, from King David tothe king of kings, without having to find the passages with her finger. A marvelof a godly woman—unless you happened to hate her.Winthrop had a long, narrow face designed for disapproval, so it was impossibleto tell that his mood was darkening. But he never stopped burrowing in onetunnel or another. After his term of one year, Vane was sent packing back toLondon, and Winthrop once again became governor. The preachers who sympathizedwith Anne quailed, except for a few.Standing at the gangplank before his ship left, Vane regarded the town ofBoston.“Built on three hills, but it’s not a city on a hill, is it?” he murmured. “Thenew Jerusalem isn’t before me.” A dream was quickly vanishing.Vane promised Anne and her followers that he would get a new charter from theking to overturn the colony. Brave words, but soon Vane was caught up in his ownbrand of sedition. Revolution was his calling now, and what awaited him wasbeheading.Not that Anne foresaw this or the other calamities in the future. The first cameswiftly enough.“There’s to be a trial,” said William, weeks after Vane had departed.“For what?” said Anne.“The worst. Heresy.”“Send the court a message. If they want a fair trial, they should chargethemselves with heresy at the same time.”Puritan trials were simple affairs. The defendant was burdened by guilt evenbefore being told the charges. The process of getting a confession took almostno time. Winthrop stood up with the intent of flattening Mrs. Hutchinson likeall the others.“You hold assemblies in your house, a thing that is not tolerable to God and notfitting to your sex,” he began. “You trouble the peace of the commonwealth andour churches.”“I don’t hear a legal charge yet,” Anne rejoined.“I’ve named them, and I can name more.”“I haven’t heard one. What have I said or done?”Her steadiness flustered Winthrop. “You are part of a faction that—”She cut him off. “What faction? When did I join?”Winthrop searched for words. “It is generally known that you entertain thesepeople.”“I asked you before—name my legal offense.”She was tearing him apart with tiny cuts, nitpicking every blusteringaccusation.“Your opinions are against the word of God. They may seduce innocent souls whocome to hear you. If you keep on, our only course is to retrain you or put youaway from us.”Anne almost smiled. “You may, sir, if you have a rule for it from God.” Atthrust and parry Winthrop was hopeless.He knew it and exploded. “We are your judges, not you ours!”Anne had a reply, but the trial was hastily adjourned as night fell. Theycouldn’t get her to confess, which baffled everyone; courts had no other job.William left with high hopes. Winthrop had walked into a disaster.But Anne was somber, and that night her husband fell asleep without his wifebeside him. It wasn’t like her to pray all night, but then this was the mostextraordinary night of her life.The next morning she seemed changed, and it wasn’t simply the exhaustion ofexercising her soul.“My dear,” said William gingerly.Anne set her jaw. “It’s all right. I know the truth. God tells me that I mustspeak it.”She stood up in court before the magistrates could say a word against her.“If you give me leave, I will tell you what God has revealed to me. The groundof my belief is that He has blessed me. He has shown me how to hear the voice ofMoses and the voice of my beloved Jesus. I can hear the voice of John theBaptist and the voice of the Antichrist.”A judge spoke up. “How did you know it was the Spirit?”“How did Abraham know it was God who told him to sacrifice his son?” said Anne.“He heard an immediate voice from heaven.”“Just as I do.”They knew they had her then. Revelation was the rock of Christian belief. WhenChrist was taken away, the new faith would have died if the apostles had notheard from the Holy Spirit. Unfortunately for Anne, worshipping the oldrevelations wasn’t the same as believing the new ones.The judges leaned forward, pressing her to repeat what she’d said, but Annerefused.“You have power over my body, but the Lord has power over my body and my soul.”The atmosphere was tense and quiet. She was speaking things no one coulddisagree with now, and her followers saw a glimmer of hope. If only she hadstopped there. But she didn’t.Turning to Winthrop and the others, Anne raised her voice. “I assure you, if youcontinue with this trial and the course it is taking, you will bring a cursedown upon you and your posterity. The mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.”A collective groan went up, followed by consternation. Anne’s followers believedher message and trembled. Her enemies were glad to have heresy so plainlyrevealed. Only a few kept silent, probably out of cynicism. They knew that hercondemnation was inevitable. The old guard had won. But whoever they were, everyobserver believed in divine revelation. They had to doubt. Had Anne Hutchinsondelivered an inspired message, or was she playing the same guilt game that noPuritan could escape, including herself? Whichever it was, Anne condemnedherself out of her own mouth. Winthrop declared that Mrs. Hutchinson wasdelusional; the court found her guilty of sedition.She barely noticed the sentence of banishment when it was pronounced. She spokeup once more, mildly.“I desire to know the reason why I am banished.”Winthrop replied, “The court knows the reason and is satisfied.”In her heart Anne wanted to go and so did the ministers who believed intolerance. They scattered north and south, founding new towns as far away asMaine and Connecticut. The old guard tightened the rules, making it illegal forany to house a new settler under their roof for more than three weeks. Afterthat time, a magistrate would decide who belonged and who didn’t. Faith andpolitics had found a way to forge the same manacles.Anne led her family into the wilderness with eighteen others. Did she hear thevoice of Moses then? The group founded a new town in Rhode Island, a safer placeto hear revelations. Looking out over the sea, which still teemed with whalespouts, Anne worried that Winthrop’s faction would reach out and swallow up thenew settlements. She and the younger children pressed farther south, beyond anyEnglish charter. Even then the spirit wouldn’t let her rest.William was the lucky one, dying before they moved again. Anne never saw a newcity. She landed in the forest among scattered dwellings just north of the Dutchcolony in New Amsterdam. She was uprooted from her own people. God’s eye wasupon her, of that she never wavered. His eye was upon her when she heard hervoices. It was upon her when she read the book of Creation. It must have beenupon her one night in 1643 when the local Indians, enraged by how the Dutch hadmisused them, attacked the house.All those who had gathered around Anne, including six of her children, weremurdered that night. The horrifying news spread that their scalps had beentaken, and worse, a young daughter named Susanna, only nine years old, had beencaptured by the Indians. Captivity was a fate no female could regard withoutdread.Legend has it that in the confusion of the attack, young Susanna ran away andhid in a large cleft rock in the shape of a tortoise shell or a whale’s humpedback. Leviathan hid her from the worst of the savagery, until she was found bythe attackers and whisked away into the forest. By then the raiders were overtheir murderous mood. Telling the story in later years, the settlers took tocalling the cleft formation that the girl hid in Spirit Rock.The Hutchinson family that was left in Boston never ceased their search forSusanna. She had been a babe in arms when her parents sailed to the colonies.The Indians raised her in captivity—she rarely spoke of any details—and after afew years they traded her back to the English. She returned to Boston. To bridgethe unspeakable gap when Susanna had been gone, she was treated like an unknownperson and reintroduced into polite society as someone fresh and new. She livedto marry and bear children; she died of old age.Who can stop the mind, though, from conjuring up images of Anne’s last night?The house would have had only a few windows, left open after a hot August day.Then it came. The sound of glass crashing, the pounding footsteps of theinvaders, the children’s cries, all were mixed with a sight we can be certainof—the enraged Anne standing her ground as she ordered her killers to leave inthe name of God.Revealing the VisionTo the earliest settlers in New England, God was giving humanity a secondchance. The moral rottenness of Europe could be left behind for an unspoiledlandscape that was extravagantly called a new Eden. It thrilled the souls ofthese radical Protestants to be rewriting the fall of humankind. They hadcomplained bitterly about the corruption of the Catholic and Anglican churches,although their zeal for purity in all things had made them the butt of ridicule,including by Shakespeare. (A character in Twelfth Night mocks, “Dost thou thinkbecause thou art virtuous there shall be no more cakes and ale?”) Yet thisfervent optimism ran into several crushing obstacles that spoiled the apple. Nota serpent, but stubborn human nature and the trials of bleak New England winterscame as crushing blows to some Puritans, while others turned flint hard andscraped out a bare living that was more like God’s punishment than a reward. Thedeity was not allowing an easy birth for the new Adam and Eve.We don’t live in a world where Satan is watching if you go to the movies. Oursouls are not in peril when we indulge in a hot fudge sundae. But the Puritansfelt keenly that the enticements of pleasure were created to tempt the righteousto fall. The first Massachusetts colonists were overwhelmed by new settlers withdifferent, more lenient beliefs, but the old Puritan strain, with its prudery,guilt, hellfire, and damnation, stuck in the collective mind. The New World wasindelibly marked as puritan, with or without a capital P.We cannot look upon the Bay Colony as a grim curiosity. Salvation lies at theheart of being a Protestant. Anne Hutchinson, like everyone around her, believedthat God was intimately near. Under his gaze, every soul was naked. It was up toeach believer, then, to enter into a soul bargain with the Lord, and the bargaincould turn fatal at any moment. The slippery slope to hell was much easier tofind than the steep stairway to heaven. From our easy vantage point, the setupwas a kind of abusive relationship, since the Father’s love could only be keptby acting the part of a perfect child, no matter how often God became enragedand visited random punishments without giving a reason for them.Punishment in the first years of the Pilgrim settlement wasn’t random—it wasconstant, and the more people perished from starvation or the mysterious maladyrecorded as “the sickness,” the more rigid the mind-set became that looked forsin as the cause of misfortune. Anne Hutchinson shared with everyone a beliefthat reading the “book of Creation” would reveal signs of inner failure andweakness.She would be the perfect martyr if we didn’t have the transcript of the 1637trial in which a kangaroo court ensured that their local gadfly was banished.Everything condemned by the old guard in Boston (remembering that “old” meantlanding in the New World four years ahead of anyone else) became revered inAmerican history. Tolerance, however imperfect, replaced sectarian bigotry. Freespeech became a right written into the Constitution. Eventually the rise of thewomen’s movement made Anne look even better.Unfortunately, we do have the trial record, which reveals that the defendant waseither delusional, a fanatic, or seriously misguided in her spiritual quest.Hearing Anne curse the judges who were about to condemn her meant, in the eyesof Puritans, that she wished eternal damnation upon them. Not the picture of agentle prophetess guided by Jesus whom we might like to embrace. But a woman whocame out publicly to announce that she heard the voices of Moses, Christ, Johnthe Baptist, and the Antichrist would be greeted just as hostilely today as shewas then. How can we revere revelation and be deeply suspicious of it at thesame time?This was a crucial dilemma for the whole movement known as Protestantism. Theendless—and to our eyes pointless—battles over heresies, the gruesomepersecution of witches, and the splitting off of contentious new sects provethat an intimate relationship with God is two-edged. If you are the soleauthority of God’s word, no other authority can deny your truth. Going back tothe earliest days of Christianity, it appears that knowing God directly, whichwas called Gnosticism, was probably part of the faith during the decades rightafter the crucifixion. So were the tendencies that burned in Anne Hutchinson’sheart: resistance to authority, the right of women to preach, and a hunger forrevelation.As the official church rose, it set itself against Gnosticism, and when theemperor Constantine put the imperial seal on Christianity as the state religionin 313, one of the first campaigns of the early bishops was to wipe out theGnostic heresy—in fact, for centuries all that was known about the Gnostics camefrom the fervent condemnation of their enemies. Power politics has never found away to keep its fingers out of religion, as Anne Hutchinson discovered, withfatal consequences. Yet gnosticism with a small g, the belief that God can becontacted by anyone, can never be extinguished.A passage in the New Testament contains the seed of trouble. In the AmericanizedKing James Version, 1 John 4:9 sounds innocuous: “In this was manifested thelove of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into theworld, that we might live through him.” But the first phrase can also betranslated, “In this was manifested the love of God in us.” Christianity hasworried over what “God in us” means. Anne Hutchinson took it to mean that theHoly Spirit was equally in everyone, a message that recurs among all the world’smystics. But sin exists in all people too according to the tradition stemmingfrom the fall of Adam and Eve. So how do the two poles of good and evil relatein our divided nature? This is a question that extends far beyond the curious,grim band of Puritans struggling to survive in the wilderness.Somehow Christ’s death, which redeemed the world of sin, didn’t wipe sin out.This fact is apparent to the naked eye, yet to believing Christians, all murderand violence that followed the crucifixion is different from the murder andviolence that preceded it. The difference is salvation. By surrendering to Godthrough his Son, your sins are forgiven and your soul redeemed. Thus the deathof a single individual marked a turning point in the history of the world.Non-Christians accept no such turning point, but that’s in the nature ofreligions, to mark exclusive territory for their version of God. The ChristianGod is waiting for sinners to take advantage of a cosmic bargain that defeatsall evil for all time; the choice is ours.For the Puritans, the cosmic bargain was so palpably real that they began toexamine it under a microscope, reading the finest of fine print. (The factionrepresented by John Winthrop even called itself the Legalists.) How was thecontract fulfilled? Did you accept God’s word at face value or did he have toprove that he accepted you? Was a newborn baby, always in danger of dying veryquickly, an unredeemed sinner, or would baptism take care of that? If notbaptism, then what? Because the cosmic bargain was written in invisible ink,these minute but life-altering details became rife in Protestantism long beforethe Puritans sailed.Just as Europe had splintered over theological niceties, the American colonistscontinued to divide, and out of the original meager settlements tiny bands ofrenegades melted into the forest to found new towns from Maine to New York, allwanting to breathe their own air and worship their own version of the ProtestantGod. We shake our heads today that anyone was willing to risk starvation anddeath over a delusional issue like infant damnation, but when your soul is atrisk, such niceties lead to eternal damnation, should you forget to obey thefine print.Anne Hutchinson set herself against legalism with breathtaking certainty. Shedeclared that “laws, commands, rules, and edicts” existed only for those whowere blind to the light. The path to salvation was clear to “he who has God’sgrace in his heart.” She emerges on the “good” side of the fanatical struggle,but her plea for grace didn’t actually win. One person would never be enough,however holy her life, to convince the world that sin was entirely forgivensimply by knowing it inside. What actually triumphed was Winthrop’s convictionthat you have to work hard to earn God’s favor—this was the doctrine of“sanctification”—which to him was a self-evident truth. If you didn’t work hard,you would certainly fall into ruin, and that could hardly be a sign that Godloves you. Therefore, even if you don’t feel saved or particularly favored byProvidence, your hard work proves that you are willing to strive towardsalvation. Faith found a visible outlet. As the Protestant work ethic prevailed(interestingly, the phrase is synonymous with “Puritan work ethic”), John D.Rockefeller Jr., the world’s first self-made billionaire, could take triumphantadvantage. When asked where he got his riches, Rockefeller smoothly bypassed hisruthless business tactics, which led to the ruin of many competitors, by saying,“God gave me my money.”Anne Hutchinson can’t be seen as victorious, but she is representative of adivision that troubles human nature. Faith remains invisible, no matter how manygood works we do, including charity and selfless altruism. This implies that Godhasn’t retracted the curse laid on Adam and Eve. Guilt has shifted, however,becoming a psychological issue rather than a religious one. Still, in times ofcrisis, the possibility of an angry God always rears its head, and too oftenviolence in the name of appeasing God breaks out. What can please God more thanattacking his enemies, who are obliged to return the favor since they believe intheir own version of God?Where does that leave grace? Perhaps where it always was, as a privatecommunication between God and each person’s inner world. Anne Hutchinson died aviolent death, and it’s not hard to imagine her enemies feeling justified—theheretic got the divine punishment she deserved. But the secret of grace is thatthey never would have known whether they were right. Grace, if truly received,brings complete peace. The path of hard work, on the other hand, never loses itsanxious worry; the instant God is seen as demanding something, he might never besatisfied. In the harsh climate of Puritanism, Anne Hutchinson spoke severely:One may preach a covenant of grace more clearly than another. . . . But whenthey preach a covenant of works for salvation, that is not truth.Many of the world’s wisdom traditions agree with her. As for those that don’t,they inherit an anxious existence that turns faith in God into a risky gamble."},{"pageContent":"9 [toc01.xhtml#cha09]Baal Shem Tov [toc01.xhtml#cha09]“To Live Is to Serve God” [toc01.xhtml#cha09]Avraham Gershon, son of a great rabbi, couldn’t believe that God was so clumsy.His timing was terrible. There was no other word for it.“Wait for a proper man, a man who has something to give. You can’t marry thisnebbish. I forbid it,” he fumed.His sister, Chanah, was distressed. Hands folded in her lap, she kept her gazeon the floor. “He’s a teacher, and people love him, they say.” She hadn’tactually set eyes on Yisrael, although she had been told the name of herbetrothed.“Love?” Avraham snorted. “Tell me, how do you make soup out of that? I won’tgive him any money, be sure of it.”Avraham stared out the window. By the Christian calendar it was 1716. Spring wasbreaking in Poland. The czar couldn’t take that away from the Jews.Chanah was meek-voiced, but stubborn. “So I must obey you before I obey myfather? Where is it written?”“Our father is dead,” snapped Avraham. “He meets this nobody while traveling topreach in the shtetls. He foolishly promises his daughter’s hand, and then whatdoes our father do? He eats a chicken leg, feels a bit off, and dies in thenight. Ridiculous.”The old rabbi had gone to the outlying villages, the shtetls, because there hadbeen an outbreak of messiah fever. A movement, in fact. He went to talk sense tothe people, especially the ignorant, who couldn’t read or write. Some hadstarted to worship a dead rabbi from the Ukraine, whispering that miracles weredone in his name. But instead of breaking the fever, their father must havegotten infected. It was some kind of joke, really, or a trial. After he returnedhome, all he would say was that he had given Chanah to Yisrael ben Eliezer.The groom-to-be, who was poor as a turnip digger, was due that afternoon. Theday was ominously bright. He’d be on time and smiling. Why not? His bride wasone of the choicest catches in the prosperous town of Brody.Avraham glowered. “And don’t talk to me about what is written. A woman—anunmarried woman, in fact—has no right to speak of the law to a man.”Avraham had his back to his sister, and when she didn’t argue, he felt a flickerof hope that she might listen to him. But when he turned around, she had alreadycrept out of the room. He could have ordered her back. Until she married andbecame the responsibility of her husband, she was under the authority of herbrother. Avraham sighed. He wasn’t a monster. He wanted her to be happy.Like other prominent Jewish families they kept a goyishe maid, a Christian, whodid the chores on the Sabbath, when all work was forbidden to Jews. The girl litcandles, sliced the bread, even opened and shut doors. This one, named Marya,entered. A man was at the kitchen door, a peasant who wouldn’t leave, althoughthe cook had dumped some slops on his feet.Avraham almost ordered the peasant to be beaten from the door, but he stoppedhimself. A righteous man is weakened by anger. If he performed an act ofcharity, he reminded himself, some good might come of it. With old Rebbe Ephraimdead, his congregation was subject to poachers. The fickle were already driftingaway. The rabbinical court that Avraham had inherited settled fewer lawsuits.The familiar noise of wives weeping over their faithless husbands and neighborsaccused of stealing eggs had quieted down. The silence made Avraham nervous. Hewent to the back door, fumbling for a zloty to give as alms.The beggar was a young man, under twenty, who wore shabby clothes, but didn’tsmell. Avraham held out the coin, hoping he wasn’t showing charity to adrunkard.The beggar smiled. “Reb’ Gershon?”“How do you know my name?”“Shouldn’t I know it if we are going to be related?”Smiling more broadly, the beggar opened his arms. Avraham involuntarily stumbledbackward.Not to be rebuffed, the beggar saw an opening and slipped past his futurebrother-in-law into the kitchen. “The road. It’s hard on the feet,” he saidcheerfully. Since he wore no shoes and had walked to Brody with his feet wrappedin rags, this remark made sense.“What is that smell—noodle pudding, kugel?” he asked.“The road. It’s harder on the stomach,” said Avraham drily. “We were expectingyou. Only not quite like this.”“I know, I know,” said the groom-to-be apologetically, unable to take offense.He turned to the cook, who was fumbling with her greasy apron, unsure how toreact to the intruder, who was clapping his arms around himself to get warm.“I forgive you for dumping cabbage scraps on me. What’s your name? I am Yisraelben Eliezer, and it would be a blessing to find out how well you make kugel.”Avraham jerked on the young man’s arm. “It doesn’t matter what her name is.You’ll get fed in time. Come.”Yisrael rubbed the soles of his feet against his pants legs, to wipe off thelayer of mud caked on them. He followed Avraham into a parlor filled with warmthfrom a crackling hearth. The visitor seemed awed. What were the walls linedwith? It could be silk. Instead of walking immediately toward the fire, Yisraelben Eliezer closed his eyes, and his smile assumed a different, unusual shape.Praying? Avraham Gershon couldn’t believe it. This nobody was thanking God forthe existence of a working fireplace.“Before you ask, she’s not coming down. It’s not a match,” said Avraham firmly.“That’s too bad. I heard about your father’s death, peace be on his memory.”Yisrael’s tone was sympathetic, as if he hadn’t heard the bad news about notgetting his hands on Chanah’s dowry.“Oh, I almost forgot,” he said, reaching into his leather coat, which waspatched and stained. He brought out a small bag tied with string. “What do youthink of that?”Avraham frowned. “What is it?”“Seeds. For planting. By God’s mercy none of the village wheat got moldy overthe winter.”With a humble but ceremonious gesture Yisrael handed the bag to his host.“You’re in a town. We buy flour. We don’t plant wheat,” said Avraham slowly, asif addressing an idiot.“Isn’t it time someone did? Not you, of course, but the wretched poor. I sawthem on the way into town. There are Jews with nothing to eat living in theshadow of the synagogue,” said Yisrael, his voice growing sober.The house was not so big that two men’s voices didn’t carry upstairs. There werelight footsteps outside the parlor, and before Avraham could keep thegroom-to-be from setting eyes on her, Chanah appeared. Yisrael grinned as ifhe’d seen the gates of paradise fly open.“I am Yisrael,” he managed to stutter.Chanah said nothing, blankly staring. Her brother began to cheer up. Thegroom-to-be was obviously not a promising sight, particularly when he turnedaround and took off his traveling coat. His black suit was so old it lookedshiny enough to see your reflection in.“Yisrael thinks it would be a good idea to plant crops around the synagogue,”Avraham remarked brightly.“What?” muttered Chanah.Their visitor coughed lightly. “Not quite, dear brother. I think it wouldimprove the lot of Jews starving in town to move to farms where they could raisefood. Their children are dying. It would be better all around.” Yisrael turnedshyly to Chanah. “Do you agree?”Avraham inserted himself before his sister could reply. “She has no opinion onthe matter. None at all.”His rudeness was miscalculated. Chanah took pity on her shabby suitor andstepped forward. She told him her name. Yisrael beamed. Dinner that night wassturgeon soup and latkes, an uncomfortable affair as Avraham sulked. Yisraelslurped down the broth without any etiquette. In between he talkedenthusiastically about the plight of the Jews in the rural countryside.“Your father was on a righteous mission, in his own mind. The messiah, here inPoland? Of course in the shtetl one hears about this miracle rabbi all the time.He has a growing following.”“What’s his name?” asked Chanah, who had to fill in the gaps while her brother,keeping the wine to himself, stared at his glass before refilling it.“Sabbatai Zevi. He was considered very holy. I wish I had been alive to seehim.”“What good is there setting eyes on a charlatan, or perhaps this Zevi was evenmad,” muttered Avraham.Yisrael bent over his soup. “You never can tell,” he said mildly.“Wouldn’t we know if the messiah had come?” asked Chanah.Yisrael shrugged. “Nothing says that he would know himself. God hides the truthas much as he reveals it.”Even though his brain was foggy, a light struck Avraham. “You didn’t encourageour father in this madness, did you? No, it was you. It had to be.” Avrahamlurched to his feet. “And now you dare come here?”“Brother!” cried Chanah.“Stay out of it. I work night and day to convince people that Ephraim of Brodywasn’t out of his mind. A great man suddenly babbles about the messiah? If hepicked this bag of bones to marry you, he must have lost his reason entirely.”“Where I live, almost everyone goes hungry. Is that a sin?” asked Yisraelquietly.“I wouldn’t know,” snapped Avraham. “Ask God why you suffer. Ask your falsemessiah, why don’t you?”After throwing down his napkin and carelessly tipping his glass over, Avrahamstalked out. He banged upstairs. In the ensuing silence Chanah lookedthoughtful.“What did happen to our father? Can you tell me?”“I’m not sure I’m permitted. But I could tell you once we’re married,” saidYisrael. “Husband and wife are one.” Despite the disturbance, he didn’t push hisplate away, but kept eating. There was little doubt he hadn’t seen such a mealfor a long time.“You make it sound like a dreadful secret,” said Chanah.“It’s a secret, but not dreadful. More joyful, I would say.” Yisrael lookedaround hopefully, and Chanah rang the bell. They might as well bring in thenoodle pudding, even if she couldn’t eat a bite. Her nerves were frayed, yet shefelt as if the world had suddenly turned on its axis.Here was a very unpromising groom-to-be, who couldn’t eat properly at a table.But Chanah had heard a secret from her father that wasn’t shared with Avraham.Utterly impoverished, Yisrael yet was beloved of villagers because he could healin the name of God. Such a rabbi was called Baal Shem for his miraculous works.It wasn’t for table manners that the great Ephraim of Brody had selectedChanah’s husband. He saw him with the eyes of the soul.Every word that a Baal Shem said was of utmost importance, and Chanah did herbest to grasp wisdom from Yisrael’s ordinary remarks, not because she respectedhim—she hardly knew him—but because she was committed to following her father’swishes. This was to be her husband, even if his secret, once revealed, were agood deal less than joyful. Avraham kept his word. After driving Yisrael from his house, he disowned hissister and refused to give her a penny. Chanah kept her promise to God and herfather. She wed the Baal Shem under the canopy with no one present who knew her,much less willing to give her away.She had shamed Avraham and their family, but he relented slightly at the end.“Your husband goes around town dressed like a peasant,” he said, “and if that’shis life, he needs a horse.”So they started out their new existence with a horse as their only worldlypossession. The first few years were spent in grinding poverty. Yisrael wasreduced to manual labor, digging clay to be made into bricks. Chanah found awagon to hitch the horse to and made deliveries to even poorer families who hadno horse at all.And the secret was revealed, almost as soon as they had slept with the marriagesheet between them and Yisrael had deflowered his bride without seeing her.“Do you remember when I made your brother so angry, talking about the news of amessiah?” he asked. Chanah nodded. “I said, ‘You never can tell,’ and he stormedout of the room. I had a reason for those words.”Chanah felt faint. She was cold in her wedding bed, in a rickety hut where thewind whistled through the walls, and suddenly a feeling of loneliness overcameher. It would be too much if Yisrael believed the messiah had come. Couldn’t hewait to tell her in the morning?Seeing her distress, Yisrael went silent. They lay there as he stroked hercheek, but it was only a short pause.“Be easy. I am not in the messiah movement, but I do have secret beliefs.”What he unfolded was strange to Chanah. It had to do with mystic Judaism,Kabbalah. Nothing about that made her anxious. Avraham was considered anauthority on Kabbalah, which was widespread in that region.“The Jews cannot be abandoned by God,” her brother declared. “He has left usmessages about our fate. The messages are hidden, that’s all.”Chanah was used to getting up in the middle of the night and spying her brother,bent over in the dark with a sputtering candle by his side, poring over theTalmud, searching for secret numbers and codes. It wasn’t her place to thinkabout such things, but now she had no choice. It helped that her husband’s armswere warm when he wrapped them around her.“God has every reason to destroy the world,” Yisrael said. “Have you everwondered why he doesn’t? There is enough sin, even among the good Jews, to makeGod abandon the human race. This problem worried me very much as I grew up.“The answer doesn’t lie out in the open, like hay drying in the sun. It must behidden on purpose, and if so, where can it hide? In the hearts of those whoknow.”“And you are one of those?” asked Chanah.“If anyone asks whether I am one of them, I can only say what I told yourbrother: you never can tell. The secret is buried that deep.”“This makes no sense. Anyone who keeps a secret knows that he is keeping it,”Chanah objected.“Not this kind.”Begging her to be patient, the Baal Shem unfolded a cosmic scheme. As he delvedinto Kabbalah, the young Yisrael discovered the most mystical number, which wasthirty-six. Why? Because it has been revealed that thirty-six righteous men havebeen appointed by God to keep the world from being destroyed. Exactly thatnumber, no more and no less.“The Lamed Vav,” said Yisrael. “You must remember this. Our whole life togetherdepends upon it.”It seemed like something a child could remember, since lamed was the thirtiethletter of the Hebrew alphabet and vav was the sixth. Why would a grown man beobsessed with—?Yisrael cut off the thought before she finished thinking it. “When do we knowfor certain that God spoke? In the Torah, when the world first began. Ourfathers heard the truth from God’s mouth. For example, when Sodom had falleninto depravity, God raised his hand to wipe it out and everyone who lived withinits walls. But Abraham beseeched God to save the people. God agreed on onecondition, that Abraham find fifty righteous men in Sodom. Abraham searched thecity in vain, and when he couldn’t find fifty, he begged God to change hisdemand. God then asked for only ten righteous men, yet even then there were notten to be found. He asked for only one righteous man, and he was found, by thename of Lot.”“And still Sodom was destroyed,” Chanah reminded him.Yisrael was too excited to be interrupted. “What matters is that God found a wayto keep the human race alive. He is doing the same thing today. Has sindecreased? Has the messiah come to save us? No, so we must save ourselves. Thatis what the thirty-six, the Lamed Vav, are doing. In secret they are therighteous men who keep God’s wrath at bay. Isn’t it wonderful?”Chanah thanked the Lord that Yisrael hadn’t blurted out these ideas when helived under Avraham’s roof courting her. The last thing she needed was twoKabbalists fighting over who had the magic number. She went to sleep exhausted,but happy. If this was her husband’s joyful secret, it wasn’t hard to keep andnothing to be ashamed of.She soon found that the secret was far from private. The Baal Shem, althoughonly eighteen years old, had a fervent following. They called themselves “therighteous,” and they all accepted his belief that the thirty-six must exist,secretly and unknown to anyone else, or else the world would end. It might be astrange belief, but it was all they talked about; therefore, it was all thatChanah heard.One July day she was scrubbing clothes by the river. It was a scorching day; shewas bent over a rock squeezing soap out of the heavy washing. There wasn’t anextra penny to hire a peasant girl to do the drudgery, as they had in herfather’s house. To any passerby, Chanah herself looked like a peasant girl.The woman next to her kept babbling about the thirty-six, until Chanah blurtedout, “What good do they do us? We are two penniless Jews thrashing clothesagainst the rocks. This is salvation?”Word got back to the Baal Shem, naturally. Chanah knew it would, and she bracedherself. Whatever he threw at her, she was determined to throw it back. He camein that evening and sat down at the table without a word; he kept silent as sheladled out the watery cabbage soup and cut the black bread.They ate like that, saying nothing, but not anxiously. Chanah knew her husbandwell, and he wasn’t angry. She waited for his reaction.Halfway through, Yisrael smiled. “I don’t slurp, have you noticed? That was oneof the three promises I made when you married me. This girl was brought up in anice home. She doesn’t deserve slurping.”Chanah knew he was getting at things sideways, so she played into the game. “Andwhat were your other two promises?”“To love my dear wife and to keep her safe. Only I can’t keep you safe.”The Baal Shem pointed out the open door, which let the breeze in since their huthad no windows. “Out there are enemies. The czar to the east, the Germans to thewest. If I ride a horse three days from here, what do I see? A burned-out landwhere the Turks have killed everyone. The Turks! They crossed the whole BlackSea to find some Jews and wipe them out.”Chanah bit her lip, never having heard him in such a dark mood.“I know that God wants to keep us safe, and I know I am too weak to help. Thatwas why He sent the vision of the thirty-six to me, so that I would not loseheart. I would see that he knows everything and his children are cared for.”“But I thought you were one of the thirty-six,” said Chanah. “Your followersworship you. I just assumed.”“I’m sorry, but no. The Lamed Vav are hidden among us. They never revealthemselves. They may not even know their holy mission. All they know is that Godwants them to lead the holiest life possible. To live is to serve God. This hasbeen revealed to them in their hearts.”Although she was listening, Chanah couldn’t help smiling to herself. Her husbandworked night and day to get people to believe in the thirty-six, and he wasn’teven one of them! He had taken on a thankless, foolish task. She saw thatclearly. The only redeeming feature was that maybe it was a task that God hadwilled. As Chanah grew used to her life, God played a new trick. Her brother, moved byhis sister’s poverty, agreed to set Yisrael up in business, but the businessAvraham chose was tavern keeping. This was not permitted for a Jew and totallyopposite to the righteous life Yisrael set for his followers. But the Baal Shemshrugged off these objections, saying that it was in the spirit of the law toshow kindness to everyone, including sots and the morally weak.Tongues were set wagging for other reasons. “The rebbe and his wife, they arestill like newlyweds,” the gossips whispered behind Chanah’s back. “He keeps herup all night, can you imagine?”This was true, but not in the sense they meant. The Baal Shem prayed long intothe night. Chanah got out of bed barefoot and came to him with a candle in hand.“What are you asking for, night after night?”“Nothing.”“How can that be?” she asked.“I want to leave myself and go where God is. If I pray with enough love, he letsme into that place, and then everything is perfect.” He smiled innocently.“Forgive me. I must sound very selfish to you.”“It can’t be selfish to seek God,” she said. Sometimes before she left Chanahwould kiss her husband on the forehead or touch his chest. His skin would be hotif he had prayed long enough. He called this “the burning,” a bodily sign thathe was in a state of ecstasy.Their life was lived so close to the bone that Chanah kept wondering how hecould pray without asking God for a small boon or relief from suffering. Sheembraced her own private thoughts. For instance, she thought that her husbandshould ask God directly if he was one of the thirty-six. Wasn’t it better toknow, once and for all? But if she hinted at such doubts, Yisrael shook his headand refused to discuss the matter.As he grew older, a gift came to him, and to all the Jews in that region, whichshifted between Poland and the Ukraine, depending on which ruler was greedyenough to fight for it.“The government needs us now,” the Baal Shem told his followers. “The Turks havebeen driven out, and the land they invaded was devastated. They killed everyonethey could find and left them to rot in the streets.”He caught himself and turned to Chanah. “I’m sorry if you would prefer not tohear this.”Whatever she might have preferred, the men in the group shuffled their feet, andChanah knew she wasn’t wanted. The Baal Shem told her later that the region inquestion, Podolia, having been depopulated by the invaders, was in sore need offarmers to move in. The Polish authorities were taking a lenient view andinvited the Jews to settle.“You see how God looks out for us?” said Yisrael. “Land for poor Jews, but evenbetter, a place for new ideas.”This new land became seed ground for his followers, who became known as theHasidim. The name meant that they were pious, but also loving and kind. Is humannature so easily changed that each Hasid was suddenly a saint? Their skepticswere not convinced, but the peasants began to trade tales about the Baal Shem.He went to any house where there was sickness and provided herbs and a holymessage to fold inside an amulet. These were mystic names of God that couldheal.Avraham took note when he traveled to visit his sister. “So, your husband wasplaying a part with his shiny black suit. There’s a magical creature behind hishumility. A miracle rabbi, they say. You must be proud.”At that moment the Baal Shem walked into the room. “Pride is the only sin thatis unforgivable. We know this from the fallen angels, no?”Avraham didn’t want to start a fight. He rode around the countryside, and theignorance of the Jews who had come in from everywhere—Russia, Poland, theUkraine—amazed him.“All I hear is messiahs and miracles. The most preposterous tales arecirculated. Is this fairyland?”What he said wasn’t pure prejudice. Somehow, by being released from theoppression of the towns, these Jews had released their fantastic imagination.Every fallen tree that blocked the road could be the mischief of a golem ordybbuk, unholy spirits walking the land. Eggs that failed to hatch were the workof gremlins, and when winter was dark and deep, ghosts were spied dancing amongthe snowflakes.“You encourage these superstitions?” Avraham accused the Baal Shem.“What should I do instead?” Yisrael replied.“Don’t pretend with me. You know what makes us Jews. One and only one thing—thelaw. Without the law, we would have disappeared from the face of the earth.”“Then let me ask you,” said the Baal Shem quietly. “Has anyone ever loved thelaw?”Avraham was stymied. The words “love” and “law” didn’t belong together. Goddidn’t mean them to, which went to show how nearly insane the Baal Shem must be.As he parted, Avraham told Chanah that he pitied her, but could no longerprotect her.“Mark my words. Pious Jews should leave this place. Here the Talmud has died,”he declared.Avraham was right in his world, where the law, as interpreted by generations ofscholars, made the Talmud a lifeline to God. In its books were preserved everywise and holy thought that was lawful. But there is another kind of lifeline,which has nothing to do with the law. People can believe in legends that uplifttheir hearts. Something precious is thereby kept alive.“You never can tell” had turned into a useful philosophy as the Baal Shemgradually became enveloped in myth. When he left a farm or shtetl, wisps oflegend trailed behind. A fox broke into the henhouse, but instead of biting achicken on the neck, he saw a mezuzah nailed to the doorpost. Suddenly the foxstarted to pray, and he left without snatching even a chick.“You see? The Baal Shem told me to nail a mezuzah to the henhouse, and I had noidea why. Now I know,” said the farmer with a knowing nod of the head. True? Younever can tell.As his fame spread, the Baal Shem moved from one place to another, doing goodworks and gathering disciples. But at home he never seemed to change, and sincewomen did not attend the prayer house, Chanah had little notion of her husband’sreputation. It astonished her to get up some mornings to find offerings left attheir door—a bunch of wild roses, a loaf of festive challah.“Wouldn’t it be a sin if they are starting to worship you?” she worried.“Cut the bread, put the flowers in a vase,” he said. “We might as well havesomething nice while I pray to God for an answer.”Yet it wasn’t these offerings that made Chanah uneasy so much as the awe thateveryone showed around the Baal Shem. There was no question of offending God.The Hasids lived up to their name as pious men, and even their worst enemiescouldn’t fault them, since the Baal Shem demanded the strictest observance ofprayers and rituals.Unable to shake off her nagging curiosity, Chanah wondered which of the men shecould question without being found out. One day after Sabbath, the Baal Shememerged from the prayer house trailed by his disciples. It was his custom totake a pleasant drive into the country to break the Sabbath, and Chanah waswaiting with her best shawl around her shoulders. On this day, however, hedidn’t greet her. Calling for a wagon large enough to hold all of his immediatefollowers, her husband gave Chanah a nod that told her nothing, and off the menwent, leaving her behind.They returned late the next night. Chanah was waiting up to hear the wholestory, but the Baal Shem kissed her on the forehead, saying, “I know what is inyour heart. Just this once, seek out the youngest follower, who is barely a boy,and tell him it is no shame to satisfy your curiosity.”The next morning Chanah ran off to find a boy named David, who had justcelebrated his bar mitzvah the week before. Considering himself a man, he wasreluctant to tell tales about the Master, but after a good deal of persuasion,he unfolded the story.The men had gathered as usual to celebrate the beginning of the Sabbathtogether. Out of respect for the Baal Shem, the atmosphere was quiet andrestrained.“I’m sure you know,” said David, “that he reads the secret workings of theworld. He knows why things happen and what is the will of God. So even theslightest gesture of the Baal Shem contains mystery within mystery.”Chanah, who certainly did not know this, concealed her surprise and asked formore of the tale.As the Baal Shem was about to say the prayer over the wine, he suddenly burstout laughing. This wasn’t a mild chuckle, but a full, deep laugh that startledall of the disciples. They waited for an explanation, but the Master resumed theprayer, only to burst out a second time, and then, when this eruption subsided,a third. Everyone sat there dumbstruck, but no explanation was given, and therest of the Sabbath proceeded as if nothing unusual had happened.Upon setting foot outside the prayer house the next day near the end of theSabbath, however, the Baal Shem said, “Come.” He called for a wagon, and theyall piled in. Only instead of a pleasant ride, the journey took all night,during which the Baal Shem said nothing. The next morning they arrived at anondescript village.As soon as the Master set foot outside the wagon, all the Jews knew thatsomething important was happening. The elders rushed up in a pack and asked towhat they owed such a surprise visit.The Baal Shem looked them over, and said, “I know you are good Jews, but the oneI need to see is Shabti.”“Shabti the bookbinder?” asked the lead elder. “He’s a simple soul with nolearning. He crawls between heaven and earth without anybody noticing.”Somewhat offended, the elders sent for Shabti, who arrived cap in hand. “I knowthat I sinned on the Sabbath,” he confessed. “How you should know it is beyondme, but tell me what penance I must do to atone, and I will obey your judgment.”The Baal Shem waved his hand. “Before we get to that, tell everyone whathappened.”Stammering and red-faced, Shabti began. “God be thanked, I’ve earned a livingall my life, never having to ask anyone for anything. My only goal is that onthe fifth day of the week I have money for my wife to go out and buy what sheneeds for the Sabbath—flour, fish, candles. But as you see, I bear the weight ofold age, and last week I had nothing to give her, not a penny even to keep alight on the table.“I sighed and resolved that God wanted me to fast this Sabbath. So be it. I toldmy wife that she must wait for me at home while I went to prayers. We have goodneighbors with kind hearts. They would see no light from our house, and thenthey would run over to offer candles and bread and the rest. But I won’t takealms. I ordered my wife not to accept charity, and when she promised me, I wentoff to prayers with a heavy heart.”Shabti was so devout that he began his prayers at the tenth hour of the daybefore the Sabbath and went home after sundown the next day. Walking home in thedark, he saw a light in the window, and as he entered, the smell of fresh breadand baked sturgeon filled his nose.His wife stood there with a glowing face and, it being the Sabbath, Shabtididn’t have the heart to be angry with her. She had shown a woman’s weakness andtaken alms. He sat down to pray over the wine when she spoke up.“This is the most splendid holiday we’ve had in years. The wine seller wasastonished when I asked for his best bottle,” she exclaimed.Shabti couldn’t restrain himself and was about to rebuke her, when his wifethrew her hands up. She hadn’t disobeyed him at all. Instead, when she was leftalone in the house with only half a candle left, his wife decided to cleaneverything from top to bottom, as seemed suitable before fasting. She chancedupon an old chest full of yellowed clothes, remnants of the innocent years whenthey were newlyweds.“Who would think? I lifted a tattered blouse imagining that I might still beable to smell a trace of perfume on it,” she said. “Out tumbled a gold button,and I remembered losing it long ago. I rushed off to the goldsmith, who saidthat it was very fine work, the kind of work nobody does nowadays. He gave me somany coins for it. What do you say—a miracle?”Shabti was astonished and overjoyed. He started to pray over the wine, but hewas so happy that he burst out laughing and whirled his old wife around the roomin a dance.“I knew it was wrong in the eyes of God, but I was so overcome with joy that Idid it twice more,” Shabti confessed. “So how bad is my sin, Master?”“God is offended when we do not feel joy,” said the Baal Shem. “When you laughedout loud, he rejoiced.”Young David gave Chanah a serious look. “So you see? The Master saw all of thisunfold in the secret workings of the world. He was so glad at Shabti’s joy thathe burst out laughing three times, every time the bookbinder did.”Tears came to Chanah’s eyes, and it was hard not to embrace David, but shedidn’t want to give away that she had never heard such things about her husband.He, of course, knew what David would tell her. When Chanah returned home, theBaal Shem smiled with the same innocence as ever, accompanied by the familiarshrug. You never can tell.His fame only grew, until the day he died, barely sixty-two. Chanah had precededhim, or she would have been celebrated the rest of her days. In the Baal Shem’seyes, he was surrounded by good Jews, each one a recipient of his mysticalblessing, a ray of light sent from God through the Baal Shem’s soul.He never asked for veneration. “What have I done? The sun didn’t exactly stop inthe sky. And God has sent a messiah to laugh at me.”Just before Baal Shem’s death, a strange figure had sprung up in that region, amiracle rabbi named Jacob Frank. He formed a cult around himself, declaring thathe was the messiah. He traveled with a gaudy retinue who were styled as histwelve disciples.So the Hasids found themselves caught between the Talmudists on one side and theFrankists on the other. They were too mystical for one camp of enemies and notmystical enough for the other. The sparkling new messiah made a spectacle ofhimself in all the villages that had once stood in awe of the Baal Shem. It gotto the point where Frank, it was said, wanted his followers baptized.A shocked Hasid ran into the aged Baal Shem’s house to tell him this terriblescandal. The Master took it philosophically.“What the Jews will believe and what they won’t,” he murmured. “Has there everbeen another question?”Revealing the VisionFor the Christian world, the arrival of the Messiah changed the course ofhistory, which will lead inexorably to an end point on Judgment Day. But theresurrection also influenced the past, since it justified centuries of waiting.Jesus proved that the wait wasn’t in vain. Judaism continues to wait, buthistory doesn’t, and so there is mounting tension between modern life and thearchaic portrayal of Yahweh in the Bible. God needs to be kept current.Otherwise, a religion can collapse from within. This problem was met in Judaismthrough the long tradition of learned commentaries recorded in the Talmud. Ifscripture didn’t comment directly on how to run a business in Berlin or buy fromthe vegetable stalls in Warsaw, a learned rabbi would fill in the blanks with aninterpretation. Law never stopped working.But where does this leave love?Updating the rules isn’t the same as salvation, or even the same as knowing thatGod is still paying attention. On that score, reassurance comes from mystics, ofwhich Judaism has its own rich tradition. Mystics reveal God’s love here andnow, and love is above the law. But can love prevail? This question was mostacute for Jewish visionaries like the Baal Shem Tov. He rose at a time offerment, when social turbulence almost always meant trouble for the Jews—theywould be blamed and persecuted as a matter of course. For centuries, ever sincethe Romans destroyed the Temple in Jerusalem, survival meant strict adherence tothe law, and even the Kabbalah, the mystical interpretation of Judaism, belongedwithin the grasp of learned commentators, not a rural rabbi who lived like apeasant among peasants.At first the vision of Yisrael ben Eliezer seems cryptic. Even his title isenigmatic. Baal means “master,” and shem tov means “good name.” Other rabbinicalteachers had been given the honorific title of Baal Shem; Tov was addedspecifically to refer to the founder of Hasidism. His name can be read two ways,as a “master with a good name” or as a “master who practices wonders with thename of God.” The Baal Shem Tov was the most renowned of miracle rabbis,preaching his vision of the Lamed Vav, thirty-six righteous men who kept Godfrom destroying the sinful world, age after age. By association he became one ofthem, but that wasn’t his intent. In fact, since pride was the only unforgivablesin and humility the purest mark of righteousness, the Baal Shem Tov held thatanyone who publicly declared himself to be one of the Lamed Vav must be a fraud.The two false messiahs mentioned in the story did exist at the time, giving ussome idea of how tumultuous Eastern Judaism must have been. The Baal Shem Tovset himself firmly against such claims, yet ironically almost everything knownabout him consists of wonders, miracles, and saintly deeds that are consideredlegendary. Throughout the illiterate peasant shtetls his name is associated withhealings, being saved from disaster, and finding good luck in the midst ofmisfortune. Always there is the theme of simple faith as the highest virtue. Butthe legends grew out of an undeniable truth, that myth nourishes the yearningsoul. The Tzadikim, the hidden righteous sects, thrived in Polish Judaism, andthe Baal Shem Tov exemplifies their kindness and purity.Beyond the time, however, his vision was panentheistic, embracing God ineverything. It also can be accepted as including all faiths, since thethirty-six did not have to be Jewish. Creation glowed with the same divinepresence—the light of shekinah as it was known in Hebrew—and even sinners wereincluded. As history unfolded, the Hasidic movement remained ultra-Orthodox. Itturned inward, and the universality of the Baal Shem Tov was obscured, if notlost altogether.Even so, he remains a spiritual icon, a kind of parable anyone can identifywith. It is the parable of the wanderer, the lost son who cannot find where hebelongs. This was a painful issue for Jews scattered in the Diaspora. To be thechosen people and yet suffer more than people who were not required enormousfaith. And there was even stronger pressure to conform to the law, whose rulesand rituals bound Jewish identity together. In that sense the Baal Shem Tovwasn’t a rebel, but part of the ongoing anxious question about what it means tobe Jewish.To him it meant joy. Hasidism is about the end of anxiety, and in varioussayings of the Baal Shem Tov (it is hard to separate the true ones from thefictitious) he repeats how wrong it is for Jews to be discouraged and downcast.His own illumination made him see the possibility of perfection in everyone:Your fellow man is your mirror. If your own face is clean, the image youperceive will also be flawless.The reason he emphasized prayer and total observance was not to conform to thelaw, but to open a way for purity. The world as reflected in the eyes of a puresoul is perfect; the feeling it arouses is bliss, a sure sign of connection toGod. The implication for impurity was just as obvious:But should you look upon your fellow man and see a blemish, it is your ownimperfection that you are encountering—you are being shown what it is that youmust correct within yourself.The Baal Shem Tov was appalled by cynical teachers who pawned off fake miracles,and even more appalled by the rise of a self-proclaimed messiah, Jacob Frank,who eventually went so far overboard that he wanted his followers baptized, likeChristians. It’s easy to forget that when the New Testament was written, one ofits aims was to prove that Jesus of Nazareth was a good rabbi, fulfilling thelaw rather than breaking it. The Baal Shem Tov appears to reach across suchboundaries also, as when he quotes Leviticus:Do not seek revenge or bear a grudge against anyone among your people, but loveyour neighbor as yourself. (19:18)In a broad sense, everyone is a wanderer trying to find a rightful place in theworld; the spiritual dimension comes when you ask if your place is to serve God,which implies that “place” is not fixed by your home on earth. In the shtetl,popular teaching was done through familiar analogies. Besides his purelymystical message, the Baal Shem Tov follows in the long tradition of making Godhuman:When a father punishes his child, the suffering he inflicts on himself isgreater than anything experienced by the child. So it is with God: His pain isgreater than our pain.This wasn’t meant as a way of making suffering inevitable. As one can easilyunderstand, there was a strain of Jewish theology that already made sufferinginevitable. How could it not, to a people who had been outcasts for overseventeen centuries when Yisrael ben Eliezer was born? Instead, the Baal ShemTov uplifted the simplest of lives, prefiguring Leo Tolstoy’s ideal of thepeasant being closest to Christ. The poorest are the servants of God, and theBaal Shem Tov believed that to live was to serve God. Therefore, the poor showeveryone else a profound truth:The wholesome simplicity of the simple Jew touches on the utterly simple essenceof God. . . . When you hold a part of the essence, you hold all of it.For almost anyone today, this is an uncomfortable message. We no longer see thepoor as God’s beloved children; a gloss of shame and pity covers our eyes whenwe look on unending poverty. The Baal Shem Tov taught in a different age, stillvery close to the medieval, where poverty was an inescapable fact of life. Afterhe spent an afternoon scything wheat with the peasants, Tolstoy the noblemancould retreat to tea, a manor house, and velvet cushions. The Baal Shem Tovspent some early years under conditions close to slave labor, and even whenfamous he never attained real creature comfort.Panentheism turned the Jewish predicament on its head. Instead of livingnowhere, searching in vain for a home, Jews could look around and see the wholecosmos as their true home. In Hasidism, nature constantly delivers messages fromGod. No event is outside his gaze; nothing should be considered an accident.Everything is by Divine Providence. If a leaf is turned over by a breeze, it isonly because this has been specifically ordained by God.Naturally, this rings true with the vision of a Puritan like Anne Hutchinson.The Baal Shem Tov founded a movement to purify the faith, and because hedesperately needed confirmation from God, an absent deity was inconceivable. Godmust be watching at all times, sending signals of approval and disapproval viaeveryday events. Anne Hutchinson was enthusiastic about finding sermons instones, and so was the Baal Shem Tov.Even today, when Hasidic communities are tight enclaves all but invisible to thegeneral population, there is a theological bond between them and fundamentalistChristians: the bond of reading God’s private telegrams wired directly to thepure of heart. The evolution of God at this stage is more a reminder that he isstill paying attention. Each person must decide how to live under the gaze ofeternity. Ancient and modern history are linked by that duty."},{"pageContent":"10 [toc01.xhtml#cha10]Rabindranath Tagore [toc01.xhtml#cha10]“I Am the Endless Mystery” [toc01.xhtml#cha10]There was a hue and cry when the Ouija board arrived. The youngest girls in thefamily squealed with delight, while a housemaid cut the twine and peeled off thebrown wrapping paper. It didn’t seem strange that such a parcel had come all theway from London to Calcutta. Everything arrived in the post except for cook’sdaily supplies, which she ran to the market for as the sun rose.“How many do you cook for, anyway?” the vegetable seller asked as he packed longbeans and okra into a sack.“Don’t be nosy,” the cook said tartly.No one knew what went on behind those walls. Before they reached school age (orbefore they found a husband, if they were girls), the Tagore children never leftthe compound.“Run, run!” the boys cried, galloping down the halls to round up all fourteenchildren. The youngest, Rabi, didn’t run. He remained where he was most days,staring out a grated window at the city he was never allowed to set foot in.When one of his older brothers, Jyotir, appeared at the door, Rabi turned hishead. (Jyotir’s full name was Jyotirindranath, just as Rabi’s was Rabindranath,but they all used shorter nicknames.)“What is it, this thing that came?” Rabi asked. He liked hubbub, being a normalboy. But a natural reserve kept him from joining in.Jyotir was beside himself. “A telephone line to the dead! Can you believe it?”With that kind of buildup, it was impossible to resist the new thing, althoughit was disappointing to look at, a flat varnished board about the size of aserving tray on which large letters and numerals were painted. No matter. Rabiknew exactly which of the dead he wanted to talk to. The hours passed slowly. Itwas a lucky day, though; their father, Debendranath Tagore, who was rich, wouldcome home in the evening before leaving again on one of his endless trips.If only he knew more about the scene he left behind when he stepped out thedoor. It’s a misfortune when a child falls prey to cruelty. The misfortunedoubles when cruelty comes masked with a lie. It’s always the same lie: “This isfor your own good.”Behind his father’s back anyone felt free to give Rabi a casual smack. When theyheld his head underwater in the tin washing tub, the house servants would makesure to lift Rabi up before he blacked out. He sputtered and gasped, wonderingwhy they were smiling.“You’ll thank us one day. We are making you strong,” they said. They all tookpride in how moral they were, and strict in their religion too.The boy had good instincts and saw that this was a lie. Little good that didhim. The Tagores lived in a huge house, isolated from the outside world behind ahigh wall, yet the twisted maze didn’t mean there was room for escape. Everywing had resentful chambermaids, a bossy governess if a new baby had arrived,overworked sweepers, and outdoor gardeners—there was no end to his punishers.Since the boy was gentle and soft, the blows he received were bewildering asmuch as painful. But his mother had petted him, so he resolved to show that hewasn’t a whiner.The one kind servant he could hide behind was Kailash, the old groundskeeper whoseemed as dusty and worn out as Calcutta itself. Kailash was a joker, alwayshanging around the gates to tease whoever came and went.“What a beautiful sister you have,” he’d say when a girl arrived with herwizened grandmother. Or “How perfectly the gods have blessed you,” if a vainmiddle-aged dandy showed up without the gray hair he had the week before.As he handpicked fallen leaves off a patch of perfect lawn (kept immaculate toshow the colonials that an Indian could out-British the British), Kailashthanked God that he wasn’t a beggar on the streets. He never skipped a dailyoffering of marigolds to be laid at the feet of the Krishna statue standing witha seductive smile at the back of the garden.“He protects me. He protects us all,” Kailash explained when Rabi was four andold enough to be curious about everything.“How?” the boy asked.“By keeping the demons away, the rakshasas.”Two of the worst rakshasas, starvation and disease, roamed just beyond the highwall, and the old part of the city where the mansion stood had become degradedinto a place of thievery and prostitution. Rabi didn’t know why Krishna didn’tprotect them too, but when he heard shrieks and swearing outside his window atnight, there was every reason to make the compound a privileged prison. He clungto Kailash also out of need. His older brothers and sisters were married or atschool or surviving on their own. Their father had huge estates to attend toaround India, and his travels, which lasted months at a time, created a vacuum.“It’s a servocracy around here, old man,” Jyotir said, when he found Rabicrouching one day under a palm tree nursing a fresh bruise. Rabi didn’tunderstand this new word, or why Jyotir laughed, since he had just made it up.But he knew well enough that those on the bottom could royally hate those on thetop.The best thing about hiding behind Kailash was that the old man spun tales thatwere addictive. When in the mood, he wove garbled romances involving Rama, Sita,and Krishna, with any passing Western hero—a Galahad here, a Lochinvarthere—thrown into the mix. These last came to Kailash’s attention when helingered under a window while novels were read aloud to the assembled children.Learning was a constant business in the Tagore mansion, stepped up whenevertheir father came home, since he was a great one for history, astronomy, music,and painting, just to scratch the surface. His talk was a scattershot barrage offacts. Did Rabi know that the year he was born, 1861, Lincoln went to war tofree the slaves? It was the same year that the czar freed the serfs in Russia.Rabi’s head swam. He had never seen a slave or serf. Were they likeuntouchables? But after hours of studying, he always had an appetite forKailash’s romances, since the old servant was canny about naming several of thenoble princes, swains, and warriors “good Sir Rabindranath.” One tale stuck inRabi’s mind, about the two epic lovers Prince Rama and his beloved wife, Sita.“They were rich and beautiful. Life was too good,” Kailash said solemnly, “soLord Rama was banished to the forest for fourteen years.”Rabi, who wasn’t interested in filler, said, “Get to the part about the goldendeer.”“There was a deer made of gold, which means that you would starve to deathbefore being able to eat it.”Rabi stamped his foot. “That’s not the story. You forgot the demon.”Kailash, whose memory was growing somewhat feeble, suddenly remembered. “Ravana,the king of the demons, set eyes on Sita and fell instantly in love. He wantedher desperately, so he devised a trick. He ordered one of his magical servantsto create a golden deer to lure Rama to run after it with his bow and arrow.“The trick worked. Demons are hateful, but clever. Rama’s brother was Lakshmana,and he was a better brother even than the ones you have. He had joined thecouple in the forest, and now he drew a circle on the ground around Sita.“Don’t leave this circle,” he ordered. “My duty is to protect you, and whileRama and I chase the golden deer, you will be safe here.”“She won’t do it,” said Rabi, who enjoyed predicting parts of a tale that heknew by heart.Kailash sighed. “Too true. When the brothers were gone, Ravana disguised himselfas a beggar, crippled and bent over and whining, ‘Oh, kind, kind lady, won’t yougive me a scrap to eat?’“Sita took pity on him and stepped outside the circle. Bang! The king of thedemons turned back into himself again. He snatched her up, and off they flew inhis magic flying chariot.”Rabi nodded wisely. “Men will learn to fly soon.”Kailash shook his head. “Don’t you believe it. That’s the same as asking Ravanato come back again.”Despite the thrill of Sita’s kidnapping, they both knew that it was only amatter of time before Rama hunted Ravana down to dispatch his ten heads andtwenty arms. But one day Rabi refused to hear the tale again. An eavesdroppingservant had gotten wind of it, and the next morning he and two others grabbedRabi out of bed. They drew a chalk circle on the floor and plunked him in themiddle.It was just after dawn, and nature called, but when the boy got up to use thechamber pot, the servants hit him with sticks.“Be a good little Sita,” they teased. Another trial he kept to himself.Later that month, the old man Kailash suddenly died of fever. Being seven, Rabiwas more curious than grief-stricken. What did it mean to die? Where was Kailashnow if not hanging around the gates to joke at the expense of rich people?And that same evening brought the arrival of carriage lamps, and servants,bidden by Rabi’s mother, rushed with torches to unload the master’s luggage.Debendranath embraced his wife and looked at their brood with happysatisfaction. His pride in so many sons and daughters was like an iridescentbubble that none of them wanted to burst by telling him about the servocracy. Hestrode into the parlor trailing instructions and promises after him.“I’ve planned a trip to a hill station near Nepal. Who wants to go? And we aregetting a piano for the Westerners when they come to the house for music. Oh, Ihave some toffee in my valise. Tell the cook it’s not for boiling; we’ll eat itafter dinner.” And so on, each word like a gift dropped from a benignbenefactor. The Ouija board was also a gift, but their father raised hiseyebrows when he saw it set up neatly on a tea table surrounded with cushionsfor the children to sit on.“Ah, that. Did I order it? I must have.”He was such a curiosity seeker that there was no chance he would ignore thesupernatural contraption or send it back. The Tagores hurried through supper tocut short the suspense before they telephoned the dead. Rabi was the pet, andhis request was honored first.“Kailash. There’s no way he won’t have a joke for us. Being dead won’t stophim,” he said.His father agreed and sat down before the board, placing his fingers lightlyover the planchette, the little device that skated over the board to spell outwords as the dead sent them through. The grown children weren’t believers andstruck poses of knowing boredom. The instruction booklet said that everyparticipant could lay their fingers on the planchette, but their father decidedthat only Rabi would be permitted at first.They dimmed the lights and took their places on the scattered cushions. Theroom, although far from the kitchen, captured the warm smell of saffron and naanbread. Rabi might have grown drowsy if his nerves weren’t set on edge.“What happens now?”His father screwed up his eyes staring at the instructions in the near darkness.“Call upon one of the dead by name.”So father and son put on a solemn face, sitting across from each other withtheir fingers poised on the planchette.“Kailash, it’s me. Are you there?” Rabi called, addressing the air over hishead, the most likely place where heaven might be located.At first nothing happened, but gradually the planchette started to quiver, andthen with surprising speed it moved to the word “Yes” embossed on one corner ofthe board.“You moved it on purpose,” accused his father.“No, I swear,” Rabi blurted out.“We don’t swear in this house. I believe you. I didn’t move it either. How odd,”his father murmured. “Ask the old rascal a question. What do we have to lose?”Rabi didn’t hesitate. “What’s it like to be dead?”The other children laughed, but his father nodded in agreement. What betterquestion could one ask of the dead?The planchette started moving again, and as it paused over various letters, theyrealized that Kailash wasn’t going to abridge his answer. Someone ran to fetchpencil and paper. Rabi was too busy calling out letters to group them intowords. Suddenly the message was done, and everyone around him was smiling.“What is it?” he asked.The paper was passed to him, and it read, WHY SHOULD YOU GET SO CHEAPLY WHAT IHAD TO DIE TO FIND OUT?“Cheeky monkey,” their father muttered, but behind his amusement Debendranathwas a little impressed. The game went on as other children crowded Rabi out ofthe way. Kailash refused to communicate anything more, and Rabi went to bed thatnight clutching the paper. It felt to the boy not like a scrap of scribbledwords, but a scrap of his only friend returned to life. Or had Kailash managedto die without dying?That night Rabi saw an endless ocean in his dreams. A tiny speck bobbed on thewaves, which turned out to be a rowboat. Kailash was rowing, looking as dustyand worn out as he had when picking leaves off the lawn, and his passenger wasRabi’s mother. He was sure of it, although the woman never fully turned her faceto him. The next morning the boy awoke with gummy eyelids, as if it werepossible to cry while you were fast asleep. When he was eleven, Rabi got to see the hill station his father had promisedhim. They made their way north by slow degrees, stopping at several estates thefamily owned. As their carriage passed, the local farmers would leave theirplows and run up to the road to prostrate themselves in the dust.“Are you their god?” Rabi asked, but his father didn’t reply. He didn’t evensmile in his indulgent way, which he usually did if the boy asked a cleverquestion.Up and up the northern roads winded as they neared the Himalayas. Rabi stuck hishead out the window, despite the cold April air, breathing in this green worldof deep gorges and waterfalls. Dense forest would suddenly break out into vistasof the high peaks. He’d never seen snow, but he could feel it on his shoulderjust by staring at the white caps on the mountains.They switched from the train to a horse cart, and then a town, called Dalhousie,rounded the bend. Rabi burst out laughing. It was a cluster of gingerbreadhouses that comically duplicated a quaint English village.“Homesickness,” his father whispered.The hill stations were built for British families as a summer retreat, an escapefrom the terrible fevers that killed many women and children if they riskedstaying in Delhi or Calcutta. But after his initial surprise, Rabi was blind toeverything but the natural wonder of the place. Being shut up in a mansion allhis life, he had fantasized about the world he couldn’t enter. Now it explodedin every direction, and the vastness made him dizzy. He had the strangesensation of being the center of everything he saw, an invisible point of awe.There was something else too. He had been given the sacred thread, which was amajor step to manhood for all Indians. The ceremony, called upanayana, wasancient and solemn, a rite of passage that Lord Rama would have knelt down toreceive. Priests chanted mantras in an atmosphere of incense, fruits, andflowers; there was a sacred fire into which offerings were made. Rabi felt as ifthe fragrant fumes were lifting him up. When the three-stranded cotton cord waslaid across his shoulders, he trembled. A faint shock went through his body, andwith wide eyes he gazed at his father, who understood.“It’s real. Invisible things can be real,” his father murmured.Rabi believed him. It was like the cold dusting of snow on his shoulders. Hefelt it when he read about the mountains; images formed in his mind, mysteriousand vivid, even before he set eyes on the real snowcapped peaks. But he wonderedwhy the sacred thread always seemed to rest on him now.They stayed in the hill station for three months, in a rented bungalow withmountain grandeur outside the window and a frigid stream close by where fatherand son bathed every morning. He was given biographies to read and historybooks, astronomy lessons (which Rabi loved, since he could take the star mapsout at night while gazing at the wondrously clear sky, like black crystal), andtables of Sanskrit verbs. Rabi knew no other life, so none of this seemedunusual, not even the meager food and long hours of meditation that his fatherimposed. The shared routine was their bond.One day they were out for a walk when his father recalled something.“You asked me if our people thought I was a god?” His father always said “ourpeople,” because he disliked words like “peasant” and “servant.”He pointed to a ragged boy squatting by the side of the road. He was a Dalit,considered untouchable by tradition and long prejudice. The boy stared at theground, making himself invisible until they passed. When Debendranath gesturedto him, the Dalit hesitated. On the rare occasion when an upper-caste strangergave him a small coin, it was always thrown at him so that no contact would bemade. Some Brahmins went home and bathed if the shadow of a Dalit fell acrossthem.When the boy got close enough, Debendranath said, “Sit with us. I want to tellmy son why you are a god.”Startled, the Dalit stammered, “But I need a bath.”He blushed for uttering something stupid. He wasn’t happy in the first place tobe in the presence of rich strangers.Rabi’s father held out a water bag. “Drink and rest in the shade. My boy isinterested in gods, and we can’t disappoint him.”The Dalit did as he was told.Debendranath turned to Rabi. “Why is this boy a god? If you were his mother, shewould say that he is exceptionally beautiful, like a temple statue. Our eyeswander to beauty naturally, without being told to. Beauty has a power of itsown, whether in a lovely young girl or the tree we are sitting beneath.”The Dalit gaped, but Rabi was used to his father’s way of talking. The onlything that made him squirm was the reference to pretty girls.“Nature is rich in beauty,” his father went on. “We don’t ask why. We simplyaccept it. But what happens when the beautiful girl departs and is out of sight?What happens when we leave the temple and its statues? Beauty still lingers. Oureyes have nothing to see, yet something lingers in the heart. We feel touched,and if something is beautiful enough, we feel inspired.”Rabi couldn’t grasp every word, but he knew what his father meant. When he wentto sleep at night in their bungalow, the darkness was filled with a presencelike perfume. He had even told his father about it.“I call this the scent of beauty,” his father said. “If you follow perfumewafting down a dark alley at night, it can lead anywhere. It could even lead todanger, but we follow anyway. Similarly, we trail after beauty, hungering tofind its source. For surely to be in your mother’s arms is better than simplyremembering her scent.”Rabi’s mother had stayed at home, but he had no trouble remembering thepatchouli she wore. If he shut his eyes, the scent came back by itself, like avoice from a faraway land.Debendranath looked over at the Dalit, who was holding the water bag halfway tohis mouth.“You can drink from it,” Rabi’s father said, nodding. The boy hesitated. Itdidn’t seem possible that he wouldn’t contaminate the water. But the day hadgrown fiercely hot, even near the mountains, and he gulped down a few big swigs.Rabi was silent, sunk in thought.His father said, “Heed what I’m saying. Beauty makes us follow it. Everyoneknows this, but most cannot see the mystery. They think that the way to pursuebeauty is to run after the next girl who intoxicates them. Or perhaps moneyintoxicates them instead, or power. But beauty is a mystery because it comesfrom God. I brought you to the hill station so that you can see God everywhere.But really all you see is the scent he leaves behind. Or call it his secretmessages.”“What do the messages say?” asked Rabi, who liked puzzles.“They say, ‘Follow me’,” his father replied.“Where?”Without answering, his father lightly tapped Rabi in the middle of his chest.“You cannot possess God. The mystery remains endless, all the days of our life.But you can feel it inside and cherish that feeling, like a precious pearl.”The Dalit was bored, having never heard such talk. He wasn’t interested in Rabi,although the two boys were about the same age. Without a doubt the stranger’sson would pelt him with rocks the moment his father’s back was turned. The twostrangers grew quiet, a good time for the Dalit to escape. He put down the waterbag skin and crept away.“He’s afraid of us,” Rabi said when he noticed what had happened. The Dalit wasstill in sight, but a good fifty yards down the road already.“He’d be much more afraid if you told him who he really is. People crave to hearthat they are part of God, but when they hear it, they feel ashamed. A pity.”His father had retreated into a kind of bemused detachment. Rabi knew this moodvery well. It was predictable, in fact. Every time his father waxed passionateabout a subject, immediately he seemed to be sucked into himself. The retreatdidn’t make him sad, but he would be unreachable for moments or hours. Rabiunderstood, since he was much the same way. So they let the Dalit escape withouthanding him a rupee. Father and son gazed at the clouds gathering like mistyfleece over the far peaks. Since the mystery is different for everyone, nobodycan tell if they were thinking the same thoughts. At least they shared the samesky, which was enough. God, Rabi found, was like chasing a train. On the way to the station yourcarriage is blocked by a cowherd. By the time you make it to the platform,red-faced and breathless, the train is gone, leaving only wisps of smoke and theacrid smell of cinders. But you must get to Delhi, so you push on to the nextstation, and there too the train has just left. The same thing happens townafter town, until you only meet up with the train when you have traveled all theway to Delhi and find it sitting in the yard, grinning at you. The differencewith God is that most people reach death before they reach Delhi.Death in the family had been the problem all along. After the old servantKailash, it was Rabi’s mother, who was taken when he was thirteen. Then it washis father, but Rabi was over forty by then, so the world considered it natural.Another old man, this one rich and famous, received an obsequious obituary. Theworld had no idea. Rabi had not just grown up under his parents’ noses. He hadseen life and love through his mother, as he saw mind and service through hisfather.Where did these gifts come from? Where did they go?He sat on the porch overlooking the grounds of his estate. No one called himRabi anymore, only Rabindranath. People murmured the name as they bent to touchhis feet. Everything revolved around him—a family, a school, the local farmers,the struggle for Indian independence. In all this busy round, Rabindranath knewonly one thing: he was chasing the train to Delhi.When the becalmed air of noon settled over the activity on the estate, he likedto dictate. He was doing it that day.“I slept and dreamed that life was joy. I awoke and saw that life was service. Iacted and behold, service was joy.”Tagore paused, glancing over at the young male secretary squatting on the porch.“Did you get that?”The secretary nodded and smiled. The heat wasn’t too suffocating near the coolmanor house, and he was privileged to serve Bengal’s greatest writer. Rabi hadgrown into that. The secretary modestly bent over his notepad, ready for thenext line. What was he really thinking? Maybe nothing. Maybe he sat at Rabi’sfeet in silent awe. It would do no good to ask him. We are all mysteries toourselves, and when we start to think, we are eavesdropping on messages sentfrom beyond.That could be the next line, but it flew out of Tagore’s mind before he couldvoice it. A pretty young woman had run up dressed in a sky-blue sari trimmedwith gold thread. She was a niece, the daughter of one of his brothers, so shedared to grab him by the hand and pull him away.“Not so fast,” he protested. It was a joke, because everyone marveled that, atfifty, he had a boy’s restless energy. He played at letting his niece drag himreluctantly across the lawn. The performance couldn’t start without him. Thedancers today were children from the local village. He worked constantly toimprove their lot.Many were Dalits, which was ironic. Tagore had written countless poems andstories about untouchables. Readers were shocked at the inner lives of thesecreatures and moved by their struggles. It was a new way of looking at peoplewhose shadow used to make them cringe. The money from the stories helped pay forthe school where Dalit children could be raised up. It must have been the firsttime in history that money came from loving untouchables instead of working themto death.The hall was noisy when he stepped in; it instantly grew quiet. The parents whohad come with their children shushed them. He mounted the stage and held a pieceof paper close to his eyes. Any gathering expected some words from RabindranathTagore, which were received like scripture. Hadn’t the king of England knightedhim? But Sir Rabindranath sent back the honor as a protest against colonialism.Now he recited slowly, knowing that for three-quarters of his audience, whocouldn’t read or sign their names, many words would be difficult.When the lotus opened, I didn’t notice and went away empty-handed.Only now and again do I suddenly sit up from my dreams to smell a strangefragrance.It comes on the south wind, a vague hint that makes me ache with longing, likethe eager breath of summer wanting to be completed.I didn’t know what was so near, or that it was mine.This perfect sweetness blossoming in the depths of my heart.A grateful murmur went through the hall. Whatever they didn’t understand, thepeople felt. A few started to applaud, the ones sophisticated enough to knowthat you can clap for poetry; it wasn’t really scripture. The children rushednoisily on stage in their costumes, and the sitar and drums were alreadystarting before Tagore took his place in the front row.His niece looked over at him with concern. He knew that look very well. Since1905, the year his father died, death’s nose had sniffed out the others heturned to for love—his wife, then two of his children. A tragedy. Everyone saidso, and they worried for him. But was any of it real? The question penetratedhis grief, and when he went to sleep at night, he sometimes imagined the smellof cinders. Dangling death from his fingers, God was racing ahead.Which was why death pervaded so many of Tagore’s Dalit stories. The people hegrew up with, the rich and the good, didn’t know how their closest servantsdied, except that it must be like dumb animals, silently suffering, then whiningbriefly before they closed their eyes. In the Tagore family Kailash had diedthat way, but not another old man whom Rabi loved. He died extraordinarily.Srikanath Babu was like a plump, round fruit on legs. He had a shining,clean-shaven face and a bald head as smooth as a mango. Kailash had wooed Rabiby building romantic tales around him, but Srikanath Babu was the boy’s firstcritic, and the most perfect he ever had. Nothing Rabi wrote was greeted withanything less than ecstasy.“Ah, I could sing those words going to heaven!” Srikanath Babu would exclaim.So feverish was his enthusiasm that, before the precocious boy had finishedreciting a new poem, the old man would jump up, run to Rabi’s father’s room, andburst in to sing the first lines. Many of these poems were kirtans, ordevotional songs. A lover of music, Srikanath Babu was never seen without asitar in his lap. By his side always stood a smoke-filled hubble-bubble, as thelocals called a hookah.Srikanath Babu sang peculiarly as he strummed his sitar, because he no longerhad a tooth in his head. Amazingly, this too was a cause for joy.“Why should I trouble my poor mouth with sharp fangs?” he said.He could not tolerate to hear about suffering and death. Rabi’s brothers knewhow to torment Srikanath Babu to the point of tears. They had only to read himlegends of Prince Rama or the warrior Arjuna in which a character was pierced byarrows or hacked with a sword. Srikanath Babu would thrust his arms out, as ifpushing away a snake, and beg them to stop.The day came when Rabi’s father was a bedridden invalid enduring his finalillness. He was resting at his leafy river estate near the town of Chinsura.Srikanath Babu was desperate to see him one last time. He himself was very illand could only walk with the aid of his grown daughter. The two of them took atrain to Chinsura. There was great anxiety about undertaking such a journey.Srikanath Babu was able to see only if he took his fingers and held his eyelidsopen for a moment.He survived the trip, though, and was taken immediately into Debendranath’ssickroom. Srikanath Babu lifted his eyelids and wept at the sight. He couldhardly speak, and in fact left without saying a word as the patient slept.“Didn’t you want to greet him?” his daughter asked.Srikanath Babu, who was humming softly to himself, shook his head. “I touchedthe dust of his feet. That was why I came.” Two days later he died in the littlecottage by the river that they had provided him.Death had undone everyone in Rabi’s life in a different way. Most were at peace,but one, the wife of his brother Jyotir, smiled one day, gently pointed out weakspots in a new poem of his, and then took her own life in the night. Each timehe was unable to escape a spell of dark depression. At the same time, hewondered more and more what it meant to die. There were things you had to knowif you wanted to unravel life’s secrets—love, truth, beauty, but also death. Hejotted down any thoughts that might bring him an answer, and the astonishingpart was that when he felt close to the mystery, so did his readers.Sometimes he touched on the tenderness wrapped up in sorrow:My heart beats in waveson the shore of the worldAnd writes its name in tearswith these words:“I love you.”But more often he wondered at things no words could express:What do I long for?Something that is felt in the nightBut not seen in the day.He must have been sunk in such thoughts, because the next thing Tagore knew, thehall was filled with the sound of clapping. The performance was over. Proudparents were smiling. The children onstage were bowing; the musicians staringaround, impatient to get to tiffin, their afternoon meal.No one could rise before the master did, so Tagore smiled at the children andsaid, “Go, go!” Under a tent beside the hall treats were laid out on tables.His niece waited at the door, renewing her concerned look. It would have helpedmore if she wore Srikanath’s unquenchable smile. His jollity would have beenfoolish in another person, even idiotic. But people never mocked him behind hisback.“Do you ever think about God?” Rabi had asked as a boy.“Always. What else is there to think about? The world takes care of itself, nomatter how hard people try to run it.”“And what do you know about God?” Rabi asked.“Only one thing,” replied Srikanath Babu, puffing on his hubble-bubble. “God isan endless mystery.”Tagore patted his niece’s hand when she tucked it into his arm. They started tocross the lawn to the refreshment tent. “Do you recall old Srikanath Babu?” heasked. “I seem to hear his voice today.”“How could I? I wasn’t born yet,” his niece said. She kept her eyes peeled foranything on the ground that might trip her aging uncle, as if she were escortinga Dresden doll to a tea party.“He was very fond of me,” mused Tagore. “And he came to a good end. But that’snot what was on my mind. He taught me the only important thing I ever heardabout God.”Tagore repeated to his niece the comment about God being an endless mystery.“It’s funny that such a simple remark should stick with me, but it did, foryears. And then I saw what Srikanath Babu really meant.”They had arrived safely at the tent, and his niece looked around for a chairwhere the Dresden doll wouldn’t be disturbed. “What did he mean?” she askedabsentmindedly.“God has to be a mystery,” Tagore replied. “Because the only one who couldexplain him is himself, and no one bothers to ask him anymore.” What was driving him? Restlessness. It had become an irresistible force. WhenTagore arrived at a new place, which could be Buenos Aires or Shanghai,reporters milled around, craning their necks to get a better look. Here wassomething you don’t see every day, a tall old man in flowing silk robes. He worea long white beard, like an eternal grandfather or Merlin the magician. When heleaned into the microphones, blinking at the popping flashbulbs, he saiduplifting things, which everyone wanted to believe.“Love is not a mere impulse. It must contain truth, which is law.”That was his stock in trade, uplift. No one snickered, although some mentallyrolled their eyes.“Every child comes with the message that God is not yet discouraged aboutmankind. “The voice was sonorous, the eyes remarkable, wide and liquid. But what world wasTagore living in?Hitler was on the rise; the markets had crashed in 1929. What did the Indiansage have to say about things that matter in the real world?“We live in the world when we love it.”Hopeless. At least Gandhi had a cause worth space on the front page. Tagore wason record as disliking mass protests, even for Indian independence. Thereporters bent over their notepads, but everyone in the room knew that thiswould be a story filed under “local color.”Yet he never stopped his journey, lasting for decades now, to far corners of theworld. Every poet is restless. The muse is a demanding mistress. But he had themystery before him, always to follow, never to capture. Tagore wasn’t blind. Hesaw the skepticism in reporters’ eyes. He could envision them loosening theirneckties after he left the room, glad that the sermon was over and they couldescape to the closest bar for a drink.Where had his restlessness carried him now? Somewhere near Potsdam, the mapsaid.“A pleasant place, serene,” he murmured gazing out the car window. “Can I walkthe rest of the way? The trees are reaching out.”The driver, who was a round-faced German, didn’t want to say no, but he didn’twant to deviate from his assigned duty either. The professor was sittingpatiently in his small brown house with the red tile roof. A new batch ofreporters was milling around, not just Germans but French, Poles, even someAmericans, who had the best cigarettes. Trees could wait. But the driver let theold man out a little short of the path to the front door, so he could have hisserenity.Tagore took his time among the slender trees that seemed like maidens with theirdelicate leaves swaying in the breeze. He was seventy, and the forest meant moreto him than did Hitler. The reporters would seize on things he said againstGandhi’s total pacifism. “Did Gandhi want to invite Herr Hitler and SignorMussolini to take whatever they wanted?”The real world. It kept racing on its frantic pace, fueled by the next crisis.In such a world, what fuels peace?He forced himself to abandon the forest and walked up the path to the house.Seeing him out the window, the professor adjusted his formal coat and steppedout on the porch. This was the moment. Cameras were raised. The great Tagore wasshaking hands with the great Einstein. It was like a collision of planets.In the hubbub Einstein leaned over and whispered. “I memorized a line of yours.‘We come nearest to greatness when we are great in humility.’ I believe it.”Tagore smiled. Not because of a flattering quote. He sensed something. When yougot close, the famous face of Einstein—the whirligig white hair, caterpillareyebrows, and sagging eyelids—didn’t prepare you for the secret he carriedinside.Tagore leaned over and whispered back. “I would memorize your words, butunfortunately they are all numbers.”They retreated inside, where there were tea and comfortable chairs. After amoment, a rare thing happened: two great men became genuinely interested in eachother. Einstein didn’t want to talk about world peace or the Nazis and thedanger that would drive him out of Germany if it grew worse against the Jews. Hehad God on his mind.“Do you think God is separate from us?”“No. Human nature is infinite. It can reach the divine.”“How?”“By merging with ultimate reality. We live in a human universe. Eternityreflects the eternal human. You have been busy hunting down time and space. Italk about the eternal human because without us, there is no time and space.”Einstein sat back. They regarded each other, and he saw immediately thatsomething huge was at stake.Forming his words carefully, Einstein said, “There have always been two views ofthe universe. One says that the world exists even if human beings were wiped offthe face of the earth. The other says that there could be no universe withouthuman beings.”Tagore nodded. “Quite right.”“But if no one was inside this house, that table would still exist.”“Why does the table exist?” Tagore asked. “Because someone perceives it. As anindividual, you feel separate from the table, so it appears to be independent ofyou. But the cosmic mind contains everything. Nothing can exist unless it isperceived, and Brahman sees everything.”“In science we collect facts, and that leads to truth,” Einstein countered.“Gravity existed long before human beings arrived, don’t you agree?” Einstein’stone was certain. He was famous for once saying that he hoped the moon stillexisted even if he stopped looking at it.Tagore shrugged. “If there is absolute truth outside what human beings canunderstand, it is unreachable by your facts. The universe exists as it relatesto humans.”Einstein allowed himself a wicked laugh. “Then I am more religious than youare!”Their words were taken down by a reporter and sent around the world. Theconversation lasted three days. People were divided. It seemed amazing thatEinstein, who had baffled the greatest minds with relativity, making timestretch like a rubber band, would ask a poet’s opinion about the universe.Tagore’s answers, it was agreed, were high-minded, but no match for science. Theeternal human? The cosmic mind? A famous English philosopher wrote to a friendsaying that he would have to avoid Tagore the next time he came to London. Hisideas were too embarrassing, a rubbishy jumble.But in the small house, with just the two of them, Einstein grew pensive. Therewas a famous Greek statue of Apollo that he had gazed at in the Vatican.“If there were no human beings anymore,” he said, “then the Apollo Belvederewould no longer be beautiful?”“No.”“I agree with regard to beauty, but not to truth.”“Why not?” Tagore shot back. “Truth is realized through humans too.”Einstein kept talking because he wasn’t embarrassed by Tagore. “The mind of God”was a phrase he had used himself. Religious people who worried about science asan enemy sighed with relief when he said that he wanted to know the mind of God.He didn’t practice any religion, and he disbelieved in God the Father, the Godof Jewish tradition. Yet something at the far horizon of the universe filled himwith awe and wonder. It wasn’t his brain that had unfolded relativity; it waswonder.“Whatever God may be,” Einstein said, “perhaps it is best that he stays out ofreach. The unknown drives me on, and I solve the unknown through science.”“But even science is an activity of scientific humans,” Tagore replied. “Yourfacts don’t exist outside the man who sees and measures.”Einstein shook his head. “I cannot prove that my conception is right, but it ismy religion.”In the end, two planets didn’t collide. They slid past each other. In passing,they exchanged glances. If you looked, the air was breathable on both planets;the landscape wasn’t alien.Other news swept their meeting off the front pages. Worse was coming to worsteverywhere. People started saying that this depression was the Great Depression.Hitler grew more frightening by the day. The train was leaving the station fullof the disillusioned. Tagore could wave at them from the platform if he wantedto. He was already being forgotten anyway.But this wasn’t his experience, which remained luminous. God remained elusive,but a radiance presented itself every day. Inside the radiance a voicewhispered, “I am here.” Tagore obeyed his restlessness until he couldn’t. Hisbody surrendered to illness; the days became a trial of pain. He was glad to bealone with the radiance, which didn’t fade despite his physical agonies. Anotherworld war came and spread untold catastrophe. He was nearly eighty. Death stoodat the door, but didn’t enter his room for two more years.Tagore could meet death’s eye, and therefore it had no power to do anything butwait. Words had to release the poet before life would. Tagore asked for someoneto take down a poem one day, even though he hardly had enough energy to wet hislips from the water glass by his bedside. In a thready voice he began,I have given completelywhatever I had to give.He stopped, gasping for air. There was no letting go yet.In return, if I receive anything—some love, some forgiveness—then I will take it with mewhen I step on the boat . . .Nothing more came. The bedroom was silent and still. The old friend who wastaking dictation thought he heard a rattle in the dying poet’s throat. It wouldbe a shame if his final verse was cut short.The old friend softly got up to fetch the nurse, only to be stopped by amovement he caught out of the corner of his eye. Tagore had made a weak wave ofthe hand. The thready voice returned, and the old friend leaned close to catchTagore’s faint mumble.When I set foot on the boatthat takes me acrossto the festival of an end without words.Then nothing more. Death no longer waited courteously at the door. Outside, thebreeze was reduced to a faint stirring. Barely enough to make the leaves trembleon the crest of the trees, barely enough to stir the hair of maidens.Revealing the Vision“Today the light of mysticism went out.” The obituary for Rabindranath Tagorecould have included that sentence when he passed away in August 1941. He was thelast great mystical poet to achieve world fame, and almost the last mystic inthe public eye. A momentous change had occurred as science replaced religion inmodern life. Tagore bridged both worlds, thanks to his highly Westernizededucation at his father’s knee. He would become a mystic in the line of GiordanoBruno, who made no distinction between scientific wonder and spiritual awe.For Christians of the high Victorian era that Tagore was born in, the age offaith, already waning by the time of Shakespeare, still drew breath. As long asGod couldn’t be understood, he held power. Saints were like scientists whojourneyed into the unknown and came back to report, through their mysticalexperiences, that God was real.We take it for granted that faith is inferior to facts when it comes to decidingwhat is real and what is illusion. Tagore didn’t accept this truism. He insistedthat God’s reality was not threatened by uncovering scientific facts. He wasn’tstumping for faith, however. Referring to a mystical inner journey, he said,“You can’t cross the sea merely by standing and staring at the water.” Or bymeasuring the ocean waves with a scientific instrument, he might have added.His mysticism wasn’t dismissed for being out of touch, which is surprising.Tagore was writing to a worried world, and when people read Gitanjali, his bookof rapturous songs to God, it was thrilling to find someone who was immersed inlove for the divine, a love so all-consuming that it was like drowning.Thou hast made me endless, such is thy pleasure.This frail vessel thou emptiest again and again,and fillest it ever with fresh life.Readers were entranced. The intoxication of Rumi had returned, seven centurieslater.This little flute of a reed thou hast carried over hills and dales,and hast breathed through it melodies eternally new.For a time Tagore was a sensation. He was the first non-European to receive theNobel Prize for literature, which came in 1913, only three years after Gitanjaliwas written and, even more astonishingly, only a year after it appeared inEnglish. That same year he toured the United States and Great Britain,displaying the restlessness that carried him to every corner of the globe forthe next twenty years.The West’s enthusiasm for Tagore was feverish, but it wasn’t destined to last.His message of love as an eternal mystery didn’t jibe with the unspeakablehorrors of World War I. What was rapture compared with machine guns and armoredtanks? In the face of criticism, Tagore’s certainty was powerful. He stood in aspiritual tradition that went back five thousand years to roots in ancientIndia. He had inherited a profound view of life that had survived manycatastrophes. Labeling this tradition with a single word—mystical—gives it shortshrift. Everything about human existence, including love, death, truth, andbeauty, needed the foundation provided by God. God justified the mystery oflife. He gave human beings a soul and a lord to surrender to. The violence andconflict inherent in human nature found an escape in the belief that beyond war,crime, power struggles, greed, and evil deeds, we are essentially divine.If Tagore’s had been an isolated voice, I doubt that Einstein would have takenhim seriously or even agreed to meet him. Their conversations, which took placeover three days in 1930 inside Einstein’s small house outside Potsdam, made theworld listen. Lengthy verbatim accounts were printed in major newspapers. Butthis wasn’t entirely the clash of religion and science. Einstein was constantlyconsulted for his opinions about God. He was both brilliant and benign. UnlikeDarwin, who was bitterly opposed to the conventional religious piety of theVictorian era, Einstein wanted God to exist in some form. He famously said,“Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind.”In other words, Einstein held out hope for cooperation, not just compromise.People could see the horror of a godless world, and yet God needed to becompatible with modern life. When Tagore met Einstein, he was almost seventy andEinstein just past fifty. They recognized in each other two men who had thoughtdeeply about the nature of reality. This is why, I think, they spoke as equals,even though Einstein would never become a religionist. Tagore had made astatement about love that turned into a major quotation: “Love is not a mereimpulse. It must contain truth, which is law.” Einstein was too much thephysicist to allow “truth” and “law” to be used so loosely. Yet he went downTagore’s path farther than one would have expected.Their points of agreement are striking. Both held that God was a mystery beyondcomplete understanding. To Tagore, this mystery was internal, wrapped up in themystery of the human heart. To Einstein, it was external, poised at the edge ofthe knowable universe. Yet he agreed, surprisingly, that the material worldcouldn’t be proven to exist. In fact, this point had been troubling modernphysics, well outside the walls of the church.Quantum physics didn’t set out at the turn of the century to destroy the pictureof the physical world that we receive through the five senses. There was noagenda to turn atoms into clouds of energy, to make time expand and contract, orto declare that the subatomic world was entirely ruled by uncertainty. However,by 1930 all of these things turned out to be true. Physics shocked itself, andEinstein wasn’t the only quantum pioneer who looked with doubt and no smalldegree of dread at what he had uncovered.He found himself forced to make a choice between two views of reality. One campof physicists surrendered to the fact of radical uncertainty. Nothing was trulysolid or even physical; electrons behaved like waves in one mode and particlesin another. If the building blocks of the universe no longer had any fixedphysical properties, turning into ghosts, then why believe that the universeitself was any different? Einstein, who freely said that he wanted to know themind of God, could not accept a random universe where every event was a matterof chance. He believed that nature existed in an orderly, stable way, eventhough he couldn’t prove it. His camp was much smaller than the camp that wantedto topple all absolutes, and by 1930 he was isolated, quickly turning into asemitragic figure. His great discoveries were already behind him. He wasclinging to ideas that other great physicists, such as Niels Bohr, ErwinSchrödinger, and Werner Heisenberg, had shaken off ten years before.The public, with its simplistic image of Einstein as the greatest mind in theworld—if not of all time—didn’t realize his actual position. But he laid it outfor Tagore, and the irony is that the Indian mystical poet held a view that wasmuch closer to quantum physics, as it eventually matured, than Einstein did.Tagore declared that the observer creates perceived reality, that absolute truthwas unattainable through objective facts. His was a ghostly world too, just likethe realm of subatomic particles. Ideas so radical that Einstein couldn’t bringhimself to believe in them turned out to feel quite natural to Tagore.We should remember that Tagore was always more than a poet; in today’s terms hewas a polymath, and he had been brought up in a privileged household where thechildren were taught mathematics and the natural sciences. Such a backgroundallowed him to make sharp replies to Einstein. The sharpest came when Einsteinmade the point that was the bedrock of his beliefs. A beautiful sculpture likethe Apollo Belvedere, he said, would no longer be beautiful if there were nohuman beings to gaze upon it. But it didn’t take an observer to create truth,meaning the truth about what is real and what isn’t. If every human beingdisappeared, the table that sat in the room would still exist.Tagore came back with a quick denial. If beauty depends upon human beings, sodoes reality itself. The table didn’t take its existence from any singleindividual. Obviously there was still a table in the room if the room was emptyof people. But the table needed something outside materialism—the cosmic mind—inorder to exist. The chain of logic was very clear: we only know what is realthrough our consciousness. If anything is real outside our awareness, it willremain unknown. Because consciousness is so central—letting us see, hear, touch,taste, and smell the world—we must find out where it came from. Otherwise, weare like dreamers wandering in a world they take to be real, because no one hastold them that they are asleep.So where did consciousness come from? The only viable answer was that it camefrom itself. This is the mystical position, and few have voiced it asbeautifully in modern times as Tagore when he portrays himself as a tiny speckin the infinity of God’s creation.At the immortal touch of thy handsmy little heart loses its limits in joyand gives birth to utterance ineffable. Thy infinite gifts come to me onlyon these very small hands of mine.Ages pass, and still thou pourest,and still there is room to fill.We are not alone, then, as conscious beings. God or Brahman or the universalmind—pick your own terminology—surrounds us. It is our source and origin. Theonly reason that we can begin to understand the universe is that its laws andorderliness aren’t random. Every atom fits into a scheme that is innatelyorderly, not to mention beautiful, intelligent, loving, and all-knowing.Because he worried about these things too, Einstein understood the logic ofTagore’s worldview. Modern physics had already dismantled the physical world farenough that reality was looking more and more like a dream. Still, Einsteinclung to what he called his religion: a belief that the universe was real as itappeared, not needing human beings to give it shape, form, color, sounds, andall the rest. It is quite moving to view Einstein in the midst of such confusingemotions. His doubts had placed him outside Judaism and quantum physics at thesame time, standing on crumbling ground.Tagore, on the other hand, never wavered. When he spoke of the “eternal human”and a “human universe,” he was using deceptively simple words for complexancient ideas. This was the inner journey of Buddha, Jesus, Lao-tzu, Zoroaster,Plato, Rumi, and every other spiritual seeker. For them all, the human mindreflects the divine mind. Thousands of years before Tagore, the Vedic sages haddeclared, “The world is as you are.” There is no separation between what happens“in here” and “out there.” Behind the shifting appearance of the Many—the wildlydiverse activity in nature—stands the One. The One is higher reality. We see,because It sees. We are moved by beauty, because It contains infinite beauty.When we feel that we know something to be true, our minds have touched, justbarely and for an instant, the endless scope of absolute Truth.Tagore’s story ends in a protracted, painful illness before he died in Calcutta,at rest from his world travels. Looking around, it’s hard to find a conversationtoday that discusses reality and God with the same delicacy and respect thatEinstein showed Tagore. The argument for his kind of idealism, where to live inthe world is to love it, was defeated by a second world war and the loomingatomic age. The victory of science is rampant; gurus stand in line behindtechies. But the doubts expressed by Einstein haven’t been resolved. The presentpoint in God’s evolution is ambiguous. Every negative trend from the past—asuspicious clergy, rigid dogma, the fight against tolerance—survives alongsidepositive trends that are just as ancient—a loving Creator, humans made in theimage of the divine, direct contact with God’s presence.The horror of a godless world haunts millions of people. Technology races ahead,threatening to overwhelm us. Beyond the personal computer lies the promise of aquantum computer. Information doubles every two years. Smart phones rule. ButGod isn’t susceptible to obsolescence. The divine speaks silently amid the dinof shouting voices, and the miracle is that someone, somewhere, is still willingto listen."},{"pageContent":" Epilogue [toc01.xhtml#epi01]“Are You There?” [toc01.xhtml#epi01]Reading the stories of saints, sages, and visionaries creates a strangesensation, a mixture of inspiration and doubt. We are like a culture that oncehad telephones until they stopped working. We try to talk to God, only to heardead silence on the line. “Are you there? Hello, hello. Is anyone there?” is theonly thing left to say. With the connection gone, it’s impossible to know if Godis listening. Perhaps he or she is also asking, “Are you there?” from the otherend of the line.Before a connection to God can be restored, a vital question needs to be asked.Did people ever talk to God in the first place? The answer, if we are beinglogical, must be either yes or no. “Maybe” is a copout. No one would keep atelephone around that didn’t work, not for the many centuries that human beingsfelt that God or the gods were listening. Someone felt a divine presence andheard it deliver messages from a higher reality. I’ve offered ten such people,and they are connected by a thread that runs through the history ofspirituality. It’s not faith that joins them, but consciousness.Now that the age of faith is well and truly over, modern people make areasonable demand. If God exists, we should be able to verify him. Holy wordsdon’t suffice. The authority of saints guarantees nothing in a fact-based world.To give the divine a free pass by claiming that God is above petty doubtsdoesn’t reassure anyone who harbors those doubts.God is reached through an inner journey, and the whole problem of proof could besettled if this journey could be verified. God once walked in the Garden of Edenin the cool of the evening, but no more. Ever since, the deity has leftinvisible footprints—until now, perhaps. Brain research has gotten sophisticatedenough to peer into the working of minute areas of the brain, and neurosciencemakes maps of regions that used to be terra incognita. Such maps can tell youwhich areas of the cortex light up when a person feels compassion, possessesstrong faith, has a holy vision, hears voices, or prays.“You are the light of the world,” which Jesus said to his disciples, suddenlyhas a literal meaning. In fact, the areas of the frontal lobes associated withhigher functions like compassion grow larger and stronger among Tibetan Buddhistmonks who meditate on compassion. Certain brain frequencies in the delta bandincrease at the same time beyond anything seen before. God’s footprints were notinvisible after all; they were just hidden beneath the cranial bones in the softgray tissue of our brains.Making Our Own ConnectionWhere does this leave you and me as hopeful seekers? By showing that spiritualpractice changes the brain, reality expands. The only reality anyone can knowmust register in the brain. Now atheists and other skeptics cannot reasonablyclaim that nothing is happening during spiritual experiences. The door is openfor anyone who is eager for God. Or to be precise, four doors have opened.Looking back at the visionaries in this book, they followed four paths to reachhigher reality.The path of devotion has always been open to those who love God. As their loveintensifies, they feel God’s presence drawing near. That was easier in the ageof faith. Daily life involved much prayer, and the local church was at thecenter of birth, death, marriage, feast days, Communion, and many holy days onthe Christian calendar. As an inner journey, the devotional path is harder totake today. It involves an immersion in wonder before God and all divine works.Nature is regarded as a canvas that conceals the hand of God. The greatadvantage of the devotional path is its joy. The seeker worships in order tocontact bliss. But as Rumi, the perfect devotee, shows, this love affair withthe divine is as tumultuous as any human love affair, and just as prone toheartache. It is up to you to know at the level of feeling if God has touchedyour heart.The path of understanding is the way open to the mind. It involves reflection onthe great questions of life: Who am I? Why was I created? What does my existencemean? If only abstract answers come back, there is only dry mentalinvestigation. But the mind can become passionate about God, and then it cannotrest without seeing through every illusion that blocks the way. All four pathsare lifetime journeys, but the way of understanding may be the narrowest. Youmust have a strong intellect and unflagging curiosity. Thinking brings its ownjoys, but no one would say that this way is blissful. Taking Socrates as amodel, one sees that society doesn’t approve of gadflies and questioners ofreceived wisdom. Yet there are people who cannot stop thinking about God, andknowing the truth about higher reality satisfies them more than devotional blisscan.The path of service is the way of action, finding ways to do good in the name ofGod. Charity is one way to serve. Giving your time selflessly is another. Butmore than good works are called for. The deeper question is finding out whichactions will draw you closer to God. Religions often fall back on the notionthat God wants us to do certain things, such as obey his laws, to earn usapproval from on high. I think that’s mostly church politics, a way to keepworshippers in line. Being infinite, God wants nothing; therefore, he wantsnothing from us either. Our limited self-love is nothing compared with infinitelove. The secret on the path of service is to lose the ego, which serves only“I, me, and mine.” To reach God, your service must be to life itself, whichmeans serving all beings. Taking the Baal Shem Tov as our model, we see a humbleexistence that needs no reward, but derives inspiration from giving.The path of meditation is the way of consciousness. Devotion begins with afeeling of joy. Understanding begins with a flash of insight. Service beginswith an act of humility. But when you begin on the path of meditation, there isonly being. In order to be, we need only one thing: consciousness. You are awarethat you exist. Such a path would seem to be meager, if not threadbare. Beingdoesn’t bring images of fun to mind. It brings nothing to mind so much as ablank. Which turns out to be the secret, because in that seeming blankness liesthe beginning of everything. Consciousness is the womb of creation. Everythingyou will ever think, say, or do begins here. On the path of meditation, you openyour mind to higher consciousness as your very essence. Taking Julian of Norwichas our model, we realize that this path is solitary, because meditation needssilence and self-communion. Its great advantage is that isolation doesn’t haveto be physical. You can meditate in the midst of an everyday life. Time is noobstacle when your goal is the timeless.These four paths were set down in ancient India thousands of years ago. Theyhave served—and been validated—for countless generations. I would also claimthat they are universal ways to reach higher reality, not just Eastern ways.With the collapse of faith as a common inheritance, each of us must undertakethe inner journey of our own choosing, but that was always true. Saints andsages once had more prestige than they do today. The voices they heard were notsuspiciously labeled schizophrenic hallucinations, grand-mal seizures, orsymptoms of a brain tumor. Those explanations arose in modern times in the wakeof two world wars and the advent of the atomic bomb, which effectively corrodedfaith for millions—the medical rationale arrived as an afterthought, to justifywell-entrenched doubts about a merciful, all-loving God. Yet the medical“evidence” rings hollow, because when we read the book of Job, Plato, St. Paul,or Rumi, their words mean something. They stir us deeply enough that we feelreconnected, however briefly and vaguely.Living ProofTo satisfy science, what we need already exists: the feedback loop. Your bodyoperates through countless chemical messages sent to trillions of cells; thesemessages create a response that the cells send back to the brain, and dependingon what the response is, the next round of messages will change. The brainlistens to feedback, and its connection to the rest of the body forms a loop.Now substitute God for the brain and human beings for the body’s cells. Thefeedback loop remains the same: message and response. If you feel any impulse ofjoy, hope, beauty, or faith, its source cannot be outside your own awareness.Divine messages occur within the field of consciousness. If God were outsidehuman awareness, he wouldn’t exist, not for us anyway. The scope of reality isinfinite and eternal; this has always been part of God’s mystery as well. Butthe infinite and eternal became enclosed in time and space with the big bang,and the same happened to the mind. If the mind of God became limited enough toenter the minds of ordinary people—which is what Job, Plato, St. Paul, and Rumiare all about—that isn’t a miracle. Nothing in the infinite fields of matter,energy, and information that create the visible universe can be known until theyare reduced to the human scale.Einstein respected the cosmic mystery enough to say that what astonished himmost wasn’t the universe, but the fact that we can know it at all. With the sameattitude, some farsighted scientists today have begun to recognize thatconsciousness is a proper field of study and research (largely thanks tobreakthroughs in brain scans like the functional MRI). Some even go so far asseeing spirituality as inherently human—our brains, our genes, and therefore ourthoughts are set up to seek God. This is a startling claim against thebackground of science as the great opponent of religion. We don’t have to lookupon it as a claim at all, just a hypothesis.Let’s call it the “soul hypothesis” for short. It can be stated without usingany reference to God, as follows. We are conscious beings who want to know whereour awareness came from. Only consciousness can understand consciousness; hencethe long tradition of the inner journey. The saints and sages of the past wereEinsteins of consciousness, explorers into the nature of reality. They weretesting the soul hypothesis, and if these explorers came back with the samefindings, century after century, culture after culture, why not give theirfindings credence?Their findings are startlingly similar, in fact. The mind, they said, is like ariver. On the surface there is constant motion and turbulence; reality can bedescribed as constant change as the river flows through time and space. Justbelow the surface, however, the river grows slower and calmer. There are nowaves, and as you dive deeper, the turbulence on the surface ceases to register.Stillness prevails, and at the very bottom of the river, if it is deep enough,the water doesn’t move at all, or just imperceptibly.Our connection to God, then, is like that between a wave and the still depths. Ariver is all one thing, flowing water, yet reality on the surface appears verydifferent from reality down below. The great discovery of our Einsteins ofconsciousness was the revelation that all consciousness is the same. There canbe no separation from God if this is so. God cannot die or abandon or standaloof like a watchmaker unconcerned after he set the cosmic mechanism in motion.We are essentially divine, because God is just another name for the origin andsource of consciousness.We are back to the feedback loop now. If God’s mind is an infinite version ofour mind, all our thoughts are movements within the divine mind. Whether youcall yourself a believer or an atheist is irrelevant. Consciousness never stopssending messages to itself, waiting for a response, and then adjusting the nextround of messages. We possess a soul insofar as we realize that we are part ofthe feedback loop. The only difference is where you put your attention. Somepeople are content to remain on the turbulent surface of the river. They arefascinated by the constant activity, the ups and downs; life is a river-raftingtrip. But nothing prevents a few people from focusing their attention on anotherlevel of consciousness, where calm, peace, wisdom, silence, and the vastness ofthe cosmic mystery reside.My mind returns these days to Rabindranath Tagore. I chose him as a modernexplorer in consciousness, and there is poignancy in his restless wandering. Hewas born four years before Lincoln was assassinated and died four years beforethe first atomic weapon was exploded at the Trinity Site. As much as anyone inhistory, Tagore felt the desperate need for humanity to hear a message ofeternal love. Instead of bodhi trees and burning bushes, God’s vehicle was thepress conference dockside when Tagore’s ship landed. Amid the barbaric terrorsof the twentieth century, how strange those reporters must have felt scribblingnotes about what he said.“Let your life lightly dance on the edges of time like dew on the tip of aleaf.”“Love does not claim possession, but gives freedom.”“Music fills the infinite between two souls.”What? Tell it to North Korea and Iran. Tell it to mass murderers in the Congo,or the six million who perished in the Holocaust. Fear and horror do very wellif you want to break every possible connection to God. When a person gets sick,trillions of cells receive distorted, toxic messages, and if the cells perish,they might doubt that the brain exists or has their best interests in mind. Thebreakdown of a feedback loop leads to isolation. If you ask “Is anyone there?”and get no reply, it’s only natural to feel helpless and hopeless. The answer,now and always, is to test the soul hypothesis for yourself.There are more enticing clues than ever. Brain research has provided the tracesof consciousness as heightened activity in the cortex. Quantum physics long agodismantled the reassuring world of solid objects and neatly connected cause andeffect. There are abundant reasons for believing that the inner journey isn’tfoolhardy or a mass delusion imposed by organized religion.It may be necessary to look nervously over our shoulders to see if science isnodding its approval. Ultimately, however, the poets and visionaries, theoutsiders and mystics who constitute the motley crew of our spiritual past knewbetter. Being conscious, we are never away from the divine, even for a second,even during the darkest night of the soul. Somewhere inside, we all yearn toreconnect, and if we sit quietly, during those moments when life’s richness istoo overwhelmingly beautiful to ignore, we know that Tagore was profoundlyright:Love is the only reality, and it is not a mere sentiment. It is the ultimatetruth that lies at the heart of creation.Ah, we realize, someone is on the line after all."},{"pageContent":" About the Author [toc01.xhtml#ata01] DEEPAK CHOPRA is the founder of The Chopra Center for Wellbeing in Carlsbad,California, and is acknowledged as one of the master teachers of Easternphilosophy in the Western world.
