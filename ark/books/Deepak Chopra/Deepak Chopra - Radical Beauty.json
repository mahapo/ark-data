In each soul is the unique imprintof the grace of God. Nowhere in the world is there another exactly like you. Ofthat you can justly be proud!—Paramahansa YoganandaHere’s a scene being repeated thousands of times a day somewhere in America. Youmay even see yourself in the scene. Two women have stopped by the cosmeticscounter of a large department store. They’ve been lured by a salesperson holdingout the latest wonder foundation or skin cream. Or the two women caught aglimpse of themselves in the makeup mirror sitting on the counter.One woman is twenty-three, in the prime of her youthful looks. But she frownswhen she catches a glimpse of herself in the mirror. Her hair doesn’t look quiteright to her; maybe it’s the fault of the new hairstylist she tried. Her skinlooks dull, and ever since she started reading weekly tabloids, she’s beencritical of her thin lashes and a neck that isn’t glamorously long and thin.With a sigh the young woman sits down and asks to try the new product. Anyway,the beauty game is still fun for her, and it takes only a few minutes beforeshe’s eagerly trying several other trendy products.The other woman has perched on a stool close by. She’s a few years over fortyand, looking out of the corner of her eye, she’s envious of the young woman. Sofresh, so untouched by age. Catching sight of herself in the mirror, this olderwoman catches every flaw, every wrinkle that’s beginning to show, either real orimagined. For her, it’s work to keep herself looking acceptable, forgetbeautiful. She needs all kinds of products just to stop feeling insecure.This is a scene we want to abolish from your life and from the life of anywoman, of any age, who devotes time, energy, and emotion in search of beauty. Wewant you never again to feel insecure about your looks. For most women, feelingbeautiful is connected to feeling lovable and desirable. We want you to stopbeing insecure about those two things, too. Beauty, love, and desirability areyours to possess naturally—this we promise. There’s a great journey awaiting youthat will restore you to your natural beauty, rekindling the inner light thatshines from every child but somehow got dimmed over the years. What has fadedisn’t your beauty, because that will always be your birthright. What has fadedis your optimism, confidence, and sense of control. This book will show you howto restore them, and then the light of beauty will rekindle itself, naturallyand for the rest of your life.WHAT IS BEAUTY?The journey to Radical Beauty begins with the most basic question: what isbeauty? We feel that a new definition is sorely needed, and society is ready forone. Beauty is no stranger. In many ways we’re obsessed by it.As you move through your daily life, you inevitably encounter the word beauty.If you glance up while shopping at your local pharmacy, you’ll find numerousaisles stocked with products claiming to make you more beautiful. There arecountless magazines and websites dedicated to beauty, teaching us different waysto lose weight, choose the perfect lipstick, create smoky celebrity eyes, andcopy the latest hairstyle trends. If you stop and look around at our culture,the concept of beauty seems very important. But what exactly is beauty, and whenyou think of the word, what does it mean to you?The mainstream media provides an onslaught of images and messages about beautythat are meant to sell products. If you believe these messages, you might beinclined to think that beauty is defined by the external—having “perfectly”formed facial features, an on-trend hairstyle, and a physical shape that matchesup with the current idealized expression of beauty (such as being pencil thinbut having a perfectly rounded bottom). If you don’t naturally possess these“beautiful” qualities, you’ve been led to believe that the primary way tobolster your own beauty is to fill your drawers with makeup and skin-careproducts while preening your hair with highlights, blowouts, and chemicalstraightening treatments. It may also seem mandatory to spend a sizable portionof your waking hours at the gym, experimenting with the newest workout class tosculpt the perfect figure. We’ve been taught to believe that when it comes toproducts, treatments, and workouts, more equals better results and thereforemore beauty.Unfortunately, this definition of beauty is all about image. There’s nothing newabout defining beauty externally. It’s the equivalent of empty calories: theyseem appealing at first, and then you end up with an unsatisfied feeling. Thespecifics of what is considered beautiful may shift as one fad fades in favor ofanother, but one thing remains constant: our fascination with beauty. Peoplehave appreciated beauty and grasped for it for centuries, beginning with theearliest human civilizations. Ancient Egyptians and Babylonians used primitiveforms of kohl eyeliners to dramatize their eyes. In ancient Greece women appliedrouge made from crushed mulberries to brighten their cheeks. Images ofporcelain-skinned, sleek-haired women have been discovered painted ontocenturies-old Asian rice-paper scrolls.While the shape and size of idealized features vary between cultures, there tendto be a few commonly held beliefs about beauty. First, there is the idea thatbeauty is a limited and fleeting commodity, as if being beautiful is reservedonly for the young and a small, genetically gifted portion of the population.Another widely held conviction in many cultures is that beauty is a relativephenomenon, meaning that it is measured by comparison against others. Onewoman’s hair or eyes are beautiful only if they are more beautiful than anotherwoman’s. This idea perpetuates the unfortunate and unnecessary rivalry that isstill far too common among women.A NEW APPROACH: RADICAL BEAUTYIn the twenty-first century we all need a new concept of what real beauty is.For both authors, it’s something we like to call Radical Beauty. What does thatmean? Radical Beauty has nothing to do with trendy makeup, fleeting fads, orinsecure comparisons with other women. Radical Beauty extends beyond thephysical, encompassing all parts of your inner and outer being. It is somethingthat exists universally, and, at the same time, it is completely unique to you.It nurtures and highlights your magnetism and confidence, vitality, and overallhealth, from your bodily tissues to the outer, visible parts of yourself. Youachieve Radical Beauty when you reach the highest and most authentic potentialof your natural true beauty. This means that Radical Beauty is a birthright foreach and every one of us.Certain makeup and hair and skin products are fantastic for temporarily definingyour eyes or smoothing out your skin, but there is so much more you can do toaugment your inherent natural beauty. That is what Radical Beauty is all about.Instead of being shallow or limited to external body parts, Radical Beauty goesdeep below the surface.For some women, it will be a brand-new concept to think of beauty as more thanthe shape of their face, the size of their body, and the color of their hair andskin, but look around in nature. What do you see? Beauty and harmony areuniversal forces that manifest everywhere. A graceful willow tree and a mightyoak are both beautiful in their own way. Nature is infinitely generous with thevariety of beauty that exists, and this holds true for human beings, too. In thenatural scheme, every creature has its own pure and unique beauty. Hold a singlerose petal in your hand and you will realize that beauty isn’t relegated tospectacular waterfalls and dramatic sunsets. You can discover a marvelousharmony in the most common things: cutting open a grapefruit, looking at themottled pattern on a rock, or examining the interconnected, vein-like innerstructure of a houseplant’s leaves. Beauty truly exists in every singleexpression of nature once we allow ourselves to see it.You are part of nature, so you have the right to claim your natural beauty’shighest potential—your Radical Beauty.You were born to claim your share of universal beauty. Unlocking your highestpotential of beauty, including your greatest possible levels of energy,vitality, and health, will help put you at one with the universe. The verynature of the universe is to express profound beauty. The ocean waves ebb andflow effortlessly. The rain simply falls, and the shells along the beach justlie in the sand, embodying their lovely colors and shapes. As your RadicalBeauty unfolds, you, too, will become an increasingly more authentic expressionof your own beauty.Your uniqueness makes it totally unnecessary to compare yourself with anyoneelse. For too many people, beauty involves feeling inferior by comparison. Thisalways creates a gap, a duality between what is now and what is the ideal. Whenit comes to Radical Beauty, there is absolutely no space for comparison orcompetition. Each of us is here to express our highest beauty, which no oneelse’s beauty can diminish. But you can add to another person’s beauty—yourmother’s, your daughter’s, your friend’s—by making this an aspect of your ownbeauty. You are free to fully celebrate others’ beauty while feeling confidentin your own. What a change that would be!“You are the mirror of divine beauty. Nothing is more beautiful thannaturalness. Not trying to be something you are not, but being the mostauthentic, uncovered expression of yourself. We all look to images of actors andmodels who are supposed to be the ideal in society. In reality, many of thesepeople are likely to be extremely insecure about their desirability, since theirvalue is subject to the constant fluctuations of a public that they have notmet, that is a moving target. Aspiring to be exactly like these images of thosein the media is aspiring to be something you are not. When you are trying to besomething other than yourself, you cannot be beautiful, which by nature is thetruest aspect of you and you alone.”—The Path to Love, by Deepak ChopraTHE SIX PILLARS OF RADICAL BEAUTYWe’ve begun with an inspiring vision. Next come the practicalities, the how-tothat makes any vision come to life. You can achieve Radical Beauty by followingthe six Radical Beauty Pillars, which make up the firm foundation of powerfullifestyle teachings that support your highest expression of beauty. A series ofpractical guidelines, rhythms, and routines not only will benefit you but alsowill promote beauty and health for the whole planet.In Ayurveda, the traditional medical system of India, there’s a saying about howeverything in nature works together in harmony: “As is the macrocosm, so is themicrocosm. As is the great, so is the small.” A healthy body is meant to be partof a healthy planet. What’s truly good for one is naturally good for the other.Our pillars restore this natural harmony. Just as pollution, chemical tampering,and toxic dumping disrupt harmonies in nature, your beauty becomes diminishedfrom congestion and toxicity buildup in your digestive system when you eat thewrong foods, use toxic beauty products, and inhabit improper sleep and lifestyleroutines.As you read through each of the six pillars, start applying the specific toolsand lifestyle changes that make the most sense to you. You can dip your toe inslowly or dive in as completely as you want. Whatever pace you choose will bethe right one, because it is your own. More and more, you will be able to unlockyour highest beauty potential to serve you wherever you are. Here is a quickoverview of the Radical Beauty Pillars and the benefits you can expect toreceive from each one.PILLAR 1: INTERNAL NOURISHMENTBeauty has to emerge from the inside out, so your dietary choices and digestionare a primary influence. The way that you eat is a critical factor indetermining the vitality of your beauty. Everything you put into your body isused to create the foundation upon which your body, hair, and skin are built.In this pillar you’ll learn dietary shifts that will optimize your digestion,create nutritional balance, and bolster your nutrient absorption. This willresult in a clearer, smoother, and more radiant complexion, a flattermidsection, more natural muscle tone throughout your body, higher sustainedenergy, and—over time—healthier and more lustrous hair.PILLAR 2: EXTERNAL NOURISHMENTThis pillar will identify the most effective ingredients to apply directly toyour skin, as well as the most beneficial Radical Beauty skin-care routines.These will ensure that you nourish your skin in the best way possible, whileavoiding toxins that can tax your skin and migrate to your inner body, pollutingyour bloodstream and liver and contributing to toxic congestion.When done properly, simple daily routines, such as abhyanga oil massage (whichyou will find out how to do in Pillar 2[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_c07_r1.xhtml#h4]), can soothe your nervous system andcreate powerfully rejuvenating effects, including a reduction in the pent-upstress that contributes to wrinkles. Such routines can help your organs actuallygrow younger and help restore the vitality and glow to your skin. The powerfulshifts in this pillar also promote detoxification by manually supporting yourlymphatic system from the outside in.PILLAR 3: PEAK BEAUTY SLEEPYour sleep rhythms are an essential component of Radical Beauty, and this pillarwill outline numerous tips and tools to enhance this important part of yourlife.Proper sleep enables your blood to flow more efficiently to your skin, which isimportant for supporting your skin to heal itself daily.

Reduced stress can help improve eating habitsand digestion, which in turn can lead to even clearer skin with fewer breakouts.You will also learn optimal sleep methods to enhance your body’s creation ofgrowth hormone, which boosts your collagen production and is critical forkeeping your skin firm and resilient.PILLAR 4: PRIMAL BEAUTYThis pillar focuses on how to live closer and more in tune with nature, which isa powerful way to bring out your natural beauty. You will learn how to alignyour energy with the larger natural rhythms of nature by shifting your dailypatterns in accordance with the solar and lunar cycles and the seasons. Thisalignment with the macrocosm will help you harness the force to support youroverall energy and vitality.You will also learn how to reduce the toxic chemicals, electromagneticradiation, and pollution in your personal space, which will reduce theirnegative impacts on your hormones and biorhythms. This pillar also teaches thebenefits of simple practices like “earthing,” or physically touching the earth’ssurface, which have been shown to help balance your body with negative ions andhelp neutralize aging free radicals.PILLAR 5: BEAUTIFUL MOVEMENTThis pillar will delve into the best ways to move your body to promote naturalgrace, tone, and beauty, as well as which forms of movement are aging and shouldbe avoided.

Chronic anger, worry, and fear are as acidic and inflammatoryto your body as refined junk food. To avoid toxicity from negative emotions, thepractice of meditation is perhaps the most powerful step you can take. When youmeditate, you reach the prime source of beauty. We can call it spirit, the soul,or the true self; the exact word isn’t important.What’s important is to have the inner experience of being connected to yoursource, and then integrating meditation into your life. Spiritual beauty bringsanother dimension to who you are and what your purpose is. Nothing is morebeautiful than being able to live as a whole person, someone who shines with aninner light.

The experience of feelingand seeing results will inspire you to keep going. And the further along youjourney to discover your own natural beauty, the more you will convey your ownexpression of Radical Beauty, which is reflected uniquely by you.With great love.Deepak and Kimberly"},{"pageContent":"PILLAR 1:INTERNAL NOURISHMENTKnowledge is power, and in this pillar you’ll gain the power to choose the bestfoods to fuel your Radical Beauty. As you learn an entirely new way of lookingat food, the choices you begin to make will result in radiant skin, high energy,and healthy hair. The Radical Beauty approach stops looking at food in terms ofvigilantly watched calories or thinking about eating as an anxious, tightlycontrolled activity. Beauty and enjoyment are connected, and the greatestenjoyment comes from fulfillment, which begins within. The Radical Beautyapproach is something we call Internal Nourishment, a program of strategies toincorporate into your daily dietary rhythm, along with natural, powerful beautysecrets based on enhancing your natural beauty.You won’t achieve Radical Beauty with one particular measurement like tallyingup daily grams of carbs and fats. There is not one set of definitive guidelinesthat work for everyone. Instead of dictating that we all must eat an exactpercentage of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, the latest wisdom is that eachbody processes these basic food components individually. Your unique responsedetermines the benefits and drawbacks of consuming certain foods. Individualbalance is the key, looking at your total diet and how each part works together.This is known as synergy, a dynamic process that takes place in every cell.We want everyone to wean themselves off fad diets and nutritional trends thatare overly simplistic. So many of them falsely demonize one ingredient or even asingle macronutrient, whether it is sugar, salt, fat, carbs, or some otherculprit. On the other side of the coin are the false promises made on behalf ofa “miracle” food that supposedly makes you thin and beautiful, healthy andtotally immune to disease and aging. Demonized foods and miracle foods are bothfantasies—not to mention that they constantly keep changing.In contrast, we are going to dive much deeper into creating long-term shifts inyour personal attitudes, coupled with practical tips to support your highestlevel of authentic, natural beauty. Nourishing yourself with food should be asource of joy, not a source of anxiety.Shifts, even seemingly slight ones, can powerfully help to raise yourconsciousness and expand the reality of what’s possible. If the Titanic had onlyshifted its course by a few degrees, a great disaster would have been avoided. Afew degrees turn into a huge change over the course of a hundred or thousandmiles.In your life, a small shift can bring huge benefits over the course of monthsand years, so the time to start is now. Why deprive yourself of Radical Beautywhen your entire well-being can improve so easily? As you start to take babysteps, you will feel empowered to go forward as it feels right for you, so itwon’t feel jarring or like a big struggle. You can do it! You can create thelife and beauty you want, starting with smaller shifts and building upnaturally."},{"pageContent":"SHIFT 1:LET GO OF YOUR PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS ABOUT FOODTHE FOUR COMMON REASONS WE CHOOSE FOODSIf you’re like most people, you choose what to eat for one of four primaryreasons, or a combination of them. Everyone has their own individual prioritiesbased on their background, how they perceive foods, and their personal goals.REASON #1: TASTEThe number one reason we eat the way we do is because of how food tastes. Thisone is obvious. After years of dietary habits, we are all naturally wired toreach for whatever we find tasty. The alarming trend toward obesity in Americais blamed on consuming too much fat, sugar, and too many overall calories. Onecould just as easily blame our addiction on the taste of salt and sugar, whichpermeate fast food and junk food. Advertising has programmed us to salivate atthe mere thought of more and more saltiness, sugariness, and other tastes thatzing the tongue, like the spicy, sour tang found in everything from buffalowings to the “special sauce” on a Big Mac. Of course, personal tastes varyaccording to factors such as how we were raised. Many of us continue to choosethe same foods we ate as children because we find their tastes familiar andcomforting.Unfortunately, many of the most obvious “bad for you” foods, such as thehamburgers and milk shakes peddled by chain restaurants, taste delicious to alarge percentage of Americans, who persist in leading with a few strong,habit-forming tastes in their default food choices. For them, taste rulesdespite ever-mounting evidence against eating salty, sugary, fatty foods inlarge amounts. The fact that you are reading this book right now says thatyou’re interested in looking deeper into the nourishment food can provide.It may be hard right now to imagine your life without eating your favorite treatevery day, but rest assured that you won’t feel this way forever. First of all,you don’t have to be “perfect” all the time. Don’t be afraid that you can’t everhave your treats again. Also remember that your tastes can (and will) changeover time. You may gravitate toward processed, sugary foods now, but aftermaking several small dietary shifts, biochemistry changes will cause you tocrave different foods. Your body will be able to more thoroughly cleanse itself,and you’ll experience more vitality that will make you look more alive andenergetic. These shifts will cause the intense cravings you may have had in thepast to diminish naturally.REASON #2: WEIGHTThe second thing most people think about when choosing what to eat is how itwill impact their weight. After a quick mental rundown based on the nutritionalphilosophy you currently subscribe to, you may reduce any and all foods down toone overarching characteristic: “fattening” or “not fattening.” Depending on howdiet focused you have been over the years, you might also do a quick scan of thenutritional information on the food’s label, assessing the number of calories,grams of carbs, amounts of sugar and protein, and so on. Some of us performthese mental calculations continuously, day in and day out. It’s exhausting.The idea that the key to weight loss lies in a simple formula—“calories in minuscalories out”—is so pervasive that it is considered a fact in the mainstreambelief system. The truth is that this formula is far too one-dimensional. Ourbodies digest different foods in different ways, and everything we eat affectsour cellular structure. The Radical Beauty shifts will allow you to effectivelylose or maintain weight with a much simpler formula that will make caloriecounting obsolete.CHEMICALS IN PROCESSED FOOD CAN MAKE YOU FATNew research is highlighting the fact that tracking calories or other numbersisn’t the best way to control your weight. A study from the journal Nature foundthat chemicals added to processed and junk foods can alter gut bacteria, whichcan cause intestinal inflammation. This may in turn lead to various bowel issuesand weight gain.1 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c01-nts1] Instead ofbecoming a label-reading junkie, use nature as your truest beauty food guide.The closer a food is to its natural state the better, and the more processed afood is, the more you should avoid it.REASON #3: HEALTHINESSThe third major reason people eat what they do is how “healthful” they considera food to be. Here the choices are not necessarily related to weight loss butare based on the belief that a certain food will promote good health. A goodexample of this is when someone chooses to drink a glass of milk because he orshe thinks it’s a great source of calcium. (This is actually not a good idea foreveryone, by the way, but more on that later.) Your health is certainly a majorreason to choose a particular food over another, but unfortunately there is alot of confusion and misinformation circulating about what’s truly healthful andwhat isn’t. We will clarify this confusion throughout this pillar.But the bottom line is that natural, organically raised food is healthful. Overmillions of years, the human digestive system has been interacting with theenvironment. Our hunter-gatherer ancestors left us an incredible legacy—theability to digest and gain nourishment from the widest possible range of foods.We are the planet’s most successful omnivores. The key to this ability istwofold: our genes and the thousands of kinds of bacteria that reside in ourdigestive tract. No other creature, so far as science knows, has diversified itsdiet the way Homo sapiens has.The upside is that you are equipped to choose almost any dietary plan, with abalance of food groups and nutrients, that suits your climate, body type, andpersonal preferences. The downside is that there is wide latitude for abusingthe body. Pandas cannot survive if their single food source, bamboo leaves,isn’t available, and koalas can’t survive without eucalyptus leaves. Humans, onthe other hand, can adapt to unhealthy diets and survive for decades on them—butnot without a cost. Healthful eating comes down to using our ancestral gift aswisely as possible while avoiding the abuses we’re tempted into by the forcesbehind junk food, fast food, and all the processing and artificial ingredientsthat go into so much packaged food on grocery shelves.REASON #4: CONVENIENCEThe fourth reason we choose what to eat is convenience. Life is busy, and foodseems like an easy place to cut corners and save time. Whether it’s fast food,takeout, grabbing something premade from the local deli or the prepared sectionat the grocery store, or stocking the freezer with a variety of microwavablemeals like family-sized pizzas and burritos, convenience looms as a very bigreason that many people and families choose what to eat.Even though awareness of natural, organically raised food is growing—forinstance, the largest retailer of organic food in America is Walmart—forcountless Americans convenience is paramount. Around one out of every ten mealsin this country is eaten at a single fast-food chain: McDonald’s. We can’texpect to turn back the clock. Unlike a traditional village in India, Tuscany,or South America, our lifestyle doesn’t include extended families in whichtypically a woman, either the wife, mother, or grandmother, is expected to makea daily round of the baker, vegetable monger, fruit seller, and possiblybutcher, bringing home the ingredients and cooking every meal of the day. Socialroles have changed too much for this way of life to be more than a romanticfantasy (or a daily grind, if you are the designated cook for everyone). Thereal question is how to balance convenience with freshly cooked meals in such away that everyone is satisfied, no one is overly stressed, and the resultingmeals are truly nourishing and delicious.A NEW REASON TO CHOOSE FOODSo much for the reasons that shape our eating right now. There needs to be abetter way. With this book, we hope you will consider an entirely new reason tochoose certain foods, and that is to build your dynamic, authentic beauty. Thefoods you choose to eat have a profound effect not only on your level of healthbut also on your tissue quality and therefore your outer expression of beauty.Achieving Radical Beauty also means you will achieve superior health.Waking up to this awareness is, in itself, liberating and very empowering. Youhave a choice. Each day with every meal you eat, you can choose to apply thisknowledge and eat in a specific way that enhances and supports your naturalbeauty. What’s on your fork, the foods you reach for at the grocery store, andeven the way you prepare and eat those foods are all vehicles for great change.You can employ any and all of these strategies to claim your Radical Beauty.There is so much confusion about the connection between food and beauty. Despiteall of the information circulating out there (including Kimberly’s Beauty Detoxbooks), many people struggle to apply these concepts. They use artificialsweeteners to quell cravings and try to avoid white sugar despite the fact thatartificial sweeteners are even more detrimental to their beauty. People arescared to eat bananas because of their natural carbs and sugar, yet they nosh onpackaged bars filled with fragmented, processed ingredients such as soy or wheyprotein isolates, fractionated palm kernel oil, and invert evaporated canesyrup.You are not what you eat but what you assimilate and digest.Perhaps you, too, are confused. We don’t blame you! When bombarded by snippetsof information from casual conversations, a fitness app on your phone, or thelatest diet circulated in the media that guarantees fast results, many peoplereact by growing afraid of real food. They choose “safer” items that have theirnutritional information neatly printed out on the label. Over time, they ignoretheir constant bloat, the din of a rumbling belly, or the increasing rate ofacid reflux, and are too embarrassed to bring up the fact that they don’t go tothe bathroom every day. Then they wonder why they have deepening bags undertheir eyes, breakouts and patchiness, and increasingly brittle and lacklusterhair.Here’s the truth: it’s all connected. What we eat and the whole basis ofintegrating these foods and our bodies—digestion—must be approached properly tosupport our inner glow and our outer beauty. Digestion is truly a key tounleashing your Radical Beauty. Referred to as agni in Ayurveda (the oldestknown medical system, founded in India about 5,000 years ago), digestion is atthe center of our health and our beauty. You are not what you eat, but what youassimilate, or absorb and utilize as nourishment in your body, and digest.Numbers alone will never give you an accurate sense of that picture.CHRONIC DISEASES AND PREMATURE AGING: NOT NATURAL OR NECESSARYNumbers-based dietary assessments have no place in traditional wellness systemssuch as Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine. Both have become popular inthe West over the past few decades, as people have become heavier and more proneto illness and aging because of damaging lifestyle choices, especially in thetypical American diet. Some negative trends, given our aging population, areadvancing upon us faster than ever before. Until around World War II, theleading causes of death were infectious diseases such as tuberculosis,influenza, and pneumonia, which are airborne, along with waterborne diseaseslike cholera.2 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c01-nts2] Degenerativediseases, which involve the deterioration of the structure or function oftissue, such as type 2 diabetes, were actually quite rare. At the turn of thetwentieth century, it was considered highly unusual for a physician in a generalpractice to see a patient complaining of angina, the typical chest pain due toheart disease. With improvements in sanitation and medical care since then,we’ve fortunately seen an immense reduction in infectious diseases.People are still dying from diseases, but today it’s the type of diseases thathas dramatically shifted. In modern America noncommunicable, chronic, ordegenerative disorders are the leading cause of death. Some rates are fallingdramatically, such as deaths from stroke, while others, like most forms ofcancer, budge very slowly. But even more important is the discovery that if welook at the most common lifestyle disorders, such as heart disease, obesity,type 2 diabetes, and various forms of preventable cancers, their outset can betraced back years before the first symptoms appear.It’s been known for a long time that skin cancer, for example, is related to howmuch sun exposure without sunblock occurred early in life, even though thecancer doesn’t appear until adulthood in most cases. Similarly, diet andexercise at an early age make a major difference in someone’s risk ofosteoporosis later in life. Now it seems more than probable that most chronicdisorders follow this pattern, and in some cases, such as autism, schizophrenia,and Alzheimer’s disease, the time for prevention and early treatment mayactually be in the first few years or even months of life.Today, we are becoming more and more aware that lifestyle affects our overallhealth. According to the World Health Organization, in 2012 noncommunicablediseases, namely cardiovascular diseases, cancers, diabetes, and chronic lungdisease, were responsible for 68 percent of all deaths globally.3[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c01-nts3] As Dr. James Pacala from theUniversity of Minnesota states, “Some people can have a family history of heartdiseases, but it’s actually a history of smoking, overeating, and [an inactive]lifestyle. And if you adopt that lifestyle, you’re going to run into the sameproblems your parents did.”4 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c01-nts4]Most degenerative diseases and lifestyle disorders can’t be cast off as“natural.” If that were the case, they would have occurred in similarpercentages throughout history. But they haven’t, because when underlyingfactors change, such as sanitation, clean air and water, and diet, diseasechanges with them. Over the last fifty years in particular, there has been anexplosion of “unnatural” diseases as various populations ignore best adviceabout the basics of well-being: healthy diet, physical activity, and reducedstress. On average we live longer today than we did in the past, but the qualityof life for many is greatly diminished, and damaging lifestyle choices aresustained through a multitude of medications and treatments that have a host ofside effects.Just as chronic diseases aren’t natural, neither is premature, accelerated agingin the many forms it takes, such as dull skin, cloudy eyes, or chronic fatigue.Though these symptoms of aging are pervasive, they aren’t inevitable. Of course,skin may naturally wrinkle or fold over decades, but this does not have tohappen prematurely. There are women in their twenties with chronic dark circlesunder their eyes, crow’s feet, and thinning hair, while some women well intotheir fifties and beyond maintain vital energy, shining eyes, and healthy, moreelastic skin and muscle tone. While genes can play a factor, to a great extentthe rate at which you age can be determined by your lifestyle. Following dietaryfads, eating processed foods, and consuming chemicals, additives, andpreservatives leads to compromised digestion and skin that can repair itselfless and less.Premature aging, including hair and skin issues, can be seen as the weakeningand suppression of your body’s natural healing response. By approaching yourdiet strategically, you have more control over your immunity, natural healingresponse, and therefore beauty. It’s as simple as that. Your food choices canhelp you retain the glow of health and authentic beauty at any stage.Each of the shifts in this pillar represents broader and simpler ways to modifyyour eating habits. Incorporating these shifts is far easier to understand andfollow than obsessing over the minutiae of complicated programs, trying tosource the exact food listed out in a meal plan, or trying to calculate theexact numbers of calories or carbs in any given meal. Embracing theseoverarching shifts in your daily rhythms will help you to achieve the RadicalBeauty that is your birthright."},{"pageContent":"SHIFT 2:REGAIN CONTROL OVER YOUR BODY’S NATURAL PROCESSESThe next shift is about accepting your body’s natural ability to renew itself.Life is renewal, and therefore so is beauty. Although you can’t see it, arenewal process is constantly taking place inside your body. Some cells, such asthe villus cells in your intestinal tract (which help you absorb nutrients) andthe taste buds in your mouth, might be replaced in a few days, while other bodyparts, such as bones, take much longer to renew. Yet even the most solid-lookingparts of your body are exchanging molecules that move in and out of each cell.Some experts believe that the average age of all the cells in an adult’s body isseven to ten years.1 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c02-nts1] Thisdoesn’t mean that you have to wait that long to see results. Rather, everythingin your body is relatively new, even the bones that seem so permanent and fixed.You are actually renewing all the time. This is exciting news, for it means thatyou can start fostering exceptionally healthy new cells today.Your red blood cells, which carry oxygen to your skin and provide a glow, coursethrough almost 1,000 miles of arteries, veins, and capillaries; red bloodcorpuscles have a life span of only about 120 days before being deposited intoyour spleen.2 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c02-nts2] According towhich researchers you consult, the cells that make up your liver—theall-important filter of toxins, pesticides, and drugs—can be turned over in aslittle as 1503 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c02-nts3] to 500 days.4[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c02-nts4]THE STATE OF YOUR SKINFresh, glowing skin is very important to any woman who is beauty conscious, butyour skin is also an extension of your overall health. When you shift yourattitude in this direction, you can use this very visible aspect of your outerappearance as a message from every cell in your body about your well-being.Before we delve into this shift, please do a quick examination on the currentstate of your skin. Go to the closest mirror and check out your face, neck, andhands. What is really going on?SKIN VERSUS HAIR RENEWALThe state of your hair and skin is an extension of your overall health, and manypeople experience major transformations from lifeless and brittle hair tothicker, fuller hair after implementing the lifestyle shifts recommended inRadical Beauty. But you have to be patient, as hair, in particular, doesn’ttransform overnight. The surface layer of your skin, however, is renewedapproximately every four weeks. So you can expect to see clearer and morevibrant skin after about a month of making a conscious shift to living morehealthily and beautifully. It’s also possible to see more of a “glow” to yourskin in as little as a few days, as wastes clear from your system andcirculation and nutrient flow to your skin improves.No doubt about it, it does take longer for your hair to regain its naturalhealth and beauty. Depending on your hair’s length, it can be anywhere fromthree to six years old. On average, it grows about one centimeter, or just underhalf an inch, every month. You can start nourishing healthier hair follicles toproduce healthier hair, but it will take additional time to see more dramaticimprovements since it needs to grow. By making the proper shifts starting today,you can rest assured that beautiful hair is on the way.IS YOUR SKIN DRY?Dry skin can indicate a deep level of dehydration, which needs to be addressedfrom within by hydrating with the right-temperature liquids and foods (more onthis on this page [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_c05_r1.xhtml#page91]) as well aswith proper skin-care products. You also might not be getting enough of theproper kinds and amounts of nourishing beauty fat. Some undernourishment ormalabsorptive digestive issues may also be at play.IS YOUR SKIN OILY?Excessive oil buildup in your complexion might indicate that your liver isoverloaded and needs extra care or that you are not adequately metabolizing andassimilating your foods. Are you constipated? Perhaps you are overeating fats,especially the worst kinds (cooked, fried fats and heated vegetable oils). Youalso may be eating foods that are congestive or allergenic, or that you aren’tdigesting completely.IS YOUR SKIN BREAKING OUT?Breakouts can indicate a toxic buildup in your system. Your elimination organsmay be overwhelmed, which can encourage impurities to push out through yourskin. There may be excessive phlegm buildup from overeating congestive,difficult-to-digest foods (such as dairy), or your digestive system may becompromised.IS YOUR SKIN RED OR RASHY?Inflamed, red, or rashy skin might indicate that you are consistently eatingsomething that is triggering an inflammatory or allergic response.Alternatively, you might be eating foods that are too “hot” for your system. InAyurveda, internal overheating, known as excessive Pitta, is considered a majorcause of aging.If you are experiencing any of these skin conditions, don’t worry! We bringthese up so you have an honest base of assessment as we start to delve intodietary remedies. These skin issues can be balanced, starting with establishingpowerful new nutritional rhythms for your long-term lifestyle. Let’s dive in.BOOST YOUR CIRCULATIONOptimal circulation is extremely important. Consider a huge, majestic appletree. The roots of the tree, buried deep in the soil, have to absorb mineralsand water from the earth and then pull them upward into the trunk and outwardbranches of the tree to nourish each tiny burgeoning twig and, ultimately, thefruit—in this case, the apples. Without proper circulation throughout the tree,the apples would not get the nourishment they need, and they certainly would notbe as juicy, delicious, or beautiful.It’s the same with your body. Circulation ensures that nutrients flowefficiently throughout your entire body, including up into your hair folliclesto nourish every hair on your head. It also allows oxygen to reach all of yourcells so they can turn over and the new cells grow healthily. Tissue healing isan intricate process that is also regulated by circulation.5[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c02-nts5] Fat stored in your fat cellsneeds to be accessible so it can be flushed out to help you maintain your idealweight. This process also removes aging toxins, pollutants, chemicals, andadditives from your body.Think back to the tree analogy. In your case, the “fruits” of your beautyinclude the outer, visible parts. But your body cannot possibly be expected tobuild healthy hair or glowing skin without excellent circulation supplying allits needs and efficiently removing the waste that constantly builds up in yoursystem.QUICK BEAUTY CIRCULATION TESTTake a look down and examine your fingernails. Do you see a white half-moonshape at the base of each fingernail? This can indicate that you have goodcirculation and vitality flowing through your body. If all or part of thehalf-moon is missing, it can mean that your circulation needs a boost. Eitherway, there is much you can do to improve your circulation further and allow yourbeauty to shine through. Check back in the future to see if the half-moon shapeseventually emerge or grow more prominent as you take steps to improve yourbeauty circulation.Excessive toxins, mucus, arterial plaque, and waste buildup can congest yoursystem and reduce your circulation. Capillaries, which are very tiny and narrow,carry nutrients and oxygen-rich blood through their thin walls to surroundingtissues. They also allow for cellular waste to return to the blood so it can beexcreted from the body. If there are buildups or obstructions in yourcirculatory system, beauty-building nutrition and oxygen become blocked, andyour hair, skin, and nails all suffer. A buildup of toxicity in your system alsotaxes your whole body and contributes to accelerated aging. For instance,research shows that heavy metals, one of the many types of toxins we are exposedto from the food and water supply, as well as the environment, contribute toaging.6 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c02-nts6]Your outer beauty isn’t the only element of Radical Beauty that requiresexcellent circulation. Magnetic energy is also captivatingly beautiful anddependent on this process. Have you ever met someone who was so full of passionand life that you couldn’t help but feel drawn to her? A certain light pours outof her eyes and her authentically joyful smile. Her gestures and movements andeven the way she walks all seem fluid and full of liveliness. We’re allattracted to that kind of energy. Energy comes from the combustion of fuel,which requires oxygen. Prana, or your life-force energy, is circulated throughthe blood, or rakta. The better your circulation, the more oxygen is availableto all of your body’s cells, and the more naturally energized you will feel.This will make you all the more positively energetic and, in turn, all the morebeautiful.There are actually two different circulatory systems that work together to keepyour body healthy: the cardiovascular circulatory system and the lymphaticcirculatory system. The lymphatic system is discussed in detail later (see thispage [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_c07_r1.xhtml#page120]); here we focus on usingfoods to boost your cardiovascular circulation. But both systems have to besupported in order to maximize your beauty results.SUPPORTING YOUR CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM FOR MORE BEAUTIFYING OXYGEN AND NUTRIENTFLOWPerhaps you’ve only thought of your cardiovascular system in terms of how itimpacts your heart health, but it also has a big effect on your beauty. Thecardiovascular system pumps nutrients throughout the body to nourish the glowingskin and the strong hair and nails you desire. With each heartbeat, oxygen- andnutrient-rich blood is distributed to every cell. To boost your beauty, you needthis pumping action to efficiently reach all your cells and carry the maximumamount of oxygen and nutrition.FOODS TO INCORPORATE FOR OPTIMAL CIRCULATIONListed below are some of the most effective foods for boosting yourcardiovascular system. Eating these foods is not a quick fix; you can’t munch ona handful of blueberries and expect dramatically thicker hair the next day. Butthese are excellent foods to incorporate in order to see gradual but long-termshifts in your hair, skin, and energy. Going at your own pace, startincorporating them into your regular routine.BLUEBERRIES, STRAWBERRIES, GRAPES, AND CHERRIES: All delicious bounty fromnature, these tasty fruits contain flavonoids that protect your blood vesselsand heart from cell-damaging free radicals.CITRUS FRUITS: Citrus fruits are high in vitamin C, which helps to preventplaque buildup in your arteries, are alkalizing upon metabolism (see this page[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_c03_r1.xhtml#ind13a] for more discussion on this), andhave cleansing properties to help flush out your system. Lemons are forever andalways a top Radical Beauty fruit with many versatile uses. Just squeeze theminto water or use them as a base for salad dressings. Other great citrus fruitsinclude grapefruit, limes, oranges, and pomelos. (Be sure to seek these out whentraveling in Asia and India, where they are natively grown and extra delicious.)BEE POLLEN: Besides being rich in protein, antioxidants, and minerals, beepollen contains a compound called rutin, which is an antioxidant bioflavonoidthat has been found to strengthen capillaries and blood vessels and improvecirculation. It has a faint honey taste, but it’s not sweet per se. The bestplace to source it is from a local beekeeper. (Check out your local farmer’smarket.) Store extra amounts in your freezer. Bee pollen is a great addition tosmoothies, and you can also take just a little spoonful of it plain and chewwell. Note: As with any new food, be sure to start with a tiny amount first tosee how your body reacts. If you have a honey or pollen allergy, bee pollen maynot be suitable for you.AVOCADOS: Avocados supply skin-softening, beautifying, andcirculation-supporting monounsaturated fats, as well as lots of folic acid, Bvitamins, and fiber. All of this will help support healthy blood flow.THE GLOWING GREEN SMOOTHIE (GGS)Drinking the Glowing Green Smoothie in the morning is part of the foundation ofKimberly’s Beauty Detox philosophy. Yes, it’s green…but it is delicious! Itstaste is balanced between greens, lemon, and fruit, and it is packed with fiber,antioxidants, minerals, vitamins, and countless other nutrients to give yousustained high energy. The GGS is also the ultimate health and beauty fuel forglowing skin, immunity, strong hair, bright eyes, and overall vitality. Byblending, you are in essence “predigesting” the foods, and your body does nothave to work to break down the foods and waste unnecessary energy in digestion.The Glowing Green Smoothie uses entire vegetables and fruits, including thejuice and fiber, so you are truly eating whole foods. The fiber doesn’t haveextra calories but is a beauty and detox friend because it naturally controlsappetite, sweeps out wastes, and balances blood sugar levels. If you don’t havetime to make it daily, you can whip up multiple batches and store them in yourfridge for two or three days, or even freeze portion sizes to have later in theweek. The most important thing is that you make the GGS a part of your dailylife!GLOWING GREEN SMOOTHIEYIELD: about 60 ounces (3 to 4 servings)NOTE: Mix and match your greens and fruits for nutritional variety, depending onwhat looks fresh and is seasonal. It’s best to avoid melons, which digest betteron their own. Be sure to always include the lemon. Use organic produce as muchas possible.2 cups cool filtered water7 cups chopped spinach6 cups chopped romaine lettuce1½ cups chopped celery (about 2 stalks)1 pear, cored and chopped1 apple, cored and chopped1 ripe banana, peeled2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice½ cup chopped cilantro (optional)½ cup chopped parsley (optional)Add water, spinach, and chopped romaine to the blender. Start the blender on alow speed and mix until smooth. Next add the celery, pear, apple, banana, andlemon juice, plus the cilantro and parsley, if desired. Blend on high untilsmooth.CHIA SEEDS: These are a great source of omega-3 fatty acids, which helpcontribute to healthy and increased blood circulation. It is very important toconsume chia seeds after they are fully hydrated (soak chia seeds in about a onepart seed, nine parts liquid medium of water, almond milk, or coconut milk, forat least half an hour) in order to get their full beauty benefits. They alsoinclude both soluble and insoluble fiber. Chia pudding is always a great bet,not only because it’s delicious but also because it has a perfect gelatinousform that is as cleansing as it is filling.DARK CHOCOLATE: Dark chocolate contains flavonols that can improve your bloodcirculation. Pick up some organic, raw cacao powder and add it to your afternoonsmoothie. When choosing chocolate bars, go for a high percentage of cacao and alow percentage of sugar. Also be sure to avoid milk chocolate and whitechocolate, which do not contain flavonols. Dark chocolate is a great source ofbeauty minerals, and a moderate amount will help nip your sweet tooth in thebud.DOCOSAHEXAENOIC ACID (DHA) SUPPLEMENTS: This algae-based healthy fat helps lowertriglycerides, reduce blood pressure, thin the blood, and ensure optimalcirculation. Your body can make DHA from omega-3 fats, but you can alsosupplement for extra insurance. Fish obtain their DHA from algae, so rather thantake a fish oil pill, which may be rancid, you can go right to the primarysource and take an algae-based supplement. (For more about DHA, see this page[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_c03_r1.xhtml#page53].)WARMING SPICES: Ginger and cayenne pepper are great for helping clear congestionand increase your blood circulation. They also boost your metabolism and helpstrengthen your arteries and blood vessels. Be sure to keep cayenne handy tosprinkle onto wraps or sandwiches. Keep fresh ginger in the fridge, perhaps in asmall bowl near eye level so you remember to use it often. Grate it intostir-fries or slice it and add it into soups and teas.GARLIC: Garlic contains a compound known as allicin that helps open up yourcirculation and loosen congestion throughout your body. Garlic is a naturalblood thinner that can improve blood flow to your limbs.7[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c02-nts7] It’s especially potent in itsraw form, so try adding garlic to raw dips and salad dressings. Garlic still hasbenefits when heated, so you can add it when cooking, too. Radishes, onions, andleeks are also helpful in a similar fashion.PUMPKIN SEEDS AND ALMONDS: These both have high levels of vitamin E, which isgreat for keeping blood flowing freely throughout your body. They’re both alsogreat sources of beauty minerals such as calcium and zinc.WHOLE GRAINS: High in fiber, gluten-free whole grains such as brown rice helplower cholesterol by binding to bile acids and escorting them out of the body.(Bile acids, manufactured by the liver using cholesterol, are used to digestfat.) Because the fiber helps remove bile acids from circulation, the liver hasto manufacture new acids and then uses up more cholesterol. This process lowersthe amount of cholesterol circulating in the body. Soak all of your grains (andnuts) overnight to make them easier to digest for nutrient absorption.FOODS TO AVOID FOR OPTIMAL CIRCULATIONWhile the foods above will help boost your circulation, there are some foodsthat will have the opposite effect, slowing down your circulation and promotingaging throughout the body. For the best beauty-boosting results, try limiting oromitting the following foods from your diet.VEGETABLE OILSWhen heated, vegetable oils produce large amounts of beauty-destroying freeradicals.8 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c02-nts8] Free radicals arebasically “damaged” atoms or molecules with unpaired electrons that are believedto cause and accelerate aging and tissue damage. Stick to cooking and bakingwith coconut oil, which is made up largely of medium-chain fatty acids that canwithstand high heat without becoming rancid and digests well, supplying energyand even boosting metabolism.DAIRYIn vegan diets as well as in some Asian societies, dairy products are absent. Inveganism the contention is that dairy is mucus forming, contains no fiber, andis very hard for many people to digest. The National Institute of Diabetes andDigestive and Kidney Diseases estimates that 30 to 50 million Americans arelactose intolerant.9 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c02-nts9] Manypeople experience digestive relief after eliminating dairy from their diets forvarious reasons. As the Harvard School of Public Health states, “Clearly,although more research is needed, we cannot be confident that high milk…intakeis safe.”10 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c02-nts10]Of the two authors of this book, Kimberly feels strongly that cow’s milk is notin tune with the human body and its nutrition requirements. It’s debatable thatpeople have been conditioned to believe that dairy is automatically healthy toconsume, but that does not make it biologically right for everyone. Many peopleworry that without drinking cow’s milk, they won’t get enough calcium and willtherefore have bone density issues, but this is not true. Clinical researchshows that dairy products actually have little or no benefit for bones. Thereare numerous studies to back this up, including a 2005 review published in thejournal Pediatrics, which concluded that milk consumption does not improve boneintegrity in children.11 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c02-nts11] Asfor women, the Harvard Nurses’ Health Study followed more than 72,000 women foreighteen years, and its results showed that there was no protective effect ofincreased milk consumption on fracture risk.12[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c02-nts12] The consumption of dairyproducts has also been linked to higher risk for various cancers. The IowaWomen’s Health Study found that women who consumed more than one glass of milkdaily had a 73 percent greater chance of developing ovarian cancer than womenwho drank less than one glass per day.13[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c02-nts13]Besides, there are plenty of great plant sources of calcium to work into yourdiet, including Brussels sprouts, collard greens, mustard greens, cabbage,celery, oranges, sesame seeds/tahini, spinach, Swiss chard, and turnip greens.These have beneficial calcium but none of the risks associated with drinkingcow’s milk.Deepak respects the research but feels that milk has been a part of traditionaldiets in India as well as Western societies for centuries. In keeping with ourpolicy in this book that no food should be demonized, our position is thatpersonal experience can be the best guide if you stay receptive and intuitive tohow you react to certain foods after you eat them. Certainly there is no medicalharm to giving up dairy as long as you have adequate vitamin D both in your dietand through some exposure to sunlight. Try giving up dairy for two weeks and seeif you personally experience any improvements in your digestion and energy.PROCESSED SOYIn the United States, soy is now largely genetically modified. It is also a topfood allergen that many people don’t digest well. Though your first reaction isprobably to think of soy in the form of tofu, derivatives and highly processedforms of soy are actually in all kinds of packaged foods. For instance, if youlook on the label of most packaged energy or protein bars you’ll see “soyprotein isolates” listed as an ingredient. This is a fragmented and highlyprocessed soy derivative. If you can’t get organic soy, which by definitionmeans it is not GMO, or derived from a genetically modified organism, then youshould avoid it completely, but organic miso, tempeh, and natto are all greatchoices you can rotate into your diet. These forms are fermented, and the longprocess of fermentation makes the soy easier to digest and assimilate properly.GLUTENGluten is the dominant protein in wheat, barley, and rye. Like soy, gluten is atop food allergen. Those with celiac disease cannot tolerate gluten, but manyothers are sensitive to gluten despite not having celiac disease. Glutensensitivities can lead to bloating and inflammation in the intestinal tract, andgluten may also exacerbate or possibly contribute to autoimmune disorders.14[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c02-nts14] Wheat is a toppesticide-sprayed crop that often is grown in largely mineral-depleted soil. Tryeliminating gluten for two weeks and see if you notice a difference in anyexisting bloating or digestive issues, or if your overall energy improves. Butbe sure to avoid processed, low-quality gluten-free products and switch to morewhole-foods-based choices instead.CIGARETTES, CAFFEINE, AND ALCOHOLNo, cigarettes aren’t a food, but they’re worth mentioning here because of thedisastrous effects they have on your beauty and your health. Along with caffeineand alcohol, they constrict your circulation flow and greatly contribute toaccelerated aging.ANIMAL FATSWork to reduce your intake of red meat, dairy, and, especially, artificial transfats such as margarine. While there is some debate today about whether or notcholesterol is as bad for you as we’ve been led to believe over the past fewdecades, it’s still a good idea to be conservative with your consumption ofanimal fats. Plus, toxins and impurities like arsenic-based drugs,15[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c02-nts15] E. coli bacteria,16[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c02-nts16] and hormones17[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c02-nts17] can get stored in the fat ofanimal foods. Choose lean cuts and avoid oily skins.LIQUID GOLD CIRCULATION ELIXIRThis is a delicious way to incorporate beauty-building bee pollen into yourroutine. Remember to introduce bee pollen slowly, only a few granules at a time,to ensure your body tolerates it. (If you have a pollen allergy, you shouldavoid it.) Sip this midmorning or midafternoon as an energizing beverage.1½ cups coconut water1 ripe banana, peeled1 tablespoon bee pollen (more or less, adjust to your personal taste)1 tablespoon chia gel (chia seeds soaked in water for at least 30 minutes)Blend all the ingredients together.DIGESTION AND AGINGIn addition to efficient circulation, optimal digestion is key for the propernourishment of cells and tissues, leading to exceptional health, vitality, andbeauty. The body expels solid wastes through the digestive tract, but if thereis a blockage or an inefficient flow of elimination, then toxic overload mayensue. This can even lead to the reabsorption of toxins into the bloodstream,filtering through the wall of the colon (a problem commonly known as leaky gut).Your kidneys, lungs, liver, and skin are other eliminative, cleansing organsable to complete their functions more efficiently if there is no backup in thecolon. The gut-liver axis refers to the close anatomical and functionalrelationship between the gastrointestinal tract and the liver. There is aninteraction and exchange between the two organs.18[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c02-nts18] A study out of the WorldJournal of Gastroenterology found that taking probiotics to nourish the gut canhelp support the liver as well.19[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c02-nts19] Many have reported that thealleviation of constipation has helped clear up the stubborn acne and oily skinthat can be a function of an overloaded liver.There is a strong connection between your gut health and the quality of yourskin. One study found that small intestine bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), acondition involving inappropriate growth of bacteria in the small intestine, isten times more prevalent in people with acne rosacea, and that correction ofSIBO in these individuals led to marked clinical improvement in their skin.20[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c02-nts20] We can also see evidence ofthe gut/digestion/skin connection as probiotics can help improve skinconditions. The first case that studied this was back in 1961, when physicianRobert Siver tracked three hundred patients who were given a commerciallyavailable probiotic and found that 80 percent of those with acne showed someclinical improvement.21 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c02-nts21] Morerecent studies, including one from Italy, demonstrated that probiotics taken byacne patients in addition to standard care led to better clinical outcomes thanstandard care alone.22 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c02-nts22]Even if you take isolated vitamin supplements such as biotin (B7), vitamin C, orzinc (which is commonly recommended for acne) to improve your complexion or yourhair, nothing will really work if you have compromised digestion. Digestion isthe integrative process of absorbing and assimilating vitamins and othernutrients and expelling everything the body does not need. It makes sense thatoptimal digestion helps nourish and create beautiful, healthy skin.More efficient digestion can also allow you to clean out toxins moreproductively and make it easier to restore and maintain your natural weight. Itis well documented that those who struggle with obesity have significantlyimpaired gut function compared with the general population.23[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c02-nts23] Obese individuals are shown tohave problems with effective digestion and absorption of food, gastrointestinalillness, unstable or pathological intestinal microbiota, poor immune status, andoverall lower well-being. This all strongly suggests a lack of gut health.24[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c02-nts24] Diets high in vegetables orfiber lead to healthier functioning colons with a reduced risk of disease.25[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c02-nts25]If you are constipated, it is essential that you do something about itimmediately for your beauty and health’s sake. Another symptom of sluggishdigestion is everyone’s least favorite feeling: bloating. There’s nothingbeautiful about trying to peel out of your seat at dinner feeling like yourbelly is going to split your dress down the middle, or trying to focus on yourstaff meeting or be present to go over your kids’ homework when your wideningmidsection pushes past your pants seam, internally screaming at you to payattention to it and it alone.YOU MAY BE CHRONICALLY DEHYDRATED (EVEN IF YOU DON’T THINK YOU ARE)Many of us don’t realize when we are chronically dehydrated. This is a bigproblem because many chronic beauty issues, such as weakened hair and dry skin,are caused or exacerbated by chronic dehydration. Dehydration can cause yourkidneys and the rest of your body to hold water. This can lead to metabolicwaste not being properly flushed out of your body, which causes congestion andcontributes to accelerated aging.You may need to consume more water than you think to ensure that your system isproperly hydrated. This is especially true if you live in a dry climate, sweat alot in your workouts, consume alcohol, drink excessive amounts of caffeine, orare following a high protein diet. (The body has to use up more water to flushout the nitrogen in protein.)So how much water do you really need? It depends on your size, physicalactivity, health status, and where you live. If you are looking for a goalnumber to try to plan around, a very general recommendation is to take yourweight in pounds and divide that in two, and that’s around how many ounces ofwater you need per day. For instance, if you weigh 140 pounds, then you needaround 70 ounces of water per day. Monitor your urine and make sure it staysclear or pale yellow, and always avoid getting to the point of extreme thirstbefore having more water.Be sure to also keep some room temperature water on your desk, in your purse, orin your car. If you drink smoothies or green juice, you are getting somehydration through those sources. Juicy fruits and veggies like cucumbers andcelery are also good sources of hydration. If you drink alcohol, which isdehydrating, increase your water intake the next day and make sure to drinkplenty of water while actually imbibing (as well as before and afterward!).Bloating is more than unpleasant; it’s a sign that your digestion has beencompromised in some way. Luckily, there are many Radical Beauty recommendationsto help you reduce bloat once and for all. The tips below will help increaseyour digestive power; alleviate constipation and irregular, uncomfortable, orincomplete elimination; banish bloat once and for all; and amplify your energy.All of this can contribute to the unfolding of your own natural beauty’sexpression.RADICAL ACTION STEPS TO IMPROVE YOUR DIGESTION AND BANISH BLOATNow that you know how important good digestion is to your beauty, here are themost effective steps you can take to improve it.PROBIOTICSA high-quality probiotic supplement will help balance the bacteria in your gutand promote better digestion. When choosing a supplement, remember that it’s notall about numbers; don’t look just for the highest culture counts on the label.Instead, look for a product with the widest array of soil-based organisms(SBOs), which are the types of bacteria that can fully survive your stomach acidand take up long-term residence in your gut. This paves the way for continuinggut health and beauty. A formula containing both prebiotics and probiotics isalso great, as the prebiotics serve as the “food” to help nourish the probioticsin your gut.FIBERTo increase your fiber, eat more veggies in general and include them at allmeals, as only plant foods contain fiber (while meat and dairy do not). It’salso important to diversify. The bacteria that digest your food, known asintestinal flora, consume the fiber that we cannot digest. There are between 500and 2,000 species of these microorganisms in the digestive tract, and they feedon all manner of fiber. Variety is therefore essential, covering the entireplant kingdom in your diet, which means fiber from whole grains, fruits, andvegetables. To maximize the effect of any fiber, use the whole food; choosewhole fruits over straight fruit juice, for instance. Buy brown rice in place ofwhite, and choose steel-cut oatmeal over sugary, processed cereals. This naturaldiversity is much healthier for you than commercial fiber supplements. Careshould be taken with the rough bran in bran-rich cereals, however, since it canscrape against the intestinal wall and even injure it. See this page[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_c02_r1.xhtml#page39] for tips to increase your fiberintake while avoiding excessive gassiness.HOT WATERDrinking hot water in the morning (with some lemon squeezed in) can encourageyour bowels to let go and allow for more efficient elimination. This morningpractice contributes to good hydration, which, as noted earlier, is reallyimportant. It’s also a good idea to get up earlier. Your gut does not respondwell to being rushed, so allow for ample bathroom time after drinking your hotwater to let your body relax and do its thing!AVOID HARD-TO-DIGEST FOODSProcessed foods, fried foods, and dairy are particularly hard on your digestivesystem.The more detoxified your body is, the more beautiful you become.TIME YOUR MEALS WISELYTry waiting at least 3 hours between meals instead of constantly grazing duringthe day. This allows the foods in your system to digest more fully. Bloat (seethis page [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_c02_r1.xhtml#page35]) may be compounded ifyour digestive system is constantly full of food, and you pile more and morefood that doesn’t have enough time to digest on top. Also try simplifying yourmeals by using fewer components.USE SPICES STRATEGICALLYBoost sluggish digestion, or agni in Ayerveda, with spices like turmeric, cumin,black pepper, and ginger. You can sprinkle these spices into stir-fries, soups,and salad dressings, or try adding them to hot water and make your own spicetea.TRY A MAGNESIUM-OXYGEN SUPPLEMENT (LIKE DETOXY +)This nonlaxative, non-habit-forming aid helps clear out accumulated waste inyour system. Constipation and waste buildup may also contribute to bloating.TAKE DIGESTIVE ENZYMES BEFORE MEALSThese are capsules you can take to help your food break down more efficientlyand support better digestion and assimilation. There are various kinds ofenzymes included in various formulations, but in a nutshell, proteases breakdown proteins, lipases break down fats, and amylases break down carbohydrates.AVOID FIZZY BEVERAGESThe carbon dioxide that makes soda and even plain seltzer bubbly can cause orexacerbate bloating.STEAM YOUR VEGGIESIf your system is rebuilding, try steaming your veggies instead of eating themraw. This can help break down the fiber and make them easier to digest.EAT MORE SLOWLY AND DON’T OVEREATThe latter probably seems quite obvious, but if you scarf down your lunch whilehunched over your computer or lap up a huge plate of food in record time as soonas you get home after a long workday (maybe because you skipped lunch), you mayfind that eating quickly has a sneaky way of contributing to overeating. Slowdown your consumption and you’ll leave the space in your stomach needed to breakdown foods, which can help abate bloating.LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF DENSE FAT IN EACH MEALFat takes longer to digest than protein or carbohydrates and can make you feeluncomfortably heavy if you consume too much of it at once. Avoid bloating bylimiting fats in your everyday diet. (You do need the right amount and type offat, but you don’t need to overdo it. See this page[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_c03_r1.xhtml#page51] for more info.) A little bit ofoil goes a long way when cooking. Try getting a ceramic (non-Teflon) nonstickpan that allows for easier cooking and cleanup while letting you use less oiloverall.SOAK BEANS, LEGUMES, AND GRAINS OVERNIGHTThese foods contain sugars called oligosaccharides, enzyme inhibitors, andphytic acid, which bind to essential minerals and inhibit their absorption.Soaking can help deactivate these substances, which in turn assists inpreventing bloating while improving nutrient absorption.CHOOSE YOUR VEGETABLES WISELYBrassica or cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts,and leafy greens are fantastically high in nutrients but can be particularly gasinducing due to the sugars and starches they contain. If you are having majorbloating problems or especially if you are transitioning your diet, trytemporarily cutting back on broccoli, cauliflower, and Brussels sprouts andhaving leafy green salads instead of kale salads, as kale (a popular new“superfood” rich in minerals, vitamins, and amino acids) also happens to be inthis vegetable family.EAT PINEAPPLEPineapple contains the enzyme bromelain, which helps break down proteins in yourbody and aids digestion. Try using pineapple as the fruit component of yourGlowing Green Smoothie (this page[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_c02_r1.xhtml#page27]) or having a bowl of cut-uppineapple midmorning.HOW TO INCORPORATE MORE FIBER (WHILE PREVENTING GASSINESS!)Internal Nourishment is all about consuming plenty of veggies and natural foods,so by eating more veggies, plant-based meals, and health drinks such as GlowingGreen Smoothie (this page [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_c02_r1.xhtml#page27]), youare going to naturally increase your fiber intake. This is a great thing, whichis a bit of an understatement. Fiber is important for cleansing and helps movetoxins out of your body so that your true beauty can shine through. But if youabruptly increase your fiber intake from a little to a lot, you may feel moregassy and bloated as your body adjusts.The key is to drink more water to prevent gassiness. Fiber happens to be anindigestible carbohydrate. That’s why it’s great for bulking up meals withoutadding extra calories and helping you feel full when you eat lots ofsuper-beautifying plant foods. But fiber also absorbs a great deal of water. Ifthere is not enough water in your system, too much fiber can cause slowermovement through the digestive system, which in turn leads to bloating andgassiness. Be sure to drink lots of room temperature water in between (ratherthan during) meals so it’s there to be used by your digestive system when youneed it to process all that fiber. Drinking too much water at meals can dilutedigestive enzymes and slow down digestion, also contributing to bloating.Steaming veggies rather than eating them raw can also make it easier to breakdown fiber, especially when transitioning your diet. Chew a little bit whendrinking your Glowing Green Smoothie, rather than chugging it, as it is made upof whole foods. Soon enough, you’ll get used to eating more fiber. You’ll bemore cleansed, and your belly will be more taut and tight to boot!AVOID SPICY AND PUNGENT FOODSEspecially if your system is sensitive, hot sauces and spices like chili powder,garlic, onions, and vinegar can cause irritation in your stomach that can leadto bloating. Try using flavorful fresh herbs such as basil, oregano, and parsleyinstead.AVOID STRAWSDrinking through a straw makes it easier to swallow excess air, which cancontribute to bloat. Along those same lines, give up chewing gum, which trapsair and gas in your system, contributing to bloating. Chewing is a signal foryour body to start breaking down food and begin digestion. Gum chewing istherefore useless and confusing to your body as it is not accompanied byanything nutritive to digest!DAILY DETOXIFICATIONMost of us do our best to focus on what we put into our bodies, but the truth isthat what you clean out is just as important. To be your most beautiful, youhave to constantly support the removal of toxins from your cells.There are two kinds of toxins: exogenous toxins come from pollutants andchemicals in the environment, while endogenous toxins are the normal by-productsof metabolism that are created within your body. Your cells are being renovateddaily by two opposite processes, either building up (anabolism) or breaking down(catabolism). As a result, your body has to clear out an enormous amount ofcellular debris each and every day. If this is done inefficiently, it can weighdown your body and contribute to toxicity buildup.Detoxification happens naturally, but you can take steps to raise the level ofefficiency. Supporting your daily detoxification processes is vital to maintainclear, glowing skin and a youthful appearance.ARE YOU OVERLY TOXIC?Which of the following apply to you? Unclear head, mental dullness Frequent upset stomach or bloating Chronic aches and pains Constipation and digestive distress Offensive body odors Bad breath Continual fatigue Sallow, aging skin Strong addiction to sweets Waking with a stuffy nose Coated tongueIf three or more of these pertain to you, your ongoing detoxification couldprobably use some extra support. Be sure to pay attention and apply the advicein this pillar to help enhance the ongoing cleansing mechanisms of your body.YOUR BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTY-BUILDING LIVERYour liver is a critical beauty organ. Weighing around 3 power-packed pounds,the liver is your primary organ for detoxification. It works tirelessly tocleanse your blood of toxins and bacteria and neutralize pollutants. In fact, itfilters around one hefty quart of blood per minute, dealing with all theagrochemicals, toxins, pollutants, food additives, preservatives, residues,pesticides, and countless other unnamed residues and chemicals that you put intoyour body unknowingly (or knowingly, in the case of those margaritas you had athappy hour last Friday!). After processing all these toxins, your liver secretesthem into the digestive tract to exit the body or into a water-soluble form tobe filtered through the kidneys and excreted as urine.It’s extremely important to support your liver if you want beautiful skin, eyes,and hair. In addition to its role in detoxification, this organ is the keeper ofsome sacred beauty goods. It stores vitamins A, B12, and D, as well as iron,copper, and glucose, releasing these nutrients into the bloodstream as needed.26[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c02-nts26]Your liver is also a major fat burner, since it produces bile and bile acids,which emulsify fats. One issue that brings home the importance of the liver ischolesterol. For decades the link between cholesterol and heart attacks, now theleading cause of death among women as well as men, has been controversial.Does this surprise you? We’ve all taken for granted that cholesterol is bad foryou. In fact, the majority of cholesterol is manufactured by the body itself andis a necessary part of building cells. There is no controversy over this fact,or the risk posed by “bad” cholesterol, or low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Thethorny issue that arises is over the cholesterol you eat versus the cholesterolyour body makes. There is ample proof that high cholesterol in the blood putssomeone at risk for heart disease. But the same has not been proved forcholesterol in the diet. This is because of the liver, which stands midway as akind of processing plant to turn all the fat you eat into fat for your body touse.How your liver processes fat is genetically determined. Some people can eat ahigh-cholesterol diet and still have low cholesterol in the blood; they arelucky when it comes to their liver. Other people are unlucky, and they exhibithigh levels of cholesterol in the blood even on a low-fat diet. But most peoplefall somewhere in between. Their liver will process the cholesterol in theirdiet into a moderate level of cholesterol in the blood. This natural ratio isconsidered healthy, but it must be noted that aging causes cholesterol levels torise. This may be genetically programmed, but it is just as likely that eating atypical high-fat diet for decades causes the liver to decline in function. Forthe moment, it’s probably best to be prudent, regularly eating the foods rich inthe omega-3 fatty acids that we recommend on this page[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_c03_r1.xhtml#page54], such as chia seeds, which have abeneficial effect on fats in the blood, and cutting out or greatly reducing the“hard fats” found in red meat.After being produced by the liver, bile is stored in the gallbladder andsecreted into the small intestine to break down those beauty fats and put themto good use. In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), the liver is considered aprimary organ responsible for circulating blood and qi throughout the body.According to TCM, a healthy, well-functioning liver is important for healthymenstruation and fertility.27 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c02-nts27]When the liver is overloaded by toxicity or mistreated, it becomes dysfunctionaland cannot complete its important tasks—from detoxifying to fat burning andblood cleaning—as efficiently as it should. This can lead to premature aging anddiminished energy and beauty. When your liver can efficiently process toxicity,your skin becomes brighter and more beautiful, more nutrition is able to reachyour hair follicles, and you have more beautiful energy overall. The great newsis that this is a resilient organ with super-regenerative powers. Unless youhave an extremely damaged liver or a condition like cirrhosis, there is much youcan do to help it rebuild and regenerate even if you’ve abused your liver in thepast. Taking care of your liver is an essential beauty task. In addition to allof the tips for boosting digestion, following are some of the best techniquesand foods to nourish your liver and increase detoxification within your body ona daily basis.STAY AWAY FROM HIGH PROTEIN DIETSHigh protein diets have become popular ways to lose weight, but they may alsocontribute to accelerated aging and disease.28[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c02-nts28] Nowadays, most people consumefar more protein than their bodies really need. Valter Longo, director of theLongevity Institute at the University of Southern California, states, “Themajority of Americans are eating about twice as much proteins as they should.”29[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c02-nts29] Research has shown thatlong-term high protein intake results in increased cancer risk, precipitatedprogression of coronary artery disease, disorders of bone and renal function,and disorders of liver function.30[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c02-nts30] Clearly, when it comes toprotein, too much can have negative effects on your system (see this page[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_c03_r1.xhtml#page72]). Lesson: You can clearly overdoit, so be mindful of how much you are consuming.Your liver plays a role in protein metabolism, including processing aminoacids,31 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c02-nts31] converting them intoglucose for energy, and removing ammonia, a natural waste product of proteinmetabolism, from the bloodstream.32[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c02-nts32] The liver also synthesizesnonessential amino acids. An overabundance of protein places a burden on theliver. Try cutting back on animal protein in particular and eating morenutrient-dense plant-based meals to help your liver stay on top of its vitalhealth- and beauty-boosting functions.LIMIT MEDICATIONSOnly use over-the-counter drugs when absolutely needed. This includesacetaminophen, also known by the brand name Tylenol, which research has shownhas a particularly strong effect on the liver.33[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c02-nts33] While drugs can be critical inemergencies and accidents, as well as very helpful in treating various medicalconditions, your liver does have to detoxify them. Keep this in mind whenchoosing which medications to take. If you have a headache, resting andrehydrating instead of immediately popping a pill is better for your liver. Veryoften, drinking water, restoring B vitamins by eating a banana, or getting amassage to help alleviate stress will relieve a headache without taking any typeof drug. Speak to your doctor about which prescription medications areabsolutely necessary.LIMIT PROCESSED FOOD AND GO ORGANIC AS MUCH AS POSSIBLEAll the preservatives, pesticides, artificial dyes, and chemicals that go intopackaged foods can distort metabolic processes in the liver. Eat clean and haveclean, beautiful skin.EAT MORE PLANTSIncrease your intake of fruits and especially vegetables, which are verynourishing to your liver. This is easy to accomplish by drinking the GlowingGreen Smoothie (this page [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_c02_r1.xhtml#page27]),eating bigger salads at meals, and keeping fresh, cut-up veggies around to munchon.START YOUR DAY DRINKING HOT WATER WITH LEMONWater helps flush out wastes and supports your liver, as well as the functioningof your entire body. Hot lemon water helps purify and stimulate the liver andliquefies bile while inhibiting excess bile flow. It supports your digestion andeven has a similar atomic composition to saliva and hydrochloric acid, which areused in digestion.34 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c02-nts34]DRINK LIVER-SUPPORTING TEA WITH MILK THISTLESeveral studies suggest that substances in the milk thistle plant (especially aflavonoid called silymarin) protect the liver from toxins, although research hasbeen limited, mixed, and preliminary.35[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c02-nts35] If you are new to this herb,be sure to consult your health-care professional first.AVOID FRIED FOODSThis particularly includes foods made from heated vegetable oils (such as potatochips). Cooked, reused, and rancid oils can put an especially big burden on yourliver and on digestion in general.36[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c02-nts36] In lab research, even oliveoil cooked at high temperatures has been shown to induce oxidative stress on theliver.37 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c02-nts37] It’s best to cookwith coconut oil, which can withstand high temperatures.TAKE A TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE APPROACHIn Traditional Chinese Medicine, if someone has “liver yin deficiency,” theliver has been compromised. This results in hair loss and sallow skin. Tostrengthen your liver, this ancient Asian medical system recommends eatingzucchini, squash, potatoes, sweet potatoes, string beans, beets, mushrooms,tomatoes, spinach, carrots, parsley, apples, banana, mulberries, mango, coconut,peaches, lychee fruit, melons, oats, tempeh, and black sesame seeds.38[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c02-nts38]AVOID FOIE GRASRadical Beauty is more about creating a balanced lifestyle than adhering toabsolutes, but one hard-and-fast rule is to steer clear of beauty-diminishingfoie gras. Foie gras sounds fancy, and some people claim it’s delicious, butit’s quite literally the toxic liver of geese and ducks that likely have beenfed an unnatural diet of GMO corn. Such a diet creates fatty liver disease inthese animals, and the excessive fat makes their liver taste rich and buttery,but it’s a lot less tempting when you realize that it’s disease making it tastethis way, isn’t it? Although consuming offal (the internal organs and entrailsof butchered animals) has become an en vogue gourmet phenomenon, it’s best toavoid consuming animal liver from any four-, two-, or no-legged creature (i.e.,fish). Now that you understand the liver is the detoxifying center for the body,you probably want to avoid eating an organ full of toxins without any extraencouragement.EAT MORE GRAPEFRUITGrapefruit is high in vitamin C and antioxidants and can help your liver flushout carcinogens and toxins. It also gives your liver a boost in dealing withvarious medications. In a lab study, grapefruit juice was shown to preventdamage to DNA molecules that were exposed to conventional anticancer drugs.39[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c02-nts39]TRY BEETSBeets are high in plant flavonoids and cleansing fiber and can improve theoverall functioning of your liver.UP YOUR LEAFY GREEN INTAKELeafy greens like spinach and romaine lettuce contain chlorophyll and thousandsof phytonutrients that can help neutralize the metals, chemicals, and pesticidesthat may be in your food, thereby helping to protect the liver.DRINK GREEN TEAGreen tea is full of plant antioxidants known as catechins, which improve theliver’s functioning.EAT MORE AVOCADOSAvocados are a great source of an antioxidant called glutathione, which yourliver uses to filter out toxins and harmful waste.SLOWLY INCREASE CRUCIFEROUS VEGETABLESCruciferous veggies like broccoli and Brussels sprouts increase the amount ofglucosinolate (organic compounds) in our bodies, thereby increasing thedigestive enzymes that flush toxins and taxing pollutants from the body.(Temporarily delay or start slowly when introducing these veggies if youcurrently are prone to bloating or transitioning your diet.)TRY TURMERICThe spice turmeric is not only a fantastic anti-inflammatory aid, but it canalso help detoxify your liver by stimulating the production of bile to help yourbody digest fats better. Start incorporating it into your cooking regimen—checkout the Radical Beauty Liver Tonic recipe (below) and the Creamy MasalaVegetable Stew (this page [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_app1_r1.xhtml#ind260a]).RADICAL BEAUTY LIVER TONICThis toning, cleansing, and anti-inflammatory drink can be made at any time tohelp nourish and give your liver a boost.1-inch piece of ginger, sliced thinlyFiltered water (enough to fill your tea mug)Juice of ½ lemon2 teaspoons raw honey (or coconut sugar or nectar)¼ teaspoon powdered turmericPinch of cayenne pepperPinch of black pepperPlace the ginger slices in a tea mug. Heat the water in a teakettle or small potand then pour the hot water over the ginger slices, allowing them to steep forabout 3 minutes. Add the remaining ingredients and mix well. Enjoy immediately.GO FOR WALNUTSLike avocados, walnuts are also high in glutathione and omega-3 fatty acids,which can support your liver’s cleansing functions.DETOXING ALCOHOLIt’s probably obvious by now that if you want to be as toxin-free as possible,you should avoid alcohol. No one would suggest that alcohol is a beauty booster.But the divide between theory and reality can be wide! It’s perhaps unrealisticto think you’ll never drink an alcoholic beverage again. This may be the casefor some of you, but for others, it’s a distinct possibility that you may have adrink (or a few) here and there, as well as some big nights out. (Though if youare serious about preserving your beauty, these would be increasingly lessfrequent.)Alcohol is a hepatotoxin, meaning it specifically damages your liver and impairsyour body’s ability to detoxify itself. Alcohol is also dehydrating and causesyour skin to look less fresh and smooth, especially the day after imbibing.There is no doubt that alcohol is depleting. If and when do you decide toindulge, there’s some important information to keep in mind when picking yourpoison.LIMIT CONGENERSChances are you’ve never heard of congeners. But if you drink alcohol, you haveunknowingly consumed them. Congeners are substances produced during fermentationthat can include small amounts of chemicals such as esters, tannins, acetone,methanol, and aldehydes. Congeners are responsible for most of the taste andaroma of distilled alcoholic beverages and may contribute to the symptoms of ahangover.40 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c02-nts40] Darker liquorssuch as whiskey or scotch contain more congeners than clear liquors. Researchhas suggested that whiskey and dark liquors can produce stronger hangovers dueto their high levels of congeners.41[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c02-nts41] This means that because oftheir extra impurities, darker liquors hit your body in a stronger and perhapsmore damaging and aging way. If you are going to drink hard liquor, stick toclear varieties such as vodka or gin.KEEP IT SIMPLEThe simplest drinks are, of course, shots, but these are definitely not the bestidea as they go down way too fast and may lead you to consume far more than yourealize. A better option is to nurse a simple drink of vodka, soda water, andlime. Avoid sugary mixers, which add inflammation on top of the toxic effects ofthe alcohol and further age your skin, adding a sallow appearance, darkunder-eye circles, and puffiness. Skip the mojitos and other mixed drinks thatcall for pure cane sugar. Also avoid sugary mixers such as orange juice, sodas,energy drinks, margarita mixes, and the like. It’s simply too much for your poorbody to take all at once. If you really want a sweet drink, try adding somestevia, xylitol, or a little coconut sugar or raw honey to unsweetened anddiluted cranberry juice and vodka. Of course, it would be hard to find this at abar, but you could make it for yourself and your friends during a festive homehangout.CHOOSE RED OVER WHITERed wine contains more antioxidants than white, so it is generally the betterchoice. However, red wine can also inflame the skin and trigger a histaminerelease in some people (especially those of Asian descent). This can causeredness and preexisting rosacea to flare up. Unfortunately, wine often comeswith added sulfites, and the sugars in wine can contribute to candida andsugar-imbalance issues. Still, if you have none of these aforementioned issues,red wine (in moderation) is not a bad choice.SKIP THE BEERBeer shouldn’t be your go-to alcohol of choice (minus those occasionaltailgating parties, perhaps). Because of the hops that are used to brew it, beerhas some estrogenic effects, meaning it can disrupt your hormones.42[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c02-nts42] It can also be very bloatingand often contains gluten.TOXIC OVERLOAD: HOW TO DEAL WITH A HANGOVERAlright, so it happened. You woke up feeling completely lousy from one (or afew) drinks too many. It’s too late now to try to alternate drinks with water orto pass on that last cocktail. (Who knew it would come back to bite you thisbadly!) What should you do?Drinking lots and lots of room temperature water to rehydrate your entire systemis a good place to start. You can also sip on hot water with lemon to help flushout your liver. Add some ginger, which will stimulate digestion and help youprocess the excess alcohol lingering in your system. Coconut water will alsohelp, as it contains potassium, electrolytes, and some B vitamins that willcombat dehydration and replenish your body.For breakfast, eating fiber-filled foods will make you feel more balanced. Asimple gluten-free avocado sandwich will stabilize you, and the carbohydrates inthe bread will absorb the excess alcohol in your system while helping your achyhead. Also try eating a banana, which contains potassium and B vitamins, to helpreplenish what your body lost from your little alcohol binge; some oatmeal witha banana would actually be a fantastic choice.At lunchtime, a hummus and veggie wrap or sandwich (preferably with gluten-freebread) can also be comforting and digests well during this “delicate” time. Anice big lentil or veggie soup with some brown rice, or vegetarian sushi rolls,are also good choices. Try some chopped cabbage either in a salad or in ahealthy slaw with a little tahini as the base. The cabbage will help stabilizeyour blood glucose levels. Stay away from greasy foods (as tempting as they maybe) or the misguided “hair of the dog” approach (which refers to drinking morealcohol the next morning to ease a painful hangover), which will just add to thedigestive burden and make it harder for you to get back to normal. Don’t worry;this, too, will pass."},{"pageContent":"SHIFT 3:RADICAL BEAUTY RATIOS AND MACRONUTRIENT BALANCEWhether they came from Ireland, Japan, or Namibia, our ancestors didn’t approachhealth and beauty by hunching over calculators and calorie-tracking apps. Theycertainly had no intention of figuring out to the last milligram how much wasneeded of every nutrient and micronutrient. Analyzing numbers, which often leadsquickly to obsessing over them, is not natural, and your goal is to move closerto your body’s natural intelligence so you can express more of your own naturalbeauty.Knowing what’s in each food requires too much time and effort that is muchbetter spent reaching a single goal: knowing just a few essential ratios. Theseratios will be enough to allow your body to optimize its own ability to maintainhealth and beauty. Thankfully it’s much simpler to stay on track this way.Starting today, look at your food from a big-picture perspective that will allowyou to adhere to general guidelines instead of becoming a slave to numbers. Hereare some of the top Radical Beauty ratios to know to help you bring forth yourmaximum beauty.RADICAL BEAUTY RATIO #1: ESSENTIAL FATTY ACIDSMany people who are trying to lose or maintain their weight focus on steeringclear of fat, but the correct kind and amount of fat is essential for optimaland sustained beauty. We all need fat to nourish our skin properly, sustainproper energy levels, regulate our hormones, and build shiny hair and strongnails.Essential fatty acids (EFAs) perform many different functions in the body thatare vital for health and beauty. In particular, they help build beautiful,radiant skin. These fats help maintain the integrity of cellular walls, whichhelps to maintain water and vital nutrients while allowing for the release ofwastes. This is critical to skin health. When your skin is fully hydrated andable to retain water within its cells, it appears youthfully supple. This iswhere these EFAs are key, because they are the components that help keep yourskin cells healthy and your skin’s membrane functioning optimally. A more suppleand flexible cellular structure may also reduce the appearance of cellulite.A lack of these important fats can lead to dry skin that doesn’t maintain itsplump, healthy-looking structure and ends up sagging like a slowly deflatinghelium balloon (obviously the look you do not want). Healthy cellular walls,reinforced by essential fatty acids, help to continually remove wastes. This canalso be very helpful for eradicating acne. When you consider acne you mightnaturally think it’s better to avoid all oils, but getting in some essentialfats is actually helpful. EFAs maintain an ideal level of fats so that your skindoesn’t overproduce sebum. The wrong balance of fats and a deficiency of theright fats produce imbalances in sebum and leads to breakouts.1[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c03-nts1]In this section we will focus on the two main families: omega-6 fatty acids andomega-3 fatty acids. Excessive omega-6 fatty acids ingested through vegetableoils are thought to induce inflammation in the body (acting as “pro-inflammatorymediators”) and have been associated with specific conditions like thedevelopment of inflammatory acne.2[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c03-nts2] In the right balance, EFAs helpensure that wastes leave the skin in a healthy way, which prevents cloggedpores. Essential fats also nourish skin that has already been damaged byblemishes (and from picking at your skin!).The I-word—inflammation—should be everyone’s concern. In 2015 the NationalInstitutes of Health made this a major medical priority, assigning hundreds ofmillions of dollars to discover what the hidden damage of chronic inflammationactually is and how to prevent it. For most people, inflammation is a new issue,because they don’t realize that low-level chronic inflammation is pervasive insociety. When you burn or cut yourself, the inflammation response is a naturalpart of healing. There is warmth, redness, and swelling at the affected area.But inflammation can exist, not as a healing mechanism but due to the constantirritant of things like stress, leaky gut, and residual toxins in the tissues.You will be hearing much more about chronic inflammation in years to come. Evenwithout signs like warmth, redness, and swelling—in fact, without symptoms atall—inflammation contributes to serious health issues like cardiovasculardisease and autoimmune diseases,3[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c03-nts3] but it can also lead to freeradicals4 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c03-nts4] that exacerbatewrinkles and contribute to new ones,5[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c03-nts5] aging your skin and body ingeneral.Fatty acids play a key role in inflammation on both the good and bad side.Omega-3 fats help oxygen circulate throughout the body, ensuring that cellactivity is healthy and that your organs and red blood cells are functioningproperly. This is essential for maximum energy. These fats are also important tohelp abate inflammation6 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c03-nts6] andnourish the skin. Not having enough omega-3 fats can lead to a variety ofissues, such as eczema, allergies, and depression.7[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c03-nts7]The major omega-3 acid is converted into two others—eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)—which are also important for a healthy heart andbrain (your brain is actually made up of 60 percent fat),8[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c03-nts8] as well as helping to balance aperson’s moods.9 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c03-nts9] Sometimes theconversion of fatty acids isn’t optimal. If you are concerned, try algae-basedsupplements. Fish obtain most of their omega-3 fats from algae, and thesesupplements don’t pose the possible contamination or rancidity risks of fish oilpills.The other type of EFA, omega-6 fatty acids, is also important. As with omega-3s,it also converts into two other acids—linoleic acid (LA) and gamma-linolenicacid (GLA). Omega-6 fatty acids are a precursor for a hormone-like substancecalled prostaglandins, which have an impact on many functions of the body,including calcium movement, cell growth, the kidneys’ filtration rate, and theconstriction and dilation of the smooth muscle cells in your veins.Whether your diet is well rounded or full of junk food, you’re probably gettingenough (or even more than enough) omega-6 fatty acids. That’s because omega-6sare found in vegetable oils like corn, canola, and soybean, which are used innearly every packaged chip, cookie, cracker, and treat on grocery shelves.Omega-6s are also plentiful in seeds, nuts, vegetables, grains, eggs, andpoultry. You really don’t have to boost this nutrient in your diet; it’s alreadythere. Omega-3s, on the other hand, are much less common in the standard Westerndiet. This is a problem because the ratio between these two types of EFAs canhave a dramatic impact on your health and beauty.The ideal ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fats is anywhere between 1:1 and 4:1, butdue to the large amount of animal products, fast food, processed foods,vegetable oils, and fried foods they eat, Americans tend to have anywhere fromseventeen10 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c03-nts10] to thirty or evenfifty times more omega-6s than omega-3s.11[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c03-nts11] The result of thisout-of-whack ratio is a contribution to that silent beauty killer calledinflammation that you can’t feel sneaking up on you but that damages your skinby causing wrinkles and premature aging.But don’t worry; you can start balancing your EFA ratio today! To keep yourratio in check, try to consume more omega-3 fatty acids in whole-food forms fromthe following sources:• Chia seeds• Flaxseeds• Walnuts• Chlorella• Hemp seeds• Sesame seeds and tahini (made from ground sesame seeds)• Cauliflower• Purslane (as well as other weeds and greens)• Brussels sprouts• Algae-based omega-3 fatty acid supplement• Dark, leafy greens such as spinachAnd cut out or at least consume less of these top omega-6 sources:• Sunflower, canola, soy, cottonseed, and generic vegetable oils• Margarine• Junk foods such as chips, crackers, and popcorn that contain the above oils(Blends of these oils are often labeled “vegetable oils” in the ingredientlist.)• Fried foods, such as fried chicken, french fries, tempura, and so on.RADICAL BEAUTY RATIO #2: THE ACID/ALKALINE RATIOIf you were a chemist and looked at the body as a sea of chemicals, one of thefirst tests you’d perform would be to see how acid or alkaline someone’s bodyis. This test looks for the pH value, a simple scale that goes from very acid tovery alkaline:> 0 to 7 pH = acid> > 7 pH = neutral> > 7 to 14 pH = alkalineThis is the same measurement that can be done with litmus paper, which turnspink when dipped into an acidic solution and blue when dipped into an alkalinesolution; purple is neutral. Your body has zones that need to be acid oralkaline—there’s no single pH for everywhere. Blood must be maintained slightlyalkaline, while the stomach needs to be highly acidic to digest food. In otherareas, like your mouth, too much acidity leads to being vulnerable to cavities(candy and other sweets convert into acids due to the digestive activity ofsaliva).Your body is incredibly precise about maintaining the right pH levels, and whenthey are off, it compensates by drawing upon specific micronutrients,particularly minerals. Calcium, magnesium, and potassium are chief among theminerals that are alkaline, and the good news is that restoring these traceminerals, particularly through a diet rich in fresh fruits and vegetables, canbe a very quick, effective treatment for restoring bodily balance, as well as apreventive for many health and beauty conditions.Every food you eat has either an acidic or alkalizing effect on the body, andeven though these two authors don’t adopt a so-called alkaline-ash diet, theratio between acidic and alkalizing foods is another essential one for achievingtrue beauty. Alkalizing foods can help neutralize harmful acids,12[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c03-nts12] and your body’s pH has a bigimpact on your beauty and the rate at which you age.A fascinating study from the Journal of Environmental and Public Health,outlined in an article entitled “The Alkaline Diet: Is There Evidence That anAlkaline pH Diet Benefits Health?” found that an alkaline diet, made up of anabundance of fruits and vegetables, has many health and beauty benefits,including helping to prevent muscle wasting (keeping your body beautifullytoned), increasing growth hormone (which can help your skin stay smooth andyouthful), improving lower back pain, and increasing available magnesium that isneeded to activate vitamin D,13[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c03-nts13] which aids in keeping yourbones and teeth beautifully strong. A chronically acid-forming diet can lead toa loss of calcium through the urine, weaker bones, and the loss of otheralkaline minerals, such as potassium and magnesium. The loss and imbalance ofkey minerals can lead to dry skin that cracks, is itchy, and ages prematurely.14[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c03-nts14]Acid diminishes the supply of oxygen available to all your body’s tissues andcells. The lack of oxygen interferes with mitochondrial function, and the cell’sability to repair and replenish itself becomes impaired. The result is increasedgeneral aging of all your cells and increased fatigue, which can lead you toreach for external energy aids such as coffee and energy drinks, which are oftenacidic and make this imbalance even worse.Increased acidity also can make you age more in other ways. An acidicenvironment can throw off your bacterial balance, imbalancing the proliferationof “bad” bacteria over the “good,” and leading to more harmful microorganismsthat can contribute to inflammation. Because acids are corrosive, additionaltissue damage and inflammation can ensue. Free radicals can abound in your body,unleashing their beauty-squashing potential on your precious cells.HOW PH AFFECTS YOUR BEAUTYMuch of your beauty potential is determined at this cellular level. When yourbody is more alkaline, there is an increased flow of oxygen and nutrients intoyour cell walls, and cellular waste is disposed of more easily.15[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c03-nts15] If you are chronically acidic,however, less oxygen and fewer nutrients are delivered to your cells. This canlead to a buildup of waste inside your cells, which contributes to a vast arrayof health and beauty issues, such as diminished energy, sallow skin, andwrinkles. Your body can fully absorb and utilize key beauty nutrients onlywithin certain pH levels, so less nutrient absorption is the precursor to dullor dry skin and lifeless hair.Our ancestors naturally ate an abundance of fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds.Their diets were also high in organic mineral compounds, especially magnesium,calcium, and potassium. These are all alkalizing foods. But because of thewidespread availability of many less healthy foods today, both the types andportion sizes of what we consume have become dangerously imbalanced.Just by shifting your overall diet to consist of 80 percent alkalizing foods,you might be able to correct energy and beauty issues that have plagued you foryears. This shift in your overall way of eating can provide these benefits:• Circulate more healing oxygen in your body• Increase nutrient absorption• Shift from sallow to radiant skin• Transition from limp to thick hair• Create boundless energySome foods, such as quinoa and almonds, are slightly alkalizing or acid forming(depending on various factors such as whether or not they’ve been soaked), butthey are not highly acid forming like other foods, so even in their most acidicform it’s okay to include them in the 80 percent. It’s important that the bulkof your diet be made of the most alkalizing foods, namely fruits and veggies.The other 20 percent of your diet can be made up of acid-forming foods.Unfortunately, the typical Western diet is largely acidogenic, meaning it has anoverall acidifying effect on the body that promotes chronic acidosis and resultsin the loss of minerals in the body, which are used to buffer against metabolicacids.Remember that your body has complex mechanisms for maintaining the correctacid/alkaline balance. We are talking about potential imbalances that diet maybe able to correct—you alone are the judge of the benefits you see when movingtoward a more alkaline diet. If you stick to about 20 percent (or less)acid-forming foods, the acids will be balanced by the alkaline foods in yourdiet. So the great news is that you don’t have to feel pressured to eat“perfectly”; you can still allow for some of these foods in your diet. Theproblems occur when the ratio creeps out of balance, and more than 20 percent ofyour food is highly acid forming. This is unfortunately the case for mostWesterners or anyone consuming a modern Western diet. Just look around. Chronicfatigue, a “tired” face, poor skin quality, and cloudy eyes all indicate that aperson’s body is overly acidic.Once you know which foods are alkaline and which are acidic, it’s easier thanyou may think to implement this ratio (see some sample meal plans in Pillar 5[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_c16_r1.xhtml#ind877a]). Remember, this doesn’t meanthat you can never eat any acidic foods again or that you have to become a veganif you don’t want to at this time. However, animal protein is by nature highlyacidic, so if and when you choose to eat it, make sure it’s a smaller portionsize compared with the alkaline fruits and veggies on your plate.Strive to apply this important Radical Beauty ratio in a broad sense to eachplate of food you eat, and to your overall daily and weekly food consumption.Also try to avoid eating any meals or snacks that are composed of 100 percentacid-forming foods; seek balance every time you eat. It’s not quite as effectivefor balancing your pH if some of your meals are very alkaline and others arecompletely acidic. For instance, a few eggs on their own are a very acid-formingmeal that has a very different impact on your entire system than one egg on topof a big green salad. If there are at least some alkaline-forming foods presenteach time you eat, your body will be able to more efficiently buffer the acidsthat are produced as your meals are digested and metabolized. This can preventfurther acidity and help your body expel any acidic toxins that have alreadyaccumulated.Eighty percent of the foods you consume should be of varying levels ofalkalinity, emphasizing foods from this list:• Green vegetables• Root vegetables (winter squash, yams, turnips, sweet potatoes, etc.)• All other veggies• Fruit• Gluten-free grains (quinoa, brown rice, and steel-cut oats from a gluten-freefacility are great options), soaked overnight (These options are slightly moreacidic than others on this list, but compared with the very acidic foods listedbelow, they are great grounding, filling options.)• Herbs (parsley, cilantro, basil, etc.)• Sprouts• Raw apple-cider vinegar• Seeds (especially chia)• Nuts, especially almonds and walnuts (ideally soaked overnight)• Ginger, turmeric, and other roots that can act as spices in food• Legumes, such as lentils (in moderation and ideally soaked overnight)• Spices (paprika, cumin, etc.)Twenty percent (or less) of the foods you consume should come from these highlyacid-forming sources:• Red meat• Poultry• Fish• Dairy (in all forms, including yogurt)• Eggs• Coffee• Alcohol (minimize as much as possible)• Processed foods (minimize as much as possible); this includes anythingpackaged, from protein bars to chips. You can occasionally enjoy such foods, butremember that they do fall in the 20 percent group. Of course, junk foods likecandy bars and Twinkies should be avoided altogether (see our no-no list below).An easy way to work toward this balance is to ensure that most of your grocerycart is filled with whole foods, mostly from the outer edges of the grocerystore, or the bulk bins, or whole plant foods from the farmer’s market. Wholefoods are largely more alkaline by definition than ones that have been processedand made into commercialized products.RADICAL BEAUTY NO-NOSThe following items are too acid forming and damaging to your beauty to everconsume. If you currently eat any of these items, try to wean yourself off them,go cold turkey, or do whatever you have to do to get these items completely outof your diet for the sake of your beauty and health!ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERSMan-made, synthetic, toxic, and acid forming, these can lead to neurotoxiceffects in your brain and cause headaches, dizziness, and more problems. Theterm excitotoxicity means that such products have the ability to literallyexcite cells to death16 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c03-nts16] andeven encourage the production of free radicals that create tissue and organdamage—including skin that ages faster.All artificial sweeteners should be avoided, as well as any products thatcontain them. This includes aspartame (found in NutraSweet and Equal), sucralose(found in Splenda), and saccharin (in Sweet’N Low). If you want a low glycemicsweetener with no calories, try stevia or erythritol. Though they undergoprocessing, for sure, they are at least derived from plants and are notassociated with the toxic side effects associated with the aforementionedartificial sweeteners.SODAS AND SOFT DRINKSSodas of any kind should be avoided, including diet varieties that include toxicartificial sweeteners.REFINED SUGAR AND WHITE FLOURThese probably should be eliminated from your diet, at first on an experimentalbasis if you have symptoms that could be traced to acid/alkaline imbalance.Americans consume vast quantities of refined sugar and grains, so making areasonable restriction is sensible for everyone. Kimberly feels strongly that abroad range of common conditions—inflammation, weight gain, and low energy—isthe curse of these beauty-busting white powders.JUNK FOODS AND PROCESSED SNACKSReduce these as much as possible, relegating them to isolated treats from timeto time. Hey, nobody’s perfect, but junky items shouldn’t be staples in yourcupboard.CANNED PRODUCTSCanned goods often contain artificial preservatives and high levels of salt andsodium. In addition, the canning process destroys valuable nutrients found infresh produce. It’s best to go fresh. Some health advocates are wary ofchemicals in the metal lining of cans that can leach into food. Get precookedbeans in cartons instead of cans, or cook larger portions of fresh and freezeextras. Canned vegetables should be strictly avoided! If you are in a real pinchand can’t source fresh vegetables, frozen vegetables would be the next bestoption.COMMERCIAL SPORTS DRINKSThese contain beauty-depleting ingredients such as artificial food coloring,high fructose corn syrup, brominated vegetable oil, and artificial sweeteners.See, the list isn’t so long, is it? Most foods, even those that are less thanideal, can be absorbed into the 20 percent part of the overall ratio. Evenalcohol, if you enjoy drinks from time to time, can be part of that 20 percent(of course, a small part!). It’s not the best thing to put into your body,clearly, but Radical Beauty embodies a realistic plan that can be incorporatedinto your lifestyle.RADICAL BEAUTY RATIO #3: MACRONUTRIENT BALANCEThere are three macronutrients, the main elements that make up any given food:fat, carbohydrates, and protein. Historically, we’ve seen dietary philosophiescast one of these macronutrients as the evil root of weight gain, only to haveit rage and then fade away. But it doesn’t really make sense that one of themain components in food is inherently flawed and worthy of complete rejection.Eliminating any of these macronutrients from your diet and overemphasizing theother two creates an inevitable imbalance in your body, and natural balance isour primary goal here.Balance is a key facet in nature creating optimal beauty. Imbalance in any formis a surefire way to diminish beauty.If you track diet fads back to the 1980s, you will find a period when fat wasaggressively pinned as the singular cause of weight gain. The widespreadmentality at the time emphasized shunning all forms of fat as a way to loseweight and support health. Unfortunately, this campaign led to theoverconsumption of carbohydrates, including refined carbohydrates like slicedbread, packaged crackers and snacks, and nasty, fat-free super-processed cheesevarieties. A label of “fat-free” or “low-fat” was pretty much the gold standardfor weight loss back then. Unfortunately, people’s weights continued to rise,the aging phenomenon of inflammation grew overall, and sicknesses like heartdisease and diabetes continued to soar rather than diminish.A few decades later, we now look back in hindsight and see how demonizing theentire macronutrient of fat has led to disastrous health and beautyconsequences. It’s clear that a greater understanding of good fats versus badfats is necessary to determine how to incorporate the appropriate amount of theright fats into your diet to create beauty balance.What we are seeing today is the same staunch shunning of another macronutrient,except now the “bad one” is carbohydrates. Carbs are now often regarded as aweight loss foe as many people choose a high protein / low carb diet withoutfully understanding the ramifications. But avoiding carbohydrates in all itsforms can also tip you out of balance and push you to eat too much protein andfat. This makes your body more acidic, which can accelerate aging and depleteyour beauty. The answer is to balance all three macronutrients within your dietinstead of eliminating any one of them, and to adhere to proper ratios betweeneach macronutrient and the specific forms of each one.FATAs discussed on this page [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_c03_r1.xhtml#page51], eatingsome fat is essential for beauty and health, but you don’t need too much of it.Although fat should not be demonized as it was in the 1980s, the typicalAmerican diet still includes far too much fat—and the wrong kinds. If you lookat some of the people around the world with the best health and longest lives,you’ll see that many of them favor plant foods with lower fat and proteinconsumption. This is true of most traditional diets in Asia as well as the dietsof the Hunzas from Pakistan, the Okinawans from Japan,17[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c03-nts17] and the Vilcabamba peoplesfrom Ecuador.The source of fat in your diet is extremely important. You should get most ofyour beauty fat from whole plant forms, such as nutrient-dense seeds, nuts, andavocados. Coconut oil is great to cook with in small amounts, and natural oilslike olive oil can be used in small quantities on already prepared foods or rawfoods like salads (if you do want to cook with a little olive oil, stick tolower temperatures). Avoid congestive fats, such as trans fats in margarine andother prepared products, vegetable oils (especially in a cooked form as alreadynoted), and excessive animal fats. Even lean cuts of animal protein can haveupward of 50 percent of their calories coming from fat. Consider that the USDepartment of Agriculture defines lean ground beef, for instance, as containingno more than 10 percent fat, but this refers to product weight, not thepercentage of calories from fat.To get out of a strict numbers-based mentality, think visually: a whole avocado,a tablespoon or two of chia or flaxseeds, and a bit of coconut oil used whencooking your dinner are great ways you can get your daily fat in. As aguideline, 15 to 30 percent of your diet should come from healthy fats. Thismight sound broad, but this is where some individual customization based on yourconstitution comes into play.In Ayurveda, different body types are categorized into what your main dosha typeis: Kapha, Vata, or Pitta. If you are Vata, for instance, and tend to be morethin and willowy, you might do better with a higher ratio of fats in your diet.If you have a stocky Kapha-based frame and tend to put on weight more easily,you might feel more balanced and be better able to manage your weight at thelower end of this ratio. Pitta types, which have a medium, well-built, andstrong frame, are advised to avoid oily and fried foods, as oil is believed tocontribute to the naturally fiery nature of Pittas, and to consume moderatelevels of fat overall.Whether you subscribe to the dosha theory or not, you can still intuit your bodytype and what works best for you. Listen to your body, notice how you feel,experiment with different levels of healthy fat (primarily from all whole-food,plant-based sources), and determine the best specific ratio for you.CARBOHYDRATESCarbohydrates provide energy for your muscles, brain, and central nervoussystem. In fact, the human brain depends exclusively on carbohydrates for itsenergy. If you feel you are in a brain fog or easily become irritated or testy(let’s be honest!), it might be because you aren’t eating enough of the rightform of carbohydrates. Read on.HIGH FRUCTOSE VS. CRYSTALLINE FRUCTOSEThankfully, the media has caught on to the fact that high fructose corn syrup,the main ingredient in most soft drinks around the world, is a big health andbeauty no-no (not that its consumption has been curtailed much by the badpress). This is a highly processed liquid that puts a big burden on your liver18[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c03-nts18] and metabolizes to fat veryquickly. The fact that it is liquid and absorbed virtually instantly into yourbody only magnifies its harmful qualities. Sure, a small amount of fructoseoccurs naturally in fruits and vegetables, but these whole foods are vitalsources of beauty fiber and nutrients, and they don’t provide enough fructose tocause concern, as noted by Diabetes Care.19[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c03-nts19]But what about crystalline fructose? It has a sort of mysterious name thathasn’t been demonized in the public—at least not yet. But if you start to pokearound, you will see it listed as an ingredient in popular “health drinks,” suchas various flavored waters and certain sports drinks. What’s scary is thatcrystalline fructose contains an even higher percentage of fructose than highfructose corn syrup. That’s right, higher. High fructose corn syrup (HFCS) ismade from cornstarch (read: cheap to manufacture), which consists entirely ofglucose. After the starch is extracted, it goes through processing with enzymesthat convert some of the glucose into fructose. Depending on the exactprocessing mechanisms, HFCS can contain 42, 55, or up to 90 percent fructose.Additional processing crystallizes the syrup, and upon drying youhave—voilà!—crystalline fructose at a shocking 99 to 100 percent pure fructose.Of course this is great for food manufacturers, as a nearly pure-fructosesweetener is up to 20 percent sweeter than sucrose,20[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c03-nts20] meaning they can save money onsweeteners. If you happen to pick up a packaged food or beverage that includescrystalline fructose on its ingredient list, put it right back down.Research has found that eating carbohydrates increases serotonin release.21[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c03-nts21] As you probably know,serotonin elevates your mood, helps you feel balanced, and regulates yourappetite, especially in terms of helping you feel satiated. Normal serotoninlevels are also important for regular, healthy sleep patterns.22[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c03-nts22] This may explain why someonewho drastically cuts carbs from their diet gets really grumpy or moody.Emotional imbalance can often be a serious hint of a dietary imbalance.Let’s go back to ancient teachings for a moment: Traditional Chinese Medicineand Ayurveda both recommend carbohydrate consumption for nourishment by way ofgrains, root vegetables, and seasonal fruit, which are all prized in bothsystems for their healing, balancing, and health-elevating properties. Accordingto Ayurveda, a high protein diet without grains will create a “doshic” imbalanceand increase Pitta. A Pitta imbalance can manifest in “excess fire,” which canexhibit personality-wise as irritability, grumpiness, impatience, andanger—qualities not conducive to beauty and peace. If you try to eatsuper-low-carb, you may find your sweet cravings getting out of control as yourbody naturally seeks the carbohydrates we were designed to consume.When people try to restrict carbohydrates to lose weight, they break down fatincompletely, producing a by-product called ketones. The buildup of ketones cancause an imbalance that leads to excessive acid production,23[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c03-nts23] which can lead to acidosis inyour body. Diets that are excessively low in carbohydrates can help you loseweight, at least temporarily, but can also lead to fatigue, dehydration,constipation, and bad breath.There are basically three types of carbohydrates, and they are certainly notequal when it comes to their impact on your beauty.1. SIMPLE AND REFINED CARBOHYDRATESThese carbohydrates are broken down very quickly in your system and can create asurge in blood sugar levels and insulin release. A major intake of refinedcarbohydrates, which is epidemic in modern America, can lead to chronicinflammation,24 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c03-nts24] and suchinflammation produces enzymes that break down collagen and elastin, which cancreate or exacerbate wrinkles, contribute to sagging skin, and severely age yourskin.25 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c03-nts25] Excessive sugar canalso lead to the overgrowth of “bad” bacteria in your mouth and intestinaltract, providing a potential breeding ground for a candida imbalance, forexample, that contributes to acne, bloating, and constipation.The sugar you add to your coffee or bake into brownies with your kids isn’t theonly simple carbohydrate you may be overeating. That breakfast bagel you grabbedduring a conference room meeting, the English muffin you toasted up forbreakfast, and those saltine crackers lurking in your cupboard are all plentifulsources of simple carbs, too. Maybe you’ve heard this before, but white flourconverts pretty much directly into blood sugar, so try to think of the two asone and the same. Imagine a sugar cube dissolving into a cup of coffee. Italmost immediately melts and becomes invisible. It’s the same way with whiteflour. It looks like a different form, but upon consumption it melts right downinto blood sugar.These are the type of carbs you want to avoid, or at the very least minimize inyour diet:• White sugar• Refined white flour and related products, including cereals, cakes, bagels,cookies, crackers, and so on (There are countless products that could fit intothis one category, if you tally up all the products in the middle of the averagegrocery store. Just avoid those snack- and processed-food aisles and you canlargely avoid most of these.)• Jam and jellies• Sodas and soft drinks• Straight fruit juice (especially if pasteurized, which damages some nutrients)2. COMPLEX CARBOHYDRATES (AKA STARCHES)These carbohydrates are more structurally complex and take longer to get brokendown and digested by your body. As they enter the bloodstream more slowly and donot trigger a dramatic spike in insulin levels, they have a stabilizing effecton your body and provide sustained energy. Many of the benefits found invegetarianism and whole food diets come from eating complex carbohydrates,because nature has “packaged” them in balance with fiber, vitamins, and mineralsin a way that’s the most healthful for digestion and assimilation.Below are some good sources of complex carbs to incorporate into your diet. Donot be scared to eat from this group of foods! They will help you feel good anddigest your food well, and they are energizing and filling. They also contain alot of minerals and other beauty nutrients. You can balance complex carb portionsizes by loading up on salads and nonstarch veggies alongside them, but thefollowing are important energy and beauty foods with many different beautifyingand health benefits:• Starchy vegetables: tubers such as sweet potatoes, yams, winter squashes ofall kinds, pumpkins• Beans and legumes (soaked overnight)• Whole, unrefined, and gluten-free grains such as brown rice, millet, buckwheat(handled in a gluten-free facility), oats and quinoa (As discussed previously,gluten can be difficult to digest for many.)WHAT ABOUT FRUIT?Whole fruits contain a mixture of complex and simple carbohydrates. Fruit is oneof the most beautifying foods of all, a crowning glory of nature. Clearly notrefined or processed but grown on trees, fruit comes to us in a completenutritional package of vitamins, antioxidants, minerals, fiber, and so muchmore. If you eat fruit in its whole form, the natural fiber in the fruit helpsto slow down the digestion of the sugar.It would be a huge beauty mistake to completely avoid fruit for fear of itssugar. It’s grown in nature, and a fundamental Radical Beauty belief is that ifyou align yourself with and eat closer to nature, you will experience more ofyour natural beauty. Information on the Harvard Health Publications sitereferences the work by Robert H. Lustig, an obesity specialist at the Universityof California, San Francisco. Lustig asserts that the fructose that occurs insmaller quantities naturally in fruits is not harmful, because one also gets thefiber from the fruit, which “affects the biochemical outcome.”26[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c03-nts26]As you work on balancing your diet, you will find that you crave fewer junky andrefined sugars and foods. The fruit you eat will largely replace those foods andsatisfy your natural cravings for sweets. The high amounts of vitamin C,antioxidants, and countless other phytonutrients in the fruit (many of whichhaven’t even been identified yet) outweigh its sugar.Some say that all sugar is the same in the body, but that is not true if youlook at it from the holistic perspective of the overall impact of a given foodyou eat. Fruit has so many fantastic beauty benefits; you can’t just take thereductionist approach and compare it to table sugar. It’s best to eat fruitalone and on an empty stomach to help it digest completely and easily. This alsotends to reduce bloating.If you have blood sugar issues (such as diabetes) or a candida imbalance issue,then you need to lay off fruit, with the possible exception (if permitted byyour doctor) of non-sweet fruits, such as lemons and cucumbers, and sour fruits,such as cranberries and green apples (which are low in sugar), until you worktoward a healthier balance. But a healthy body will be better able to handlenatural foods, which very much include the peak of nature’s beauty, the fruit.3. FIBERThese indigestible carbohydrates are not broken down finely enough for your bodyto absorb them, and therefore are not a source of energy or calories. But fiber,as we discussed on this page [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_c02_r1.xhtml#page35]–thispage [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_c02_r1.xhtml#page36], is still important to yourdaily diet, as it lets you feel full and satisfied, helps you to sustain energy,and has stabilizing effects. Besides, fiber from veggies and fruit, greensmoothies and oatmeal, for example, is extremely important for beauty because ofits ability to help sweep out toxins. It’s an amazing natural cleanser thatforces wastes and toxins to keep moving along so that your true beauty can shinethrough.FINDING THE BALANCESo how many carbohydrates should you eat? Balance it out. As a general ratio, 50to 70 percent of your diet can be made up from beauty carbohydrates, whichinclude complex carbohydrates, vegetables, legumes (including beans, chickpeas,and lentils), and fruits. As with fat, customize this percentage to the rightamount for your body. Refined carbs don’t have a place in this ratio. As withfat, experiment and see what works best for you and your body type andconstitution. Eat unlimited veggies, especially green veggies, throughout theday. You can have them in salads, green smoothies, steamed, or lightly sautéed.Starchy root vegetables also digest well and can be paired with greens and othernonstarchy veggies. Beans and grains don’t have to be everyday foods (althoughsome cultures and people do great consuming them on a daily basis), but they canbe worked into your weekly rotation a few times a week at around one cup(cooked) or more, depending on your constitution, activity levels, and how youdeal with digesting certain foods. Pay attention to your own body’s needs andhow you feel. Your body is unique to you.PROTEINProtein is made of amino acids, the building blocks of every cell. Amino acidsare found in all natural foods in varying amounts, from romaine lettuce to kaleto almonds. Amino acids are like alphabet blocks; they can be combined fromsmaller units into whole proteins, like letters being combined to form wholewords. Therefore, a totally vegetarian or vegan diet, by combining amino acidgroups, can achieve the full complement of proteins needed for health andbeauty.Because protein isn’t used for energy by the body, we need much less of it thanpeople believe when they consume steaks and burgers. Only a few ounces arereally needed; there isn’t much protein deficiency today in developed societiesexcept among the very poor and malnourished. If your diet contains enoughcalories, it will be virtually impossible not to get enough protein, evenwithout trying. The old belief that vegetarianism was dangerous because ofprotein deficiency was never true. There are no innate drawbacks to aplant-based diet.The most complete protein source in the vegetable kingdom is soy, and fordecades soy burgers, tofu, and soy-based supplements and bars were a mainstay ofvegetarian diets, not to mention traditional regular diets in China and Japan.But current research casts doubt on consuming excessive amounts of soy as amajor part of our diet, with the risk of genetically modified soy andinflammation being the most recent concerns (but as mentioned on this page[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_c02_r1.xhtml#page31], organic forms of fermented soy,such as tempeh, natto, and miso, are easier-to-digest options that can be workedinto your diet in moderation if you don’t have a soy allergy). But virtually allfoods contain varying levels of protein, and you can get a hefty amount on aplant-based diet. For instance, a cup of cooked lentils has around 18 grams ofprotein, and a cup of cooked spinach has around 5 grams of plant protein.Brussels sprouts, mushrooms—you name it—all whole foods contain protein-buildingamino acids that are easily assimilated into your body. (Long before amino acidcombining became scientific, traditional diets delivered complete proteins byserving grains and legumes together, the classic combination of rice and beansor rice and lentils that is still the staple for billions of people around theworld.)WHAT ABOUT THE PALEOLITHIC (CAVE MAN) DIET?One of the newer iterations of the high protein / low carb diet is the so-calledPaleo diet, which was first outlined by Loren Cordain, an exercise physiologyprofessor at Colorado State University. The views of this plan are founded onthe extremely hypothetical habits of the Paleolithic (Stone Age) people andmodern-day hunter-gatherers, which he suggested could be studied to makeassumptions about the dietary habits of those in Paleo times.27[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c03-nts27] But as pointed out by T. ColinCampbell, PhD, in his book The Low-Carb Fraud, Cordain “confesses in severalplaces in his research papers28[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c03-nts28] that estimates of dietaryintakes in both of these groups are ‘subjective in nature’ ” and furthermore“acknowledges that ‘scores’ attempting to rate these presumed intakes from avery large compendium of 862 of the world’s societies are ‘not precise.’ ”29[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c03-nts29] Cordain notes that the true“hunter-gatherer way of life,” devoid of Western influence, is “now probablyextinct.”30 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c03-nts30]Historically, anthropologists reached a consensus that only about 33 percent ofthe foods consumed by hunter-gatherer societies were animal based.31[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c03-nts31] But in 2000, Cordain added alarger number of societies and changed some of the definitions, leading to amuch higher estimate that about 66 to 75 percent of these “Paleo” diets weremade up of animal foods.32 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c03-nts32]Scientific literature and anthropologists have challenged Cordain’s conjectures,including anthropologist Katharine Milton, who asserts that Cordain’s assumptionthat modern hunter-gatherers are representative of Paleolithic hunter-gatherersis a stretch.33 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c03-nts33]Plant foods leave little or no traces in archaeological remains, making it hardto accurately assess ancient dietary habits, if we did want to use that as aguide for our modern-day diet. But we can see with certainty that we share avery similar gut anatomy (simple acid stomach, a small cecum, a small intestine,and a distinctly sacculated colon), as well as a lack of anatomical tools (sharpfangs, claws) to kill and eat larger animals, with our nearest geneticrelatives, chimpanzees. Looking at their natural diet reveals that chimpanzeesare largely plant eaters, and may only get upward of 4 to 6 percent of theirdiet from animal-based foods in the form of ants and termites.34[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c03-nts34]Assumptions and highly conjectural “evidence” from ancient history should not beused to assert the guidelines of eating such a high protein and high fat diettoday (30 to 50 percent of each). Superior research directly refutes the highlevels of protein and fat pushed by high protein diets such as the Paleo. Forinstance, it has been widely established that when diet and disease correlationsfor different populations are compared, diets like Paleo that are rich in fatand animal protein correlate strongly with higher rates of heart disease andbreast, colon, and prostate cancer,35[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c03-nts35] to name only a few majorhealth conditions. Eating a largely (or all) plant-based diet that is lower inanimal protein has been shown to prevent and even reverse such serious illnessesas certain cancers,36 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c03-nts36],37[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c03-nts37] heart disease,38[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c03-nts38] and diabetes.39[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c03-nts39] And that is truly a beautifulthing.So far, protein is the one macronutrient that has never been demonized inmainstream diets, though you will find evidence against overconsumption ofprotein in movements instigated by the China Study and other research. The ChinaStudy was headed by Dr. T. Colin Campbell, professor emeritus in the Division ofNutritional Sciences at Cornell University, and was funded by such prestigiousorganizations as the National Institutes of Health, the American Cancer Society,and the American Institute for Cancer Research. It found strong evidence of thediet’s role in cancer growth and a correlation between high protein intake andcancer growth.40 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c03-nts40]Unfortunately, what we see today, especially in modern Westernized societies andin big cities in many parts of the world, is a huge overconsumption of protein.This is the result of both larger portion sizes and more frequent consumption ofanimal proteins, which is a dangerous shift. Studies in Tunisia,41[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c03-nts41] Beijing,42[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c03-nts42] and Sweden43[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c03-nts43] have shown that as traditionaldiets rich in plant foods started shifting to incorporate more animal foods,there has been a rise in heart attacks and cardiovascular-related deaths.Remember that our cardiovascular system is one of our circulatory systems, andoptimal circulation is a key contributor to health as well as your highestbeauty. A recent study found that those who ate high protein diets were 75percent more likely to die from any cause,44[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c03-nts44] and the recommendationsarising from the study, namely to reduce animal proteins and consume more plantfoods, were in keeping with the protein consumption recommendations from theWorld Health Organization and the Institute of Medicine.Excessive protein puts a heavy burden on digestion, as digesting protein isenergy exhaustive and requires a great deal of enzymes. It is especially taxingon your liver and kidneys, which have a limited capacity to expel uric acid.This leads to an increased possibility of an accumulation of uric acid in thebody. High protein foods are also high in purines, which are broken down intouric acid.Elevated levels of uric acid in the bloodstream may lead to needlelike uric acidcrystals in joints, with gout as the painful outcome. In addition, kidney stonesare more likely to form in someone on a high protein diet. Because diets thatare excessively high in protein are acid forming after the protein ismetabolized, they can lead to loss of calcium, as it is leached out of yourbones and excreted through your body by urinary calcium excretion. Eating suchhigh levels of protein, which is dense in various fats and cholesterol and takesa lot of energy to break down, also increases the risk of circulatory issues,which can hamper beauty. The percentage of protein in your diet should rangefrom 10 to 20 percent. Again, you may have been trained to believe that you needmore, but experiment with your own body and try staying within this range,noticing how your energy and beauty blossom. And later on, in Pillar 5[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_p05_r1.xhtml], Beautiful Movement (this page[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_c16_r1.xhtml#div7]), we will discuss in much moredetail the specific protein needs to optimize your workouts and develop muscletone.Your body recycles proteins, meaning that you don’t have to ingest completeproteins at every meal.45 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c03-nts45] Byvirtue of getting enough calories and eating a wide variety of nutrient-densewhole foods, you will get enough protein. Remember, the goal here is balance.You can enjoy some animal protein if you choose, but try to have moreplant-based meals, which will provide you with plenty of protein but with lessof a digestive burden and fewer by-products. Make it your goal to limit animalprotein to a few times a week or, at the most, once a day to achieve RadicalBeauty. Let your beauty shine forth with lots of nourishing, beautifyingplant-based meals and foods. Here are some great plant-based sources of protein:• Spirulina• Hemp seeds and hemp protein powders• Chia, sunflower, and other seeds• Almonds and other nuts• Green veggies (These have a surprising amount of protein, so keep having yourGlowing Green Smoothie; see recipe on this page[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_c02_r1.xhtml#page27].)• Lentils and beans, soaked overnight for better digestion• Quinoa, millet, teff, and other gluten-free grains• Tempeh (a fermented, easier-to-digest form of tofu, which can be sourcedorganic and plain, and is relatively free from additives, unlike fake meatproducts that mock a type of animal food)• Mushrooms, Brussels sprouts, and other whole veggies• Vegan protein powdersSTEAK VS. CIGARETTESWe are well aware that millions of people are attracted to popular high protein/ high-fat diets, especially the Atkins diet, which advocates weight lossthrough the total elimination of all sugar and carbohydrate foods and a relianceon butter, cheese, eggs, poultry, meat, and fish. Paleo is a newer high proteiniteration, albeit without dairy. While the human body can adapt to the specialprocess (known as ketosis) that turns protein and fat into blood sugar, the baldfact is that our ancestors didn’t evolve on such an extreme diet. Compared withus, they actually ate more nuts, fruits, berries, and vegetables than we do, andalways in a whole, ripe form. It’s remarkable that the human body can get itsneeded blood sugar (glucose) the fast, normal way, by eating natural sugars andcarbohydrates, which quickly break down into glucose, or the roundabout way, byusing extra calories to break down fats and proteins, the macronutrients thatnormally are stored and employed for cell building.The roundabout way, or ketosis, leads to weight loss thanks to the extracalories it burns, but there are no holistic studies that tell us the overallhealth effect of such a diet when practiced for years at a time by adults whomight have all kinds of potential disease risks. Furthermore, as mentionedpreviously, the buildup of ketones can cause an imbalance that leads toexcessive acid production,46 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c03-nts46]which can bring about acidosis in your body and quicken aging.No extreme diet, especially one that excludes an entire macronutrient, is partof Radical Beauty. While these diets may be effective in helping you loseweight, at least in the short-term, the overall effect of eating steak is todeposit toxins from the meat itself—especially if it was raised under currentartificial, antibiotic-laced, hormone-enhanced conditions—as well as acidicmetabolic by-products into your body. This isn’t the direction you want yourbody, or your diet, to go in.The way you cook your meat can make it even more toxic. Grilling and barbecuinginvolve converting (burning) animal fats into worrisome chemical residues. Theamount of benzo[a]pyrene, a cancer-stimulating agent, in barbecued meat has beenpinpointed in studies to be around 4 nanograms (ng) per gram (g),47[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c03-nts47] while the content of thebenzo[a]pyrene of cigarettes is estimated to be between 4 and 30 ng per gram.48[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c03-nts48] In restaurants, the averagesteak size is 8 ounces (250 g). This means that eating a steak could be thecarcinogenic equivalent of smoking 33 to 250 cigarettes (depending on the exactcigarette).Research reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences showsthat advanced glycation end products, or AGEs (what a fitting acronym!), occurnaturally in our body in low levels but are present in high levels in heatedanimal products, such as grilled or broiled meats.49[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c03-nts49] Such AGEs can cause damage toyour brain50 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c03-nts50] and destroy yourcollagen and elastin, which is needed to help keep your skin spongy andresilient. When your skin is damaged due to AGEs, it ages and wrinkles faster.Think of a Thanksgiving turkey after it’s been broiled for a while in the oven.It’s withered to a crisp, which is obviously not the kind of skin you’d like tohave.A study in the journal Cell Metabolism found that a person with highanimal-protein consumption (over 20 percent of calories coming from meat) isfour times more likely to die from cancer, which is a similar rate as cigarettesmoking.51 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c03-nts51] The same studyfound that high protein consumption led to an increased risk of diabetes andoverall mortality, and that proteins derived from plant foods were associatedwith lower mortality levels than animal-derived proteins.52[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c03-nts52] A contributing factor might bethe heterocyclic amines (HCAs) that are produced during the cooking of meat,which might be carcinogenic,53 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c03-nts53]as well as the carcinogenic compounds nitrosamines, which are present inprocessed meats54 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c03-nts54] (yes, youread that right, carcinogenic compounds in foods you might find at your localdeli or market). Yet cooking meat at higher temperatures, even if the meat isorganic or nonpreserved, can still increase nitrosamine formation.55[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c03-nts55]You don’t have to become a vegan if you choose not to be at this time in orderto achieve Radical Beauty, but don’t overdo the red meat and steak either.Choose more beautifying, whole-food, plant-based meals. Limit red meat eating toonly occasionally—a few times a month at the very most—and choose organic meaton those occasions when you do want to eat it."},{"pageContent":"SHIFT 4:FEEL A CONNECTION TO YOUR FOODIt’s easy for all of us just to stuff food into our mouths, enjoy the temporarytaste, and not really think about what goes on after that. Out of sight, out ofmind, right? But this approach will not help you reach your goal of buildingyour Radical Beauty. In order to do that, you need to be able to connect withwhat you are eating and become conscious of how what you are eating makes youfeel, both in the short- and long-term.A good place to start is by connecting visually to what is taking place when youeat, beyond what you can see with your eyes. In other words, try visualizingwhat you know is taking place without literally seeing it and connecting that tothe experience in your body, which you cannot help but feel. Try this now. Thinkof your last food binge—maybe on a “cheat” day, while on vacation, or when outwith your friends. It can be any time you decided to just let loose and eat thatpizza or ice cream or french fries followed by a cupcake or donut. Maybe it wason that hungover Sunday when you dug into the third serving of macaroni andcheese that you knew you really shouldn’t have but were craving so badly (andyou felt so crappy you didn’t put up much of a defense). Imagine how theparticular foods you indulged in tasted, felt, and looked.Now try taking the visualization internally, imagining what is going on in yourstomach after you binged. Picture your stomach expanding outward, trying tocontend with the heavy digestive load you just burdened it with. Imagine achurning volcano. Now create the image of congestive toxicity and envision itbuilding up on the insides of your gut.Next, visualize inflammation striking your cells, causing friction anddisharmonious aggravation. Think about diminished circulation throughout yourbody, the growth of the toxins, nutrients passing through but not beingabsorbed, your cells suffering, and ultimately your skin getting duller andwrinkling like a raisin. Sit with that for a moment, and internalize theseimages and imagined feeling of your digestive distress. Compare these feelingsto the physical sensations you’ve felt in your body when indulging in a binge.The purpose of this exercise is not to make you feel horrible or to picturedisturbing images for no reason. It is to help foster a deeper mindfulness ofjust how much the food you are eating impacts your body, your energy, and yourbeauty.Now visualize eating something healthy. Imagine eating a delicious all-vegetableginger-squash soup, for example. The food feels warming as it goes in, and itfeels grounding and filling in your stomach, but you don’t feel overly stuffed.Think of this food going into your gut and various nutrients flowing into yourbloodstream and circulating all around your body in a clear, healthy stream.Your skin is radiant and glowing, and you finish eating feeling great.When you decide what to eat, it’s inevitable that sometimes you’ll make aless-than-ideal choice. This is perfectly fine. You are not meant to be perfect.But try to keep this imagery stored somewhere in your mind so the next time youare struggling with a food option on a menu or on the brink of going from alittle treat to a full binge, you can pull this imagery back into the forefrontof your mind. Hopefully this consciousness-building exercise (which can be donein as little as a few seconds) will pull you back to this side of whole,beauty-nourishing foods so that you can make the better choice more often.NOURISH YOURSELF AS NO ONE ELSE CANMost people feel healthier and more connected to their food and energy when theycook most of their meals themselves. It’s also great from a beauty perspective,because cooking your own meals puts you in control of the oils and otheringredients that you consume. You can be sure to use beauty-building organicproduce and cook with coconut oil, non-irradiated spices, and fresh herbs. Nomatter what you choose, you always know the source of your food when you cookfor yourself.This certainly does not have to be elaborate or take up copious amounts of time.Home-cooked meals can be simple, and it’s easy to rotate certain dishes you feelcomfortable with over and over again, mixing and matching different vegetablesand ingredients. Eating out can be social, celebratory, and a lot of fun, but itdoesn’t have to be your norm. Save it for special occasions, or at least try toshift into eating out less and having more meals at home, and you will feel moregrounded and empowered not only with your diet but perhaps your whole life.RADICAL BEAUTY HEALTHY COOKING TIME-SAVERSAt this point, you may be feeling really inspired by all this information abouthow to make big shifts in your life. There truly is so much you can do to eatyour way to a fuller expression of your natural beauty. And it’s understandablythrilling, but then a passing dark thought may cloud your excitement: how areyou actually going to have time to eat healthfully? You might feel as if youalready don’t have enough time to jam all your professional and personal dutiesinto your schedule, so how are you going to possibly add the further element ofeating for Radical Beauty into the mix?Don’t worry. You will not have to spend much more time preparing food to makethese dietary shifts, but you will have to be a little bit strategic and takesome time to plan ahead. Actually, the time you use to buy or make things inbulk and prep more at home instead of always running out to restaurants andtake-out joints may actually help you save more time overall. This is especiallytrue as you get more comfortable with simpler staple dishes and strategies.Here are some great time-saving tricks to get you on your way to eating forRadical Beauty.BAKE ROOT VEGETABLESAs soon as you get home from work, turn on the oven and throw some whole wintersquash or sweet potatoes on a pan. Yes, that’s right—whole! You can prick someslits in them with a knife, but don’t struggle with breaking down a super-toughraw squash; it simply takes too much energy. Throwing these rock-hard rootveggies into the oven whole is going to save you a lot of precious time that youwould otherwise spend trying to cut them up. Let them soften up while youchange, relax, and catch up with your spouse and your kids, or simply chill out.After 45 minutes or so, take them out of the oven, cube or slice them, andeither sauté them with a little coconut oil or let them bake a bit longer.Sprinkle them with simple seasonings like paprika, turmeric, and a pinch of seasalt, and eat them over a salad or with some other veggies or greens. Super easyand delicious. The key is to let your oven work for you while you are gettingyour post-work relaxation in.KEEP ORGANIC TEMPEH ON HANDThis is the equivalent of a fast-food health meal. It’s hearty, protein dense,and fermented so it tends to digest better than other soy products. Plus, thefermentation is believed to deactivate some of the potentially less-than-greatfeatures of soy products, including digestive difficulties. And the key feature:speed. Open up a package of tempeh, cut it into squares or strips, heat it up ina pan, and you’re good to go. Eat it either with some lightly cooked veggies,like zucchini or broccoli, or on top of a leafy, green salad. Play around withspices and flavorings. Tempeh goes well with everything from tamari to cayenneand paprika, cumin, or even marinara sauce. You can literally make this meal inless than 5 minutes!TRY AN EVENING SMOOTHIEIf you get home late and are exhausted, you can always make a simple smoothiefor dinner that’s loaded with beauty nutrition. It doesn’t get much easier thanthat, and if you have a Vitamix, cleanup only takes a few minutes. Eating lateat night, especially when you’re exhausted, isn’t great for digesting heavierfoods, anyway. Smoothies are great for these times because they are blended andeasy to digest. With the ingredients already broken down, it’s brilliantlysimple for your system to absorb the nutrition. You can bulk up a smoothie tomake it feel satisfying in the evening by using almond milk as the base. Othergreat smoothie ingredients to stock at home include bananas, coconut water,maca, spirulina, bee pollen, stevia, vanilla extract, sprouted plant-basedprotein powder, cinnamon, raw cacao, and acai.MAKE A ONE-POT MEALOne-pot cooking is popular in many parts of the world, and with good reason. Ifyou make a soup or a stew, you can throw everything into the pot (you can evenget your kids to help you!) and go do other things (change after a long day,help your kids with their homework, talk with a friend on the phone, and so on).Secondly, cooking this way instead of boiling ingredients and then throwing outthe water means that the liquid in your soup or stew will retain the nutritionof the foods. Make your own vegetable broth in big batches or buy an organicvariety from the market. When you get home or when you want an easy meal, heatthe vegetable broth on the stove and throw in various veggies, lentils, or evenbeans (from cartons if you are in a rush) for an easy, nutritious, andfamily-friendly meal. Try pureeing everything if you like a smoother soup. Youcan even add brown rice or quinoa to stews, and toast up some gluten-free orwhole-grain bread for extra-hungry kids and teenagers to dip into their stew.Invest in a large, good-quality soup pot, and it will be a great friend to youfor years to come.TURN YOUR FREEZER INTO YOUR LIFE RAFTWhen you do have time to cook, make extra and freeze portion sizes in bisphenolA (BPA)–free containers (a chemical believed to potentially cause hormonal,developmental, and brain issues, among other health concerns). You can freezeanything from gluten-free lasagna to soups, bananas, and even dark chocolate.(Sweet-tooth emergencies are still emergencies!) When you get busy, you can restassured that not only won’t you starve, you also won’t have to resort to TacoBell or the equivalent fast-and-easy but incredibly beauty-busting optionnearby. This is especially great if you have an erratic schedule that doesn’talways allow for regular grocery shopping. You can grab something to thaw out inthe morning before leaving for work, or stick the container in a pot of hotwater when you get home if you forgot. Either way, nutritious food that you madeyourself is on the way!BUY ITEMS IN BULKIf you can find a great local (and preferably organic) market with bins, try tobuy large amounts of quinoa, lentils, brown rice, steel-cut oats, and whateverother dried staples you love. Quinoa is a great one because it is mineral andnutrient dense, gluten-free, and cooks up in about 12 to 14 minutes. It’sperfect for quick meals. Having these dried staples around is great when you arebusy and don’t have time to go out and shop. It’s ideal to soak them overnightor at least during the day if you can throw them in water on the way to work.But, hey, if you forgot or are in a real time crunch and the choice is betweenunsoaked quinoa and takeout made with questionable oils and ingredients youaren’t completely sure of, the quinoa option is the clear winner.BE A STRATEGIC VEGGIE SHOPPERFood shopping can take up a lot of time. Not all of us can do daily vegetableshopping like some lucky locals in the South of France. If you can only gogrocery shopping once a week or so, be sure to get veggies that are heartier andcan last until the end of the week. Red/purple cabbage, onions, shallots,garlic, root vegetables such as yams and spaghetti squash, carrots, and radishesare great in this regard. Use up the more perishable veggies like broccoli orwatercress earlier in the week. By being strategic with your veggies’timetables, you should be able to enjoy a range of veggies over the week.MAKE BIGGER BATCHESIn addition to freezing spare portions of entrées, it’s also easier and moreconvenient to make large portion sizes of kale chips, zucchini hummus, andwashed and chopped veggies that you can chomp on and dip when you get hungry.Keep everything in airtight glass or BPA-free containers in your fridge andyou’ll have a ready supply of beautifying foods even when you’re exhausted orpressed for time.MAKE A MASTER GGSIf you are a Glowing Green Smoothie (this page[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_c02_r1.xhtml#page27]) drinker, try making a masterbatch on Sunday (or whatever day of the week is the easiest for you), keepingsome portions out for the next day or so, and freezing portion sizes that youcan thaw out later in the week. This is a great time-saver and ensures you arefollowing this all-important habit as much as possible.CHOOSING ORGANICChoosing organic food is also a choice for your beauty. Organic produce containssuperior nutrition—more beneficial vitamins, minerals, essential fatty acids,and antioxidants to nourish your beauty than conventional produce. Bydefinition, organic produce does not include genetically modified organisms(GMO) and is produced without the use of artificial pesticides, antibiotics,synthetic fertilizers, and hormones that can tax and age your body, cumulativelydestroying your beauty over time.Going organic is definitely worth the extra cost for your health and beauty’ssake. If budget is an issue, check out the latest list of the “Dirty Dozen” fromthe Environmental Working Group to determine which twelve produce items are themost important to buy organic. If you can put your budget toward organicversions of the crops that are sprayed most often with pesticides, you can avoida lot of pesticide contamination. Check out local farmer’s markets and talk tolocal sources, which may or may not have organic certifications but still useorganic farming practices.It’s especially important to buy organic meat, which we’ll discuss more in amoment. It’s important to know that the label free-range doesn’t necessarilymean organic or that the animals were fed a natural-food diet. Always look forthe term organic or organic and free-range on the label. According to theNational Organic Program under the United States Department of Agriculture(USDA), to be labeled organic meat, the animals must be raised on certifiedorganic land; fed organic feed without growth hormones, antibiotics, GM feed, oranimal by-products; and can’t be grown using persistent pesticides or chemicalfertilizers.1 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c04-nts1]Don’t be fooled by the generic word natural. Natural foods are not necessarilyorganic. They may contain some organic ingredients—or they may not. If you arebuying packaged products, look for the USDA certified organic seal, whichsignifies that a product contains at least 95 percent organically growningredients. You vote with your food choices! Choosing organic for the recipesin this book and in general will help increase the demand for organic. This willeventually help lower organic prices, support the environment, and build andsustain your precious beauty and health.REALITY CHECK: YOU EAT WHAT YOUR FOOD EATSThe fact that you ultimately ingest whatever the animals you eat ingest is anuncomfortable reality for many of us, but getting in touch with your food meansreally understanding what it is composed of and facing the good, the bad, andthe ugly. The harsh truth is that compounds in an animal’s diet bio-accumulate,meaning they become concentrated in the animal’s tissues2[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c04-nts2] and end up on your fork whetheryou’re eating a piece of roast chicken or digging into a steak. Upon closeexamination of what commercially raised animals are fed, this fact is not onlyuncomfortable, it’s frightening and downright ugly.First of all, if you eat factory-farmed animals, which means pretty much anyanimal product that isn’t labeled organic and grass-fed, you’re most likelyingesting genetically modified corn and soy along with that seemingly innocentgrilled chicken or hamburger at your weekend barbecue. The United Statescurrently provides subsidies to farmers who grow corn and soybeans, andcurrently around 90 percent of these crops in the United States are nowgenetically modified. Livestock producers choose to use corn and soy as thebasis of their animal feed not only because it’s cheaper but also because thesefoods help the animals gain weight faster.3[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c04-nts3]Genetically modified crops weren’t released until 1996 and started with soy,corn, and cotton (cottonseed oil is commonly used in products like saladdressings and mayonnaise) before spreading into other foods. There hasn’t beenenough time to assess the full health ramifications for humans, but research onthe effects of genetically modified organism (GMO) consumption in animals (witha much shorter life span than humans) has revealed frightening effects,including reproductive issues, liver and kidney toxicity, sperm damage, andinfant mortality.4 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c04-nts4],5[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c04-nts5] Researchers at Baylor Collegeof Medicine accidentally discovered that rats that were fed GMO corn materialhad reproductive issues, and tests on the feed revealed two compounds that“stopped the sexual cycle in females at concentrations approximatelytwo-hundredfold lower than classical phytoestrogens.”6[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c04-nts6] Both of these substances werealso found to contribute to the growth of breast and prostate cancer in cellcultures.7 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c04-nts7]GMO corn and soy crops rely heavily on pesticides and herbicides (such asRoundup, an herbicide produced by Monsanto that is designed to work with theirGMO crop seeds) that build up in animals’ tissues after being consumed, and themeat from these animals therefore contains these residues.8[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c04-nts8] Exposure to pesticides has beenshown to have a negative impact on reproductive, nervous, and immune systemfunctions and increases the risk of cancer.9[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c04-nts9]But wait, there’s more—much, much more.On a global scale, commercial animal feed is laced with a cornucopia of toxins,including mycotoxins, antibiotics, prion proteins, pesticides, heavy metals, andbacterial pathogens.10 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c04-nts10] Thesetoxins can cause a variety of problems, including reproductive dysfunction,bacterial infections, imbalanced gut flora, and reduced immunity. You obviouslywant to avoid consuming these toxins, but unfortunately that’s not alwayssimple. Comprehensive legislation is already in place to restrict several of thechemical compounds and pathogens in feed, but as we’ve seen from outbreaks ofcontaminated meat in the past, complete bacterial monitoring is impossible toenforce.Here is a breakdown of some of the most harmful toxins found in commercialanimal feed:Dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are industrial pollutants that maycontaminate feeds and have been detected in milk and dairy products inparticular. Dioxins are highly dangerous toxins that are linked to reproductive,developmental, and hormonal problems as well as cancer.11[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c04-nts11] According to the World HealthOrganization, “More than 90 percent of human exposure to dioxins is through thefood supply, mainly meat and dairy products, fish, and shellfish….Contaminatedanimal feed is often the root-cause of food contamination.”12[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c04-nts12]Mercury has been found to contaminate the fishmeal that is used to feed certainanimals.13 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c04-nts13] Mercury is a heavymetal that causes slow but steady damage in your body in a sneaky way. It causesyour cell membranes to become leaky, inhibits key enzymes your body needs forenergy production and toxin removal, and creates oxidation in your tissues.Oxidation is one of the main reasons you develop disease, as well as the primaryreason you age.Some feed studied revealed samples of bacterial E. coli (short for Escherichiacoli) variations (though not strain 0157:H7)14[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c04-nts14] as well as Salmonella entericabacteria.15 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c04-nts15] We have seen E.coli O157:H7 rear its ugly head from time to time in outbreaks, which haveunfortunately caused fatalities. Not only potentially deadly, it also can causebloody diarrhea, dehydration, and kidney failure. There have been numerous beefrecalls in recent history, including one of over 50,000 pounds of meat sold bythe National Beef Packing Company in 2013.16[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c04-nts16]There are consistent reports of worldwide feed contamination with fungi andtheir spores.17 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c04-nts17],18[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c04-nts18] Mycotoxins are secondarymetabolites of fungi that have the capacity to impair health19[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c04-nts19] and lead to a range ofillnesses and diseases. One German study found that 94 percent of feed samplesanalyzed were contaminated by two to six different Fusarium mycotoxins.20[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c04-nts20] Forms of the extremelydangerous toxin aflatoxin have also been identified in contaminated feed.21[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c04-nts21] This is of particularly graveconcern, as chronic aflatoxin exposure has been linked to cancer in humans.22[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c04-nts22]Another ugly ingredient in animal products is…well, other animals. These includemembers of the same species that have died in the factory farm. Some commercialfeed even includes meat and bonemeal, containing prion proteins. Thesecomponents of animal tissue have the capacity to transform into agents thatcause fatal neurological lesions in a wide range of species.23[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c04-nts23] Cows were not meant to eatother cows. Period.Then there are the copious amounts of antibiotics that are added to commercialanimal feed on purpose. Animal products are frequently contaminated withresidues from drugs that were purposely added to the feed to control disease andenhance livestock performance. In other words, they’re meant to keep the animalsalive and healthy enough to grow hefty before being slaughtered. Many of thedrugs added to animal feed are undeclared, and residues of these drugs can befound in the meat. One study that examined animal feed in Northern Irelandshowed that out of 247 medicated feeds, 35 percent contained undeclaredantimicrobials. Even worse, out of 161 “un-medicated” feeds, 44 percent werefound to contain antimicrobials. The contaminants most frequently identifiedincluded chlortetracycline, sulfonamides, penicillin, and ionophores.24[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c04-nts24] Yes, you read thatright—penicillin. Who knew you were eating one of the strongest antibioticsavailable with your Sunday morning bacon and eggs?Farms also use a range of antibiotics to get their chickens to market weightfaster, and low-dose-antibiotic use in animals has been linked to thedevelopment of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains. This can also wipe outyour gut flora—and your whole health, really.25[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c04-nts25] In 2011, the pharmaceuticalcompany Pfizer temporarily suspended use of the poultry drug Roxarsone after USFood and Drug Administration (FDA) reports showed that compounds in the drugcould break down into inorganic arsenic, a toxin that can produce skin lesions,respiratory irritation, and several types of cancer. Inorganic arsenic wasleaching into local water supplies and remaining in chicken tissue afterslaughter.26 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c04-nts26]The effects of chronic low-arsenic exposure are not well known, but studies haveindicated that even low-level exposure may contribute to endocrine and cognitivedeficits.27 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c04-nts27] Although use ofRoxarsone has been suspended, there are several other similar drugs being usedin animal production that have the possibility of exposing consumers to toxicforms of arsenic. Some have even hypothesized that arsenic can be linked to therise in autism rates.28 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c04-nts28]Clearly, there is nothing pretty about commercial meat. If and when you chooseto eat animal products, look for items that are organic, grass-fed, and free ofsteroids and hormones. Ideally, try to find someone who sells these products ata local farmer’s market and talk to him or her about how the animals are fed andtreated in general.THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF ANIMAL AGRICULTUREEating organic meat will still not solve the major detrimental environmentalissues of animal agriculture, which is the leading cause of deforestation, waterconsumption, and pollution; it is also responsible for more greenhouse gasesthan the transportation industry. Animal agriculture from producing meat,chicken, eggs, and fish is a primary driver of rainforest destruction, speciesextinction, habitat loss, topsoil erosion, ocean “dead zones,” and more.29[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c04-nts29] It’s shocking that this is notdiscussed more, but hopefully that will start to change.If we truly care about the environment, the most impactful thing we can do is tobe conscious of our food choices and the impact they have on the earth. Thechoice to give up meat, or to at least greatly reduce your consumption, willmake for a healthier and more beautiful you and a healthier and more beautifulplanet."},{"pageContent":"SHIFT 5:INCORPORATE TOP RADICAL BEAUTY FOODS AND ROUTINESRoutines and daily rhythms are stabilizing forces that have a balancing effecton your life. Routine in a dietary sense is important for establishing excellentdigestion and patterns. Having a structure makes it easier to maintain yourbeneficial eating habits. Such daily rhythms provide a sense of steadiness, likecounting on the sun to rise as we get up and start our day and to set everyevening as we settle toward rest. This steadiness creates an environment ofsafety for your mind, helping to reduce stress and anxiety. A more calm,peaceful mind manifests outwardly in a body that does not age as quickly and ismore naturally beautiful.Now that you have information about general shifts, here you’ll learn some veryspecific daily routines that will give you the most Radically Beautiful resultsto enhance your authentic expression. Here are some things to remember and somenew ideas as well.START THE DAY WITH HOT WATER WITH LEMONYou already know how great this is for your digestive system and liver and tosupport cleansing. Keep lemons stocked at home and make this a daily habit! Foreven more digestive benefits, especially if you live in a place with coldwinters, add some sliced ginger to this nourishing morning beverage.DRINK A GLOWING GREEN SMOOTHIE DAILYThis is a big component of Kimberly’s Beauty Detox program and is outlined ingreat detail in the Beauty Detox books. Smoothies are a really efficient way toget nutrients, and blending abundant amounts of beauty greens and fruit makes iteasy for you to digest and absorb all those minerals, vitamins, and antioxidantswhile loading up your system with fiber. Start making it part of your morningroutine (see recipe on this page [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_c02_r1.xhtml#page27])after you drink your hot water with lemon.TAKE AN EXCELLENT PROBIOTIC SUPPLEMENT EVERY DAYProbiotics support optimal digestion, leading to better nutrient absorption andmore efficient expulsion of waste. This is an incredibly important beautysupplement. See the authors’ websites for recommendations (deepakchopra. com[http://deepakchopra.com], kimberlysnyder. com [http://kimberlysnyder.com]).BECOME VEGGIE-CENTRICMake it part of your rhythm to include these key, fiber-filled components intoevery meal, whether a salad, some cooked or chopped greens, or greens topped onwhatever you are eating. No more meals of just bread and cold cuts or eggs andtoast. Get your veggies in at every meal for alkalizing balance.EAT SEEDS DAILYSprinkle some freshly ground flaxseeds onto your salads or have some soaked chiaseeds (in puddings, salad dressings, or smoothies) every day. You can also takean algae-based DHA and EPA supplement. This will ensure you’re getting theproper level of beautifying omega-3 fats for beautiful skin, a balanced mood,and a healthy heart.MAKE TURMERIC PART OF YOUR LIFEIf you are new to turmeric, it’s time to start befriending it. Pick up someorganic, powdered turmeric and add a bit to your evening tea, hot soups, veggiedishes, or blended into salad dressings (see the Creamy Masala Vegetable Stewrecipe on this page [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_app1_r1.xhtml#ind260a]).BREAK BEFORE MEALSTake time before lunch and dinner and pause to ask yourself what your body trulyneeds at that meal. At first it might be hard to listen to yourself. You mayfeel like you should just go for what you’ve normally eaten in the past, but asyou stay receptive and practice asking and listening to your body, you will beable to “hear” more intuitively from your body what you need, and you will feelmore satisfied after eating.EAT MORE SLOWLYTake time just to eat. Don’t eat while reading or writing e-mails or during aconference call. Treat eating as sacred for better beauty digestion. Even ifit’s just a few minutes, take the time for yourself.PRACTICE GRATITUDETake a moment for gratitude before each meal and even snack. Creating thatfeeling of gratitude puts your body and mind in a calmer, happier state, whichpaves the path for optimal digestion.SIP HOT HERBAL TEA IN THE EVENINGSThis is soothing, good for digestion, and signals to your mind that it’s time tostart preparing for sleep and rejuvenation. Tulsi (also known as holy basil) teais a particularly excellent choice. It’s an important herb in Ayurveda, whichhas been used in India for over 5,000 years, and is said to help reduce stressand anxiety. It’s also an adaptogen, helping to balance the body and protect itfrom the effects of different kinds of stressors.TRY A DAILY FAST: ALKALIZING FOODS UNTIL LUNCHSome research on intermittent fasting, which means going for prolonged periodsof time without eating, shows that it may help extend life span and ameliorateaging-related diseases1 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c05-nts1] byallowing more time for your body to repair and rejuvenate itself. This backs upthe plan proposed in The Beauty Detox Solution, which encourages consuming theGlowing Green Smoothie (this page[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_c02_r1.xhtml#page27]) and hot water with lemon in themornings. This is essentially a type of “fast,” consisting of only alkalizingfoods that are very easy to digest, until noon. By restricting heavier foods fora few hours in the morning you’re adding to the hours since dinner the nightbefore, giving your body longer periods of digestive rest. This is easier onyour body than some types of traditional intermittent fasting that prescribealternating normal eating days with whole fasting days on a weekly basis.Although some schools of thought favor frequent eating, the problem with thatapproach is that your stomach doesn’t have time to properly empty and break downa given food or meal before you give it something else to digest. This cancontribute to digestive overload. Give your body more of a rest, and keep yourmornings full of alkalizing smoothies, juices, fruit, and maybe some oatmeal,without the digestive burden of very heavy or acidic foods right at the start ofyour day.While a late morning or late afternoon snack might be warranted, depending onyour constitution, try not to eat constantly all day long (unless you have aspecific medical condition like hypoglycemia). Be sure to eat dinner at least 3hours (ideally) before bed. You want to be sure to digest your food thoroughlybefore hitting the sack.EAT IN ORDERIf you have a liquid soup, it’s best to have it at the beginning of the meal.The stomach will first process and remove liquids before it can really work tobreak down the solid food items. Drinking a lot of liquids with solid foods isnot good for digestion and can cause bloating, as liquids can dilute digestiveenzymes and slow digestion. Come into meals hydrated and sip on liquids asneeded while eating. Start your meals with fiber-filled, enzyme-rich raw foodssuch as salads and then move into other items. Avoid eating fast-digesting fruitat the end of your meals or for dessert. For more on this, check out The BeautyDetox Solution.KEEP MEALS SIMPLEInstead of having a lot of different elements on your plate, try using fewertypes of foods and larger portions of each. It’s easier for your body to digestsimpler meals, and more efficient digestion promotes your beauty.HOW THE TEMPERATURE OF FOODS AND BEVERAGES AFFECTS YOUR BEAUTYThe temperature of what you eat and drink, not just what you eat and drink, hasan impact on your beauty. Let’s talk about beverages first. In Western culture,ice has become ubiquitous. Go to a restaurant and tap water loaded with ice willautomatically be plunked down in front of you. We’ve become so used to drinkingonly extremely cold beverages that most of us keep or purchase bottled water andother beverages in icy cold refrigerators. Some people even add ice to whitewine!Historically, ice was never as readily available as it is today. This hyperinfusion of very cold temperatures into our beverages—and bodies—is a modernphenomenon. If you stick your feet in cold ocean water or your hand into thefreezer, it doesn’t take long to feel a numbing effect. Think about thathappening inside your body. The excessive cold can contract your stomach,impairing it from properly secreting proper enzymes and inducing a contractingor almost “shrinking” effect throughout your digestive system.The ancient medicinal systems of both Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) andAyurveda both heavily frown on ice-cold water and beverages. TCM holds that coldbeverages have a negative effect on metabolism and digestion and thatconsumption of them over many years can exert a negative effect on the health ofother organ systems as well, creating an environment where pain and chronicdiseases can develop.According to the TCM belief system, drinking cold beverages blocks meridianchannels (or pathways through which energy flows), slows and even congests bloodcirculation, and diminishes organ functioning.2[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c05-nts2] From a beauty standpoint, thisancient Asian medical system also believes that chronic cold-water drinking canlead to bloating, weight gain, fatigue, chronic pain, varicose veins, poordigestion, and even painful PMS.3[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c05-nts3]From the Ayurvedic perspective, iced and very cold beverages, as well as coldfoods, can put out your agni, or digestive fire. This can reduce your immunity,lower your resistance to disease, and allow for the buildup of ama, or toxins,in the body. These all diminish your beauty potential.Your internal body temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, or 37 degreesCelsius. Cold water is close to freezing temperature, so it is about 33 to 35degrees Fahrenheit or just above 0 degrees Celsius. A cold beverage shocks yoursystem. Your body is then forced to work harder, wasting precious energy inorder to make cold drinks warm enough for the body to actually use. This takesaway from energy that could otherwise be directed to repairing your skin’scollagen, boosting your energy and immunity, and taking on a multitude of otherbeauty functions.From a Western perspective, a popular idea that’s promoted in certain diets isthat drinking ice water helps you burn calories. But as information from theUniversity of Washington points out, this is essentially a myth. When you drinka cup of ice water, you burn about a measly 8 more calories than downing a cupof room temperature water, as your body raises the temperature of the ice waterto normal body temperature.4 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c05-nts4]This tiny caloric pittance is hardly significant for any aid in weight loss.Plus, what truly matters is optimizing your health and beauty for the long-term.RADICAL BEAUTY ACTION STEPS• Stop adding ice to your water and other beverages and get in the habit ofasking the waitstaff at restaurants not to add any ice to your water.• Over time, transition to drinking water and other liquids at room temperatureor sipping on warm herbal teas during the day to stay hydrated.• If you do drink bottled water when out and about or traveling (versus at home,where it is better to invest in a good water filter), start keeping the bottlesout on the counter or in a cupboard instead of in a very cold fridge.• Let your Glowing Green Smoothie or cold-pressed juices warm up slightly toroom temperature before drinking them. When you’re getting used to drinkinggreen drinks in the first place, colder temperatures can help them taste morepalatable, but over time you will adjust to them being a bit closer to roomtemperature. These drinks certainly don’t have to feel warm, which would beunappetizing, but if they are cool rather than icy cold, they will still bedelicious.• It’s important to support your digestion with something warm in the morning,which is why the Beauty Detox program has always recommended drinking hot waterwith lemon upon rising. While you are sipping on this, you can get into thehabit of making or taking your green drinks out of the fridge so they have timeto warm up slightly.COOKED VERSUS COLD RAW FOODSWhat about food? There are vastly conflicting ideas on this topic. TCM andAyurveda heavily disfavor consuming too many cold or raw foods, believing thatthe overconsumption of them can predispose you to disease and excessive internal“dampness,” and that cooked foods actually digest more easily. On the oppositeend of the spectrum is the raw food theory, which maintains that food should beeaten unheated to conserve vitamins and also food’s natural enzymes, which canbe destroyed during the cooking process.A combination of both raw and cooked foods is best to preserve your beautifulbalance. Consume warm liquids throughout the day: hot water with lemon in themornings and herbal teas during the day or evening. Get your raw enzymes andvitamins from fresh fruits and veggies in green smoothies, salads, and plainwhole fruit. Mix in hot soups; baked, steamed, or roasted vegetables; veggiestir-fries; and other hot entrées. It’s also a good idea to take digestiveenzymes before eating heavier or cooked foods to aid in digestion.It’s also important to adjust your diet naturally for each season (see Pillar 4[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_p04_r1.xhtml] for more detail on seasonal tips). Justas your clothes change for the seasons, so should your foods. For instance,you’ll probably naturally favor lighter, raw foods in the spring after a longwinter of eating heavier foods. When it’s freezing out, hot meals are going tohelp keep that internal digestive agni fire burning, and you’ll intuitively feelbetter eating heartier fare. In the midst of a hot summer, you will be more aptto naturally reach for cooling, juicy fruits and coconut water. Cooler drinksare okay in the summer, but we still want to avoid very icy ones year-round forthe reasons listed above.Keep listening to yourself, and you will stay beautifully balanced. You are adynamic being who is experiencing constant shifts and movement down to thecellular level. Your emotions and everything that is going on in your life, aswell as environmental factors and geographic placement, are all importantinfluences on your dietary shifts. It becomes imperative to listen to yournatural instinct and to be aware of changes and influences in your body’senergies and develop a greater and greater sensitivity to taking better care ofyourself as you become more receptive to your own body’s needs.TOP FOODS FOR RADICAL BEAUTYWhile all whole foods build beauty, there are some specific foods thatparticularly help your beauty shine through. This is not meant to be anexhaustive list—just some stellar foods to work into your rotation.BITTER FOODSAccording to Ayurvedic principles, bitter foods, which are lacking in mostAmerican diets, help tone skin and purify the body. Foods that taste bittertypically contain potent antioxidants and other phytochemicals like flavonoidsand polyphenols, which are responsible not only for their bitter taste but alsotheir phenomenal health and beauty benefits. Bitter foods also help to stimulateand improve digestion and support liver function. Beneficial bitter foodsinclude dandelion greens, parsley, cranberry, collard greens, and bitter melon.Incorporating bitter foods for beauty:Add bitter melon to your next curry or stir-fry. (Look for it at the Asiangrocery or section of your local market.)Use collard greens as a natural wrap for veggie burgers or hummus or veggiewraps.Add parsley to your green smoothies.Sip on unsweetened, diluted cranberry juice with water as a refreshing beverage.Chop and throw some dandelion greens into your green salads.SOUR FOODSSour foods are another important group that, according to Ayurveda, can helpcleanse the liver. Sour foods such as tomatoes, lemons, star fruit, tamarind,and fermented cabbage often include important vitamins like A and C.Incorporating sour foods for beauty:Squeeze lemon juice into water.Use lemon juice as a primary base for your salad dressings.Add tamarind paste to soups.Eat half a cup or so of fermented cabbage (aka raw sauerkraut) with your dinner.MUSHROOMSIn ancient Chinese medicine, mushrooms are regarded as tonics, which means theyhave nonspecific benefits across several systems of the body. Mushrooms are oneof the few food sources of vitamin D, which is important to keep your bones andmuscles beautifully strong. Certain varieties, such as shiitake, help improveimmunity.5 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c05-nts5] Himematsutakemushrooms are relatives of the common button mushroom that is found at nearlyevery grocery store. Very popular in Japan, himematsutakes are believed to helpimprove your skin and hair.6 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c05-nts6]Eating button mushrooms may impart the same benefits!Incorporating mushrooms for beauty:Slice raw mushrooms into salads (be sure to source organic varieties).Bake, steam, or sauté mushrooms or stuff and roast Portobello mushrooms as themain protein in your meal, or as a side dish.Add freshly sliced or dried mushrooms to your soups.Try some of the many Beauty Detox mushroom-based recipes (see Kimberly’s blog,kimberlysnyder. com [http://kimberlysnyder.com]).BLACK RICELike brown rice, black rice offers various beauty benefits, such as fiber andminerals, including manganese and iron. It is sometimes referred to as “purple”rice or even “forbidden rice,” because in ancient China it was reserved for theemperors and nobles, and the commoners were prohibited from eating it.Thankfully, now all of us “commoners” have access to this fantastic food. Itreally is delicious, and it has some striking properties. You might never thinkto compare black rice to blueberries or blackberries, but if you put them sideby side, they are actually nearly the same gorgeous purple color. That’s becausethe bran of black rice contains the same anthocyanin antioxidants as theseberries. Research from the Department of Food Science at Louisiana StateUniversity reported that a spoonful of black rice bran contains morehealth-promoting anthocyanin antioxidants than a spoonful of blueberries, butwith even more fiber and vitamin E antioxidants.7[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c05-nts7] This makes black rice wonderfulfor boosting your skin’s natural beauty. As with all rice, be sure to soak itovernight; this will make it easier to cook and also make its nutritionalbenefits more readily absorbed by the body.Incorporating black rice for beauty:Add black rice to bean, lentil, veggie, or other vegetarian soups, making aneasy and delicious entrée with just these two nutritious components.Stir-fry black rice with some coconut oil and veggies for a healthy “friedrice.”MICROGREENSThese tiny powerhouse greens not only help you look more beautiful but also makeany dish, however simple, look more beautiful. Just sprinkle them on top of anymeal. They’re one of the healthiest and most beautiful garnishes you could use.These young greens, including red cabbage, cilantro, and broccoli, are harvestedless than fourteen days after germination and are about 1 to 3 inches long. Theycontain up to forty times higher levels of vital nutrients than their maturecounterparts. For example, red cabbage microgreens have forty times more vitaminE and six times more vitamin C than mature red cabbage. Want one of the easiest,most space-effective ways to nourish your beauty? Add a handful of microgreensinto your diet and watch your skin glow.Incorporating microgreens for beauty:Toss microgreens into your salads.Add them to wraps and veggie burgers rather than regular lettuce.Top soups and just about any entrée you serve with them, right before serving.Blend a quarter or half cup or so into your Glowing Green Smoothies!ALOE VERA JUICENew York City’s Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center has studied aloe,including the plant’s extracted juice, for potential effects on dry skin,psoriasis, and other skin issues, along with internal issues like constipationand diabetes.8 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c05-nts8] The center alsonotes studies indicating aloe’s potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidanteffects. Aloe vera juice is quite different from topical gel versions, so makesure the label specifies use as a dietary supplement or juice. Some side effectshave been reported, such as gastrointestinal upset with long-term consumption,so, as with any new supplement or food you are unsure of, be sure to check withyour doctor first.Incorporating aloe vera juice for beauty:Dilute it into water along with some freshly squeezed lemon and sip.Add small amounts of it into smoothies.MACA ROOTPacked with minerals such as calcium and magnesium, B vitamins, enzymes, and allof the essential amino acids, maca is a Peruvian root that has been used formore than 2,000 years. It can help balance hormones and stimulate and nourishthe hypothalamus and pituitary glands (the “master glands” of the body),bringing beautiful balance throughout your entire system. Working as anadaptogen, maca is a “responsive” food that helps regulate the production ofyour hormones downward or upward, depending on your body’s individual needs.Hormones are important for so many things in your body, including your mood andtissue function. Balancing them is crucial for your overall beauty. Maca hasanecdotally been known to help improve skin, increase fertility, and even helpwith premenstrual syndrome (PMS) symptoms and libido. Start with ½ teaspoon orless to see how your body reacts to maca if you are new to it, working up to 1teaspoon or more over the next few weeks.Incorporating maca for beauty:Enjoy a delicious smoothie of maca blended with banana and almond milk orcoconut water.Stir into your herbal teas.Sprinkle over oatmeal.EDIBLE WEEDSBelieve it or not, weeds can help you look and feel more beautiful. They are theperfect demonstration of the abundance of nature’s beauty foods: they literallyare everywhere you turn. You can find weeds in your backyard and at your localfarmer’s market. If you are unsure of exactly what weeds you are looking for,it’s always a better bet to get them from the market. Purslane, dandeliongreens, and lamb’s-quarter are all particularly beauty-boosting weeds. Weeds arehearty plants that tend to be especially high in nutrients and antioxidants.Purslane is an exceptionally high source of omega-3 fatty acids, while dandelion(also a bitter food) and lamb’s-quarter (which tastes like a combination betweenspinach and Swiss chard) contain large amounts of vitamins A, C, and K andminerals such as calcium, iron, manganese, and potassium.Incorporating edible weeds for beauty:Add to smoothies.Lightly steam or sauté.Add to soups.MSM-RICH FOODSMethy lsulf onylm ethane, also known as MSM, has a lot of health- andbeauty-enriching properties. It contains sulfur, which helps with the properfunctioning of proteins in your body. MSM is revered for joint health andhelping to promote beautiful skin. It has anti-inflammatory and antioxidanteffects and is even said to aid with circulation. Some of the richest naturalsources of MSM include tomatoes, raspberries, apples, Swiss chard, and alfalfasprouts.Incorporating MSM-rich foods for beauty:When they’re in season, snack on lots of fresh raspberries and apples.Slice up tomatoes and eat them plain.Add chopped tomatoes to your soups or stews.Blend Swiss chard into your smoothies.WHITE TEAWhite tea may be very helpful in maintaining your weight, and some have evenanecdotally claimed that it protects against acne. A series of experiments onhuman fat cells (adipocytes) demonstrate that white tea can help inhibit new fatcells while stimulating the fat mobilization from mature fat cells.9[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c05-nts9] This may even be useful incombating cellulite. Green tea has received great press, but it contains afairly high level of caffeine. We all know this can feel temporarily energizingbut is still irritating to your nervous system. While actual caffeine levelsdepend on the specific buds and brewing methods used, green tea generallycontains more caffeine than white tea. White tea undergoes less processing thangreen or black tea, even though they derive from the same plant (Camelliasinensis). Because it is less processed, white tea also contains moreantioxidants, which are great for keeping your skin youthful and protecting yourvitality.Incorporating white tea for beauty:Source some excellent organic white tea and drink it during the day, stopping bylate afternoon, as it does contain some caffeine. For added benefits, add somesliced ginger, turmeric, or lemon.A WORD ABOUT SUPPLEMENTSYou certainly do not have to take a dozen supplement pills every day to behealthy. And you will never achieve the beauty and health results you are afterby trying to rely on pills in lieu of eating a superior, nutrition-packed dietmade up mostly of whole foods. Unfortunately, most supplements out there aresynthetically created, which makes them cheaper to produce and more stable.The problem is that with vitamins, more is most definitely not more. Syntheticvitamins are not remotely similar to the forms of these nutrients found innature, which you would obtain from eating natural foods. Our bodies evolved formillions of years getting these nutrients in unison with countless othernutritional cofactors that are present in real food. Vitamin supplements may notbe bioavailable, usable, or absorbable by your body, and even worse, they can berecognized and treated as a toxin, which then has to be processed and expelledby your eliminative organs. One study even found synthetic vitaminsupplementation can actually increase mortality rates!10[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c05-nts10]One supplement that is a must is an excellent probiotic supplement, which is notan isolated micronutrient but rather helps your entire body function moreefficiently. Remember that the best probiotics are not necessarily those withthe highest culture counts but ones that have the most effective and diversestrains that can actually be assimilated into your body (please see authors’websites for resources and recommendations: deepakchopra. com[http://deepakchopra.com], kimberlysnyder. com [http://kimberlysnyder.com]).What’s the best way to get the nutrients you need? Be sure to eat from a widevariety of plant foods, preferably organic, as the first step. You can alsosource specific superfoods rich in certain vitamins (bee pollen is rich in Bvitamins, for instance). If you still are worried you aren’t eating as well asyou should, you can also source a high-quality, whole-food-based andnonsynthetic multivitamin or multimineral supplement from a reputable companythat has done the necessary work and research to ensure optimal nutritionalabsorption. It should include vitamin D3 (which many people do need tosupplement, especially if you aren’t getting an adequate dosage of regularsunshine) and the spectrum of B vitamins, including vitamin B12. If you’revegan, you should definitely supplement vitamin B12.A magnesium-oxygen supplement (such as Detoxy +) is great for promoting ongoingcleansing (see this page [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_c02_r1.xhtml#page37]). Asrecommended in Pillar 1 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_p01_r1.xhtml], be sure toconsume chia, hemp, or flaxseeds daily for daily omega-3 fats. An algae-basedDHA and EPA supplement can be good insurance, as some people don’t convertomega-3 fats adequately into longer-chain DHA fats. Algae is the primary sourcefrom which fish obtain their DHA, and scientists from Harvard and the ClevelandClinic also report in The Journal of Nutrition that algae-based DHA can boostlevels of good cholesterol and cut levels of triglycerides.11[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c05-nts11] Fish oil pills as a source ofomega-3 fats are not recommended, as they can often become rancid andcontaminated with toxins.HOW DOES SALT FIT IN WITH BEAUTY?Sodium, found in salt, is an element our bodies need to function properly. Ithelps to control our blood pressure and blood volume, as well as ensuring propermuscle and nerve function. The best beauty forms of salt to use are smallamounts of high-quality sea salt, such as Celtic or Himalayan sea salt. Thesesea salts also have trace minerals and elements. Sea salts are obtained from theevaporation of saltwater bodies, rather than the heavy processing that producestable salt; this includes bleaching and diluting the salt after harvesting withanticaking agents and other chemicals. For these reasons, stick to sea salt inyour cooking.But too much salt is definitely a beauty and health no-no. Excessive salt intakecan increase the risk for heart disease, hypertension, high blood pressure, andkidney disease. It can also make your skin look dehydrated.Excessive sodium can also create “false fat,” making you look bloated and poundsheavier than you truly weigh.An average daily guideline is 1,000 to 1,500 milligrams (mg) of sodium per dayor less. If you are at risk for a medical condition, such as those listed above,you can certainly omit salt from your cooking altogether. Most of us, accustomedto so many processed and restaurant foods that contain loads of sodium, are usedto a very salty flavor. Shifting into eating more natural foods and preparingsimpler food will help you become more sensitive to the taste of salt. It’s alsoa good idea to add sea salt to your food right before you eat it, so it tastesmore salty without using more actual salt!"},{"pageContent":"PILLAR 2:EXTERNAL NOURISHMENTNow that you know how to lay the foundation for your beauty with your diet, weare going to talk about the best forms for the outer care of your skin.

In this pillar we’ll cover the best—aswell as the worst—ingredients and practices so you can allow your most beautifulself to be authentically reflected."},{"pageContent":"SHIFT 6:INCORPORATE NATURAL SKIN-CARE INGREDIENTSYOUR AMAZING SKINOur largest organ, the skin, is a fascinating one. It is an elimination organ,meaning it helps dispel wastes from your body through sweat. Your skin receivesroughly a third of all the blood that is circulated throughout the body. Itmakes sense that if the blood is congested, this is reflected in your skin. Yourskin is the last organ to receive nutrition in the body, yet is among the firstorgans to show signs of an imbalance or deficiency.But skin does also work in the opposite way, absorbing what is applied to it onthe outside. It is therefore critical to be strategic about putting the bestingredients on the surface of your skin to help repair and support its healthfrom the outside in. This seems obvious, but there is a great deal of marketinghype to weed through to determine what works and what is merely an empty claim.It’s also critical to avoid the numerous toxic ingredients that can be absorbedand not only tax your skin but also enter your bloodstream and burden yourliver.Your skin is also influenced by your emotions and mental state. Research showsthat stress can cause visible aging at the cellular level, including a studypublished in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.1[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c06-nts1] Elissa Epel, one of theresearchers for this study, states, “This is the first time that psychologicalstress has been linked to a cellular indicator of aging in healthy people.”2[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c06-nts2] Luckily, many of the techniquesin this pillar will help relax your mind and body while nurturing your skin fromthe outside in.Healthy, smooth, and radiant skin is considered the holy grail of beauty. If yousurvey any woman (and most men, even though they might not discuss it asopenly!), you will find that beautiful skin is at the very top of her beautywish list. Well, the time has come for you to get your wish. By working withyour skin and incorporating ingredients into your routine that will help nourishyour skin, you’ll create an optimal environment for your skin to grow, repair,and heal itself. The result will be skin that glows, reflecting your highestbeauty.NATURAL VS. CHEMICAL INGREDIENTSSome may think that the expensive, scientifically created, cutting-edge productson the market are automatically the most effective choices out there, but thisis not necessarily the case. The antioxidants found in natural plant ingredientsare still widely considered to be among the most powerful skin-care ingredients,and this is consistently proven in research.As Richard Baxter, MD, of the University of Washington School of Medicine,states, “There is enough published work to convince me that the antioxidantbotanicals will be the next big thing in skin care.”3[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c06-nts3] They may be the “next bigthing,” but they have also been around for thousands of years—much like ancientpractices like yoga and meditation are tagged as “new age.” (Ironic andillogical, right?) Synthetic ingredients may have properties to help boost yourskin, but some may tax your skin and even be toxic.4[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c06-nts4] That toxicity can be absorbedright from your skin into your system.5[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c06-nts5]As with your diet, the best approach to skin care is to understand the power ofnature. Nature’s beauty is unparalleled, and if you live closer to nature in allaspects of your lifestyle, your natural beauty will increase. Choose nontoxicproducts that contain natural, plant-based ingredients. As long as they aren’ttoxic, scientifically created ingredients, like concentrated, isolated peptides,that are aimed at a specific purpose such as minimizing the appearance of finelines and wrinkles can work together with natural ingredients to create powerfulcombinations. Nature and science can most certainly work together in a balancedway.Organic ingredients are, by definition, pesticide- and GMO-free. But keep inmind that products may contain some organic ingredients but may not be 100percent organic if other ingredients are processed in some way to make themusable or if they are actually lab created. Natural minerals such as mica arenot considered organic because they are not plant based. Also, water and saltsare excluded when determining a product’s percentage of organic ingredients.This means that some great products may be an effective blend of nontoxicingredients derived from nature and science, but may not be necessarily labeled100 percent organic.There are literally tens of thousands of beauty products on the market, allvirtually screaming at you from store aisles with their bold, brightly coloredpackages. If you glance at magazines, you’ll see the latest, hottest newskin-care ingredients pop up every month. It can be very confusing to determinethe best (and worse) choices for your skin.HOW TO READ SKIN-CARE PRODUCT LABELS (IT’S NOT WHAT YOU’VE HEARD)The FDA requires that ingredients be listed in INCI (International Nomenclatureof Cosmetic Ingredients) language. These labels often are not easily read andusually contain long words and names. An overly simplified and false statementyou hear a lot is that if you can’t pronounce it, you should not eat it or useit on your skin. But if you look at the INCI language required for a naturalingredient like shea butter, you would see Butyrospermum parkii, and for avocadoyou would see Persea gratissima. These hard-to-pronounce words (which are thebinomial plant names) would scare anyone who tried to follow this rule! If youare unsure of an ingredient or INCI language name, you can search the INCIdirectory.BEST RADICAL BEAUTY SKIN-CARE INGREDIENTSDespite the “breakthrough” ingredients that are constantly being introduced byskin-care companies, there are some important staples that should be included inyour external beauty skin-care routine. Over time, these have held up as beingthe most effective, from both a clinical research and an anecdotal point ofview. They are among the most important beauty ingredients to include in yourpersonal external skin-care beauty arsenal.ANTIOXIDANTSUnless you haven’t opened a beauty or health magazine in the last two decades,you have surely heard of antioxidants. Antioxidants, naturally present in mostplant foods in varying degrees, can help counter skin-aging free radicals andprevent damaged skin cells. This means slowing down those pesky skin issues weall want to avoid, such as wrinkles, dry or dull skin, dark under-eye circles,and crow’s feet.You’ll find a very wide range of antioxidants and corresponding plantingredients touted in various skin-care products. These can range from coffeeberry to acai and a range of other berries and fruits. Some of the most powerfulantioxidant ingredients are listed below.VITAMIN CVitamin C is so powerful and produces such great results that no skin-careroutine should be without it. It’s present in many fruits and vegetables and isadded into skin-care products in a concentrated form. Vitamin C has long beenconsidered a workhorse ingredient, and its effectiveness has been backed up byclinical research.6 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c06-nts6] Itincreases collagen production, which creates firm, beautiful, and thicker skinover time, helps to keep skin hydrated, and diminishes fine lines and wrinkles.As an antioxidant vitamin, it helps squash skin damage caused by unstable freeradicals and sun exposure7 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c06-nts7] andalso boosts the efficacy of vitamin E. On a label, concentrated forms of vitaminC often read as L-ascorbic acid.VITAMIN EVitamin E, made up of tocopherols and tocotrienols, is another great antioxidantvitamin that is highly protective of your cells and helps your skin retainmoisture to stay supple and beautiful. Vitamin E also helps reverse existingdamage to your skin, including scarring from acne and blemishes and age spots.Used in a skin-care product formulation, vitamin E also helps stabilize otheringredients as well as oils, preventing them from going rancid. Tocopherolacetate is an artificial form of vitamin E that is often seen on product labels.It’s made from a combination of naturally derived vitamin E and other chemicalcompounds, such as acetic acid. The natural vitamin E is generally consideredpreferable.VITAMIN A AND ITS DERIVATIVESThere has been a lot of research on this ingredient dating back to the 1980s,proving it to be a highly effective anti-aging treatment. It helps improve cellcommunication, in effect “telling” your skin cells to correct themselves. Thisimproves the look of wrinkles and promotes firmness so your skin appears morehealthy and youthful. Vitamin A is the precursor to retinoids, which can beapplied topically or ingested; they cannot be made in the human body. Theseretinoids, or retinoic acids, come in various forms, including retinol, retinylpalmitate, tretinoin, and tazarotene. Some of these require a prescription,while retinol and retinyl palmitate can be found in various over-the-counterproducts. This category of ingredients has been shown to help promote smootherskin and overall brighter skin tone, while reversing discoloration and repairingcellular structure damage, such as scars, lines and wrinkles, and even acne.This is all great, but—and there’s a big “but” here—retinoids are considered bysome to be toxic. This is largely due to their ability to make you moresensitive to sunlight and because of pregnancy concerns. The EnvironmentalWorking Group states, “Data from an FDA study indicate that retinyl palmitate,when applied to the skin in the presence of sunlight, may speed the developmentof skin tumors and lesions. The FDA and Norwegian and German health agencieshave raised a concern that daily skin application of vitamin A creams maycontribute to excessive vitamin A intake for pregnant women and otherpopulations.”8 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c06-nts8]Retinoids can also be irritating and intolerable, so be sure to check with yourdermatologist and evaluate whether or not retinoids in any form are right foryou. They are considered a highly effective ingredient, but from a toxicitystandpoint they are not completely in the clear. Again, evaluate for yourselfand see what is right for you and your skin. If you do choose to go this routeand use some vitamin A derivatives, be sure to use strong protection from thesun or avoid sunlight altogether. And remember that all women trying to conceiveor who are pregnant must completely avoid retinoids.ALPHA HYDROXY ACIDS (AHAS)Exfoliation helps your skin shed old, damaged surface skin cells to allow new,fresh cells to grow in their place. If you don’t slough old cells, it’s harderfor your body to absorb the ingredients from your skin-care products; they willmore likely just sit on the surface of the older, dead skin cells and not do youany real good. What a waste! This is similar to the concept of internaldetoxification. You have to make space for the new raw materials to come in andbe absorbed and assimilated so they can be used to fuel your beauty.AHAs exfoliate without scrubbing with physically dense abrasives such as grains,granules, apricot pits, and the like, which can lead to broken capillaries anddamaged pores. However, if your skin is dark or particularly sensitive, be verycareful to avoid irritation. There are various kinds of AHAs and differentstrengths to choose from, including malic, mandelic, lactic, and glycolic acids.The mandelic and malic acids tend to be much safer for dark skin, though be sureto ask your dermatologist if you are unsure which AHAs are right for your skin,and ask what strength to use. AHAs can also make your skin more sensitive tosunlight, so be sure to protect yourself properly.GREEN TEAGreen tea is a fantastic ingredient to include in your skin-care routine due toits polyphenols, a type of flavonoid that enacts powerful antioxidant activity.Topically applied, green tea can help reduce inflammation in your skin, therebypreventing or slowing the formation of lines and wrinkles and reducing saggingskin. Some studies have shown that green tea can also reduce damage fromenvironmental pollution and sun damage.9[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c06-nts9]PEPTIDESPeptides are protein fragments that have been shown to have some beneficialeffects on skin. In particular, they help heal damaged tissue from scars andwrinkles and stimulate the production of healthy normal skin. Some research hasshown that peptides can help enhance cell communication,10[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c06-nts10] regulating the exchange andgrowth rates between layers of skin cells. Peptides can also prevent harmfuloxidation that damages the skin, and they have anti-inflammatory properties thatcan better set up your skin to heal itself.ESSENTIAL FATTY ACIDS (EFAS)EFAs reduce the amount of moisture lost through your epidermis, the top layer ofyour skin, thereby keeping your skin soft and elastic instead of dried out. Theyare particularly protective in cold or windy weather, which can strip away theskin’s lipid barrier and contribute to skin conditions such as eczema. Theanti-inflammatory properties of these essential fats are also helpful for eczemaand psoriasis, and in preventing inflammation that can contribute to aging.There are many natural sources for these essential fatty acids, such as sheabutter, kukui nut, jojoba, rosehip, sesame seed, black currant, eveningprimrose, camellia seed, almond, apricot kernel, argan, hemp seed, manuka,kokum, pumpkin seed, olive, black cumin seed, coconut, sea buckthorn, avocado,borage, tamanu, and walnut oils.HYALURONIC ACID (HA)The body uses hyaluronic acid to make new cells, and it is a natural compoundfound in the skin. As we age, we produce less of this acid, so adding it backhelps repair the skin and reduce inflammation. As a skin-care productingredient, it helps not only to deliver moisture to the skin but also to holdit there, preventing moisture loss for continued smooth skin while protectingthe skin from dirt, debris, and pollutants. It doesn’t penetrate too deeply,staying near the surface of your skin. Hyaluronic acid was once produced largelyfrom the comb of a rooster, but thankfully it is now produced in a lab from afermentation process that involves plant materials.CLAYThere are different kinds of clays, which are a highly beneficial ingredient toinclude in skin masks. Sometimes masks are pushed to the side in a skin-careroutine, but applying masks is an ancient beauty tool that can be verybeneficial to use at least once a week (depending on your skin type) to help youmaintain beautiful skin for the long-term.Clay is a unique ingredient with the ability to absorb excess oils, dirt, andharmful toxins from the skin. Clays are made up of different mineral contents,which are unique to different types of clays, and these minerals help rejuvenatethe skin as the clay simultaneously exfoliates and stimulates blood circulationto the skin. The more regularly you use clays, the fresher your skin will look.Improved circulation and the removal of debris from your pores instantly improvethe brightness of your skin.Rose clay is mild kaolin clay that is great for normal to dry skin and gentlyhelps cleanse, exfoliate, and improve skin’s condition. It gets its delicatepink color from the iron oxides it contains. White clay, also known as Chinaclay, is basically kaolinite and is the mildest of all clays. It helps stimulatecirculation to the skin while gently exfoliating and cleansing. French greenclay consists mostly of montmorillonite and is highly efficient at drawing oilsand toxins from the skin. It also helps nourish the skin with minerals andphytonutrients. It is great for oily skin and is commonly included in spa bodywraps. It’s not recommended for sensitive or dry skin. Yellow kaolin clay ismild and stimulates circulation to the skin; it is suitable for use on sensitiveskin as well as dry skin.ANCIENT BEAUTY INGREDIENT: ROSE WATERRoses are one of the most universally revered flowers for their beauty and sweetfragrance, but what can they do for your skin? In ancient Rome, rose water wasallegedly used as a cleanser. Some even bathed in it. Rose water has also been apart of Indian skin care for millennia. Just like natural foods, naturalskin-care ingredients can impart their beautifying properties onto you. Pure,true rose water is created from steam distillation of damask rose petals. Itsmells delicate and delicious and nothing like the synthetic and sickeninglystrong fragrances that are used in toxic sprays and car air fresheners.Rose water is said to have some antibacterial and antiseptic properties and isbelieved to help restore the skin’s pH levels and tighten pores. It’s alsoconsidered to be anti-inflammatory and to help regenerate skin tissue. Thesugars and natural oils found in rose petals trap moisture in your skin, makingyour skin look smoother and softer—just like the beautiful rose petalsthemselves. Plus rose water’s natural fragrance can help soothe your nervoussystem. This will help destress you, another key factor in keeping your skinyouthful and healthy.Try to find some pure rose water at a health store and add a few drops to yourcleanser or moisturizer. You can also try using it as a toner, either pure ormixed with a bit of witch hazel, gently brushing it over your skin with a cottonpad after cleansing.Bentonite clay is derived from deposits of weathered volcanic ash. It absorbstoxins such as heavy metals and other pollutants from the surface of your skinlike a kitchen sponge. There is also an electrical aspect to bentonite clay’sability to bind and absorb toxins. Bentonite clay has a negative electricalcharge, attracting positively charged molecules. As most toxins are positivelycharged, clay naturally rids the body of toxins as it pulls and holds the toxinsin its core.11 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c06-nts11]COSMETICS SAFETY: CRITICAL FOR YOUR OVERALL BEAUTYJust because a cosmetic is sitting innocuously on the shelf at your localpharmacy, there’s no guarantee that it is safe and will not have toxicramifications on your body. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has noauthority to require companies to test cosmetic products for safety, and mostproducts and ingredients are not approved or reviewed before they are placed onshelves. The FDA conducts premarket reviews only of certain cosmetics’ coloradditives and active ingredients that are classified as over-the-counterdrugs.12 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c06-nts12],13[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c06-nts13] It also has no authority torequire recalls of harmful cosmetics, and manufacturers are not required toreport cosmetics-related injuries to the agency. The FDA relies on companies toreport injuries voluntarily14 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c06-nts14](yes, you read that right—voluntarily!).Cosmetics in the European Union are far more strictly regulated. There, over1,000 ingredients have been banned from use. In contrast, the FDA has onlyprohibited a fraction of those ingredients, including some color additives andother prohibited substances.15 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c06-nts15]Another scary fact is that federal law allows companies to leave some chemicalingredients off their product labels, including those considered to be tradesecrets and some components of fragrance and nanomaterials.16[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c06-nts16]Since the FDA does not play a big role in regulating the safety of ingredients,it has authorized the cosmetics industry to police itself with the CosmeticIngredient Review panel. To date, in its thirty-plus-year history, the industrypanel has declared only eleven ingredients or chemical groups to be unsafe,17[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c06-nts17] and its recommendations onrestricting ingredients are not binding on companies.18[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c06-nts18] So it doesn’t sound like muchreal “policing” is going on. Where does that leave us, as consumers?Ingredients from cosmetics not only are absorbed through the skin but are alsooften swallowed and inhaled from sprays and powders. Many of them are hormonedisruptors that can create developmental and reproductive damage and allergicreactions, act as carcinogens, and create other kinds of damage in the body.19[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c06-nts19],20[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c06-nts20] It’s ultra-important tounderstand labels and ingredients, as the FDA says that descriptions such as“hypoallergenic” or “natural” can “mean anything or nothing at all.”21[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c06-nts21] Don’t assume that companies orany prevailing organizations—governmental or otherwise—are necessarily lookingout for your best interests. It’s important to scan labels and look into theethos of brands that you choose to use in and on your body. Ultimately, we haveto look out for our families and ourselves and not leave our safety in the handsof anyone else.TOXIC SKIN-CARE INGREDIENTS TO AVOIDThere are countless toxins and additives in commercial skin-care, makeup,body-care, and other personal-care products. It would fill this entire book (andmore) to list and describe them all. But there are some common offenders thatare worse than others. For more information, the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics(safecosmetics. org/ [http://safecosmetics.org/]) and the Environmental WorkingGroup Skin Deep Cosmetics Database (ewg. org/ skindeep/[http://ewg.org/skindeep/]) are two great resources to consult about thetoxicity of specific products and ingredients. These organizations, as well ascertain reports, believe that toxic ingredients can create DNA damage; act ascarcinogens; create brain, liver, kidney, and other organ abnormalities; produceallergic or other reactions; and cause eye damage, nervous system damage,reproductive damage, and birth defects.22[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c06-nts22] The list of these possibledangers continues to grow as more chemicals are introduced and studied.Here are some of the most glaringly toxic ingredients to avoid. Again, this islike a drop in the ocean, not an exhaustive list:• Benzoyl peroxide• Synthetic (or artificial) FD&C colors and dyes• Propylene glycol (PG) and butylene glycol• Diethanolamine (DEA), monoethanolamine (MEA), and triethanolamine (TEA)• Methyl-, butyl-, ethyl-, and propylparabens• Sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) and sodium laureth sulfate (SLES)• Dioxin• Polyethylene glycol (PEG)• Avobenzone• Phthalates• Triclosan• DMDM hydantoin and imidazolidinyl ureaRADICALLY TIMELESS BEAUTY MASKThis nourishing mask will leave your skin feeling moisturized, smooth, andradiant. Used regularly, it can help ward off wrinkles and puffiness. Theseingredients are rich in nourishing enzymes, vitamin E, and beauty fats and oils.1 tablespoon raw, organic honey1 teaspoon almond oil1 teaspoon rose waterCombine the ingredients in a small bowl. Apply to your face and neck for about15 to 20 minutes. Rinse well.SUNSCREEN INGREDIENTS: WADING THROUGH THE TOXIC AND THE SAFEIt’s well established that sunscreen can help protect against skin cancers andsun damage. The risk isn’t entirely related to how much sun hits yourunprotected skin, since exposure when you were a child can lead to a higher riskof skin cancer as an adult, and the exposure doesn’t need to be drastic. Thebest rule, however, is to protect yourself from the sun’s ultraviolet (UV)radiation as much as you can. Best medical advice also holds that you use ahigher sunblock number. Simple measures like wearing a sun hat with a wide brimhelp remove the burden from sunblocks, along with sitting in the shade andwearing sunglasses that are UV resistant.Also be aware that there are a multitude of toxic ingredients in mostsunscreens. When choosing a sunscreen, look for products with the activeingredient zinc oxide or titanium dioxide. These are physical protectants, whichreflect UV rays off your skin, rather than chemical products.Here are some toxic skin-care ingredients to look out for and avoid.OXYBENZONE (AKA BENZOPHENONE-3)While the American Academy of Dermatology says oxybenzone is safe, theEnvironmental Working Group (EWG) and other toxicology experts believe thatoxybenzone is linked to hormone disruption and potentially to cell damage thatmay lead to skin cancer.23 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c06-nts23]Some studies have linked oxybenzone use in pregnant women to low birth weight,24[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c06-nts24] which can lead to serioushealth problems later in life; it also may impact the adrenal system25[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c06-nts25] and may also reducetestosterone levels in men.26 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c06-nts26]NANOPARTICLESThese are extremely tiny particles added to sunscreen that are easily absorbedby the skin. About 100,000 times smaller than the width of a human hair, thesetiny particles can penetrate the blood-brain barrier, leading to damage orgenetic changes in the brain cells.27[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c06-nts27] Be sure that the ingredientson your sunscreen are in a non-nano form. This even goes for safer sunscreeningredients such as zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, as micronized titaniumdioxide has been associated with cellular damage.28[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c06-nts28]RETINYL PALMITATEIn a National Toxicology Program study on lab animals, it was found that whenskin is treated with a mix of retinyl palmitate (RP), a vitamin A derivative,and skin cream and exposed to ultraviolet light, the cream with retinylpalmitate stimulated lesion and tumor growth.29[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c06-nts29] As discussed earlier, whilevitamin A may be considered a wonderful skin-care ingredient in its naturalstate, it should be restricted to night creams for those that choose to useit—and never used in sunscreen.OCTYL METHOXYCINNAMATE (AKA OCTINOXATE, EUSOLEX 2292, AND UVINUL MC80)This is an ingredient that is believed to create free radicals inside the skin,which can create cellular and DNA damage. Similar to oxybenzone, it works withother penetration enhancers to enter through the skin and accumulate in thebody. It has the potential to possibly create phototoxic effects, meaning thattoxic reactions are provoked by light.30[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c06-nts30]PADIMATE O (AKA PARA-AMINOBENZOIC ACID, OR PABA)Because this can be very irritating to the skin, it has largely been phased outof most sunscreens. But it’s worth looking out for, just in case it’s stilllurking around in some brands. According to the EWG, PABA can release freeradicals, create allergic reactions, damage DNA, and induce estrogenic activity;and they implicated padimate O as a nitrosamine, a class of compounds that maybe carcinogenic.31 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c06-nts31]SOLAR BEAUTY SMOOTHER TREATMENTAlmond, argan, and olive oils are particularly good for replenishing themoisture in dry skin and contain vitamin E and nourishing minerals. Sweet orangeoil is believed to be particularly effective in helping rejuvenate andrevitalize the skin against sun damage.2 teaspoons almond oil1 teaspoon argan or avocado oil8 drops sweet orange essential oilCombine all ingredients until mixed well. Rub onto sun-exposed areas, reapplyingtwo or three times per day. For a firmer, more cream-like consistency, store ina glass or BPA-free container in the refrigerator.BEAUTIFUL UNDERARMS: TOXIC VERSUS SAFE DEODORANTS AND ANTIPERSPIRANTSOne beautiful way your body was designed for detoxification is to allow wastesto evaporate through the pores of your skin. A key area where your body detoxesitself is under your arms, where sweat glands and lymph nodes are located. Themodern concept of using antiperspirants to stop your underarms from sweating canhold toxicity in. This is not natural or recommended.Clogging your body’s normal channels for waste removal is not a good idea. Youcan wipe or cleanse your underarms during the day if you are concerned aboutexcessive moisture, and there are natural solutions to prevent underarm odor.Keep in mind that as you clean up your diet and improve your digestion and theelimination of wastes in your system, your level of offensive bodily odors maynaturally decrease. But you will probably still want to use something to ensurethat you always smell fresh and clean. When you do, it’s important to chooseyour deodorant wisely. Commercial deodorants contain some potentially toxicmaterials that you should try to avoid. Some of these ingredients includealuminum, parabens, propylene glycol, triclosan, TEA, DEA, FD&C, phthalates, andtalc.Aluminum has been linked to Alzheimer’s, cancer, and allergic reactions. Somepeople dispute the link between the type of aluminum used in deodorants andthese diseases,32 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c06-nts32] but othersbelieve it is worth avoiding. Some have suggested that aluminum-based compoundsin antiperspirants may be absorbed through the skin and can be a health riskfactor, though much more research is needed to show a definite link. With allthe alternatives out there nowadays in various deodorants, you can certainlyavoid aluminum if you choose.Parabens mimic the activity of estrogen in the body. Since estrogen promotes thegrowth of breast cancer cells, and a woman is eight times more likely to developbreast cancer in the part of the breast closest to the underarm, scientists arestudying the connection, though further studies and research are needed.RADICALLY SAFE DEODORANTIt is easy to make your own deodorant that is safe and effective in eliminatingunpleasant underarm odor! The coconut oil and baking soda in this DIY versionboth have antibacterial properties and help prevent odor, while the grapefruitextract smells bright and fresh and has antibacterial and antiseptic qualitiesas well. The arrowroot starch helps thicken your deodorant into a somewhat solidform that is easy to apply.3 tablespoons coconut oil3 tablespoons baking soda40 (or so) drops grapefruit extract1½ tablespoons arrowroot starchIn a bowl, mix together all the ingredients until well combined into a thick,paste-like consistency. Store in the refrigerator for 20 to 30 minutes to letthe coconut oil resolidify if it liquefied during the mixing process. Place themixture into a small glass or BPA-free container. Dip your fingers into themixture and apply it directly to your underarms. To keep your deodorant solid,be sure to store it in a cool place, but even if it liquefies a bit, it willstill work just as well!"},{"pageContent":"SHIFT 7:PRACTICES TO NOURISH YOUR SKIN FROM THE OUTSIDE INIn Pillar 1 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_p01_r1.xhtml], you learned to boost yourbeauty from the inside out by eating foods with unique properties that helpboost circulation and support your body’s natural processes. Many people don’trealize that in addition to using the right skin-care products, there are alsomany things you can do to improve the body’s functions from the outside in.SUPPORTING YOUR LYMPHATIC CIRCULATION FOR ENHANCED DETOXIFICATION AND SLOWEDAGINGMost people don’t think about it that much, but we have a second circulatorysystem devoted to healing and immunity known as the lymphatic system. Composedof your spleen, thymus, lymph, lymph nodes, and lymph channels as well as yourtonsils and adenoids, your lymphatic system works directly with yourcardiovascular circulatory system to keep blood and lymphatic fluid levels inbalance and flush toxins out of the body. Fluid squeezed from the blood, calledinterstitial fluid or “lymph,” transports waste to your lymph nodes through aseries of vessels similar to veins. There, the fluid is neutralized, filtered,and eventually returned to the bloodstream. These vessels also carry immunecells throughout the body to help defend against infections.Called rasa in Ayurveda, your lymph is part of the plasma that is consideredpart of the primary dhatu, or structure of the body. Healthy rasa is key inorder to give rise to the next dhatu, healthy rakta, or blood, and consequentlythe other dhatus in the body. Rasa is said to govern your emotional and hungerresponses, which is another good reason to keep it flowing.Unlike the cardiovascular system, the heart does not pump the lymphatic system,which is basically self-circulating. Gravity, muscle contractions, and certainforms of movement and manipulation stimulate this system. If your lymphaticcirculation gets sluggish, toxins build up, which is the precursor toaccelerated aging.1 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c07-nts1] Aches andpains can also appear, and your immunity is lowered. This can adversely affectyour thymus gland, tonsils, and spleen, which in turn can weaken your bodyagainst sickness and diseases. Traditional Chinese Medicine believes that yourspleen plays a central part in your vitality and strength.Because the two systems work together, incorporating the foods recommended inPillar 1 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_p01_r1.xhtml] for your cardiovascular systemwill also be beneficial for your lymphatic system. However, since your almightyheart does not pump the lymphatic system, there are specific methods to supportthis system that are applied to the outside of the body. Here are some greatmethods you can incorporate to support your lymph system and nourish glowing,healthy skin from the outside in.GET A MASSAGEMassages are incredibly beneficial for detoxification. Stimulating the blood andlymph vessels helps move the fluids and enhance circulation. Professionalmassages are wonderful, as well as a regular practice of self-massage.PRACTICE ABHYANGAThis ancient form of self-massage is a powerful anti-aging practice that caneasily be incorporated into your daily routine. Abhyanga will make you feelrejuvenated, soften your skin, and contribute to a better overall skin tonewhile also fostering muscle tone. There is a belief in Ayurveda that workingmanually on the surface of the skin helps support the structure and health ofyour muscles, as there is a connection between your skin and muscle health. Someof abhyanga’s deeper, detoxifying properties are meant to be cumulative andlong-term, so you may not witness immediate benefits, but you will likely feelinvigorated by the movement while you trust that deeper support fordetoxification is taking place beneath the surface! As you know, the importanceof improving circulation and detoxification (which is part of what abhyanga isall about) cannot be overestimated for its long-term role in maintaining yourhealth and beauty.Abhyanga has been part of Ayurveda for thousands of years and is perhaps theforemost anti-aging practice you can incorporate into your daily life. That is apretty strong statement, but abhyanga can help balance your entire mind andbody, relieve fatigue, provide stamina, enhance sleep, promote a bettercomplexion, improve the luster of your skin, increase longevity, and fosterall-around body nourishment. You may be skeptical that a simple self-massagepractice can really reap all those benefits, but as you progress in yourunderstanding of the circulation and lymphatic system, you’ll surely realizethese benefits and appreciate how anti-aging abhyanga truly is.First, it’s important to learn more about your skin. Besides being a majorelimination organ, your skin is the largest organ of sensory perception. Yourskin takes in a great deal of information from the outside world and isconnected to every part of the body by thousands of nerves throughout yourentire nervous system. As such, Ayurveda believes that touching the outside ofyour skin has a big impact on your nervous system, while your nervous systemfurther impacts your endocrine system and immunity. An imbalanced nervous systemcan manifest in excessive worry, decreased energy, imbalanced digestion, and caneventually contribute to deeper and more plentiful wrinkles, as you generallyage at a much faster rate when your nervous system is imbalanced.Stress and toxins constantly accumulate in the mind and body, but thankfullyabhyanga can help dissolve them on a daily basis. By manually working with skin,Ayurveda claims you can help bring yourself back to the present moment andreduce excessive Vata energy, or an overabundance of the air element that canmake you feel flighty, anxious, and ungrounded. In other words, the sense oftouch can help settle your overactive, restless mind as it recharges andrejuvenates you.On a physical level, according to Ayurvedic texts, abhyanga prevents theaccumulation of physiological toxins, known as ama, and lubricates muscles,tissues, and joints, promoting flexibility. Ancient Ayurvedic texts claim thatit also improves the softness and luster of the skin. Exercising or taking a hotshower after practicing abhyanga helps the oil penetrate the dermis, whichfurther nourishes the collagen and elastin. The penetration of the oil into theskin can also help to remove toxins and debris while improving the health ofblood vessels.For your oil, sesame oil is best to use in the winter because it is consideredwarming, while coconut oil is considered cooling and therefore recommended forthe warmer summer months. You can also try special Ayurvedic herbal oils thatyou can source from a reputable Ayurvedic purveyor or find online, or make yourown massage oil. Be sure any oil you use is organic, unrefined, andcold-pressed.Ideally, do your abhyanga practice in the morning. This will help release thetoxins that have accumulated during the night and rejuvenate you for the day. Toavoid slipping, we recommend sitting on the floor or a chair near your shower.Start by warming the chosen oil slightly by holding it under hot water for a fewminutes. Then apply some of the warmed oil to your hands and massage your entirebody for 5 to 10 minutes, applying even pressure with your palm and fingers.Apply lighter pressure to sensitive areas such as your upper torso, breasts,heart, and abdominal area. When you are massaging your abdomen, start on theright side (from your perspective when looking down) and then make a circularmotion up, across, and down the left side. This supports the natural pathway ofdigestion. Spend a few moments conducting this circular pathway.Next, take more oil and spend time massaging the soles of your feet, the palmsof your hands, and the base of your fingernails, where there are many nerveendings. Don’t forget about your face, ears, and neck. Be sure to give them somelove, too! Don’t worry; pure, organic oils should not make you break out. (Ifyou have excessively oily skin and are worried about breakouts, you can alwaysavoid your face.) On days when you are going to wash your hair (which could beone to five times a week, depending on your hair type), spend some timemassaging your entire scalp. Use circular motions over rounded areas such asyour feet and scalp and straight, longer strokes on your limbs. If you don’thave much time, focus on your feet and scalp; Ayurveda teaches that these arethe most important areas to stimulate with touch.When you’re done, make sure you’ve rubbed the oil in as much as possible,especially on your feet; be very careful to rub in all oils on the bottom ofyour feet before attempting walking or showering! It’s common to use too muchoil at first, but you will soon reach the right amount. Towel off with a freshtowel. Then you can choose to work out or go straight into a hot shower. Theheat from your workout (or the shower) will help the oil penetratetransdermally. This will strengthen the connective skin tissues and help yourskin stay supple and healthily beautiful. In the shower, only use soap on yourprivate parts and underarms. Excessive use of soap can strip your skin ofmoisture, and coconut and other oils have antibacterial, cleansing properties.If you still feel oily or greasy, use a natural soap sparingly. After you toweloff, you’ll find a thin film of oil on your skin. This will help your skin staymoisturized and protected, while keeping your muscles warm throughout the day.BEAUTY SECRET IN A TINY SEED: SESAME OILCoconut oil is all the rage right now (and for good reason), but sesame oil isanother great natural, nongreasy moisturizing oil. Don’t worry; you don’t haveto smell like your neighborhood Chinese take-out joint. In fact, Asian cookingoils are not the right kind. Pure, cold-pressed sesame oil is what you want; ithas a mild, pleasant scent and is absorbed readily into your skin. If youpurchase sesame oil that has a strong odor, it’s probably roasted or toastedsesame oil. Unroasted, cold-pressed sesame oil, on the other hand, is highlylubricating and fantastic for both your skin and scalp, promoting vitality andhealthy hair growth. Keep it refrigerated except for the daily amounts you setaside for your massage.Sesame oil is highly nourishing and healing and contains vitamin E and Bvitamins, amino acids, and minerals such as magnesium, calcium, and phosphorus.It helps soften your skin and hair, keeping them hydrated by locking moisturein. Sesame oil will effectively penetrate deeper into the epidermis tomoisturize and repair skin, especially if heat is applied after sesame oilapplication (as from a hot shower after abhyanga). Sesame oil is particularlyprotective against pollution and effective at revitalizing damaged hair fromdeep within.DRY BRUSHINGLike abhyanga, dry brushing is a manual treatment that is great for improvingcirculation and rejuvenating your skin. You can actually integrate dry brushinginto your abhyanga routine by dry brushing for just a few minutes right beforeapplying the oil and starting the self-massage. This heightens the benefits ofabhyanga even more.Like other forms of sloughing the skin to exfoliate, dry brushing has beenpracticed widely around the world, from Japan to Sweden. Manually working withthe skin—our largest organ of sensory perception made of multiple cell layers,glands, and densely packed nerve cells—has amazing whole body benefits. It helpsremove dead skin cells and clear out clogged pores, allowing your body toeliminate wastes and toxins more efficiently. This also activates waste removalvia your lymphatic system, draining wastes through your lymph nodes andlymphatic drainage. Increasing circulation to your skin allows metabolic wastesto clear from your body more efficiently, making dry brushing a greatdetoxifying aid.Like a light massage, dry brushing also provides some anti-stress benefits andmay even help with bloating. Massaging the lymph nodes can help the body shedexcess water and toxins, improving kidney function and flushing out your system.Dry skin brushing rejuvenates the nervous system by stimulating nerve endings inthe skin, and it feels pretty great, too! (Well, it can feel a little rough atfirst when you are getting used to it, but it will leave you feeling revitalizedand with a great memory of the experience.) Last but not least, dry brushingwill almost certainly help make your skin glow and become tighter. Try it foryourself and see what kinds of benefits you experience!To do it yourself, all you need is about 2 to 3 minutes a day (ideally layeredinto your abhyanga practice) and a long-handled brush made from dry bristles,which you can generally purchase for under $20 online or at a health market.Starting at your feet, brush your skin in long strokes toward your heart. Besure to brush your legs, arms, chest, back, and stomach. Avoid sensitive areas,such as your face, and be very careful with delicate areas like varicose veins(though gentle dry brushing can be great for flat spider veins). Be firm, butdon’t press too hard. Your skin should be pink when you’re done but certainlynot red or irritated. Afterward, be sure to engage in your abhyanga practice orapply a natural moisturizer or emollient oil, such as shea butter or coconut orsesame oil. Since dry brushing helps slough off the dead, outer cells, your skinwill be able to hydrate more efficiently and absorb more moisture.OCEAN BEAUTY DETOX AND MINERAL MASKKelp is seaweed that is rich in minerals and vitamins. Used in a mask form, itwill draw impurities out of your skin as it also helps restore nutrition to yourcomplexion.2 tablespoons kelp powder½ cup aloe vera gel2 teaspoons filtered waterCombine the kelp and aloe vera in a small bowl. Slowly mix in the water untilyou create a thick paste. Apply to your face and neck for about 15 to 20minutes. Rinse well.JUMP ON A TRAMPOLINEThis type of movement is particularly good for increasing lymph flow, as theup-and-down rhythmic gravitational force created by bouncing encourages thelymph system’s one-way valves to open and close.GO FOR A WALK OR HIKEIn addition to all the other benefits of getting out into nature (not to mentionexercise), walking is a great way to help move your lymphatic system and improvecirculation.CLEANSETry a properly administered cleanse, especially in the springtime. If welldesigned and followed, this can be a great way to detox your whole system andlet your lymph system flush out accumulated wastes and toxins. If you areinterested, check out Kimberly’s organic smoothie and juice company (myglowbio.com [http://myglowbio.com]) for cleanses she designs that ship nationally.WEAR LOOSE CLOTHINGTight clothing can restrict your body’s natural circulation, so peel yourselfout of your skinny jeans (at least part of the time) and incorporate moreflowing skirts and maxi dresses into your wardrobe. You’ll be more comfy—andmore detoxed. After detoxing your lymphatic system with looser clothes on mostdays, you’ll look even better on those nights when you do want to wear a tight,slinky dress.PRACTICE HYDROTHERAPYIf you’ve ever been to a traditional Korean spa, you’ll find a cold plunge poolnext to a hot pool. Experiencing side-by-side temperature shifts externally tothe outer surface of your skin (again, not by saturating your internal organswith icy liquids!) is believed to be invigorating in some Eastern traditions, asit promotes enhanced blood flow and great circulation throughout your wholebody. You can do this at home by simply alternating warm and cold water in theshower. Start your shower with a few minutes of warm water, and then shift thedial for 2 minutes of cold water. Make it as cold as you can stand it! Thencontinue alternating, ending your shower with cold water. You will feelrefreshed and energized, and your hair will look shinier (on the days you washit). What an excellent way to start the day—your skin will also be glowing allover!NERVOUS SYSTEM SOOTHING MASSAGE OILJojoba oil is a great carrier oil for most essential oils because it is easilyabsorbed into your skin and is rich in vitamin E. Neroli essential oil is agreat choice for this skin recipe, as research has found neroli helps reduceanxiety and improve sleep quality.2[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c07-nts2] Besides its calming, groundingproperties, it has a lovely sweet and spicy aroma.Combine ½ cup jojoba oil and 40 drops neroli essential oil, using it in yourabhyanga practice or with just a quick, modified hand or foot massage at the endof the day—or whenever you feel you need some soothing."},{"pageContent":"SHIFT 8:ADDRESS SPECIFIC SKIN ISSUESWhile the ingredients we discussed earlier will naturally boost your skin’s glowand vitality, there are some common skin issues that respond well to particularingredients. In this shift, you’ll learn tips to overcome any issues that mightbe plaguing your skin. We’ve also included recipes for masks and tonics thatwere designed specifically for each individual concern.ACNEAcne is an all too common skin condition that can be exacerbated by impuritiesin your blood that push out through your skin, causing breakouts. Here are someof the best ways to cut down on these impurities and create clear, radiant skin:• Reduce consumption of oils in general and high fat, heavy foods. Excessiveoils in the system can aggravate your moisture balance and clog the pores.• Incorporate cumin, turmeric, and ginger when cooking to boost digestion andhelp promote pure, healthy blood.• Eliminate dairy from your diet, which some research has linked to acne.1[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c08-nts1]• Take an excellent probiotic supplement (see this page[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_c02_r1.xhtml#page33]) and an oxygen-magnesiumsupplement (such as Detoxy +), which is a nonlaxative, non-habit-forming, andnonirritating internal cleanser that is free of gluten, animal products, andcorn.Here are a few good skin-care ingredients to target acne:TEA TREE OILThis has antibacterial and soothing properties and is a great alternative tobenzoyl peroxide, which can be drying and irritating.CLAYThis is great, especially in face masks, as it helps to calm the skin andbalance sebum production (see this page[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_c06_r1.xhtml#ind229a] for more details).RADICALLY CLEAR SKIN MASKThe bentonite clay in this mask will help draw out impurities in your skin andbalance oils, while raw honey has both antibacterial and antiseptic properties.1 tablespoon water1 teaspoon raw, organic honey1½ teaspoons bentonite clayMix the water with the honey first, then stir in the clay and mix well to form apaste. Apply to your entire face, being careful to avoid contact with your eyes.Leave on for about 20 minutes, then rinse well.

Turn off the heat, cover, and allow theoregano to steep for 15 minutes. Strain and set aside. Next, puree thecranberries in a food processor or blender (adding a few tablespoons of filteredwater as needed for dried cranberries). Strain through a cheesecloth. Combinethe cranberry puree with the oregano liquid. Soak a washcloth in the liquid,place it on your face, and relax for 15 minutes. (Listen to some calming musicso you aren’t tempted to move around!) Rinse with warm water.BAGS UNDER THE EYESPoor drainage of fluids can contribute to puffy, baggy under-eye circles. It’simportant to keep your circulation working optimally and prevent a buildup offluids, which can be done by eating foods with balanced electrolytes (essentialminerals that affect your body-fluid balance, among other critical processes)and avoiding too much sodium. Bags under the eyes can also mean you have abuildup of impurities from sluggish digestion or overtaxed adrenals, so be sureto incorporate lots of lemons and lemon water to flush out your system and tosupply your body with vitamin C. Before we talk about some of the remedies forthe skin around your eyes, here are some more tips to avoid or improve theexistence of bags under your eyes:• Increase your rest and sleep, especially if you’re a woman on your moon, ormenstrual, cycle; a lack of sleep can exacerbate the visibility of under-eyeissues.• Avoid (or at least cut down as much as possible) on caffeine and alcohol,which can leach minerals from your system and tax your adrenals, contributing tounder-eye bags and circles.• Avoid smoked, grilled, or barbecued foods, which tend to be excessively highin sodium (as well as nitrosamines, which are considered carcinogenic).• Incorporate coconut water, which helps balance electrolytes such as potassiumand sodium.• Hydrate more in general, as some research out of Oxford University has shownthe appearance of the skin under the eyes is linked to kidney health,2[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c08-nts2] and your kidneys function bestin the presence of abundant hydration.• Make sure to incorporate banana into your Glowing Green Smoothie (see thispage [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_c02_r1.xhtml#page27] for recipe), which is highin B vitamins and potassium; these are great for helping to keep your skinsmooth and puffiness at bay.• Cut out refined sugars and use only stevia or raw coconut nectar as your go-tosweeteners. Unlike refined white or artificial sugars, stevia and raw coconutnectar won’t tax your adrenals and cause inflammation, a by-product of which canbe under-eye bags and puffiness.• Avoid consuming other foods with high sodium, such as soy sauce, close tobedtime. This can contribute to greater dehydration throughout the night and cancause you to wake up sporting prominently pronounced under-eye bags.Here are a few good skin-care ingredients to target under-eye bags:PEPTIDESLook for this on ingredient lists. They are great for supporting healthycollagen and elastin in the structure of your skin, which will help it stay tautand less prone to bagginess.TOPICAL COENZYME Q10This can support the amount of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which transportschemical energy between skin cells for improved overall function and enhancedskin repair and regeneration.BAG-BANISHING SKIN TREATMENTAlmond milk is full of vitamin E and is believed to be anti-inflammatory,3[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c08-nts3] while rose water also possessesanti-inflammatory properties and is soothing to the skin, helping to make itsoft and smooth.1 tablespoon rose water1 tablespoon cold almond milkMix the two ingredients together. Dip a washcloth into the mixture and placeover your eyes for 10 minutes in the evening while you lie down and relax.CELLULITEBeyond just a simple accumulation of fat, cellulite can involve the breakdown ofcollagen and the buildup of heavy metals and toxins in fat cells. Many of usbelieve that cellulite is something they just have to live with, and it’s truethat it’s a natural phenomenon in at least 70 percent of people, but there arethings you can do to cut down on the appearance of it. Here are some of the mosteffective methods:• Infrared sauna sessions help penetrate tissues and fat cells and encourageyour body to let go of heavy metals that can expand fat cells.• Perform dry brushing (see this page[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_c07_r1.xhtml#page124]) on a regular basis over thecellulite-infected areas to move stagnant lymph.• Cook only with coconut oil and avoid cooking with vegetable oils that becomerancid at higher temperatures. Rancid oils can be very difficult for your bodyto break down, so they may contribute to excess storage in your fat cells thatcan amplify the appearance of cellulite.There is limited to no scientific proof that cellulite creams actually work, butif you want to try using a cream on top of your other efforts, here are a fewingredients to look into:VITAMIN AThis has been proven to thicken the uppermost skin-cell layer, thereby reducingthe appearance of lumpy cellulite. However, refer back to this page[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_c06_r1.xhtml#page109] for more information onpotential toxicity precautions about vitamin A ingredients. And if you aretrying to conceive or you’re pregnant or nursing, it’s important to forgovitamin A products altogether.CAFFEINEUsed topically, caffeine can improve blood flow to the skin and is purported tohelp reduce the appearance of cellulite.RADICAL ENZYME MASKPineapple has potent detoxifying properties and contains bromelain, aprotein-digesting enzyme that helps exfoliate dead cells and debris. It also hasanti-inflammatory properties and high levels of vitamin C. Papaya containspapain, a natural enzyme that can help to remove and exfoliate dead skin cells,as well as high levels of beta-carotene and vitamin C.You can try applying this mask to cellulite-affected areas. As the enzymes,beta-carotene, and vitamin C support the collagen in those areas, they may helpminimize the appearance of the cellulite over time. This mask is also great foryour complexion. Please note that the enzymes in fresh pineapple are “tingly”and pretty potent, so if you have sensitive skin, be sure to test a tiny areafirst to see if this mask irritates your skin.¼ cup freshly cut pineapple*¼ cup freshly cut papaya*1 teaspoon cold-pressed olive oil1 teaspoon arrowroot flour (also known as starch), or a little more, as needed*Note: The pineapple and papaya must be freshly sliced from a whole fruit forthis mask to be effective. Precut or canned fruit will not work, as the enzymeswill be denatured and some or all of the vitamin C might have oxidized.Blend the pineapple, papaya, and olive oil in a blender until nearly smooth (butdo not overblend or potentially overheat the mixture); because it’s a smallamount, you can also mash the ingredients in a mortar and pestle. Mix with thearrowroot starch until a thicker paste is achieved. Apply the mixtureimmediately to your face and leave on for 15 to 20 minutes before rinsing off.DRY SKINDry skin is a common issue that is often the result of imbalances in your dietor environment. Here are a few of the best ways to keep your skin moisturizedand glowing.• Practice abhyanga regularly (see this page[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_c07_r1.xhtml#page121]) using cold-pressed, unrefinedoils. Be sure to rinse off in the shower afterward before applying anyadditional moisturizer.• Avoid eating too many dry, crispy foods such as crackers, pretzels, and so on.• Make sure you are taking a plant-based omega-3 DHA and EPA supplement.• Incorporate easily digested beauty fats such as avocados, coconut oil, andchia seeds. Make sure you aren’t avoiding fat altogether!• Eat lots of sweet, juicy fruits to hydrate your skin.• Drink lots of room temperature water.• If your home environment is very dry, consider getting a humidifier.• Avoid very hot showers and limit time in hot baths, which can dry out yourskin.• Avoid drying cleansers that can strip your skin of its natural moisturebalance, such as ones that contain alcohol.Here are a few skin-care ingredients to incorporate for dry skin:HYALURONIC ACIDThis is produced naturally in your body and is also found in topical products.It helps attract moisture and keeps your skin moisturized and hydrated.SHEA AND COCONUT BUTTERSThese are two examples of natural, plant-based occlusives that create a thinfilm over the skin, lock in moisture, and slow the evaporation of water lossfrom your skin’s surface, helping to create a barrier against water loss.GRAPE-SEED OILThis is a great natural moisturizer that helps strengthen cell membranes. Itcontains antioxidants, vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients. There are manyother great natural plant oils, including black cumin seed, hemp seed, tamanu,almond, and so on.RADICAL BEAUTY SKIN TEXTURE SMOOTHING MASKCoconut yogurt is a great source of amino acids and probiotics, carrot is highin skin-brightening beta-carotene and antioxidants, and avocado is a rich sourceof nourishing beauty fats, vitamins, and lecithin to nourish dry skin, leavingit feeling soft and smooth. Try applying this mask on a regular basis (ideallyonce a week) to see your skin become smoother with diminished age spots.½ cup coconut yogurt (now commonly found at local health markets)1 avocado, peeled and pitted3 tablespoons raw, organic honey1 organic carrotIn a food processor or blender, combine the ingredients and process until youreach a smooth consistency. Spread over your face and neck and relax for 15 to20 minutes before rinsing.RED PATCHINESSAccording to Ayurveda, red patches are caused by too much Pitta fire present,which may be generated from within by foods that are allergenic or inflammatory.Try eliminating common allergens, such as dairy and gluten, for two weeks andsee if symptoms subside. Here are some additional tips for cutting down on thiscommon skin ailment:• Avoid spicy and pungent foods and spices such as chilies and chili powder tocut down on internal “fire.”• Take probiotics and eat probiotic-rich foods, such as raw sauerkraut (known inthe Beauty Detox community as Probiotic & Enzyme Salad).• To ensure your digestion is efficient and regular, try adding amagnesium-oxygen supplement (such as Detoxy +) in the evenings.• Try adding some turmeric, which has cleansing properties, to your soups andwhen cooking veggies.• Sip warm herbal teas during the day to help keep the microcirculatory channelsflowing and free of toxins.• Drink coconut water, which is cooling.• Incorporate lots of raw greens into your diet, since raw greens are consideredcooling.• Eat sweet, watery fruits such as pineapples and mangoes to help balance theinternal “fire.”• Avoid full body saunas and spa treatments that saturate your face in heat. Thehalf infrared sauna is a great option (see Kimberly’s website forrecommendations at kimberlysnyder. com [http://kimberlysnyder.com]).• Avoid fragrances, dyes, and acids, which can all be irritating to the skin.Here are a few great skin-care ingredients to incorporate for red, patchy skin:• Chamomile and aloe are soothing ingredients for your skin.• Green tea acts as a natural anti-inflammatory and helps neutralize aging andirritating free radicals.RADICAL SOOTHER MASKCucumber, green tea, and chamomile are all cooling, anti-inflammatoryingredients that are fantastic for soothing inflamed skin. You do notnecessarily have to peel an organic cuke, as there is lots of zinc and otherminerals in the skin. As with all recipes in this book and in general, useorganic products as much as possible.2 tablespoons cucumber, peeled and seeded1 teaspoon brewed and cooled green tea (preferably loose leaf)1 teaspoon brewed and cooled chamomile tea (preferably loose leaf)1 tablespoon aloe vera gel1 tablespoon arrowroot flour (also known as starch)Blend the cucumber, green tea, and chamomile tea together (if you have troubleblending such a small amount, just mash the cucumber in a mortar and pestle withthe teas). Mix in the aloe vera gel and arrowroot flour until the mixture startsto thicken. Place in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes to cool. Spread overface and neck in an even layer and relax for about 20 minutes before rinsing itoff.SPIDER VEINSYou can blame your grandmother for these beauties. Poor Granny is sweet andinnocent, and you sure do love that great lady, but the fact is that vein issuesare largely linked to heredity. Most of us never think about our veins and takethem completely for granted. That is, until they start rearing their bluish,unwanted heads up to the surface! There are two main types of cosmeticallyunfortunate vein issues. The first is varicose veins, which can be a moreserious form of venous insufficiency. These can lead to pain and soreness, aswell as restless legs. If these issues have become a problem for you, get themchecked out by your doctor.On the other hand, telangiectasia, commonly known as spider veins, can indicatea much more mild form of venous insufficiency. They are cosmetically a doozy,but are not health- or life-threatening. So what causes these unfortunate bluemalfunctions? Broken-down valves in the veins cause venous insufficiency. Thesemalfunctioning valves prevent blood flow back to the arteries, which can causeblood to accumulate and pool up. Such vein issues can become more pronounced ifone is sedentary or has reduced circulation, and they can even be aggravated byhormonal issues like hormone replacement therapy, pregnancy, or birth control.4[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c08-nts4] Here are some things you can doabout them:• Walk around often to keep circulation flowing.• If you stand still often, look into compression hose to help with support.Some are more visually appealing than others, and you might not want to wearsome of them on your bare legs (at least out in public), but you can certainlywear them under a long skirt or pants.• When showering, massage the area around the broken veins first in a gentlecircular motion and then in an upward motion to help improve circulation. (Avoidthis with painful varicose veins.)• Dry brush your skin, as discussed earlier on this page[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_c07_r1.xhtml#page124], which helps stimulate thegrowth and repair of the tissues and underlying veins by increasing blood flowto the area. It also helps remove the blood that has leaked out of thecapillaries by diffusing it into the interstitial fluids for removal. Brushingthe spider veins very gently in a circular motion then upward toward the heartseveral times per day can improve their appearance.• Vitamins A, B complex, C, D, and E are all great nutrients to help with tissuerepair, optimal circulation, and strong veins. Great sources include carrots,nutritional yeast, mushrooms, almonds, lemons, and bell peppers.• Avoid inflammatory vegetable oils, especially when cooked, which can becomerancid in your body and increase free radicals and cellular damage.• Make sure you eat the right beauty fats, such as avocados, coconut oil, andolive oil (best taken raw and lightly on certain dishes such as salads). Thiscan help you build nice strong cell walls.• Eat pineapple! It contains a dietary enzyme called bromelain, which canimprove overall circulation by reducing the buildup of fibrin along the walls ofthe blood vessels.• Spider veins are often associated with the use of hormone replacement therapy(HRT) and birth control pills. High levels of estrogen from these medicationsseem to aggravate venous insufficiency. If you are using birth control pills,you may want to ask your doctor for a lower-estrogen-dose formula. If you are onHRT, you may want to consider switching to a lower dose, adding progesterone, orusing a weaker formula, such as an estrone cream.• Try to elevate your legs to hip level for a few minutes several times a day.Frequency is more important than the amount of time in this case. Get out of thehabit of crossing your legs, knees, and ankles when seated. If you have a deskjob, try to spend a few minutes walking around every hour. If you have a jobthat requires standing for hours on end, try to sit and elevate your feet to hiplevel once every hour.CIRCULATION AND REJUVENATION MASKChickpea flour has been used in some Ayurvedic recipe preparations for the skinand is believed to help exfoliate and soften it as well as stimulate circulationand rejuvenate tissues. Bananas are a rich, incredible beauty food high in Bvitamins, vitamin A, and minerals such as potassium. Try this simple mask onyour face—or even on the spider-vein areas of your legs—when you want to giveyour skin a revitalization and glow boost.¼ cup mashed ripe banana1 tablespoon organic chickpea flour2 teaspoons sesame oil (or a little more or less, depending on the size of thebanana)Stir the banana into the chickpea flour and mix in the sesame oil. Apply an evenlayer to your face and neck, leaving it on for 15 to 20 minutes while you relax,before rinsing off."},{"pageContent":"SHIFT 9:NOURISH STRONG, HEALTHY HAIR AND NAILSAll of the changes you’ve made so far to your diet and self-care routine willresult in stronger, more naturally beautiful hair and nails. Like your skin, thestrength and vitality of your hair and nails is a reflection of all that ishappening inside your body, and there are many ways to nourish them bothinternally and externally.HOW TO GROW HEALTHY HAIR FROM THE OUTSIDE INIf you want strong, healthy hair, it’s essential to nourish the hair folliclesthat grow your actual hair strands. Go ahead right now and touch your scalp withyour fingers. Give yourself a little head massage. It feels good, right? Yourscalp is rich in nerves and blood vessels. Get familiar with touching your scalpmore than just when you are shampooing. It likes it and will respond! Every partof your body needs love and attention to flourish, and that includes your scalp.If you want lovely hair, you have to give some love to your hair. This includesattention from your hands, not just from products you buy. In all areas of life,love can’t just be bought.Fluctuations in hormones and nutrition, as well as your good old genes, caninfluence the quality and thickness of your hair. The dietary advice in Pillar 1[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_p01_r1.xhtml], Internal Nourishment, will help yougrow more beautiful hair over time. However, there are also manual, externalmethods that you can combine with your dietary shifts to help create beautifullyhealthy, shiny hair. Incorporating these methods from the outside and the insidewill help you grow the beautiful hair that is your birthright.Here are some of the most effective ways to externally nourish your hair.WASH LESS OFTENUnless your hair is incredibly oily, it doesn’t need to be washed every day.Washing a few times a week will keep your hair clean but prevent overdrying,allowing more time for the natural oils in your hair to moisturize down to thetips of your strands.SCALP MASSAGEThis is a fantastic and highly effective way to stimulate your hair folliclesand foster healthy new growth. This can be incorporated easily into your dailyroutine as part of your abhyanga practice (see this page[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_c07_r1.xhtml#page121]). When you are doing your dailyoil massage, be sure to take a few minutes to massage the coconut oil, sesameoil, or specialized herbal formula oil into all areas of your scalp to helpstimulate circulation to your hair follicles. If you want to add a few drops ofessential oil specifically for the scalp-massage part of your treatment, a fewthat are extra stimulating to your hair follicles include lemon, peppermint,lavender, basil, and rosemary pure essential oils. Just adding a few drops intothe oil will suffice. (If you are new to these oils, and especially if you havesensitive skin, be sure to check with your dermatologist or test a tiny area tosee if they irritate your skin.)SOFTENING HAIR SCALP TREATMENTThis is a great treatment to do once a week to help heal and nourish your hair.It’s easy to make and use as part of your hair-care routine. Lavender is healingand nourishing and has been known to relieve tension and headaches when massageddirectly into your scalp. Olive oil makes your hair incredibly soft and willimprove the elasticity of your hair shaft and protect against breakage.⅓ cup cold-pressed olive oil10 to 12 drops lavender essential oilWarm the olive oil in a pan over the lowest setting possible. Turn off andremove from heat and then add the lavender oil. Combine well and massage thewarm mixture into your scalp. Twist your hair into a bun, cover with a showercap, and relax for 20 to 30 minutes before shampooing.USE NATURAL BRISTLESBrushing your hair with a natural bristle brush can help stimulate your hairfollicles and produce more natural oils that lubricate your entire head and allyour beautiful hair strands. Start from the top of your head and worksystematically down the length of your hair. Gently work out tangles rather thanbeing aggressive; you’re not plowing through an overgrown hiking trail. Avoidbreakage by being patient and using even strokes.DEEP CLEANIt’s important to occasionally deep clean your scalp from any dirt and oils thatcan build up and block your hair follicles. Try periodically using a cleansingshampoo made from natural ingredients or applying an apple cider vinegar rinse.Apple cider vinegar is an excellent rinse to use occasionally to removeimpurities from hard water, accumulated sebum, and waxy buildup from products.Pour the apple cider vinegar over your moistened scalp in the shower, massage itin for a couple of minutes, and rinse very well. Then proceed to shampooing andconditioning. You are rinsing it out fairly quickly, but as your scalp canabsorb so much, it’s a great idea to try to source organic vinegar.Vinegar can also help balance the pH of your hair, which affects the appearanceand overall health of your hair. The strands of your hair are made up of keratinprotein. When the pH of your hair is properly balanced, your hair will be asealed, flat cuticle layer on the outside of the strand, which makes your hairmore shiny and bouncy. If your hair’s pH is imbalanced from lots of heat orchemical treatments, your hair will look dull and frizzy and become brittle andsusceptible to more breakage. Try the following pH-Balancing Hair Rinse onceevery six to eight weeks or so (depending on your hair type), or whenever youfeel excessive buildup in your hair. Don’t do it too often, however, or it willdry out your hair.PH-BALANCING HAIR RINSEApple cider vinegar is fantastic for restoring your hair’s pH balance as well ashelping remove any product residue. Rosemary helps stimulate the scalp andpromote hair growth.1 cup organic apple cider vinegar15 drops rosemary oil¾ cup warm waterCombine the ingredients and pour over damp hair, being careful not to get therinse into your eyes or on your face. Massage for a few moments and rinse out.TOP INGREDIENTS FOR HAIR CARETo pinpoint the best possible ingredients in shampoos and conditioners to helpnourish your hair, it’s important to look beyond the slogans and prettypackaging devised by marketing companies. Of course, the products you choosemust match your individual hair type, but there are some ingredients that areknown to work universally well for different types of hair. Products includingthese ingredients can be sourced at health stores, but they also areincreasingly common and easy to find at your local grocery store or pharmacy.SHEA BUTTERThis is a great natural emollient. It coats the surface of your hair strandswith oil, reducing the amount of water that is lost so that your hair stayshydrated and luscious.COCONUT OILThis is a perfect fatty emollient to seal moisture into your hair. Coconut oilhelps make your hair shiny and healthier.PURE ALOE VERA GELGreat for soothing your scalp and hair follicles, aloe vera is said to alsocontain an enzyme that stimulates hair follicles, helping to promote healthyhair growth.VEGETABLE GLYCERINThis acts as a natural humectant, meaning it attracts water and acts as aprotective moisture layer, which will help your hair stay moisturized whileavoiding frizziness.JOJOBAThis is a great natural hair oil, which can soothe damaged ends and make yourhair look shiny but not greasy by balancing your hair’s oil production.CASTOR OILThis is a humectant and an antifungal that helps prepare the hair for bettergrowth.CERAMIDESCeramides mend damaged and broken hair fibers by “gluing” them back together andreinforcing your hair’s structure. They also help to smooth out frizzy orunmanageable hair.ANTIOXIDANTSAntioxidants work great inside your body and also help to nourish your hair fromthe outside. Applied topically, antioxidants can help protect your hair fromfree radicals and even protect the integrity of your hair’s vital color.HYALURONIC ACIDPopularly used in skin care (see this page[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_c06_r1.xhtml#ind229a]), hyaluronic acid is also usefulfor beautiful hair, as it helps to lock hydration into your hair strands.ACIDIC INGREDIENTSIn this case, acidity can be a good thing! Just as applying apple cider vinegarcan cleanse your hair follicles of debris and balance your hair’s natural pH,other natural acids in shampoo, such as sodium citrate or citric acid, performthe same functions on a milder, more regular basis.PANTHENOLPanthenol is a form of vitamin B that treats and prevents damage to your hairfrom pollution, free radicals, and sun exposure. It’s water soluble, penetratingthe hair and acting as a great moisturizer that locks moisture into your hairafter cleansing.ZINCYou can ingest the essential trace element zinc from eating nuts and seeds, suchas pumpkin seeds. In shampoo, zinc can soothe the scalp, fight chronic dandruff,and regulate excess sebum, thereby preventing excessively oily hair and evenhair loss that results from clogged hair follicles.RADICAL BEAUTY TIP: KEEP YOUR TRESSES SHINYEveryone loves hot showers. That’s all good, but be sure to end your shower witha cool rinse. (See this page [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_c07_r1.xhtml#ind529a] toread why alternating temperatures in the shower is a great beauty practice ingeneral.) The cool water will tighten up your hair follicles and cuticle,keeping your hair shinier. Plus, you will feel refreshed!HAIR INGREDIENTS TO AVOIDYour hair follicles are very vacuolated, meaning they are rich in blood vesselsthat are close to the surface of your scalp. Therefore, whatever is in your hairproducts is quickly absorbed into your bloodstream and into your system. Beingaware of the toxic additives in many common hair products and avoiding them goeshand in hand with eating organic foods. It’s important to avoid toxins fromentering and circulating around your precious body from any source so they donot in any way, shape, or form detract from your natural beauty. Unfortunately,there are thousands of chemicals used in different hair-care products, so it’sup to you to scan ingredient labels and be on the lookout. Here are some of themost common harmful ingredients that are important to avoid.SULFATESUgh. These nasty, cheaply produced chemicals, which include sodium laurylsulfate (SLS), sodium laureth sulfate (SLES), and other forms of sulfate, areused in shampoos (as well as floor cleaners, engine degreasers, and kitchendegreasers like dishwasher soaps) to create foam. It’s easy to love a foamyshampoo and feel like you’re really cleaning your hair, right? But sulfates canbe considered a toxin that creates irritation and itching, as well as moreserious issues. A report from the Journal of the American College of Toxicologynotes that this ingredient has a “degenerative effect on the cell membranesbecause of its protein denaturing properties,”1[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c09-nts1] and that “high levels of skinpenetration may occur at even low use concentration.”2[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c09-nts2] Some studies have noted thatsulfates can enter and maintain residual levels in the heart, liver, lungs, andbrain from skin contact, and by depositing on the skin surface and in the hairfollicles, they can cause damage to the hair follicle.3[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c09-nts3],4[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c09-nts4] Other research has shown thatsulfates can create irritation to and impair your immune system.5[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c09-nts5]ETHYL AND ISOPROPYL ALCOHOLSThese petroleum-based alcohols can be very dehydrating to your hair, leaving itdry and eventually leading to breakage. Certain nonvolatile or fatty alcohols,however, such as cetyl alcohol, are okay, as they have a higher carbon count sothey are oily and actually condition hair. Be sure to check labels for specificnames.FORMALDEHYDECommonly used as a preservative (you might recall the lab rat you dissected inhigh school biology was embalmed in this), it irritates the skin and can causeinflammation, joint pain, allergies, chronic fatigue, and dizziness.6[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c09-nts6] It is also considered apotential carcinogen. Stay away! (Be sure to avoid nail polishes that containformaldehyde, too.)RADICAL BEAUTY TIP: HAIR CARE IN THE SUNJust like your skin, your hair needs adequate sun protection to prevent it fromdrying out and becoming brittle, damaged, and discolored from overexposure tothe sun. There are some sunscreens made for the hair, but the easiest and mosteffective way to prevent sun damage to your hair is to wear hats! This isespecially important when you are out in the sun for extended periods of time.From sun hats to boleros and beyond, you’ll be able to express your personalstyle and protect your precious hair, all at the same time.IMIDAZOLIDINYL UREA AND DMDM HYDANTOINOn that note, these two ingredients are preservatives that release formaldehyde,so look for them as well on ingredient lists.PROPYLENE GLYCOL (PG)PG is a form of mineral oil. This is a controversial ingredient that somebelieve has some immunotoxicity concerns.7[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c09-nts7] It comes in different grades,including an industrial grade that is part of commercial products such as enginecoolants, antifreeze, and various enamels and varnishes. For beauty products, ithelps to drive ingredients down into the hair (or skin) for deeper penetration.It may break down the proteins that make up your hair in the process (obviouslythe opposite of what you want!), and also may create allergic reactions orirritations.8 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c09-nts8]POLYETHYLENE GLYCOL (PEG)PEG is included in shampoos to help dissolve oils, but it can overstrip yourhair, leaving it vulnerable and weak.DIETHANOLAMINE (DEA), MONOETHANOLAMINE (MEA), AND TRIETHANOLAMINE (TEA)Does this remind you of the song “Do-Re-Mi” from The Sound of Music? Theserhyming ingredients are not happy like the song. They are, in fact, potentialhormone disruptors and irritants9[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c09-nts9] and can be absorbed into yourhair follicles and enter your body. These ingredients are “foamers,” so they’renot necessarily even great for your hair, per se, but are included solely forthe experience of using them. But really, you should never have to choosebetween foaming shampoo and your health. Got a shampoo with any of thesethree-letter acronyms? Into the trash it goes!FRAGRANCEThis is a tough one because we understand that you want your hair to smellawesome. But fragrance is a generic term for up to 3,100 stock chemicalingredients,10 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c09-nts10] many of whichare synthetic and toxic. You really don’t know exactly what is in your shampooor conditioner with just “fragrance” on the ingredient list, so you risk gettingheadaches, dizziness, rashes, and a number of allergic reactions. Tests offragrance ingredients have found an average of fourteen hidden compounds performulation, including ingredients linked to hormone disruption and spermdamage.11 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c09-nts11] Exposure to thesetypes of chemicals can adversely affect your central nervous system and evenaffect your mood, making you more irritable. No good-smelling shampoo is worthbeing moody! Check out products with essential oils, which smell great and arenontoxic.NATURALLY BEAUTIFUL TEETH AND GUMSA beautiful smile stemming from authentic joy is one of the most compellingfeatures you can possess. Feeling confident about your teeth can help you smilemore naturally. Oil pulling, or swishing sesame or another oil around your mouthfor a few minutes in the morning before spitting it out, is something you canincorporate into your morning routine to help keep your mouth beautiful. It isanother increasingly popular ancient Ayurvedic practice that benefits yourmouth, teeth, and gum health.Oil pulling is believed to encourage detoxification by attracting, binding, andremoving bacteria, toxins, and parasites from your mouth (where a lot ofbacteria tend to accumulate) and lymph system, while helping to clear out mucusand congestion from your throat and sinuses. Some even believe that oil pullingcan help activate the vagus nerve, which sends information between your brainand the enteric nervous system in your gut, which controls digestion.Stimulating the vagus nerve is said to activate anti-inflammatory pathways inthe digestive tract.12 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c09-nts12]Directions for oil pulling are simple:1. Warm 1 to 2 teaspoons (or a bit less, if you have a tiny mouth!) of pure,cold-pressed sesame oil. (You can do this by parceling the sesame oil you areusing into a small vial, and then holding the vial under hot water for a fewseconds.)2. Swish the warmed oil vigorously around all parts of your mouth and back andforth across your gums for 2 to 6 minutes. Don’t move it into your throat, andresist the temptation to gargle! Although sometimes you hear recommendations toswish the oil for far longer, traditional Ayurvedic teachings believe that isunnecessary. When you are done, spit out the oil into the garbage.In addition to oil pulling, another component of the Ayurvedic morning routineis chewing 2 or 3 teaspoons of black sesame seeds, moving them around the entirespan of your teeth, for 1 to 3 minutes before spitting them out. This isbelieved to help polish, strengthen, and mineralize the teeth; remove stains;and also keep your gums healthy. The black sesame seeds are extremely high incalcium, as well as phosphorus, iron, and magnesium.RADICAL BEAUTY NAIL CAREIt’s important to take care of your hands and nails, which are an extension ofyour beauty. They undergo a great deal of daily wear and tear, from relentlessexposure to heat and cold to abrasive soaps and excessive water from handwashing and detergents.RADICAL BEAUTY NAIL WHITENING TIPTo brighten yellowed nails, try scrubbing them with white vinegar.Your nails are largely made of a tough protective coating called keratin. Aproper diet and excellent circulation are of utmost importance for growinghealthy, strong nails. There are also great external ways to support nailhealth:• Rather than cutting cuticles, soak your nails in warm water to soften cuticlesand then gently push them back. Only trim off hanging, dead skin when necessary.• Look for polishes free of the “toxic trio”: dibutyl phthalate (DBP), toluene,and formaldehyde, which have been associated with development and reproductiveissues and dizziness and are potential hormone disruptors and carcinogens.13[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c09-nts13] Look for brands labeled “DBP-,toluene-, and formaldehyde-free” or, specifically, “three-free.” There are evenvegan polishes free of solvents and other toxins, including some that are“ten-free,” and some that are water-based. (You may need to reapply these moreoften due to chipping.)• Avoid frequent use of nail polish removers, which can dry your nail bed,leading to potential splits. Also look for nail polish removers that are free ofacetone.• Avoid quick-dry nail polishes that contain a great deal of acetone, which candry out your nails.• Use gloves when washing the dishes, and otherwise try to keep your hands outof hot water as much as possible.• Before going out into the cold, always moisturize your hands and protect themwith gloves. Avoid direct exposure to cold air.• Massage and moisturize your nails and cuticles with almond, jojoba, or coconutoil often.Nail Strengthening ScrubThe combination of castor and avocado oils enhances nails’ flexibility andrenders them more pliable and less prone to chips and breakage. Ground walnutsare high in nourishing omega-3 fatty acids, while the walnuts themselves help toslough off dead surface cells, allowing more moisture and nutrients to beabsorbed. Honey is nourishing and softening, and it also contains antibacterialand antiseptic properties.¼ cup raw, shelled walnuts1 tablespoon castor oil1 tablespoon first cold-pressed avocado oil1 teaspoon raw, organic honeyGrind walnuts to form a coarse powder. Mix in the oils and the honey to make athick paste. Rub your entire nails, hands, and cuticles vigorously (but not inan overly abrasive way) for a few moments before rinsing with warm water.

This pillar will go intogreat detail about how sleep specifically affects your natural beauty and how toharness its power to look and feel radically beautiful. The word peak is oftenused in reference to the highest level of athletic performance, or “peakperformance.” As we are referring to it here in reference to beauty, peak meansexperiencing the optimal level and quality of sleep to fully support yourbeauty.While you already know that excellent sleep is important, you may stillunknowingly employ tactics that keep you from getting your best sleep. Many ofus whittle into our sleeping hours by going to bed later than we should. Inpart, this is because we tend to prioritize cramming more activity and tasksinto the day: cleaning up the kitchen or e-mail box, catching up on work,watching an extra television show, surfing the Internet, online shopping, orwhatever else it may be. This often pushes bedtime later and later. At the sametime, we shave our sleep away on the other end by rising earlier and earlier inthe morning to tend to small children, fit in a workout, or simply get to work.No matter how much sleep you’ve been getting up until now, going forward youmust shift your priorities in order to start getting peak beauty sleep. In thispillar you’ll learn how creating peak beauty sleep can help you lose weight ormaintain your ideal weight, improve your metabolism and your immunity, betterrepair damaged tissues or cells (including in your skin), and delay disease andaging, all around working to increase your beauty. You’ll also learn the mosteffective tips and tools to optimize your beauty sleep, which is key in allowingyour most beautiful self to shine through. Hopefully, by the end of this pillar,your perspective on sleep will have radically shifted."},{"pageContent":"SHIFT 10:UNDERSTAND THE SLEEP-BEAUTY-WELLNESS CONNECTIONHOW MUCH SLEEP DO YOU REALLY NEED?No matter how you slice it, most of us aren’t getting enough sleep. The NationalSleep Foundation suggests that on average adults need about 7 to 9 hours ofsleep per night.1 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c10-nts1] This is ageneral recommendation, and you may need more than that depending on yourindividual constitution, but unfortunately most of us don’t get that much.(Contrary to popular belief, only a small fraction of the population can get byfor extended periods on less than 7 hours of sleep at night.) Healthy sleep isalso uninterrupted, not the kind where you wake up several times a night. Datafrom the National Health Interview Survey concluded that at least 30 percent ofAmerican adults don’t get enough sleep. This 30 percent reported only 6 or fewerhours of sleep per night.2 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c10-nts2]Ironically, there’s been a lot of talk lately that oversleeping can be harmful.In 2002, a study resurfaced that found that people who slept 6.5 to 7.4 hourshad lower rates of mortality compared with people who slept either fewer than 4hours or greater than 8.3 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c10-nts3] Butbefore assuming that getting more than 8 hours is “bad,” it is important to knowthat this study was conducted on cancer patients. This might have shifted theresults, as those with cancer likely have different sleep needs than the generalpublic. In those with high mortality rates, the lack of sleep or excessiveamount of sleep might have been a symptom of the patients’ illness and not thecause. This shows how important it is to look at studies very carefully beforemaking broad assumptions, especially as they relate to lifestyle shifts.Meanwhile, a growing number of researchers don’t believe there is such a thingas oversleeping. Dr. Sigrid Veasey of the University of Pennsylvania’s Centerfor Sleep and Circadian Neurobiology puts it bluntly: “You can never get ‘toomuch’ sleep. When you have had enough sleep, you will wake up.”There are other interesting findings as well. Researchers at Stanford Universitystudied the impact of playing sports while involved in academics. The result isthat players often get little sleep. They conducted an experiment in which theplayers slept 10 hours a night for a five- to seven-week period instead of theirusual 6 hours. The results showed that their speed and accuracy, as well astheir physical, mental, and emotional well-being, all grew measurably better.4[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c10-nts4] It’s no surprise, then, thatmany top athletes, including Usain Bolt, Michael Phelps, LeBron James, and RogerFederer, report getting upward of 10 to 12 hours of sleep a night.You may be asking yourself, What does this have to do with beauty? Well,athletes need to allow their bodies to rest and rejuvenate to reach peakcondition for their athletic competitions. Likewise, rest and rejuvenation iskey for all of your body’s functions to perform at their peak. This has a directimpact on your beauty. An article published on Harvard Medical School’s websiteexplains that major restorative functions, “like muscle growth, tissue repair,protein synthesis, and growth hormone release occur mostly, or in some casesonly, during sleep.”5 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c10-nts5]Ultimately, you must listen to your body to see how much sleep you personallyneed. It might be 8 hours or possibly even 9 or 10. It is completely individual.You may wonder where you could possibly find more time to get additional sleep,but it is often possible to cut out unnecessary evening activities and simply goto bed earlier. Television is one thing that takes up so much time for mostpeople but is completely unproductive. It may sound radical to suggest giving upTV entirely, but it might be easier than you think and could profoundly improveyour life.Once you have a deeper understanding of how strongly sleep can impact yourbeauty and overall wellness, you will likely feel compelled to really prioritizeyour sleep.THE EFFECTS OF TOO LITTLE SLEEPIf you consistently get fewer than the ideal number of hours of sleep for you,here’s what you are most likely dealing with.ACCELERATED AGINGIf you’ve ever wanted actual scientific documentation for the phenomenon ofbeauty sleep, here it is: A study published in 2015 assessed actual skin aging,and the subjects whose sleep was deemed “good” were found to have lower skinaging scores. This included a 30 percent higher barrier of recovery whencompared with poor sleepers.6 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c10-nts6]In another fascinating clinical trial from the University Hospitals Case MedicalCenter in Cleveland, Ohio, a direct connection was found between poor sleep andaccelerating aging, especially of the skin.7[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c10-nts7] Researchers examined sixtypremenopausal women between the ages of thirty and forty-nine8[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c10-nts8] who fell into either a “poor”or “quality” sleep group, based on sleep length and overall excellence. Theydiscovered that the poor sleepers showed twice as many signs of aging as thosein the quality sleep group. These measurements included fine lines, unevenpigmentation, slackening of skin, and reduced elasticity.9[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c10-nts9] They also found that those inthe quality sleep group recovered more efficiently from damage and otherstressors like exposure to the sun.10[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c10-nts10] This shows that sun is not theonly big issue with skin aging. Other factors, such as the quality of yoursleep, may reduce your skin’s ability to recover from sunlight exposure.Need more proof? A study at Sweden’s University of Stockholm found that sleepdeprivation produced visible signs of aging, including increased hangingeyelids, darker circles under the eyes, more wrinkles and fine lines, swolleneyes, and more pronounced droopy corners of the mouth.11[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c10-nts11] Anything that promotes the useof the word droopy to describe your face must obviously be avoided as much aspossible!WEIGHT GAINIn general, those who do not sleep well tend to weigh more than those who getgood levels of sleep.12 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c10-nts12] AUniversity Hospitals Case Medical Center clinical trial found that poor sleeperswere nearly twice as likely to be overweight than those who slept well. In theirstudy, 23 percent of the “good quality” sleepers were obese, versus 44 percentin the group that reported poor sleep quality.13[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c10-nts13] A Wisconsin Sleep Cohort studyfound that as hours of sleep per night went down, body mass index (BMI) went upproportionally.14 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c10-nts14] This furtherdisputes the vastly oversimplified approach that what is on your plate and howmuch you work out are the only factors that determine your weight.In another study published in the American Journal of Epidemiology, women whoslept 5 hours or less a night had a 15 percent higher risk of becoming obesethan women who slept 7 hours a night. Over the course of the sixteen-year study,the women who got less sleep also had a 30 percent higher risk of gaining 30pounds than the women who got 7 hours of sleep per night.15[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c10-nts15]You may be wondering exactly how sleep affects your weight. It turns out that alack of proper sleep can disrupt the key hormones that control appetite, makingthose who sleep poorly more hungry than those who sleep well through thenight.16 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c10-nts16] A study published inthe Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism looked at the connectionbetween sleep and the hormone leptin, which controls appetite, and found thatcirculating levels of leptin in your body are influenced by the quality of yoursleep.17 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c10-nts17] This means that themore sleep you get, the better your body becomes at sensing when it is full.The connection between sleep duration, body weight, metabolism, and specifichormones was backed up by a team of researchers from the Stanford UniversitySchool of Medicine, who found that getting less sleep can lead to higher levelsof ghrelin, a hormone that triggers appetite, and lower levels of leptin, whichtells your body it’s full, as well as an increased BMI.18[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c10-nts18] In other words, the less yousleep, the hungrier you will be and the more food it will take to make you feelfull!The Harvard School of Public Health suggests that not getting enough sleep leadsto other factors that contribute to weight gain. For example, people who don’tsleep enough may be too exhausted to exercise, leading to weight gain. Orperhaps these people simply have more opportunities to eat since they spend morehours of the day awake. And we’ve all experienced pesky food cravings. Whensleep deprived, you may feel more emotional, fatigued, and susceptible tocravings. One study showed that the amygdala, a set of neurons in the brainresponsible for emotional reactions in the decision-making process, was moreactive when subjects did not get adequate sleep.19[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c10-nts19]Interestingly, the ease with which you gain weight or maintain a healthy weightmay be related to childhood sleep patterns. A recent study in the Archives ofPediatrics and Adolescent Medicine found that not getting enough sleep in earlylife (through preschool) can be a long-term risk factor for obesity throughoutlife.20 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c10-nts20] The study also foundthat napping was not a viable substitute for nighttime sleep as it relates toobesity prevention.21 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c10-nts21] If youare a parent, you can rest assured that your perhaps frequent bedtime battlesare well worth it for the sake of your child’s long-term health.HORMONAL IMBALANCEHormones are chemicals that are produced by different organs and glands and sendimportant signals to different parts of the body. As hormones largely regulaterepairs that take place in the body, impacting how you look and feel, it isessential to balance your hormones in order to express your Radical Beauty.Hormones can be compared to keys that “unlock” certain cells but not others.Like keys, different cells fit with specific hormones. When the “key” is turnedand the cell is “unlocked,” it receives a signal to multiply, make proteins orenzymes, or perform other vital tasks, including releasing other hormones. Thereis a high level of intelligence with hormones. Some may fit with many types ofcells but have different effects on each type of cell. For example, a hormonemay stimulate one type of cell to perform a task, while the same hormone turnsoff a different type of cell. To complicate this even more, the way a cellresponds to a specific hormone may change over time.While, thankfully, our bodies and all their intrinsic parts perform their dutieswithout us having to direct them, it’s important that we create an idealenvironment for our hormones to function properly. The National Institute onAging teaches us that hormone production fluctuates during the day and alsoduring different points in your life.22[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c10-nts22] While some naturalfluctuations are normal, we want to avoid the unnatural variations that occur ifyou don’t get enough sleep on a consistent basis. Restoration is key to yourall-around well-being and for your natural beauty to express itself.It’s been well documented that inadequate sleep can negatively affect certainhormone levels in the body.23,[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c10-nts23]24[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c10-nts24] In addition to its effects onthe hormones that control appetite, a lack of sleep causes your body to produceexcess amounts of the hormone cortisol, which can break down your skin cells andcontribute to various skin issues.25[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c10-nts25] Cortisol is a stress hormonethat tends to accumulate around the stomach, unfortunately leading to weightgain specifically in the belly area, as stomach fat cells are sensitive tocortisol and store excess energy there.26[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c10-nts26]Another hormone affected by sleep is called HGH, or human growth hormone. Thisis an important hormone for beauty because it helps your skin grow thicker,healthier, and more elastic or pliable in texture, which further helps toprotect against wrinkling. Natural production of HGH also helps with musclebuilding and tissue repair. Unfortunately, disturbed sleep can inhibit yournatural production of HGH.27 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c10-nts27]This can make it more difficult for your body to build lean muscle andresilient, youthful skin.WEAKENED IMMUNE SYSTEMA growing body of research is finding a strong relationship between sleep andimmunity.28 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c10-nts28] Increasingevidence shows that inadequate sleep leads to a weakened immune response.29[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c10-nts29] Sleep may help facilitate theredistribution of T-cells to lymph nodes.30[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c10-nts30] T-cells are a vital part ofour immune system that help maintain our wellness and vitality, and the moreefficiently they travel through the lymphatic system, the better. Since ourentire population appears to be suffering from a sleep deficit, our immunitymust be reduced across the population as a whole. Can you imagine the healthimplications for our entire society if we all slept better? The entire health ofthe community would be bolstered, and health-care costs might be dramaticallyreduced! But this very much has to start with you.Getting sick isn’t just inconvenient or annoying; it can also be aging. Sometheorize that diseases and routine illnesses like the common cold can actuallycreate free radicals in your body.31[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c10-nts31] When these sicknesses occur,your immune system creates free radicals on purpose to help neutralize harmfulviruses and bacteria. But those free radicals also create cellular damage andcontribute to the visible effects of aging. In other words, minimizing andavoiding getting sick isn’t just to benefit your health; it can be anotherpowerful tool in your anti-aging arsenal.SLUGGISH DETOXIFICATIONSleep gives your body the rest it needs to perform its vital functions, such asdetoxification. It is therefore critical to help promote optimal detoxificationand clear metabolic waste from your system.32[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c10-nts32] As you know, the more detoxedand cleansed your internal body is, the more beautiful you will become.POOR PERFORMANCEIt’s well established that sleep improves your performance and alertness.33[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c10-nts33] When you sleep more, you’lldrive more safely, and your memory will improve, too.34[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c10-nts34] Reduced sleep means you aren’table to perform at your highest potential for all tasks in life. If you aren’table to feel as present and alert at work, when working on your creativepursuits, while playing with your children, or during your workouts, it’s veryfrustrating and reflects a diminishing quality of your life.ANXIETY AND DEPRESSIONPoor sleep can also contribute to worsening anxiety.35[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c10-nts35] In a parallel fashion,insomnia, the extreme end of bad sleep, may be a risk factor for full-blownanxiety disorders.36 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c10-nts36] On theopposite end of the spectrum, when you feel fully rested and consistently getenough sleep, it’s easier to feel calm and present. Calmness helps you dealbetter with stressors in life, and as we discussed earlier, dealing with stressbetter helps delay aging all around.For someone suffering from depression, bad and irregular sleep is often part ofthe disorder. In fact, some recent therapies focus on loss of good sleep as thefirst sign that a bout of depression may soon occur. This onset can be avertedby paying close attention to good sleep before the depression actually hits. Isgood sleep a preventive for depression? That’s not agreed upon, but it’sdefinitely worth trying to incorporate.PERMANENT BRAIN DAMAGEAn aging brain leads to less vitality overall, and vitality is a big componentof being your most Radically Beautiful. Researchers at Duke-NUS Graduate MedicalSchool Singapore (Duke–National University of Singapore) found a relationshipbetween the fewer hours of sleep adults get and accelerated aging in thebrain.37 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c10-nts37]Most of us presume that a few nights of missed sleep are not a big deal. Wethink we can recover by getting more sleep in the future. But a study fromresearchers at the University of Pennsylvania found otherwise.38[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c10-nts38] The lead researcher, SigridVeasey, MD, notes, “This is the first report that sleep loss can actually resultin a loss of neurons.”39 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c10-nts39] Shecontinues, “No one really thought that the brain could be irreversibly injuredfrom sleep loss. In general, we’ve always assumed full recovery of cognitionfollowing short- and long-term sleep loss. But some of the research in humanshas shown that attention span and several other aspects of cognition may notnormalize even with three days of recovery sleep, raising the question oflasting injury in the brain.”40[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c10-nts40] Whoa…now this is a prettystrong reason not to put off sleep!Sleep deprivation is considered a constant stressor to your system and has beenshown in some research to reduce the capacity for learning and memory. Reducingsleep deprivation is even hypothesized to help prevent or slow the progressionof Alzheimer’s disease.41 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c10-nts41] Ofcourse, the sharper and more alert your brain is, the more powerful andconfident in your beauty you will be.All of these findings help us to understand how the most basic of nature’srhythms contributes to every aspect of life. But please don’t be alarmed. Thisshift was not meant to frighten you with the disastrous effects of getting toolittle sleep, but rather to open your eyes to all of the benefits you’ll soonsee from getting more, better quality sleep. In the next shift, you’ll learn howto tune in to your body’s natural rhythms in order to achieve Peak Beauty Sleep."},{"pageContent":"SHIFT 11:TUNE IN TO YOUR BODY’S NATURAL RHYTHMSNATURE’S TIMETABLEBeing more in tune with our natural rhythms aligns us to nature’s power andbeauty. It’s easy to think of nature’s power in a dramatic flash of lightning orin the heat of the sun, but equal to this power is the strength of rejuvenation.We need to harness this power to retract and go inward in order to have the mosteffective, deep sleep that fuels our creative power and allows our naturalbeauty to fully shine through.Radical Beauty is about living in harmony with nature’s inherent wisdom. From asleep perspective, this means that the more in tune you are with natural light,the better. This shifts every season with the influence and timing of the sunand the larger bodies of energy beyond our planet. The sun coordinates themovement of the Earth around its axis, which influences the larger seasonalshifts as well as the daily shifts that create longer and shorter days. Eventhough these planetary bodies may seem unfathomably far away from the averageperson, they actually exert their influence on our bodies. Since we possess allof the main elements found in nature, Ayurveda believes we are miniaturerepresentations of the whole universe, the entire cosmos.Circadian rhythms are physical, mental, and behavioral changes in living beings(including not only animals but also plants and microbes) that follow a roughly24-hour cycle. These are produced by natural factors in the body and respond tosignals from the environment. The main external signal affecting circadianrhythms is light, which influences the turning on and off of an organism’sinternal clock. Circadian rhythms influence sleep patterns, hormone release,body temperature, and other important bodily functions, while abnormal circadianrhythms have been associated with sleep disorders, obesity, diabetes,depression, bipolar disorder, and seasonal affective disorder.1[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c11-nts1]Circadian rhythms are important for us to consider in promoting Peak BeautySleep. If we live in tune with our natural body clocks and circadian rhythms, wewill naturally be more active in the morning and wind down in the evening. Anideal time to work out, for instance, is in the morning, around the rising lightand rising energy, or in the middle of the day, in the peak of sunlight, asopposed to late in the evening, when the sun is naturally descending, indicatinga return inward toward relaxation. Late workouts can be overly stimulating andwake you up rather than bring you closer to sleep.The brain’s electrical response to rhythmic sensory stimulation, such as pulsesof sound or light,2 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c11-nts2]synchronizes with the natural, rhythmic changes in our environment. Our health,down to the minute cellular level, depends on the degree to which we are inharmony with the natural cycles of daytime and nighttime. Even basic functionsin our body that we often take for granted, such as our blood pressure, immunesystem functions, and cellular growth, all depend on our rhythmic melatonincycle. This in turn depends on syncing up properly with nature’s rhythms. Weare, after all, inseparably one with nature.ARTIFICIAL LIGHT: FRIEND OR FOE?When you consider the fact that Thomas Edison successfully tested the firstelectric lamp in 1879,3 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c11-nts3] youmight be a little jolted (pun intended) to realize that artificial lightshaven’t been around very long in the broad scope of human evolution. While thebenefits of electricity are enormous and obvious, it has also introduced a setof health and beauty issues. This is due to the fact that artificial lightingallows us to experience daytime around the clock if we wish, making uscompletely out of tune with the natural rhythms of the planet.The body’s master clock is made up of about 20,000 neurons, with sleep signalstraveling from the pons, an area at the base of the brain, to the thalamus andthen on to the thinking part of the brain, the cortex.4[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c11-nts4] The pineal gland producesmelatonin, a hormone that communicates to the body information about lightlevels in the outside world. The light seen by your eyes influences how yourbrain interprets this information. When your body clock senses a decrease inlight, ideally in the evenings, it signals your brain to produce more melatoninto induce drowsiness and sleep.But now we are in an age where we are exposed to numerous new assailants on ourinner sleep mechanism, including illuminated smartphones, tablets, e-readers,and laptops. We use these devices often right in our beds and directly beforebedtime with increasing frequency. The eye is registering daytime levels oflight later and later at night. A National Sleep Foundation survey found thatnine out of ten Americans reported using a technological device in the hoursbefore bed.5 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c11-nts5] With the increasedlight stimulation to our brains, hormones, and entire being, how can we expectthe body to maintain normal sleep patterns?The result is that we’ve lost the connection to our natural rhythms and thecycles of the environment around us. It’s important to refoster that connection.While your life might be extremely busy and hectic, shifting your schedule asmuch as possible toward going to bed closer to sunset and waking up closer tosunrise will help you align and synergize with the higher power of universalnature. Closer is the key word here, as it might seem impossible in modern lifeto go to bed at sunset and rise right at sunrise. But start with the baby stepof going to bed half an hour earlier and waking up half an hour earlier. Alsotry at least eating dinner earlier, closer to sunset, which is also helpful forsyncing closer to natural rhythms.YIN AND YANG: HOW THE DAY AFFECTS THE NIGHTExposure to natural light during the day is important as a contrast to the darkcycles of the night. This helps promote overall healthy sleep and waking cycles.If you want to have a peaceful nightly rhythm of sleeping, you have to alsobalance the opposite, the daylight. It’s important to have exposure to naturallight on a regular basis. Just as our sleep rhythms have become corrupted byartificial light exposure long after daylight has naturally reduced, so ourdaily rhythms have been worn away by minimized exposure to natural light. Mostof us spend the vast majority of our days indoors under artificial lights.The neurotransmitter in our brain called serotonin increases with the light ofeach day. Serotonin influences daily and nightly rhythms, memory, appetite, andso on—in essence, all the factors that play a part in our internal rhythms. Theamount of melatonin made available to the body in response to the darkness ofthe night actually depends on the concentration of serotonin secreted inresponse to the natural light we are exposed to during the day. Serotonin isbroken down into melatonin, so there is a beautifully coordinated, naturalrhythm present between the cycles of serotonin and melatonin, which depend oneach other and are controlled by a changing environment.THE IMPORTANCE OF COLORClearly, avoiding artificial light around bedtime is important for Peak BeautySleep, but interestingly, it turns out that not all light is created equal. Infact, using light color strategically might be helpful in smoothing outnervous-system activity.6 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c11-nts6]Research on the “color temperature” of light and its effects on the brainsuggests that the “temperature” of the light is more important than itsbrightness. This means that on a color spectrum, yellow-white through red lights(which are considered low-color-temperature lights) have a far less detrimentaleffect on our systems than the blue lights on the other end of the spectrum.Research has now pinpointed that electronics emanate blue light, which affectsthe brain more strongly than other colors and, in particular, disturbs oursleep. In other words, reducing light all around can be very helpful, but it’scritical to reduce blue light specifically. Unfortunately, blue light is emittedstrongly and consistently from many different electronic devices. Using thesedevices near bedtime can have a detrimental effect on your sleep patterns andconsequently your natural beauty expression.A photoreceptor in the eye called melanopsin plays a role in establishing ourday/night cycles and is particularly sensitive to a narrow band of blue light inthe 460–480 nanometers (nm) range.7[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c11-nts7] Researchers at the Universityof Pennsylvania School of Medicine and School of Arts and Sciences studied thebiological effects of blue light8[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c11-nts8] and found that melanopsin isvery sensitive to blue light, which is emitted by digital devices, includingsmartphones, tablets, and computers.9[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c11-nts9]This means that if you work on a tablet or laptop, or look at your smartphonebefore bed, you might find your sleep is delayed. This results in all of theadverse beauty and wellness implications we mentioned earlier, includingaccelerated aging, reduced performance in all your tasks,10[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c11-nts10] and suppression of naturalhuman growth hormone, which you need to increase muscle mass and induce tissuerepair.ELECTRONICS AND SLEEP DON’T MIXAn alarming 51 percent of people who text specifically in the hour before goingto bed reported they were less likely to get a good night’s sleep, “every/almostevery weeknight.”11 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c11-nts11] In asimilar fashion, up to 77 percent use their computers or laptops in the hourbefore bed. Of those, 50 percent reported they were less likely to get a goodnight’s sleep, “every/almost every weeknight.”12[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c11-nts12]According to more than thirty years of studies conducted at the Division ofSleep Medicine at Boston’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard MedicalSchool, the light from electronics has a significant effect on circadian (i.e.,daily) rhythms of waking and sleeping. Throwing off your circadian rhythmaffects how quickly you fall asleep as well as the quality of sleep you get.13[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c11-nts13] According to Dr. Charles A.Czeisler of Harvard Medical School, “Artificial light exposure between dusk andthe time we go to bed at night suppresses release of the sleep-promoting hormonemelatonin, enhances alertness and shifts circadian rhythms to a laterhour—making it more difficult to fall asleep.”14[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c11-nts14]Answering work e-mails late at night, whether from your boss or regardingpending stressful deadlines, might also stir up anxiety that is not so conduciveto sleep. You may be wondering, what about e-readers? These are one of thenewest electronic phenomena to have an effect on our brains and biorhythms. Areport from the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that usingsuch devices near bedtime caused users to take longer to fall asleep and led todisturbances in their circadian rhythm, suppression of the sleep-inducinghormone melatonin, delays in the timing of REM sleep, and decreased alertnessthe next morning.15 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c11-nts15]In short, the bright light from these devices stimulates your brain and,unfortunately, makes it think it’s daytime. This keeps your brain alert insteadof allowing it to wind down when it senses that it is night. While there aresome apps you can download onto devices to help reduce the emission of bluelight, there is still some remaining stimulation from your electronic devices.You’d be better served turning them off earlier every evening.ACTION STEPS TO ALIGN YOURSELF TO NATURE’S RHYTHMSHere are some of the most important steps you can take to cut down on sleepdisturbances from artificial lights—especially electronic devices—to promotePeak Beauty Sleep.FOLLOW THE ONE-HOUR RULEIt’s critical to put down your devices, including tablets, cell phones, ande-readers, at least an hour before bed if you want to get that profound beautysleep that is critical to how you feel and look.USE AIRPLANE MODEWhile you’re at it, be sure to fully turn off your cell phone when you go tobed—or at least put it in airplane mode. That way you won’t be disturbed by thesounds or lights from nighttime calls, texts, and e-mails. Plus, by cutting offthe signal, you’ll have fewer electromagnetic frequencies, or invisible electricand magnetic fields radiating away from appliances that may have potentiallyharmful health effects, targeted at you during the night. You certainly don’tneed that signal beaming at you all night long.FLASHLIGHT IT TO THE BATHROOMWe all have to get up in the middle of the night for a bathroom break sometimes.If you turn on the bathroom light, however, the brightness can interrupt yourcircadian rhythms, making it difficult for you to go back to sleep. Instead, tryusing a night-light in the bathroom that isn’t visible from your bedroom, orkeep a dim flashlight next to the bed. Avoid drinking large quantities of fluidsbefore bedtime as well, in order to avoid this problem altogether.CHANGE YOUR ALARMUnfortunately, LED alarm clocks pose the same problems as other electronicdevices: they introduce a source of light into your room that disrupts yourcircadian rhythm. Your alarm clock also gives off an electromagnetic frequency(EMF). Some studies link EMF exposure to melatonin interruption and depletion inrodents and humans,16 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c11-nts16] which isnot good since melatonin is a hormone necessary for sound sleep. Switch to abattery-operated alarm clock or use your phone’s alarm, which should be inairplane mode at bedtime and throughout the night. Avoid placing otherelectronic devices such as radios or MP3 players on your bedside table as well.CAN’T SLEEP? CHILL OUTIf you simply can’t fall asleep for more than half an hour or so and are findingyourself getting increasingly agitated, get up and go into the other room andread a book or magazine, listen to some relaxing music, or meditate. Whateveryou do, don’t do anything stimulating, such as go on your computer or watchtelevision. The other thing to avoid is staring at the clock or constantlychecking the time on your phone. (There goes that blue light again!) Focusing onthe time can stress you out and make it even harder to fall asleep. So just tryto let it go, and keep your phone (in airplane mode of course!) far enough awaythat it takes some real effort to reach over and pick it up.PICK PRINTWhile e-readers may be convenient for your commute or when traveling, opt forprinted books at night. Reading from a printed book at night is actuallyrelaxing and can help promote Peak Beauty Sleep.BALANCE LIGHT DAYS AND DARK NIGHTSTo sleep better at night, get more natural light into your days. Wake up to thelight by opening your curtains and letting it shine in. If you have to beindoors for much of your day because of your job, make an effort to go for awalk during the day, even if it’s just briefly to run errands or walk aroundyour local park. Try to eat lunch outside when the weather permits. Even in thewinter, get outside and into the light as much as possible. Bundle up when it’scold. The more natural light exposure your eyes receive, the more in balance youwill be, in rhythm between the alternating beauty sleeping and waking hours."},{"pageContent":"SHIFT 12:ESTABLISH HEALTHY SLEEP ROUTINESTHE IMPORTANCE OF A REGULAR SCHEDULEWe humans are natural creatures of habit, and our daily routines establish ourbodily rhythms. One of the best ways to regulate and normalize your sleepingschedule is to regulate and normalize all the other rhythms in your life,including when you eat and exercise. Your body will better be able to feelsettled and ready for bed if everything else in your life is on a regularschedule, too. The more you can stick to as regular a schedule as possible (evenwhen traveling), the better your body will “know” its expected routines. Youwill naturally settle into sleep at the same time night after night, and thusenhance your beauty.Here are some general guidelines:• Exercise at the same time every day, ideally in the morning or at lunchtime,and avoid heavy physical stimulation later in the day. Late workouts can beoverly stimulating and keep your mind and body alert. Try to end workouts atleast 3 to 4 hours before bed. But do make regular workouts a part of yourroutine. A study from Northwestern Medicine found that exercise in general washelpful in relieving insomnia.1 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c12-nts1]In the study, adults who were previously sedentary and then started doingaerobic exercise four times a week reported an increase in sleep quality andvitality, along with less sleepiness during the day and fewer depressivesymptoms.2 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c12-nts2]• Keep regular mealtimes for breakfast, lunch, and dinner (though the particularfoods that make up those meals may vary with the seasons).• Always strive to eat dinner at least a few hours before bed. Digestion slowsat night because your body is meant to be rejuvenating, not digesting! Plus,feeling heaviness in your stomach as you are drifting off is not a recipe fordeep or peaceful sleep. Ideally, try to eat dinner 3 to 4 hours before bed.(It’s really not that crazy; if you go to bed at 11 p.m., aim to finish dinnerat least by 8 p.m., for instance).• Complete your abhyanga (see this page[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_c07_r1.xhtml#h4]) and other skin-care routines at thesame time every day.• Establish a regular morning routine that includes drinking hot water withlemon and allowing enough time for elimination.• Establish a regular evening routine (see below) and stick to it to signal toyour body that it’s time to wind down and prepare for sleep.• Keep your sleeping hours consistent. This is perhaps most important of all! Itwill set your internal clock so your body is better able to get drowsy naturallyand sleep more deeply once you climb into bed. Even on the weekends, try not toget too thrown off your regular weekday schedule. This will make it easier foryou to maintain optimal sleep patterns overall.• Avoiding napping. Ayurvedic teachings frown on daytime sleeping for adults,believing that it can contribute to illness. Napping may be tempting or even ahabit that you love, but if you find yourself engaged in irregular sleeppatterns, it’s better to avoid napping in general, especially after 4 or 5 p.m.ESTABLISH AN EVENING ROUTINEWhile your overall daily routine is important to promote Peak Beauty Sleep, themost important piece of this routine takes place in the evening before bed. Thiswas discussed in The Beauty Detox Power, but because it is so important to helpyou achieve Radical Beauty, we are going to discuss it here again.Followed daily, a regular evening routine will help you prepare mentally andphysically for sleep by giving cues to your internal clock. This will help youget the best possible beauty sleep every day and in the long-term, which iswhere the real benefits are to be had. What you choose to do for your eveningroutine is completely up to you. Every person will respond differently to eachactivity. You can choose one of these suggestions, a combination of them, orcome up with your own ideas for how to wind down in the evening before bed. Themost important thing is that you pick something that makes you feel relaxed andthat you do it at the same time every day as often as you can. Here are somesuggestions for your evening routine.SIP SOMETHING SOOTHINGAfter dinner, sip some herbal tea or hot almond or hemp milk while relaxing orgetting ready for bed. (See the Evening Replenishing Elixir on this page[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_c12_r1.xhtml#page180].)GET DIMAfter 6 p.m. in the winter or 7 p.m. in the summer, start dimming the lights inyour home. Try using candles at dinner and in whatever room of the house you arein to start reducing your exposure to artificial lights. You don’t have to gofull precolonial style, but any time you can reduce artificial lighting, thebetter.PRACTICE ABHYANGAIf you are too rushed in the mornings, you can perform your abhyanga routine(see this page [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_c07_r1.xhtml#h4]) in the evening. Orpractice a shorter variation of abhyanga followed by a relaxing hot bath orshower. If you completed your abhyanga in the morning, a nice warm bath orshower might be relaxing by itself.RELAX TO MUSICTry a routine of listening to some music you find truly relaxing. Music can helpto powerfully relax your mind. Find some music you connect to with a slowervibration that leaves you feeling soothed and chilled out. No stimulatinghip-hop or hard rock at this time!HONOR THE SACRED HOURTreat the last hour before bed as sacred time for you. Try reading somethingrelaxing or spiritually uplifting, or meditating. There are excellent ways toset the energetic tone as you drift into sleep. (See Pillar 6[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_p06_r1.xhtml] for more specifics about meditation.)Your nighttime reading should be done with real books instead of an electronicreader that can disrupt your internal cues and sleep patterns.During the sacred hour, what you avoid is just as crucial as what you engage in.Avoid stressful or stimulating activities. Late at night is not the ideal timeto complete last-minute work on a presentation, hit the gym, or engage in adynamic Vinyasa yoga flow. It’s also not the best time to get into a bigemotional discussion with your partner or a friend. You’ll be better off savingthat for morning tea or a Saturday hike, if you can put it off until then.Stressful activities just have no place before bedtime. They can induce yourbody to secrete the stress hormone cortisol, which can make you feel more alert.Chill out and steer clear of anything non–chilled out.SECURE THE BEST BEAUTY SLEEP POSEResearch has shown that exactly how you sleep on your pillow can influencewrinkle formation. One study from the journal of Clinical and ExperimentalDermatology studied mechanical forces on the face and how they influencedwrinkles and superficial facial changes, including the formation of crow’s-feetand lines around the mouth. They found that redistributing pressure could helpreduce wrinkles.3 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c12-nts3]So what can you do? First, ensure that you have the right kind of pillow (seethis page [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_c12_r1.xhtml#page178]) and avoid sleeping onyour stomach, which may create pressure and enhance wrinkles to an even greaterdegree. Also avoid crossing your legs when you sleep. It’s not only bad forcirculation, but can also twist your spine, leaving you feeling unbalanced inthe morning. Try sleeping with a pillow between your legs, which will keep yourlegs and hips more balanced.CREATE A PERSONAL BEDROOM CAVEOne of the most important routines you can create is the habit of sleeping in anideal environment. If you look at the sleeping habits of other animals,regardless of whether they sleep during the day or the night, you will findbears and bats burrowed deep in cool, dark, quiet caves. Let’s take this cuefrom nature as a guide to create an ideal sleep environment. There are threefactors that are essential for creating your own personal beauty sleep “cave”right in your own home.COOLWarm temperatures might feel great during the day when you’re outside,especially if you like to hike, bike, or go to the beach. But high temperaturesare not great for sleep. In fact, some research has shown a connection betweeninsomnia and elevated body temperatures.4[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c12-nts4] You’ve perhaps alreadyexperienced how much easier it is to sleep soundly when you can snuggle underthe covers. When you sleep, your body’s temperature drops mildly, which actuallyhelps prepare you to sleep through the night.While the National Sleep Foundation recommends a cool 65 degrees Fahrenheit (18degrees Celsius)5 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c12-nts5] for sleep,somewhere between 65 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit (18 to 24 degrees Celsius),depending on your particular body constitution, is a good range to help you dropoff to sleep faster and more deeply. Some researchers believe that keepingtemperatures steady throughout the night is important, and that if there is arise or fall in temperature you might experience less quality REM sleep. Ifpossible, set your home thermometer to hold steady at a certain temperature.From a beauty perspective, excessive heat can cause you to lose even more fluidsthroughout the night, and sleep is already dehydrating. Chronic, excessivenighttime dehydration over time can contribute to drying out and taxing yourskin.DARKYour whole bedroom needs to be as dark as possible. Move as much electronicequipment out of your bedroom as possible (surely the printer can fit somewherein the living room) and get rid of digital alarm clocks that are plugged in andintroduce their own lights and electromagnetic frequencies. Then go through anduse black tape to cover any little blinking lights that can’t be avoided. Lighttells your brain that it’s time to wake up, and even a small amount of ambientlight from your cell phone or computer can disrupt the production of melatonin,6[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c12-nts6] which regulates sleep cycles.It’s also very helpful to equip your room with heavy blackout shades thatcompletely block out the sunlight along with outside streetlights or car lights.This is especially important if you live on a busy road or in a city. An eyemask is also a great tool to help block out light. If you don’t like the feel ofa mask, which can feel constricting to some, simply drape a dark T-shirt overyour eyes. Strive for the complete darkness of a deeply burrowed cave, trying tore-create that natural environment of peace and relaxation.SACRED BEDROOM ACTIVITIESThere are (probably) multiple rooms in your house or apartment for all thefunctions you perform daily as a human being. While it’s not a bad idea to workon your computer at the kitchen table or sometimes eat dinner on your couch inthe living room if you feel like it, it’s important to keep your bedroomactivities to the bare minimum: sleep, relaxation, and sex. That’s it. Banlaptops, TVs, and work materials from your bedroom. Keeping your bed only forrelaxing or lovemaking will help strengthen your mental association between yourbedroom and sleep—or lovemaking and then sleep, on those occasions!Some light reading in bed, especially of inspiring or spiritual material, ishighly recommended. This content can seep into and positively influence yourmind as you are drifting off to sleep. But TV, with its stimulating lights andimages, should be avoided. Keep your TV in your living room, not your bedroom.QUIETDepending on where you live, you may not be able to control the noise in yourexternal environment, which may include barking dogs, chattering teenagers,noisy car engines, and the like. As much as we would like to, we can’t make allthe outside signs of life go away when it’s time for bed. But you can controlthe noise inside your cave. Creating white noise by using a fan, an excellentair filter, or even a specific white-noise maker can help you sleep moresoundly. Another option is to block out the noise as much as possible withearplugs. The more disruptive outer noises you can avoid, the more peaceful yourinner sleeping cave will be.BONUS CAVE FACTOR: COMFORTCaves in nature are not necessarily “comfortable” per se, as they are mademostly of rocks; slippery, damp surfaces; and even pools of water. But your homecave can deviate from the strict natural variety to include all the tools tohelp you get comfortable for sleep. These include soft sheets that don’tirritate your skin, calming scents, an excellent mattress, and the rightpillows.What’s the best kind of mattress? There isn’t a lot of scientific evidence toconclusively show that one type of mattress is better than another kind.7[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c12-nts7] Plus the right mattress foryour neighbor or brother may not necessarily be the best one for you. It’s bestto lie down on different mattresses and see which one feels best for you,especially if you have neck or back pain. Howard Levy, MD, an Emory Universityassistant professor of orthopedics, physical medicine, and rehabilitation,comments, “If you’re on too soft [of] a mattress, you’ll start to sink down tothe bottom. But on too hard of a mattress you have too much pressure on thesacrum, and on the shoulders, and on the back of the head.”8[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c12-nts8] In other words, a mattress ofmedium firmness might work the best for your spine and give you enough balanceand support.If you have medical conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder(COPD) or frequent heartburn from gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), youmay want to utilize an adjustable bed that can help you elevate your head atnight when you sleep to help you breathe easier and experience fewer symptoms.If you have allergies to dust mites, try getting a washable mattress cover thatyou can slip on and off and wash easily.The Better Sleep Council recommends spending at least 15 minutes on the bed inthe store before buying it, as it may take that much time to relax and reallyfeel out your new mattress.9 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c12-nts9] Sodon’t be embarrassed to march right into the store and plop down on themattresses for a little while on each one. It’s your beauty sleep. Set aside afew hours on a Sunday afternoon, roll into the local mattress stores, andprepare to spend some time curled up on the various beds you find. Toting a goodread along is totally optional (but recommended!).Pillows are also pretty important when it comes to sleep comfort. They cangreatly contribute to your beauty sleep or diminish it. If you have headaches oraches and pains through your neck, shoulder, or upper back, your pillow caneither help provide relief or exacerbate these pesky issues.The position you sleep in also has some influence over the type of pillow youshould choose. If you sleep on your back, look for a thinner pillow so your headand neck are not positioned too far forward, which can consistently throw youout of alignment. You can also seek out a pillow that has a more structuredshape in the lower part to help cradle your neck and provide more support. Ifyou sleep on your side, look for a firmer pillow that can stabilize your neckand head and keep them from dropping down too far. This will help fill in thespace between your ear and shoulder and give you enough support to avoid tensionor cramps that keep you from falling asleep or wake you up with an aching neck.Stomach sleeping is not recommended for skin beauty reasons (see this page[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_c12_r1.xhtml#p19]), but if you do choose to sleep onyour stomach, try looking for a flat pillow or using one underneath your stomachto help support your lower back and spine.The right scents can also bolster your sleep on a nightly basis. The keys toenhance all the moods in the universe, including drowsiness and relaxation, arefound in nature. Certain essential oils distilled from nature’s bounty,especially lavender, neroli, vetiver, valerian, chamomile, and clary sage,activate alpha wave activity in the back of your brain, which leads torelaxation and helps you sleep more soundly.

Another option is to buy an essential oil ring for the lightbulbin the lamp at your bedside table.PET LOVEDo your furry friends belong in your cave? Dogs and cats may be unconditionalsources of love and comfort, but some research has found that having your catsand dogs sleep in the bed with you can wake you up during the night andinterfere with your best sleep.10[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c12-nts10] While you love yourfour-legged friends, it might be best to have them sleep in their own space awayfrom yours.THE BEST FOODS FOR SLEEPMany people don’t realize that what they do (and don’t) eat can have a dramaticimpact on the quality of their sleep. Certain foods have different propertiesand qualities that can help promote Peak Beauty Sleep. Try incorporating thesefoods into your dietary routine in the afternoons and evenings to enhance yoursleep at night.HEMP MILKHemp milk is high in the amino acid tryptophan, which is a precursor toserotonin and helps to promote sleep. It also contains all the essential aminoacids and lots of minerals. Try the Evening Replenishing Elixir on this page[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_c12_r1.xhtml#page180], which is made from a hemp milkbase.WHOLE, UNREFINED CARBOHYDRATESTry some quinoa, brown rice, amaranth, gluten-free teff- or brown rice–basedwraps, or buckwheat (soba) noodles. Carbohydrates increase the level oftryptophan in your blood, helping to promote sleep.BANANASBananas help promote sleep because they contain the natural muscle relaxantsmagnesium and potassium. They also have carbohydrates that will make you sleepy.They are a low-water, starchy fruit that digests slowly, so you can have oneideally a few hours before bed if you find yourself getting hungry but want toeat something that is sleep inducing rather than stimulating.SWEET POTATOESThese hearty root vegetables contain muscle-relaxing potassium and are a whole,complex carbohydrate. Try baking some sweet potatoes and eating them at dinnerwith a big salad.EVENING REPLENISHING ELIXIRThis elixir contains nourishing essential beauty fats and spices known to helpsoothe inflammation and your nervous system.Mugful of hemp milk½ teaspoon powdered turmeric½ teaspoon powdered cardamom¼ teaspoon powdered clovesRaw, organic honey or raw coconut nectar, to tasteHeat the hemp milk to just under a boil, and stir in the turmeric, cardamom, andcloves. Remove from the heat, add the raw honey, and enjoy hot.CHERRIESThis bright, beautiful summer fruit is one of the few foods that naturallycontain melatonin. A study found that drinking tart cherry juice offers someslight improvements to the duration and quality of sleep in those with chronicinsomnia.11 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c12-nts11]CHIA PUDDINGThis snack, made by soaking chia seeds in a liquid base, has a great mix ofcomplex carbs, omega-3 fatty acids, and amino acids to help you feel satiatedbut not overly stuffed and enjoy a great night’s sleep.THE WORST FOODS FOR SLEEPJust as there are excellent foods for sleep, there are foods that are not sogreat for promoting sleep. Review this list and avoid these foods in the eveningto best support your Peak Beauty Sleep.HEAVY PROTEIN MEALSMeals that are high in concentrated proteins should be avoided late at night.They take a great deal of digestive energy to break down and can keep you up byoveractivating digestion. If you are going to have a heavy dinner, try to eat itearly. If circumstances force a late dinner, choose a lighter, plant-based meal.HIGH FAT MEALSFat stimulates the production of acid in the stomach while encouraging theloosening of the esophageal sphincter. This can cause food to spill up into youresophagus, creating heartburn. Lying down to go to sleep after eating heavy,fatty foods makes it even easier for acid to get in all the wrong places. Thisis a super uncomfortable beauty sleep no-no.CHOCOLATEWhile a little piece of dark chocolate might quell your sweet craving, do notoverindulge in chocolate late in night. Remember that it does contain caffeineas well as theobromine, another stimulating compound that can adversely affectyour beauty sleep.SPICY FOODSThese can be overstimulating and actually keep you up at night. A study out ofAustralia found that on nights the subjects ate spicy meals, there were adversechanges in their sleep patterns.12[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c12-nts12] The researchers also foundthat subjects had elevated body temperatures during their first sleep cycles,which has been shown in other studies to be linked to poor sleep quality.13[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c12-nts13]CAFFEINEEven if you feel you are used to caffeine, it still keeps your body working.Research published in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine found that caffeineingested as early as 6 hours before bedtime could negatively affect sleeppatterns.14 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c12-nts14] In a practicalsense, this means you should stop drinking coffee (if you drink it at all),green tea, or yerba maté by the afternoon. By the way, the tradition of drinkingcoffee after dinner is one you should abandon. Make your own tradition withherbal tea if you’d like to sip on something hot, and your beauty will surelybenefit.NICOTINEIf you smoke, you should stop for many health and beauty reasons! We are sureyou know this, and hopefully you are working on eliminating that habitlong-term. But in the very short-term while transitioning completely, be sure torefrain from indulging in any nicotine products too close to bedtime. Nicotinecan be stimulating, which is not conducive to your beauty sleep.ALCOHOLThis is a tough one, because if you do want to have some drinks, you likelywon’t have them in the middle of the day or in the morning unless it’s a veryrare special occasion, such as a tailgate or a celebratory brunch. The problemis that even though the alcohol (especially wine) may feel as if it’s inducingsleep, alcohol actually interferes with the restorative functions of sleep.15[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c12-nts15] This means that although itmay feel relaxing, after a few hours it may encourage you to wake up during thenight, decreasing the quality of your overall sleep.SUPPLEMENT YOUR SLEEP WITH VITAMIN B12This important water-soluble vitamin is used for many functions of the body,including maintaining energy and preventing fatigue. Vitamin B12 promoteshealthy brain and cardiac function and helps us sleep better, as it has acritical role in the formation of melatonin. It also supports the optimalmetabolism of fats and carbohydrates, promotes healthy cell growth and repair,and activates the vitamin folate in the body. While it can be stored in yourliver for some time, you can get a blood test to see if your body currently hasthe proper amount.Vegans and vegetarians are definitely encouraged to supplement with B12 becauseit is found mostly in animal products, but if you do eat meat, that does notnecessarily mean that you have optimal levels of Vitamin B12. Absorption andutilization of B12 might still be compromised even if you consume foods thatcontain it (such as animal protein, fortified cereals, and nutritional yeast).For instance, if you are low in hydrochloric acid, which releases B12 from food,your body may have issues absorbing B12. Your stomach lining could also belacking in its ability to produce intrinsic factor, a protein that must bind toB12 in the small intestine so the body can absorb it.Check with your doctor if you are unsure of how much Vitamin B12 your bodyneeds, but 500 to 1,000 micrograms (mcg) is generally considered a good dailyamount. You can take a B-complex supplement to get a balance of all the Bvitamins.If you really value your sleep, you may have to make some serious lifestylechanges around your alcohol habits. This may seem difficult at first, but onceyou experience more daytime bliss and start feeling great in so many other areasof your life (including having increasingly beautiful skin), you may naturallytaper off your imbibing. When you do, you may find that your “cleaner” systemneeds far less alcohol in general to feel relaxed or to enjoy the taste of yourfavorite Cabernet or Pinot. In an ideal world, you should avoid drinking within3 hours of bedtime. But if you are going out for a night with friends, thisobviously won’t be realistic. Just be aware, drink responsibly and moderately(ideally keeping it to one or two drinks maximum), and perhaps find other waysto spend time with friends and relaxing that don’t involve alcohol.Hopefully by now it is clear to you just how important Peak Beauty Sleep is foryour overall health, vitality, and beauty. It’s so important, in fact, thatachieving your full potential of Radical Beauty would be hard to realize withoutworking to optimize your sleep. Be sure to make the necessary shifts toprioritize your sleep so you can enjoy your best beauty for the long-term."},{"pageContent":"PILLAR 4:PRIMAL BEAUTYIf you want to see true beauty personified, all you need do is gaze at a sunriseor sunset, the mighty rivers or wide oceans, or the harmonious synergy in anyforest. We can stand in awe of nature’s perfect beauty while recognizing that weare a part of it. Each of us is a part of the natural world, and living inaccordance with natural principles and rhythms aligns us with Mother Nature.This powerfully supports our natural beauty to flow through.Shakti is the Sanskrit word for the creative power of nature that we are all apart of. Living in accordance with nature is as essential to our being asbreathing or sleeping, but it’s easy with a modern lifestyle to stray furtherand further away from our attunement with nature. When we superimpose syntheticor unnatural rhythms over the fabric of our lives, our natural beauty suffers.Nature is our teacher. We can learn a lot from watching the cycles of the sunand moon, listening to the sounds of nature, and tuning in to the effects theyhave on our energy. The more you are in harmony with nature and her rhythms andenergies, the more positive effect you’ll see on your well-being and beauty."},{"pageContent":"SHIFT 13:HARNESS THE BEAUTY OF THE SEASONSOne of the most important ways to allow the power of nature to support yourhealth and beauty is to tune in to the changing seasons of the year. Every partof the year has a different collective energy, which in turn affects yourpersonal energy. Riding this wave and adjusting your dietary and lifestylepatterns to be in sync with the flow of the seasons will help you achieveRadical Beauty. The more in sync you are with the universal energies takingplace on a larger scale beyond you, the better your skin, hair, and nails willlook, and the more power you’ll feel supporting you in everything you do.For instance, by eating according to the seasons and largely focusing your dieton the produce that is being grown locally during the current season, you willbe eating food that is at its peak of freshness. Not only will it taste itsbest, but it will also have the most beauty nutrition because it was pickedclose to when and where you consume it. Seasonal foods also tend to be moreaffordable since crops for each season are naturally in abundance and sellersdon’t have to account for shipping costs.If you focus on eating seasonally and shopping often at the local farmer’smarkets, you may find that you end up eating a far wider variety of what happensto be growing around you at the moment instead of reaching for your favoritestaple veggies. This will help you naturally get a greater variety of beautynutrients into your diet, as different foods contain different compositions ofminerals and phytonutrients to help support your Radical Beauty. You will alsofeel more integrated into your surrounding environment if you can eat what isgrown there. Besides your personal benefits, eating this way reduces your carbonfootprint and allows you to support Mother Nature. It requires less fuel (fromtrucks, trains, planes, and so on) to transport food from local farms to yourtable than from overseas growers.From a beauty standpoint, you may notice that each season has a different effecton your skin, and it is important to adjust accordingly. The seasons willinfluence your exercise and activity levels, as well, and you must honor thatflow. In a larger sense, as the overall environment is shifting, you can tune into that collective energy and work with it in each season, not against it. Forexample, during the peak light of the summer you may feel a tremendous drive towork on creative projects that you previously decided to “plant” in the spring.Being authentic to those natural urges will make you more beautifully powerful.Let’s explore all the seasons and how to best shift your dietary and skin-careroutines as well as your energy goals to maintain your natural beauty inalignment with the larger picture of nature all around you.WINTER LIFESTYLE BEAUTY PRACTICESWinter is the season with the least amount of light. Your skin might need moremoisture at this time, and you might naturally want to eat meals that are morehearty and hot, temperature-wise. With the deepening darkness, you may sense anatural tendency to go inward and take stock of your goals and what you arecreating in your life. Here are the best practices to attain Radical Beauty inthe winter:• Eat more freshly made hot meals. Your body will naturally crave hot soups andstews, baked vegetable dishes, and the like, so be in tune with those needs andsupply yourself with hot, comforting foods. Though you may, of course, keep someraw foods in your diet, be sure to balance them with warming foods.• Incorporate a lot of root vegetables such as winter squash, yams, sweetpotatoes, and pumpkins, which you will find in the local farmer’s markets atthis time of year. These vegetables are particularly high in beta-carotene,which converts into vitamin A in the body and is an excellent nutrient to keepyour skin healthy and bright in these dimmer months.• Add warming spices such as ginger, cloves, and cinnamon to your teas andrecipes.• Switch to organic, cold-pressed sesame oil to moisturize your skin for yourabhyanga practice. Sesame oil is said to have warming properties.• Due to the dryness of winter, you might need a heavier facial moisturizer.Switch accordingly and look for one that is oil based rather than water based,as the oil will provide a protective layer on your skin and hold in moisturelonger. Products containing pure plant oils like coconut, almond, avocado, andprimrose oil should not make your skin break out. On the other hand, shea buttermay clog your pores; especially if you are acne-prone, avoid products on theface that contain shea butter (though it’s great to use on your body). Avoidproducts that contain synthetic, petroleum-based oils, such as mineral oil.• Your skin will likely be dry and dehydrated not only from the wind and coldelements, but also from indoor heat, so make sure your moisturizer containshyaluronic acid and other humectants to attract more moisture to your face andkeep it supple.• Increase your fat intake slightly—but not dramatically—with whole plant foodssuch as chia seeds, walnuts, and avocados. These essential fats will nourishsupple skin. Just an extra few tablespoons of chia seed pudding (seekimberlysnyder. com [http://kimberlysnyder.com] for the easy recipe) or anotherhalf of an avocado will keep your skin moisturized from the inside out. Extrafat in the winter may also feel grounding during this dark period.• Use a creamy cleanser rather than a gel one. The cream will have fewerstripping surfactants and help keep the natural oils on your skin intact duringthese times when you want to hold on to all of the moisture you can.• Do a weekly at-home oil treatment to keep your hair protected from the dryingweather. At least once a week, massage coconut oil into the tips of your hairand throughout the strands, pile it into a bun or tuck it into a shower cap,leave it in for at least 30 minutes to 1 hour, and then rinse out and shampoo asusual.• Slough off dry skin cells with an at-home sugar scrub. Combine equal partscoconut oil and organic sugar and then add 15 to 20 drops or so of your favoriteessential oil. Keep the mixture in a glass or BPA-free container. In the shower,gently rub off dead skin cells from your entire body, including your elbows andheels. Shaving is also a great exfoliator for the large surface area of yourlegs.• Stay active. It’s tempting to just curl up during winter, but the diminishedlight and the cold weather can contribute to depression, stagnation, a weakenedimmune system, and sluggish feelings. It’s a great time of year to begin ordeepen a home yoga practice, whether on your own or with a yoga DVD. You don’thave to expose yourself to the elements to stay active and move every part ofyour body.• Honor the natural tendency for more “darkness” and allow yourself torejuvenate and rest by staying at home more. Don’t push yourself to go out morethan you naturally like out of obligation. You might feel that evenings at homewith herbal tea, a warm bath, and a good book simply serve you more.• If you live in a place that has limited sunlight for extended periods of timethroughout the winter months, you might want to consider supplementing withvitamin D3, or getting a special light designed to help stimulate vitamin D inyour body. Vitamin D plays a vital role in maintaining healthy, beautiful bones,strong immunity, balanced moods, and all-around health and wellness.• With the very slowly burgeoning light of the winter solstice near the end ofthe year, complete an honest and deep assessment of where you would like to putyour energy in the upcoming year and what is nurturing and authentic for yourbeautiful spirit at this time. In nature, new seeds are growing at the rootlevel now, and a lot is taking place beneath the surface. This is a great timefor you, too, to evaluate where you want to plant your “seeds,” which projectsyou want to pursue, and where you want to put your energy, which will bloomlater in the year. You can determine this only by being honest and listening toyour heart.SPRING LIFESTYLE BEAUTY PRACTICESIn spring, life emerges again. No matter how long the cold winter months mayseem some years, spring always follows. You can see the burgeoning beauty offresh flower buds, leaves, and shoots and feel the urge to express your naturalbeauty outwardly with sundresses, skirts, and perhaps brighter makeup colors. Asthe light increases, you naturally feel like shedding the stagnation andheaviness of winter. This includes a tendency to start eating lighter andperhaps lightening up on your skin-care products, too. You may also feel anatural rise in energy, a newfound spark of powerful inspiration that can now bedirected toward whatever goals you decided to pursue when taking stock in thedarkness of winter. Here are the best ways to harness the beauty of spring:• Spring is the very best time of the year to complete a cleanse or engage insome detoxing. If you’re interested in a liquid cleanse, check out the organic,strategically designed ones offered from Glow Bio (myglowbio. com[http://myglowbio.com]) or do your own version by making fresh green smoothiesor juices and abstaining from heavier foods for a few days.• Lighten up your diet. This is a great time of year to shift into eating moreraw foods (though you don’t have to eat 100 percent raw, by any means). Reduceyour ratio of fats so you feel less weighed down. You might want to eat lighter,broth-based soups and favor smaller amounts of avocado and nuts. Use all oilssparingly.• If you indulged over the winter, it’s a great time to reset bad habits andpatterns and renew your resolve to improve your eating habits. Feel in tune withthe bursting energy of spring by letting go of heavier, dense, or cloggingfoods. Ditch the dairy, refined sugars, gluten, and excess animal protein, andeat more light, plant-centric meals.• Increase your consumption of raw apple cider vinegar by adding it into saladdressings or hot water that you sip, as it has antiseptic qualities to help youcleanse for spring while building healthy bacteria in your gut. It also offersthe beauty-balancing electrolyte potassium.• Sprouts and microgreens very much capture the emerging energy of the springand are bursting with living enzymes, vitamins, minerals, and phytonutrients.Wash them well and sprinkle them liberally into salads, on top of soups, and onjust about any dish you eat. Even though they are so pretty to look at, you canalso throw a handful into a smoothie!• Add some natural diuretics to your smoothies and other dishes to help flushout some spring water weight. Some good options include coriander, parsley,asparagus, cranberry, and pineapple; as it gets closer to summer, try eggplantand watermelon.• Take full advantage of your farmer’s market, which will have a much widerarray of foods than it did during the winter. Lettuces, fennel, broccoli,asparagus, watercress, and collard greens are just a few of the farmer’s marketspring treasures you will discover.• Sweat any way you can! This is a great time of year to hit the infrared saunaor get out into the light of day for some vigorous hiking, walking, or jogging.Sweat is a great way to purge out toxicity and excess stagnation that built upduring the winter.• If you have a home yoga practice, this is a great time to increase the SuryaNamaskars, or sun salutations, and other standing flow sequences, as you’llnaturally feel like moving more vigorously this season.• Take advantage of the growing light. Get up earlier to enjoy the mornings, andperhaps take an afternoon or post-early-dinner stroll to enjoy the evening lightand watch the sunset. This is a beautiful way to sync with the changing rhythmof the environment.• Gently exfoliate dead skin cells that may have accumulated from winter with acleanser that contains alpha or beta hydroxy acids.• Try sloughing off excessive dead skin cells on your body with a salt scrubrather than the sugar scrub you might have used for winter. Salt scrubs areconsidered slightly more exfoliating, and salt is said to have a negative ioniccharge, helping purify negative energies and impurities that you may have pickedup from the environment.1 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c13-nts1] Thisis the theory behind the rock salt lamps sold at local health markets, which aresaid to help neutralize home environments from electronic devices that arebelieved to give off a positive ionic charge. Combine equal parts coconut oiland salt with 15 to 20 drops of your favorite essential oil (such as lavender orneroli). Keep the mixture in a glass or BPA-free container, and gently scrubyour entire body in the shower.• Pay extra attention to moving stagnation through your lymphatic system, asthis is the season to detox. Refer back to this page[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_c07_r1.xhtml#page120] for more tips on this.• Ayurveda encourages Panchakarma methods to help cleanse the body and renewdigestion. These are detoxification methods that include colon cleansing. Ifyou’re up for it, try getting an at-home enema kit or a gravity colonic from arecommended therapist.• Increase your water intake to flush out impurities. Also try incorporating hotwater with lemon in the afternoons and/or evenings. This is a fantasticcleansing, flushing drink.• With the growing light, be sure to properly protect yourself from the sun withwide-brimmed hats, large sunglasses, and nontoxic sunscreen (see this page[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_c06_r1.xhtml#ind1017a]).• Synchronize with the creative power flowing through nature and the universe.Take the time to put energy into your creative ventures and longings, andcultivate them. Be selective with your time, cutting out excessive televisionwatching and other more passive activities you might have engaged in over thecold winter. Spend more time going for what you want. You have all the power ofthe universe supporting you now to go for it!SUMMER LIFESTYLE BEAUTY PRACTICESSummer brings the most intense sunlight, which is activating and exciting.Depending on where you live, it might be extremely humid or extremely dry atthis time. You might also be contending with a vacillation between hot outdoorweather and freezing indoor air-conditioning. It’s important to protect andnourish your immunity and energy during these vital summer months. Here are someof the most effective Radical Beauty summer practices:• Eat lots of cooling, juicy in-season fruits, including apricots, grapes,blueberries, blackberries, cherries, plums, raspberries, strawberries, figs,nectarines, and melons.• Enjoy beets, cucumbers, bell peppers, radishes, summer squash varieties,endives, and beans. These are among the bounty of summer foods you’ll find freshand available at your local farmer’s market.• It’s easier to get more agitated, impatient, and annoyed during this “fiery”season of Pitta, which governs our internal fire. It’s a good idea to avoidoveractive foods that might enhance those qualities, including chilies, spicytomatillos, and excessive garlic and onion.• Drink cooling, herbal teas such as fresh mint tea or chamomile. It’s easy togrow a little mint plant at your kitchen windowsill and have fresh mint tea allsummer.• Honor your body’s natural inclination to eat lighter during the heat ofsummer. Listen to your body and never force it to eat. It’s important torecognize that you shouldn’t necessarily eat the same meals or foods duringevery month of the year. This is a great time to eat lots of raw foods such asfresh salads and fruit.• Drink coconut water, which is hydrating and helps to replenish electrolytesand minerals that you lose from sweating.• Enjoy lots of raw greens this season, which are by nature yin, or cooling. Becreative with the range of lettuces and greens you see at your farmer’s market,and rotate them to create some new, tasty salads.• Since you may already feel puffy or somewhat swollen from the heat, it’s agood idea to cut back on salty foods. Try using more fresh herbs for flavorrather than lots of salt. Your taste for salt will naturally reduce over time.• As your skin increases in oiliness, try the Radically Clear Skin Mask (thispage [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_c08_r1.xhtml#page129]) or other clay-based masksto help ward off breakouts and congestion in your complexion.• Unless you have very dry skin, try switching your cleanser from a creamy oneto a gel-based one, which is lighter and can help clear out excess sweat, dirt,and grime.• If oil-based creams are starting to feel too heavy, switch to a highlyabsorbable, lighter, water-based moisturizer for the summer.• Aloe is a fairly sturdy plant to try growing in a pot indoors or outdoors(depending on where you live). You’ll have a fresh source to use on any burnsfrom excessive sunlight. (Let’s really hope that doesn’t happen, but just incase, be prepared!)• Since coconut oil is said to have cooling properties, switch to coconut oilfor your abhyanga practice (see this page[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_c07_r1.xhtml#h4]).• Wear light-colored, natural fabrics such as linen and cotton, which allow yourskin to breathe.• Fill a spritzer bottle with rose water, and spray it across your face anddécolleté whenever you need a soothing refresher.• Honor changes in movement this time of year. You might be drawn to yoga(especially a self-practice) rather than super intense aerobic activities(unless they involve beach or water sports!), which might feel depleting. Thisis not necessarily the best time for hot yoga in an enclosed, artificiallyheated room.• You might feel activated and excited not only by your creative or professionalpursuits but also to explore and revel in being outside in nature’s rawelements. This might mean beach time or more time to lounge in a park. Allowyourself to have this outdoor time and to explore feeling stimulated from natureas well as your personal interests. Your energy will naturally be high, so getoutside and enjoy. At the very end of summer, however, depending on yourenvironment, you might feel overheated and the need to chill out more, and it’simportant to honor that as well.FALL LIFESTYLE BEAUTY PRACTICESThe beauty of fall is seen in the full range of colors among Mother Nature’schanging leaves. The air gets crisper, and the wind can pick up, making itimportant to protect your skin and body. You may find yourself craving lesscoconut water and more hot teas and elixirs to feel balanced, as well as hot,nourishing meals you may have largely avoided in the summer. From an energeticstandpoint, it’s important to take measures to feel grounded, as Vata, theair-based element, dominates the fall season. When imbalanced, this canexacerbate stress and anxiety, which is particularly true if activitiesdramatically increase after a leisurely summer. Here are the best fall beautypractices:• It’s the natural time of year to start eating more grounding, warm cookedmeals again, so be sure to adjust your dietary rotation accordingly.• Brussels sprouts, turnips, daikon radish, cauliflower, and mushrooms are someof the vegetables you’ll find in season in the fall, so be sure to takeadvantage and find creative and simple ways to cook and enjoy these fortifyingfoods.• Quinoa, brown rice, and amaranth are great gluten-free grains to incorporatethis time of year, especially if eaten with lots of vegetables.• Sip on lemon balm, chamomile, valerian root, ashwagandha or holy basil/tulsiteas, which are fantastic for helping you destress and unwind. You can sourcethese teas, which can often be found combined in “anti-anxiety” formulations, athealth stores.• The drying wind and drop in humidity may make your skin feel rougher. Be sureto spend a little more time with your abhyanga practice (see this page[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_c07_r1.xhtml#h4]), which is also good for pacifyingexcess Vata, which can lead to feeling overwhelmed and anxious when imbalanced.Abhyanga is a great practice to help alleviate stress.• Since Vata, or the air element, is so prevalent in the fall, you mayexperience some constipation. This is a symptom of Vata being out of balance. Besure to eat lots of fibrous foods, take some magnesium-oxygen supplements (suchas Detoxy +) as needed to help keep things moving, and eat mindfully and slowly,always chewing well.• Be sure to protect your skin from the quickening changes of the weather,including dry wind. Use scarves and gloves to protect your hands, neck, and faceduring walks or periods outside, keeping out drafts that can lead to chappingand excessive dryness.• Your skin may need extra nourishment with the change of seasons, and it mightstart to feel drier. The Radically Timeless Beauty Mask (this page[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_c06_r1.xhtml#page115]) is particularly excellent atthis time of year.• Be sure to protect your delicate lips, which may become increasingly chapped.Apply lip balms regularly that contain natural ingredients such as shea butter,olive oil, and vitamin E. Avoid lip balms that contain petroleum-based,synthetic ingredients (which you don’t want to continually ingest, an inevitableoccurrence with anything you put on your lips).• Since you might have gotten your fair share (or more!) of sun, salt water, andchlorine over the summer, your skin might feel a bit taxed. Try going back to agentle sugar scrub (see Winter tips on this page[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_c13_r1.xhtml#page189]) and adding more coconut oil ifyou feel that your skin needs extra lubrication.• Avoid using stripping soaps on your skin in the shower. Choose all-natural,mild, and simple cleansers with essential oils instead of potentially irritatingartificial fragrances.• With the cooler temperatures and chilly wind, it’s time to switch back tothicker moisturizers with an oil base, which can feel more hydrating andprotective.• Pay extra attention to your hands. They have the long winter ahead of themwith lots of potential cold and wind exposure. Be sure to keep your handsmoisturized with a good hand cream (shea butter or other natural ingredientbased), and reapply often, especially after washing your hands.• After the leisure of summer, you may feel an increased swirl of activities inthe fall: kids going back to school, increased work projects, or new-foundintensity in hitting goals by the end of the year. Be sure to balance thestress. Make it a priority to create downtime for yourself as the holidays gearup so you don’t feel overwhelmed and resort to stress eating or other unhealthyoutlets. Take time to cultivate nurturing, grounding activities such asmeditation, massages, spending time at home reading, or whatever makes you feelsoothed.Making an effort to gracefully acknowledge the energy shifts as the earth makesher yearly progression around the sun and to shift your daily lifestyle routinesin accordance with the different seasons is an important way to maximize yourhealth, energy, and expression of beauty. Whether we are aware of it or not, weare impacted by the larger energy influences of our environment. Why notrecognize, embrace, and align with them to your advantage?

By now, it’s well established that overexposure to the sun can leadto skin cancer and seriously accelerated skin aging. But that’s not to say thatwe should shun the sun completely. The sun is a vital component of nature thatprovides life and vitality to the entire planet, including us. Even in the dawnof increased modernism, we cannot divorce ourselves from Mother Nature; ourconnection to her is indivisible.While you have to be very careful about how and where you engage in sun exposure(which we will discuss further below), we don’t want to completely eschew thesun. Robyn Lucas, an epidemiologist at Australian National University who led astudy published in the International Journal of Epidemiology, concluded that farmore lives are lost to diseases caused by a lack of sunlight than to thosecaused by too much.1 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c14-nts1] There aremany health and beauty benefits to limited sun exposure, including thefollowing.ENDORPHIN AND HORMONE PRODUCTIONJust being around sunlight—even if you’re not directly exposed to it—can helpimprove your mood by causing your body to synthesize “feel good” endorphins andhormones such as serotonin. This can be as simple as gazing out of a window intothe natural light while eating lunch or working on a laptop (though you won’tabsorb vitamin D through glass). A lack of sun exposure can cause a melatoninimbalance and lead to seasonal affective disorder (SAD), a form of depressioncaused by a deficiency of natural sunlight during the winter months. This is avery real issue for those in certain environments that don’t have enoughsunlight, and it demonstrates how important natural elements such as the sun areto our beauty and well-being. As we mentioned in Pillar 3[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_p03_r1.xhtml], Peak Beauty Sleep, it’s critical tohave a healthy amount of daylight to balance the night. Your pineal glandproduces melatonin based on the contrast of bright sun exposure in the day andcomplete darkness at night.2 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c14-nts2] Ifyou don’t have enough exposure to daylight during the day, your body can’tappreciate the difference and will not optimize your melatonin production, whichis important to regulate healthy beauty sleep cycles.3[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c14-nts3]VITAMIN D SYNTHESIS AND IMMUNE BOOSTSunlight helps your skin synthesize vitamin D, which makes it possible to absorbcalcium. Vitamin D also helps with skin issues like psoriasis, and boosts yourimmunity so you can better fight infections such as colds and the flu. Someresearchers believe it may even help protect against the development of somecancer cells.4 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c14-nts4] Vitamin D isreally a hormone and not a vitamin, and it has been shown in some research tohelp increase testosterone levels in men5[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c14-nts5] and regulate estrogen andprogesterone levels in women.6 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c14-nts6]This assistance in balancing hormones is another huge benefit of sun exposure.Though you can supplement with vitamin D, it’s preferable and more reliable toget vitamin D through moderate sunlight exposure whenever possible.IMPROVED CIRCULATION AND METABOLISMThe sun is good for blood circulation, which, as we discussed earlier, isimportant to ensure the optimal distribution of beauty nutrients throughout yourentire body, and some research is even linking sunlight exposure to a boost inmetabolism.7 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c14-nts7]POSSIBLE PREVENTION OF HEART DISEASE AND CANCERNew research out of the Journal of Investigative Dermatology has found that whensunlight touches the skin, a compound called nitric oxide, which helps lowerblood pressure, is released into the blood vessels.8[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c14-nts8] Head researcher Richard Wellerand his colleagues state, “We are concerned that well-meaning advice to reducethe comparatively low numbers of deaths from skin cancer may inadvertentlyincrease the risk of death from far higher prevalent cardiovascular disease andstroke, and goes against epidemiological data9[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c14-nts9],10[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c14-nts10] showing that sunlight exposurereduces all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.”11[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c14-nts11] The researchers noted that forevery person who succumbed to skin cancer, about sixty to one hundred peoplesuccumb to stroke and heart disease linked to high blood pressure. Thistranslates to eighty times more people dying of cardiovascular disease than skincancer.A study published in the journal Cancer, as well as a systematic reviewpublished in the European Journal of Cancer, found that insufficient exposure tosunlight can be a risk factor for cancer in western Europe and North America,and the malignancies that showed the greatest increase with inadequate exposureto sunlight were reproductive and digestive cancers, namely breast, colon, andovarian cancers.12 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c14-nts12],13[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c14-nts13]SUN EXPOSURE VS. SUN DAMAGEYou may be wondering, what about sun damage and aging? Again, we are definitelynot suggesting that you bake out in the sun 1960s-style, when it was the thingto reflect the sunlight back onto your skin with aluminum foil. What we’retalking about is much more strategic and controlled. When managed this way,limited sun exposure might actually reverse sun damage! Research out of StanfordUniversity found that by triggering the synthesis of vitamin D within the body,limited sun exposure may cause immune cells to travel to the outer layers of theskin, where they are available to protect and help repair damage caused byexcessive sun exposure.14 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c14-nts14]So how much sun is the right balance for your beauty? Well, first of all, wedon’t recommend exposing your delicate facial skin to the sun. It’s tooprecious, and it’s obviously the first place you want to protect against visiblesigns of aging. Always wear a hat when you are exposed to sunlight, and be sureto use nontoxic sunscreen protection.To get healthy sunlight, focus on your limbs. Michael F. Holick, MD, PhD, whoheads up the Vitamin D, Skin, and Bone Research Laboratory at Boston Universityand is the author of the book The UV Advantage, agrees. He recommends sensiblesun exposure of 5 to 10 minutes of direct sunlight on bare legs and arms two orthree times a week.15 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c14-nts15] Applyingsunscreen is definitely recommended for any sun exposure beyond that. The sunwill feel great on your arms and legs during short walks in the sunlight. Tryparking your car a little farther away from the mall or grocery store the nexttime you go shopping and enjoy some extra time in the sun. Take 5 minutes toread outside, to sip your favorite tea, or just to look at the beauty aroundyou, whether you are in the suburbs or in the city. Even in most industrialareas you can usually find something beautiful. This will naturally feelfantastic and delicious for your whole body, which loves getting some light,even for a very short time! Holick also recommends supplementing with 1,000 IUsof vitamin D,16 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c14-nts16] especially inthe winter, when you may not get adequate sunlight.You can also balance the beauty of natural sunlight with foods that are rich invitamins C and E as well as selenium. These are great skin beauty foods thatprotect against sun damage. Karen E. Burke, MD, PhD, of the Mount Sinai Schoolof Medicine says, “These antioxidants work by speeding up the skin’s naturalrepair systems and by directly inhibiting further damage.”17[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c14-nts17] Some great natural sources ofthese Radical Beauty nutrients include acai, blueberries, Brazil nuts, almonds,oranges, and bell peppers.CAPTURING ENERGY DIRECTLY FROM THE LIGHTWe all know that plants convert sunlight into energy. But in 2014 agroundbreaking study published in the Journal of Cell Science suggested thatanimals that consume a chlorophyll-rich diet are also able to derive energydirectly from the sunlight.18 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c14-nts18]Previously, we believed that green plants were the only organisms that were ableto convert sunlight into biological energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate(ATP). This study showed that the mitochondria in animal cells “can also capturelight and synthesize ATP when mixed with a light-capturing metabolite ofchlorophyll.”19 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c14-nts19]In other words, this study implies that animals—including humans—can borrow thelight-harvesting capabilities of chlorophyll when consuming a diet rich in plantfood and use it for energy (ATP) production. Some of the animals researched thatwere fed such a diet and exposed to light also saw an increased life span.Furthermore, the energy coming from the chlorophyll-induced diet and lightexposure was believed to help animal mitochondria function in a healthier way.20[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c14-nts20] This is super exciting from abeauty standpoint, because healthier mitochondria function means a reduction inthe aging caused by free radicals and thus a reduction in cellular damage.21[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c14-nts21]This is a whole new way to think about our diet and the role green vegetablesplay when it comes to our beauty. Besides providing us with an abundance ofvitamins, minerals, and thousands of beauty-building compounds, according tothis research consuming green vegetables may also help us generate energydirectly from the sunlight! This further shows our timeless and infiniteconnection, an unbroken continuum, with nature. Greens are grown in nature andmake up a large part of the diets of our close genetic relatives. The bigtakeaway here is the reinforcement of what we’ve been saying all along: eatclose to nature and become more naturally beautiful and have more beautiful,natural energy.LUNAR (MOON) ENERGYLike the sun, the moon and her cycles have an impact on our energy, albeit inmore subtle ways. While it’s not as obvious as the sunlight that grows plantsand has a visible impact on our skin, the moon, another larger energetic body inour macrocosmic orbit, also impacts our beauty. Our ancestors were more in tunewith the moon’s waning and waxing rhythms and observed and noted them to createtimetables for tending and harvesting crops and organizing community life. Theplanting calendar of biodynamic farming, a type of sustainable organic farmingpracticed globally from France to India and beyond, considers soil fertility,plant growth, and livestock care as a set of ecologically interrelated tasks,22[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c14-nts22] and is synced with the lunarphases of the moon.23 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c14-nts23]There’s been some documented influence of the moon on certain animals, such asthe body weight of honeybees that peaks during a new moon.24[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c14-nts24] Different ancient cultures,verified in some writings from Babylonia and Assyria, have connected a lunarinfluence on humans. It’s recognized that the tides are caused by thegravitational relationship between the moon and the earth, known as the tidalforce. On a micro level, we are made up of around 72 percent water and mightexperience some of the lunar influence from this larger body of energy, such asperiods of feeling more expansive and energized or more retracted and inward.The female menstrual cycle and the complete cycle of the moon, which isapproximately the same number of days, has caused much intrigue over the years.Ayurveda believes that the cycles of the moon and the tides of the ocean aremysterious and powerful ways to display the deep connection a woman has tonature.Just as it is important to keep your waking hours closely tied to the sunrisesand sunsets, traditional systems worldwide believe that there is power insyncing up your activities to the cycles of nature such as the moon cycle.Attuning the collective natural force between certain activities and effortshelps us live more in harmony with nature.The new moon is like a mini New Year’s every month. Think of it as a wonderfulway to refresh each month and create new goals or refocus on your goals with newvigor. It’s a good day for cleansing and a great time to start implementingpositive new habits to benefit your beauty, such as a commitment to drinking hotwater with lemon each morning, drinking more fresh water and giving up soda, ormaking more time to prepare and benefit from some at-home beauty masks. Why waitfor New Year’s? You can experience a personal, renewed commitment to improvingyour beauty every single month.The full moon is when you may feel the strong influence of completeness in yourprojects. You can time your creative projects or goals to reach their peak insync with the full moon. Beauty-wise, this is a great time to prepare and enjoya very nourishing beauty meal that may take a little more effort than usual foryou and your loved ones. Try to enjoy even a few minutes’ “moon bathing” out inthe fullness of the moon’s natural light, which has a cooling, soothing energythat balances the activating sunlight energy in your being.Ancient mystics believe that the waxing, or growing energy, of the moon is agreat time for fertility, taking in nourishment, and building on your intentionsfrom the new moon, while the waning energy that comes after the full moon is agood time for taking stock and cleaning up any old business. This might be agreat time to clean out your fridge, kitchen cupboards, and bathroom cabinets ofany old beauty products or toxic ingredients that don’t serve you anymore.Reclaim only what is fresh and supportive of your life force.BALANCING THE ELEMENTS IN YOUR BODYAccording to Ayurveda’s panchamahaboota theory, everything in theuniverse—including you—is composed of five main elements: earth, water, fire,air, and space (or ether). This theory holds that the elemental constitutionthat makes up your body is not unique, but it is shared with all thingsthroughout nature. In the Chinese medical system there are also five elements:earth, water, fire, wood, and metal. Without going into too much detail aboutthese complex ancient systems, we can use some understanding of them to benefitour beauty by creating more balance. According to Ayurveda, an imbalance ofthese elements can lead to beauty disorders such as acne, brittle hair, and skinthat ages faster than it should.The Ayurvedic dosha theory holds that we all possess each of the five elements,but certain elements are dominant in our bodies. Building on what we saidearlier about the dosha system, we have three dominant elements: Vata, or airconstitution, is represented by the wind in nature; Pitta, or fire constitution,is a representation of the sun; and Kapha, or earth/water constitution, isrepresented by the rocks and solid elements on earth as well as bodies of water.When we are out of balance, the elements within our bodies are also imbalanced.On the other hand, balancing our elemental constitution promotes health anddelays or reduces visible signs of aging. Radical Beauty requires balance andavoiding extremes so you can fully express your natural beauty.Again, this whole concept goes into much more depth, but there are some generalprinciples that you can use for introspection to survey potential areas ofimbalance within yourself while using tangible tools to work on creating abeautiful balance within your body, mind, and spirit. Here are some of thesymptoms of balanced and imbalanced elements and a sampling of the mosteffective tools to get back in balance.VATA (AIR/WIND)Like the wind, this represents the force behind all movements, includinginternal movements such as digestion, elimination, breathing, and circulation.> Symptoms of balanced Vata: creative thinking, inspired, enthusiastic, supple> skin> > Symptoms of imbalanced Vata: constipation, excessive worry and anxiety,> insomnia, and dry skinSome basic tips for balancing Vata include the following:• Incorporate abhyanga into your regular daily practice with a real commitment,as it is especially important for helping to ground and destress the mind.• Get to bed earlier and establish a regular schedule to get more rest.• Protect yourself with proper measures in cold, windy weather since air-basedVata types may be more susceptible to chills and imbalances from chilly weather.• Prioritize regular, proper elimination (with diet, oxygen-magnesium products,probiotics, etc.).• Establish a regular daily routine, which is especially important for Vata.• Avoid caffeine and stimulants.• Favor fresh, light, and easy-to-digest foods. Heavy proteins (red meat, dairy,and the like) are especially hard to digest, so limit or avoid them.• Avoid foods that are extremely light and dry, such as crackers, cold cereals,and packaged snacks.• Incorporate cardamom, cumin, ginger, cinnamon, salt, cloves, mustard seed, andblack pepper in your diet.PITTA (FIRE/SUN)Fire is the transformative element in nature that can enable change, so it hasan important role in digestion and metabolism, governing the digestive agni inyour body.> Symptoms of balanced Pitta: being confident, expressing charisma and> intelligence, and taking action with a clear sense of vision, direction, and> purpose> > Symptoms of imbalanced Pitta: inflammation, diarrhea, indigestion, heartburn,> hives, skin rashes, chronic irritation, premature graying of hair, acneNote: Excessive internal overheating/Pitta is considered very aging.Some basic tips for balancing Pitta include the following:• Avoid spicy food, such as chilies, and “heating” foods and spices, includingtomatoes, radishes, eggplant, beets, garlic, onions, peppers, and mustard seed.• Avoid the tendency to overwork; take more time to rest and rejuvenate.• Incorporate more cooling foods, such as green leafy vegetables, zucchini,green beans, and cucumber. The Glowing Green Smoothie (see recipe, this page[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_c02_r1.xhtml#page27]) is particularly excellent.• Drink “cooling” beverages, such as coconut water, or lemon balm or tulsi tea.KAPHA (EARTH/WATER)Like the tangible elements of earth, such as rivers and rocks, Kapha is whatgives structure to our body and mind and lubrication for our joints and tissues,and helps to form healthy structures (dhatus) of the body.> Symptoms of balanced Kapha: stamina; strength; healthy lubrication and> moistness in skin, hair and joints; devotion; good at following through;> even-tempered; patient; compassionate> > Symptoms of imbalanced Kapha: easily gaining weight (and having a hard time> losing or maintaining ideal weight), slow metabolism, lethargy, excessive> sleep, problems feeling motivated, congestion, stagnation in the lymphatic> system, oily skinSome basic tips for balancing Kapha include the following:• Incorporate some cardio to help ward off stagnation and lethargy. Hiking andbiking are some great examples.• Favor light, dry foods and decrease all oils and excess fats. Try cooking withwater or preparing soups and steaming or baking vegetables with little (or evenno) oil. (Good fats can be consumed in moderate amounts from avocados and otherwhole plant foods.)• Reduce consumption of large amounts of nuts, which are dense.• In warmer months, enjoy a diet made up largely of raw foods, includingvegetables, fruits, some seeds, and small amounts of nuts.• Reduce sodium levels.• Try avoiding gluten and wheat-based products.As micro expressions of the greater macrocosmic universe, we have an inherentconnection to the greater bodies of the sun, the moon, and all the elements ofnature, which also reside within us. Working to optimize their influence on usand balance the universal elements within our own bodies is an important way toalign to your highest expression of Radical Beauty."},{"pageContent":"SHIFT 15:GET CLOSER TO NATURE INDOORS AND OUTHEALING BY “GROUNDING”Most of us intuitively feel good being in nature. You may not realize that thereis actually a word for making direct contact with the earth, but actually thereare two: grounding and earthing. Both terms refer to the healing that takesplace from making direct contact with the earth.There are now studies that show that grounding has major benefits for health aswell as beauty. For instance, a study published in the Journal of Cosmetics,Dermatological Sciences and Applications found that even an hour session ofmaking direct contact with the earth restored the regulation of blood flow tothe face, helping to enhance skin tissue repair and improve facial appearance.1[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c15-nts1] Our intrinsic connection withnature is so great that just by making direct contact with it, our skin beautymeasurably benefits! Mother Nature indeed can be a powerful supporter of ourskin and overall health.How does touching the earth actually improve our health and beauty beyond justfeeling “good”? Just touching the earth, which is electrically conductive,2[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c15-nts2] neutralizes free radicals andbrings you back in sync with the earth’s energy field. Upon contact, thenegative ions from the earth’s surface rush into our bodies to discharge themany unpaired positive ions (or free radicals) we’ve picked up from modernliving. These free radicals stem from regular exposure to environmentalpollutants, heavy metals, radiation, toxicity, and chemicals in the food supply.Those free radicals are associated with disease, aging, and inflammation, butwhen you expose your bare skin to the soil, sand, or grass, the healing powersof the earth neutralize them to keep inflammation and aging in check.Think about how soothing it feels to dig your heels into the sand during a dayat the beach. Now there is science to prove what we’ve intuitively felt allalong: contact with the earth really is healing and necessary to achieve RadicalBeauty. A paper by Dr. James Oschman in the Journal of Alternative andComplementary Medicine3 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c15-nts3]explains how “electron deficiency” from not making enough contact with theearth’s surface causes the immune system to suffer and inflammation to spiralout of control.Free radicals are some of the biggest offenders when it comes to aging, andneutralizing them with negative electrons from the earth quells inflammation andslows or prevents many chronic diseases. A study published in 2013 found thatgrounding has some beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk factors.4[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c15-nts4] It was surmised that this isbecause contact with the earth naturally thins the blood. Other research, from2011, showed that grounding improves heart rate variability, which is not onlybeneficial for the heart but for reducing stress.5[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c15-nts5] Lowered stress levels can helpallay aging.6 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c15-nts6] Grounding alsohelped alleviate muscle soreness in some research,7[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c15-nts7] possibly due to bettercirculation, blood pressure, and blood flow. This is important from a beautystandpoint, as better circulation of nutrients and oxygen will ensure beautiful,healthy skin and hair.HELP FOR BONE HEALTH RIGHT FROM THE EARTHThe Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine discussed a possiblereduction in the likelihood of developing osteoporosis due to less loss ofcalcium and phosphorus through urinary excretion8[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c15-nts8] when subjects spent timeearthing. The loss of these minerals over time is tied to the development ofosteoporosis, so finding out how to reduce the loss could do wonders for bonehealth and to help us maintain a beautiful, upright, and graceful structure.HOW TO GET GROUNDEDGrounding couldn’t be easier—and it’s free! All you have to do is touch theearth whenever you can and as much as you can. Here are some general tips:• Make as much contact as possible directly through your bare feet, whether itmeans popping your shoes off at the local park or just walking around in yourbackyard.• Even a few minutes spent in contact with the earth is beneficial. Try to workit into your life regularly. You can read with your feet on the earth, or have aconversation with friends while strolling barefoot through the park. If theyneed extra motivation, share with them how it’s been proved to be good for skinhealth and reducing aging and inflammation.• If you have access to a grassy backyard, a nice park, or just a field ofgrass, lie down sometimes so your spine has full contact with the earth. You caneven try taking a nap on your back in the grass; you’ll wake up feelingradically recharged.It seems so simple, but remember that some of the most beautiful things in lifeare truly simple. Pets and children intuitively love to frolic in the grass, andit’s time for all of us to focus on reestablishing that sacred connection.Nature is so healing to us; all we have to do is reach out and make contact withher, and she will help us heal from the inside out, while your beauty benefitsas well. You will be able to feel how authentically good earthing is for youbecause the more you participate in earthing, the more reconnected and rechargedyou will feel in the most Radically Beautiful way.MAKING OUR INDOORS CLOSER TO NATUREThough it would be ideal to be outside in nature more, the fact is that most ofus spend the vast majority of our time indoors. We certainly can’t change that,and we also can’t control everything in our environments, such as when you’rewalking down the street and a passing bus blows a spray of nasty exhaust on you,or when you step into a restaurant and get a whiff or two of nasty cigarettesmoke from the smokers lined up outside. You also can’t help it if the soap inpublic restrooms contains chemicals like sulfates that you wouldn’t want to useat home, or you step into a taxi saturated with a sickeningly sweet airfreshener dangling from the rearview mirror.Studies on human exposure to air pollutants by the Environmental ProtectionAgency (EPA) indicate that indoor levels of pollutants may be two to fivetimes—and even upwards of over one hundred times—higher than outdoor pollutantlevels.9 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c15-nts9] While this may seemshocking if concerns about indoor pollution have never really crossed your mind,further consider the fact that indoor air pollutants have been ranked among thetop five environmental risks to public health.The problem is that with air-conditioning, heating, and modern office buildingsand hotels, many windows are permanently sealed, and very little circulating airenters indoor spaces. This allows indoor pollutants to accumulate to levels thatcan affect your health and, yes, your beauty. Taking measures to reduce indoorpollution is especially important for those who are pregnant, nursing, or havechildren, as these pollutants may even disrupt normal brain and organdevelopment.10 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c15-nts10] Anything toxicis not in alignment with the natural biorhythms of your body and is going tocreate free radicals, disrupt your system, and diminish your natural beauty.But we are not completely helpless to external factors. We can control ourpersonal environments to a great extent, and there is much you can do totransform your personal environment into one that nourishes rather than hindersyour beauty. It’s empowering when you realize all you can do to make theseimportant shifts. There are a lot of them.Here are some measures you can take to reduce toxicity in your home and in anyindoor spaces you spend time in.DITCH AIR FRESHENERSNobody likes a smelly bathroom, but spraying air fresheners into the airregularly is far worse for you than enduring temporary unpleasant bathroomsmells. A study from the University of Washington found that eight unnamed,widely used US air fresheners released an average of eighteen chemicals into theair,11 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c15-nts11] including some volatileorganic chemicals (VOCs) that are considered toxic or hazardous.If you want to make your home or office smell fresh (as we all do), just open awindow, burn a nontoxic soy candle, fill an essential oil diffuser, or crackopen a box of good ol’ baking soda, which naturally helps to fight odors. Alsowork to get rid of the source of the smell in the first place; it might meanreplacing something that’s old or past its prime (like an old carpet), whichwould end up being a positive change all around.USE NATURAL CLEANING METHODSIt’s absolutely critical to reduce toxic cleaning products in your home acrossthe board—from dish soaps to carpet cleaners, all surface and cleaning sprays,and so on. Go green all the way! Your health and beauty are worth it. Get a bigtrash can and clean house (pun intended), ridding your whole space of toxicchemicals. You can find some nontoxic DIY natural cleaning products to get yourspace spic-and-span without any toxic petroleum-based chemicals (see this page[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_c15_r1.xhtml#page216]). Lemons, baking soda, andvinegar are fantastic natural cleaning ingredients, and you might be surprisedat how well they work compared with their toxic, chemical-filled counterparts.VACUUM REGULARLYRegularly vacuum all indoor spaces using an appliance with a HEPA filter, whichstands for “high-efficiency particulate air.” A HEPA filter is a type ofmechanical air filter that works by forcing air through a fine mesh filter thattraps harmful particles and ensures they don’t get blown back out into yourspace (which obviously would defeat the purpose of your hard work!). Theseparticles include pollutants, allergens, dust, and brominated fire-retardantchemicals (known as PBDEs). Be sure to wash out your filter regularly.MOP ITAccording to the Environmental Working Group, ordinary house dust is a complexmixture of pet dander, fungal spores, particulates from indoor aerosols, soiltracked in by foot traffic, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that evaporate atroom temperature, and traces of metals, and these contaminants may degrade moreslowly in dust.12 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c15-nts12] Regularmopping, especially with the use of microfiber mops, captures dust and dirt fromsurfaces that vacuuming tends to leave behind. You can mop with plain water(after vacuuming), a nontoxic soap, or some diluted white vinegar.KEEP A STRICT SHOE-FREE POLICYIf you’ve ever traveled to Asia, you know that in many countries it’s customaryto remove your shoes upon entering a home or traditional restaurant. This is anexcellent policy to greatly reduce pesticides, pollutants, and toxins that canbe tracked into your home from the bottoms of shoes and then absorbed throughbare feet (yuck!). This is especially true if you practice yoga at home andplace your face near the floor, or if you have toddlers and children whose handsoften make contact with the floor.Think about it…what is on the bottom of your shoes? If you’ve ever been to NewYork City or any other large city and seen the sidewalks there, it might feelpretty nasty to want to have any skin contact with the bottoms of your shoes.It’s like walking barefoot on the sidewalk, which is something you wouldprobably never want to do! It is coated with visible and invisible amounts ofgarbage (including a range of hazardous products to simply nasty decaying food),chemicals, human spit, dog feces and urine (probably human also mixed in there),and who knows what else. But no matter where you live, you might be unknowinglytracking in a whole host of toxins into your home with just your shoes. It mightbe an adjustment to kick off your shoes as soon as you walk into your home andencourage everyone else to do the same, but your home will feel so much cleaner,and you will soon be happy you made the switch to shoes-free. You won’t want togo back!TEST FOR RADONRadon is a radioactive gas that is linked to lung cancer. It stems from thenatural decay of uranium found in soil that potentially moves into homes throughcracks and holes in the foundation. Even if your home is new, it could stillhave a radon issue. Granite countertops are also linked to radon. You can testfor radon and even get a do-it-yourself radon kit. If the results show thatsomething needs to be shifted, call a qualified radon mitigation specialist tohelp.USE NATURAL LAUNDRY DETERGENTWhile it’s tempting to buy the jumbo-sized detergents that are inexpensivelypriced at the local drugstore, unfortunately the synthetic fragrances in laundryproducts are often a source of petroleum-derived chemicals—not to mention theother chemicals in the detergents themselves, which not only can be irritantsbut also emit toxins into the air that can also be absorbed through your skin.All these chemicals may have negative health effects when inhaled, just asphthalates are known to disrupt hormones. There are great, highly effective, andnontoxic laundry detergents available now, some even coming in jumbo sizes also,so make sure to seek them out.GIVE UP AEROSOLAnything that spews out micro particles you can inhale is something you want toeliminate from your space. These include deodorants (see a clean DIY version onthis page [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_c06_r1.xhtml#page119]), hair sprays,furniture and carpet cleaners, and definitely air fresheners and sprays. Justuse natural and nonspray versions of the items you want to use.OPEN YOUR WINDOWSIt’s important to let fresh air regularly flush out your space to keeppollutants and chemicals from building up. Cross-ventilation is especially greatif you can open opposing windows and let the breeze flow through. Bathroom andkitchen fans that exhaust to the outdoors also increase ventilation and helpremove pollutants.DIY HOME CLEANING PRODUCTSOne of the most powerful ways you can take charge of your personal space andmake it one that supports your Radical Beauty is to ban chemicals whenever andwherever you can. These natural cleaning solutions are effective at keeping yourspace clean but won’t add beauty-diminishing chemicals to your space.RADICAL BEAUTY NON-STREAK, NONTOXIC GLASS CLEANERAll you have to do is peer at the bright blue color of most commercial glasscleaners or check out the warnings on the back of such products to know thatthese cleaners are not a beautiful thing to have around your space.

A two-year research project conducted by NASA found thatplants—even the microorganisms in the soil—can reduce indoor air pollutantssubstantially.13 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c15-nts13] The plantshelp purify your home, absorbing chemical pollutants given off by syntheticmaterials. According to NASA, some of the best plants to promote indoor airquality are spider plant, peace lily, bamboo, snake plant, heartleafphilodendron, elephant ear philodendron, and different varieties of dracaena.MAKE YOUR HOME A NO-SMOKING ZONEOkay, this is an obvious one, but it’s a biggie when it comes to air pollution.Secondhand cigarette smoke is rife with contaminants, and exposure is linked toissues like bronchitis, asthma, and ear infections. Have smoker relatives orfriends? Besides encouraging them to quit, politely let them know that they haveto smoke outside (and far, far away from doors and open windows).CHANGE FILTERSJust because your air conditioner hasn’t broken down yet doesn’t mean you don’thave to pay any attention to it! Most air conditioners and heaters havereplaceable filters, so it’s a good idea to replace them often (well before theybite the dust) to keep debris and pollutants out of your beauty space.WASH UPOnce a week, wash your sheets, pillowcases, mattress pads, duvet covers, andblankets with hot water to clean out any compiling dust, mold, and the like.ADJUST THE HUMIDITYHumidity can have an effect on the concentrations of some indoor air pollutants.The ideal range is between 30 and 50 percent. If it’s too humid in your home,try opening the windows or using a dehumidifier.CHOOSE MORE BEAUTIFUL DRY CLEANINGMost of us drop off our dry cleaning and don’t give it another thought untilit’s time to pick it up. But most dry cleaners—around 85 percent, in fact—use asolvent called perchloroethylene, or “perc,” a chemical the EnvironmentalProtection Agency (EPA) considers both a health and environmental hazard thathas been identified as a possible human carcinogen and been linked toneurological effects, kidney and liver damage,14[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c15-nts14] and possibly birth defects andreproductive issues.15 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c15-nts15]There are, however, dry-cleaning methods that do not use perc; seek these out toalleviate the concern of this toxin leaching into your beautiful body. Look fordry cleaners advertised as being “green,” which can use several alternatives.One of these is wet cleaning, which the EPA considers one of the safestprofessional cleansing methods, as there is no hazardous chemical use. Carbondioxide cleaning is nontoxic and is also considered environmentally friendly.CHECK APPLIANCESInspect fuel-burning appliances regularly for leaks, and make repairs whennecessary.SET BOUNDARIES WITH PETSPets are indeed wonderful, but the truth is that dogs and other outdoor pets cantrack in a lot of environmental pollutants on their paws. Ideally, it would be agood idea to keep furry friends out of your bedroom and certainly off your bed,as well as off couches and fabric-covered furniture. Think about it: paws arelike your pets’ shoes, and you wouldn’t want anyone’s shoes tramping arounddirectly all over your bed and couch!ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD POLLUTIONIn the modern world we live in, we are constantly being assailed by an invisibleform of pollution from electromagnetic fields, also known as EMFs. Electric andmagnetic fields are invisible force lines that surround any electrical device.Even smaller devices, such as a radio alarm clock near your head on yournightstand table, can emit EMFs. Today, there are many various sources of EMFpollution, including cell phones, computers and laptops, TVs, wireless babymonitors, wireless gaming consoles, microwave ovens, high- and low-voltage powerlines, cell phone towers, and other types of electronic equipment.EMF pollution can affect every organ and every cell of your body. In asimplified sense, when an electromagnetic wave passes through your body, itinduces an electric current inside you that can interfere with many of yourbody’s natural biological processes.There is controversy about the extent and specificity to which EMFs can affecthuman health. But most researchers would agree that taking reasonable steps tohelp reduce your EMF exposure is warranted. Some research has concluded thatmagnetic fields are potentially carcinogenic,16[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c15-nts16] and the World HealthOrganization stated in a 2011 press release that cell phones could be acarcinogen with excessive use.17[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c15-nts17] The BioInitiative WorkingGroup, made up of an international group of scientists, researchers, and publichealth professionals, put out a report in 2012 with their conclusion thatmagnetic fields can be linked to various health issues, including impairedstress responses, childhood cancers such as leukemia and compromised immunefunction, neurology, and behavior.18[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c15-nts18]What can you do?• Switch off electronic devices when possible. This includes turning your cellphone off (or at least to airplane mode) at bedtime to prevent the signal fromcoming in.• Avoid electronic alarm clocks in your bedroom and switch to battery-operatedones.• Replace wireless devices with wired alternatives, such as swapping out awireless headset for a wired one. Use corded baby monitors, or if that is notpossible, keep your baby monitor at least 6 feet away from your baby.• Try to reduce cell phone use as much as possible (seemingly hard but notimpossible) by talking on landlines and using wired headsets as much aspossible.• Avoid microwaves. In addition to their EMF output, microwaves may potentiallyalter or even destroy your food’s nutrition. For instance, research published inthe journal Pediatrics found that microwaving breast milk cuts down on lysozymeactivity, reduces key antibodies, promotes potentially dangerous bacteria, anddestroys immunoglobulin A antibodies, which fight invading microbes.19[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c15-nts19]"},{"pageContent":"PILLAR 5:BEAUTIFUL MOVEMENTNature designed the body to move, and when it moves correctly, the bodymaintains itself exquisitely. Stasis is the enemy, which doesn’t come as goodnews in a society where sedentary lifestyles are on the rise. How you choose tomove your body has an effect on your entire being, including your health andyour mental and emotional states, as well as the more obvious physical resultslike the tone of your muscles and your external beauty.The first and greatest single benefit you can receive comes the moment youdecide to get up out of your chair to stand, move, and be active. Gravity itselfcreates healthy movement in the lymphatic system, which is well understood, butthere seem to be hidden reasons why standing up and letting gravity do its workis important. A key study of college varsity athletes put them in bed for twoweeks without getting up—once considered the best regimen for patientsrecovering from serious injury, surgery, and even childbirth.But total rest does the opposite of what it was intended to do. At the end ofthe two weeks, the athletes had lost the equivalent of two years of musclebuilding. Most of this so-called disuse atrophy is prevented by having patientsstand up and move around as soon as possible in their recovery. On the other endof the spectrum, popular fitness maxims like “No pain, no gain” inspire us tobelieve that in order to see results, we have to virtually torture ourselves atthe gym, pushing ourselves to the point of gasping for air or dripping withsweat. While these methods will certainly get you some results, overdoing it canbe aging. There are other types of movements that more effectively support youroverall energy and beauty while delaying the aging process.There are other benefits to strategic movements. In a study of people who wantedto lose weight, one group was put on a running program, another on a joggingprogram, and a third group was simply asked to walk. The walking group lost themost weight. They demonstrated the fact that muscles stop burning oxygen duringheavy activity, and therefore the metabolism that burns fat is shut down. Somestudies show markedly improved health and longevity among people who stand morethan 13 hours a day, compared with workers who stand less than 2 hours. Werecommend, as do many experts, that you stand up and move around briefly atleast once an hour.If you move in a strategic way, you will not only see the tangible results of asculpted, lithe, strong body, but you will also optimize the flow of energythroughout your joints, spine, and entire being. This stimulates your endocrineand other glands and keeps your body more energetically open so it can functionat its peak.When you stop moving, energy stagnates, and illness and sickness can build up.1[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#p05-nts1] Body tension is created by theresistance to the flow of energy and a lack of oxygen. As your body stiffens, socan your mind, and you can become resistant to change. There is an uninterruptedflow of energy between the emotional, mental, and physical aspects of yourbeing, and properly moving your body affects each part equally. In this pillaryou’ll learn which types of movements age you and which ones are the mostbeneficial in terms of making you Radically Beautiful."},{"pageContent":"SHIFT 16:INCORPORATE FLUID MOVEMENT THROUGHOUT YOUR DAYYOUR MOVEMENT AFFECTS YOUR ENTIRE LIFE EXPERIENCEThe foods you eat cannot adequately be reduced down to a series of numbers, andthe same is true for how you move. The sole utility of your workouts isn’t thenumber of calories or the amount of fat you burn. Moving affects your overalllife. Here are just some of the many ways that moving benefits you:• Increases energy• Makes you feel strong and powerful in your body• Helps you create and maintain a healthy weight• Lowers cholesterol, triglycerides, and the risk of high blood pressure• Builds healthy bones• Reduces inflammation1 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c16-nts1]• Promotes better sleep• Releases “feel good” chemicals called endorphins to improve mood and combatdepression2 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c16-nts2]• Increases focus, memory, and sharper thinking and learning3[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c16-nts3]• Improves circulation• Increases longevity• Works on a cellular level to decrease the toll of stress on your agingprocess4 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c16-nts4]• Improves self-esteem and body image (critical to being beautiful is feelingbeautiful!)And while it’s been well documented that moving and exercising in generalimprove your mood, the types of movements that flow through your body affectyour overall mentality, your emotions, and your state of being. Try to recallthe last time you were at a party or a wedding and danced in a free-form way,just feeling the music and having fun. Afterward you probably felt free, alive,and exhilarated. This feeling of freedom is magnetic and beautiful, andtranslates to an outwardly joyful energy that is very attractive. This is aperfect example of how your bodily movements have a profound impact on the stateof your mind and your overall beauty.If you only move in a linear, straightforward, and rigid fashion, such as on atreadmill or stair climber, you may start to become more linear in the way youthink and feel in your body. In contrast, incorporating flowing movements, suchas dance or yoga, can help inspire creative thinking. But it’s not just theactual movements your body makes that have an impact—the environment in whichyou move your body also makes an enormous difference.Surfing the dynamic waves of the ocean can make you feel connected to thenatural world around you in a way that’s impossible when slugging it out onweight machines or even on a simulated surfing machine. Hiking on uneven terrainin the fresh air can help you feel more vigorous and free in your body thandoing the same incline level on a treadmill. If you live in an urbanenvironment, trekking up some local hills in neighborhoods with sidewalks ornearby parks would also allow you to gain the benefits from much-needed timeoutside and away from indoor buildings.Your mind and body are fused together, and one closely affects the other. It’snot that any particular forms of movement are necessarily “bad” and should beavoided altogether, and factors like the weather, convenience, and your schedulemight mean that the gym is your only option on certain days. That’s fine. But weencourage you to balance the movements in your life and incorporate free-form,natural movements outside in the elements whenever possible. This will help keepyour energy circulating in the most dynamic and free way, which is a keycomponent to Radical Beauty.RADICAL BEAUTY EXERCISE GUIDELINES• Weave activity and movement into your daily life.• Strive for around an hour of movement at least five days a week.• According to the Physical Guidelines for Activity for Americans put out by theUS government, at least 2.5 hours a week of moderate-intensity aerobic activityis recommended for adults. For more extensive health benefits, increase aerobicactivity to 5 hours of moderate intensity weekly, and include two days or more aweek of muscle-strengthening activities.5[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c16-nts5]• Make an effort to get out in the fresh air and nature as much aspossible—ideally weekly.• Remember that smaller, shorter activities throughout the day add up!• Find forms of movement that you enjoy and will stick with.• Mix circular and nonlinear forms of movement into your weekly routine. TryVinyasa yoga, dance classes or free-form dance, rock climbing, various kinds ofteam sports (like volleyball), or other outdoor activities you can try in yourarea.• Another option if you are crunched for time is high-interval training, whichis a short, intense workout for a few minutes that requires recovery time.6[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c16-nts6] These types of exercise maycompact the time for working out due to their more vigorous nature, but they mayfeel too depleting for some, so listen to your body and stick to the type ofmovement that feels good to you. If you always dread something, you likely won’tstick with it long-term.Every component of the Radical Beauty lifestyle is tied together. Earlier wetalked about grounding (see this page[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_c15_r1.xhtml#page209]) and the profound benefits ofmaking contact with nature. Even if you aren’t literally grounding by walkingbarefoot while you walk, jog, or hike, you’ll reap a lot of the same benefitsfrom being around trees, including fresh, oxygen-rich air and the inexplicablejoy of connecting with nature. We are part of nature, and it inherently feelswonderful for us to reconnect with the bigger whole of which we are part.SITTING AND LACK OF MOVEMENT DIMINISH YOUR BEAUTYFailing to move your body has an extremely adverse effect on your overallbeauty. But even if you regularly engage in intense exercise, you might still beaccruing body fat and harmful health effects from sitting for long periodsduring the day. In other words, an hour of exercise does not necessarily balancethe negative effects of a nonstop hour of sitting.7[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c16-nts7] If you want to feel and lookyour most beautiful, it’s critical to break up your periods of sitting duringthe day.If you take a moment to tally the amount of time you spend in your car, at yourdesk, and perhaps in front of a television set, you might be shocked to see howmuch it all adds up. Dr. James Levine, director of the Mayo Clinic–Arizona StateUniversity Obesity Solutions Initiative, promotes the phrase “Sitting is the newsmoking.”8 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c16-nts8] Studying the adverseeffects of the increasingly sedentary Western lifestyle for years has led Levineand others to believe that sitting and being inactive for long periods isextremely dangerous to your health. For example, researchers have found evidencethat prolonged sitting affects the blood sugar levels and insulin in the body,and that sitting too much can actually increase the risk of developing severalserious illnesses, such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and colon andendometrial cancer.9 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c16-nts9] An articlepublished in Diabetologia examined the results of eighteen studies with nearly800,000 participants and determined that those who sat the most were twice aslikely to develop type 2 diabetes compared with those who sat the least.10[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c16-nts10]Sitting too much can also keep you from feeling beautifully joyful. If you sitfor longer periods, your circulation can be reduced, and it may be harder foryour “feel-good” brain chemicals (neurotransmitters, endorphins, andendocannabinoids) to make their way to receptors.11[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c16-nts11] A study published in theAmerican Journal of Preventive Medicine that looked at over 9,000 middle-agedwomen found that women who sat more than 7 hours a day were 47 percent morelikely to suffer from depression than those who sat 4 hours or fewer.12[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c16-nts12] Our natural state is to bedynamic and moving, and if we don’t live in alignment with our authentic nature,we simply won’t feel as genuinely happy.The negative impact of sitting nearly all day is a relatively new problem. Ourancestors spent most of their days upright and moving, first while seeking outand gathering their own food, and in later generations while working in thefields, building structures, and getting around by foot or horseback. Technologyand modern farming have put us in a position where we hardly need to move at allin order to get everything done. This may be a luxury in some ways, but as aresult, we as a society move around on average 90 percent less than ourancestors did just one hundred years ago.13[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c16-nts13]WALKING FOR DIGESTIONA central belief in Ayurveda is that energy has to stay in motion within us andin our lives in order to continually nourish us and create harmony. On theopposite end of the spectrum is stagnation, which leads to ama, or toxicitybuildup. It is a highly recommended practice in Ayurveda to go for a 15-minutewalk after dinner. This practice is believed to help promote digestion, as wellas the assimilation and circulation of nutrients all around your body.This easy practice of walking after dinner could be coupled with gazing upon thesunset, particularly in the summer, or doing some errands like taking out thetrash, dropping off dry cleaning, or picking up pet food. Strolling around theneighborhood can be a great bonding experience to share with your family orroommates as you do something great for your health and promote your RadicalBeauty. Try it for yourself.Movement shouldn’t be an all-or-nothing proposition. Just because you can’t getto the gym doesn’t mean you have to sit and be completely inactive, forgoing allmovement for the whole day. Remember, it’s all about balance. Research has shownthat whether or not you exercise regularly, taking breaks from long periods ofsitting can stave off some of the negative effects of inactivity such as highcholesterol, triglycerides, and inflammation.14[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c16-nts14] Even very short breaks can bebeneficial.15 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c16-nts15] Whether or notyou set aside time each day to exercise, incorporating micro movements and miniroutines into your daily life can be great for your health.A study from The Journal of Physiology tested levels of an enzyme that breaksdown fat in three groups of mice: mice that lay down for most of the day, stoodfor most of the day, or exercised.16[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c16-nts16] Not surprisingly, the enzymeactivity in the lying mice was very low, while the levels rose more than tentimes when the mice simply stood. However, a surprising finding was thatexercise had no additional effects on the enzyme levels in the mice’s legs. Theresearchers surmised that even if you don’t exercise rigorously, simply spendingmuch of the day standing over sitting would lead to big benefits.SUPPORT FOR THE STANDING DESKSince many of us have jobs that require us to sit for several hours, an optionthat is growing in popularity is the standing desk. A standing desk is builtspecifically for you to work at while standing up. Many of them convert intoseated desks so you can alternate periods of standing and sitting throughout theday. It may take a bit of getting used to if you’re accustomed to sitting allday, but you’ll probably soon find that you feel more awake and think morecreatively when working standing up. Some companies have even reported anincrease in productivity when employees use standing desks. If you spend severalhours a day working at a desk, this might be an ideal option for you. If gettinga new desk is out of your budget at the moment, you can try creating your ownstanding desk by stacking books or solid boxes in one corner of your desk toyour standing height, and propping your laptop on them to work.Make sure to get up and stretch or go for a quick walk to the printer, to grabmore water, or just to circle around your office or home at least every 20 to 30minutes. Eventually it will feel like second nature to get up more often, evenif it feels like a lot of moving around at first. Whether or not you exercise,you can’t sit the rest of the day and expect your body to respond by reflectingits maximum health and beauty potential.RADICAL BEAUTY DAILY MOVEMENT SOLUTIONSIt’s clear by now that your life shouldn’t be drastically divided into twoopposing states: exercise and inactivity. Movement needs to be broken up duringthe entire day in order for you to glean optimal health and beauty benefits.Here are some of the top ways you can incorporate movement throughout your day.TAKE FREQUENT BREAKSAt least every 30 minutes or so, stand up and stretch, walk around for a fewminutes, or run an errand. You can even do a few exercises like push-ups or withfree weights next to your desk if you work from home, or if it doesn’t feel tooweird in your office. If you sit in an open space, just walking around might bea more feasible (and less awkward) option.TAKE THE STAIRSThis is an oldie but goodie recommendation that you may have been hearing foryears but never followed. Taking a deep breath and bypassing the elevator infavor of the stairwell is an easy way to incorporate more activity in youreveryday life. You can start with two floors and build from there, using theelevator to fill in the rest.SOCIALIZE WHILE MOVINGInstead of meeting friends for coffee, tea, lunch, or dinner, meet up for a hikeor a walk through your neighborhood. You’ll be able to chat and catch up whilebeing active together.MAXIMIZE YOUR LUNCH HOURUse this time to walk around the neighborhood near your office. You can get inat least a good mile if you walk for a brisk 15 to 18 minutes. Keep somesneakers at your desk and pop them on before heading out at lunchtime.WALK AND TALKWalk around while talking on the phone. Thanks to cell phones, no longer do youhave to be rooted in a seated position to talk. This practice alone could createa lot of movement during your day.TALK FACE TO FACEWalk down the hallway to see a colleague rather than e-mailing them. Thisencourages more social interaction as well as movement—two diminishing yethealthy aspects of our society. After all, we were meant to have some regularsocial interactions as human beings.TRADE YOUR CHAIR FOR A STABILITY BALLThis will encourage you to use your core muscles during the day to remainstabilized. Don’t worry if your colleagues chuckle at your “chair ball” atfirst. Eventually they will probably want to get one also, and you can feel smugthat you were the office trendsetter who started it all.PARK FARTHERGet in the habit of choosing a spot in the back of the parking lot so you canget a longer walk into the store. This is especially great while you’re outrunning errands during lunchtime to break up all of that sitting you do.DITCH THE CARIf possible, walk or bike to work or to do any errands you can. If you take thebus or the subway, get off at an earlier stop so you can walk some distance toget home or to work.PLAY WITH YOUR KIDSGet outside and try kicking or throwing a ball around. This is a great way toestablish regular movement practices for the whole family and help your childrenset healthy habits for an active life.MULTITASK DURING TV TIMEIf you do watch TV, this is one great time to multitask (unlike at mealtimes).Keep a yoga mat near your television set and get in the habit of doing a fewyoga poses (see this page [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_c17_r1.xhtml#page246]–thispage [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_c17_r1.xhtml#page255]) or stretches whilewatching your favorite show. And try to avoid “binge watching” whole seasons inone or two sittings, which is now possible with streaming. Try to disciplineyourself to old school, prestreaming style: one episode at a time.THE AGING EFFECTS OF OVEREXERCISINGWhile there are so many benefits to moving throughout the day, there is such athing as overdoing it. It’s well established that moderate amounts of exercisecan increase antioxidant defenses and offer innumerable health and beautybenefits such as increased circulation and blood flow. Excessive movement,however, can actually be depleting and create oxidative stress, a form offree-radical creation that leads to accelerated aging.17[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c16-nts17] This is when your workoutstops working for you and may actually start doing more harm than good.First, let’s define oxidative stress. Free radicals are morphed cells that yourbody creates as a result of exposure to pollutants and toxicity, as well asnatural processes like metabolism. Your body uses different antioxidants toprevent and control damage from these free radicals. When free radicalsoverwhelm your antioxidant defenses, your cells become damaged. This damage iscalled oxidative stress.18 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c16-nts18]There’s a lot of data suggesting that oxidative stress contributes toinflammation and aging in different ways,19[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c16-nts19],20[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c16-nts20],21[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c16-nts21] including aging of the skin22[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c16-nts22] and the hair,23[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c16-nts23] and numerous studies,including research from Advances in Clinical Chemistry, show that acute bouts ofexercise can induce a state of oxidative stress.24[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c16-nts24]You don’t have to be fearful of any amount of oxidative stress. It would benearly impossible to live without having some in your body, and even newerresearch is finding that oxidative stress is beneficial in small amounts byprompting your body to increase its antioxidants.25[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c16-nts25] Over time, this can help yourbody recover more quickly. In other words, you can become slightly more immuneto the effects of oxidative stress. Research on serious athletes with thehighest training volumes, experience, and levels of fitness shows that theyhandle oxidative stress well.26[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c16-nts26]So how much is too much oxidative stress? Your body only has so manyantioxidants to combat free radicals before inflammation and the effects ofaging weigh down the beauty of your skin, hair, and body. Too much oxidativestress could deplete your antioxidant reserves. It is generally believed thatlong, intense exercise such as running marathons and endurance training causesmore oxidative stress than humans can handle.27[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c16-nts27] During extreme and prolongedexercise, your body runs out of antioxidants, allowing free radicals tooverwhelm your cells and oxidative stress to rise far beyond healthy levels.Dr. James O’Keefe, a cardiologist who authored a review for the Mayo Clinic onthe adverse cardiovascular effects of excessive exercise,28[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c16-nts28] stated in a TED talk that “ifwe went out for a run right now and you ran hard…by 60 minutes something startshappening….The free radicals blossom, and it starts burning the heart. It startssearing and inflaming the inside of your coronary arteries.”29[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c16-nts29]Hearing the words burning, searing, and inflaming to describe what excessiveexercise can do to your cardiovascular function probably makes you want tocringe. It sounds horrifying! It’s easy to paint visual images around thesevisceral words. But just as excessive oxidative stress can “sear” your heart, itcan also “sear” your beauty, showing up as weathered and wrinkled skin. Rememberthat everything in your body affects everything else. Earlier we talked abouthow cardiovascular function has an impact on the distribution of beautynutrients, so the harmful effects described by Dr. O’Keefe extend beyond yourheart and include your beauty.If you are a competitive athlete, you’ll want to be sure to eat a superior,antioxidant-rich, high-plant-food diet every single day to compensate for yourintense training. However, being a “weekend warrior,” or someone who doesn’thave as much time to work out consistently during the week and slaves away forlong hours on the weekend, may cause a disruption to your body’s overallbalance, or homeostasis.30 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c16-nts30] Aswe discussed extensively earlier, breaking up your movement over not only theweek but throughout the day is the healthiest and most beautifying way toapproach your exercise routine.BEAUTIFUL SWEATWhile you don’t want to overexert and deplete yourself in order to break asweat, sweat in and of itself is a beautiful thing. You may not feel sobeautiful while you are drenched and sticky, but after a shower and perhaps adrink of coconut water, you’ll likely feel more energized and beautiful than youdid before your sweating session.Sweat, a by-product of the circulatory process to cool down your body, is afantastic way to promote detoxification. The increased blood flow that comeswith sweating increases your circulation, which improves your skin’s elasticityand tone, making it more beautiful over time. Because sweating is a great way topromote more overall movement throughout your system, it can even enhancedigestion and help eliminate constipation, thereby removing waste products andpromoting youthful energy and beauty.Through the skin, we can detoxify heavy metals (including mercury and lead),31[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c16-nts31] pesticides, herbicides, andother toxins from our system and keep them from circulating within our bodies,where they can contribute to inflammation and free radicals,32[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c16-nts32] diminishing our health andbeauty. Sweating is also a great way to boost your endorphins,33[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c16-nts33] which can improve your moodand make you feel happier.Some of the most beneficial ways to break a sweat are by moving outside in thefresh air. This includes hiking, biking, walking, and playing outdoor sportslike tennis. Some indoor activities such as yoga (which can also be practicedoutside when the weather permits) and dance or dance-fitness classes can also behighly beneficial. There are different forms of heated yoga that use anartificial heat source in a closed room with stagnant air. While this iscertainly a way to promote sweat, it’s more natural to pursue yoga where theheat builds from your own breath and movement rather than from an artificialsource.Infrared and regular saunas are also great sweating resources. Try breaking asweat ideally twice or more on a weekly basis throughout the year, hydratingwell before and afterward, to get maximum beauty benefits.Everyone has a different capacity for exercise, but working out at a moderate tohigh intensity for more than 1 to 2 hours a day can generally be consideredextreme (unless you happen to be an Olympic or otherwise very competitiveathlete). That being said, overdoing it is different for each individual and canshift over time. If you naturally build up your fitness levels over thelong-term, your body can begin to handle oxidative stress levels better than ifyou don’t work out for months and then jump right into a killer workout. Makesure to progress at a reasonable pace and allow for adequate recovery timebetween training sessions.Listen to your body, and be on the lookout for signs of overtraining, such asfeeling sick, moody, anxious, or irritated. If you experience changes to yoursleep, appetite, performance, or libido, or feel chronically sore or achy,34[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c16-nts34] you just might be exercisingpast your optimal limit. If you listen to your body, you can feel when you areoverwhelming yourself with oxidative stress instead of getting the healthyamount of exercise that produces a toned, lean body and glowing skin.PROPERLY TIMING YOUR EXERCISE AND FOODUnless you are an endurance athlete who needs to fuel up in extreme amounts,exercising right after eating a meal or consuming heavy snack foods is notrecommended. This impairs your agni, or digestion, and splits your energybetween digesting and nourishing your muscles for your workout. Blood flow ispulled out of your stomach and digestive tract to go into your muscles. It’sakin to multitasking for your body. Imagine if you had to have a seriousconversation while writing a meaningful e-mail; your communication on bothfronts would suffer. It’s just not possible to do two things really well at thesame time. Focusing your energy and attention on one task at a time is the bestway to be really successful at anything, and this also applies to your body’senergy. Allow it to be used maximally either for digestion or exercise.Space your meals and workouts out so you have energy for your beauty-buildingmovement practices. Ideally, heavy foods should be consumed at least 2 hoursbefore exercise to allow for enough energy to break them down, although asdiscussed previously, a gentle 15-minute walk after eating is highlyrecommended. Here are some specific tips for workouts at various times of theday.MORNING WORKOUTSBEFORE: Depending on how early your workout is, it might feel better on an emptystomach (especially for a yoga practice). Or, if you need something in yourstomach, a banana, some berries, or a Glowing Green Smoothie (see recipe on thispage [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_c02_r1.xhtml#page27]) are light choices thatdigest well. Fruit, an easy-to-digest carb, consumed prior to exercise could bebeneficial and would not limit fat burning.35[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c16-nts35]AVOID: Anything very heavy like a big breakfast of eggs and bacon right before aworkout requires a great deal of energy to digest. You’ll have aless-than-efficient workout and less-than-efficient digestion. Beauty-wise, youlose out on both sides.AFTERWARD: If you didn’t have it before working out, this is a great time foryour Glowing Green Smoothie. If you’re still hungry after the GGS, follow itwith some oatmeal or a Power Protein Smoothie (see kimberlysnyder. com[http://kimberlysnyder.com] for recipe). If you did a high-resistance workoutand are interested specifically in building lean muscle tone, follow your GGSwith a simple mix of coconut water, banana, and spirulina. This is low in fatbut provides the carbs and amino acid spectrum needed for recovery. Sincespirulina is an algae that breaks down and digests easily, you could also addspirulina to your Glowing Green Smoothie (though concentrated protein powdersare not recommended in your GGS; save them for shakes later in the day).AFTERNOON/EVENING WORKOUTSBEFORE: Get fuel in the form of carbohydrates and protein during the day. Thereis research indicating the importance of consuming amino acids and carbohydratesbefore resistance exercise to help build muscle.36[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c16-nts36] Try having some quinoa for thecarbs and protein at lunch or some mushrooms or baked veggies, an avocado orsunflower seed kale salad, soup, or a protein shake, or chia seed pudding soyou’ll be fueled up and ready to go a couple hours later. The Glowing GreenSmoothie would also fill this need as a snack, as greens are high in amino acidsand the banana and other fruit in the recipe supply some carbs.AVOID: Eating heavy foods within 2 hours of your workout, whatever time thatmight be. If you end up getting really hungry and needing something, a banana oranother Glowing Green Smoothie are two good ideas.AFTERWARD: If you are hungry before dinner, a banana can also be goodpost-workout, as it has complex carbs, potassium, and fiber. Having some proteinis important to rebuild your muscles after a strengthening workout, so a PowerProtein Smoothie, veggies and hummus, nuts, seeds (chia seeds are especiallybeneficial), protein-rich veggies such as Brussels sprouts, or some legumes likelentils are good choices, if eaten 3 to 4 hours before bed.AVOID: Don’t eat a late, heavy dinner at all costs. If you do have to exercisein the evening, a light kale salad with some avocado (remember, greens haveprotein, too) or a smoothie are two great choices.ALL DAY: Hydrate well before and after exercising to prevent dehydration. Drinkadequate liquids between meals so you aren’t tempted to drink a lot duringmeals, which would dilute your digestive enzymes. If you sweat a lot during yourworkouts, coconut water is a great natural sports drink.DO YOU NEED MORE PROTEIN TO BUILD MUSCLE?There’s a general belief that if you are an athlete or even someone who wants toincrease strength and muscle tone, you need to eat more protein. Is this true?And when exactly should you consume it?Research from the Journal of Sports Sciences shows that even elite athletes intraining need only about 0.59 to 0.82 grams of protein per pound (or 1.3 to 1.8kilograms) of body weight for optimum performance.37[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c16-nts37] So a male weighing 180 poundsin training would not need much more than 106 grams of protein a day (remembermore protein is not necessarily better; see this page[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_c03_r1.xhtml#page72]). This amount is easilyobtainable with a vegan protein shake, nuts or seeds, and a moderateprotein-containing meal, plus a variety of other whole foods during the day—andof course if you are not an elite athlete and weigh less you would need less. Ifyou are a woman and are not an elite athlete in training, 40 to 60 grams ofprotein a day should be plenty for your daily needs and keeping toned. This caneasily be acquired from a plant-based diet that includes some seeds, nuts,legumes, lots of veggies, especially green veggies, and protein shakes.PROTEIN INTAKE IN A DAY (IN GRAMS) WITH A PLANT-BASED DIETWith these two sample meal plans, you can see how easy it is to get the averagedaily protein requirements for women with a plant-based diet. For men, largerportion sizes or some extra nuts and seeds would also easily fulfill proteinrequirements.(Approximate/estimated grams of protein for foods listed; some variations mayoccur.)SAMPLE MEAL DAY #1MORNINGHot water with lemon: 0 grams16 ounces Glowing Green Smoothie (this page[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_c02_r1.xhtml#page27]): 6 gramsSteel-cut oatmeal (¼ cup dry) made with water: 4 gramsLUNCHLarge kale salad topped with ¼ cup sunflower seeds: 13 gramsCollard green wraps with nut pâté (see this page[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_c05_r1.xhtml#page95]): 11 gramsSNACKChia pudding (this page [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_c02_r1.xhtml#page28]): 5 gramsDINNER1 cup of cooked quinoa with 1 cup of broccoli; side of green salad: 11 grams1 ounce dark chocolate (at least 72% cacao): 1 gramDAILY TOTAL: 51 GRAMS OF PROTEINSAMPLE MEAL PLAN #2MORNINGHot water with lemon: 0 grams16 ounces Glowing Green Smoothie (this page[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_c02_r1.xhtml#page27]): 6 gramsApple: : 1 gramCoconut yogurt with ¼ cup gluten-free granola: 4 gramsLUNCHGluten-free veggie and quinoa wrap (wrap made from teff): 6 gramsSNACKPower Protein Smoothie (see kimberlysnyder. com [http://kimberlysnyder.com]): 24grams**Could be more or less, depending on protein powder usedDINNERLentil and Kale Soup (this page[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_app1_r1.xhtml#ind613a]): 9 gramsGrilled portobello mushrooms with large mixed green salad: 6 gramsAlmond milk-based hot chocolate: 2 gramsDAILY TOTAL: 58 GRAMS OF PROTEINA study from the Journal of Applied Physiology showed that it is best to consumeamino acids and carbs up to 3 hours post-workout to increase muscle synthesis.38[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c16-nts38] The othermacronutrient—fat—was not found to be part of this equation, perhaps because fatcan slow the uptake of the key nutrients. If you are engaging in endurancesports or workouts, some research has shown that consuming fat before exercisehelps improve results of conserving muscle glycogen levels, or fuel needed tosupply your muscles with energy, for these longer exercise periods,39[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c16-nts39] but it should be forms of fatthat are easy to digest, such as avocados and chia seeds, and consumed withenough time to allow for digestion (ideally at least 2 hours before workouts).So exactly how much do you need? Though it really depends on your size and thetype of workout you do, around 20 grams of protein should suffice post-workout(research has shown that for the average adult, muscle protein synthesissaturates at 20 grams of protein and increasing to 40 grams does not make adifference,40 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_nts_r1.xhtml#c16-nts40] which would beat least as much as you get in the Power Protein Smoothie or in a typical shakemade from almond milk and vegan protein powder).[images/Chop_9781101906026_epub3_001_r1.jpg][images/Chop_9781101906026_epub3_001_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"SHIFT 17:PRACTICE BREATHING AND YOGA EXERCISES FOR BEAUTYPRANAYAMA: SECRETS TO BREATHING FOR BEAUTYBreath is perhaps the subtlest form of movement that we engage in minute tominute, even while we sleep. Since we all breathe automatically, many of usdon’t pay attention to our breath and take it for granted. Yet one of thesecrets to youthfulness and energy is proper breathing. There are specificbreathing techniques that can be used to enhance the efficiency of your exerciseand movements and circulate oxygen and vitality-enhancing energy, or prana, moreefficiently around your body. This increases your Radical Beauty.Pranayama, which in a very simplified definition translates to “breathingexercises,” is really a deeper concept that has to do with consciouslycontrolling your prana. It is one of the most beneficial and effectivetechniques to help dissipate stress and balance your mind.Prana is the universal life energy that permeates the entire universe. Bybecoming aware of it and working with it deliberately through pranayamatechniques, you’ll be able to expand your energy beyond any perceivedlimitations. Your rejuvenation will expand, as will your magnetic energy andtrue beauty. A grounded, calm, yet tangibly magnetic energy is possible toattain through regularly practicing pranayama (and meditation, which we’ll talkabout in Pillar 6 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_p06_r1.xhtml]). These are among themost powerful practices available to us.Pranayama is considered alkalizing and cleansing since it promotes efficientelimination of toxins through the lungs. Pranayama practices work best in tandemwith a cleansing, alkaline diet (see Pillar 1[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_p01_r1.xhtml]). This helps open up the channels formore prana to enter. Deep inhales and exhales can move toxins through the lymph,acting as a pump for the lymphatic system. Tibetan yogis demonstrate the extremepower of breath and mind control. Using these dynamic practices, they cangenerate such intense heat that they are comfortable in cold temperatures andcan even melt the snow around them.Breathing techniques can certainly ramp up your beauty potential. Imagine if youbreathed improperly day after day, year after year. You wouldn’t get the fullpotential of nourishing oxygen to all of your cells, which can accelerate aging.Deeper, more efficient breathing that results in improved circulation equalsbetter distribution of oxygen and nutrients. This in turn will help create moreglowing, youthful skin and help you feel more naturally energized.The first step to pranayama is to become aware of your breath in the first placeand start to slow it down. When you slow down your breath, you tend to breathemore fully. This helps you become more efficient at ingesting oxygen andexpelling waste. You will also feel calmer and more balanced as you releasestress and absorb fewer of its toxic effects.STATES OF BREATHINGThere are three states of breathing we all naturally do throughout the day andnight.PURAKA: This is the state of inhalation, when your lungs are filled with air.Work to take deeper inhales, filling your upper and lower lungs to pull in themaximum amount of oxygen possible and allowing your stomach to expand like aballoon. Also take care to breathe in slowly, probably much more slowly than youare used to. You can even try counting to four as you inhale to consciously slowdown your breath.KUMBHATA: This is the state of retention. In normal, everyday breathing, thisequates to the very subtle pause between your inhales and exhales. Prana andoxygen from the lungs enter the bloodstream to be delivered to all of the cellsin your body as gases from the cells enter the lungs and prepare for expulsionout of the body.RECAKA: This is the state of exhalation of toxic substances from the body. It’simportant to exhale very deeply, perhaps even more deeply than you inhale, toensure that you fully expel wastes and by-products of the breath out of yourbody. Your belly should pull in slightly toward your spine.BASIC PRANAYAMA TECHNIQUES THAT PROMOTE BEAUTYThese practices are ideally performed at the specific times that are noted foreach technique. Practicing these in the open air is ideal. Otherwise, find apeaceful environment where you can sit with your spine straight. It might bemore comfortable for you to sit cross-legged on a firm pillow or to sit in achair with both feet firmly planted on the ground. But do avoid saggy couchesand cushions, which can cause you to inadvertently sink down, preventing optimalbreath flow and reducing these pranayama techniques’ strong benefits.Please check with your doctor before starting if you are new to these or anyother pranayama breath techniques, or if you are pregnant or have a medicalcondition.UJJAYIThis is the primary way of breathing while practicing yoga asanas, or poses, butthis is also a fantastic form of breath to use anytime you feel stressed. Ujjayihelps you bring the maximum amount of oxygen into your body; efficientlydistribute nutrients; avoid shallow, chest-based, and inefficient breathing; andgive more magnetic beauty energy and a glow to your skin and eyes.This form of breathing has been used for thousands of years in both Taoist andyogic traditions. It is often referred to as “the ocean breath” because itsounds like gentle ocean waves. Ujjayi is a deep, abdominal-based breath thatfills your lower belly first, then rises to fill the lower rib cage, then allthe way up into the upper lungs, chest, and throat.To begin, open your mouth wide and let out a vocal exhale. Now, inhale and closeyour mouth and try to exhale and make the same sound, which will produce a noisesomewhat akin to the ocean at the back of your throat. If you’re in public, youcan just focus on breathing deeply without tensing or raising your shoulders,allowing your entire belly to expand without making the audible sound. You’llstill benefit from this slow, deep breathing. In either case, inhale and exhalethrough your nose for roughly the same length of time. If you are a particularlyfast breather or have a hard time knowing how to slow down, try breathing in andout for a count of four. Practice this any time of the day and into the evening.BHASTRIKAThis is an especially beautifying pranayama technique because it is cleansingand raises the metabolism. Breathe in and out through your nose in a quickrhythm. This expels negativity. Think of a sniffing dog. The rhythm is even andfast. You can do one or a few rounds of 20 to 30 seconds each, working your wayup to 3 to 5 minutes a day. After finishing, you will feel euphoric andenergized in a profound way. Since this is an energizing practice, it’s best topractice this in the mornings and daytime rather than the evenings. It can takea while to get the rhythm down, but it’s worth the effort.NADI SHODHANAThis breathing technique creates balance in the body, which is a key componentof Radical Beauty. The term Nadi Shodhana literally means “clearing the channelsof circulation.” This technique is also referred to as “alternate nostrilbreathing” and is effective in helping you deeply relax your body and mind whilebalancing the energies between the left and right side of your body. Yogisbelieve the left is the ida, the cooling or lunar side of your body, while theright is the pingala, or the solar or warming, fiery energy in the body. Thesecontrasting but complementary sides need to be balanced. If you have too muchfire you can burn out or get overanxious or overheated, which ancient Indianphilosophy warns might speed the aging process. If you are too cool and don’thave enough fire, you can become lethargic and depressed.Try practicing Nadi Shodhana in the evenings after work and before bed or beforemeditating to balance your fire and cooling elements; release anxiety,depression, or stress; and create a deep sense of equilibrium and balance. Startby taking a big exhale and clearing the breath completely out of both nostrils.Then take your index and middle fingers (as if you were going to make a “peacesign”), and curl them into your palm or place them on the bridge of your nose.Now hold your right thumb over your right nostril and inhale deeply through yourleft nostril. At the top of your inhalation, close off your left (ida, or lunar,cooling) nostril with your ring and pinky fingers and exhale fully through yourright nostril. After a full exhalation, inhale through the right (pingala, orsolar, warming) nostril, closing it off with your right thumb at the top of yourinhalation. Repeat this over and over, without force, just watching your breathand feeling the power of this practice to balance your entire, beautiful being.KAPALABHATIThis is also a purifying beauty breath that is sometimes referred to as “skullshining breath.” It can help your entire being as well as your complexionradiate with the glow of cleanliness and peace. This toning pranayama techniquecleanses your respiratory system and encourages the release of toxins. It ismade up of short, powerful exhales and passive inhales.To practice Kapalabhati, sit in a comfortable position with a straight spine.Rest your hands on your belly so you can tune in to the sharp exhalations. Ifyou prefer, rest them on your knees with your palms facing down. Bring yourattention to your lower abdomen and inhale through both nostrils deeply.Contract your lower belly or use your hands to gently press on this area,forcing out the breath in a short burst. This should feel strong and powerful.As you quickly release the contraction, your inhalation should be automatic andpassive. Your focus should be on exhaling.Begin slowly, aiming for 65 to 70 contractions per minute. Gradually pick up thepace for 95 to 105 exhalation/inhalation cycles per minute. Always go at yourown pace and never force yourself. Stop if you feel at all light-headed ordizzy. After one minute of the exercise, inhale deeply through the nostrils andthen exhale slowly through your mouth. Depending on your experience level, youcan work up to doing multiple repetitions. This is a great exercise to do in themorning to warm up for your morning yoga practice or meditation. As thispractice is energizing, it is not recommended for the late evening.YOGA FOR DETOXIFICATION AND BEAUTYOf all the types of movement out there, yoga is one of the best for promotingRadical Beauty. The asana, or pose part of yoga, incorporates twisted andcircular movements of different muscle groups. This includes flexing your spinein all directions. There are many advantages to this over linear movements witha limited range of motion.YOGA GEARTo start practicing yoga, you’ll want to invest in a decent yoga mat that willprevent you from skidding and sliding during your asanas and is thick enough toprovide padding for your knees and hips during various poses. There are a lot ofgreat eco-friendly mats available. You may also want to invest in two yogablocks to help modify poses, especially as a beginner. These are fairlyinexpensive but enormously helpful in making sure you don’t compromise theintegrity of the pose as you naturally increase your flexibility. For someposes, such as Parsvottonasana, or Pyramid pose (see this page[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_c17_r1.xhtml#ind881a]), you can use one block oneither side of your leg to help you modify the pose. Other gear, such as yogabelts and blankets, are not fully necessary, especially as a beginner. You canthink about investing in them later if you find a need. For now, a pillow or anysturdy blanket you already have at home can be used to help elevate hips forseated poses and, while practicing pranayama, to increase your comfort and helpalign your spine.Yoga is cleansing in many different ways. It allows you to physically stimulateyour abdominal organs, including your liver, kidneys, and digestive organs. Thismakes yoga incredibly beneficial for digestion, which you now know is key tobeauty and health. Yoga also stimulates your endocrine glands, including thethyroid gland, which controls your metabolism. It also helps cleanse your liver,your main detoxifying organ. Far beyond simply burning calories or working yourlimbs and core, when practiced properly yoga can be a very powerful tool inhelping to keep your body limber, strong, youthful, and beautifully healthy withan all-around glow and beautiful, healthy skin.Yoga asanas are the ideal physical movements to couple with the other shifts inthis book to physically support a clean, beautiful body and mind. The deeperbenefits of yoga extend to settling and balancing your mind, preparing you formeditation, and aiding in the meditation practice itself, which we will discussin Pillar 6 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_p06_r1.xhtml]. For now, let’s focus on thephysical, movement-based aspects of yoga so you can begin reaping its manybeauty benefits.TOP RADICAL BEAUTY POSES FOR BEAUTY AND DETOXIFICATIONBelow are among the most effective and beneficial poses to incorporate into yourlifestyle. You can try a few of these poses that you feel the most connected to,or try all of them and see which ones your body and mind respond to. You canwork them into your daily routine right after rising in the morning, as many ofthese can easily be practiced in the space next to your bed or even perhaps inbed if you have a firm mattress. Others, such as Paschimottanasana, which is anervous-system-soothing seated forward bend, are excellent to incorporate intoyour evening routine for added digestive and anxiety-quelling benefits as youget ready for some all-important beauty rest.If you are new to yoga, are pregnant, or have a medical condition, please talkto your doctor before beginning.TADASANA (MOUNTAIN POSE)[images/Chop_9781101906026_epub3_002_r1.jpg][images/Chop_9781101906026_epub3_002_r1.jpg]BENEFITS: This pose can bring profound awareness into a seemingly simple stance.It strengthens the legs, firms your abdomen and glutes, and improves yourposture.DESCRIPTION: Stand straight with the insides of your big toes together.

By stimulating all your organs, especially yourvitality-enhancing kidneys as well as your colon and digestive tract,Mārjāryasana boosts your overall circulation and stimulates your entire spine,relieving stress and revitalizing your energy.DESCRIPTION: Start by kneeling on your hands and knees, keeping your handsunderneath your shoulders and your knees underneath your hips. Exhale deeplythrough your mouth and contract your abdominal muscles up toward your spine,rounding your spine to the ceiling as you tuck your tailbone under and bringyour chin toward your chest. This arch is known as “cat” since it resembles acat arching its back. Inhale and relax your belly so it drifts toward the groundfor the “cow” portion (resembling the bulge of a cow’s pronounced udder),lifting your head so you are facing forward, opening your back into a slightbackbend, and sliding your shoulder blades down your back. Continue to flow yourspine through several rounds of these arching motions, feeling the movement ofeach vertebra.BEST TIME TO PRACTICE: Try practicing a few rounds of this right on your bedroomfloor upon waking (or near your kitchen while heating up the water to make yourhot water with lemon!) to get energized for the entire day ahead.OTHER TIPS: Be sure to practice this on a yoga mat or a carpet to provide somepadding for your tender knee joints.PARSVOTTONASANA (PYRAMID POSE)[images/Chop_9781101906026_epub3_005_r1.jpg][images/Chop_9781101906026_epub3_005_r1.jpg]BENEFITS: This pose stimulates and tones your abdominal organs and supportsdigestion. It also improves your posture and balance.DESCRIPTION: Start in a wide stance with your right leg forward and pointingstraight ahead and your left leg behind and pointed at a 45-degree angle. Squareyour hips so both are pointing straight forward. On an exhale, fold forward fromthe hips until your torso is parallel with the floor or, if comfortable, fold inmore deeply toward your right leg, placing your fingertips on the floor or ontwo blocks on either side of your right leg. Breathe deeply for five to tenbreaths. Repeat on the other side.BEST TIME TO PRACTICE: Any time of the day.OTHER TIPS: This and other forward-bend poses are great to call upon when youfeel stressed or overwhelmed.UTKATASANA (CHAIR POSE)[images/Chop_9781101906026_epub3_006_r1.jpg][images/Chop_9781101906026_epub3_006_r1.jpg]BENEFITS: Not only does this stimulate your abdominal organs and promotecleansing but it is also a powerful pose to tone your thighs and entire legs.DESCRIPTION: Begin in Tadasana (Mountain pose), with your feet touching and yourspine erect. Move back and down as if you are going to sit down in a chair; thismight only be a few inches back to start if you are a beginner. Then lift yourarms in front of you at around ear level with your palms facing each other, yourshoulder blades moving down your back, and your chest broad while you root backstrongly into your heels. Keep drawing in your abdominal muscles to support yourback as you “sit” back. Breathe deeply.BEST TIME TO PRACTICE: Any time of the day.OTHER TIPS: For an added bonus, add a round or two of Kapalabhati breath (thispage [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_c17_r1.xhtml#page244]) while in Chair pose.UTTHITA TRIKONASANA (EXTENDED TRIANGLE POSE)[images/Chop_9781101906026_epub3_007_r1.jpg][images/Chop_9781101906026_epub3_007_r1.jpg]BENEFITS: This excellent pose stimulates digestion and elimination whileproviding a wonderful stretch all along your leg muscles, back, chest,shoulders, and oblique muscles.DESCRIPTION: Begin in Tadasana (Mountain pose).

But spirit and soul are realexperiences, and the love of someone who holds you up as a perfect partner inlife is not just a dream. Pillar 6 [Chop_9781101906026_epub3_p06_r1.xhtml] takesRadical Beauty this final step, into the light of spirit, where your dailyexperience will validate your highest personal values. Your highest potentialfor beauty will be unfulfilled without spiritual beauty.Pause for a moment and ask yourself what “living in the light” means to youpersonally. For one person it might be like waking up to greet the dawn—there isa sense of joyful freshness and renewal. Another person would immediatelyimagine the gleam of love in a child’s eyes—the light is love. No matter how youdefine it, the light is a source of beauty from within.Because beauty is natural, so is spiritual beauty. There is no reason to feelthat spiritual beauty must be something rare. We were born to live in the light.There’s a beautiful expression of this truth in the Indian spiritual tradition,which says the following: To know who you really are, imagine two birds sittingin a tree. One bird eats the fruit of the tree while its mate looks onlovingly—this is your true self, where inner and outer beauty are bonded bylove.The true self is another element of Radical Beauty, one that transcendsappearances and calls out to us from some place deeply personal and universal atthe same time. While you go through your daily life—working, loving, pursuingall the things you desire—there is a hidden, silent part of you that doesn’tengage in action. It merely looks on. This silent aspect of the self lives inthe light. From it radiates spiritual beauty.HOW TO FIND YOUR PERSONAL PATH TO SPIRITUAL BEAUTYFinding your spiritual beauty isn’t a difficult task like climbing a mountain.Let’s say that you’ve had a hard day at work and are driving home in slowtraffic. There’s nothing delightful about your situation. You are trapped by thedaily grind. Suddenly a rain shower passes overhead, and a few minutes later agorgeous double rainbow appears in the sky. What happens to you inside? Almosteveryone would say that they feel a moment of delight, and while it lasts, thismoment is all-embracing. You don’t want to be distracted because the spell ofbeauty has captivated you.In Radical Beauty, we want you to be just as captivated by your own self, thetrue self that is made of light. You have glimpsed it thousands of times inmoments when any of the following experiences happened to you.> You felt happy and peaceful inside.> > You felt inspired by the sight of something beautiful.> > You felt safe and protected.> > Your mind became quiet and settled.> > You felt loved and lovable.> > You felt connected to a higher power, whether you labeled it as God or not.> > You felt refreshed and renewed.> > You longed to know the truth about life.> > You realized that you belong.These aren’t rare experiences—everyone has had them. They make us feel, even foran instant, that life is beautiful. Our true self was peeking through. As partof Radical Beauty, we want these glimpses to become lasting and permanent. Thisis actually the most natural way to live. On a cloudy day, you don’t think,“Gray is how it should always be. A sunny day is the exception.” Everyone takesfor granted, even in the gloomiest climates, that the sun represents a permanentforce while clouds come and go. It’s the same with spirit. No matter how cloudedover it becomes—due to negative emotions, distractions, old wounds, or painfulconditioning—the true self is steady and ever-present.There are many reasons why we can’t see our own inner beauty, but the mostimportant is that we were never taught how. A rainbow catches your attentionautomatically, not just because it looks beautiful but because we were alltrained from childhood to see with the eyes of the body. Seeing with the eyes ofthe soul is just as easy and natural—once you have learned how.There’s nothing new here. For thousands of years people have wanted three thingsvery deeply: love, healing, and awakening. In the world’s wisdom traditions, arich storehouse of knowledge has accumulated about the path that leads to thesethings. The most valuable knowledge can be stated in a few sentences:> The path must be inspiring.> > It must fit with your own personality and tendencies.> > It should be without stress and strain.The challenge is to turn these three principles into a practical plan. Here iswhere the traditions of wisdom lay down three main approaches. These areblueprints or strategy plans, we might say, that have proven to work time andtime again. As we describe them, stop and consider which approach suits youpersonally.• The path of love and devotion: On this path the incentive is joy. Seeing thebeauty of the world, you seek more of it, and the more you find, the moreblissful you feel. Moments of love start to deepen. You are inspired tocontemplate a creation permeated by love. This path is very private, because ittakes place entirely in the heart. Further along the path you sense that lovecan be unconditional, and you find yourself offering devotion to the source ofsuch pure love.> Qualities of this path: Bliss, joy, love of beauty, desire to give and receive> love, hunger for the divine, a sense of heartfelt warmth> > The goal: To live in the light of divine grace• The path of action and service: On this path the incentive is spiritualgrowth. Having glimpsed what is best in yourself, you want to act from your bestself always. There is a strong desire to fulfill your inner potential. This isachieved by expanding your awareness, because the more expanded you feel, themore complete you are. This path is dynamic and takes place in the hustle andbustle of the real world. Further along, the most fulfilling action is no longerselfish. You feel more fulfilled by service to others. The more you give ofyourself, the more you receive back. This motivates you to surrender allattachment, because you realize that what you desired all along was purefreedom.> Qualities of this path: Evolution, growth, fulfilled potential, giving,> serving, longing for freedom, renewal, sense of expansion, becoming unburdened> and free while still acting in the world> > The goal: Liberation• The path of knowledge and truth: On this path the incentive is a thirst forunderstanding. You have glimpsed the reality that peeks through the veil ofillusion. The physical world isn’t enough to satisfy your need to know thetruth. You delve into scriptures, poetry, and other writing that speaks to youabout a deeper reality. This path is mental. Every day is about seeking a newlevel of understanding. Wisdom inspires you. Further along the path, the mindrealizes that wisdom can’t be found in books or by any set system of thought.The ultimate understanding is based on silent awareness, which simply knows. Byrelying on the silent mind rather than all the fleeting thoughts that fill themind, you discover that reality is unbounded, pure consciousness. With thisunderstanding, all seeking ceases.> Qualities of this path: Seeking, being true to yourself, thirst for knowledge,> self-reliance, the pull of wisdom, spiritual teachings, inspiration from what> the mind discovers> > The goal: Unbounded awarenessThe three pathways are equal and have been tested for centuries, wherever peoplehave wanted to find more from life than what is presented on the surface. Onceyou find the path that matches you personally, it becomes the easiest and mostnatural one for you to follow. Each path implies a new way of life, but it isimportant to note that if this way of life imposes stress and strain, you willsooner or later lapse back into your old way of life.SETTING THE STAGEDo you see yourself taking one of the three paths? Each one awakens RadicalBeauty at the deepest level, yet you must be comfortable finding the way thatsuits you best. For some people the choice is very clear. For others, there’s adegree of uncertainty. They can see a bit of themselves in all three paths, theway of love, the way of action, and the way of knowledge. To help you choose,take a closer look at how your life is being lived today. Even before we thinkabout getting on the path, the stage has been set for taking the first step.A way of life that’s naturally compatible with love and devotion is drawn tocommunity and togetherness. It involves taking care of others. Family comesfirst. A loving household is considered the ideal. Warmth and heartfelt emotionscome naturally. There is usually an attraction to church or temple. Feelings ofreverence come naturally. You seek communion with nature, the people you love,and all of humanity. You believe in the power of prayer, and you haveexperienced moments of grace. Your personality is likely to be shy andself-effacing, but this isn’t always true. At your best you feel gratitude anddevotion for the gifts that fill your life.A way of life that’s naturally compatible with personal growth is drawn to newpossibilities. This is more than the ordinary life of action, which is dominatedby external demands and duties. The spark instead comes from inside, throughconstant, often restless, seeking. Discovery and curiosity occupy your mind. Youlike to challenge yourself to find out what you are capable of. Spiritually youare attracted to groups that offer a better way of life and the fulfillment ofhidden potential. You have a strong sense of purpose, grounded on a secure senseof self. You measure your self-worth not by visible rewards like money andpossessions but by how expanded you are becoming inside. You are impatient withthe demands of your ego, which thinks only of itself and the next pleasure itcan experience. Your seeking looks beyond the ego to higher states ofconsciousness. Being the best you can be appeals to you, and this turns into astrong motivation spiritually. Although others may see you only in worldlyterms, you can surprise them by being selfless, generous, and willing to serveothers.A way of life that’s naturally compatible with understanding is drawn to thetruth. There is a constant need to know more. A high value is placed on livingyour own truth, which you associate with integrity and honesty. You trust yourmind to guide you forward. You have no time for secondhand opinions andconventional wisdom. You look up to people who have insight and can impart it toothers. Your streak of skepticism keeps you from following anyone who hasn’tearned your respect for telling the truth. In your mind, you distinguish betweenappearances and reality. There are moments when reality seems quite mysteriousto you. The material world doesn’t tell the whole story. You want to go beyond,or transcend. The way you do this is primarily by going deeper into yourpersonal understanding and self-awareness. At your best, you feel secure enoughto open new doors that take you into the unknown.THE AWAKENING PROCESS: FINDING YOUR BEAUTY IN THE LIGHTA beautiful transformation begins to take place when you see that you belong inthe light. When people successfully find a way to live in the light, theirexperiences on the path turn out to be very similar, because there are certainstages that apply to almost everyone.> Stage 1: First Signs of Awakening> > Stage 2: Opening the Door> > Stage 3: Dedication to the Path> > Stage 4: Resting into Existence> > Stage 5: The True Self Becomes the Only SelfRadical Beauty is universal. These are stages of awakening experienced forthousands of years in every culture. Even though social roles have changeddramatically and society has become much more secular, you will discover thatyour personal journey will repeat the same soul journey that was undertaken atthe time of the Buddha, Jesus, Saint Teresa, and anyone alive today who lives inthe light. Let’s look more closely at how the five stages unfold."},{"pageContent":"STAGE 1: FIRST SIGNS OF AWAKENINGBeing beautiful means seeing yourself that way, and for this, you must be wideawake. Because the light of awareness exists in everyone, it’s hard to imagine alife that doesn’t contain moments of awakening. But many other things happenduring a typical day, and it’s quite common not to notice the first signs. Let’ssay that you wake up one day and there’s a sense of lightness and ease as youbegin your day. The lightness stays with you and even increases instead offading. You may think to yourself, “I’m having a good day.” People smile at youmore than usual; the things you need to accomplish are done more easily—it’s asif all the gears are lubricated, with minimal friction. You go to bed feeling asense of ease and fulfillment, yet when you wake up the next morning, everythinghas gone back to normal. You face a day of duties and demands that feels likeevery other day. The memory of your very good day quickly vanishes.Yet what you actually experienced that day was a sign of awakening, giving you aclue to the inner beauty you could be radiating all the time. We said that whenyou are struck by something beautiful outside yourself, you are actuallycommunicating with your own inner beauty. Likewise, when your existence feelslighter and easier, that’s your inner beauty also being reflected. You areglimpsing the truth of who you really are, because beauty and truth cannot beseparated. They are qualities of pure consciousness, pure being.At this early stage, terms like pure consciousness and pure being hardly seemrelevant, because they are too foreign to your daily experience. Even so,everyone’s life contains glimpses of beauty, love, joy, and fulfillment thatregister on the emotional level. The problem is that we need to do more on themental level.We need to recognize that a sign of awakening has appeared.We need to give significance to this experience.We need to value and pursue it.People get stuck in everyday existence and accept as normal a life where there’sno expectation of waking up. Glimpses of the light, however striking, don’tpropel them into a new kind of normal, which is higher and better. But if youmentally notice what’s happening to you and give it significance, instead ofsaying to yourself, “I’m having a good day,” you’ll say, “I’m being touched bythe light.” This simple shift is enough to reframe your whole experience, makingit a clue to higher consciousness.Please glance back at the list on this page[Chop_9781101906026_epub3_p06_r1.xhtml#page258] that outlined the most commonsigns of awakening—each is a moment in the light. Keep noticing such moments andpause to let them sink in. Turn inward and relish what is happening instead ofsimply letting it pass. Let every image of beauty you see—from those you love,from children at play, from glorious nature—really sink in. Savor the moment asa precious gift. You are venturing into the experience of communing with yourtrue self. The more you do this, the more you will naturally want to pursuethese beautiful experiences. You are beginning to wake up to your spiritualbeauty."},{"pageContent":"STAGE 2: OPENING THE DOOROnce you taste beauty, you want more. At a certain point, once you notice andvalue the signs of awakening, you feel the desire to explore what’s happening toyou. There’s a sense of curiosity about what your life might be like if itchanged in unexpected ways. You might also feel restless and dissatisfied withhow things are going presently. At this stage people make a conscious decisionto let in the light. A major decision involves being kinder and morecompassionate to yourself. Let’s look into this shift, which brings in much morelight the more you experience it.When we are kind to other people, we let them know that they are good andlovable just as they are. Self-compassion is saying the same thing to yourself.Pause for a moment here. Do you love yourself just as you are? The way thatpeople answer this question reveals a great deal about themselves, because quiteoften we are waiting for the day that someone else will treat us as good andlovable, without criticism or reservation.If you are fortunate, this has already happened to you. But the world’s wisdomtraditions teach that the love you receive from outside is a reflection of thelove you have inside. The most perfect love comes from your true self, whichalways sees you in the light. When you open the door to the light, you areasking to experience a new relationship inside yourself. Right at this moment,you are likely to be experiencing love and light only in bursts, as if the doorwas being opened and then quickly closed—passing moments when you can relate toyourself as worthy of love. At other times this isn’t your experience. Negativereflections from the outside keep you from seeing your inner beauty.It would be ideal if all of us were perfectly loved from the time we were smallchildren. But the way you feel about yourself is almost always the result ofmixed messages that you have heard all your life. When you needed love,kindness, and compassion, you learned that these would be given only undercertain conditions. We’ve all received messages like the following:> I love you as long as you love me.> > I love you as long as you are being good.> > I love you only as much as you deserve.> > I love you, but don’t ask for too much or you’ll be spoiled.You may remember such messages as you were growing up or perhaps in your presentrelationships today. They place conditions on the love you experience, and theseconditions come to feel normal. But if love is always limited, so is howbeautiful you feel. The old game of comparison stays alive because we feel thereis not enough love and beauty to go around, and somehow other people get morethan their fair share compared with us.Can you change your inner image of how much you are loved? You will never feelsecure in your beauty until it is merged with love. The path to unconditionallove only asks for you to open the door. No one else can open it for you; thereis no source of unconditional love outside yourself. Right this minute you havethe ability to find the place inside you where unconditional love exists. Toshow you how easy this is, try the following simple exercise:Sit comfortably by yourself in a quiet place. Now say to yourself, “I am________,” using your name to fill in the blank, for example, “I am SharonThompson.” Wait a few seconds and let this thought settle. Now shorten it: “I amSharon.” Sit for a moment to let this thought settle. Then shorten the thoughtto “I am,” then to “I,” and then sit in silence. Most people experience thissequence of thoughts as a natural way to find the inner silence insidethemselves. It’s a pleasant experience, which may last only briefly or severalminutes—that part doesn’t matter. What’s important is to see that your identitycan shift from “I am X” to simply “I am” and then silence.You don’t have to use your name in this exercise. Any X will work, becausewhenever you say to yourself “I am angry” or “I’m bored” or “I’m cookingdinner,” you are placing a condition on who you are. These conditions come andgo all the time. They rise and fall, while your true self remains constant.Sadly, we’ve developed the habit of living with labels and thinking they tell uswho we are. “I am X, thirty-six years old of mixed race, religiouslyunaffiliated, a lawyer, with a husband and two children.”In the game of labeling, we’d all like to pin the label “beautiful” onourselves. But once you do, insecurity sets in. The label could always wear outor fall off. All labels are temporary. Therefore, be very clear that beautyisn’t a label—it’s a state of being.All of these labels that we identify with serve as distractions from who wereally are: children of the light. When you stop being distracted by thinking “Iam X,” you easily find the path to simply being yourself. There’s no hugespiritual secret beyond this. The spiritual path is all about clearing awaylabels, images, old memories, and outworn conditioning that prevent you from thesimple experience of your true place in the light.You can’t turn conditional love into unconditional love any more than you canturn muddy water to pure, clean water. Instead, you must go to the place insidewhere you can simply be yourself and, without judgment or comparison, where youfeel beautiful, loved, and lovable. Getting to this place isn’t difficult. Youjust did it through a simple exercise. So why didn’t you suddenly experiencebliss, joy, and ecstasy, which are supposed to be there? Because it takesrepeated experience to become accustomed to “I am” in place of “I am all thelabels that apply to me.” The quality of bliss, joy, and ecstasy is already partof you—in Indian the term for this state is Ananda. Ananda isn’t held out as afaraway ideal that is only reached by a few gifted people after years of faithand devotion. Ananda is a quality of consciousness itself, meaning that youexperience it when you experience the silence of your own mind.This is where self-compassion comes in. Knowing that you can experienceunconditional love, bliss, and joy by going to the place where these things arenatural means you don’t have to work on your limited, conditioned self. Youdon’t have to criticize it to find it lacking in any way. Rather, you can treatyour conditioned self as an ally on your inner journey. After all, this is theself that has given you glimpses of love, bliss, and joy all your life. You facea simple choice. You can look at your imperfect, conditioned self and say, “Youcaused all my problems. Thanks to you, I have been wounded and suffered. Youdon’t live up to my ideals. I’m frustrated and exasperated by you.”This is a very common attitude. You may not accuse and reject your limited selfdirectly, but every time you think you aren’t good enough, beautiful enough,thin enough, and so on, you are in fact rejecting yourself.The other side of the coin is to look at your limited self and say, “Thank youfor always being here. Because of you I have experienced the light. I have knownlove and beauty. Join with me now, and trust in me. We are going to find ourtrue home in the light.” That’s how self-compassion begins, by changing blameand judgment to acceptance and optimism.Having adopted this new attitude toward yourself, you want to sustain it. Thereare various ways to practice self-compassion every day, as follows.To be kind to yourself, DO> Smile at your reflection in the mirror.> > Let others compliment you.> > Bask in other people’s approval when it comes your way.> > Accept and be nonjudgmental with your personal appearance and body.> > Value who you are and stand up for yourself.> > Get to know yourself like a friend.> > Be easy about your personal quirks.> > Be as natural as possible, not worrying if you are pleasing or displeasing> others.> > Speak your truth when you know you should.The Do list is centered on relating to yourself with a nonjudgmental attitude.There is also a Don’t list, which is about removing self-judgments, because inthe end, all lack of self-love is rooted in judging yourself.To stop self-judgment, DON’T> Brush away compliments.> > Reject other people’s appreciation.> > Belittle yourself, even with self-deprecating humor.> > Dwell on your faults as a topic of conversation.> > Rationalize away the times when someone else hurts you.> > Accept indifference from people who supposedly love you.> > Associate with others who have low self-esteem and expect you to be the same> way.> > Silently swallow bad treatment when you know you should speak up.The reflections of how you feel about yourself exist all around you. Evennegative reflections are incredibly useful if you take them as guides forchange. Are there people in your life who take you for granted when theyshouldn’t? Rather than trying to change them, see this as a reflection of howmuch you value yourself—in this case, not enough. You might want to write outthe following checklist, and over the next week check off each time something onthe list happens to you. The list contains typical reflections in everyone’slife, both positive and negative.Positive Reflections___ Someone appreciated me.___ I liked the person I saw in the mirror.___ I received a sincere compliment.___ I felt proud of something I did for myself.___ I felt as if I belonged.___ Someone expressed love for me in a meaningful way.___ I felt lovable.___ I felt well loved.___ The beauty of the life I’m living really hit me.___ I felt like a unique person; there’s no one in the world quite like me.Negative Reflections___ Someone criticized me to my face.___ I frowned at myself in the mirror.___ I felt guilty or embarrassed by something I remembered from long ago.___ I put myself down while talking to someone else.___ I felt unwanted, an outsider.___ I received what felt like an empty word or gesture of love.___ I felt unlovable.___ I sat through someone else’s litany of complaints.___ Something pointless about my life really hit me.___ I felt bored by my existence and the people I keep seeing every day.Some people might resist filling out these two lists because they’re afraid ofwhat they’ll find. Or they might think that noticing negative reflections is asign of low self-esteem. It’s not. You are taking a major step towardself-compassion by looking around and being truthful with yourself. Being kindto yourself requires a decision to embrace change. Self-judgment keeps us fromloving who we are right this moment. Every step you take to walk away fromnegative reflections is a step in the direction of unconditional love.Radical Beauty asks you to summon your inner courage. For some people, openingthe door is harder than it is for others. They keep feeling the tug of anxietyor threat, and their mind resists the prospect of change. The following thoughtsare typical when you are in a resisting frame of mind:> I’m alright where I am. Why rock the boat?> > If I change, my friends and family won’t accept me anymore.> > Perhaps my experiences aren’t even real—I’m just fooling myself.> > I’m not the kind of person who ever changes—it’s just wishful thinking.> > I don’t want to stick out from the crowd. Society will look on me as abnormal.This kind of resistance crops up in everyone, because we all have a social self.Your social self is where judgments come from, and if you don’t see yourself asbeautiful, it’s the reason why. This self has learned, often through painfultrial and error, how to get along. Fitting in isn’t easy, and in every lifethere are guardians of the rules who will be quick to notice anyone who dares tobreak them. We are referring to rules of behavior, which have been ingrained ineveryone since early childhood. So how do you get past the warning voices inyour head? You can’t open the door to your true self until this happens.Reassuring yourself that everything will be okay isn’t an effective tactic. Yoursocial self has deep roots; it is used to guiding you through every dailyencounter, constantly monitoring whether your behavior is safe and acceptable.(For the moment we are leaving aside the small band of misfits, artists, rebels,sages, and saints whose behavior transgresses social norms. Such people oftenlead extraordinary lives, but they also tend to pay extraordinarily high prices,too.)You need to recognize that you have been influenced by years of conditioning;therefore, to escape this conditioning, it’s necessary to substitute new,positive beliefs for the warnings that try to keep you from opening the door.Here are some examples:Warning: I’m alright where I am. Why rock the boat?New thought: I can keep what’s good in my life. The changes I want will only addto them.Warning: If I change, my friends and family won’t accept me anymore.New thought: If I bring more light into my life, at the same time I will bebringing it to my family and friends. They will welcome the change.Warning: Perhaps my experiences aren’t even real—I’m just fooling myself.New thought: I can’t deny that my experiences make me feel good. That’s realenough to make me trust them.Warning: I’m not the kind of person who ever changes—it’s just wishful thinking.New thought: There’s a part of me that can’t wait to break out into a new way oflife. I should give it a chance. The only reason I need is that this is what Iwant.Warning: I don’t want to stick out from the crowd. Society will look on me asabnormal.New thought No one else needs to know about what’s going on inside me. This issomething just for me, something I entirely own.These new thoughts aren’t just reassurances. They put you in contact with yourtrue self, which is what opening the door actually means. Radical Beauty isabout seeing yourself in the light, which is where all positive thoughtsoriginate. Spirit has never forgotten how beautiful you are and always havebeen."},{"pageContent":"STAGE 3: DEDICATION TO THE PATHNow that you have opened the door, love and beauty call out. You find them inthe most unexpected places. At this point, it’s only natural to desire acomplete shift in your life, nothing less than transformation. As Radical Beautyunfolds, we promise that transformation is possible, simply because the mostnatural way to live is from the level of the true self. It puts beauty, grace,and love together in one place as a normal way of life. The path lies beforeyou. So what comes next? You dedicate yourself to reaching your goal. This is adedication that you renew every day. Yet as we all know, it’s easy for the dayto run away with us, because our time is already dedicated to work, family,errands, and unexpected duties and demands that eat up the clock.Fortunately, you don’t have to set aside your daily life to be spirituallydedicated. We do recommend one important change, which is to meditate twice aday for 10 to 15 minutes (or longer). You probably have an opinion aboutmeditation already. It’s become so popular that few people still regard thepractice as something exotic and alien. The image that now comes to mind is of ayoung, vibrant woman sitting in lotus position in yoga class, not awhite-bearded Indian guru in a cave.Society has promoted meditation as a healthy habit, and in fact there is amountain of evidence telling us that meditation is good for the entire body,particularly by lowering the risk of heart disease and counteracting thedamaging effects of stress. If you’ve had a hard day and want to unwind with apeaceful round of meditation, we encourage you to go for it. But when it comesto transformation and achieving your highest potential for spiritual beauty,meditation is more than any of these things.Even though brief, your meditation time brings you into the silent core ofyourself; this is where you will meet the truth of your own beauty and where thedoor to unconditional love opens.How to Meditate: Technique 1Here’s a simple meditation based on the breath that you can do anywhere. It’sbest to pick a quiet, lowly lit spot where you can be alone. Sit for a momentwith your eyes closed in order to become settled. Now place your attention onyour nose; sense the gentle flow of air as it goes in and out.Don’t try to alter your breathing or to maintain a rhythm—simply be aware ofyour normal breathing. If your attention wanders, gently and easily bring itback to your breath. Don’t mind if you feel drowsy or even doze off. These aresigns that your body needs to rest and discharge stresses.Continue for 10 to 15 minutes, then sit quietly for a moment before you openyour eyes and return to your regular activity. Don’t leap out of your chair orskip this moment to return to normal awareness. Letting your mind remain in themeditative state is desirable and very worth cultivating as you continue yourpractice over the coming weeks and months.How to Meditate: Technique 2A second type of meditation uses a mantra, a word selected for its vibrationalquality in settling the mind. Mantras go back thousands of years, and there’ssome striking research to indicate that they lead to a deeper state ofmeditation. A simple mantra suitable for everyone is So Hum. You can meditatewith it in the following way.As with your breath meditation, try to pick a quiet, lowly lit spot where youcan be alone. Sit for a moment with your eyes closed in order to become settled.Now quietly think the mantra: So Hum. Think these syllables as easily as anyother thought. Repeat the mantra a second time, then a third: So Hum, So Hum.Repeat the mantra for 10 to 15 minutes, but don’t try to set up a regularrhythm. This style of meditation isn’t about mentally chanting your mantra witha regular beat. Instead, you think So Hum when it’s natural and easy to do so.If your attention wanders, easily come back to your mantra. Don’t mind if youget drowsy or doze off. Don’t mind if you forget to say the mantra for whatseems like a long time.The object is to allow the vibration of So Hum to settle your awareness asnaturally as possible. You don’t need to manipulate it or control it in any way.After 10 to 15 minutes, sit quietly for a moment before returning to your dailyactivity. Easing back into activity helps to maintain the meditative state.Meditation clears the path and makes it much easier to greet renewal and change.Your awareness becomes brighter and more alert; mental and emotional obstaclesare dissolved. Therefore, nothing is more effective than adopting a regularmeditation program. At the same time, there’s another dimension to consider. Asyou clear the path, certain potentials begin to wake up inside. You glimpse thatthere could be more love, beauty, creativity, and fulfillment in your life. Manypeople have gotten to this stage in their seeking. But then they run into aproblem staying in that place where meditation has taken them.Here’s a good place to lay a common fear to rest. Some people fear that if theystart to meditate, they will stir up hidden thoughts, feelings, and memoriesthey’d rather not face. By going deeper into your mind, aren’t you stirring upthe demons that everyone has? In reality, meditation is value neutral. Itdoesn’t conform to labels like “good” and “bad,” “positive” and “negative.” Allthat happens is that you reach a deeper level of awareness. Nothing will leapout of the dark. The main experience is the release of stress, accompanied bylayers of fatigue falling away. Stress can bring up images of why you feelstressed in the first place. But all you have to do when this happens is to openyour eyes and take a deep breath. Being mental images, negative thoughts andimages pass away. If you seriously want to delve into the hidden compartments ofyour mind—some people do, being spiritually adventurous—that’s a consciouschoice. If you would rather have your meditations be easy and light, that isalso a choice. The mind delivers what is asked of it.Finding your inner beauty is meant to be lasting, and it will be. The main thingthat causes the deep experience of meditation to fade away is stress. When yousit alone to meditate, the outside world has been left behind for a few minutes,yet once you go back into it, the demands of the outside world can’t be escaped.Those demands can create a constant stream of stress, as we all well know. Thedestructive effects of stress have been well studied for almost fifty years.When someone is put into a stressful situation, the brain and body respond withstress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline. These are very effective naturaltools that jump-start the body into fight-or-flight mode.The Damaging Effects of Chronic StressRadical Beauty involves getting back into balance and restoring the naturalstate of mind and body. Beauty is a healed state. Stress is the enemy ofhealing; we weren’t designed to be stressed out for any lengthy period.Fight-or-flight is meant to persist for only a matter of minutes, but low-levelchronic stress activates these hormones too often, and their effect lasts toolong. What should be a temporary reaction becomes routine. The result is abiochemical imbalance that the brain and body have a hard time adjusting to. Youcan’t be in a meditative state and a stressful state at the same time; the twodon’t mesh. By “meditative state,” we mean a state of restful alertness, inwhich you feel calm and centered but very awake at the same time. Low-levelchronic stress imposes a very different mind-body state. The following symptomsare quite common in modern life, even among people who think that they haveadapted well to daily stresses (in fact, some high-performance types boast thatthey thrive on stress).Is Chronic Stress Getting to You?Some typical signs of low-level chronic stress> You feel irritable and on edge.> > Your muscles feel tight, especially in the neck and back.> > Your stomach is in knots.> > You swing between feeling highly alert and very dull.> > You lose energy quickly through the day.> > You find it hard to focus and concentrate.> > Your efficiency at work declines.> > When you go to bed at night, your mind races with thoughts, making it hard to> fall asleep.> > Sleep is shortened or restless.> > You wake up feeling tired.> > Your sex drive decreases.> > You feel slightly anxious without cause.> > You become lethargic and depressed.> > You find it hard to express enthusiasm and optimism.> > You feel unexplained aches and pains.> > You have digestive difficulties or intestinal pain.> > You catch more colds and flus than normal.As you can see, this is an extensive list. Millions of people ignore stressbecause they are willing to put up with less than ideal well-being, until theyreach the point where lack of sleep, flagging energy, free-floating anxiety, anddull attention become normal. More damage is done to natural beauty by theseoverlooked factors than anything else. If someone sees wrinkles, pallor, saggingskin, dull eyes, and other signs of premature aging in the mirror, they arereading the story of how they managed stress in the past. Nothing caused bychronic stress is normal, however, and as long as your body is subjected to thechemical imbalances created by stress, you will be out of balance.Why create such a valuable thing as the meditative state only to allow it to bedisrupted by your daily experiences? Our focus here is on avoiding that. Noone’s life is perfectly stress-free. At the same time, everyone’s life has areaswhere the stress can be reduced. To simplify the problem, at any given momentyou are doing one of the following:> Creating stress> > Reacting to stress caused by external forces> > Healing your stress and the stress around youWe’d like to help you get past the first two situations so that you can becomesomething new: a healer of stress. In this way you will be able to maintain therestful alertness that is the true foundation of mind-body balance. Every cellin your body will respond positively when this happens.The biggest step you can take is to reject the role of victim.People make jokes like “Gray hair is inherited. You get it from your children.”They complain about the stress and strain of modern life. It’s as if stress islike air pollution, existing all around us with very little we can do about it.But there’s a lot you can do about it, once you escape the role of victim.Earlier in this book we mentioned stress in passing, but not in terms ofachieving real, lasting control over it. By understanding how stress is created,you can begin to lower the stress level anywhere you find yourself—at work, infamily situations, in everyday crises and challenges.It’s true but often ignored that each of us is a creator of the stress we sufferfrom. Stress is viral. Once someone creates it, the stressful results spread toothers. The most infamous example is shouting “Fire!” in a crowded theater. Thespread of panic in a crowd seems like an extreme example, yet in smaller, lessglaring ways, any of us can contribute to the virus of stress. Here are someexamples of how this happens. Since one main area of stress for most people isat work, let’s start there.How Stress Goes Viral at WorkCommon conditions that create needless stress:> Someone is demanding, critical, and a perfectionist.> > The person in charge gives erratic orders prone to unpredictable changes.> > Co-workers show disrespect for one another or their work.> > An undignified work environment exists (e.g., a place where bad language,> gossip, and sexual remarks are allowed).> > Personal issues are brought to work and become everybody’s business.> > Workers are criticized in public.> > The people in authority can’t be trusted.> > There is constant pressure to meet deadlines.> > Worker loyalty isn’t valued.> > The threat of losing your job is present.> > A worker’s experience and knowledge are undervalued.> > Work rules are rigid, leaving little room for creativity and personal> suggestions.Reading over the list, consider the three options that face you every day.> Are you creating the stress?> > Are you reacting to stress from the outside?> > Are you helping to reduce and heal the stress?Some of the stressful behaviors on the list may seem very ordinary to you. Butthat’s generally a sign of denial. Each of these behaviors puts pressure on youor someone else, and with pressure the mind-body system reacts stressfully.Stress experts often refer to how ancient the stress response is, because thechemical triggers for it are located at the base of the skull in the oldestsection of the brain, known as the reptilian brain. The reptilian brain doesn’tthink about what is causing a sense of threat. The example is often given ofsomeone stuck in a traffic jam on the way home from work. The frustration of thesituation causes the secretion of the same fight-or-flight hormones as ourancestors experienced at the approach of a saber-toothed tiger. The lower braindoesn’t register the difference, which means that our response is primitive andchemical, not intelligent and rational.Therefore, even when you think you are doing something quite harmless andnecessary, such as criticizing another person for poor performance, the lowerbrain doesn’t register anything reasonable—it just feels threatened. The sameholds true outside the workplace in how we behave with our family and friends.It’s often said that modern life is stressful because we’re exposed to so muchnoise, speed, and complex tasks compared with our grandparents’ generation.Those are stressful factors, no doubt, but the worst stress is psychological. Wefall into the careless habit of putting pressure on others without realizing it.Psychological Stress—It’s All in the FamilyThe stressful habits of everyday life include the following:> Constant teasing, putting others down, picking on the weak> > Blaming someone else> > Harping on someone else’s faults and mistakes> > Not listening> > Not letting everyone have their say> > Being disrespectful> > Using verbal or emotional abuse> > Resorting to physical violence> > Refusing to take responsibility for your own actions> > Putting pressure on children to perform> > Making seniors feel old, useless, and unwanted> > Creating an atmosphere of resentment and complaint> > Filling the air with constant arguments> > Repeatedly rehashing old grievances> > Imposing rigid rules> > Making someone feel inferior or unwanted> > Being a harsh authority figure, or living under one> > Creating an atmosphere of emotional repression, where genuine feelings cannot> be expressed> > Unloving behavior in generalAs before, when you read over this list, you need to ask the followingquestions:> Are you creating the stress?> > Are you reacting to stress from the outside?> > Are you helping to reduce and heal the stress?Millions of people would say that they have a loving family while the reality isthat stressful behavior is going on under their roof. It’s easy to forget thatthe family is a place that should be as stress-free as possible. It’s not theplace where you go to dump your “stuff”—the complaints, negativity, anger, andfrustration accumulated during the day.We hate to say it, but many people who sincerely believe that they are on aspiritual path remain oblivious to the stressful behavior they exhibit orencourage in others. They lack self-awareness, which is what the spiritual pathis really all about.Once you understand how low-level stress is affecting you and those around you,you’ll want to break the cycle. You don’t have to adopt the role of victim. Atthe same time, you don’t have to adopt the opposite role of abuser or aggressor.The cycle of stressful behavior affects everyone equally. Ultimately, your goalis to find your inner love, truth, and beauty, letting them shine all aroundyou. Stress is incompatible with this goal, leaving aside all the other damageit creates.How to Be a Healer of StressIf stress can go viral, so can beauty. Radical Beauty is about radiating yourbeauty so that it uplifts those around you. This is a form of spiritual healing.Stress and spiritual aren’t two words you see together very often—one seems veryworldly while the other is very unworldly. But healing, whole, and holiness comefrom the same root word. When you are healed of the damage created by stress,you find your wholeness and your holiness.To become a healer of stress, you stop pressuring others—and yourself—at thepsychological level. Thinking psychologically doesn’t come easily for most ofus. Let’s return to the workplace again. If you’ve been taught that ahard-boiled attitude, confrontational tactics, and constant pressure are goodfor productivity, studies in the workplace do not bear this out. The bestworkplaces give workers their personal space, encourage creativity, allowflexible work hours, assign tasks according to everyone’s unique strengths, andcreate an atmosphere of general respect. This is basic psychology turned intopractice.If you don’t put much stock in psychology, look around you. If you are the focusor cause of stress in other people, the following things, either a few or a lot,will be evident: People don’t look happy around you or working for you. Theyavoid direct eye contact. They seem nervous in your presence. The atmospheregrows quiet and tense when you enter a room or give orders. There is silentresistance to giving you what you ask for—you have to ask a second time, andeven then there are delays. People under you make excuses, or else they havelost their motivation to perform.The real eye-opener, however, is to take the same look around the familysetting. Instead of workplace, substitute the home. In place of workers,substitute children or spouse. You may be shocked at how viral the stress aroundyou actually is. Society sends us messages about rebellious teenagers who won’tdo what they’re told, who act uncomfortable around adults, slack off at school,and exhibit a sullen, resentful attitude. These behaviors fit a stereotype, butthat doesn’t make them normal. They are signs of stress. We aren’t saying thatadolescence doesn’t have its special challenges, because it certainly does. Thepoint is that adding to those challenges with stressful pressures at home isjust as damaging as if the pressure was applied at work.It is generally futile to approach someone else and say, “I’m sorry, but yourbehavior is stressing me out.” All you’ll get is a defensive response thatpushes you away. The focus must be on you instead.By reversing your own stressful behavior, you become a healer of stress,breaking the circle once and for all. This is actually a powerful approach thatcan cause other people who have caused you stress to change before your eyes.We’ve seen it work with all kinds of difficult people, both at home and in theoffice.TWELVE WAYS YOU CAN HEAL STRESSBehaviors that reduce pressure on yourself and others:1. Back away from being demanding, critical, and a perfectionist.2. Be more consistent and less changeable in what you ask of others.3. Never show disrespect for other people.4. Maintain a dignified environment (e.g., a place where bad language, gossip,and sexual remarks are not condoned).5. Give other people their own space.6. Deal with your own stress instead of passing it down the line.7. Don’t create pets and favorites at the expense of someone who gets excludedor demeaned.8. Never offer criticism in public or at the dinner table.9. Take a personal interest in others, offering appreciation and praisegenerously.10. Be loyal; show that you can be trusted.11. When someone else is talking, pay attention and then follow through if theyneed something.12. Ask for more input from others, showing that you value their experience andknowledge.Think of these things in terms of letting inner beauty go viral. With smallchanges of behavior, along with self-awareness, you will be surprised to findthat you are becoming a beacon of light. This is testimony to your new reality:you have truly dedicated yourself to the path. The gap between your social selfand your true self is closing more and more, and the beauty of your true self isbecoming a reality."},{"pageContent":"STAGE 4: RESTING INTO EXISTENCEEvery woman knows the feeling of not being enough. So much is asked of today’swoman—and she asks even more of herself—that insecurity is just the beginning.There is a constant struggle against feeling anxious or depressed. There isdoubt about how one set of values—being successful and highly competent—canreally be compatible with another set of values—being loved, cherished, andhonored. The nagging question “Can I have it all?” hangs over the minds ofmillions of women every day.The answer to “Can I have it all?” isn’t easy to find in our society, but wefeel that there is an answer that gets overlooked. You can have it all when yourealize that you are all. There’s nothing you can buy in any store that willfill any empty feeling of lack. But when you find inner fulfillment, having itall is replaced by inner contentment with yourself, here and now, lackingnothing.Let’s say this is the right answer. How do you arrive at this state of totalinner fulfillment? By realizing your spiritual beauty. And how do you do that?By following the most powerful instructions on the spiritual path:> Surrender> > Let go> > Accept> > BeThese instructions aren’t easy to follow. We all feel a powerful desire to dosomething. We hate putting up with the bad things in our lives. Society promotesthe image of the go-getting, competitive person who is constantly on the move.It’s no surprise, then, that we’ve lost the skill—and the wisdom—of just lettinggo. We equate hanging loose with doing nothing. Yet at a deeper level, each ofthose words implies a hidden action that goes on beneath the surface:> Surrendering means you aren’t struggling anymore.> > Letting go means that you aren’t so attached and frustrated.> > Accepting means that you can appreciate and be grateful for your life.> > Being means that you trust a power beyond your own ego and limited> understanding.When you grasp what the words mean in spiritual terms, it dawns on you that amuch better life can be yours once you surrender, let go, accept, and simply be.We’ve put this in a single phrase: Resting into existence. In every spiritualtradition, importance is placed on surrendering to God, but it’s an idea thatdoesn’t seem applicable in modern times. In the past, when our distant ancestorswere preoccupied every day with getting enough to eat, disaster struck if cropsfailed or game was scarce. Trusting in God to provide was the only way anyonehad of connecting with nature’s external forces. But today the vast majority ofwork is done in offices and corporations; these are settings where people feelthey have much more control over what happens. There is little or no need totrust in a higher power except in unforeseen emergencies and crises. Even then,many people place their trust only on human agencies like law enforcement.So asking you to place your trust in your own existence is asking a lot. As astrategy for living, this might sound quite strange, in fact. But consider thefollowing possibilities:> What if life is meant to flow, bringing fulfillment as a natural unfoldment?> > What if you are connected to a deep source of intelligence that knows how to> take care of you and your needs?> > What if there’s a higher plan that is guiding your life?None of these ideas is completely foreign. We’ve all been exposed to sayingslike “Everything happens for a reason” and “God has a plan.” The problem is thatthe divine plan, if it exists, is invisible and unpredictable. Not to mentionthat putting the argument in religious terms runs against the grain of modernlife, where the secular world is based on real-life events and things we cansee, hear, and touch.In other words, there’s a gap between a beautiful idea—that every life has ameaning that unfolds in the best possible way—and our daily experience. You mayhave read of a life strategy that consists of always saying yes and never sayingno. This is a form of complete surrender, because saying yes to literallyeverything implies enormous trust that something won’t go terribly wrong. (Wouldyou say yes to every stranger who offers you a ride, every unsolicited phonecaller who asks for money, every request made by your five-year-old child?) Onthe other hand, saying no puts you in opposition to other people, creatingclashes and disagreements along with missed opportunities. (Would you have saidno twenty years ago if you were offered shares in Apple at its lowest price inthe stock market?)Deciding when to say yes and when to say no is, in fact, one of the hardestchallenges in everyone’s life. Who you marry and what kind of work you do dependon giving the right answer, as do thousands of smaller choices. But if sayingyes all the time doesn’t work, and neither does saying no all the time, what’sthe alternative? Must we muddle through trying to figure out the right answer ona case-by-case basis?Most people are already doing that. If there’s a better way, perhaps the world’swisdom traditions offer it. From their perspective, the soul knows best. So whatwould the soul do? That’s an intimate matter. Your soul sees every situationthrough fresh eyes, and they aren’t the eyes of anyone else. Even so, there’s apattern of trust that needs to develop inside each of us, in which we rely onthe true self to bring the right solutions to everyday challenges.You can’t trust and be in total control at the same time; the two aren’tcompatible. Letting go is how trust develops. You stop worrying that everythingdepends on you. There’s a parable from India that begins to shed light on why aperson can rest easy and trust in their own existence. The parable isn’t couchedin religious terms at all. It’s about a coachman driving a team of six horses.The horses are spirited, and the coachman whips them to go faster and faster.Suddenly from inside the coach a quiet voice says, “Stop the coach.” At firstthe driver can’t believe his ears, and he cracks his whip even harder. But soonthe same voice inside the coach whispers, “Stop the coach.” Now the driver feelsnervous, and he says aloud, “Why should I stop? I know how to drive, and I wantto go faster.” To which the voice replies, “But I own this coach, and I saystop.” At this point the driver has no choice, and the coach comes to a halt.The meaning of the parable is only revealed when you know that the coachman isthe ego, the six horses are the five senses and the mind, and the owner of thecoach is the higher self. We spend our lives with the ego acting as if it is incharge, and it takes control over the five senses and the mind, which obey theego’s commands willingly. Like horses in harness, our five senses and the mindcan be directed this way and that. We see what the ego wants us to see; we hearwhat it wants us to hear. As for the mind, it can be conditioned to believewhatever story the ego tells it.We’ve all been told a similar story, as it turns out, which keeps being repeatedgeneration after generation. It’s the story of life as a constant struggle wherehumans are puny things confronted by the inexorable powers of nature. No one isimmune from danger and looming catastrophe. Because life isn’t fair and natureis blind, we have no choice but to struggle if we want to survive.The parable of the coachman contradicts this story by saying that despite allappearances, the ego isn’t actually in charge of how life unfolds. The owner ofthe coach is Atman, the higher self, which we have been calling the true self.We’ve been describing the true self as the source of beauty, intelligence,truth, and creativity inside everyone. It has been in control of our lives fromthe moment of birth, but the ego, with its convincing story about life as aconstant struggle, has taken over. As long as the ego dominates our awareness,we lose sight of how reality actually works, the same way the coachman lostsight of the fact that he didn’t own the coach.At some point in your personal growth, you will want to test the possibilitythat you could be living a new story. You don’t have to test this new story byfighting against the ego and its constant demands, fears, old memories, andoutworn conditioning. All you have to do is rest into existence. This is reallythe process of accepting your own spiritual beauty. On a daily basis you do thefollowing things.The Practical Side of SurrenderHow to let your spiritual beauty shine through:> When there’s a problem, look inside for the solution, knowing that it will be> there.> > Even when the details aren’t perfect, accept that the larger picture will turn> out alright in the end.> > Don’t act when you feel upset, angry, afraid, or uncertain.> > Stay centered, and when you realize you aren’t centered, take a few moments to> restore your sense of balance and calm.> > As much as possible, don’t put up resistance to other people. Be open-minded> and tolerant toward their point of view.> > Maintain a seamless flow in your activity.> > Don’t exert yourself to the point of exhaustion but don’t slack off.> > Look for hints from your higher self about which way to turn. Learn to trust> your instincts.> > Don’t do what you already know to be wrong.> > Look upon outward situations as a reflection of your inner situation.> > Take responsibility for what you say, think, and do, without projecting blame> or depending on someone else to take care of things.Each of these items can be tested at your own pace. For most people, changingtheir story only begins when they see hope that it can be changed. Inertia is apowerful force. If you have landed in a bad relationship or a job you hate, ifyou feel lonely all the time or struggle with depression, it’s unrealistic tosay, “I’ll just trust that everything’s okay and go with the flow.” We aren’tadvising you to do that. Instead, you need to be reasonably centered to beginwith, which comes about through meditation. You need to feel reasonably free ofdamaging stress and have enough room to make some new choices. If thesepreconditions aren’t met, this doesn’t mean you are in a hopeless predicament;it only means that you should look to earlier stages of growth as your startingpoint.Many people, however, are ready to change the story of life as a struggle, andtherefore they can begin to experience a more open, relaxed, and trusting way oflife. One drawback of religious and spiritual traditions, however beautifultheir message, is a lack of practicality. Too often the hard world is regardedas the enemy of spirit, which also implies that you must choose one or theother. Either it’s worldly success or living in the light, with no middleground. On this basis, or something similar, millions of people yearn forspirituality but keep postponing it, for fear of what they might lose in worldlysatisfactions.But if your outer situation is good, your inner situation is probably good, too.Most of us experience a mixture of good and bad in both realms, which is why wecan’t see a clear path forward. We are more likely to deal with worldlythings—work, family, politics, relationships, community activities—on their ownterms, sealing our inner lives off as something private and isolated. But themessage that needs to come through is that inner and outer are never separate,and when you begin to trust that you are safe and cared for from a deep levelwithin yourself, the two halves of your life can be united. In wholeness liesthe beauty of the soul—the essence of Radical Beauty—which is yours to claim asyour own and to celebrate forever."},{"pageContent":"STAGE 5: THE TRUE SELF BECOMES THE ONLY SELFWe’ve painted a picture of spiritual beauty that can entirely change yourlife—it’s the most radical kind of beauty there is. Beginning with experiencesthat everyone has had—being loved, or observing the innocence of children andseeing a glorious sunset—a new way of life opens. The choice is yours. You canwalk the path to inner beauty or hold back instead. Because there is so muchpotential inside you for love, truth, and beauty, you have the support of thosethings simply by being here on this planet. The choice to walk the path is anoption that is never canceled, because the world’s wisdom traditions declarethat love, truth, and beauty are eternal.Today your true self awaits you, as it has patiently waited every day. If youchoose to, you can journey to where your true self lives, deep inside yourawareness. What happens then? You will be transformed in the image of your trueself. You will experience as your daily reality something beautifully expressedby the great Indian poet Rabindranath Tagore: “Love is the only reality and itis not a mere sentiment. It is the ultimate truth that lies at the heart ofcreation.” To find the heart of creation, you must explore your own heart.Inside it are stored many experiences of love and non-love.The Promise of TransformationRadical Beauty is a journey of transformation. This hardly seems possible in ourtime, when so many people struggle to maintain meaning and purpose in theirlives. There is no model for accepting unconditional love as the ultimatereality. In a celebrity culture, outer beauty is accepted as a sign of innerbeauty—perhaps—but the connection could be imaginary. The real connectionbetween inner and outer beauty begins inside, as we have emphasized in thisbook. When that connection is unbreakable, you will find yourself transformedcompletely.The Signs of TransformationThe qualities of the true self dawning in your life:> Complete self-acceptance: “I am here, and I am enough.”> > Self-love as a natural state that never changes: “My purpose has always been> about love.”> > A life filled with meaning and purpose: “I find joy pursuing my vision.”> > Inner peace: “I find fulfillment in stillness.”> > Reverence for life: “I take tender care of everything in creation.”> > A sense of common humanity with all other people: “The world is my family.”> > Empathy without judgment: “Let me embrace you, whoever you are.”> > A sense of unbounded possibilities: “My creativity finds a new way to express> itself every day.”> > The expansion of personal identity as “I” becomes connected to cosmic> consciousness: “I see myself in all I behold.”> > The expression of love, truth, and beauty appears in daily activity: “There is> no difference between the truth I live, the beauty I behold, and the love I> feel.”You may think that these are fairy-tale qualities never achieved in therough-and-tumble of daily existence. Perhaps only a few exceptional individuals,born with unshakable faith, are fated to get anywhere near the true self. Butfaith isn’t by any means what you need the most if you want to journey to thetrue self. Far more important are knowledge and experience. At this moment, youhave your share of both. You have experienced how beautiful life can be, even ifthis has happened only in scattered glimpses. You have the knowledge of howinner beauty unfolds after reading this book. Therefore, the keys totransformation are already in your hands—there is no ancient, hidden secret thatmust be mysteriously imported.Only one thing is left for you to do: activate your evolution. How? By puttingyour attention on the good things you want to increase in your life. In a word,become the change you want to see.The qualities of the true self never go away, but people don’t activate them.When we find ourselves pulled back into the demands of our busy lives, thedesire to grow and evolve becomes blurred and overlooked. At that point, there’sa disconnect. On a clear night you can walk outside and gaze at thousands ofstars and galaxies; on any clear morning you can watch the sunrise in all itsdelicate beauty. Choosing to see external beauty is a possibility for everyone.What takes dedication is to turn inward and discover the same awe and wonderwhen you behold yourself.Mirabai was a princess in medieval India who also happened to be a greatmystical poet. She speaks poignantly of the life that is possible only throughtransformation:> Take me to that place no one can travel to> > Where death is afraid> > And swans alight to play> > On the overflowing lake of love.> > There the faithful gather> > Ever true to their Lord.Mirabai lived in religious times, during an age of faith, but “that place no onecan travel to” is the same true self we have been discussing. You can’t travelto it because there’s nowhere to go “out there” in the world. Once you dedicateyourself to the path, you are making a personal promise to participate in acompletely transformed reality. That’s what personal evolution can achieve, andonly personal evolution. It allows transformation to take place on the inside,and when this happens, transformation on the outside follows effortlessly. Youcan’t force it. Of course you can work toward separate changes in your life—weall do that. You can lose weight, treat depression, find a new partner, quitsmoking, and so on. Such efforts can be difficult, because they require you tobreak old habits or to make drastic changes that bother the people around you.But transformation is different, because it involves the whole person, notindividual changes that occur one at a time. Spiritual traditions around theworld often use the same term—a second birth—to describe what innertransformation is like. A second birth erases all the mistakes of the past andreturns the person to a state of innocence, a completely fresh start.It’s a beautiful ideal, but in practical terms, there’s a problem. No one needsto change everything about themself. In everyone’s life there are good and badparts. Looking at yourself today, you could list many aspects of your currentsituation that you value and love, along with achievements you’re proud of andyears of maturation that turned you into a worthy person.Would you really want to give up all of this for the promise of a fresh start?No, of course not—and you don’t have to. As a process, transformation mirrorswhat happens every day to an infant as it develops, stage by stage, from themoment of birth. An infant does nothing except be itself. On Tuesday the thingsit experiences aren’t very different from the experiences on Monday.Yet at a deeper level—in this case the unfolding of the potential inside humanDNA—each day isn’t the same as the day before. The infant is growing anddeveloping, without actually making any special effort. One day a small childmay be fascinated with paper dolls and playing in a sandbox. Turn around, andsix months later these are playthings of the past, and something new, likealphabet blocks and learning a song, are fascinating instead. What’s happening,and what continues to happen throughout a lifetime, is inner growth—evolution.This tells us that evolution is natural; there’s almost nothing about you as atwo-year-old that is the same as the self you are today. What was hidden insideyou back then were seeds and potentials. Why does it feel, as so many peoplereport, that they aren’t achieving their full potential? Because as adults wemust consciously choose to evolve.We’ve shown you many facets of Radical Beauty, and we’ve saved the mostimportant for last: renewal. Whatever path you take, please, please renewyourself, forever and without end. Life is a process of endless renewal, and youstand at the switch, doing what it takes to move your evolution forward or theopposite, causing it to slow down or come to a halt.From this moment forward, you can become as beautiful as anything in creation,surpassing even the most perfect rose by virtue of this rare gift calledself-awareness. We’ll leave you with the words of Rumi, the Persian poet whotestifies to the hidden beauty behind all things.> The Open Door> > People are constantly crossing> > The threshold of eternity.> > The door is open> > If you can stay awake."},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX:RADICAL BEAUTY RECIPESRadical Beauty SaladsRadical Beauty SoupsRadical Beauty EntréesRadical Beauty DessertsNote: As with all Radical Beauty recipes throughout the book and this section,we encourage you to use organic ingredients as much as possible.RADICAL BEAUTY SALADSANTIOXIDANT VEGGIE AND GARBANZO BEAN SALADSERVES 3 TO 41½ cups cooked and drained garbanzo beans (also called chickpeas)1½ cups roughly chopped fresh arugula¾ cup chopped red bell pepper¾ cup chopped seeded English cucumbers1 small yellow tomato, diced⅓ cup chopped celery1½ tablespoons lime juice¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil or avocado oil1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil¼ teaspoon sea salt, or to tasteFreshly ground black pepper to taste¼ teaspoon dried oreganoIn a medium bowl, mix the garbanzo beans and all the vegetables together.
