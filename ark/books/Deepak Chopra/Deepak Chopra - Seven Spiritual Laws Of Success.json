In my book, CreatingAffluence: Wealth Consciousness in the Field of All Possibilities, I haveoutlined the steps to wealth consciousness based on a true understanding of theworkings of nature. The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success form the essence of thisteaching. When this knowledge is incorporated in your consciousness, it willgive you the ability to create unlimited wealth with effortless ease, and toexperience success in every endeavour. Success in life could be defined as thecontinued expansion of happiness and the progressive realization of worthygoals. Success is the ability to fulfill your desires with effortless ease. Andyet success, including the creation of wealth, has always been considered to bea process that requires hard work, and it is often considered to be at theexpense of others. We need a more spiritual approach to success and toaffluence, which is the abundant flow of all good things to you. With theknowledge and practice of spiritual law, we put ourselves in harmony with natureand create with carefulness, joy, and love. There are many aspects to success;material wealth is only one component. Moreover, success is a journey, not adestination. Material abundance, in all its expressions, happens to be one ofthose things that makes the journey more enjoyable. But success also includesgood health, energy and enthusiasm for life, fulfilling relationships, creativefreedom, emotional and psychological stability, a sense of well-being, and peaceof mind. Even with the experience of all these things, we will remainunfulfilled unless we nurture the seeds of divinity inside us. In reality, weare divinity in disguise, and the gods and goddesses in embryo that arecontained within us seek to be fully materialized. True success is therefore theexperience of the miraculous. It is the unfolding of the divinity within us. Itis the perception of divinity wherever we go, in whatever we perceive  in theeyes of a child, in the beauty of a flower, in the flight of a bird. When webegin to experience our life as the miraculous expression of divinity  notoccasionally, but all the time  then we will know the true meaning of success.Before defining the seven spiritual laws, let us understand the concept of law.Law is the process by which the unmanifest becomes the manifest; its theprocess by which the observer becomes the observed; its the process by whichthe seer becomes the scenery; its the process through which the dreamermanifests the dream.All of creation, everything that exists in the physical world, is the result ofthe unmanifest transforming itself into the manifest. Everything that we beholdcomes from the unknown. Our physical body, the physical universe  anything andeverything that we can perceive through our senses  is the transformation ofthe unmanifest, unknown, and invisible into the manifest, known, and visible.The physical universe is nothing other than the Self curving back within Itselfto experience Itself as spirit, mind, and physical matter. In other words, allprocesses of creation are processes through which the Self or divinity expressesItself. Consciousness in motion expresses itself as the objects of the universein the eternal dance of life. The source of all creation is divinity (or thespirit); the process of creation is divinity in motion (or the mind); and theobject of creation is the physical universe (which includes the physical body).These three components of reality  spirit, mind, and body, or observer, theprocess of observing, and the observed  are essentially the same thing. Theyall come from the same place: the field of pure potentiality which is purelyunmanifest. The physical laws of the universe are actually this whole process ofdivinity in motion, or consciousness in motion. When we understand these lawsand apply them in our lives, anything we want can be created, because the samelaws that nature uses to create a forest, or a galaxy, or a star, or a humanbody can also bring about the fulfillment of our deepest desires. Now lets goover The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success and see how we can apply them in ourlives.1The law of purepotentialityThe law of pure potentiality¶7The source of all creation is pure consciousness, pure potentiality seekingexpression from the unmanifest to the manifest.And when we realise that our true Self is one of pure potentiality, we alignwith the power that manifests everything in the universe.In the beginning there was neither existencenor non-existence,All this world was unmanifest energy . . .The One breathed, without breath, by Its ownpower Nothing else was there . . . Hymn of Creation, The Rig VedaThe first spiritual law of success is the Law of Pure Potentiality. This law isbased on the fact that we are, in our essential state, pure consciousness. Pureconsciousness is pure potentiality; it is the field of all possibilities andinfinite creativity. Pure consciousness is our spiritual essence. Being infiniteand unbounded, it is also pure joy. Other attributes of consciousness are pureknowledge, infinite silence, perfect balance, invincibility, simplicity, andbliss. This is our essential nature. Our essential nature is one of purepotentiality. When you discover your essential nature and know who you reallyare, in that knowing itself is the ability to fulfill any dream you have,because you are the eternal possibility, the immeasurable potential of all thatwas, is, and will be. The Law of Pure Potentiality could also be called the Lawof Unity, because underlying the infinite diversity of life is the unity of oneallpervasive spirit. There is no separation between you and this field ofenergy. The field of pure potentiality is your own Self. And the more youexperience your true nature, the closer you are to the field of purepotentiality.The experience of the Self, or self-referral, means that our internalreference point is our own spirit, and not the objects of our experience. Theopposite of self-referral is object-referral. In object-referral we are alwaysinfluenced by objects outside the Self, which include situations, circumstances,people, and things. In object-referral we are constantly seeking the approval ofothers. Our thinking and our behaviour are always in anticipation of a response.It is therefore fear-based.In object-referral we also feel an intense need to control things. We feel anintense need for external power. The need for approval, the need to controlthings, and the need for external power are needs that are based on fear. Thiskind of power is not the power of pure potentiality, or the power of the Self,or real power. When we experience the power of the Self, there is an absence offear, there is no compulsion to control, and no struggle for approval orexternal power.In object-referral, your internal reference point is your ego. The ego, however,is not who you really are. The ego is your self-image; it is your social mask;it is the role you are playing. Your social mask thrives on approval. It wantsto control, and it is sustained by power, because it lives in fear.Your true Self, which is your spirit, your soul, is ^completely free of thosethings. It is immune to criticism, it is unfearful of any challenge, and itfeels beneath no one. And yet, it is also humble and feels superior to no one,because it recognizes that everyone else is the same Self, the same spirit indifferent disguises.The Seven spiritual laws of Success¶8Thats the essential difference between object-referral and self-referral. Inself-referral, you experience your true being, which is unfearful of anychallenge, has respect for all people, and feels beneath no one. Self-power istherefore true power. Power based on object-referral, however, is false power.Being ego-based power, it lasts only as long as the object of reference isthere. If you have a certain title  if youre the president of the country orthe chairman of a corporation  or if you have a lot of money, the power youenjoy goes with the title, with the job, with the money. Ego-based power willonly last as long as those things last. As soon as the title, the job, the moneygo away, so does the power.Self-power, on the other hand, is permanent, because it is based on theknowledge of the Self. And there are certain characteristics of self-power. Itdraws people to you, and it also draws things that you want to you. Itmagnetizes people, situations, and circumstances to support your desires. Thisis also called support from the laws of nature. It is the support of divinity;it is the support that comes from being in the state of grace. Your power issuch that you enjoy a bond with people, and people enjoy a bond with you. Yourpower is that of bonding  a bonding that comes from true love. How can we applythe Law of Pure Potentiality, the field of all possibilities, to our lives? Ifyou want to enjoy the benefits of the field of pure potentiality, if you want tomake full use of the creativity which is inherent in pure consciousness, thenyou have to have access to it. One way to access the field is through the dailypractice of silence, meditation, and non-judgment. Spending time in nature willalso give you access to the qualities inherent in the field: infinitecreativity, freedom, and bliss.Practicing silence means making a commitment to take a certain amount of time tosimply Be. Experiencing silence means periodically withdrawing from the activityof speech. It also means periodically withdrawing from such activities aswatching television, listening to the radio, or reading a book. If you nevergive yourself the opportunity to experience silence, this creates turbulence inyour internal dialogue.Set aside a little time every once in a while to experience silence. Or simplymake a commitment to maintain silence for a certain period each day. You coulddo it for two hours, or if that seems a lot, do it for a one-hour period. Andevery once in a while experience silence for an extended period of time, such asa full day, or two days, or even a whole week. What happens when you go intothis experience of silence? Initially your internal dialogue becomes even moreturbulent. You feel an intense need to say things. Ive known people who goabsolutely crazy the first day or two when they commit themselves to an extendedperiod of silence. A sense of urgency and anxiety suddenly comes over them. Butas they stay with the experience, their internal dialogue begins to quieten. Andsoon the silence becomes profound. This is because after a while the mind givesup; it realizes there is no point in going around and around if you  the Self,the spirit, the choice-maker  are not going to speak, period. Then, as theinternal dialogue quietens, you begin to experience the stillness of the fieldof pure potentiality.Practicing silence periodically as it is convenient to you is one way toexperience the Law of Pure Potentiality. Spending time each day in meditation isanother. Ideally, you should meditate at least thirty minutes in the morning,and thirty minutes in the evening. Through meditation you will learn toexperience the field of pure silence and pure awareness. In that field of puresilence is the field of infinite correlation, the field of infinite organizingpower, the ultimate ground of creation where everything is inseparably connectedwith everything else. 9The law of pure potentiality¶In the fifth spiritual law, the Law of Intention and Desire, you will see howyou can introduce a faint impulse of intention in this field, and the creationof your desires will come about spontaneously. But first, you have to experiencestillness. Stillness is the first requirement for manifesting your desires,because in stillness lies your connection to the field of pure potentiality thatcan orchestrate an infinity of details for you.Imagine throwing a little stone into a still pond and watching it ripple. Then,after a while, when the ripples settle down, perhaps you throw another littlestone. Thats exactly what you do when you go into the field of pure silence andintroduce your intention. In this silence, even the faintest intention willripple across the underlying ground of universal consciousness, which connectseverything with everything else. But, if you do not experience stillness inconsciousness, if your mind is like a turbulent ocean, you could throw theEmpire State Building into it, and you wouldnt notice a thing. In the Bible isthe expression, Be still, and know that I am God. This can only beaccomplished through meditation. Another way to access the field of purepotentiality is through the practice of non-judgment. Judgment is the constantevaluation of things as right or wrong, good or bad. When you are constantlyevaluating, classifying, labeling, analyzing, you create a lot of turbulence inyour internal dialogue. This turbulence constricts the flow of energy betweenyou and the field of pure potentiality. You literally squeeze the gap betweenthoughts. The gap is your connection to the field of pure potentiality. It isthat state of pure awareness, that silent space between thoughts, that innerstillness that connects you to true power. And when you squeeze the gap, yousqueeze your connection to the field of pure potentiality and infinitecreativity.There is a prayer in A Course in Miracles that states, Today I shall judgenothing that occurs. Non-judgment creates silence in your mind. It is a goodidea, therefore, to begin your day with that statement. And throughout the day,remind yourself of that statement each time you catch yourself judging. Ifpracticing this procedure for the whole day seems too difficult, then you maysimply say to yourself, For the next two hours, I wont judge anything, orFor the next hour, I will experience non-judgment. Then you can extend itgradually. Through silence, through meditation, and through non-judgment, youwill access the first law, the Law of Pure Potentiality. Once you start doingthat, you can add a fourth component to this practice, and that is regularlyspending time in direct communion with nature. Spending time in nature enablesyou to sense the harmonious interaction of all the elements and forces of life,and gives you a sense of unity with all of life. Whether it be a stream, aforest, a mountain, a lake, or the seashore, that connection with naturesintelligence will also help you access the field of pure potentiality.You must learn to get in touch with the innermost essence of your being. Thistrue essence is beyond the ego. It is fearless; it is free; it is immune tocriticism; it does not fear any challenge. It is beneath no one, superior to noone, and full of magic, mystery, and enchantment. Access to your true essencewill also give you insight into the mirror of relationship, because allrelationship is a reflection of your relationship with yourself. For example, ifyou have guilt, fear, and insecurity over money, or success, or anything else,then these are reflections of guilt, fear, and insecurity as basic aspects ofyour personality. No amount of money or success will solve these basic problemsof existence; only intimacy with the Self will bring about true healing. Andwhen you are grounded in the knowledge of your true Self  when you reallyunderstand your true nature  you will never feel guilty, fearful, or insecureabout money, or affluence, or fulfilling your desires, because you will realizethat the essence of all material wealth is life energy, it is pure potentiality.And pure potentiality is your intrinsic nature. The Seven spiritual laws ofSuccess¶10As you gain more and more access to your true nature, you will alsospontaneously receive creative thoughts, because the field of pure potentialityis also the field of infinite creativity and pure knowledge. Franz Kafka, theAustrian philosopher and poet, once said, You need not leave your room. Remainsitting at your table and listen. You need not even listen, simply wait. Youneed not even wait, just learn to become quiet, and still, and solitary. Theworld will freely offer itself to you to be unmasked. It has no choice; it willroll in ecstasy at your feet.The affluence of the universe  the lavish display and abundance of the universe is an expression of the creative mind of nature. The more tuned in you are tothe mind of nature, the more you have access to its infinite, unboundedcreativity. But first, you have to go beyond the turbulence of your internaldialogue to connect with that abundant, affluent, infinite, creative mind. Andthen you create the possibility of dynamic activity while at the same timecarrying the stillness of the eternal, unbounded, creative mind. This exquisitecombination of silent, unbounded, infinite mind along with dynamic, bounded,individual mind is the perfect balance of stillness and movement simultaneouslythat can create whatever you want. This coexistence of opposites  stillness anddynamism at the same time  makes you independent of situations, circumstances,people, and things.When you quietly acknowledge this exquisite coexistence of opposites, you alignyourself with the world of energy  the quantum soup, the non-material non-stuffthat is the source of the material world. This world of energy is fluid,dynamic, resilient, changing, forever in motion. And yet it is alsonon-changing, still, quiet, eternal, and silent. Stillness alone is thepotentiality for creativity; movement alone is creativity restricted to acertain aspect of its expression. But the combination of movement and stillnessenables you to unleash your creativity in all directions  wherever the power ofyour attention takes you. Wherever you go in the midst of movement and activity,carry your stillness within you. Then the chaotic movement around you will neverovershadow your access to the reservoir of creativity, the field of purepotentiality.APPLYING THE LAW OF PURE POTENTIALITYI will put the Law of Pure Potentiality into effect by making a commitment totake the following steps:(1) I will get in touch with the field of pure potentiality by taking time eachday to be silent, to just Be. I will also sit alone in silent meditation atleast twice a day for approximately thirty minutes in the morning and thirtyminutes in the evening. (2) I will take time each day to commune with nature andto silently witness the intelligence within every living thing. I will sitsilently and watch a sunset, or listen to the sound of the ocean or a stream, orsimply smell the scent of a flower. In the ecstasy of my own silence, and bycommuning with nature, 1 will enjoy the lire throb of ages, the field of purepotentiality and unbounded creativity.(3) I will practice non-judgment. I will begin my day with the statement,Today, I shall judge nothing that occurs, and throughout the day I will remindmyself not to judge. 2The Law ofGivingThe Seven spiritual laws of Success¶12The universe operates through dynamic exchange... giving and receiving aredifferent aspects of the flow of energy in the universe.And in our willingness to give that which weseek, we keep the abundance of the universe circulating in our lives. This frailvessel thou emptiest again and again,and fillest it ever with fresh life. This little flute of a reed thou hastcarried over hills and dales, and hastbreathed through it melodies eternally new. . . . Thyinfinite gifts come to me only on those very smallhands of mine. Ages pass, and still thou pourest,and still there is room to fill. Rabindranath Tagore, GitanjaliThe second spiritual law of success is the Law of Giving. This law could also becalled the Law of Giving and Receiving, because the universe operates throughdynamic exchange. Nothing is static. Your body is in dynamic and constantexchange with the body of the universe; your mind is dynamically interactingwith the mind of the cosmos; your energy is an expression of cosmic energy.The flow of life is nothing other than the harmonious interaction of all theelements and forces that structure the field of existence. This harmoniousinteraction of elements and forces in your life operates as the Law of Giving.Because your body and your mind and the universe are in constant and dynamicexchange, stopping the circulation of energy is like stopping the flow of blood.Whenever blood stops flowing, it begins to clot, to coagulate, to stagnate. Thatis why you must give and receive in order to keep wealth and affluence  oranything you want in life  circulating in your life.The word affluence comes from the root word affluere, which means to flowto. The word affluence means to flow in abundance. Money is really a symbolof the life energy we exchange and the life energy we use as a result of theservice we provide to the universe. Another word for money is currency, whichalso reflects the flowing nature of energy. The word currency comes from theLatin word currere which means to run or to flow. Therefore, if we stop thecirculation of money  if our only intention is to hold on to our money andhoard it  since it is life energy, we will stop its circulation back into ourlives as well. In order to keep that energy coming to us, we have to keep theenergy circulating. Like a river, money must keep flowing, otherwise it beginsto stagnate, to clog, to suffocate and strangle its very own life force.Circulation keeps it alive and vital. Every relationship is one of give andtake. Giving engenders receiving, and receiving engenders giving. What goes upmust come down; what goes out must come back. In reality, receiving is the samething as giving, because giving and receiving are different aspects of the flowof energy in the universe. And if you stop the flow of either, you interferewith natures intelligence.In every seed is the promise of thousands of forests. But the seed must not behoarded; it must give its intelligence to the fertile ground. Through itsgiving, its unseen energy flows into material manifestation.13The law of Giving¶The more you give, the more you will receive, because you will keep theabundance of the universe circulating in your life. In fact, anything that is ofvalue in life only multiplies when it is given. That which doesnt multiplythrough giving is neither worth giving nor worth receiving. If, through the actof giving, you feel you have lost something, then the gift is not truly givenand will not cause increase. If you give grudgingly, there is no energy behindthat giving. It is the intention behind your giving and receiving that is themost important thing. The intention should always be to create happiness for thegiver and receiver, because happiness is life-supporting and life-sustaining andtherefore generates increase. The return is directly proportional to the givingwhen it is unconditional and from the heart. That is why the act of giving hasto be joyful  the frame of mind has to be one in which you feel joy in the veryact of giving. Then the energy behind the giving increases many times over.Practicing the Law of Giving is actually very simple: if you want joy, give joyto others; if you want love, learn to give love; if you want attention andappreciation, learn to give attention and appreciation; if you want materialaffluence, help others to become materially affluent. In fact, the easiest wayto get what you want is to help others get what they want. This principle worksequally well for individuals, corporations, societies, and nations. If you wantto be blessed with all the good things in life, learn to silently bless everyonewith all the good things in life. Even the thought of giving, the thought ofblessing, or a simple prayer has the power to affect others. This is because ourbody, reduced to its essential state, is a localized bundle of energy andinformation in a universe of energy and information. We are localized bundles ofconsciousness in a conscious universe. The word consciousness implies morethan just energy and information  it implies energy and information which isalive as thought. Therefore we are bundles of thought in a thinking universe.And thought has the power to transform. Life is the eternal dance ofconsciousness that expresses itself as the dynamic exchange of impulses ofintelligence between microcosm and macrocosm, between the human body and theuniversal body, between the human mind and the cosmic mind. When you learn togive that which you seek, you activate and choreograph the dance with anexquisite, energetic, and vital movement that constitutes the eternal throb oflife. The best way to put the Law of Giving into operation  to start the wholeprocess of circulation  is to make a decision that any time you come intocontact with anyone, you will give them something. It doesnt have to be in theform of material things; it could be a flower, a compliment, or a prayer. Infact, the most powerful forms of giving are non-material. The gifts of caring,attention, affection, appreciation, and love are some of the most precious giftsyou can give, and they dont cost you anything.When you meet someone, you can silently send them a blessing, wishing themhappiness, joy, and laughter. This kind of silent giving is very powerful. Oneof the things I was taught as a child, and which I taught my children also, isnever to go to anyones house without bringing something  never visit anyonewithout bringing them a gift. You may say, How can I give to others when at themoment I dont have enough myself?You can bring a flower. One flower. You can bring a note or a card which sayssomething about your feelings for the person youre visiting. You can bring acompliment. You can bring a prayer.Make a decision to give wherever you go, to whomever you see. As long as youregiving, you will be receiving. The more you give, the more confidence you willgain in the miraculous effects of this law. And as you receive more, yourability to give more will also increase. Our true nature is one of affluence andabundance; we are naturally affluent because nature supports every need anddesire. We lack nothing, because our essential nature is one of pure The Sevenspiritual laws of Success¶14potentiality and infinite possibilities. Therefore, you must know that you arealready inherently affluent, no matter how much or how little money you have,because the source of all wealth is the field of pure potentiality  it is theconsciousness that knows how to fulfill every need, including joy, love,laughter, peace, harmony, and knowledge. If you seek these things first not only for yourself, but for others  all else will come to you spontaneously.APPLYING THE LAW OF GIVINGI will put the Law of Giving into effect by making a commitment to take thefollowing steps: (1) Wherever I go, and whoever I encounter, I will bring them agift. The gift may be a compliment, a flower, or a prayer. Today, I will givesomething to everyone I come into contact with, and so I will begin the processof circulating joy, wealth and affluence in my life and in the lives of others.(2) Today I will gratefully receive all the gifts that life has to offer me. Iwill receive the gifts of nature: sunlight and the sound of birds singing, orspring showers or the first snow of winter. I will also be open to receivingfrom others, whether it be in the form of a material gift, money, a compliment,or a prayer.(3) I will make a commitment to keep wealth circulating in my life by giving andreceiving lifes most precious gifts: the gifts of caring, affection,appreciation, and love. Each time I meet someone, I will silently wish themhappiness, joy, and laughter. 3The lawof karmaor causeand effectThe Seven spiritual laws of Success¶16Every action generates a force of energy thatreturns to us in like kind . . . what we sow is what we reap.And when we chooseactions that bring happiness and success to others, the fruit of our karma ishappiness and success.Karma is the eternal assertion of human freedom. . . . Our thoughts, our words,and deeds are the threads of the net which we throw around ourselves. SwamiVivekananda The third spiritual law of success is the Law of Karma. Karma isboth action and the consequence of that action; it is cause and effectsimultaneously, because every action generates a force of energy that returns tous in like kind. There is nothing unfamiliar about the Law of Karma. Everyonehas heard the expression, What you sow is what you reap. Obviously, if we wantto create happiness in our lives, we must learn to sow the seeds of happiness.Therefore, karma implies the action of conscious choice-making. You and I areessentially infinite choice-makers. In every moment of our existence, we are inthat field of all possibilities where we have access to an infinity of choices.Some of these choices are made consciously, while others are made unconsciously.But the best way to understand and maximize the use of karmic law is to becomeconsciously aware of the choices we make in every moment.Whether you like it or not, everything that is happening at this moment is aresult of the choices youve made in the past. Unfortunately, a lot of us makechoices unconsciously, and therefore we dont think they are choices  and yet,they are. If I were to insult you, you would most likely make the choice ofbeing offended. If I were to pay you a compliment, you would most likely makethe choice of being pleased or flattered. But think about it: its still achoice.I could offend you and I could insult you, and you could make the choice of notbeing offended. I could pay you a compliment and you could make the choice ofnot letting that flatter you either.In other words, most of us  even though we are infinite choice-makers  havebecome bundles of conditioned reflexes that are constantly being triggered bypeople and circumstances into predictable outcomes of behaviour. Theseconditioned reflexes are like Pavlovian conditioning. Pavlov is famous fordemonstrating that if you give a dog something to eat every time you ring abell, soon the dog starts to salivate when you just ring the bell, because ithas associated one stimulus with the other.Most of us, as a result of conditioning, have repetitions and predictableresponses to the stimuli in our environment. Our reactions seem to beautomatically triggered by people and circumstances, and we forget that theseare still choices that we are making in every moment of our existence. We aresimply making these choices unconsciously. If you step back for a moment andwitness the choices you are making as you make those choices, then in just thisact of witnessing, you take the whole process from the unconscious 17The law of Carma or Cause and Effect¶realm into the conscious realm. This procedure of conscious choice-making andwitnessing is very empowering.When you make any choice  any choice at all  you can ask yourself two things:First of all, What are the consequences of this choice that Im making? Inyour heart you will immediately know what these are. Secondly, Will this choicethat Im making now bring happiness to me and to those around me? If the answeris yes, then go ahead with that choice. If the answer is no, if that choicebrings distress either to you or to those around you, then dont make thatchoice. Its as simple as that.There is only one choice, out of the infinity of choices available in everysecond, that will create happiness for you as well as for those around you. Andwhen you make that one choice, it will result in a form of behaviour that iscalled spontaneous right action. Spontaneous right action is the right action atthe right moment. Its the right response to every situation as it happens. Itsthe action that nourishes you and everyone else who is influenced by thataction. There is a very interesting mechanism that the universe has to help youmake spontaneously correct choices. The mechanism has to do with sensations inyour body. Your body experiences two kinds of sensations: one is a sensation ofcomfort, the other is a sensation of discomfort. At the moment you consciouslymake a choice, pay attention to your body and ask your body, If I make thischoice, what happens? If your body sends a message of comfort, thats the rightchoice. If your body sends a message of discomfort, then its not theappropriate choice.For some people the message of comfort and discomfort is in the area of thesolar plexus, but for most people its in the area of the heart. Consciously putyour attention in the heart and ask your heart what to do. Then wait for theresponse  a physical response in the form of a sensation. It may be the.faintest level of feeling  but its there, in your body. Only the heart knowsthe correct answer. Most people think the heart is mushy and sentimental. Butits not. The heart is intuitive; its holistic, its contextual, itsrelational. It doesnt have a win-lose orientation. It taps into the cosmiccomputer  the field of pure potentiality, pure knowledge, and infiniteorganizing power  and takes everything into account. At times it may not evenseem rational, but the heart has a computing ability that is far more accurateand far more precise than anything within the limits of rational thought. Youcan use the Law of Karma to create money and affluence, and the flow of all goodthings to you, any time you want. But first, you must become consciously awarethat your future is generated by the choices you are making in every moment ofyour life. If you do this on a regular basis, then you are making full use ofthe Law of Karma. The more you bring your choices into the level of yourconscious awareness, the more you will make those choices which arespontaneously correct  both for you and those around you. What about past karmaand how it is influencing you now? There are three things you can do about pastkarma. One is to pay your karmic debts. Most people choose to do that unconsciously, of course. This may be a choice you make, also. Sometimes theresa lot of suffering involved in the payment of those debts, but the Law of Karmasays no debt in the universe ever goes unpaid. There is a perfect accountingsystem in this universe, and everything is a constant to and fro exchange ofenergy.The second thing you can do is to transmute or transform your karma to a moredesirable experience. This is a very interesting process in which you askyourself, as youre paying your karmic debt, What can I learn from thisexperience? Why is this happening and what is the message that the universe isgiving to me? How can I make this experience useful to my fellow human beings?The Seven spiritual laws of Success¶18By doing this, you look for the seed of opportunity and then tie that seed ofopportunity with your dharma, with your purpose in life, which well talk aboutin the Seventh Spiritual Law of Success. This allows you to transmute the karmato a new expression. For example, if you break your leg while playing sports,you might ask, What can I learn from this experience? What is the message thatthe universe is giving me? Perhaps the message is that you need to slow downand be more careful or attentive to your body the next time. And if your dharmais to teach others what you know, then by asking, How can I make thisexperience useful to my fellow human beings? you may decide to share what youlearned by writing a book about playing sports safely. Or you may design aspecial shoe or leg support that prevents the kind of injury you experienced.This way, while paying your karmic debt, you will have also converted theadversity into a benefit that may bring you wealth and fulfillment. This is thetransmutation of your karma into a positive experience. You havent reallygotten rid of your karma, but you are able to take a karmic episode and create anew and positive karma out of it. The third way to deal with karma is totranscend it. To transcend karma is to become independent of it. The way totranscend karma is to keep experiencing the gap, the Self, the Spirit. Its likewashing a dirty piece of cloth in a stream of water. Every time you wash it, youtake away a few stains. You keep washing it again and again, and each time itgets a little cleaner. You wash or transcend the seeds of your karma by goinginto the gap and coming out again. This, of course, is done through the practiceof meditation. All actions are karmic episodes. Drinking a cup of coffee is akarmic episode. That action generates memory, and memory has the ability or thepotentiality to generate desire. And desire generates action again. Theoperational software of your soul is karma, memory, and desire. Your soul is abundle of consciousness that has the seeds of karma, memory, and desire. Bybecoming conscious of these seeds of manifestation, you become a consciousgenerator of reality. By becoming a conscious choice-maker, you begin togenerate actions that are evolutionary for you and for those that are aroundyou. And thats all you need to do. As long as karma is evolutionary  for boththe Self and everyone affected by the Self then the fruit of karma will be happiness and success.APPLYING THE LAW OF KARMA OR CAUSE AND EFFECTI will put the Law of Karma into effect by making a commitment to take thefollowing steps:(1) Today I will witness the choices I make in each moment. And in the merewitnessing of these choices, I will bring them to my conscious awareness. I willknow that the best way to prepare for any moment in the future is to be fullyconscious in the present. (2) Whenever I make a choice, I will ask myself twoquestions: What are the consequences of this choice that Im making? and Willthis choice bring fulfillment and happiness to me and also to those who areaffected by this choice?(3) I will then ask my heart for guidance and be guided by its message ofcomfort or discomfort. If the choice feels comfortable, I will plunge ahead withabandon. If the choice feels uncomfortable, I will pause and see theconsequences of my action with my inner vision. This guidance will enable me tomake spontaneously correct choices for myself and for all those around me.4The law of leasteffortThe Seven spiritual laws of Success¶20Nature 5 intelligence functions with effortlessease . . . with carefreeness, harmony, and love.And when we harness the forces of harmony,joy, and love, we create success and good fortunewith effortless ease.An integral being knows without going, seeswithout looking, and accomplishes without doing. Lao TZUThe fourth spiritual law of success is the Law of Least Effort. This law isbased on the fact that natures intelligence functions with effortless ease andabandoned careful ness. This is the principle of least action, of no resistance.This is, therefore, the principle of harmony and love. When we learn this lessonfrom nature, we easily fulfill our desires.If you observe nature at work, you will see that least effort is expended. Grassdoesnt try to grow, it just grows. Fish dont try to swim, they just swim.Flowers dont try to bloom, they bloom. Birds dont try to fly, they fly. Thisis their intrinsic nture. The earth doesnt try to spin on its own axis; it isthe nature of the earth to spin with dizzying speed and to hurtle through space.It is the nature of babies to be in bliss. It is the nature of the sun to shine.It is the nature of the stars to glitter and sparkle. And it is human nature tomake our dreams manifest into physical form, easily and effortlessly.In Vedic Science, the age-old philosophy of India, this principle is known asthe principle of economy of effort, or do less and accomplish more. Ultimatelyyou come to the state where you do nothing and accomplish everything. This meansthat there is just a faint idea, and then the manifestation of the idea comesabout effortlessly. What is commonly called a miracle is actually anexpression of the Law of Least Effort.Natures intelligence functions effortlessly, fric-tionlessly, spontaneously. Itis non-linear; it is intuitive, holistic, and nourishing. And when you are inharmony with nature, when you are established in the knowledge of your trueself, you can make use or the Law of Least Effort. Least effort is expended whenyour actions are motivated by love, because nature is held together by theenergy of love. When you seek power and control over other people, you wasteenergy. When you seek money or power for the sake of the ego, you spend energychasing the illusion of happiness instead of enjoying happiness in the moment.When you seek money for personal gain only, you cut off the flow of energy toyourself, and interfere with the expression of natures intelligence. But whenyour actions are motivated by love, there is no waste of energy. When youractions are motivated by love, your energy multiplies and accumulates and the surplus energy you gather and enjoy can be channeled to create anythingthat you want, including unlimited wealth.You can think of your physical body as a device for controlling energy: it cangenerate, store, and expend energy. If you know how to generate, store, andexpend energy in an efficient way, then you can create any amount of wealth.Attention to the ego consumes the greatest amount of energy. When your internalreference point is the ego, when you seek power and control over other people orseek approval from others, you spend energy in a wasteful way.When that energy is freed up, it can be rechanneled and used to create anythingthat you want. When your internal reference point is your spirit, when you areimmune to criticism and unfearful of any challenge, you can harness the power oflove, and use energy creatively for the experience of affluence and evolution.21The law of least effort¶In The Art of Dreaming, Don Juan tells Carlos Castaneda, . . . most of ourenergy goes into upholding our importance. ... If we were capable of losing someof that importance, two extraordinary things would happen to us: One, we wouldfree our energy from trying to maintain the illusory idea of our grandeur; andtwo, we would provide ourselves with enough energy to catch a glimpse or theactual grandeur of the universe.There are three components to the Law of Least Effort  three things you can doto put this principle of do less and accomplish more into action. The firstcomponent is acceptance. Acceptance simply means that you make a commitment:Today I will accept people, situations, circumstances, and events as theyoccur. This means I will know that this moment is as it should be, because thewhole universe is as it should be. This moment  the one youre experiencingright now  is the culmination of all the moments you have experienced in thepast. This moment is as it is because the entire universe is as it is. When youstruggle against this moment, youre actually struggling against the entireuniverse. Instead, you can make the decision that today you will not struggleagainst the whole universe by struggling against this moment. 1 his means thatyour acceptance of this moment is total and complete. You accept things as theyare, not as you wish they were in this moment. This is important to understand.You can wish for things in the future to be different, but in this moment youhave to accept things as they are.When you feel frustrated or upset by a person or a situation, remember that youare not reacting to the person or the situation, but to your feelings about theperson or the situation. These are your feelings, and your feelings are notsomeone elses fault. When you recognize and understand this completely, you areready to take responsibility for how you feel and to change it. And if you canaccept things as they are, you are ready to take responsibility for yoursituation and for all the events you see as problems.This leads us to the second component of the Law of Least Effort:responsibility. What does responsibility mean? Responsibility means not blaminganyone or anything for your situation, including yourself. Having accepted thiscircumstance, this event, this problem, responsibility then means the ability tohave a creative response to the situation as it is now. All problems contain theseeds of opportunity, and this awareness allows you to take the moment andtransform it to a better situation or thing.Once you do this, every so-called upsetting situation will become an opportunityfor the creation of something new and beautiful, and every so-called tormentoror tyrant will become your teacher. Reality is an interpretation. And if youchoose to interpret reality in this way, you will have many teachers around you,and many opportunities to evolve. Whenever confronted by a tyrant, tormentor,teacher, friend, or foe (they all mean the same thing) remind yourself, Thismoment is as it should be. Whatever relationships you have attracted in yourlife at this moment are precisely the ones you need in your life at this moment.There is a hidden meaning behind all events, and this hidden meaning is servingyour own evolution.The third component of the Law of Least Effort is defencelessness, which meansthat your awareness is established in defenselessness, and you have relinquishedthe need to convince or persuade others of your point of view. If you observepeople around you, youll see that they spend ninety-nine percent of their timedefending their points of view. If you just relinquish the need to defend yourpoint of view, you will in that relinquishment, gain access to enormous amountsof energy that have been previously wasted.When you become defensive, blame others, and do not accept and surrender to themoment, your life meets resistance. Any time you encounter resistance, recognizethat if you force the situation, the resistance will only increase. You dontwant to stand rigid like a tall oak that cracks and collapses in the storm.Instead, you want to be flexible, like a reed that bends with the storm andsurvives.Completely desist from defending your point of view. When you have no point todefend, you do not allow the birth of an argument. If you do this consistently if you stop fighting and The Seven spiritual laws of Success¶22resisting  you will fully experience the present, which is a gift. Someone oncetold me, The past is history, the future is a mystery, and this moment is agift. That is why this moment is called the present.If you embrace the present and become one with it, and merge with it, you willexperience a fire, a glow, a sparkle of ecstasy throbbing in every livingsentient being. As you begin to experience this exultation of spirit ineverything that is alive, as you become intimate with it, joy will be bornwithin you, and you will drop the terrible burdens and encumbrances ofdefensiveness, resentment, and hurtfulness. Only then will you becomelight-hearted, carefree, joyous, and free.In this joyful, simple freedom, you will know without any doubt in your heartthat what you want is available to you whenever you want it, because your wantwill be from the level of happiness, not from the level of anxiety or fear. Youdo not need to justify; simply declare your intent to yourself, and you willexperience fulfillment, delight, joy, freedom, and autonomy in every moment ofyour life.Make a commitment to follow the path of no resistance. This is the path throughwhich natures intelligence unfolds spontaneously, without friction or effort.When you have the exquisite combination of acceptance, responsibility, anddefenselessness, you will experience life flowing with effortless ease.When you remain open to all points of view  not rigidly attached to only one your dreams and desires will flow with natures desires. Then you can releaseyour intentions, without attachment, and just wait for the appropriate seasonfor your desires to blossom into reality. You can be sure that when the seasonis right, your desires will manifest. This is the Law of Least Effort.APPLYING THE LAW OF LEAST EFFORTI will put the Law of Least Effort into effect by making a commitment to takethe following steps:(1) I will practice Acceptance. Today I will accept people, situations,circumstances, and events as they occur. I will know that this moment is as itshould be, because the whole universe is as it should be. I will not struggleagainst the whole universe by struggling against this moment. My acceptance istotal and complete. I accept things as they are this moment, not as I wish theywere.(2) Having accepted things as they are, I will take Responsibility for mysituation and for all those events I see as problems. I know that takingresponsibility means not blaming anyone or anything for my situation (and thisincludes myself). I also know that every problem is an opportunity in disguise,and this alertness to opportunities allows me to take this moment and transformit into a greater benefit. (3) Today my awareness will remain established inDefenselessness. I will relinquish the need to defend my point of view. I willfeel no need to convince or persuade others to accept my point of view. I willremain open to all points of view and not be rigidly attached to any one ofthem.5THE LAW ofINTENTION andDESIREThe Seven spiritual laws of Success¶24Inherent in every intention and desire is themechanics for its fulfillment. . . intention and desire in the field of purepotentiality have infinite organizing power. And when we introduce an intentionin the fertile ground of pure potentiality, we put this infinite organiyng powerto work for us.In the beginning there was desire, which wasthe first seed of mind; sages, having meditated intheir hearts, have discovered by their wisdom theconnection of the existent with the non-existent. The Hymn of Creation, The Rig VedaThe fifth spiritual law of success is the Law of Intention and Desire. This lawis based on the fact that energy and information exist everywhere in nature. Infact, at the level of the quantum field, there is nothing other than energy andinformation. The quantum field is just another label for the field of pureconsciousness or pure potentiality. And this quantum field is influenced byintention and desire. Lets examine this process in detail. A flower, a rainbow,a tree, a blade of grass, a human body, when broken down to their essentialcomponents, are energy and information. The whole universe, in its essentialnature, is the movement of energy and information. The only difference betweenyou and a tree is the informational and energy content of your respectivebodies. On the material level, both you and the tree are made up of the samerecycled elements: mostly carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and other elementsin minute amounts. You could buy these elements in a hardware store for a coupleof dollars. The difference, therefore, between you and the tree is not thecarbon, or the hydrogen, or the oxygen. In fact; you and the tree are constantlyexchanging your carbon and oxygen with each other. The real difference betweenthe two of you is in the energy and in the information. In the scheme of nature,you and I are a privileged species. We have a nervous system that is capable ofbecoming aware of the energy and informational content of that localized fieldthat gives rise to our physical body. We experience this field subjectively asour own thoughts, feelings, emotions, desires, memories, instincts, drives, andbeliefs. This same field is experienced objectively as the physical body  andthrough the physical body, we experience this field as the world. But its allthe same stuff. That is why the ancient seers exclaimed, I am that, you arethat, all this is that, and thats all there is.Your body is not separate from the body of the universe, because at quantummechanical levels there are no well-defined edges. You are like a wiggle, awave, a fluctuation, a convolution, a whirlpool, a localized disturbance in thelarger quantum field. The larger quantum field the universe  is your extended body.Not only is the human nervous system capable of becoming aware of theinformation and energy of its own quantum field, but because human consciousnessis infinitely flexible through this wonderful nervous system, you are able toconsciously change the informational content that gives rise to your physicalbody. You can consciously change the energy and informational content or yourown quantum mechanical body, and therefore influence the energy and infor-25The law of Intention and Desire¶mational content of your extended body  your environment, your world  andcause things to manifest in it.This conscious change is brought about by the two qualities inherent inconsciousness: attention and intention. Attention energizes, and intentiontransforms. Whatever you put your attention on will grow stronger in your life.Whatever you take your attention away from will wither, disintegrate, anddisappear. Intention, on the other hand, triggers transformation of energy andinformation. Intention organizes its own fulfillment. The quality of intentionon the object of attention will orchestrate an infinity of space-time events tobring about the outcome intended, provided one follows the other spiritual lawsof success. This is because intention in the fertile ground of attention hasinfinite organizing power. Infinite organizing power means the power to organizean infinity of space-time events, all at the same time. We see the expression ofthis infinite organizing power in every blade of grass, in every apple blossom,in every cell of our body. We see it in everything that is alive. In the schemeof nature, everything correlates and connects with everything else. Thegroundhog comes out of the earth and you know it is going to be spring. Birdsbegin to migrate in a certain direction at a certain time of the year. Nature isa symphony. And that symphony is being silently orchestrated at the ultimateground of creation. The human body is another good example of this symphony. Asingle cell in the human body is doing about six trillion things per second, andit has to know what every other cell is doing at the same time. The human bodycan play music, kill germs, make a baby, recite poetry, and monitor the movementof stars all at the same time, because the field of infinite correlation is partof its information field.What is remarkable about the nervous system of the human species is that it cancommand this infinite organizing power through conscious intent. Intent in thehuman species is not fixed or locked into a rigid network of energy andinformation. It has infinite flexibility. In other words, as long as you do notviolate the other laws of nature, through your intent you can literally commandthe laws of nature to fulfill your dreams and desires. You can put the cosmiccomputer with its infinite organizing power to work for you. You can go to thatultimate ground of creation and introduce an intention, and just by introducingthe intention, you activate the field of infinite correlation. Intention laysthe groundwork for the effortless, spontaneous, frictionless flow of purepotentiality seeking expression from the unmanifest to the manifest. The onlycaution is that you use your intent for the benefit of mankind. This happensspontaneously when you are in alignment with The Seven Spiritual Laws ofSuccess.Intention is the real power behind desire. Intent alone is very powerful,because intent is desire without attachment to the outcome. Desire alone isweak, because desire in most people is attention with attachment. Intent isdesire with strict adherence to all the other laws, but particularly the Law ofDetachment, which is the Sixth Spiritual Law of Success. Intention combined withdetachment leads to life-centered, present-moment awareness. And when action isperformed in present-moment awareness, it is most effective. Your intent is forthe future, but your attention is in the present. As long as your attention isin the present, then your intent for the future will manifest, because thefuture is created in the present. You must accept the present as is. Accept thepresent and intend the future. The future is something you can always createthrough detached intention, but you should never struggle against the present.The Seven spiritual laws of Success¶26The past, present, and future are all properties of consciousness. The past isrecollection, memory; the future is anticipation; the present is awareness.Therefore time is the movement of thought. Both past and future are born in theimagination; only the present, which is awareness, is real and eternal. It is.It is the potentiality for space-time, matter, and energy. It is an eternalfield of possibilities experiencing itself as abstract forces, whether they belight, heat, electricity, magnetism, or gravity. These forces are neither in thepast nor in the future. They just are.Our interpretation of these abstract forces gives us the experience of concretephenomena and form. Remembered interpretations of abstract forces create theexperience of the past, anticipatory interpretations of the same abstract forcescreate the future. They are the qualities of attention in consciousness. Whenthese qualities are freed from the burden of the past, then action in thepresent becomes the fertile ground for the creation of the future. Intention,grounded in this detached freedom of the present, serves as the catalyst for theright mix of matter, energy, and space-time events to create whatever it is thatyou desire. If you have life-centered, present-moment awareness, then theimaginary obstacles which are more than ninety percent of perceived obstacles  disintegrate anddisappear. The remaining five to ten percent of perceived obstacles can betransmuted into opportunities through one-pointed intention.One-pointed intention is that quality of attention that is unbending in itsfixity of purpose. One-pointed intention means holding your attention to theintended outcome with such unbending purpose that you absolutely refuse to allowobstacles to consume and dissipate the focused quality of your attention. Thereis a total and complete exclusion of all obstacles from your consciousness. Youare able to maintain an unshakable serenity while being committed to your goalwith intense passion. This is the power of detached awareness and one-pointed,focused intention simultaneously.Learn to harness the power of intention, and you can create anything you desire.You can still get results through effort and through trying, but at a cost. Thecost is stress, heart attacks, and the compromised function of your immunesystem. It is much better to execute the following five steps in the Law ofIntention and Desire. When you follow these five steps for fulfilling yourdesires, intention generates its own power:(1) Slip into the gap. This means to center yourself in that silent spacebetween thoughts, to go into the silence  that level of Being which is youressential state. (2) Established in that state of Being, release your intentionsand desires. When you are actually in the gap, theres no thought, theres nointention, but as you come out of the gap  at that junction between the gap anda thought  you introduce the intention. If you have a series of goals, you canwrite them down, and have your intention focused on them before you go into thegap. If you want a successful career, for example, you go into the gap with thatintention, and the intention will already be there as a faint flicker in yourawareness. Releasing your intentions and desires in the gap means planting themin the fertile ground of pure potentiality, and expecting them to bloom when theseason is right. You do not want to dig up the seeds of your desires to see ifthey are growing, or get rigidly attached to the way in which they will unfold.You simply want to release them.(3) Remain in the state of self-referral. This means remain established in theawareness of your true Self  your spirit, your connection to the field of purepotentiality. It also 27The law of Intention and Desire¶means not to look at yourself through the eyes of the world, or allow yourselfto be influenced by the opinions and criticisms of others. A helpful way tomaintain that state of self-referral is to keep your desires to yourself; do notshare them with anyone else unless they share the exact same desires that youhave and are closely bonded with you.(4) Relinquish your attachment to the outcome. This means giving up your rigidattachment to a specific result and living in the wisdom of uncertainty. Itmeans enjoying every moment in the journey of your life, even if you dont knowthe outcome. (5) Let the universe handle the details. Your intentions anddesires, when released in the gap, have infinite organizing power. Trust thatinfinite organizing power of intention to orchestrate all the details for you.Remember that your true nature is one of pure spirit. Carry the consciousness ofyour spirit wherever you go, gently release your desires, and the universe willhandle the details for you.APPLYING THE LAW OF INTENTION AND DESIREI will put the Law of Intention and Desire into effect by making a commitment totake the following steps:(1) I will make a list of all my desires. I will carry this list with mewherever I go. I will look at this list before I go into my silence andmeditation. I will look at it before I go to sleep at night. I will look at itwhen I wake up in the morning. (2) I will release this list of my desires andsurrender it to the womb of creation, trusting that when things dont seem to gomy way, there is a reason, and that the cosmic plan has designs for me muchgrander than even those that I have conceived. (3) I will remind myself topractice present-moment awareness in all my actions. I will refuse to allowobstacles to consume and dissipate the quality of my attention in the presentmoment. I will accept the present as it is, and manifest the future through mydeepest, most cherished intentions and desires.6THE LAW ofDETACHMENT29The law of pure Detachment¶In detachment lies the wisdom of uncertainty,in the wisdom of uncertainty lies the freedom fromour past, from the known, which is the prison ofpast conditioning.And in our willingness to step into the unknown,the field of all possibilities, we surrender ourselves to the creative mind thatorchestrates the dance of theuniverse.Like two golden birds perched on the selfsametree, intimate friends, the ego and the Self dwell inthe same body. The former eats the sweet and sourfruits of the tree of life, while the latter looks on in detachment. The Mundaka UpanishadThe sixth spiritual law of success is the Law of Detachment. The Law ofDetachment says that in order to acquire anything in the physical universe, youhave to relinquish your attachment to it. This doesnt mean you give up theintention to create your desire. You dont give up the intention, and you dontgive up the desire. You give up your attachment to the result.This a very powerful thing to do. The moment you relinquish your attachment tothe result, combining one-pointed intention with detachment at the same time,you will have that which you desire. Anything you want can be acquired throughdetachment, because detachment is based on the unquestioning belief in the powerof your true Self. Attachment, on the other hand, is based on fear andinsecurity  and the need for security is based on not knowing the true Self.The source of wealth, of abundance, or of anything in the physical world is theSelf; it is the consciousness that knows how to fulfill every need. Everythingelse is a symbol: cars, houses, bank notes, clothes, airplanes. Symbols aretransitory; they come and go. Chasing symbols is like settling for the mapinstead of the territory. It creates anxiety; it ends up making you feel hollowand empty inside, because you exchange your Self for the symbols of your Self.Attachment comes from poverty consciousness, because attachment is always tosymbols. Detachment is synonymous with wealth consciousness, because withdetachment there is freedom to create. Only from detached involvement can onehave joy and laughter. Then the symbols of wealth are created spontaneously andeffortlessly. Without detachment we are prisoners of helplessness, hopelessness,mundane needs, trivial concerns, quiet desperation, and seriousness  thedistinctive features of everyday mediocre existence and povertyconsciousness.True wealth consciousness is the ability to have anything youwant, anytime you want, and with least effort. To be grounded in this experienceyou have to be grounded in the wisdom of uncertainty. In this uncertainty youwill find the freedom to create anything you want. People are constantly seekingsecurity, and you will find that seeking security is actually a very ephemeralthing. Even attachment to money is a sign of insecurity. You might say, When Ihave X million dollars, then Ill be secure. Then Ill be financiallyindependent and I will retire. Then I will do all the things I really want todo. But it never happens  never happens. The Seven spiritual laws of Success¶30Those who seek security chase it for a lifetime without ever finding it. itremains elusive and ephemeral, because security can never come from money alone.Attachment to money will always create insecurity no matter how much money youhave in the bank. In fact, some of the people who have the most money are themost insecure.The search for security is an illusion. In ancient wisdom traditions, thesolution to this whole dilemma lies in the wisdom of insecurity, or the wisdomof uncertainty. This means that the search for security and certainty isactually an attachment to the known. And whats the known? The known is ourpast. The known is nothing other than the prison of past conditioning. Theresno evolution in that  absolutely none at all. And when there is no evolution,there is stagnation, entropy, disorder, and decay.Uncertainty, on the other hand, is the fertile ground of pure creativity andfreedom. Uncertainty means stepping into the unknown in every moment of ourexistence. The unknown is the field of all possibilities, ever fresh, ever new,always open to the creation ot new manifestations. Without uncertainty and theunknown, life is just the stale repetition of outworn memories. You become thevictim of the past, and your tormentor today is your self left over fromyesterday. Relinquish your attachment to the known, step into the unknown, andyou will step into the field of all possibilities. In your willingness to stepinto the unknown, you will have the wisdom of uncertainty factored in. Thismeans that in every moment of your life, you will have excitement, adventure,mystery. You will experience the fun of life  the magic, the celebration, theexhilaration, and the exultation of your own spirit.Every day you can look for the excitement of what may occur in the field of allpossibilities. When you experience uncertainty, you are on the right path  sodont give it up. You dont need to have a complete and rigid idea of whatyoull be doing next week or next year, because if you have a very clear idea ofwhats going to happen and you get rigidly attached to it, then you shut out awhole range of possibilities.One characteristic of the field of all possibilities is infinite correlation.The field can orchestrate an infinity of space-time events to bring about theoutcome that is intended. But when you are attached, your intention gets lockedinto a rigid mindset and you lose the fluidity, the creativity, and thespontaneity inherent in the field. When you get attached, you freeze your desirefrom that infinite fluidity and flexibility into a rigid framework whichinterferes with the whole process of creation.The Law of Detachment does not interfere with the Law of Intention and Desire with goal-setting. You still have the intention of going in a certain direction,you still have a goal. However, between point A and point B there are infinitepossibilities. With uncertainty factored in, you might change direction in anymoment if you find a higher ideal, or if you find something more exciting. Youare also less likely to force solutions on problems, which enables you to stayalert to opportunities.The Law of Detachment accelerates the whole process of evolution. When youunderstand this law, you dont feel compelled to force solutions. When you forcesolutions on problems, you only create new problems. But when you put yourattention on the uncertainty, and you witness the uncertainty while youexpectantly wait for the solution to emerge out of the chaos and the confusion,then what emerges is something very fabulous and exciting. This state ofalertness  your preparedness in the present, in the field of uncertainty meets with your goal and your intention and allows you to seize the opportunity.Whats the opportunity? Its contained within every problem that you have inyour life. Every single problem that you have in your life is the seed of anopportunity for some greater benefit. Once you 31The law of Detachment¶have that perception, you open up to a whole range of possibilities  and thiskeeps the mystery, the wonder, the excitement, the adventure alive. You can lookat every problem you have in your life as an opportunity for some greaterbenefit. You can stay alert to opportunities by being grounded in the wisdom ofuncertainty. When your preparedness meets opportunity, the solution willspontaneously appear. What comes out of that is often called good luck. Goodluck is nothing but preparedness and opportunity coming together. When the twoare mixed together with an alert witnessing of the chaos, a solution emergesthat will be of evolutionary benefit to you and to all those that you come intocontact with. This is the perfect recipe for success, and it is based on the Lawof Detachment.APPLYING THE LAW OF DETACHMENTI will put the Law of Detachment into effect by making a commitment to take thefollowing steps:(1) Today I will commit myself to detachment. 1 will allowmyself and those around me the freedom to be as they are. I will not rigidlyimpose my idea of how things should be. I will not force solutions on problems,thereby creating new problems. I will participate in everything with detachedinvolvement.(2) Today I will factor in uncertainty as an essential ingredient of myexperience. In my willingness to accept uncertainty, solutions willspontaneously emerge out of the problem, out of the confusion, disorder, andchaos. The more uncertain things seem to be, the more secure I will feel,because uncertainty is my path to freedom. Through the wisdom of uncertainty, Iwill find my security.(3) I will step into the field of all possibilities and anticipate theexcitement that can occur when I remain open to an infinity of choices. When Istep into the field of all possibilities, I will experience all the fun,adventure, magic, and mystery of life. 7The law ofdharma orpurpose in life33The law of Dharme or purpose in life¶Everyone has a purpose in life ... a unique giftor special talent to give to others.And when we blend this unique talent with service to others, we experience theecstasy and exultation of our own spirit, which is the ultimate goal of allgoals.When you work you are a flute through whoseheart the whispering of the hours turns to music.And what is it to work with love. It is to weave thecloth with threads drawn from your heart, even as ifyour beloved were to wear that cloth. . . . Kahlil Gibran, The ProphetThe seventh spiritual law of success is the Law of Dharma. Dharma is a Sanskritword that means purpose in life. The Law of Dharma says that we have takenmanifes tation in physical form to fulfill a purpose. The field of purepotentiality is divinity in its essence, and the divine takes human form tofulfill a purpose. According to this law, you have a unique talent and a uniqueway of expressing it. There is something that you can do better than anyone elsein the whole world  and for every unique talent and unique expression of thattalent, there are also unique needs. When these needs are matched with thecreative expression of your talent, that is the spark that creates affluence.Expressing your talents to fulfill needs creates unlimited wealth and abundance.If you could start children right from the beginning with this thought, youdsee the effect it has on their lives. In fact, I did this with my own children.Again and again, I told them there was a reason why they were here, and they hadto find out what that reason was for themselves. From the age of four years,they heard this. I also taught them to meditate when they were about the sameage, and I told them, I never, ever want you to worry about making a living. Ifyoure unable to make a living when you grow up, Ill provide for you, so dontworry about that. I dont want you to focus on doing well in school. I dontwant you to focus on getting the best grades or going to the best colleges. WhatI really want you to focus on is asking yourself how you can serve humanity, andasking yourself what your unique talents are. Because you have a unique talentthat no one else has, and you have a special way of expressing that talent, andno one else has it. They ended up going to the best schools, getting the bestgrades, and even in college, they are unique in that they are financiallyself-sufficient, because they are focused on what they are here to give. Thisthen, is the Law of Dharma. There are three components to the Law of Dharma. Thefirst component says that each of us is here to discover our true Self, to findout on our own that our true Self is spiritual, that essentially we arespiritual beings that have taken manifestation in physical form. Were not humanbeings that have occasional spiritual experiences  its the other way around:were spiritual beings that have occasional human experiences. Each of us ishere to discover our higher self or our spiritual self. Thats the firstfulfillment of the Law of Dharma. We must find out for ourself that inside us isa god or goddess in embryo that wants to be born so that we can express ourdivinity. The second component of the Law of Dharma is to express our uniquetalents. The Law of Dharma says that every human being has a unique talent. Youhave a talent that is unique in its The Seven spiritual laws of Success¶34expression, so unique that theres no one else alive on this planet that hasthat talent, or that expression of that talent. This means that theres onething you can do, and one way of doing it, that is better than anyone else onthis entire planet. When youre doing that one thing, you lose track of time.When youre expressing that one unique talent that you possess  or more thanone unique talent in many cases  the expression of that talent takes you intotimeless awareness.The third component of the Law of Dharma is service to humanity  to serve yourfellow human beings and to ask yourself the questions, How can I help? How canI help all those that I come into contact with? When you combine the ability toexpress your unique talent with service to humanity, then you make full use ofthe Law of Dharma. And coupled with the experience of your own spirituality, thefield of pure potentiality, there is no way you will not have access tounlimited abundance, because that is the real way abundance is achieved. This isnot a temporary abundance; its permanent, because of your unique talent, yourway of expressing it, and your service and dedication to your fellow humanbeings, which you discover through asking the question, How can I help?instead of Whats in it for me?The question, Whats in it for me? is the internal dialogue of the ego. AskingHow can I help? is the internal dialogue of the spirit. The spirit is thatdomain of your awareness where you experience your universality. In justshifting your internal dialogue from Whats in it for me? to How can I help?you automatically go beyond the ego into the domain of your spirit. Whilemeditation is the most useful way of entering the domain of spirit, simplyshifting your internal dialogue to How can I help? will also access thespirit, that domain of your awareness where you experience your universality.If you want to make maximum use of the Law of Dharma, then you have to makeseveral commitments.The first commitment is: I am going to seek my higher self, which is beyond myego, through spiritual practice.The second commitment is: I am going to discover my unique talents, and findingmy unique talents, I am going to enjoy myself, because the process of enjoymentoccurs when I go into timeless awareness. Thats when I am in a state of bliss.The third commitment is: I am going to ask myself how I am best suited to servehumanity. I am going to answer that question and then put it into practice. I amgoing to use my unique talents to serve the needs of my fellow human beings  Iwill match those needs to my desire to help and serve others.Sit down and make a list of the answers to these two questions: Ask yourself, ifmoney was no concern and you had all the time and money in the world, what wouldyou do? If you would still do what you currently do, then you are in dharma,because you have passion for what you do  you are expressing your uniquetalents. Then ask yourself: How am I best suited to serve humanity? Answer thatquestion, and put it into practice. Discover your divinity, find your uniquetalent, serve humanity with it, and you can generate all the wealth that youwant. When your creative expressions match the needs of your fellow humans, thenwealth will spontaneously flow from the unmanifest into the manifest, from therealm of the spirit to the world of form. You will begin to experience your lifeas a miraculous expression of divinity  not just occasionally, but all thetime. And you will know true joy and the true meaning of success  the ecstasyand exultation of your own spirit. 35The law of purpose ¶APPLYING THE LAW OF DHARMA OR PURPOSE IN LIFEI will put the Law ofDharma into effect by making a commitment to take thefollowing steps:(1) Today I will lovingly nurture the god or goddess in embryothat lies deep within my soul. I will pay attention to the spirit within me thatanimates both my body and my mind. I will awaken myself to this deep stillnesswithin my heart. I will carry the consciousness of timeless, eternal Being inthe midst of time-bound experience. (2) I will make a list of my unique talents.Then I will list all the things that I love to do while expressing my uniquetalents. When 1 express my unique talents and use them in the service ofhumanity, I lose track of time and create abundance in my life as well as in thelives of others.(3) I will ask myself daily, How can I serve? and How can I help? Theanswers to these questions will allow me to help and serve my fellow humanbeings with love.SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONI want to know Gods thoughts...the rest are details. Albert EinsteinThe universal mind choreographs everything that is happening in billions ofgalaxies with elegant precision and unfaltering intelligence. Its intelligenceis ultimate and supreme, and it permeates every fiber of existence: from thesmallest to the largest, from the atom to the cosmos. Everything that is aliveis an expression of this intelligence. And this intelligence operates throughThe Seven Spiritual Laws. If you look at any cell in the human body, you willsee through its functioning the expression of these laws. Every cell, whetherits a stomach cell, or a heart cell, or a brain cell, has its birth in the Lawof Pure Potentiality. DNA is a perfect example of pure potentiality; in fact, itis the material expression of pure potentiality. The same DNA existing in everycell expresses itself in different ways in order to fulfill the uniquerequirements of that particular cell. Each cell also operates through the Law ofGiving. A cell is alive and healthy when it is in a state of balance andequilibrium. This state of equilibrium is one of fulfillment and harmony, but itis maintained by a constant give and take. Each cell gives to and supports everyother cell, and in turn is nourished by every other cell. The cell is always ina state of dynamic flow and the flow is never interrupted. In fact, the flow isthe very essence of the life of the cell. And only by maintaining this flow ofgiving is the cell able to receive and thus continue its vibrant existence. TheLaw of Karma is exquisitely executed by every cell, because built into itsintelligence is the most appropriate and precisely correct response to everysituation as it occurs. The Law of Least Effort is also exquisitely executed byevery cell in the body: it does its job with quiet efficiency in the state ofrestful alertness. The Seven spiritual laws of Success¶36Through the Law of Intention and Desire, every intention of every cell harnessesthe infinite organizing power of natures intelligence. Even a simple intentionsuch as metabolizing a molecule of sugar immediately sets off a symphony ofevents in the body where precise amounts of hormones have to be secreted atprecise moments to convert this molecule of sugar into pure creative energy.Of course, every cell expresses the Law of Detachment. It is detached from theoutcome of its intentions. It doesnt stumble or falter because its behaviour isa function of life-centered, present-moment awareness.Each cell also expresses the Law of Dharma. Each cell must discover its ownsource, the higher self; it must serve its fellow beings, and express its uniquetalents. Heart cells, stomach cells, and immune cells all have their source inthe higher self, the field of pure potentiality. And because they are directlylinked to this cosmic computer, they can express their unique talents witheffortless ease and timeless awareness. Only by expressing their unique talentscan they maintain both their own integrity and the integrity of the whole body.The internal dialogue of every cell in the human body is, How can I help? Theheart cells want to help the immune cells, the immune cells want to help thestomach and lung cells, and the brain cells are listening to and helping everyother cell. Every cell in the human body has only one function: to help everyother cell.By looking at the behaviour of the cells of our own body, we can observe themost extraordinary and efficient expression of The Seven Spiritual Laws. This isthe genius of natures intelligence. These are the thoughts of God  the restare details. The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success are powerful principles thatwill enable you to attain self-mastery. If you put your attention on these lawsand practice the steps outlined in this book, you will see that you can manifestanything you want  all the affluence, money, and success that you desire. Youwill also see that your life becomes more joyful and abundant in every way, forthese laws are also the spiritual laws of life that make living worthwhile.There is a natural sequence for the application of these laws in your daily lifethat may help you to remember them. The Law of Pure Potentiality is experiencedthrough silence, through meditation, through non-judgment, through communionwith nature, but it is activated by the Law of Giving. The principle here is tolearn to give that which you seek. Thats how you activate the Law of PurePotentiality. If you seek affluence, give affluence; if you seek money, givemoney; if you seek love, appreciation, and affection, then learn to give love,appreciation, and affection.Through your actions in the Law of Giving you activate the Law of Karma. Youcreate good karma, and good karma makes everything in life easy. You notice thatyou dont have to expend a lot of effort to fulfill your desires, whichautomatically leads to an understanding of the Law of Least Effort. Wheneverything is easy and effortless, and your desires keep getting fulfilled, youspontaneously begin to understand the Law of Intention and Desire. Fulfillingyour desires with effortless ease makes it easy for you to practice the Law ofDetachment. Finally, as you begin to understand all the above laws, you begin tofocus on your true purpose in life, which leads to the Law of Dharma. Throughthe use of this law, by expressing your unique talents and fulfilling the needsof your fellow humans, you begin to create whatever you want, whenever you wantit. You become carefree and joyful, and your life becomes an expression ofunbounded love.We are travellers on a cosmic journey  star-dust, swirling and dancing in theeddies and whirlpools of infinity. Life is eternal. But the expressions of lifeare ephemeral, momentary, 37The law of purpose ¶transient. Gautama Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, once said, This existence ofours is as transient as autumn clouds. To watch the birth and death of beings islike looking at the movements of a dance. A lifetime is like a flash oflightning in the sky, Rushing by like a torrent down a steep mountain.We have stopped for a moment to encounter each other, to meet, to love, toshare. This is a precious moment, but it is transient. It is a littleparenthesis in eternity. If we share with caring, lightheart-edness, and love,we will create abundance and joy for each other. And then this moment will havebeen worthwhile.* * *Deepak Chopra is a world-renowned leader in the field of mind-body medicine andhuman potential.
