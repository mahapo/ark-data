Since the beginning of humanity we havesought explanations of how life emerges from inanimate elements. Despite theunraveling of the genetic code, life remains as much a mystery now as in ancienttimes.The perennial wisdom traditions tell us that archetypal gods and goddessesbrought us forth in their image so that we could re-create and honor them in ourimage. Science ponders the organizing principles that seduce atoms intomolecules, molecules into complex biochemicals, and biochemicals intoself-replicating systems. Do life-forms exist to reproduce DNA molecules or doDNA molecules exist to reproduce life-forms? Whether you see the universe aspersonal or impersonal, from a spiritual or a scientific perspective, you haveto marvel at the animating vital force that orchestrates the creation of allliving beings.The universe is re-created in every individual life. Birth and death are merelyparentheses in the never-ending story of creation. Each human birth holds thepromise of adventure, drama, love, and loss. In the process of creation, theuniversal ocean of love temporarily flows in rivers of individuality seekingtheir return to the source. Your baby’s conception and birth are the first pagesof a new tale—the first steps on her path through this world of infinitepossibilities.Our book, Magical Beginnings, Enchanted Lives, is a celebration of birth—anexultation of each flower of individuality that blooms on the tree of life. Themagic and the mystery of life’s creative process enable each individual and eachnew generation to recapitulate the entire history of life while seeking ever-newexpressions. As your baby takes her first breath and the umbilical cord is cut,she becomes an individual. She separates from your body and formally begins herjourney of self-discovery. Intuition and research clearly show us that longbefore your baby is launched through the birth canal, she has begun exploringher own personhood.Your baby’s sense of self-awareness dawns early as she grows inside your waterywomb. As soon as her sensory awareness develops, she perceives and responds tosubtle sounds, sensations, sights, tastes, and smells from inside your body.Your interpretations of the world filter through your body to your unborn baby.She readily learns to associate her experiences with feelings and emotions andhas pleasures and discomforts of her own. For nine months while your baby islinked to you as her mother ship, she is continually tapping into your databaseof the world. Your baby learns to associate sensory impulses with feelings andidentifies those that bring nourishment and those that feel toxic. Life learningclearly begins before birth.This book is designed for pregnant women, their partners, women who wish tobecome pregnant, and for anyone who wants to participate in the wondrous processof bringing new life into this world. We have also sought to include informationfor people whose work addresses the common childhood problems of modernlife—teachers, counselors, therapists, and health providers will find this bookinvaluable. This is not simply a book about fetal health, for we believe thatthe knowledge provided can improve the health of society at large. Thesuffering, depression, and crime that surround us each day are strong statementsabout a loss of balance between body, mind, and spirit. This loss often startsat the very beginning of a life before birth. The tendency toward a balancedstate of health and wholeness and the tendency to lose this intrinsic butdelicate balance are both present in seed form at the moment of conception.The book has been incubating in our hearts and minds for many years. In caringfor people at the Chopra Center with a wide range of imbalances and illnesses,we have learned that experiences are metabolized into biology. We can heal ourbodies by making different choices. Many of our patients and guests express thewish that they had received guidance on living a balanced life as children.Through extensive research we became aware that developing human beings learnabout life and the world even while in the womb, and the choices made by theirparents have lasting effects. To put this knowledge into practice, we developedthe Magical Beginnings birth education program and have trained prenataleducators around the world. Our experience in teaching Magical Beginnings topregnant couples at the Chopra Center has convinced us that the principles andpractices presented in this book can profoundly enhance the experience ofpregnancy and birth for both the parents and the baby.Experiences long before birth affect and mold personality. A baby can show thesigns of stress even before he or she is born. Feelings and desires are shapedby our intrauterine experiences. Science has demonstrated that every wisp ofexperience is metabolized into the substance of our minds and bodies, bothbefore and after we are born into this world. Nourishing experiences fromconception through life are transformed into healthy bodies and healthy minds,while toxic experiences create unhealthy ones.Health is not the mere absence of disease; it is a state of physical,psychological, emotional, and spiritual well-being. We can even go further anddefine health as a higher state of consciousness, in which we recognize that thesame field of intelligence that underlies our life underlies every living being.In a true state of health, we become incapable of hurting others or ourselves.To achieve this state it is important that we feel loved, nourished, secure,contented, and happy, right from the beginning. From the moment of conception,the unborn baby experiences the thoughts and actions of her mother. This isbecause mind and body are inseparably one. Wherever a thought goes, a moleculefollows. The impulses in our minds are instantly translated into a palette ofneurochemicals. These chemicals communicate with cells and tissues throughoutour body. The unborn baby is a part of her mother’s body. Therefore, a mother’sthoughts, emotions, and feelings translate into molecules that enter into thebody of her fetus.You and your baby are continuously sharing each other’s molecules andexperiences. This dynamic exchange of information and these chemical messengersare the codes of communication between your heart and mind and the heart andmind of your unborn baby. The start of a rich emotional life begins as early asconception. The choices that you make as a mother are key to providing the bestbeginning, and your expanded awareness is the key to making the best choices. Inthis book, we hope to bring into the awareness of all parents the understandingthat their choices, interpretations, and experiences before, during, and afterpregnancy play an essential role in the development of healthy and happychildren. By making nourishing choices, you can ensure that your baby isreceiving the basic elements to create a healthy body, mind, and spirit.In this book we regularly refer to the profound insights of the ancient wisdomsciences of Ayurveda. This five-thousand-year-old system of natural medicinewith its origins in ancient India reminds us that human beings are, in essence,spiritual. Acknowledging this, we can begin to grasp the sacred responsibilityof conceiving, carrying, and caring for our children. We also bring to lightremarkable information from modern science that clearly tells us that experienceand learning begin well before we take our first breath. The integration ofthese two different perspectives gives us the tools to ensure that our childrenare nourished by our thoughts, words, and actions. We are spiritual beings whohave learned to manufacture physical forms. Although for the span of a lifetimewe disguise ourselves as individual people, our essential nature remains that ofunbounded consciousness . . . of pure potentiality . . . of Spirit. When youinvite a soul into your life by conceiving a baby, you are assuming a sacredtrust to love and nourish a divine impulse that is manifesting humanity. We areall expressions of that same unified field of existence, so creating a child isultimately creating another statement of ourselves. The love and caring that wegive to our children is an extension of the nurturing we give to ourselves. Ifwe aim to create a nonviolent world, we must begin with love and nourishment inthe womb.Our world is complex and dynamic. At any one moment, we can point to situationsand circumstance that give rise to great hope or great despair. There areregions on this planet where creativity, abundance, and spirituality areblooming and other spots where poverty, violence, and suffering are pervasive.Whatever the situation, we can be certain that all hope for the future residesin how we nurture our children. We have inherited everything we know from thosewho have preceded us and we have a choice as to what we pass along to the nextgeneration. If we unconsciously perpetuate in our children the conflicts andmisunderstandings that we inherited, we will have missed an opportunity tochange the world. If, on the other hand, we expand our awareness to embracecompassion, unity, and love, we can genuinely reshape this world. The latterwill ensure that our children will know themselves as the glorious, spiritualbeings they are.As loving parents, we all have one essential desire for our children: we wishfor them to be happy. Recognizing this, we offer this guide to consciousparenting. We invite you to share our hope that all children will be blessedwith enchanted lives—and we bring you this book in hopes of helping to create ahealthier, more loving world.Personalizing This BookEvery journey has the potential to take you beyond the limits of your mind to adeep place within your heart. As you travel through this book you will encountermany exercises designed to support your personal growth. Chapters includejournaling, drawing, and visualization exercises designed to be playfulopportunities for self-discovery. We believe that pregnancy can be a time ofprofound spiritual awakening as you listen deeply to the intuitive wisdomavailable in both your mind and body.Journaling Your PregnancyWhen the mind is clearYou can see all the wayTo the heart.—STEVEN LEVINEWe suggest that you take some time every day of your pregnancy to jot down a fewparagraphs about how you feel. Even on days when you believe you have nothing tosay, take a few moments to write down your thoughts. Some women create aspecific time each day to write, while others carry a journal with them, writingwhen they feel inspired. Let your journal be a truthful expression of yourexperiences. You might be inspired to draw pictures or doodle in your journal.Remain open to what comes to you.Journaling will help you gain insights into your thoughts and feelings.Listening to your inner dialogue, you will connect to your baby and to deeperplaces inside you. Journaling can aid you in becoming more present in life. Fartoo often people look outside themselves to discover who they are, seeking outteachers, lectures, and workshops for the answers to the questions about howthey are supposed to feel. Through journaling, you can tap into the flow ofinner wisdom, insights, and answers that are accessible deep in your own being.As you attend to yourself in this way, you will be more conscious of your unbornbaby’s development and witness yourself blossoming as a parent.Here’s an example of a journal entry of a woman five months pregnant with herfirst child:My Dear Angel,You have been kicking and playing all day today inside my belly. Each kickbrings my awareness to you. Throughout the day I close my eyes and give you allof my attention. I feel deeply connected to you already—it is hard to describeexactly how. It feels like I am thinking, imagining, feeling, connecting, andexperiencing telepathy with you all in one. It is really an amazing feeling.My belly is getting bigger each day. I love it when I look at my naked body inthe mirror. Your dad looks at me in complete delight, which makes me feelsensual and womanly.Your father is going to be such a great dad. You are going to love him. He drewa picture of you, himself, and me yesterday. We all have the biggest smiles andyou are in the middle. Around us he wrote words describing all the differentfeelings we have had over the past few months. It describes the excitement ofyou coming and our worries about such a big change. It is a great picture. I amgoing to frame it and hang it in your room.I love you,MomListening is a form of accepting.—STELLA TERRILL MANNClose your eyes and pay attention to how it feels to have a baby growing in yourbody. Become aware of your joys, concerns, and fears. Write them down withoutholding back. Don’t worry about your spelling or grammar. Enjoy yourself! Lightsome incense or diffuse an aroma. Put on some favorite music. You may discoverfeelings that you haven’t acknowledged before. Some of these feelings may evensurprise you. Be open to and write about whatever comes to you.Insight Through DrawingCreating images and drawings to express your feelings and experiences can alsobe a powerful way to access your inner self. Pictures can bypass verbal languageto directly reveal inner thoughts and emotions about your pregnancy, birth, andunborn baby. Although it is not uncommon for people to resist engaging indrawing, we encourage you simply to try the process. As a child you may haveshut down drawing as a means for creative expression because you weren’t astalented as you may have wanted to be, but drawing is an amazing avenue forpersonal growth. Give yourself permission not to be perfect. Allow yourcreativity to be expressed through your hands. Let yourself be wild and free.Find the childlike space inside you that loves to color and draw. Take out yourcrayons, chalk, paints, and clay. Release your inner critic and let yourselfplay. Obtain a journal or notebook to write and draw in. Find one that willallow you to be free and spontaneous. Keep some pens, colored pencils, andmarkers handy. As insights emerge and your creative forces flow, jot down thethoughts and images that come to mind.Creative ImaginationWhen people’s eyes are openThey see landscapes in the outer world.When people’s eyes are closed,They see landscapes with their mind’s eye.People spend hours looking at outer landscapes,But there is just as much to seeIn inner landscapes.—MICHAEL AND NANCY SAMUELSCreative imagination is the process of invoking sensory experiences on thescreen of your consciousness. Creative-imagination exercises offered throughoutthis book will enable you to connect deeply with your own body and your unbornbaby. They can also help reduce stress during your pregnancy.Each of us has inner experiences that are not visible from the outside; images,thoughts, and memories float through our awareness throughout the day. Althoughwe usually refer to this process as visualization, any of the five senses may beinvolved. You may conjure up sounds, sensations, tastes, and smells in additionto visual images. When asked to remember your childhood home, for example, youmight recall the shape of your piano, the soft texture of your favorite pillow,or the delicious flavors and fragrances of your mother’s cooking. Entire scenesmay come to life as you recall a particular circumstance or event. Your body andmind react to internal experiences much the way they react to external ones.Abundant psychological research demonstrates that your autonomic nervous system,which is responsible for regulating involuntary physiological functions, such asheart rate, blood pressure, hormone levels, and immune function, reacts toimaginary or recalled events just as if they were occurring in the actual worldof forms and phenomena. If you vividly imagine relaxing at the beach, your bodyreleases the same chemical messengers that are produced when you are actuallyenjoying a day at the shore. If you intensely recall an upsetting event, yourheart rate, blood pressure, respiration, and metabolic processes respond as ifyou were encountering that stressful circumstance in real time. Using creativeimagination, you can choose the happier event, accessing your inherent creativepower to invoke healing, centering, and relaxation.We believe in the power of imagination. Throughout this book we will invite youto exercise that talent, and like any skill, it will improve as you practice it.We may invite you to envision your baby growing inside your body or have yougenerate an image of how you’d like to see yourself in labor. Through creativeimagination you will enhance your connection with your unborn baby long beforeshe is in your arms. As you use your imagination, you will discover that youhave the ability to create just about anything you want.Pregnancy is a path that will take you beyond your mind and body. It willenliven your compassion and reveal the most intimate truths of your soul. Thisbook is about discovering your heart and finding your path. Each step along theway is unique to you. Enjoy the journey.We’ll begin at the beginning of life—when two cells fuse and the spark that’sgenerated ignites the fire of a new being."},{"pageContent":"image [images/Chop_9780307237330_epub_049_r1.jpg]Creating a BabyThe body of a woman who is to conceiveIs being chosen as a channelFor the expression of divinity into materiality.Although ovulation is a law of nature,Conception is a law of God.—EDGAR CAYCEimage [images/Chop_9780307237330_epub_101_r1.jpg]When does life begin? Some spiritual traditions see the origin of life as themoment a soul intends to enter into human form. Others see the beginning as asparkle in the eye of a potential parent who wants to have a child. Whilebiologists and religious clergy may argue about whether or not life starts atthe moment of conception, convention has it that the day a baby emerges from hismother’s womb marks the beginning of life. However you define life’s origin, thesacred journey of an egg and sperm merging to create a unique individual is asmarvelous and miraculous as the creation of the universe itself. Spirit andmolecules intertwine to manifest a new life.The blueprint for a human body is encoded in every cell of a human being, whichcontains forty-six chromosomes and more than thirty thousand genes. These genes,composed of DNA, provide blueprints for the proteins that ultimately form thechemicals, tissues, and organs of a person. They are responsible for the textureof your baby’s hair, the color of his skin, and to some degree, the uniquecharacteristics of his personality. With the unraveling of the human genome, weare closer than ever to understanding how DNA influences both physical andpsychological traits, as well as our predisposition to illnesses. Still, we area long way from fully unraveling the mystery of how a few genetic words can codefor the unfathomable biological diversity on this planet.In every human being, half of the forty-six chromosomes are contributed by themother through her egg and half by the father through his sperm. The merging andreshuffling of the genetic potential of Mother with that of Father gives rise tothe amazing variety of life. According to Ayurveda, these primordial cells,known as shukra, are the essence of biological intelligence, and the mostimportant products of a living being.When a young woman first begins menstruating, her ovaries contain tens ofthousands of potential eggs. Each month, from the time menstruation begins untilmenopause, a number of her eggs begin the process of development, but usuallyjust one fully ripens and is released. Over the course of a woman’s reproductiveyears, only about four hundred eggs reach maturity and have the chance todevelop into a human baby.The egg or ovum is the largest cell in a woman’s body and is about 100,000 timesheavier than a sperm. It carries enough nourishment to sustain itself from thetime it is released until it is implanted in the lining of the womb. Thisusually takes about five days, if along the way, the egg is fertilized.Sperm cells, which carry the father’s genetic material, are generated in a man’stestes beginning in puberty and continuing throughout his life. Millions of newsperm cells are created each day, the vast majority of which are never released.During ejaculation, about three hundred million tiny sperm are released in avolume of about a teaspoon of seminal fluid. Only about three million sperm passthrough the vagina into the uterus, most of which become lost or exhausted, sothat less than three hundred enter into the fallopian tube where a ripe egg iswaiting.For sperm, the 12 inches from the cervix to the egg is longer than a marathonand takes about ten hours to navigate. In most cases, fertilization occursshortly after an egg enters the fallopian tube on its way to the uterus. Spermcells that choose the correct tube reach the egg, encircle it, and attachthemselves to its outer layer. The final competitors release the powerfuldigestive enzymes contained in their caps, which carve microscopic openingsthrough the egg’s external coat. Only a single sperm is allowed to penetrate theegg, which then instantly closes its gates to all other contenders. Thevictorious sperm sheds its tail and head while its genes align with those of theegg. The runner-up sperm, with their heads in the outer layer of the egg,continue waving their tails. This has the effect of rotating the now fertilizedegg, freeing it to move toward the womb. The egg and sperm, once comprisingtheir individual energy and intelligence, entwine to embark on life’s journey asa new entity—the seed of a unique human being.Over the next four to six days, the fertilized egg floats down the fallopiantube. Along the way it divides several times, taking on the appearance of amulberry. Some of the outer cells prepare to form the placenta, while the innercells begin the differentiation process that ultimately results in your baby. Bythe time the little bundle reaches the uterus, the original fertilized egg cell,now known as a blastocyst, has already expanded to a collection of about ahundred cells.image [images/Chop_9780307237330_epub_022_r1.jpg]While this multiplication is occurring, the inner lining of your womb preparesfor implantation. Hormones produced by your ovary stimulate the glands and bloodvessels of the inner uterus to become soft and succulent. When the blastocystarrives, its outer layers are able to snuggle into the lush inner lining of theuterus. This begins the process of the embryonic baby tapping into Mother tonourish his body, mind, and soul. As many parents discover, it is not uncommonfor this process to continue for decades to follow.According to Ayurveda, an ember of consciousness is present in every livingcell. As your new baby begins to take physical form, sparks of consciousness inthe individual cells unite with each other, igniting self-awareness within theunborn child. This flame of awareness, known in Ayurveda as Agni, becomesbrighter as the level of biological sophistication rises. The fire is fanned bythe essential vital force, known as Prana, while the essence of biologicalintegrity, Ojas, organizes the developing cells into a cohesive unified system.On a spiritual level these three primordial forces—Agni, Prana, and Ojas (orfire, breath, and earth)—are the essential building blocks of life. Theseelemental energies fuel one’s brilliance, vitality, and love. The passion forlife inherent in the soul of your baby begins to be expressed at the moment ofconception, or perhaps, even before.Why does life arise? According to Ayurveda, universal intelligence gives rise tolife simply so it can evolve into complex expressions, capable of pondering andappreciating the mysteries of the universe. From this perspective, life is acosmic masquerade, in which the goal is to uncover who is concealed. At thebeginning of life, the disguise is quite transparent to the conscious mother whorecognizes the deep spiritual connection that unites her baby’s soul with herown. Her most important role from the moment of conception is to nurture herchild so he can rediscover his essential spiritual nature.In some traditions, this connection is believed to precede conception.In certain African tribes, people believe that the spiritual birth of a childbegins when his potential mother first imagines him. She goes to a silent placeand listens for the baby’s special song. When she hears it, she returns to herhome and teaches it to her mate. While making love, they chant the song as aninvitation for this soul to enter into their lives. Once pregnant, she regularlysings the song to her unborn baby and teaches it to the midwives in preparationfor her birth. They sing the song while the woman is in labor and as the baby isborn into the world. The child learns the theme song, which supports him throughall the stages of his life. He uses his song to celebrate his moments of gloryand comfort him in times of loss.Growing a BabyBy the time the blastocyst finds its nest in the luxuriant lining of the womb,some of its cells are producing an important chemical called human chorionicgonadotropin or hCG. This substance stimulates the ovary to produce progesteroneand estrogen, which nourish the womb until the placenta is able to make enoughof these chemicals on its own. Levels of hCG are detectable in the blood of apregnant woman as early as eight days after conception, and almost everypregnant woman has measurable levels by the eleventh day. Testing for thischemical is the basis of both urine and blood pregnancy tests. A level below 5in the blood is considered negative, whereas a level above 25 is positive. HCGlevels may rise to a peak of 250,000 between the eighth and tenth weeks and thengradually fall as you enter your second trimester of pregnancy.We can only marvel at the intelligence that underlies the development of acomplex human being from a cluster of apparently identical cells. Where are thelaws written that govern this dance of life? They are written in the experiencesof millions of years of evolutionary time. We can describe what happens, can setup the conditions by which it occurs through in vitro fertilization or cloning,but we cannot fully understand how each cell knows which genes to awaken andwhich are to be left dormant. We cannot explain how flawless mirror images ofeyes, ears, arms, and legs are formed in perfect synchrony. We cannot explainhow different parts of the nervous system “know” to reach out to each otheracross vast cellular distances to transmit critical information. Theorchestration of life occurs from a deeper domain of existence, which ismysterious and incomprehensible. Every living being truly has a magicalbeginning.Primordial PerceptionContinuous cellular activity marks the first month of pregnancy, setting thestage for the development of your baby’s tissues, organs, and physiologicalsystems. As early as the fifth week after conception, the basic components ofhis nervous system are established, including a primitive brain, a spinal cord,and the sensory equipment for hearing, touching, seeing, tasting, and smelling.The anatomy needed to perceive and interpret the world forms rapidly once a newlife comes into being.HEARING IN THE WOMBThe acoustic system that enables your baby to hear develops through threedifferent components—the outer ear, the middle ear, and the inner ear. The outerear begins as little buds that gradually fuse to create your baby’ssound-collecting dish. The middle ear is formed by linking up three tiny bonesthat transmit vibrations received by the outer ear to your baby’s inner ear. Theinner ear is a remarkable apparatus that translates the pitch and intensity ofsound waves into specific electrical impulses, which then communicate thisinformation to the hearing region of the brain. The equipment for your unbornbaby to eavesdrop on the world is well developed by the time you enter yoursecond trimester of pregnancy.One of the earliest accounts of intrauterine hearing is described in the NewTestament (Luke 1:44) when John’s mother, Elizabeth, tells Mary, who is pregnantwith Jesus, “The infant in my womb leaped for joy the moment I heard the voiceof your greeting!” A number of modern studies have confirmed that by eighteen totwenty weeks of fetal life, your unborn child hears and responds to sounds inhis environment. Although you might expect the womb to be a quiet place, it isactually quite rich in sounds and sensations. Tiny microphones placed within apregnant uterus reveal that a multitude of audible vibrations enters your unbornbaby’s sanctum. Mother’s heartbeat and digestive tract offer steady backgroundnoise, along with the pulsing rush of blood flowing through her major vessels.The rhythm and pitch of human voices are clearly perceptible in the womb. Anadult listening to conversations recorded through a miniature microphone placedin a womb can understand over half of the words spoken by a man and over a thirdof the words spoken by a woman standing in front of the pregnant woman. To yourunborn baby, it is your voice that is most easily recognized. Unlike outsidesounds, which are muffled to some degree, the voice of Mother is actuallyslightly amplified. If you are singing, the sound in your womb can reach morethan 80 decibels, which is as loud as a ringing telephone or vacuum cleaner.Your fetus hears your voice both as an airborne sound and as vibrations thatmove directly through your organs, tissues, and bones. An unborn child becomesfamiliar with his mother’s voice long before he emerges from the womb.A baby learns to associate sounds in the womb with sensations of comfort ordiscomfort. The emotional state of his mother is communicated to the fetusthrough the molecules that she secretes. If Mother is engaged in a loving,nurturing conversation or listening to enjoyable music, her brain triggers therelease of chemicals that reflect her calm, comfortable condition. Thesechemical messengers travel through the maternal and fetal circulations, nowconnected by the umbilical cord, entraining the unborn baby’s feelings withthose of Mother. If, on the other hand, Mother is involved in a heated argument,her body pulses with stress chemicals that can trigger discomfort in her fetus.It’s easy to imagine the distress of an unborn baby regularly exposed to toxicsounds. His mother’s heart races while her adrenal glands squirt out stresshormones. The unborn baby activates his own fight-or-flight response, butunfortunately can neither run from nor wrestle with the source of itsprovocation. The seeds of anxiety, apprehension, and hostility are sown inutero. The baby-to-be learns to associate sounds with inner sensations.Do your best to avoid recurrent distressing sounds, since noise pollution has anegative effect on both Mother and Baby. Scientists report that mothers livingalong the flight path of a busy urban airport produce lower levels ofgrowth-promoting hormones and are more likely to have smaller babies than thoseliving an equal distance from the airport but not directly under the flightpath. Similar findings have been reported in women who must work in factorieswhere there is a constantly high noise level. To the extent that you canconsciously choose, do your best to limit your exposure and that of your unbornbaby to vibrations that distress.On the other hand, it is not realistic to expect that you’ll be able tocompletely avoid upsetting noises throughout your entire pregnancy. We are notsuggesting you should worry about causing harm to your unborn baby anytime youget upset, have a disagreement, or listen to loud rock and roll music. Lifeinevitably brings loud moments that cannot nor necessarily should be avoided. Wesimply encourage you to be aware that the being inside of you is eavesdroppingon your life. Whenever possible, expose yourself to nourishing rather than toxicsounds, knowing that whatever you are experiencing is simultaneously experiencedby your unborn child.FEELING IN THE WOMBWe feel our way in this world through two different interrelated systems. Wehave a somesthetic system that conveys information about touch, pressure,temperature, and pain, and we have a vestibular system that informs us how weare positioned in space. The basic anatomic architecture to perceive the worldthrough the sense of touch is well formed by the time your unborn baby is aboutfifteen weeks old. A wide variety of sensory receptors develops in your baby’sskin and joints, which tells his brain the texture, intensity, position, andtemperature of anything he is touching or is touching him.The vestibular or balance system helps us maintain the right position inrelationship to our surroundings. Living on a planet with gravity requires us toknow which way is up at all times. Although a human infant may not situnsupported until six months of age, and it might be more than a year until heis standing and walking without help, the balance system required for thesecrucial functions is already developing by fourteen weeks of fetal life.Babies in the womb respond to the sense of touch. During the fifth month a fetuscan be seen touching his own face and sucking his thumb and fingers. Pressurethrough external massage leads to changes in fetal activity and heart rate, andby six months in the womb the unborn baby is as responsive to touch as aone-year-old baby. Unborn babies are also able to perceive changes intemperature and to feel pain. Injecting cold water into the amniotic fluid leadsto withdrawal movements. If during an amniocentesis procedure the unborn baby ispricked with a needle, he reacts in ways suggesting he can perceive discomfortand does not appreciate the painful intrusion.There is evidence that during the fifth month of fetal life your baby begins toorient himself in space. Studies have shown that unborn babies adjust themselvesinto more comfortable positions in the womb by kicking. The baby changes hisposition when the mother changes hers, and with abrupt maternal movements,sudden fetal motor responses and alterations in heart rate can be detected.These postural adjustments to normal maternal activity help the fetal navigationsystem develop in preparation for life outside the womb. Your own consciousmovement through dance or yoga encourages healthy neuronal connections betweenthe limbs, trunk, and brain of your growing baby.Although we cannot say for certain that your unborn baby derives pleasure fromyour belly being massaged or stretching your back during yoga poses, we do knowthat when you are feeling comfortable, your fetus is bathed in the comfortingchemicals that your body produces. Moving with awareness benefits both you andyour unborn baby.SEEING IN THE WOMBThe womb is a pretty dark place, yet some light does filter through. Theearliest evidence of a visual system appears by one month of gestation, and bythe end of the first trimester, your unborn baby’s eyes have all their essentialcomponents. The visual system continues to develop in complexity throughoutpregnancy and beyond, since an infant’s ability to process visual information isnot complete until several months after birth.The eyelids of a fetus begin to open at about twenty weeks of gestation, andthere is pretty good evidence that between 2 percent and 10 percent of visualoutside light is able to reach the rudimentary eyes of a fetus. When brightlights are shined onto a pregnant woman’s belly, the unborn baby will show anincrease in motor activity and acceleration in heart rate. An indirect but moreimportant role of visual stimulation on your unborn child is played by what youare looking at. Violent images served up by the media stimulate your body’sstress response, which is communicated to your baby. Beautiful, pleasing imagescreate physiological changes that are rejuvenating and balancing. Again, we arenot suggesting that you walk around with blinders on but do encourage you to geta dose of nourishing images on a regular basis.TASTING IN THE WOMBYour baby’s taste buds are present as early as twelve weeks of fetal life andare well developed by early in the second trimester. They are initially foundthroughout his mouth, but eventually become concentrated on his tongue andpalate. Taste buds are connected to nerve fibers by the twelfth week and arefunctioning by the fifteenth week.Studies have suggested that an unborn baby will increase or decrease hisswallowing based upon the flavors present in the amniotic fluid, and it looks asthough even unborn babies like sweets. Intrauterine studies have shown that ifsweetened solutions are introduced into the amniotic fluid, babies swallow more,whereas when bitter substances are injected, babies swallow less. Your unbornchild also has the ability to distinguish sour and salty flavors. From veryearly on we have the ability to distinguish good-tasting substances from badones.As we’ll explore later in this book, the best way to ensure that you arereceiving optimal nourishment is to be certain that your diet includes the sixprimary tastes on a daily basis. Your unborn child is not only nourished by whatyou eat, but may actually be capable of tasting what you taste.SMELLING IN THE WOMBAs adults, we perceive the fragrance of the world through tiny specializedreceptors in our nasal passages that sample the air for odor-rich molecules. Thecellular apparatus for perceiving aromas appears as early as the fourth week offetal life and is well developed by halfway through pregnancy. The obviousquestion is, “Is there anything for your baby to smell?” and the answer is yes.Amniotic fluid naturally contains a large assortment of fragrant substances,which vary from day to day depending upon what you ingest. Premature babiesreact to a variety of scents, and fetal mammals of many species respond toaromatic chemicals infused into amniotic fluid. Certain spices such as curry andgarlic seep into the amniotic fluid, and at birth some babies will smell like aspice from food the mother has eaten the night before.Babies remember smells and tastes they are exposed to in the womb. Studies haveshown that newborn mammals, from rodents to humans, show preferences forsubstances with fragrances they experienced before birth. Baby rats preferbeverages containing apple juice if they were exposed to the flavor of appleswhile in the womb. Newborn human infants favor the smell of their own amnioticfluid for several days after birth. After birth, if a newborn baby is given thechoice of suckling on her mother’s unwashed breast, which secretes a smellsimilar to the smell of amniotic fluid, or on a breast that has been washed,more than 75 percent of the time the newborn will choose the breast with thefamiliar amniotic smell. As is true for all the other senses, your olfactoryexperiences during pregnancy become your baby’s experiences. As we’ll explore indetail in Chapter 2, you can use this understanding to enhance both your baby’sand your own well-being.The Gifts of PregnancyPregnancy is a precious opportunity to be mindful and reflective. With awarenessyou can tune into your inner state, becoming more conscious to yourself, to yourunborn baby, and to each moment of your life. Take time to sit and listendeeply, and you will begin to notice the subtle ways you and your unborn childreact to the choices you are making. By tuning into your own sensoryexperiences, you will find yourself slowing down naturally and becoming morepresent. You will gain clarity in your life and experience more inner peace.This will have a profound impact on your unborn baby’s first experiences of theworld.ExerciseSit or lie down, and allow your eyes to close. Taking in a few slow, deepbreaths, bring awareness into your body. Look around inside. Feel and envisionthe space. Notice the shades, subtle colors, and textures within you. Feel yourbreath as it moves through you. Sense its vibration and begin to listen to itssound. For the next several breaths follow the sound. Let it take you deeperinside yourself. Feel your heartbeat and the pulsation of life within you. Witheach in-breath, allow the tenderness of your heart to surround your baby. Witheach out-breath, create an image of your baby growing inside your body. Breathein tenderness; breathe out a clearer vision of your baby. Own your part increating this little being. Breathe in joy for the miracle occurring in yourbody; as you breathe out, feel your love for this new being developing withinyou.The Journey into LifeWe’ve been emphasizing the development of your baby’s sensory systems, becauseit’s so important to change our notion of unborn children from being isolated,unresponsive clusters of cells to primordial sentient beings influenced by thesounds, sensations, sights, tastes, and smells in their environment. Since yourbaby has limited ability to influence his experiences, it becomes yourresponsibility to choose those that provide maximal nourishment and minimaltoxicity. Your choices provide the raw materials that enable your baby’s soul tocreate its body, senses, and mind.The sequential development of your baby’s body is an expression of nature’ssynchronous intelligence. The development of the right side of the body does nottrigger the development of the left side; rather, the simultaneous emergence ofsymmetrical components is orchestrated by an underlying intelligence. Thisintelligence is beyond cause and effect, beyond time and space, and beyondbeginnings and endings. Whether you call this force nature, spirit, or God, itsability to bring forth form out of formlessness is magical and miraculous.Let’s review some milestones that mark this extraordinary journey from afertilized egg to a complete newborn human being:Days 1 to 14 The time between the first day of your last menstrual period andthe day of ovulation.End of week 2 Father’s sperm fertilizes mother’s egg in the fallopian tube.Week 3 The fertilized egg divides several times and implants in the lining ofthe uterus.Week 4 The embryo differentiates into three different layers:An outer layer—destined to become your baby’s skin, nervous system, hair, andnailsA middle layer—destined to become your baby’s muscles, bones, heart, and bloodvesselsAn inner layer—destined to become your baby’s digestive tract and urinary systemThe embryo receives nourishment and oxygen from the placenta through theumbilical cord. Everything the embryo and fetus require until birth will travelback and forth through this cord. The placenta, although capable of filteringmany substances from your body, is not able to filter them all. Many drugs andtoxins can still pass through the placental barrier and enter your baby’s body.Week 6 Your baby’s primitive heart is beating, although the embryo is less than1⁄4 inch long. Primitive eyes, arms, and legs are present.Week 8 The embryo now becomes known as a fetus, which in Latin means “youngone.” He weighs less than half an ounce. The digestive tract is forming andblood is carrying oxygen and nourishment to cells through his primitivecirculatory system.Week 10 The fetus is about 1 inch long, with recognizable eyes, ears, fingers,and toes. Internal organs are functioning, and his brain is growing at anincredible rate of 250,000 new cells every minute!Week 12 Your unborn baby’s face looks very human, with a tiny nose and chin. Heis over 3 inches long and weighs about 2 ounces. The fetus can flex and extendhis fingers. Sexual differentiation is now apparent.Week 16 Fine hair (lanugo) is developing on his head. Your baby is activelymoving and making sucking motions with his mouth. His bones are becoming harderand muscles are developing.Week 20 Tiny nails appear on your baby’s fingers and toes. His entire body iscovered with fine hair. Mother can feel fetal movements, called quickening. Thefetal heartbeat can be heard with a stethoscope. Your baby is about 8 inches inlength.Week 24 Your baby now weighs over 1 pound, and is just under a foot in length.His eyebrows and eyelashes are well formed. The fine air sacs in the lungs arealmost functional.Week 28 Although immature, your baby’s lungs are developed to the point thatsurvival is possible outside the womb. His eyelids open and close. His weight isover 21⁄2 pounds and he may be 15 inches long.Week 32 Your baby’s bones are well developed but still soft. Rhythmic breathingmovements are present. The nervous system is steadily developing and your babyis learning to regulate his body temperature. Body fat is accumulating.Week 36 The fetus is between 16 and 19 inches long and weighs about 6 pounds. Ifborn prematurely at this stage, there is a high likelihood of survival.Weeks 38 to 40 Your baby is considered full term, and is ready to begin his lifeoutside of the womb.The Miracle of CreationNature creates within you an entire person complete with all his parts in justforty weeks. Throughout pregnancy your body is your unborn baby’s universe. Youare the rivers, sunlight, earth, atmosphere, and sky for this being growingwithin you. Your baby’s body, mind, and soul are intimately intertwined withyour own. Together you express the creative flow of life.In each moment, your unborn baby is immersed in the sounds and vibrations ofyour heartbeat and breath. He feels your stress, tension, and fear along withyour joy, happiness, and peace. Whenever you move, laugh, cry, eat, eliminate,or rest, your unborn baby responds. The potential of your child’s life isencoded in each of his cells, while the environment of your body can eithernurture or disturb this growth. Accept this responsibility with joy, for eachhealthy choice that you make on behalf of your unborn baby nourishes you aswell. Your pregnancy can be a magical beginning for both you and your baby.ExerciseSit comfortably and allow your eyes to close. Feel yourself gently inhaling andexhaling. Allow your awareness to be inside your body. As you inhale, feel thenourishment and oxygen that you bring in, from the universe, from the source. Asyou feel this air filling your body, notice how it moves into your soft belly.Feel how it encircles your baby. Receive the sensations and nourishment in eachbreath. Now exhale and release this air, allowing it to flow back out into theuniverse. Continue breathing like this for the next few minutes. Breathe in,filling your belly; breathe out, releasing to the universe—each breathnourishing you and your baby.Now bring your awareness to the space around your womb. Imagine yourselfdrifting through your uterine wall and amniotic sac and begin to feel yourselffloating inside your womb. Imagine submerging deeper into the amniotic fluid andfeel yourself floating here with your baby. Feel how soft and silky this fluidis and notice that it is just the right temperature for your baby. As your eyeswander through the space and semidarkness inside your womb—take in a breath—feelwhat it is like to be inside your body. These are the sensations your baby isexperiencing as he grows inside you.Look around the inner surfaces of your womb and find where the placenta isattached to your uterine wall. Take a moment to honor this organ that iscontinuously nourishing your baby. Feel how it is helping to keep him alive. Asyou continue to look around, see if you can find the umbilical cord, which isattached to the placenta. This is your baby’s lifeline. Let your awareness flowdown along this cord until you can see where it is connected to your baby’sbelly. See your baby here now—alive and growing inside your body. Feel yourselfright here next to him. Take a few moments to feel this amazing little being—whois metamorphosing inside your belly. Feel how incredible it is to have a littleperson transforming and growing inside you. You are the entire universe for yourbaby. Experience yourself as his mother—notice how you are protecting him as hedevelops and grows. Look at his little body. See his fingers and his toes, hisarms and legs, his tiny torso and head. Take a few moments to gaze at hisface—and imagine what it will be like to look into his eyes for the first time.Imagine how it will feel to hold him in your arms. Become aware of your bodyholding him right now inside the warm nest of your womb.Whenever you feel ready, gently bring your awareness back to your breath. Feelyour breath moving in and out of your body. Notice your belly rising and fallingwith each breath. Become aware of the sensation of the air in the room floatingaround you. Begin to move your body any way that feels good. As you feel ready,slowly open your eyes.Take a few minutes to note in your journal how it feels to have a baby growinginside your body. See if you can conjure up a picture of your baby and take sometime to draw this image.Enliven Through Your Attention• Place your hands on your belly a few times throughout the day and sendloving thoughts to your unborn baby.• Journal each day about your experiences.• Early in your pregnancy, plant a tree or flowering bush to symbolizethe growth of your baby in the womb. After your baby is born, you can take careof the plant together.image [images/Chop_9780307237330_epub_012_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"image [images/Chop_9780307237330_epub_050_r1.jpg]Womb EcologyOh mighty one, the ancient inscrutable, without name or form,Disguised as Brahman, Abraham, the Primordial One,You come to us as the gift of a child.Salutations, salutations to you a million times,For manifesting Yourself in every grain of creation.—DEEPAK CHOPRAimage [images/Chop_9780307237330_epub_101_r1.jpg]There is an expression in Ayurveda that says, “What you see you become.” In theWest we have the phrase, “You are what you eat.” Although these sayings comefrom different cultures, they are, in essence, both saying the same thing. Ourexperiences shape us. Whether you are hearing, feeling, seeing, tasting, orsmelling, your experiences in each moment mold who you are. Your body and mindare created from your accumulated experiences.Ayurveda suggests that if you want to understand your past, examine your bodynow. We can carry that further. If you wish to predict what your body will belike in the future, consider your experiences now. Each impulse of experience isbeing metabolized into the molecules of your body. Although it may be obviousthat the food you eat becomes the matter of your body, it is equally true thatthe sounds you hear, the sensations you feel, the sights you see, and the aromasyou smell are transformed into the physical molecules that make up your body.Your body is a field of living information and intelligence.In recent years neurobiologists have provided us scientific explanations forthis process. Through advanced technology, including brain-mapping studies andpositron-emission tomography (PET) scans, we now know that every sensoryperception and its associated emotional reaction leads to changes in theelectricity and chemistry of your physiology. Your sensory experiences haveeither life-supporting or life-damaging effects on your mind and body. Evenimaginary experiences can have potent physiological effects. Try this simpleexercise:Imagine hearing a shrieking ambulance go by.Imagine listening to a Bach violin concerto.Imagine being stung by a bee.Imagine holding a baby in your arms.Imagine witnessing an automobile accident.Imagine watching a dramatic sunset.Imagine tasting a bitter medicine.Imagine biting into a juicy, sweet mango.Imagine the smell of a skunk.Imagine the aroma of a Hawaiian flower.Each of these sensations, pleasurable or uncomfortable, imaginary or real,changes your body. When sensory stimulation is soothing, your body releaseshealth-promoting chemicals. When it is toxic or negative, stress hormones arereleased. These various chemicals have the ability to nourish or deplete yourbody. Your nervous system plays a key role in this process. It is an amazingapparatus that identifies, filters, interprets, and responds to the energy andinformation you receive through your senses. When you hear the howl of a newbornbaby, your brain processes the raw sensory data, labels it as a cry, interpretsit as a statement of distress, and activates a response. Theseneurophysiological changes affect every cell of your being. Yourinterpretations, emotions, and feelings are encoded into chemical messengersthat filter through your body.Your thoughts and words are literally made into flesh. When you feel stressed,you release chemicals coded for stress, and every cell in your body receives themessage. When you feel joyful, your body produces natural pleasure chemicalscalled endorphins and encephalins. When you are peaceful and relaxed, yourelease chemicals similar to prescription tranquilizers. Your body is anexpression of your experiences.Throughout pregnancy your unborn baby’s cells are also being informed of yourexperiences and your sensations. As we discussed in the last chapter, theenvironment in your womb is rich with sounds and sensations, and yourimpressions of the world continually filter through to your baby. Your unbornchild is a resilient and adaptable little being, more aware, responsive, andinteractive with her environment than scientists previously imagined. In theabsence of too much stress from your body, your baby’s nervous system workssmoothly. When you’re calm and centered, your baby is able to grow peacefully,in tune with her own biological rhythms.Adrenaline, noradrenaline, oxytocin, serotonin, and most other messengermolecules are transported across the placenta and influence your unborn baby.These chemicals generate a cascade of responses in your body, and in the body ofyour unborn child.Studies using ultrasound monitoring have shown that within moments after apregnant woman experiences a stressful event that generates anxiety, her unbornbaby responds by accelerating her heart rate or kicking strongly.Awareness is the key factor in helping you create a nurturing environment foryour baby. Rather than running on automatic pilot, use the opportunity providedby your pregnancy to become mindful of your environment and the effects it hason you and your baby. Learn to nurture yourself by seeking out experiences thatare nourishing and avoiding those that are toxic. You can do so by consciouslypromoting balance in your body through each of your five senses.ExerciseStop for a moment and focus on the sights around you. Notice the colors, thesize, and the shapes of objects within your environment. Observe the textures ofeach object you perceive. Close your eyes and become aware of the soundssurrounding you right now. Listen deeply to each one. Become aware of thesensations of touch that are stimulating your skin at this moment. Feel theclothing on your body and the pressure of your feet against the ground. Gentlystroke your arm and notice the sensations that your touch creates in your body.Take a deep breath and smell the aromas in the air. Lick your lips and taste theflavors and sensations in your mouth. Notice how by paying attention you haveenlivened each of your five senses.Awakening Your Inner Pharmacy Through the Five Windows to Your SoulIn ancient India a senior class of Ayurvedic medical students was given a finalassignment to find things that had no therapeutic value. Only one student,Jivaka, returned empty-handed, saying that anything he put his attention oninfluenced his mind and body. The sounds of birds singing, the sensations of thebreeze on his face, watching the sunset, tasting an herb, smelling a fragrantflower—each of these experiences had a therapeutic effect on him and, therefore,could be considered a form of medicine. Jivaka was declared valedictorian of hisclass and went on to become the personal physician to the Buddha.Nourish Your Baby and Yourself Through SoundThe sounds that surround you play an important role in balancing your biologicalrhythms. Nourishing sounds are as important to your health as nourishing food.The German philosopher Martin Heidegger said, “Thinking is a subtle form ofhearing.” We hear the thoughts we think, and when they are powerful enough, wefeel them as well. Thoughts that we feel are called emotions. Think of the wordmother. First you hear the thought as a sound. Then, almost immediately, you’llfind that you can feel the emotion that the word mother generates inside you.Now if you close your eyes and imagine the word mother again, you will be ableto conjure up an image associated with the word mother in your mind. Sounds havethe ability to bring forth sensations from all five of your senses. Think of theword lemon. As you conjure up the sour fruit in your awareness, you may begin tosalivate as the word evokes the object it names. Thought becomes form, the wordis made flesh.Make a commitment to provide your unborn baby with a healthy dose of nourishingsounds on a regular basis. Take time to listen to music that inspires you.Although the significance of the “Mozart effect,” which suggests that listeningto classical music would make your baby more intelligent, is debatable, there isplenty of information that supports the view that music can soothe your body,mind, and soul. Studies have shown that listening to pleasing sounds can lowerblood pressure, enhance immunity, and reduce anxiety.Create your own cache of musical remedies. According to Ayurveda, there arethree primary ways you can lose balance. First, excessive turbulence in yourmind can lead to anxiety and insomnia. This is known as a Vata, or Wind,imbalance. Second, you can become overheated with feelings of irritation,frustration, and anger. This is referred to as a Pitta, or Fire, imbalance.Finally, you can become sluggish and stagnant, resulting in lethargy andfatigue, known in Ayurveda as a Kapha, or Earth, imbalance. You can use music tobalance any of these situations. If you are feeling anxious or having troublesleeping at night due to a turbulent mind, listen to music that is gentle andcalming. If you are feeling irritable and ill-tempered, introduce music that issoothing and cooling. If you are feeling congested and listless, try listeningto music that is invigorating and revitalizing. Play these sounds when you’rerelaxing, taking a bath, or getting massaged. Listening to your favoriteselections at other times will trigger the memory of these relaxing experiences,which will be of benefit to you throughout your pregnancy and during labor. Someof our favorite musical selections are suggested below.The sounds of nature also have a balancing effect on your mind and body and canhelp reconnect you to your essential state of peacefulness. Go for walks whereyou are exposed to those sounds that remind you of the timeless intelligencethat underlies all of creation, including the creation of your unborn child. Payattention to the breezes rustling the leaves, the ocean waves lapping up againstthe shore, the rushing of water in a stream, a waterfall cascading in the woods,and the songs of birds warbling on a warm summer day. Take time to listen to thenatural vibrations that surround you.Play an active role in your unborn child’s acoustic experience, making aconscious commitment to choose nurturing auditory stimuli for you and yourfetus. Ask your husband or partner to participate in the process. Have him readpoetry or tell stories to you and your baby-to-be. Studies have shown thatnewborn babies, whose fathers spoke to them while in the womb, respond to theirdad’s soothing voice within the first few hours after birth.The unborn baby begins to show behavioral responses to outside sound at aboutsixteen weeks and appears to be listening much of the day by twenty-four weeks,when the structures of the ear are fully formed.Create a nickname or term of endearment for your unborn child and speak to heroften. Recite love poems, read inspiring stories, and sing lullabies to yourbaby. Try listening to sounds that traditionally have been used to rejoice inspirit, such as Gregorian, Vedic, Hebrew, Native American, Celtic, or Hawaiianchants.Remind yourself on a daily basis to stop and listen to the sounds in yourenvironment and notice how you feel. Your unborn baby is also interacting, bothdirectly and indirectly, with the sounds around you. When you generate coherenceand comfort in your body through sound, you create a loving and nurturingenvironment for your unborn baby.Suggested Music During PregnancyVATACALMING, RELAXINGMagic of Healing — VataBruce & Brian Becvar Angel LoveAeoliah Collaborationsinto the MomentSteven Halpren & Master Charles Om Mani Padme HumMaster CharlesPITTASOOTHING, COOLINGMagic of Healing — PittaBruce & Brian Becvar Inner FluteFlute for the SpiritBamboo WaterfallWind Chimes and Bells WaterworksEnyaKAPHAINVIGORATING, ENERGIZINGMagic of Healing — KaphaBruce & Brian Becvar The EssenceDeva Premal Live onEarthKrishna Das The RisingBruce SpringsteenThe soothing sound of your voice can have a profoundly nourishing influence onher. She loves to listen to the voice of your partner as well. At birth yourbaby will recognize both your voices.Nurture Your Baby and Yourself Through TouchThe skin is your largest sense organ and it is rich with health-promotingpotential. Its surface contains thousands of nerve receptors that transmithealing impulses to your body and mind. Through the sensations of touch you canuse your skin to access this healing benefit for you and your unborn baby. Touchreleases chemicals that have relaxing and health-promoting effects. When you aregently stroked or therapeutically touched, your stress level declines, yourcirculation improves, and your body’s natural pleasure-enhancing molecules areenlivened. These health-promoting chemicals travel through both the maternal andfetal circulations. Massage also improves immune function, reducing Mother’ssusceptibility to colds and flu. A massage feels wonderful whether or not youare pregnant. When you are feeling comfortable and relaxed, your unborn childalso benefits. As you relax, you may find that your baby enjoys the feeling somuch that she begins to move and kick playfully, while at other times you mayfeel her contentedly resting.Studies have shown that pregnant women who receive massage sleep better and havelower levels of anxiety and depression. Massaged mothers experience fewercomplications during labor and have a lower incidence of premature deliveries.There is also evidence that infants born of mothers who have received massagesregularly during pregnancy have fewer problems during the first few weeks afterbirth.ExerciseSeveral times during the day, tenderly place your hands on your belly. Imagineyourself holding your baby as she sleeps or kicks inside your womb. Gentlymassage your belly while speaking softly to her. Connect with your baby throughthe sense of touch, even before she is in your arms.Nurturing Through TouchSeek out nurturing touch throughout your pregnancy, from your husband orpartner, from your family members and friends. Find a professional massagetherapist who has experience with pregnant women. You can also gain many of thehealing and soothing benefits of touch by performing an oil massage on yourselfeach day. According to Ayurveda, a daily self-massage is one of the mostbalancing components of a health-promoting daily routine. Try the followingprocedure before or after your daily bath or shower. If you are having troublesleeping, perform the oil massage before bed, followed by a warm aromatherapybath. Be sure to perform the massage over a towel or mat so that you do not slipand always remove the oil from your feet before moving around.The subtle effects of different massage oils can be used to balance your mindand body. Oils that are considered warmer and heavier, such as sesame, walnut,and almond, are helpful in pacifying mental turbulence due to a Vata imbalance.Cooler oils, such as coconut, olive, and avocado, are helpful in soothingirritability related to a Pitta imbalance. Lighter oils, including sunflower,safflower, and mustard seed, help improve circulation and relieve the congestionassociated with a Kapha imbalance. All-natural vegetable, nut, or seed oilsnourish and soothe the tissues.The style and intensity of the massage strokes also influence the effects of themassage. If you are feeling anxious or having trouble sleeping, use a firm,grounding massage stroke. If you are feeling overheated or irritable, use agentler stroke. If you are feeling congested or bloated, try a deeper, morevigorous stroke. Listen to the needs of your body, and stay present in theprocess.SELF-MASSAGE (USUALLY PERFORMED OVER FIVE TO TEN MINUTES)Begin by warming the oil under hot water. Pour a small amount of oil in yourhands and use it to massage your scalp vigorously. Cover your entire scalp withsmall, circular strokes as if you were shampooing your hair. As your fingerscaress your scalp, close your eyes and enjoy the sensations.image [images/Chop_9780307237330_epub_013_r1.jpg]Next move to your face and ears. Gently massage the backs of your ears.According to both Ayurveda and traditional Chinese medicine, your ears have manysensitive nerve endings that connect to all areas of your body, so massagingthem is especially calming. Apply a little more oil to your hands and withcircular motions, stroke your temples, forehead, eyebrows, nose, cheeks, jaw,mouth, and chin. Massage the front, back, and sides of your neck.Next massage your arms. The process for both your upper and lower limbs is touse a circular motion over the joints and a back-and-forth motion over the longbones. Apply the oil in a circular motion to your shoulders, back and forth onyour upper arms, circular at the elbows, back and forth over the forearms,circular at the wrists, and then massage each finger from the base of your palmto the fingertip.Be very gentle over your trunk. Use large circular motions over your breasts,belly, and lower abdomen. As you massage your belly and pass your hands overyour womb, send love and tenderness to your growing baby. Apply a little moreoil and reach around to massage your back as best as you can. Ask your partnerto massage any areas you can’t reach on your own.Finish with your legs and feet. Massage your legs as you did your arms, usingcircular motions at your hips, back-and-forth motions over your thighs, circularover the knees, and long back-and-forth strokes on your lower legs. Very gentlyapply circular motions over the ankles, and then vigorously massage your feetwith a back-and-forth motion and then stroke and pull each toe.If possible, allow the oil to soak into your body. Leaving on a thin layer ofoil will protect and nourish your skin and help keep your muscles warmthroughout the day. If you take a shower after the massage, wash with mild soap.MINIMASSAGE (ONE TO TWO MINUTES)If you don’t have time for a full-body massage, a short one is better than noneat all. Your head and feet are the most important parts of your body to cover,and this can be accomplished in a very short time.Rub some warm oil into your scalp, using the small, circular motions describedabove. Use your palm to massage your forehead from side to side.Gently massage your temples, using circular motions. Then gently rub the outsideof your ears. Spend a few moments massaging the back and front of your neck.With a little more oil, massage both feet with the flat of your hand. Work theoil around your toes with your fingertips, and then vigorously massage the solesof your feet with brisk back-and-forth motions of your palms. Sit quietly for afew seconds to relax and let the oil soak in, and then bathe as usual.MASSAGING THE PERINEUMThe perineum refers to the structures around the floor of the pelvis, coveringthe area from the pubic bone in front to the coccyx bone at the tip of yourspine. Although the soft tissues around the perineum become elastic and stretchyduring birth, we recommend you begin tenderly massaging your perineal area withoil about four to six weeks before your due date to help prepare for delivery.This may help reduce the likelihood of tearing or injury and can facilitate thehealing of tissues after birth. It will also help to familiarize you with thefeeling of your perineum stretching.image [images/Chop_9780307237330_epub_016_r1.jpg]Nourish Your Baby and Yourself Through SightYou are your baby’s window to the world. Everything that you see influences yourbody and your unborn child. When you gaze lovingly into the eyes of your partnerand become filled with comforting feelings, you communicate your sensations toyour baby. When you laugh joyfully at children playing or witness a dazzlingsunset, something shifts inside you. Studies have shown that visual experiencesevoke chemical responses throughout the body that can uplift or depress us. Whenmedical students were shown videos with violent scenes, they experiencedsuppression of their immune system, whereas when they watched images ofcompassionate acts, their immune function was enhanced. You can change yourbody’s chemistry by paying attention to what you see. To the extent possible,limit your exposure to visual experiences that upset you, such as scary orviolent movies and disturbing television shows. Seek out visual experiences thatdelight you.Upon awakening in the morning, become aware of the first things you see when youlook around. Notice whether or not your day’s first sights are pleasing to youreyes. Throughout the day remain conscious of the images you see. Become aware ofhow they affect you. Before going to bed, gaze into the sky, taking in theexperience of the stars, the moon, and the whole galaxy. Tune into thesensations that are created in your body as you take in these sights. Close youreyes and notice how you feel. Breathe into the feelings.By the time the fetus is thirteen weeks old, her eyes are well developed. Hereyelids will now close until the seventh month of life when the eyelids unsealagain.Search for visual experiences that uplift you. Walk through gardens and spendtime at the beach. Make a point of get-ting outside each day. As you movethrough nature, enjoy the sights of the luxuriant plants and magnificent treesin your environment, absorbing the oxygen they are releasing to you. Observe thecolors, textures, and shapes of everything you see. People, things, and events“out there” all become a part of who we are “in here.”Human beings are visual creatures, and our interpretation of what we seestrongly influences our sense of comfort or discomfort. Although while in thewomb your baby’s experiences are limited, there is evidence that shortly afterbirth, a newborn is able to recognize and process visual information.A fascinating study dating back to the 1970s by researcher T. G. R. Bower showedthat even at a few hours old, newborns preferred looking at their mother’s faceover another woman’s. To perform this study, pairs of female faces were flashedon a video screen in front of infants, who were given pacifiers to suck. If anewborn baby sucked one way, an unfamiliar woman would appear. If she suckedanother way, her mother would appear. After a period of watching and sucking,the newborns tended more often to suck in the way that brought their ownmother’s face onto the screen. One wonders if a baby begins to imagine hermother’s face based upon the sounds and sensations he hears in the womb, in thesame way that you as an adult might imagine what a person looks like when youare speaking to them on the telephone, or when you hear someone on the radio. Wecreate pictures from the sounds we hear, and your unborn baby may be doing thesame. For many reasons, when you have a choice, choose to see things that youwould want your baby to see, and reduce your exposure to visual images fromwhich you would want to protect your baby. This will add to your well-being aswell as to your baby’s.Nourish Your Baby and Yourself Through TasteWe have a natural tendency to sample the world by putting things into ourmouths. Infant children experience this inclination when they go through theoral phase. During this stage, parents quickly learn to clear their homes ofobjects that can be placed into the mouths of their young ones, because there isthis intrinsic impulse to taste things. Over millions of years of evolutionarytime, human beings have used this tendency to identify food sources that sustainand nourish us.The sense of taste assesses the nourishing potential of everything that passesthrough your mouth. Taste provides clues as to whether or not a food will add toor detract from feelings of well-being. If a potential food source has apalatable flavor, this indicates to the brain that taking more of it isbeneficial. If it has an offensive taste, the message is to leave it alone. Inthis way, people in every culture around the world have identified nurturingfoods that became essential components of their diet.Aside from breathing, eating is our most important bodily function. Your tastebuds have exquisitely sensitive receptors that take part in your body’s abilityto convert food into energy.People often overthink their nutrition. They try to balance their dietsaccording to the latest recommendations by nutritional experts who advocatevarying proportions of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. From the standpoint ofAyurveda, nutrition need not be complicated; nature has encoded the intelligenceof food into packets that provide the energy and information required to createand maintain a healthy body. This area is a vitally important part of a healthypregnancy, so we will devote the entire next chapter to nourishing you and yourbaby.Nourish Your Baby and Yourself Through SmellSmell is one of your most primal senses and is intimately associated with memoryand emotion. The aroma of cookies baking in the oven or the scent of lilacbushes in a park may evoke images, memories, and emotions from your past.Although you might not always be aware of it, your brain is very sensitive tothe fragrance-carrying molecules in the air around you. Aromas provideinformation about your environment and subtly influence your moods, behavior,and energy levels.The brain is designed to process and respond to olfactory information throughthe limbic system. This circuitry coordinates the basic physiological functionsresponsible for regulating your appetite, sexual desire, blood pressure,heartbeat, sleep cycles, memory, and emotions. Your sense of smell plays a rolein these critical functions because in most higher animal species, olfaction isused to determine sources of nourishing food, partners suitable for mating, theboundaries of territory, and the presence of enemies. Although human beings areless tuned into their sense of smell than many other animals, we still respondto odors and scents in primitive and powerful ways.Each day you take the world in through your sense of smell.The earliest components of the olfactory system appear by six weeks of fetalage. Although it is not possible to assess exactly how soon and how well a fetuscan perceive smells, we do know that immediately after birth, an infant iscapable of identifying familiar odors and scents.Close your eyes for a moment and see if you can conjure up the different scentsthat surrounded you today. You may recall some that were pleasing and findothers that were offensive. As you evoke them, see if you can sense how you feltas a result of your exposure to them. Pleasant aromas soothe your being andunpleasant odors may annoy or deplete you.During pregnancy, you can take advantage of your sense of smell by consciouslychoosing aromas that are balancing and nourishing. There are two basic ways toconsciously use aromas to enhance a state of well-being. The first is to link apleasing fragrance to a positive experience. When you are practicing meditation,relaxing in a yoga pose, listening to soothing music, or receiving a massage,diffuse a calming aroma such as lavender, geranium, or juniper in the room. Yourbrain will begin to associate the smell with the experience, so that at othertimes, just inhaling the aroma will help you relax.The second way to benefit from smell is by taking advantage of the specifictherapeutic properties of essential oils. These oils are extracted from theroots and stems of flowers, fruits, herbs, and trees and have direct effects onthe nervous system. Essential oils, which are sometimes known as the soul of aplant, have a long-established role in healing systems around the world. InAyurveda, fragrances are used for their medicinal and spiritual properties. Werecommend that you keep a small vial of an essential oil with you, so it isavailable to you whenever you could benefit from its specific therapeuticcharacteristics.Listed below are essential oils that can be used to calm, soothe, or invigorateyour mind-body system and are safe to use during pregnancy.Essential OilsOIL SPECIAL EFFECTS CALMING AND GROUNDING Chamomile Balances digestionGeranium Mood elevating Lavender Pain relieving Vanilla Helps induce sleepSOOTHING AND COOLING Jasmine Mood elevating, anti-inflammatoryNeroli Balances digestion, refreshing Patchouli Grounding, skin replenishingMandarin Calming, soothing to nervous system INVIGORATING AND PURIFYINGCinnamon Stimulating, helps reduce digestive gas Ginger Digestive stimulant,anti-nausea Juniper Clears the mind, restores confidence ClarySage Decongesting and detoxifyingExerciseChoose one of the essential oils above that is soothing to you. Create acomfortable place to lie down where you can relax, or take a warm bath. Begindiffusing the essential into the air or pour a few drops into your tub.Once you are comfortable, allow your eyes to close and begin to feel yourbreath. Notice the sensations in your body. Feel yourself breathing into yourbelly and notice the scent of your aroma encircling you. Breathe it in. Allowthis fragrance to relax you (more) deeply. Feel the energy of this oil meltingaway any tension or resistance you may be carrying in your body. Breathe inrelaxation; breathe out tension. With your next inhalation, allow your awarenessto float to the crown of your head. As you exhale, relax from your crown all theway down through your body into your toes. Feel each breath helping your musclesunwind. Continue like this for a few minutes: breathing in to the top of yourhead, breathing out all the way down into your toes.Now, bring your awareness to your belly and feel your baby inside your womb.Breathe peacefulness into your belly and relax with your baby as you breatheout.Conscious Choice MakingYou are the sum total of the choices you make. At a very basic level, thechoices you make determine your sensory experience—what you hear, feel, see,taste, and smell. When you are in touch with the inner experiences that resultfrom sensations you intake from the world, you are in touch with the core ofyour life. Every experience has an impact on your biology. Everything that hashappened to you is recorded in your body; with each new experience, your bodychanges. The more consciously you choose your experiences, the more consciouslyyou create your body.Pregnancy is not just something that is happening to you; it is a miraculousunfolding that you are co-creating. For nine months, you are your unborn baby’senvironment, and your baby is affected by each one of your experiences. At thecore of your being you already know this, because you have had this experienceand felt these sensations as you developed and grew inside your mother’s womb.Now that this information is available to your conscious mind, make use of it tocreate a magical beginning for your child.Enliven Through Your Attention• Place your hands on your belly a few times throughout the day and send lovingthoughts to your unborn baby.• Journal each day about your experiences.• Early in your pregnancy, plant a tree or flowering bush to symbolize thegrowth of your baby in your womb. After your child is born, you can take care ofthe plant together.• Read enchanting stories and heartfelt poetry aloud to your baby and listen tobeautiful, relaxing music each day.• Perform a daily oil massage on yourself before you bathe or shower.• Diffuse an aroma while listening to music, while soaking in a tub, or whilemeditating to create the association between the fragrance and the relaxed stateof awareness."},{"pageContent":"image [images/Chop_9780307237330_epub_051_r1.jpg]Nourishment for TwoFrom Cosmic intelligence came space;From space, air;From air, fire;From fire, water;From water, plants;From plants, food;And from food the human body,Heads, arms, legs and heart.—TAITTIRIYA UPANISHADimage [images/Chop_9780307237330_epub_101_r1.jpg]From your earliest childhood, you are barraged with messages about food. Inaddition to the basic information transmitted by your parents, you’ve receivedthousands of hours of propaganda from television, radio, roadsideadvertisements, and print media, all attempting to shape your eating habits.Considering the volume of advice you’ve been exposed to, it’s not surprisingthat you might be confused about what to eat. It is also not unexpected thatsince so many people have lost touch with their intrinsic body intelligence, weare facing an epidemic of obesity in our society.Ayurveda suggests that the wisdom of nature is available in every cell of yourbody, and if you listen to the messages your body is sending, you will naturallyeat a healthy and balanced diet. We view the Ayurvedic approach as naturespeaking directly to us. Your senses are created to perceive those things in theworld that are nourishing to you. Your ability to taste, smell, and seepotential food sources provides the natural clues as to what to favor in yourdiet and what to reduce. Paying attention to flavors, aromas, and colors in yourdiet will ensure that you are ingesting the foods you need in order to create ahealthy body for you and your unborn baby.Ayurveda holds that nutrition involves more than what you ingest by way ofprotein, carbohydrates, and fats. Nutrition is the process by which MotherNature packages energy and information into vegetables, grains, fruits, and nutsthat are then metabolized by animals into the energy and information of theirbodies. Most fundamentally, food is sunlight condensed into matter.An ancient Vedic hymn declares, “Food is Brahman,” which means “Food isIntelligence.” When we consume food derived from the union of natural sunlight,fertile earth, pure water, and clean air, our bodies, emotions, and souls arenourished. We inherently recognize the relationship between food and our heartsand souls, as evidenced by our language, which frequently uses flavors and foodas metaphors for feelings and emotions. We use expressions such as “sweet love,”“sour grapes,” and “acid tones.” We describe our true emotions as “gut feelings”and tell our children they are so cute “we could eat them up.”The process of creating a body from food is miraculous. Ayurveda describes thebody as DNA wrapped with food. The DNA from you and your partner merges tocreate your baby, providing the template to weave the energy and information ofthe environment into your baby’s physical body. When you consume a four-courseItalian meal, the minestrone soup, spinach salad, pasta, tomato sauce, stringbeans, garlic bread, and cannoli carry both energy, in the form of calories, andinformation, in the form of vitamins, minerals, and natural chemicals. Youdigest, absorb, and metabolize the energy and information of your food into theintelligence of your body.Simultaneously your unborn baby extracts and metabolizes the nutritionalinformation in your bloodstream into his developing body. Carotene moleculesinside a carrot in your soup become woven into the retina of your baby’s eyes.Essential fatty acids from the olive oil in your salad dressing make up the cellmembranes of your baby’s liver. Your baby’s body is manufactured from the foodyou eat. Although it is true throughout one’s life, it becomes particularlyimportant during pregnancy to consume a healthy, balanced, delicious diet.Fortunately, with a little attention, this is easy to accomplish. The principlesare simple: throughout the day, eat foods that carry the six basic flavors yourtaste buds are capable of identifying and the seven basic colors your eyes aredesigned to recognize. By paying attention to the six tastes and seven colors,your diet will be delicious and nutritionally complete.The Six Tastes of LifeFrom the standpoint of Ayurveda, all sources of potential nourishment can becategorized according to one or more of six basic flavors. These are sweet,sour, salty, pungent, bitter, and astringent. The basic strategy, which holdstrue whether or not you are pregnant, is to have foods representing all sixtastes in your diet on a daily basis. This will ensure that you maintain theappropriate balance of carbohydrates, protein, and fat along with abundantlevels of essential vitamins and minerals. Variety is the key to a healthy,balanced diet. Let’s review each taste in more detail.SWEETIf you listen to your body, during pregnancy you will naturally be attracted tosweet foods. This does not imply that you will be consuming large quantities ofrefined sugar. Any food that is nourishing and brings satisfaction has a sweetcomponent. Sweetness is characteristic of bulk-building foods. Sweet foods areabundant sources of energy, but poorer sources of information. The energycomponent of foods is quantified by measuring calories. Foods that arecalorically rich contain carbohydrates, protein, and fat. Each gram ofcarbohydrate and protein carries about four calories, while each gram of fatcontains nine calories.The sweet category of foods includes milk, cheese, butter, nuts, tofu, breads,pasta, grains, starchy vegetables, sweet fruits, oils, and all animal products.In addition to their mass-building properties, sweet foods are soothing and havea softening effect on tissues. If you look at your grocery cart in the checkoutline, you will recognize that foods carrying the sweet taste constitute thelargest component of a healthy diet. A healthy balance of foods in this categoryis essential to supply adequate protein, essential fatty acids, and calories toyour developing baby.SOURSour taste is a feature of organic acids. Citric acid and ascorbic acid, foundin citrus fruits, berries, and tomatoes; lactic acid, found in cheese andyogurt; and acetic acid, present in pickles and salad dressings, all carry thesour taste. Sour foods aid in digestion, stimulate the appetite, and help movefood through the digestive tract. A healthy diet includes regular doses of thesour taste, primarily through the intake of fruits, berries, and tomatoes. Sweetfruits such as apples, apricots, grapes, plums, and pineapples also carry thesour flavor. Sour-carrying fruits provide essential quantities of vitamin C andflavonoids, which are necessary for healthy cell development and normal immunefunction.SALTYWe emerged from the ocean millions of years ago and still carry it in our blood.Salty is the flavor of the ocean and we have an inherent impulse to seek outsources of salt in our diet. In Western society you are much more likely to gettoo much rather than too little salt in your diet, but your systems could notfunction without a daily helping of sodium chloride. In addition to table salt,which should be used sparingly, the salty taste is carried in soy sauce,seafood, and seaweed products. In addition to its water-retaining properties,salty foods enhance digestion and are mildly sedating and laxative.PUNGENTThe pungent flavor is most commonly referred to as “hot” or “spicy.” The pungenttaste results from essential oils that stimulate the mucous membranes. Theseoils have been found to be rich in antioxidants, which explains why spices havebeen used for millennia to preserve food. The pungent flavor stimulatesdigestion, helps relieve nausea, cleanses the sinuses and respiratory tract, andis mildly laxative. Many foods carry the pungent flavor—including onions, leeks,garlic, scallions, chives, radishes, and chili peppers. Many of these foods havebeen shown to help reduce serum cholesterol levels, lower blood pressure, andenhance immune function. In addition, many culinary spices such as cloves,cinnamon, cayenne, black pepper, thyme, oregano, rosemary, basil, and nutmeg aremildly to moderately pungent and are flavor-enhancing and health-promotingadditions to every diet.One of the most important pungent spices is gingerroot. This prized medicinaland culinary spice has been used around the world to stimulate digestion andease nausea. Studies using gingerroot in the treatment of morning sickness haveshown it to be moderately effective. Since you will want to avoid anyunnecessary medications during pregnancy, drinking ginger tea or chewing on asmall piece of gingerroot can be a safe and effective way to relieve thedistressing nausea so commonly experienced in the first trimester. Western dietstend to be rather weak when it comes to the spicy taste, but there is abundantevidence to suggest that adding a little pungency to your meals is good for yourtaste buds and your physiology.BITTERBitter is the flavor of green and yellow vegetables. Their bitter taste is dueto the stimulation of specific receptors on the tongue that monitor the levelsof certain chemicals in your food. Many of the most important naturalhealth-promoting constituents of vegetables, known as phytonutrients orphytochemicals (phyto is Latin for “plant”) have a bitter taste. These includenatural disease-fighting, immune-enhancing, and growth-promoting substances suchas flavonoids, polyphenols, and terpenes.Bitter foods include broccoli, chard, eggplant, spinach, and zucchini. Leafygreens are considered bitter, as are many common culinary and medicinal herbs,such as dill, fenugreek, sage, and chamomile. The bitter taste can stimulatedigestion and has a detoxifying effect on the system.ASTRINGENTAstringent foods have a puckering or drying effect on mucous membranes. Westernnutrition does not usually consider astringency as a separate taste, but thechemicals responsible for this “puckering” effect have many health-enhancingbenefits. Foods with an astringent flavor include tart apples, asparagus, greenpeppers, cranberries, pomegranates, and spinach. Some of the best astringentfoods are beans and legumes. Lentils, chickpeas, soybeans, and split peas areexcellent sources of vegetable protein, complex carbohydrates, and fiber. Theyalso provide healthy doses of calcium, magnesium, and folic acid.At the turn of the twentieth century, vegetable sources of protein from nuts,beans, and peas made up a much higher portion of the American diet. Over thepast hundred years we have substantially replaced most of these vegetablesources of protein with animal ones. Along with this shift we’ve seen a markedrise in the risk of heart disease and various cancers. There is abundantevidence to suggest that reducing your intake of animal protein and increasinghigh-quality vegetable sources can enhance your current and future health.The Colors of FoodPhytochemicals are not only responsible for the flavors and smells of your food;they also underlie its color. In his wonderful book What Color Is Your Diet?,David Heber, M.D., reminds us that expanding the visual palette of your dietimproves its nutritional value. Take on the intention to consume a colorfuldiet, rich with beautiful vegetables, fruits, beans, and grains, and you willtake advantage of the health-promoting intelligence that nature provides. Froman evolutionary perspective, one of the reasons you are able to perceive theseven colors of the rainbow is so that you can distinguish a juicy ripe redstrawberry from an unripe one or a delicious yellow banana from a green one. Theaverage Western diet with its emphasis on browns and beiges tends to be ratherbland from a visual as well as nutritional perspective. Examples of foods ofvarious colors are given below. You’ll notice that we naturally eat many red,orange, yellow, and green foods, but it takes more attention to find foods onthe blue side of the color spectrum. Enrich your diet with color, and you enrichit with nutrients as well.Colorful NutritionCOLOREXAMPLES RedStrawberries, red bell peppers, pink grapefruit, tomatoes,watermelon, beets, radishes OrangeOranges, cantaloupe, carrots, apricots, mangoYellowYellow squash, bananas, onions, peaches, millet GreenBroccoli, zucchini,spinach, green beans, chard, lima beans BlueBlueberries, blue cornIndigoEggplant, blackberries, plums, prunes, black beans VioletGrapes, kale,purple potatoes, purple basilA Balanced Pregnancy DietPregnancy is not a time for radical nutrition. Regardless of your personaldietary choices, you have an obligation to ensure that your food selections arefully nourishing to your unborn baby. The essence of parenting is stretchingyour boundaries for the benefit of your offspring. If you need to be either moreexpansive or more selective in your eating practices so your baby-to-be createsa healthy body, view these changes as an opportunity to cultivate flexibility—atrait that will serve you well in child rearing.There are a few basic principles that apply to nutrition during pregnancy. Becreative in how you follow these principles, but remember that your diet is yourunborn baby’s diet.1. EAT NUTRITIOUS FOOD.In the later months of your pregnancy, you may find that your capacity for fooddiminishes due to pressure on digestive organs from your growing womb. Cultivatethe habit early so that you don’t waste calories on nutritionally empty food.Rather than indulging on chips and cookies, favor fruits, yogurt, andwhole-grain cereals. This does not mean that you cannot enjoy a daily delicioustreat; simply be conscious of the nutritional value of everything you allow intoyour body.2. LISTEN TO YOUR APPETITE.During most of the nineteenth century and the first half of the twentieth,pregnant women were told to restrict their food intake and limit their weightgain. As a result, problems associated with low-birth-weight babies were common,including increased susceptibility to infection and delayed neurologicaldevelopment. The injunction to limit weight gain derived from the recognitionthat small babies are easier to deliver than large ones.We now know that a well-balanced nutritional program naturally leads to bigger,healthier babies. In general, a weight gain of 25 to 35 pounds leads to thehealthiest newborns. These extra pounds are composed of the following:Baby: 71⁄2 poundsUterus: 21⁄2-pound weight gainPlacenta: 1 poundAmniotic fluid: 2 poundsMother’s breasts: 3-pound weight gainMother’s blood: 4-pound increaseMother’s fat: 5+ pound increaseTotal weight gain: 25+ poundsListening to your appetite is the best way to ensure that you add weight at theright rate, which is a few pounds during the first trimester and about a poundper week for the remainder of the pregnancy. Listening to your appetite meanseating when you are hungry and stopping when you are comfortably satisfied. Auseful way to consider your appetite is by envisioning a satiety gauge, where 0is completely empty and 10 is stuffed. The general rule is to eat when you areat level 3 and stop when you are at level 7. Level 3 means you are very hungryand thinking about food, but not having hunger pangs. Level 7 means you arecomfortably full, but still have about a third of your stomach empty. Avoidingthe impulse to eat until you are stuffed maximizes your digestive power andensures you are getting the appropriate caloric intake.3. CONSUME ADEQUATE AMOUNTS OF HIGH-QUALITY PROTEIN.Protein-rich foods supply the essential amino acids that are necessary forhealthy fetal development. Proteins are indispensable components of cells,enzymes, and many hormones. The protein you ingest is broken down in yourstomach and the early part of your small intestines. The resultant amino acidsare absorbed farther down the digestive tract and assembled into the essentialstructures of your body and the body of your unborn baby.The recommended intake of protein for a pregnant woman is approximately .5 gramsper pound of body weight. If you weigh 120 pounds, you should be eating about 60grams of protein per day (0.5 × 120 = 60). Examples of the protein content ofdifferent foods are listed below.Protein ContentsFOODQUANTITYGRAMS OF PROTEIN Milk1 cup9 Cottage cheese2 ounces9 Egg1 whole6Beans or peas1⁄2 cup dried, cooked8 Roasted nuts1⁄4 cup6–7 Peanut butter1 tbsp4Vegetables1⁄2 cup1–3 Fruits1⁄2 cup1–2 Pasta or rice1⁄2 cup, cooked2 Bread,wheat1 slice2–3 Fish, fowl, meat3 ounces, cooked15–25Your body is unable to synthesize eight essential amino acids in adequateamounts and, therefore, you must ingest them from outside food sources. Alleight of these amino acids are present in dairy and animal products, but one ormore are usually deficient in vegetable protein sources. This does not mean thatyou cannot get sufficient high-quality protein on a pure vegan diet, but it doesmean that you must be extremely careful to combine abundant amounts of beans,nuts, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. If you are vegetarian, it is mucheasier and safer to follow a lacto-ovo diet during pregnancy, consuming regulardoses of dairy products and eggs. In the interest of your environment, yourunborn baby, and yourself, consume only organic milk, cheese, and yogurt, andeggs from free-ranging, hormone-free chickens.4. CONSUME FOODS THAT CONTAIN BOTH OMEGA-3 AND OMEGA-6 FATTY ACIDS.Essential fatty acids are required for the normal development of the fetalnervous system and immune system. The fetus extracts the required fats from thecirculation of Mother, who must consume them in her diet. There are two maincategories of essential fats, commonly known as omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids.Most Western diets are high in omega-6 but relatively deficient in omega-3 fattyacids. Omega-6 fatty acids are abundant in most seed- and nut-derived oils, suchas almond, corn, safflower, sesame, sunflower, and walnut. Seed oils containrelatively low levels of omega-3 fatty acids with the exception of flaxseed,canola, and soybean. Most green vegetables are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, butsince there is so little fat in vegetables, the total dose of omega-3 fattyacids from vegetables is limited.Fish oils contain abundant quantities of omega-3 fatty acids, but there isincreasing concern that predatory fish (shark, swordfish, king mackerel, andtilefish) along with freshwater fish contain potentially hazardous levels of thetoxin methylmercury. The Food and Drug Administration has advised pregnant womento avoid eating these fish and to limit their intake of other seafood to 12ounces per week. Tuna is in the gray zone because larger tuna that are sold forsteaks have higher concentrations of mercury, whereas the smaller tuna mostoften used for canned fish have lower levels. Mercury released from industrialsites enters our water supply through the air and soil and becomes concentratedin fish. It has been shown that the consumption of mercury-containing fish bypregnant women can lead to toxic levels, which may impair neurologicaldevelopment in their unborn babies.The bottom line is to put attention on adding omega-3 food sources to your diet.Cook with canola or soybean oil, add roasted flaxseeds to your salads andsautéed vegetables, and eat a few walnuts every day. If you eat fish, do notoverdo it and avoid those that are known to carry a higher risk for mercurycontamination.5. TAKE A HIGH-QUALITY PRENATAL VITAMIN SUPPLEMENT THROUGHOUT YOUR PREGNANCY.Even with the best intentions to eat a balanced diet, you do not want to risk anutritional deficiency while you are pregnant. Many of your essential nutrientneeds rise during pregnancy, including increased requirements for calcium,magnesium, phosphorus, iron, and vitamin D. Your need for antioxidant vitamins(A, C, E) rises by 10 to 20 percent. With the increased metabolic activity ofpregnancy comes a slightly increased requirement for the B vitamins. One of theB vitamins, folic acid, has been identified as a critical nutrient, which ifdeficient can lead to developmental defects in the brain and spinal cord.Supplementation with folic acid is considered prudent; most prenatal dailyvitamins contain 800 mcg of it.All essential vitamins and minerals are necessary for a healthy baby, but it ispossible to overdose. Too much vitamin A has been associated with a variety ofbirth defects, so current recommendations are to consume less than 10,000international units (IUs) per day. Between a balanced diet and a good standardprenatal vitamin, you will easily ensure that both you and your baby are wellnourished. Discuss with your health care advisor his or her vitaminrecommendations, but don’t substitute good vitamins for good food.Eating with AwarenessFrom a mind-body perspective, nutrition is not limited to just the food weconsume. The environment in which we dine, our emotional state, and theconversations we engage in during the meal are as essential to optimal nutritionas the food we are eating. How we eat is as important as what we eat. Try theexercise on page 90 to have a clear experience of how it feels to eat mindfully.Vitamin and Mineral Intake During PregnancyNUTRIENTRECOMMENDEDDAILYALLOWANCE (RDA)STANDARDPRENATAL VITAMINSUPPLEMENT Vitamin A4000 IU2500–5000 IU Vitamin D400 IU400 IU Vitamin E24 IU30IU Vitamin C60 mg60–120 mg Vitamin B1 (Thiamin)1.1 mg1.6–3 mg Vitamin B2(Riboflavin)1.3 mg1.8–3.4 mg Niacinamide15 mg17–20 mg Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine)1.6mg4 mg Folate400 mcg800 mcg Vitamin B122 mcg12 mcg Calcium1200 mg200–250 mgMagnesium280 mg100 mg Iron15 mg28–90 mg Zinc12 mg25 mg Iodine150 mcg150–200 mcgCopper2 mg2–3 mg IU = international units • mg = milligrams • mcg = microgramsExerciseThis is a fun exercise to do with a partner or friend. Select three differenttypes of food to use for this exercise. For example, you might select an orangeslice, a few raisins, and some sunflower seeds. Group your choices into threeseparate piles.Close your eyes and sit quietly for a few minutes. Feel yourself breathing inand out and allow your body to relax. Notice the space inside your body and keepbreathing into your inner space until you feel settled. Now open your eyes andselect a piece of food. Look at it closely and notice its color and texture.What does it feel like as you hold it between your fingers? Notice its aroma.Slowly close your eyes and put this piece of food into your mouth. Feel thesensations as it enters your body. Notice the flavor and texture as you begin tochew. Experience the sensations of your tongue moving the food inside yourmouth. Do you like or dislike the taste? Is this flavor triggering any memories?Wait until the bite is completely liquefied before you swallow it. Can you feelit moving down your esophagus into your stomach? How full is your stomach?Once you are finished with your first bite, sit quietly for a few moments andreflect on what you noticed. You may, for example, discover that flavors andtextures are more vibrant. Reflect on what it feels like to be present to eachaspect of eating. When you feel ready, try another type of food. Repeat the sameprocess. Notice all the sensations that this new food brings to your awareness.Savor each bite. After you have swallowed, sit quietly once again. When you areready, try the last type of food. Notice the differences and similarities intastes, sensations, aromas, and memories evoked by each piece of food. When youfeel ready, open your eyes and share your experience with your partner.Practice eating with awareness. Most of us do not take the time to just sit andeat. We are too busy eating and doing, eating and talking, eating and working,even eating and driving. We forget that eating is a delightful experience initself, worthy of our full attention. When you eat with awareness, you willnotice how each bite nourishes your body, mind, and soul. Choose one meal thisweek to eat in silence, noticing the flavors, sensations, and aromas thatnurture you.Body Intelligence Techniques for PregnancyHere are some suggestions to help expand your enjoyment at each meal.• Eat your meals in a peaceful and settled environment. Avoid eating when youare upset.• Eliminate alcohol, nicotine, and nonprescription drugs from your life.• Make an effort to eliminate or cut back on caffeine, remembering thatchocolate and soft drinks often contain caffeine.• Honor your appetite. You may get hungry many times per day, particularly laterin your pregnancy. Eat when you feel hungry and stop when you are satiated.• Don’t overeat; leave about a third of your stomach empty to aid digestion.• Eat at a comfortable pace; stay conscious of the process.• Eat freshly prepared foods. Lightly cooked foods are preferable to raw orovercooked foods.• Favor fruits, vegetables, and grains.• Favor low-fat dairy, almonds, and honey.• Reduce ice-cold foods and beverages.• Drink plenty of pure, room-temperature water each day.• Sit quietly for a few minutes after finishing your meal.• Honor any cravings you may have, but indulge in them with awareness.• Include all six tastes at every meal.• Comply with any supplementary vitamins recommended by your health provider.With each bite of food, you ingest a universe of experiences. Many thingsconspired to create the carrots on your plate—the rain, sunshine, and clouds,the plants and animals in the ecosystem of the carrot farm, the farmer and hisrelationships, the soil, insects, worms, and birds, the production plant, thetruck drivers, the food market, and the produce manager. The more you considerhow much is involved in the creation of your foods, the more you must marvel atthe web of life and how you and your baby are inextricably woven into it.

As aresult of this intimate communication link, the expectant family assumes a newresponsibility. For the benefit of both your unborn baby and your family, it isessential that you cultivate the ability to maintain your balance while facingthe inevitable daily stresses of life. Learning to stay centered during the upsand downs will serve you well throughout your pregnancy and throughout yourlife.We have learned a lot about stress over the past seventy years. Whenever youfeel physically or emotionally threatened, your body and mind shift into aprotective mode. Your heart beats faster and harder. You breathe more rapidly.Your adrenal glands squirt out stress hormones including adrenaline andcortisol, and your blood sugar rises. Your body perspires and your blood clots alittle easier. These physiological changes prepare you to deal aggressively withthe stress, either by fighting or running away. This reaction has become knownas the fight-or-flight response. If the source of your stress is a wild tigertrying to eat you for lunch, the impulse to pick up a stick or run up a tree isadaptive and potentially life saving. If the source of your stress is a trafficjam during rush hour or a delayed airplane flight, activating thefight-or-flight response does you little good.Eliciting the stress response repeatedly over time eventually predisposes you toillness ranging from chronic fatigue to heart disease.Studies have shown that when you inject the stress hormones adrenaline andnoradrenaline into a calm animal, it reacts as if it were facing a stressfulthreat. The animal’s heart races, its blood pressure rises, and it appears to beagitated. When a pregnant mother is anxious, stressed, or in a fearful state,the stress hormones released into her bloodstream cross through the placenta tothe baby. The unborn baby responds to her mother’s stress in a similar way.A study by an obstetrician from Austria, Dr. Emil Reinold, explored how quicklya mother’s anxiety elicits a response in the unborn baby. Reinold instructed agroup of pregnant women that he was going to check their baby with an ultrasoundmachine. After asking them to lie down and relax, and letting them know he waswaiting for the baby to become calm, he told the mothers (knowing his statementwould elicit anxiety) that the baby wasn’t moving. In every case, within secondsafter the mothers received this information, their babies began kickingstrongly.In the early 1980s after an earthquake in Italy, pregnant women were studied byultrasound. Each mother was anxious and frightened as a result of theearthquake, and their unborn babies had become unusually active in response totheir mothers’ stress. Most of these babies remained agitated for several hoursafter the incident, and then many became inactive for up to three days beforesettling back into their normal rate of activity. Under intense maternal stress,the fetus activates its own fight-or-flight response, at times becomingexhausted.In our Magical Beginnings courses taught at the Chopra Center, we ask pregnantmothers attending our childbirth classes to observe their stresses for a week,noticing if their babies show any response. Mothers consistently report thatwhen they feel stressed, their babies often react by kicking. They repeatedlynotice that loud noises such as dogs barking, sirens sounding, horns honking,and people yelling cause their babies to react. The unborn baby is a conscious,sentient being with thoughts, feelings, and memories of her own. She canexperience pleasure, pain, fear, stress, and serenity, in response to hismother’s experiences and reactions.Hundreds of studies have confirmed that chemicals released by the pregnantmother’s body are transported into the womb and affect the unborn baby. Maternalstress influences uterine blood flow. Stress activates the unborn child’sendocrine system and influences fetal brain development. Children born tomothers who had intensely stressful pregnancies are more likely to havebehavioral problems later in life. These studies do not suggest that every timeyou get upset about something, you are harming your unborn baby. Rather, we hopethat they will motivate you to deal with your daily challenges with as balanceda state of mind as possible.A neonatologist friend of ours, Dr. Jamison Jones, tells the story of twopremature infants under his care. Born two months early, they were in theneonatal intensive care unit at the same time. One was the baby of a woman whowas a heroin addict. The other was born to a high-powered executive who workedup until the day she went into premature labor. Although these two babies camefrom mothers of vastly different socioeconomic backgrounds, they demonstratedsimilar problems in the hospital. Each had accelerated heart rates anddifficulty breathing and appeared highly agitated. Although they were incubatedin mothers from very different worlds, they had one thing in common: bothmothers were under a tremendous amount of stress during the pregnancy.Your unborn baby cannot control your choices or reactions to the world andtherefore cannot control the sensations she experiences. If you are experiencingstress, your baby experiences it along with you. Stresses can be emotional orphysical. In a fascinating study published by Dr. Michael Lieberman, unbornbabies’ responses to their mothers’ smoking were monitored. He found that thebabies became agitated within a few seconds after their mothers inhaled. Thebabies’ heart rates, kicking movements, and breathing motions all increased. Ofeven greater significance was the observation that when these mothers simplythought of having a cigarette, the babies had similar agitated responses.We cannot ensure that our lives are stress free, but we can learn to reduce ourreactivity to life challenges. Just as our body/minds are wired to respond tothreats in an aggressive manner, we have the capacity to respond with restfulawareness to circumstances throughout the day. Learning to be mindful of thesituations that trigger your stressful reactions is an important first step inreducing them.Managing StressExerciseOver the course of a week notice the situations, circumstances, people, andevents that trigger your feelings of stress. Each time you observe yourselfreacting, shift into a witnessing mode. Identify where you feel the sensation ofstress inside your body and notice if your baby kicks or has another response toyour stress. Keep your journal handy so you can record your observations.After a week’s worth of journaling, find a quiet place and, with your journal,markers, and pen, draw a stick figure portrait of yourself on the center of apage of paper. Draw a picture of your baby growing inside your womb. Whilerereading your observations of the situations and circumstances that catalyzedyour upsets, notice where in your body you feel your stress. Use your markers toidentify these places on your stick figure, choosing a different color for eachstressful situation. Next to each location where you marked your stressfulfeelings, write a few words to describe them. To reinforce the connectionbetween your feelings and those of your unborn baby, draw lines from thestressful sites in your body to your pregnant belly.As you look at your portrait, think about your baby, your body, and the ways youcan reduce your stress. Consider how you can best nourish and take care ofyourself and your baby each day. Take a few moments to journal your thoughts.Below we offer some suggestions to reduce the harmful effects of stress on youand your baby.• When you feel the sensation of stress, take in a few long,slow breaths. Feel yourself bringing oxygen into your body and imagine itinfusing your baby.• Massage your belly when you notice that you are feelingstressed. As you rub your belly, let your baby know that both of you are okay.• Take time out of each day to relax quietly.• Take walks in nature.• Soak in a warm aroma bath.• Listen to music that makes you feel happy.• Snuggle up with your partner or a close friend.• Get some form of exercise daily.• Treat yourself to a massage.• Practice meditation.Finding Silence/Releasing StressWhat is the value of meditation for parents-to-be? There are benefits on manylevels. From a basic physiological perspective, meditation is the perfectantidote to stress. During a stressful encounter your heart rate and bloodpressure rise, your breathing becomes rapid and shallow, and your adrenal glandspump out stress hormones. During meditation, your heart rate slows, your bloodpressure normalizes, your breathing quiets, and your stress hormone levels fall.Meditation enhances both mental and physical health.I have never encountered another temple as blissful as my own body.—SARAHAWhen a mother takes the time to quiet her mind and center herself, the calmingphysiological changes that are invoked through meditation are also communicatedto the baby. Stress hormone levels fall, oxygenation improves, and the unbornbaby gains the psychological and physiological benefits of restful awareness.Outside of the actual practice time, meditation helps you become less reactiveto stressful encounters. Many studies have shown that people who meditateregularly are more adaptable both mentally and physically to life’s challenges.Meditators have less anxiety and depression. They show lower rates of high bloodpressure and are less likely to use prescription or nonprescription drugs toregulate their moods. Taking the opportunity to connect with a deeper aspect ofyour being enables you to be more centered, less reactive, more responsive, lessanxious, more creative, and less habitual in all aspects of your life. As aresult of this expanded state of awareness, you are able to use your energy moreefficiently and enjoy your life and your family more.Meditation will help you quiet your inner dialogue so that you can be fullypresent to your experiences in each moment. This will allow you to be more fullyopen to yourself transforming as a mother, while bringing mindfulness to yourbody as you grow and then give birth to your baby. Meditation is the mostimportant tool to expand awareness. It provides you with the opportunity to turnyour attention inward. Normally your awareness is directed outward through yoursenses to the sounds, sensations, sights, tastes, and smells of the world aroundyou. Meditation is the process of disengaging your senses so you can experiencethe expanded silence within you. This domain of awareness is the source of yourthoughts and feelings. Although it is beyond mental activity, it gives rise toall creativity, insight, and understanding. Accessing this field of awareness ona daily basis through meditation encourages your identity to become moreexpansive, even in the midst of daily life.In each of our lives we experience a constant influx of change. We can see thisin our day-to-day lives, as people come and go, as our feelings, thoughts, andperceptions shift, as we take deeper or shallower breaths, as our body imagealters over time, and as each of the seasons changes—all of these aspects of ourlives are continually transforming. The challenge is learning to refine ourawareness so we can be with each of these experiences fully.My inside,listen to me,The greatest spirit,The Teacher,is near,Wake up,wake up!Run to his feet,He is standing close to your headRight now.You have slept for millions and millionsof years.Why not wake up this morning?—KABIRThere are many effective techniques of meditation. The essence of meditation isshifting your awareness from the objects of experience to the experiencer. Indaily life, your attention constantly moves from one sensory experience toanother. You listen to the radio, sip your coffee, read the morning newspaper,feel the accelerator pedal under your foot, hear the conversations over yourphone, and smell the strawberries at the market. Your awareness is continuallybeing seduced outward. During meditation you relinquish your attachment to theexperiences of your senses and become intimate with the one who is having theexperiences. You shift your reference point from the objects of experience tothe alert witness of the experience. Your identity shifts from ego to spirit,from constricted awareness to expanded awareness.Mantra MeditationTry this simple meditation technique that uses your breath and a breathingmantra to quiet mental activity and bring you to a state of restful awareness.Find a quiet place where you will not be disturbed. Turn off the ringer on yourphone and let your family know that you would appreciate twenty minutes ofprivacy. Find a comfortable place to sit with your back supported, but do notsupport your head. Take a few deep breaths and allow the tension to be releasedfrom your body. Close your eyes and simply become aware of the activity of yourmind. Notice how your thoughts come and go without any effort on your part. Itis the nature of the mind to generate thought forms spontaneously.Bring your attention to your breathing. Observe the inflow and outflow of yourbreath without attempting to consciously influence the rate or depth of yourbreathing. Maintain an attitude of innocence, neither resisting nor anticipatingany particular experience. Silently begin repeating the mantra “so-hum” withyour breathing. Think the word “so” on your inhalations and “hum” on yourexhalations. Silent mental repetition does not involve a clear pronunciation ofthese sounds. They are faint impulses repeated effortlessly.At times your attention will drift away from the mantra and become absorbed in athought. You may at times become aware of sounds in your environment. Asensation in your body may occasionally take your attention from the gentlerepetition of the mantra. Whenever you become aware that your attention hasdrifted away from “so-hum” to another thought, sound, or sensation, gentlyreturn your attention to the mantra.What lies before us and what lies behind us is but a small matter compared towhat lies within us.—RALPH WALDO EMERSONContinue this procedure for about twenty minutes. When the time is up, allowyour awareness to float freely. Wait a couple of minutes before opening youreyes and resuming your activities.Understanding Your Experiences in MeditationAll experiences during meditation fall into one of four categories: (1) silentlyrepeating the mantra, (2) having thoughts, (3) falling asleep, or (4) going intothe gap between thoughts. Each of these is a sign that you are practicingmeditation correctly. Let’s review each in more detail.THE MANTRAA mantra is a sound with a pleasant vibration that does not engage yourintellect. It is a word without meaning, which therefore does not keep yourawareness trapped on the level of analysis or understanding. Because the mantradoes not trigger the usual associations that normal words do, it acts as avehicle to experience thought forms at subtler levels of development.When you place your awareness on the mantra, you may notice that it changes—inrhythm, rate, or clarity. A change in your perception of the mantra suggeststhat you are experiencing less localized expressions of it; do not resistchanges in the mantra. Whenever you recognize that you are no longer repeatingthe mantra, gently return your awareness to it.THOUGHTSWhen people first start meditating, they often complain that they are having toomany thoughts. Although it may not feel very comfortable when your mind isactive, being aware of the activity of your mind is an important step. Beforebeginning meditation, most people never have the thought “I am having too manythoughts.” The technology of meditation begins the process of witnessing mentalactivity. This shift from being caught in your thoughts to becoming the alertwitness of thoughts is the shift from ego to spirit.When you are engrossed in a thought sequence, there is nothing you can do. Atsome point, however, the thought “I am not thinking the mantra” will arise. Whenyou have this thought, gently shift your attention back to “so-hum.”FALLING ASLEEPYou may fall asleep in your meditation. If you are fatigued and allow yourselfthe opportunity to relax, your body may take advantage of the opportunity totake a nap. Don’t fight the impulse to fall asleep. Allow your body to take therest it needs. When you awaken, spend at least five minutes thinking the mantraor focusing on your breath so your mind will be clear when you resume youractivity.THE GAPFinally, you may experience your mind becoming quiet while you maintain fullawareness. We describe this experience as slipping into the “gap” betweenthoughts. Awareness is maintained but there are no objects of awareness. This isthe domain of pure consciousness . . . of spirit. Your awareness has gone beyondyour environment, beyond your body, and beyond your mind. In this state of pureawareness, you glimpse the reality that your essential nature is not localizedin time and space.Meditation opens your channels of awareness, allowing you entry into a place ofpeaceful stillness that exists within you. This stillness is your source ofhappiness, peace, and creativity. As your mind quiets, your body relaxes deeply.Your baby will feel the quietness and relaxation you are generating in your bodyin her own body.Raising a child from conception to adulthood will inevitably bring challenges.How you deal with these challenges reflects the quality of your life and shapesthe lives of your children. You are not expected to be perfect in the sense thatyou never feel overwhelmed, frustrated, or irritated, but having a consciouspregnancy and living a conscious life means dedicating yourself to growing inwisdom, peace, harmony, and love. It means making a commitment to learn fromyour experiences in ways that raise the level of well-being for you and yourfamily. Conscious parenting is a balancing act. As you take on theresponsibility of ensuring the safety and nourishment of your children, it isalso important to be aware that your children are spiritual beings with theirown bodies, minds, souls, and destinies.The Yoga of PregnancyYoga is a powerful form of exercise that encourages flexibility in the body aswell as the mind.

You can consciously learn to strengthen these muscles by contracting andreleasing them throughout the day.For this exercise we will do the pelvic floor exercises sitting crossed-leggedbut you can do Kegel exercises anywhere and in any position.ELEVATOR KEGELSitting with your legs crossed, close your eyes and bring your awareness to yourpelvic floor—the space surrounding your urethra, vagina, and anus. Contract themuscles around your anus and then around your vagina and urethra. Continue tocontract these muscles inward and upward toward your belly. Imagine moving yourenergy from your pelvic floor to your abdomen as if traveling up an elevator.Hold for a few breaths, then slowly release the muscles as though you weretraveling back down the elevator to the first floor.Now focus on how your muscles feel back at the pelvic floor and see if you cansoften and release them even more. Continue to release these muscles, feelingthem relax and open.THE WAVE KEGELContract the muscles around your anus, then around your vagina and into yoururethra as though you were contracting these muscles toward your pubic bone. Itwill feel as though a wave were washing over your pelvic floor from your anus toyour pubic bone. Slowly release the muscles from your urethra to anus as thoughthe wave were releasing back to the shore. Start by simply contracting towardyour pubic bone and releasing, and then see if you can slow down the motion,hold for a breath at the deepest contraction, and then release slowly.BENEFITS OF KEGEL EXERCISESKegels help prevent urinary incontinence in late pregnancy and postpartum.Keeping your pelvic floor muscles in good tone will improve circulation and mayprevent hemorrhoids. The perineal or pelvic floor muscles form a figure-eightpattern around the vagina and anus. You use these muscles automatically duringlove making and when you resist the urge to urinate. As you practice tighteningand releasing these muscles, you will find that you can hold them in thecontracted position for longer periods of time. You will also be better skilledat keeping them relaxed when you need to during the final stage of labor. Werecommend that you perform fifty to one hundred Kegel exercises every day.Yoga for TwoTake the time to move your body consciously and both you and your unborn babywill enjoy the benefits. Pregnancy affects every aspect of your body and yogaprovides the opportunity for you to use your awareness to enliven healing andtransformation in every tissue, organ, and cell.

Major transformations are taking placein your physiology as your unborn baby develops. Riding these waves of changecan, at times, be challenging, and it is natural to experience emotional andphysical ups and downs during pregnancy. Remember that although the ride may bebumpy at times, a smoother patch is right around the corner. Try not to compoundyour discomfort by being hard on yourself for feeling emotionally and physicallyunstable.Although at other times of life you might be tempted to reach for a medicationto soothe digestive upset, relieve muscular aches and pains, or overcomesleeping difficulties, most drugs are best avoided during pregnancy. Pregnancy,therefore, offers a great opportunity to experience the power of naturalhealing. The suggestions outlined in this chapter are offered as first-lineapproaches to common concerns during pregnancy. They are not intended as asubstitute for appropriate medical advice. Incubating a new life is a sacredresponsibility and, therefore, you do not want to take risks with your unbornbaby’s life. This means not taking pharmaceutical agents unnecessarily and notavoiding them when they are deemed essential.A good channel of communication between you and your health care provider is animportant component of a conscious pregnancy. We encourage you to discuss alloptions you are pursuing with your doctor or midwife throughout your pregnancyand labor. In most cases, your health advisor will support your use of gentle,natural approaches for common minor concerns that arise during pregnancy.Morning SicknessAlmost three out of four women experience nausea during the first trimester ofpregnancy, and about half of women who have nausea will be sick enough to vomit.Although this condition is most commonly referred to as morning sickness, thestomach queasiness in the beginning of pregnancy, which may last throughout theday, is often called nausea and vomiting in pregnancy (NVP). Although thiscondition has been carefully studied, it is still not certain what actuallycauses it. No pregnant woman welcomes the uncomfortable sensations of morningsickness, but it appears to actually have a positive impact. Women whoexperience morning sickness have a substantially lower risk of miscarriage thanthose who do not.The nausea usually begins in the fifth week of gestation, peaks by eleven weeks,and typically subsides by the fifteenth or sixteenth week. Most women are nolonger bothered by nausea during the second half of pregnancy, but for a smallpercentage of women, it lasts the entire forty weeks. On a scale of one to five,with five being most severe, the majority of women rate their symptoms of nauseaat a level two or three; that is, enough to be really uncomfortable withoutbeing fully intolerable.Several scientists have suggested that morning sickness provides a protectivemechanism for the early embryo. The mother’s sensitivity to many foods may keepher from ingesting substances that could potentially harm the unborn baby. Themost common foods that pregnant women express aversion to during the firsttrimester are meat, poultry and fish, caffeine-containing beverages, andvegetables. From an evolutionary standpoint, avoidance by our ancestral mothersof potentially parasite-laden meat and phytochemically potent vegetables mayhave conferred protection for their vulnerable embryos. The tendency of modernmothers to crave fruits and fruit juices, grains, starches, sweets, and dairymay result from a selection process that increased the likelihood thatnutritional, safe, calorically rich foods became the nourishment of choice.Studies have shown repeatedly that the rates of miscarriages and stillbirths arelower in women who have nausea. Although some reports suggest that nausea isalso associated with fewer premature deliveries, higher birth weights, reducedbirth defects, and improved survival of infants, there have been an equal numberof contradictory reports that fail to show any definite benefits related tothese outcomes. We do know that mothers with nausea eat less during their firsttrimester and gain less weight. You might think that this would be associatedwith smaller and less-healthy babies. As it turns out, less weight gain in thefirst trimester results in an increase in the size of the placenta, whichsupplies blood to the developing fetus. As the nausea subsides, mothers increasetheir food intake during the second and third trimesters, their babies catch up,and the bigger placenta ensures a healthy supply of food and oxygen. Similarpatterns of food intake have been reported in other mammals, including dogs,monkeys, and chimpanzees, supporting the idea that NVP has a purpose.Relieving the UpsetKnowing that nausea during the first part of pregnancy is protective may giveyou some consolation, but most mothers would still be glad to see it subside.Medications used to treat nausea in the past have notoriously bad reputations,and pharmaceutical companies have essentially abandoned efforts to find newdrugs. This has opened the door to other, more natural, approaches.Most women with nausea try a variety of techniques to quiet their queasystomachs. A recent study from Canada found that the most common approaches thatpregnant moms use to fight nausea are these:Eating dry foodsHelpful or somewhat helpful in 64% Lying downHelpful or somewhathelpful in 59% Clear or carbonated liquidsHelpful or somewhat helpful in 52%Getting fresh airHelpful or somewhat helpful in 40% Mental concentrationHelpfulor somewhat helpful in 33%It is worth trying these simple approaches to reduce the nausea and vomiting ofpregnancy. An expanded list of possible remedies includes ginger, other aromaticherbs, vitamin B6, and acupressure, which we discuss in more detail below.GINGERThe spicy rootstock of ginger has been prized around the world for thousands ofyears. With a number of unique natural chemicals, ginger is most often used toaid digestion and improve circulation. Studies from Denmark found that almostthree out of four pregnant women received some relief of their nausea fromginger, without any limiting side effects. Another study from Thailand reportedthat more than 87 percent of pregnant women using ginger had reduced nausea andvomiting (versus less than a third of those who took a placebo). Ginger appearsto be safe for pregnancy. A Danish study found that ginger did not causeproblems when given to pregnant rats at many times the dosage that a woman wouldnormally take.The easiest way to take ginger is to make a tea using 1 teaspoon of freshlygrated gingerroot to 2 cups of hot water. Sweeten the tea with honey and sip itthroughout the day. You can also chew on 1⁄2 teaspoon of grated gingerroot mixedwith maple syrup when you are feeling nauseated.OTHER AROMATIC HERBSAromatic herbs are used traditionally to stimulate diges-tion and have beenpromoted to relieve morning sickness. Peppermint, chamomile, and cinnamon teascan sometimes soothe an upset stomach, as can alfalfa. Try making a tea out ofthese herbs. Alternatively, try sucking on a clove bud.VITAMIN B6Vitamin B6 or pyridoxine was a component of the morning sickness drug Bendectin,which contained the antihistamine doxylamine. Despite the absence of convincingevidence of toxicity, Bendectin was taken off the market due to legal concerns.There is some evidence that B6 alone may be helpful in reducing the nausea andvomiting of pregnancy at dosages of 25 milligrams every eight hours. Mostprenatal vitamins contain between 20 milligrams and 50 milligrams of B6.Although it is generally safe, B6 can cause nerve toxicity at very high doses.Therefore, if you find B6 helpful in reducing your morning sickness, limit yourintake to not more than a total of 75 milligrams per day. Of interest, a studythat attempted to correlate morning sickness with low blood B6 levels could notfind any relationship between vitamin B6 status and the incidence or degree ofmorning sickness.ACUPRESSUREA number of studies have suggested that stimulation of the acupuncture pointPericardium 6 (P6) has an antinausea effect. This point, known as Neiguan, islocated two finger widths above the crease of your wrist in the middle of thepalm side of your lower arm. You can stimulate the point by massaging it withyour thumb or wearing an elastic band designed to stimulate the point. There isan inexpensive product on the market called the Sea-Band Wristband, which iscommonly used by people prone to seasickness.image [images/Chop_9780307237330_epub_010_r1.jpg]DIETARY ADJUSTMENTSTry eating a few unsalted crackers or have a piece of toast upon arising in themorning. Light, easily digested foods are generally better tolerated thanheavier ones. Eat protein-rich snacks and do your best to avoid greasy, fatty,or fried foods. Heed the messages your body is sending.Other Digestive DisturbancesYour growing baby puts pressure on your digestive organs, commonly leading toindigestion, heartburn, bloating, and constipation. These minor but annoyingdigestive concerns are often amenable to simple, natural approaches.HEARTBURN AND INDIGESTIONHeartburn and indigestion are frequent complaints during pregnancy, experiencedmost often during the last trimester. The growing womb squeezes the digestivetract, leading to congestion and bloating, and compresses the stomach, forcingacid into the esophagus and resulting in heartburn.What Helps?• Eat smaller meals throughout the day.• Chew your food well. Don’t swallow until it is fullyliquefied.• Reduce fatty and greasy foods.• Eat or suck on slippery elm lozenges, an herb that can soothean acidic stomach.• Alfalfa, in the form of a pill, tea, or sprout, can helprelieve indigestion and heartburn. Alfalfa contains eight different digestiveenzymes and is rich in vitamins A, D, E, and K.• Consume some milk or freshly made yogurt during the day.• Drink fennel tea at the end of meals.• Eat chewable calcium tablets to neutralize stomach acid.• Chew on some orange peel after meals.• Try dry-roasted coriander, cumin, or fennel seeds and chew ona pinch of them after each meal.• Drink carbonated fluids.• Use the herbs cardamom, cinnamon, and bay to dispel gas.CONSTIPATIONMany women develop constipation during pregnancy. It is attributed in part tothe hormone progesterone, which relaxes the smooth muscles of thegastrointestinal tract. Pressure placed by the growing baby on the intestinesalso contributes to constipation.What Helps?• Drink lots of fresh water and juices.• Exercise daily.• Increase your intake of fresh fruits, salads, and vegetables.• Include in your diet foods rich in fiber.• Consider taking alfalfa, which may help relieve constipation.• Eat several prunes and raisins each day.HEMORRHOIDSDue to the buildup of abdominal pressure throughout pregnancy, hemorrhoids are acommon concern. With the straining that occurs during labor, they often worsenafter birth. Pressure in the belly and pelvis impedes the return of bloodsupply, causing rectal blood vessels to dilate. Also, increased levels ofprogesterone during pregnancy relax smooth muscles, slowing blood flow throughthe veins.What Helps?• Exercise regularly to improve circulation and muscle tone.• Drink plenty of fluids.• Eat more fiber-rich foods to reduce constipation and the needfor forceful evacuation.• Consider vitamin E, which may be helpful in maintainingelasticity in the veins.• Use fresh garlic, which also may be helpful in retaining veinelasticity.• Reduce spicy foods.• Support healthy blood vessels with the natural chemicals inberries and cherries.• Sip nettle tea throughout the day—it is great for veinelasticity.• Avoid sitting for long periods of time.• Use witch hazel for pain or itching hemorrhoids. Presoakedpads are available at pharmacies. You can apply witch hazel directly to yourbottom or soak an ice pack in witch hazel and apply it.• Try a comfrey compress on your bottom by brewing some leavesand soaking a clean washcloth in the decoction. (Comfrey is known for itshealing and pain-relieving qualities.)• Do Kegel exercises throughout the day to increase circulationin the perineum.INSOMNIARestless sleep is almost universal during pregnancy, particularly during thelast trimester.What Helps?• Exercise each day.• Wind down intense mental activity at least one hour beforeyour regular bedtime.• Perform a self-massage, followed by a warm aroma bath withlavender or vanilla.• Drink a cup of chamomile tea before bed.• Try a glass of warm milk with cardamom, nutmeg, or a pinch ofsaffron before bed.• Listen to relaxing music.• Place pillows under your belly and between your legs. A bodypillow works great at the end of pregnancy.NASAL CONGESTIONMore than one in five pregnant women complain of nasal congestion, which isoften most disturbing in the evening hours and may interfere with sleep. Theexact cause of this problem is not clear. Nasal congestion in pregnancy does notseem to be an allergic reaction and does not respond to the usual medications.Circulating hormones may contribute to the swelling of mucous membranes insidethe nose, resulting in congestion and a runny nose.What Helps?• Drink plenty of fluids.• Get plenty of fresh air.• Try a vaporizer or humidifier.image [images/Chop_9780307237330_epub_018_r1.jpg]• Use a neti pot. Add some warm salt water to the pot andadminister to the nasal passages. Follow this by applying some sesame oil orghee to your nose.• Try the Breathing Easy nasal patches when you sleep or liedown. These are available in most pharmacies.LEG CRAMPSIt is not unusual to experience leg cramps as your body attempts to adjust tothe rapid physical and hormonal changes of pregnancy. Studies have shown thatalmost half of all pregnant woman experience leg cramps, most often in thesecond half of pregnancy. Although they can occur throughout the day, they aremost common and most severe at night.What Helps?• Exercise every day.• Elevate your legs frequently during the day.• Massage your calves and thighs with oil on a daily basis.• Ensure that you are receiving abundant calcium and magnesiumin your diet. Good natural calcium sources are dark leafy greens, kelp, cheese,yogurt, soy milk, nuts, and fruits. Magnesium-rich foods include nuts, legumes,whole-grain cereals, dark green vegetables, soybeans, and seafood.• Discuss with your health provider the need for magnesiumsupplementation.• Sip raspberry leaf or nettle tea.• Include vitamin E–rich foods such as wheat germ, spinach, anddried fruit in your diet.• To relieve leg cramps as they occur, stretch your calf muscleby bending your foot toward your head and rotating your ankle.• Apply warm compresses to the cramped area.BACKACHEAs pregnancy progresses, your body secretes chemicals that loosen the joints andligaments in preparation for birth. The increased weight of your growing babyalong with the laxity of the ligaments may cause your back to ache.image [images/Chop_9780307237330_epub_014_r1.jpg]Incorrectimage [images/Chop_9780307237330_epub_015_r1.jpg]CorrectWhat Helps?• Exercise daily.• Avoid heavy lifting and always bend your knees when liftingobjects below your waist.• Practice yoga.• Relax in a warm aroma bath.• Receive back massages to relax and release tight muscles.• Take time out to rest a little while each day.• Apply warm heat to your back.• Ensure adequate calcium and magnesium in your diet.• Drink plenty of fluids.• Sleep with pillows under your knees and use pillows tosupport your back and growing belly.MOOD SWINGSFluctuating moods are common during pregnancy. There are a lot of changes takingplace in your body, which affect your emotions. Be gentle with yourself and knowthat some emotional turbulence is normal. Having a baby will change your life,and some anxiety over these changes is healthy.What Helps?• Meditate regularly.• Practice yoga.• Exercise daily.• Take time to relax by listening to soothing music or guidedvisualizations.• Take naps when you are tired.• Soak in a warm aroma bath.• Honor the changes you are experiencing and find ways tonurture yourself.• Communicate your needs and concerns to your family and yoursocial support network.• Journal about your feelings each day.• Increase your energy by eating high-protein snacks.• Drink plenty of fluids.• Sip chamomile or raspberry leaf tea.• If anxiety or depression is interfering with your daily life,be sure to promptly communicate your concerns to your health care provider.SWELLINGMinor swelling of the hands, ankles, and feet is common during the final weeksof pregnancy. The hormonal changes associated with pregnancy may result in fluidretention, and your enlarging womb places pressure on the large veins thatreturn blood to the heart.What Helps?• Rest with your feet elevated.• Exercise daily.• Avoid tight-fitting clothes.• Avoid sitting for long periods of time, particularly withyour knees bent and your feet on the floor.• Massage your feet, legs, arms, and hands.• Soak your feet in a tub.• Limit your intake of salty foods such as potato chips andpretzels.If swelling becomes excessive, call your health care provider.URINARY TRACT INFECTIONSUrinary tract infections (UTI) are not uncommon during pregnancy. The growinguterus compresses the bladder, which can inhibit complete emptying. When urinestagnates in the bladder, it is easier for bacteria to grow. The composition ofurine becomes less acidic during pregnancy and contains higher levels ofhormones, predisposing you to bacterial infections. Untreated UTIs arepotentially dangerous for both the mother and the fetus.What Helps?• Drink plenty of fluids.• Drink cranberry juice, which has been shown to reduce theadherence of bacteria to the bladder lining.• Urinate frequently.• Wipe yourself from front to back to reduce the risk ofintroducing bacteria into the bladder.• Use cotton underwear. Cotton breathes easier than othermaterials.• If you have any burning or discomfort during urination, callyour health care provider.When to Call Your Health Care AdvisorAn open channel of communication between you and your health care provider is animportant component of a conscious pregnancy. You should have a low thresholdfor calling your doctor or midwife, as it is better to be overly cautious andlearn that your concern is a normal variation, than to be dismissive of asymptom that may be an important warning signal. The following are certain signsand symptoms that should be brought to the immediate attention of your healthcare provider:• vaginal bleeding• severe or persistent abdominal pain or cramping• severe headaches or blurred vision• shortness of breath or chest pain• swelling of your ankles, hands, or face• reduced urine output• burning or discomfort during urination• fever of 101° Fahrenheit or higher• fluid leaking from your vagina• an increased or foul-smelling vaginal discharge• a decrease in fetal movements• marked gain in weight• an increase in pelvic pressure before thirty-five weeks ofgestation• contractions occurring more than four times per hour• any other symptom that worries you or seems abnormal.ExerciseENVISIONING YOUR BODYHave your journal, some colored markers, and a pen nearby.Start by closing your eyes for a few minutes and connect to your body andbreath. Allow your awareness to journey through your body from the top of yourhead to your toes. Notice where you feel tight and where you feel open. Feelwhere your breath most easily moves. Stay with your breath for a few moments,inhaling and exhaling. Feel each breath bringing you nourishment and energy.As you sit, quietly feel how your belly is becoming rounder and fuller. Bringyour awareness to your belly and feel the sensations there. Feel your breath inyour belly and acknowledge how it feels to have your belly becoming rounder andyour body becoming fuller. Feel how your baby is being held and cradled safelyinside of your womb. Notice what it feels like to have a baby growing insideyour belly. Feel your breath rising and falling within you and notice yourfeelings about your body changing in shape and size.As you continue to feel your breath, allow your awareness to flow to yourgenitals and your breasts. Notice how you feel about yourself as a woman and howyou feel about your sexuality. With your next breath acknowledge yourself as themother of this tiny baby. Feel your connection to all mothers and to all women.Take as much time as you need to explore your sensations and feelings. When youfeel complete and ready, slowly open your eyes.Now retrieve your colored markers and draw a picture of your pregnant body. Forexample, you might want to mark where you feel tight and where you feel open inyour body. Pick a color to express how you are feeling in your belly and insideyour womb. Allow the picture to describe what you experience. Let go of the needto be a great artist and have fun.Take some time to journal about your picture and your feelings. Allow yourthoughts to flow freely without holding back anything. Release any judgment orcriticism about your feelings or sensations. Honor yourself completely.Enliven Through Your Attention• Place your hands on your belly a few times throughout the day and send lovingthoughts to your unborn baby.• Journal each day about your experiences.• Early in your pregnancy, plant a tree or flowering bush to symbolize thegrowth of your baby in the womb. After your child is born, you can take care ofthe plant together.• Read enchanting stories and heartfelt poetry aloud to your baby and listen tobeautiful, relaxing music each day.• Perform a daily oil massage on yourself before you bathe or shower.• Diffuse an aroma while listening to music, while soaking in a tub, or whilemeditating to create the association between the fragrance and the relaxed stateof awareness.• Ensure that you have all six tastes available during your meals throughout theday.• Choose to eat meals that are rich in color, aroma, and texture.• Be mindful as you eat your meals. Eat at least one meal each week in silencewith your full awareness.• Practice meditation for twenty to thirty minutes twice daily.• Pay attention to signals of stress that you experience during the day andemploy stress-reducing behaviors to minimize the harmful effects of stress onyou and your unborn baby.• Perform yoga postures with awareness on a regular basis, being gentle andrespectful of your body.• Embrace your pregnancy as an opportunity to experience more natural healingapproaches to common minor health concerns.• Whenever an uncomfortable symptom arises, go through a mental checklist toensure that you are taking time to relax, eating properly, drinking enoughfluids, and exercising regularly.• Develop an open line of communication with your health care provider and havea low threshold for calling about any emotional or physical concern that mayarise."},{"pageContent":"image [images/Chop_9780307237330_epub_054_r1.jpg]Partners in LoveYou are the seed of enchanted forests of mystical realms.Together we will nurture our desiresIn the sacred corridors of our souls.And one day these desires will burst into flame,And in the burnished glow,and sudden splendor of love,We will dream a new world of realityFrom the purity of our hearts.—DEEPAK CHOPRAimage [images/Chop_9780307237330_epub_101_r1.jpg]Each human being is woven from the genetic and behavioral threads of his or herparents. The relationship patterns that your child is exposed to, before andafter birth, shape her mental and physical well-being. Whether you and yourpartner create a traditional nuclear family or choose to explore one of theother modern variations in child rearing, developing your communication skillsis essential to a healthy and nourishing emotional life.Pregnancy is a landmark event in a couple’s relationship. When two people makethe choice to parent a child, both partners assume a new level ofresponsibility. In every relationship, there are times when needs andexpectations bring to the surface underlying emotional issues. Almost allpsychological disciplines acknowledge the presence of an inner emotional childin most chronologically adult human beings. When you create a baby, you willhave another inner child fully dependent upon you to meet her needs. For yourbenefit and the benefit of your family, we encourage you to use your pregnancyas an opportunity to heal unresolved emotional issues and improve yourcommunication skills.Pregnancy is a time of dynamic transformation with numerous physical andemotional challenges. It is normal and natural for parents to encounter a widerange of emotions during pregnancy. As mothers and fathers anticipate how a newbaby will change their lives, it is common to feel happiness as well asapprehension. Acknowledging, accepting, and embracing this ambivalence isimportant, because anything we resist persists, and eventually creates distress.Many years ago, Freud recognized that the inability to tolerate ambivalence wasthe root of neurosis. By recognizing and accepting the diverse feelings we havewithout judgment, we are better able to respond to challenges in ways thatreflect our highest values.In addition to emotions of excitement, enthusiasm, and joy that usuallypredominate, it is not uncommon for a pregnant woman to experience feelings ofanxiety, trepidation, and uneasiness. Among other issues, a mom-to-be may feelconcerned about her rapidly changing body shape, her wider-than-usual moodfluctuations, her ability to be a good parent, and changes in her career path.The father-to-be may be uneasy about losing his partner’s attention, herchanging sexual drive, his competence as a parent, and the financial costs ofraising a child.Acknowledging and developing the skills to express these darker emotions helpsyou free up creative energy that can otherwise be trapped in the denial of thesecompletely normal feelings. We frequently see pregnant couples at the ChopraCenter who are troubled by ambivalent feelings they have been afraid to express.When they learn that most people share these emotions, and that they are notdestined to be poor parents just because they have doubts or fears, a tremendousweight is removed from their hearts and their delight in the pregnancy is ableto shine through.Take a couple of minutes now to consider the various feelings, concerns, andquestions you have about becoming a parent and express them in your journal.Like the imagined monster in the closet that generates anxiety in the child whois carried away by her worst fears, your unspoken concerns are often the onesthat generate the most distressing emotions. Begin by acknowledging them toyourself, and then use your best communication skills to express your concernsto your partner. A couple that participated in one of our recent workshops foundtremendous relief by performing this simple exercise.Mom’s ResponsesCOMFORTABLE FEELINGS/ISSUESUNCOMFORTABLE FEELINGS/ISSUESI’m feeling really excited about becoming a mother.I’m conflicted about how much time I should take off from work.I love my big breasts.I am tired of this morning sickness.I’m feeling more connected to my older sister who has two children.Will everything go okay with my labor and birth?I like focusing on eating healthy foods.Am I gaining too much weight?Dad’s ResponsesCOMFORTABLE FEELINGS/ISSUESUNCOMFORTABLE FEELINGS/ISSUESI can’t wait to be a parent and share my love.I’m concerned that our small house will not be big enough for my family.I feel more connected than ever with my wife.I feel pressure about the cost of raising a family.My life seems to have more purpose as I think about my new family.Will my wife and I have any time alone together after the baby’s here?My wife seems gentler and more emotionally available.Although my wife’s been cuddly, she hasn’t had much interest in sex.When this couple had the opportunity to express their concerns in a safe andnonjudgmental exchange, each partner felt relief and deeper intimacy. Whenhearing the concerns of your partner, it is best to simply acknowledge themwithout attempting to “solve” the other person’s problem. Simply saying, “I canunderstand how you might have that concern,” or “Thanks for sharing yourconcerns with me,” is usually more effective than trying to convince the otherperson that their anxieties are unnecessary. Remember, ambivalence is a healthyaspect of human emotions. Acknowledging the dark side does not negate thepositive aspects.Waging PeaceWe all prefer environments that exude peace and harmony. Most of us do notwillingly go into a battle zone. An unborn baby is aware of her environment asshe grows inside the womb and responds to her mother’s feeling of comfort oragitation. The story of the family as told through both words and feelings islearned by the unborn baby long before birth. Put your attention on learning toheal upsets with your partner before your child arrives. Open your heart andclear any toxic emotions that may be residing there. Make your home a garden ofpeace so your baby will feel safe and cherished both before and after her firstbreath is taken. Allow your baby’s beginning to be innocent, harmonious, andfilled with wonder. Healthy, loving communication is its own reward in everyrelationship. Using your pregnancy as a catalyst to enhance a deeper connectionbetween you and your partner will reap benefits for all the members of yourfamily.The ABCs of EmotionEmotions engage both your mind and body. Emotions are distinguished from otherthoughts by the accompaniment of physical sensations. Emotions are primarymind-body experiences. If you hear that a company in your town is going out ofbusiness, it may transiently catch your interest. If it is the company that youor your spouse is employed by, it is likely that the information in your mindwill be accompanied by potent sensations in your body. We call these sensationsfeelings because we actually feel them in our physical body. When we uselanguage to characterize our emotions such as, “I felt like I was kicked in thestomach,” or “I felt my heart was breaking,” our words are describing thesensations generated in our bodies.Although our emotions come in many different flavors, they ultimately boil downto two primary feelings: comfort and discomfort. As a result of what you see andhear in your world, your body interprets the experience as being eithernourishing or threatening. All feelings are reducible to comfort or discomfort,pleasure or pain, happiness or sadness, or as novelist Tom Robbins once said,“Yum or yuck.” Whether you are consciously aware of it or not, every choice youmake is based upon your expectation that the choice will bring you greatercomfort and less discomfort. Every decision you make, from your order at arestaurant, to the style of shoes you buy, to the job you take, is based uponthe expectation that your choice will result in greater comfort or lessdiscomfort. Sometimes we are willing to endure immediate discomfort for theexpectation of longer-term comfort, such as when we exercise, undergo a medicalprocedure, or forgo dessert; but even these choices are ultimately based on thebelief that the anticipated long-term pleasure outweighs the short-term pain.Given the same circumstance or situation, different people have differentemotional reactions. If you are a pure vegetarian, being served a helping ofGrandma’s meatloaf will not elicit the pleasurable sensations that a meat eaterexperiences. Your teenager may experience intense pleasure listening to hip-hopmusic while it may give you a headache. Some people revel in the exhilaration ofa roller-coaster ride, while for others it would be a nightmare. It is not theinherent experience that generates feelings of comfort or discomfort; rather, itis your interpretation of the experience.Why does one person enjoy a scary horror movie while another relishes a romanticcomedy? The answer boils down to a simple principle that is obvious when youobserve children. What you will soon discover when your baby is born is thatfeelings derive from needs. When a child gets what she wants when she wants it,she feels comfortable. When she does not get what she wants, or gets what shedoesn’t want (like a bath or an early bedtime), she feels uncomfortable.Positive emotions arise when we feel that our needs are being met. Negativeemotions arise when we feel our needs are not being met.Conscious CommunicationThe more successful you are in meeting your needs, the more likely you are tospend time in states of emotional comfort. When it comes to interpersonalneeds—the needs we have in relation to the people in our lives—communication isthe most important determinant of need fulfillment. If you are skilled atcommunicating your needs, you are more likely to see them satisfied.Unfortunately, most people are not masters at communicating their needs.It is common for people to hold the idea that what they require is so obviousthat the other person should simply “know” what they want. Many have an unspokenexpectation that “If you really love me, you should be able to read my heart andmind, and give me what I need without me having to ask for it.” Most childrenactually enjoyed a period of time when this was the case. An infant child criesand an attentive mother urgently attempts to diagnose the need and fulfill it:“Is she cold? Is she hungry? Does she need her diaper changed? Is she tired andneeds a nap?” As people mature emotionally, they learn to meet more of their ownneeds and, ideally, learn to communicate effectively so others are able tounderstand and meet their needs. Because most people have never received formaleducation in communication, we would like to review a simple process that wehave found to be very helpful. Drawing upon the work of psychologist MarshallRosenberg, this process of conscious communication avoids wasting emotionalenergy on labels and judgments, and focuses on successful strategies to increasecomfort and decrease distress.There are five key questions that we encourage you to address whenever emotionalturbulence is activated in your body/mind: What is occurring to trigger myemotions? What emotions are arising within me? What do I need that I am notreceiving? What am I getting out of not having my needs met? What am I reallyasking for?We’ll review these questions one at a time in more detail.WHAT IS OCCURRING TO TRIGGER MY EMOTIONS?Situations in the present frequently remind us of similar circumstances from thepast, evoking memories and feelings that may have little to do with what isactually occurring now. For example, you may be driving on a trip with yourpartner who has fallen silent. This triggers a memory of your parents nottalking to each other for days at a time. As a result you say to your partner,“What are you angry about? Why are you being so cold to me?” Your partner issurprised and responds, “I was just thinking about how we can arrange the baby’sroom so it won’t feel too crowded.”It is very useful to separate out what you are seeing and hearing from yourinterpretation. In this example, after your partner did not speak for tenminutes, you interpreted this silence as anger or withholding. Begin to noticehow often you substitute your interpretations for your observations. Your doctordoes not return your call within an hour and you label him as uncaring. Yoursister arrives fifteen minutes after the time you were scheduled to meet forlunch and you judge her as selfish and narcissistic. Your partner talks toanother person at a party and you label it as flirting. Whether your analysis isaccurate or not, replacing your description of what is occurring with yourinterpretation rarely increases the likelihood that you will get your needs met.On some level, judgment always involves some rejection. People respond to thissubtle sense of rejection and become less willing and able to give you what youneed. Have the intention to avoid judging and see how you waste less time instates of emotional turbulence.WHAT EMOTIONS ARE ARISING WITHIN ME?As a consequence of something you saw or heard, emotions are activated. Developan expanded vocabulary of your emotions and you will find that uncomfortablefeelings dissipate much more quickly. If you are visiting a foreign land andhave a limited grasp of the native language, you become frustrated in yourefforts to communicate your needs. Since most people have limited emotionalvocabularies, they compound their unhappiness by their inability to express whatis happening inside them.In his insightful book Nonviolent Communication, Dr. Rosenberg points out thatcertain words we use to express our feelings increase our sense ofvictimization, and are therefore better avoided. When you say, “I feel . . .abandoned . . . neglected . . . rejected . . . abused . . . unappreciated . . .”or “manipulated,” you are holding other people accountable for your emotions andsetting up a situation where someone else has to change in order for you to feelbetter. If you are uncomfortable because you believe someone is manipulatingyou, they must stop their behavior in order for you to feel better. If you arewaiting for someone else to change in order for you to feel more comfortable, wehope you have a large reservoir of patience.Rather than relinquishing your power to external circumstances, we encourage youto own your feelings, and use language that reduces interpretation and conveysyour willingness to accept responsibility. Rather than saying, “When I saw youflirting, I felt abandoned by you,” try “When I saw you talking to that person,I felt anxious, jealous, and irritable.” Using language that conveys yourresponsibility for your feelings will reduce the likelihood that your partnerwill move into a reactive emotional mode, and increases the probability that youwill get your needs met.Practice expanding your emotional vocabulary so you do not resort to thelanguage of victimization. An alphabetical listing of suggested empowering wordsis presented below.AnxiousBitterConfusedDiscouragedEmptyFrustratedGuiltyHelplessInvisibleJealousLonelyMadNauseatedObstinatePessimisticQueasyResentfulSorryTiredUneasyWithdrawnWHAT DO I NEED THAT I AM NOT RECEIVING?If you are experiencing uncomfortable emotions, it is because you have a needthat is not being met. If you are not clear about what that need is, it isunlikely that someone else will be able to figure it out for you. Become clearabout what you seek and you will substantially increase your chances of gettingit.Needs can be seen from a variety of perspectives. According to Ayurveda, we havefour basic needs. We have a need for material comforts, known as Artha; we needlove and connection, known as Kama; we need a sense of purpose in life, known asDharma; and we need spiritual awakening, known as Moksha, or liberation.Whenever you feel emotionally upset, one of these needs is being threatened.Human beings need to maintain healthy ego boundaries. This means having thefreedom and personal power to say “no” when it is in your highest interest. Whenyour boundaries are healthy, you allow energy and information to move into yourlife when you believe it is nourishing but maintain appropriate defenses when anencounter carries potentially toxic consequences. Boundaries crossed withoutpermission create emotional pain.When you are in the midst of emotional turbulence, see if you can identify whatyou need that you are not getting or how your boundary was crossed without yourconsent. Then, see if there are other unspoken issues that are subconsciouslysabotaging your ability to meet your needs. This brings us to the next question.WHAT AM I GETTING OUT OF NOT HAVING MY OBVIOUS NEEDS MET?When we participate in situations that generate emotional conflict orturbulence, there is usually another conversation taking place within us at adeeper level of awareness. This realm of consciousness, commonly referred to asthe shadow, stirs up strong feelings because these deeper needs may be inconflict with those on the surface. Perhaps you believe that intense emotionsare necessary to keep a relationship alive and need conflict to generate theintensity. Perhaps you need more drama in your primary relationship because yourown life is lacking in passion. Perhaps your need for control or your need to be“right” exceeds your need for harmony. Perhaps, even as you consciously stateyour desire for greater intimacy, you create conflict because you are afraid ofthe vulnerability that the intimacy requires.If you find yourself in a pattern of recurrent conflict with your partner, askyourself what you might be getting out of the clashes. See if the currentsituation is reminiscent of earlier intimate relationships. Ask yourself ifthere are other issues, unrelated to the conflict, seeking expression. Quietyour mind, ask the questions, and see if any insight dawns.WHAT AM I REALLY ASKING FOR?Your chances of meeting your needs will be substantially enhanced if youformulate a request and ask for what you want. It is not uncommon to substitutea demand for a request, but outside the military this diminishes rather thanincreases the likelihood that your needs will be met. Making a request requiresa willingness to be vulnerable, because there is always the possibility ofhearing that dread word “No.” However, asking for a specific behavior that theperson is capable of performing increases the likelihood that you’ll get whatyou need.Don’t waste your energy asking for someone to think, believe, or feel a certainway. Rather than saying, “I just need for you to feel how much I am hurting,”try “Can you put your arms around me?” Rather than saying, “I need for you tospend more time with me,” try asking, “Can we meet for lunch tomorrow?” The morespecific you make your request, the more likely your need will be met and yourfeelings will change from uncomfortable to comfortable.You have an appointment with your obstetrician and ask your husband to meet youthere. He gets stuck in traffic and arrives twenty minutes after your visit hasstarted. You feel upset. Consider the following two scenarios of how you mightexpress yourself as you are leaving the doctor’s office.SCENARIO #1 SCENARIO #2WHAT IS OCCURRING TO TRIGGER MY EMOTIONS? “I can’t believe you were late. You’reso inconsiderate. Knowing you, you’ll probably miss the birth.” “I told you theappointment started at 10:30 and you arrived at 10:50.”WHAT EMOTIONS ARE ARISING WITHIN ME? “When you weren’t there at the start of myappointment, I felt abandoned by you. You’re never there when I needyou.” “When you weren’t there at the start of my appointment, I felt anxiousand insecure.”WHAT DO I NEED THAT I AM NOT RECEIVING? “You should know what I need. I needwhat every pregnant woman would need. I need you to be there for me.” “I needto feel that this baby is a high priority for you. I need for you to hear whatthe doctor says so we can discuss it. I need to feel your support throughout thepregnancy.”WHAT AM I GETTING OUT OF NOT HAVING MY NEEDS MET? “I’m not getting anything outof this argument. If you were a good husband you would be there by myside.” “Perhaps I need to blow off steam because I feel nervous and out ofcontrol in medical environments. Directing my frustration at my husband gives mea sense of control.”WHAT AM I REALLY ASKING FOR? “You need to be on time and make me feel safe ifwe’re going to make a family together.” “I feel nervous when I’m at thedoctor’s office without you. Can you promise me that at the next appointment youwill arrive on time?”Learning to communicate your needs more consciously increases the probabilitythat your needs will be met. It doesn’t mean that you will get everything thatyou want, but improving communication skills will improve the chances of gettingmore of what you seek. When both parties are committed to honestly expressingneeds in ways that make it possible for them to be fulfilled, everyone wins.Dealing with UpsetsEven with the best communication skills, normal, healthy people get upset. Therewill be frequent times when your needs are not met exactly as you would chooseand your ego boundaries are crossed without your permission. It is unrealisticto expect that you will completely avoid emotional turbulence, but it isrealistic to expect that you can regain your emotional center more quickly byusing tools to digest emotionally charged experiences. Keeping the emotionalbody clear is essential to good health. People tend to hold on to emotionalhurts, betrayals, and disappointments, because they have not been taughteffective ways to deal with them. As a result of trying to suppress the painassociated with emotional wounding, many do not experience the joy and vitalitythey would like.Undigested emotions, like undigested food, result in the accumulation oftoxicity in our physiology. We offer seven steps for releasing emotionaltoxicity.1. Take responsibility for what you are feeling. When you find yourself reactingemotionally to other people, it is usually because they are reflecting somequality that you have not fully acknowledged about your own nature. Acceptresponsibility for your emotions and you will cease to be a bundle ofconditioned reflexes, which makes you vulnerable to the opinions of every personyou encounter. When you find yourself in a reactive mode with someone, ask thequestion “What can I learn about myself from this experience?” See if you canidentify in the other person a quality you feel upset about, which you have beendenying in yourself. This is the Mirror of Relationships principle: “Those welove and those we hate are both mirrors of ourselves.”2. Identify the emotion. “Ifeel   .” It may be angry,sad, hurt, jealous, lonely, etc. As clearly as possible, define and describewhat you are feeling, avoiding language that encourages a sense ofvictimization.3. Witness the feeling in your body. Emotions are thoughts associated withphysical sensations. Upsetting thoughts trigger uncomfortable bodily reactions.The chemistry associated with emotions has a life of its own that must beacknowledged before the emotion can be processed further. Just observe thefeeling, allowing your attention to embrace the sensation. By simplyexperiencing the physical sensations, you’ll find the charge of the emotiondissipates.4. Express your emotions privately to yourself. Write about your feelings in ajournal you keep just for this purpose. Use the five questions elaborated aboveto explore the meaning of the emotional upset. Allow memories of similarsituations to come to the surface and write about them, too. Use language thataccurately conveys what you are feeling. Allow yourself to express all that youneed to about the situation.5. Release the emotion through some ritual. Physical movement is usually bestfor this. Go for a walk, dance, swim, or perform yoga with deep-breathingexercises. Allow your body to discharge the emotional tension from yourphysiology.6. Share the emotion with the person involved in the situation once you feelmore centered. If you have gone through steps 1 through 5, it should be possibleto share your feelings without casting blame, expecting pity, or trying to makethe other person feel guilty.7. Rejuvenate! If you’ve gone through steps 1 through 6, you deserve to berewarded—so reward yourself for your good work. Do something nice for yourself.Get a massage, listen to music, buy yourself a present, eat a deliciousmeal—nourish yourself.Conscious ListeningOne of the most important communication skills you can develop is that ofconscious listening. Often when someone shares a concern, the other person feelsthe need to fix the problem. In the attempt to be helpful, a response may beformulated even before the issue has been fully communicated. More often thannot, the person is not seeking suggestions on how to fix the problem as much assimply needing to be heard. Listening attentively to another’s concerns, insteadof immediately trying to make it better, cultivates feelings of being understoodand facilitates resolution of the problem. See if you can agree to the following“rules of engagement” with your partner.• We take turns being the one who expresses and the one who listens.• When I am the expresser, I use language such as “I feel . . .” rather than“You made me feel . . .”• As the listener, I demonstrate my attention through my expressions andgestures and by repeating what I have heard from you.• We make the commitment to have regular conscious communication sessions witheach other. We will reward each other for successful listening sessions—goingfor walks, taking a bubble bath together, going out for romantic dinners, givingeach other massages, making love.Enliven Through Your Attention• Place your hands on your belly a few times throughout the day and send lovingthoughts to your unborn baby.• Journal each day about your experiences.• Early in your pregnancy, plant a tree or flowering bush to symbolize thegrowth of your baby in the womb. After your child is born, you can take care ofthe plant together.• Read enchanting stories and heartfelt poetry aloud to your baby and listen tobeautiful, relaxing music each day.• Perform a daily oil massage on yourself before you bathe or shower.• Diffuse an aroma while listening to music, while soaking in a tub, or whilemeditating to create the association between the fragrance and the relaxed stateof awareness.• Ensure that you have all six tastes available during your meals throughout theday.• Choose to eat meals that are rich in color, aroma, and texture.• Be mindful as you eat your meals. Eat at least one meal each week in silencewith your full awareness.• Practice meditation for twenty to thirty minutes twice daily.• Pay attention to signals of stress that you experience during the day andemploy stress-reducing behaviors to minimize the harmful effects of stress onyou and your unborn baby.• Perform yoga postures with awareness on a regular basis, being gentle andrespectful of your body.• Embrace your pregnancy as an opportunity to experience more natural healingapproaches to common minor health concerns.• Whenever an uncomfortable symptom arises, go through a mental checklist toensure that you are taking time to relax, eating properly, drinking enoughfluids, and exercising regularly.• Develop an open line of communication with your health care provider and havea low threshold for calling about any emotional or physical concern that mayarise.• Commit to improving your conscious communication skills. When you are feelingupset, determine what you really need and ask for the behavior that will fulfillyour need.• Practice the seven steps for emotional clearing when you are experiencingemotional turbulence. Notice how empowering the process can be when you takeresponsibility for your feelings.• Whenever you are finding it difficult to communicate with your partner aboutyour feelings, create the opportunity to practice conscious listening."},{"pageContent":"image [images/Chop_9780307237330_epub_055_r1.jpg]The Birthing JourneyOur deepest fear is not that we are inadequate.Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.It is our light, not our darkness, that most frightens us. . . .And as we let our own light shine,We unconsciously give other peoplePermission to do the same.As we are liberated from our own fear,Our presence automatically liberates others.—MARIANNE WILLIAMSONimage [images/Chop_9780307237330_epub_101_r1.jpg]We believe that pregnancy and birth are natural processes and that wheneverpossible, less medical intervention is preferable to more. We also recognize andsupport the reality that each birth is a very personal event, reflecting theperceptions, beliefs, experiences, and choices of the pregnant mom. Our bottomline is that the ultimate measurement of a successful pregnancy and birth is nothow much or how little technological intervention is brought to bear; rather, itis a birth that results in the healthiest possible baby and mom.You have spent the past nine months preparing for this momentous event. Yourregular meditation practice has established your connection to the essence ofyour being—your spirit that is beyond time and space. Yoga has helped youdevelop flexibility in both your mind and body. You have used soothing aromas tocreate the association between your sense of smell and relaxation. Your dailymassage has ensured that your tissues are lubricated and pliable. You haveworked with your breath and experienced how it can bring you into a deep placeof inner quietness. You are prepared in your body, mind, and spirit to birthyour baby.Birthing a baby is probably the most powerful physical and emotional experienceof a woman’s life. After nine months of development, your unborn baby is readyto leave the loving cocoon of your womb and enter the world through your body. Aconscious birth recognizes and honors the spiritual significance of bringingthis being into the world. Working in consort with the powerful forces ofnature, you give birth to your baby.Conception, pregnancy, and childbirth are natural events, which express life’screative power on physical, emotional, and spiritual levels. Your and yourfamily’s perceptions, interpretations, and expectations play an important rolein achieving a successful birthing experience. We believe you should beempowered with knowledge that enables you to make informed choices regarding thelabor and birth of your baby.Understanding life as an expression of a deeper non-local field of intelligencehas profound effects on the way in which you experience yourself and others.Living your life from a consciousness-based perspective implies that you viewevery aspect of your life as meaningful, even sacred. A consciousness-basedapproach applied to pregnancy and birth means that the vision of your baby-to-beencompasses physical, emotional, and spiritual domains.Whatever your powerful mind believes will come to pass.—PARAMHANSA YOGANANDAAwaken to the beauty and power inside your body. Pregnancy and labor are timesto turn within. They are times of profound transition and transformation. Whiletraveling this journey you are required to embrace fear and trepidation alongwith wisdom and strength. Each stage of labor brings growth and change.Exploring Your FearsAs a woman, you have been accumulating ideas about birthing since yourchildhood. You may have observed your mother pregnant with a younger sibling andher changing body and mind. You probably heard stories about labor and birth andmay have seen movies of women in labor. You may have been present at the birthof a younger sibling, niece, or nephew.At time these stories and images may have portrayed the birthing process asagonizing. If you have been exposed to frightening birthing stories, you mayfear that labor will cause unbearable pain and be terrified at the thought oflosing control. If these are the deep-rooted messages you have accepted, you maythink of labor as an experience you need to be rescued from rather than one thatempowers you. Fear of pain has resulted in many women losing sight of birth asnormal and natural, and of themselves as powerful and capable. Labor is anopportunity for women to learn about themselves and discover the strength andwisdom inherent in their bodies.Facing Your FearsBringing unconscious fears out into the open is the best way to dissipate theinfluence they have over you. Like the boogeyman you may have imagined living inyour closet as a child, most fears lose their power when exposed to the light ofawareness. We encourage you to perform the following exercise to become moreaware of the positive and negative thoughts, words, and images about labor andbirth that dwell within your mind. Becoming more aware of your innerconversation about birthing will enable you to make more conscious choices thataccurately reflect your values.ExerciseSit for a few minutes with your eyes closed and envision the process of givingbirth to your baby. Imagine the process from the first contractions to holdingyour baby in your arms.Now, focus on your concerns. What are you afraid of with regard to labor andbirth? On a sheet of paper write down the fearful words that come to mind.Once you have listed these words describing your anxiety, take a few moments tocreate a separate list describing the feelings these expressions generate withinyour body (these fearful words generate the following emotions and sensationswithin me).Now, again, close your eyes and envision your labor and birth. This time focuson your positive expectations. Make a list of the empowering words that comeinto your mind when you think about labor and birth.As you review these positive empowering words, describe the feelings that thesewords generate (these empowering words generate the following emotions andsensations within me).It is completely natural when thinking about labor to have feelings of both fearand excitement. Wisdom is recognizing that life involves the coexistence ofopposites. When a woman surrounds herself with supportive people and creates asafe space around her, she is able to connect with her inner wisdom. By settingaside self-judgment, you can embrace your strength and your vulnerability, yourdetermination and your inclination to surrender.Stay present to your body and your baby. A conscious birth can be medicated orunmedicated, in a hospital or at home, by cesarean or vaginal birth. It is yourpowerful, beautiful body that is opening to bring new life into the world.Accept the power that comes from recognizing that your body is an inextricableexpression of the universal body. Your mind is a reflection of the cosmic mind.In your willingness to accept the contradictions of birthing a new baby, yougain the opportunity to participate fully in the age-old experience of givingbirth to a new life. You are participating in the primordial creative event andwill look back on this experience with awe and wonder for the rest of your life.ExerciseDraw a figure image of yourself as a powerful birthing woman. Show your facialexpression and the position you imagine yourself to be in when you birth yourbaby.Write the words from your empowering word list many times around the portrait ofyourself as a powerful birthing woman. Add whatever additional words you choosefrom your fearful list, one time each. Hang this picture somewhere in your homewhere you will see it regularly.Checklist for a Conscious BirthCheck to see if you are completely comfortable with the following aspects ofyour birthing experience. If you recognize there is more work required on yourpart to feel fully prepared, commit to taking the steps to be as ready aspossible for your labor and birth.• I have all the information I need about my birthing site.• I am aware of and capable of expressing my fears and concerns to my healthprovider, family, and self.• I have identified and enrolled my support crew.• I deeply trust the people who will be supporting me during labor and birth.• I recognize and accept the fact that there will be times during my labor whenI will need to relinquish control of the situation.• I know it is okay to be noisy during childbirth.• I know I can work with my body during contractions.• I know my health care provider will work with me to help create the birth Idesire.• I know I can request pain medications if I need them.ExerciseSitting quietly with your eyes closed, center your awareness in the region ofyour heart. After a few minutes of silence, begin asking yourself the question“What more do I need in order to be fully present and connected to my birthingprocess?” Continue repeating this question, listening to the messages thatemerge from your inner mind. The more innocently you can listen for rather thanforce a response, the more readily your inner wisdom will make itself known.Take some time to reflect and journal about what you learned.The Birthing ExperienceA woman learns many things about herself during the amazing process of pregnancyand birth. As you reach the end of your pregnancy, approaching labor and birth,envision the process as you would ideally like it to unfold. Seek out theinformation you need to make fully informed choices.Imagine yourself standing at the bottom of a mountain with two paths to the top.One path takes you to a chairlift that goes up the mountain, while the otherpath leads to a hiking trail. Both will get you to the top of the mountain, andeach provides you with a unique and memorable experience. The chairlift providesan enjoyable and thrilling ride with little effort or pain. On the chairlift,you will be looking down at the experience and enjoying the scenery. The hike upwill be strenuous and challenging, as you are intensely involved with everyaspect of the journey. Upon reaching the summit, you will experience a sense ofaccomplishment.These are, of course, metaphors for labor. One woman may relish the challenge ofgiving birth naturally. Another may have no qualms about taking full advantageof modern medical technology. A third woman may be conflicted about the rightpath for her. The key is to make your choice consciously by using all theinformation you have gathered, while remaining open to the possibility thatsometimes the birthing process takes on a life of its own. There is an Ayurvedicexpression that goes “Infinite flexibility is the secret to immortality.” Weencourage you to have clear intentions for your birth while remaining flexibleto all possibilities.ExerciseThink about your ideal labor. Think about yourself in labor.Is there a difference between the ideal labor and envisioning yourself in labor?Write a few sentences about what you discover. What more would you need tocreate your ideal labor?Moving Through LaborAs you approach the final stages of pregnancy you will naturally have manyquestions about labor and birth. These are some of the common ones:How will my contractions feel? Can I handle the pain? How long will I be inlabor? Will my partner support me? Will I know how to breathe? Can I trust mybody? Will I require medication? Will I need an epidural? Will I have anepisiotomy? Will I be able to birth my baby vaginally? Will I need a cesarean?Will my baby be okay?In this chapter we will explore the process of labor and its many variations tohelp you prepare for the many possible answers to the many questions in yourmind. Let’s begin with an overview of the stages of labor.First Stage of LaborThe onset of progressive mild contractions signals the beginning of the firststage of labor. Each woman experiences these contractions differently. They aremild for some and more intense for others. As the muscles of your uteruscontract, the cervix begins to thin (efface) and open (dilate) so your baby canpass through it. During this stage your body will release endorphins to helpreduce the sensations of pain as contractions become stronger and closertogether.During early labor your cervix will dilate from 0 to 4 centimeters as a resultof mild to moderate contractions. These typically last thirty to sixty secondsand may be five to twenty minutes apart. The rest period between contractionsvaries, lasting from several hours to a day or more.Perform your normal activities for as long as possible during this period. If itis nighttime, see if you can sleep. You will help your labor to progress byalternating between periods of rest and movement. Trust your instincts to guideyou. Relax and follow with your breath. Take walks outdoors or relax in a warmaroma bath if your water has not broken.As labor progresses into the active phase, uterine contractions increase instrength and duration, lasting about sixty seconds and occurring every two tofive minutes. During this stage your cervix dilates from 4 to 8 centimeters. Asyour cervix dilates your baby descends into the pelvic cavity. Contractionsbecome more intense and consume most of your attention. Your awareness shiftsinward as your body works harder to open. Endorphins continue to be releasedthroughout your body and your consciousness may slip into an “endorphin haze.”Prepare ahead of time to surround yourself with people who believe in you, sothat you are surrounded by safety and love. Breathing, walking, changingpositions, making sound, being held, and getting in water will all help you stayas centered as possible.During the transition phase your cervix fully opens as your body prepares tobirth your baby. During this phase the sensations in your body become muchstronger and more intense. You may feel very vulnerable and doubt that you cango on. The contractions are faster and stronger now as your uterus works to openyour cervix from 8 to 10 centimeters. Each contraction may last up to twominutes and occur as frequently as every minute. You may feel you cannot survivethe intense experience in one second and then be completely absorbed in it thenext. You are at the threshold of bringing your baby into the world.Second StageThe second stage begins when the cervix is fully dilated at about 10 centimetersand ends when your baby is born. During this stage your contractions willprobably slow down a bit and become less intense, occurring about every threeminutes and lasting sixty to ninety seconds. Each contraction helps move yourbaby down through your birth canal toward your pelvic floor. The urge to pushwith these contractions may begin before you are fully dilated or it may startfive to ten minutes later, although some women never feel a strong urge to push.CERVICAL DILATION CHARTimage [images/Chop_9780307237330_epub_021_r1.jpg]The sensations of these contractions are powerful. Tiny receptors in thecervical tissues alert your body to release oxytocin in this stage, whichfacilitates these contractions continuing. The purpose of the contractionsshifts from opening your cervix to pushing out your baby. It is common to shiftfrom feelings of exhilaration to exhaustion and back again during this stage.Work with your uterus by bearing down when you feel the urge. Follow the signalsfrom your body and take your time. Have the intention to relax and soften yourpelvic floor muscles with each push.UNDERSTANDING CONTRACTIONSEach uterine contraction begins at the top of your uterus (fundus), where thereis the greatest number of muscle cells. The contraction moves down through thecenter of your uterus toward your cervix. Throughout labor the upper portion ofthe uterus is more active and contracts more intensely for a longer period oftime than the lower portion of the uterus. The upper uterine segment becomesthicker, while the more passive lower segment becomes thinner.Contractions are typically mild in early labor and become progressively strongerthrough active labor and transition. The pain from contractions is due in partto the reduced availability of oxygen to contracted muscle cells, and to thecompression of nerves in the lower uterine segment as the cervix is stretchedopen.Contractions are the primary power behind the work of labor and birth. You canthink of them as waves that start at a lull, build up to a peak, and slowly comeback down. They form a regular pattern throughout labor with rest periods inbetween. The rest periods are important for the laboring woman as well as theunborn baby. Blood flow from the placenta to the womb diminishes with eachcontraction, but rapidly returns to normal during each rest period. When a womanlearns to relax and breathe during rest periods, her baby receives essentialnourishment and oxygen.ExerciseSIMULATING A CONTRACTIONAllow about ten minutes for this exercise. Sit comfortably on the edge of afolded blanket or pillow. Turn on some soothing music and have a clock with asecond hand in sight. Now, close your eyes and focus on your breath. Feel thespace inside your body and see if you can find your center. Observe your breathentering and leaving your body. Once you have observed your breath for a fewcycles, extend your arms out to your sides at about shoulder height with yourpalms facing down. Begin to flap your arms up and down a few inches about everysecond or two, keeping your shoulders as soft as you can. Send sound throughyour body as you breathe out, consciously relaxing the muscles that are notrequired to perform the exercise. Breathe out through your mouth on yourexhalations. Notice what happens to your mind as your arms begin to tire. Keepcoming back to your breath and use your sounds. After ninety seconds rest yourarms at your sides for about a minute, then repeat the flapping for anotherninety seconds. Notice what helps you to relax during the rest periods. Rememberto take long, easy breaths to nourish and oxygenate you and your baby. Continuefor five to ten cycles, extending and flapping your arms for ninety seconds andthen resting for a minute.CROWNINGOnce your baby’s head slides under your pubic bone, your perineum will begin tostretch and bulge around your baby’s head. This is known as crowning. You mayfeel a burning sensation, sometimes referred to as “the ring of fire,” as aresult of the tissues stretching. The burning sensation will subside within afew minutes as the pressure from your baby’s head numbs the nerves in yourperineum. This feeling is a signal for you to slow down your pushing and beginto ease your baby out slowly. Another push or two and your baby’s head will beout of your body. At this point, your baby will turn so that his shoulders canpass under your pubic bone. Your doctor or birthing assistant may help tomaneuver your baby’s body. Once your baby’s shoulders are free, he will slideout of your body and into the world.PREPARING YOUR PERINEUMMassaging your perineum with oil weeks before your birth date may help softenthe tissues. Use only natural vegetable-based oils, such as sesame, almond, orcoconut. During labor, explore different positions that feel comfortable for youand that allow you to stay centered during the final phase of birth. Communicateyour needs to your health provider and support team. If it is comfortable, yourpartner can apply warm cloths with gentle pressure to your perineum duringcrowning, which may help reduce the chances of your perineal tissues tearing asthey stretch. Ask your partner or health care provider to lubricate yourperineum with warm oil as your baby is crowning. Push gently to slowly ease yourbaby out of your body, and if possible, reach down to feel his head so you canstay connected as he emerges from your body.BIRTHING YOUR BABYYour body has protected your baby for nine months inside your womb. As he movesthrough you into the world, do your best to keep him feeling safe, warm, andprotected. Have the lights turned down low to give his eyes time to adjust. Keepthe room warm so he feels comfortable. Surround him with soft sounds andpleasing aromas. Have him placed immediately on your belly or bring him intoyour arms so he continues to feel your loving presence. Talk softly to him sothat he knows you are there and he is safe. Postpone any necessary invasiveprocedures for as long as possible.Third StageThe surge of emotions you feel holding your newborn baby encourages the releaseof hormones that stimulate your uterus to contract so you can birth theplacenta. Take your time. The umbilical cord and placenta will continue to pulseand bring oxygen to your baby while he is learning to take his first breaths.The cord can be clamped and cut once it has stopped pulsing. After the birth ofyour baby the placenta begins to slowly separate from your uterine wall. Thisusually takes about ten to thirty minutes but can sometimes take longer. In ashort time your uterus will begin contracting to expel the placenta. Theplacenta is much smaller than your baby and it usually feels good to push it outof your body.After You Give BirthYou will have gone through one of the most intense experiences of your life. Youwill have worked hard for many long hours or even days to bring your baby intothe world. You will probably be feeling sweaty, sticky, bloody, exhausted, andecstatic. Your whole being has been engaged in your baby’s birth. Plan ahead tohave someone available for you in the first minutes and hours after birth tonurture and protect you. It will take some time for you to recover from therigors of labor and begin feeling centered again. Your focus shifts fromnurturing your baby on the inside to nurturing your baby on the outside. Youwill need some nutritious food, something replenishing to drink, and a warmwashcloth to wipe your face and body.Strengthening the BondIn many cultures around the world (and increasingly in the West) babies areplaced on their mothers’ bellies immediately after birth so Mother and Baby canfeel, smell, and touch each other. Parents and babies are meant to be togetherfrom birth. Research has shown that important bonding begins within the firstminutes and hours after birth, as parents and babies connect with each otherthrough holding, talking, seeing, and touching.The minutes and hours after birth are magical. Most new parents have difficultyfinding the words to describe the depth and intensity of their feelings as theyinteract with their baby for the first time. As you hold your baby and look intohis eyes, you will find yourself falling in love and not wanting to let him go.During the first couple of hours your baby will settle into a “quiet alertstate” as he transitions from the womb to the world. He will be awake with hiseyes open. After a few hours he will settle into a deep sleep period. Regardlessof where you are giving birth, do your best to be with your baby during thefirst hour or two after birth so you can enjoy these earliest preciousexperiences with your baby.Recording Your ExperienceIf you have the energy during a quiet moment, journal your experiences of laborand birth while they are fresh in your mind. Not only will you enjoy readingthese early impressions later on, but years from now your child will have accessto your most intimate thoughts and feelings around his arrival. The following isan example of a woman’s record of her birthing experience.The pain of birth is in a completely different category than a broken arm or atoothache. As I journeyed through labor I knew that I was supposed to be feelingthese sensations. They were unlike anything I had ever experienced before. Ifelt like I was working with my body from the first contractions, and as theybecame stronger, I drifted deeper inside myself. Although I maintainedawareness, my mind became completely quiet, and I felt immersed in my ownfamiliar semidarkness.As I was breathing and moaning, the sounds felt as if they were coming from adeep ancient place inside me. I was on my hands and knees and immersed in warmwater. I was able to relax between contractions and let my head hang forward.Sometimes the contractions felt overwhelming and I would moan louder and deeperto release them. I was working hard to stay with the sensations of my body.Opening, breathing, and resting, my body and mind were one. My inner space wasmy whole reality. I moved and swayed in whatever way felt good.After a while the contractions got harder and I used my breath and moans to staywith it. As the sensations intensified I started to feel like maybe I couldn’tdo it. I leaned into the support of my partner and swayed from side to side withmy body. My whole being became the contraction.And then it was time to push. At first little pushes and then all of me waspushing, pushing my baby down through my body. My body was making way. I heardmyself moaning. I reached down to feel for my baby’s head and there it was,bulging from my body. There was a burning sensation and I breathed into it andthen with the next push my baby’s head was out, and I was holding and feeling itin my hands. It was so soft and round. My eyes were still closed and I was deepinside feeling everything. I pushed again and my baby came sliding out of me. Iopened my eyes and reached down to bring her up into my arms. My eyes closedagain. Still deep in the experience I heard my partner say with complete awe anddelight, “Oh my God, oh my God! She’s here!”Preparing YourselfLabor and birth are intense experiences, and having some anxiety as you prepareto birth your baby is completely natural. Acknowledging fears and doubts helpsdissipate the power they have over you. Take a few moments now to feel your bodyand see if you can identify uncomfortable sensations and notice where you areholding apprehension and worry. With your attention on these sensations, useyour words to bring to the surface the trepidations you are feeling. Make threelists in your journal, one for the things you are worried about, one for thethings you are uncertain about, and one for the things you are doubtful about.Fear sets into motion the physiology of stress resulting in the release of thepowerful chemicals of the fight-or-flight response. Neither the impulse to fightnor the one to run from your contractions serves you well during labor. Thehormones of stress constrict the arteries to the uterus and reduce theeffectiveness of your contractions. The physiology of fear also has been shownto lower your threshold for pain. Learning to bring yourself from a state ofapprehension to one of inner centeredness is a valuable skill that will be oftremendous benefit to you during your birthing experience and throughout yourlife. Fortunately, you have a precious ally to accomplish this, which is yourbreath. When you feel out of control, you can come back to your center throughconscious breathing.Using Your BreathBreathing is the bridge between your mind, body, and baby. As you inhale deeply,you bring nourishment and oxygen into your and your baby’s body. As you exhale,you release carbon dioxide and stress. The nourishment of your breath movesdeeply into each of your cells and promotes relaxation. Deep, slow breathing canhelp you release tension from every part of your body. During labor your breathwill be your intimate friend, helping you to stay centered, calm, and energized.These following exercises have been created to bring you a greater awareness ofyour breath. Become familiar with these simple breathing techniques, which helpintegrate your mind and body. Choose the exercises that feel right for you andpractice them for five to ten minutes per day.Breathing Exercise #1ENTRY AND EXIT POINTAs you inhale, imagine your breath as a relaxing mist, calmly coming into yourbody and filling you with oxygen and nourishment.As you exhale, imagine your breath releasing slowly down through your body. Feelit helping you to let go of tightness, pain, and tension as it flows out throughyou. Focus on long, slow exhalations.Now imagine that you have nostrils somewhere on your belly. Let these imaginarynostrils be your entry and exit point. Close your eyes and rest your hands onyour belly. For the next few minutes focus on breathing in and out through yourbelly nostrils. Allow each in-breath to enter and fill your belly, encirclingyour baby. As you breathe out, feel your belly muscles soften and allow eachout-breath to be long and slow, releasing tension and tightness from your body.Now imagine your entry and exit point to be your pelvic floor. Closing youreyes, breathe in through your pelvic floor and feel your breath flowing upthrough your body. Allow it to fill your belly, chest, lungs, and brain with anourishing mist. As you exhale, allow your breath to gently release and slowlyspread down through your body, removing any tension and softening your pelvicfloor as it flows out.Now imagine your entry nostrils to be in a place where you feel most grounded inyour body. Let your exit point be through your mouth. As you breathe in, sendyour breath up through your body toward your throat. As you breathe out, feelthe vibration of your breath flowing along your throat and release it with asigh. Allow your neck and head to hang forward. Soften your shoulders and feelyour body becoming loose and limp. Be aware of your chest relaxing and let yourbelly muscles release.Try envisioning your entry nostrils at the base of your spine and your exitnostrils at the crown of your head. Bring your breath in through the base ofyour tailbone and let it slowly flow up along your spine, through the back ofyour neck, along your head to your crown. As you breath out, send your breathslowly down through your center. Feel it pass through your heart, allowing it toflow around your baby and out your pelvic floor. Focus on long, slowexhalations.Breathing Exercise #2ENERGY BREATHThis breath helps bring energy into your body and is beneficial anytime you feelfatigued. It can be helpful throughout the pushing stage of labor and at anyother times when you feel tired or need more energy.As your mind quiets, your body takes over.As you inhale, imagine your breath to be pure energy entering and filling everycell in your body. Envision each cell tapping from this source the vital energyas your breath expands inside you. As you exhale, allow this energy to flowthrough you, feeling it revitalize every cell, tissue, and organ in your body.Breathing Exercise #3SLOWING DOWNClose your eyes and take a few minutes to follow and feel your breath as itmoves in and out of your body. After a few minutes, have the intention for yourbreathing to slow down. Do not force any change in your breath. With eachinhalation silently repeat the word “slow.” With each exhalation, think the word“down.” Continue to breathe like this for five to ten minutes, as you mentallyrepeat the words, “slow down . . . slow down . . . slow down.”Breathing Exercise #4COUNTING BACKWARDClose your eyes and focus on your breath. With each successive inhalation, countbackward from 10 to 1. With each exhalation breath, bring an empowering oraffirming word into your mind. For example, it may go like this:10 . . . centering 9 . . . relaxing 8 . . . releasing 7 . . . opening 6 . . . accepting 5 . . . surrendering 4 . . . trusting 3 . . . succeeding 2 . . . empowering 1 . . . allowingChoose the words that work for you. You’ll find that this process quickly bringsyou back when your mind begins to race with apprehensions and concerns.Breathing Exercise #5HEAD TO TOECreate a space for yourself with blankets or pillows where you can comfortablylie down. Once you are comfortable, close your eyes and allow your body to beginto relax. Feel your breath moving through you. On your next inhalation bringyour breath up through the bottoms of your feet to the top of your head. As youexhale, scan your body from your head to your toes, releasing any tension youmay be retaining as you breath out. Repeat this process for five to ten minutes.Breathing Exercise #6BREATHING WITH SOUNDMaking sounds can help your body relax and open. Moaning, sighing, or groaningwith the outflow of your breath creates a soothing vibration that moves throughand resonates with your whole body. Find a tone or sound that feels right foryou. Many women choose an “ahhh” sound to start. As you exhale, allow yourbreath to vibrate along your throat and resonate down through your body and outyour pelvic floor. Focus on long and slow exhalations. Try sounds that are lowpitched and deeply resonant. Continue for five to ten minutes, trying differentsounds.Practice moaning. Let yourself moan. Moaning feels great when you are in labor.There are no fixed rules. There is no one who is going to tell you that youcannot make noise. When contractions get strong, allow yourself to moan andgroan. Let it be soft and let it be loud. Close your eyes and go with the sound.Let it feel primitive and let it feel real. Let it be deep and let it feelright. Let it infuse you and let it absorb you. Let it help you open and let ithelp you soften. Let it help you release and let it help you sink inside. Let ithelp you move your baby down and let it help you move your baby through.Staying in TouchThe sense of touch is one of the most important sensory portals to your innerpharmacy. Conscious, nourishing touch can reduce discomfort and calm anxiety. Weencourage you to experiment with different touching techniques to learn whichones are most comforting for you.Your birth partner will be an essential ally to help you stay centered. Explorea variety of styles and pressures with your spouse or partner so you cancommunicate your needs during labor.SOFT HANDSCreate a space with blankets and pillows where you can comfortably lie down withyour partner sitting beside you. Close your eyes and focus on your breath. Aftera little while, have your partner gently place his hands over your heart. Thetouch should be calming and reassuring. As your partner gently lays his hands onyou, allow your awareness to receive the love and nurturing that is being sentto you through his hands.After a few minutes, have your partner move his hands to your belly. As theygently rest on your body, synchronize your breathing together and allowsoothing, calming energy to flow from his hands into your body.Now have your partner place his hands on your head and repeat the process againfor several minutes. If there are other places in your body that you would liketo be touched, tell your partner to place his hands there. Make a mental note ofthose places that feel most comforting for you.Try reversing roles with your partner so you are doing the touching and he is onthe receiving end. Touch him in the way that you would like to be touched. Teachyour partner how he can be of greatest help to you.LIGHT TOUCHConstance Palinsky developed this light-touch technique during her research intopain management and relaxation. It can be used to reduce discomfort in labor andenhance relaxation by invoking pleasure through the surface of the skin. Thelight-touch technique can also normalize heart rate and blood pressure.Light touch involves a featherlike massage that may cause goosebumps to arise.Research has shown that this technique enhances the release of oxytocin, thehormone that facilitates labor.Practice this light-touch massage with your partner during the last month ofpregnancy. Notice how it supports deep relaxation and helps you and your partnerdeepen your connection in preparation for labor.To practice, lie down with your partner sitting comfortably beside you. After afew moments with your eyes closed, your partner begins stroking the innersurface of your arm from your hand to your underarm. The stroke is very lightand is done with either fingernails or fingertips.After about five minutes, have your partner switch to the other arm. Althoughthe light touch is on the arms, you will find that it has a relaxing effect onyour whole body. This technique can also be applied to other parts of the body,including the palms of the hands, the neck and shoulders, and the thighs.The light-touch technique is very effective when applied to the back. Lie onyour side or in Child’s Pose leaning over a few pillows. Beginning at your neck,your partner strokes you in a V formation outward from the neck down the backtoward the outer edges of the ribs. The strokes continue the entire way down theback to the sacrum. Relax and enjoy the sensations.Your partner can deepen the calming effect by offer-ing relaxing suggestions ashe is lightly stroking you. For example, he might say, “As I stroke your arm,allow your body to soften and relax,” or “As you feel each stroke, imaginepain-relieving endorphins releasing and flowing through you.”Lower-Back CounterpressureAs the baby moves deeper into the pelvis during labor, women often experiencelow-back pressure or deep aching in the lower back. Lower-back discomfort mayincrease during contractions due to traction on the broad ligaments of theuterus attached to the lower spine. Massage and counterpressure may help to easethis discomfort.Practice this procedure during the last few weeks of pregnancy so both you andyour partner are familiar with the technique and its effects. He can use theheel of his hand, his fist, or a tennis ball.Lie on your side or rest in Child’s Pose with your eyes closed, focusing on yourbreath.Tell your partner where you think the pressure would feel the best, which isusually between the lower back and the tailbone. Your partner then presses hishand or tennis ball into your lower back and rotates it in an unhurried circularmotion. This is a deep-pressure massage performed slowly with very littlemovement. Again, switch roles with your partner so he can feel the directeffects and respond to your requests for adjustment. Show your partner how toperform this procedure to provide you with maximum benefit.STROKING THE SPINEIn this massage, your partner begins by placing the palm of his right hand onyour neck along the right side of your spine and slowly slides his hand downyour back to your tailbone. He then alternates with his left hand, slowlysliding it down the left side of your spine. This process is repeated severaltimes for about five minutes. Performed with a firm, soothing stroke, thismassage can help to ease pain or discomfort during or between contractions.Creating a Supportive EnvironmentThere are many simple things you can do to make yourself a little morecomfortable during your labor. Try some of these suggestions at home, andprepare your “labor support kit” in advance so it will be available to you whenyou begin having contractions.AROMA WARM PACKWarm packs can help relax achy and tense areas in your body. Throughout laborthe warmth may be comforting during and in between contractions. Make your ownwarm pack by filling a clean tube sock with ordinary white rice aboutthree-quarters of the way full. Add half a cup of dried lavender leaves orflowers to the rice, then sew the top of the sock closed. Place the stuffed sockin the microwave for two to three minutes. The sock will remain warm whilereleasing its aroma scent for about half an hour.WATER AND JUICEIt is important to stay hydrated while in labor, as dehydration can cause laborto slow down or stall. You will be working hard throughout labor, and it mayfeel like you are running a marathon. Have plenty of water and fruit juicesavailable. Take a few sips of fluid in between each contraction. Have someliquids with sugar and electrolytes such as Gatorade available to help maintainyour energy level, or allow ice chips to melt in your mouth.FOODEat lightly in early labor so that your body has energy to sustain youthroughout birth. If your labor is long and you find that you are hungry, snackon easily digestible foods such as soup, crackers, or frozen fruit ice pops. Ifyou are in a hospital birthing center, be certain to check in with yourcaregivers and let them know what you feel like eating.AROMADiffuse the aromas that were calming to you throughout pregnancy. The aromas youhave associated with relaxation and comfort over the past many months will helpcalm and soothe you during labor.DIM LIGHTSMost mammals seek out dimly lit spaces for the birthing process. A dimly litroom encourages feelings of relaxation and safety. When a woman feels safe andrelaxed during labor, oxytocin, the hormone that facilitates contractions, isreleased and adrenaline, which inhibits contractions, is reduced. A dimly litroom creates an atmosphere conducive to inward focusing.TUB OR SHOWERImmersion in warm water can help a laboring woman relax and reduce the level ofpain. Similarly, standing or sitting in a warm shower with the rhythmic waterspraying on your belly or aching back can help ease your pain so you can flowmore easily with your contractions.MUSIC AND SOUNDS OF NATUREListening to soothing music or a recording of sounds from nature can help yourelax while in labor. Play music that is soothing and inspiring for you. Trylistening to sounds of the ocean, a river, or a waterfall and have tapes and CDsavailable if they have a calming effect on you.BIRTHING BALLSome women find that the use of a large exercise ball about 24 inches indiameter can be helpful during labor. You can purchase one at most health clubsor back stores. Sit on the ball with your feet flat on the floor, and make largecircular motions with your hips and pelvis. This movement helps relax themuscles in your back and pelvis. Some women use the ball throughout their entirelabor.Message to Your Birthing PartnerAsk your labor partner to read this next section.You play an essential role in the birthing process. It is your job tounconditionally support your partner and demonstrate through your words andactions that you believe in her. Stay at your partner’s side so she can feel youprotecting her birth space. Dim the lights, talk softly, diffuse pleasingaromas, give her water, use warm packs, gently touch her, breathe with her, talkwith nurses, handle visitors, and tell her you love her. As labor progresses,continue to look for ways to comfort her.Have food and drinks available to replenish yourself so that you can stay strongfor her throughout the many hours of labor. Draw on other people for support andrest when you need to. Develop a support card so you can continually reviewopportunities to enhance her comfort level. It may look like the following:I Will Remind Myself to• offer her a drink between contractions• encourage her to empty her bladder• suggest she try a shower or warm tub bath• breathe slowly and deeply with her• make sounds with her• try using a warm pack• offer a cold washcloth for her forehead• walk with her• suggest touch relaxation• see if light touch on her arm or back feels good• apply pressure to her lower back if it is aching• give her space• protect her privacyBirthing Your WayThere is no right or wrong way to birth your baby. As you move into the rigor ofcontractions, relinquish your attachment to how things should be and simplyallow what is unfolding to occur. Be in your body and listen to what it needs.Flow with your breath and slow down. Take one contraction at a time and stayconnected with your baby. Feel your support system around you. Listen to yourneeds, trust your instincts, and release into the process. Release your worriesand release your fears. Stay present and trust that your birthing experience isunfolding exactly as it should.Find Your Birthing PositionWomen have different bodies and different needs when it comes to birthing theirbabies. One position does not fit all. If you move around during labor, you willinstinctively find the positions that feel best for you. Although it may not bethe norm in your community, upright positions can strengthen uterinecontractions and help shorten labor.We encourage you to try standing, squatting, kneeling, sitting, and getting onyour hands and knees. Each of these positions uses gravity to help birth yourbaby and is worth experimenting with during labor. They may help your babymaneuver his way more easily through your pelvis and birth canal. In betweencontractions find positions that naturally help you to relax, such as kneeling,leaning forward, Child’s Pose, or lying on your side.image [images/Chop_9780307237330_epub_019_r1.jpg]STANDINGDuring early labor you may find you can continue with your normal activities andmay benefit from taking a walk. Walking helps your baby descend through yourpelvis and encourages efficient contractions. If you are standing while acontraction begins, lean forward and sink into your partner, bed, or the back ofa chair. As you bend forward try rocking your pelvis from side to side or movein slow circular motions.KNEELINGKneeling can be a useful position throughout labor. Try kneeling with your torsoat an upright angle, leaning into your partner. You can also try kneeling andleaning all the way forward into some pillows or blankets. Kneeling isparticularly helpful if you are experiencing back labor. While kneeling on yourhands and knees, you can easily circle your pelvis or rock it from side to side.This often helps to turn a posterior baby to an anterior position.SQUATTINGThis pose may feel good on and off throughout labor, and can be helpful inspeeding up contractions. Some women find squatting to be the most comfortableposition and others find that it makes contractions too intense. Squattingencourages the descent of your baby and increases pressure on your cervix.Listen to your body and use this pose only if it feels good. Move out of thesquatting position and rest between contractions. Squatting can be helpfulduring the pushing stage of labor. Making good use of gravity, it creates aneffective angle for your baby to descend through your birth canal.SITTINGSimilar to squatting, sitting helps widen your pelvis but usually stimulatesless intense contractions. Try sitting facing backward on a chair and lean intothe back support. Alternatively, sit at the edge of a chair and relax forwardwith your arms resting on your thighs. Some women find that sitting on a toilethelps them to relax and soften their pelvic floor muscles.SIDE LYINGSide lying enables you to be horizontal without having to be on your back. Thisposition can help slow down labor that is going too fast. Place pillows beneathyour head, belly, and between your knees for added comfort.Following your instincts is the most important thing you can do during labor.You may move in and out of many positions during labor, or you might find youprimarily use just one. Listen to and trust your body to find the positions thatare most effective and comfortable for you.AffirmationsThere may be times during your labor where your thoughts become unconstructivebecause you are tired, anxious, frustrated, or discouraged. Developing arepertoire of positive affirmations can help you transform negative thoughtsinto positive ones. Use your affirmations as you exhale, almost like a mantra,to keep your mind focused on thoughts and images that are helpful to yourprocess. These are examples of affirmations that women in labor find useful:As I release my breath, my cervix softens.Each contraction is helping me open.Breathing out, I trust my body.I inhale strength. I exhale resistance.Energy comes in. Tension moves out.Find your own affirmations and write them down. Practice them for a few minuteseach day by closing your eyes and thinking of your affirmations as you breathe.Honoring the Wisdom WithinTo accomplish the physiological miracle of labor and birth, your body accessesan inner intelligence that has developed over millions of years of evolutionarytime. An essential part of this ancient process is the production and release ofnatural chemical messengers that facilitate the birthing of your baby.Endorphins and oxytocin are among the most important natural medicines of yourinner pharmacy.ENDORPHINSEndorphins were discovered as scientists sought to understand why people respondto powerful pain-relieving medications such as codeine or morphine. It waslearned that these drugs are effective because they mimic the body’s naturalpain relievers, known as endorphins. The word endorphin is derived from thephrase “endogenous morphine.” Endorphins are released when the body needs toalleviate pain, during exercise, during relaxation, and during any activity thatgenerates feelings of comfort, pleasure, or enthusiasm. As a woman progressesthrough labor, endorphins build in her body to help alleviate discomfort andenhance relaxation. They are more readily released when a woman feels safe andsupported.OXYTOCINOxytocin is a hormone that is produced in the hypothalamus of the brain andreleased into the bloodstream from the back portion of the pituitary gland. Itis secreted during labor when the fetus stimulates the cervix, causing theuterine muscles to contract. In addition to its effect on the uterus, oxytocinis also important in stimulating the release of milk from your breasts. The mostimportant trigger for the release of oxytocin is physical stimulation of thenipples. There is evidence that oxytocin is also important in mother-babybonding, as there are brain receptors for oxytocin, which is believed to serveas a facilitating hormone for maternal behavior. Oxytocin is released in shortbursts rather than a steady stream and may be inhibited by fear or stress.When labor is not progressing your doctor may prescribe oxytocin to stimulateyour uterus. Stimulating your own nipples may help to increase the strength orfrequency of your contractions by naturally enhancing the release of oxytocin.Honoring TimeIn this technological age of nearly instantaneous information, it is easy toforget that natural physiological processes have their own rhythm. Birth has itsown clock, and it is important to remember that your baby will be born when yourbody and baby are ready. Your due date is an approximation, not the final bellat a sporting event. Most people do not birth on their designated day and it isnot uncommon to go into labor one to two weeks before or after your due date.Honor the process of your baby coming into the world by allowing your labor andbirth to unfold naturally.The Medical Safety NetA woman can be connected to her body and baby during birth whether or not shereceives medication. The decision to receive medical intervention does not implythat you become a passive participant in your birthing experience. Even if yourequire medicines during labor and delivery, you can be powerfully present asyou birth your baby.Human beings have been birthing babies for hundreds and thousands of years. Withthe advent of modern obstetrical care, there has been an increased tendency tointervene sooner, which may not always be in the best interest of Mother andBaby. The safety net provided by modern medicine is invaluable; and yet, aworthy goal is to reduce the need for medical intervention.Education and preparation enable women to have expanded choices in the birthprocess, allowing them to make informed decisions for themselves and theirbabies. It is helpful that you understand the possible challenges that may ariseduring labor so that you can be an active participant in your own care. If laborfails to progress, if the pain becomes unbearable, if exhaustion takes over, orif there are signs that the baby is in distress, the medical safety net is therefor you. Let’s review the most common medical interventions that may ariseduring the birthing process.External Fetal MonitoringExternal fetal monitoring is routinely used in most hospitals to keep track offetal heart rate and uterine contractions. A monitor may be strapped around yourbelly for twenty minutes of every hour in a hospital setting. During normalcontractions there is a temporary decline in oxygen delivery to the baby,resulting in a slight drop in your baby’s heart rate, which returns to normalduring rest periods. The monitor records these patterns for your care providerwith the goal of reducing the risk of problems with the baby, while maintainingthe lowest possible rate of medical intervention.Unfortunately, there are studies showing that close monitoring leads toincreased rates of cesarean deliveries, which is not always beneficial to Motheror Baby. If your labor is monitored, play an active role in the decision-makingprocess. If monitoring shows that your baby is in distress, try potentiallyhelpful measures such as changing your position, turning from side to side,receiving supplemental oxygen, and, if you are receiving Pitocin, asking for itto be turned off. Clearly, if these simple measures do not relieve the problem,be open to whatever is necessary to have the best outcome for you and your baby.Intravenous AccessIntravenous (IV) access through a catheter is considered routine at manyhospitals in order to keep the laboring mother hydrated and to provide accessfor other fluids and medication should the need arise. If you are birthing in ahospital setting, discuss the IV policy with your health care provider. Thereare studies showing that women who are well hydrated have faster labors thanthose who are not. If it is an option, see if you can maintain the necessaryhydration by drinking water and juices during labor. An IV can always be startedif at some point you need to receive medications. Our experience is that mothersempowered to trust the wisdom of their birthing bodies will drink adequatefluids throughout labor, particularly if their partners remind them.Pitocin to Induce or Augment LaborTo assist in the stimulation of contractions or to advance labor that is slow toprogress, Pitocin, a synthetic form of the pituitary hormone oxytocin, may begiven intravenously. Your body naturally produces oxytocin in short burstsduring labor to facilitate contractions, but Pitocin is administeredintravenously in a continuous flow. As a consequence, it may produce unusuallystrong contractions. Continuous monitoring is required with Pitocin to becertain that the strong contractions are not restricting blood flow to the baby.Due to the strength of the Pitocin-induced contractions, women who receive itmore commonly require stronger pain medications, including epidural anesthesia.There are clearly times when Pitocin is required to stimulate labor, and itsappropriate use may reduce the need for a cesarean delivery. On the other hand,it is not a drug that should be used casually. It is difficult to support theincreasingly commonplace choice to induce labor with Pitocin merely forconvenience’ sake. Electively induced labors are associated with a higherincidence of cesarean deliveries, forceps deliveries, and epidural anesthesia.Become informed about the benefits and the risks before you allow a drug to beadministered to your body.Natural Alternatives to Stimulate LaborIf labor progress is slow, it’s worth trying to enhance your contractions withnatural approaches before proceeding with Pitocin. Check with your care providerbefore using these techniques to stimulate your labor.ACUPUNCTURE AND ACUPRESSUREA number of reports have suggested that acupuncture, acupunctureelectrostimulation, and acupressure may stimulate labor if your cervix has begunto soften and thin. Although the science is still in its infancy, there is norisk to stimulating a few acupuncture points. Two points have been reported toenhance labor, one on the hands and another above the ankles. Large Intestines 4(Ho-Ku) is located on the back of the hand in the muscular web between the thumband index finger; Spleen 6 (San-Yin-Chiao) is on the inner surface of the lowerleg, about 3 inches above the major protruding bone on the inner surface of theankle.image [images/Chop_9780307237330_epub_011_r1.jpg]image [images/Chop_9780307237330_epub_023_r1.jpg]Have your partner stimulate these points by firmly massaging them with his thumbfor a minute at a time. The pressure should verge on feeling uncomfortable. Heshould alternate stimulating the points on your upper and lower extremities onboth the left and right sides.MAKING LOVEIt has been said, “What got the baby in can help get the baby out.” Oxytocin isreleased during a woman’s orgasm, and prostaglandins are contained in a man’ssemen. Both of these chemicals help stimulate contractions and soften thecervix. Do not have sex if your water has broken.NIPPLE STIMULATIONNipple stimulation results in the release of the hormone oxytocin from yourpituitary gland, which facilitates contractions to begin or continue. Lightlycaress your nipples or have your partner lick or suck on them. You want to becareful not to overstimulate your uterus, so begin by stimulating only onenipple at a time for a few minutes every few hours.Prostaglandin GelA gel made up of a synthetic prostaglandin has been shown to ripen the cervixand induce labor when applied to the vagina. In a number of studies, womenreceiving this prostaglandin gel called misoprostol had less need for epiduralanalgesia, Pitocin stimulation, and cesarean delivery. It can cause uterinestimulation. If you are considering inducing your labor, discuss the possibilityof using this prostaglandin gel as an option.Epidural AnalgesiaThe epidural space is a little gap between the bones of your spine and the sackthat holds the spinal cord and nerves. Pain-relieving medication is administeredinto the epidural space through a thin plastic catheter, placed by ananesthesiologist through a needle. The needle is removed and the catheter isleft in place. The tubing is connected to a pump, which continuously infuses themedication. When anesthetic medication is dripped around the spinal nerves, painsignals from the body are blunted.A woman usually begins feeling numb within five to ten minutes after themedication is infused. An intravenous line is required and her mobility islimited. Because epidural analgesia may slow labor, Pitocin is more commonlyrequired. Although epidural analgesia is routine in many birthing centers andthere is a trend toward lower doses of medicine, this procedure is associatedwith longer labors and a greater chance of requiring instruments during thebirth. In large studies, babies born to women receiving epidural analgesia havelower Apgar scores, a measurement of newborn health. However, babies whosemothers received epidural analgesia generally are healthier at birth than thosewhose mothers received narcotic medications.There is not a clear right or wrong answer to the question of epiduralanalgesia. For many women, the pain relief is worth the small increased risks.Others choose to handle the pain of labor through natural means. We encourageyou to inform yourself of the pros and cons of epidural analgesia, so you canmake a conscious choice for yourself and your baby.NarcoticsA narcotic will take the edge off your pain, although it will seldom eliminateit altogether. These strong pain-relieving medicines are given eitherintravenously or into a muscle. Intravenous medication takes effect faster butdoes not last as long as intramuscularly administered narcotic medications. Itis common to feel drowsy and queasy for a while after receiving narcotics.Narcotic medications enter your baby’s bloodstream soon after you receive themand, at high levels, can affect your baby’s blood pressure and breathing. Ifthere are residues of narcotic medications in your baby’s body at birth, he mayhave a weak sucking response for a few days. Try using the least amount ofnarcotic drugs necessary to provide adequate pain control, and try limitingnarcotics as you get closer to birthing your baby.EpisiotomyAn episiotomy is a 1⁄2- to 1-inch incision made in the perineum during crowningto enlarge the opening through which your baby passes. The incidence of thissurgical procedure varies widely. In some birthing centers episiotomies areperformed in as few as 20 percent of births, whereas in other units theprocedure is used in more than 70 percent of births. Although overall rates havebeen dropping over the past twenty years, a report from Thomas JeffersonUniversity in Philadelphia suggested that this procedure should be required inless than one in five vaginal births. Rather than reducing the chance for moreserious tears, most surveys have actually suggested a higher risk in womenundergoing episiotomies.Studies have suggested that the position of a woman at the time of birthcorrelates with the risk of perineal tearing. The most important issue is that awoman listens to her body and finds the position that feels right to her. Ratherthan accepting the view that one position fits all, we encourage you to movearound until you find the best one for you. In some studies, giving birth in aside position had the lowest risk of injury.Well in advance of your birth, have a conversation with your health careprovider about his or her usual practice regarding routine episiotomies and yourpersonal preferences. When women are encouraged to push at their own pace andassume a pushing position that feels comfortable for them, the incidence oftearing or requiring an episiotomy is reduced. A recent report from Australiafound that the episiotomy rate among obstetricians was five times higher thanthe rate among midwives, suggesting that allowing labor to unfold at its ownpace can reduce the need for medical intervention.Cesarean BirthCesarean section (c-section) is the surgical delivery of a baby through anincision in a woman’s abdomen and uterus. Almost one in four babies in Americaare born through cesarean section, although it is generally accepted that inlow-risk pregnancies, the rate should be closer to one in seven. The termcesarean comes from the belief that Julius Caesar was born that way.If, for a number of reasons, a baby cannot safely be birthed vaginally, cesareandelivery may be indicated. If the baby’s head is too large, the placenta isblocking the cervix, or labor fails to progress, for example, a c-section may bethe best option. Cesarean birth rates vary widely across the world, highlightingthe different thresholds for resorting to a surgical delivery. Although in thepast it was believed that “once a cesarean, always a cesarean,” there is nowgood evidence that 60 percent to 80 percent of women who previously delivered byc-section are capable of a safe subsequent vaginal birth. There are manyadvantages to going the vaginal route, including shorter hospital stays, fasterrecovery, lower infection risk, and less need for blood transfusions.If despite your best intentions and efforts, it is determined that a c-sectionis necessary, the procedure will take place using either spinal or epiduralanesthesia, and you will be awake for your baby’s birth. If the cesarean is anemergency, you may be given general anesthesia to put you to sleep. A nurse willshave your abdominal and upper pubic area, and an IV will be started in your armto give you fluids and necessary medications. You will also have a urinarycatheter inserted to keep your bladder empty.Once you have received this initial preparation, you will be taken into thedelivery room where your abdomen will be washed with antiseptic solution andcovered with sterile drapes. The surgeon will then make an incision in yourabdomen. You might feel some pressure and hear some unfamiliar sounds as this isdone, but should not feel any pain. Your baby will then be lifted out of yourbody and into the world. The time from incision to the birth of your baby isusually about ten minutes. Repair of your incision will take another thirty toforty-five minutes.Ask your doctor if the drapes can be lowered so you can see your baby cominginto the world. Upon arrival your baby’s mouth and nose will be suctioned andthen he will be brought over to a warming table to be checked. Your partner canbe right there with him. After these initial procedures, your baby will besnuggled up in a blanket and brought to you for a few minutes. While yourplacenta is being removed and your wound is being closed, your baby may bebrought to a warming bed or another room for additional observation. Yourpartner can stay with your baby during these procedures. Once your surgery iscompleted, you will be brought to another room where you will recover.Consider the possibility of having a cesarean delivery and think about how youcan make this experience as positive as possible. You are not just havingsurgery; you are giving birth to your baby. If you are having an electivecesarean, create a special ritual for the morning of your baby’s birth. Placecandles around you and your partner, connecting with each other and your baby onthis day of his birth. Read a poem or say a few words to invite your baby intothe world. Sleep with one of his baby blankets against your body the nightbefore your cesarean so that it smells like you on the morning of his arrival.Bring this blanket with you to the hospital and have him snuggled in it once heis born. See if your partner can take pictures and ask for your baby to bebrought to you as soon as possible.The most important aspect of your recovery from a c-section is having people tosupport you. Surround yourself at the hospital and home with people who canmother you. Most women stay in the hospital for two to four days and requireseveral weeks to fully recover from the surgery. Your baby will be looking forhis connection to you, listening for your voice, and seeking the comfort of yourfamiliar smell. Keep him close by as you recuperate.The Amazing Story of BirthBirth is a time of power and surrender, of beginnings and endings, of primordialfeelings and absolute novelty. Your personal birth story echoes the stories ofwomen since the beginning of humankind, yet it can be entirely unique. Allowyourself to be present for the most amazing experience of your life. Here is onewoman’s story:After hours of early labor, my contractions escalate. As they continue to build,the waves of sensations become stronger and there are only a few minutes’ restperiod between each one. I begin thinking to myself, “This is really hard, maybeI can’t do this.”As I breathe through another contraction, I feel my body leaning into mypartner’s. I look up into his eyes and I see that he is here with me, and Ithink to myself, “I can do this.”I change positions, following my breath as I settle back inside. I listen to mybody, and as I feel myself breathing, I let go into the sensations. As the painintensifies, doubt comes up again and I think, “This is much harder than Iremember . . . I can’t do it.”My partner holds me in his arms and I hear my health provider say, “I know it’shard, but you’re doing great. Everything is fine and your body is workingperfectly.”I go back inside my body, feeling each contraction taking me beyond the boundarywhere I thought I couldn’t go. I’m moaning and breathing as my body opens. Ibegin to cry and I let myself lose control as I groan. I think, “I don’t knowhow much longer I can keep this up.”The sensations are overwhelming. I feel like I want to throw up and my lowerback is aching. My partner presses his hand into my back to help ease the painand I feel the first urge to push. I soften my body and begin bearing down. Thesensations are powerful and the urge is strong. With each push I feel my babymoving deeper.After a while, my health provider tenderly strokes my hair and says, “Littlepushes now. Your baby’s head is right here. Reach down and feel her. Just a fewmore pushes and she will be here.”And I can feel my baby’s head at the threshold of birth. Another push and shecomes through me into the world. I cuddle her to my chest and hold her in myarms for the first time. As I look into her eyes, I think, “This is the mostamazing thing I have ever done. I gave birth to this beautiful baby!”Enliven Through Your Attention• Place your hands on your belly a few times throughout the day and send lovingthoughts to your unborn baby.• Journal each day about your experiences.• Early in your pregnancy, plant a tree or flowering bush to symbolize thegrowth of your baby in the womb.

Following pregnancy and birth it is common to feel a combination ofbliss and exhaustion. Please take the time to consciously slow down and honoryourself, your partner, and your baby. Create the space over the next few weeksto relax, meditate, and sleep as much as you can, allowing your rhythms andthose of your newborn to entrain. The more you rest, the more you will be ableto enjoy your new baby. To accomplish this, you’ll need to temporarilyrelinquish your need to keep everything else in life under control, makingbonding with your baby and rejuvenating yourself your highest priorities.Give yourself permission to let go of cleaning and household errands for awhile. The first few postpartum weeks go by incredibly fast. Slow down and enjoyeach moment. Create a peaceful sanctuary around you and your baby. Take time toclose your eyes and breathe.

Honor your body by giving it time to heal.Strengthening the BondParents and newborn babies are meant to be together. The intimacy between amother and baby during the nine months inside the womb needs to continue outsidethe womb through feeding, cuddling, rocking, holding, and carrying. Babies havea primordial need to feel physically connected to their caregivers and seek thisintimate bond soon after birth. Fathers and partners can share in this intimacyfrom the first minutes of life.In most cultures across time and throughout the world, Baby, Mother, and Fatherare nurtured and pampered during the immediate postpartum period. The nuclearfamily is surrounded with protection and support by their extended family andcommunity. Friends and family members bring nutritious meals and perform basichousehold chores, enabling the new parents to get some rest so they can beemotionally available to bond with their new baby. One of the challenges ofmodern Western society is overcoming the isolation that our uprooted lifestylecan engender. Well in advance of your baby’s birth make preparations for familyand friends to be available to support you during the first few weeks afterbirth. According to Ayurveda, the first six weeks after giving birth is acritical period for the mother.

Almond, sesame, coconut, and jojoba oils are good choices. Take as muchrest as possible with your baby and partner. For the first several days at thehospital, birthing center, or home, sleep when your baby sleeps. Stay in yourpajamas day and night for the first week. Although you will be tempted to useyour baby’s downtime to catch up on things, we encourage you to make getting therest you need a high priority. Spend a few minutes tape-recording or journalingyour impressions about the birth experience while the thoughts and feelings arefresh in your mind. Continue this ritual of documenting the process, which youwill thoroughly enjoy reading months and years from now.The First Few WeeksAfter the intensity of the labor and the first few days following birth, youwill probably be looking forward to quiet time with your baby. Focus onrecovering your energy by staying close to home for the first few weeks. Havesomeone available to nurture and support you so you can concentrate yourattention on your baby. Again, make resting a high priority. Meditate as much asyou can. If you are up during the night feeding your newborn, practice yourbreathing-awareness meditation so your body is resting even if your mind isawake. Cultivate the habit of giving yourself and your baby a daily warm oilmassage, focusing extra attention on your belly and head. For the first fewweeks, be gentle with your digestive tract. Favor simple, nourishing foods likesoups, steamed vegetables, casseroles, and freshly baked breads.

During the first week the flow will besimilar to your menstrual period, and then it should gradually lighten over thenext few weeks. Your uterus will take about six to eight weeks to return to itsnormal size while the site where the placenta was attached heals. Take it easythroughout these first few weeks to help your body heal. Use sanitary napkinsrather than tampons during this time.Afterbirth ContractionsFor one or two days after birth you may experience contractions as your uterusslowly returns to its normal size. Women who have had prior pregnancies may morecommonly experience these as their wombs need to work a little harder to getback into shape. These contractions are commonly felt during breastfeeding,because the natural hormone oxytocin that stimulates your milk letdown alsohelps to contract your uterus. If these sensations become uncomfortably intense,try practicing the following exercise.ExerciseAs you feel a contraction, close your eyes and take in a long, slow breath. Witheach exhalation visualize your body relaxing from your head down into your toes.After a few breaths bring your awareness to your belly. Feel your belly rise andfall around your womb.

Honor it now forcontinuing to work as it returns to its normal size.There are a couple of herbs that may be helpful in relieving the discomfort ofpostpartum contractions.• Raspberry (Rubus idaeus) has a long traditional use in soothing and balancingthe female reproductive tract. A tablespoon of the leaves steeped in a cup ofhot water can help relieve cramping and soothe the digestive system.• Valerian root (Valeriana officinalis) has been used since the Middle Ages torelieve discomfort and reduce tension. It has been shown to relieve musclespasms and can be sedating. Because it may enter into breast milk, it should beused sparingly in breastfeeding moms.

It is important todrink plenty of fluids when taking psyllium.• Licorice root (Glycyrrhiza glabra) can be useful in the short-term treatmentof hemorrhoids. Licorice has antiinflammatory properties and has been usedtraditionally to soothe the digestive tract. Taken in excess, it can lead toelevated blood pressure and altered blood electrolytes.

When toned, thesemuscles help support your internal organs and prevent urine incontinence now andthroughout your life. (See Chapter 4, page 122, for instructions on performingKegels.)The Emotions of MotherhoodYour emotions may fluctuate widely during the first few weeks after your baby’sbirth. One minute you may feel indescribably happy as you look into the eyes ofyour baby and in the next minute you may feel overwhelmed with sadness. You mayfind yourself crying and laughing in the same breath without knowing why. Rapidchanges in moods are a normal feature of the postpartum period. This emotionalturbulence is generated by the many biochemical and hormonal changes that occurin your body after birth. The fatigue that commonly accumulates as a result ofyour baby’s irregular sleep schedule is an important contributing factor. Thistypical phase of uncomfortable emotional turbulence commonly known as the “babyblues” usually subsides within ten days to two weeks of birth. The followingsuggestions can help you settle these emotional waves.As your mind quiets, your body takes over.• Get as much rest as possible. Sleep when Baby sleeps or nap when olderchildren nap.• Meditate daily—you can do this while feeding your baby.• Don’t skip meals—eat fresh, nourishing foods daily.• Begin exercising as soon as it is safe.

Women with a prior history of depressionare more susceptible, but it can affect any woman, regardless of age or numberof prior pregnancies.Postpartum depression may not become obvious until several days or weeks afterbirth. A woman may find herself overwhelmed with sadness, irritability, andexhaustion to the point that she is unable to perform basic household chores orfunction productively at work. She may lose the ability to enjoy things thatused to bring her pleasure and may be overcome with feelings of anxiety. Sleepand eating patterns are often disrupted. In extreme cases, a woman may haveimpulses to harm herself or her newborn baby. Her embarrassment over herfeelings adds insult to injury and may delay her seeking necessary treatment.Lack of social support along with an unrealistic need to be a perfect motherincreases the risk for postpartum depression. Complications during pregnancy anda premature birth may also be contributing factors.The most important thing to recognize if you are having intense feelings ofsadness is that you need and deserve professional help. If you know someone whois suffering with this condition, strongly encourage her to get the attentionshe needs. The most loving and caring individuals may find themselves strugglingwith depression. If you are having this problem, it does not mean that you are abad person; it does not mean that you do not love your baby; it does not meanthat you are being punished for something you did or did not do. It does meanthat you have a physiological and biochemical imbalance that needs treatment.For your sake and the sake of your baby, get the support you need to overcomethis distressing condition if you find yourself experiencing the followingsymptoms for longer than two weeks after giving birth to your baby:• persistent feelings of exhaustion• increasing feelings of sadness, guilt, or helplessness• lack of interest in your baby• inability to care for yourself• intense feelings of anger with thoughts of harming yourselfor your babyHelp with postpartum depression can take the form of counseling and, ifappropriate, antidepressant medication. As your spirits begin to lift, goodlifestyle practices can help you reawaken your inner pharmacy so you can regainyour sense of self and enjoy the experience of mothering your baby.BreastfeedingYour milk is specifically made for your baby. It is far superior to any otherfluid that you could use to feed her. Breast milk is a remarkable fluid, infusedwith the best nutrients for your baby’s well-being. In addition to supplyingcore nutritional needs of your baby, breast milk has components that provideimmune protection against a wide range of illnesses and infections. It enhancesthe development of healthy bacteria in your baby’s digestive tract and reducesher risk for allergies and asthma as your child develops. Although the digestiveenzymes in your baby’s stomach break down some of the substances in breast milk,others provide a level of protection that cannot be replicated by formula.The first few days after your baby is born, your breasts produce colostrum. Thisis a yellow-colored, concentrated fluid, rich with infection-fightingantibodies. These antibodies attach to the lining of your baby’s nose, mouth,throat, and stomach, protecting her from various viruses and bacteria. Enzymesto improve digestion, growth factors to support healthy gut bacteria, andproteins that regulate iron are all contained in colostrum. It also has a mildlaxative quality, which helps your baby move the first stools of meconium out ofher body. By the third or fourth day after birth, your breasts will begin theshift from producing colostrum to producing mature milk. The milk producedduring this shift is known as transitional milk. The concentration ofimmunoglobulins and total protein decreases during this transition while thelactose, fat, and calorie content increases. This transformation takes placeover a period of about two weeks.image [images/Chop_9780307237330_epub_020_r1.jpg]The composition of mature milk changes throughout each feeding. The milk at thestart of a feeding is called foremilk, which is high in volume but low in fatcontent. The milk toward the end of a feeding is called hindmilk. It is higherin fat content but lower in volume. Breast milk provides high levels oflong-chain fatty acids, which are important in healthy brain development, andcarnitine, which is important in energy metabolism. Allowing your baby to feedfor as long as she likes ensures that she receives both the necessary volume andthe fat content for healthy development.Herbs to Enhance Milk SupplyAlthough it is generally recognized that infants benefit from being fed breastmilk for at least the first year of life, many woman discontinue breastfeedingsooner. A reason commonly cited for stopping breastfeeding is the mother’sconcern that she is not producing enough milk to satisfy her baby’s needs.Although scientific validation is mostly lacking, there are a number of herbstraditionally suggested to enhance a mother’s milk production.• Fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum) is the most commonly recommendedmilk-boosting herb. It is available in the form of tablets, tinctures, and teas.It does have a documented blood sugar–lowering effect, so be certain to eatregularly throughout the day if you are trying fenugreek. In high doses,fenugreek can give your breast milk (and your baby) the smell of maple syrup.• Aromatic herbs such as fennel (Foeniculum vulgare), anise (Pimpinella anisum),and cinnamon (Cinnamomum verum) each have their proponents as milk-enhancingherbs. Perhaps they add interesting flavors and fragrances to the milk,resulting in more vigorous suckling and enhanced milk production. They also havedigestive calming effects, which can be of benefit to both Mother and Baby.• Alfalfa (Medicago sativa) is an herb traditionally used for rejuvenation thatalso is reputed to enhance milk supply. It is naturally rich in vitamins A, D,E, and K.• The Ayurvedic herb Shatavari (Asparagus racemosus) is a cousin to the commonasparagus plant. Shatavari has a long-standing reputation as a rejuvenative forwomen and as a breast milk enhancer, with studies in cattle documenting itsmilk-augmenting properties. Eat your asparagus and see if your supply increases.Flowing with NourishmentAccording to Ayurveda, breast milk is an upadhatu, or “superior byproduct,” of awoman’s rasa, which can be translated as plasma, sap, or essence. In order forbreast milk to be nourishing, a woman’s rasa must be appropriately nourished.The best way to ensure that your “sap” is nourished is to be certain that youare eating a well-rounded balanced diet with appropriate levels of protein,carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Listening to your appetiteand following a balanced six-taste diet is the easiest way to confidentlyreceive the nourishment you need from the food you are eating. We also recommendyou continue with a high-potency multivitamin/multimineral to provide anutritional safety net as long as you are breastfeeding. Be sure to drink plentyof fresh water and juices while avoiding nutritionally empty sodas, coffee, andalcohol.Feeling comfortable with and confident about breastfeeding supports adequatemilk production. Taking time to meditate (it’s great to do so whilebreastfeeding), finding a quiet space, and visualizing your nourishment flowingeasily from you to your baby can all help you relax into the experience. Seekguidance from a lactation counselor if you are still concerned that your milkflow is not adequate for your newborn. A little education and practice will mostoften relieve your concerns, enabling you to enjoy the primordial mammalianexperience of nourishing your offspring.Feeding TimeMake feeding time a consciously intimate and loving experience. Whether you arebreast- or bottle-feeding, cuddle your baby close to your body with her bellytoward your belly while you feed her. Make eye contact and send thoughts of loveand appreciation to the new soul that has been entrusted into your care. Whilefeeding your baby, bring your awareness fully into the process by closing youreyes and breathing slowly. Feel your arms around your baby as you embrace her.Notice your belly rising and falling against her body. Feel her molding intoyou. Sense her head in your arms and be aware of her tiny hands touching you.Experience your love and care flowing through you as you nourish her.Relieving Breast Fullness or EngorgementTo relieve breast fullness, try more frequent feedings for a time. Vary yourbreastfeeding positions so all areas of your breasts can be drained. Apply warmcompresses before feedings and cold compresses after feedings for comfort orstand in a warm shower several times a day. Gently massage your breast withstrokes moving from the periphery to the nipple. Make certain that your bra fitsproperly and you are not irritating your breast with heavy bags or purses.If despite the measures above, your breasts remain excessively sore, or you arehaving a fever, contact your health professional. If an antibiotic isprescribed, be certain that it is safe for use during breastfeeding. Gingerroot,chamomile, or calendula soaks can provide symptomatic relief.Life Force–Enhancing Exercises for ParentsCaring for your baby provides the opportunity to rediscover the world. Seeingthe universe through the eyes of your baby can be a precious reminder that lifeis magical and miraculous. To recapture the wonder that you experienced as achild, take time each day to tune into the five natural elements in theworld—earth, air, fire, water, and space. These life force–enhancing suggestionswill nourish your newborn baby and your own inner child.• Weather permitting, walk barefoot on the earth for at least ten minutes eachday. Have your attention on your feet with the intention to absorb nourishmentfrom Mother Earth.• Walk along natural bodies of water, allowing the cooling, cleansing, coherentinfluence of water to infuse your being.• Allow the light and warmth of the sun to permeate you. Acknowledge theenergy-giving force of the sun, the source of all life on earth.• Take a walk where there is abundant vegetation and deeply inhale the breath ofplants. The ideal time to receive the life force of plants is at dawn and dusk.• Gaze into the stars at night. Allow your awareness to fill the heavens and thecosmos to fill your awareness.• Eat locally grown, fresh, and lovingly prepared fruits, vegetables, andgrains, which imbibe the life force of all five elements.Nurturing Your BabyA new story begins with the birth of your baby. The nine months of pregnancyduring which you cared for your child by caring for yourself set the stage for amagical beginning. As you tenderly care for your baby over the next few months,ensure that the love and support that began in your womb continues to flow. Thisnew life has been entrusted into your protection so that her physical,emotional, and spiritual needs are attended. Pay attention to nourishing all ofyour baby’s senses. Have sweet sounds, tender touches, interesting and beautifulvisual stimuli, nourishing tastes, and soothing aromas available for your babyto enjoy. Along with your love and care, these nurturing sounds, sensations,sights, flavors, and smells will provide your baby with the building blocks fora healthy, enriched, and enchanted life.Your Baby’s Flow of ConsciousnessResearch by Boston-based Dr. Peter Wolf, a child psychiatrist, and Dutchpsychologist Heinz Prechtl has outlined and elaborated the six different statesof consciousness that a newborn baby experiences. Being aware of these statesenables you to better understand and respond to your baby’s needs throughout theday. The six states of awareness are quiet alertness, active alertness,drowsiness, quiet sleep, active sleep, and crying.During her quiet alert state, your baby is responsive and focuses on you whenyou talk to her. Her body is relaxed and her eyes are alert. Your baby is veryreceptive in this state, and it is a wonderful time to deepen your bond withyour newborn.During the active alert state, your baby demonstrates rhythmic body movements,which seem to be her way of interacting with you as you communicate with her.She will be interested in looking around at her surroundings while she is inthis state, but may not be as interested in making eye contact with you.Your baby will enter into the drowsy state as she awakens or falls off to sleep.Although her eyes may open and close, she will not be focusing on anything inparticular. Her eyelids will begin to sag as she drifts off and you may even seeher eyes roll upward while her lids are still partially open. She is in thestate between wakefulness and sleep.During quiet sleep your baby’s face and body will be relaxed with very littlemovement. Her breathing will be peaceful, although she may sigh periodically.Active sleep is the baby’s equivalent of REM (rapid eye movements) sleep inadults. Your baby will be asleep but physically active in this state. She maywiggle and move, make silly faces, and have periods of sucking. She may evenscoot her body close to you for warmth while staying asleep in this state.Crying is your baby’s way of letting you know that she needs something. She mayneed food, warmth, or comfort. You can usually soothe her in this state byfeeding her, picking her up, or cuddling with her. Crying is a form ofcommunication for babies. She may be telling you she is uncomfortable or simplywants to know that you are close by. As you lovingly respond to her cries, shewill learn to trust that you are listening and caring for her needs.Baby TalkBabies have many ways of relating to you and the world. They cry, fuss, wiggle,kick, listen, stare, change their expressions, look into your eyes, and smile.They are continually learning how to communicate their needs to you throughtheir movements and sounds. Your baby may seem to be in conversation with you asshe learns to converse by watching your facial expressions and imitating themback to you. She continues to dialogue as she learns to move her body insynchronized movements to the inflections in your voice.There is always a reason when your baby cries. She may want to be fed, cuddled,comforted, or changed. She may be trying to tell you that she needs help fallingasleep. Over the first few months you will learn to accurately interpret yourbaby’s cries and you will become more adept at understanding her unique way ofbeing and communicating.Sleeping TogetherThere are many opportunities to bond with your baby. For some it’s throughco-sleeping, in what has become known in the West as the “family bed.” In manycultures throughout the world babies sleep in bed with their parents for theirfirst few months or even years. Bed sharing has been shown to stabilize a baby’sheart rate and reduce crying. It also encourages frequent breastfeedings, andhas been suggested to reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).There is controversy regarding co-sleeping. Concerns have been raised by theConsumer Products Safety Commission regarding infant deaths every yearattributed to accidents as a result of babies sleeping in adult beds. Most oftenthese are due to entrapment of the baby’s head in a bed structure, althoughsuffocation from an adult rolling onto the baby is also reported.Recent studies have found that more people in America are sharing beds withtheir babies. The percentage of infants and parents co-sleeping rose from 5.5percent in 1993 to 12.8 percent in 2000. Babies and mothers that sleep togethershow synchronization in their movement and breathing patterns. Mothers who sleepwith their babies are also more attentive, performing protective behaviors suchas kissing, touching, and repositioning their infants five times more than whenmothers and babies sleep in separate rooms. If, as an expression of your desireto stay close to your baby you decide to share your bed with her, be certainthat you take the necessary precautions to prevent accidental injuries bykeeping pillows away from your baby’s face and removing any structures thatcould possibly entrap her.Nurturing Your Baby Through Her SensesYour baby learns about the world through her senses. Just as you pay attentionto the nourishing food she receives through her mouth, attend to your baby’sother senses by focusing on nourishing sounds, sensations, sights, and smells.Talk, read, and sing to your baby. Spend time in natural environments where thesounds, sights, and smells of nature can nourish both of you.NOURISHING SOUNDSYour baby has been listening to the beat of your heart and the sound of yourvoice for months before her birth. These familiar rhythms and vibrations arereassuring to her. Holding her against your chest where she can hear yourheartbeat and sweetly conversing with her will soothe and comfort your baby.As you talk and interact with your baby, assume that your new child is anintelligent being. You will naturally find yourself using higher pitched tones,because your baby will show greater responsiveness when you do so. Like mostpeople, babies like to be looked at while they are spoken to. Many studies haveconfirmed that your baby prefers your voice to any other female voice, andprefers her father’s voice to any other male voice.Exposing your baby to a wide variety of nourishing sounds stimulatesneurological development. Listen to different types of music. Sing, read poetry,tell stories. Take regular walks so your baby can enjoy the primordial sounds ofnature—birds chirping, water flowing in streams, the wind rustling the leaves oftrees. She will soon begin to make sense out of the different sounds, tones, andsyllables to which she is exposed.NOURISHING TOUCHMany studies have demonstrated the need for infants to receive regularnourishing touch to support healthy emotional and physical development. Keepyour baby snuggled up to you as much as possible. She is nurtured by the warmthand closeness of your body. Make your baby’s transition from the womb to theworld as effortless and stress free as possible.The skin is the largest sensory organ in the body, and dozens of studies haveshown that babies who are lovingly touched have more stable nervous systems,enhanced immune function, and improved digestive systems. Reports from theUniversity of Miami have demonstrated that premature babies in neonatalintensive care units receiving daily massages put on weight faster and are ableto leave the hospital sooner. Massage can help ease colic, stimulatecirculation, improve sleep, boost immunity, and enhance bonding and attachment.Massaging your baby on a daily basis is a wonderful way to connect with her.Massaging Your Baby. Trust yourself in intuiting what is good for your baby.Your loving intention is more important than any particular technique. Explore avariety of strokes as you massage the different parts of her body. Discontinuethe massage if your baby gets upset, as newborns may only enjoy short periodsinitially. Go slowly and enjoy this loving space with your baby. The followingsteps are guidelines for your baby’s first massage. Improvise to create amassage that flows well for you.Preparation. Create a safe and comfortable space for your baby’s massageexperience. Keep the temperature in the room comfortably warm, for your baby’sbody is still learning to regulate its temperature. Uncover only the part ofyour baby that you are massaging. Use only pure natural edible oil, such assesame, almond, or sunflower.image [images/Chop_9780307237330_epub_017_r1.jpg]Make eye contact with your baby as you begin, making certain that this is a goodtime for a massage. Throughout the massage continue making eye contact whilesoftly talking or singing to her. Newborn babies often keep their arms and legsfolded closely to their body. Avoid pulling on her limbs, allowing your strokesto glide gently over her flexed arms and legs. The most important principle of asuccessful massage is that both you and your baby enjoy it.Feet and Legs. It’s often easiest to begin massaging your baby around her feetand legs, which seem to be less sensitive places on her body. Try massaging yourbaby during a diaper change, while you are getting your baby dressed, or beforeor after a bath. Use your fingers or whole palm with each stroke.Begin by uncovering one of your baby’s legs and warming a few drops of oil inyour hands. Gently massage the top of your baby’s thigh and hip with circularmotions. Stroke up and down her thigh and then around her knee. Performup-and-down strokes over her lower leg and then move to her foot. Massage herfoot on the top from her toes to her ankle, and then around the bottom of herfoot. Massage her little ankle and ankle bones, and then her little toes. If hertoes curl up, let them stay curled and massage around them.If she is calm and enjoying the massage, do the other leg. If she becomes fussy,then begin with the other leg the next time. About the time your baby is six toeight weeks old she will begin to enjoy long strokes down her leg from her hipto her foot.Buttocks. The buttocks are easy to reach during diaper changes and if allowed byyour baby, can follow the massage of her legs. Uncover your baby’s buttocks, andwith a few drops of warm oil in your hands gently massage your baby’s buttocksusing small circular motions, one side at a time. To reach her entire buttockshold your baby to your chest with one hand and massage her lower buttocks withthe other hand using circular motions.Belly. Massaging your baby’s belly can help soothe colicky discomfort due tocongested gas. Expose your baby’s belly, after placing a few drops of oil inyour hands. Beginning on the right side of your baby’s tummy, massage in smallcircular clockwise motions spiraling from her navel outward. Avoid getting oilon her healing umbilical cord. Continue massaging in larger and larger circlesuntil you cover the entire abdominal area.Chest. With a few drops of warm oil on your hands, place your fingers on yourbaby’s chest and glide your hand down along the sides of her torso, bringingyour hands together over her belly. Gently cover her chest and sternum as youstroke from her clavicle to her belly, repeating several times.Arms. New babies often keep their arms flexed close to their body. Do not forceyour baby to extend her upper arms; rather, gently stroke around her bentjoints. Apply a few drops of warm oil in a circular motion around her shoulder,back-and-forth motions over the upper arm, circular over the elbow,back-and-forth over the forearm, circular around her wrist, and gently over eachfinger.Back. Your baby will begin strengthening the muscles in her back as she learnsto hold her head up and exercises her arms and legs. Massage her back whileholding your baby upright against your chest or try laying her facedown overyour legs or another soft surface. Using a few drops of warm oil, gently glideyour fingers or palm with light pressure along your baby’s back from hershoulders down to her buttocks. Repeat this motion several times. Then, startingat the neck, gently make small circular strokes with one or two fingers alongeach side of the spine down to the lower back. Again, repeat several times fromthe neck to the sacrum.Scalp. A gentle scalp massage is comforting and nurturing. It’s best to allowthe oil on the head to be absorbed for a little while and then shampooed out.Massage your baby’s scalp using a small amount of oil over her entire head, asif shampooing her hair, being particularly gentle over the fontanels, or softspots where the skull bones have not yet come together.Face. Babies are often sensitive about having their faces touched. Check withyour baby to make certain that the experience is enjoyable for her. If shedoesn’t like it at first, try again in a few weeks. If she seems willing, trystarting with your baby’s ears, which generates a relaxing feeling throughoutthe entire body. Next, move to her forehead, using gentle circular motions, andthen continue this around her temples. With one or two fingers gently strokefrom the forehead along the outer edges of her face down along her jawline toher chin. Repeat this stroke a few times. Because babies are born with a rootingreflex triggered by stimulation on the cheeks and lips, avoid stroking theseareas for the first few weeks.Once you have finished the massage, spend a few minutes holding your baby closeto you before dressing or bathing her. Tender touching is one of the most directways we have to demonstrate our love to the people in our lives. Taking the timeto massage your baby will ensure a magical beginning to her life.NOURISHING SIGHTSInfants see best at a distance of about 8 to 10 inches from their eyes and areparticularly fascinated by human faces. They tune into various facialexpressions and early on begin to imitate them. Most babies are vocalizing byfour weeks and smiling responsively by six weeks. They have intense curiosityfor their world and a voracious appetite to engage with their environment.Have colorful, interesting shapes and objects around for your baby to see. Sheis constantly learning, remembering, and sorting through visual images. Althoughshe will not be able to focus fully for a while, spend time in beautiful,natural settings that nourish all her senses.NOURISHING SMELLSResearch has shown that your baby is able to recognize your smell within thefirst couple of days of life. In the brain, smell, memory, and emotion areclosely linked. When a smell is initially associated with an experience, thesmell alone can later trigger the feelings associated with the originalexperience. You can use this phenomenon, known as neuro-associativeconditioning, to enhance the comfort and well-being of your baby by consciouslycreating associations between fragrances and comforting experiences. Forexample, during massage diffuse a soothing aroma, such as lavender, rose,vetiver, or vanilla. Your baby will begin to associate the aroma with acomforting sensation so that in times of discomfort the scent by itself maycreate a relaxing response.A SENSE OF HUMORResearch has shown that laughter may be one of the best medicines. Studies havefound that a good belly laugh enhances immune function all day. Make playfulnesswith your baby a regular part of your daily schedule. By the end of her secondmonth, she will respond to your funny faces and peekaboo games. Remembering tolighten up and not take yourself too seriously is good for both you and yourbaby.Nurturing the NurturerOne of the most important things mothers and father can do to be good parents isto take care of themselves. Once you have established a semblance of rhythm inyour new family, ask a close relative or trusted friend to watch your baby for ashort while so you can have some time to yourself. Also, make it a priority foryou and your spouse or partner to nourish the bond that created your baby. It isnot selfish to take care of yourself; rather, it is essential that you maintainyour own mind-body balance so you can provide everything your new child needs toflourish physically, emotionally, and spiritually.Enliven Through Your Attention• Place your hands on your belly a few times throughout the day and send lovingthoughts to your unborn baby.• Journal each day about your experiences.• Early in your pregnancy, plant a tree or flowering bush to symbolize thegrowth of your baby in the womb.

From a purely genetic perspective your life is deemed successfulsimply by passing on your DNA, but as a human father, you have deep drives to bean active force in the rearing of your child. More than ever before there is theneed and the opportunity for dads to be essential participants in the parentingof healthy and happy children.You may or may not have had good modeling for an engaged father as you weregrowing up, but as the late Dr. Benjamin Spock once said, “The more people havestudied different methods of bringing up children the more they have come to theconclusion that what good mothers and fathers instinctively feel like doing fortheir babies is the best after all.” In other words, if you are tuned into yourinner voice, you will be a good parent to your children.From the moment you learn that your wife is pregnant, your life beginstransforming. As more and more of her attention goes inward to her developingbaby, your role as nurturer and supporter expands. The rapidity of physical,emotional, and spiritual changes your wife goes through during pregnancy is on adifferent scale than most men will ever experience in their own bodies andminds. At times the ride is exhilarating and at times daunting, but be assuredthat since the beginning of humanity, the course of the next nine months hasbeen successfully traversed by generations of men before you.Over the next nine months the focus of your life will be on your wife and yourdeveloping baby. The promise of a new child rallies the love and attention ofpeople in your life. Intense feelings are the norm rather than the exception forboth you and your wife during this initial period, and you need to expect upsand downs as you navigate this new experience together. Let’s focus on what youcan do physically, emotionally, and spiritually to maintain your balance as yourworld changes.Caring for Your BodyIt is nearly as important for you to care for yourself as it is for the motherof your child-to-be. Successful parenting requires stamina, and taking care ofyour own health will enable you to be in a better position to support your wifeand your baby. Pay attention to the basics:• good nutrition• regular exercise• stress management• sound sleepNUTRITIONFeed your body with nourishing food. Balanced nutrition does not have to becomplex, but you do need to put attention on ingesting a wide variety of foodsto receive the nutrients that keep you healthy and vital. Following a diet richin six tastes and seven colors enables you to metabo-lize the health-promotingintelligence of nature into the healthy chemistry and physiology of your body.To cover your nutritional bases, we also encourage you to take a high-potencymultiple vitamin for its long-term health promoting benefits.If you are not already accomplished at cooking, this is a good time to learn.Learning to cook will enhance your sense of self-sufficiency and provide anotheropportunity for you to support your wife and baby. Pick up a couple of cookbooksand practice preparing some wholesome recipes. Being able to multitask will begood for the entire family.EXERCISEYou need to maintain your physical fitness. The benefits of exercise are onmultiple levels, ranging from reducing stress to improving sleep. Althoughexercise time is often one of the first things to be left out when life becomesdemanding, we encourage you to make it a high priority.There are three primary components to a balanced exercise program: flexibility,strength training, and cardiovascular conditioning. Each of these approachesenhances both physical and emotional well-being. Many studies support the valueof exercise in lowering anxiety levels, raising the production of naturalantidepressants, and reducing anger and irritability. In addition to feelingstronger and having better aerobic capacity, the mood-stabilizing benefits ofexercise will serve you well over the next nine months.Set your fitness regimen and stick with it. If possible, do something physicalevery day. An ideal program would be to perform ten minutes of yoga or otherstretching exercise followed by strength training for twenty minutes three daysper week and cardiovascular conditioning for twenty minutes three days per week.On the seventh day, take a leisurely walk with your spouse.STRESS MANAGEMENTIt’s natural to feel some anxiety when a new baby is on the way. Your life isundergoing changes over which you have very limited control. The added financialresponsibilities of a new member of the family may naturally create someconcern. Learning to manage your stress will help you make the most successfuldecisions to maintain your balance.Take time to quiet your mind in meditation daily. Practice a mindfulnesstechnique, learn a mantra, or listen to meditation tapes. For over thirty years,studies have shown that people who experience restful awareness throughmeditation regularly are emotionally and physically healthier. Remember, you areof greatest benefit to your family when you are coming from a centered and calmplace within yourself.SOUND SLEEPYour body needs sleep to rejuvenate. If you do not get the rest you need eachnight, you accumulate fatigue, which impairs your ability to stay centered inthe midst of challenges. Studies have shown that inadequate rest results inimmune weakness, lowered pain thresholds, impaired concentration, and poorermemory recall. According to Ayurveda, sleep is the nursemaid to humanity and oneof the pillars of health.To the best of your ability, try to follow an ideal daily routine that includesrising with the sun, meditating in the morning, exercising for half an hour,taking time at midday to eat a nourishing lunch, meditating a second time beforeyour lighter evening meal, and getting to bed no later than 10:30 p.m. If youare having trouble falling asleep because you have too much on your mind, trythe following simple sleep routine.• Run a hot bath an hour before bedtime, adding a few drops of calmingaromatherapy oil such as lavender, sandalwood, or vanilla to the water.• Perform a slow oil massage on yourself while the bath is running. (See themassage description in Chapter 2, page 54.)• After your massage, soak in the warm tub for ten to fifteen minutes.• After your bath, drink a cup of warm milk with nutmeg and honey, or somechamomile or valerian root tea.• Journal for a few minutes before bed, “downloading” your concerns so you arenot ruminating about them when you shut your eyes.• Read mind-quieting literature for a few minutes before bed, avoiding dramaticnovels or distressing material.• Avoid watching television or doing mind-activating work in bed.• Once in bed, close your eyes and bring your attention into your body. Whereveryou notice tension, consciously relax that area, then simply watch your slow,easy breathing until you fall asleep.If you are lying still in bed quietly observing your breath, your metabolicactivity is nearly as low as if you were in deep sleep. Even if your mind isstill awake, your body is getting the rest it needs. Therefore, do not worry ifyou are not immediately falling asleep, and by not worrying, you will quicklydrift off into a deep slumber.Overcoming Emotional TurbulenceAs a father-to-be you need to acknowledge that you cannot fully understand orappreciate what your pregnant wife or partner is going through. Her body ischanging on a daily basis and the hormonal fluxes that are occurring inside hercan contribute to rapid emotional shifts. Add these physiological andbiochemical changes to her natural anxieties about pregnancy, birth, andmothering and you have the recipe for an occasional emotional meltdown.Compassion for your spouse is a useful quality to mobilize when occasionally shedoes not seem like her usual stable self. It’s important that you not take heremotional perturbations too personally, but, rather, look for opportunities toprovide support and balance.Your spouse wants and needs your unconditional love and nurturing as sheexperiences the physical and emotional turbulence of pregnancy. This means beingwilling to relinquish your attachment to rigid ideas about what you believe sheshould think or feel about her changing world. Intellectual analysis willusually not be of much help in navigating the emotional turbulence of pregnancy.Pregnancy is an opportunity to be a true spiritual warrior, cultivatingflexibility without weakness, patience without negligence, and acceptancewithout resignation.When your spouse is upset, remember that her distress is the result of a needthat is not being met. Whether or not she is expressing her need in a fullyconscious way, see if you can look beyond the emotion to the implied request.Sometimes you will be capable of meeting her needs, and other times you won’t,but the more centered you remain, the better you’ll be able to help her regainher balance. No one is expected to be perfect—neither you nor your partner—buttry to seek creative solutions to the inevitable challenges that arise.Review the principles of conscious communication developed in Chapter 6.Although ideally both partners consistently differentiate their observations andfeelings from their judgments and interpretations, it is easy to fall back intoa pattern of holding the other person responsible for your feelings duringperiods of emotional turbulence. Resist becoming engaged in emotional battles ofattack and defend. Rather, identify what it is that actually happened,acknowledge the feelings that were triggered by the situation, uncover the needthat was not met, and offer the behavior that will fulfill the need.Your role as a supporting spouse is to maximize the safety, security, andstability in your wife’s life, knowing that this is the greatest value you canprovide to your unborn child. Before engaging in conflict and confrontation,consider that your unborn baby is on the receiving end of the stronguncomfortable feelings that are generated. You wouldn’t have a heated argumentwith your newborn baby, so do your best to avoid one with your wife.If despite your best efforts, the immediate stresses lead to an emotionallycharged encounter, try to dissipate the strong feelings and resolve the conflictas quickly as possible. When you feel yourself getting emotionally overloadedand losing your center, practice the seven steps of emotional processing toregain your composure. Let’s take an example of a common scenario to see howthis might work.Driving home from a day at the office you get caught in rush-hour traffic andarrive at your house twenty minutes later than you had planned. Unfortunately,you forgot that your wife had a pregnancy yoga class she wanted to attend.Because you were supposed to be home in time to watch your three-year-old son,she is now at risk of missing her class. She is irritated and unloads on youabout how selfish and irresponsible you are.This encounter could easily go one way or the other. On one hand, it would nottake much for you to react to her attack by taking out your frustrations on herover your stressful day and challenging commute home. However, engaging in areactive response will only lead to more hurt feelings on both sides andpossibly prolong the period before reconciliation, an approach that is not bestfor you, your spouse, or your unborn baby.Alternatively, we encourage you to try a different tactic. Instead of mobilizingyour psychological defenses, recognize that as a result of the discrepancybetween the time you were expected to arrive and the time you showed up, yourwife experienced strong feelings of frustration, disappointment, irritation, andanxiety. She has a need to attend her class, and the fulfillment of that need isin jeopardy. Rather than reacting to her reaction, simply say, “I’m really sorryI’m late. I didn’t leave enough time to account for the terrible traffic. Ipromise from now on when you want to go to your class, I will allow for extratime to drive home. Why don’t you leave right now for your class, and we cantalk more about this later?”Both your wife’s and your upset feelings are legitimate. However, at this timein her life it is especially important not to engage in a vehement argument.Once she is on her way to her class, sit for a few minutes and tune into thesensations in your body. Allow yourself to feel the strong emotions that havebeen generated and breathe into them. See if you can identify your feelingswithout using language that puts you into the role of a victim. Then dosomething active to release the pressure in your body that your feelings arecreating: put your three-year-old into a jogging stroller and go for atwenty-minute run; put on some rock and roll music and vigorously straighten upthe house; move your body with the intention to release the impulse to fight orrun.By the time your wife arrives home, you’ll be in a much better state of mind todiscuss the incident without escalating the issue to an argument. Yourcommitment to minimizing the violence in your life is good for you, yourpartner, and your baby-to-be. Developing these healthy patterns will serve youwell as your family grows. Your children’s style of communication is shaped longbefore they are capable of intellectually analyzing how they relate to theworld. Help them establish healthy principles early on that will help them meettheir emotional needs throughout their lives.Awakening Your SpiritAccording to Ayurveda, human beings have four basic needs in life: artha, kama,dharma, and moksha. Becoming a parent provides motivation and opportunity foryou to meet each of these needs.Artha means “things.” People naturally aspire to own things and derive pleasurefrom a healthy measure of material abundance. When you have children, it isnatural to desire a comfortable home, a safe automobile, and adequate resourcesto provide for your children’s needs. On the other hand, if you expend all yourenergy on the acquisition of wealth, your financial assets may increase, but theother important components of your life will suffer. Manage your resourcesresponsibly, strive for abundance, but never let it alienate you from your lovedones. No one at the time of their death ever regrets that they did not go intowork earlier or stay later at the office.Kama refers to love in all its expressions, including sensual love. We have aninherent need to connect intimately with people in our lives. Nourishingrelationships are essential to healthy and fulfilling lives. A basic theme ofthis book has been to encourage you to make nurturing relationships the highestpriority in your family. If your relationships are loving, you can weather allchallenges in your life. Practice love in your life and teach love to yourchildren. It is one of the most important responsibilities you have to maximizetheir potential for happy and successful lives.Dharma means living in accordance with the laws of nature. According to the lawof dharma, people are born with a unique set of talents, which when developedenables them to make a contribution to their community, while generating theartha, or material abundance they require to live comfortably. One of the mostimportant roles that parents play is to help their children cultivate theirspecial talents. Expose your children to as wide a range of experiences aspossible and observe those opportunities to which they are naturally attractedor in which they excel. If your child shows talent in an area, encourage andsupport him, rather than imposing your idea about how he should be living hislife. When people are in their dharma, they tend to lose track of time. Timelessawareness is one of the best signs that a person is living in accordance withtheir soul’s purpose in life.Finally, moksha means “liberation.” According to Ayurveda the ultimate goal oflife is liberating your soul through the transformation of your internalreference point from ego to spirit. Moksha implies that your self-identityexpands in widening circles, so that you identify yourself less and less withyour country, religion, ethnic background, or occupation, and increasingly as asentient, spiritual being. As you expand your identity from local to nonlocal,your capacity for compassion also expands. Your actions become increasinglyevolutionary and it becomes impossible to harm another being. Synchronicity andspontaneous fulfillment of your desires become commonplace, while your verypresence generates peace, harmony, laughter, and love in those around you.Teaching your children these spiritual principles is our best chance forcreating a world that is fit for them to live in.Stand by Your WomanWhile in most situations we are enthusiastic proponents of relationships basedupon equality, during pregnancy the equation indisputably shifts in favor ofyour wife’s needs over your own. From the moment you discover she is pregnantuntil months after birth, we encourage you to be there for her, even when itmeans deferring gratification of your own needs. There are several importantmilestone events during the pregnancy when your support is critical and yourpresence should be your highest priority. At a minimum these include:• the performance of the pregnancy test• the first several health care provider visits• any and all ultrasound studies• any health care provider visit when there is a concern• all birth-education classes• preliminary visits to the hospital or birthing center• any test procedures• any health care provider visit when the results of tests arediscussed• the birthBe intimately involved in the pregnancy and birth of your baby. Yourparticipation at significant moments will deepen your connection to your wifeand your unborn child. These events are important and fleeting; if you missthem, you miss a precious opportunity to share in the development and birth ofyour child. You will never regret the time you take to be deeply engaged in thiswondrous process.Dos and Don’tsFor the sake of peace and harmony in your household, we offer a few suggestionsthat will serve any potential father well. Remember that your wife or partner isa somewhat different person than she was before becoming pregnant. There are nowtwo people living in her body, and her reactions to you may be different thanthey have been in the past. People respond differently under stress than they dowhen they feel completely safe and secure. Stress is common during times ofrapid change, and there are few periods in life where change occurs as rapidlyas during the nine months of pregnancy.• Avoid expressing concerns about your wife’s changing body shape. Sayinganything approaching “Do you think you should be gaining this much weight?” istreading on dangerous ground. Trust that your wife’s body is going through theimportant changes it needs to in order to support your unborn child. In time,after birth, she will return to the shape you remember. Enjoy her voluptuousnessnow and look for every opportunity to express your appreciation for herbeautiful pregnant body.• If your wife expresses concerns about the appearance of her body, besupportive but do not suggest that you have been worrying about the same thing.If she wonders out loud if the stretch marks are going to be permanent, simplyreassure her that they will improve after the baby is born. If she expressesanxiety about whether her belly or breasts will be permanently changed by thepregnancy, reassure her that her body will recover its prior shape in time. Donot say, “I’ve been wondering the same thing,” if you want to preserve peace inyour household. Remember, your most important role now is to help reduce, notcompound, her worries.• Be prepared for fluctuations in your wife’s sexual appetite. Pregnant womenoften find their sexual desire ebbing and flowing. It is not uncommon for womento have little desire during the first trimester due to a combination ofphysical and emotional factors. If your wife is struggling with morningsickness, it shouldn’t surprise you that her interest in passionate love makingmoves to the back burner.During the second trimester, women often experience the return of a healthysexual appetite. The blood engorgement in your partner’s sexual organs enhancesher sensitivity and pleasure. This is an opportunity to experiment withdifferent positions that do not place uncomfortable pressure on her expandingwomb.By the time she is in her third trimester, your partner’s sexual enthusiasm willprobably be waning. Carrying an enlarging baby is increasingly hard work and itis difficult for her to feel comfortable in her body. It is certainly possibleto enjoy safe and pleasurable sex at this stage; you’ll simply need to be moresensitive and creative. Remember, even if you are not engaging in intercourse,you can still be affectionate and sensual with each other. Follow her lead andtry not to take her lack of sexual passion personally.• Make your choices bearing in mind the possibility that everything may notunfold exactly as planned. When it is time to go to a pregnancy checkup withher, leave enough time so you are not late due to unanticipated delays. Allowenough time until your next professional appointment so you will not feelpressure if the visit runs later than expected. Do not plan a business trip outof town within one month of her due date. Do everything in your power to avoidcontributing to her anxiety. Letting your spouse know that being there for heris your highest priority will avoid unnecessary conflict.• Identify someone with whom you can communicate, when it is clear that yourissues and concerns are best not brought to the attention of your wife. Yourfather, brother, or best friend might be a good choice. Establish your ownrelationship with your wife’s doctor or pregnancy advisor and ask him or her thequestions that are on your mind. Reassurance that your concerns are normal andeasily addressed will keep you in your centered state of being, in which you areof greatest value to your partner and unborn baby.First ImpressionsThere is no joy in the world that compares with meeting your child for the firsttime. Increasingly, fathers are given the opportunity to receive the baby as itemerges from the birth canal. After handing him to your wife, you may also begiven the opportunity to cut the umbilical cord. If you have been takingpictures during labor and birth, ask someone else to hold the camera during thefinal moments of birthing so you can be fully present as your child enters theworld. Life can be challenging, but holding your newborn baby at the verybeginning of his life makes everything worthwhile at that sacred moment.There is usually a period after birth—during which the placenta is delivered ortears may need suturing—that you can use to bond with your new baby. The childis often in a state of quiet alertness in which he will be very receptive. Speakto him; sing to him; welcome him into your family and into your heart. This isthe beginning of a life-long love affair. You are your baby’s father. It is oneof the most important and potentially rewarding roles you will ever play.

We hope you will utilizethese approaches so that your new family will be a beacon of peace, harmony, andlove that inspires others in your community to follow your example.For us, there is a deeper meaning and purpose in writing this book. We havespent decades of our lives studying the ancient wisdom traditions of the world.We have been most influenced by the great healing tradition of Ayurveda, whichholds that a human being embodies the most creative expression of the universein evolution. We are the instruments through which the universe has chosen to beself-conscious. With the birth of every child, the universe chooses to look atitself with fresh eyes. Although you may believe that you look out at the worldthrough your sensory apparatus, the deeper reality is that you are anoutcropping of universal intelligence looking at itself through your senses. TheUpanishads declare, “Yatha pinde, tatha brahmande,” which translated intoEnglish reads,As is the atom, so is the universe.As is the microcosm, so is the macrocosm.As is the human body, so is the cosmic body.As is the human mind, so is the cosmic mind.We are at a critical period at this moment in evolutionary time. The predatoryinstinct survives in us and frequently dominates. At the same time, our deepcreative impulses impel us to participate in the harmonious interaction ofelements and forces in the cosmos, inspiring us to take the next evolutionarystep. The choice is ours. As predators we can ravage the planet, causing theextinction of other species in the web of life, ultimately risking our ownextinction. As creators, we can participate in the next evolutionary expressionof cosmic intelligence.The world we see “out there” is our creation. If we have wars, it is because wehave agreed to use violence as a means to settle our differences. Ecologicaldevastation, crime, economic disparities, cruelty to animals, and violence inall its forms are the consequence of human choices. The seeds of thesedestructive impulses reside within each of us, precipitating into collectiveexpressions that are played out locally and globally as acts of terror, tyranny,and environmental pollution.But we must not forget that even the worst terrorist, tyrant, or polluter wasonce a child. Each child arrives as a gift from the universe. The wisdomtradition of Vedanta holds that death and birth are interwoven creative acts ofthe soul. When the physical body gets to the point when it can no longercreatively express the innate wisdom of the soul, the soul goes into incubationin the nonlocal domain, beyond the dimensions of space and time. After a periodof incubation, the soul takes a quantum creative leap, choosing to be born againto express its latent potentials, developed over eons of experience.Love is all that’s needed for a new soul to blossom. With loving nurturing thesoul finds its next creative expression. But if this loving nurturing is denied,an imbalance between the forces of creativity and inertia results in woundedindividuals and a wounded planet. We hope that by embracing the principles inthis book, you will make a deep commitment to restoring balance in your ownlife, while creating an atmosphere of love and nurturing for your child and yourfamily.We also hope that you will recognize the deep connection between your family,the human family, and the planet as a whole. The future of our planet dependsupon who our children become as adults, and it is our responsibility to teachand share with them awareness of the divine intelligence that is the source andsustainer of all life. In The Prophet, Kahlil Gibran says,Your children are not your children.They are the sons and daughters of Life’s longing for itself . . .The souls of our children are the potential for tomorrow’s world. Our earth isnot just a capricious anomaly in the vast sea of space, but a cosmicmanifestation of divine intelligence. Through leaps of imagination, it willcontinue to express itself as new realities. Our job as parents is not tointerfere with this creative process, but to align with it by nurturing ourchildren in body, mind, and spirit. The great Indian poet Tagore once said,“Every child that is born is proof that God has not yet given up on humanbeings.” We ask you to join with us and with God to help create a world ofpeace, harmony, laughter, and love that is worthy of our beloved children."},{"pageContent":"image [images/Chop_9780307237330_epub_104_r1.jpg]Glossary of Termsamniotic fluid The fluid within the sac that surrounds the babyin uteroApgar score An evaluation of the baby’s health at one and fiveminutes after birtharomatherapy Using the scents of flowers and plants for theireffects on the physiologybearing-down reflex A reaction to the pressure of the baby onthe pelvic floor, which causes a spontaneous urge to pushbloody show A blood-tinged mucus discharge, or “mucus plug,”which indicates labor is imminentbonding The natural attachment that develops between parentsand childBraxton Hicks contractions Nonprogressive contractions thatfeel like menstrual crampsbreath awareness The practice of consciously directing thebreathbreathing techniques cleansing breath, rhythmic breath, heebreath, and blow breathbreech presentation When the baby is positioned feet- orbottom-first at the time of deliverycatheter A tube used for injecting or evacuating fluids, e.g.,a urinary catheter or an epidural cathetercephalopelvic disproportion (CPD) A relative disproportion ofthe baby’s head to the mother’s pelvis;
