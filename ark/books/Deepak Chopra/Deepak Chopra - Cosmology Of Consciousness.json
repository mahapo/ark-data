Carlsbad, CA 92009AbstractIssues related to consciousness in general and human mental processes inparticular remain the most difficult problem in science. Progress has been madethrough the development of quantum theory, which, unlike classical physics,assigns a fundamental role to the act of observation. To arrive at the mostcritical aspects of consciousness, such as its characteristics and whether itplays an active role in the universe requires us to follow hopeful developmentsin the intersection of quantum theory, biology, neuroscience and the philosophyof mind. Developments in quantum theory aiming to unify all physical processeshave opened the door to a profoundly new vision of the cosmos, where observer,observed, and the act of observation are interlocked. This hints at a science ofwholeness, going beyond the purely physical emphasis of current science.Studying the universe as a mechanical conglomerate of parts will not solve theproblem of consciousness, because in the quantum view, the parts cease to bemeasureable distinct entities. The interconnectedness of everything isparticularly evident in the non-local interactions of the quantum universe. Assuch, the very large and the very small are also interconnected. Consciousnessand matter are not fundamentally distinct but rather are two complementaryaspects of one reality, embracing the micro and macro worlds. This approach ofstarting from wholeness reveals a practical blueprint for addressingconsciousness in more scientific terms.1. IntroductionWe realize that the title of our paper is provocative. It is aimed at providinga theory of how the physical universe and conscious observers can be integrated.We will argue that the current state of affairs in addressing the multifacetedissue of consciousness requires such a theory if science is to evolve andencompass the phenomenon of consciousness. Traditionally, the underlying problemof consciousness has been excluded from science, on one of two grounds. Eitherit is taken as a given that it has no effect on experimental data, or ifconsciousness must be addressed, it is considered subjective and thereforeunreliable as part of the scientific method. Therefore, our challenge is toinclude consciousness while still remaining within the methods of science.Our starting point is physics, which recognizes three broad approaches tostudying the physical universe: classical, relativistic, and quantum. ClassicalNewtonian physics is suitable for most everyday applications, yet itsepistemology (method of acquiring knowledge) is limited -- it does not apply atthe microscopic level and cannot be used for many cosmic processes. Betweenthem, general relativity applies at the large scale of the universe and quantumtheory at the microcosmic level. Despite all the attempts to unify generalrelativity with quantum theory, the goal is still unreached. Of the three broadapproaches, quantum theory has clearly opened the door to the issue ofconsciousness in the measurement process, while relativity admits thatobservations from different moving frames would yield different values ofquantities. Many of the early founders of quantum mechanics held the view thatthe participatory role of observation is fundamental and the underlying \"stuff\"of the cosmos is processes rather than the construct of some constant,underlying material substance.However, quantum theory does not say anything specific about the nature ofconsciousness-- the whole issue is clouded by basic uncertainty over even how to defineconsciousness. A firm grasp of human mental processes still remains veryelusive. We believe that this indicates a deeper problem which scientists ingeneral are reluctant to address: objective science is based on the dichotomybetween subject and object; it rests on the implicit assumption that Nature canbe studied ad infinitum as an external objective reality. The role of theobserver is, at best, secondary, if not entirely irrelevant.2. Consciousness and Quantum TheoryIn our view, it may well be that the subject-object dichotomy is false to beginwith and that consciousness is primary in the cosmos, not just an epiphenomenonof physical processes in a nervous system. Accepting this assumption would turnan exceedingly difficult problem into a very simple one. We will sidestep anyprecise definition of consciousness, limiting ourselves for now to willfulactions on the part of the observer. These actions, of course, are the outcomeof specific choices in the mind of the observer. Although some mental actionscould be automated, at some point the will of conscious observer(s) sets thewhole mechanical aspects of observation in motion.The issue of observation in QM is central, in the sense that objective realitycannot be disentangled from the act of observation, as the CopenhagenInterpretation (CI) clearly states (cf. Kafatos & Nadeau 2000; Kafatos 2009;Nadeau and Kafatos, 1999; Stapp 1979; Stapp 2004; Stapp 2007). In the words ofJohn A. Wheeler (1981), we live in an observerparticipatory universe. The vastmajority of today’s practicing physicists follow CI’s practical prescriptionsfor quantum phenomena, while still clinging to classical beliefs inobserver-independent local, external reality (Kafatos and Nadeau 2000). There isa critical gap between practice and underlying theory. In his Nobel Prize speechof 1932, Werner Heisenberg concluded that the atom \"has no immediate and directphysical properties at all.\" If the universe’s basic building block isn’tphysical, then the same must hold true in some way for the whole. The universewas doing a vanishing act in Heisenberg’s day, and it certainly hasn’t becomemore solid since.This discrepancy between practice and theory must be confronted, because theconsequences for the nature of reality are far-reaching (Kafatos and Nadeau,2000). An impressive body of evidence has been building to suggest that realityis non-local and undivided. Non-locality is already a basic fact of nature,first implied by the EinsteinPodolsky-Rosen thought experiment (EPR, 1935),despite the original intent to refute it, and later explicitly formulated inBell’s Theorem (Bell, 1964) and its relationship to EPR – for furtherdevelopments, see also experiments which favor QM over local realism, e.g.Aspect, Grangier, and Roger, 1982; Tittel, Brendel, Zbinden & Gisin, 1998. Onecan also cite the Aharonov-Bohm (1959) effect, and numerous other quantumphenomena.Moreover, this is a reality where the mindful acts of observation play a crucialrole at every level. Heisenberg again: \"The atoms or elementary particlesthemselves . . . form a world of potentialities or possibilities rather than oneof things or facts.\" He was led to a radical conclusion that underlies our ownview in this paper: \"What we observe is not nature itself, but nature exposed toour method of questioning.\" Reality, it seems, shifts according to theobserver’s conscious intent. There is no doubt that the original CI wassubjective (Stapp, 2007). However, as Bohr (1934) and Heisenberg (1958) as wellas the other developers of CI stated on many occasions, the view that emergedcan be summarized as, \"the purpose is not to disclose the real essence ofphenomena but only to track down… relations between the multifold aspects of ourexperience\" (Bohr, 1934). Stapp (2007) restates this view as \"quantum theory isbasically about relationships among conscious human experiences\" (Stapp 2007).Einstein fought against what he considered the positivistic attitude of CI,which he took as equivalent to Berkeley’s dictum to be is to be perceived(Einstein 1951), but he nevertheless admitted that QM is the only successfultheory we have that describes our experiences of phenomena in the microcosm.Quantum theory is not about the nature of reality, even though quantumphysicists act as if that is the case. To escape philosophical complications,the original CI was pragmatic: it concerned itself with the epistemology ofquantum world (how we experience quantum phenomena), leaving aside ontologicalquestions about the ultimate nature of reality (Kafatos and Nadeau, 2000). Thepractical bent of CI should be kept in mind, particularly as there is a tendencyon the part of many good physicists to slip back into issues that cannot betested and therefore run counter to the basic tenets of scientific methodology.To put specifics into the revised or extended CI, Stapp (2007) discusses Johnvon Neumann’s different types of processes. The quantum formalism eloquentlyformalized by von Neumann requires first the acquisition of knowledge about aquantum system (or probing action) as well as a mathematical formalism todescribe the evolution of the system to a later time (usually the Schrödingerequation). There are two more processes that Stapp describes: one, according tostatistical choices prescribed by QM, yields a specific outcome (or anintervention, a \"choice on the part of nature\" in Dirac’s words); the second,which is primary, preceding even the acquisition of knowledge, involves a \"freechoice\" on the part of the observer. This selection process is not and cannot bedescribed by QM, or for that matter, from any \"physically described part ofreality\" (Stapp, 2007).These extensions (or clarifications) of the original orthodox CI yield aprofoundly different way of looking at the physical universe and our role in it(Kafatos and Nadeau, 2000). Quantum theory today encompasses the interplay ofthe observer’s free choices and nature’s \"choices\" as to what constitute actualoutcomes. This dance between the observer and nature gives practical meaning tothe concept of the participatory role of the observer. (Henceforth we won’tdistinguish between the original CI and as it was extended by vonNeumann—referring to both as orthodox quantum theory.) As Bohr (1958)emphasized, \"freedom of experimentation\" opens the floodgates of free will onthe part of the observer. Nature responds in the statistical ways described byquantum formalism.Kafatos and Nadeau (2000) and Nadeau and Kafatos (1999) give extended argumentsabout these metaphysically-based views of nature. CI points to the limits ofphysical theories, including itself. If any capriciousness is to be found, itshould not be assigned to nature, rather to our mindset about how nature oughtto work. As we shall see, there are credible ways to build on quantum formalismand what it suggests about the role of consciousness.3. Quantum Mechanics and the BrainIt is essential that we avoid the mistake of rooting a physical universe in thephysical brain, for both are equally rooted in the non-physical. For practicalpurposes, this means that the brain must acquire quantum status, just as theatoms that make it up have. The standard assumption in neuroscience is thatconsciousness is a byproduct of the operation of the human brain. The multitudeof processes occurring in the brain covers a vast range of spatio-temporaldomains, from the nanoscale to the everyday human scale (e.g. Bernroider andRoy, 2004). Even though they differ on certain issues, a number of scientistsaccept the applicability of QM at some scales in the brain (cf. Kafatos 2009).For example, Penrose (1989, 1994) and Hameroff and Penrose (1996) postulatecollapses occurring in microtubules induced by quantum gravity. In their view,quantum coherence operates across the entire brain. Stapp (2007) prefers a setof different classical brains that evolve according to the rules of QM, inaccordance with the uncertainty principle. He contends that bringing in (thestill not developed) quantum gravity needlessly complicates the picture.In order for an integrative theory to emerge, the next step is to connect thequantum level of activity with higher levels. As a specific example of applyingquantum-like processes at mesoscale levels, Roy and Kafatos (1999b) haveexamined the response and percept domains in the cerebellum. They have built acase that complementarity or quantum-like effects may be operating in brainprocesses. As is well known, complementarity is a cornerstone of orthodoxquantum theory, primarily developed by Niels Bohr. Roy and Kafatos imagine ameasurement process with a device that selects only one of the eigenstates ofthe observable A and rejects all others. This is what is meant by selectivemeasurement in quantum mechanics. It is also called filtration because only oneof the eigenstates filters through the process. In attempting to describe bothmotor function and cognitive activities, Roy and Kafatos (1999a) use statisticaldistance in setting up a formal Hilbert-space description in the brain, whichillustrates our view that quantum formalism may be introduced for braindynamics.It is conceivable that the overall biological structures of the brain mayrequire global relationships, which come down processes to globalcomplementarity—every single process is subordinated to the whole. Not justsingle neurons but massive clusters and networks communicate all butinstantaneously. One must also account for the extreme efficiency with whichbiological organisms operate in a holistic manner, which may only be possible bythe use of quantum mechanical formalisms at biological, and neurophysiologicalrelevant scales (cf. Frohlich, 1983; Roy and Kafatos, 2004; Bernroider and Roy,2005; Davies, 2004, 2005; Stapp, 2004; Hameroff et. al., 2002; Hagan et. al.,2002; Hammeroff and Tuszynski, 2003; Rosa and Faber, 2004; Mesquita et. al.,2005; Hunter, 2006; Ceballos et al., 2007).Stepping into the quantum world doesn’t produce easy agreement, naturally. Theissue of decoherence (whereby the collapse of the wave function brings a quantumsystem into relationship with the macro world of large-scale objects and events)is often brought up in arguing against relevant quantum processes in the brain.However, neuronal decoherence processes have only been calculated while assumingthat ions, such as K+, are undergoing quantum Brownian motion (e.g. Tegmark,2000). As such, arguments about decoherence (Tegmark, 2000) assume that thesystem in question is in thermal equilibrium with its environment, which is nottypically the case for bio-molecular dynamics (e.g. Frohlich, 1986; Pokony andWu, 1998; Mesquita et. al., 2005).In fact, quantum states can be pumped like a laser, as Frohlich originallyproposed for biomolecules (applicable to membrane proteins, and tubulins inmicrotubules, see also work by Anirban, present volume). Also, experiments andtheoretical work indicate that the ions themselves do not move freely within theion-channel filter, but rather their states are pre-selected, leading topossible protection of quantum coherence within the ion channel for a time scaleon the order of 10-3 seconds at 300K, ~ time scale of ion-channel opening andclosing (e.g. Bernroider and Roy, 2005). Similar timescales apply tomicrotubular structures as pointed out by Hameroff and his co-workers. Moreover,progress in the last several years in high-resolution atomic X-ray spectroscopyfrom MacKinnon’s group (Jang et al. 2003) and molecular dynamics simulations(cf. Monroe 2002) have shown that the molecular organization in ion channelsallows for \"preorganized\" correlations, or ion trappings within the selectivityfilter of K+ channels. This occurs with five sets of four carbonyl oxygensacting as filters with the K+ ion, bound by eight oxygens, coordinatedelectrostatic interactions (Bernroider and Roy 2005). Therefore, quantumentangled states of between two subsystems of the channel filter result.Beyond the brain, evidence has mounted for quantum coherence in biologicalsystems at high temperatures, whereas in the past coherence was thought to applyto systems near absolute zero. For proteins supporting photosynthesis (Engel,et.al., 2007), solar photons on plant cells are converted to quantum electronstates which propagate or travel through the relevant protein by all possiblequantum paths, in reaching the part of the cell needed for conversion of energyto chemical energy. As such, new quantum ideas and laboratory evidenceapplicable to the fields of molecular cell biology and biophysics will have aprofound impact in modeling and understanding the process of coherence withinneuromolecular systems.4. Bridging the Gap: A Consciousness ModelOur purpose here is not to settle these technical issues – or the many othersthat have arisen as theorists attempt to link quantum processes to the field ofbiology – but to propose that technical considerations are secondary. What isprimary is to have a reliable model against which experiments can offerchallenges. Such a model isn’t available as long as we fail to account for thedisappearance of the material universe implied by quantum theory. Thisdisappearance is real. There is at bottom no strictly mechanistic, physicalfoundation for the cosmos. The situation is far more radical than mostpracticing scientists suppose. Whatever is the fundamental source of creation,it itself must be uncreated. Otherwise, there is a hidden creator lying in thebackground, and then we must ask who or what created that.What does it mean to be uncreated? The source of reality must beself-sufficient, capable of engendering complex systems on the micro and macroscale, self-regulating, and holistic. Nothing can exist outside its influence.Ultimately, the uncreated source must also turn into the physical universe, notsimply oversee it as God or the gods do in conventional religion. We feel thatonly consciousness fits the bill, for as a prima facie truth, no experiencetakes place outside consciousness, which means that if there is a realityexisting beyond our awareness (counting mathematics and the laws of physics as 1part of our conscious experience), we will never be able to know it. The factthat consciousness is inseparable from cognition, perception, observation, andmeasurement is undeniable; therefore, this is the starting point for newinsights into the nature of reality.What is the nature of consciousness in our model? We take it as a fieldphenomenon, analogous to but preceding the quantum field. This field ischaracterized by generalized principles already described by quantum physics:complementarity, non-locality, scaleinvariance and undivided wholeness. Butthere is a radical difference between this field and all others: we cannotdefine it from the outside. To extend Wheeler’s reasoning, consciousnessincludes us human observers. We are part of a feedback loop that links ourconscious acts to the conscious response of the field. In keeping withHeisenberg’s implication, the universe presents the face that the observer islooking for, and when she looks for a different face, the universe changes itsmask.Consciousness includes human mental processes, but it is not just a humanattribute. Existing outside space and time, it was \"there\" \"before\" those twowords had any meaning. In essence, space and time are conceptual artifacts thatsprang from primordial consciousness. The reason that the human mind meshes withnature, mathematics, and the fundamental forces described by physics, is noaccident: we mesh because we are a product of the same conceptual expansion bywhich primordial consciousness turned into the physical world. The difficultywith using basic terms like \"concept\" and \"physical\" is that we are accustomedto setting mind apart from matter; therefore, thinking about an atom isn’t thesame as an atom. Ideas are not substances. But if elementary particles and allmatter made of them aren’t substances, either, the playing field has beenleveled. Quantum theory gives us a model that applies everywhere, not just atthe micro level. The real question, then, isn’t how to salvage our everydayperception of a solid, tangible world but how to explore the mysterious edgewhere micro processes are transformed into macro processes, in other words, howNature gets from microcosm to macrocosm. There, where consciousness acquires thenature of a substance, we must learn how to unify two apparent realities intoone. We can begin to tear down walls, integrating objects, events, perceptions,thoughts, and mathematics under the same tent: all can be traced back to thesame source.Physics can serve a pivotal role in transitioning to this new model, because theentire biosphere operates under the same generalized principles we describedfrom the quantum perspective, as does the universe itself. This simple unifyingapproach must be taken, we realize, as a basic ontological assumption, since itcannot be proven in an objective sense. We cannot extract consciousness from thephysical universe, despite the fervent hope of materialists and reductionists.They are forced into a logical paradox, in fact, for either the molecules thatmake up the brain are inherently conscious (a conclusion to be abhorred inmaterialism), or a process must be located and described by which thosemolecules invent consciousness -such a process has not and never will bespecified. It amounts to saying that table salt, once it enters the body, findsa way to dissolve in the blood, enter the brain, and in so doing learns tothink, feel, and reason.Our approach, positing consciousness as more fundamental than anything physical,is the most reasonable alternative: Trying to account for mind as arising fromphysical systems in the end leads (at best) to a claim that mathematics is theunderlying \"stuff\" of the universe (or many universes, if you are of thatpersuasion). No one from any quarter is proposing a workable material substratumto the universe; therefore, it seems untenable to mount a rearguard defense formaterialism itself. As we foresee it, the future development of science willstill retain the objectivity of present-day science in a more sophisticated andevolved form. An evolved theory of the role of the observer will be generalizedto include physical, biological, and most importantly, awareness aspects ofexistence. In that sense, we believe the ontology of science will be undividedwholeness at every level. Rather than addressing consciousness from the outsideand trying to devise a theory of everything on that basis, a successful TheoryOf Everything (TOE) will emerge by taking wholeness as the starting point andfitting the parts into it rather than vice versa. Obviously any TOE must includeconsciousness as an aspect of \"everything,\" but just as obviously currentattempts at a TOE ignore this and have inevitably fallen into ontological traps.The time has come to escape those traps. An integrated approach will one dayprevail. When it does, science will become much stronger and develop to the nextlevels of understanding Nature, to everyone’s lasting benefit.ReferencesAharonov, Y., and Bohm, D.

Cosmic symmetry-breaking and the ensuingpreponderance of matter over anti-matter results in the hierarchi calarrangement of quarks into neutrons and positively charged protons and then the100 or so stable atomic nuclei, through the interaction of the strong and weaknuclear forces with electromagnetic charge, providing a rich array of stable,electromagnetically polarized, atoms with graduated energetics.The non-linear molecular orbital charge energetics that results in strongcovalent and ionic bonds also leads to a cascade of successively weaker bondingeffects from H-bonds, to van-der-Waal's interactions, whose globally cooperativenature is responsible for the primary, secondary, and tertiary structures ofproteins and nucl eic acids, and in a fractal manner to quaternary supra-molecular assemblies, cell organelles, cells, tissues and organisms. Thus, althoughgenetic coding is a necessary condition for the development of cell organellesand organismic tissues, this is possible only because the symmetry-broken lawsof nature can give rise to such dynamical structures. In this sense, tissue,culminating in the sentient brain, is the natural interactive full-complexityproduct of cosmic symmetry-breaking. Despite the periodi c quantum properties ofthe s, p, d and f-orbitals, which form the basis of the table of the elements,successive rows have non-periodic trends because of non-linear chargeinteractions, which result in a symmetrybreaking determining the bioelementspivotal to biogenesis. Life as we know it is based on the strong covalentbonding of first row elements C, N and O in relation to H, stemming from theoptimally strong multiple -CN, -CC-, and >CO bonds, which are cosmicallyabundant in forming star systems and readily undergo polymerization toheterocyclic molecules, including the nucleic acid bases A, U, G, C and avariety of amino acids, as well as optically active cofactors such asporphyrins.[images/00003.jpg]Fig 2: (a) Symmetry-breaking quasi-periodic table of the bioelements displayscovalent optimality. (b) Optimality of H20 in terms of internal weak-bondingexpressed in its high boiling point. (c) Evidence for a symmetry-breaking originof the genetic code. (d) Realized and proposed direct synthesis paths fromprimordial precursors such as HCN to nucleotides (Powner et. al. (2010).This interactive symmetry-breaking continues in a cascade. As we trend from C >N > O the electronegativity increases from non-polar C-H, to highlyelectronegative O, resulting in H2O having extreme optimal properties as a polarhydride, bifurcating moleculardynamics into polar and non-polar phases, in addition to pH, and H-bondingeffects, which define the aqueous structures and dynamics of proteins, nucleicacids, lipid membranes, ion and electron transport. Following on are secondaryproperties of S in lower energy -SH and -SS- bonds and the role of P asoligomeric phosphates in the energetics of biogenesis, cellular metabolism,dehydration polymerization and the nucleic acid backbone. We then havebifurcations of ionic properties K+/Na+ and Ca++/Mg++ and finally the catalyticrolesof transition elements as trace ingredients.This does not imply that this is the only elemental arrangement possible forlife, as organisms claimed to be adapted to use arsenic in the place ofphosphorus (Wolfe-Simon et. al. 2010) suggest, but it does confirm that life aswe know it has optimal symmetrybreaking properties cosmologically. Many of thefundamental molecules associ ated with membrane excitation, including lipidssuch as phosphatidyl choline and amine-based neurotransmitters, also havepotentially primordial status (King 1996). Effects of symmetry-breaking may alsoextend to the genetic code (King 1982). Recent research has begun to elucidate aplausible 'one-pot' rout e (Powner et. al. 2010) from simple cosmically abundantmolecules such as HCN and HCHO to the nucleotide units making up RNA, giving ourgenetic origin a potentially cosmological status. There have also been advanceswith inducing selected RNAs to self-assemble from precursors and assumecatalytic functions (see King 2011b).[images/00004.jpg]Fig 3: (a) Catalytic nicotine-adenine dinucleotide is essential in respiration.(b) Large and small subunits of the ribosome are centrally and functionally RNA[pink] (c) Molecular fossil evidence for a viral-based cellular transition fromthe RNA world to DNA based chromosomes, through cellular cooption of viralRNA-directed RNA-polymerase, followed by reverse transcriptase and finallyDNA-dependent DNA-polymerase. (d) Independent evolution of archaean andbacterial cellular life from a non-cellular form of life at the interface ofolivine and acid, iron-rich sea water forming 'lost city' undersea vents able tosolve the concentration and encapsulation problems (Martin and Russell 2003).3: Emergence of the Excitable Cell: From Universal Common Ancestor to EucaryotesLooking back at the universal common ancestor of life, likewise indicates atransition through an era in which RNA functioned as both catalyst andreplicator, through the establishment of the genetic code, whose ribosomalprotein translation units are still RNAbased, to the eventual emergence ofDNA-based life, probably through viral genes (King 2011a). However the geneticpicture of cell wall proteins is consistent with independent cellular origins ofbacteria and archaea, implying more than one evolution of cellular life from aprotected environment conducive to naked nucleotide replication (Martin andRussell 2003; Russell 2011).Nevertheless, once the branches of cellular life evolved, excitability based onion channels and pumps rapidly became universal. It has been reported that asearly as 3.3 billion years ago there was a massive genetic expansion, which mayhave contributed to the genes common to all forms of life (David and Alm 2010)facilitated by high levels of horizontal gene transfer, promoted by viruses(Dagan et. al. 2006; Wickramasinghe 2011).Estimates of the adaptive computational power of the collective bacterial andarchaean genome (King 2011a) give a presentation rate of new combinations of upto 1030 bits per second, compared with the current fastest computer at about1017 bit ops per second. Corresponding rates for complex life forms are muchlower, around 1017 per second, because they are fewer in total number and havelower reproduction rates and longer generation times. This picture of bit ratescoincides closely with the Archaean expansion scenario and suggests thatevolution has been a two-phase process of genetic algorithm super-computation,which arrived at a global solution to the notoriously intractableprotein-folding problems of the central metabolic and electro-chemical pathways,which are later capitalized on by eukaryotes and metazoa.[images/00005.jpg]Fig 4: (Left) Archaean genetic expansion around 3.3 billion years ago generatedmost critical genes common to life (David and Alm 2010) (Right) Evidence ofubiquitous horizontal transfer of genes between bacterial species at differenttrigger levels (Dagan et. al. 2006).Horizontal gene transfer, endosymbiosis and gene fusion may have led to asituation where sexuality and excitability, along with all the criticalcomponents for neural dynamics including ion-channels specific for Ca++, K+ andNa+, G-protein linked receptors, microtubules, and fast action potential becamecommon among eukaryotes (Wickramasinghe 2011). Ion channel structure appears tohave been established during the soup of lateral gene transfers that drove theevolution of eukaryotes. This means we should find neurotransmitter receptorsfrom GABA a, b, and glutamate, through opioid, to dopamine, epinephrine,serotonin and melatonin in all multi-cellular eukaryotes. This universalitywould have continued up the evolutionary tree, implying that the very differentnervous system designs of arthropods and vertebrates mask a deeper commonneurodynamic and genetic basis.[images/00006.jpg]Fig 5: Real-time purposive behavior in single cells (a) Paramecium reverses,turns right and explores a cul-de-sac.

Period 3 perturbedexcitations in alga Nitella indicate chaos. (g) Frog retinal rod cells aresensitive to single quanta in an ultra-low intensity beam.The evolutionary key to sentient consciousness may lie in the survival advantageit could provide in anticipating threats and strategic opportunities. Since keygenes for the brain evolved even before the Cambrian radiation (Wickramasinghe2011), the key to the emergence of conscious sentience may be sourced in theevolution of excitable single cells. Chaotic excitation provides a eukaryotecell with a generalized quantum sense organ. Sensitive dependence would give acell feedback about its external environment, perturbed by a variety of quantummodes - chemically through molecular orbital interaction, electromagneticallythrough photon emission and absorption, electrochemically through theperturbations of the fluctuating fields generated by the excitations, andthrough acoustic, mechanical and osmotic interaction.As we move to founding metazoa, we find Hydra, which supports only a primitivediffuse neural net, in continuous transformation and reconstruction, has a richrepertoire of up to 12 forms of 'intuitive' locomotion from snail-like slidingto somersaulting (King 2008), as well as coordinated tentacle movements. This isconsistent with much of the adaptive capacity of nervous systems arising fromcellular complexity, rather than neural net design alone. Pyramidal neurons forexample engage up to 104 synaptic junctions, having a diversity of excitatoryand inhibitory synaptic inputs involving up to five types of neurotransmitter,with differing effects depending on receptor types, and their location ondendrites, cell body, or axons.In the complex central nervous systems of vertebrates, we see the same dynamicalfeatures, now expressed in whole system excitations, such as the EEG, in whichinteracting excitatory and inhibitory neurons provide a basis for broadspectrumoscillation, phase coherence and chaos in the global dynamics, with the synapticorganization enabling the dynamics to resolve complex context-sensitivedecision-making problems. Nevertheless the immediate decisionmaking situationsaround which life or death results, in the theatre of conscious attention aresimilar to those made by single celled organisms, based strongly on sensoryinput, and short term anticipation of immediate existential threats andopportunities, in a context of remembered situations that bear upon the currentexperience.4: A Dynamical View of the Conscious BrainAlthough long distance axons involve pulse coded action potentials, the brainappears to utilize dynamic processing involving broad-spectrum oscillations,rather than discrete signals. Unlike the digital computer, the human brain is amassively parallel organ with perhaps the order of 10 synapses between input andoutput, despite having an estimated 1010 neurons and 1014 synapses. Such designis essential to enable quick reactions to complex stimuli in real time and avoidthe intractability problem of serial computers, which neural nets and geneticalgorithms do solve effectively.The cerebral cortex consists of six layers of cells organized in a sheet offunctional columns about 1mm square. These have a fractal modular architecture,with each column representing one aspect of experi ence, from primary processingof lines at given angles, color, motion and auditory tones, through to cellsrecognizing individual faces. Major areas of the cortex also follow a modularpattern centered on the primary senses and our coordinated motor responses toour ongoing situation. Frontal areas are involved in abstractions of motorevents, strategic planning and execution, parietal areas between touch andvisual cortices are involved in spatial abstractions, with the temporal lobesextending laterally beyond visual and auditory areas representing attributeswith specific meaning, such as specific faces and complex melodies, semantic andsymbolic process, such as language, and the temporal relationships betweenexperi ences. This is consistent with a 'holographic' model each experiencebeing represented collectively, like a Fourier transform, in terms of itsattributes consistently with the many-to-many connections neurons provide.[images/00007.jpg][images/00008.jpg][images/00009.jpg]Fig 6a,b,c,d,e,f: Structural overview of the brain as a dynamical organ. (a)Major anatomical features including the cerebral cortex, its underlying drivingcentres in the thalamus, and surrounding limbic regions involving emotion andmemory, including the cingulate cortex, hippocampus and amygdala. (b) Consciousactivity of the cortex is maintained through the activity of ascending pathwaysfrom the thalamus and brain stem, including the reticular activating system andserotonin and nor-adrenaline pathways involved in light and dreaming sleep.Processes which enable global dynamics to be affected by small perturbations.(c) Evidence for dynamical chaos includes modulated strange attractors (Freeman1991), and broad spectrum excitations with moderate fractal (correlation)dimensions (Basar et. al. 1989). These dynamics are complemented by holographicprocessing across the cortex illustrated in an experimental representation ofolfactory excitations corresponding to recognized odors (Skarda and Freeman1987). (d) Stochastic resonance enables fractal instabilities to grow from ionchannel to neuron to hippocampal excitation (Liljenstrm and Uno 2005). (e)Chandelier cells can facilitate an spreading of excitation to many pyramidalcells (Molnar et. al. 2008, Woodruff and Yuste 2008). (f) Wave front coherencein processing becomes manifest when a cue is recognized by the subject (left)(g) Correlation matrix and dendrogram of cortical slice is consistent withfractal selforganized criticality (Beggs and Plenz 2004).No single cortical area has been identified as the seat of consciousness (Joseph2009). One proposal (Ananthaswamy 2009, 2010) is that conscious processescorrespond to the coordinated activity of the whole brain engaging activecommunication in 'working memory' between the frontal cortex and major sensoryand association areas, while activity confined to regional processing issubconscious. This tallies with Bernard Baars' (1997) model of the Cartesiantheatre of consciousness as 'global workspace'.While major input and output pathways pass through thalamic nuclei underlyingthe cortex, two other systems modulate the dynamics of brain activity. Thecortex is energized by ascending pathways from the brain stem, involving thereticular activating system, and dopamine, nor-adrenalin and serotonin pathways,fanning out across wide areas of the cortex, modulating active wakefulness,dreaming and sleep. Our emotional experiences are modulated through the limbicsystem, a lateral circuit, passing through the hypothalamus regulating internaland hormonal processes, the cingulate cortex dealing with emotionalrepresentations, and the hippocampus and amygdala, setting down sequentialmemories and dealing with flight and fight survival.There is also evidence active conscious processing corresponds to (30-80 Hz) EEGoscillations in the gamma band, driven by mutual feedback between excitatory andinhibitory neurons in the cortex, and that phase coherence distinguishes'in-synch' neuronal assemblies forming conscious thought process from peripheralpre-processing (Basar et. al. 1989, Crick & Koch 1992).While the brain may be 'holographic' spatially, it appears to use phases ofdynamical chaos in the time domain. Modulated transitions at the edge of chaoscan explain many phenomena, from perception to insight learning in a 'eureka'brain wave. In olfactory perception, the brain appears to enter high energychaos, which frees the dynamic from getting inappropriately locked-in, asannealing does in formal networks, fully-exploring dynamical space, followed bya reduction of energy, causing the dynamic to fall, either into a recognizedstate, represented by a strange attractor, or to form a new attractor through anadaptive change in the potential energy landscape, through learning (Skarda andFreeman 1987). The same idea fits with the 'eureka' of insight, where anunstable dynamic generated by the problem is resolved in a single bifurcationfrom chaotic instability into lucidity.Non-linear mode-locking, common to oscillating chaotic systems, has thepotential to facilitate the coherent excitations that characterize coupledneurosystems, going a good way towards resolving the 'binding' problem how thebrain 'brings it all back together'. By modulating the coupling betweenoscillating neurosystems, mode-locking could selectively bring related systemsinto phase coherence, just as the heartbeat is mode-locked to its local andbrain pacemakers.Chaos also makes the brain state arbitrarily sensitive to small perturbations,which is essential for a dynamical brain to be sensitive to small changes in itsenvironment, and to its local instabilities. If the global state is criticallypoised at a tipping point, an unstable chaotic dynamic could become sensitive toperturbations at the level of the cell, synapse, or ion channel. There areseveral additional ways in which such sensitivity could come about. Stochasticresonance has been demonstrated to facilitate sensitivity, from ion channel, tocell, to global dynamic (Liljenstrm and Uno 2005). Fractal self-organizedcriticality has been found in cortical slices (Beggs and Plenz 2004). Chandeliercells have been shown to facilitate lateral spreading of local excitations tomultiple pyramidal cells (Molnar et. al. 2008, Woodruff and Yuste 2008).5: Quantum Dynamics and Conscious AnticipationThe two key questions confounding science about the brain are (1) how and whybrain function generates subjective experience, and (2) whether there is anybasis for our subjective conscious intentions having physical consequences in'free-will' (Joseph 2009, 2011).We thus explore how central to neurodynamic processes might exploit quantumeffects to enhance survival prospects of the organism. To develop a realisticquantum theory of consciousness, we have to consider how whole brain statesmight become capable of quantum interaction (Joseph 2009) and how this couldarise from neurophysiological processes common to excitable cells.[images/00010.jpg]Fig 7: Features of quantum processing in proposed models. (a) Microtubule MAPproteins as envisaged in the OOR model (Hameroff and Penrose 2003). (b) Theensuing relationship between classical and quantum computing and consciousness.(c, d) gated K+ ion channels from MacKinnon's group (Zhou et. al. 2001). (e)Fractal kinetics in the channels (Liebovitch et. al.) (f) Synaptic junction mayinvoke uncertainty of position of the vesicle.We have seen that various forms of global instability, from chaos, throughtipping points to self-organized criticality could make the global brain stateultimately sensitive to change at the cellular, molecular or quantum level. Ionchannels, such as for acetyl-choline display non-linear (quadratic)concentration dynamics, being excited by two molecules. Many aspects of synapticrelease are also highly non-linear, due to biochemical feedback loops. A singlevesicle excites up to 2000 ion channels, providing extreme amplification of apotentially quantum event. In addition to being candidates for quantumcoherence, voltage gated ion channels display fract al kinetics (Liebovitch1987).How interacting systems respond to the quantum suppression of chaos, inprocesses such as scarring of the wave function (Gutzwiller 1992), receivedclarification (Chaudhury et. al. 2009, Steck 2009), when it was discovered thatan electron in an orbit around a Cs atom in a classically chaotic regime entersinto entanglement with nuclear spin. This illustrates how the chaotic'billiards' of molecular kinetics, and chaotic membrane excitation, might becomeentangled with other states at the quantum level. One characteristic oftimedependent quantum 'chaos' is transient chaotic behavior ending up in aperiodic orbital scar as wave spreading occurs. This would suggest that chaoticsensitivity, with an increasing dominance by quantum uncertainty over time,would contribute to which entanglements ultimately occur in a given kineticencounter.The evolutionary argument is a potent discriminator of models of consciousness.Quantum attributes making subjective consciousness possible need to evolve inconfluence with essential physiological processes, thus potentially dating backto the epoch when the central components of modulated excitability evolved. Manytheories of consciousness have been devised invoking quantum processes whichemphasize unusual interpretations of physics, esoteric forms of quantumcomputation invoking properties extraneous to the known physiological functionsof biological organelles, or hypothetical fields in addition to knownphysiology, raising questions as to whether they pass the evolutionary test. Oneof the most famous is Hameroff and Penrose's (2003) OOR theory combiningobjective reduction of the wave function with hypothetical forms of quantumcomputing on microtubules, which might be extended between cells through gapjunctions. These are extensively discussed in the supporting online material,(King 2011b).One idea fitting closely with neurophysiology is Bernroider's (2003, 2005)proposal that quantum coherence may be sustained in ion channels long enough tobe relevant for neural processes and that the channels could be entangl ed withsurrounding lipids and proteins and with other channels in the same membrane. Hesuggests that the ion channel functions through quantum coherence. MacKinnon'sgroup (Zhou et. al. 2001) have shown that the K +-specific ion channel filterworks by holding two K+ ions bound to water structures induced by protein sidechains. These have similarities to models of quantum computing using ion traps.The solitonic nature of action potentials could provide such entangledconnectivity between channels.[images/00011.jpg]Fig 8: Wheeler delayed choice experiment (1) shows that a decision can be madeafter a photon from a distant quasar has traversed a gravitationally lensinggalaxy by deciding whether to detect which way the photon traveled or todemonstrate it went both ways by sampling interference. The final state at theabsorber thus appears to be able to determine past history of the photon.Quantum erasure (2) likewise enables a distinction already made, which wouldprevent interference, to be undone after the photon is released. Feynmandiagrams (3) show similar timereversible behavior. In particular time reversedelectron scattering (d) is identical to positron creation-annihilation. (4a) Inthe transactional interpretation (Cramer 1983), a single photon exchangedbetween emitter and absorber is formed by constructive interference between aretarded offer wave (solid) and an advanced confirmation wave (dotted). (b)Experiments of quantum entanglement involving pair-splitting are resolved bycombined offer and confirmation waves, because confirmation waves intersect atthe emission point.

(5) Scarring of the wave function of the quantum stadium alongrepelling orbits (Gutzwiller 1992). (6) Generation of quantum entanglement byquantum chaos in the quantum kicked top (Chaudhury et. al. 2009, Steck 2009).While decoherence theories and objective reduction do not provide an active rolefor will, several physicists have suggested consciousness could play a part inthe way the wave function representing a superposition of states, collapses toone real instance of the particle. Quantum theory predicts Schrodinger's catsubjected to cyanide if a radioactive scintillation occurs, is in a shadowysuperposition - both alive and dead. In our conscious experience of the realworld, we find the cat is either alive or dead. This suggests subjectiveconsciousness could play an intervening role within quantum reality, reducingthe superabundance of quantum probability multiverses to the historical processwe experience. If so, consciousness may have a direct window on the entangledsub-quantum realm (Joseph 2009). We thus explore a model of quantumanticipation, which could extend back to single celled evolution.Feynman diagrams of quantum interactions show that the quantum interaction istimereversible. The diagram for electron scattering, when the scattered electronpath is timereversed, becomes positron creation and annihilation. Moreover inreal quantum experiments, such as quantum erasure and the Wheeler delayed-choiceexperiment, it is possible to change how an intervening wave-particle behaves bymaking different measurements after the wave-particle has passed through the'apparatus'. All forms of quantum entanglement possess this time-symmetricproperty. John Cramer (1983) incorporat ed time-symmetry into the 'transactionalinterpret ation' of quantum mechanics, in which space-time handshaking betweenthe future and past becomes the basis of each real quantum interaction. Theemitter of a particle sends out an offer wave forwards and backwards in time,whose energies cancel. The prospective absorbers respond with confirmationwaves, and the real quantum exchange arises from constructive interferencebetween the retarded component of the chosen emitter's offer wave and theadvanced, time-reversing component of the chosen absorber's confirmation wave.The boundary conditions defining the exchange thus involve both past and futurestates of the universe. Upon wave function collapse, the exchanged real particletraveling from the emitter to the absorber is identical with its negative energyanti-particle traveling backwards in time. The transactional interpretation is aheuristic device, which is not essential to the argument, since its predictionscoincide, largely, or exclusively with conventional quantum mechanics, but itdoes highlight future boundary conditions, which could play a part in consciousanticipation. Regardless of the interpretation of quantum mechanics we use, anexchanged particl e has a wave function existing throughout the space-timeinterval in which it exists, so any process involving collapse of a wavefunction has boundary conditions extending in principle throughout space-time,involving future prospective absorbers. Advanced entanglement becomes clear inexperiments creating two entangled particles (Aspect 1981), where subsequentmeasurement of the polarization of one photon immediately results in the otherhaving complementary polarization, although neither had a defined polarizationbeforehand. The only way this correlation can be maintained within quantumreality is through a wave function extending back to the creation event of thepair and forward again in time to the other particle.If subjective consciousness has a complementary role to brain function,correlated with entangled, quanta emitted and absorbed by the biological brain,it is then correlated with a superposition of possible states in the brain'sfuture, as well as having access to memories of the past. In pair-splittingexperiments, the boundary conditions do not permit a classically-causalexploitation. This does not result in a contradiction here, because the brainstate is quantum indeterminate and the conscious experience corresponding to theentangled collapse provides an intuitive 'hunch', not a causal deduction.A possible basis for the emergence of subjective consciousness, which could alsobe pivotal in explaining the source of free-will, is thus that the excitablecell gained a fundamental form of anticipation of threats to survival. Thesecells also evolved the ability to perceive strategic opportunities, throughanticipatory quantum non-locality induced by chaotic excitation of the cellmembrane, in which the cell becomes both an emitter and absorber of its ownexcitations. Non-locality in space-time is a fundamental quantum property sharedby all physical systems, including macroscopic systems with coherent resonance.The coherent global excitations in the gamma range associated with consciousstates, could thus be the 'excitons' in such a quantum model. Unlike quantumcomputing, which depends on not being disturbed by decoherence caused byinteraction with other quanta. Stringent requirements, avoiding decoherence, maynot apply to transactions, where real particle exchange occurs even underscattering.Quantum phenomena abound in biological tissues. Entanglement has been observedin healthy tissues in quantum coherence MRI imaging and bird navigation has beensuggested to use entangled electrons. Excitations in photosynthetic antennaehave also been shown to perform spatial quantum computing. Enzyme activationenergy transition states and synaptic transmission also use quantum tunneling.By making the organism sensitive to a short envelope of time, extending into theimmediate future, as well as the past, subjective consciousness could thus gainan evolutionary advantage, making the organism sensitive to anticipated threatsto survival as well as hunting and foraging opportunities. It is these primaryneeds, guided by the nuances of hunch and familiarity, rather than formalcalculations, that the central nervous systems of vertebrates have evolved tosuccessfully handle. Such temporal anticipation need not be of causal efficacybut just provide a small statistical advantage, complemented by computationalbrain processes associated with learning, which edge-of-chaos wave processing isideally positioned to do.These objectives are shared in precisely the same way by single-celled organismsand complex nervous systems. Because of the vastly longer evolutionary timesince the Archaean expansion, than the Cambrian metazoan radiation, and the factthat all the components of neuronal excitability were already present when themetazoa emerged, quantum anticipation could have become an evolutionary featureof single celled eukaryot es, before metazoa evolved.[images/00012.jpg]Fig 9: Expression of rhodopsin in the CNS shows both strong selective neuronalactivity and a focal expression in the occipital cortex consistent with functionin primary visual areas (King 2007).6: Quantum Sensitivity, Sensory Transduction and Subjective ExperienceOne of the mysteries that distinguish the richness of subjective consciousexperience from the colorless logic of electrodynamics is that sensoryexperiences of vision, sound, smell and touch are richly and qualitatively sodifferent that it is difficult to see how mere variations in neuronal firingorganization can give rise to such qualitatively different subjective affects.How is it that when dreaming, or in a psychedelic reverie, we can experienceornate visions, hear entrancing music, or smell fragrances as rich, real,intense and qualitatively diverse as those of waking life?Since the senses are actually fundamental quantum modes by which biologicalorganisms can interact with the physical world, this raises the question whethersubjective sensory experience is in some way related to the quantum modes bywhich the physical senses communicate with the world (Joseph 2009). Clearly oursenses are sensitive to the quantum level.Individual frog rod cells have been shown to respond to individual photons, thequietest sound involves movements in the inner ear of only the radius of ahydrogen atom and single molecules are sufficient to excite pheromonalreceptors. Many genes we associate with peripheral sensory transduction inseveral senses are also expressed in the mouse brain (King 2007) at least in theform of RNA transcripts, including stomatin-like protein 3 associated withtouch, epsin, otocadherin and otoferlin associated with hearing, and severaltypes of opsin, including rhodopsin and encephalopsin. This suggests the braincould harbour an 'internal sensory system' which might play a role in generatingthe 'internal model of reality', although these ideas are speculative and it isa major challenge to see how such processes could be activated reversibly in theCNS.Several researchers (Pocket 2000, McFadden 2002) have proposed that neuralexcitation is associated with electromagnetic fields, which might play aformative role in brain dynamics. Attention has recently been focused onbiophotons as a possible basis of processing in the visual cortex based onquantum releases in mitochondrial redox reactions (Rahnama et. al. 2010, Bkkonet. al. 2010). Microtubules have also been implicated (Cifra et. al. 2010).All excitable cells have ion channels, which undergo conformation changesassociated with voltage, and orbital or 'ligand'-binding, both of internaleffectors such as G-proteins and externally via neurotransmitters, such asacetylcholine. They also have osmotic and mechano-receptive activation, as inhearing, and in some species can be also activated directly and reversibly byphotoreception. Conformation changes of ion channels are capable of exchangingphotons, phonons, mechano-osmotic effects and orbital perturbations,representing a form of quantum synesthesia. Since the brain uses up to 40% ofour metabolic energy for functions with little or no direct energy output, it isplausible that some of the 'dissipated' energy could be generating novel formsof interaction.[images/00013.jpg]Fig 10: Psychedelic and dreaming states provide conscious experiences as intenseand subjectively veridical as real world sensory experiences, but with verydifferent structure and dynamics.7: Complementarity, Symmetry-breaking, Subjective Consciousness, and CosmologyThis leads to the most perplexing chasm facing the scientific description ofreality. What is the existential nature of subjective consciousness, from wakinglife, through dreaming to psychedelic and mystical experi ence, and does it havecosmological status in relation to the physical universe?The key entities forming the physical universe manifest as symmetry-brokencomplementarities. Quanta are waveparticles, with complementary discreteparticle and continuous wave aspects. The fundamental forces are symmetry brokenin a manner that results in complementary force-radiation bearing bosons andmatter forming fermions. In the standard model these have symmetry brokenproperties, with differing collections of particles. Supersymmetry proposes eachboson has a fermion partner to balance their positive and negative energycontributions, but E8's 112 'bosonic' and 128 'fermionic' root vectors, suggestsymmetry-breaking could be fundamental (Fielder and King 2010).Further symmetry-broken complementarities apply to the biological world, wherethe dyadic sexes of complex organisms and many eukaryot es are bothcomplementary and symmetry broken, with themes of discreteness and continuityeven more obviously expressed at the level of sperm and ovum than in our highlysymmetry-broken human bodily forms, involving pregnancy, live birth andlactation.The relationship between subjective consciousness and the physical universedisplays a similar complementarity, with profound symmetry breaking. The 'hardproblem of consciousness research' (Chalmers 1995) underlines the fundamental differences between subjective 'qualia' and the participatory continuity of theCartesian theatre on the one hand, and the objective, analyzable properties ofthe physical world around us.Although we depend on a pragmatic accept ance of the real world, knowing we willpass out if concussed and could die if we cut our veins, from birth to death,the only veridical reality we experience is the envelope of subjective consciousexperience. It is only through the consensual regularities of subjectiveconsciousness that we come to know the real world and discover its natural andscientific properties. As pointed out by Indian philosophy, this suggests thatmind is more fundamental than matter. The existential status of subjectiveconsciousness thus also has a claim to cosmological status.A further cosmological interpret ation of consciousness we have noted inassociation with the cat paradox is that it may function to solve the problem ofsuper-abundance, by reducing probability multiverses to the unique course ofhistory we know and witness. This view of consciousness in shaping the universeis consistent with several of the conclusions of biocentrism (Lanza 2009).The lessons of quantum and fundamental particle complement arity andsymmetrybreaking, sexuality and the Yin-Yang complementarity of the Tao and ofShakti-Shiva in Tantric mind-world cosmologies, lead to a cosmology ofconsciousness, as symmetrybroken complement to the physical universe.ReferencesAnanthaswamy, A.

Although it is today ascontroversial as ever, its impact is beyond discussion. This paper examines someof the early formulations of anthropic ideas, including those of Russiancosmologists G. Idlis and A. Zelmanov. These early formulations are at bestvague anticipations of the anthropic principle, which as a research tool forcosmological theory was first proposed by B. Carter in 1973. The paper offers anaccount of how Carter came to the idea of the anthropic principle and how heoriginally formulated it.Key Words: Anthropic principle, Carter, Dicke, Dirac, cosmic coincidences,Eddington, Idlis, large numbers, principle of cognizability, Zelmanov. 1. Some Pre-Carter Anthropic IdeasThe general meaning of the anthropic principle is that what we observe must becompatible with our existence or, more generally, with the existence of advancedlife. Humans can occupy only a universe like ours, and this explains in a sensewhy the universe is as it is. Today the anthropic principle is often seen as aselection principle operating in the context of the multiverse, a view whichgoes back to Brandon Carter's original formulation nearly 40 years ago. Theprinciple has a rich prehistory and anticipations of it can, if only with aconsiderable amount of hindsight, be found as far back in time as in ancientGreece (Ćirković, 2003; Barrow & Tipler, 1986). However, I shall limit myremarks to a few possible and not well known precursors of the twentiethcentury, including James Jeans and Arthur Eddington from the period between thetwo world wars.Speculations about the role of life in the universe were a common theme inJeans's many popular addresses. In a lecture of 1926 he argued that the liquidstate, and hence the existence of ordinary water, required very specialconditions. More generally he emphasized that \"the physical conditions underwhich life is possible form only a tiny fraction of the range of physicalconditions which prevail in the universe as a whole.\" Moreover, \"In everyrespect space, time, physical conditions life is limited to an almostinconceivably small corner of the universe\" (Jeans, 1926, p. 40). Thefine-tuning necessary for life formed an important part of the later anthropicprinciple, but Jeans did not explicitly associate it with either the constantsof nature or cosmic evolution. Indeed, by 1926 the expanding universe was stillin the future.Eddington was convinced that the laws of nature are indirectly imposed by thehuman mind which largely determines the nature and extent of what we know aboutthe universe. In his method known as selective subjectivism he appealed toselection arguments somewhat similar to those later associated with theanthropic principle. He argued that the number of particles in the universe (N ≅1079) and most other constants were determined by mental and therefore humanfactors, namely \"the influence of the sensory equipment with which we formulatethe results of observation of knowledge.\" This influence, he said, \"is sofar-reaching that by itself it decides the number of particles into which thematter of the universe appears to be divided\" (Eddington 1939, p. 60).Eddington's anthropic-like reasoning related specifically to the human mind, notto advanced life in general.It is often stated that Fred Hoyle applied anthropic arguments as early as 1953,namely in his famous prediction of a 7.7 MeV resonance level in carbon-12. In1952 Edwin Salpeter had suggested a \"triple alpha\" process according to whichthree alpha particles would fuse into a carbon-12 nucleus under the physicalconditions governing the interior of some stars. Hoyle recognized thatSalpeter's process would only work if there existed a resonance level of about7.7 MeV, which was subsequently found experimentally (Salpeter, 1955; Kragh,2010). Since carbon is a prerequisite for life as we know it, we would not behere had it not been because of this particular energy level. Hoyle's successfulprediction has often been quoted as \"the only genuine anthropic prediction\" and\"evidence to support the argument that the Universe has been designed for ourbenefit tailor-made for man\" (Gribbin & Rees, 1989, p. 247). However, Hoyle doesnot qualify as the originator of the anthropic principle. Although he did indeedpredict the resonance level necessary for the production of carbon, and thenlife, his prediction owed little to anthropic reasoning (for details andreferences, see Kragh, 2010).A few years after Hoyle's non-anthropic prediction, in 1958, the Russianastronomer Grigory Moiseevich Idlis published a paper in the Proceedings of theAstrophysical Institute of the Kazach Academy of Sciences in which he vaguelyanticipated the anthropic principle. It is however unclear to what extent, sincethe obscure paper only exists in Russian language. In a later review Idlis(2001) claimed to be the true discoverer of the anthropic principle, a claimwhich was supported by his famous compatriot, the pioneer cosmologist YakovZel'dovich (1981). According to Idlis (1982, p. 357), in 1958 he argued that\"properties of the Metagalaxy...\" universe \" are, generally speaking, just thenecessary and sufficient conditions for the natural origination and evolution oflife to higher intelligence forms of matter, similar to man, finally aware ofitself.\"If Idlis's paternity to the anthropic principle is questionable, so is the claimthat a version of the principle was formulated even earlier by AbrahamLeonidovich Zelmanov, a Russian physicist and cosmologist who in the 1940s didimportant work on inhomogeneous cosmological models (Zelmanov, 2006). Zelmanovargued for an intimate interdependence between observers and the observeduniverse, including the idealist claim that \"If no observers exist then theobservable universe as well does not exist.\" He also stressed that \"humanity canexist only with the specific scale of the numerical values of the cosmologicalconstants [and] is only an episode in the life of the universe\" (Rabounski,2006, p. 35). Zelmanov seems never to have published his anthropicconsiderations. Moreover, what we know of them lacks proper documentation. Ibelieve the priority claims of Idlis and Zelmanov are unconvincing.2. Large Cosmic Numbers: Dirac and DickeWhile Carter was unaware of Idlis and Zelmanov, he was to some extent influencedby the views of Paul Dirac, Robert Dicke and John Wheeler. The cosmologicaltheory that Dirac proposed in 1937 was based on the relationship between twolarge dimensionless numbers:[images/00014.jpg]T0 denotes the Hubble time, M the mass of the proton, and Δt =e2/mc3 ≅ 10-24 s is anatomic time unit; the other symbols have their usual meanings. According toDirac (1937), the numerical relationship was a permanent feature, valid for anyvalue of the Hubble time and not only for the present one. From this he inferredthat the gravitational constant slowly decreased in time according to G ~ 1/t.He did not refer to life in his paper of 1937. More than twenty years laterDicke reconsidered the significance of Dirac's large numbers which he expressedin a somewhat different way:[images/00015.jpg]where T is the age of the universe, T ≈ T0. In terms of the Planck mass thefirst number,which is equal to the inverse of the gravitational coupling constant, can bewritten as [images/00016.jpg]Dicke pointed out that the present age is not random, as assumed by Dirac, butcharacterized by the existence of carbon and other heavy elements. He arguedthat \"T is not permitted to take one of an enormous range of values, but issomehow limited by the biological requirements to be met during the epoch ofman\" (Dicke, 1961, p. 441). Dicke's critical analysis of the large numbers foundin nature was followed by a reply from Dirac (1961), who knew of the paper inadvance of its publication:On this [Dicke's], assumption habitable planets could exist only for a limitedperiod of time. With my assumption they could exist indefinitely in the futureand life need never end. There is no decisive argument for deciding betweenthese assumptions. I prefer the one that allows the possibility of endless life.Dirac had for a long time been devoted to the doctrine of eternal intelligentlife in the universe, a doctrine that would later form the basis of the finalanthropic principle (FAP). In private notes of 1933 he stated as his credo that\"the human race will continue to live for ever and will develop and progresswithout limit.\" What he characterized as an \"article of faith\" was \"anassumption that I must make for my peace of mind. Living is worthwhile only ifone can contribute in some small way to this endless chain of progress\"(Farmelo, 2009, p. 221).3. Towards the Anthropic PrincipleAustralian-born Brandon Carter wanted to understand the role of microphysicalparameters in cosmology. In 1967, while a PhD student at Cambridge University,he wrote a manuscript on the subject which circulated among a small number ofphysicists. Carter's purpose was \"to clarify the significance of the famouscoincidence between the Hubble age of the universe and a certain combination ofmicrophysical parameters,\" that is, the same relationship N1 ∼ N2 which Dickehad considered in 1961. This coincidence, he said, \"canbe fully explained in principle in terms of conventional physics and cosmology,so that revolutionary departures such as Dirac's hypothesis of varyinggravitational constant, or Eddington's Fundamental Theory are not justified\"(Carter, 2007, p. 1). Surprisingly, he was at that time unacquainted with theworks of Dicke, which he only came to know about the following year (E-mail fromCarter to the author, 18 February 2010). Although he was aware of Dirac's LargeNumber Hypothesis, which he knew from Hermann Bondi's textbook Cosmology, he didnot mention it in his manuscript of 1967. It is also worth noticing that he wasnot yet acquainted with the works of Salpeter and Hoyle on the triplealphaprocess generating carbon-12 in the stars.The first time Carter had an opportunity to present his ideas of what wouldbecome the anthropic principle was at a meeting in February 1970 in Princetonorganized by Wheeler. At this meeting, a commemoration of the works of theEnglish nineteenth-century mathematician William Kingdon Clifford, he gave atalk on \"Large Numbers in Astrophysics and Cosmology\" in which he argued thatthe universe could only be understood if life and observers were taken intoaccount. He did not, at that time, speak of an anthropic principle. Carter'sideas were known to a small group of physicists and cosmologists before theyfinally appeared in print in 1974. Wheeler, Stephen Hawking and Freeman Dysonhad participated in the Clifford memorial meeting in Princeton and discussedCarter's presentation. They were receptive to his ideas, which they found to befascinating, such as shown by their published responses (Rees et al. 1974, p.307; Hawking, 1974; Dyson, 1972). As early as 1972, in a review of the possibletime variation of the constants of nature, Dyson referred to Carter's \"principleof cognizability.\" Dyson considered Dicke's numbers N1 and N2, which he rewroteas[images/00017.jpg]where H is the Hubble parameter, H = 1/T. He took the principle of cognizabilityto imply that \"the presence in the universe of conscious observers places limitson the absolute magnitudes of γ and δ and not only on their ratio\" (Dyson, 1972,p. 235).4. Carter's Address of 1973On 10-12 September 1973 the International Astronomical Union held a meeting inCracow, Poland, dedicated to the 500th anniversary of the birth of Copernicus.One of the sessions was chaired by Wheeler, on whose suggestion Carter gave apresentation of his anthropic considerations (Longair, 1974, p. 289). Anextended version of the lecture appeared the following year in the proceedingsof the conference edited by the Cambridge astrophysicist Malcolm Longair. Thelecture and the corresponding article entitled \"Large Number Coincidences andthe Anthropic Principle in Cosmology\" marks the true beginning of the anthropicprinciple. Hawking was also present at the Cracow meeting, where he gave a talkin which he suggested that the isotropy of the universe followed from anthropicarguments. He did not refer to the anthropic principle, but to the \"Dicke-Carteridea\" (Hawking, 1974).Appropriately, at a meeting celebrating Copernicus, Carter introduced his topicwith a reference to the so-called Copernican principle, the doctrine that we donot occupy a privileged position in the universe. But it was a criticalreference: \"Unfortunately there has been a strong (not always subconscious)tendency to extend this to a most questionable dogma to the effect that oursituation cannot be privileged in any sense\" (Carter, 1974, p. 291). Carterobjected that there is indeed a sense in which our situation is privileged,namely a temporal sense. We obviously live in the epoch of life, which is farfrom random.The large number coincidences considered by Eddington, Dirac and Dicke should beunderstood in terms of \"what may be termed the anthropic principle to the effectthat what we can expect to observe must be restricted by the conditionsnecessary for our presence as observers.\" It is necessary to take into accountour special situation and properties when interpreting observational data, justas it is necessary to take into account the special properties of measuringinstruments.The name that Carter introduced in 1974 has proved highly successful, but it isgenerally recognized, and admitted by Carter himself, that it invitesassociations that are both unfortunate and unintended. At a conference in 1989he proposed as a more informative and less ethnocentric name \"observer selfselection principle,\" thereby stressing that what is important to mostapplications of the anthropic principle is observers and not human beings(Carter, 1993, p. 38). Neither this name nor other alternative names, such asthe \"biophilic\" principle, have caught on.In addition to this \"weak\" anthropic principle (WAP), Carter introduced a\"strong\" version (SAP) according to which \"the Universe (and hence thefundamental parameters on which it depends) must be such as to admit thecreation of observers within it at some stage.\" Whether in one form or other hethought that the new antropic principle would only have explanatory power ifassociated with the idea of a world ensemble, the assumption that there existsnumerous other universes. These other universes would be really existing andcharacterized by all possible combinations of initial conditions and fundamentalconstants. However, contrary to most later ideas of the multiverse, he onlyconsidered as real those universes which can accommodate observers of some kind.Carter felt that his suggestion of an anthropic multiverse (a word not yetcoined) was justified by Hugh Everett's manyworlds interpretation of quantummechanics to which \"one is virtually forced by the internal logic of quantumtheory\" (Carter, 1974, p. 298). At the time this was a view shared only by aminority of physicists. According to Carter's argument our universe is specialby providing conditions for intelligent life. Since no reasons can be given forthe nonexistence of numerous other universes without observers, he found itnatural to assume that they do exist.Carter was well aware that the new anthropic approach to cosmology wasunorthodox and problematic from both a scientific and philosophical perspective.Realizing the speculative and non-testable nature of the strong principle hecalled it \"rather more questionable\" than the weak one. Did anthropicexplanations, relying as they did on the assumption of other universes, qualifyas bona fide explanations? \"I would personally be happier,\" he admitted at theend of his paper, \"with explanations of the values of the fundamental couplingconstants etc. based on a deeper mathematical structure in which they would nolonger be fundamental but would be derived.\" He reckoned a similar kind ofproblem in relation to anthropic predictions, which differed fundamentally fromthose ordinarily used in physics. Predictions based on the anthropic principle,he wrote, \"will not be completely satisfying from a physicist's point of viewsince the possibility will remain of finding a deeper underlying theoryexplaining the relationships that have been predicted.\" Indeed, over the nextdecades questions of this kind would be hotly debated, both by cosmologists andphilosophers. Currently they are mostly discussed within the framework of thestringbased landscape multiverse (Carr, 2007), but they have their origin inCarter's address of 1973.REFERENCESBarrow, J. D., Tipler, F.

We proposed in the mid 1990's that consciousnessdepends on biologically 'orchestrated' quantum computations in collections ofmicrotubules within brain neurons, that these quantum computations correlatewith and regulate neuronal activity, and that the continuous Schrödingerevolution of each quantum computation terminates in accordance with the specificDiósi-Penrose (DP) scheme of 'objective reduction' of the quantum state (OR).This orchestrated OR activity (Orch OR) is taken to result in a moment ofconscious awareness and/or choice. This particular (DP) form of OR is taken tobe a quantum-gravity process related to the fundamentals of spacetime geometry,so Orch OR suggests a connection between brain biomolecular processes andfine-scale structure of the universe. Here we review and update Orch OR in lightof criticisms and developments in quantum biology, neuroscience, physics andcosmology. We conclude that consciousness plays an intrinsic role in theuniverse.KEY WORDS: Consciousness, microtubules, OR, Orch OR, quantum computation,quantum gravity 1. Introduction: Consciousness, Brain and EvolutionConsciousness implies awareness: subjective experience of internal and externalphenomenal worlds. Consciousness is central also to understanding, meaning andvolitional choice with the experience of free will. Our views of reality, of theuniverse, of ourselves depend on consciousness. Consciousness defines ourexistence.Three general possibilities regarding the origin and place of consciousness inthe universe have been commonly expressed.(A) Consciousness is not an independent quality but arose as a naturalevolutionary consequence of the biological adaptation of brains and nervoussystems. The most popular scientific view is that consciousness emerged as aproperty of complex biological computation during the course of evolution.Opinions vary as to when, where and how consciousness appeared, e.g. onlyrecently in humans, or earlier in lower organisms. Consciousness as evolutionaryadaptation is commonly assumed to be epiphenomenal (i.e. a secondary effectwithout independent influence), though it is frequently argued to conferbeneficial advantages to conscious species (Dennett, 1991; 1995; Wegner, 2002).(B) Consciousness is a quality that has always been in the universe. Spiritualand religious approaches assume consciousness has been in the universe allalong, e.g. as the 'ground of being', 'creator' or component of an omnipresent'God'. Panpsychists attribute consciousness to all matter. Idealists contendconsciousness is all that exists, the material world an illusion (Kant, 1781).(C) Precursors of consciousness have always been in the universe; biologyevolved a mechanism to convert conscious precursors to actual consciousness.This is the view implied by Whitehead (1929; 1933) and taken in thePenrose-Hameroff theory of 'orchestrated objective reduction' ('Orch OR').Precursors of consciousness, presumably with proto-experiential qualities, areproposed to exist as the potential ingredients of actual consciousness, thephysical basis of these proto-conscious elements not necessarily being part ofour current theories of the laws of the universe (Penrose and Hameroff, 1995;Hameroff and Penrose, 1996a; 1996b).2. Ideas for how consciousness arises from brain actionHow does the brain produce consciousness? An enormous amount of detailedknowledge about brain function has accrued; however the mechanism by which thebrain produces consciousness remains mysterious (Koch, 2004). The prevalentscientific view is that consciousness somehow emerges from complex computationamong simple neurons which each receive and integrate synaptic inputs to athreshold for bit-like firing. The brain as a network of 1011'integrate-and-fire' neurons computing by bit-like firing and variablestrengthchemical synapses is the standard model for computer simulations of brainfunction, e.g. in the field of artificial intelligence ('AI').The brain-as-computer view can account for non-conscious cognitive functionsincluding much of our mental processing and control of behavior. Suchnon-conscious cognitive processes are deemed 'zombie modes', 'auto-pilot', or'easy problems'. The 'hard problem' (Chalmers, 1996) is the question of howcognitive processes are accompanied or driven by phenomenal conscious experienceand subjective feelings, referred to by philosophers as 'qualia'. Other issuesalso suggest the brain-as-computer view may be incomplete, and that otherapproaches are required. The conventional brain-as-computer view fails toaccount for:The 'hard problem' Distinctions between conscious and non-conscious processesare not addressed; consciousness is assumed to emerge at a critical level(neither specified nor testable) of computational complexity mediating otherwisenon-conscious processes.'Non-computable' thought and understanding, e.g. as shown by Gödel's theorem(Penrose, 1989; 1994).'Binding and synchrony', the problem of how disparate neuronal activities arebound into unified conscious experience, and how neuronal synchrony, e.g. gammasynchrony EEG (30 to 90 Hz), the best measurable correlate of consciousness doesnot derive from neuronal firings.Causal efficacy of consciousness and any semblance of free will. Becausemeasurable brain activity corresponding to a stimulus often occurs after we'veresponded (seemingly consciously) to that stimulus, the brain-as-computer viewdepicts consciousness as epiphenomenal illusion (Dennett, 1991; 1995; Wegner,2002).Cognitive behaviors of single cell organisms . Protozoans like Paramecium canswim, find food and mates, learn, remember and have sex, all without synapticcomputation (Sherrington, 1957).In the 1980s Penrose and Hameroff (separately) began to address these issues,each against the grain of mainstream views. 3. Microtubules as Biomolecular ComputersHameroff had been intrigued by seemingly intelligent, organized activitiesinside cells, accomplished by protein polymers called microtubules (Hameroff andWatt, 1982; Hameroff, 1987). Major components of the cell's structuralcytoskeleton, microtubules also accounted for precise separation of chromosomesin cell division, complex behavior of Paramecium, and regulation of synapseswithin brain neurons (Figure 1). The intelligent function and periodic latticestructure of microtubules suggested they might function as some type ofbiomolecular computer.Microtubules are self-assembling polymers of the peanut-shaped protein dimertubulin, each tubulin dimer (110,000 atomic mass units) being composed of analpha and beta monomer (Figure 2). Thirteen linear tubulin chains('protofilaments') align side-to-side to form hollow microtubule cylinders (25nanometers diameter) with two types of hexagonal lattices. The A-lattice hasmultiple winding patterns which intersect on protofilaments at specificintervals matching the Fibonacci series found widely in nature and possessing ahelical symmetry (Section 9), suggestively sympathetic to large-scale quantumprocesses.[images/00018.jpg]Figure 1. Schematic of portions of two neurons. A terminal axon (left) forms asynapse with a dendritic spine of a second neuron (right). Interiors of bothneurons show cytoskeletal structures including microtubules, actin andmicrotubule-associated proteins (MAPs). Dendritic microtubules are arrayed inmixed polarity local networks, interconnected by MAPs. Synaptic inputs areconveyed to dendritic microtubules by ion flux, actin filaments, secondmessengers (e.g. CaMKII, see Hameroff et al, 2010) and MAPs.Along with actin and other cytoskeletal structures, microtubules establish cellshape, direct growth and organize function of cells including brain neurons.Various types of microtubule-associated proteins ('MAPs') bind at specificlattice sites and bridge to other microtubules, defining cell architecture likegirders and beams in a building. One such MAP is tau, whose displacement frommicrotubules results in neurofibrillary tangles and the cognitive dysfunction ofAlzheimer's disease (Brunden et al, 2011). Motor proteins (dynein, kinesin) moverapidly along microtubules, transporting cargo molecules to specific locations.[images/00019.jpg]Figure 2. Left: Portion of single microtubule composed of tubulin dimer proteins(black and white) in A-lattice configuration. Right, top: According to preOrchOR microtubule automata theory (e.g. Hameroff and Watt, 1982; Rasmussen et al,1990), each tubulin in a microtubule lattice switches between alternate (blackand white) 'bit' states, coupled to electron cloud dipole London forces ininternal hydrophobic pocket. Right, bottom: According to Orch OR, each tubulincan also exist as quantum superposition (quantum bit, or 'qubit') of bothstates, coupled to superposition of London force dipoles in hydrophobic pocket.Microtubules also fuse side-by-side in doublets or triplets. Nine such doubletsor triplets then align to form barrel-shaped mega-cylinders called cilia,flagella and centrioles, organelles responsible for locomotion, sensation andcell division. Either individually or in these larger arrays, microtubules areresponsible for cellular and intra-cellular movements requiring intelligentspatiotemporal organization. Microtubules have a lattice structure comparable tocomputational systems. Could microtubules process information?The notion that microtubules process information was suggested in general termsby Sherrington (1957) and Atema (1973). With physicist colleagues through the1980s, Hameroff developed models of microtubules as information processingdevices, specifically molecular ('cellular') automata, self-organizingcomputational devices (Figure 3). Cellular automata are computational systems inwhich fundamental units, or 'cells' in a grid or lattice can each exist inspecific states, e.g. 1 or 0, at a given time (Wolfram, 2002). Each cellinteracts with its neighbor cells at discrete, synchronized time steps, thestate of each cell at any particular time step determined by its state and itsneighbor cell states at the previous time step, and rules governing theinteractions. In such ways, using simple neighbor interactions in simple latticegrids, cellular automata can perform complex computation and generate complexpatterns.Cells in cellular automata are meant to imply fundamental units. But biologicalcells are not necessarily simple, as illustrated by the clever Paramecium.Molecular automata are cellular automata in which the fundamental units, bits orcells are states of molecules, much smaller than biological cells. A dynamic,interactive molecular grid or lattice is required.Microtubules are lattices of tubulin dimers which Hameroff and colleaguesmodeled as molecular automata. Discrete states of tubulin were suggested to actas bits, switching between states, and interacting (via dipole-dipole coupling)with neighbor tubulin bit states in 'molecular automata' computation (Hameroffand Watt, 1982; Rasmussen et al., 1990; Tuszynski et al., 1995). The mechanismfor bit-like switching at the level of each tubulin was proposed to depend onthe van der Waals-London force in non-polar, water-excluding regions('hydrophobic pockets') within each tubulin.Proteins are largely heterogeneous arrays of amino acid residues, including bothwatersoluble polar and water-insoluble non-polar groups, the latter includingphenylalanine and tryptophan with electron resonance clouds (e.g. phenyl andindole rings). Such non-polar groups coalesce during protein folding to formhomogeneous water-excluding 'hydrophobic' pockets within which instantaneousdipole couplings between nearby electron clouds operate. These are London forceswhich are extremely weak but numerous and able to act collectively inhydrophobic regions to influence and determine protein state (Voet and Voet,1995).London forces in hydrophobic pockets of various neuronal proteins are themechanisms by which anesthetic gases selectively erase consciousness (Franks andLieb, 1984). Anesthetics bind by their own London force attractions withelectron clouds of the hydrophobic pocket, presumably impairingnormally-occurring London forces governing protein switching required forconsciousness (Hameroff, 2006).In Figure 2, and as previously used in Orch OR, London forces are illustrated incartoon fashion. A single hydrophobic pocket is depicted in tubulin, withportions of two electron resonance rings in the pocket. Single electrons in eachring repel each other, as their electron cloud net dipole flips (London forceoscillation). London forces in hydrophobic pockets were used as the switchingmechanism to distinguish discrete states for each tubulin in microtubuleautomata. In recent years tubulin hydrophobic regions and switching in the OrchOR proposal that we describe below have been clarified and updated (see Section8).To synchronize discrete time steps in microtubule automata, tubulins inmicrotubules were assumed to oscillate synchronously in a manner proposed byFröhlich for biological coherence. Biophysicist Herbert Fröhlich (1968; 1970;1975) had suggested that biomolecular dipoles constrained in a common geometryand voltage field would oscillate coherently, coupling, or condensing to acommon vibrational mode. He proposed that biomolecular dipole lattices couldconvert ambient energy to coherent, synchronized dipole excitations, e.g. in thegigahertz (109 s−1) frequency range. Fröhlich coherence or condensation can beeither quantum coherence (e.g. Bose-Einstein condensation) or classicalsynchrony (Reimers et al., 2009).In recent years coherent excitations have been found in living cells emanatingfrom microtubules at 8 megahertz (Pokorny et al., 2001; 2004). Bandyopadhyay(2011) has found a series of coherence resonance peaks in single microtubulesranging from 12 kilohertz to 8 megahertz.Rasmussen et al (1990) applied Fröhlich synchrony (in classical mode) as aclocking mechanism for computational time steps in simulated microtubuleautomata. Based on dipole couplings between neighboring tubulins in themicrotubule lattice geometry, they found traveling gliders, complex patterns,computation and learning. Microtubule automata within brain neurons couldpotentially provide another level of information processing in the brain.8 tubulins in each neuron switching and oscillating in the range of107Approximately 10per second (e.g. Pokorny 8 MHz) gives an information capacity at the microtubulelevel of1015 operations per second per neuron. This predicted capacity challenged andannoyed AI whose estimates for information processing at the level of neuronsand synapses were virtually the same as this single-cell value, but for theentire brain (1011 neurons, 103 synapses per neuron, 102 transmissions persynapse per second = 1016 operations per second). Total brain capacity whentaken at the microtubule level (in 1011 neurons) would potentially be 1026operations per second, pushing the goalpost for AI brain equivalence fartherinto the future, and down into the quantum regime.[images/00020.jpg]Figure 3. Microtubule automata (Rasmussen et al, 1990). Top: 4 time steps (e.g.at 8 megahertz, Pokorny et al, 2001) showing propagation of information statesand patterns ('gliders' in cellular automata parlance). Bottom: At differentdipole coupling parameter, bi-directional pattern movement and computationoccur.High capacity microtubule-based computing inside brain neurons could account fororganization of synaptic regulation, learning and memory, and perhaps act as thesubstrate for consciousness. But increased brain information capacity per sedidn't address most unanswered questions about consciousness (Section 2).Something was missing.4. Objective Reduction (OR)In 1989 Penrose published The Emperor's New Mind, which was followed in 1994 byShadows of the Mind. Critical of AI, both books argued, by appealing to Gödel'stheorem and other considerations, that certain aspects of human consciousness,such as understanding, must be beyond the scope of any computational system,i.e. 'noncomputable'. Non-computability is a perfectly well-defined mathematicalconcept, but it had not previously been considered as a serious possibility forthe result of physical actions. The non-computable ingredient required for humanconsciousness and understanding, Penrose suggested, would have to lie in an areawhere our current physical theories are fundamentally incomplete, though ofimportant relevance to the scales that are pertinent to the operation of ourbrains. The only serious possibility was the incompleteness of quantum theory“an incompleteness that both Einstein and Schrödinger had recognized, despitequantum theory having frequently been argued to represent the pinnacle of 20thcentury scientific achievement. This incompleteness is the unresolved issuereferred to as the 'measurement problem', which we consider in more detailbelow, in Section 5. One way to resolve it would be to provide an extension ofthe standard framework of quantum mechanics by introducing an objective form ofquantum state reduction” termed 'OR' (objective reduction), an idea which wealso describe more fully below, in Section 6.In Penrose (1989), the tentatively suggested OR proposal would have its onsetdetermined by a condition referred to there as 'the one-graviton' criterion.However, in Penrose (1995), a much better-founded criterion was used, nowsometimes referred to as the Diósi- Penrose proposal (henceforth 'DP'; see Diósi1987, 1989, Penrose 1993, 1996, 2000, 2009). This is an objective physicalthreshold, providing a plausible lifetime for quantumsuperposed states. Othersuch OR proposals had also been put forward, from time to time (e.g. Kibble1981, Pearle 1989, Pearle and Squires 1994, Ghirardi et al., 1986, 1990; seeGhirardi 2011, this volume) as solutions to the measurement problem, but had notoriginally been suggested as having anything to do with the consciousness issue.The Diósi-Penrose proposal is sometimes referred to as a 'quantum-gravity'scheme, but it is not part of the normal ideas used in quantum gravity, as willbe explained below (Section 6). Moreover, the proposed connection betweenconsciousness and quantum measurement is almost opposite, in the Orch OR scheme,to the kind of idea that had frequently been put forward in the early days ofquantum mechanics (see, for example, Wigner 1961) which suggests that a 'quantummeasurement' is something that occurs only as a result of the consciousintervention of an observer. This issue, also, will be discussed below (Section5).5. The Nature of Quantum Mechanics and its Fundamental ProblemThe term 'quantum' refers to a discrete element of energy in a system, such asthe energy E of a particle, or of some other subsystem, this energy beingrelated to a fundamental frequency ν of its oscillation, according to MaxPlanck's famous formula (where h is Planck's constant):E = h ν.This deep relation between discrete energy levels and frequencies of oscillationunderlies the wave/particle duality inherent in quantum phenomena. Neither theword “particle” nor the word “wave” adequately conveys the true nature of abasic quantum entity, but both provide useful partial pictures.The laws governing these submicroscopic quantum entities differ from thosegoverning our everyday classical world. For example, quantum particles can existin two or more states or locations simultaneously, where such a multiplecoexisting superposition of alternatives (each alternative being weighted by acomplex number) would be described mathematically by a quantum wavefunction. Wedon't see superpositions in the consciously perceived world; we see objects andparticles as material, classical things in specific locations and states.Another quantum property is 'non-local entanglement,' in which separatedcomponents of a system become unified, the entire collection of components beinggoverned by one common quantum wavefunction. The parts remain somehow connected,even when spatially separated by significant distances (e.g. over 10 kilometres,Tittel et al., 1998). Quantum superpositions of bit states (quantum bits, orqubits) can be interconnected with one another through entanglement in quantumcomputers. However, quantum entanglements cannot, by themselves, be used to senda message from one part of an entangled system to another; yet entanglement canbe used in conjunction with classical signaling to achieve strange effects--suchas the strange phenomenon referred to as quantum teleportation-that classicalsignalling cannot achieve by itself (e.g. Bennett and Wiesner, 1992; Bennett etal., 1993; Bouwmeester et al., 1997; Macikic et al., 2002).The issue of why we don't directly perceive quantum superpositions is amanifestation of the measurement problem referred to in Section 4. Put moreprecisely, the measurement problem is the conflict between the two fundamentalprocedures of quantum mechanics. One of these procedures, referred to as unitaryevolution, denoted here by U, is the continuous deterministic evolution of thequantum state (i.e. of the wavefunction of the entire system) according to thefundamental Schrödinger equation, The other is the procedure that is adoptedwhenever a measurement of the system-or observation-is deemed to have takenplace, where the quantum state is discontinuously and probabilistically replacedby another quantum state (referred to, technically, as an eigenstate of amathematical operator that is taken to describe the measurement). Thisdiscontinuous jumping of the state is referred to as the reduction of the state(or the 'collapse of the wavefunction'), and will be denoted here by the letterR. The conflict that is termed the measurement problem (or perhaps moreaccurately as the measurement paradox) arises when we consider the measuringapparatus itself as a quantum entity, which is part of the entire quantum systemconsisting of the original system under observation together with this measuringapparatus. The apparatus is, after all, constructed out of the same type ofquantum ingredients (electrons, photons, protons, neutrons etc.-or quarks andgluons etc.) as is the system under observation, so it ought to be subject alsoto the same quantum laws, these being described in terms of the continuous anddeterministic U. How, then, can the discontinuous and probabilistic R come aboutas a result of the interaction (measurement) between two parts of the quantumsystem? This is the measurement problem (or paradox).There are many ways that quantum physicists have attempted to come to terms withthis conflict (see, for example, Bell 1966, Bohm 1951, Rae 1994, Polkinghorne2002, Penrose, 2004). In the early 20th century, the Danish physicist NielsBohr, together with Werner Heisenberg, proposed the pragmatic 'Copenhageninterpretation', according to which the wavefunction of a quantum system,evolving according to U, is not assigned any actual physical 'reality', but istaken as basically providing the needed 'book-keeping' so that eventuallyprobability values can be assigned to the various possible outcomes of a quantummeasurement. The measuring device itself is explicitly taken to behaveclassically and no account is taken of the fact that the device is ultimatelybuilt from quantum-level constituents. The probabilities are calculated, oncethe nature of the measuring device is known, from the state that thewavefunction has U-evolved to at the time of the measurement. The discontinuous“jump” that the wavefunction makes upon measurement, according to R, isattributed to the change in 'knowledge' that the result of the measurement hason the observer. Since the wavefunction is not assigned physical reality, but isconsidered to refer merely to the observer's knowledge of the quantum system,the jumping is considered simply to reflect the jump in the observer's knowledgestate, rather than in the quantum system under consideration.Many physicists remain unhappy with such a point of view, however, and regard itlargely as a 'stop-gap', in order that progress can be made in applying thequantum formalism, without this progress being held up by a lack of a seriousquantum ontology, which might provide a more complete picture of what isactually going on. One may ask, in particular, what it is about a measuringdevice that allows one to ignore the fact that it is itself made from quantumconstituents and is permitted to be treated entirely classically. A good manyproponents of the Copenhagen standpoint would take the view that while thephysical measuring apparatus ought actually to be treated as a quantum system,and therefore part of an over-riding wavefunction evolving according to U , itwould be the conscious observer, examining the readings on that device, whoactually reduces the state, according to R , thereby assigning a physicalreality to the particular observed alternative resulting from the measurement.Accordingly, before the intervention of the observer's consciousness, thevarious alternatives of the result of the measurement including the differentstates of the measuring apparatus would, in effect, still coexist insuperposition, in accordance with what would be the usual evolution according toU . In this way, the Copenhagen viewpoint puts consciousness outside science,and does not seriously address the nature and physical role of superpositionitself nor the question of how large quantum superpositions like Schrödinger 'ssuperposed live and dead cat (see below) might actually become one thing oranother.A more extreme variant of this approach is the 'multiple worlds hypothesis' ofEverett (1957) in which each possibility in a superposition evolves to form itsown universe, resulting in an infinite multitude of coexisting 'parallel'worlds. The stream of consciousness of the observer is supposed somehow to'split', so that there is one in each of the worlds-at least in those worlds forwhich the observer remains alive and conscious. Each instance of the observer'sconsciousness experiences a separate independent world, and is not directlyaware of any of the other worlds.A more 'down-to-earth' viewpoint is that of environmental decoherence, in whichinteraction of a superposition with its environment 'erodes' quantum states, sothat instead of a single wavefunction being used to describe the state, a morecomplicated entity is used, referred to as a density matrix. However decoherencedoes not provide a consistent ontology for the reality of the world, in relationto the density matrix (see, for example, Penrose 2004, Sections 29.3-6), andprovides merely a pragmatic procedure. Moreover, it does not address the issueof how R might arise in isolated systems, nor the nature of isolation, in whichan external 'environment' would not be involved, nor does it tell us which partof a system is to be regarded as the 'environment' part, and it provides nolimit to the size of that part which can remain subject to quantumsuperposition.Still other approaches include various types of objective reduction ( OR) inwhich a specific objective threshold is proposed to cause quantum statereduction (e.g. Kibble 1981; Pearle 1989; Ghirardi et al., 1986; Percival, 1994;Ghirardi, 2011). The specific OR scheme that is used in Orch OR will bedescribed in Section 6.The quantum pioneer Erwin Schrödinger took pains to point out the difficultiesthat confront the U-evolution of a quantum system with his still-famous thoughtexperiment called 'Schrödinger 's cat'. Here, the fate of a cat in a box isdetermined by magnifying a quantum event (say the decay of a radioactive atom,within a specific time period that would provide a 50% probability of decay) toa macroscopic action which would kill the cat, so that according to Schrödinger's own U-evolution the cat would be in a quantum superposition of being bothdead and alive at the same time. If this U-evolution is maintained until the boxis opened and the cat observed, then it would have to be the conscious humanobserving the cat that results in the cat becoming either dead or alive (unless,of course, the cat's own consciousness could be considered to have alreadyserved this purpose). Schrödinger intended to illustrate the absurdity of thedirect applicability of the rules of quantum mechanics (including his ownU-evolution) when applied at the level of a cat. Like Einstein, he regardedquantum mechanics as an incomplete theory, and his 'cat' provided an excellentexample for emphasizing this incompleteness. There is a need for something to bedone about quantum mechanics, irrespective of the issue of its relevance toconsciousness.6. The Orch OR SchemeOrch OR depends, indeed, upon a particular OR extension of current quantummechanics, taking the bridge between quantum- and classical-level physics as a'quantumgravitational' phenomenon. This is in contrast with the variousconventional viewpoints (see Section 5), whereby this bridge is claimed toresult, somehow, from 'environmental decoherence', or from 'observation by aconscious observer', or from a 'choice between alternative worlds', or someother interpretation of how the classical world of one actual alternative may betaken to arise out of fundamentally quantum-superposed ingredients.It must also be made clear that the Orch OR scheme involves a differentinterpretation of the term 'quantum gravity' from what is usual. Current ideasof quantum gravity (see, for example Smolin, 2002) normally refer, instead, tosome sort of physical scheme that is to be formulated within the bounds ofstandard quantum field theory-although no particular such theory, among themultitude that has so far been put forward, has gained anything approachinguniversal acceptance, nor has any of them found a fully consistent, satisfactoryformulation. 'OR' here refers to the alternative viewpoint that standard quantum(field) theory is not the final answer, and that the reduction R of the quantumstate ('collapse of the wavefunction') that is adopted in standard quantummechanics is an actual physical phenomenon which is not part of the conventionalunitary formalism U of quantum theory (or quantum field theory) and does notarise as some kind of convenience or effective consequence of environmentaldecoherence, etc., as the conventional U formalism would seem to demand.Instead, OR is taken to be one of the consequences of melding together theprinciples of Einstein's general relativity with those of the conventionalunitary quantum formalism U, and this demands a departure from the strict rulesof U. According to this OR viewpoint, any quantum measurement-whereby thequantum-superposed alternatives produced in accordance with the U formalismbecomes reduced to a single actual occurrence-is real objective physicalphenomenon, and it is taken to result from the mass displacement between thealternatives being sufficient, in gravitational terms, for the superposition tobecome unstable.In the DP (Diósi -Penrose) scheme for OR, the superposition reduces to one ofthe alternatives in a time scale τ that can be estimated (for a superposition oftwo states each of which can be taken to be stationary on its own) according tothe formulaτ ≈ /EG.Here (=h/2π) is Dirac's form of Planck's constant h and EG is the gravitationalselfenergy of the difference between the two mass distributions of thesuperposition. (For a superposition for which each mass distribution is a rigidtranslation of the other, EG is theenergy it would cost to displace one component of the superposition in thegravitational field of the other, in moving it from coincidence to thequantum-displaced location; see Diósi 1989, Penrose 1993, 2000, 2009).According to Orch OR, the (objective) reduction is not the entirely randomprocess of standard theory, but acts according to some non-computational newphysics (see Penrose 1989, 1994). The idea is that consciousness is associatedwith this (gravitational) OR process, but occurs significantly only when thealternatives are part of some highly organized structure, so that suchoccurrences of OR occur in an extremely orchestrated form. Only then does arecognizably conscious event take place. On the other hand, we may consider thatany individual occurrence of OR would be an element of proto- consciousness.The OR process is considered to occur when quantum superpositions betweenslightly differing space-times take place, differing from one another by anintegrated space-time measure which compares with the fundamental and extremelytiny Planck (4-volume) scale of space-time geometry. Since this is a 4-volumePlanck measure, involving both time and space, we find that the time measurewould be particularly tiny when the spacedifference measure is relatively large(as with Schrödinger 's cat), but for extremely tiny space-difference measures,the time measure might be fairly long, such as some significant fraction of asecond. We shall be seeing this in more detail shortly, together with itsparticular relevance to microtubules. In any case, we recognize that theelements of protoconsciousness would be intimately tied in with the mostprimitive Planck-level ingredients of space-time geometry, these presumed'ingredients' being taken to be at the absurdly tiny level of 10−35m and 10−43s,a distance and a time some 20 orders of magnitude smaller than those of normalparticle-physics scales and their most rapid processes. These scales refer onlyto the normally extremely tiny differences in space-time geometry betweendifferent states in superposition, and OR is deemed to take place when suchspace-time differences reach the Planck level. Owing to the extreme weakness ofgravitational forces as compared with those of the chemical and electric forcesof biology, the energy EG isliable to be far smaller than any energy that arises directly from biologicalprocesses. However, EG is not to be thought of as being in direct competition with any ofthe usualbiological energies, as it plays a completely different role, supplying a neededenergy uncertainty that then allows a choice to be made between the separatedspace-time geometries. It is the key ingredient of the computation of thereduction time τ. Nevertheless, the extreme weakness of gravity tells us theremust be a considerable amount of material involved in the coherent massdisplacement between superposed structures in order that τ can be small enoughto be playing its necessary role in the relevant OR processes in the brain.These superposed structures should also process information and regulateneuronal physiology. According to Orch OR, microtubules are central to thesestructures, and some form of biological quantum computation in microtubules(most probably primarily in the more symmetrical A-lattice microtubules) wouldhave to have evolved to provide a subtle yet direct connection to Planck-scalegeometry, leading eventually to discrete moments of actual conscious experience.The degree of separation between the space-time sheets is mathematicallydescribed in terms of a symplectic measure on the space of 4-dimensional metrics(cf. Penrose, 1993). The separation is, as already noted above, a space-timeseparation, not just a spatial one. Thus the time of separation contributes aswell as the spatial displacement. Roughly speaking, it is the product of thetemporal separation T with the spatial separation S that measures the overalldegree of separation, and OR takes place when this overall separation reaches acritical amount. This critical amount would be of the order of unity, inabsolute units, for which the Planck-Dirac constant , the gravitational constantG, and the velocityof light c, all take the value unity, cf. Penrose, 1994 - pp. 337-339. For smallS, the lifetime τ ≈T of the superposed state will be large; on the other hand,if S is large, then τ will be small.[images/00021.jpg]Figure 4. From Penrose, 1994 (P. 338). With four spatiotemporal dimensionscondensed to a 2-dimensional spacetime sheet, mass location may be representedas a particular curvature of that sheet, according to general relativity. Top:Two different mass locations as alternative spacetime curvatures. Bottom: abifurcating spacetime is depicted as the union (\"glued together version\") of thetwo alternative spacetime histories that are depicted at the top of the Figure.Hence a quantum superposition of simultaneous alternative locations may be seenas a separation in fundamental spacetime geometry.To estimate S, we compute (in the Newtonian limit of weak gravitational fields)the gravitational self-energy EG of the difference between the massdistributions of the two superposed states. (That is, one mass distributioncounts positively and the other, negatively; see Penrose, 1993; 1995.) Thequantity S is then given by: S ≈ EG and T≈ τ, whence τ ≈ /EG , i.e. EG ≈ /τ. Thus, the DP expectation is that OR occurs with the resolving out of oneparticular spacetime geometry from the previous superposition when, on theaverage, τ≈ /EG. Moreover,according to Orch OR, this is accompanied by an element of proto-consciousness.Environmental decoherence need play no role in state reduction, according tothis scheme. The proposal is that state reduction simply takes placespontaneously, according to this criterion. On the other hand, in many actualphysical situations, there would be much material from the environment thatwould be entangled with the quantum-superposed state, and it could well be thatthe major mass displacement-and therefore the major contribution to EG -wouldoccur in the environment rather than in the system underconsideration. Since the environment will be quantum-entangled with the system,the state-reduction in the environment will effect a simultaneous reduction inthe system. This could shorten the time for the state reduction R to take placevery considerably. It would also introduce an uncontrollable random element intothe result of the reduction, so that any non-random (albeit non-computable,according to Orch OR) element influencing the particular choice of state that isactually resolved out from the superposition would be completely masked by thisrandomness. In these circumstances the ORprocess would be indistinguishable fromthe Rprocess of conventional quantum mechanics. If the suggested non-computableeffects of this OR proposal are to be laid bare, if EG is to be able toevolve and be orchestrated for conscious moments, we indeed need significantisolation from the environment.As yet, no experiment has been refined enough to determine whether this (DP) ORproposal is actually respected by Nature, but the experimental testing of thescheme is fairly close to the borderline of what can be achieved withpresent-day technology (see, for example, Marshall et al. 2003). One ought tobegin to see the effects of this OR scheme if a small object, such as a10-micron cube of crystalline material could be held in a superposition of twolocations, differing by about the diameter of an atomic nucleus, for someseconds, or perhaps minutes.A point of importance, in such proposed experiments, is that in order tocalculate EG itmay not be enough to base the calculation on an average density of the materialin the superposition, since the mass will be concentrated in the atomic nuclei,and for a displacement of the order of the diameter of a nucleus, thisinhomogeneity in the density of the material can be crucial, and can provide amuch larger value for EG than would beobtained if the material is assumed to be homogeneous. The Schrödinger equation(more correctly, in the zero-temperature approximation, the Schrödinger--Newtonequation, see Penrose 2000; Moroz et al. 1998) for the static unsuperposedmaterial would have to be solved, at least approximately, in order to derive theexpectation value of the mass distribution, where there would be some quantumspread in the locations of the particles constituting the nuclei.[images/00022.jpg]Figure 5.

C.Space-time sheet with superposition separation reaches threshold and selects onereality/spacetime curvature.For Orch OR to be operative in the brain, we would need coherent superpositionsof sufficient amounts of material, undisturbed by environmental entanglement,where this reduces in accordance with the above OR scheme in a rough time scaleof the general order of time for a conscious experience to take place. For anordinary type of experience, this might be say about τ =10−1s which concurs withneural correlates of consciousness, such as particular frequencies ofelectroencephalograhy (EEG).Penrose (1989; 1994) suggested that processes of the general nature of quantumcomputations were occurring in the brain, terminated by OR. In quantum computers(Benioff 1982, Deutsch 1985, Feynman 1986), information is represented not justas bits of either 1 or 0, but also as quantum superposition of both 1 and 0together (quantum bits or qubits) where, moreover, large-scale entanglementsbetween qubits would also be involved. These qubits interact and computefollowing the Schrödinger equation, potentially enabling complex and highlyefficient parallel processing. As envisioned in technological quantum computers,at some point a measurement is made causing quantum state reduction (with somerandomness introduced). The qubits reduce, or collapse to classical bits anddefinite states as the output.The proposal that some form of quantum computing could be acting in the brain,this proceeding by the Schrödinger equation without decoherence until somethreshold for self-collapse due to a form of non-computable OR could be reached,was made in Penrose 1989. However, no plausible biological candidate for quantumcomputing in the brain had been available to him, as he was then unfamiliar withmicrotubules.7. Penrose-Hameroff Orchestrated Objective Reduction ('Orch OR')Penrose and Hameroff teamed up in the early 1990s. Fortunately, by then, the DPform of OR mechanism was at hand to be applied to the microtubule-automatamodels for consciousness as developed by Hameroff. A number of questions wereaddressed.How does τ≈ /EG relate to consciousness? Orch OR considers consciousness as asequence of discrete OR events in concert with neuronal-level activities. In τ≈/EG , τ istaken to be the time for evolution of the pre-conscious quantum wavefunctionbetween OR events, i.e. the time interval between conscious moments, duringwhich quantum superpositions of microtubule states evolve according to thecontinuous Schrödinger equation before reaching (on the average) the τ≈ /EG ORthreshold in time τ, whenquantum state reduction and a moment of conscious awareness occurs (Figure 5).The best known temporal correlate for consciousness is gamma synchrony EEG, 30to 90 Hz, often referred to as coherent 40 Hz. One possible viewpoint might beto take this oscillation to represent a succession of 40 or so conscious momentsper second (τ=25 milliseconds). This would be reasonably consistent withneuroscience (gamma synchrony), with certain ideas expressed in philosophy (e.g.Whitehead 'occasions of experience'), and perhaps even with ancient Buddhisttexts which portray consciousness as 'momentary collections of mental phenomena'or as 'distinct, unconnected and impermanent moments which perish as soon asthey arise.' (Some Buddhist writings quantify the frequency of consciousmoments. For example the Sarvaastivaadins, according to von Rospatt 1995,described 6,480,000 'moments' in 24 hours-an average of one 'moment' per 13.3msec, ~75 Hz-and some Chinese Buddhism as one \"thought\" per 20 msec, i.e. 50Hz.) These accounts, even including variations in frequency, could be consideredto be consistent with Orch OR events in the gamma synchrony range. Accordingly,on this view, gamma synchrony, Buddhist 'moments of experience', Whitehead'occasions of experience', and our proposed Orch OR events might be viewed ascorresponding tolerably well with one another.Putting τ=25msec in EG ≈ /τ, we may ask what is EG in terms of superpositionedmicrotubule tubulins? EG may be derived from details about the superpositionseparationof mass distribution. Three types of mass separation were considered in Hameroff-Penrose 1996a for peanut-shaped tubulin proteins of 110,000 atomic mass units:separation at the level of (1) protein spheres, e.g. by 10 percent volume, (2)atomic nuclei (e.g. carbon, ~ 2.5 Fermi length), (3) nucleons (protons andneutrons). The most plausible calculated effect might be separation at the levelof atomic nuclei, giving EG as superposition of 2 x1010 tubulins reaching OR threshold at 25 milliseconds.Brain neurons each contain roughly 108 tubulins, so only a few hundred neuronswould be required for a 25msec, gamma synchrony OR event if 100 percent oftubulins in those neurons were in superposition and avoided decoherence. Itseems more likely that a fraction of tubulins per neuron are in superposition.Global macroscopic states such as superconductivity ensue from quantum coherenceamong only very small fractions of components. If 1 percent of tubulins within agiven set of neurons were coherent for 25msec, then 20,000 such neurons would berequired to elicit OR. In human brain, cognition and consciousness are, at anyone time, thought to involve tens of thousands of neurons. Hebb's (1949) 'cellassemblies', Eccles's (1992) 'modules', and Crick and Koch's (1990) 'coherentsets of neurons' are each estimated to contain some 10,000 to 100,000 neuronswhich may be widely distributed throughout the brain (Scott, 1995).Adopting τ≈ /EG , we find that, with this point of view with regard to Orch-OR,aspectrum of possible types of conscious event might be able to occur, includingthose at higher frequency and intensity. It may be noted that Tibetan monkmeditators have been found to have 80 Hz gamma synchrony, and perhaps moreintense experience (Lutz et al. 2004). Thus, according to the viewpoint proposedabove, where we interpret this frequency to be associated with a succession ofOrch-OR moments, then EG ≈ /τ would appear torequire that there is twice as much brain involvement required for 80 Hz thanfor consciousness occurring at 40 Hz (or √2 times as much if the displacement isentirely coherent, since then the mass enters quadratically in EG ). Even higher(frequency), expanded awareness states of consciousness might be expected, withmore neuronal brain involvement.On the other hand, we might take an alternative viewpoint with regard to theprobable frequency of Orch-OR actions, and to the resulting frequency ofelements of conscious experience. There is the possibility that the discernablemoments of consciousness are events that normally occur at a much slower pacethan is suggested by the considerations above, and that they happen only atrough intervals of the order of, say, one half a second or so, i.e. ~500msec,rather than ~25msec. One might indeed think of conscious influences as perhapsbeing rather slow, in contrast with the great deal of vastly faster unconsciouscomputing that might be some form of quantum computing, but without OR. At thepresent stage of uncertainty about such matters it is perhaps best not to bedogmatic about how the ideas of Orch OR are to be applied. In any case, thenumerical assignments provided above must be considered to be extremely rough,and at the moment we are far from being in a position to be definitive about theprecise way in which the Orch-OR is to operate. Alternative possibilities willneed to be considered with an open mind.How do microtubule quantum computation avoid decoherence? Technological quantumcomputers using e.g. ion traps as qubits are plagued by decoherence, disruptionof delicate quantum states by thermal vibration, and require extremely coldtemperatures and vacuum to operate. Decoherence must be avoided during theevolution toward time τ (≈ /EG ), sothat the non-random (non-computable) aspects of OR can be playing their roles.How does quantum computing avoid decoherence in the 'warm, wet and noisy' brain?It was suggested (Hameroff and Penrose, 1996a) that microtubule quantum statesavoid decoherence by being pumped, laser-like, by Fröhlich resonance, andshielded by ordered water, C-termini Debye layers, actin gel and strongmitochondrial electric fields. Moreover quantum states in Orch OR are proposedto originate in hydrophobic pockets in tubulin interiors, isolated from polarinteractions, and involve superposition of only atomic nuclei separation.Moreover, geometrical resonances in microtubules, e.g. following helicalpathways of Fibonacci geometry are suggested to enable topological quantumcomputing and error correction, avoiding decoherence perhaps effectivelyindefinitely (Hameroff et al 2002) as in a superconductor.The analogy with high-temperature superconductors may indeed be appropriate, infact. As yet, there is no fully accepted theory of how such superconductorsoperate, avoiding loss of quantum coherence from the usual processes ofenvironmental decoherence. Yet there are materials which supportsuperconductivity at temperatures roughly halfway between room temperature andabsolute zero (He et al., 2010). This is still a long way from body temperature,of course, but there is now some experimental evidence (Bandyopadhyay 2011) thatis indicative of something resembling superconductivity (referred to as'ballistic conductance'), that occurs in living A-lattice microtubules at bodytemperature. This will be discussed below.Physicist Max Tegmark (2000) published a critique of Orch OR based on hiscalculated decoherence times for microtubules of 10-13 seconds at biologicaltemperature, far too brief for physiological effects. However Tegmark didn'tinclude Orch OR stipulations and in essence created, and then refuted his ownquantum microtubule model. He assumed superpositions of solitons separated fromthemselves by a distance of 24 nanometers along the length of the microtubule.As previously described, superposition separation in Orch OR is at the Fermilength level of atomic nuclei, i.e. 7 orders of magnitude smaller than Tegmark'sseparation value, thus underestimating decoherence time by 7 orders ofmagnitude, i.e. from 10-13 secs to microseconds at 10-6 seconds. Hagan et al(2001) used Tegmark's same formula and recalculated microtubule decoherencetimes using Orch OR stipulations, finding 10-4 to 10-3 seconds, or longer due totopological quantum effects. It seemed likely biology had evolved optimalinformation processing systems which can utilize quantum computing, but therewas no real evidence either way.Beginning in 2003, published research began to demonstrate quantum coherence inwarm biological systems. Ouyang and Awschalom (2003) showed that quantum spintransfer through phenyl rings (the same as those in protein hydrophobic pockets)is enhanced at increasingly warm temperatures. Other studies showed that quantumcoherence occurred at ambient temperatures in proteins involved inphotosynthesis, that plants routinely use quantum coherence to produce chemicalenergy and food (Engel et al, 2007). Further research has demonstrated warmquantum effects in bird brain navigation (Gauger et al, 2011), ion channels(Bernroider and Roy, 2005), sense of smell (Turin, 1996), DNA (Rieper et al.,2011), protein folding (Luo and Lu, 2011), biological water (Reiter et al.,2011) and microtubules.Recently Anirban Bandyopadhyay and colleagues at the National Institute ofMaterial Sciences in Tsukuba, Japan have used nanotechnology to study electronicconductance properties of single microtubules assembled from porcine braintubulin. Their preliminary findings (Bandyopadhyay, 2011) include: (1)Microtubules have 8 resonance peaks for AC stimulation (kilohertz to 10megahertz) which appear to correlate with various helical conductance pathwaysaround the geometric microtubule lattice. (2) Excitation at these resonantfrequencies causes microtubules to assemble extremely rapidly, possibly due toFröhlich condensation. (3) In assembled microtubules AC excitation at resonantfrequencies causes electronic conductance to become lossless, or 'ballistic',essentially quantum conductance, presumably along these helical quantumchannels. Resonance in the range of kilohertz demonstrates microtubuledecoherence times of at least 0.1 millisecond. (4) Eight distinct quantuminterference patterns from a single microtubule, each correlating with one ofthe 8 resonance frequencies and pathways. (5) Ferroelectric hysteresisdemonstrates memory capacity in microtubules. (6) Temperature-independentconductance also suggests quantum effects. If confirmed, such findings woulddemonstrate Orch OR to be biologically feasible.How does microtubule quantum computation and Orch OR fit with recognizedneurophysiology? Neurons are composed of multiple dendrites and a cell body/somawhich receive and integrate synaptic inputs to a threshold for firing outputsalong a single axon. Microtubule quantum computation in Orch OR is assumed tooccur in dendrites and cell bodies/soma of brain neurons, i.e. in regions ofintegration of inputs in integrate-and-fire neurons. As opposed to axonalfirings, dendritic/somatic integration correlates best with local fieldpotentials, gamma synchrony EEG, and action of anesthetics erasingconsciousness. Tononi (2004) has identified integration of information as theneuronal function most closely associated with consciousness. Dendriticmicrotubules are uniquely arranged in local mixed polarity networks, well-suitedfor integration of synaptic inputs.Membrane synaptic inputs interact with post-synaptic microtubules by activationof microtubule-associated protein 2 ('MAP2', associated with learning), andcalciumcalmodulin kinase II (CaMKII, Hameroff et al, 2010). Such inputs weresuggested by Penrose and Hameroff (1996a) to 'tune', or 'orchestrate'OR-mediated quantum computations in microtubules by MAPs, hence 'orchestratedobjective reduction', 'Orch OR'.Proposed mechanisms for microtubule avoidance of decoherence were describedabove, but another question remains. How would microtubule quantum computationswhich are isolated from the environment, still interact with that environmentfor input and output? One possibility that Orch OR suggests is that perhapsphases of isolated quantum computing alternate with phases of classicalenvironmental interaction, e.g. at gamma synchrony, roughly 40 times per second.(Computing pioneer Paul Benioff suggested such a scheme of alternating quantumand classical phases in a science fiction story about quantum computing robots.)With regard to outputs resulting from processes taking place at the level ofmicrotubules in Orch-OR quantum computations, dendritic/somatic microtubulesreceive and integrate synaptic inputs during classical phase. They then becomeisolated quantum computers and evolve to threshold for Orch OR at which theyreduce their quantum states at an average time interval τ (given by by τ≈ /EG).The particular tubulin states chosen in the reductioncan then trigger axonal firing, adjust firing threshold, regulate synapses andencode memory. Thus Orch OR can have causal efficacy in conscious actions andbehavior, as well as providing conscious experience and memory.Orch OR in evolution In the absence of Orch OR, non-conscious neuronalactivities might proceed by classical neuronal and microtubule-basedcomputation. In addition there could be quantum computations in microtubulesthat do not reach the Orch OR level, and thereby also remain unconscious.This last possibility is strongly suggested by considerations of naturalselection, since some relatively primitive microtubule infrastructure, stillable to support quantum computation, would have to have preceded the moresophisticated kind that we now find in conscious animals. Natural selectionproceeds in steps, after all, and one would not expect that the capability ofthe substantial level of coherence across the brain that would be needed for thenon-computable OR of human conscious understanding to be reached, withoutsomething more primitive having preceded it. Microtubule quantum computing by Uevolution which avoids decoherence would well be advantageous to biologicalprocesses without ever reaching threshold for OR.Microtubules may have appeared in eukaryotic cells 1.3 billion years ago due tosymbiosis among prokaryotes, mitochondria and spirochetes, the latter theapparent origin of microtubules which provided movement to previously immobilecells (e.g. Margulis and Sagan, 1995). Because Orch OR depends on τ≈ /EG, moreprimitive consciousness insimple, small organisms would involve smaller EG, and longer times τ to avoiddecoherence. As simple nervous systems and arrangements of microtubules grewlarger and developed anti-decoherence mechanisms, inevitably a system wouldavoid decoherence long enough to reach threshold for Orch OR conscious moments.Central nervous systems around 300 neurons, such as those present at the earlyCambrian evolutionary explosion 540 million years ago, could have τ near oneminute, and thus be feasible in terms of avoiding decoherence (Hameroff, 1998d).Perhaps the onset of Orch OR and consciousness with relatively slow and simpleconscious moments, precipitated the accelerated evolution.Only at a much later evolutionary stage would the selective advantages of acapability for genuine understanding come about. This would require thenon-computable capabilities of Orch OR that go beyond those of mere quantumcomputation, and depend upon larger scale infrastructure of efficientlyfunctioning microtubules, capable of operating quantumcomputational processes.Further evolution providing larger sets of microtubules (larger EG) able to beisolated from decoherence would enable, by τ≈ /EG, more frequent andmore intense moments of conscious experience. It appears human brains could haveevolved to having Orch OR conscious moments perhaps as frequently as every fewmilliseconds.How could microtubule quantum states in one neuron extend to those in otherneurons throughout the brain? Assuming microtubule quantum state phases areisolated in a specific neuron, how could that quantum state involve microtubulesin other neurons throughout the brain without traversing membranes and synapses?Orch OR proposes that quantum states can extend by tunneling, leading toentanglement between adjacent neurons through gap junctions.[images/00023.jpg]Figure 6. Portions of two neurons connected by a gap junction with microtubules(linked by microtubule-associated proteins, 'MAPs') computing via states (hererepresented as black or white) of tubulin protein subunits. Wavy lines suggestentanglement among quantum states (not shown) in microtubules.Gap junctions are primitive electrical connections between cells, synchronizingelectrical activities. Structurally, gap junctions are windows between cellswhich may be open or closed. When open, gap junctions synchronize adjacent cellmembrane polarization states, but also allow passage of molecules betweencytoplasmic compartments of the two cells. So both membranes and cytoplasmicinteriors of gap-junction-connected neurons are continuous, essentially onecomplex 'hyper-neuron' or syncytium. (Ironically, before Ramon-y-Cajal showedthat neurons were discrete cells, the prevalent model for brain structure was acontinuous threaded-together syncytium as proposed by Camille Golgi.) Orch ORsuggests that quantum states in microtubules in one neuron could extend byentanglement and tunneling through gap junctions to microtubules in adjacentneurons and glia (Figure 6), and from those cells to others, potentially inbrain-wide syncytia.Open gap junctions were thus predicted to play an essential role in the neuralcorrelate of consciousness (Hameroff, 1998a). Beginning in 1998, evidence beganto show that gamma synchrony, the best measureable correlate of consciousness,depended on gap junctions, particularly dendritic-dendritic gap junctions(Dermietzel, 1998; Draguhn et al, 1998; Galaretta and Hestrin, 1999). To accountfor the distinction between conscious activities and non-conscious 'auto-pilot'activities, and the fact that consciousness can occur in various brain regions,Hameroff (2009) developed the “Conscious pilot” model in which syncytial zonesof dendritic gamma synchrony move around the brain, regulated by gap junctionopenings and closings, in turn regulated by microtubules. The model suggestsconsciousness literally moves around the brain in a mobile synchronized zone,within which isolated, entangled microtubules carry out quantum computations andOrch OR. Taken together, Orch OR and the conscious pilot distinguish consciousfrom nonconscious functional processes in the brain.Libet's backward time referral In the 1970s neurophysiologist Benjamin Libetperformed experiments on patients having brain surgery while awake, i.e. underlocal anesthesia (Libet et al., 1979). Able to stimulate and record fromconscious human brain, and gather patients' subjective reports with precisetiming, Libet determined that conscious perception of a stimulus required up to500 msec of brain activity post-stimulus, but that conscious awareness occurredat 30 msec post-stimulus, i.e. that subjective experience was referred 'backwardin time'.Bearing such apparent anomalies in mind, Penrose put forward a tentativesuggestion, in The Emperor's New Mind, that effects like Libet's backward timereferral might be related to the fact that quantum entanglements are notmediated in a normal causal way, so that it might be possible for consciousexperience not to follow the normal rules of sequential time progression, solong as this does not lead to contradictions with external causality. In Section5, it was pointed out that the (experimentally confirmed) phenomenon of 'quantumteleportation' (Bennett et al., 1993; Bouwmeester et al., 1997; Macikic et al.,2002) cannot be explained in terms of ordinary classical information processing,but as a combination of such classical causal influences and the acausal effectsof quantum entanglement. It indeed turns out that quantum entanglementeffects-referred to as 'quantum information' or 'quanglement' (Penrose 2002,2004)-appear to have to be thought of as being able to propagate in eitherdirection in time (into the past or into the future). Such effects, however,cannot by themselves be used to communicate ordinary information into the past.Nevertheless, in conjunction with normal classical future-propagating (i.e.'causal') signalling, these quantum-teleportation influences can achieve certainkinds of 'signalling' that cannot be achieved simply by classicalfuture-directed means.The issue is a subtle one, but if conscious experience is indeed rooted in theOR process, where we take OR to relate the classical to the quantum world, thenapparent anomalies in the sequential aspects of consciousness are perhaps to beexpected. The Orch OR scheme allows conscious experience to be temporallynon-local to a degree, where this temporal non-locality would spread to the kindof time scale τ that would be involved in the relevant Orch OR process, whichmight indeed allow this temporal non-locality to spread to a time τ=500ms. Whenthe 'moment' of an internal conscious experience is timed externally, it maywell be found that this external timing does not precisely accord with a timeprogression that would seem to apply to internal conscious experience, owing tothis temporal non-locality intrinsic to Orch OR.Measurable brain activity correlated with a stimulus often occurs severalhundred msec after that stimulus, as Libet showed. Yet in activities rangingfrom rapid conversation to competitive athletics, we respond to a stimulus(seemingly consciously) before the above activity that would be correlated withthat stimulus occurring in the brain. This is interpreted in conventionalneuroscience and philosophy (e.g. Dennett, 1991; Wegner, 2002) to imply that insuch cases we respond non-consciously, on auto-pilot, and subsequently have onlyan illusion of conscious response. The mainstream view is that consciousness isepiphenomenal illusion, occurring after-the-fact as a false impression ofconscious control of behavior. We are merely 'helpless spectators' (Huxley,1986).However, the effective quantum backward time referral inherent in the temporalnonlocality resulting from the quanglement aspects of Orch OR, as suggestedabove, enables conscious experience actually to be temporally non-local, thusproviding a means to rescue consciousness from its unfortunate characterizationas epiphenomenal illusion. Accordingy, Orch OR could well enable consciousnessto have a causal efficacy, despite its apparently anomalous relation to a timingassigned to it in relation to an external clock, thereby allowing consciousaction to provide a semblance of free will.8. Orch OR Criticisms and ResponsesOrch OR has been criticized repeatedly since its inception. Here we review andsummarize major criticisms and responses.Grush and Churchland, 1995 . Philosophers Grush and Churchland (1995) took issuewith the Gödel's theorem argument, as well as several biological factors. Oneobjection involved the microtubule-disabling drug colchicine which treatsdiseases such as gout by immobilizing neutrophil cells which cause painfulinflammation in joints. Neutrophil mobility requires cycles of microtubuleassembly/disassembly, and colchicine prevents reassembly, impairing neutrophilmobility and reducing inflammation. Grush and Churchland pointed out thatpatients given colchicine do not lose consciousness, concluding thatmicrotubules cannot be essential for consciousness. Penrose and Hameroff (1995)responded point-by-point to every objection, e.g. explaining that colchicinedoes not cross the blood brain barrier, and so doesn't reach the brain.Colchicine infused directly into the brains of animals does cause severecognitive impairment and apparent loss of consciousness (Bensimon and Chemat,1991).Tuszynski et al, 1998 . Tuszynski et al (1998) questioned how extremely weakgravitational energy in Diósi-Penrose OR could influence tubulin protein states.In Hameroff and Penrose (1996a), the gravitational self-energy EG for tubulinsuperposition was calculatedfor separation of tubulin from itself at the level of its atomic nuclei. Becausethe atomic (e.g. carbon) nucleus displacement is greater than its radius (thenuclei separate completely), the gravitational self-energy EG is given by:EG=Gm2/ac, where ac is thecarbon nucleus sphere radius equal to 2.5 Fermi distances, m is the mass oftubulin, and G is the gravitational constant. Brown and Tuszynski calculated EG(using separation at thenanometer level of the entire tubulin protein), finding an appropriately smallenergy E of10-27 electron volts (eV) per tubulin, infinitesimal compared with ambientenergy kT of10-4eV. Correcting for the smaller superposition separation distance of 2.5Fermi lengths in Orch OR gives a significantly larger, but still tiny 10-21eVper tubulin. With 2-1010 tubulins per 25msec, the conscious Orch OR moment wouldbe roughly 10-10eV (10-29 joules), still insignificant compared to kT at 10-4eV.All this serves to illustrate the fact that the energy EG does not actually playa role in physical processes as an energy, in competition with other energiesthat are driving the physical (chemical, electronic) processes of relevance. Ina clear sense EG is, instead, an energy uncertainty-and it is this uncertaintythat allows quantum state reduction to take place without violation of energyconservation. The fact that EG is far smaller than the other energies involvedin the relevant physical processes is a necessary feature of the consistency ofthe OR scheme. It does not supply the energy to drive the physical processesinvolved, but it provides the energy uncertainty that allows the freedom forprocesses having virtually the same energy as each other to be alternativeactions. In practice, all that EG is needed for is to tell us how to calculatethe lifetime τ of the superposition. EG would enter into issues of energybalance only if gravitational interactions between the parts of the system wereimportant in the processes involved. (The Earth's gravitational field plays norole in this either, because it cancels out in the calculation of EG.) No otherforces of nature directly contribute to EG, which is just as well, because ifthey did, there would be a gross discrepancy with observational physics.Tegmark, 2000. Physicist Max Tegmark (2000) confronted Orch OR on the basis ofdecoherence. This was discussed at length in Section 7.Koch and Hepp, 2006 . In a challenge to Orch OR, neuroscientists/physicists Kochand Hepp published a thought experiment in Nature, describing a person observinga superposition of a cat both dead and alive with one eye, the other eyedistracted by a series of images (binocular rivalry). They asked 'Where in theobserver's brain would reduction occur?', apparently assuming Orch OR followedthe Copenhagen interpretation in which conscious observation causes quantumstate reduction. This is precisely the opposite of Orch OR in whichconsciousness is the orchestrated quantum state reduction given by OR.Orch OR can account for the related issue of bistable perceptions (e.g. thefamous face/ vase illusion, or Necker cube). Non-conscious superpositions ofboth possibilities (face and vase) during pre-conscious quantum superpositionthen reduce by OR at time τ to conscious perception of one or the other, face orvase. The reduction would occur among microtubules within neurons interconnectedby gap junctions in various areas of visual and pre-frontal cortex and otherbrain regions.[images/00024.jpg]Figure 7. Simulating Fröhlich coherence in microtubules. A) Linear column oftubulins (protofilament) as simulated by Reimers et al (2010) which showed onlyweak Fröhlich condensation. B) and C) 2-dimensional tubulin sheets with toroidalboundary conditions (approximating 3-dimensional microtubule) simulated bySamsonovich et al (1992) shows long range Fröhlich resonance, with long-rangesymmetry, and nodes matching experimentally-observed MAP attachment patterns.Reimers et al (2009) described three types of Fröhlich condensation (weak,strong and coherent, the first classical and the latter two quantum). Theyvalidated 8 MHz coherence measured in microtubules by Pokorny (2001; 2004) asweak condensation. Based on simulation of a 1-dimensional linear chain oftubulin dimers representing a microtubule, they concluded only weak Fröhlichcondensation occurs in microtubules. Claiming Orch OR requires strong orcoherent Fröhlich condensation, they concluded Orch OR is invalid. HoweverSamsonovich et al (1992) simulated a microtubule as a 2-dimensional latticeplane with toroidal boundary conditions and found Fröhlich resonance maxima atdiscrete locations in super-lattice patterns on the simulated microtubulesurface which precisely matched experimentally observed functional attachmentsites for microtubuleassociated proteins (MAPs). Further, Bandyopadhyay (2011)has experimental evidence for strong Fröhlich coherence in microtubules atmultiple resonant frequencies.McKemmish et al (2010) challenged the Orch OR contention that tubulin switchingis mediated by London forces, pointing out that mobile π electrons in a benzenering (e.g. a phenyl ring without attachments) are completely delocalized, andhence cannot switch between states, nor exist in superposition of both states.Agreed. A single benzene cannot engage in switching. London forces occur betweentwo or more electron cloud ring structures, or other non-polar groups. A singlebenzene ring cannot support London forces. It takes two (or more) to tango. OrchOR has always maintained two or more non-polar groups are necessary (Figure 8).McKemmish et al are clearly mistaken on this point.[images/00025.jpg]Figure 8. A) Phenyl ring/benzene of 6 carbons with three extra πelectrons/double bonds which oscillate between two configurations according tovalence theory. B) Phenyl ring/ benzene according to molecular orbital theory inwhich π electrons/double bonds are delocalized, thus preventing oscillationbetween alternate states. No oscillation/switching can occur. C) Two adjacentphenyl rings/benzenes in which π electrons/double bonds are coupled, i.e. vander Waals London (dipole dispersion) forces. Two versions are shown: In topversion, lines represent double bond locations; in bottom version, dipoles arefilled in to show negative charge locations. D) Complex of 4 rings with Londonforces.McKemmish et al further assert that tubulin switching in Orch OR requiressignificant conformational structural change (as indicated in Figure 2), andthat the only mechanism for such conformational switching is due to GTPhydrolysis, i.e. conversion of guanosine triphophate (GTP) to guanosinediphosphate (GDP) with release of phosphate group energy, and tubulinconformational flexing. McKemmish et al correctly point out that drivingsynchronized microtubule oscillations by hydrolysis of GTP to GDP andconformational changes would be prohibitive in terms of energy requirements andheat produced. This is agreed. However, we clarify that tubulin switching inOrch OR need not actually involve significant conformational change (e. g. as isillustrated in Figure 2), that electron cloud dipole states (London forces) aresufficient for bit-like switching, superposition and qubit function. Weacknowledge tubulin conformational switching as discussed in early Orch ORpublications and illustrations do indicate significant conformational changes.They are admittedly, though unintentionally, misleading.[images/00026.jpg]Figure 9.

D) Current versionof Orch OR bit with no significant conformational change (change occurs at thelevel of atomic nuclei) and multiple hydrophobic pockets arranged in channels.The only tubulin conformational factor in Orch OR is superposition separationinvolved in EG, the gravitational self-energy of the tubulin qubit. Aspreviously described, we calculated EG for tubulin separated from itself atthree possible levels: 1) the entire protein(e.g. partial separation, as suggested in Figure 2), 2) its atomic nuclei, and3) its nucleons (protons and neutrons). The dominant effect is 2) separation atthe level of atomic nuclei, e.g. 2.5 Fermi length for carbon nuclei (2.5femtometers; 2.5 x 10-15 meters). This shift may be accounted for by Londonforce dipoles with Mossbauer nuclear recoil and charge effects (Hameroff, 1998).Tubulin switching in Orch OR requires neither GTP hydrolysis nor significantconformational changes.Schematic depiction of the tubulin bit, qubit and hydrophobic pockets in Orch ORhas evolved over the years. An updated version is described in the next Section. [images/00028.jpg]Figure 11. 2011 Orch OR tubulin qubit. Top: Alternate states of tubulin dimer(black and white) due to collective orientation of London force electron clouddipoles in non-polar hydrophobic regions. There is no evident conformationalchange as suggested in previous versions; conformational change occurs at thelevel of atomic nuclei. Bottom: Depiction of tubulin (gray) superpositioned inboth states.9. Topological Quantum Computing in Orch ORQuantum processes in Orch OR have consistently been ascribed to London forces intubulin hydrophobic pockets, non-polar intra-protein regions, e.g. of π electronresonance rings of aromatic amino acids including tryptophan and phenylalanine.This assertion is based on (1) Fröhlich's suggestion that protein states aresynchronized by electron cloud dipole oscillations in intra-protein non-polarregions, and (2) anesthetic gases selectively erasing consciousness by Londonforces in non-polar, hydrophobic regions in various neuronal proteins (e.g.tubulin, membrane proteins, etc.). London forces are weak, but numerous and ableto act cooperatively to regulate protein states (Voet and Voet, 1995).The structure of tubulin became known in 1998 (Nogales et al, 1998), allowingidentification of non-polar amino acids and hydrophobic regions. Figure 9 showslocations of phenyl and indole π electron resonance rings of non-polar aromaticamino acids phenylalanine and tryptophan in tubulin. The ring locations areclustered along somewhat continuous pathways (within 2 nanometers) throughtubulin. Thus, rather than hydrophobic pockets, tubulin may have within itquantum hydrophobic channels, or streams, linear arrays of electron resonanceclouds suitable for cooperative, long-range quantum London forces. These quantumchannels within each tubulin appear to align with those in adjacent tubulins inmicrotubule lattices, matching helical winding patterns (Figure 12). This inturn may support topological quantum computing in Orch OR.Quantum bits, or qubits in quantum computers are generally envisioned asinformation bits in superposition of simultaneous alternative representations,e.g. both 1 and 0. Topological qubits are superpositions of alternativepathways, or channels which intersect repeatedly on a surface, forming 'braids'.Quasiparticles called anyons travel along such pathways, the intersectionsforming logic gates, with particular braids or pathways corresponding withparticular information states, or bits. In superposition, anyons follow multiplebraided pathways simultaneously, then reduce, or collapse to one particularpathway and functional output. Topological qubits are intrinsically resistant todecoherence.An Orch OR qubit based on topological quantum computing specific to microtubulepolymer geometry was suggested in Hameroff et al. (2002). Conductances alongparticular microtubule lattice geometry, e.g. Fibonacci helical pathways, wereproposed to function as topological bits and qubits. Bandyopadhyay (2011) haspreliminary evidence for ballistic conductance along different, discrete helicalpathways in single microtubulesAs an extension of Orch OR, we suggest topological qubits in microtubules basedon quantum hydrophobic channels, e.g. continuous arrays of electron resonancerings within and among tubulins in microtubule lattices, e.g. followingFibonacci pathways. Cooperative London forces (electron cloud dipoles) inquantum hydrophobic channels may enable long-range coherence and topologicalquantum computing in microtubules necessary for optimal brain function andconsciousness.[images/00029.jpg]Figure 12. Left: Microtubule A-lattice configuration with lines connectingproposed hydrophobic channels of near-contiguous (<2 nanometer separation)electron resonance rings of phenylalanine and tryptophan. Right: MicrotubuleB-lattice with fewer such channels and lacking Fibonacci pathways. B-latticemicrotubules have a vertical seam dislocation (not shown).[images/00030.jpg]Figure 13. Extending microtubule A-lattice hydrophobic channels (Figure 12)results in helical winding patterns matching Fibonacci geometry. Bandyopadhyay(2011) has evidence for ballistic conductance and quantum inteference along suchhelical pathways which may be involved in topological quantum computing. Quantumelectronic states of London forces in hydrophobic channels result in slightsuperposition separation of atomic nuclei, sufficient EG for Orch OR. This imagemay be taken to represent superposition offour possible topological qubits which, after time T=tau, will undergo OR, andreduce to specific pathway(s) which then implement function. 10. Conclusion: Consciousness in the UniverseOur criterion for proto-consciousness is OR . It would be unreasonable to referto OR as the criterion for actual consciousness, because, according to the DPscheme, OR processes would be taking place all the time, and would be providingthe effective randomness that is characteristic of quantum measurement. Quantumsuperpositions will continually be reaching the DP threshold for OR innon-biological settings as well as in biological ones, and usually take place inthe purely random environment of a quantum system under measurement. Instead,our criterion for consciousness is Orch OR, conditions for which are fairlystringent: superposition must be isolated from the decoherence effects of therandom environment for long enough to reach the DS threshold. Smallsuperpositions are easier to isolate, but require longer reduction times τ.Large superpositions will reach threshold quickly, but are intrinsically moredifficult to isolate. Nonetheless, we believe that there is evidence that suchsuperpositions could occur within sufficiently large collections of microtubulesin the brain for τ to be some fraction of a second.Very large mass displacements can also occur in the universe inquantum-mechanical situations, for example in the cores of neutron stars. By OR, such superpositions would reduce extremely quickly, and classicallyunreasonable superpositions would be rapidly eliminated. Nevertheless, sentientcreatures might have evolved in parts of the universe that would be highly aliento us. One possibility might be on neutron star surfaces, an idea that wasdeveloped ingeniously and in great detail by Robert Forward in twosciencefiction stories (Dragon's Egg in 1980, Starquake in 1989). Such creatures(referred to as 'cheelas' in the books, with metabolic processes and OR-likeevents occurring at rates of around a million times that of a human being) couldarguably have intense experiences, but whether or not this would be possible indetail is, at the moment, a very speculative matter. Nevertheless, the Orch ORproposal offers a possible route to rational argument, as to whether life of atotally alien kind such as this might be possible, or even probable, somewherein the universe.Such speculations also raise the issue of the 'anthropic principle', accordingto which it is sometimes argued that the particular dimensionless constants ofNature that we happen to find in our universe are 'fortuitously' favorable tohuman existence. (A dimensionless physical constant is a pure number, like theratio of the electric to the gravitational force between the electron and theproton in a hydrogen atom, which in this case is a number of the general orderof 1040.) The key point is not so much to do with human existence, but theexistence of sentient beings of any kind. Is there anything coincidental aboutthe dimensionless physical constants being of such a nature that conscious lifeis possible at all? For example, if the mass of the neutron had been slightlyless than that of the proton, rather than slightly larger, then neutrons ratherthan protons would have been stable, and this would be to the detriment of thewhole subject of chemistry. These issues are frequently argued about (see Barrowand Tipler 1986), but the Orch OR proposal provides a little more substance tothese arguments, since a proposal for the possibility of sentient life is, inprinciple, provided.The recently proposed cosmological scheme of conformal cyclic cosmology (CCC)(Penrose 2010) also has some relevance to these issues. CCC posits that what wepresently regard as the entire history of our universe, from its Big-Bang origin(but without inflation) to its indefinitely expanding future, is but one aeon inan unending succession of similar such aeons, where the infinite future of eachmatches to the big bang of the next via an infinite change of scale. A questionarises whether the dimensionless constants of the aeon prior to ours, in the CCCscheme, are the same as those in our own aeon, and this relates to the questionof whether sentient life could exist in that aeon as well as in our own. Thesequestions are in principle answerable by observation, and again they would havea bearing on the extent or validity of the Orch OR proposal. If Orch OR turnsout to be correct, in it essentials, as a physical basis for consciousness, thenit opens up the possibility that many questions may become answerable, such aswhether life could have come about in an aeon prior to our own, that would havepreviously seemed to be far beyond the reaches of science.Moreover, Orch OR places the phenomenon of consciousness at a very central placein the physical nature of our universe, whether or not this 'universe' includesaeons other than just our own. It is our belief that, quite apart from detailedaspects of the physical mechanisms that are involved in the production ofconsciousness in human brains, quantum mechanics is an incomplete theory. Somecompletion is needed, and the DP proposal for an OR scheme underlying quantumtheory's R-process would be a definite possibility. If such a scheme as this isindeed respected by Nature, then there is a fundamental additional ingredient toour presently understood laws of Nature which plays an important role at thePlanck-scale level of space-time structure. The Orch OR proposal takes advantageof this, suggesting that conscious experience itself plays such a role in theoperation of the laws of the universe.Acknowledgment We thank Dave Cantrell, University of Arizona BiomedicalCommunications for artwork.ReferencesAtema, J.

CLARKE, PH.D.School of Mathematics, University of Southampton, University Road, SouthamptonSO17 1BJ, UKAbstractThis article presents a particular theoretical development related to theconceptualisation of the role of consciousness by Hameroff and Penrose. Thefirst three sections review, respectively: the different senses of\"consciousness\" and the sense to be used in this article; philosophicalconceptions of how consciousness in this sense can be said to do anything; andthe historical development of understanding of the role of consciousness inquantum theory. This background is then drawn upon in the last two sections,which present a cosmological perspective in which consciousness and quantumtheory are complementary processes governed by different logics.KEY WORDS:Qualia, Quantum cosmology, Quantum collapse, Epiphenomenalism,Histories interpretation, Quantum logic, Heidegger 1. Consciousness: What Are We Talking About?\"Consciousness\" is notoriously difficult to define because it is so fundamental;it is the precondition for our being able to do or know anything. Surveying thevoluminous controversies over the meaning of the word suggests, however, that\"consciousness\" tends to be used in two fairly distinct ways. Broadlyconsidered, just as the word \"spirit\" has two quite different referentialmeanings, viz., alcoholic beverage vs religion/parapsychology, so\"consciousness\" has two meanings: One meaning refers essentially to subjectiveexperience: our moment- by-moment qualitative awareness of what is happeningboth internally (thoughts, feelings) and externally. It is the \"what it is like\"of Nagel's seminal paper (Nagel, 1974). The other meaning is that used byDennett (1991). Taking to heart Wittgenstein's dictum that \"whereof one cannotspeak, thereof one must be silent\", he restricts the topic of consciousness tothose aspects of experience that we can report on, verbally, to other people.From this he is led to restrict the concept to that part of our internalexperience that is contained in our inner dialogue, the almost constant talkingto ourselves whereby we make sense of the world to ourselves in verbal terms.Thus consciousness in Dennett's sense of the word is the process of our forming\"drafts\" of parts of our internal dialogue. I shall call these senses of\"consciousness\" as used by Nagel and Dennett qualis-consciousness andquid-consciousness, respectively, from the Latin words for \"how\" and \"what\".Qualis is related to quale, quality, and with the idea that qualisconsciousnessis comprised of qualities (qualia) associated with perception and thinking.This difference between these two senses is crucial when we consider what weknow about the consciousness of other people or other beings. Whereas we can,and by its definition can only, explore the quid-consciousness of another personby talking to them, we can only know the non-verbal part of another'squalis-consciousness through empathy; that is, through our evolved capacity formirroring the sensations of others in response to a range of bodily cues andcontextual information (Berger, 1987). This means that, as cogently argued byNagel (1974), in the case of an organism like a bat with which it is difficultto have much empathy, we cannot know explicitly that they havequalis-consciousness, even though we might postulate that this is the casebecause they are mammals like ourselves. On the other hand when it comes to theverbally based quid-consciousness we know that bats, lacking language, cannothave it. The distinction between the two concepts is thus vital when discussingnon-human consciousness. Without deeper analysis, we cannot rule out theoccurrence of a \"hidden\" qualis-consciousness from any organism, or even fromphysical systems that we may not consider organisms at all - a vital point thatwill be revisited in section 5.2. What Does Consciousness Do?A major strand in the philosophy of consciousness concerns the notion ofepiphenomenalism - the idea that consciousness is an add-on that appears upon(\"epi\") information processing without having any functional role. This is notrelevant to quidconsciousness, which is actually a part of informationprocessing rather than something added to it. In the case ofqualis-consciousness, on the other hand, \"epiphenomenalism\" seems meaningfulwhile at the same time seeming odd, because the whole notion of causation, inthe physical sense, seems problematic in connection with qualisconsciousness.This consciousness does not do things like digesting food or moving limbs in apurely mechanical sense, but it comprises the whole of our experienced world(McGilchrist, 2009) and thereby establishes the context and preconditions as aresult of which doing-events like moving limbs take place. The distinctionbetween the two senses of \"consciousness\" lies not in whether they either dothings or not; it lies in the distinct categories of \"doing\" and \"being\" thatare involved. Quid-consciousness does things in a causal sense as part of awhole control structure of information processing. Qualisconsciousnessconstitutes a meaningful world within which doing is possible.Here it becomes a matter of one's philosophical position, whether or notqualisconsciousness is anything other than a sort of emotional fog generated byprocessing in the brain. If one adopts a scientific-realist position on whichthe world is entirely reducible to mechanical processes, thenqualis-consciousness is indeed such a fog. The alternative to this is torecognise that there is a whole area of discourse concerning existence, value,meaning and so on which is related to the mechanical properties of the world,but which is not equivalent to the mechanical aspect of the world.Since it is qualis-consciousness that raises the most significant problems inconsciousness studies, I shall from now on restrict attention to this sense ofthe word and, with this understood, I shall usually drop the \"qualis\" and justcall it \"consciousness\".3. The Changing View of the Role of Consciousness in Quantum Mechanics. The earlier history of this topic falls into four phases:(a) The \"quantum theory\" of Planck and Einstein, based on a conventionallymechanical concept of \"quanta\".(b) The \"quantum mechanics\" of Bohr and Heisenberg from about 1925. This wasbased on complementarity and the uncertainty principle, which increasinglyinvolved the idea of the collapse of the quantum state (also known as the wavefunction). It culminated in von Neumann's picture (von Neumann, 1932) of twoquite distinct processes: a smooth deterministic evolution of the state under adynamics, and a discontinuous transition from one state to another related toobservation. He did not, however, suppose that consciousness was peculiarlyconcerned in this, arguing that it was sufficient to consider the human being asan assemblage of rather sensitive physical detectors.(c) The views of Wigner and London and Bauer (London & Bauer,1939, 1983) thatconsciousness was essential for collapse. According to this, the quantum stateof the human brain was, through the process of experimental observation, coupledto the quantum state of a microscopic system; then the consciousness of thehuman being collapsed the joint state of human, apparatus and microsystem. Thisrole for consciousness was strictly limited. Consciousness was not responsiblefor determining what particular quantity was being measured, because this wasdetermined by the apparatus (a point that will be revisited in section 5). Itcould not bias the probabilities for different outcomes, because this wouldundermine the very laws of physics. All that consciousness could do was,somehow, to demand that some definite outcome did emerge, rather than a mixtureor superposition of possibilities.(d) A focus on the quantum-classical distinction. This began with Daneri,Loinger and Prosperi (1962) suggesting that \"collapse\" was the transition from aquantum state to a classical state, and that this was located not in the brainof the observer, but in the experimental apparatus. They showed that it was thelarge size of the apparatus, with a large number of possible quantum states alllinked to the state of the microsystem being observed, which averaged out thepeculiarly quantum mechanical nature of the microsystem, resulting in anessentially classical, non-quantum state for the apparatus. Subsequently Zeh(1970) included in this averaging-out of quantum states the highly effectiverole of interaction with the wider universe through the phenomenon of\"decoherence\". By this time the idea that consciousness had a role in quantumtheory came to be regarded as superfluous.In consequence of this history, it has become clear that we are here dealingwith two distinct (though interrelated) physical representations. One is thesuperposition of states, a peculiarly quantum effect resulting in, for instance,the interference patterns produced in the experiment where particles are firedtowards two parallel slits. The other is the statistical mixture of states usedto represent mathematically a situation such as the result of a rolling a dice,where there is a range of possible outcomes with different probabilities foreach. Considered purely mathematically, decoherence turns a superposition into amixture. This does not, however, explain why we are actually aware, at the endof the process, of one particular outcome as opposed to a fuzzy blur ofpossibilities. We may recall that this, and only this, was what consciousnesswas supposed to achieve on London and Bauer's earlier way of looking at things.Despite much clarification between 1939 and 1970, the possible role forconsciousness has remained little changed, and its operational details haveuntil recently remained obscure.4. The Perspective of Cosmology on the Role of ConsciousnessMore recent arguments from the surprising direction of cosmology now clarifythings a great deal. In particular, quantum cosmology starkly underlines theneed for something like consciousness. To take a particular example: the WMAPsatellite observations of the universe at an age of some 380,000 years confirm apicture in which the universe has evolved as if it started in a perfectly smoothhomogenous state (though strictly speaking there can be no \"initial state\" sincethe very earliest stages merge into the as yet unknown timeless conditions ofquantum gravity). By the epoch observed by WMAP we see minute fluctuationssuperimposed on this uniform background, of the same character as the quantumfluctuations that can be detected when a uniform beam of radiation is observedin the laboratory. On conventional theory, these cosmological fluctuations grewunder the influence of gravity to produce stars, galaxies and ourselves. Note,however, that in quantum theory it is the act of observation that precipitatesquantum fluctuations: without observation (in whatever generalised form we mayconceive it) a homogeneous initial state evolving under homogeneous laws mustremain homogeneous. So the early fluctuations that eventually give rise to theexistence of planets, people and WMAP are caused by observations such as thosemade by people and WMAP! The problem of quantum observation lies at the heart ofmodern cosmology.This cosmological perspective makes it clear that the bare mathematicalformalism of quantum theory in insufficient on its own. Without some additionalingredient, the universe would remain homogeneous and sterile. Two ideas fromquantum cosmology are needed in order to make sense of this. They will alsoprovide the key to the role of consciousness.The first was introduced by James Hartle (1991), building on the \"histories\"interpretation of Griffiths (1984). Instead of considering probabilities fordifferent outcomes to a single quantum observation, Hartle examined theprobabilities of sets of outcomes for any collection of observations scatteredthroughout the universe in space and time. The mathematics was almost the sameas it would have been if one had assumed a collapse of the wave functionsimultaneously across the universe with each observation; but strictly speakingthe latter concept cannot be used in cosmology because it is not consistent withthe fact that in relativity theory \"simultaneous\" is an observer-dependentconcept. By considering this \"super- observation\" extended over the whole ofspace-time there is no need to consider either collapse or issues of causalitybetween future and past events.Hartle gave no indication as to what was actually meant by an \"observation\" or\"observer\". This issue was made explicit through the second key idea, firstraised by Matthew Donald. He considered quid-consciousness - i.e. informationprocessing - but this cannot help because it is in no way essentially differentfrom any other purely mechanical process. Then, however, the idea was exploredby Don Page who focussed on \"sensation\", which is close to thequalis-consciousness of this paper. The aim of a cosmological theory, he argued,was to explain the universe as we see it, and this is equivalent to requiringthat the quantum state of the universe is compatible with an instance ofconscious sensation like ours. This in turn is equivalent to the quantum stateassigning a non-zero probability to such an instance. This then gives a new wayof thinking about the role of consciousness: consciousness does not alter thequantum state of the universe, but it imposes a filter on the state, selecting acomponent (if there is one) compatible with our capacity for sensation.The combined work of Hartle and Page gives a picture of a universe arising fromthe interplay of a background homogeneous quantum cosmology with possiblenetworks in space and time of instances of consciousness. Self-contradictorynetworks of awareness are ruled out because quantum mechanics assigns to them azero probability (Everett, 1957; Clarke, 1974) . But in addition the networks ofawareness are shaped by their own internal logic, manifested by qualis-consciousness and different from the Aristotelian logic of quid-consciousness(Clarke, 2007). This logic brings in elements such as agency and meaning.Consciousness, on this view, \"does something\", but by selection rather thanmodification, and in a way which is compatible with and dependent on the knownlaws of physics.5. A Theoretical Understanding of Consciousness and Quantum TheoryOne final building block still seems required: a non-arbitrary criterion isneeded for what physical systems have the capacity for (qualis-)consciousness.Many recent authors (de Quincey, 2002; Skrbina, 2005) have, however, come to theconclusion that no such criterion exists. In other words, everything might beconscious, a position known as \"panpsychism\". A problem remains, however: if\"everything\" is conscious, what is a \"thing\"? The answer of Heidegger (1967)concerned only a pejorative cultural aspect of the word; the answer of Döringand Isham (2011) invokes an ad hoc external mechanism; instead we need toexplore naturally occurring physical criteria for what is a thing. Aconsciousness-carrying \"thing\" must have some internal unity rather than beingan arbitrary aggregate of objects, which suggests that it has an internalcoherence. The simplest definition of this is that its parts are in quantumentanglement (Clarke, 2007) . In addition, it must not be merely an arbitrarysubset of a larger \"thing\", so that it must be maximal with respect to thiscoherence. In other words, it must be on the boundary between the quantum andthe classical, a boundary set by the onset of decoherence. The structuresconsidered by Hameroff and Penrose (1996) are of this sort.It now becomes clearer what consciousness does. At this quantum-classicalboundary the question of what \"observation\" (or, more formally, what algebra ofpropositions) is to be expressed is not yet determined by decoherence, and so isopen to determination by consciousness (Clarke, 2007). Following Hartle, thishappens not in isolation, but within the whole network of \"things\" throughoutthe universe. Physical causation operates through quantum state of the universe,while consciousness independently filters this into awareness through its ownsort of logic (in the sense of the structure of an algebra of propositions). Thelarge scope this gives for future experimental and theoretical research has beenoutlined in (Clarke, 2007,8). Several candidates for the logic of consciousnessare available, allowing us to understand how consciousness brings creativityalongside rational deduction. This model raises for the first time thepossibility of a rigorous theoretical framework for parapsychology (Clarke,2008) without which that subject remains only a semi-science. It turns out thatconsciousness can itself, through the \"Zeno effect\", enlarge the length scalefor the onset of decoherence, which then offers hope for understanding howsmall-scale elements can be \"orchestrated\", in Hameroff's sense (Hammeroff &Penrose, 1996), into the ego-consciousness known to us. In addition, there willbe other candidates for what a \"thing\" is, opening up alternative theories thatcan be tested against the theory just outlined.References Berger, D. M. (1987).

In the Copenhagen modelof physics, the process of observing is believed to effect reality by the act ofperception and knowing which creates abstractions and a collapse functionthereby inducing discontinuity into the continuum of the quantum state. Thisgives rise to the uncertainty principle. Yet neither the mind or the brain is asingularity, but a multiplicity which include two dominant streams ofconsciousness and awareness associated with the left and right hemisphere, asdemonstrated by patients whose brains have been split, and which aresuperimposed on yet other mental realms maintained by the brainstem, thalamus,limbic system, and the occipital, temporal, parietal, and frontal lobes. Likethe quantum state, each of these minds may also become discontinuous from eachother and each mental realm may perceive their own reality. Illustrativeexamples are detailed, including denial of blindness, blind sight, fragmentationof the body image, phantom limbs, the splitting of the mind following splitbrainsurgery, and dissociative states where the mind leaves the body and achieves astate of quantum consciousness and singularity such that the universe and mindbecome one.1. IntroductionIn 1905 Albert Einstein published his theories of relativity, which promoted thethesis that reality and its properties, such as time and motion had no objective\"true values\", but were \"relative\" to the observer's point of view (Einstein,1905a,b,c). However, what if the observer is not a singularity and has more thanone point of view and more than one stream of observing consciousness? And whatif these streams of consciousness were also relative?Quantum physics, as exemplified by the Copenhagen school (Bohr, 1934, 1958,1963; Heisenberg, 1930, 1955, 1958), also makes assumptions about the nature ofreality as related to an observer, the \"knower\" who is conceptualized as asingularity. Because the physical world is relative to being known by a \"knower\"(the observing consciousness), then the \"knower\" can influence the nature of thereality which is being observed. In consequence, what is known vs what is notknown becomes relatively imprecise (Heisenberg, 1958).For example, as expressed by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle (Heisenberg,1955, 1958), the more precisely one physical property is known the moreunknowable become other properties, whose measurements become correspondinglyimprecise. The more precisely one property is known, the less precisely theother can be known and this is true at the molecular and atomic levels ofreality. Therefore it is impossible to precisely determine, simultaneously, forexample, both the position and velocity of an electron.However, we must ask: if knowing A, makes B unknowable, and if knowing B makes Aunknowable, wouldn't this imply that both A and B, are in fact unknowable? Ifboth A and B are manifestations of the processing of \"knowing,\" and if observingand measuring can change the properties of A or B, then perhaps both A and B arein fact properties of knowing, properties of the observing consciousness, andnot properties of A or B.In quantum physics, nature and reality are represented by the quantum state. Theelectromagnetic field of the quantum state is the fundamental entity, thecontinuum that constitutes the basic oneness and unity of all things.The physical nature of this state can be \"known\" by assigning it mathematicalproperties (Bohr, 1958, 1963). Therefore, abstractions, i.e., numbers, becomerepresentational of a hypothetical physical state. Because these areabstractions, the physical state is also an abstraction and does not possess thematerial consistency, continuity, and hard, tangible, physical substance as isassumed by Classical (Newtonian) physics. Instead, reality, the physical world,is created by the process of observing, measuring, and knowing (Heisenberg,1955).Consider an elementary particle, once this positional value is assigned,knowledge of momentum, trajectory, speed, and so on, is lost and becomes\"uncertain.\" The particle's momentum is left uncertain by an amount inverselyproportional to the accuracy of the position measurement which is determined byvalues assigned by the observing consciousness. Therefore, the nature ofreality, and the uncertainty principle is directly affected by the observer andthe process of observing and knowing (Heisenberg, 1955, 1958).The act of knowing creates a knot in the quantum state; described as a \"collapseof the wave function;\" a knot of energy that is a kind of blemish in thecontinuum of the quantum field. This quantum knot bunches up at the point ofobservation, at the assigned value of measurement.The process of knowing, makes reality, and the quantum state, discontinuous.\"The discontinuous change in the probability function takes place with the actof registration… in the mind of the observer\" (Heisenberg, 1958).Reality, therefore, is a manifestation of alterations in the patterns ofactivity within the electromagnetic field which are perceived as discontinuous.The perception of a structural unit of information is not just perceived, but isinserted into the quantum state which causes the reduction of the wave-packetand the collapse of the wave function.Knowing and not knowing, are the result of interactions between the mind andconcentrations of energy that emerge and disappear back into the electromagneticquantum field.However, if reality is created by the observing consciousness, and can be madediscontinuous, does this leave open the possibility of a reality behind thereality? Might there be multiple realities? And if consciousness and theobserver and the quantum state is not a singularity, could each of thesemultiple realities also be manifestations of a multiplicity of minds?Heinserberg (1958) recognized this possibility of hidden realities, andtherefore proposed that the reality that exists beyond or outside the quantumstate could be better understood when considered in terms of \"potential\" realityand \"actual\" realities. Therefore, although the quantum state does not have theontological character of an \"actual\" thing, it has a \"potential\" reality; anobjective tendency to become actual at some point in the future, or to havebecome actual at some point in the past.Therefore, it could be said that the subatomic particles which make up reality,or the quantum state, do not really exist, except as probabilities. These\"subatomic\" particles have probable existences and display tendencies to assumecertain patterns of activity that we perceive as shape and form. Yet, they mayalso begin to display a different pattern of activity such that being can becomenonbeing and thus something else altogether.The conception of a deterministic reality is therefore subjugated tomathematical probabilities and potentiality which is relative to the mind of aknower which effects that reality as it unfolds, evolves, and is observed (Bohr1958, 1963; Heisenberg 1955, 1958). That is, the mental act of perceiving anon-localized unit of structural information, injects that mental event into thequantum state of the universe, causing \"the collapse of the wave function\" andcreating a bunching up, a tangle and discontinuous knot in the continuity of thequantum state.Einstein ridiculed these ideas (Pais, 1979): \"Do you really think the moon isn'tthere if you aren't looking at it?\"Heisenberg (1958), cautioned, however, that the observer is not the creator ofreality: \"The introduction of the observer must not be misunderstood to implythat some kind of subjective features are to be brought into the description ofnature. The observer has, rather, only the function of registering decisions,i.e., processes in space and time, and it does not matter whether the observeris an apparatus or a human being; but the registration, i.e., the transitionfrom the \"possible\" to the \"actual,\" is absolutely necessary here and cannot beomitted from the interpretation of quantum theory.\"Shape and form are a function of our perception of dynamic interactions withinthe continuum which is the quantum state. What we perceive as mass (shape, form,length, weight) are dynamic patterns of energy which we selectively attend toand then perceive as stable and static, creating discontinuity within thecontinuity of the quantum state. Therefore, what we are perceiving and knowing,are only fragments of the continuum.However, we can only perceive what our senses can detect, and what we detect asform and shape is really a mass of frenzied subatomic electromagnetic activitythat is amenable to detection by our senses and which may be known by a knowingmind. It is the perception of certain aspects of these oscillating patterns ofcontinuous evolving activity, which give rise to the impressions of shape andform, and thus discontinuity, as experienced within the mind.This energy that makes up the object of our perceptions, is therefore but anaspect of the electromagnetic continuum which has assumed a specific patternduring the process of being sensed and processed by those regions of the brainand mind best equipped to process this information. Perceived reality,therefore, becomes a manifestation of mind.However, if the mind is not a singularity, and if we possessed additional sensesor an increased sensory channel capacity, we would perceive yet other patternsand other realities which would be known by those features of the mind bestattuned to them. If the mind is not a singularity but a multiplicity, this meansthat both A and B, may be known simultaneously.2. Duality vs MultiplicityIn the Copenhagen model, the observer is external to the quantum state theobserver is observing, and they are not part of the collapse function but awitness of it (Bohr, 1958, 1963; Heisenberg 1958). However, if the Copenhagenmodel is correct, and as the cosmos contains observers, then the standardcollapse formulation can not be used to describe the entire universe as theuniverse contains observers (von Neumann, 1932, 1937).Further, reality becomes, at a minimum, a duality (observer and observed) withthe potential to become a multiplicity.As described by DeWitt and Graham (1973; Dewitt, 1971), \"This reality, which isdescribed jointly by the dynamical variables and the state vector, is not thereality we customarily think of, but is a reality composed of many worlds. Byvirtue of the temporal development of the dynamical variables the state vectordecomposes naturally into orthogonal vectors, reflecting a continual splittingof the universe into a multitude of mutually unobservable but equally realworlds, in each of which every good measurement has yielded a definite resultand in most of which the familiar statistical quantum laws hold.\"The minimal duality is that aspect of reality which is observed, measured, andknown, and that which is unknown. However, this minimal duality is an illusionas indicated not only by the potential to become multiplicity, but by the natureof mind which is not a singularity (Joseph, 1982, 1986a; 1988a,b).Even if we disregard the concept of \"mind\" and substitute the word \"brain\", thefact remains that the brain is not a singularity. The human brain isfunctionally specialized with specific functions and different mental stateslocalized to specific areas, each of which is capable of maintaining independentand semi-independent aspects of conscious-awareness (Joseph 1986a,b, 1988a,b,1992, 1999a). Different aspects of the same experience and identical aspects ofthat experience may be perceived and processed by different brain areas indifferent ways (Gallagher and Joseph, 1982; Joseph 1982; Joseph and Gallagher1985; Joseph et al., 1984).Therefore, although it has been said that orthodox quantum mechanics iscompletely concordant with the defining characteristics of Cartesian dualism,this is an illusion. Cartesian duality assumes singularity of mind, when infact, the overarching organization of the mind- and the brain- is both dualisticand multiplistic.If quantum physics is \"mind-like\" (actual/operational at the quantum level, butmentalistic on the ontological level) then quantum physics, or rather, thequantum state (reality, the universe) is not a duality, but a multiciplicity.Indeed, the entire concept of duality is imposed on reality by the dominantdualistic nature of the brain and mind which subordinates not just reality, butthe multiplicity of minds maintained within the human brain (Joseph, 1982).Like the Copenhagen school, Von Neumann's formulation of quantum mechanics(1932, 1937), fails to recognize or understand the multiple nature of mind andreality. Von Neumann postulated that the physical aspects of nature arerepresented by a density matrix. The matrix, therefore, could be conceptualizedas a subset of potential realities, and that by averaging the values of theseevolving matrices, the state of the universe and thus of reality, can beascertained as a unified whole. However, in contrast to the Copenhageninterpretation, Von Neumann shifted the observer (his brain) into the quantumuniverse and thus made it subject to the rules of quantum physics.Ostensibly and explicitly, Von Neumann's conceptions are based on a conceptionof mind as a singularity acting on the quantum state which contains the brain.Von Neumann's mental singularity, therefore, imposes itself on reality, suchthat each \"event\" that occurs within reality, is associated with one specificexperience of the singularity-mind. Thus, Von Neumann assumes the brain and mindhas only \"one experience\" which corresponds with \"one event;\" and this grosslyerroneous misconception of the nature of the brain and mind, unfortunately, iserroneously accepted as fact by most cosmologists and physicists. Further, heargues that in the process of knowing, the quantum state of this singularitybrain/mind also collapses, or rather, is reduced in a mathematicallyquantifiable manner, just as the quantum universe is collapsed and reduced bybeing known (Von Neumann, 1932, 1937).However, the brain and mind are not a singularity, but a multiplicity (Joseph,1982, 1988a,b, 1999a). Nevertheless, Von Neumann's conceptions can be applied tothe multiplicity of mind/brain when each mental realm is considered individuallyas an interactional subset of the multiplicity.3. The Multiplicity of Mind and PerceptionAccording to Von Neumann (1932), the \"experiential increments in a person’sknowledge\" and \"reductions of the quantum mechanical state of that person’sbrain\" corresponds to the elimination of all those perceptual functions that arenot necessary or irrelevant to the knowing of the event and the increase in theknowledge associated with the experience. If considered from the perspective ofan isolated aspect of the mind and the dominating stream of consciousness, VonNeuman's conceptions are essentially correct. However, neither the brain nor themind function in isolation but in interaction with other neural tissues andmental/perceptual/sensory realms (Joseph 1982, 1992, 1999a). Perceptualfunctions are not \"eliminated\" and removed from the brain. Instead, they areprevented from interfering with the attentional processes of one aspect of themultiplicity of mind which dominates during the knowing event (Joseph, 1986b,1999a).Consider, by way of example, you are sitting in your office reading this text.The pressure of the chair, the physical sensations of your shoes and clothes,the musculature of your body as it holds one then another position, thetemperature of the room, various odors and fragrances, a multitude of sounds,visual sensations from outside your area of concentration and focus, and so on,are all being transmitted to the brainstem, midbrain, and olfactory limbicsystem. These signals are then relayed to various subnuclei within the thalamus.[images/00031.jpg][images/00032.jpg]The neural tissues of the brainstem, midbrain, limbic system and thalamus areassociated with the \"old brain.\" However, those aspects of consciousness we mostclosely associated with humans are associated with the \"new brain\" the neocortex(Joseph, 1982, 1992). Therefore, although you may be \"aware\" of these sensationswhile they are maintained within the old brain, you are not \"conscious\" of them,unless a decision is made to become conscious or they increase sufficiently inintensity that they are transferred to the neocortex via the the thalamus andfrontal lobes, and forced into the focus of consciousness (Joseph, 1982, 1986b,1992, 1999a).[images/00033.jpg]The old brain is covered by a gray mantle of new cortex, neocortex. Thesensations alluded to are transferred from the old brain to the thalamus whichrelays these signals to the neocortex. Human consciousness and the \"higher\"level of the multiplicity of mind, are associated with the \"new brain.\"[images/00034.jpg][images/00035.jpg][images/00036.jpg][images/00037.jpg](Left) The Corona Radiata. - The human Brainstem & Thalamus (Right)For example, visual input is transmitted from the eyes to the midbrain andthalamus and is transferred to the primary visual receiving area maintained inthe neocortex of the occipital lobe (Casagrande & Joseph 1978, 1980; Joseph andCasagrande, 1978). Auditory input is transmitted from the inner ears to thebrainstem, midbrain, and thalamus, and is transferred to the primary auditoryreceiving area within the neocortex of the temporal lobe. Tactualphysicalstimuli are also transmitted from the thalamus to the primary somatosensoryareas maintained in the neocortex of the parietal lobe. From the primary areasthese signals are transferred to the adjoining \"association\" areas, and simplepercepts become more complex by association (Joseph, 1996).[images/00038.jpg]Monitoring all this perceptual and sensory activity within the thalamus andneocortex is the frontal lobes of the brain, also known as the senior executiveof the brain and personality (Joseph 1986b, 1999a; Joseph et al., 1981). It isthe frontal lobes which maintain the focus of attention and which canselectively inhibit any additional processing of signals received in the primaryareas.There are two frontal lobes, a right and left frontal lobe which communicate viaa bridge of nerve fibers. Each frontal lobe, and subdivisions within each areconcerned with different types of mental activity (Joseph, 1999a).The left frontal lobe, among its many functions, makes possible the ability tospeak. It is associated with the verbally expressive, speaking aspects ofconsciousness. However, there are different aspects of consciousness associatednot only with the frontal lobe, but with each lobe of the brain and itssubdivisions (Joseph, 1986b; 1996, 1999a).4. Knowing Yet Not Knowing: Disconnected ConsciousnessConsider the well known phenomenon of \"word finding difficulty\" also known as\"tip of the tongue.\" You know the word you want (the \"thingamajig\") but at thesame time, you can't gain access to it. That is, one aspect of consciousnessknows the missing word, but another aspect of consciousness associated withtalking and speech can't gain access to the word. The mind is disconnected fromitself. One aspect of mind knows, the other aspect of mind does not.[images/00039.jpg]This same phenomenon, but much more severe and disabling, can occur if the nervefiber pathway linking the language areas of the left hemisphere are damaged. Forexample, Broca's area in the frontal lobe organizes words received from theposterior langauge areas, and expresses humans speech. Wernicke's area in thetemporal lobe comprehends speech. The inferior parietal lobe in association withthe frontal lobes and Broca’s area, associates and assimilates associations sothat, for example, we can say the word \"dog\" and come up with the names ofdozens of different breeds and then visualize and describe them (Joseph, 1982;Joseph and Gallagher 1985; Joseph et al., 1984). Therefore, if Broca's area isdisconnected from the posterior language areas, one aspect of consciousness mayknow what it wants to say, but the speaking aspect of consciousness will beunable to gain access to it and will have nothing to say; called \"conductionaphasia.\"[images/00040.jpg]Or consider damage which disconnects the parietal lobe from Broca's area. If youplace an object, e.g., a comb, out-of-sight, in the person's right hand, and askthem to name the object, the speaking aspect of consciousness may know somethingis in the hand, but will be unable to name it. However, although they can't nameit, and can't guess if shown pictures, if the patient is asked to point to thecorrect object, they will correctly pick out the comb (Joseph, 1996). Therefore,part of the brain and mind may act purposefully (e.g. picking out the comb),whereas another aspect of the brain and mind is denied access to the informationthat the disconnected part of the mind is acting on.Thus, the part of the brain and mind which is perceiving and knowing, is not thesame as the part of the brain and mind which is speaking. This phenomenon occurseven in undamaged brains, when the multiplicity of minds which make up one ofthe dominant streams of consciousness, become disconnected and/or are unable tocommunicate.5. The Visual Mind: Denial of BlindnessAll visual sensations first travel from the eyes to the thalamus and midbrain.At this level, these visual impressions are outside of consciousness, though wemay be aware of them. These visual sensations are then transferred to theprimary visual receiving areas and to the adjacent association areas in theneocortex of the occipital lobe. Once these visual impressions reach theneocortex, consciousness of the visual word is achieved. Visual consciousness ismade possible by the occipital lobe.[images/00041.jpg][images/00042.jpg]Destruction of the occipital lobe and its neocortical visual areas results incortical blindness (Joseph, 1996). The consciousness mind is blinded and can notsee or sense anything except vague sensations of lightness and darkness.However, because visual consciousness is normally maintained within theoccipital lobe, with destruction of this tissue, the other mental systems willnot know that they can't see. The remaining mental system do not know they areblind.Wernicke's area in the left temporal lobe in association with the inferiorparietal lobe comprehends and can generate complex language. Normally, visualinput is transferred from the occipital to the inferior parietal lobe (IPL)which is adjacent to Wernicke's area and the visual areas of the occipital lobe.Once these signals arrive in the IPL a person can name what they see; the visualinput is matched with auditory-verbal signals and the conscious mind can labeland talk about what is viewed (Joseph, 1982, 1986b; Joseph et al., 1984).Talking and verbally describing what is seen is made possible when this streamof information is transferred to Broca's area in the left frontal lobe (Joseph,1982, 1999a). It is Broca's area which speaks and talks.Therefore, with complete destruction of the occipital lobe, visual consciousnessis abolished whereas the other mental system remain intact but are unable toreceive information about the visual world. In consequence, the verbal aspectsof consciousness and the verbal-language mind does not know it can't see becausethe brain area responsible for informing these mental system about seeing, nolonger exists. . In fact the languagedependent conscious mind will deny that itis blind; and this is called: Denial of blindness.Normally, if it gets dark, or you close your eyes, the visual mind becomesconscious of this change in light perception and will alert the other mentalrealms. These other mental realms do not process visual signals and thereforethey must be informed about what the visual mind is seeing. If the occipitallobe is destroyed, visual consciousness is destroyed, and the rest of the braincannot be told that visual consciousness can't see. Therefore, the rest of thebrain does not know it is blind, and when asked, will deny blindness and willmake up reasons for why they bump into furniture or can't recognize objects heldbefore their eyes (Joseph, 1986b, 1988a).For example, when unable to name objects, they might confabulate an explanation:\"I see better at home.\" Or, \"I tripped because someone moved the furniture.\"[images/00043.jpg]Even if you tell them they are blind, they will deny blindness; that is, theverbal aspects of consciousness will claim it can see, when it can't. TheLanguage-dependent aspects of consciousness does not know that it is blindbecause information concerning blindness is not being received from the mentalrealms which support visual consciousness.The same phenomenon occurs with small strokes destroying just part of theoccipital lobe. Although a patient may lose a quarter or even half of theirvisual field, they may be unaware of it. This is because that aspect of visualconsciousness no longer exists and can't inform the other mental realms of itscondition.6. \"Blind Sight\"The brains of reptiles, amphibians, and fish do not have neocortex. Visual inputis processed in the midbrain and thalamus and other old-brain areas as thesecreatures do not possess neocortex or lobes of the brain. In humans, thisinformation is also received in the brainstem and thalamus and is thentransferred to the newly evolved neocortex. As is evident in non-mammalianspecies, these creatures can see, and they are aware of their environment. Theypossess an older-cortical (brainstem-thalamus) visual awareness which in humansis dominated by neocortical visual consciousness.[images/00044.jpg][images/00045.jpg][images/00046.jpg](Left) Human Brain. Reptile Brain (Right)Therefore, even with complete destruction of the visual neocortex, and after thepatient has had time to recover, some patients will demonstrate a non-consciousawareness of their visual environment. Although they are cortically blind andcan't name objects and stumble over furniture and bump into walls, they maycorrectly indicate if an object is moving in front of their face, and they mayturn their head or even reach out their arms to touch it-just as a frog can seea fly buzzing by and lap it up with its tongue. Although the patient can't nameor see what has moved in front of his face, he may report that he has a\"feeling\" that something has moved.Frogs do not have neocortex and they do not have language, and can't describewhat they see. However, humans and frogs have old cortex that process visualimpressions and which can control and coordinate body movements. Therefore,although the neocortical realms of human consciousness are blind, the mentalrealms of the old brain can continue to see and can act on what it sees; andthis is called: Blind sight (Joseph, 1996).7. Body Consciousness: Denial of the Body, and Phantom LimbsAll tactile and physical-sensory impressions are relayed from the body to thebrainstem and the thalamus, and are then transferred to the primary receivingand then the association area for somatosensory information located in theneocortex of the parietal lobe (Joseph, 1986b, 1996). The entire image of thebody is represented in the parietal lobes (the right and left half of the bodyin the left and right parietal lobe respectively), albeit in correspondence withthe sensory importance of each body part. Therefore, more neocortical space isdevoted to the hands and fingers than to the elbow.It is because the body image and body consciousness is maintained in theparietal area of the brain, that victims of traumatic amputation and who lose anarm or a leg, continue to feel as if their arm or their leg is still attached tothe body. This is called: phantom limbs. They can see the leg is missing, butthey feel as if it is still there; body-consciousness remains intact even thoughpart of the body is missing (Joseph, 1986b, 1996). They may also continue toperiodically experience the pain of the physical trauma which led to theamputation, and this is called \"phantom limb pain.\"[images/00047.jpg][images/00048.jpg][images/00049.jpg]Thus, via the mental system of the parietal lobe, consciousness of what is notthere, may appear to consciousness as if it is still there. This is not ahallucination. The image of the body is preserved in the brain and so to isconsciousness of the body; and this is yet another example of experiencedreality being a manifestation of the brain and mind. In this regard, reality isliterally mapped into the brain and is represented within the brain, such thateven when aspects of this \"reality\" are destroyed and no longer exists externalto the brain, it nevertheless continues to be perceived and experienced by thebrain and the associated realms of body-consciousness.Conversely, if the parietal lobe is destroyed, particularly the right parietallobe (which maintains an image of the left half of the body), half of the bodyimage may be erased from consciousness (Joseph, 1986b, 1988a). The remainingrealms of mind will lose all consciousness of the left half of the body, which,in their minds, never existed.Doctor: \"Give me your right hand!\" (Patient offers right hand). \"Now give meyour left!\" (The patient presents the right hand again. The right hand is held.)\"Give me your left!\" (The patient looks puzzled and does not move.) \"Is thereanything wrong with your left hand?\"Patient: \"No, doctor.\" Doctor: \"Why don't you move it, then?\" Patient: \"I don't know.\" Doctor: \"Is this your hand?\" (The left hand is held before her eyes.) Patient: \"Not mine, doctor.\" Doctor: \"Whose hand is it, then?\" Patient: \"I suppose it's yours, doctor.\" Doctor: \"No, it's not; I've already got two hands. look at it carefully.\" (Theleft hand is again held before her eyes.) Patient: \"It is not mine, doctor.\" Doctor: \"Yes it is, look at that ring; whose is it?\" (Patient's finger withmarriage ring is held before her eyes) Patient: \"That's my ring; you've got my ring, doctor. You're wearing my ring!\" Doctor: \"Look at it—it is your hand.\" Patient: \"Oh, no doctor.\" Doctor: \"Where is your left hand then?\" Patient: \"Somewhere here, I think.\" (Making groping movements near her leftshoulder).Because the body image has been destroyed, consciousness of that half of thebody is also destroyed. The remaining mental systems and the language-dependentconscious mind will completely ignore and fail to recognize their left arm orleg because the mental system responsible for consciousness of the body image nolonger exists. If the left arm or leg is shown to them, they will claim itbelongs to someone else, such as the nurse or the doctor. They may dress orgroom only the right half of their body, eat only off the right half of theirplates, and even ignore painful stimuli applied to the left half of their bodies(Joseph, 1986b, 1988a).However, if you show them their arm and leg (whose ownership they deny), theywill admit these extremities exists, but will insist the leg or arm does notbelong to them, even though the arm or the leg is wearing the same clothescovering the rest of their body. Instead, the language dependent aspects ofconsciousness will confabulate and make up explanations and thus create theirown reality. One patient said the arm belonged to a little girl, whose arm hadslipped into the patient's sleeve. Another declared (speaking of his left armand leg), \"That's an old man. He stays in bed all the time.\"One such patient engaged in peculiar erotic behavior with his left arm and legwhich he believed belonged to a woman. Some patients may develop a dislike fortheir left arms, try to throw them away, become agitated when they are referredto, entertain persecutory delusions regarding them, and even complain of strangepeople sleeping in their beds due to their experience of bumping into their leftlimbs during the night (Joseph, 1986b, 1988a). One patient complained that theperson sharing her bed, tried to push her out of the bed and then insisted thatif it happened again she would sue the hospital. Another complained about \"ahospital that makes people sleep together.\" A female patient expressed not onlyanger but concern least her husband should find out; she was convinced it was aman in her bed.The right and left parietal lobes maintain a map and image of the left and righthalf of the body, respectively. Therefore, when the right parietal lobe isdestroyed, the languagedependent mental systems of the left half of the brain,having access only to the body image for the right half of the body, is unableto become conscious of the left half of their body, except as body parts thatthey then deduce must belong to someone else.However, when the language dominant mental system of the left hemisphere deniesownerhip of the left extremity these mental system are in fact telling thetruth. That is, the left arm and leg belongs to the right not the lefthemisphere; the mental system that is capable of becoming conscious of the lefthalf of their body no longer exist.When the language axis (Joseph, 1982, 2000), i.e. the inferior parietal lobe,Broca's and Wernicke's areas, are functionally isolated from a particular sourceof information, the language dependent aspect of mind begins to make up aresponse based on the information available. To be informed about the left legor left arm, it must be able to communicate with the cortical area (i.e. theparietal lobe) which is responsible for perceiving and analyzing informationregarding the extremities. When no message is received and when the languageaxis is not informed that no messages are being transmitted, the language zonesinstead relie on some other source even when that source provides erroneousinput (Joseph, 1982, 1986b; Joseph et al., 1984); substitute material isassimilated and expressed and corrections cannot be made (due to loss of inputfrom the relevant knowledge source). The patient begins to confabulate. This isbecause the patient who speaks to you is not the 'patient' who is perceiving-they are in fact, separate; multiple minds exist in the same head.8. Split-Brains and Split-Minds.The multiplicity of mind is not limited to visual consciousness, bodyconsciousness, or the language-dependent consciousness. Rather the multiplicityof mind include social consciousness, emotional consciousness, and numerousother mental realms linked with specific areas of the brain (Joseph, 1982,1986a,b, 1988a,b, 1992, 1999a), such as the limbic system (emotion), frontallobes (rational thought), the inferior temporal lobes (memory) and the twohalves of the brain where multiple streams of mental activity becomesubordinated and dominated by two distinct realms of mind; consciousness andawareness (Joseph, 1982, 1986a,b, 1988a,b).[images/00050.jpg]The brain is not a singularity. This is most apparent when viewing the right andleft half of the brain which are divided by the interhemispheric fissure andalmost completely split into two cerebral hemispheres. These two brain halvesare connected by a rope of nerve fibers, the corpus callosum, which enables themto share and exchange some information, but not all information as these twomental realms maintain a conscious awareness of different realities.For example, it is well established that the right cerebral hemisphere isdominant over the left in regard to the perception, expression and mediation ofalmost all aspects of social and emotional functioning and related aspects ofsocial/emotional language and memory. Further, the right hemisphere is dominantfor most aspects of visual-spatial perceptual functioning, the comprehension ofbody language, the recognition of faces including friend's loved ones, and one'sown face in the mirror (Joseph, 1988a, 1996).Recognition of one's own body and the maintenance of the personal body image isalso the dominant realm of the right half of the brain (Joseph, 1986b, 1988a).The body image, for many, is tied to personal identity; and the same is true ofthe recognition of faces including one's own face.The right is also dominant for perceiving and analyzing visual-spatialrelationships, including the movement of the body in space (Joseph, 1982,1988a). Therefore, one can throw or catch a ball with accuracy, dance across astage, or leap across a babbling brook without breaking a leg.The perception of environmental sounds (water, wind, a meowing cat) and thesocial, emotional, musical, and melodic aspects of language, including theability to sing, curse, or pray, are also the domain of the right hemispheremental system (Joseph, 1982, 1988a). Hence, it is the right hemisphere whichimparts the sounds of sarcasm, pride, humor, love, and so on, into the stream ofspeech, and which conversely can determine if others are speaking withsincerity, irony, or evil intentions.[images/00051.jpg][images/00052.jpg]By contrast, expressive and receptive speech, linguistic knowledge and thought,mathematical and analytical reasoning, reading, writing, and arithmetic, as wellas the temporal-sequential and rhythmical aspects of consciousness, areassociated with the functional integrity of the left half of the brain in themajority of the population (Joseph, 1982, 1996). The language-dependent mind islinked to the left hemisphere.Certainly, there is considerable overlap in functional representation. Moreover,these two mental system interact and assist the other, just as the left andright hands cooperate and assist the other in performing various tasks. Forexample, if you were standing at the bar in a nightclub, and someone were to tapyou on the shoulder and say, \"Do you want to step outside,\" it is the mentalsystem of the left hemisphere which understands that a question about \"outside\"has been asked, but it is the mental system of the right which determines theunderlying meaning, and if you are being threatened with a punch in the nose, orif a private conversation is being sought.However, not all information can be transferred from the right to the left, andvice versa (Gallagher and Joseph, 1982; Joseph, 1982, 1988a; Joseph andGallagher, 1985; Joseph et al., 1984). Because each mental system is unique,each \"speaks a different language\" and they cannot always communicate. Not allmental events can be accurately translated, understood, or even recognized bythe other half of the brain. These two major mental systems, which could belikened to \"consciousness\" vs \"awareness\" exist in parallel, simultaneously, andboth can act independently of the other, have different goals and desires, andcome to completely different conclusions. Each mental system has its ownreality.The existence of these two independent mental realms is best exemplified anddemonstrated following \"split-brain\" surgery; i.e. the cutting of the corpuscallosum fiber pathway which normally allows the two hemisphere's tocommunicate.As described by Nobel Lauriate Roger Sperry (1966, p. 299), \"Everything we haveseen indicates that the surgery has left these people with two separate minds,that is, two separate spheres of consciousness. What is experienced in the righthemisphere seems to lie entirely outside the realm of awareness of the lefthemisphere. This mental division has been demonstrated in regard to perception,cognition, volition, learning and memory.\"[images/00053.jpg]The right half of the brain controls and perceives the left half of the body andvisual space, whereas the right half of the body and visual space is the domainof the left hemisphere. Therefore, following split-brain surgery, if a comb,spoon, or some other hidden object is placed in the left hand (out of sight),the left hemisphere, and the language-dependent conscious mind, will not evenknow the left hand is holding something and will be unable to name it, describeit, or if given multiple choices point to the correct item with the right hand(Joseph 1988a,b; Sperry, 1966). However, the right hemisphere can raise the lefthand and not only point to the correct object, but can pantomime its use.[images/00054.jpg]If the split-brain patient is asked to stare at the center of a white screen andwords like \"Key Ring\" are quickly presented, such that the word \"Key\" falls inthe left visual field (and thus, is transmitted to the right cerebrum) and theword \"Rings\" falls in the right field (and goes to the left hemisphere), thelanguage dependent conscious mind will not see the word \"Key.\" If asked, thelanguage-dependent conscious mind will say \"Ring\" and will deny seeing the word\"Key.\" However, if asked to point with the left hand, the mental system of theright hemisphere will correctly point to the word \"Key.\"Therefore, given events \"A\" and \"B\" one half of the brain may know A, but knownothing about B which is known only by the other half of the brain. Inconsequence, what is known vs what is not known becomes relatively imprecisedepending on what aspects of reality are perceived and \"known\" by which mentalsystem (Joseph 1986a; Joseph et al., 1984). There is no such thing assingularity of mind. Since the brain and mind is a multiplicity, \"A\" and \"B\" canbe known simultaneously, even when one mind is knows nothing about the existenceof A or B.In that the brain of the normal as well as the \"split-brain\" patient maintainsthe neuroanatomy to support a multiplicity of mind, and the presence of twodominant psychic realms, it is therefore not surprising that \"normal\" humansoften have difficulty \"making up their minds,\" suffer internal conflicts overlove/hate relationships, and are plagued with indecision even when staring intoan open refrigerator and trying to decide what to eat. \"Making up one's mind\"can be an ordeal involving a multiplicity of minds. However, this conflictbecomes even more apparent following split-brain surgery and the cutting of thecorpus callosum fiber pathway which links these two parallel streams ofconscious-awareness.Akelaitis (1945, p. 597) describes two patients with complete corpuscallosotomies who experienced extreme difficulties making the two halves oftheir bodies cooperate. \"In tasks requiring bimanual activity the left handwould frequently perform oppositely to what she desired to do with the righthand. For example, she would be putting on clothes with her right and pullingthem off with her left, opening a door or drawer with her right hand andsimultaneously pushing it shut with the left. These uncontrollable acts made herincreasingly irritated and depressed.\"Another patient experienced difficulty while shopping, the right hand wouldplace something in the cart and the left hand would put it right back again andgrab a different item.A recently divorced male patient complained that on several occasions whilewalking about town he found himself forced to go some distance in anotherdirection by his left leg. Later (although his left hemisphere was not consciousof it at the time) it was discovered that this diverted course, if continued,would have led him to his former wife's new home.Geschwind (1981) reports a callosal patient who complained that his left hand onseveral occasions suddenly struck his wife--much to the embarrassment of hisleft (speaking) hemisphere. In another case, a patient's left hand attempted tochoke the patient himself and had to be wrestled away.Bogen (1979, p. 333) indicates that almost all of his \"complete commissurotomypatients manifested some degree of intermanual conflict.\" One patient, Rocky,experienced situations in which his hands were uncooperative; the right wouldbutton up a shirt and the left would follow right behind and undo the buttons.For years, he complained of difficulty getting his left leg to go in thedirection he (or rather his left hemisphere) desired. Another patient oftenreferred to the left half of her body as \"my little sister\" when she wascomplaining of its peculiar and independent actions.Another split-brain patient reported that once when she had overslept her lefthand began slapping her face until she (i.e. her left hemisphere) woke up. Thissame patient, in fact, complained of several instances where her left hand hadacted violently toward herself and other people (Joseph, 1988a).Split brain patient, 2-C, complained of instances in which his left hand wouldperform socially inappropriate actions, such as striking his mother across theface (Joseph, 1988b). Apparently his left and right hemisphere also likeddifferent TV programs. He complained of numerous instances where he (his lefthemisphere) was enjoying a program, when, to his astonishment, the left half ofhis body pulled him to the TV, and changed the channel.The right and left hemisphere also liked different foods and had differentattitudes about exercise. Once, after 2-C had retrieved something from therefrigerator with his right hand, his left took the food, put it back on theshelf and retrieved a completely different item \"Even though that's not what Iwanted to eat!\" On at least one occasion, his left leg refused to continue\"going for a walk\" and would only allow him to return home.In the laboratory, 2-C's left hemisphere often became quite angry with his lefthand, and he struck it and expressed hate for it. Several times, his left andright hands were observed to engage in actual physical struggles, beating uponeach other. For example, on one task both hands were stimulated simultaneously(while out of view) with either the same or two different textured materials(e.g., sandpaper to the right, velvet to the left), and he was required to point(with the left and right hands simultaneously) to an array of fabrics that werehanging in view on the left and right of the testing apparatus. However, at notime was he informed that two different fabrics were being applied.After stimulation he would pull his hands out from inside the apparatus andpoint with the left to the fabric felt by the left and with the right to thefabric felt by the right.Surprisingly, although his left hand (right hemisphere) responded correctly, hisleft hemisphere vocalized: \"Thats wrong!\" Repeatedly he reached over with hisright hand and tried to force his left extremity to point to the fabricexperienced by the right (although the left hand responded correctly! His lefthemisphere didn't know this, however). His left hand refused to be moved andphysically resisted being forced to point at anything different. In one instancea physical struggle ensued, the right grappling with the left with the twohalves of the body hitting and scratching at each other!Moreover, while 2-C was performing this (and other tasks), his left hemispheremade statements such as: \"I hate this hand\" or \"This is so frustrating\" andwould strike his left hand with his right or punch his left arm. In theseinstances there could be little doubt that his right hemisphere mental systemwas behaving with purposeful intent and understanding, whereas his lefthemisphere mental system had absolutely no comprehension of why his left hand(right hemisphere) was behaving in this manner (Joseph, 1988b).These conflicts are not limited to behavior, TV programs, choice of clothing, orfood, but to actual feelings, including love and romance. For example, the rightand left hemisphere of a male split-brain patient had completely differentfeelings about an ex-girlfriend. When he was asked if he wanted to see heragain, he said \"Yes.\" But at the same time, his left hand turned thumbs down!Another split-brain patient suffered conflicts about his desire to smoke.Although is left hemisphere mental system enjoyed cigarettes, his left handwould not allow him to smoke, and would pluck lit cigarettes from his mouth orright hand and put them out. He had been trying to quit for years.Because each head contains multiple minds, similar conflicts also plague thosewho have not undergone split-brain surgery. Each half of the brain and thus eachmental system may have different attitudes, goals and interests. As noted above,2-C experienced conflicts when attempting to eat, watch TV, or go for walks, hisright and left hemisphere mental systems apparently enjoying different TVprograms or types of food (Joseph 1988b). Conflicts of a similar nature plagueus all. Split-brain patients are not the first to choke on self-hate or to harmor hate those they profess to love.Each half of the brain is concerned with different types of information, and mayreact, interpret and process the same external experience differently and evenreach different conclusions (Joseph 1988a,b; Sperry, 1966). Moreover, even whenthe goals are the same, the two halves of the brain may produce and attempt toact on different strategies.Each mental system has its own reality. Singularity of mind, is an illusion. 9. Dissociation and Self-ConsciousnessThe multiplicity of mind is not limited to the neocortex but includes oldcortical structures, such as the limbic system (Joseph 1992). Moreover, limbicnuclei such as the amygdala and hippocampus interact with neocortical tissuescreating yet additional mental systems, such as those which rely on memory andwhich contribute to self-reflection, personal identity, and evenself-consciousness (Joseph, 1992, 1998, 1999b, 2001).[images/00055.jpg][images/00056.jpg]For example, both the amygdala and the hippocampus are implicated in the storageof long term memories, and both nuclei enable individuals to visualize andremember themselves engaged in various acts, as if viewing their behavior andactions from afar. Thus, you might see yourself and remember yourself engage insome activity, from a perspective outside yourself, as if you are an externalwitness; and this is a common feature of selfreflection and self-memory and ismade possible by the hippocampus and overlying temporal lobe (Joseph, 1996,2001).The hippocampus in fact contains \"place neurons\" which cognitive map one'sposition and the location of various objects within the environment (Nadel,1991; O'Keefe, 1976; Wilson & McNaughton, 1993). Further, if the subject movesabout in that environment, entire populations of these place cells will fire.Moreover, some cells are responsive to the movements of other people in thatenvironment and will fire as that person is observed to move around to differentlocations or corners of the room (Nadel, 1991; O'Keefe, 1976; Wilson andMcNaughton, 1993).Electrode stimulation, or other forms of heightened activity within thehippocampus and overlying temporal lobe can also cause a person to seethemselves, in real time, as if their conscious mind is floating on the ceilingstaring down at their body (Joseph, 1998, 1999b, 2001). During the course ofelectrode stimulation and seizure activity originating in the temporal lobe orhippocampus, patients may report that they have left their bodies and arehovering upon the ceiling staring down at themselves (Daly, 1958; Penfield,1952; Penfield & Perot 1963; Williams, 1956). That is, their consciousness andsense of personal identity appears to split off from their body, such that theyexperience themselves as as a consciousness that is conscious of itself as aconscious that is detached from the body which is being observed.One female patient claimed that she not only would float above her body, butwould sometimes drift outside and even enter into the homes of her neighbors.Penfield and Perot (1963) describe several patients who during a temporal lobeseizure, or neurosurgical temporal lobe stimulation, claimed they split-off fromtheir body and could see themselves down below. One woman stated: \"it was thoughI were two persons, one watching, and the other having this happen to me.\"According to Penfield (1952), \"it was as though the patient were attending afamiliar play and was both the actor and audience.\"Under conditions of extreme trauma, stress and fear, the amygdala, hippocampusand temporal lobe become exceedingly active (Joseph, 1998, 1999b). Under theseconditions many will experience a \"splitting of consciousness\" and have thesensation they have left their body and are hovering beside or above themselves,or even that they floated away (Courtois, 2009; Grinker & Spiegel, 1945; Noyes &Kletti, 1977; van der Kolk 1987). That is, out-of-body dissociative experiencesappear to be due to fear induced hippocampus (and amygdala) hyperactivation.Likewise, during episodes of severe traumatic stress personal consciousness maybe fragmented and patients may dissociate and experience themselves as splittingoff and floating away from their body, passively observing all that is occurring(Courtois, 1995; Grinker & Spiegel, 1945; Joseph, 1999d; Noyes & Kletti, 1977;Southard, 1919; Summit, 1983; van der Kolk 1987).Noyes and Kletti (1977) described several individuals who experienced terror,believed they were about to die, and then suffered an out-of body dissociativeexperience: \"I had a clear image of myself... as though watching it on atelevision screen.\" \"The next thing I knew I wasn't in the truck anymore; I waslooking down from 50 to 100 feet in the air.\" \"I had a sensation of floating. Itwas almost like stepping out of reality. I seemed to step out of this world.\"One individual, after losing control of his Mustang convertible while duringover 100 miles per hour on a rain soaked freeway, reported that \"time seemed toslow down and then... part of my mind was a few feet outside the car zoomingabove it and then beside it and behind it and in front of it, looking at andanalyzing the respective positions of my spinning Mustang and the carssurrounding me. Simultaneously I was inside trying to steer and control it inaccordance with the multiple perspectives I was given by that part of my mindthat was outside. It was like my mind split and one consciousness was inside thecar, while the other was zooming all around outside and giving me visualfeedback that enabled me to avoid hitting anyone or destroying my Mustang.\"Numerous individuals from adults to children, from those born blind and deaf,have also reported experiencing a dissociative consciousness after profoundinjury causing near death (Eadie 1992; Rawling 1978; Ring 1980). Consider forexample, the case of Army Specialist J. C. Bayne of the 196th Light InfantryBrigade. Bayne was \"killed\" in Chu Lai, Vietnam, in 1966, after beingsimultaneously machine gunned and struck by a mortar. According to Bayne, whenhe opened his eyes he was floating in the air, looking down on his burnt andbloody body: \"I could see me... it was like looking at a manikin laying there...I was burnt up and there was blood all over the place... I could see theVietcong. I could see the guy pull my boots off. I could see the rest of thempicking up various things... I was like a spectator... It was about four or fivein the afternoon when our own troops came. I could hear and see themapproaching... I looked dead... they put me in a bag... transferred me to atruck and then to the morgue. And from that point, it was the embalming process.I was on that table and a guy was telling jokes about those USO girls... all Ihad on was bloody undershorts... he placed my leg out and made a slight incisionand stopped... he checked my pulse and heartbeat again and I could see thattoo... It was about that point I just lost track of what was taking place....[until much later] when the chaplain was in there saying everything was going tobe all right.... I was no longer outside. I was part of it at this point\"(reported in Wilson, 1987, pp 113-114; and Sabom, 1982, pp 81-82).Therefore, be it secondary to the fear of dying, or depth electrode stimulation,these experiences all appear to be due to a mental system which enables a theconscious mind to detach completely from the body in order to make the body anobject of consciousness (Joseph, 1998, 1999b, 2001).10. Quantum ConsciousnessIt could be said that consciousness is consciousness of something other thanconsciousness. Consciousness and knowledge of an object, such as a chair, arealso distinct. Consciousness is not the chair. The chair is not consciousness.The chair is an object of consciousness, and thus become discontinuous from thequantum state.Consciousness is consciousness of something and is conscious of not being thatobject that is is conscious of. By knowing what it isn't, consciousness may knowwhat it is not, which helps define what it is. This consciousness of not beingthe object can be considered the \"collapse function\" which results indiscontinuity within the continuuum.Further, it could be said that consciousness of consciousness, that is,self-consciousness, also imparts a duality, a separation, into the fabric of thequantum continuum. Therefore this consciousness that is the object ofconsciousness, becomes an abstraction, and may create a collapse function in thecontinuun.However, in instances of dissociation, this consciousness is conscious of itselfas a consciousness that is floating above its body; a body which contains thebrain. The dissociative consciousness is not dissociated from itself as aconsciousness, but only from its body. That is, there is an awareness of itselfas a consciousness that is floating above the body, and this awareness issimultaneously one with that consciousness, as there is no separation, noabstractions, and no objectification. It is a singularity that is without form,without dimension, without shape.Moreover, because this dissociated consciousness appears to be continuous withitself, there is no \"collapse function\" except in regard to the body which isviewed as an object of perception.Therefore, in these instances we can not say that consciousness has split into aduality of observer and observed or knower and known, except in regard to thebody. Dissociated consciousness is conscious of itself as consciousness; it isself-aware without separation and without reflecting. It is knowing and known,simultaneously.In fact, many patients report that in the dissociated state they achieve ornearly achieved a state of pure knowing (Joseph, 1996, 2001).A patient described by Williams (1956) claimed she was lifted up out of herbody, and experienced a very pleasant sensation of elation and the feeling thatshe was \"just about to find out knowledge no one else shares, something to dowith the link between life and death.\" Another patient reported that uponleaving her body she not only saw herself down below, but was taken to a specialplace \"of vast proportions, and I felt as if I was in another world\" (Williams,1956).Other patients suffering from temporal lobe seizures or upon direct electricalactivation have noted that things suddenly became \"crystal clear\" or that theyhad a feeling of clairvoyance, of having the ultimate truth revealed to them, ofhaving achieved a sense of greater awareness and cosmic clarity such thatsounds, smells and visual objects seemed to have a greater meaning andsensibility, and that they were achieving a cosmic awareness of the hiddenknowledge of all things (Joseph, 1996, 2001).Although consciousness and the object of consciousness, that which is known, arenot traditionally thought of as being one and the same, in dissociative states,consciousness and knowing, may become one and the same. The suggestion is ofsome type of cosmic unity, particularly as these patients also often report aprogressive loss of the sense of individuality, as if they are merging intosomething greater than themselves, including a becoming one with all theknowledge of the universe; a singularity with god.Commonly those who experience traumatic dissociative conscious states, not onlyfloat above the body, but report that they gradually felt they were losing allsense of individuality as they became embraced by a brilliant magnificentwhiteness that extended out in all directions into eternity.Therefore, rather than the dissociated consciousness acting outside the quantumstate, it appears this mental state may represent an increasing submersion backinto the continuity that is the quantum state, disappearing back into thecontinuum of singularity and oneness that is the quantum universe.Dissociated consciousness may be but the last preamble before achieving theunity that is quantum consciousness, the unity of all things. 11. Conclusion: Quantum Consciousness and the Multiplicity of MindWhat is “Objective Reality” when the mind is a multiplicity which is capable ofsplitting up, observing itself, becoming blind to itself, and becoming blind tothe features of the world which then cease to exist for the remaining mentalrealms?Each mental system has its own \"reality.\" Each observer is a multiplicity thatengages in numerous simultaneous acts of observation. Therefore, non-localproperties which do not have an objective existence independent of the “act ofobservation” by one mental system, may achieve existence when observed byanother mental system. The \"known\" and the \"unknown\" can exist simultaneouslyand interchangeably and this may explain why we don’t experience any macroscopicnon-local quantum weirdness in our daily lives.This means that quantum laws may apply to everything, from atoms to monkeys andwoman and man and the multiplicity of mind. However, because of thismultiplicity, this could lead to seemingly contradictory predictions anduncertainty when measuring macroscopically objective systems which aresuperimposed on microscopic quantum systems. Indeed, this same principle appliesto the multiplicity of mind, where dominant parallel streams of consciousawareness may be superimposed on other mental systems, and which may be beset byuncertainty.Because of the multiplicity of mind, as exemplified by dissociative states, theobserver can also be observed, and thus, the observer is not really external tothe quantum state as is required by the standard collapse formulation of quantummechanics. This raises the possibility that the collapse formulation can be usedto describe the universe as a whole which includes observers observingthemselves being observed.The multiplicity of mind also explains why an object being measured by onemental system therefore becomes bundled up into a state where it eitherdeterminately has or determinately does not have the property being measured.Measurements performed by one mental system are not being performed by others,such that the same object can have an initial state and a post-measurement stateand a final state simultaneously as represented in multiple minds in parallel,or separate states as represented by each mental realm individually.The collapse dynamics of observation supposedly guarantees that a system willeither determinately have or determinately not have a particular property.However, because the observer is observing with multiple mental systems theobject can both have and not have specific properties when it is being measureand not measured, simply because it is being measured and not measured, orrather, observed and not observed or its different features observedsimultaneously by multiple mental systems. Therefore, it can be continuous anddiscontinuous in parallel, and different properties can be known and not knownin parallel simultaneously.And the same rules apply to the mental systems which exist in multiplicitywithin the head of a single observer. Mental systems can become continuous ordiscontinuous, and can be known and not known simultaneously, in parallel. Thus,the standard collapse formulation can be used to describe systems that containobservers, as the mind/observer can be simultaneously internal and external tothe described system.The mind is a multiplicity and there is no such thing as a \"single observerstate.\" Therefore, each element may be observed by multiple observer stateswhich perceive multiple object systems thereby giving the illusion that theobject has been transformed during the collapse function. What this also impliesis that contrary to the standard or Copenhagen interpretations, states may haveboth definite position and definite momentum at the same time.Each mental system perceives a different physical world giving rise to multipleworlds and multiple realities which may be subordinated by one or another moredominant stream of conscious awareness.Moreover, as the multiplicity of mind can also detach and become discontinuouswith the body, whereas dissociative consciousness is continuous with itself,this indicates that the mind is also capable of becoming one with the continuum,and can achieve singularity so that universe and mind become one.ReferencesAkelaitis, A.

Lebedev Physical Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences, Leninsky prosp.53, 119991 Moscow,AbstractThe phenomenon of consciousness, including its mystical features, is explainedon the basis of quantum mechanics in the Everett's form. Everett'sinterpretation (EI) of quantum mechanics is in fact the only one that correctlydescribes quantum reality: any state of the quantum world is objectively asuperposition of its classical counterparts, or \"classical projections\". Theyare \"classically incompatible\", but are considered to be equally real, orcoexisting. We shall call them alternative classical realities or simplyclassical alternatives. According to the Everett's interpretation, quantumreality is presented by the whole set of alternative classical realities(alternatives). However, these alternatives are perceived by humans separately,independently from each other, resulting in the subjective illusion that only asingle classical alternative exists. The ability to separate the classicalalternatives is the main feature of what is called consciousness. According tothe author's Extended Everett's Concept (EEC), this feature is taken to be adefinition of consciousness (more precisely, consciousness as such, not as thecomplex of processes in the conscious state of mind). It immediately followsfrom this definition that turning the consciousness off (in sleeping, trance ormeditation) allows one to acquire access to all alternatives. The resultinginformation gives rise to unexpected insights including scientific insights.KEY WORDS: Quantum mechanics; quantum reality; Everett's interpretation;consciousness; unconscious; insights; miracles; probability 1 INTRODUCTIONStrange as this may seem, we do not know what is the nature ofconsciousness,especially of the very strange features of consciousness which resemble mysticalphenomena. The most familiar examples of these mysterious phenomena arescientific insights (of course, we mean only \"great insights\" experienced bygreat scientists). Some people supposed that the mystery of consciousness may bepuzzled out on the basis of quantum mechanics, the science which is mysteriousitself.This viewpoint has been suggested, as early as in 20th years of 20th century, bythe great physicist Wolfgang Pauli in collaboration with the great psychologistCarl Gustav Jung. They supposed particularly that quantum mechanics may help toexplain strange psychic phenomena observed by Jung and called \"synchronisms\".Jung told of a synchronism if a series of the events happened such that theseevents were conceptually close but their simultaneous (synchronous) emergencecould not be justified causally. For example he observed causally unjustified,seemingly accidental, appearance of the image of fish six times during a singleday. The work of Pauli and Jung on this topic was not properly published and waslater completely forgotten, but it became popular in last decades (see aboutthis in Enz, 2009).The idea of connecting consciousness with quantum mechanics was suggested bysome other authors, mostly without referring Pauli and Jung. In the last threedecades this idea was supported by Roger Penrose (Penrose, 1991), (Penrose,1994). He particularly remarked that people manage to solve such problems whichin principle cannot be solved with the help of computers because no algorithmsexist for their solving. Penrose suggested that quantum phenomena should beessential for explaining the work of brain and consciousness.Usually attempts to explain consciousness on the base of quantum mechanicsfollow the line of consideration that is natural for physicists. Everything mustbe explained by natural sciences, may be with accounting quantum laws.Therefore, in order to explain consciousness, one has to apply quantum mechanicsfor analysis of the work of brain. For example, the work of brain may beexplained as the work of quantum computer instead of classical one. Thus, it isusually assumed, explicitly or implicitly, that consciousness must be derivedfrom the analysis of the processes in brain.The approach proposed by the author in 2000 does not include this assumption.This approach is based on the analysis of the logical structure of quantummechanics, and the phenomenon of consciousness is derived from this purelylogical analysis rater than from the processes in brain. The actual origin ofthe concept of consciousness is, according to this approach, specific featuresof the concept of reality accepted in quantum mechanics (contrary to classicalphysics) and often called quantum reality.Quantum reality has its adequate presentation in the so-called Everett'sinterpretation (EI) of quantum mechanics known also under name of many-worldsinterpretation (Everett III, 1957). The approach of the author is based on theEverett's form of quantum mechanics and called Extended Everett's Concept (EEC).Some physicists, having in mind purely classical concept of reality, considerthe Everett's interpretation of quantum mechanics too complicated and \"exotic\".However, it is now experimentally proved that reality in our world is quantum,and the conclusions based on classical concept of reality, are not reliable. Thecomprehension of the concept of quantum reality was achieved after longintellectual efforts of genius scientists. Unfortunately, the ideas of Pauli andJung were not properly estimated and timely used. The first whose thoughts aboutquantum reality became widely know was Einstein who, in the work with hiscoauthors, suggested so-called Einstein-Podolski-Rosen paradox (Einstein et al.,1935). Much later John Bell formulated now widely known Bell's theorem (Bell,1964), (Bell, 1987) which provided an adequate tool for directquantum-mechanical verification of the concept of quantum reality, the Bell'sinequality. Less than in 20 years the group of Aspect experimentally proved(Aspect et al., 1981) that the Bell's inequality is violated in some quantumprocesses, and therefore reality in our world is quantum.Most simple and convenient formulation of quantum reality was given even earlierthat the Bell's works, in 1957, by the Everett's interpretation of quantummechanics. It was enthusiastically accepted by the great physicists JohnArchibald Wheeler and Brice Dewitt, but was not recognized by the wide physicalcommunity until last decades of 20th century, when the correspondingintellectual base was already prepared. From this time the number of adepts ofthe Everett's interpretation grows permanently. Results of this difficult butvery important process of conceptual clarification of quantum mechanics justifythe appreciation of the Everett's interpretation as the only correct form ofquantum mechanics. It is exciting that, as an additional prize, the Everett'sinterpretation explains the mysterious phenomenon of consciousness.Quantum mechanics in the Everett's form implies coexisting \"parallel worlds\", orparallel classical realities. This clearly expresses the difference of quantumreality from the common classical reality. According to the author's ExtendedEverett's Concept (Menskii, 2000), consciousness is the ability to perceive theEverett's parallel worlds separately, independently from each other. Animmediate consequence of this assumption is that the state of being unconsciousmakes all parallel realities available without the separation. This leads toirrational insights and other \"mystical\" phenomena. This is the central point ofthe theory making it plausible. Indeed, it is well known (from all spiritualschools and from deep psychological researches) that the strange abilities ofconsciousness arise just in the states of mind that are close to beingunconsciousness (sleeping, trance or meditation).2 PARALLEL WORLDSAccording to the Everett's \"many-worlds\" interpretation of quantum mechanics,quantum mechanics implies coexistence of \"parallel classical worlds\", oralternative classical realities. This follows from the arguments (see detailsbelow) including the following points:• The very important specific feature of quantum systems is that their statesare vectors. This means that a state of any quantum system may be a sum (calledalso superposition) of other states of the same system. All the states which arethe counterparts of this sum, are equally real, i.e. they may be said tocoexist. This is experimentally proved for the states of microscopic systems(such as elementary particles or atoms).• However, this should be valid also for macroscopic systems (consisting of manyatoms). It follows from the logical analysis of the measurements of microscopicsystems. Indeed, let a microscopic system S be measured with the help of amacroscopic measuring device M. If the state of S is a sum of a series ofstates, then, after the measurement, the state of the combined system (S and M)is also a sum (each its term consisting of a state of S and the correspondingstate of M).• Different states of the measuring device, by the very definition of ameasuring device, have to be macroscopically distinct. Therefore, a macroscopicsystem may be in the state which is a sum (superposition) consisting of thestates which are incompatible (alternative to each other) from the point of viewof classical physics. However, quantum mechanics requires them to \"coexist\" (inthe form of a sum, or superposition).• Therefore, classically incompatible states of our world (alternative classicalrealities) must coexist as a sort of \"parallel worlds\" which are calledEverett's worlds. Let us now give some details of these arguments. What does it mean that thestates of a quantum system are vectors? If vpi are states of some quantumsystem, then ψ = ψ1 + ψ2 + • • • is also a state of the same system, called asuperposition of the states ψi (counterparts of the superposition).This feature is experimentally proved for microscopic systems (such aselementary particles or atoms), but it has to be valid also for macroscopicsystems. This follows from the analysis of measurements with microscopicmeasured systems and macroscopic measuring devices.The conclusion following from this analysis is that, even for a macroscopicsystem, its state ψ may be a superposition of other states of this system, whichhave evident classical interpretation (are close to some classical states of thesystem) while the state ψ has no such an interpretation:ψ = ψ1 + ψ2 +...+ ψn... (1)It is important that the states ψ here may be macroscopically distinct,therefore, from classical point of view incompatible, alternative to each other,presenting alternative classical realities. Nevertheless, it follows fromquantum theory that even such macroscopically distinct states ψi may be insuperposition, i.e. may coexist. Let usformulate the above situation a little bit more precisely. The quantum system isin the state denoted by the state vector and only this state objectively exists(however, taken as a whole, has no classical interpretation). The counterparts ^of the superposition are in fact classical projections of the objectivelyexisting quantum state ψ. These classical projections describe images of thequantum system which arise in consciousness of an observer (therefore, theyconcern the subjective aspect of quantum reality). This status of the classicalprojections will be made more transparent below.In the following we shall use ψ for the state of our (quantum) world as a whole.The components ψi of the superposition will be alternative classical states ofthis world (more precisely, quasiclassical, i.e. the states as close toclassical as is possible for the quantum world).In the Everett's interpretation of quantum mechanics the states ψ are calledEverett's worlds. We shall use also the terms \"parallel worlds\", \"alternativeclassical realities\", \"classical alternatives\" or simply \"alternatives\". In caseif such alternatives are superposed (as in Eq. (1)), we shall say that they\"coexist\". Of course this word is nothing else than a convenient slang, meaningin fact \"to form a superposition\" or \"to be in superposition\". The status of the\"coexistence\" is connected with the consciousness and subjective perception ofthe world, which will be explained below.3 EXTENDED EVERETT'S CONCEPT (EEC)We see that the alternative classical realities in our quantum world may coexist(as components of a superposition presenting the state of the quantum world).Subjectively however each observer perceives only a single \"classicalalternative\". These two assertions seem to contradict to each other. Are they infact compatible? We shall show how this seeming contradiction is resolved in theEverett's interpretation (EI) and how it may be taken as a basis for the theoryof consciousness and the unconscious if the EI is properly extended.3.1 Everett's \"Many-Worlds\" Interpretation One may naively think that thepicture of the world arising in his consciousness (the picture of a singleclassical alternative) is just what objectively exists. However, EI of quantummechanics (unavoidably following from the logics of quantum mechanics applied tothe phenomenon of quantum measurements) claims that it is only the superpositionof all alternatives (as in Eq. (1)) that objectively exists.The seemingly strange and counter-intuitive presentation of objective reality(in the Everett's form of quantum mechanics) as the set of many objectivelycoexisting classical realities adequately expresses quantum character of realityin our (quantum) world.The single alternatives (components of the superposition) present varioussubjective perceptions of this quantum reality in an observer's consciousness.The natural question arises how the multiplicity of the \"classical pictures\"that may arise in our consciousness may be compatible with the subjectivesensory evidence of only a single such picture.This is the most difficult point of the EI and the reason why thisinterpretation has not been readily accepted by the physicists. This point maybe made more transparent if it is presented in the terms of \"Everett's worlds\"as it has been suggested by Brice DeWitt.Thus, all of the separate components of the superposition (classicalalternatives, or Everett's worlds) are declared by Everett to be \"equally real\".No single alternative may be considered to be the only real, while the othersbeing potentially possible but not actualized variants of reality (this might beaccepted in classical physics, but not in quantum mechanics, because of thespecial character of quantum reality).To make understanding of the EI easier, Brice DeWitt proposed (De-Witt & Graham,1973) to think that each observer is present in each of the Everett's worlds. Tomake this even more transparent, one may think that a sort of twins (\"clones\")of each observer are present in all Everett's worlds. Subjective perception isthe perception of a single twin. Objectively the twins of the given observerexist in all Everett's worlds, each of them perceiving corresponding alternativepictures.Each of us subjectively perceives around him a single classical reality.However, objectively the twins, or clones, of each of us perceive all the restrealities. It is important that all twins of the given observer are equallyreal. It is incorrect to say that there is \"I\" and there are my twins, which arenot \"I\". All twins embody me as an observer, each of them can be called \"I\".Thus, the concept of \"Everett's world\" allows to make the Everett's presentationof quantum reality more transparent. We prefer to verbalize the same situationin another way (Menskii, 2000). We shall say that all alternative classicalprojections of the quantum world's state objectively exist, but theseprojections are separated in consciousness. Subjective perception of the quantumworld by human's consciousness embraces all these classical pictures, but eachpicture is perceived independently of the rest.Regardless of the way of wording, the Everett's assumption of objectivelycoexisting classical alternatives implies that all these alternatives may beaccessible for an observer in some way or another. Yet it is not clear how theaccess to \"other alternatives\" (different from one subjectively perceived) maybe achieved for the given observer. It is usually claimed that the EI does notallow observing \"other alternatives\". This makes the interpretationnon-falsifiable and thus decreases its value.It turns out however that the EI may be improved in such a way that that thequestion \"How one can access to other alternatives?\" is answered in a verysimple and natural way. This improvement is realized in the author's ExtendedEverett's Concept. The (improved) EI becomes then falsifiable, although in aspecial sense of the word (see below Sect. 3.2).3.2 Extension of the Everett's Interpretation Starting with the above mentionedformulation (that classical alternatives are separated in consciousness), thepresent author proposed (Menskii, 2000) to accept a stronger statement:consciousness is nothing else than separation of the alternatives.This seemingly very small step resulted in important consequences. Finally theso-called Extended Everett's Concept (EEC) has been developed (Menskii, 2005),(Menskii, 2007), (Mensky, 2005, 2007, 2010). The first advantage of EEC is that the logical structure of the quantum theoryis simplified as compared with the EI.The point is that the formulation \"alternatives are separated in consciousness\"(accepted in one of the possible formulations of EI) includes two primary (notdefinable) concepts, \"consciousness\" and \"alternative separation\". Theseconcepts have no good definitions. One may object that many differentdefinitions have been proposed for the notion \"consciousness\". This is right,but all these definitions concern in fact mental and sensual processes in brainrather than \"consciousness as such\", while the latter (more fundamental) notionhas no good definition.After the notions \"consciousness\" (more precisely, \"consciousness as such\") and\"separation of alternatives\" are identified (as it is suggested in EEC), onlyone of these concepts remains in the theory. Therefore, EEC includes only oneprimary concept instead of two such concepts in the EI. The logical structure ofthe theory is simplified after its extension.Much more important is that EEC gives a transparent indication as to how anobserver may obtain access to \"other alternatives\" (different from thealternative subjectively perceived by him). This very important question remainsunanswered (or answered negatively) in the original form of the EI. This is seenfrom the following argument.If consciousness = separation (of the alternatives from each other), thenabsence of consciousness = absence of separation.Therefore, turning off consciousness (in sleeping, trance or meditation) opensaccess to all classical alternatives put together, without separation betweenthem. Of course, the access is realized then not in the form of visual, acousticor other conscious images or thoughts. Nothing at all can be said about the formof this access. However, if we accept EEC, then we may definitely conclude thatthe access is possible in the unconscious state of mind.This of course has very important consequences. The access to the enormous \"database\" consisting of all alternative classical realities enables one to acquirevaluable information, or rather knowledge. This information is unique in thesense that it is unavailable in the conscious state when only a singlealternative is subjectively accessible. One may suppose that a part of thisunique information may be kept on returning to the usual conscious state of mindand recognized in the form of usual conscious images and thoughts.Thus, when going over to the unconscious state, one obtains the information, orknowledge, which is in principle unavailable in the usual conscious state.This information is unique first of all because it is taken from \"other\"classical alternatives (different from one subjectively observed). There ishowever something more that makes this information unique and highly valuable.All alternatives together form a representation of the quantum state of theworld (vector ^ in Eq. (1)). Time evolution of this state vector, according toquantum laws, is reversible. This means that, given at some time moment, thisvector is known also at all other times. Therefore, information about \"allalternatives together\" (i.e. about the state vector of the world) includesinformation from any time moments in future and past. This information may bethought of as being obtained with the help of a \"virtual time machine\".Evidently, this makes \"irrational\" inspirations (including scientific insights)possible. Here is a simple example. Let a scientist be confronted with ascientific problem and consider a number of hypotheses for solving this problem.Going, by means of the above mentioned virtual time machine, into future andbackward, the scientist may find out what of these hypotheses will be confirmedby future experiments or proved with the help of the future theories. Then, onreturning to the conscious state, he will unexpectedly and without any rationalgrounds get certain about which of these hypotheses has to be chosen.Remark that it is not necessary, for making use of such a virtual time machine,to turn off consciousness completely (although it is known that some importantdiscoveries were made in sleeping, or rather after awakening). It is enough todisconnect it from the problem under consideration. This is why solutions ofhard problems are sometimes found not during the work on these problems butrather during relaxation.Preliminary \"rational\" work on the problem is however necessary. The deepinvestigation of all data concerning the problem enables the consciousness toform a sort of query (clear formulation of the problem and its connections withall relevant areas of knowledge). Then the query will be worked out in theunconscious state (during relaxation) and will result in an unexpected insight.It is clear that not only scientific problems can be solved in this way, butalso problems of general character. Quite probable that, besides ordinaryintuitive guesses, we meet in our experience examples of super-intuitiveinsights of the type described above. Anybody knows that many efficientsolutions come in the morning just after awakening. This fact may be an indirectconfirmation of the ability of super-intuition.4 PROBABILISTIC MIRACLESThus, Extended Everett's Concept (EEC) leads to the conclusion that unconsciousstate of mind allows one to take information \"from other alternatives\" thatreveals itself as unexpected insights, or direct vision of truth.Another consequence is feasibility of even more weird phenomenon looking asarbitrary choice ofreality. Let us describe this ability in a special case ofwhat can be called \"probabilistic miracles\".Consider an observer who subjectively perceives one of the alternative classicalrealities at the present time moment t0. Let in a certain future moment t > t0some event E may happen, but with a very small probability p. Call it theobjective probability of the event E and suppose that this probability is small.According to the Everett's interpretation of quantum mechanics, at time t twoclasses of alternative classical realities will exist so that the event Ehappens in each alternative of the first class and does not happen in thealternatives of the second class. The twins of our observer will be objectivelypresent in each of the alternatives (this is the feature of Everett's worlds,see Sect. 3.1). However, subjectively our observer will feel to be in one ofthem. With some probability p it will turn out to be the alternative of thefirst class. The probability p may be called subjective probability of the eventE for the given observer.It is accepted in the Everett's interpretation that subjective and objectiveprobabilities coincide, p = p. However, in the context of EEC we may assume thatthey may differ and, moreover, the observer may influence the value ofsubjective probability p'. Let us assume that the observer prefers the event Eto happen. Then he can enlarge the subjective probability of this event, i.e.the probability to find himself subjectively at time t just in that classicalreality in which this rare event actually happens.Thus, besides the objective probability of any event, there is a subjectiveprobability of this event for the given observer, and the observer may inprinciple influence the subjective probability. In the above mentionedsituation, an event under consideration can happen according to usual laws ofthe natural sciences, but with small probability. This means that the objectiveprobability of this event is small, it may seem even negligible. It is importantthat the objective probability is non-zero. One may say that among allalternatives at the moment t few of the alternatives correspond to the picturesof the world in which the event happens, and much more alternatives correspondto the pictures of the world where the event does not happen.However, according to EEC, an observer can, simply by the force of hisconsciousness, make the subjective probability of this event close to unity.Then very likely he will find himself at the moment t in one of those classicalrealities where the event does happen.The subjective experience of such an observer will evidence that the objectivelyimprobable event may be realized by the effort of his will. This looks like amiracle. However, this is a miracle of a special type, which may be called\"probabilistic miracle\".Probabilistic miracles essentially differ from \"absolute\" miracles that happenin fairy tales. The difference is that the event realized as a probabilisticmiracle (i.e. \"by the force of consciousness\") may in principle happen in aquite natural way, although with a very small probability. This small butnonzero probability is very important. Particularly, because of fundamentalcharacter of probabilistic predictions in quantum mechanics, it is in principleimpossible to prove or disprove the unnatural (miraculous) character of thehappening.Indeed, if the objectively rare event happens, the person who has stronglydesired for it to happen is inclined to consider the happening as a result ofhis will. Yet any skeptic may insist in this situation that the event occurredin a quite natural way: what happened, was only a rare coincidence. The secretis in the nature of the concept of probability: if the probability of somestochastic event is equal p, then in a long series consisting of N tests theevent will happen pN times (very rarely for small p). But it is in principleimpossible to predict in which of these tests the event will happen.Particularly, it may happen even in the very first test from the long series ofthem.The latter is a very interesting and general feature of the phenomena \"in thearea of consciousness\" as they are treated in EEC. These phenomena in principlecannot be unambiguously assigned to the sphere of natural events (obeying thelaws of natural sciences) or to the sphere of spiritual or psychic phenomena(which are treated by the humanities and spiritual doctrines). Impossibility todo this may be called relativity of objectiveness.Synchronisms studied by Jung may be considered to be probabilistic miracles. Onewho observes a subject or event which somehow attracts his special attention,involuntarily thinks about it (often even not clearly fixing his thoughts).According to the above said, he may increase the subjective probability ofimmediately observing something similar or logically connected.Some Biblical miracles can also be explained as probabilistic miracles. Anexample is the miracle at the Sea of Galilee where Jesus calmed the raging storm(Matthew 8:23-27). This was completely natural event. Wonderful was only thefact that the storm ceased precisely at that moment when this was necessary forJesus and his disciples. The probability of \"timely\" occurring this naturalevent was of course very small. The miracle was probabilistic.5 CONCLUDING REMARKSWe shortly followed in this paper the main ideas of Extended Everett's Concept(EEC) about nature of consciousness. Let us briefly comment on the furtherdevelopment of this theory.All that has been discussed above, makes sense for humans (possessingconsciousness) and may be partly for higher animals. However, the theory may begeneralized to give the quantum concept of life in a more general aspect. Thusmodified theory is meaningful not only for humans, but for all living beings(belonging to the type of life characteristic for Earth). The idea of thegeneralization is follows (see (Mensky, 2010) for details).The main point of EEC is the identification of the \"separation of classicalalternatives\" with the human's consciousness. Now we have to identify thisquantum concept with the ability of the living beings to \"perceive the quantumworld classically\". This is an evident generalization of consciousness but forall living beings. Instead of \"consciousness\" in EEC we have now \"classicalperceiving of quantum reality\" which means that the alternative classicalrealities (forming the state of the quantum world) are perceived separately fromeach other.Similarly to what we told about consciousness (in case of humans), this abilityof living beings to \"classically perceive the quantum world\" is necessary forthe very phenomenon of life (of local type). The reason is the same: elaboratingefficient strategy of surviving is possible only in a classical world which is\"locally predictable\". Existing objectively in the quantum world, any creatureis living in each of the classical realities separately from all the restclassical realities. Life is developing parallely in the Everett's parallelworlds.Remark by the way that from this point of view \"existing\" and \"living\" aredifferent concepts. Important difference is that existing (evolution in time) ofthe inanimate matter is determined by reasons while living of the living beingsis partly determined also by goals (first of all the goal of survival). Let usmake some other remarks concerning philosophical or rather meta-scientificaspects of EEC.This theory shows that a conceptual bridge between the material (described bynatural sciences) and the ideal (treated by the humanities and spiritualdoctrines) does exist. [images/00057.jpg]Fig 1: Carl Jung illustrated the relation between sphere of the material andsphere of the ideal as two cones with common vertex (above). In EEC the \"area ofconsciousness\" is common for both spheres (below). Some of the phenomena in thearea of consciousness cannot be unambiguously assigned to exclusively one of thespheres: objectiveness is relative.This bridge is determined in EEC in a concrete way, but the idea of such abridge is not novel (see Fig. 1). The creators of quantum mechanics from thevery beginning needed the notion of the \"observer's consciousness\" to analyzeconceptual problems of this theory (the \"problem of measurement\"). In fact, thedifficulties in solving these problems were caused by the insistent desire toconstruct quantum mechanics as a purely objective theory. Nowadays it becomesclear that there is no purely objective quantum theory. Objectiveness isrelative (see Sect. 4).There is a very interesting technical point in relations between the materialand the ideal. We see from the preceding consideration that the description ofthe ideal, or psychic (consciousness and the unconscious), arises in theinterior of quantum mechanics when we consider the whole world as a quantumsystem. This provides the absolute quantum coherence which is necessary for theconclusions that are derived from EEC. Usually only restricted systems areconsidered in quantum mechanics. The resulting theory is purely material. Ideal(psychic) elements arise as the specific aspects of the whole world. Theunrestricted character of the world as a quantum system is essential for this(cf. the notion of microcosm).All these issues demonstrate the specific features of the present stage ofquantum theory. Including theory of consciousness (and the unconscious) in therealm of quantum mechanics (starting by Pauli and Jung and now close to beingaccomplished) marks a qualitatively new level of understanding quantum mechanicsitself. The present stage of this theory can be estimated as the second quantumrevolution. When being completed, it will accomplish the intellectual andphilosophical revolution that accompanied creating quantum mechanics in thefirst third of 20th century.References Aspect, A., Grangier, P., Roger, G.

The emergence of spiritual consciousness and its symbolism, is directlylinked to the evolution of the temporal and frontal lobes and to the Neanderthaland Cro-Magnon peoples, and then the first cosmologies, 20,000 to 30,000 yearsago. These ancient peoples of the Upper and Middle Paleolithic were capable ofexperiencing love, fear, and mystical awe, and they carefully buried those theyloved and lost. They believed in spirits and ghosts which dwelled in a heavenlyland of dreams, and interned their dead in sleeping positions and with tools,ornaments and flowers. By 30,000 years ago, and with the expansion of thefrontal lobes, they created symbolic rituals to help them understand and gaincontrol over the spiritual realms, and created signs and symbols which couldgenerate feelings of awe regardless of time or culture. Because they believedsouls ascended to the heavens, the people of the Paleolithic searched theheavens for signs, and between 30,000 to 20,000 years ago, they observed andsymbolically depicted the association between woman's menstrual cycle and themoon, patterns formed by stars, and the relationship between Earth, the sun, andthe four seasons. These include depictions of 1) the \"cross\" which is an ancientsymbol of the fours seasons and the Winter/Summer solstice and Spring/Fallequinox; 2) the constellations of Virgo, Taurus, Orion/Osiris, the Pleiades, andthe star Sirius; 3) and the 13 new moons in a solar year. Although it isimpossible to date these discoveries with precision, it can be concluded thatspiritual consciousness first began to evolve over 100,000 years ago, and thisgave birth to the first heavenly cosmologies over 20,000 years ago.1. THE TRANSMIGRATION OF THE SOULBelief in the transmigration of the soul, of a life after death, of a worldbeyond the grave, has been a human characteristic for at least 100,000 years, asancient graves and mortuary rites attest (e.g., Belfer-Cohen & Hovers, 1992;Butzer, 1982; McCown, 1937; Rightmire, 1984; Schwarcz et al., 1988; Smirnov,1989; Trinkaus 1986). Even ancient \"archaic\" humans, despite their small brainsand primitive intellectual, linguistic, cognitive, and mental capabilities, andwho wondered the planet over 120,000 years ago, carefully buried their dead(Butzer, 1982; Joseph 2000a; Rightmire, 1984). And like modern Homo sapiens,they prepared the recently departed for the journey to the Great Beyond: acrossthe sea of dreams, to the land of the dead, the heavens, the realm of theancestors and the gods.[images/00058.jpg]Paleolithic burial in sleeping position.Throughout the Middle and Upper Paleolithic it was not uncommon for tools andhunting implements to be placed beside the body, even 100,000 years ago, for thedead would need them in the next world (Belfer-Cohen & Hovers, 1992; McCown,1937; Trinkaus, 1986). A hunter in life he was to be a hunter in death, for theethereal world of the Paleolithic was populated by spirits and souls of bear,wolf, deer, bison, and mammoth (e.g., Campbell, 1988; Joseph 2001, 2002; Kuhn,1955). Moreover, food and water might be set near the head in case the spirithungered or experienced thirst on its long sojourn to the heavenly Hereafter.And finally, fragrant blossoming flowers and red ocher might be sprinkled uponthe bodies (Solecki, 1971) along with the tears of those who loved them.[images/00059.jpg]Given the relative paucity of cognitive, cultural, and intellectual developmentamong Middle Paleolithic Neanderthal and \"archaic\" humans, and the likelihoodthat they had not yet acquired modern human speech (Joseph, 1996, 2000b),evidence of spiritual concerns among these peoples demonstrates the greatantiquity of belief in an after-life and the soul. Humans began evolving aspiritual consciousness over 100,000 years ago. Seventy thousand years later,this consciousness would give birth to the first cosmologies.2. MIDDLE PALEOLITHIC SPIRITUALITYWhen humans first became aware of a \"god\" or \"gods\" cannot be determined.Nevertheless, the antiquity of religious and spiritual belief extends backwardsin time to over 100,000 years. It is well established that Neanderthals andother Homo Sapiens of the Middle Paleolithic (e.g. 150,000 to 35,000 B.P.) andUpper Paleolithic (35,000 B.P. to 10,000 B.P.) engaged in complex ritualisticbehavior. These rituals are evident from the manner in which they decoratedtheir caves and the symbolism associated with death (Akazawa & Muhesen 2002;Conrad & Richter 2011; Harvati & Harrison 2010; Kurten 1976; Mellars 1996).[images/00060.jpg]Cro-Magnon burial.Neanderthals (a people who lived in Europe, Russia, Iraq, Africa, and China fromaround 150,000 to 30,000 B.P.), have been buried in sleeping positions with thebody flexed and lying on its side. Some were laid to rest with limestone blocksplaced beneath the head like a pillow—as if they were not truly dead but merelyasleep (Akazawa & Muhesen 2002; Harvati & Harrison 2010).Sleep and dreams have long been associated with the spirit world, and it isthrough dreams that gods including the Lord God worshipped by Jews, Christians,and Muslims, are believed to have communicated their thoughts, warnings,intentions, and commands. Throughout the ages (Campbell 1988; Freud, 1900; Jung1945, 1964), and as repeatedly stated in the Old Testament and the Koran, dreamshave been commonly thought to be the primary medium in which gods and humaninteract (Joseph 2002). Insofar as the ancients (and many moderns folks) wereconcerned, dreams served as a doorway, a portal of entry to the spirit worldthrough which \"God,\" His angels, or myriad demons could make their intentionsknown.[images/00061.jpg]Paleolithic burial in sleeping position.It is through dreams that one is able to come into direct contact with thespirit world and a reality so magical and profoundly different yet as real asanything experienced during waking. It is through dreams that ancient humanscame to believe the spiritual world sits at the boundaries of the physical,where day turns to dusk, the hinterland of the imagination where dreams flourishand grow. And it is while dreaming that one’s own soul may transcend the body,to soar like an eagle, or to commune with the spirits of loved ones who residein heaven along side the gods.Neanderthals prepared their dead for this great and final journey, by layingtheir loved ones to rest so that they would sleep with the spirits and dream ofheavenly eternity.Neanderthals have also been buried surrounded by goat horns placed in a circle,with reindeer vertebrae, animal skins, stone tools, red ocher, and in one grave,seven different types of flowers (Solecki 1971). In one cave (unearthed after60,000 years had passed), a deep chamber was discovered which housed a singleskull which was surrounded by a ring of stones (Harvati & Harrison 2010; Mellars1996). Moreover, Neanderthals buried bears at a number of sites includingRegourdou. At Drachenloch they buried stone \"cysts\" containing bear skulls(Kurten 1976); hence, \"the clan of the cave bear.\"[images/00062.jpg]Neanderthal burial. This Neanderthal was buried with 7different types of flowers.Yet others were buried with large bovine bones above the head, with limestoneblocks placed on top of the head and shoulders, and with heads severed coupledwith evidence of ritual decapitation, facial bone removal, and cannibalism(Belfer-Cohen and Hovers 1992; Binford 1968; Harold 1980; Smirnov 1989; Solecki1971). In one site, dated to over 100,000 years B.P., Neanderthals decapitatedeleven of their fellow Neanderthals, and smashed their faces beyond recognition.It therefore seems apparent that Neanderthals not only engaged in complexrituals, but they believed in spirits, ghosts, and a life after death. Hence thesleeping position, stone pillows, stone tools and food. They were preparing thedeparting spirit for the journey to the Hereafter and the land of dreams.However, they were also incapacitating their enemies, even after death, toprevent these souls from terrorizing the living or their dreams3. SPIRITS, SOULS, GHOSTS & THE LAND OF DREAMSThe fact that so many of the Neanderthal dead were buried in a sleeping positionimplies an association between sleep and dreams. Since all vertebrates so farstudied demontrate REM (dream) sleep, it can be assumed that Neanderthalsdreamed. Among ancient (and even modern peoples) it was believed that souls andspirits could wonder about while people sleep and dream (Brandon 1967; Frazier1950; Harris 1993; Jung 1945, 1964; Malinowkski 1990). Some believed the soulcould escape the body via the mouth or nostrils while dreaming and that thespirit could leave the body and engage in various purposeful acts or interactwith other souls including the soul or spirit of those who had died. The spiritand soul were believed to hover about in human-like, ghostly vestiges, at thefringes of reality, the hinterland where day turns into night (Campbell 1988;Frazier 1950; Jung 1964; Malinowski 1954; Wilson 1951); and it is at night whenpeople dream.[images/00063.jpg]Neanderthal burial.And as is the case with modern day humans, it can be assumed the ancients,including Neanderthals, had dreams by which they were transported or exposed toa world of magic and untold wonders which obeyed its own laws of time, space,and motion. It is through dreams that humans came to believe the spiritual worldsits at the boundaries of the physical, where day turns to dusk, the hinterlandof the mind where imagination and dreams flourish and grow (Frazier, 1950; Jung,1945, 1964; Malinowkski, 1954); hence the tendency to bury the dead in asleeping position even 100,000 years ago.It is also via dreams that humans came to know that spirits and lost soulspopulated the night. The dream was real and so too were the ghosts, gods anddemons who thundered and condemned and the phantoms that hovered at the edge ofnight. Although but a dream, like modern humans, our ancient ancestorsexperienced this through the senses, much as the physical world is experienced.Dreams were real and they were taken seriously. Moreover, during dreams, boththe living and the dead may be encountered. Thus, we can surmise thatNeanderthals had similar dreams and may have dreamed about ghosts and wonderingspirits,It is also appears that they feared the dead, and were terrified by the prospectthat certain souls might haunt the living. They were afraid of ghosts, andfrightened by the possibility that just as one might awake from sleep aftervisiting the land of the dead, the dead might also awake from this deathlikeslumber. The dead, or at least their personal souls, had to be prevented fromcausing mischief among the living; especially dreaded enemies who had beenkilled. Hence, the ritual decapitation, facial bone removal, the smashing offaces, the removal of arms, hands, and legs, and placement of heavy stones uponthe body.It can be concluded, therefore, that almost 100,000 years ago, primitive humanshad already come to believe in ghosts, souls, spirits, and a continuation of\"life\" after death. And, they also took precautions, in some cases, to preventcertain spirits and souls from being released from a dead body and returning tocause mischief among the living, which is why, in the case or powerful enemies,the Neanderthals would cut off heads and hands. They went to great lengths toobliterate all aspects of that dreaded individual’s personal identity; e.g.,smashing the face beyond recognition.Of course, the fact that these Neanderthals were buried does not necessarilyimply that they held a belief in \"God.\" Rather, what the evidence demonstratesis that Neanderthals were capable of very intense emotions and feelings rangingfrom murderous rage to love to spiritual and superstitious awe. Although no godis implied, Neanderthals held spiritual and mystical beliefs involving thetransmigration of the soul and all the horrors, fears, and hopes that accompanysuch feelings and beliefs. Although the Neanderthals had not discovered god,they stood upon the threshold.4. THE NEANDERTHALS: A CHARACTER STUDYNeanderthals were short, brutish, and an exceedingly violent, murderous people,as the remnants of their skeletons preserved for so many eons attests. Many oftheir fossils still betray the cruel ravages of deliberately and violentlyinflicted wounds (Conrad & Richter 2011; Harvati & Harrison 2010; Mellars 1996).[images/00064.jpg][images/00065.jpg]They also appear to have systematically engaged in female infanticide, anddisplayed a willingness to eat almost anything on four or two legs—includingother Neanderthals. In one site, dated to over 100,000 years B.P., Neanderthalsdecapitated eleven of their fellow Neanderthals, and then enlarged the base ofeach skull (the foramen magnum) so the brains could be scooped out andpresumably eaten. Even the skulls of children were treated in this fashion.In fact, they would throw the bones and carcasses of other Neanderthals into therefuse pile. In one cave, a collection of over 20 Neanderthals were found mixedup with the remains of other animals and garbage. Presumably, these were enemiesor just hapless strangers, innocent cave dwellers who were attacked andsometimes eaten after being brutally killed.Hence, with the obvious exception of \"friends,\" mates, and family, Neanderthalsoften saw one another as a potential meal, and had almost no regard for astranger’s innate humanness. These were a violent, murderous, ritualisticpeople, and strangers were often brutally killed and eaten.[images/00066.jpg](Left) Two well preserved crania from northern European male Neanderthals.Reproduced from M. H. Wolpoff (1980), Paleo-Anthropology. New York, Knopf.(Right) Neanderthal Male. Reproduced from Howells, 1997. Getting Here. CompassPress, Washington D.C. These characteristics are also associated with religiousfervor. Among ancient and present day peoples, violence, murder, ritualcannibalism, and the sacrifice of children are common religious practices. TheFive Books of Moses, are replete with stories of the mass murder and thegenocide of non-Jews who were seen as subhuman, including pregnant women andchildren.\"...when you approach a town, you shall lay seizure to it, and when the Lordyour god delivers it into your hand, you shall put all its males to thesword.... In the towns of the people which the Lord your god is giving you as aheritage, you shall not let a soul remain alive.\" Exodus 20:15-18; Deuterotomy20:12-16.\"When Israel had killed all the inhabitants of Ai....and all of them, to thelast man had fallen by the sword, all the Isrealites turned back to Ai and putit to the sword...until all the inhabitants of Ai had been exterminated... andthe king of Ai was impaled on a stake and it was left lying at the entrance tothe city gate.\" Deuteronomy 8:24-29.I polluted them with their own offerings, making them sacrifice all theirfirst-born, which was to punish them, so that they would learn that I am Yahweh(Ezekiel 20:25-36. See also Ezekiel 22:28-29). \"This very day you defileyourselves in the presentation of your gifts by making your children passthrough the fire of all your fetishes.\" (Ezekiel 20:31). \"A blessing on him whoseizes your babies and dashes them against rocks.\" (Psalm 137:9).[images/00067.jpg]Aztec and Indian natives were burnt alive in groups of 13 tohonor Jesus Christ and his 12 disciples.As is well known, the Spanish and Catholic missionaries, acting at the behest ofthe Catholic Popes (and their Spanish/Catholic Sovereigns), continued thesegenocidal practices once they invaded the Americas during the 1500's and upthrough the 19th century. As the Catholic Dominican Bishop Bartolom de Las Casasreported to the Pope: the Aztec and Indian natives were hung and burnt alive \"ingroups of 13... thus honoring our Savior and the 12 apostles.\"5. The Limbic System: Love, Violence, & Spirituality.Violence and murder are also under the control of the limbic system, theamygdala in particular (Joseph 1992, 1994, 1996, 1998). And it is the limbicsystem which mediates religious and spiritual experience and which provides muchof the emotion and imagery which appears in dreams (Joseph 1988, 2000a, 2001,2002).[images/00068.jpg]However, it is also the limbic system which subserves feelings of love andaffection, and the ability to form long-term attachments. Thus we see thatNeanderthals provided loving care for friends and family who had been injured ormaimed, enabling them to live many more years despite their grievous injuries.For example, the skeleton of one Neanderthal male, who was about age 45 when hedied, had been nursed for a number of years following profoundly cripplinginjuries. His right arm had atrophied, and his lower arm and hand had apparentlybeen ripped or bitten off, and his left eye socket, right shoulder, collarbone,and both legs were badly injured. Obviously someone loved and tenderly cared forthis man. He was no doubt a father, a husband, a brother, and son, and someonein his family not only provided long term loving care to make him comfortable inthis life, but prepared him for the next life as well (Mellars 1996).[images/00069.jpg]The ability to feel love is a function of the limbic system,the amygdala in particular which is buried in the depths of the temporal lobe. 6. THE NEANDERTHAL BRAIN & TEMPORAL LOBESAn examination of Neanderthal skulls and endocasts of the inner skull provides agross indication of the size and configuration of their brains. Based onphysical indices, the temporal lobe was well developed and little different fromthat of modern humans.[images/00070.jpg](Left)Neanderthal. (Right) Modern human.[images/00071.jpg]Likewise, given the great antiquity of the limbic system, it can be surmisedthat the Paleolithic human limbic system was well developed, and similar to thelimbic system of modern humans (Joseph 2000a, 2001; 2002).[images/00072.jpg]The Neanderthals were not a very intelligent or tidy people and were unable tofashion complex tools which, along with other indices, suggests they were unablethink complex thoughts. Yet they were people of passion who experienced profoundemotions and love; made possible by the limbic system and temporal lobe. Infact, it is because they had the limbic capacity to experience love, spiritualawe, and religious concerns, that these expressions of love continued followingdeath of those they loved, as it has been conclusively demonstrated that thesebrain structures mediate these functions (Joseph 1992, 1994, 1998a, 2001, 2002).Thus the Neanderthals carefully buried their dead, providing them with food andeven sprinkling the bodies with seven different types of blooming, blossoming,fragrant flowers (Belfer-Cohen & Hovers, 1992; McCown, 1937; Solecki 1971;Trinkaus, 1986).In overall size, the posterior portion of the Neanderthal brain, i.e. theoccipital and superior parietal lobes, were slightly larger in length andbreadth than the modern human brain on average (Joseph 1996, 2000b; Wolpoff,1980); a reflection of the environment in which they dwelled and the neuralcapacities their life style required-- the body moving in visual space asNeanderthals spent most of their non-sleeping hours searching for food. Theoccipital and superior parietal areas are directly concerned with visualanalysis and positioning the body in space (Joseph 1986, 1996). As male andfemale Neanderthals spent a considerable amount of their time engaged in huntingactivities, scanning the environment for prey and running and throwing in visualspace were more or less ongoing concerns. A large occipital and superiorparietal lobe would reflect these activities.[images/00073.jpg]By contrast, concerns about the dead, and attendant mortuary rituals areactivities linked to the temporal lobes. The temporal lobes and underlyinglimbic structures (amygdala, hippocampus), could be likened the seat of the souland the senior executive of the personality. It is the temporal lobes and theamygdala and hippocampus which have been directly implicated in the generationof religious feelings and supernatural experiences including visions of floatingabove the body, seeing angels and devils, and what has been described as theafter-death and near-death experiences (Joseph 1996, 1998b, 1999a,b, 2000a,2001, 2002).The amygdala (which is buried in the depths of the anterior temporal lobe)enables us to hear \"sweet sounds,\" recall \"bitter memories,\" or determine ifsomething is spiritually significant, sexually enticing, or good to eat andmakes it possible to experience the spiritually sublime. It is concerned withthe most basic animal emotions, and allows us to store affective experiences inmemory or even to reexperience them when awake or during the course of a dreamin the form of visual, auditory, or religious or spiritual imagery. The amygdalaalso enables an individual to experience emotions such as love and religiousrapture, as well as the ecstasy associated with orgasm and the dread and terrorassociated with the unknown.In fact, the amygdala (in conjunction with the hippocampus and overlyingtemporal lobe) contributes in large part to the production of very bizarre,unusual and fearful mental phenomenon including dissociative states, feelings ofdepersonalization, and hallucinogenic and dream-like recollections involvingthreatening men, naked women, the experience of god, as well as demons andghosts and pigs walking upright dressed as people (Daly 1958; Gloor 1997;Halgren 1992; Horowitz et al. 1968; MacLean 1990; Penfield and Perot 1963;Schenk, and Bear 1981; Slater and Beard 1963; Subirana and Oller-Daurelia 1953;Trimble 1991; Weingarten, et al. 1977; Williams 1956). Moreover, someindividuals report communing with spirits or receiving profound knowledge fromthe Hereafter, following amygdala stimulation or abnormal activation (Penfieldand Perot 1963; Subirana and Oller-Daurelia, 1953; Williams 1956).Intense activation of the temporal lobe, hippocampus, and amygdala has beenreported to give rise to a host of sexual, religious and spiritual experiences;and chronic hyperstimulation can induce an individual to become hyper-religiousor visualize and experience ghosts, demons, angels, and even \"God,\" as well asclaim demonic and angelic possession or the sensation of having left their body(Bear 1979; Gloor 1992; Horowitz et al. 1968; MacLean 1990; Penfield and Perot1963; Schenk, and Bear 1981; Weingarten, et al. 1977; Williams 1956).Much of the visual, emotional, and hallucinatory aspects of dream sleep, havetheir source in the temporal lobe and underlying limbic system structures(Joseph 1992, 1994, 1996, 1998, 2001, 2002). It is the evolution of the temporallobes, this \"transmitter to god\" which also explains why even primitive humanitylikely believed in spirits, souls, and ghosts, and practiced complex mortuaryrites for those they feared or loved.7. THE BIG BANG IN SYMBOLIC THINKING: THE CRO-MAGNON FRONTAL LOBESThere is considerable evidence that over the course of human history, thetemporal lobe evolved at a faster and earlier rate than the frontal lobe (Joseph1996, 2000b, Gloor, 1997). Likewise, the temporal lobes mature more rapidly thanthe frontal lobes over the course of human ontological development (Joseph,1982, 1996, 1998b, 1999a, 2000b,c).[images/00074.jpg][images/00075.jpg]Comparison of the frontal lobes (red) in different speciesThe Neanderthals were blessed with a well developed temporal lobe, whereas moreanterior regions of the brain, the frontal lobes, remained little different frommore ancient ancestral primate species. However, with the evolution of theCro-Magnon people, the brain mushroomed in size, with much of that developmentin the frontal lobes[images/00076.jpg](Top) Neanderthal skull. (Bottom) Cro-Magnon SkullAs based on cranial comparisons and endocasts of the inside of the skull, andusing the temporal and frontal poles as reference points, it has beendemonstrated that the brain has tripled in size over the course of humanevolution, and that the frontal lobes significantly expanded in length andheight during the Middle to Upper Paleolithic transition (Blinkov and Glezer1968; Joseph 1993; MacLean 1990; Tilney 1928; Weil 1929; Wolpoff 1980).[images/00077.jpg]It is obvious that the height of the frontal portion of the skull is greater inthe six foot tall, anatomically modern Upper Paleolithic H. sapiens (Cro-Magnon)versus Neanderthal and archaic H. sapiens (Joseph 1996, 2000b; Tilney, 1928;Wolpoff 1980). The evolution and expansion of the frontal lobe is also evidentwhen comparing the skills and creative and technological ingenuity of theCro-Magnons, vs the Neanderthals (Joseph 1993, 1996, 2000b).Therefore, whereas the temporal, occipital and parietal lobes were welldeveloped in archaic and Neanderthals, the frontal lobes would increase in sizeby almost a third in the transition from archaic humans to Cro-Magnon (Joseph1996, 2000a,b, 2001).It is the evolution of the frontal lobes which ushered in a cognitive andcreative big bang which gave birth to a technological revolution and complexspiritual rituals and beliefs in shamans and goddesses and their relationship tothe heavens, and thus the moon and the stars.[images/00078.jpg]Neanderthals died out as a species around 30,000 years ago; but for at least10,000 years they shared the planet with the Cro-Magnon people. The Cro-Magnonmen stood 6ft tall on average and the males and females were very handsome andbeautiful, with thin hips, aquiline noses, prominent chins, small even perfectteeth, and high rounded foreheads. There was nothing ape-like or Neanderthalabout these people.The Cro-Magnon cerebrum was also significantly larger than the Neanderthalbrain, with volumes ranging from around 1600 to1880 cc on average compared with1,033 to 1,681 cc for Neanderthals (Blinikov & Glezer 1968; Clark 1967; Day1996; Holloway 1985; Roginskii & Lewin 1955; Wolpoff 1980). In fact, theCro-Magnon brain is one third larger than the modern human brain, i.e. 1800 ccvs 1350 ccs. However, a distinguishing characteristic of the Cro-Magnon brain,was the massively developed frontal lobes.The frontal lobes are the senior executive of the brain and are responsible forinitiative, goal formation, long term planning, the generation of multiplealternatives, and the consideration of multiple consequences (Joseph, 1986a,1999a). The frontal lobes are the source of creativity, imagination, and whathas been described as free will (Joseph 1996, 2011). Through interactionalpathways maintained with brainstem, limbic system, thalamus and the primaryreceiving and association areas in the neocortex (Petrides & Pandya 1999,2001)), the frontal lobes have access to every stage of information analysis,and are able to coordinate and regulate attention, memory, personality, andinformation processing throughout the brain so as to direct intellectual,creative, artistic, symbolic, and cognitive processes (Joseph, 1986a, 1999a).It is well established that the frontal lobes enable humans to thinksymbolically, creatively, imaginatively, to plan for the future, to consider theconsequences of certain acts, to formulate secondary goals, and to keep one goalin mind even while engaging in other tasks, so that one may remember and act onthose goals at a later time (Joseph 1986, 1990b, 1996, 1999c). Selectiveattention, planning skills, and the ability to marshal one’s intellectualresources so as to to anticipate the future rather than living in the past, arecapacities clearly associated with the frontal lobes.[images/00079.jpg]Comparison of the frontal cranium over the course of \"evolution:\" fromAustralopithecus, to H. Habilis, to H. erectus. to modern humans. Note obviousexpansion of the anterior portion of the skull frontal lobe.The frontal lobes are associated with the evolution of \"free will\" (Joseph 1986,1996, 1999c, 2011b) and the Cro-Magnon were the first species on this planet toexercise that free will, shattering the bonds of environmental/geneticdeterminism by doing what had never been done before: After they emerged uponthe scene over 35,000 years ago, they created and fashioned tools, weapons,clothing, jewelry, pottery, and musical instruments that had never before beenseen. They created underground Cathedrals of artistry and light, adorned withmagnificent multi-colored paintings ranging from abstract impressionism to thesurreal and equal to that of any modern master (Breuil, 1952; Leroi-Gourhan1964, 1982). And they used their skills to carve the likeness of their femalegods.[images/00080.jpg]Paleolithic Goddess: Venus de Brassempouy.Thirty five thousand years ago, Cro-Magnon were painting animals not only onwalls but on ceilings, utilizing rich yellows, reds, and browns in theirpaintings and employing the actual shape of the cave walls so as to conform withand give life-like dimensions, including the illusion of movement to thecreature they were depicting (Breuil, 1952; Leroi-Gourhan 1964, 1982). Many oftheir engraving on bones and stones also show a complete mastery of geometricawareness and they often used the natural contours of the cave walls, includingprotuberances, to create a 3-dimensional effect (Breuil, 1952; LeroiGourhan1964, 1982).[images/00081.jpg][images/00082.jpg]The drawing or carving often became a harmonious or rather, an organic part ofthe object, wall, ceiling, or tool upon which it was depicted. The Cro-Magnondrew and painted scenes in which animals mated, defecated, fought, charged,and/or were fleeing and dying from wounds inflicted by hunters. The Cro-Magnoncave painters were exceedingly adept at recreating the scenes of everyday life.Moreover, most of the animals were drawn to scale, that is, they were depictedin their actual size; and all this, 30,000 years ago (e.g. Chauvet, et al.,1997).They created art that was meant to be looked at, owned and admired, and fortrade, as jewelry and household decorations, and as highly prized possessions aswell as for religious reverence. Picasso was awestruck by these Paleolithicmasterpieces, and complained that although 30,000 years had elapsed, \"we havelearned nothing new. We have invented nothing.\"With the evolution of the Cro-Magnon people, the frontal lobes mushroomed insize and there followed an explosion in creative thought and technologicalinnovation. The CroMagnon were intellectual giants. They were accomplishedartists, musicians, craftsmen, sorcerers, and extremely talented hunters,fishermen, and highly efficient gatherers and herbalists. And they were thefirst to contemplate the heavens and the cosmos which they symbolized in art.From the time of Homo Erectus (1.9 million to 500,000 B.P), humans had utilizedfire to keep warm, to provide light, to cook their food, and to ward offanimals. However, the Cro-Magnon learned over 30,000 years ago how to make fireusing the firestone; iron pyrite which when repeatedly struck with a flint makessparks which can easily ignite brush. They also created the first rudimentaryblast furnaces which were capable of emitting enormous amounts of heat, so as tofire clay. This was accomplished by digging a tiny tunnel into the bottom of thehearth which allowed air to be drawn in. Indeed, 30,000 years ago these peoplewere making fire hardened ceramics and clay figures of animals and females withbulging buttocks and breasts—which are presumed to be the first goddesses andfertility fetishes(Breuil, 1952; Leroi-Gourhan 1964).[images/00083.jpg]Many of these female figurines were shaped so that they tapered into points sothey could be stuck into the ground or into some other substance either forornamental or supernatural purposes, e.g., household goddesses, fertilityfigures, and earth mothers (Breuil, 1952). In fact, much of the art produced, beit finely crafted \"laurel leafs\" or other artistic masterpieces, served ritual,spiritual, and esthetic functions.It is the evolution of the Cro-Magnon and their massive frontal lobes whichushered in a cognitive and creative big bang which gave birth to complexspiritual rituals and beliefs in shamans, goddesses, and the cosmos (Joseph2001, 2001, 2002).By contrast, Neanderthals, archaics, and other peoples of the Middle Paleolithicwere not very smart, and lived in the \"here and now.\" They had little capacityfor creative or abstract thought, and constructed and made and used the samesimple stone tools over and over again for perhaps 200,000 years, until around35,000 B.P., with little variation or consideration of alternatives (Binford,1982; Gowlett, 1984; Mellars, 1989, 1996).[images/00084.jpg]Neanderthal tools.As neatly summed up by Hayden (1993, p. 139), \"as a rule, there is no evidenceof private ownership or food storage, no evidence for the use of economicresources for status or political competition.... no ornaments or other statusdisplay items, no skin garments requiring intensive labor to produce, no toolsrequiring high energy investments, no intensive regional exchange for rare itemslike sea shells or amber, no competition for labor to produce economic surplusesand no corporate art or labor intensive rituals in deep cave recesses to impressonlookers and help attract labor.\"Neanderthals greatly lacked in creativity, initiative, imagination, and tendedto create simple stone tools that served a single purpose. They tended to livein the immediacy of the present, with little ability to think about or considerthe distant future or engage in creative or abstract thought (Binford, 1973,1982; Dennell, 1985; Mellars, 1989, 1996). These are capacities associated withthe frontal lobes.[images/00085.jpg][images/00086.jpg](Top Left) Modern human brain. (Upper Right) Neanderthal cranium withendocasts of their brains superimposed. (Lower ) Modern humanAbout one third of the frontal lobe, i.e. the motor areas, are concerned withinitiating, planning, and controlling the movement of the body and fine motorfunctioning (Joseph 1990b, 1999c). It is this part of the \"archaic\" andNeanderthal frontal lobe that appears to be most extensively developed. However,the more anterior frontal lobes are concerned with wholly different functionsranging from creative thought to analytical and planning skills (Joseph 1986,1996, 1999c), and it is this region of the brain which exploded in size with theevolution of the Cro-Magnon people.Thus, whereas mortuary rites and primitive spirituality can be associated withthe temporal lobes and the Neanderthals, it was not until the evolutionaryexpansion of the non-motor regions of the frontal lobes that spirituality andconcepts of the soul could be expressed through abstract symbolism. Therefore,the evolution of spirituality preceded abstract concepts which could beassociated with religiosity; all of which in turn are directly linked to thedifferential evolution of the frontal and temporal lobes.Upper Paleolithic Cro-Magnons buried with tools, ornaments, hunting implements,and other essentials.[images/00087.jpg][images/00088.jpg](Left) Two boys buried together. (Right)Cro-Magnon adult. Note tools, ornaments, hunting implements, and otheressentials. 8. CRO-MAGNON UPPER PALEOLITHIC SPIRITUAL CONSCIOUSNESS: THE BIRTH OF THE GODSThe Cro-Magnon practiced complex religious rituals and apparently were the firstpeoples to have arrived at the conception of \"god.\" However, it was not a malegod who they worshipped but female goddesses who were attended by animals andshaman.Beginning over 30,000 years ago the Cro-Magnon were painting, drawing, andetching bear and mammoth, dear and horse, and pregnant females and goddesses inthe recesses of dark and dusky caverns (Bandi 1961; Breuil, 1952; Chauvet etal., 1996; Leroi-Gourhan 1964, 1982; Prideaux 1973). The pregnant femalesinclude Venus statuettes, many of which were fertility goddesses.[images/00089.jpg]Paleolithic fertility rites. Dancing Paleolithic Goddesssurrounded by female dancers.A pregnant woman is a symbol of fertility. However, so to is a slim, big bustedfemale. The Cro-Magnon were able to draw both. In fact, these were the firstpeople to paint and etch what today might be considered Paleolithic porn: slim,shapely, naked and nubile young maidens in various positions of repose.[images/00090.jpg]These naked females were not drawn for the sake of prurient interests. Thesewere fertility gods associated with the heavens and the stars.[images/00091.jpg]A mother goddess, holding in her hand the symbol of the moon (or a bison's horn)with 13 lines, which is the number of menstrual/lunar cycles in a solar year.Her other hand rests upon her pregnant belly. This goddess was carved outsidethe entrance to an underground Paleolitic Cathedral, in Laussel.The Cro-Magon paid homage to a number of goddesses who was associated with thefertility of the earth, as well as the moon and the stars. One great goddess,linked to the moon was carved in limestone over the entrance to an undergroundcathedral in Laussel, France, perhaps 20,000 years ago. She was painted in thecolors of life and fertility: blood red. Her left hand still rests upon herpregnant belly whereas in her right hand she holds the horned crescent of themoon which is engraved with thirteen lines, the number of new moon cycles in asolar year. She was a goddess of life, linked to the mysteries of the heavensand the magical powers of the moon whose 29 day cycle likely corresponded withthe Cro-Magnon menstrual cycle which issues from a woman’s life-giving womb. TheCro-Magnon believed in gods. God was a woman linked to the Moon, and the earthwas her womb from which life would spring anew.[images/00092.jpg][images/00093.jpg]A bull head shaman, the legs and vaginal area of a woman, the head/body of alion, facing a cross, and painted on a breast-like protrusions. The shamanappears to be mating with the female.These great underground cathedrals may have also served as the Earth-womb of thegoddess, where souls were reborn as men, women, and animals. Specific locationswithin the Earth-womb were of were of ritualistic, mystical, and spiritualsignificance in that many paintings were in out of the way places where one hadto crawl long distances through tiny spaces and along rather tortuous routes toget to them (Leroi-Gourhan 1964). Moreover, for almost 20,000 years, subsequentgenerations of Cro-Magnon artists crawled to these same difficult to reachlocations to repaint or paint over existing drawings which were hidden away indeep recesses of these dark underground caverns that were extremely difficult tofind (Leroi-Gourhan 1964). This indicates that the location within the cave wasof particular mystical and ritualistic importance. And not just the location butthe journey to these hidden recesses may have been of mystical significanceperhaps relating to birth, or rebirth following death.9. SPIRITS, SOULS, AND SORCERERSAs is evident from their cave art and symbolic accomplishments, the nether worldof the Cro- Magnon and other peoples of the Upper Paleolithic, was haunted bythe spirits and souls of the living, the dead, and those yet to be born (Brandon1967; Campbell 1988; Prideaux 1973).[images/00094.jpg]Sorcerer/Shaman: Half bull / half humanUpper Paleolithic peoples apparently believed these souls and spirits could becharmed and controlled by hunting magic, and through the spells of sorcerers andshamans. Hence, in conjunction with the worship of the goddess, the Cro-Magnonsalso relied on shamans dressed as animals.Hundreds of feet beneath the earth, the likeness of one ancient shaman attiredin animal skins and stag antlers, graces the upper wall directly above theentrance to the 20,000-25,000 year-old grand gallery at Les Trois-Freres insouthern France (Breuil, 1952; Leroi-Gourhan 1964). Galloping, running, andswirling about this ancient sorcerer are bison, stag, horse, deer, andpresumably their spirits and souls. Images of an almost identical \"sorcerer\"appear again in ancient Sumerian and Babylonian inscriptions fashioned four tosix thousand years ago (Joseph 2000a). The \"sorcerer\" has a name: \"Enki\"-the godof the double helix.[images/00095.jpg][images/00096.jpg]Cro-Magon Shaman (Left). Babylonian God(Right) 10. UNDERGROUND CATHEDRALS: EMBRACED BY THE LIGHTIn order to view these Cro-Magnon paintings, statues and shrines, one has toenter the hidden entrance of an underground cave, and crawl a considerabledistance, sometimes hundreds of yards, through a twisting, narrowing, pitchblack tunnel before reaching these Upper Paleolithic underground cathedralswhich were shrouded in darkness (Breuil, 1952). Here the Cro-Magnon would lightcandles and lamps, performing magical and spiritual rituals as the paintedanimals and spirits wavered in the cave light.[images/00097.jpg]Lascaux cave, France.The nature and location of the Cro-Magnon cathedrals, which have been foundthroughout Europe, and the nature of the tortuous routes to get to them, and theeffect of cave light bringing these paintings to life, is significant as itembraces features associated with after death experiences as retold by presentday (as well as ancient) peoples.Lascaux cave, France.In the ancient Egyptian and Tibetan Books of the Dead, and has been reportedamong many of those who have undergone a \"near death\" or \"life after death\"experience, being enveloped in a dark tunnel is commonly experienced soon afterdeath. It is only as one ascends the tunnel that one will see in the decreasingdistance, a light, the \"light\" of \"Heaven\" and of paradise. Once embraced by thelight \"the recently dead\" may be greeted by the souls of dead relatives,friends, and/or radiant human or animal-like entities (Eadie, 1992; Rawling1978; Ring 1980).However, emerging from the tunnel and mouth of the cave, would also be asymbolic rebirth through the birth canal and womb of the earth.... 11. DREAMS, ANIMAL SPIRITS AND LOST SOULSAcross time and culture, people have believed that not just humans but animals,plants and trees were sensitive, sentient, intelligent, and the abode of spiritsincluding the souls of dead ancestors (Campbell 1988; Frazier 1950; Harris,1993; Jung 1964; Malinowski 1948). Before hunting and killing an animal, itsspirit sometimes had to be conjured forth so as to not harm it, or to askforgiveness (Campbell 1988; Frazier 1950). The great hunters respected and paidhomage to the souls and spirits of the animals they killed, and the Cro-Magnonwere great hunters.A dead hunter and a birds head. A disembowled bison stands above him. Presumablythis scene depicts the death of a hunter and the flight of his soul assymbolized by the bird.Bird heads were commonly employed by ancient peoples including the Egyptians todepict the ascension to heaven. Eventually, bird heads were replaced bycreatures with wings, e.g. angels. However, the symbolism of the birds alsorefers to flight, and the spirits of the dead were believed to ascend to theheavens which were filled with stars.Be it human, animal or plant, souls were also believed capable of migrating tonew abodes, and that souls could migrate from humans, to animals or plants andthen back again (Campbell, 1988; Frazier, 1950; Harris, 1993; Jung, 1964;Malinowkski, 1948). The spirit left the body at death, and the body was buriedin the womb of the earth, from which new life would emerge. And the liberatedsoul might ascend to starry vault of heaven, sometimes taking the shape and formof a bird.[images/00098.jpg]Goddesses with bird heads. From Libya, approximately 10,000 B.P. The bird headsymbolizes the capacity for flight and thus the ability to ascend to heaven. Beit following death, or during a dream, sometimes the soul was believed to takeon another form, such as a bird, or deer, fox, rabbit, wolf, and so on. Thespirit and the soul could also hover about in human- or animal-like, ghostlyvestiges, at the fringes of reality, the hinterland where day turns into night(Campbell 1988; Frazier 1950; Jung 1964; Malinowski 1954; Wilson 1951). Thesouls of animal’s such as a wolf or eagle, could also leave the body and take onvarious forms including that of a woman or Man. Not just men but animals too hadsouls that had to be respected.Even after death souls continued to interact with the living, and every livingbeing possessed a soul. Hence, the ancients believed that these souls could beinfluenced, their behavior controlled, and, in consequence, a good hunt insuredor with the assistance of a soul. And thus, deep within the womb of the Earth,the Cro-Magnon painted and paid homage to the spirits of the animal world.Souls were also believed by ancient humans to wonder about while people sleepand dream (Brandon 1967; Frazier 1950; Harris 1993; Jung 1945, 1964; Malinowkski1990). That is, among many different cultures and religions the soul is believedto sometimes wonder away from the body, especially while dreaming, and mayengage in certain acts or interact with other souls including those of the dearbut long dead and departed. These peoples believed in an afterlife and a spiritworld which could be entered through a doorway of dreams. Thus, at death, thesoul or spirit would be completely liberated from the body.[images/00099.jpg]Spirits and the souls (wondjinas) of the dead Paleolithic spirits ascending to the heavens.According to the ancients, the soul could exit the body following death and thuswe see that the peoples of the Paleolithic peoples often buried their dead insleeping positions. And, because the Cro-Magnons obviously believed in anafter-life, they buried their dead with food, weapons, flowers, jewelry,clothing, pendants, rings, necklaces, multifaceted tools, head bands, beads,bracelets and so on. The Cro-Magnon were a profoundly spiritual people and theyfully prepared the dead for the journey to the spirit world, equipping them sothat they could live for all eternity in the land of the ancestors and the gods.12. THE COSMOLOGY OF ANCIENT SPIRITUALITYWhen humans first turned their eyes to the sun, moon, and stars to ponder thenature of existence and the cosmos, is unknown. The Cro-Magnon people were keenobservers of the world around them, which they depicted with artistic majesty.The heavens were part of their world and they searched the skies for signs andobserved the moon, the patterns formed by clusters of stars, and perhaps therelationship between the Earth, the sun, and the changing seasons. Although itis impossible to date cave paintings with precision, the first evidence of thisawareness of the cosmic connection between Sun, Moon, Woman, Earth and thechanging seasons are from the Paleolithic; symbolized in the creations of theCro-Magnon.12.1. GODDESS OF THE MOON Among the ancients, the Sun and the Moon were ofparticular importance and the Cro-Magnon observed the relationship between womanand the lunar cycle. Consider, the pregnant goddess, the Venus of Laussel, whoholds the crescent moon in her hand (though others say it is a bison's horn).Although the length of a Cro-Magnon woman's menstrual cycle is unknown, it canbe assumed that like modern woman she menstruated once every 28 to 29 days,which corresponds to a lunar month 29 days long, and which averages out to 13menstrual cycles in a solar year. And not just menstruation, but pregnancy islinked to the phases of the moon.[images/00100.jpg][images/00101.jpg][images/00102.jpg][images/00103.jpg]12.2. THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE SOLAR CLOCK. When the Cro-Magnon turned their eyesto the heavens, seeking to peer beyond the mystery that separated this worldfrom the next, they observed the sun. With a brain one third larger than modernhumans, and given their tremendous power of observation, it can be predictedthese ancient people would have associated the movement of the sun with thechanging seasons which effected the behavior of animals, the growth of plants,and the climate and weather; all of which are directly associated with cyclicalterations in the position of the sun and the length of a single day over thecourse of a solar year which is equal to 13 moons.The four seasons, marked by two solstices and the two equinoxes have beensymbolized by most ancient cultures with the sign of the cross, e.g. the \"fourcorners\" of the world and the heavens. The \"sign of the cross\" generallysignifies religious or cosmic significance. The Cro-Magnon also venerated thesign of the cross, the first evidence of which, an engraved cross, is at least60,000 years old (Mellars, 1989). Yet another cross, was painted in bold redochre upon the entryway to the Chauvet Cave, dated to over 30,000 years ago(Chauvet et al., 1996).[images/00104.jpg]The entrance to the underground Upper Paleolithic cathedral.The Chauvet cave. Note sign of the cross. From Chauvet et al., (1996). Dawn ofArt: The Chauvet Cave. Henry H. Adams. NYThe illusion of movement of the Sun, from north to south, and then back again,in synchrony with the waxing and waning of the four seasons, is due to thechanging tilt and inclination of the Earth’s axis, as it spins and orbits thesun. Thus over a span of 13 moons, it appears to an observer that the daysbecome shorter and then longer and then shorter again as the sun moves fromnorth to south, crosses the equator, and then stops, and heads back north again,only to stop, and then to again head south, crossing the equator only to againstop and head north again. The two crossings each year, over the equator (inMarch and September) are referred to as equinoxes and refers to the days andnights being of equal length. The two time periods in which the sun appears tostop its movement, before reversing course (June and December), are referred toas solstices—the “sun standing still.”The sun was recognized by ancient astronomer priests, as a source of light andlife-giving heat, and as a keeper of time, like the hands ticking across theface of a cosmic clock. Because of the scientific, religious, and cosmologicalsignificance of the sun, ancient peoples, in consequence, often erected andoriented their religious temples to face and point either to the rising sun onthe day of the solstice (that is, in a southwest—northeast axis), or to face therising sun on the day of the equinox (an east-west axis). For example, theancient temples and pyramids in Egypt were oriented to the solstices, whereasthe Temple of Solomon faced the rising sun on the day of the equinox.Thus the sign of the cross is linked to the heavens and to the sun.Understanding the heavens and the sun, has been been a common astronomicalmethod of divining the the will of the gods, and for navigation, localization,and calculation: these celestial symbols have heavenly significance.Regardless of time and culture, from the Aztecs, Mayans, American Indians,Romans, Greeks, Africans, Christians, Cro-Magnons, Egyptians (the key of life),and so on, the cross consistently appears in a mystical context, and/or isattributed tremendous cosmic significance (Budge,1994; Campbell, 1988; Joseph,2000a; Jung, 1964). The sign of the cross was the ideogram of the goddess \"An\",the Sumerian giver of all life from which rained down the seeds of life on allworlds including the worlds of the gods. An of the cross gave life to the gods,and to woman and man.[images/00105.jpg]God Seb supporting Goddess Nut who represents heaven. Key of life: ring with across. The symbol of the cross is in fact associated with innumerable gods andgoddesses, including Anu of the ancient Egyptians, the Egyptian God Seb, theGoddess Nut, the God Horus (the hawk), as well as Christ and the Mayan and AztecGod, Quetzocoatl. For example, like the Catholics, the Mayas and Aztecs adornedtheir temples with the sign of the cross. Quetzocoatl, like Jesus, was a god ofthe cross.[images/00106.jpg]Quetzocoatl god of the cross. Round shield encircling thecross represents the sun.In China the equilateral cross is represented as within a square whichrepresents the Earth, the meaning of which is: \"God made the Earth in the formof a cross.\" It is noteworthy that the Chinese cross-in-a-box can also belikened to the swastika—also referred to as the \"gammadion\" which is one of thenames of the Lord God: \"Tetragammadion.\" The cross, in fact forms a series ofboxes when aligned from top to bottom or side by side, and crosshatchings suchas these were carved on stone over 60,000 years ago.[images/00107.jpg]Ochre etched with crosses, forming a series ofcross-hatchings, dating to 77,000 years ago.Among the ancient, the sign of the cross, represented the journey of the sunacross the four corners of the heavens. The Cro-Magon adorned the entrance andthe walls of their underground cathedrals with the sign of the cross, whichindicates this symbol was of profound cosmic significance. However, that some ofthe Cro-Magnon depictions of animal-headed men have also been found facing thecross, may also pertain to the heavens: the patterns formed by stars, whichtoday are refereed to as \"constellations.\"12.3. THE CONSTELLATION OF VIRGO There is nothing \"virginal\" about theconstellation of Virgo. The pattern can be likened to a woman in lying on herback with an arm behind her head, and this may have been the visage whichstirred the imagination of the Cro-Magnon.[images/00108.jpg]Cro-Magnon goddess, depicting the constellation of Virgo. La Magdelain cave.[images/00109.jpg]12.4. THE PLEIADES AND THE CONSTELLATIONS OF TAURUS AND OSIRIS It would beunreasonable to assume that the Cro-Magnon would not have observed the heavensor the illusory patterns formed by the alignment of various stars. Depictions ofthe various constellations, such as Taurus and Orion, and \"mythologies\"surrounding them, are of great antiquity, and it appears that similar patternswere observed by the Cro-Magnon people.[images/00110.jpg][images/00111.jpg](Upper Right / Lower Left) The \"Sorcerer\"Trois-Frères cave. (Upper Left / Lower Right)Constellation of Orion/Osiris.Consider, for example the \"Sorcerers\" or \"Shamans\" wearing the horns of a bull,and possibly representing the constellation of Taurus; a symbol which appearsrepeatedly in Lascaux, the \"Hall of the Bulls\" and in the deep recesses of otherunderground cathedrals dated from 18,000 to 30,000 B.P. And above the back ofone of these charging bulls, appears a grouping of dots, or stars, which manyauthors believe may represent the Pleiades which is associated with Taurus.These Paleolithic paintings of the bull appear to be the earliest representationof the Taurus constellation.[images/00112.jpg][images/00113.jpg](Top) The main freeze of the bulls in the Lascaux Cave in Dordogne. There is agroup of dots on the back of the great bull (Taurus) which may represent six ofthe seven stars of the Pleiades (the seven sisters). As stars are also inmotion, not all would be aligned or as bright or dim today, as was the case20,000 to 30,000 years ago.In the \"modern\" sky, the constellation of Orisis/Orion the hunter, faces Taurus,the bull; and these starry patterns would not have been profoundly different20,000 to 30,000 years ago. In ancient Egypt, dating back to the earliestdynasties (Griffiths 1980), Osiris was the god of death and of fertility andrebirth, who wore a a distinctive crown with two horns (later symbolized asostrich feathers at either side). He was the brother and husband of Isis.According to myth, Orisis was killed by Set (the destroyer) and dismembered.Isis recovered all of his body, except his penis. After his death she becomespregnant by Orisis. The Kings of Egypt were believed to ascend to heaven to joinwith Osiris in death and thereby inherit eternal life and rebirth, symbolized bythe star Sirius (Redford 2003). The Egyptian \"King list\" (The Turin King List)goes backward in time, 30,000 years ago to an age referred to as the \"dynasty ofgods\" which was followed by a \"dynasty of demi-gods\" and then dynasties ofhumans (Smith 1872/2005).Over 20,000 years ago, the 6ft tall Cro-Magnon, with their massive brain onethird larger than modern humans, painted a hunter with two horns who had beenkilled. And just as the constellation of Orion the hunter faces Taurus, so toodoes the dead Cro-Magnon hunter who has dismembered/disembowled the raging bull.And below and beneath the dead CroMagnon hunter, another bird, symbol ofrebirth, and perhaps symbolizing the star Sirius.[images/00114.jpg]The constellation of Osiris (Orion the hunter) in Egyptian mythology is the godof the dead who was dismembered; but also represents resurrection and eternallife as signified by the star Sirius.

CONCLUSIONSComplex mortuary rituals and belief in the transmigration of the soul, of aworld beyond the grave, has been a human characteristic for at least 100,000years. The emergence of spiritual consciousness and its symbolism, is directlylinked to the evolution of the temporal and frontal lobes and to the Neanderthaland Cro-Magnon.These ancient peoples were capable of experiencing love, fear, and mystical awe,and they carefully buried those they loved and lost. They believed in spiritsand ghosts which dwelled in a heavenly land of dreams, and interned their deadin sleeping positions and with tools, ornaments and flowers. By 30,000 yearsago, and with the expansion of the frontal lobes, they created symbolic ritualsto help them understand and gain control over the spiritual realms, and createdsigns and symbols which could generate feelings of awe regardless of time orculture.Because they believed souls ascended to the heavens, the people of thePaleolithic searched the heavens for signs. They observed and symoblicallydepicted the association between woman and the moon, patterns formed by stars,and the relationship between Earth, the sun, and the four seasons.The ancestry and origins of the Cro-Magnon peoples, are completely unknown.There are no transitional forms that link them with Neanderthals or the stillprimitive \"early modern\" peoples of the Middle Paleolithic who were decidedlymore archaic in appearance as compared to Cro-Magnons. Neanderthals did notevolve into Cro-Magnons, and they coexisted for almost 15,000 years, untilfinally the Neanderthals disappeared from the face of the Earth, around 30,000years B.P. (Mellars, 1996). Indeed, the Neanderthals were of a completelydifferent race; and not just physically, but genetically, for when they diedout, so too did their genetic heritage and almost all traces of their DNA(Conrad & Richter 2011; Harvati & Harrison 2010).Since Cro-Magnons shared the planet with Neanderthals during overlapping timeperiods it certainly seems reasonable to assume that the technologically andintellectually superior Cro-Magnons probably engaged in wide spread ethniccleansing and exterminated the rather short (5ft 4in.), sloped-headed, heavilymuscled Neanderthals, eradicating all but hybrids from the face of the Earth,some 35,000 to 28,000 years ago.(Left) Neanderthal. (Right) Cro-Magnon.Presumably, the evolutionary lineage of the Cro-Magnon is linked to theevolution of \"early modern\" archaic humans who first appeared in what is now theMiddle East around 100,000 years ago. In contrast, to Neanderthals, the frontalportions of the craniums of \"early modern\" archaics, were rounded, indicating anexpansion of the frontal lobes (Joseph 1996). In addition, these archaics beganengaging in mortuary rites before the Neanderthals. For example, archaic H.sapiens and \"early moderns\" were carefully buried in Qafzeh, near Nazareth andin the Mt. Carmel, Mugharetes-Skhul caves on the Western coast of the MiddleEast over 90,000 to 98,000 years ago (McCown 1937; Smirnov 1989; Trinkaus 1986).This includes a Qafzeh mother and child who were buried together, and an infantwho was buried holding the antlers of a fallow deer across his chest. In anearby site equally as old (i.e. Skhul), yet another was buried with themandible of a boar held in his hands, whereas an adult had stone tools placed byhis side (Belfer-Cohen and Hovers 1992; McCown 1937). \"Early modern,\" and other\"archaic\" Homo sapiens commonly buried infants, children, and adults with tools,grave offerings, and animal bones.However, it was not until the evolution of the Cro-Magnon and the expansion ofthe frontal lobes that symbolic representations of religious and spiritualfeelings literally became an art. The spiritual belief systems of the Cro-Magnonand other peoples of the Upper Paleolithic, completely outstripped those oftheir predecessors in complexity, originality, and artistic and symbolicexpression. Hence, the Cro-Magnon conception of, and ability to symbolicallyexpress the spirit world, became much more complex as well, undergoing what hasbeen described as a \"symbolic explosion\". As the brain and man and womanevolved, so too did their spiritual beliefs.The Cro-Magnon were taller and had a larger brain than Neanderthals and modernhumans.[images/00115.jpg]Comparison of modern human skull superimposed on Cro-Magnonskull (Left). Cro-Magnon skull (Right). The Cro-Magnon brain was 1/3 larger onaverage, than the modern human brain.With a massive frontal lobe and a brain one third larger than modern humans, the6ft tall Cro-Magnons were intellectual giants, as the remnants of theircreations attest. What they might have been capable of mentally, what they mayhave achieved is unknown to us, except indirectly, through what today isclassified as \"myth.\"What is known for fact is the people of the Paleolithic were among the greatesthunters, craftsmen, and artists to have walked this Earth. It is these peoplewho were the first to develop complex beliefs involving spirits, souls,sorcerers, shamans, goddesses, and the moon, and sun, and the stars which shinein the darkness of night.Spiritual consciousness first began to evolve 100,000 years ago. It is thisconsciousness of the spirit, and belief in the transcendence of the soul, whichgave birth to the first heavenly cosmologies over 20,000 years ago.References Akazawa , T & Muhesen, S.
