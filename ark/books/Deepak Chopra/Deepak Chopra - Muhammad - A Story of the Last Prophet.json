Muhammad has suffered under centuries ofdisapproval outside the Muslim world. Ours is not the first age to reactsuspiciously when told by adherents that “Islam” means “peace.” That suspiciononly turns darker when extremist jihadis become terrorists in Muhammad’s name.In his own lifetime, the Prophet fought strenuously against his opponents andled armies into battle for the new faith. I grew up in India among Muslimfriends, but even there, where mingled cultures and religions are an ancient wayof life, the partition of Pakistan in 1947 led to riots and mass murder on bothsides. In the name of truth, believers can easily trample love and peace.None of that came as a surprise, however. I was determined to be fair toMuhammad and see him as he saw himself in seventh-century Arabia—we can locatehis birth in 570 CE, in the middle of Europe’s Dark Ages, two centuries beforeCharlemagne was crowned emperor by the pope in 800, almost six hundred yearsbefore the spires of Chartres cathedral first pointed heavenward in the twelfthcentury. That’s where the surprise occurred, because among all the founders ofthe great world religions, Muhammad is the most like us.Muhammad saw himself as an ordinary man. His relatives and neighbors didn’t partand make way when he walked down the parched dirt streets of Mecca. He wasorphaned by the age of six, but otherwise nothing exceptional stands out otherthan his ability to survive. Because he existed in a fiercely tribal society,Muhammad had numerous cousins and other males of the Hashim clan surrounding himas his extended family. There was no mark of divinity on him (except thoseinvented by later chroniclers as Islam prospered and spread). He grew up to be amerchant who happened to marry well, taking a rich widow, Khadijah, as his wife,even though she was fifteen years his senior. He traveled in caravans to Syriaone season and Yemen the next. Mecca owed its prosperity to the caravan trade.Even though these sojourns were beset with danger—Muhammad’s handsome, favoredfather, Abdullah, had died on his way home from one trip—merchants of Muhammad’sclass routinely made journeys across the desert that lasted several months at atime.What is extraordinary is that there are so many marks of common humanity inMuhammad’s transformation. Jesus is being exalted when he is called the Son ofMan; Muhammad deliberately blends in when he calls himself “a man among men.” Hecould neither read nor write, but that was common enough, even among thewell-to-do. He had four daughters who survived birth and two sons who died ininfancy. Doing without an heir was unthinkable, and so he took the unusual stepof adopting a freed slave boy, Zayd, as his son. Otherwise, it is inexplicablethat God should reach down into a settled husband and father’s life to speakthrough him. The most remarkable fact about Muhammad is that he was so much likeus, until destiny provided one of the greatest shocks in history.In the year 610 CE, Muhammad, a forty-year-old businessman known as Al-Amin,“the trustworthy,” marched down from the mountains—or in this case a cave in thesemi-verdant hills surrounding Mecca—looking shattered and frightened. Afterliterally hiding under the covers to regain his wits, he gathered the few peoplehe could trust and announced something unbelievable. An angel had visited him inthe cave, where Muhammad regularly went to escape the corruption and distress ofMecca. He sought peace and solitude, but both were destroyed when Gabriel, thesame archangel who visited Mary and guarded Eden with a flaming sword after Godbanished Adam and Eve, abruptly ordered Muhammad to “recite.”The precise word is important, because “to recite” is the root word of Koran (orQur’an). Muhammad was thunderstruck at this angelic command. He wasn’t someonewho joined in the practice of public recitation, for which the Bedouin werefamous. As a boy he had been sent to live with nomadic tribes in the desert, acommon practice among prosperous Meccans. It was felt that the purity andhardship of desert life was good for a child. At the very least it took him awayfrom the foul air and depraved city ways of Mecca. Among the Arabs the Bedouinwere considered to speak the purest Arabic, but for the rest of his lifeMuhammad would betray his sojourn among the nomads, which lasted from his birthto the age of five, by having a rustic accent. The Bedouin were also famous asstorytellers. They recited long legendary tales in praise of tribal heroes whoconducted daring raids to seize camels and women from their warring neighbors.But Muhammad sat on the periphery as a listener rather than a participant, andhe remained mute, so far as history is concerned, up to the moment when Gabrielfound him.The angel couldn’t persuade Muhammad easily. He had to lock him in a tightembrace three times—a mythical, mystical number—before he agreed to recite. Whatcame out of the Prophet’s mouth were not his own words. To him and to those whobegan to believe his message, the fact that Muhammad had never recited in publicproved that his words came from Allah. To this day, the Arabic in which theKoran is couched is singular, creating its own style and expressive world.Outside Islam, the only suitable comparison is probably the King James Bible,whose language resonates with English speakers as if spoken by either God or achosen one who had been gifted with a divine level of utterance.Because Muhammad never expected to be divinely inspired, the more tragic oursuspicion and fear of Islam today. The pre-Islamic world feels much farther awaythan even the world of the Old Testament. Slaves were kept and cruelly abused.So were women, and unwanted baby girls were routinely left to die on amountainside after they were born. Arabs used knives to settle even pettyarguments, and they thought it honorable to murder men from neighboring tribes.Revenge was something to be proud of.None of these ways, barbaric as they are, belong to Arabs alone. All can befound in various other early cultures. But Islam has been branded with barbarityin a unique way, in part because, in its zeal to maintain the Prophet’s world aswell as his word, the customs of antiquity have been preserved into moderntimes. I portray Mecca as it really was, which means in all its harshness andbrutality. To lessen the impact of our modern-day judgments, I use multiplenarrators to share in telling the story. My storytellers are women and men ofevery caste, slaves and rich merchants, believers and skeptics, idol worshipersand eager followers of Muhammad’s message alike. The first people to hear theKoran had as many reactions to it as you or I would if our best friend collaredus with a tale about a midnight visit from an archangel.I didn’t write this book to make Muhammad more holy. I wrote it to show thatholiness was just as confusing, terrifying, and exalting in the seventh centuryas it would be today.After that, the other issues were fairly minor. Ornate Arab names can bedifficult for outsiders to remember, so I have minimized the number ofcharacters in the book, keeping it down to the most important. Spelling isdoubly confusing, since the same words and names are transcribed several ways. Ihaven’t been consistent here. At the risk of irritating scholars, I’ve used theold, common spelling of “Koran.” I’ve reduced long tribal names to easilyremembered ones like Abu Talib and Waraqah. And since the hamza (’) and ‘ayn(‘), for example, in a word like “Ka‘aba,” have no significance in English, I’vedone away with most of them, again in keeping with old, common usage. Ifsophisticated Arabic speakers are offended, I apologize in advance.Finally, this is a novel, not an official biography. A few events are told outof order. Characters drop in and out of sight as needed to keep the tale going.This could lead to confusion. To help orient readers, I have provided achronology of the most prominent events in the story. It is followed by asimplified family tree showing Muhammad’s ancestry and extended family. Thepeople who appear as characters in this novel are printed in boldface, for easeof recognition.An author has no business coaxing his readers into how they should respond. Ican tell you, however, that what drew me to this story was my fascination withthe way in which consciousness rises to the level of the divine. This phenomenonlinks Buddha, Jesus, and Muhammad. Higher consciousness is universal. It is heldout as the ultimate goal of life on earth. Without guides who reached higherconsciousness, the world would be bereft of its greatest visionaries—fatallybereft, in fact. Muhammad sensed this aching gap in the world around him. Heappeals to me most because he remade the world by going inward. That’s the kindof achievement only available on the spiritual path. In the light of what theProphet achieved, he raises my hopes that all of us who lead everyday lives canbe touched by the divine. The Koran deserves its place as a song of the soul, tobe celebrated wherever the soul matters."},{"pageContent":"CHRONOLOGY [003-TOC.html#frontmatterpage_02](Because of the lack of verified dates, the ones listed below are approximate.)570CE: Birth of Muhammad590: Muhammad’s marriage to Khadijah, which produces four daughters, and twosons who die in infancy610(or earlier): Muhammad’s first revelation613: First public preaching615: Immigration of some Muslims to Abyssinia616–619: Muhammad’s clan, the Banu Hashim, boycotted by the Quraysh tribe619: Deaths of Khadijah and Abu Talib622: Hijra (migration) to Medina624: Battle of Badr, Muslim victory against larger Qurayshi forces; Jewishtribes expelled from Medina625: Battle of Uhud, a victory for the Quraysh that is not followed up on627: Medina besieged by Meccan army (Battle of the Trench); Qurayza Jews ofMedina massacred628: Treaty of Hudaybiyah, calling a truce with the Quraysh629: Peaceful pilgrimage to Mecca630: Mecca occupied by Muslims; tribal enemies defeated in other campaigns631: Islam accepted in many parts of Arabia632: Death of Muhammad"},{"pageContent":"MUHAMMAD: [003-TOC.html#frontmatterpage_03] A GENEALOGYimage [Images/15.gif]"},{"pageContent":"PRELUDE [003-TOC.html#frontmatterpage_04]THE ANGEL OF REVELATIONA mule can go to Mecca, but that doesn’t make him a pilgrim.God didn’t put those words in my mouth. He could have; he has a sense of humor.Those are Arabs’ words. They are a people of many words, a flood that couldfloat Noah’s ark. If you’re a stranger, you might not see that. You’d be blindedby the desert sun that bleaches bones and minds alike.The sun takes on other tasks. Drying up water holes that ran full just lastyear. Starving the whole crop of spring lambs when the grass became parched andwithered. Driving nomads in desperation to seek better pastures. And when theygot there, the sun glistened off fresh blood, because other tribes who would diewithout their pastures lay in wait to kill the nomads.But the Arabs refuse to give up. “Let’s turn it all into a story,” they said.“The cure for misery is a song.” There are other cures, but no one had the moneyto buy them.And so they set out to turn starvation into a heroic adventure. Thirst became amuse, the threat of murder a cause to boast of their bravery. Arabs and God hadin common this love of words. So when He heard a man say, in the depth of hisheart, “God loves every people on earth but the Arabs,” it was fitting that Ishould appear with one command.“Recite!”That’s all that I, Gabriel, was sent to say. One word, one messenger, onemessage. I was like a hammer knocking the bung out of a wine cask. One stroke,and wine to fill a hundred jugs spills out.And so they did from Muhammad, but not at first. If an angel could doubt, Iwould have. I spoke to the one man in Arabia who didn’t know how to recite. Hesang no songs, much less an epic. He sat on the edge of the crowd when awandering poet lifted his voice. Can you believe it? Muhammad had begged for Godto speak to him, and when God answered, he was struck dumb.Recite! What’s wrong with you? Be filled with joy. The day that was heralded isnow at hand.Not him.When I appeared, I found Muhammad in a cave on the side of a mountain.“What makes you go there?” his friends demanded. “A merchant of Mecca should betending his business.”Muhammad replied that he went up there for solace.“Solace from what?” they asked. “You think your life is any harder than ours?”They saw only a man in a purple-trimmed robe walking through the marketplace andsitting in the inns to make trades over tea. They never saw the man with shadowsin his mind. Dark thoughts hid behind a smile.One day Muhammad came home pale as a ghost. His wife, Khadijah, thought shewould have to catch him in her arms if he fell.“Do not go into the street,” Muhammad ordered. He was actually trembling.Khadijah rushed to the window, but all she saw in the street was a maidgathering bundles to carry away. The girl was crouched in the dust packing oldrags, scraps of leather, and heaps of charcoal, tying them into bundles to sellin the hill towns around Mecca.“Come away,” Muhammad exclaimed, but it was too late. Khadijah saw what he hadseen.One of the bundles moved.She closed the shutters with tears in her eyes. It could have been a cat thatneeded drowning. But Khadijah knew it wasn’t. It was one more baby girl whowould not grow up. One more forgotten corpse, small enough to hold in your hand,that no one would find on a remote hillside.Muhammad was forty, and he had seen this abomination all his life. And worse.Slaves beaten to death on a whim. Rival tribesmen bleeding in the gutter,because they spat on someone’s slipper. He did business with men who actuallycommitted such acts and who shook their heads when Muhammad spoke of how much heloved his four daughters. Muhammad smiled at his friends and their fine grownsons. Only in his heart did he ask God why his two sons had died in the cradle.Only in his heart did he say the one thing that made a difference.I will not turn my face from you, Lord, even if you kill everyone I love.God could have whispered in return, “Why believe in me, if you also blame me forthese evils?”Perhaps he did whisper such a thought. Or Muhammad might have stumbled upon iton his own. He had time to think, in those long days and nights in a tinymountain cave. He ate little, drank less. His wife worried that he might notcome home again, since bandits infested the hills outside Mecca.She was almost right. When I appeared before Muhammad, he would not recite theword of God, he would not listen, and he wouldn’t even stay put.Instead he fled the cave, running up the mountain in a frenzy of alarm. The manwho wished for God to notice him was terrified once he was noticed. Muhammadstole a glance over his shoulder. The ground was rocky, and he stumbled. The airwas filled with strange sounds. Did he hear the mockery of demons following him?Muhammad looked at the sky for answers. He wanted a way out.He remembered the cliffs at the summit of Mount Hira. Shepherd boys had to becareful to keep lambs from running too close to the edge when a vulture circledoverhead and frightened them.What is circling me now? Muhammad thought with a surge of dread.With a squeezing pressure in his chest, Muhammad gasped as he ran. He would jumpfrom the cliffs and dash his body against the rocks below. He couldn’t even prayfor rescue, since the same God who might save him was the God who was torturinghim.I didn’t ask for this. Let me go. I am nothing, a man among men.Panting and stumbling, Muhammad clutched his robe tight against the gatheringchill of Ramadan, the ninth month of the calendar. An evil month, a blessedmonth, a month of omens and signs. Arabs had argued over it as long as he couldremember. After a few minutes the glaze of panic decreased. His mind wassuddenly very clear. Muhammad looked down at his feet pounding over the groundas if they belonged to someone else. How curious—he had lost a sandal but didn’tfeel the jagged stones that cut his foot and caused it to stream blood. Thedecision to commit suicide brought a kind of comfort.Muhammad gained the summit of the mountain. He spied Mecca in the distance. Whyhad he pursued God like a falcon after a desert hare? Mecca had hundreds of godsalready. They lined the Kaaba, the sacred place, inside and out. One god forevery worshiper; one idol for every sacrifice. What right did he have to meddle?There were countless sacrifices, day after day, that lined the town’s pockets.Muhammad could almost smell the smoke from this great height.Peering down at the rocks below, he trembled. In that moment of his destruction,Muhammad found a prayer that might save him.Dear God, in your infinite mercy, make me who I was before. Make me ordinaryagain.It was the one prayer God could not grant, for in that moment a man’s existencewas shattered like a wine cup carelessly trampled in a tavern. He would never beordinary again. The only thing that mattered from now on would be Muhammad’swords. The Arabs, as lovers of words, were poised. Would they love God’smessenger or revile him?Muhammad smiled faintly. A Bedouin saying had come to him: “A thousand cursesnever tore a shirt.” So why should I tear it myself? And my flesh and bones withit? he thought. The image of his body crumpled and broken on the rocks belowrepelled him.Muhammad turned away from the brink. If I’m your vessel, handle me with care.Balance me lightly. Don’t let me crack.I whispered yes. Who was I to deny him? I didn’t even ask God first.The merchant of Mecca limped with one sandal back down the slope. His tongue wasthick and clumsy. Muhammad would recite as I commanded. He would never stopreciting, even if it meant his death."},{"pageContent":"ONE [003-TOC.html#part_01]THE WATER OF LIFE"},{"pageContent":"1 [003-TOC.html#chapter_01]ABDUL MUTTALIB, “THE SLAVE”Can God’s love be so intense that it feels like hate?” I asked.“Don’t speak of God,” my son grumbled. “He isn’t thinking about us right now.”We were dragging a sledge loaded with water jugs to town. The water, which wasbrackish and warm, sloshed out whenever we struck rocky ground.“God thinks about everything, and he does it all at once. That’s what makes himGod,” I replied mildly. I looked over at my son, Abdullah, who was yoked to thesledge with a band of rope around his bare chest. It was backbreaking work, andhe was in a temper.We had drawn the worst lot when the water carriers gathered at dawn. Forty youngmen were sent by the tribes every morning to bring water into Mecca. There wereno wells in town, and so water had to be hauled from the small wells that lay onthe outskirts. Abdullah and I drew the farthest one, more than a mile away.Yoked like animals, bent low enough to eat the dust beneath our feet, we wouldbe dragging the sledge until after sundown.No one had pity for me, the old man. They all knew me as “the Slave,” and thename made them treat me with veiled contempt.“I used to think God hated me,” I said, ignoring Abdullah’s sour temper. “Mychildhood was full of poverty and woe.”“It’s a curse to be here now.”I stopped pulling and spread out my arms. “I am in Mecca, my son, delivered intoher holy gates by a miracle. What feels like hatred must be God’s love indisguise.”Abdullah grunted. He had no interest in his father’s foolish miracle. All hecared about was being awakened out of a heavy sleep to walk through the predawndarkness. He had half a mind to rebel. He was the youngest son of ten, favoredand handsome. His noble nose was so large that it touched the wine before hislips did. More than anything, though, he hated that his father, a rich man, borethe nickname “the Slave.”“If I have to listen to you,” Abdullah said petulantly, “let me walk in theshade.” Water carriers stayed in the shade of houses and walls as much as theycould, but now there was only a sliver of cool darkness, just enough for one manto creep into.“You get the shade on the way back. We tossed for it.”“On the way back the jugs are empty. It’s not fair.”I shrugged and leaned into my harness. The sun was at its highest point. Theheat burned my skin like a stove.Love that feels like hate. That riddle had been on my mind for days. To me itwas the whole mystery of life, only I hadn’t seen it before. Every curse is ablessing in disguise. Take this land of Arabia. Like a dangling jewel, it liesin the grasp of two empires. To the north the Byzantines hold out their fist, tothe east the Persians. Surely that was a curse for a defenseless, scatteredpeople like us. Yet the Arabs have never been conquered. The desert is too vast,too bleak. Wander off the trail for barely an hour, into the wasteland whereonly jinns and scorpions thrive, and you would be lucky to find your way backalive.Even there God has shown his mercy, because traders couldn’t sail around Arabia,not with pirates waiting in every cove and harbor. They were forced to marchtheir precious silk and spices across the desert to Damascus. The result wasprosperity for any town like Mecca lucky enough to be on their route. The tribespraised the gods and vowed to make sure every traveler had water when he enteredthe city. Which only led to the next curse, that the water had to be hauled inevery day, no matter how many backs it broke.On and on life goes, like a necklace where one bead is a pearl and the next onepoison.No one wants to hear me babble about it. It was only the noonday sun that mademe open my mind to my petulant son. Two nights ago, my obsessions with God’slove became inescapable, and I lay awake with anxiety like a cold fever. I hadtaken a drastic, foolish step that day. I confessed to my cousins over a bout ofwine drinking. It was at one of the tiny inns that cater to pilgrims near theKaaba, where local men also meet.“I cannot find a single blessing from God that is not also a curse,” I said.“And no curse that is not also a blessing. Why is this so?”There was silence. What was I talking about? My cousins only discuss threethings: money, women, and camels.One of them spoke up. “I lost another camel yesterday. Either my slave is fakingthe numbers, or he is letting raiding parties in for a pretty penny.”“If he was paid off, they’d take more than one camel,” observed another cousin.“Perhaps,” the first cousin replied.But I wouldn’t be put off. “You don’t care if God has cursed us? God has spokento every people but the Arabs. Are we lost children who will never find ourfather’s home again?”The company went silent again. It made them nervous to hear me say “God” insteadof “the gods.” “It is so because it is so,” remarked the oldest cousin, who getsexceptionally drunk every day and is exceptionally respected. The others nodded,and the conversation ended there.I didn’t expect an argument. The inn falls under the shadow of the Kaaba. Allthe ground around that sacred place is a sanctuary. No tribal fighting can breakout there; blood feuds were cancelled; even violent argument has been outlawed.And I am chief of his clan, after all, so my cousins give me respect bylistening with serious faces, even though they laugh at me on the inside.My confession had done me no good. I couldn’t sleep any better. Try andunderstand. I wasn’t having philosopher’s insomnia. This mystery applieddirectly to me—it would determine if my whole family survived.It all began with water, a long time ago, in the age when memory began. Afterthe raging waters of the Flood receded, and Father Noah descended from the ark,he bred a holy line of offspring. From his blood came Abraham, and from Abrahamhis firstborn son, Ishmael.Now Ishmael’s mother, Hagar, had only been a slave out of Egypt, belonging toAbraham’s wife, Sarah. Because she was barren, Sarah told Abraham to take Hagaras his second wife in order to have children. Fourteen years later, a miraclecame to pass, and Sarah became with child. She bore a son named Isaac. Afterwardshe demanded that Hagar be driven with Ishmael into the wilderness. Abrahambowed his head and obeyed.When Hagar was wandering with the young boy, she grew desperately thirsty. Therewas no shelter under the open sky and no water in sight. Searching for a fewdrops to moisten Ishmael’s parched mouth, Hagar went back and forth between thetwo hills known as Safa and Marvah. Ishmael began to cry. She was on the pointof fainting, and they both might have perished, but God took pity on Hagar. Hesent down the angel Gabriel, who touched the ground with his finger. At thatspot the earth grew dark with moisture, and then the faintest trickle of waterappeared. A miracle! Hagar bent down and drank, first cupping her palm to scoopwater up for the boy.As it is related, either Hagar or the angel said, “More. Let the watersaccumulate,” which in Arabic caused the well to be named Zamzam, “the water thataccumulates.” Mecca grew up around it. As a sign of God’s favor, Ishmael and hisheirs had sole possession of the well and the right to sell the water for alltime.When I was a boy and first heard the story, I wouldn’t have questioned amiracle. Couldn’t I walk up to the Kaaba and touch its walls, where every stoneis a miracle? Abraham had built it, the House of Allah, near where the wellbubbled up. It was exactly like the first building that Adam had put up with hisown hands, made of granite blocks and perfectly square on all sides. Arabs beganto call it Kaaba. Through every tribal war and every invader’s attempt tovanquish us, it remained the House of God, long after the well of Zamzam, oncethe perpetual spring, had disappeared, for even Zamzam had a curse upon it,although it was many generations before anyone found out.I looked over at Abdullah, who had taken to muttering under his breath. He wastwenty and brawny enough for hauling water, but this was his first time. He hadbegged me to tell him why we were doing this menial drudgery, not even allowingourselves a donkey cart. But I would say only one word, “Later.”“Take my shade,” I offered.“Your shade? Is that what you call it?” Abdullah was as proud as a rich man’sson ought to be.Ignoring the rebuke, I pushed him into the shade of a high wall that circled acourtyard. Our own courtyard was the nearest to the Kaaba, a great mark of rank.Water had made me rich, but the seasoning to the feast was the envy others feltfor me. I could taste it when I strolled to the marketplace every morning.I said, “I’ve never told you about the miracle that brought me to Mecca. It’stime you learned.”Abdullah didn’t look surprised. I had made the same speech to each of my tensons when they reached a certain age. “Your grandfather, Hashim, was the chiefof our tribe. He preciously guarded the right to haul this water, which broughthim revenue from every pilgrim and a tithe from all the other tribes in Mecca.As a boy I had no knowledge of this, because Hashim died mysteriously whiletaking a caravan to Egypt. My mother tied me up in a bundle and ran away,suddenly penniless and without friends. Hashim’s brother had claimed hisfortune. I, his oldest son, was pushed aside.”Abdullah didn’t question these events. When a woman’s husband dies, it ispermitted for his brother to inherit his property if there are no grown sons.“I grew up forsaken in a faraway town, creeping like a snake between heaven andearth. In the eyes of all Arabs I was an orphan. I was nothing. The lowest pointin life is exactly when God bestows his miracles,” I said. “Are you ready tohear mine? Without it, you wouldn’t be here, handsome as you are.”Abdullah grimaced. I was enjoying the power my story had over him. I went on.“Some years passed. My uncle, Al-Muttalib, suddenly became horribly guilty. Hehad grown wealthy from Hashim’s right to carry water, yet he had deprivedHashim’s son of his share. Guilt wouldn’t leave him alone; it was relentless.Therefore Al-Muttalib decided that this was a sign. Without a word to anyone, herode away from Mecca, found me with my mother in exile, and lifted us from thedust. He promised to treat me like a second son. Two days later I rode beforehim as Al-Muttalib reentered Mecca. Yet people couldn’t believe that this dirtyboy who couldn’t even sit up on a camel was anything but a new slave beingbrought home. On all sides they called me Muttalib’s slave: Abdul Muttalib.”“And that is our shame,” muttered Abdullah. He has always been quick to draw hisdagger if another young male ridiculed his father’s insulting nickname. Out ofhabit everyone had forgotten my real name, Shaybah, and dubbed me “the Slave.”With a grunt I leaned into my harness. I’m still strong. I’m not yet fifty.Yoked beside me, Abdullah had no choice but to keep up. For a while we silentlydragged the sledge. And he didn’t offer to surrender the shade.“I have given you knowledge today. So please answer me now. Can God’s love be sointense that it feels like hatred?” I asked.My son knew to take the question seriously. “The answer doesn’t lie with God. Itlies with your own guilt.”“Explain.”“If you cheated on my mother, maybe she would find out, maybe she wouldn’t. Butin your guilt, you could feel her love as disguised poison. And if a man killshis brother, as Cain killed Abel, his guilt might make God’s love feel likehate.”“A good reply,” I said. “But I am welcome in my wife’s bed without sin, and I’vekilled no one. I thought that being rich is a blessing, but I was a fool.”Abdullah regarded me in disbelief, but I didn’t let him interrupt. “You think myriches aren’t a curse? That’s why I came today to the gathering place to drawlots. I wanted to see for myself what this backbreaking work is like. Look atme. After half a day I’m ready to drop in the dirt and perish. Do you see whatthat means?”Abdullah had no idea what it meant, unless it was that his father perverselywanted to suffer.I read his thoughts. “For one moment forget your vanity. Even if I don’t diefrom this ordeal myself, many young men will. I’ve seen their bodies wither;they fall sick. Stronger clans will easily wipe us out, or we will die out onour own, before our time.”“What can we do, sir?” Abdullah asked, for the first time showing respect. Amongus Arabs, nothing is more important than the tribe. Ours was the Quraysh, thelargest and most powerful in Mecca, which means that its downfall is in theprayers of every other tribe. It was unbearable for Abdullah to think of hiswhole race being annihilated one day.“Zamzam,” I murmured. “That is what we will do.”“What?” My son knew the name—everyone in Mecca did—but it was as legendary asEden. He hadn’t wasted a moment thinking about the water of life, as the elderscalled it, still less what it meant to lose it.I said, “I have to find the well again. Once I do, there will be endless waterright in the heart of town. We Quraysh will no longer pay for our wealth withour lives. What do you think of that?”Abdullah was tempted to think his father had gone mad. I could see that. But hedidn’t dare say so. “You are asking God for a second miracle,” he repliedcautiously. “Perhaps that’s one too many.”I laughed. “I swear, if I am ever made chief of chiefs throughout Arabia, youwill be my ambassador. Such smooth diplomacy. Wait until the women hear you.”At this Abdullah brightened. As the handsomest of my sons, he had attractedglances from the girls all his life. But this was the first time I’d spoken ofletting him approach a woman. Marriage couldn’t be far off.We had talked so long that we were close to the cistern by now where the waterwas needed. This particular cistern was a shallow stone tank no more than eightfeet across. When we arrived, two dozen women were waiting with clay water jugson their hips. At the sight of the sledge, they let out the piercing warbled cryof tribal nomads.“There you go. More women than you can handle,” I said.I felt so wrung out that I let my vain, disgruntled son empty the heavy jugsfrom the sledge. Most of the water went to the waiting women, leaving barely twoor three inches in the cistern. A cluster of palm trees nearby would shade itenough so that the heat didn’t steal everything. I liked this place. I admiredthe palms, which survived cannily on the drops spilled by water carriers andcareless women running back to their families.I rubbed my chest where the rope harness had left burn marks. “Zamzam,” Imuttered softly. Could I really find it again? The truth is, I didn’t have thecourage to mention my mad plan to my cousins, or even my wife. The men of ourtribe would be justified in stripping away my fees. A lunatic has no businesswith sacred water rights.Maybe God himself was against me. To everyone in Mecca, Zamzam had disappearedas divine punishment. One night, long before anyone living can remember, arighteous man became outraged by the greed and insolence of the rich and impiousMeccans. No one knows his name. He furtively entered the Kaaba and stripped itof gold offerings and sacred idols. Even though Allah was God, the one and only,the tribes had forgotten him and lined the sacred place with their own gods,hundreds of them.After throwing his loot into the well, the thief covered Zamzam over with earth,burying it from sight. He uttered a prayer that the well never be found by theunrighteous. God must have listened, because when the sun came up the next day,no one could remember where Zamzam was. The rich despaired; a few even repented.But they were lost. Mecca dwindled without its precious water. The sons ofIshmael departed. The place became desolate for centuries, until the Qurayshrevived the town. They established the system of carrying water from theoutlying brackish wells. They rebuilt Mecca, provided inns for pilgrims, andmade the Kaaba a proper house of worship as before. All of which entitled themto be called the new sons of Ishmael.“Can we go home now?” asked Abdullah. His eye was fixed on a pretty maid swayingher hips as she walked away.“You won’t catch her stinking the way you do,” I said.“If the only thing that stands between me and a wife is a bath, I have noworries,” Abdullah replied, certain of what he was talking about.We wended our way home, the old man limping, leaning on the young one’sshoulder.But even dead on my feet, I heard a sound. A faint rumble that could have been amuffled voice. Somewhere, Zamzam flowed deep in the earth and was waiting to bereborn.God’s will is done in circles. No mind of man can fathom His hidden design. So,do not mock my obsession with finding the sacred well again. If I ever releaseits waters and perhaps even take possession of the gold that the thief flunginto it, will God reverse His judgment?“I beseech the blessing hidden in the curse,” I murmured.“Just as long as I’m not cursed with another day like this,” grumbled Abdullah.“You’ll go to your aunt’s house tonight,” I said. “Some young marriageable womenwill be there. Try to control yourself. We wed one at a time.”Abdullah bowed low, mumbling profuse thanks for the invitation. One visit to ahouse of women made him as pleased as stealing some spring lambs from a rivaltribe out in the hills. He began to whistle a love song.When we were about to round the corner to our house, I said, “I can make it therest of the way alone. I’ve sent word that one of your third cousins should runhere, to finish the day’s water hauling with you.”Abdullah’s smile froze."},{"pageContent":"2 [003-TOC.html#chapter_02]BASHIRA, THE HERMITIt’s important to ignore the voices. When I first came to this horrible place, Iwas afraid of going mad. But soon I wanted to go mad with every fiber of mybeing. The old monk was still alive then, and he heard voices. He said they camefrom God, but he had lost his mind years ago.The old monk spent every waking moment writing. At first I was in awe, because Ican only write my name. I was taught how by the elder brothers, so that I mightsign my contract with Christ, to be his servant for life.“What are you writing?” I asked the old monk, whose named was Celestius.“The Bible,” he replied.He gave me an irritated look. Celestius rarely spoke. The usual sound that camefrom his mouth was the crunch of his teeth on the flatbread we ate at everymeal. Our grinding stone leaves grit in the flour, and his teeth had worn downto stubs.But I must explain about the Bible. There is no Bible. The length and breadth ofArabia has never seen such a precious object, or if it has, the pagans buried itin the sand or ate it when they got truly desperate—boiled vellum might retainsome bit of lamb fat. I myself saw a Bible only once, when it was placed againstmy forehead in Damascus, the day I gave my life to Christ, our Lord.Trying to hide my disbelief, I asked Celestius, “Where is this Bible you arecopying?” He must have hidden it well. Our cave contained two straw pallets forsleeping and a clay pot for washing. All the cooking had to be done outdoors orthe smoke would choke us.Celestius assumed a crafty look. “Don’t need a Bible,” he said tapping thebrown-spotted dome of his bald head. “In here.” He smiled secretly, showing hisupper row of stubs.Well, crazy is as crazy does. If he wanted to copy the Bible out of his head, sobe it. I asked him to read a Psalm to me.“Haven’t gotten there yet,” he said. “They told me to start at the beginning.”And that was the end of the discussion. As punishment for interrupting him, herefused to acknowledge me for a month, as if I were invisible like his Bible.I used to hear the Psalms through the church windows when I was lost on thestreet in Damascus. They aren’t all about the valley of death, although therewere days I wanted to go there, starving days in the back alleys that smelled ofraw sewage. Sewage has its uses if you don’t want someone to find you.I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills,From whence cometh my help.My help cometh from the Lord,Who made heaven and earth.The Psalmist must not have seen the hills of Bostra that circle our cave.There’s no help from there.Or so I thought.One day Celestius seemed to take longer than usual to unfold his creaking limbsin the morning. I poked him but he didn’t move or let out a grunt. He had diedsometime after midnight prayers. From the way his arm lay outstretched in thedirection of my pallet, I suppose he had wanted the last rites. A bit late onthat one, my brother. I put him in the earth with a rough marker on his grave.He would keep a long time, what with the lack of rain. Eventually a caravanwould pass by carrying a Christian, and then the body could be taken back toDamascus for a proper burial.I didn’t fear loneliness. Actually, it was good to be rid of him. I love myfellow man, as Christ commands me to, but toward the end Celestius was too madto remember to dress or clean himself. I saw his bony behind once too often.After I buried the old monk, a trader from Tyre came by one day who could read,and I showed him a stack of pages from Celestius’s “Bible.” The trader laughedand said it was complete gibberish. No surprise. The only thing of interest wasthe last page. On it Celestius had written the same line over and over until hishand faltered and the letters turned to faint squiggles:When the sun’s face is hidden, God will bring his last prophet.“Are you sure that’s what it says?” I asked. Because he was my guest, the traderhad no reason to lie. I will grant the pagans one thing—they hold hospitalitysacred. I had invited him into my cave for food and drink—a proper meal, notjust flatbread and grasshoppers. I sell religious trinkets to travelers (with alittle work a goat’s shinbone can be made to look very much like a saint’s), andwith the money I buy supplies from the caravans. Dates and figs, usually, butalso honey, olives, hard cheese, and dried meat. Wine, of course, in clay jarssealed with pitch.The trader assured me that he had read the line just as it was written, but tobe certain he took the page outside, where the setting sun still imparted anamber glow to the hills. When the sun’s face is hidden, God will bring his lastprophet. Celestius wasn’t sure about the spelling of the word “prophet,” so hehad put in three versions and one of them was right, the trader told me. Thetrader said he’d be glad to read the other gibberish to me too, but that justmeant he wanted more wine. I gave him another cup out of charity, even though myheart sank inside. This man from Tyre had delivered me a world of troublewithout knowing it.God will bring his last prophet. Impossible. The old monk was simply delirious.God has already sent his only begotten Son. The prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled.Unless…Unless Jesus has forsaken us.Unless God has changed His mind.Unless the Devil has found me in the smallest, darkest, dirtiest cave on theface of the earth.What a curse when the mind hits upon that tiny exception—unless. It appears likea black mote on the far horizon. And no matter how hard you struggle, the speckgrows and grows until one day it swallows up the sky. What could I do? I prayed.I asked God for a sign. One night after thrashing in bed covered in sweat, Irose and burned all the pages the old monk had scribbled. Yet when I got to thelast one, fear gripped my heart, and I couldn’t put it to the flame. So eitherGod or the Devil has power I couldn’t resist.After that I spent my days watching the sky, waiting for the face of the sun tobe hidden. A stranger found me that way, squatting on the ground outside mycave.“Why are you staring at the sun, old one?”I looked up to see a tall, turbaned man who was as dark as his shadow. Perhapsan Abyssinian. They say that if you cross the sea to their kingdom, which isChristian by the grace of God, there are many Bibles, some covered in cloth ofgold. Maybe here was a man I could talk to.“I’m not staring at the sun,” I replied.“Good. The sun is the eye of Nabul,” he said. “You’ll go blind if you gaze intoit.”Nabul is one of their countless idols in this forsaken place. The stranger wasan unbeliever. I got to my feet, so that when I told him to go away, we’d belooking eye to eye. Then I saw something over his shoulder. A cloud had appearedin the sky out of nowhere. In this land where sand dunes roll like an endlesssea and rain falls only to moisten the graves of those who hear the LastTrumpet, there was a cloud.I pointed with my finger. “Is that your caravan, stranger?” Camels and wagonscrawled in the distance.“I travel ahead of it as a scout. Those are traders from Mecca, and not veryrich ones, either,” he replied.I barely heard the words. The cloud, which was not large, cast its ragged shadowon the earth. From up above I could see it clearly. What amazed me was this: thecloud was directly over one wagon in the caravan, and as the camels lumberedalong the trail, the cloud moved with them, always shading one particular wagon.“Who rides in that cart?” I asked.The black man shrugged. “It could be anyone,” he said. Except the slaves andservants, who were forced to walk. I could see a straggling line of them keepingpace with the camels. I counted. It was a small caravan by the standards of thegreat ones from Yemen when an engorged ship from the East has unloaded its cargoof silk, iron, perfumes, and spices. I counted no more than two dozen camels andthree donkeys.“You look pale,” remarked the stranger. The next thing I knew, I felt somethingcool and damp being pressed against my forehead. I opened my eyes and touched myface with trembling hands.“Maybe you were gazing into Nabul’s eye after all,” said the man. “You fainted.”He pressed the damp cloth to my forehead again, but I pushed him away.“I have to see,” I mumbled and staggered to the mouth of the cave. Thank God Ihad not been unconscious for long. The threadlike procession of the smallcaravan was still in sight down below. And yes, the cloud was poised directlyover one wagon. I watched until they were out of sight. Nothing changed. Theface of the sun had been hidden, and God was protecting someone with cool shade.The possibility was staggering. I had to find out who was in that wagon.For the rest of the afternoon I paced restlessly trying to think it through. TheDevil could be tempting me. I hadn’t seen the stranger walk up my hill, and Ihadn’t seen him depart. He could have been Satan’s minion, able to appear anddisappear as he was bidden. But the man hadn’t asked me to renounce God, and hedidn’t leave me lying in the sun to die when I fainted. The Adversary doesn’t dogood deeds. Then I realized that this logic was ridiculous. If the Devil hadfound me, I was lost already. He’d gnaw at my soul like a desert rat by tiny,maddening bites until he got what he wanted.In the end I waved to a village boy passing by with three skinny goats and toldhim to invite the men of the caravan to my cave for supper. He nodded and ranoff. The people around here have a superstitious regard for me. I swept the caveand brought out my best provisions. A rare mood had come over me. I whistledwhile cracking open the best wine jars, soaking the dates in water to plump themup, and throwing out any fig that had been infested with maggots. This was goingto be a kind of last supper. Either God’s word was coming true, or my soul wasabout to be snatched by madness. One way or another, the end had come.Folded up under my pallet was an embroidered cloak that signified who I was—nota filthy beggar with matted hair, but a priest. When they sent me into thedesert, the Damascene fathers presented it to me. “Never forget who you are,”the abbot said gravely. “And don’t come home until this is your winding sheet.”I smiled to myself, wrapping the scarlet cloth around my narrow shoulders. Mothshad chewed small holes in the wool, but the gold embroidery twinkled in thedimness of the cave. The cloak was still a fine thing. I sat in the midst of thefeast I had spread out and waited for sundown. Once or twice I nodded off—theaftermath of my great excitement—until I heard men’s voices coming up the hill.“Bashira. Are you he?” the head man said when he got to the mouth of the cave.These Arabs are horrible unbelievers, but they speak formally when they come asguests.I lit an oil lamp and held it close to my face. “Is there another cave waitingfor you that is set with a feast?” I asked.The glow from the lamp illuminated my scarlet robe, giving it what seemed likean inner light. The Arabs looked at each other doubtfully. They believe in allkinds of spirits, especially those who roam the desert after nightfall to suckhumans dry of their souls. But the lead man didn’t falter. Seeing the food anddrink all around me, he stepped inside with a bow.They sat in a circle and began to eat. None of them said a prayer or cared twobeans that I did. A couple of them splashed the floor with wine as offerings totheir idol. The name didn’t matter. Idols were more plentiful than horses orcattle. If you climbed a tree to escape a prowling jackal, you could turn thatinto your god if you wanted to.Being guests, the men didn’t attack the food like ravenous beasts, but ate withdignity. I sat silently and watched. Which one was the prophet? It wasn’t longbefore dignity grew thin. As the wine flowed, the talk grew louder and coarser.To them I wasn’t a holy man, so they spoke freely of women in the streets andtheir many conquests. The hours wore on. Tongues wagged, then heads nodded. ButI kept my gaze alert. Which one? The full moon had sent slanting light into thecave for the first hour, but it had long set under the stark, treeless horizon.I turned to the head man, who had seated himself on my right. He wasn’t sober,but he was still coherent.“Is there anyone here I should know in particular?”He looked puzzled, and why not? I had no words for what I wanted to say. I triedagain. “I am looking for someone favored by the gods,” I said. “Does any of yourclan have a mark upon him?”“What?” He shook his head in confusion and asked for another cup of wine. I gaveit to him and sank back into my gloomy thoughts. Not for the whole evening had Iseen a sign of God’s intentions. These were coarse, ordinary traders, driftersacross the face of the desert. Someone was toying with me.The men rose to leave, each helping the other to his feet. They staggered outinto the night, which had grown dark and thick without the moon. Torches werelit, and the head man bowed to me. He was about to turn away when he said, “Ihave put some dates and figs in my bag without asking your permission. They’refor my son. Forgive me.”I tried to keep my voice from trembling. I asked him why his son stayed away. Ihad explicitly invited every man of the caravan. He said that they had leftbehind no men. His son was still a boy. They’d left him behind to guard theanimals and raise the alarm at the first sign of raiders.“Send the boy to me,” I said. “My Lord Christ bids me to offer food to everystranger tonight, without exception.”To his superstitious mind this was logic enough, not that he had any regard forthe name of Christ. The head man gathered his homespun skirts about him and satdown on the ground after barking orders at one of the others. His men bowed anddeparted down the hill.“Actually, I’m happy you called for Muhammad,” he said. “I felt guilty leavinghim alone when one of the slaves could have watched over everything.”I remarked that I’d never seen a boy on caravan. They were dangerous affairs,weren’t they?He sighed. “Just so. My tribe has suffered from death in faraway countries. Ourcaravans have been cursed. Especially one time.” He was leading to a tale, butsuddenly he stopped and looked away.Half an hour later his man returned, apparently alone. But as he got closer, Isaw the outline of a small boy walking behind him. The two approached, and withbeating heart I looked at the boy’s face. He barely glanced my way, bowing tohis father.“Abu Talib, I am here to serve you,” the boy said gravely. He looked to be abouttwelve, short and compact. In the dim glow cast by the cooking fire I couldn’tsee his eyes. Only when he was told to greet his host did he turn to me, andthen his eyes were cast down to the ground.“Your father says you are called Muhammad.”It was a simple statement, but the boy hesitated before nodding his head.“Who are your people?” I asked. Before he could answer, his father interfered.He jumped to his feet and pulled him close. “To you our people are nothing, sowhy question a boy?”I looked surprised. “You act as if I might hurt your son. What is it?”“He’s precious to me. His mother died when he was just barely walking.”That wasn’t the whole story. These Arabs can take any number of wives, accordingto their custom. I had a burning need to know about this boy, and so I asked Godwhat to say before he was snatched away. There was only a moment left; the headman wasn’t anxious to stay. Suddenly I saw the truth.“He isn’t your son,” I said flatly “You’ve been lying. Why?” My voice was clearand strong. “I am asking you as a holy man. God has told me something important,but first I must know the truth.”The head man grew nervous. A strange thing about the Arabs is that they respectthe name of God, despite all their idols. It’s not something they freely talkabout, but I’ve been told that they know there is only one God. There was a timewhen their worship was pure. They even look to Abraham as their father. But overtime they fell into idolatry.“I need the truth,” I repeated. “Who are you, Abu Talib?”“I am his uncle and head of the clan,” Abu Talib admitted with reluctance. “Mylie wasn’t a sin. I am the boy’s protector.”“So he’s an orphan?”Abu Talib nodded, and the boy drew closer to him, folding his small body intohis uncle’s robe. I knelt down. “Muhammad, a caravan is a dangerous venture, butyou’re safe here. Will you speak with me? I implore you. Your fate is important.Or do you know that already?”I put my forehead to the ground, as if addressing a superior. That wouldfrighten an ordinary boy or make him burst out laughing, but Muhammadstraightened up.“What I know is my concern, not yours,” he said.“No, boy,” his uncle said sharply, then turned to me. “Forgive him. His father,Abdullah, was proud.”“My concerns are God’s, and he takes no offense. Yet I still need to speak toyou.” I kept my words and my eyes fixed on the boy.He pondered for a moment.“Are you asking your gods to decide for you?” I asked.I named Al-Uzza, one of their female idols—a bitch goddess they pray to forfertility—whose name I had once overheard.The boy scowled.“She isn’t your favorite? She’s beautiful and has large breasts,” I pointed out.“Mocking me will only make me run away,” he replied. “I won’t touch any idols orperform their rites. ““Why not?”“If you’re a holy man, you already know. There is no God but God.”My heart jumped in my chest, and I had to hold my arms tight around myself tokeep from reaching out to this strange child. If only he stood closer to thefire, so I could see his eyes. They would tell me. Abu Talib was gazing proudlyat his nephew.“He is special,” I said, and he nodded. His uncle had no idea. None of them did.Their caravan would be moving on before dawn. Whatever I had to say, it had tobe at that moment. Boldness was the only way.“I know about you, far more than you imagine,” I said. I put my hand on hisshoulder and pulled him away from his uncle. Abu Talib could have taken seriousoffense, but he didn’t move. I led Muhammad to a bowl-shaped depression in theground. It was as far around as a man could stretch out and three hands deep.“Can you guess who dug that hole? A crazy man. He was living in this cave beforeI came here. If I hadn’t dragged him away, he would have clawed at the earthuntil his hands bled. He died one night without recovering his wits.” I wasn’tlying. Toward the end Celestius had forsaken the Bible and became obsessed withdigging where his voices told him to. I tried to coax him out of his madfixation, but he still managed to dig a sizable hole.The boy’s eyes widened with curiosity. “Why?”“He thought the water of life was down there, and he had to find it.”Muhammad pointed to the jugs of water lined up at the mouth of the cave. “Youmean them?”I shook my head. “No, the villagers haul that up to me. The water of lifedoesn’t flow out of the ground. It flows from here.” I lightly touched his chestover the breastbone. “You were born in the desert, but it’s a fearful place forme and every holy man. We come here for only one reason, to find the water oflife.”“And did you find it?” he asked solemnly.“Not for many, many years. The old monk who scratched at the earth had lost hismind. He despaired of ever finding it. But tonight my quest may be over.”Muhammad listened calmly, as if this all made perfect sense to him. His unclewas now visibly agitated. Unable to keep quiet, he burst in. “My family foundit. The well was buried for centuries. But a dream came to my father, Abdul. Hesaw the very spot where Zamzam lay under the ground. He was our savior, blessedbe his name.”In an excited voice he unfolded the tale, and even with a mongrel blend of Greekand Arabic, the tongues of traders, I understood. This well they call Zamzam waspromised to them by God at the time of their ancestors, and it was to flow aslong as time. But God became angry when the people turned to idol worship, andhe made the well disappear. Mecca could have been a great city glorifying hisname. Instead, God granted it only enough water to survive, and that had to beobtained by hard labor.Abu Talib’s father, “the Slave” as he was known, became obsessed with findingZamzam. Some say he secretly swore an oath to sacrifice one of his sons if thegods showed him where to dig. Others say that he converted back to the one Godof their ancestors. Whichever it was, Abdul was given a dream. He saw a spotbetween two of the largest idols, near to their house of pagan worship, theKaaba. Everyone in his tribe laughed at him, but the Slave insisted on diggingeverywhere around that spot. Lo and behold, one day a man thrust his spade intothe ground and hit something hard. It was a well cover, and when they removedit, water came forth. Zamzam had been found again, along with the golden hoardand idols that had been stolen from the Kaaba. Abdul returned them, keeping onlya portion of the booty for himself.Abu Talib stuck out his chest as he finished his tale. “So you see, my peoplehave found the water of life. God showed it to us.”“God’s works are mysterious,” I said mildly.His eyes narrowed. “You don’t believe me?”I had a polite answer on my tongue, but the boy Muhammad spoke up. “The well wasa sign, sir. There is water no one can see, that never wets anyone’s lips.That’s what the holy man means.”The uncle looked confused, torn between anger at being called a liar and pridein his precocious nephew.“Not just a sign,” I said hurriedly. “A great sign. God has showered blessingson your tribe.”You’d think the uncle would have been pleased to hear this; after all, he hadjust said the same thing. Instead, his face darkened. “My father, Abdul, used toswear that God’s love is hard to tell from his hate. His favorite son, mybrother Abdullah, died from a sudden sickness while coming home with a caravan.When we heard about it, messengers and physicians were rushed to him, but he hadalready been buried, no more than two days journey from his wife. They had beenmarried only two months. She perished from grief, and now, but two years ago, myfather followed them. If you really are a holy man, find the blessing in that.”The blessing is that you brought this boy to me.Hiding my thoughts, I mumbled again that God’s works are mysterious, and AbuTalib nodded sadly. This talk had unfolded many things close to his heart.Between that and the wine, he seemed to trust me, so I held tight to Muhammad’srough wool cloak and pulled him near the fire. He didn’t object, and for thefirst time I could look into his eyes.Ah.“What do you see? Is he cursed too?” asked the uncle gloomily. “I took in mybrother’s son after he was orphaned. I’ve always tried to keep him safe.” “Youhaven’t protected him well enough,” I warned.“No, don’t say that! Only one good thing came from Abdul’s dying. It broke hisheart to lose Abdullah. He couldn’t bear it if Muhammad will be snatched awaytoo.”Abu Talib had misunderstood my meaning, but the boy didn’t. He allowed me tokeep gazing into his eyes. He was willing to let me see. Suddenly I couldn’tkeep back the tears. I began to weep silently, turning away so that the two ofthem might not notice.“It’s all right,” Muhammad whispered. He laid his hand gently on my gray head,as if we had changed places and now I was the boy, he the man.The uncle became even more alarmed at my behavior. “Tell me!” he cried.There was no explaining my anguish. I felt my faith slip away from under me likesand under my feet. Where was my Lord? What would become of us poor seekers inthe wilderness, waiting these long centuries?I regained control and turned to Abu Talib.“Pardon me. There is no curse. You must protect this boy as if he were your mostprecious possession. He is God’s.”The uncle looked astonished, not just by my words, but by the calmness inMuhammad. “You still haven’t told me what you saw.”“A light. Here.” I put my finger lightly on the space between the boy’seyebrows.I waited for the uncle to protest. Instead, he froze, and his head trembled. Heturned to the boy. “Go.” The word came out as a hoarse croak. He pointed towardthe bottom of the hill, where the man who had brought Muhammad from camp waswaiting in the dark to take him back.Muhammad bowed without saying anything and left. When he was out of earshot, AbuTalib recovered the power of speech.“There’s a secret the boy doesn’t know,” he said. “He was born nine months tothe day after Abdullah got married. My brother never saw him. Before he set outon the journey from which he never returned, Abdullah took me aside. He had apremonition, and he begged me to take care of his son. I was astonished, for noone knew that Aminah, his bride, had already conceived.“Why come to me?” I asked. “There was our father, a wealthy man, to take care ofhis grandsons. And besides, of my father’s ten sons, we all knew who hisfavorite was.”Abu Talib paused and waved his hand. “Never mind. It’s all in God’s hands. ButAbdullah had a guilty conscience. That was his real reason for seeking me out inprivate. On his wedding day, he told me, he was walking to Aminah’s house forthe ceremony. My brother, being blessed with a handsome face, was used to womenand their come-hither looks. And why not? He gave in more than once. On this daya married woman spied him from her window above the street. She became instantlyenamored of this handsome groom and cried out for him to lie with her. Mybrother was no prude, but he was shocked. Her lustful call could be heard up anddown the street. Even more shocking, she ran downstairs in her bare feet andapproached him in the street, snatching at his scented robes. ‘I must lie withyou now, this very minute,’ she pleaded. With difficulty Abdullah tore himselfaway, and an hour later he was married in Aminah’s house, to great rejoicing.“Men are only flesh. Even you, a holy man, must admit this, unless God hascompletely neutered you. That night Abdullah embraced his bride, but the nextday at dawn he saw the face of the married woman. She was beautiful, and mybrother felt a wave of lust overtake him. He fought it. He almost woke up hisbride. Instead, he sneaked out of the house and ran back to the street where themarried woman lived. The sun wasn’t yet up. The cobblestones were cool under hisfeet. ‘I must be crazy,’ he thought. But he threw pebbles at the windowshutters, and luckily for him, the woman heard instead of her husband. She stuckher head out and said, ‘What do you want? Can’t honest people sleep without thelikes of you coming around, dog?’ Abdullah was astonished at this change ofbehavior, and not a little offended. As I say, he was used to the attention ofwomen. He threw a rock at her and demanded to know what had changed her mind.‘Yesterday when you came prancing down the street, you had a light between youreyes,’ she said. ‘It was as bright as a flame at midnight. I wanted that lightfor my child, but now you have slept with another, and her child has theblessing. Go away and leave me alone.’”The uncle’s agitation had hardly subsided as he recounted this story. “Abdullahnever told that story to anyone but me. Is it true? Has the light been passed toMuhammad?”There was no need for me to say anything, only to give the slightest nod. Forsome reason the pain in my heart had lessened. If God was bringing the lastprophet, His will be done. It was left for me to pray and count my final days,which I am sure will be few. At least I was safe. The Devil hadn’t been toyingwith me.The uncle was anxious to get back to camp. He bowed to me and started down thetrail. The horizon was just lighting up with the palest blue, not often seen bytowns people but every day by a hermit who rises to pray five times a night. Icould make out the faint shape of Abu Talib’s silhouette as he hurried down thestony path beyond the reach of the cooking fire, which had dwindled to embers.Abu Talib would remember to take special care of the boy. Of that I am certain.That, and one more thing. Muhammad would never forget the water of life."},{"pageContent":"3 [003-TOC.html#chapter_03]HALIMAH, THE WET NURSEI knew it was him kneeling beside my bed. I felt the breeze as he brought thefan close to my face. The palm frond made a soft swishing sound. My eyes wereswollen shut by the fever, which is why I didn’t see him come in.“Who’s the only woman in your life, Muhammad?” I asked.“You are.”I smiled through cracked lips. “You’re becoming a man if you can lie like that.”We could talk this way, you see, after so many years. The next thing I felt wasa cold dampness. He had brought a bowl of water with him and was pressing acloth to my eyelids, trying to unseal them. They were gummy and swollen. Onlythe fan managed to keep the flies away.“Do you remember how small my breasts were?” I mused.“Ssh. Drink this.”Muhammad squeezed the cloth so that drops of water fell on my lips. “What kindof water do you call this?” I grumbled.“Holy water, from Zamzam.”I would have spat it back into the bowl if I wasn’t dying of fever. There is noholy water in Mecca, I told him, only expensive water. He didn’t have the moneyto waste.They brought in a doctor with smudge pots last week to beat back the fever. Heburned some dung chips and threw fresh herbs on them to create a thick, sweetsmoke. That cost money too. You don’t get decent behavior unless you pay, exceptin the desert.“Give me my purse,” I said. I wanted to pay Muhammad back for the water hesquandered his coins on. In his grandfather’s day the tribes paid their familyfor water. Not any more. There had been fierce arguing after “the Slave” died.Now gangs of scowling Qurayshi youths circle the well, holding it hostage untilthe disputes are settled. Will they ever be?“Don’t worry,” said Muhammad, refusing any money. Seeing that I could drink alittle, he held the bowl up to my mouth and tipped it. “Between you and me, Isaw a pilgrim who had left a half-full jug on a window sill. I stole some of hiswater.”I tried to laugh in disbelief, but my throat tightened up, and the laugh turnedinto a croak. “If you stole, then I marched into the Kaaba and ran away with abig black ram.” I painted a picture for Muhammad of what the ram and I did whenwe got home.“Don’t talk like that,” he said.I don’t know why I liked to make him blush. Maybe it made me feel more like hismother, poor soul. I reached up to see if his cheek was hot with embarrassment.I felt something else. A beard was coming on. I turned my head away.“What’s wrong?” he asked.The young never understand the sadness of growing up. They’re too busy doing it.At least my eyes were too swollen to show tears. I said, “Do they still let youtease the girls?” That would be forbidden once he had a real beard.“I don’t tease.”“Oh, then you’re holier than your precious water.”There was a loud knock on the door, but nobody came in. Only one visitor a daywas allowed. Doctor’s orders, to keep the contagion from spreading. Muhammadopened the door a crack, and I heard two male voices. They were impatient. Onetried swearing a little. He was just a boy, like Muhammad, but he needed topractice cursing the same way he needed to examine his fuzzy beard every morningto see how it was getting on.Muhammad had many cousins. At least he enjoyed a scrap of good fortune. I didn’tknow all their names. His father, the cursed Abdullah, had nine brothers, sothere was an army of cousins for him to run with on the streets. That would goon after teasing the girls had ended. Growing up never stops a man from prowlingthe alleys.I lifted my hand to my breasts. Of course Muhammad didn’t remember how smallthey were that year. He was barely out of the womb. But it was thanks to smallbreasts that he came to me.Fifteen years ago we made our way to town, as the desert tribes do every spring.The men had lambs to sell and the yarn spun by the women over the winter. Theygathered around the Kaaba, and the elders, who were trusted with the money,gathered at the inns. They bartered all day, arguing in loud voices. Every oncein a while somebody told a joke, and then the tension was relieved by laughter.You hear those filthy jokes all over the world, and the same laughter. Indecencyis how men know that they are men.Women didn’t go into the inns, but we had our own business. We sat at the gatesof the rich families, holding out our babies and waiting. It was for the milk,you see. City women have babies, but they don’t give them the breast. It’s notbecause they’re lazy and pampered and don’t want sore nipples. They’re worried.Living in a city like Mecca, where breathing the air is the same as breathing incontagion, they had to be careful. So every spring we came in from the desert tooffer our breasts. That was the custom and still is, although it’s on thedecline. It’s a wonder the air in the city doesn’t kill all the babies beforethey take their first step.The newborns were put in baskets tied to the sides of the camels, and we tookthem back to the desert to nurse. In two years time we returned with them, andthen the city women, overjoyed to have their children fat and healthy, showeredus with coins and gifts. If you ever see a Bedouin woman with silk around herhead, you know she’s nursed a baby, maybe twins if she is wearing gold earrings.I had my own boy baby to show them that spring, but times were bad. There hadbeen no rain for months. Everyone’s breasts dried up. Mine were half the sizethey should have been, shrunk like dried dates. I wrapped my robe around myselfand held my arms crossed so no one would notice. Who was I fooling? My own babywas shriveled and crying, desperate for the little milk I had. The spoiled richwomen walked straight past me without a glance. I spent three days wanderingfrom courtyard to courtyard, without luck. My husband told me to keep trying,but what was the use? We needed the money, of course.“Muhammad?” I couldn’t hear voices at the door and thought he might have slippedout.“Just here. Don’t worry.”He was by my side again. He pushed up my sleeves and began to wash my arms. Wekept quiet. For a boy to do that, washing a woman’s arms…Some people would havefrowned, even if I was his milk-mother.“Open the shutters. It’s too hot. It’s like a tomb,” I said.“You know I can’t do that. It would ruin everything.”The doctor with the smudge pots said that the room had to be kept closed andhot, to drive the fever out. I knew no better. In my delirium, I couldn’t evenremember being taken to this room. It was small and close; it smelled foul. ButMuhammad had no money. With both his parents gone, and now his uncle Abu Talib,he had no right to any fortune. He took what room they gave him for my sickroom.I wanted to grumble some more, just to hear his voice, but suddenly I was tooexhausted. I let my head loll on the pillow while Muhammad finished my arms.His mother, Aminah, was the only one who didn’t shun me the year of my smallbreasts. The whole town knew about her. Her husband died in caravan, barely twodays away from home. Strangers put him in the ground immediately. She never gotto throw herself onto his body. I don’t think she would have. Her female cousinsgathered at her gate to wail with her, but Aminah was a silent widow. No one hadseen such a thing. A two-month bride robbed of the best husband in the city? Shehad to be in shock, they said.But Aminah could still think. She knew she was being stalked like soft prey.Fate had fixed its eyes upon her. None of the other Bedouin women would come toher house. She didn’t have a brass coin to pay for their breasts.A shadow appeared over me, and it was Aminah. “I have a new baby. Will you comein?” she said in a soft voice. I was squatting at her gate and was almost asleepfrom fatigue and thirst.We drank tea without a word. Why speak? We knew we needed each other. I wouldn’tbeg, and neither would she.After a while she said politely, “You’re slender.”“In our tribe, Banu Sa’d, we work too hard to get fat. Our men are used to it bynow,” I replied.I knew what she meant. I loosened my robe and casually bent over the teapot,pretending to wonder if it had steeped too long. She could see for herself thatmy breasts didn’t hang as fat as they should have.“May I have two years?” Aminah asked. She had such a small voice, even in herown home. Perhaps she was naturally timid. Or the eyes of fate had broken her.Two years was the normal time for nursing a baby in the desert. As a precautionI asked to see the baby. She brought it out in swaddling clothes. She said thecloth was soiled and pulled it away. I saw that the baby, tiny and red as askinned rabbit, had male parts. You understand?There is another kind of “mother” who comes to the gates of the rich. It doesn’tmatter what her milk is like, because they hand her an infant wrapped in blackcloth, its face covered from sight. Women are weak, even in the desert. If youcarry a baby away to leave on the mountainside—always a girl baby—seeing itsface might soften your heart. But what good would it do to save them? The boysgrow up to a hard life, and many will die before they travel on their firstcaravan. Some will never return. A surplus of virgins and widows is the lastthing anyone needs. My husband asked if I would serve as such a “mother.” I toldhim I’d rather kill myself. We have a daughter ourselves, don’t we?The contract took only an hour to seal. First I rushed back to camp outside thetown walls and got permission from my husband to take the widow’s baby. A verygrudging permission.“After two years you’ll be lucky to get a silver ring out of it,” he said.“I’m doing this even if I get her cast-off sandals,” I replied.We argued. I insisted. He frowned, but what can you do? We’d get nothing if Ileft without a baby.After Aminah had cried a little, the Banu Sa’d passed the city walls attwilight, heading for the open desert. I don’t know how sailors feel when theysmell the sea again, but it must be like how I feel when I can smell the desert.A funny expression, for in truth you can’t smell anything. When the last whiffof rancid smoke, sewage, and dung is out of your nostrils, you are in thedesert, where the life is as pure as the air. For the next two years Muhammadnever smelled corruption, or saw a house wall for that matter. MY BREASTS SWELLED when I began to nurse the new baby. The other women becamejealous. They spread rumors that I was feeding him camel’s milk. I cornered theworst shrew and showed her my breast.“See? It got big on its own,” I told her and made clear what I would do if shekept up her accusations. The next thing you know, they’ll say I made a pact withdemons. How could I tell them that it was the baby who brought me so much milk?The udders of the goats and camels also swelled, but no one would believe me ifI told them. Milk in the middle of a drought. Who can say why?“I must go,” Muhammad said.His voice brought me back from my fever dreams. I didn’t know how long I hadslept. The blackness in that horrible little room was the same, day or night.Muhammad put his hand on my brow. “Lie still. I won’t be long. What can I bringyou?”“Bring me the stars,” I mumbled.Which sounds like I was delirious, but he smiled. Any Bedouin would.One morning soon after, Muhammad found me sitting up in bed, and when he felt mybrow, it was cool and dry. The first thing I wanted wasn’t food, even though Iwas starving. I wanted to be carried outside. Muhammad fetched two of hiscousins, and they carried my bed into a dirty courtyard shaded by palm trees. Iwas puzzled. Why hadn’t my people come to carry me?“The contagion is worse. They had to leave,” said Muhammad soberly.I asked how bad it was. He said people were dying too fast to be buried. Thetribes were stacking up corpses outside the city walls. So it was right for mypeople to flee. They had no reason to lose their lives waiting to see if minemight be saved. Muhammad had girl cousins too, and they brought me millet gruelwith lamb in it for strength. They were pretty girls, and gossips. Their chatterwas meant to cheer me up, but I sent them away. I didn’t need cheering. Hearingthe wind in the palms was better than a chorus of blessed spirits.We Bedouin are proud, but not so proud that we are immune to money. Sometimesforeign traders will ride into camp on half-dead horses. They empty their pursesfor a goatskin of water and a guide to the next oasis. Most foreigners foolishenough to cross the desert without a Bedouin don’t make it to an encampment. Wefind their remains bleaching on the dunes.The first time Muhammad saw such a sight he was no more than five. It shockedhim. A man’s body splayed out on the sand, his skin already turning toparchment, and his horse a hundred feet away, as dead as he was. The wind wasmild that day. It had filled their mouths with sand, but not yet covered theirbodies.“There’s a fool,” I said. “Letting his horse loose. Who would do that?”“He wanted to be nice,” said Muhammad innocently.I knelt down and looked him in the eye. “No horse can survive on its own outhere. What he should have done is kill the horse and climb inside its belly.That way he would have been protected for a day or two.” I knew what I wastalking about. The Banu Sa’d were close by. We would have seen the vulturescircling over the dead animal and come to see. Even after three days a man mightbe found alive inside a horse or camel. He wouldn’t be a pretty sight, but deathis much uglier.Muhammad listened, but his eyes kept wandering to the dead man, whose mouth hadgasped open in his last moments, leaving a hole for the sand to fill. You couldsee the boy wanted to ask me something, but he didn’t. I understood. Fate was atease. Young as he was, he had experienced how cruel a tease. So had his mother.At the end of two years I brought her baby back. Aminah was waiting by the gateand let loose a cry of joy when she saw us coming. Muhammad was walking onsturdy little legs by my side. Bedouin babies don’t start to walk when they wantto. They start as soon as they have to, which is very early among nomads.Hearing her cry, Muhammad drew back. He had been taught that this was a sign ofdanger. The camp is under attack when women sound the alarm. And he didn’t knowher, of course. To him, I was his mother. I bent down and slapped him hardacross the face.“Go to her. Forget me,” I said. “I hate you like a stranger.” We always use thesame harsh words when giving a baby back. Muhammad didn’t move or even cry. Hehad to be hit a second time before he ran toward Aminah, who was crouching inthe street now, arms open wide. But their reunion was a tease. Mecca had beeninfected with a plague, and when the first neighbor died on Aminah’s street, shecovered her face with a veil into which bitter herbs were knotted. She veiledher baby’s face too, but this was a futile precaution. She knew fate wasn’t donewith her. In tears she returned Muhammad to me. Contagion blows from house tohouse faster than dust, so there was little time to consider.“When should I bring him back?” I asked. I was rushing back to the same campwhere the Banu Sa’d always stay, only now it was dangerously close to town.Aminah ran beside me, holding Muhammad in her arms. He couldn’t run fast enoughto keep up, and she couldn’t bear parting from him so soon, after only a day.I asked again. “Two months, three?” It was up to her.“Three years. Keep him as long as you can,” Aminah said.I won’t lie. I was shocked. “But the plague will be gone once the weak are alldead. It won’t take nearly that long, perhaps by winter.”She wasn’t listening. She thrust her baby into my arms and ran away, not lookingback. Which wasn’t heartless, as you might think. She knew what fate was like.It was like a wasp covered in honey. You cannot taste the sweetness without asting.That was why the boy grew up to be five among the nomads and saw his firstcorpse in the sand dunes. Foreigners had other uses besides dying on us, whichcould be very useful if their horses were still alive and their purses full ofcoins. Muhammad learned about respect from the eyes of strangers. Not just theones from outside Arabia, who were forced to show respect unless they wanted towake up one morning in the desert to find that their guide had disappeared inthe night. City Arabs move freely back and forth between the city and the wild.The young men in particular are never more than half tamed by life in town.Since childhood they have heard about falcon hunting and sneak attacks on thetents of the enemy. Young men want glory, and they sneak away into the desert assoon as they can.Muhammad met many of them from his tribe, the Quraysh, who were the proudest ofall, since they were used to power and money in Mecca. It took only a few daysto strip their pride. It wasn’t done through humiliation or mischief (althoughno one strongly objected to handing them a blanket full of sand fleas to wrapthemselves in at night—a few hundred pink bites is a healthy reminder of howthings are). What won their respect was something you’d never suspect: words.The young men come with mouths as filthy as the bottoms of their feet. A few canread, but all know the magic of words, and there is no purer magic than thewords of the Bedouin.We are the living chronicle of every Arab hero and god. Our minds are soaked inpoetry the way a wineskin is soaked with juice. Their first night sitting aroundthe fire, the young men are shivering with cold—they never come dressed for thechill that descends after the sun sinks—and exchanging filthy anecdotes to keepwarm. No one rebukes them. A Banu Sa’d elder will softly begin to sing one ofthe songs about a great raid in which our ancestors stole a hundred camels. Asecond man will join in once he recognizes the tune, then a third. In a fewmoments the whole tribe is singing, and the young men’s jaws drop. It’s not themelody or the exploit being praised that moves them, but the strength of everyvoice singing as one, and in such beautiful, pure Arabic as these corrupt youngdandies have never heard in their whole lives.You think you know what comes next. I will praise Muhammad for being the bestsinger or the youngest or the most precocious. I will paint a picture of the dayhe stood up and astonished the men by singing a song he had only heard once, notgetting a syllable wrong. In fact, Muhammad almost never sang, except in a lowvoice no one could hear. When we were blessed by a wandering bard and laid afeast before him in order to hear his epics of massacred Christians and enemyarmies drowned in sand overnight, Muhammad sat on the edge of the assembly oreven sneaked away. I had to protect him from suspicion that he had blood thatwasn’t Arab in his veins. Without verse and song, what is an Arab?No use worrying about that. I was anxious that fate would never let him see hismother again. But after three years they were reunited again. She was waiting bythe gate, just as before. She crouched in the street with her arms spread wide.Only this time she didn’t cry out, and I didn’t slap Muhammad to make him run toher. He was old enough to be told what his situation was. When he set eyes onAminah, he was prepared for this strange woman who must be called mother. Hedidn’t kiss me, but only gave a grave little bow and walked slowly into herarms.Aminah brought me inside. She was poorer than ever, but she had cakes and teawaiting for me, and two girls in bangles who did a dance in my honor (they hadbeen coached to run off as soon as they were done, not staying for a share ofcake and tea). She placed a small sandalwood box on the table between us. When Iopened it, I saw all the jewelry she possessed in the world. One was a singlepearl as large as my thumb, which I knew she had brought with her in her dowrywhen she arrived in the house of Abdullah.Aminah saw that I was about to protest. She drew Muhammad close and wrapped herskirt around him. “You take it. Now I have a richer pearl,” she said. She was awoman, but she had the Arab way with words.I spent the night in a featherbed covered with a silk spread, once beautiful,now worn almost threadbare. I couldn’t sleep, because my mind kept thrashing amemory over. Aminah was eager to know everything about her son, and we had spentthe evening in one-sided talk, as I recounted everything he had learned amongthe Banu Sa’d. But fear forced me to lie. I withheld the one thing she had to betold.The thing happened when he was three. One day I was scrubbing out a copper potwith sand when my own child, a boy little older than Muhammad, ran into thetent.“Two men are killing my brother!” he cried.He was too breathless and frightened to say more. I raised a cry and ran outinto the desert, following the tracks my boy had left. A few men heard mydistress and joined me. That morning Muhammad had wandered off. We covered along distance before I spotted him lying in the sand near a thornbush. My heartpounded. I rushed to his side. He was alive, but very weak.“Run after them! They tried to kill him!” I cried, but the men didn’t move. Theywere bewildered. There was no blood on the boy’s body and no wounds. Lookingaround, you couldn’t see tracks leading anywhere. Nobody called my son a liar.We have a good position, and they wouldn’t dare. I swept Muhammad up in my arms,grateful that he hadn’t gotten lost. Somehow the string that tied him to one ofthe girls must have broken.I scolded my boy, and his father threatened to beat him for lying, but he neverchanged his story. He had followed Muhammad out into the desert when he saw thebroken string. The footprints were easy to track. When he came over a rise, hesaw two strangers bent over Muhammad, who was lying on his back just as we foundhim. The two had long knives, and while one kept the boy pinned with his knee,the other plunged his blade into Muhammad’s chest. If they noticed that theywere being observed, they didn’t turn their heads. The one reached intoMuhammad’s chest and did something. My boy couldn’t tell what; he was barely sixhimself. The sight so frightened him that he watched for only a minute beforerunning back to camp.The tale was not incredible to everyone. Jinns roam the desert thirsting forhuman souls. That was the strongest possibility. I had my doubts, though. Jinnsattack at night, and they don’t need knives to pluck out your soul. They havedark enchantment. Not that anyone has survived to say what that enchantment is.I feared Muhammad would be shunned for drawing two demons so close to camp inbroad daylight. In fact, the opposite happened. The fact that he had survivedtheir attack was considered to be a sign of stronger magic than that of thejinns. It was decided that Muhammad’s name would be added to the songs about ourancestors who had driven off jinns. After that, his reputation was made.Besides, it was obvious he hadn’t had his soul sucked out.I couldn’t tell Aminah this, and since Muhammad was so young, there was no fearthat he would let it slip. I took the sandalwood box and departed the nextmorning after first tucking the pearl under Aminah’s pillow. Everything in thebox would have vanished anyway, once she fell sick and doctors had to be paid.In the few years she had left, I would have been welcome in her house, but Inever went back. Muhammad had spent enough time with a mother who wasn’t real.Now he needed time with a mother who would be real such a short time. Aminah waslike a shadow passing through his life. WHEN HE WAS sure that I had regained my strength, Muhammad led me from mysickroom to the edge of town. Mecca is too green to see the desert from, evenatop the highest watchtower. He fussed over my bags when the small train ofdonkeys and camels arrived to take me home. I let him. Why not? A hundredcousins aren’t the same as a milk-mother. My few things were packed intosaddlebags. The Banu Sa’d men who came for me were old ones who could be spared,and they hated the city. The circling hills shut out too much of the sky. Inhaste I was laid on a stretcher behind the last camel, since I was too weak tomake the journey on foot. The last thing I felt wasn’t love for Muhammad, but atwinge of curiosity.“Do you remember one day in the desert, when you were very young and got lost?”I asked.He nodded. “But I wasn’t lost. I had a feeling where I should go. Two men werewaiting for me when I got there.”I was amazed. “They attacked you, and you never told me? After we got you home,you wouldn’t say a word.”“I couldn’t. I knew you thought the jinns had captured me.”“It had to be jinns. They left no footprints. They were seen ripping open yourchest.”“I wondered why everyone whispered behind my back. But it wasn’t jinns. Otherbeings live in the desert. You should know that.”If it had been anyone else putting me in my place, my nails would have been athis face. But with him I felt a mixture of meekness and wonder. “What kind ofbeings?” I asked in a small voice.A strange smile crossed Muhammad’s face. “I’ve never stopped asking thatquestion. You came running in such a panic, you scared them off.” He put afinger lightly on his heart. “Don’t worry. Whatever they wanted to do, it’sdone.”"},{"pageContent":"4 [003-TOC.html#chapter_04]WARAQAH, THE BELIEVERThe best hiding place is inside your own heart. I’ve tried all the others. Evenwhen I dug a hole by the open latrines and covered it with thatch, they draggedme out and beat me. I was young then, and they were thugs. A hideous idol with aserpent’s tail had been found smashed to bits outside the Kaaba. It was probablyone of them, getting drunk and daring one another. But I was easier to blame.I only wanted to be alone so I could think about God. How did that hurt anyone?But loneliness is the seeker’s affliction. It drove me to wander in themarketplace. I was overheard muttering to myself. Allah, endow my heart withwings, so that I may fly to the garden of eternity. I meant it as a prayer, butthey took it as sacrilege.One time a scrap of writing fell out of my pocket. Some Qurayshi roughs pickedit up, and a wandering scribe recited it aloud: “The veil between God and hisservant does not exist in heaven or on earth. It exists in himself.” I couldn’tdig a hole deep enough to hide that kind of blasphemy.Eventually I saved my skin by getting rich. Money is protection againstpersecution. Not perfect protection. If looks could kill, the Qurayshi youth whoprowl the streets would send me to a shallow grave every day of the week andtwice on feast days.I straighten my spine and walk past them eyes ahead. Once I reach the inns bythe Kaaba, my identity changes. I’m no longer “the believer” who cannot enter ahouse for dinner without the rooms being disinfected with musk after he leaves.I turn into a well-padded merchant whose shameful ideas are insignificant, onceyou hear the clink of gold in his purse.“Waraqah ibn Nawfal, you are most welcome.”“Waraqah, my brother, sit here next to me.”“Waraqah, blessed by the gods, make me happy by sharing this wine.”I never trusted any of them, and yet one time I let my guard down. My onlyexcuse is gathering age. I took one of the Quraysh aside, a young man who stoodout for being slightly more thoughtful than his peers. I unfolded a parchmentbefore his eyes. It was wrinkled and yellow; it had been clumsily mended inseveral places.“What do you think of this?” I asked.The young man was barely literate, but he looked impressed. “Your will?” heguessed. He was an old camel trader’s son, not yet twenty. He probably dreamedabout his inheritance every spare moment.I smiled. “It’s more precious than my will. It’s a page from the Bible. I’vebeen translating it.”His eyes widened. “Better be careful,” he warned. I had pushed the page towardhim, but he backed away as if I were offering him a hot coal.It was comical, really. Everyone knows that such pages exist. A merchant whoseroute passes through the tiny communities of Jews and Christians may buy or sellan occasional tattered leaf from their jumbled scriptures. But we Arabs pretendthat these communities have not sprung up in our midst. It would be likeadmitting a growth of black smut in your bags of wheat.I reverently kissed the parchment. “It tells of Abraham and Isaac. You shouldlet me recite the story to you sometime. There’s almost a murder in it. You likeknives, don’t you?” I was toying with the young man, who looked relieved when Ifolded the scrap and thrust it back into my robe. I was lucky. He could have leda move against me.What does “the believer” believe? No one ever asks me to my face. They only knowthat the idols are good business, and anyone who speaks out against themthreatens everybody’s income. “Listen to reason, my dear Waraqah,” they say. “Wewill shrivel like a barren womb. Mecca will die without the pilgrims. You seehow much they spend.”It’s true. You can get money out of a pilgrim simply for letting him set eyes ona golden idol. They spend even more during the Hajj, when hundreds flood Meccato run the circle around the Kaaba. No one knows when that started, but now it’sa fixed tradition.I am approaching Muhammad, my spiritual son, in this roundabout way, becausethat is how he approached me.One day, it was a dozen years ago, I was sitting in my courtyard. I wasexpecting a messenger momentarily and left the gate open. A little boy wanderedinside. We looked at each other. I asked where his mother was, but he didn’treply. He gazed at me shyly. From his dress I saw that he must be a nomad. Theyare fierce about keeping their children close by.I went over and crouched in front of him. “Do you know me?” I asked. I had thestrangest feeling.He shook his head. “I don’t know you, but I hear your voice.”Well, of course he did. I had just spoken to him. But the boy didn’t mean that.He turned and pointed past the gate. “I was playing by the well, and I heardyou. What do you want?”If he meant Zamzam, it was ten streets away. “I don’t want anything from you,” Isaid, feeling very queer talking this way to a five-or six-year-old.“Then I must want from you,” he said.Before I could question him, one of those Qurayshi toughs was at my gate. Hedidn’t dare come through it, but he started yelling. “Hey, hey, he’s here. Ifound him.”A second later two of his fellows ran up and behind them a Banu Sa’d woman,red-faced and puffing. “Muhammad!” she cried and rushed into the courtyard tosweep him up. Immediately she realized her discourtesy and began spewingapologies, tangled with a disjointed tale about bringing the boy back to hismother, who hadn’t seen him in three years. I didn’t care. I assured her thather infraction was nothing. I escorted her back to the gate, glaring at theQurayshi roughnecks, who lingered in case I gave them a coin. If I didn’t,they’d shake down the poor woman, so I slipped them the smallest piece of silverI had. Why not? God sees every good deed.A tiny incident, but it preyed on my mind. Muhammad had wandered away from hiswet nurse when her back was turned and headed straight for my gate.Under my bed I have many pages of the Bible stashed away. It’s my habit to pullone out late at night and translate a few passages into Arabic. I also haveanother ritual that I keep to myself, for good reason. When I am puzzled over amystery, large or small, I pull a sheet out at random, and whatever my eye fallsupon I take to be a message. A few days after the boy appeared, I reached underthe mattress and took out the first page my fingers touched. I shut my eyes andpointed to a passage at random, then took it over to the lamp to read:Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son,And his name shall be called Emmanuel.These were not meaningless words. The man who sold me this particular page was aChristian beggar who followed my caravan many years ago. I threw him some bread,and as he wolfed it down he told me about his savior. He felt blessed, eventhough he lived in the gutter and fought with stray dogs over garbage.The year the beggar sold me this scrap of scripture he had a terrible cough. Heknew he wasn’t long for this world. This page from the Bible was precious tohim, and the beggar wanted the message of his Messiah carried forward.So I knew that the virgin had conceived, and Emmanuel had come. It happened longago, and the only reason to keep the page was to remind me of how the beggar’sface glowed when he spoke about his savior. Why, then, had my finger landed onthis verse?Several years passed before a Jew came to Mecca whom I could trust. He pliedgold and silver trinkets. His trade was so valuable that he bought his way outof the law that kept Jews from entering Mecca. I gave him wine and showed himthe passage. The name Emmanuel brought a crooked smile to his face.“Don’t trust your beggar,” he said. “What kind of a savior would allow someoneto live like that?”The messiah is yet to come, he said, to kill the enemies of the Jews and savethem all. I was too impatient to wait that long, I told him. In Arabia, idolscan save you today, if you‘re gullible enough. I pressed the Jew for anexplanation that meant something real. More than a bit exasperated, he said thatfor my understanding “Emmanuel” meant the “king of prophets.”Ah, well, that was a different story.Arabs put great store in prophets. If God pointed to the word “prophet” when Iasked about Muhammad, something must be afoot. In Mecca some of the ignorantcall me “the Jew,” but that’s just their crude way of insulting a servant ofGod. I have no religion. I am hanif, a believer without a faith, like a lonepalm tree without an oasis.I did not approach Muhammad the whole time he was growing up. That was far toorisky. I watched from afar. Old Muttalib, his grandfather, was still alive then.It was a tragedy that he had survived his youngest son, Abdullah, but he foundsolace in Muhammad. He would take the boy to the inns and prop him on his kneewhile holding forth. Muttalib had gotten too old for trading. He was half blindand growing weaker by the month. It was a common sight, he and the boy, who kepthis eyes on the ground. No one had ever seen a child who wanted to keep tohimself so much. But Muhammad was obedient, and when Muttalib wanted to show himoff, he would stand up like a man, even in front of half a dozen drunk Qurayshin a dingy, smoky wine house.Then a peculiar thing happened. Many years later I was out walking and happenedto see a figure crouched in an alley. The light was dim, but I made out Muhammadsquatting on his heels. I nodded. He put his fingers to his lips and pointed atsomething on the ground. A mouse. The creature had been lured out into the openwith a few grains of wheat.Then Muhammad gazed up at the sky, where a black speck hovered. My eyes werefailing, but I knew it was a hawk. Muhammad looked back at the mouse, then atthe hawk again.“It has no idea of the danger,” he said.“Neither do we,” I replied.You see the point? Like the mouse innocently eating its seeds, we go about ourlives not realizing that death is watching us from afar, constantly stalking.Those were Muhammad’s inner thoughts. Why had he shared them with me? Our voicesmade the mouse scurry back into its hole. Muhammad stood up and walked towardme.“I’m a man now,” he said. “We can talk.”“A man? You’re seventeen,” I smiled.He didn’t smile back. “Old enough to defend myself, if anyone catches us talkinglike this.”That’s how it started. I never brought up the day his nurse lost him and hewandered into my courtyard, but he must have remembered. What kind of patiencedoes it take to wait twelve years before speaking to someone again? He begancoming to my house for tea and God. Only tea at first, because God remained aforbidden subject until later.Naturally, he wanted to know about me. “What is a hanif?” he asked.“One who believes in Allah, one who scorns idols and waits for the light todescend,” I said.He nodded gravely. “Everyone says you’re different, but you look ordinary tome.”Muhammad said this frankly and without apology, considering he was insulting anelder. I answered with a quote from one of my hidden books. “A man goes in andout among the people. He eats and sleeps with them. He buys and sells in themarketplace. This everyone can see. What they cannot see is that he neverforgets God for a single instant.”“Are you that man?” asked Muhammad.“I will be, when I become a saint. For now, I can only try.”“Why is one god better than many?” he asked.I answered with another question. “Why is one faithful wife better than manywhores?”“What makes you call the gods whores?”“In both cases you pay your money and get your wish. Only a whore is morereliable and trustworthy. Most idols take your money and give nothing inreturn,” I replied.Muhammad seemed pleased that I spoke so freely. As for myself, I often had toconceal a burning excitement that agitated me every time I set eyes on him. Howcould I explain it? It was impossible. I would lose all respect. A grown mantrembling like a bride waiting in the dark for her bridegroom.We talked about everything, endlessly. Yet I could never draw Muhammad out abouthis own beliefs. This was a cause for concern. In Arabia, one belief swallows upevery other: the tribe. The tribe tells you where you belong on earth. The triberuns to defend you after you knife a stranger for spitting on your sandals. Likea monster with a thousand heads, the tribe sees everything and can eat whom itpleases. There is no room for belief in anything else, including God. God isjust another thing for the monster to devour.One day I’d had enough. I turned on Muhammad. “Talking to you is like talking toa respectful oyster. Open up. Who are you?”He didn’t look startled. “I am one who selects friends carefully.”An angel must have seen my impatience, because at that moment he brought me theperfect response. It was from an old verse. “I have a friend, and he fills mycup with wine that has no equal.”Muhammad blushed. “You have been such a friend to me.”After that, our bond was sealed. We became bold enough that we’d talk in public,late at night after everyone else had stumbled home. I was always eager for hiscompany.Word soon shot around town that he was my protégé. Just in case anyone took thatamiss, I spread my money around more generously. I even sent a messenger boy tobuy a calf and sacrifice it outside the Kaaba during the spring rites. He tookmy money and an hour later came racing back.“Which god is it for?” the boy asked. “They want to know.”“The one whose only name is ‘the One,’” I said. The boy looked confused, so Isaid, “The choice is theirs. Just make a good show of it.” He ran away stillconfused. No matter. I was used to being unfathomable.Muhammad was balm to my soul. I had someone to hold in a spiritual embrace. Theaffliction of loneliness was lifted. But what good was I doing for him? I couldalways leave him my money. Mecca would have a second rich outcast. There had tobe something else.“Are there other hanif?” he asked me one day.“You mean others who know better how to keep their mouths shut?”He smiled. “I was thinking of those who might have a taste for wisdom.”“Wisdom is like hot coals,” I said. “People enjoy the glow, but they’re notstupid enough to step in.”It was the most cynical thing I’d ever said, and his face fell.“You make me talk like a whore,” I murmured, and Muhammad knew it was anapology. We both knew I wasn’t ashamed to be a believer. But I never took him tomeet another hanif. It was contradictory. Two hanif make a congregation, three atribe, and four a faith to be defended against other faiths with arrows andspears. Each hanif travels alone, I told him, and it seemed that Muhammad wassatisfied with that explanation.Something gnawed at me, though. I pondered a long time, until I convinced myselfthat he needed to know about the verse my finger had lighted upon. And he shallbe called Emmanuel. If I didn’t tell him, I would be hiding a great secret fromhim. The only way to bring up the subject was indirectly. One blazing afternoonwe were lying in the courtyard on straw pallets that had been soaked down withwater.Muhammad raised himself up on his elbows. “What is it?”I faced him. “What do you know about how your father died?”For once the cautious youth looked startled. “I know he went on a journey andnever returned.”“There’s more,” I said. “Much more.”Muhammad hesitated. He didn’t want his memories disturbed, I could tell.“They aren’t your memories,” I said. “You never met him. He’s like water thatsomeone else has drunk.”“But he was loved,” said Muhammad.That much was undeniable. From the day he was born, Abdullah had led a charmedlife. Everyone said so, and that made it so. He was never insulted in the streetby a reckless young tough or called out to a fight. He basked in the illusionthat he was the first person ever to be loved.“He wanted to be a hero,” I began. “A man who spoke like thunder and laughedlike the sunrise. I knew him and saw what his imagination was like. He loved theBedouin, and he envisioned himself in one of their legends.” I eyed Muhammadsharply. “Do you know why your father failed?”“Because he died.”“No. Because it was not God’s will.”Then and there I unfolded the twisted whole story of Abdullah’s death, which hadbeen carefully kept from his son.Everything revolved around Zamzam. The joy that Abdul Muttalib felt when herediscovered the well was short-lived. He became entangled in Qurayshiintrigues. He was resented for grabbing the rights to the sacred water, and intime Muttalib felt that his enemies would prevail. What he needed was ten strongsons, or so he convinced himself. But the gods had favored him so far with onlyone.He spent his days and nights chewing over his obsession, until the situationtook a desperate turn. Muttalib went to the Kaaba and gazed at the hundreds ofidols that lined the chamber. All at once he believed in none of them. Indespair he called on God instead. Deep inside every Arab is an ancestral memoryof Allah. It was Allah, the one God, who had led Hagar and Ishmael, the veryfounders of the Arab race, to Mecca.Muttalib had never considered Allah reliable enough. The creator of the worldhad lost interest in his creation. Why else did ill fortune and calamitiesbefall his children? But Muttalib had to have those ten sons, and it was inGod’s power to grant them. Muttalib knew nothing of Jewish or Christian beliefs.He knew, however, that every god loved sacrifices in his name.The greatest of the gods would require the greatest sacrifice, he reasoned.Muttalib raised his arms to heaven and promised the most dreadful sacrificepossible, if only he was granted the blessing of ten strong sons to defend himfrom his enemies.A decade passed. One after another Muttalib’s wives bore him healthy,well-formed sons, until the number reached ten. He was well satisfied, and hispeace of mind was all the more profound, because he had forgotten his oath toAllah long ago.But God can reach into any man’s heart. One day while walking to the Kaaba,where the most revered idol was Hubal, the moon god, Muttalib had a vision inbloody detail of his promised sacrifice. He had sworn an oath to give God backone of his sons if he was granted ten. Muttalib was horrified by the picture ofhimself cutting the throat of one of his precious sons, but the thought ofreneging on his promise to God was more horrifying.He called his sons together and told them that one must die the very next day.But which one? The room fell silent. The sons were as superstitious as thefather. They knew the oath had to be carried out. The next day they all gatheredinside the Kaaba beside the statue of Hubal. Muttalib believed that if his sonsdrew lots, Hubal had enough power to select the right one. As you can see,Muttalib was fickle. One day he shivered before the might of God, but when itcame to practical affairs, throwing the choice onto an idol’s shoulders waseasier. He had been paying off Hubal for years.The sons each wrote their name on an arrowhead and threw the arrows into aquiver. Muttalib reached in and, begging Hubal for guidance, pulled one out. Thename on it was Abdullah’s. The other nine sons, needless to say, were relieved,yet no one expected that Muttalib’s favorite son would ever be drawn. When thenews was announced outside the Kaaba, the gathered crowd began to shout,demanding Muttalib to foreswear his oath. The wife who had borne Abdullah wasnamed Fatimah. She was popular with the common folk, and most of the crowd camefrom her clan.Muttalib heard the vociferous protestations with a heart of stone. He had pickeda spot between two large idols where he would shed Abdullah’s blood. With hisunsheathed knife he made his way through the mob. Abdullah followed, white as aghost. Hands plucked at garments; cries filled the air.Pardon me if this tragic moment suddenly turns comic, but at the last minute avoice in the crowd shouted, “The gods love money. Pay them off. You can affordit.”Muttalib whirled around in a rage, trying to spot the one who had cried out soinsolently. But a tiny voice in his head whispered, It’s not such a bad idea.You’re rich, and you love Abdullah more than anyone else in the world.With a great show of reluctance Muttalib agreed to spare Abdullah, but therewere two details to settle, for now this had turned into haggling. How muchshould be paid to ransom his son, and who should decide that the price was fair?Since Fatimah’s clan had raised such a ruckus, Muttalib forced them to add theirmoney to his. As for an arbiter, it was decided to seek the advice of Shiya, awoman soothsayer who was the most trusted among the various shamans, fortunetellers, astrologers, oracles, and diviners trusted by the Quraysh.Shiya was a recluse living in the faraway town of Yathrib. The journey had itsperils, and Yathrib was traditionally a rival to Mecca in prestige and power.Even so, Muttalib made the trip with a light heart, overjoyed to circumvent hisbargain with Allah. It wasn’t a good sign that Shiya had just left town when hearrived, but Muttalib brushed this omen off. He traveled a hundred miles northbefore he found her, an old crone shuttered inside a hovel. She refused himentrance, but after two days of his wheedling Shiya promised to divine ananswer.Her answer was this: “In your tribe, Abdul Muttalib, if a man kills another man,the victim’s life is worth ten camels, which are paid to his family. Payment incamels will satisfy the gods in this case too.”Muttalib had his doubts that Allah could be bribed with ten camels, but beforehe could object, Shiya stopped him. “Take two arrows and go before Hubal again.On one arrow write ‘Abdullah’ and on the other, ‘camels.’ Draw out the arrows asyou did before, and every time your son’s name comes up, add ten more camels tothe price. Do this until the word ‘camel’ is drawn, and you’ll have the pricethe gods demand.”Muttalib and his companions returned to Mecca, and a great crowd gathered forthe drawing, laughing and carousing as if this were a feast day. The first arrowthat Muttalib drew had Abdullah’s name on it, so the price was ten camels. Hedrew again. Abdullah’s name appeared. The price was now twenty camels. Thecrowd’s cheerful banter turned to silence and finally grim-faced awe. Abdullah’sname was drawn ten times in a row. The price was a hundred camels, almost thewealth of a well-to-do trader. Muttalib was richer than that, but he blanched.At last the word “camel” came up on the eleventh try, but by then Muttalib wasdejected and overwhelmed with doubts. He stood up before the crowd and raisedhis hands.“Draw again,” he cried. “If Abdullah’s name comes up three times in a row, Iwill obey the soothsayer. If not, my duty to God forces me to keep my bargain.”This was terrible news to Fatimah’s clan and to Abdullah, of course, who letdrop a cup of wine he had raised to his lips.Despite the hue and cry and the horror on Abdullah’s face, Muttalib stood firm.All along he had mistrusted Shiya, suspecting that she might be toying with himbecause her allegiance was to the tribes of Yathrib.The arrows were drawn again. One, two, three. An exultant cry rose up from thecrowd, because Abdullah’s name had appeared on all three draws. His life wasspared, and his father paid a hundred camels to the priests at the Kaaba in thename of Hubal.When I reached this point in my tale, I glanced at Muhammad, who had grown verystill. No one had recounted these details to him, and he was steeling himself,since he already knew that his father’s reprieve led to no happy ending.I went on. To celebrate his escape from death, Abdullah was allowed to marry,and at age twenty-five he took Aminah, the daughter of a prominent family inMecca. They spent three days ensconced in her father’s house after the weddingceremony. But Muttalib had been harboring dark thoughts amid the celebrations.He called Abdullah to him and told him that he should travel by caravan toSyria. The young bridegroom was baffled. Why should he leave? He had only beenmarried a week. The young couple were enjoying the first sweet taste of theirlove.Muttalib gave no reasons. He forced his will upon Abdullah, as was his right asthe young man’s father. With tears and rending cries Aminah ran to the gateclutching Abdullah’s robe as he left for Syria. They had been together as manand wife for only two weeks. Abdullah knew that his father was daring God toharm him. It was the old man’s way of testing if he had truly fulfilled his oathto Allah. That, and Muttalib’s fear that Abdullah’s happiness was too great.Between having his life saved and his bliss with Aminah, Abdullah was temptingthe gods to destroy him.“And they did,” said Muhammad interrupting.Abdullah never made it back home. The trading in Syria went well, but hisyearning to be back with his bride was strong. Retracing his steps, he passedthrough Yathrib. There, where Shiya had saved him from fate, Abdullah fell illwith a malady no healer could treat. He died a few days later and was quicklyburied, in case his curse happened to be contagious.“I don’t tell you all this to add to your sorrows,” I said. “You had to knowthese things. Abdullah had a sixth sense. He knew that God’s will cannot bebargained with. Just as we accept life from Allah, so must we accept death, as agift that is not ours to question.”Muhammad hadn’t waited for the end of my tale before springing to his feet. Hebegan to pace restlessly. “You want to curse my whole family? You might as wellwith this tale.”A voice told me to keep quiet. Nothing hurt more than Muhammad’s anger. Yetstinging words poured from my lips. “This has nothing to do with me. Your mothertook you on a trip when you were six. Where? To that same town, Yathrib. Shedied on the way home, just like her husband. Open your eyes. See the will ofGod. Accept it.”Muhammad remained silent, but his eyes told a story of defiance.I continued. “My son, you are fated. I have prayed over you, and God hasprepared you for greatness. A great man learns through calamity. It fixes hisgaze on heaven, if he is wise.”The color rose in Muhammad’s cheeks. “You made my father and his father out tobe mere dreamers.”“Sometimes dreamers see more than ordinary people,” I replied. “Abdullah fledhis young bride even though it broke her heart. He ushered himself off the scenebefore it was done for him.”I had gone too far. Another youth might have tightened his fists and startedswearing. Muhammad stopped pacing and gazed at me. I put my hand on his shoulderto calm him.“I’m saying that all men must die, but some may go to their deaths willingly asa sacrifice. In that way they become true servants of God. We never know thetruth until it is revealed.”Muhammad pulled away. He was too upset to listen and ran toward the courtyardgate. I didn’t call after him. Without using the word “prophet,” I had openedthe possibility of a special fate. Muhammad didn’t return the next day, or theday after that. He avoided contact, only nodding at me if our paths happened tocross at the inns or near the Kaaba. His gaze was strangely guilty. It would bemonths before he relented and asked to see me again.The night I revealed Muhammad’s destiny to him I couldn’t sleep. I pulled out apage from my hidden cache and pointed a finger in the dark. When I brought itclose to the lamp, the words beneath my finger brought consolation.For strait is the gate, and narrow is the way that leads to life, and few therebe who find it."},{"pageContent":"5 [003-TOC.html#chapter_05]BARAKAH, THE AFRICAN SLAVEI don’t know if hell has three circles, but Mecca does. The first ring is wherethe rich live, the second is for those who dream of getting rich, and the thirdis for the dregs, who wait upon the first two. I live in the worst, the farthestcircle away from God. All around me, desperation is a way of life. In a droughtI’ve seen children squat to sip from the sewer. The rich would rather kiss aleper than come to the filthy alleys where our crumbling hovels stand. Theycrowd around the Kaaba, their mansions and courtyards shouldering each otheraside like old women grabbing for peaches in the bazaar.Is my head less blessed, because it’s not covered with silk?“Barakah, I trust you. You’re the only one I trust,” says Muhammad.He comes to see me. That’s proof that he’s not rich yet. Ever since old Muttalibdied, their clan has fallen. Slaves found themselves thrown out on the street,begging for a master to feed them. It’s shocking how the vultures closed in,stripping the Hashim of power, forcing them into humiliation. Muhammad did whathe had to. He began to trade his small fund, and that has served him well. Inever thought he’d reach twenty without begging for help.His visits to me aren’t planned. He drops in on hell when the mood strikes him.God seal my mouth for saying such things. He loves me—that’s the real reason. Iwas the first person to hold him when he was born. I belonged to his mother, thelady Aminah, in those days. I’ve been passed along so many times I couldn’t nameall my owners. I’m like a water skin that won’t be thrown out until it leaks itslife away.One day I look up from sweeping the blown dirt and leaves from my last master’scourtyard, and I see an amazing sight. Muhammad leading a caravan, and so young.An older merchant weary of travel trusted him to go in his place. When he spotsme from atop his camel, he gives me a serious nod. I know Muhammad wants todismount and embrace me, but he can’t, not in front of men he gives orders to.In the back of my mind I think, Your father never returned, your mother neverreturned. Maybe the curse ended with them.And he did return. Word spread that Muhammad could be trusted to keep his headin dangerous corners. He will soon have the money to buy me for himself.“Money?” I laugh. “No master will give me shelter anymore. You can have me forfree.”Muhammad winces, but we both know what is lacking. He first needs a wife. Afemale slave in a single man’s house is scandalous. Everyone would know whatshe’s really there for. Gossips would say that he likes them old.“How did you become so respectable?” I tease Muhammad.“Don’t worry. It’s a disguise,” he jokes back. Walking past him in the street,you see Muhammad’s hair and beard cut like those of someone who’s prosperous. Hewears a cloak dyed in rich blue and trimmed with braid. Only I know what he is.He allows me to stroke his cheek to feel how perfectly the razor has done itswork. And why not? I ushered him into this world, a squealing naked creature.His respectability ends at my doorstep.“You’ve come to save me,” I murmur. “You’ve come to save everybody.”“Don’t be foolish,” he replies. “I’m as helpless as anyone, and even moreconfused.”I shake my head. “Wine ferments before it grows sweet. That’s what you’re doing.The sweetness will come.”I think our intimacy pleases him. I wouldn’t be in danger if I shouted about itfrom the rooftops. That’s one advantage of being invisible. All poor women areinvisible here, except in bed. For half an hour they are divine creatures then.What does that make me, twice as invisible? I was born a slave, and I sleepalone.The memory of Muhammad’s mother haunts me. Aminah worshiped Abdullah beyond thegrave. The gods were displeased; Abdullah was her only idol. She took that finaltrip beyond Yathrib to weep over the pile of stones where they buried him. Whenshe turned her steps back to Mecca, a full month later, grief had destroyed herhealth. I was walking ahead of her donkey when I heard Aminah say, as softly asa frightened child, “We stop here.” She felt sick. Walking beside her, Muhammadhung his head.I felt a shiver run down my spine. Two women and a six-year-old boy pitching atent alone in the desert? We got it up somehow, and Aminah crawled inside, as ifthe tent’s folds could protect her from a trembling fever. She died so quickly.I barely had time to send Muhammad out of the tent, but he couldn’t stand it andran back inside, just in time to fling himself on his mother’s unconscious body.We wailed together like wounded animals, then buried her with our own hands. Thewhole way home the boy kept staring at the dirt under his torn, raggedfingernails. The dirt of his mother’s grave. What a horrible thing to set youreyes upon.I had my own horrors. Watching a young woman die like that, burning up in myarms, was worse than seeing your house burn down. This was a soul turned toashes. Aminah begged me to take care of her boy. I did what I could. For a whileit was possible. Old Muttalib took me into his house. I didn’t have to live inhell then. I had a tiny room at the back of his rambling mansion. He lovedMuhammad so much that he even pushed out an old crone who had inhabited the roomlike a forgotten ghost. I shudder to think of where she went. But Muttalib died,and his sons lost the power. I cried to lose Muhammad, who was only eight. Hewent into Abu Talib’s house, a small dwelling where the clink of gold was rarelyheard.I can’t remind Muhammad of these things or he blushes with shame. “I should havegone with you on to the street,” he says. However, we both know that wasimpossible.When he arrives in his fancy blue robes, the braid dragging in the dust becausehe doesn’t pay attention, my boy brings me bread, olives, and a small clay jarof oil. I don’t dive into it. The way the vulgar rich tear at their fooddisgusts me. I taught Muhammad better, and I’ve seen him sit quiet and hungrywhile Abu Talib’s sons clawed at the dinner bowls like hyenas. With the foodMuhammad brings, we sit opposite each other on a tattered rug and nod politelyfor the other to go first.“Here,” he says once, holding out a small glass vial. You didn’t even have totake out the stopper to smell what it was. Attar of rose. I thought I’d faintfrom intoxication.“Open it,” he urges, when I shove the vial into my underblouse.“Don’t be silly. It will attract flies, and I have enough as it is.” But I wasjust trying to keep from crying in front of him.As Muhammad has grown, he has become more troubled. One day I ask him aboutthis. “To be empty is to be miserable,” he says, which makes no senseAnd now the bad times have come. People are afraid. You have to know how to readthe signs. One day I’m walking along and what do I see? The sand outside a richman’s gate is bloody. It’s not brown blood, the leftovers of a street fight.It’s shockingly red and fresh. Usually everyone looks away when there’s blood.To stare might mean you’ve got an opinion about the fight, and anyone with anopinion has taken sides, a dangerous thing to do in Mecca.On this day I hear buzzing in the air. People aren’t just staring; they’retalking angrily, and I see something else. The trail of blood leads into therich man’s courtyard. This wasn’t just a common knife fight between two younghotheads.I know instantly what it means. The balance has been wrecked. The rich areprotected from losing their blood, unless the tribes can’t settle theirdifferences behind closed doors. Once there is chaos, no one is safe.“Come away. You can’t stay here,” a voice says, and I feel someone pulling at myelbow. By now the buzzing voices are thicker, like flies around a dead animal,but I see that it’s Muhammad, and I let him drag me off.“I’ve seen riots,” I say, because, to tell you the truth, I wanted to stay andwatch. Not for the sake of more blood. I’ve seen women bloodied by theirhusbands more times than I can remember. All this cruelty is a kind of vanity,if you ask me. A man brags in the inns that he’s a bull in bed when his wifeknows he’s a rabbit. So she has to pay. A crazy world, when one gets punishedfor another’s shame. I wanted to stick around to find out who the new victimswere going to be. If the clans are jockeying for power, the losers aren’t theones you want to serve.When he gets me to a side street, Muhammad looks worried. He warns me not to gonear that house again. I shrug. It doesn’t matter that much where you go whenyou’re invisible, but he repeats the warning and tells me there are three otherhouses I must not be seen around.“Everyone watches. They know who goes through those gates,” he says.“I’ll go where I please,” I say. Which is a boastful way of reminding him thatwherever my master sends me, I have to go. I have to obey.“You won’t be sent there anymore,” he replies. His voice is grim, but he won’texplain what he means. As we part at the corner, Muhammad leaves me with strangewords: “The dawn doesn’t come back to awaken us twice.”I feel prickly all over when he says that, but before I can question him, he hasmelted into the crowd. Now, you’d think something dark was afoot. Maybe onenight the vigilantes will raid a particular clan and wipe out all the youngmales. It’s happened before, and since they sometimes get careless and slit thethroats of a few slaves, I keep to my house the next few nights, begging offthat it’s my unclean days of the month.The buzzing won’t die down. The next time I carry a basket of washing to thewell, I stand next to an Abyssinian woman I know; it’s easier next to anotherblack. They leave us alone. And she says, “You won’t believe it. Uthman wants tobe king. That’s why they nicked him with a knife. It happened while he wascoming home. He screamed blue murder and ran inside.”“They did more than nick him,” I say, slapping the laundry harder against therim of the well to make more noise. It wouldn’t do to be overheard.“That’s not the point. A king—these Arabs won’t stand for it.”A few eyes dart our way, so we shut up. But to tell the truth, I feel likelaughing. A crazy man calls himself a king. I call myself Queen of the Nile, butthe last time I looked, there isn’t a crown under my pillow.Muhammad doesn’t smile when I bring it up, however. “Uthman bin al-Huwayrith.He’s not crazy. He just doesn’t know how to keep a secret.”The Arabs love secrecy more than they love a feud even. They have a saying: “Asecret is like a bird. Let it go from your hand, and it flies everywhere.”Gravely Muhammad tells me that Uthman has become a Christian. He looks surprisedwhen I burst out laughing.“Is that all?” I say. The last thing a slave has to worry about is who toworship. Our masters point to their idols, and there’s an end to it. We bow downwhere they bow down.“I wish you could understand,” Muhammad murmurs.“Why?”“Because Uthman has brought the pot to a boil. Not just him. There are others.They refuse to hide anymore.”I settle down for Muhammad’s sake and pay attention.“This Uthman is a rich Qurayshi. He got drunk one night and declared that thelands beyond Arabia are civilized. They have laws. A man’s money is as safethere as his life. He can even loan with interest, like the Jews. That made theothers sit up, even though they don’t tolerate words against their damned pride.Uthman explained that the Christians are the true sons of Abraham, them and theJews. If Mecca had a Christian king, trade would improve for everyone. Alliancescould be made with Byzantium, where Christians pile gold as high as a virgin’shead to make her dowry. ‘Oh, and who would be king?’ someone yelled in derision.Which is where Uthman should have shut his big mouth. ‘Make me king,’ he shoutedover the general laughter. ‘I’m a Christian already.’“Uh-oh. The room grew quiet. Everyone knew there were hanif around, and it wasassumed that Uthman was one. He went freely to and from the house of Waraqah.But Uthman tried to wave a big stick and accidentally hit a hornet’s nest. Heupset the balance, and over such a stupid thing. They warned him with a nick,but then some others came out on his side, and they were mumbling aboutChristians and Jews too, saying that they’re all the true sons of Abraham.”“Why not go and ask Abraham himself?” I say, growing bored with the tale.Muhammad gives a small, crooked smile. “If only we could.” He explains thatAbraham is the grandfather of grandfathers, and no one knows how long ago helived or who his true sons are, except that part of keeping power for theQuraysh meant that they laid claim to him. He says that if they aren’t the sonsof Abraham, they’re just another tribe of puffed-up bullies.“Are you taking sides?” I ask Muhammad. And he drops a saying: “A lizard doesn’thop from one branch until he’s sure of the next one.” Arabs live by old sayings.I shouldn’t criticize. Muhammad is being prudent. He’s known for that. He’searned more money by refusing the third cup of wine than by shrewdness.“This won’t go away,” says Muhammad, getting up and leaving me the last piece ofbread. “Zamzam ran underground out of sight for a long time. No one knew it wasthere until my grandfather had a vision. God has been running underground too.He hasn’t broken through yet, but the ground is moist, and everyone can see it.”“You can’t drink moist dirt,” I point out. Muhammad smiles and leaves."},{"pageContent":"6 [003-TOC.html#chapter_06]KHATTAB, THE ELDERYears ago Christ’s army marched on Mecca to destroy us, and almost succeeded.Memories are short. People talk about the trouble being stirred up now. This isnothing compared to the madness back then. I pulled Muhammad into my house tomake him listen. His influence is growing in the tribe. He understands trade,and I trade in power. If Mecca collapses, the Arabs will be powerless. We aredevouring ourselves.“Once you hear me out, you can alert the others,” I began. “You are young, butyour counsel means something.”“Am I here for a history lesson?” Muhammad asked with a serious smile.“It’s a lesson about danger,” I said. “Last time the danger came from without.This time it festers within, like a disease. I feel the plague spreading. Trustme, I’ve seen the worst.”Muhammad bowed and took a seat. “Tell me.”I cast my mind back. “News spread of an attacker marching across the desert.Bedouin boys tending sheep in the mountains were the first to spot the enemy.They ran to town crying that huge monsters were in league with thousands ofsoldiers. Mecca had no defenses. Our men couldn’t form a proper army. The deserthas protected us for so long, they had forgotten what war was like. This devilChrist must have been protecting his soldiers to bring them across a hundredmiles of sand without dying of thirst. Panic broke out. Everyone became a nomadovernight. The clans ran into the desert to escape the invaders. People saidhysterical things: Christ’s followers ate human flesh; the Jews had sold themsecret plans to the city. Doors were marked with signs in blood in the dead ofnight.”“It must have been horrible,” said Muhammad. He was listening, but you neverknew what he was thinking, not that one.“Horrible? You’ve never stared starvation in the face, you and your generation.The bazaar was stripped clean as if by a swarm of locusts. A few sellers triedgouging. They offered a pomegranate in trade for a pearl. Instead, men heldknives to their throats and stole the pomegranate. They deserved it too.”Muhammad nodded. He never faltered in the respect department. However, the realquestion remained. Would Muhammad stand with us, the guardians?I take some wine at noon for my blood, and it can go to my head. I found myselfshouting at him. “This must never happen again, do you understand? Never!”“Is that why you had Uthman attacked?” he asked in a voice as quiet as mine wasloud. “Is he part of the disease?”“Nobody had anybody attacked,” I muttered resentfully.“Did the knife go in on its own?”“Uthman is a secret Christian,” I said. “You don’t understand. And since youhave eyes in your head, that means you refuse to understand. Let everythingcrash. I’m old. What does it matter?”I slumped back on a pile of cushions and poured myself another cup. There wasnothing more to say. Muhammad gazed out the window. I stared into the dregs ofthe wine and swatted a fly. It was too hot to argue. If Mecca goes to hell, theycan’t blame me.“I admire you,” said Muhammad suddenly.I was so startled, all I could blurt out was, “Why?”“‘Fate loves a rebel.’ You know that saying?” he asked.“I’m not the rebel. Things are going on behind closed doors. Conspirators aretrying to destroy us. Fanatics, zealots. If they have their way, another army ofdemons will be at our walls.”Muhammad didn’t cringe. I wasn’t so drunk that I didn’t know I was losing mycase. I couldn’t live with myself if the blame fell on me. To calm my nerves, Iretold the story of Christ’s invasion. I assumed Muhammad had already heard it,but I needed to tell it and he needed hear it again.“You were born that year. I knew your mother, as I knew all of the clan of yourgreat-grandfather Hashim. Her belly was swollen when I came to warn her. Aminahwasn’t the kind to be hysterical. She wanted to know everything, so I talked toher as if she was a man.”My words were pouring out freely, but I was far away. In my mind’s eye I couldsee her again, clutching her robe around her throat so that her hand wouldn’ttremble. Aminah was too pregnant to flee, and yet staying behind could mean herdeath.“She had barely heard of the king of Yemen, whose name was Abrahah al-Ashram.You know the insolent vanity of those people. Paradise begins when you cross theborder into their green land. Abrahah despised Mecca for one thing—the Kaaba andthe wealth it brought us. Why shouldn’t hordes of pilgrims come to his kingdominstead of this wretched desert town? In a dream he saw the solution. He had tobuild a shrine so grand and luxurious that it would awe any pilgrim who set eyesupon it. He obeyed his dream and called his bejeweled shrine Qullays. If a godhad spoken in his ear, Abrahah’s ambition might have been realized, but he waslistening to demons. They quickly betrayed him. No pilgrims turned away from theKaaba. The Arabs made up songs ridiculing his gaudy, empty temple. Now Abrahah’svanity turned to anger. He rounded up an army of mercenaries, spear throwers andarchers, the scum of the earth, but experienced in war. They began their marchon Mecca, and what did our Bedouin brothers do? They greased the way with foodand water, sold at a premium. They even provided guides from the hill towns whowere jealous of Mecca. Abrahah created wonder with a pack of huge gray monsters,as the ignorant called them. They had never seen drawings of elephants.”I stopped my story and looked at Muhammad. “You think this is only a tale, butthe future depends on what I’m saying.”He quietly asked me to go on.“When word spread that Abrahah’s army was only a few miles away, the Qurayshgathered in council. The invader sent word that he would kill no innocentcivilians. His wish was to enter the city, raze the Kaaba to the ground, anddepart. The emissary who brought this news was lucky he wasn’t beheaded on thespot. The Quraysh became furious and vowed to defend Mecca to the last man. Oneelder dissented, though. ‘We can rebuild even the most sacred building,’ heargued. ‘But if we die, there will be no one left to bring the Kaaba back.’“That lone voice was your grandfather, Abdul Muttalib. The invaders had scouredthe hills to steal our animals, and he had lost the most, more than a hundredcamels. If Muttalib could keep his head in the face of such a crime, he was theman to send to the enemy camp as ambassador. Muttalib went and bowed beforeAbrahah, although obeisance stuck in his throat like a mouthful of thorns. Tohim he said, ‘Sire, withdraw from our home. We cannot fight you, but our idolsare not under our control. I cannot vouch for what they might do. Accept tributefrom us instead.’ Muttalib offered money and fruit from the best orchards to bepaid in perpetuity. Abrahah sneered at tribute, which he saw as a sign ofweakness.”“Like a true Arab,” Muhammad interrupted.“No, that’s the cruelest part. He was an Abyssinian, a foreigner. Yemen hadfallen to their king. In those days the demon Christ seduced Abyssinia, and hishand was guiding everything.”“From what I’ve heard, Christ doesn’t inspire war,” said Muhammad mildly.I grew irritated. Why did he refuse to see?“Christ inspires whatever makes him more powerful. He’s no different from anyother god,” I said glancing at the wine jug. I resisted temptation, aspersuasion deserts a loose tongue.“Muttalib returned to Mecca with the bad news. He counseled calm. He repeatedAbrahah’s promise not to harm the populace, but panic spread without check likea contagion. Whole streets were abandoned overnight and became prey to wanderingghosts and thieves. The tribal elders held no sway. They fled faster thananyone. Now came the decisive moment.”I paused so that Muhammad would be slightly uneasy, uncertain what I was reallyabout. He knows my reputation for canniness and power brokering. Nothing I do orsay is casual.I let anticipation hang in the air. Then I said, “On the night before theinvader reached our gates, I spied on your grandfather.”“Why?” Muhammad was obviously caught off guard.“Because the Kaaba meant more to his clan than to anyone else. Without theidols, what would happen to the sale of their precious water and the money itbrought? Muttalib had done his best to get his family to safety. The only one hecouldn’t persuade was Aminah, and her peril gave him added incentive. I followedhim from his courtyard to the doors of the Kaaba. He seized the handles withboth hands and began to wail. He wailed to every god he could think of. Heinvoked the one God, Allah, but he didn’t exclude even the most insignificantidol made of cracked plaster. When he was finished, he composed himself. Fromthe shadows I couldn’t hear what he muttered to himself, but we were both Arabs.He left the rest to fate.”I raised my eyebrows. “Can you believe that his prayers were answered?“That very day a sickness fell over Abrahah’s army. Soldiers broke out in soresthat oozed poison. Some say a swarm of biting insects swooped down on theircamp, but I saw with my own eyes. Within hours the troops began falling to theground. A day later they were dying in piles. I sneaked beyond the city wallsand spied on them. There were no insects. An invisible curse felled them. Thewar elephants with brass balls on their tusks stood around listlessly, unable tomove. Like a man caught in a nightmare, Abrahah realized that the predator hadbecome the prey. The tribes would sniff out this calamity and descend to devourhim. He turned tail and ordered an immediate retreat. Suddenly the demon armyand its monsters vanished like a mirage.”“I have listened,” said Muhammad, “but there is a tale within the tale. Why isthis about me?”“Be patient. Your grandfather, Muttalib, was overjoyed, and his prestige soared.Drunken celebrations clogged the streets. Rich men slept with all their wivesand woke up exhausted the next morning. Muttalib remained sober. He called acouncil to create ways to prevent such a threat from ever happening again. Lawswere passed forbidding Jews and Christians from living in Mecca. A street patrolwas formed, and armed men guarded the prosperous neighborhoods.”“The guardians, which you lead,” said Muhammad quietly.I smiled and extended an arm. “I’m not threatening you.”“Then why does it feel that way?” he asked.“Listen to me. The man who demanded that the Jews and Christians be driven outwas your grandfather. His decree rests upon your shoulders.”Muhammad was grim. He had never counted on spies. I knew he consorted with thehanif. The old ones like Waraqah were beyond my power. If I hadn’t liquored upsome half-crazy thugs, Uthman wouldn’t have been warned. And yet it wasnecessary.I expected Muhammad to react with fear or passion, but not with violence. I hadno dagger hidden under my couch for a talk with him. He did surprise me, though.“Do you know why I called you a rebel?” he asked calmly.I shook my head.“Because you lead the revolt against change. The new terrifies you. The dangerisn’t an invisible curse this time. It’s the invisible, period.”I gave a disgusted sigh and reached for the wine jug. There was no reason tohold back now. “You talk like one of them.”“They are us. That’s what you don’t see. What are you really guarding? Slow rot.I smell it in this room.”His voice was strong and steady. He was willing to utter words that get menkilled. Had I underestimated him? I pretended to be unmoved while I recordedeverything he said in my mind.“How are they us?” I asked.“The Quraysh control this city for one reason. It’s not money. My grandfathermade and lost a fortune. His sons were left weak and stripped of riches. I wasreduced to living like a servant in my uncle’s house, the last to be given breadand the first to be beaten when his sons were in a rage. But I know that withoutAbraham, our father, the Quraysh are nothing. We owe him everything. The waterof life springs from him. For years that has meant less and less. What isAbraham without the faith of Abraham? Tell me your answer, and I will join you.If you can’t, rot with the rest.”I cannot imagine how he managed this speech without challenging me to a fight.Muhammad’s eyes flashed, but his hand remained quietly by his side.“You are no longer welcome inside my gate,” I said with cold formality.“I obey with sadness,” he replied.A moment later he vanished. I threw my wine cup across the room. It smashedagainst the wall and dripped purple juice down the plaster. No matter, it wasundrinkable, spoiled by the heat. Flies buzzed around my head, attracted by thesickly sweetness of a drunkard’s breath. There were too many to swat. I coveredmyself with a blanket and waited for sleep."},{"pageContent":"7 [003-TOC.html#chapter_07]A WANDERING MENDICANTBecause I wandered in from the desert, nobody knows my name. They call me “thechick,” because I sit all day with my mouth open, waiting for people walking byto drop food in. It’s a cunning way to beg. Everyone knows who I am, and all ofMecca marvels at how I survive. At times there can be nasty surprises. I’m adecent man, or I would tell you some of the filthy objects street urchins havedropped into my mouth.Today I’m a beggar, but I have ambitions. I hope to become a fool. People pityfools, and those who don’t are at least superstitious about them. The best foolshave gone mad over God. They even think they speak with God’s voice, but it’sall babble. I think about that when I’m curled up in an alley on a cold night.Is it better to be pitied or despised? Those are my two choices.I don’t feel sorry for myself. On feast days and especially weddings it’s goodto sit with your mouth open as the guests pass by. A few will be feeling merryenough to toss a sweet-meat your way. The last wedding was Muhammad’s. Meccacouldn’t stop talking about it. A trader in his twenties marrying an old woman.Why did he agree? It wasn’t for her beauty. The lady Khadijah is forty. Two richhusbands have died on her. So it had to be for her money. He must have played aclose game. The widow is rich enough that she resisted all offers from greedysuitors. Rich enough to be the one who proposed to Muhammad too, not the otherway around. No one felt she was stooping beneath her station, though, becauseKhadijah’s purity is impeccable. She was waiting for a pure husband, they say.And most people were glad that Muhammad was rising. I watched him passing in andout of her gate in the days before the ceremony. Being a beggar, I have a highopinion of him. He’s never thrown a pebble down my throat to see if I’d chokeand get a bit of a laugh, like some others. One day he struck a filthy boy whowas about to drop a ball of dung in my mouth.Naturally, I expected much from the wedding of a man like that. I arrived at thebride’s house a few days early. Mostly women came by, always giggling. I turnedmy face away. It hurts to see the face a pretty woman makes when she sets eyeson me. Next was a young man in dirty sandals carrying a bolt of fine woolencloth. I seized his leg and held on tight.“Let me go,” he cried. “You’re crazy, not blind. Can’t you see I’m only aservant?”But I didn’t let go until he shook his leg and hopped up and down like a nomadbitten by sand fleas. It was funny, really, because he didn’t dare drop the boltof cloth to beat me. After that little prank time hung heavy. I got hungrysitting there with my mouth open, until a large ripe date dropped in. Opening myeyes, I saw Muhammad.“May Allah give you joy,” I murmured, rolling the sweet fruit around on mytongue.Muhammad was in a rush, but he paused with a curious look on his face. “Does thename of Allah help your begging? I wouldn’t think so.”I fawned, hoping for another date. “God shows me who is his son when I amfortunate enough to see one.”“So Allah is just one of your tricks, to see who can be flattered?”Muhammad didn’t say this in an insulting tone. He was smiling and at the sametime he pulled another date from his sash, putting this one in my hand. A properand decent gesture.I bowed. “I’ll tell you my secret, sir. I speak of Allah, because I ampracticing to be a fool. When fools speak of God, people are more likely to besuperstitious about them.” Muhammad shook his head with amused wonder and wenton his way.If I heard the tinkle of ankle bells but no giggling, it was usually Khadijahherself bustling past me on her way somewhere. She is always in motion. A richwoman must work twice as hard as a man to keep thieves from her hoard. In summerher caravans are headed for Syria, in winter for Yemen. She paces around thecamels at dawn, inspecting every bale and sack. But Khadijah isn’t pinch-facedand shrewd, if that’s what you think. She wraps her head in black to go out atnight, and many a poor wretch cowering from the cold and damp has felt her handon his shoulder. She brings soup and a cloak, even to strangers. She busiesherself behind the scenes to marry off her poor relations and drops gold intheir dowries, so that the girls won’t wind up with a crook-backed bully norespectable woman would touch.When she passes me, I murmur ameerat, or “princess.” Khadijah smiles. She’sheard that kind of flattery all her life. More than most, she actually deservesit.One thing about her is resented, though. When feast days come and the otherwomen observe the tradition of running around the Kaaba, she closes her shuttersand stays home. The Hajj is not for her, and Khadijah has enough money that shecan make no bones about it. Behind closed doors, say the gossips, she doesn’tfondle Muhammad’s beard. They sit together and mock the idols. Who knows whattrouble it may get them into one day.As the wedding drew near, the groom’s visits became more frequent. Sometimes hewas too preoccupied to notice me, but if he did, he had a scrap or two to spare.One morning he caught me hobbling to my place by the gate.“How did you become lame?” he asked.“My toes were bitten off by dogs,” I said.“Show me.”I peeled the rags off my feet and let him see the ragged row of toes and stumpswhere curs had chewed on me.“Is your pain severe?” he asked.“Not enough to make me kill myself, but too much to laugh all day,” I replied.Our eyes met. He could see that I wasn’t whining to cadge a bit of bread, and Icould see that he was actually interested. I wasn’t lying at all. My mother madea bad marriage to a drunkard. To make matters worse, her mother-in-law hatedher. One day I was left in her charge when I was still a baby in swaddlingclothes. Out of contempt, my grandmother left me under a tree while she went tothe town well for water. This wasn’t in Mecca, but in one of the hill townssurrounding it, on the edge of the wilderness. My grandmother knew very wellthat packs of wild dogs roam at will, making so brave as to wander into town.Two of them found me under the tree and began to gnaw at my feet, which weresticking out of my bundled clothes. My screams brought a man running, and with astick he beat the dogs off, but not before they had taken a few toes from eachfoot. They say when my grandmother returned, she didn’t wail. Out of spite, itcost her nothing to see me maimed. Not that I remember anything about it. Butone imagines.You should not suppose that Khadijah spotted Muhammad in the marketplace andfelt herself swoon. Nor did he leave love poems pinned to her shutters comparingher almond eyes to a fawn in the moonlight. They were both sober people. Sheknew two things about Muhammad that anyone in business would be intrigued by.First, he was not all that experienced, having left Mecca on small caravans suchas his uncle, Abu Talib, could afford. Second, he could be trusted. Once theArabs pin a name on you, it travels with you the rest of your life. I willalways be “the chick,” and Muhammad expects always to be Al-Amin, the one youcan trust.Khadijah sent her steward Maysarah to greet Muhammad and formally make him anoffer. He was to oversee one of her caravans to Syria, and in return the ladywould pay him twice the commission she usually offered. You’d think thatAl-Amin, the “trustworthy one,” wouldn’t need such an extravagant bribe, butKhadijah understood that a woman must be prepared to pay enough to discouragethieving from her agents.The caravan came and went. The steward Maysarah was sent to keep track of thetrades and balance the books, but he was also part family spy. Having been withKhadijah since her father and mother died, he had his mistress’s ear, and overthe years Maysarah had never betrayed her. When he came home with glowing wordsabout Muhammad’s character, Khadijah broke her vow never to marry. Passiondidn’t carry her away. She waited some months. She continued to line Muhammad’spockets. He rose in her esteem, and one day she sent a messenger, her intimatefriend Nufaysah, who touched Muhammad’s hem with her forehead as if he was themaster, offering Khadijah in marriage. A flurry of negotiations started. Unclesgot involved, haggling over details like men with a thousand camels to lose orgain. Two clans, the Hashim and the Asad, came together on the suitability ofthe match, and thus it was.That’s the story as I heard it from servants who squat in the courtyards andgossip with other servants.Does a woman’s heart melt over balanced accounts and good behavior? You know theanswer as well as I do.It would have been auspicious for rain to fall on the wedding day, but it dawnedbright and hot like every other day. The first to arrive were young malecousins, loose and wild. Being without women, it suited their mood to kick me,as if to prove that someone in this world was more miserable than they. I closedmy mouth when they passed, just to be safe.But I was also sunk in thought. I must find special words for the groom when hecame in procession. It served me well to impress him; he was about to be rich. Ikept turning over the same question in my mind. What would a fool say? ForMuhammad, the best tactic was to babble about God, since I knew he had aweakness there. The crowd was growing thicker now. Like civets, the guests lefta perfumed trail behind them as they entered the bride’s house. Rich robesswirled in the light wind. The richest women had seed pearls dangling from theirgauzy veils. Someone dropped a coin in my mouth, and when I looked closely, itappeared to be silver.At last Muhammad arrived. He smiled to the left and right, but his eyes lookedpensive. He shuffled his feet the way he always did, not lifting them high toprotect his new sandals from the dust. When he came abreast of me, a dozen handswere reaching for him. I didn’t raise my voice, but quietly said, “Lucky is theman who marries God today.”I was in luck. He noticed me and looked down. “I marry a good woman today, notGod,” he said.“She might as well be a bad woman,” I said. “Allah is in all creatures. “Guests who were close enough to overhear us began to mutter angrily. I wastaking a risk if I kept talking such blasphemous nonsense.“Your sons will be sons of God, even if they turn out to be drunks and cheats.Do you believe me?” I said.“I do,” said Muhammad, which caused gasps around him.“Then you are a bigger fool than I am,” I said.“Why?”“Because all words about God are lies. The Infinite is beyond words.”A few feet reached out to kick me, but not Muhammad’s. He didn’t smile or frown,but only betrayed sadness with his eyes. Murmuring softly to himself, he tossedme a coin and entered Khadijah’s house. A burst of laughter and applause greetedhim inside. One Qurayshi came very late, an old man without companions. I wassurprised to see Waraqah. His weakness for God is worse than Muhammad’s. It haslost him most of his respectability.“Allah has truly blessed this house,” I said, rising on my knees as he rushedthrough the gate.Waraqah grimaced. “Forget your tricks. I’m the bride’s cousin. I have to behere.”“For the joy of the occasion,” I murmured, to get back at him. Everyone knewthat old Waraqah hated leaving his house and the mystical studies that devouredhis days and ruined his eyes.“Joy is the fruit of wine,” said Waraqah. “I have no use for it. She wants totalk business after the ceremony.”With that, he rushed inside. Don’t be amazed that a rich man would waste so manywords on a beggar. Waraqah’s God loves all men, which shows you how far thisreligious fever might spread."},{"pageContent":"TWO [003-TOC.html#part_02]THE ANGEL’S EMBRACE"},{"pageContent":"8 [003-TOC.html#chapter_08]KHADIJAH, THE PROPHET’S WIFEWe had no idea. There should have been omens. There were none. God is asunexpected as lightning in the desert. Before he strikes, the sky is as blue ason any other day.Muhammad and I had been married in peace for fifteen years under that sky. Itwas a household of women, four daughters and a wife. There were apricots soakedin rose water on the shelf. When a caravan came home from Syria, each of ourgirls got a precious little bell to hang around her ankle. When my girls walked,a silvery tinkling brightened the path before them.Muhammad could have acted like a king behind these walls, or a beast. It wascommon enough. But I had watched him closely before I unfolded my heart’sdesire. I wasn’t born a fool. He wasn’t the only young man who listened to thepoets in the bazaar and sat in the shade on sweltering days talking with hiscousins. People ridiculed me for offering myself to such a young man. “It’s likebuying a camel and refusing to tie it up,” they said. “It’s in an animal’snature to stray.” My money ensured that none of them laughed to my face, though.I didn’t care that Muhammad had asked his uncle, Abu Talib, for his daughter’shand. The girl was sleek as a cat with eyes as soft as a deer’s. Old Talibrefused him, because he had set his sights on a better marriage with one fromthe Makhzum clan.When Muhammad was new and shy with me, he nervously confessed this failedproposal. I burst out laughing. “Not at you,” I said, seeing his crestfallenlook. “My first two husbands came from the Makhzum clan. They left me twicerich. Is that revenge enough for you?”He paused, weighing his words. “You will lift me far above any life I’ve everknown. My grandfather Muttalib was the last elder in my clan to hold sway. I’m awanderer among men. I listen to songs, but cannot sing. I hear the poets, butcannot read what they say or write better words if I could think of them, whichI can’t.”He was surprised when I shrugged this off. “Two kinds of people can’t read, theilliterate and royalty. We’ll just pretend you’re a king. My foreman will readfor you.”If Muhammad had turned into a tyrant after we married, I would have had onlymyself to blame. No one in Mecca saw what we did the day before the wedding.They would not have believed it. We bartered over our future. Well, I did.“How do you intend to treat me?” I asked.“How would you like to be treated?” he said. Caution. I like that in a man. Hesmiled. “They call you a princess, but I was born too low to be any good as acourtier.”“Treat me like a beautiful young girl,” I said. “But never let me guess what youreally think.”“That is what I really think,” he said, as soberly as if he were assessing theweight of a Byzantine gold piece.We were lying on a couch—not touching—with the shutters closed and all theservants ordered from the house. It does no good to hide behind doors. Theyalways eavesdrop, just as they always steal from the olive jar and pretend thatyesterday’s lamb has gone bad.I remembered how I looked in the mirror that morning. I said, “Never be temptedby other women. Betrayal would shame me, and shame would kill me.” Withoutthinking, my fingers traced a wrinkle around my eyes, still a shallow wrinkle.Before long it would be a crease.“There’s no reason to be afraid. I am betrayed every day. I know shame,”Muhammad said.I couldn’t hide my surprise. “Who betrays you?”“My tongue, which is why I rarely speak.” Muhammad meant his accent, which, totell the truth, everyone notices. He spent too much time with the Bedouinbecause of his timid mother, who postponed the day he would have to breathefilthy city air. Twenty years later, he sounds faintly as if he just stepped outof a sheep enclosure in the hills. We were comfortable together, lying there,each lost in a dream of what this marriage would be like. His accent wascharming to me.Finally, and with a blush I didn’t know I possessed, I said, “Don’t reveal anyother women you’ve been with. But I have to know that you aren’t sick.” If I hadpicked the right suitor, he had to be pure.“But I am sick. Some days I think it’s fatal.”Muhammad rose and walked to the window, peering through the cracks in theshutter. His face was streaked with light and shade, like the image of a zebramy father brought back from Abyssinia when I was a girl.“Mecca is my sickness,” he murmured. “I get infected again every day. Sometimeswith fear, sometimes with rage. On the streets I see the walking dead, and myclan, the Hashim, are almost beggars. I may never recover.” He turned around andsaw my mystified look. “As for my body, it has no weaknesses. You could storewine in my belly and load my back with saddle bags like a camel.”An Arab cannot consider himself respectable unless he has skill in lying. Ourlife is haggling. We barter to stay one step ahead of drought, famine, and themalicious gods. This back-and-forth with my fine young Muhammad could have beenthe prelude to disaster. I knew that it wasn’t. Not from woman’s intuition. Iknew because Muhammad passed my tests. He asked nothing for himself. He didn’tinsinuate that I should pity him for being an orphan. He didn’t sit in profileso I could admire his curved nose or carelessly dangle a curl over his forehead.Not that a woman doesn’t notice.Even so, I hesitated. My father taught me a saying: “A chameleon doesn’t leaveone tree until he is sure of the next.” I had the cook put rare dishes on thetable—roast duck bathed in pomegranate syrup, deep-sea fish so delicate that theskin glistened like a rainbow. I did this to see if he salivated. A poor mancannot help but drool, and if he drools over a duck, how secretly he must bedrooling over my money. Muhammad’s eyes didn’t even wander to the food. He kepthis gaze on me. A woman can resist anything but attention.It wouldn’t surprise me to know that Allah watched our every move, heard ourevery word. They were probably his words in some way, fated and sealed. All mylife, I assumed that my will was mine. I had more strength than ten other women.I was called “princess,” not “surrender.” It’s a shock to realize that all thistime my will was God’s.It was his will that our two baby boys died in the cradle. I awoke one morningbefore dawn. It wasn’t the hour when a baby usually cries. On that morning, whenthe first boy died, the silence in the house was different, as if the angel ofdeath had whispered overhead. I couldn’t bring myself to run into the baby’sroom, but sent a servant. And the second time? I had a dream of a boy runningafter a flock of sheep in the mountains. He looked down at his feet as he ran,and he saw the shadow of a wolf. Before he could cry out, I awoke.Muhammad didn’t want any women to wail over our babies after they died; heforbade mourners in the house. When I asked him why, he said, “If an orphancan’t handle grief alone, he won’t survive.” Rarely did he speak of his pastthat way. No matter how deep into his eyes I gazed, I never saw scars on hisheart. Strange, given that this life is made of scars.But it wasn’t in me to wail, either. I had married off three grown childrenbefore I ever met Muhammad. My new babies were precious, but if one died, a partof me wasn’t ripped away. I kept this a secret, but Muhammad sensed it. He wasunhappy when I ordered two animals to be sacrificed in the Kaaba. It wasconsidered only prudent to appease the gods after any kind of misfortune. I wasdressing in a black veil when he appeared at the bedroom door, tight-lipped. Hisface was pale.“Are you going? You don’t have to,” he said. I told him that I couldn’t leavesomething like this to servants.“And which gods do you think will help us?” he asked. He ticked off the names ofHubal, Al-Lat, Manat, and Al-Uzza. In Mecca everyone sacrifices to them, eventhose who have doubts. We’re practical. It costs little enough to please theidols.“I don’t know which one. All of them,” I said. I tried to sound casual as Ismeared an extra layer of kohl around my eyes as a sign of grief. But I feltguilty pretending to be a believer. Who knows? Maybe one of the gods cursed ourbabies, or us. These things are impossible to fathom. I watched Muhammadstanding behind me in the little polished mirror.“You can forbid me to go,” I said.In a sarcastic voice that he rarely used, he said, “Can a husband pretend to bemore powerful than all the gods? Go if you must.”I went. It wasn’t piety that drove me, but fear and grief. I didn’t want thegods’ disfavor. But I didn’t want their protection either, the way common,superstitious people do. If I had dragged ten terrified animals to the altar andwatched their throats being slit, would that have saved my two babies? What Iwanted was to have the knife in my heart come out. Although I kept mydesperation quiet, I had to find relief. If the gods existed—if only oneexisted—maybe it had the power to grant mercy to one in pain. The sacrifice wasmade, with many citizens standing around and nodding their approval.When I came home, Muhammad asked me if I felt better. I shook my head. I feltashamed to put on such a dumb show before gawkers and idlers, people whose onlyinterest was in seeing a rich woman suffer despite her money.I’ve never pretended to have humility, but my pride didn’t stop me from runningto Muhammad and begging his forgiveness. He lifted up my face and asked me tolook at him. Then he said, “I understand your despair. Bring it to me. Half yourpain comes from keeping it a secret.”I can’t say that the knife immediately withdrew from my heart just because I hada kind husband. That took many months. But my husband and I sat up the rest ofthe night talking between us about things that wives rarely speak about, such asour sense of frailty. When we stand so low in creation, as every girl is taught,our hope is that at least the gods will give us strength. I was such a girl,wondering where protection would come from in a violent world.Giving birth is a death sentence for one mother in six, maybe more. I’m willingto believe, but in what? The finger of fate passes over the scrolls and choosesthis one for pain, that one for delight, this one for life, that one for death.Has this invisible hand ever been seen by anyone, even the most devout? Onceseen, would it change just because a pitiful suffering woman cries out? Fatewipes out creatures by the thousands with a single flash flood in the hills or asummer of drought. We humans are creatures too, subject to the same whimsicalcatastrophes.This episode of the sacrifice could have caused Muhammad to condemn me; instead,it brought us closer. We found that we shared no brilliant answers. We sharedthe same questions instead, and that was enough.It was my custom to go to the bazaar every morning to inspect the goods and keepan eye on prices. Once I got married there was no practical need for me to dothis. I had turned all my business affairs over to Muhammad. He resisted atfirst. “There is no need. You’ve run your own affairs for years,” he argued.“And if it’s my pride you’re worried about, don’t.”“It’s the pride of every other man I’m worried about,” I said. They could barelyendure taking orders from a woman. I didn’t want them whispering behindMuhammad’s back that I married him just so I could emasculate him.I won’t say the matter was settled in one conversation. It’s always delicatewhen a poor man is yoked to a rich woman. Muhammad understood. When a big ox anda small ox try to pull a cart together, it will likely tip over. I told my oldsteward, Maysarah, to present all the accounts to my husband from now on. Heraised an eyebrow, but obeyed. So you see, I could have spent the rest of mylife behind doors driving the servants crazy, the way respectable women do. Itried. After two weeks Muhammad begged me, for my own sanity and everyoneelse’s, to keep up my customary ways. The caravan camps were my natural habitat.As he put it, I would still be a lady even if my sandals smelled of camel dung.Unlike the chameleon, I jumped to a new tree, but kept one foot on the old one.I went on my inspections even when I was with child. The first delivery was twomonths away when an old man called out to me, “So it’s true. You really didchange your sex.”It was Waraqah, who had only grown stranger as he grew older. He was sitting ona low wall in the warm winter sun. My legs were sore from waddling down thecobbled street, and I decided to have a rest beside him.“Ah,” he said. “You’ve given up a man’s life, but you’re still as brave as aman.”“Let people talk. I don’t have to be brave to sit beside you,” I said. “UnlessI’ve made a mistake and you still have a tooth left in your head.”He tilted his head back and gave a croaking laugh. “I’m not the one who willbite you if you’re seen with me. There are others who will be happy to do it.”He was only half joking. The rich old man was regarded with suspicion among theelders. Waraqah no longer sat with them in the inns, and he hadn’t made thingsany easier for himself by hanging around the Kaaba, muttering oaths at thepilgrims who passed nearby.I said, “You don’t fool me, you know.” The veins in my legs had stoppedthrobbing. I balanced myself on the wall so that my swollen belly didn’t make myback ache so much. “You’re not as cracked as they say.”Waraqah shot me a sidelong glance. “If I’m not cracked, then what am I?”I searched my mind, but he didn’t wait for a reply. “The word you’re looking foris subversive. I’m a snake in a basket of dates. Like your husband.”The expression on my face made him give out another croaking laugh. “You’ve madehim rich, and you did it overnight. But a dangerous mind doesn’t get lessdangerous swathed in finery.”I was struck silent, which seemed to please Waraqah. The penalty for freethinking had gotten severe during the past few years. Mecca was no longer thecity I grew up in. We breathed suspicion. Muhammad wanted to keep his good name,but he would no longer be Al-Amin, the trusted one, if people couldn’t trust hisopinions. For most men, words are the same as thoughts. As soon as a thought isin their head, it’s on their tongue. My husband had thoughts he didn’t speak.The change that came over the city happened almost the day that the gatesslammed shut behind Abrahah and his army. It wasn’t enough that the invaders allfell sick and their war elephants retreated like a mirage in the desert. Meccafelt defenseless as never before. A foreigner had breached the one barricade wethought was impassable, the desert. Now the Qurayshi elders decreed that noChristian or Jew should set foot inside Mecca. Since the idols had saved thecity by miraculously defeating the invaders, they should have no competition.Foreign gods were banned, and worshiping them meant death or exile. One ofMuhammad’s own cousins was exposed as a hanif who bowed to one God and wasforced to flee. The hanif were no more to be seen, except for Waraqah, and hehad grown much quieter.The rights of Jews and Christians meant nothing. To ordinary people only theirmoney did. If a Jew was so rich that his business couldn’t be done without him,he could pay a levy to come within the city walls. Once here, he couldn’t beseen praying or doing obeisance to his god, Yahweh.The Quraysh had risen to such power that they were able to enforce thesedecrees. Abu Talib listened to Muhammad’s pleas for tolerance. Waraqah mutteredat the door of the Kaaba. They were powerless to intervene, however, when thewhole tribe stood against them. “I’ve tried to wear them down,” Abu Talib saidmournfully. “My words evaporated like a summer shower hitting a hot stone wall.”The rabble were organized into gangs who roamed the alleys beating on drunks andfrightening servant girls on their way to the well with water jugs. A hushsettled over the city. If you clamp down, people will obey, and the obedient canbe mistaken for the contented, if you squint hard enough. To hear the elderstalk about it, the Year of the Elephant, as everyone started to call it, becamethe beginning of a golden age.This state of Mecca went through my mind as I sat beside Waraqah. “Get pregnant.Drop as many young as you want,” he said. “But deep down you’re with us.”I looked at the ground, pressing my fingers into my upper thigh to make thebiggest blue vein stop bulging.“So I’m not far wrong,” he muttered, interpreting my silence. “I can tell yousomething else. Muhammad broke my heart when he left the cause. There were onlyfour hanif to stand up for the truth, and we were all growing old. I think ofyour husband every day, but we barely speak when our paths cross. Maybe now Ihave an understanding with you.”“Perhaps.”It was Waraqah’s turn to look surprised. “What gives a woman this kind ofcourage? I was just goading you.”I shrugged. It wasn’t courage, though. My caravans have traveled the length ofthe Arab world, from Yemen to Syria. When they returned home, I sat my men downand made them tell me about what they saw and heard. My father didn’t raise meto be ignorant. Like Muhammad, he was fond of the old sayings. One of them isthis: “A fat woman is better in winter than a blanket.” My father would frownand say to me, “I want you to be more than a better blanket when you grow up.”My men told me in particular how foreigners think, because when you know what isin a customer’s mind, you have an advantage over him. That’s how it began. Aftera while, though, the peculiarity of men’s minds gained its own fascination.Arabs believe that Abraham built the Kaaba, but Jews believe he founded theirtribe in Jerusalem. We say that God ordered Abraham to sacrifice his older son,Ishmael. The Jews say it was his younger son, Isaac. Muhammad was a bit shockedthat I knew such things, perhaps more shocked that they made me think skepticalthoughts about the idols surrounding the Kaaba. He quickly realized, however,that this was a bond between us. We rarely spoke about it.“I don’t mind being hated, you know,” said Waraqah out of the blue. “A thousandcurses never tore a shirt.”I smiled. That was another of my father’s sayings. The old man and I wererelaxed now. He pointed to a donkey some yards away. The animal was tied to along stick attached to a grinding stone. He trudged in slow circles, and as hedid a lazy-looking boy threw grain under the millstone to be ground into coarseflour.“There is your common Arab,” said Waraqah. “He walks in circles and thinks he’sgetting somewhere. Tie an idol to his nose, and he thinks the gods are leadingthe way to Paradise.”The old man was growing deaf, and he said these words in a voice loud enoughthat two merchants passing by overheard him. They looked our way and frowned.Then seeing who it was, they bowed and moved on quickly.I got up and dusted off my skirts, which were speckled with chaff from themillstone. “You know people who were driven out of Mecca,” I said. “They talkedthe way you do.”“They didn’t see what’s coming. I’ve read the signs. I can afford to wait.”With this strange comment Waraqah waved me on my way, saying that we’d meetagain. When I returned home, I told Muhammad everything. I didn’t leave out thathe had broken Waraqah’s heart. He winced but said nothing, and when I asked himto open his mind to me, my husband said, “Better a free dog than a caged lion.”Men. They could pass their whole lives with old sayings. And yet I knew that myencounter struck deep inside him."},{"pageContent":"9 [003-TOC.html#chapter_09]JAFAR, A SON OF ABU TALIBIt finally happened. A jinn has driven Muhammad mad. He was seized in the hillssomewhere, inside a cave, they say. Why was he there in the first place? It iswell known that jinns hole up in caves, and the wind that blows through theblackness is their howling. Even shepherd boys won’t chase a lost lamb into acave without making a cut in their forearm and offering drops of blood to thegods.A stranger in the street told me what had happened, which meant that the newswas spreading fast. I ran to Muhammad’s house near the center of town. Who wouldI meet there? My family is Hashim, and our first instinct would be to gather theclan around any member who’s in trouble. But trouble isn’t the same as beingseized by a demon. That kind of thing is infectious. It was just as likely thatI’d run into spies sent by the Qurayshi elders. I wouldn’t put it past them touse this as a pretext for seizing control of Muhammad’s affairs. Anything to getclose to his wife’s money.There were no spies and no Hashim men milling around, though. There was nobodyat all. A stray dog was sniffing at the locked gate. I stood there, listening.In a house of women there’s always something going on. Gossip, clattering pots,the clack of a loom. Here, there was nothing. I considered pounding on the gateand shouting for somebody to come. I was quite anxious for him. I would beg hiswife to bring in a priest or a worker in spells. I looked around. The houses arepressed close together near the Kaaba, and my shouts would be overheard.Reluctantly I walked away. I wasn’t an elder, and feeble as the Hashim havebecome, it’s the elders’ business to help or condemn one of their own. Let itnever be said that I was the first to move against him by raising an alarm.I fretted all the way home. Muhammad has strange ways. Everyone knows that, notleast his family. I heard that he and some others, including his oldest friend,Abu Bakr, had gathered by night to swear an oath. A secret ceremony? I hate thehanif, but to tell you the truth, that sounded promising. My cousin is too soberfor his own good. The spice of intrigue wouldn’t hurt. Once the oath was madepublic, I ran to Muhammad in disgust.“What is this? You’ve sworn to give to the poor? What the gods won’t do, you aregoing to do instead?”It was ridiculous. I’m not yet forty, but I agree with the old ones who grumblethat this kind of sacrilege will tear society apart. Muhammad listened to meranting for a few minutes, saying nothing. His silence made me more agitated.“You think a man’s life should be about helping dirty, squalid slaves?” I cried.“I don’t know what a man’s life should be about. That’s precisely why I helpdirty, squalid slaves,” he replied calmly. “Do you have a few you can spare?”Muhammad became even stranger after his marriage. I, his favorite cousin, nolonger could tap at his window to run off on an adventure. No one ever supposedhe would lose his mind. I ached for news that he was all right. Muhammadwouldn’t leave his house, but gossip can pass through the tiniest crack in afortress. Soon servants ran from the house of Abu Bakr to see what my father waswilling to pay for scraps of news. They were excited, out of breath. Abu Talibwas taking a nap as usual, so I met them. I sat them down and gave out dates andwell water. I saw them furtively slip the fruit into their robes rather than eatit.“Tell me, quick,” I demanded. “If you’re spreading scandal, I’ll have youwhipped.”The youngest one, a curly-haired Syrian who was good-looking and thereforepresentable among people of quality, spoke up. “He was wandering in the hills byhimself. Very dangerous. Some people don’t never return, and those people hadideas, just like him.”“What do you know about ideas?” I asked angrily.The Syrian slave gave me an insolent stare, and my hand itched to take out theleather crop I keep under my robe. But I let him proceed.“I know about tahannuf,” he said. “My master has gone on such a one. He thinkshe goes into the hills by himself, but I am sent along to keep guard. Out ofsight, you can bet. He wouldn’t like it.”Well, it’s no crime to go on tahannuf. For as long as we can remember, Arabshave sought solace in the wilderness. The meadows outside Mecca are ideal forthis—green and quiet, closer to heaven. As for myself, I help to make sure Meccastays filthy, if you know what I mean. But the Syrian’s master, Abu Bakr, tooktahannuf every spring, and so did Muhammad. Muhammad’s interest in businessaffairs had steadily waned, year by year. Even his four daughters found himaloof; he had turned away from our world, vainly hoping to find another.“What are you telling me? Nothing new,” I said. I reminded this insolent slaveof an old saying: “A grateful dog is worth more than an ungrateful man.” Tounderline the point, I held out a small coin. Despite himself, his eyes widenedgreedily.He said, “I’m telling you, great sir, I have seen men kidnapped when they go onsuch retreats. I’ve hidden behind rocks and watched their throats get cut andtheir bodies flung into gullies. Some of them still had money in their purses.”“They didn’t have money for long,” I said dryly. “You can vouch for that, can’tyou?”The ambushes couldn’t be denied. Who goes on tahannuf but the devout? And no oneis more devout than these troublemakers who cry out against our sacred ways.Some of them go into the hills to find their God, and we make sure they do. Itserves as a warning to the rest. Muhammad had more sense.“So you were sent in secret to spy on Muhammad?” I asked.“To protect him, great sir, not to spy.”“Abu Bakr had reason to fear for his friend’s life?”The Syrian slave bit his tongue; it wasn’t his place to divulge his master’sintentions. He looked surprised when I put the coin in his palm and closed hishand around it. “You did well,” I murmured. I love Muhammad. Once my father tookhim in as an orphan, he became my brother. In a tolerant voice I asked the slaveto spare no details. He had to tell me what he saw that made Muhammad lose hismind.“For a long time, he did nothing out of the ordinary,” the slave began. “MasterMuhammad liked to walk on the slopes of Mount Hira, because it lies only an hourby foot from the city walls. I got bored following him. It didn’t come into myhead that he was searching for something, a hideaway, like. One day he found alonely cave whose mouth was hidden by brush. He cleaned the cave of all thenasty debris and animal skeletons, even washing the floor himself with ragsdipped in a stream. He began to take long retreats inside the cave, sometimesfrom dawn to nightfall. There were times when he had to use the stars to guidehis way home. Like I told you, I was bored something terrible. I became restlesssitting down below on the hillside with nothing to do but wait for him to leave.What use is there in avoiding other people like that? A rich man should enjoyhimself. He should spread his money wherever he can find wine and women.”The slave thought he was playing to my nature, but I showed no reaction. He wenton.“Master Muhammad’s trips to the cave started coming more often. One day Icouldn’t help myself. I fell asleep in the sun, and when I opened my eyes,Muhammad was standing over me. He smiled a secret smile, but spoke not a word.We two made our way down the mountain together. That didn’t stop my master. Heinsisted I keep watch even if Muhammad had caught on.”“Listen carefully,” I said. “Did you see any signs?”“Of madness? No, great sir.”“Signs of anything unusual?”I put my question cautiously. It seemed impossible that Muhammad was castingspells or trying to lure jinns to help him with some dark business. He wasn’tcapable of such things (although I know more than a few who are).The Syrian thought for a moment before replying. “He had moods. Of that I’msure.”“What kind of moods? I thought you hung back, hiding from him?” I queried.“At first. But once he caught on to me, we kept company. He wanted to talk.” Theslave’s voice was hesitant. People of quality share their lives with servants.There’s no other choice. We’re surrounded by them day and night, but there’s abarrier between us. The slave would be doing Muhammad no good by saying that hehad lowered that barrier.Do you want proof of how anxious I was? I went into the pantry and brought outthe best bread and cold lamb. Without a word I spread the victuals out on thetable. The slave watched warily. I tore off a piece of flatbread, wrapped itaround a morsel of meat, and handed it to him. I was willing to lower thebarrier that far to get more news, but the look in my eyes warned the Syrian notto push me. I knew I should have called the slave by his name, but I forgot toask. I doubted that I would ever see him again.“It’s dry,” he mumbled as he chewed. The cheeky bastard wanted me to bring outsome wine. I ignored him. When he had swallowed, I told him to finish his story.He said, “Muhammad and me talked almost every day coming down the mountain. Heliked to ask me questions.”I couldn’t hide my surprise. “What kind of questions?”“It depended on his mood. That’s what I’m trying to tell you.” The slave eyedthe lamb. I gave a curt nod, and he took another chunk, holding it in his fistuntil he satisfied what I wanted to know. “One day we saw a dead kid goat in aditch. It had fallen in and broken its leg. The dogs got to it before anyoneheard it. Muhammad stood a long time staring at the gnawed carcass. ‘Where isthat goat now?’ he muttered. I assumed he was talking to himself, so I didn’trespond. He looked over at me and said, ‘I lost two sons before they even knewthey had a father. I lost my father before he knew he had a son. Where are theynow?’“I was nervous, but I spoke up. ‘Wherever they were,’ I said, ‘it was differentfrom where dead goats go.’ He laughed and said, ‘A good answer, but it wrigglesout of the question.’ After that he was quiet all the rest of the way home.”I held up my hand for him to stop talking. I needed a moment to think. Muhammadnever mourned his lost sons properly before the gods. Word started going aroundthat he was a secret unbeliever. Because the Hashim clan was too weak, AbuTalib, my father, couldn’t send anyone out to punish those who talked againstMuhammad. We had to swallow our pride and take it. But if this Syrian was to bebelieved, the thought of those two dead babies preyed on him. Jinns sniff outweakness of mind; they know how to twist the knot of self-torment inside a man.“Did he talk about his dead sons again?” I asked. The slave shook his head. “Didhe ever bring his new son to the cave?” The slave shook his head again.This new son was another piece of strange business. Muhammad is forty this year,but his wife, who is fifteen years older, cannot give him more children. He gaveno sign that this was a grief for him. Then one day he came home and said, “Iwant you to buy me a son.”Khadijah was all but speechless. “Who?” she asked, keeping her wits about her.Muhammad explained that he was wandering through the bazaar when his eyes fellupon a young boy being sold as a slave. A raiding party had just returned totown, with captives taken on the trading routes. These raiders have only onethought in mind, to grab their prey and get away without being killed. Theynever think to take care of their prizes, so that they can be fit to be sold.Like the others, this boy was starving and gaunt. His eyes were sunken, but whenMuhammad stared at him, the boy stared back defiantly. As if he had any power todo anything. But Muhammad was impressed, and he thought of the future.A woman of Khadijah’s age doesn’t usually want to discuss what might happen inthe future. She agreed to buy the boy for Muhammad. When he was brought to thehouse, she was just as impressed by him as her husband was. They changed hisname from “Zayd, son of who knows what” to “Zayd, son of Muhammad.” So now thewealth of a lifetime may be passed on to a foreign captive. One day I may haveto fight him for my share.The Syrian was waiting impatiently for my next question. The only one left wasthe obvious. “What happened to drive Muhammad mad?”“Jinns,” said the slave quickly.I frowned. “Don’t repeat what everyone else is saying. You were there. What didyou see?”The slave trusted me enough to tell the truth. “I saw a man running away fromsomething he can never understand. We were on the mountain, but Master Muhammaddidn’t come out of the cave at sunset. I didn’t know what to do. He has stayedall night before, when it’s warm enough. I could run home and sleep in a warmbed, then go back at dawn, and nobody would be the wiser. But I stayed. Ramadanis a strange month, they say. I didn’t know what might happen. So I wrappedmyself on the ground and tried to sleep. The next thing I knew, Master Muhammadstepped right over me. His heel brushed my shoulder, and I looked up to see him.He was as white as the dead. He acted as if he didn’t see me lying there, butjust kept walking, at a fast pace. Like I said, he was running from something. Igathered myself and ran after him. He didn’t look like a man who was in thisworld. No matter how loud I called, he wouldn’t look back or answer me. We wentlike that until we got to town. Muhammad stopped in his tracks and stared at thesky. He wasn’t staring like some ordinary lunatic, but as if he expected someoneto fly down. If we had been inside the walls, people would have gawked, I cantell you. Then he shuddered so hard I could see his body quiver under his thickrobes. A few minutes later we went through the gates, and I followed him homeuntil he shut himself up inside.”So, there you are. The worse had come to the worst. I turned my face away. Ididn’t want the slave to get the satisfaction of seeing the effect his tale hadon me. With a wave of the hand I signaled for him to leave. He and the otherslaves wasted no time bolting out the door. Abu Bakr would surmise that histrusted Syrian was selling information. I sighed. Tomorrow he would find anotherrich house and another one willing to fling some coins at him. Muhammad’sreputation was dashed. Our enemies were already laughing with glee.Which is worse, the wickedness of the world or the curse of demons? I sat therepondering the question until the night robbed the room of all light. Muhammaddidn’t deserve this fate. Or maybe he did. Ill luck befalls any man who thinkshe can pry the gods’ secrets out of their fists."},{"pageContent":"10 [003-TOC.html#chapter_10]RUQAYAH, MUHAMMAD’S THIRD DAUGHTERHis first fear was for himself. For his soul, I mean. My father knew thatsomething must have gone horribly wrong. Only later did we discover that he hadrun from the cave to the top of the mountain to hurl himself onto the rocksbelow. He never suspected God’s wrath. Yet when he summoned the light, itshattered him. Allah can drive someone as mad as any demon.I was showing my littlest sister, Fatimah, who was barely five, how to pickflowers in the courtyard when he staggered home. “My child!” he cried, claspingFatimah so hard to his breast that she could hardly breathe. His agitation mademe tremble. After a long, deep stare into Fatimah’s eyes, he ran to his room andbolted the door. I don’t think he even recognized me.We will never forget the seventeenth day of Ramadan. The brunt of it fell on mymother. I watched her pace the floor, growing paler and paler. That first day welived in dreadful silence. My father allowed no one to approach him. Leaning athis door, we girls heard weeping and loud, tormented cries. I tell you, I hadheard the words “gnashing of teeth,” but the actual sound, like stones grindingtogether, is horrifying.On the second day he allowed my mother into the room. When she emerged again,her face was set and grim. I thought my father must be dying. When I asked her,my mother said, “Some things are worse than dying. There is also death in life.”She wouldn’t let me ask any more questions, but sent me to fetch the servants.When they were assembled, my mother put on a face of incredible calm.“I won’t lie to you. The worst may not have happened, but if not, God save usfrom the worst,” she said.My mother couldn’t stop the anxious cries her words caused, but she quicklymoved on to allay them. “None of you will have to leave. You are safe with me.You’ve heard the sounds of your master in torment. If you love him and trust me,listen to my orders.”With that she told the servants to run to our relatives among the Hashim andbring them to her.” Don’t give out any details. It’s not for you to suggestanything, not with a certain tone of voice or a rolling of the eyes. This is noidle moment. It’s a crisis that will tell me everything about who you are fromthis day forward.”What could they say? My mother’s will subdued the servants as long as they werebehind our walls. As they ran off to gather the clan, some may have panicked orindulged in wild fantasies. We all did. As soon as the house was empty, mymother took me aside into a private corner with my two older sisters. Fatimahcould be distracted by giving her a doll to play with in the next room.“Your father isn’t mad. He has been overwhelmed,” she said. “We will nurse him.We will watch over him. Those things go without saying. I know they are thedesires of your heart. But only waiting will tell the tale.”“What has overwhelmed him?” asked Zaynab. As the oldest, she had the right tospeak first. Later as events unfolded, she was not so faithful to my father.Zaynab’s mind was occupied every waking hour with getting a husband. Even atthat critical moment, her thoughts lived halfway in another man’s house.“He doesn’t have enough of his wits back to make sense,” said my mother, who wasalways candid with us. “He mumbles the word ‘power’ over and over.”In Arabic she said qadr. The only way for me to explain the word to strangers is“power.” For us there are hints and shadows in this word. It signifies amystery, a holy presence that has descended to shatter one’s body and mind.My second sister, Umm Kulthum, stole a glance in my direction. She didn’t wantto understand anything at first. Her instinct was to protect the young ones.Besides Fatimah, there was the slave boy Zayd. He was new, and we had notlearned to think of him as our brother yet. He was some years older thanFatimah, but too young to understand how a grown man in the space of a singlenight could turn into a quivering heap.The Hashim men came quickly, demanding in loud voices to set eyes on Muhammadfor themselves. My mother refused. “You will see him when he’s himself again.What lies in that room is not Muhammad.”An unfortunate choice of words. Mutterings about jinns arose. My mother knewthey would, but something else was on her mind. She had to keep Muhammad’s namefrom being ruined. Instead of fighting with rumors, she went on the offensive.“When was the Kaaba in ruins? When was it rebuilt? Let any man step forward whodid more to rebuild it than my Muhammad.”The rumbling began to die down. You see, the Hashim were so poor and trampled onthat they had little left but their honor. My father was the most honorableamong them. He earned that title five years before. The Kaaba had become ashambles. A wag said that it was a good thing pilgrims came for the Hajj to runaround the Kaaba, because if they dared to touch it the walls would fall down.As things stood, no one was willing to repair the sagging roof and the cracksthat ran from top to bottom. Fate then stepped in. A flash flood stormed throughthe center of town. The waters dug a course straight for the Kaaba, almostsubmerging it.In a panic people ran to save the idols. My mother laughed at that. “They can’twait to rescue the very gods that caused this,” she muttered. By the time thewaters receded, the roof had collapsed. There was no choice now. A certainfaction was still too superstitious to intervene, holding that the walls weresacred, even though they were on the verge of falling down. To touch them riskedangering the gods even more.Others grew disgusted with this attitude. The issue was settled when Al-Mugirah,a rough, sensible type, walked up to the Kaaba in front of everyone with asledgehammer. He took a swing and knocked a huge gap in one of the walls.“If the gods want to kill me, let them do it now,” he shouted.Nothing happened, so it was decided to start over and build a shrine that wouldlast forever. All at once the very clans that wanted to kill each other to keepthe Kaaba intact vied to make a new one. That too proved futile, for when theygot down to the foundations, a layer of green stone was exposed that could notbe broken, no matter how many burly slaves knocked at it. The Quraysh declaredthat the foundation was laid by Abraham and must not be touched.My father watched quietly off to one side. He came home one night and said, “Afellow brought a bowl of blood to the work site today. He held it up in the air,screaming that his clan was entitled to finish the work, no one else. He wasbacked up by twenty toughs with knives drawn. Who knows where he got so muchblood? It spilled over the edge of the bowl and streaked his face while hescreamed.”Yet this bizarre incident made my father’s fortune in a strange way. There wasone stone set in the eastern wall of the Kaaba that my father told us to hold inreverence. It was black and polished and about the width of a large man’s hand.“We are the people of Abraham, and when he built this shrine, he laid in place asingle stone from the time of Adam and Eve. In that stone is our hope,” he said.I didn’t know what my father meant by “our hope,” but I can’t remember a timewhen the Black Stone was not touched and bowed before by every pilgrim.When it came time to set the Black Stone back in place, a feud broke out amongthe clans. Nobody wanted to grant the privilege to anyone else. At the sametime, no one wanted to risk the wrath of the gods by not claiming it forhimself. Fights broke out daily at the site, until it was decided that only oneman, Muhammad, was trusted enough by all the clans to settle the dispute.Muhammad wasn’t eager to go. I found him lingering by the gate with his bestrobe on, washing his hands in a basin, then calling for fresh water so he couldwash them again.“It’s a sly tactic to call on me,” he said. “There is no one who deserves theprivilege over anybody else. Whoever I choose, the rest will be furious with me.They will fall on each other’s necks, and when the dust clears, our family willbe blamed. We will be weaker than ever, which is the whole point.”You wouldn’t think that the same man would have returned home two hours laterwreathed in smiles. “I did it,” he said with quiet exultation. He called for thebest sweet wine and even diluted it three times with water so we girls coulddrink.“What did you do?” my mother asked, as baffled as anyone.“I stared solemnly at the rock for a long time, as if it was going to deliver ananswer. In fact, I was scouring my brain in mounting desperation. Then thesimplest idea occurred to me. I ordered that someone bring a large sheet ofcloth. I had the Black Stone placed in the center and signaled for the elders ofthe four major clans to each take a corner of the sheet. ‘Now lift it togetherto the height where the stone will be placed,’ I said. ‘Then you will all sharein the honor and reap the same reward from the gods.’”From that moment on my father earned a respectful nod and a raised beaker at theinns. But he insisted to us, his family, that he wasn’t wise. “I am only a manamong men. The point was to give these hotheads an escape route, so theywouldn’t lose face. Nothing more. If the gods noticed, they were as amused as Iwas.”My mother’s efforts to remind the clan of their debt to my father worked to holdoff the spiral of ruin momentarily.Several days later my father appeared at the door of his room. He still lookedpale and stunned, but he held his arms out, and one by one his daughters raninto them. When I embraced him, it felt as if half his body had wasted away. Thelast to be embraced was Fatimah, who was frightened by the deep black circlesaround my father’s eyes.You could see that he was hurt when Fatimah backed away. “What’s wrong, mychild?”“I want my papa back,” she blurted out and burst into tears.My father swept her into his arms, calming Fatimah’s fears. Even as he did this,he looked around at the rest of us. His eyes said, “And do you think your papais not here?”You must understand, during that terrible week we held the family together bynot speaking our deepest fears out loud. I asked to be taken to the Kaaba topray. I’m sure my sisters did as well. We avoided looking at one another duringmeals. Some of the servants weakened and began to spread rumors; my motherwasn’t above taking a stick to them.Then as quickly as we lost him, my father became himself again. Like a patientwhose fever has broken, he mastered his crisis. I don’t know how he did it. Yetone day I found him sitting alone on the floor of the pantry eating oneflatbread after another between gobbets of lamb and beakers of well water. Whenhe saw me, he burst out laughing.“Forgive me, Ruqayah, you shouldn’t see your father with a greasy chin and bitsof food hanging from his beard. But I am famished!”“Your chin? Papa, you should see yourself. Your whole face looks like Fatimah’swhen she’s gotten loose in the butter.” I laughed with him, even as tearsblurred my eyes.He stuffed himself, and then he slept. By nightfall he called his wife and usdaughters into his presence. He smelled freshly bathed, with a touch of rose oilin his hair. His beard was no longer an unruly weed patch, and his eyes gleamed,even though they seemed far away.“My dear,” he began, addressing us as one beloved person, “a great thing hasoccurred. My soul has wrestled with the possibility of madness. I teeteredbetween destruction and greatness. But by God, the matter is resolved.”None of us expected this. His distraction had turned to joy. He seemed asexultant as a bridegroom.“Zaynab, quit looking at your sisters like that. I wasn’t mad before, and I amnot mad now!”“Then what are you, sir? Explain it to us simply, so we can understand.” Beingthe eldest—and somewhat spoiled—Zaynab could speak like that, on the verge ofinsolence.My father saw that her motive was anxiety. “I want you to celebrate with me, mydear. This is a victory of the soul. I have been touched to the quick by Allah.“My father caught himself a second time. He could see from our anxious faces thathe must compose himself. Once he had, he continued in a calm voice.“I have enjoyed the fruits of a good life, and another man would have beensatisfied. You poor girls have been cursed with a father who cannot close hismind. Ordinary men think it their solemn duty to never open their minds. But Icannot speak for them. All I know is that despite the comforts and love withinthis house, I have been restless and discontented.”My father spoke without accusation in his voice, but he sensed our disquiet.“I am not putting even the slightest bit of blame on you. I should ask yourforgiveness.”He would have reached out for us, but my mother spoke up. “If you want to calmour fears, do as Zaynab asked. Explain in terms we can understand.”My father bowed his head almost meekly. “I have been leading a secret life.Inside the walls of Mecca, I have played the part of a man who must be likeother men. When I walk into the hills, Mecca vanishes like a fever dream. Behindmy back those in the clan shake their heads and pity this poor, deluded seeker.They believe in no God and trust none of the gods they do believe in. My secretis that God is not someone you can seek. He is in all things, and always hasbeen. He created this earth and then disappeared into it, like an oceandisappearing into a drop of water. I saw much in my cave, but this mystery wasthe most important.”Zaynab interrupted him. “Simpler, Papa,” she pleaded.My father sighed. “An angel came to me. He told me that I was God’s chosen one.”I will always wonder if Zaynab was ready to shriek or burst into wild laughter.We will never know, because my mother shot her a look like daggers. With all theeffort she could summon, her face growing red, Zaynab stayed silent.“Are angels real?” my mother asked quietly. We all knew, although we never spokeof it, that my father had been talking to wanderers, some of them Jews, othersChristians. To an Arab, angels were fantastic, all but unknown.“Very real,” my father said quietly. You could see that he was treading lightlyinside, like a man who may be walking on quicksand. “In the middle of the nightone came to me in all his radiance. I was wrapped in a blanket on the cold floorof the cave. I shivered when the angel called to me, and at first I didn’t knowthat my trembling was awe, not the cold. I saw a figure arrayed in lightstanding before me. His voice was commanding, like a soldier who could not bedisobeyed, but it was also so gentle that it all but broke my heart. ‘Recite!’he ordered.”My father looked around at our little group. We were hanging on every word. “Youknow, my dear, that he was asking the impossible.”It was true. My father never recites verses or sings songs. It has been a sorepoint with him since he was a boy with the Bedouin, almost a humiliation. He wasonly a listener, never a speaker, and listeners win no glory.“I told the angel I could not recite. You see, even though I was in awe, my mindkept working. I realized that this had to be a dream or a trick of the demons. Anotion came into my head that if I talked reasonably to this ghost or jinn, away of escape would show itself. The angel grew in size and brilliance. Twice asforcefully he ordered, ‘Recite!’ Before I could respond, he threw his armsaround my chest and embraced me, to prove that he was no apparition. I criedout, thinking that I would faint—his arms wound around my chest like iron bands.Three times I tried to resist, and three times he seized me in his arms.”You will well believe that my father couldn’t remain composed while telling usabout the angel. His agitation was strong, and Fatimah began to cry. My mothersent her away with a nurse before Fatimah could plead again, “Where is my papa?I want him back.” We heard her wailing die away as the nurse, enfolding Fatimahin her skirts, rushed to the far corner of the house.“Was that your victory of the soul?” asked Zaynab, who seemed determined to lether doubts speak for her.“Not yet. I was still too troubled to think,” said my father. “When the angelfinally released me from his grasp, I dashed out of the cave. My deepest wishwas to rid myself of this horrifying burden. To be God’s messenger belonged toany other man in the world but me. My heart pounded, and my only thought was tothrow myself off the mountain. I beg your forgiveness. In my distraction Ifailed to think of my family, and the fate that awaited you all if I died. Atthe summit of Mount Hira I stood on legs as weak as a kitten’s, staring down atthe rocks below. The angel hadn’t followed me out of the cave. That much was arelief. It gave me a few seconds to breathe. Then I looked at the sky, and hewas there. The angel towered over me as high as thunderclouds piled up toheaven. I turned around, and he was there behind me, and to every side. I knewat that moment that the form of the angel I saw in the cave was infinitelysmaller than his presence. It was an image suited to human sight. The realangel, who came from Allah, lives in Allah. He must be infinite if he is real.”“What do you call this one who came to you?” asked my mother soberly.“Gabriel. He told me to call him that,” my father said.Now I spoke up. “You haven’t told us if you obeyed him. Did you recite?”My father’s eyes gleamed. “That’s the miracle, my dear. A humble man whosetongue has no more eloquence than shoe leather suddenly spoke.”My father closed his eyes and held forth:Recite! In the name of your Lord,who created human life from congealed drops of blood.Recite, for your Lord is ever bountiful,he who teaches by the pen,who taught mankind what was not known before.As he spoke, my father was transformed. His face glowed; he seemed transportedto Paradise. And the verse. I can’t explain to strangers how beautifully it fellon the ear, like liquid song. Such precious words couldn’t have been his. Wheredid they come from?Zaynab broke the spell by suddenly fleeing the room. I looked at my othersister, Umm Kulthum, who had been playing absent-mindedly with her braided hair,the way an infant might pet a doll. “How beautiful,” she murmured.The moment was over. My mother ran down the corridor calling for Zaynab. Myfather came back to his usual self with a small cough and asked Umm Kulthum ifshe was all right. A servant ran in to announce that Abu Bakr was at the door.“Tell him I’m just coming,” said my father, adjusting his robe and lookingaround for his slippers. He wouldn’t greet a respected friend in his bare feet.As he was leaving the room, I grabbed his arm. “Tell me, Papa, what has reallyhappened to you?”“There is an inner man that nobody sees,” he replied. “Now he is on the outside,and the outer man, who is seen by everyone, he is gone forever.”"},{"pageContent":"11 [003-TOC.html#chapter_11]ABU BAKR, MERCHANT OF MECCAWe were only a handful at first. I can’t describe how strange we felt, being setapart from society. It wasn’t like having the plague. Just the opposite. Imaginethat you are starving, driven out of your home to wander the wasteland. In everydirection there is only emptiness, and the voice of fear whispers, “Life isnothing but this.”Then one day God spreads a banquet in the desert. Succulent viands, deeplytinted wine, the richest sweetmeats. At first you can’t believe your eyes, butsoon you have gorged yourself, and lo, a second miracle. No matter how much youeat, the feast renews itself. The table groans with God’s bounty.That was us, starving souls who were fed by Muhammad’s words.“Don’t make sheep’s eyes at me,” he would say. “I am not your shepherd. The onlyshepherd is Allah. I am just a man among men.”I had known him for thirty years, man and boy, but his humble attitude stillamazed me. Wouldn’t you want to be worshiped? Anyone who answers no is eitherlying or has given up on life. Muhammad had done neither. He knew that he didn’tcook the feast or make it appear in the desert. He was simply the host whobeckoned more guests to come and be filled.You would have been filled too, sitting at his feet when God delivered a newmessage. First there was the moment of contact, which was always the samegreeting:In the name of the Lord, who is merciful and compassionate.We’d never know what would come next. Muhammad himself never knew. God is amaster of surprise.Do you not see how he has lengthened the shadows?The One is He who made the night a garment for you.He gave you sleep so that you may rest,and the morning sky to be a resurrection.Who had ever seen the night as a garment and the morning as a resurrection? Imarveled that God could combine beauty and a promise. It was magical.I squandered my good name by standing up in the inns, before anyone was drunkyet, and reciting a sura, a passage like that. I felt compelled the way ordinarymen are compelled to argue, fight, belch, and make love. With a fresh sura inmind, having run from Muhammad’s house, I’d recite things no one could fathom:He has prepared a bonfire for those who reject the hour that is to come.They will cry out for death,and He will say, “Do not cry out this day for one death, but for many.”Idlers and sots lounging around the wine casks would stare at each other inbewilderment. Why was I ruining their drinking hour with talk of death? Or this:On the day that the sky is split open and the angels stream down in hosts,true authority will belong to the Lord of Mercy.On that day the unbelievers will tremble.Apocalypse is a bad appetizer. But the men couldn’t be deaf when it was me, AbuBakr, who uttered such warnings. I wasn’t a crazed half-wit. I had bested mostof them in trades and reaped gain from their loss. Muhammad was delighted that Imade a spectacle of myself.“When you stand on a table to speak, they see you standing on a pile of gold,”he said. “You’re halfway to God already.”Those same men would have scorned my real motive. I wasn’t about to gorge myselfalone; I had to share the sustenance from heaven. Imagine my sickness of heartwhen so many people turned away—everyone, if you want the truth. They despisedMuhammad’s message without even hearing it, like someone who turns his back on afeast because a rumor has spread that the food is poisoned.It wasn’t even a question of believing. Arabs are a murderous race, so ourenemies say. If so, we must be murdering in our sleep, because few in Meccawanted to wake up even when God shook them.They didn’t turn on Muhammad all at once. That’s the best I can say. Suspicionspread slowly, like smoke seeping through cracks in a wall. The authorities wenton guard first. The Qurayshi elders fixed Muhammad in their steely gaze likehyenas waiting to see if a wounded lion would fight or fall. He didn’t doeither. One day his gate swung open, and Muhammad walked out, strolling to themarketplace as if nothing had happened.Muhammad’s uncle, old Abu Talib, breathed a sigh of relief. His nephew wasrespectable again. “If you want the gods to protect you, be harmless,” Abu Talibsaid cynically. “If Muhammad had the slightest power, they would strip it away.At least now he can live as strangely as he wants, so long as he keeps quiet.”Abu Talib never lost the bitter taste of his own downfall.I sat at the foot of the old man’s bed and nodded. Abu Talib was right aboutpower. We have a saying: “If power can be bought, sell your mother to get some.You can always buy her back.”Abu Talib was wrong on another point, though. I was sent to tell him the badnews.“Muhammad will keep quiet in public, but not behind walls. He’s the messenger ofGod. In his mind, everything has changed. He can never go back.”Abu Talib sat up, his face turning red. “In his mind? In my mind I may be theemperor of Abyssinia. So what?” His rheumy eyes narrowed. “What about you? Whatdo you think of this madness?”“I think we should wait and see,” I said.Abu Talib threw himself back on his pillow. “We’re lost!”The old man loved his nephew. Abu Talib never forgot the promise made toAbdullah’s soul, that his son would always find shelter under his roof. AbuTalib knew it would be catastrophic to rock the boat. The Quraysh had naileddown every corner of the city. They had the rats marching in straight lines,people said in private. But Allah can turn a world upside down at His whim. Whatdoes Allah care about fat Qurayshi merchants and their padded asses?I took my leave by telling Abu Talib to get some rest.He gave another smile, more nervous than cynical this time. “Will you carry amessage to the prophet? It’s not from God, but it is important. Tell my nephewnot to visit my house unless I summon him. I want to die in my sleep.” Abu Talibmoaned softly, pulling on his wispy beard. “Poor, foolish soul. Tell him I haveturned my face to the wall. I don’t care if Allah opened his eyes. That’s hisbusiness. But if he tries to open ours, there will only be trouble.”I brought word back to Muhammad. He took the news calmly. Who was pledged tobelieve him, anyway? The nearest blood—his wife and daughters; little Zayd, whoknew no better, but was devoted to his foster father. And I, who shared no bloodwith any of them. As long as he held on, Abu Talib was still head of the Hashimclan. Yet with each passing year he continued to spend too many days in bed andlose too much money. He spoke for no one but himself now.I was surprised how closely Allah watched our movements down here. He had hisear to local gossip, because one day this message came through:The doubters will say, “How can this be God’s messenger?He walks through the marketplace like any other man.”Tell them, all my messengers have walked through the marketplace like other men.Before the angel appeared, Muhammad had the town’s goodwill. Unfortunatelygoodwill is like a rose in the desert. Unless you tend it lovingly, it withersovernight. Naturally everyone was glad to see Muhammad back on his feet andamong the living. Until he spoke, that is. A man who had cultivated tactsuddenly had the unruly tongue of a child. I once took another merchant with meto see Muhammad soon after the great change came upon him. This man was wary,and I wanted the word to go out that Al-Amin was the same trusted man he hadalways been.Zayd greeted us at the gate. He was squatting on the ground stringing together akite. The boy was used to me, but he grew shy seeing a stranger. I complimentedhim on his kite, which would fly like a bird.“Not any bird. A falcon,” said Zayd gravely. “It will pluck the eyes out ofanyone who hurts my father.”The merchant I had brought gave a small, twisted smile, and I hurried himinside. Muhammad was sitting in the back of the house. During that time, Ishould say, he might get a new message from God at any minute, day or night. Noone knew this outside the family. I only risked bringing a stranger, because Iknew the signs when Allah spoke to Muhammad. His whole being would change, likea lantern that suddenly has its cover snatched off. If I saw that happening, Icould spot a wasp or smell something burning, any pretext to rush the visitorout of the room.Muhammad beckoned us to sit. We didn’t chat, not at first. Whatever you may hearabout him from friends or enemies, Muhammad always bore himself with a quietdignity. This too had been changed by the angel. Now he wasn’t simply quiet, hecreated a silence around him that filled the room like a heavy perfume.Clumsily, I started up some small talk about business. The visitor felt on safeground now. He related a tale about a sandstorm that struck his last caravan. Itrolled over the camel train like a towering brown wave on the ocean. And whenthey were no longer blinded, his men found that two camels had wandered away.Even though his men searched for hours, they were never found,“They swear that the storm blew them into the clouds. And I believe them,” saidthe visitor with a tight laugh. “I had them tortured in a cellar for a few days,and they never broke.” He threw his hands in the air. “My loss. You must knowhow it feels.” Muhammad, like any other merchant, had suffered such misfortunes.Muhammad gave the man a look. I confess, inside I silently pleaded, Don’t talkabout God. You need allies.In a sober voice Muhammad said, “If you trusted in Allah as you should, He wouldsustain you in all things. In God there can be no loss.”The man, who was conscious of being the richest person in the room, had neverbeen spoken to in this way. To the most tolerant Quraysh, Allah was the firstgod among many. To most of them, he was just one more way to squeeze coins outof pilgrims. I could see the man’s cheeks start to burn. Before he couldrespond, Muhammad added, “God sustains us even as He sustains the birds, whichgo forth in the morning hungry and return filled in the evening.”The rich man had regained his composure and smiled tolerantly. “Pearls ofwisdom,” he murmured.Muhammad’s eyes widened innocently. “My words will mean nothing to a glutton,whose bloated belly makes him believe he will never need God.”And that was that. The rich man went pale. “Extraordinary.” With one word hesprang up and ran from the room. His hard soles clattering down the hall soundedlike a panicked kid goat scrambling to escape from a pack of wild dogs. You willnot collapse in shock to hear that he became Muhammad’s sworn enemy.We few who believed in the new prophet began to write down his messages. Eachsura came in a distinct way. If Muhammad was about to speak at God’s command,his face became shining and full of light. His voice grew higher and moreintense. I swear on my soul that one could not mistake this voice for any butthe holy Being reaching down from Paradise to this world of clay.The first time I beheld him in such a trance, my heart was touched. We are notall ignorant in Mecca. On a caravan north to Yathrib, I saw Jews and Christiansopenly walking the streets and selling in the markets. When I was a child, tosee a Jew was the same as seeing a six-legged calf. I asked someone, who told methat these were followers of a priest who had come to Arabia on the orders ofGod. I asked why. To prepare the way for a prophet. Then I asked how manybelieved. The man I was speaking with opened his arms and said, “As many as willbe received, even some Arabs.” So you see, God was not foolish enough to throwseed on fallow ground.I asked Muhammad if he heard the words he spoke when he was transported. “I hearthem, and I am as touched as you. I feel the same awe.”“Then you are a prophet who can share in the joy he brings,” I saidenthusiastically.He gave me a look. It wasn’t a chastisement. His eyes lowered, and he said, “Notthe same joy. I must carry the shame that God speaks through such a crackedvessel.”The messages grew thicker, and some days they descended like locusts in swarmingseason. There were days when you could catch a dozen with one sweep of your handin the air. God never spoke unless there was someone in the room to hear andremember. I sat as if hypnotized for precious hours. The world has never beenchanged from inside a room. I knew that well enough. But it was hard to show myface without a mask, until one day I went to the worst side of town and knockedon a door.The door was answered by Halimah, Muhammad’s old wet nurse. She had moved fromthe desert a few years earlier. A proud woman in a black shawl mended with adozen patches. She had outlived most of Muhammad’s family with such steel in herspine that she threatened to outlive the rest of us too.“Come with me,” I said.“I don’t see money in your hand. What work do you want me to do?” she replied.Suspicion of the rich was second nature to her.“The work of a crutch,” I said.Halimah was still quick. She liked riddles. “What kind of crutch does a man needwhen he has two legs? A loan? I’m not the right one for that. An hour of love toboost his self-esteem? I don’t sell my nieces.”I held up my hand. “I need your voice, because mine is too weak.” Halimah hadheard Muhammad speak and was most moved. Her face lit up almost to match his.As we walked through the streets Halimah asked no more questions. She followedme to the sacred well in the center of town. As always, women were gatheredthere filling their water jars and gossiping. They quieted when they saw me.Some stared at my velvet slippers, covered with mud from trudging throughHalimah’s filthy street, which ran like a sewer.“Talk to them,” I ordered.Halimah hung back. “What should I say?”“Repeat what Master Muhammad told us yesterday.” I knew she had it memorized.The old nurse with her missing teeth and lowly station had no reason to believeshe had a right to speak. But I’ve learned that when they repeat a prophet’swords, humble people breathe some of his fire. Halimah took all the women inwith a slow gaze, and then she recited:Allah promises a garden to all believers, men and women alike.Beneath this garden rivers flow, and therein they will abide—blessed dwellings in Gardens of Eden.But acceptance from Allah is greater than this. It is the supreme triumph.I won’t say she didn’t stumble over a word here and there. Wind whistled throughgaps in her teeth. The women at the well were stunned. They stared at each otherin amazement. Half of them wouldn’t have let Halimah sweep the dust under theirfeet. Yet no Arab wife or daughter had ever uttered such words. And so many!Halimah didn’t know how to react, but she was proud of herself. The angelcommanded Muhammad to recite, and now his followers would recite too, over andover.I ran and told Muhammad what had happened. “Is this how we will change theworld?” I asked. “One believer at a time?”Muhammad replied, “Has there ever been any other way?”"},{"pageContent":"12 [003-TOC.html#chapter_12]ZAYD, THE ADOPTED SONI see more than they know. I’m not just a boy to be sent away to fly a kite. Isneak through the shadows and peek through cracks in the door of my father’sbedroom. My new father, I mean, the one who gets tears in his eyes when I touchhis feet.I saw him sitting up in bed. His wife—my new mother—was sitting beside himholding out a tumbler. He took a sip. In a low voice she asked, “Do you see himnow?”Father nodded. “He is before my eyes.”Mother looked around. “I see nothing.”“The angel is here. He appeared just as you came in,” Father said. “He has comea few times now.”“But he’s invisible to everyone else,” said Mother, not quite asking a questionand not quite making a statement. She was like a bather testing the water tomake sure it’s not too hot or too cold.Don’t ask me what happened next. I heard little Fatimah running down the hall.She was whimpering, which meant that the next sound out of her mouth would be“Ummi, Ummi,” and Mother would come out to answer her. When Fatimah saw me inthe shadows leaning against the door, her eyes grew wide. I couldn’t be caughtthere. I said “Ssh” and promised to take her out to play. Fatimah looked at mewith a moment’s suspicion, but she likes to play better than she likes totattle.When I was in bed that night, my mind went back to what Mother was asking. “Doyou see him now?” That’s what you ask crazy people. If Father is crazy, then Iwill be alone again. That was the first thought that came to me, and I couldn’tget it out of my head. Believe me, I tried. I knew I had to be the perfectlittle boy. That way, even if they drove all the servants away and tied Fatherto the bed so he couldn’t kick and scream the way crazy beggars do in thestreet, they’d keep me.This is a house full of chatter and kitchen sounds, clanking pots and maidsscolding the nomad who brings milk because it’s not fresh. But when my fatherran down from the mountain, a strangeness descended over us—the sound ofsilence. Why is it so frightening? Because it’s like the silence before a man ishanged or beheaded. Those things happen to murderers in this city. Murderers andenemies caught on a raid if nobody sends ransom for them. I almost saw abeheading once, before Jafar caught me and dragged me home. Jafar is the cousinI like the best on most days.The thought that Father had gone crazy was driving me crazy. Then I hit onsomething. What would a perfect boy do? I ran to the cook, who was rollinglittle balls of dates with honey and almonds. When I asked to help, she lookedsurprised and said they had girls to do that kind of work. I sat myself next toher and dipped my fingers into the bowl of sticky brown dough. Cook sighed andshowed me how to roll the little balls properly, until they were as smooth asmarbles.“Just don’t eat any. Master gets them first,” she warned. I knew why too. Motherthinks that the candy will sweeten his thoughts. That’s another thing I heard. Ibegged to be allowed to carry the sweets to Father’s room. Cook looked over hershoulder.“You don’t want to go in there,” she whispered. But I whined, and when she letme trot off with the silver tray covered by a bright red cloth, I think the cookwas relieved. At least it wasn’t her.So that’s how I got inside Father’s room. He looked very tired. His beard wasall tangled, and sweat had matted his hair. I tiptoed in and put the tray by hispillow. Then I asked him very low if he wanted some water.“You can speak up. I’m not dying,” he said. “It’s not that simple.” Who knowswhat that meant. I fetched the water. He didn’t touch it, and he didn’t reachfor the date sweets. When he caught me staring at the tray, Father pushed it myway.“Go ahead. It will make them happy to think I’ve started eating again.”I ate five. You can be a perfect boy and still eat candied dates, right? I’m notsure they made my thoughts sweeter, but I was less afraid. And braver.“Do you see it now?” I asked.Father gave me a look. “How do you know about that?”I shrugged and waited. Either he would jump on me for sneaking around listeningat doors or he’d tell me what he saw. I guess he wasn’t in a jumping mood,because he sighed and said, “I can’t choose to see or not see. He comes when Godsends him.”“Sends who?” I asked, with the knowledge that my father always had a specialgift.Pause there. First, I have a riddle. What three-letter word makes a boyinvisible if you take it away and makes him visible again if you give it back? Igo around asking people this riddle, but nobody ever gets it. When they give up,I walk away.“Hey, the point of a riddle is that you tell the answer,” they all cry after me.I just smile. “If I tell you the answer, you’ll be able to make me invisible.”Nobody gets to do that to me again.The answer is ibn, which even strangers know means “son.” When you’re nobody’sson, you’re invisible. I never expected it to happen to me. I was tied to myfather, Haritha, the way he was tied to his father, as tight as a goat tetheredto the back of a wagon. But Allah had other plans and decided to make me asinvisible as Himself.One night I was sleeping under a warm blanket, and then in a moment it wassnatched away. A raiding band had invaded our town. Two rough hands bound mehand and foot. They didn’t bother with a gag but threw me over the back of asaddle.This is a dream, I thought.I heard the horse’s hooves clanging over rocks, and its iron shoes threw sparks.The rider who towered over me started to lash his mount to go faster. The tip ofhis whip caught me in the face. The pain made me wince, and I tasted blood as itrolled down my cheek. This was no dream. The lanterns of the town faded into thenight behind us. I had turned invisible.No one needs to hear the details of what happened next. Allah wanted me tosurvive, and I did. One day my new father spied me standing in a dirty shift onthe slave block in Mecca. I didn’t squeeze my eyes shut when they lifted theshift to show that I would be able to breed. Shame doesn’t exist when a boy isinvisible.You see why I interrupted my story with a riddle. Muhammad could see me. And ifmy new father could see me, then I am not surprised that he could see otherinvisible beings now.“Who has God sent?” I repeated.“An angel. Angels are His messengers,” Father said.“And Mother can’t see it?”He shook his head. “She has to ask. And if the angel is there, I tell her wherehe’s standing. She believes me. She says that I have a reputation for tellingthe truth. Why would I start lying now? Especially with a lie that will make melook crazy.”Now my father’s face wore a small, crooked smile. He was making me feel better.Once when I was walking with Jafar, he gave a coin to a beggar who was crouchedon all fours, barking like a dog.“Do you know what makes him a madman?” asked Jafar as we walked away. He wasalways dropping coins like that, and you never knew who he’d pick to drop oneon.“Because he barks like a dog?” I said.“No. He’s a madman because he doesn’t know he’s mad.”I kept that in mind, because people do all kinds of crazy things, and it’suseful to pick out the ones who have lost their minds. Father was worried thathe might be crazy, so that meant he wasn’t. I told him so, but he didn’t lookvery comforted.The worst time for him came soon after that. He kept seeing the angel—he neverknew what corner it might be hiding around—but God had nothing to say. Therewere only two messages. First, when he was afraid and lying in bed, covered withhis cloak. God saw Father hiding there, and why not? He can see through wallsand hearts and the lies men tell. The angel appeared saying:You who are wrapped in your cloak, Arise and spread the warning.Glorify the Lord’s greatness. Purify your garments, avoid all that is unclean.Do not be weak and overcome. Be steadfast in the work of your Lord.Father immediately told the message to Mother. His heart was torn. Every daymade him realize that he was chosen, but who should he warn? Who would listen tohim if he did? In her way, Mother had also received a message. Her cousin wasold Waraqah, who was blind now and confined to his house. I saw his face onlyonce, and his eyes were clouded over with a white film. Yet the old man’s headturned in my direction, even though I hadn’t said a word. In secret he became aChristian, Mother said. I don’t know that word, but she told me that Christ wasas great a prophet as Moses.“Then why does the tribe hate him?” I asked, meaning the old man, although itwas no different with Christ.As an answer, she quoted a saying: “Blind eyes see more than a blind heart.”I wasn’t with her when she ran into Waraqah when he was near the Kaaba. Hedemanded that his relatives take him there to pray, no matter what threats hungover his head. When he heard that the angel had come to Father, the old mantrembled and said, “Khadijah, the holy spirit has come to him. He will be calleda liar; they will persecute him. He must hold fast.” Mother could see howoverjoyed Waraqah was, but she was afraid for him as his voice grew louder.“Holy, holy, holy! He will be the prophet to this nation. But he’ll have tofight. If God gives me life, I will be by his side.”Mother tried to calm him. In her heart she was overjoyed and ran home to tellFather everything. Despite this omen the angel brought no more messages. Dayspassed like weeks. The silence in the house became more anxious.“If God has something to tell you, why doesn’t He do it all at once?” I asked.“He wants to be sure I’m strong enough. All at once might destroy me,” Fatherreplied.People outside don’t know what it did to him to be at God’s mercy. We’re all atGod’s mercy. I know that better than most. But for my father it was worse.I was exhausted being perfect. Nothing I or anyone else did lifted the look onFather’s face. Until one day he filled the house with a shout. We all camerunning. It was a hot morning, and he had woken in a sweat. At that moment asecond message had come from the angel. Father recited it quickly, almost out ofbreath, word for word.You, wrapped in your cloak. Stay awake through the night,leaving half or a little more for sleep.Recite the Koran, slowly and distinctly.We are going to send a great message down to you.When you pray at night, your words will be sharper.The day’s long hours are filled with activity,so by night devote yourself wholeheartedly to the Lord.He is the Lord of east and west; there is no God but Him.Mother and Father looked relieved. They told me and the girls to sit down to ameal together, like a real family. No one felt crazy that night. Father wassmiling the way he did before God arrived. It was like the sun coming out again.Only to fade in the coming weeks. The great message never came through. We allwaited. Father acted the best, even though he had the most reason to be restlessand nervous.“God has told me how to live,” he said. “My duty is to obey.”He stayed up half the night praying. My room is close to his, and if I opened mydoor I could hear him reciting in a strong voice the messages he had alreadyreceived, over and over. I didn’t understand the words, but it brought him peaceof mind. This meant we could all stop worrying. I ran out to play again. Meccais like Paradise to a boy who likes catching rats, chasing dogs, and flying akite. The months passed, and I almost forgot about the angel. They told me inhushed tones one day that Father had started to receive more messages. He hadwaited six months. He had started to visit people again, and everyone assumedthe crazy times were over. They all breathed easier.I was pretty sure that it was good for him to hear from God again. In the houseMother said it was good, but I should not talk about it. She saw the worry in myeyes.“Be happy. God is keeping His promise,” she said.I smiled, acting reassured. On the inside I remembered a saying: “A promise is acloud. Fulfillment is the rain.” I ran outside when I heard my cousins shoutingfor me. It wasn’t raining yet. But I didn’t care. When a stranger asks my name,I tell them what Father told me to say: I am Zayd ibn Muhammad.I’m not invisible anymore."},{"pageContent":"13 [003-TOC.html#chapter_13]ALI, THE FIRST CONVERTThe battle waged against the Prophet is fierce and grows worse every day. It’sbeen seven years now. To protect some of his followers, he sends them across thesea to Abyssinia, where the Christians recognize us as brothers under the sameGod. A bitter irony, this. Our own blood brothers, the Quraysh, persecute uswithout mercy. I remain patient, as the Prophet commands. I carry a dagger withme at all times and wait for the day when God will choose the real sons ofAbraham.There’s another reason I refuse to run. I lost everything worldly, so that Icould gain everything holy. I see that now, as clearly as you see your hand. Mypoverty doesn’t make me ashamed anymore. I used to cringe when thugs laughed atme in the street. My sandals were torn; I barely had a coin to pay a washerwomanto soap the dirt off my robe. When I walk to the Kaaba to pray to Allah, I smileat the wicked. Why shouldn’t I? I’ve secured my place in heaven; no man canstrip that from me.So, you sons of Ishmael, heed the Prophet’s warning:He will not enter hell who has faith equal to a mustard seed,and yet he will not enter heaven who has pride equal to a mustard seed.I wish I had your courage, to stand at the mouth of hell and not care. Youdefile the Prophet’s name and spit on the ground. That puts him in good company.I’ve seen men spitting on God in the shadow of the Kaaba. You prideful Qurayshknow no shame. You have poisoned Muhammad’s camels and spread vicious slandersabout his daughters. Your plotting has worked. Didn’t Zaynab, his oldest girl,marry a man who refuses to believe? She loves her father, but she fears herhusband more.I’ve held the hand of a small boy beaten half to death because of a rumor thatone of his cousins worships Allah. As his bloody head was being bandaged, Icomforted him with Muhammad’s promise: “Whoever has seen me, that same man hasseen the truth.”So defile me too, that’s what I say. It will get me to my reward more quickly.The faithful tell me that I have the purest blood of anyone who follows theProphet. My mother was walking past the Kaaba when suddenly she went into labor.To guard her modesty she rushed inside, and so I was born in that holy place.This means nothing to you who pretend that the Kaaba is sacred, but peddlewhores within shouting distance of its walls. My mother stayed there for threedays until she was well enough to leave. When I opened my eyes, the first face Isaw was Muhammad’s. He had come to protect my mother the moment he got word ofher plight. I was as small and red as a wrinkled crabapple, but he foresaw mydestiny. “Name him the exalted one,” he said, which is where “Ali” came from.My father is a sheikh, the same Abu Talib you mock so freely. He was bewilderedthat I was born in the Kaaba, but he took it as a powerful omen. It wasn’t agood omen at first. I nursed at misfortune’s breast. I remember being five whenthe famine struck. Drought wiped out my father’s flocks and destroyed the cropsin every direction from Mecca. My father couldn’t afford to feed me, so one dayhe sat me on the floor.“I face shame no matter what happens to you,” he said, hardly able to keep fromweeping. “The shame of losing you is better than the shame of having you starveunder my roof. Seek a better father if you can find one.”I begged to be taken in by my cousin Muhammad. I had known his house since I wasold enough to walk. No questions were asked if I grabbed a fistful of dates fromthe jar and gobbled them down in the corner. When I appeared at his door,Muhammad embraced me and kissed me on the cheek. I became a son to him at thatmoment, without a word between us. It was like freezing in winter and thensuddenly feeling the warm sun on your back.Let me tell you how the Prophet opened the door of my soul, so that he may openyours. I was eleven when the angel appeared to him. When Muhammad ran down themountain and hid himself in his room, I was frightened, and what made me mostafraid was Khadijah’s face the first time she came out of his room.She took me aside and said gravely, “You must believe. I am not saying this toanyone else. I know you’re only a boy, but you must believe anyway.”I asked her why. Khadijah hesitated. “Your cousin Muhammad is now your father. Ason’s faith begins with his father.”“My father? Abu Talib couldn’t even feed me.”Khadijah shook her head. “Abu Talib didn’t know it, but he was working the willof God. You were cut adrift to put you under divine protection. Thieves hangingout in the alleys might have stabbed you for a laugh. Instead, you were sent tobe the Prophet’s son.”She never used the word “prophet” to anyone but me, not in those first days.Muhammad confided to me—this was years later—that he had his own doubts aboutwho he was. He was cowering under the sheets when Khadijah pulled them off andsaid, “God wouldn’t punish a man as righteous as you. I hope with all my heartthat you are the prophet promised for so long.”She saw no reason to distrust the angel. So a woman was the first to believe,not me or any other man.What does a boy of eleven know, anyway? I ran through the streets with my newbrother Zayd throwing rocks at stray dogs, peering through cracks in a fencewhen the camels mated, and wondering why the sight made my body grow hot. Bynight I asked questions.“Father, what did the angel look like?”“At first I imagined that he looked like a man bathed in light. But soon he wastransparent and filled the whole sky.”“If I haven’t seen an angel, how will I know God?”“When you know your own self, you will know God.”“But you say Allah is everywhere. If I traveled the whole world, I stillwouldn’t see Him.”“The Lord has told me, ‘My earth and my heaven cannot contain me. The heart ofmy faithful servant can.’”And so I believed without question, the way one believes in the sun. Once youset eyes on the sun, how can you doubt it? To sit at Muhammad’s feet is likelistening to the fountains of Paradise. When new converts present themselves, heputs his hand on my shoulder and says, “Here is my first follower. His face ispure, because it never touched the ground bowing to an idol.”I used to blush to hear that. Behind his back, others argue that I wasn’t thefirst convert, because I worshiped no one before Allah. Therefore, what did Iconvert from? Nothing. But all of this was secret for the first three years.Muhammad spoke of his revelations only to us few. Then a message came that theentire Hashim clan should be invited to accept the one and only God. I was notyet fifteen, but Muhammad directed me to prepare a sumptuous feast. Fortyservings were prepared, enough for every man in the clan.When the invitation went out, messengers scattered all over Mecca. Muhammad wasprecise in his instructions. “Don’t give the invitation to a servant. Wait atthe gate until you get inside or the master of the house comes to you. Bow withrespect, and make sure that you use these words: ‘Muhammad has spared noexpense.’”The last part was canny. Many people had grown suspicious of Muhammad. They allknew the word “Islam,” “acceptance,” which he preached. But the Prophet’senemies reminded everyone that the same word meant “submission.” “You see? Hewants to be chief over the whole city. His God is just a front for his own nakedambition,” they sneered. However even the wariest of the Hashim wouldn’t miss agreat banquet for the world.The evening arrived; the guests pressed their way though the gate. Muhammad wasas good as his word. There was so much food and drink that eighty men could havegorged themselves. The servants were run off their feet; every girl woke up thenext morning with bruises from being pinched. I looked around, knowing thatevery reveler was a doubter. I resented stuffing them with spiced lamb and honeybread, when tomorrow they would only complain about Muhammad louder than ever.Muhammad was unruffled and reminded me of an old joke to settle my nerves. “Aconstant complainer died and was sent to hell. When he arrived, he looked aroundand frowned. ‘Is damp wood the best you can burn down here?’ he said.”When the company was sated, every man lolling back on his cushion with satisfiedgroans, Muhammad got to his feet. “Sons of Al-Muttalib, in the name of Allah Iknow of no other Arab who could have provided a feast like this. I have broughtyou the best of the hereafter as well as the best of this world. Allah hascommanded me to invite you to enter heaven.”Uneasy glances darted around the banquet room. If they hadn’t gorged themselves,someone would have grumbled to hear Muhammad invoke Allah’s name. A law had beenpassed forbidding it.Paying no attention, he raised his voice. “Who will help me in my mission? Theone who steps forward will be my brother, my successor, and the leader of thefaith after I die.”His call was so passionate that my heart began to race. I gazed around, but theHashim were looking down at the floor or whispering among themselves. Muhammadasked again for anyone to step forward, and then a third time. I couldn’t helpmyself. I jumped to my feet and said, “I will help you.”Silence.Muhammad’s eyes swept the room, catching a glimpse of every uncle and cousin.None of them moved; a few snickered.“By the will of Allah,” he said soberly, “I declare that Ali is my brother, mysuccessor, and the ruler of the faith after my death. You owe him respect, andyou must obey him.”Now the snickering turned to open laughter. One of Muhammad’s uncles, Abu Lahab,turned to my father. “See what submission means? From now on, Abu Talib must bowto his son.” There was harsher laughter at this, and I could read their angryfaces. Every uncle in the room would have to bow to his nephew Muhammad, if theyaccepted him as God’s messenger.That feast was four years ago, and as events turned out, Abu Lahab became ourfiercest enemy. He organized attacks against the believers. He once saw Muhammadpraying near the Kaaba and grew so enraged that he grabbed the entrails of asacrificed goat and threw them all over the Prophet.Do you really believe he acted out of righteousness? Abu Lahab had already cometo Muhammad in secret and asked, “If I accept your faith, what will it profitme?”“You will be blessed by Allah, as all believers are,” replied the Prophet.Abu Lahab grew impatient. The Hashim had been granted a tithe for the water ofZamzam that the pilgrims drank; everyone accepted this. He asked again whatspecial privilege would come to him if he converted. This time he was twice ashaughty.“To submit is to become humble for God’s sake. Your reward will be exaltation inHis eyes. What more could you want?” said Muhammad.Naturally, Abu Lahab wanted much more. He left in a fury and redoubled hisdenunciations. He wasn’t the only rich merchant and trader who feared the callof Islam. To a man they were terrified when their slaves began to follow theProphet, who went among the poor in secret. In dim houses filled with smoke andthe stench of utter want, he raised his hands and said, “Even as the fingers ofmy hands are equal, so are men equal. None has preference over another.” A blackslave named Bilal became an eager convert. When his master heard this, he hadBilal dragged by Qurayshi thugs out into the desert, where they beat him andstretched him out in metal armor under the merciless sun.All the while he murmured, “God is One, God is One.” When this was reported tohis master, he ordered that Bilal be crushed under the weight of heavy stones.The torture had just begun when Abu Bakr happened to pass by. He ran to themaster’s house and threw money on the table to buy Bilal. The masterhesitated—no doubt to keep teaching his slave a lesson—before he relented. AbuBakr set Bilal free and began the practice of buying other slaves who hadconverted.Panic rose among the Quraysh. After the first three years, the Prophet began topreach in public. The number of believers was still less than forty. But theelders were no fools. They knew the danger of the message and feared a war amongbrothers. A God who brings all things to those who accept Him is hard to resistfor long. Their only recourse was to run to Abu Talib, who as head of the clanextended his protection over Muhammad. Furious as the Quraysh were, they couldnot break the tribal code. Protection was absolute and had to be honored. Ifnot, there would be endless warfare and blood in the streets.Abu Talib refused to act. Time and again, his reply to the Qurayshi elders was,“Keep your silence and your dignity. Let us deal with Muhammad the way we must.Our sacred ways are not to be crushed.” Abu Talib wouldn’t break his promise totake care of his orphaned nephew as his own son.The Qurayshi elders didn’t give up. They found a strapping young man in theslave market and brought him before Abu Talib. “Take this one as your son andrenounce the other. The trade can only benefit you,” they argued. Abu Talibturned them out of his house with scorn.I’ll tell you what worries the Quraysh the most. It’s the mystery of the word.How can this Koran, a stream of words delivered to an ordinary man, be strongerthan their swords? Even surrounded by threats and ridicule, people converted,because they heard the voice of God in Muhammad’s voice.If you believe the rumors people spread, Muhammad’s followers perform demonicrituals when gathered behind closed doors. If they only knew the truth. Muhammadpreaches peace. He says, “The strongest wrestler has no strength compared to theman who can control his anger.” Sometimes one of us Muslims—so we callourselves, to denote that we have surrendered—fights back after being sorelyprovoked. When brought before the Prophet, he rebukes him gently. “The creationis like God’s family. Everything that sustains it comes from Him. Therefore, Heloves most whoever shows kindness to His family.”I would never say so in front of the Prophet, but Abu Lahab is the son of theDevil. He watches from behind the scenes like a snake waiting for its prey tocome too near. He arranged for the Prophet’s house to be vandalized by night.For a time it was necessary to post an armed guard at the gate. Until one day amessage came that told Muhammad to send the guard away. God would protect him.Perhaps this sura, one small verse, inspired the Prophet to adopt a new tactic.He said, “Our father Abraham smashed the idols of his people when they weregone. He mocked these petty gods as lumps of clay that were blind and deaf tothe prayers of the idolaters.”After that Muhammad began to ridicule the idols planted all over the Kaaba,inside and out. At dawn he went to greet the new pilgrims who came to Meccaduring the holy months, and he challenged idol worship to their faces.“If your idols, who have no eyes and ears, can protect you from my blasphemy,let them do their worst,” he declared. “They won’t avail you. In reality theyare only the servants of God themselves. Why trust in the slave when you canaccept the Master? He alone answers prayers and provides protection.”When the pilgrims saw that none of their gods could harm Muhammad, a few becameconvinced and were converted. Abu Lahab could not tolerate this, so wheneverword came that Muhammad was making his way to the Kaaba, he sent his own men toshout, “Close your ears! A madman is about to harangue you.” Their clamordrowned out the Prophet’s sermons. After that, he abandoned public preaching andheld meetings at night, underground.Nothing was lost on Abu Lahab, who now had the backing of the entire Qurayshtribe. Instead of crushing the faithful all at once, which even he did not dare,he decided to use a flyswatter. For every new convert to Islam, an old convertwould be killed or driven out of Mecca by terror. Muhammad couldn’t be touched,not with Abu Talib’s protection. But almost everyone else was in danger,especially the servants and slaves who dared to believe differently from theirmasters.One day I knocked on the door of an old hanif who had come over to our side. Thedoor swung open with a creak. Inside there was no one. I went from room to room,calling out. The old man had vanished overnight, taking his family with him. Ademonic symbol had been written in animal blood on the wall.I ran to Muhammad and cried that the campaign by his enemies was intolerable.“Let me fight back. What else can be done with men who hate you?”“Do you want to show how much you love your Creator?” he asked quietly.“With all my heart,” I exclaimed.“Then love your fellow beings first,” he said.After many months neither side could break the stalemate. One man of God withforty followers against every powerful family in the city. Muhammad had nochoice but to ask God to bring him a solution."},{"pageContent":"THREE [003-TOC.html#part_03]WARRIOR OF GOD"},{"pageContent":"14 [003-TOC.html#chapter_14]A JEWISH SCRIBEWhat strange creatures we are. If you beat a dog, he cringes. If you beat ahorse, he runs away. But if you beat a man, he sometimes starts to dream. Suchdreams may take him to places you cannot imagine. Being a Jew, I dream all thetime.In my favorite dream, I’m running after bird-catchers. I used to do that forreal, long ago. Every spring I’d lie in bed before dawn in my father’s house,listening. The bird-catchers never missed a spring. You could hear theircaptives—finches, larks, and sparrows—singing in wicker cages. Other tradershung bells on their mules, so you would know they were coming from afar. Thebird-catchers had no need.“Did they sell nightingales?” Muhammad asked me one day. It was hot, a fewmonths after he arrived in Yathrib. I was his everyday scribe, and yet there wasnothing for me to write down. Nobody was rushing to his house with a divorce forhim to judge or a missing bag of wheat that a neighbor had “found” in thestreet.“Maybe they sold nightingales,” I said. “But they dipped the birds in dye tomake them pretty, so you couldn’t really tell what they were.” A boy couldn’ttell, at least.“Desert birds are gray, but in Paradise they will be brilliant red and green,”Muhammad mused. “And their songs will have no longing in them. There is nolonging when you are close to God.”“Do birds long for God?” I asked.“All creatures long for God,” Muhammad replied.He’s a dreamer, you see, like me. But his dream holds people’s lives together.These Muslims are new to us. They trekked to this faraway city, Yathrib, acrossthe desert two hundred miles from Mecca. Sent by God, they say, as the Jews weresent out of Egypt. The newcomers call it their hijra, or “migration.” I have noopinion. Maybe their God sent them. Maybe the constant opposition and hatredwore them down.Here’s a joke about being hated. A woman gives birth, and the midwife comes outto greet the father, who is nervously pacing up and down. “Good news,” she says.“It’s a baby boy, and he’s healthy.”But the father still looks worried. “You’re sure he’s normal?” he asks.The midwife nods. “He has ten fingers and ten toes. He has a wagging littlepenis. Oh yes, and he hates the Jews.”The first Muslim I met laughed when I told him that joke. He was a servant toAbu Bakr, who fled here with Muhammad. Affairs had gone from bad to worse inMecca. Hatred simmered for twelve years after Muhammad met the angel. Abu Bakrbuilt a special structure for prayer outside his house, what they call a mosque.It was obvious no one wanted Muslims defiling the shrines where they kept theiridols. This mosque was just four walls open to the sky, where Abu Bakr kneltbefore God five times a day. That’s what Muhammad told them to do. The wallswere low, and anyone could look over to see what was happening; the sound of AbuBakr’s devotions filled the street. The elders of the tribe took this as adeliberate provocation.Muhammad’s enemies muttered that no amount of money was enough to keep him frombeing punished. Muhammad had already proven that the old idols couldn’t harm himor his followers. And yet these enemies were right about money not being enough.Abu Bakr owed his life to a sworn protector who kept the tribe at bay. Thisprotector, Ad-Dughunnah, came one morning and pleaded with Abu Bakr to go insidehis house to pray. Instead of relenting, Abu Bakr gave him a hard stare andsaid, “I release you from your oath. The protection of Allah is all I need.”The hate soon boiled over. The clans of the tribe hatched a plot to get rid ofMuhammad without starting warfare in the city. Each clan agreed to pick onestrong young man who could wield a knife. As a group, the chosen assassins wouldset upon Muhammad, each striking him with his dagger. In that way, blame wouldbe equal among all the clans in the tribe of Quraysh. Blood money would be paidto absolve the crime. The new religion would fade away like a parched rose whosewater has been stolen. As everyone knew, Muhammad was the water of Islam.A Muslim merchant was telling me the story, and I stopped him. “Weren’t they hisown people, the ones who wanted to kill him?”“He has no people who stand outside God,” the man replied.The appointed night for the assassination arrived. The band of killers stood bythe gate of Muhammad’s house, holding vigil until he came out for his morningwalk at sunrise. They failed to conceal themselves well enough, and insideMuhammad and his devoted young cousin Ali became aware of their presence and thelooming danger.Muhammad and Ali had little time to spare. Muhammad quickly devised an inspiredplan. He took a nomad’s cloak of green wool that people frequently saw him in.He wrapped Ali in it and told him to lie on his bed disguised as the Prophet.Ali was reluctant, because he would be leaving Muhammad defenseless. Eventuallyhe was persuaded to obey. Left alone, Muhammad began to recite a verse given tohim in a revelation. When he came to the words “I have enshrouded them, so theycannot see,” he understood what God wanted. Wrapping himself in a plain cloak,he departed from his house, walking past his assassins without any of themseeing him.A few streets away he met an acquaintance, who nodded and passed. But theacquaintance was privy to the plot, and he rushed to Muhammad’s house andexclaimed that he had just seen him on the street. The band of assassins sworethat no one could have gotten past them during the night. To prove it, theysneaked up to the window of Muhammad’s bedroom, where he lay asleep, wrapped inhis favorite green cloak. The deception was revealed only at dawn when Aliemerged from the house and announced that his cousin had escaped.Muhammad had made his way to Abu Bakr’s. There would be no choice but to flee.Muhammad had received a message warning him of imminent danger. God’s will wasclear. To stay meant death for all.With several packed camels, Muhammad and Abu Bakr left Mecca with a small partyin haste. They spent three days in a mountain cave outside the city. Ali wasleft behind to settle Muhammad’s business affairs. When he was absolutelyconvinced that God wanted him to go, Muhammad agreed to cross the desert to hisnew home in the north.After I heard this tale, curiosity got the better of me. One afternoon when Isaw that he was particularly relaxed and in good humor, I asked Muhammad, “Doyou always trust your messages?”“It is Allah who trusts me,” he said.“But he sent you into the wilderness. Is that a sign of love? Why didn’t he justkill your enemies?”Muhammad gave me a look. He knows more about the Jews than you can imagine, andthe look said, You’re speaking about yourself. He waited a moment as if decidingwhat he could tell me.“I had a wife who believed in me when no one else did,” he said gravely. “Sheheard every word from God and accepted it, to the point that where I ended shebegan and where she ended I began. Our faith was a second marriage. Her name wasKhadijah. One day she was coming to my room with a bowl of soup in her hands. Atthat moment, just as I heard her footsteps, God spoke to me about her. She cameinto the room and I said, ‘My dear, the Lord tells me that you are blessed. Aplace awaits you in the Garden, where there is no weariness and only quiet.’ Shedidn’t smile, but only gazed at me. We shared the same thought: this is Allah’sway of gently foretelling her death.”Sorrow came into Muhammad’s eyes. I was touched that he would confide in me, andI had the urge to embrace and comfort him. But the next moment his bodystiffened. He said, “Because God tells me the secrets of life and death does notmean that I am the master of life and death. These are great mysteries. By God’smercy I am closer to them than ordinary men. That is just as much a cause forgrief as joy.”He never confided in me again, yet I had the strongest feeling that heunderstood the Jews, because that’s how God commands us to live: close to themystery, but never solving it. Our sorrow and our joy are entwined. Later Iheard that Khadijah died soon after that message. It was three years before theMuslims fled Mecca. They call that year Muhammad’s year of grief, because hisold uncle, Abu Talib, died around the same time. He never converted to Islam,but he blessed Muhammad. They tell me he was hounded on his deathbed byrelatives who wanted Abu Talib to give orders against the new faith. He alwaysrefused.One thing I’ll grant these Muslims. They pray quietly. They purify themselvesand recite the verses taught to them by Muhammad. And they’re not lawyers.Before the Muslims arrived, my whole life was lawyers in the rabbis’ court. Isat cross-legged in court with my writing table on my lap, scribbling downendless arguments. The judges nodded on the bench, swatting flies that buzzedaround plates of sweetmeats. Plaintiffs supplied judges with sweets to keep themin good temper. The lawyers thought they were wiser than the Torah. Them andtheir niggling minds. One stingy bastard docked me an hour’s pay, because hesaid I smudged a line.“You smudge the truth, and they pay you more,” I pointed out.He bellowed and kicked me out of court. After that, it was harder to get workwith the rabbis, which is why I snatched the job offered by the Muslims. Yathribhas its share of Jews, and too many of us can write.“You will not take down the Prophet’s holy words,” they said. “We have our ownscribes for that. Your job is to follow legal proceedings, disputes, and dailyaffairs. When the Prophet renders a judgment, record every word. If he givesadvice on any subject, record every word. This is important. Do you understand?”I nodded. I wanted the job, didn’t I? A few Muslims had been trickling intoYathrib for several years, but nobody really noticed them. They made a tinysolemn group when Muhammad entered the gates at sunset. A few Jews invited themto take refuge here. In Arabia, if you worship one God, you want allies. Nowthat Muhammad is among them, his people don’t just feel safe; they feel that Godhas shown them the way. They’ve even proclaimed that Yathrib should have a newname: Medinat al-Nabi, “the city of the Prophet.” If they’re in a hurry, theyjust say Medina.“Christians also write, perhaps more than the Jews,” said Muhammad. Because itwas hot, I wasn’t writing, as I told you. When I was, he enjoyed watching me,with a look almost of wonder on his face. For a moment he wasn’t fifty-two witha gray beard, but a child again.“Christians had to write to survive,” I said.“Why is that?”“Because the Romans hated their prophet, Jesus, and they would have killed thelot,” I said. “Luckily for them, the rich Romans were lazy. Many didn’t botherto learn to read and write.”I caught myself, realizing that Muhammad might take offense. “I don’t mean you,sir. You’re not lazy. You work yourself half to death.” He smiled, which wasrather incredible. Any other rich man in Medina would have given me a swift kickfor my insolence.I went on. “The first Christians were commanded to read their scriptures. Theydidn’t leave it to priests. After a while, so many could read and write thatthey became useful as scribes. The Romans hired them in the provinces. Timepassed, and whenever a new emperor got it into his head to persecute theChristians, his governors would say, ‘You can’t. Tax collecting will fall apartwithout our filthy little Christians.’ In a few centuries the whole empirebecame Christian.” The irony pleased me.Muhammad was intrigued. “First they persecute you. Then they need you. In theend, they convert to your religion.”He repeated this to himself several times that day. Later on, I figured out why.No one in power needs the Muslims, not yet. There are not many of them, notenough to form a decent armed tribe. He’s worried about how they’ll survive. Godcommanded him to spread the good news, like Jesus, but how?The Muslims told me that in Mecca Muhammad would sit near the town well everymorning teaching his followers. If a servant came by, he could sit and listenalong with everyone else. Even a slave could sit and learn.The high-born people didn’t like this, but they wouldn’t draw near, because youdon’t talk to a respectable man with slaves hanging about. Finally one of theelders came to Muhammad, saying, “I wish to have words with you, brother. Sendthe slaves away.”Muhammad nodded as if he consented, but suddenly he couldn’t speak, and his facebroke out in a sweat. Receiving no answer, the elder stormed off. A little afterthat, a new message came to Muhammad: “Do not drive the believers away or youwill be among the evildoers.” So he had no choice. He had to save every idolworshiper in Mecca, rich or poor. The task seemed impossible. When Muhammad wentto the fat elders of his tribe, they ridiculed the notion that one of their ownwas chosen by God. When he went among the poor, they were too easy to convince.They would hope for favors and money from a wealthy merchant who suddenly paidattention to them.“Did he find an answer?” I asked one of the Muslims.The man shrugged. “Would we be here if he had?”I meet Jews who are suspicious of the newcomers. I tell them that Muhammad islike Moses leading his lost children, but they mock, “And Yathrib is theirpromised land? Where’s the milk and honey? They should keep moving.”I went to Muhammad and asked him if this was their promised land.“That’s not my concern,” he replied. “God can find his own anywhere on earth.There’s something more important.” He pointed to a pile of scrolls on the floor.“This is God’s book. It has been growing for twelve years now. Nothing is moreprecious. You are people of the Book, so you understand.”I drew back. If I said yes, I understand, would that make me a bad Jew? Is it asin for me to work for a Muslim whose book isn’t mine? I hear the whispering inmy mind, and to the people of the Torah this is what I say. If the messiah comestomorrow and drives the Gentiles into the sea, maybe he will turn to me and say,“Eli, dear boy, sit at my right hand. I will be busy rebuilding the Temple ofDavid. You take care of business while I’m away.” Then I would rule the worldand nobody’s God would be before mine.But there is no messiah, no Temple, no way around the Gentiles. I must wanderlike Joseph among the unbelievers, only I don’t weep. I adapt. And if theseMuslims have found their own Elijah or even Moses, why should I kick the cowthat gives me milk? My job is to write, not to judge. I’ve never seen Muhammadwhen he gets his messages, which keep coming, they say. New scrolls appeararound him. Some days I’m not allowed in the door. Other days I see him begin tochange. His eyes roll upward; he trembles slightly, like a sparrow you hold inyour hand. At the first sign I’m driven out of the room.One thing I do know. Muhammad hands down their laws, just like a Moses. So if aprophet says, “God told me this,” and his followers say, “We believe you,” howcan anyone disprove it? When I am safely behind my own door I can light candlesremembering the Maccabees, who died as heroes defending the Jews, and I cancurse our enemies. There’s time enough for that. Always time enough for that.Muhammad hasn’t passed fifty without gaining some canniness, and he saw thesewarring thoughts in my mind. One day he told me to put down my writing tablet.“Look in my eyes,” he said. “Do you see a fraud and a liar?”I was too startled to reply.“If you don’t see a fraud and a liar,” he said, “then I am telling the truth.God has made me His messenger.”I was embarrassed and mumbled something, I can’t remember what.Muhammad became stern. “Don’t risk your soul. God commands me to save the Jews.He wants me to save the world.”Muhammad paused, and for a moment I was afraid he wanted me to make a choice,then and there. But he looked away instead and continued.“For three years I couldn’t even tell my uncles and cousins. Do you know whatanxiety I felt? To know from God’s mouth that all sinners are damned. He seeseverything. He marks every deed we do on earth, and at the last day the damnedwill testify against themselves out of their own mouths. Can that day be faroff?”My heart was pounding. There was steel in his voice as he spoke, but not thesteel of a madman. Muhammad got his strength from something outside his body. Aforce like lightning that can turn a soul to ashes or forge it in flames.I stammered, “Don’t ask me to believe. But I can see. You survived the fire.”He looked surprised. “Do you see that? Because it’s true.”I lie awake wondering if the world will come to an end before the next sunrise.My mind still goes back to my childhood when I waited for the bird-catchers.Sometimes a bird would die suddenly. Maybe they gave it the wrong food, or maybeit had a broken heart from being separated from its mate. The bird-man wouldpluck the feathers of a dead bird and weave a fantastic cap for himself,glittering with every hue, more than a rainbow. You could hardly tell thecatcher from the catch.I hope Muhammad gets to see the birds in Paradise, as God has promised. And Ihope I’m not left out when that day comes."},{"pageContent":"15 [003-TOC.html#chapter_15]FATIMAH, MUHAMMAD’S YOUNGEST DAUGHTERThe faithful are readying for war. The night I found out, I had a nightmare. Apack of hyenas brought down a lion, and they started to gnaw at its carcasswhile it was still alive. The hyenas laughed as they pulled out the victim’sentrails; the lion roared with defiance as it died. I woke up trembling anduttered one word: Father.I must have shouted without knowing, because Ali, sleeping beside me, rolledover and mumbled. I held very still until he fell asleep again.Is this coming war a test from God?The summer caravans leaving Mecca all travel by Medina on their way to Syria.They are Qurayshi caravans, most of them, and the grandest have a thousandcamels. From a height it must look like a trail of ants creeping from horizon tohorizon. Most of our Muslims are poor. A few farm on the tiny plots of land theyare begrudged. Many others try to trade, but struggle in a foreign city where notribe is their own.Hauling a small cart of crops to market with limited prospects for the week, ahungry Muslim is passed on the road by camels loaded with silk, jewels, andspices. The temptation to raid is great.When the raids first began, they were no different from the custom of poor Arabstrimming some extra fat from the rich. The caravans were disrupted for an hourand moved on. Ali was amused. “Half the time they can’t find the caravans andcome home empty-handed. The desert needs to be smaller.”It was sport, a game. The nomads have been playing it since the time of ourancestors. If captives are taken, they can be ransomed. In the meantime,captives and captors sit around the same campfire and sing songs. One neverhears of killings, because then a blood feud would erupt, and that means troubleon both sides.Now everything has changed. It started when one of our real fighters, Abdullahibn Jahsh, went south on the trail close to Mecca, risking greater danger. Hisraiding party found a small caravan camped in a palm grove. Three timidmerchants guarded a few scrawny camels. When Abdullah’s band descended on them,the first arrow from Abdullah’s bow pierced a merchant in the heart. The shotwas intentional. Shocked, the other two fell to the ground in surrender. Theywere marched to Medina, and Ali’s amusement changed. The mob didn’t greetAbdullah as a hero, but as a violator of the peace.“Look at the rabble.” Ali pointed out the window at the grumbling people in thestreet, Jews and Arabs who had once welcomed us. They were disturbed and angry.Sport had gone too far. Rumors spread like wildfire that Abdullah had defiledthe holy month of Rajab, when no fighting is permitted. His attack was unholy,and many thought that he had the blessing of Muhammad to commit violence.Confidence in the Prophet was badly shaken.“It’s not our holy month,” Ali argued. “It belongs to the idol worshipers. Howcan we be bound by our enemy’s customs?” Ali fumed when word came that a fewpoets in the marketplace were making up songs ridiculing the Prophet.We had been married only a year. The whole time I hid my face from the raids andnever asked if Ali was part of them. Then he brought me the news. A message hadcome to Father from Allah: “It is permitted to fight.” The message was longerthan that. It spoke of those who had unjustly been persecuted for worshiping oneGod and driven from their birthplace. God was favorable to Abdullah’s raid. Alesser crime by a Muslim was forgiven when the weak were oppressed, because thatis a greater crime before God. But all I heard was the phrase that changed ourlives. It is permitted to fight. Ali’s excitement matched my fear.“Faith, purity, blessings,” he said. “They aren’t enough to defeat evil.Sometimes it takes blood.”He squeezed my hand in reassurance, but it wasn’t his words that frightened me.It was the look in his eyes. I couldn’t bear to look back. A battle. Whenever itcame, he would rush to fight on the front line. A defender of the faith could dono less. I’ve never seen a battle, but you don’t have to see one to know whodies first. I took my hand away, so he couldn’t feel my fear.“Aren’t we here to bring peace?” I asked.“If we are wiped out, there will never be peace. This isn’t an evil choice,because it’s no choice at all. The enemy has decided to come for us.”When I was a girl, a runner pounded on the gate demanding to see Father. Hisface was bloody, and he was filthy from running all the way to Mecca from thehills. A small party of the faithful had sought a remote place to worship inpeace, but the Quraysh had them followed. In the middle of their prayers theywere set upon by attackers with knives and clubs. My father blanched andlistened gravely to the runner’s account. The faithful were strong young men;they drew as much blood as they lost. It wasn’t enough for the Quraysh to forbidtrade with anyone who dared to follow the Prophet. They resorted to torture,especially if one of the faithful was a slave. An adopted son of my mother’s wasstabbed in the Kaaba itself.Ali’s eyes reminded me of all this. I prayed for God to give me words. “At leastyou won’t have to buy your shield back,” I said.His face flushed scarlet. It was cruel to bring back bad memories. I feltashamed. But how much crueler for warriors to butcher each other.Here is how Ali lost his shield. When we came to Medina last year, Father hadbegun to unite the people. He brought peace between the Jewish tribes and theArab tribes, who had been fighting for three generations. For the Jews it was aneye for an eye; for the Arabs it was blood feud. Both sides could never forgiveany harm done to their clans. But a hundred years of violence had exhaustedthem. They turned to Father, who brought his reputation for fairness with him toour new home. A peace pact was drawn up, and both sides placed their hands onone another, swearing to keep the city safe and to protect the poor.When everyone was gone Father shook his head. “Oaths aren’t enough. Pacts andtreaties aren’t enough.” There had to be other ways to bond the tribes ofMedina, because he knew that the Quraysh would come one day. He chose a partnerfor each Muslim man among the Arabs of the city, forming a brotherhood. Yet heknew the strongest bond was blood, and blood means marriage. I was innocent ofall this. A seventeen-year-old thinks of a husband, I know, but Father was ingrief over losing Mother. I sat at his feet every day, and even though he wouldmarry again, he would never love anyone as he had loved her. Between us it wasunderstood.How amazing one day when I entered his room and Abu Bakr smiled at me. He alwayssmiled to see me, but a woman knows the difference. He wasn’t smiling like anuncle. There were only a few men who lingered at our house, men trusted byFather to tell him the truth at all times. Umar, who is very wise, also began tosmile at me, and Ali, the cousin who had been part of our household as long as Ican remember.“A smile was all I had,” Ali would recall with a grimace.It was true that he was poor. When they heard that Father needed a son-in-law tostrengthen the faith, Abu Bakr and Umar offered themselves in open proposals.Father held up his hand. Everyone waited. Time went by, and still no decision.Ali could hardly stand it. I wasn’t a child anymore asking him to look for mydoll, and he had sat in council with men for eight years. Without money hecouldn’t even make a bridal gift. One day he came into Father’s presence andsighed.“What is it?” Father asked.Ali was startled. “I said nothing, sir.”“Ah, I thought you were asking for Fatimah.”Father loved Ali dearly, and he gently suggested that Ali owned one thing ofvalue, a shield chased with silver edges. He could sell that to get money forthe bridal gift. Ali took heart and obeyed. Then Father came to me and announcedthat it was God’s will for me to marry Ali. Would I consent?Something tied my tongue. Fear of leaving my beloved Father? Ignorance of whatpasses between a husband and wife? Ali had hidden his desire so completely, outof respect for Father, that he hadn’t even made sheep’s eyes at me. Before Icould find anything to say, Father smiled. “God has made you silent. I know inyour heart that you agree.” I realized he was right.We were married here in Medina a year after Hijra. The Muslims, surrounded bystrangers, were grateful for something to celebrate. My sister Ruqayah gatheredall the women to cook the feast. The carpeted floor was crowded with dates,figs, lamb, and wine jars. It was like being home again. As many tears were shedfor that reason as for joy. The whole company laughed when the richest guest,Uthman, who had married Ruqayah, rose to present a gift to the groom. With aflourish he brought forth Ali’s shield. Uthman had paid for it, but refused tokeep it. Father’s eyes twinkled. There are ways to sell things and still notlose them.It displeased my husband to be reminded by me now that he couldn’t buy hisshield back himself. I sighed. The same shield would protect him when the battlearrived. What strange paths Allah takes to work His will.“I can’t stop you,” I said. “If you are a ghazi, God be with you.”“What is a ghazi to you?” Ali asked. How could I find the words to reply withoutoffending him? Already I felt the heat from his burning cheeks.“A ghazi is someone who strives for the sake of God,” I said.“And is there a limit to striving?”I cast my eyes down. “No, dear husband.”“Well, then. Peace be upon you.”“And you.”Ali seemed satisfied. A stranger would be baffled by this conversation, I know,and all that it meant for the future. Perhaps our whole destiny depended on ashifty word. Ghazi means striver, but it’s also what we call the raiders. It wasan innocent term before Abdullah’s arrow drenched it in blood. Now no onestrives for Allah in peace. The ghazi provoke fights with the Quraysh. Theydeclare that Allah ordains them, and suddenly their raids are holy. The logic ofmen is hard to unravel from the logic of God. He must see a purpose to all thisviolence.Troubled, I ran to Father when he was alone. He sits in the dark brooding whenhe isn’t in council. Medina has made him turn gray—but fierce too. His manner isso stern that some of the faithful fear him as much as they fear Allah.“Why does God want blood?” I blurted out.“A bold question from such a timid child,” he muttered. It was the closest to arebuke I had ever heard from his lips. But I’d rather be loved for truth thanmeekness. I asked him again.“God doesn’t want blood,” he said. “He wants warriors when the unjust persecutethe just. The faithful are made strong by defending their faith. Otherwise theywill scatter like leaves when the next storm comes.”“But the ghazi provoke the enemy.”“They strike before being struck. God forgives them. He knows that the enemy hasdone violence to us for fourteen years already. He wants the balance redressed.”These were hard words to hear from Father. It was as if he were speaking in themosque. But when I gazed into his eyes, they weren’t fierce; they were pleading.He went to the window and closed the last open shutter, making it night in theroom.“Don’t try to read my mind, child. It isn’t mine anymore. God commandseverything, even my thoughts. I must obey.”I ran away to console myself. How easy for his enemies to say that Father ishiding behind God. How convenient that these raids that infuriate the Qurayshhave a divine blessing. I had to know the truth. It was shameful for a daughternot to believe her father. I do still believe him. Yet in my mind’s eye I sawAli’s corpse being dragged across the battlefield, leaving a track of blood inthe sand. I had to know.I broke into Abu Bakr’s room in distress. He was doing something he didn’t wantme to see and barely had time to hide it.“A sword?”He sheepishly brought it out from behind his back. “This old arm can barelyswing one. I practice every day.”Abu Bakr is a second father to me. He read my heart. “The Prophet isn’t here tobring messages. He is here to bring justice. Look around you. The tribes of thecity keep the peace. We have laws and safe places to worship. God protects thesons of Abraham as long as they obey him and bring his words to pass.”I felt a spark of hope. “Then He won’t allow any Muslims to be killed?”Abu Bakr gave me a wry smile. “Certainly not a man as strong and brave as Ali.”I blushed. “I wasn’t asking just for myself.”“Then hear me. If we fight for justice, it isn’t violence. It’s a righteous act.When righteousness remains passive, the unjust show no mercy. The nature of evilis to spread, like a contagion.”This was a long speech for him, but not a practiced one. I know Abu Bakr. Herisked everything in Mecca to stand beside Father. He broke blood ties andwalked among assassins with his head held high. If anyone knows what a righteousact is, he does.Abu Bakr hesitated. “I don’t think you realize. The Prophet led one of the firstraids. He became a ghazi when God commanded him.”I was shocked, and yet I wanted the truth. Abu Bakr assured me that none of theearly raids drew blood, or were meant to. Father had ridden out, because one ofthe greatest enemies of the faith owned the caravan. Like the others, this raidcame to nothing, because the scouts couldn’t locate the camel train in the vastreaches of the desert.If that made me grateful, it was only for a moment. Allah began to weave amystery around us, and like men stumbling in the dark the Muslims wandered intoa scene whose outcome was known only to Him. It began when news came that therichest caravan of the year was heading home to Mecca. Its leader, Abu Sufyan,hated the Prophet. He accused him of wanting to destroy the tribal order, but weall knew Abu Sufyan’s secret grievance. When a small group of frightened Muslimshad fled across the sea to seek refuge in Abyssinia, his own daughter was amongthem. The Quraysh sent an ambassador to convince the Negus, king of Abyssinia,to send the refugees back to Mecca. Lavish bribes were laid at his feet, andevil might have won the day. That is, if not for a leader of the refugees whoread verses of the Koran to the Negus, who as it turned out was a Christian.Hearing the word of God and knowing how dearly we Muslims held the prophetJesus, the king sent the ambassador home in scorn.Abu Sufyan never forgot his loss, for which he held Father to blame. Hispersecution was ruthless. “But now he’s coming within our grasp,” Ali said. Hepressed Father to attack the caravan. At one stroke he would have revenge on hisenemy Abu Sufyan and seize wealth for the suffering Muslims. On its long trek,the caravan had to stop at the Well of Badr for water. It was a perfect place tolie in wait.Suddenly the streets were full of noise, as if the men were preparing for afestival. I hid inside, praying that Father wouldn’t concede to this bloodyadventure. It wasn’t his decision alone. He wasn’t the military chief; he had toseek counsel from all the leading men. The air was filled with piercing calls towar. Volunteers ran to the central square. Delirious with dreams of plunder,seventy Muslims who had come from Mecca volunteered. To everyone’s astonishment,more than two hundred more from among the converts in Medina volunteered.Ali ran in with an exultant look. “Soldiers have sprouted like wheat sown withGod’s hands.” For the first time, the faithful had more than devotion on theirside. They had numbers.Foolish dreamers. They marched out of Medina like nomad boys pretending to bethe Roman army (not that any had ever seen Romans, who could be invisible godsfor all we knew). Women stood at the gates singing Bedouin war cries to maketheir men strong in battle. I lay in my darkened room with a pillow pressed tomy face, but I heard their shrieks, which were like wild animals.How foolish we are here believing we act for ourselves, when God is the onlymover. He began to play cat and mouse, not telling either side which one was thecat. Abu Sufyan had good spies, and one of them, seeing the march out of Medina,ran up the trail to warn him of the ambush at Badr. Abu Sufyan was crafty andintelligent. He immediately turned his caravan off the trail toward the sea,hoping to march around Badr and get his water by trade with the nomads whocontrol the coastal roads. At the same time he sent a runner to Mecca.This runner caused panic when he arrived. He tore is shirt and screamedhysterically. “Merchants of Mecca, heed me! Your goods are never coming back toyou. Muhammad is stealing your money and your camels. Heed me or be lost!”A girl must never show how much she knows about boys, or women about men. But weall knew that Meccans weren’t fighters, except in show. Battle was a dance wherethe negotiations for peace came before any fighting broke out. Craftinessbrought more victories than a sword. Yet this naked threat to their wealthenraged the Quraysh, and one of father’s chief tormentors, Abu Jahl, blocked anytalk of a treaty. He quickly assembled a thousand soldiers to march to Badr.“How many men can Muhammad have?” Abu Jahl argued. “Fifty? A hundred?” Suddenlyfired with courage, the Qurayshi army left Mecca with the same festive air andpassing of the wineskin as our men left Medina. God made both sides believe theywere the cat.When Father and our men arrived at the Well of Badr, no one was there. Theywaited anxiously, and eventually two water carriers appeared to fill their jugs.They were captured and bound, then led before Father after a sound beating hadloosened their tongues.“Where is the caravan you bring water to?” he demanded.The two water carriers were bewildered. “Caravan? We come ahead of the army ofAbu Jahl, which is a few days away.”At this the Muslims almost lost heart. They realized that there would be noplunder, and worse, instead of overcoming thirty or forty guards who traveledwith Sufyan’s caravan, a bloody-minded army was coming for them. For the firsttime, the wiser heads suspected that God was weaving a mystery. Or was it atrap? Abu Bakr rose and argued that God wanted a battle to settle the Qurayshithreat.“They threw us out of the tribe. They branded us as a band of traitors,” AbuBakr pointed to Father, who sat silently as his chiefs held council. “Our veryProphet they ridicule and mock. God cannot abide these evils. We must stand andfight.”Abu Bakr’s speech rallied the seventy Muslims from Mecca. To everyone’sastonishment, the new converts pledged to fight without surrender. Only a fewvoted to return home to Medina, citing as their goal plunder from a caravan, notwar.Father thanked his men and retreated into his tent. Up to that moment, God hadnever asked him to lead an army. He felt the dreadful guilt of someoneresponsible for the lives of many. At the same time, he trusted that God wouldlead his steps and guide his hand.When Abu Jahl came over the last dune to confront the oasis at Badr, he couldn’tsee the Muslim forces. They had camped out of sight, and many of the Qurayshwere relieved. They had gotten news that their goods were safe; the caravan wasout of Muhammad’s grasp. As true devotees of money, they saw no reason to fightonce their god was safe. A band turned back to Mecca, including some of theHashim and others who were anxious at the prospect of fighting their ownrelatives and friends. A new faith doesn’t turn a cousin into a stranger.God’s game went deeper than blood ties. Abu Jahl had wild ambitions. He wasalready powerful, but by saving the caravan of his rival, Abu Sufyan, he hadpulled off a coup. Soon word would be spread by every wandering poet in Arabiathat Sufyan was the protector of the Quraysh, beloved by the gods. The only movethat would surpass this was for Abu Jahl to defeat the Muslims and bring theProphet to his knees. He argued for war, and with reluctant muttering the clanchiefs agreed to stay.They drank wine in their tents to calm their nerves while a scout named Umayrclimbed the dune that looked down on the Muslim camp. Umayr returned with a paleface and wild look in his eyes. Instead of seventy or a hundred men, Muhammadhad gathered three times that many. The Meccans started muttering anxiously. AbuJahl remained stubborn, however, pointing out that the Qurayshi army was morethan twice that size, almost three times, even after the recent defections.“I’ve seen the faces of these Muslims,” Umayr replied. “They are set for death.You will not kill one of them before they have killed one of you.”Abu Jahl publicly scorned this prediction. In his heart of hearts he realizedthat the old Bedouin game of ritual fighting and bickering was over. This newenemy would fight and never negotiate. There was another thing that only he andhis chiefs understood. My father had taken the valley and surrounded the wells.Without water, the Quraysh had no choice but to fight, even though they wereforced to climb uphill facing the sun to get in place. How could the gods havedone this to them?They had one hope to avoid massive bloodshed. All Arab battles began with singlecombat. Three men from each side, chosen from the cream of the armies, came outto fight hand to hand before the main forces charged. Often this was enough toend the strife, and if not, Abu Jahl trusted that his three champions would slaythe other three and fill the enemy with fear.I know you wonder how a woman can speak of these matters, so I must tell youthat my worst fear came true. Ali was among the three chosen to fight hand tohand. He strode out into the morning sun with his sword and the very shield thathad brought his love to my bed. As soon as the call to fight sounded, he rushedforward and within seconds had stuck his blade through the body of Walid ibnUtba.I wept as he told me all that I have told you. “God held my hand, and He struckthe blow,” Ali said. The man he had slain was an avowed enemy of the faith andthe son of Utba, whose hatred was even greater.Can a single thrust decide an entire battle? Perhaps this one did, for all threeQurayshi champions were killed and only one Muslim, who sustained a wound thatproved mortal. The two armies had to engage. Abu Jahl knew that he still hadmore than two fighters for every Muslim. But a powerful transformation hadovercome my father. In the night God taught him how to be a warrior. It wasrevealed that the Muslims should form a tight band, raining arrows on theQuraysh as they stumbled down the hill, blinded and confused by the sun in theireyes. Only at the last second, when the enemy was close, should the Muslims droptheir bows and charge with drawn swords.Abu Jahl had no notion of such warfare. He had fought in desert skirmishesbefore. Even in the fiercest ones each fighter was on his own, and there were notactics, just a melee as disorganized as boys having a mud fight. His men fellback under a hail of arrows. They tried to stagger forward, and another hail ofarrows hit them. Still packed together, the Muslims charged. In panic theQuraysh dropped their arms and ran. The whole battle was over before theafternoon sun was halfway down the sky. When the enemy dead were counted, manywere leading chieftains, and one was Abu Jahl himself.Immediately the victors began to round up the wounded to slaughter them, but Godsent Father a message that none were to be killed. It was enough to march themback to Medina and hold them for ransom. He stopped the wild looting of theenemy camels and weapons, decreeing that the spoils should be shared equallyamong all the clans who had fought so courageously.“It was a day of joy,” I said quietly. At least my Ali had survived, which wasjoy enough. Until the next time.He understood why I was solemn. “Dear wife, your father was not exulting. Heknew that the Quraysh have reason for more revenge now and more attacks. No onecould mistake the tears on his cheeks for tears of joy.”The Prophet had foreseen the repercussions. Allah had tested him with anxiety,doubt, and bloodshed. Only then had He revealed who was cat and who was mouse.God, the all-powerful and all-knowing, planned every move on both sides. Healone knew what was needed for the faithful to win. Therefore, nothing less thantotal obedience to His will was acceptable. Without that, the enemy would neverrelent. This victory at Badr would be the end of the Muslims unless Fatherheeded every revelation to the letter.“Have you heard about the angels?” Ali asked. In the ecstasy of winning,soldiers had spread the word that a host of angels had appeared overhead as theyfought, indicating that Allah was on their side. When Father heard that Gabrielhimself had joined them, he nodded and smiled.“Do you believe that?” I asked Ali. I had no idea what his reply would be. Iknew what the old Ali would have said before he marched off. He would haverevealed his doubts. A new Ali returned, though, and something about him madehim seem like a stranger.“Angels are good for the troops,” he replied. “None of them ran, even when wewere outnumbered. Only God can inspire a man to fight under those conditions.Allah has revealed how we’ll survive.”My heart sank. “Through war?”Ali shook his head. “Not just war. Holy war.”He was using a peculiar word new to my ears. Jihad."},{"pageContent":"16 [003-TOC.html#chapter_16]IBN UBAYY, THE HYPOCRITEI walk through Medina, and the same thought torments me. I was born to rulehere. No more. It’s all Muhammad now. I smile, and on every side they smileback. I am given respect, just as before. No one can see how my mind grinds andgrinds.Beside me is one of the last chiefs of the Khazraj tribe I can trust. I tellhim, “The Prophet has created a paradise. Use your imagination. It’s all aroundus.”He isn’t immune to irony. “Soon the camels will be dropping manna. Be carefulnot to step in it.”How long did it take for me to lose everything? Four short years. The Muslimswere hanging on by a thread back then. I was on the rise, because the warringtribes in the city looked to me to bring peace. The Jews were ready to forge analliance with the Arabs. If I could stop the endless blood feuds, I would be thechief of chiefs. Some even whispered a daring word: Ubayy the king.“The mosque,” my companion says, warily pointing up ahead. We are going to pray,the two of us. It’s not safe to speak ill of the Prophet this close to themosque.I hear you laughing. Ibn Ubayy a Muslim? You don’t understand. Conversion isabout power. The God of Muhammad has cast down the gods of Arabia. They havecrumbled to dust.I remember the day the warriors came home from Badr, two years ago. We werewaiting along the city walls, ready to behold a broken column bringing the deadand wounded. We couldn’t believe our eyes when we saw the corpse of Abu Jahlinstead, dragged on a bloody litter behind a mule. The wind turned that day. Ifelt a shudder run through me. If their God could crush the Meccans with ahandful of soldiers, anything was possible. Six months later, my forehead wastouching the ground in the mosque.As we near the door to pray, my companion looks around nervously. We’re luckythis morning. No one assaults us or spits on our feet. A few mutter an oath.Munafiq—“hypocrite.” When I overhear them, I lower my head humbly. Isn’t thatwhat God commands the faithful to do, submit?Kneeling in the cool dim space where the Prophet’s word is law, I feel lonely. Ionce wore my people like a cloak, wrapped tightly around me. I rose step bystep, keeping careful watch. Ambition isn’t a banner you fly overhead as youmarch down the street. It’s a ladder just tall enough to steal all the fruitfrom the tree. Preferably at night. Muhammad understands this, and so do I.Hundreds of men surround me at prayer. As we murmur to Allah, a ripple runsthrough the crowd. Eyes cautiously peer to the right and left. The Prophethimself has entered. No one has to say so. His presence is enough.I’m bold and lift my head as he passes. Age has not bent him, nor care made himweary. Why should they? He’s the victor. His robe is gleaming white; he bestowsa blessing with a wave of the hand. Half a dozen bodyguards form a shield aroundhim, but through the cracks Muhammad spies me and frowns slightly. I’m not theonly hypocrite in this paradise. We form a party, in fact. Arabs who jumped tothe new religion because there was no other choice. I couldn’t change my ways tosuit the Prophet. He calls me a thorn in his side.Once when I challenged him, he became too angry to speak.“Don’t turn your face from me,” I said. “Embrace me. I’m the one you must save.”“First you must want to be saved,” he replied. “Your eyes must open to God.”“Is that why so many lying in the street have their eyes closed?” I shot back.“Or is it because they’re dead?”I went away holding back my anger, but my tongue betrayed me. I was overheardtelling one of my cousins, “This is what comes of bringing strangers among us.”So far no message from God has come to make me disappear, not the way so manyothers have disappeared. I mean the Jews. We had three tribes of Jews in Medinawhen Muhammad arrived. If they hadn’t planted the seed of one God, Muhammadwould never have come here. The Jews made a garden in the desert for him. Oneday I was their champion, the judge who would bring peace to all the tribes. Iwoke up the next day, and their doors were shut against me. Muhammad would betheir judge. Muhammad was the bringer of peace.Then the tide turned against the Jews. The people tell a tale that could betrue. One day a Muslim woman had come to market in the Jewish quarter. Sellersat their stalls called out, “Let’s see your face. What’s wrong, are you too uglyto behold?” They were used to ogling. Muslim women wear a veil.On this day a goldsmith grabbed the woman and pinned back her clothes so thather face was revealed; he threw her to the ground, and when she arose, herclothes were snatched off, leaving her naked. A Muslim man heard the commotion,ran to the scene, and killed the goldsmith with his knife. In turn, the Jewishsellers killed him. A blood feud was ignited.Muhammad laid siege to the Jewish quarter. And after fifteen days the dominanttribe, the Qaynuqa, surrendered. Having seen that seven hundred armed Jews couldbe summoned to fight against him, the Prophet felt the danger in his midst. Hebanished the Qaynuqa from Medina. How do the Jews feel now scraping for a livingin the barren countryside and distant villages?I went before him and pleaded their case. “We had fierce battles before you cameto Medina,” I declared. “In one battle the leaders of both sides wereslaughtered, and I was saved only because the Jews of the Qaynuqa defended me.They are strong. They will help defend you when the Meccan army marches on thecity.”Muhammad had just returned from Badr, and my timing was wrong. He was swollenwith the arrogance of victory. Why did he need Jewish warriors? They were thereal thorn in his side, not me. Their quarter of Medina became a ripe plum forthe Prophet to pluck. He confiscated their property and divided it among thefaithful.From that day onward, I earned the name “hypocrite.” What name should I lay atthe feet of the Prophet? In time the second tribe of Jews was banished. Those ofthe third tribe were called traitors for siding with the Arabs of Mecca. Was ittrue? They were traders. Their fortunes depended on going to Mecca, where thegreat market thrives. Perhaps the Jews only wanted for life to go on as it hadin their fathers’ and grandfathers’ time. Perhaps they were unlucky, plottedagainst the Muslims, and lost. Suddenly there were beheadings in the street.Traitors were to die. Their women and children had to be sold into slavery. Iwas appalled.No one could say whether the Prophet ordered this outrage. He simply turned hisface the other way. At the very least that is what he did, and I am here toremind him.“I am studying the Koran,” I tell him. “Does it not say that Islam confirms whatcame before?”Muhammad nods.“Does it not say that God sent down the Torah and after that the Gospels? I seehere a sura that compares Jesus to Adam, since they were the only two men whohad no earthly father.”Muhammad nods again, giving no sign of how he feels toward me.I go on, “And yet you drive out the Jews and call them enemies and traitors.Please clear up my confusion, dear master. Are they not also people of theBook?”I’m saying all this in public, you see. The circle of those who constantlysurround him are uncomfortable. For a second the Prophet’s eyes flicker in theirdirection. Is he saying, If you love me, pluck out this thorn?But aloud he is calm and tolerant. “God is all-mighty. He sees all and knowsall. He sees those who oppose Him, and they will pay the price. To oppose thefaith must mean that someone’s heart is set against God, even if their lips payservice to the Book.”His close circle murmurs at the wisdom of his reply. I consider myself lucky tohave gotten off with a veiled threat.Whatever anyone thinks of me, I am never asleep. The day I foresaw came. A yearafter Badr, the Quraysh mounted a new army and were marching on us. The enemyforces were larger this time and better armed. The gleam of their swordsattracted birds from miles around. The enemy were thirsty for revenge. Theyhadn’t forgotten Abu Jahl and all their relatives who were killed alongside him.Muhammad called a council, and since all the chiefs attended, he couldn’texclude me.The Prophet had the first word. “We shouldn’t march out to meet the Quraysh. Itis best that we defend the city from within its walls.” Knowing how outnumberedwe were, I sided with him. This plan displeased the young, restless Muslims.They didn’t want to sit at home like women. Their voices cried out for war,which meant marching onto the field. They believed that Allah had given usvictory before, and He would protect us now.Muhammad waited for others to support him, and the older chiefs did. But theclamor for battle was too loud. Two days later, a force of seven hundred leftthe city. I rode beside the Prophet, and both of us could see in our mind’s eyethe three thousand Quraysh we were about to meet.The walls of Medina were still in sight behind us when Muhammad turned to mewith a scowl. “Who are those?” he said, pointing to a small band of my soldiers.When I told him they were Jews, some of my truest allies, Muhammad exclaimed,“Back! All of you. We fight without you today.”I was stunned, but my mind didn’t quit working. If the Prophet’s army won, Iwould be excluded from God’s miracle. If it fell, I would be branded as thereason.“I want to be with you,” I said. Not so much because it was the truth as that Ineeded another sign of his real motives.Muhammad’s voice softened. “No blame will fall to you. My wishes have beendisobeyed already.”Suddenly I read his mind. He wanted my forces to defend the city from within. Wewere the last resort he had to carry out his plan. I raised my hand andwhistled. My lieutenants looked confused, but when I pointed to the city gates,they passed the order along, and we retreated back into Medina.My men were seen leaving, but not all left. I heard from one of my spies thatthe two armies had come within sight of each other the first night. Muhammadseized the best ground by making camp on the face of a high hill known as Uhud.The steep rock face at his back protected the troops from being surrounded.Muhammad was in a strong position unless one of his flanks gave way. In thatcase, the men were both exposed and trapped.Gazing down from the hillside, Muhammad saw that his soldiers were outnumberedthree to one. This didn’t alarm him, as he knew the power of faith. In any otherwar the Muslims would lose; in holy war they would prevail.The Quraysh were led by Sufyan, the wealthy merchant whose caravan was in perilbefore the battle at Badr. He was the wealthiest among the Quraysh, and hismoney bought them a huge cavalry. They outnumbered Muhammad’s cavalry in armoredcamels fifty to one. Muhammad now heard the songs of women. The Quraysh broughttheir families with them. They could not be routed without incurring shame. Withthis news, my spy had nothing more to report. Dawn would tell the tale.A new spy came running at noon the next day, flush with excitement. “Allah hasinspired the Prophet! Nothing can stop him!” Once he calmed down, I questionedhim, and the news was stunning. Muhammad, knowing that he had to stop thecavalry from surrounding him, took fifty archers and posted them on a separatelow hill. He commanded them to rain arrows down on the Quraysh. On no accountwere they to rush into battle, not to help their kin or to seize plunder if theenemy was losing.The Meccan army charged first. Holding their ground on the side of Mount Uhud,the Muslims hurled stones while the archers on their flank shot volleys ofarrows. The Quraysh fell back in confusion. In the onrush, their standard fell,and the standard bearer was killed. His brother rushed forward to raise the flagagain. Out of the Muslim army Ali stepped forward. Everyone froze. This was thehero of Badr. Ali challenged the new standard bearer to a duel and killed himwith the first blow.Another brother of the standard bearer came out to retrieve the flag, and he toowas killed in hand-to-hand combat, followed by his son. Their corpses made apiteous sight. The dueling had devastated Qurayshi morale. Sufyan couldn’t rousethem. The war songs of their women and the steely tinkling of bells were but avain attempt to spur them on.“And you saw the victory?” I asked my spy.“No, sir. I ran to tell you, as victory is certain. Allah has inspired theProphet.”I sent him away. Enough of that. My men, the ones defending the city walls, werein place, tense and waiting. No women sang for them. Everyone was overcome withdread. I could have told them the good news. Instead, I took myself home toponder fate. The first time Muhammad marched to Medina in triumph, he seized mypower. This time, once he accused me of fleeing the battlefield, he’d take mylife.Exhausted, I fell into a troubled sleep. Pounding on the door woke me, and Iheard one of my spies shouting for joy. Is this it? Have all the gods abandonedme? I secretly thought. But I flung open the door and exclaimed, “Praise Allah!”Only to see the man’s blanched face and the tracks of tears in the dirt on hischeeks.“Lost!” he cried, sinking to his knees.I didn’t wait for details. If Muhammad had been beaten, that meant threethousand Quraysh mad for vengeance would be laying siege to Medina. I ran to theramparts to reinforce my men with boys and even women, who could throw stonesand pour boiling water on any enemies who tried to climb the city walls.It’s strange when you are about to die and don’t know who to pray to. My menwere simple. They prayed to Allah with fervent hearts. A handful looked to thesky instead of bowing to earth. I imagined they were praying to the gods oftheir fathers. As for me, I wouldn’t pray until the moment a Qurayshi sword wasabout to plunge into my chest. I should have had a clear idea at that momentwhich god wanted me for his own.And yet the attack never came. Before nightfall a rider appeared on the horizon.I gave permission for the gates to swing open. Once before me, he related a taleI could hardly believe. The battle of Uhud was won. The Muslims killed theenemy’s courage, and to save their fallen the Quraysh left camp. Seeing that thespoils of war were in their grasp, the archers couldn’t resist. DisobeyingMuhammad’s orders, they left their post to loot the enemy tents and steal thecamels.A chief on the enemy side, Khalid, the son of Walid, was in charge of theircavalry. He immediately spotted the opening and ordered his troops to charge atthe Muslims’ exposed flank. Suddenly the crushing weight of their numbers camedown on the Muslims. They were surrounded, and their only escape was to retreatuphill on the side of Uhud. In the confusion, the Prophet was set upon andnearly killed before his men could pull him to safety, seriously wounded.It was the end. All the Quraysh had to do was to pursue the Muslims. Butinexplicably, they didn’t push forward. The Quraysh allowed Muhammad and hisarmy to escape.Amazed, I asked, “Where are they now?”“Coming home,” the rider replied, still gasping from distress and fatigue. “Seethe dust?” He pointed to the horizon, where a line of dirty brown smudged theair.“Are they running with the Quraysh behind them?”He shook his head. “The enemy remains in camp. No one pursues us.”How could this be? Perhaps Allah really was on the Prophet’s side and hadclouded the minds of the enemy. Perhaps Sufyan thought too much like a merchantinstead of a general. He didn’t want Medina turned into an enemy fortress thatwould never trade with him again. For whatever reason, the cloud of dust swelleduntil it reached high overhead. Shrouded inside was the Muslim army, bearingtheir wounded Prophet home.Should I move to seize my power back? I wanted to, but my hand was stayed. Toomany have converted to Islam. They won’t follow an infidel anymore. And there’sanother thing. Muhammad’s God did keep the city from being attacked. It justtook a rout to make it happen.I begged audience with the wounded Prophet to see for myself if he was reallyalive or on the verge of death. It took two days before I was allowed to enterhis room, and by that time he was sitting up in bandages, weak but ready to getstrong again.“What happened?” I asked, keeping my forehead to the floor in case he sawsomething in my eyes I didn’t want seen.“They disobeyed God,” he said grimly. “They stopped fighting for Him.”“Did God tell you that?”“He didn’t have to. Anyone who isn’t fighting for God defeats himself.”I felt Muhammad reach down and lift my face from the floor. “Including you,” hesaid. “I would lose any battle to win a great soul.”I can’t help now but hear those words over and over. With half my heart I praiseAllah sincerely. I’m not the deep-dyed hypocrite they suppose. With the otherhalf of my heart I fear Allah. Perhaps He is all-knowing and all-powerful. Or isHe simply crafty beyond imagining?"},{"pageContent":"17 [003-TOC.html#chapter_17]UMAR, THE CLOSE COMPANIONIt never ended. Skirmishes, feints, raids, and attacks. The struggle was wearingus down. One day the word came that our implacable foe in Mecca, Abu Sufyan, hadtaken the profits of a whole caravan to buy weapons and mercenaries. Everythingwas closing in. The next day we heard that the hill stronghold of Taif wouldresist Islam to the last man. Syria refused peace terms, inflamed by lies aboutthe Prophet. The Bedouin chiefs on the coast drifted from our side to theMeccans like waves on the beach.And yet he goes on. A recent revelation comes to his lips: “Allah taxes not onesoul beyond its limits.”I am sahabi, one of the companions who has been by the Prophet’s side since thebeginning. No one has kept a closer eye on him. Closeness doesn’t reveal hissecrets, though. One waits for clues, like watching a lion who seems to sleepand then gives one small twitch before he leaps. A few months ago there was alull in the raids and killings and betrayals. I found the Prophet kneeling inhis garden. At first I hung back, so that I wouldn’t interrupt his prayers. Helooked up and beckoned me.“Watch,” he said, pointing at the ground.A small anthill lay in front of him. Carefully the Prophet put a balled-up pieceof bread next to it. At first only one or two ants came out to scout. Theytouched the bread with their feelers, then scurried back inside. In a minutedozens of ants trickled out to pick at the dropped food. I must admit I foundnothing unusual to see. The Prophet was brandishing a twig, which he used togently push the ants away. Every time he did this, more ants rushed out of theground to fill in the gap.“This is our situation,” he murmured. “No matter how many enemies we drive away,more are sent after them.” He cocked his head quizzically at me. “What would youhave me do? The faithful can’t face attack forever.”“Do you want me to show you?” I asked in return. He nodded. With my sandal Ikicked the anthill, sending it flying. I stamped on the flattened ground, andthe hole disappeared. The ants around the bread ball scattered in confusion.“If God wants us to fight our enemies, then He wants us to crush them. Mount amassive attack,” I said. “Every Muslim in creation will rush to fight. Donothing, and the Quraysh will gather more allies, like flies to rotting meat.”On the wind we had heard of powerful tribes that were being bought off by Meccawith promises of plunder. The banished Jewish tribes were constantly tradingwith the enemy and nursing their dark grievances.The Prophet picked up an ant on his fingertip and examined it. “Tomorrow morewill come out of the ground. You can’t kill them all.”“I can kill enough. I can kill until Allah tells me to stop.”I had worked myself half into a rage, but the Prophet gazed at the destroyedanthill in sorrow. “God has something better in mind,” he murmured.“Better than total victory?”The Prophet turned away and went back into the house. That’s what I mean aboutgetting a clue to his mind. When you glimpse one, it is veiled. In the shortrun, events turned out the way I foresaw, but it was Mecca that mounted themassive attack, not us. It was in the spring two years after Uhud. This time theQuraysh were preparing for a long siege against Medina. Word came of tenthousand infantry led by a cavalry of six hundred horses. Our army was a thirdthat size. Brave Muslims went to bed only to wake up wide-eyed, because theyheard the clang of iron horseshoes in their nightmares.My nightmare was just as horrifying, but more real. When we were routed at Uhud,it took every fiber of strength to remove the wounded Prophet safely from thefield. Trailing behind the retreat, I glanced over my shoulder. With shrill warcries the camp followers from Mecca had rushed onto the bloody ground, maimingand mutilating the fallen. They were human vultures, and the leader wasn’t asavage, but Hind, the wife of Sufyan himself. I wonder if she spied me, becauseher face was like a demon’s. I saw her raise a small curved blade, and when shebrought it down, a wounded Muslim had lost his nose and ears. Sickened, I turnedand galloped away. Later I heard that some women returned to Mecca wearingnecklaces of body parts sliced from the dead and dying.Rumblings spread through the city after that defeat. It took all of theProphet’s skill to calm the bickering chieftains. One bitter faction wanted topunish the reckless young warriors who had ignored the Prophet’s plan to defendMedina. There was even more disgust over the archers who had abandoned theirpost to loot the enemy camp. But the Prophet said quietly, “All that is goodcomes from Allah. All that is ill is my fault.” His humility swayed thechieftains, even as blood was shed among clans in Medina’s back streets atnight.We gathered in council to argue about how to meet the massive army marchingtoward us. Spies had ridden ahead to warn us that we had only a week to prepare.The worst confusion is that born of panic. The Prophet sat silently, while thechieftains tore apart each other’s plans. One side shouted that Badr had beenwon by hitting the enemy full on and trusting in Allah. A quieter, more cautiousfaction pointed out that staying home to defend Medina from the inside wouldhave avoided the humiliating defeat at Uhud.The Prophet turned to the quiet faction. “You do not call upon God to bring usvictory?”“I would thank God if He brought us survival,” one of the chiefs muttered.The Prophet grew stern. “Where is your faith?” But he knew well enough thatthere was near famine already in the city. Reciters roamed the streets cryingout verses from the Koran to raise morale. People listened, but continued totremble.I stood up among the assembly. “The Prophet has taught us that faith has threeparts. One part lies in the heart, another in our words, and the last in ourdeeds. Every action is holy. Therefore, this must be a holy battle, not a battleof fear. We should rejoice in being tested.”Maybe I raised a few sunken hearts with this kind of boldness. But we all knewthat there was a fourth part of faith, and it belonged only to the Prophet, theone man who could hear directly from God. We waited in nervous, rustlingsilence. He rose to his feet.“Our enemies fight against God, and therefore they are defeated in advance. Notknowing this, they assemble a great, futile army. But ten thousand blind mencannot defeat a handful who can see. Let me ask you, then, what do you see? Ifyou tell me that you see a foe who hopelessly outnumbers us, then are you not asblind as they?”A mixture of bafflement and discontent greeted these words. A voice cried out,“Tell us what you see.”The Prophet shrugged. “I took a walk out of town yesterday. I saw hills androcks and trees the same as you. But this time God showed them to me with neweyes, and I rejoiced.” He smiled beatifically. “Is it not wonderful how Godbrings us victory in His very creation?”The assembly was more baffled than ever by his words. A few of the sahabi whoknew him well realized he was about to unveil a teaching.“Allah is all-merciful. He asks nothing of our souls except what he has alreadyplanted in them,” Muhammad raised his voice to silence the muttering doubters.“I will give you a plan, but never forget my words. God is all-merciful. This isworth more than victory, more than life itself.”Muhammad explained how the rocks, hills, and trees that he loved to walk amongsurrounded the city on three sides. An army couldn’t march through them withoutbeing picked off; horses couldn’t gallop through without losing their footing.Medina had only one open side, to the north. If we could stop the enemy’s horsesthere, they would lose most of their advantage. The tide would swing to us,because the Qurayshi infantry knew that in hand-to-hand combat a Muslimprotected by his faith was worth three mercenaries fighting for loot.“Their warhorses have seen bloodshed. They won’t run from the glint of steel orthe clash of swords,” said the Prophet. “So we must give them something they’venever seen before. Only the unknown can frighten a warhorse.”By this time the assembly was hanging on to his every word. I don’t know if Godenjoys creating suspense; if the Prophet does, it’s a small sin. “What we needis simplicity itself. It is written that long ago the Persians terrified theenemy by digging a deep trench in the front lines. If the walls are steepenough, no horse will plunge into such a trench. They will pull up short at thelast moment in panic. We will defend ourselves against the siege by fightingfrom behind our trenches.”This strategy was delivered so skillfully that no one had time to consider thevast labor it would take to dig a single ditch deeper than a horse is tall, evenwhen only on the north side of the city. The enemy army would be upon us inseven days, which meant that we had a mere six days to prepare ourfortifications.I tell you, those six days were the noblest of my life. Medina worked with oneback, digging night and day. Every child was given a shovel to work beside hisfather. Women hauled away dirt in baskets and took turns bringing food andwater. The Prophet himself was seen digging, his white robes dirtied, his facecaked with dust. All the better to goad our men to dig until their arms burnedand trembled with exhaustion.As I was breaking my back, my heart repeated encouraging words given by God inHis book:Lo, I swear by the afterglow of sunset,And by the night and all that it enshrouds,And by the moon when she is at the full,You will journey to higher and higher worlds.Wasn’t I doing that now? To mortal eyes I was no more than a sweaty soldiersqueezed into a ditch beside a thousand other soldiers. Yet in my soul I wasworking toward a higher world. Nothing stronger can drive a man onward. When Ifell into bed at night, I dreamed of Paradise. No more did the horrifying sightof women mutilating fallen bodies trouble me.The Prophet surveyed the work, sending in fresh replacements when a section ofthe trench fell behind. The fierceness of the task seemed to please him.Legends were already circulating about him, and I remembered one. The Prophethas a large band of horses that he loves. Being a child of the desert, he grewup with Bedouins, who took their favorite mares inside the tent with them atnight, for fear that raiders would steal them while they slept.One day the Prophet had run his horses far out into the sands without water. Inthe distance an oasis came in sight. The animals were desperately thirsty; theybolted toward the oasis as soon as they smelled it. The Prophet watched them runaway. At the last moment before they reached water, he rose in his stirrups andgave a sharp whistle, signaling for them to come back.Most of the horses ignored the whistle, but five mares turned and returned tohis hand. These alone he selected for breeding. He said, “A horse can be whippedinto running faster. With discipline it can be made to fight in battle. But whatGod values is complete loyalty, and that appears only when a soul meets thesorest test.”You see? We were loyal mares in a moment of desperation, which is why thefiercer the danger, the happier he grew.Finally the horizon was filled with black specks that advanced under a thinbrown layer of dust. The specks grew into human shapes, and in less than a daythe ranks of foot soldiers, cavalry, and fighters on camels filled our vision.The siege began. We had made life harder for the invaders by harvesting thecrops early and stripping the land of forage. The Prophet emptied the city ofmen and boys over fifteen, stationing them on the hill above the trench. No onewas allowed to go home at night; all were ordered to pray in loud voices and tospread out their campfires in long lines to make the Quraysh believe that therewere more of us than there were.At the first charge the enemy was dumbfounded. Their horses were afraid toplunge into the trench, and when a few hotheads forced them to try and leapacross, they fell short and tumbled to the bottom, writhing and whinnying inpanic. After that, there was no second charge. For two weeks neither side moved.Ali killed one of their leaders in a duel. Otherwise, the casualties were one ortwo a day. Seeing this, the Prophet should have been encouraged, but he sat forhours in gloomy reflection.I went to cheer him up, and myself. The whole future rested on his mood. “Howcan I be happy?” he said. “God has granted us everything, but He can’t changehuman nature, not in a week, and among sinners perhaps not ever.”He suspected betrayals, and the longer the siege lasted, the more tempting itwas for the hypocrites and unbelievers to turn against us. The nights grewcolder; rain grayed the skies. I was sent underground, and a day later Ireturned with ominous news.“They’ve found enough traitors to attack us from within. I crawled to withintwenty yards of the tents where the bargaining is going on. Already the peopleknow. Rumors are flying everywhere that our women and children will be kidnappedat night while the men are on the barricades.”The Prophet listened as I unfolded my grim report. The key traitors were theBanu Qurayza, the last Jewish tribe in Medina to hold a peace pact with theMuslims. The others had all been banished.The Prophet’s eyes looked troubled. “What is the enemy saying to make the Jewsbetray us?” He raised his hand. “Don’t tell me. The slightest word would beenough.”He knew that the banished Jews had joined the enemy. A few of them came to theQurayza and laid out the certainty that a vast army couldn’t be resistedforever. One enemy emissary, a powerful chief from Khaybar, where many Jews hadfled to repair their fortunes, threw open the tent flap of the Qurayza chief.“What do you see?” the emissary asked. “Nothing but our forces, mile after mile.Yet it will take the whim of just one man, Muhammad, to wipe you out, if his Godorders him to. Doesn’t he already preach that Jews and Christians should abandontheir faith and be converted?”The emissary chose the right poison. The Qurayza wavered. What side did theywant to be on when Medina fell? Up to that point, the pact with the Prophet hadbeen honored on both sides. In return for remaining neutral, the remaining Jewsin Medina had sent baskets and tools for digging the trenches.By then the siege had become a battle of nerves. Every day the two sides stoodclose enough to hurl insults at each other, but far enough apart that arrowscouldn’t reach them. Food shortages hurt both camps. The rain and cold erodedmorale. In the tensest hour we got news that the Qurayza had torn up the treatywith us. They would open up the city’s southern flank, which they controlled,and once that happened, the trench on the north would be useless. Worse thanuseless, since the men stationed there all day and night had grown exhausted.I sat in council with the trusted couriers who brought this news to the Prophet.Quietly he gave two orders. “Tell no one that the Qurayza have turned, or therewill be panic in the streets. Bring several hundred soldiers and their horsesinto the center of town, to defend the women and children from attack.”The situation was dire. Muhammad turned to the Ghatafan, a nomadic tribe who hadrecently ignited the wrath of the Muslims, first by joining the Quraysh andlending them a major contingent of fighters and arms, but also by theirrelentless greed. God told the Prophet that he must break the alliance of hisenemies. Looking to the weakest link, he landed upon the Ghatafan, because theycould be bought off. The Prophet offered them a third of the date harvest ifthey abandoned the war.This was an excessive offer as far as Ali and the other fighters were concerned,but then the Ghatafan spat in our faces, demanding not a third but half theyear’s crop as their bribe. At that moment God spoke in a mystifying way. Hetold the Prophet to agree. This decision was greeted with stunned silence.I was made deputy and ordered to take the agreement to the Ghatafan chiefs. Itwas a degrading mission, and my heart was heavy. Before I left, I went to theProphet’s tent to make sure that this was his will. He nodded silently. As I wasleaving, though, he said in a mild voice, “Out of respect, show the agreement tothe Muslim chiefs.” It seemed like no more than a casual reminder.I went to the stronghold in the center of town where the Muslim chiefs hadgathered for safety. When I presented them with the parchment on which theagreement was inked, they flew into a rage and tore it up. The Prophet wasshamed in many eyes, and defeat, it seemed, had gotten one day closer with theGhatafan still against us.When everyone had disbanded in great discouragement, the Prophet kept me behind.“Remember the anthill you stamped out in a rage?” he asked. “Do you still thinkyou can kill them all?”I hung my head.“I am not shaming you, dear friend,” he murmured. “But do you also recall that Iheld a single ant on my fingertip?”I nodded. “Did that mean something?”The Prophet smiled. “Not then. But God has now brought me the key to victory,and it’s a single ant.”As I stared in amazement, he explained. During the previous night, Nuaym, anelder of the Ghatafan tribe, had sneaked across enemy lines. He demanded to seethe Prophet, but was turned away with insults. Nuaym persevered until eventuallyhe came into the Prophet’s holy presence. The two met in secret, and when Nuaymdeparted, the Prophet was wreathed in smiles.“God tests me with an army of ants, but then He sends me the only one whomatters.”Unknown to anyone, it turns out, Nuaym had become a Muslim convert. He couldcirculate freely among all the enemy factions and was trusted by them. He nowbegan to sow discord as the Prophet secretly instructed him.To the Qurayza, Nuaym said, “Before you switch sides to the Quraysh, considerthis. If they lose this battle, they will march home and abandon you. Ask forsome hostages among their chiefs in exchange for your cooperation. If you’vepicked the right side, all is well. If you haven’t, you can ransom the hostagesto Muhammad for your own safe release.”The Qurayza thanked him for his counsel and sent word to the Quraysh that theyneeded hostages before agreeing to anything. Nuaym was there when the demandarrived. To the Meccans he whispered, “Why do they want hostages from theirprotectors? It can only be to trade them to Muhammad the minute they are turnedover.”Both sides believed him, and the next time they met, it was with narrowed eyesand suspicious minds. The Quraysh refused to give hostages. The Qurayza refusedto fight against the Muslims, falling back on neutrality as their best hope. Godsaw other, more hidden weaknesses among the enemy. Wherever Nuaym went, he foundit easy to open old wounds and festering distrust. Never had one ant wreaked somuch havoc.The wind blew strong that night. Standing on the city walls, I could see theenemy’s campfires winking out. Hosts of soldiers would sleep fitfully on thecold ground without a fire. If God isn’t doing this to them, who do they thinkis? But I never expected to witness the sight that greeted us at dawn—an emptyfield where thousands had been camped the day before. It was as if the angelGabriel had descended and swept the ground clean. The foe left behind theirwounded horses and camels, whose pitiful groans were carried to us on the samewind that had blown the enemy back to Mecca.I fell at the Prophet’s feet. “It’s a miracle!” I exclaimed.But he shook his head. “Only a few, like Abu Sufyan, deeply hate us. The restcame for plunder. The weakest reed flattens before the wind.”Actually, the ones who truly needed a miracle were the Qurayza, who had noprotection now against the wrath of the Muslim hordes that descended on them,crying traitor. The Jews retreated to their stronghold and held out bravely.After almost a month, when starvation threatened their existence, they heldcouncil. Three outcomes would end the siege. They could convert to Islam andrenounce all ties to their Jewish God. As a second choice, they could murdertheir wives and children, giving themselves no reason to live, and launch asuicide attack on the Muslims. Finally, they could pretend to observe theSabbath and turn the day into a surprise attack. None of these alternatives wasacceptable, though, which left total surrender as the only possibility. TheQurayza straggled out to meet their fate.The crowd was hungry for blood. What was the Prophet to do with the traitors? Hechose a course no one expected. “Let there be a judge who has nothing to gain byhis judgment.” The man he chose was Sa’d ibn Mua’dh, who was no more than awell-respected trader. But when the name was announced, the mob gasped and drewback as he was dragged into the public square on a litter wrapped in bloodysheets. Sa’d had fought at the trench and received a wound from which he wasslowly dying. On all sides it was agreed that such a man had no stake in anyjudgment. The Jewish captives took heart, because Sa’d was their former ally.Law and custom bound him to them, even if they had done ill to anyone else.The Prophet withdrew, declaring that the judge’s rendering would be final. TheQurayza pleaded for leniency, offering all their worldly goods and their womenand children as slaves if their lives could be spared. Other allies kneeledbefore Sa’d and joined in the cries for mercy. For all the anxiety and panicthey had caused, the Qurayza had never formally joined the enemy.Sa’d listened as his bandages oozed. He was gray and weak. In a croaking voicehe spoke his decision, and I ran to deliver it to the Prophet.“Death to all the men. Slavery for the women and children.” It was the harshestpossible sentence. The Prophet made no comment except to order that theexecutioners should come from every tribe in Medina. This would assure that nosingle one would take the blame and all would share the guilt. Over four hundredJews were bound and lost their heads. The Prophet received no revelation aboutsparing them or killing them, either way. He became stoic and grim. After thetension of the siege, he seemed to retreat into himself even more, and what timehe spent in company was almost always with his wives, especially Aisha, theyoungest, who had risen in his favor.Months later I took her aside. “What does he really think of the judgment?” Iasked.Aisha said nothing, but she must have run to the Prophet. The next day, when hesaw me hanging back during prayers, he said, “Walk with me.”I obeyed, keeping quiet. I have the stomach for any battle, but the blood of theQurayza was another thing.“Do you have a question?” the Prophet asked after we had reached a cool stand oftrees in the woods.I hesitated. “Do I have a right to question?”“A good answer. Allah is to be feared. He is also to be loved. From one momentto the next, I cannot be sure which He wants. Do you understand?”“I’m not sure.” I wasn’t sliding under the question. The Prophet was talkingabout doubt, and yet he taught that doubt would destroy us faster than anyenemy.He said, “God does not hand down the truth all at once. He hands it down the waya wildflower scatters its seed, sending it in all directions. Life brings athousand situations, and there must be a truth for each one.” The Prophetglanced sideways at me. “Can you begin to understand?”“I think so. For every moment there is a revelation. What is true one time isn’talways true the next.”“Yes. But if peace is true today and war tomorrow, how are the faithful to live?The choice cannot be left up to each of us. We are weak and blind. We arecorrupted by sin. What should we do?”I thought of the tale I had heard. “We can run when God whistles.”The Prophet gave the first smile I had seen in a month. “You may abhor hisjudgment, but Sa’d gave me hope.”“By killing God’s enemies?”“No. To one who loves this life, any death is a reason to mourn. Sa’d could havesided with his tribe. That was the easy way and the way every Arab has knownforever. He didn’t. He sided with his soul, for he told me afterward that hecouldn’t face his Creator if he allowed those who hate Allah to go free.“Do you see the spark of hope? When a man can decide life or death not becausehe wants revenge, but because he has thoughts of God, human nature is changing.I thought that was impossible, or that it might take twenty generations. By thegrace of Allah, we are seeing it in our lifetime.”I listened. I understood. I accepted. In my heart, however, I thought only onehuman had really changed—him. The Prophet has become his revelations. He seesbeyond life and death, and his mind cares only to be part of God’s mind. As forthe rest of us, we will stamp out anthills for a long time to come."},{"pageContent":"18 [003-TOC.html#chapter_18]YASMIN, THE WOMAN AT THE WELLOnly once since I was born have I been soaked to the skin. Black clouds movedtoward Medina from the hills. Usually they disappoint. I see wisps of rain thatstop in midair and never reach the earth. On that day, though, the day thepromise was made, thunder cracked overhead like a blacksmith’s hammer. It rainedso hard that rivers ran down the street.I would have hidden in a doorway until the storm passed, but something arose inme that I couldn’t fight. I ran out into the downpour, stomping in the muddywater until it splashed up to my waist and stained my shift brown. The otherwomen at the well looked at me as if I was crazy.I was inspired, not crazy. You’ll understand, if not now, then soon.When the downpour ended, I dragged myself back to my little room. It has nowindows, so I had to open the door to let in light. I stood in the doorwaypulling off my dress, which was so heavy with water that I could hardly lift itover my head. A modest woman would never stand there naked, open to men’s eyes.Modesty is a luxury I couldn’t afford.When you live on the streets you get devoured one way or another. I would bedead except for the shelter of that suffocating little room. It was added to theback of my brother’s house.When my brother came to the well and took me by the hand, I was amazed. You see,he had been content to let me starve. And then suddenly and without a word heled me to his house.“You can’t come in. My wife won’t have a woman like you inside. Your place is inthe back.”I gave him a baffled look, and he said, “Don’t ask me why. It’s a gift fromAllah.”I’m grateful. I don’t ask why Allah couldn’t have added a window. But withcertain men, as they grope and grab, darkness is a blessing. One day a differentsort came to the back.This man was young and nervous. From his accent I could tell he was a Bedouin,just in from the country. I told him to sit on the bed; I knelt and began toremove his sandals.“Don’t,” he mumbled.Just then the last ray of sunlight peeked through a crack in the door, and I sawa tiny red glow, as if a spark had dropped from the sky and landed on his head.A second later the glow was gone.When the young man didn’t move, I took his hand and placed it on my breast. Hesnatched it away. I asked him what the matter was. He hesitated, saying nothing,and I held my breath. He was nice-looking. His beard curled at the corners,which gave him a whimsical look, like a poet. I don’t lie down with many poets.I felt under the mattress for the dagger I keep there. Nice looks are noguarantee that he hadn’t come to rob me. Then his hand wandered back to mybreast. He moaned softly, and I relaxed.Nature would have taken its sweaty course, but I hadn’t pulled the door tightenough. There was a small crack to let in the sound of the call to eveningprayer. The moment he heard it, the young man jumped to his feet with a startledcry. A Muslim, like my brother. He unrolled a small rug that he was carrying onhis back and knelt to the floor.Not that I could really see him in the dark. I heard him saying the words, in asoft mumble. “Praise be to Allah, the Lord of creation, the compassionate, themerciful.”“So God is more important to you than love?” I asked, watching him from the bed.“God is more important than life,” he said. I wondered if my mocking tone wouldmake him hit me. Yet quite the opposite happened. He sat beside me and began toweep. I didn’t know what to do. Something about his tears touched me.“Lie down,” I said soothingly. “We don’t have to do anything, but if you want, Ican teach you about love.”I felt his neck stiffen under my fingers. “Love? You’re just a common—” Hecaught himself and stopped.“Perhaps not so common. You haven’t given me a chance.” I hadn’t eaten that day.It would be a shame to lose the few coins he’d pay.The young man roughly pushed my hand away. He got up and went for the door.Instead of leaving, though, he stood there a moment, pulling at his ear. Hethrust something tiny and sharp into my palm.“Keep this. I will return one day for it, and then I will teach you about love.”In a second he was gone. I opened my hand. How amazing. In the candlelight I sawa small perfect ruby. It was shaped like a teardrop and set into an earring. Sothat was the red spark that had shone in the dark. I could hardly sleep thatnight thinking about the curly-haired young man.The next day I caught a glimpse of him. I wore the earring brazenly to the well.Its shine would attract the eyes of more men. But as it turned out, nobody hadtime for me. Soldiers were milling about the square. They were infantry mixed intight with horses and camels. So tight that when I caught a glimpse of my youngman, I couldn’t press my way to reach him. He turned his head away before oureyes met. I cried out, but the din was too great. Then some busybody got theother women to shout “Slut!” because they thought I was there to grab a holywarrior, a mujahid, for myself.With a clatter of arms and followed by loud cries, the mujahidin marched off,and the square grew quiet. I stood apart, in the corner under a half-dead palmtree reserved for my kind. My finger went to my ear and I touched the ruby mysoldier had given me. My soldier? He hadn’t even touched me except over myshift. And yet I couldn’t get him out of my head. His memory didn’t comfort me.Every day got more lonely instead. I lay in the dark kissing the ruby as if hewas there, and the last words I heard were, “When I return, I will teach youabout love.”My passion grew like a coal fanned by the wind. I couldn’t tell anyone. I madeup my mind to ready myself before the army came home. They had marched far awayto Syria. It would be days or weeks. God’s reach is far, and he rewards any manwho fights for him. My soldier would drop gold at my feet and then he wouldmarry me. I know a whore’s logic is worth less than the ridicule it takes toscorn it. In secret, I followed the reciters around the streets. They have takenup the Koran as their stock-in-trade. People listen hypnotized. They say thatthe best reciters make strong men weep and convert infidels on the spot.As for me, I didn’t weep for God. Not at first. I wept for my soldier; a strongtrembling came over me when I thought of him. Even so, the calls to prayer nolonger irritated me. They felt comforting, like a faraway voice calling to me. Iknew what I had to do.The day it poured down rain was the day I knew something must change. The rainwas a sign and the joy I felt a path toward something yet to be uncovered. AfterI dried off, I reached under my bed for the small bag of silver coins I hadsaved up over many years. I bought myself a modest dress and veil. I locked mydoor against the men. The only course left was begging. I went to the well andlooked the other women in the eye.“I want to repent. Help me save my soul. Whatever dirty chore you want done,give it to me. It doesn’t matter how menial or filthy.”They stared, those who would stoop to look at me. But one old woman heardsomething in my voice. She took pity and led me to her house. We scrubbed thefloor on our knees together. Her stiff joints wouldn’t let her do the workalone. After that, when she was certain that God wouldn’t strike her dead forbringing impurity to her home, she asked me back. She had cousins, and after awhile I cleaned latrines and picked nits out of children’s hair. I became knownfor my willingness to do things only a slave would do. It helped when I entereda house and recognized one of the men. They were eager to hire me if I kept mymouth shut.The old lady was named Halimah, and God must have sent her. Not only did shehire me, but she had been the wet nurse to Muhammad. Old age had brought her outof the desert, and she followed the Prophet to Medina.“He saw his first angels when he was with me. Two of them, who reached into hisheart, and he wasn’t seven yet,” she said.After that, I became eager for more. I had glimpsed Muhammad in the streets.Everyone did. As he passed by, he was like a shadow. I never knew he talked toangels. His old nurse wasn’t ready to reveal anything, not just yet.“I still smell what you were, and it’s too early to see what you might become,”she said leaving me to my scrubbing.Then one day Halimah offered to walk me back to my room. We said nothing on theway, until a rich man’s house came into view. To one side stood a gazebo wherethe family took the cool evening air. Halimah stopped and gazed at it. Agraceful white dome was held up by pillars carved from twisted wood to imitatevines.“I’ve never had time to rest, and no one has ever invited me inside such alovely place,” the old lady said quietly.“Are you jealous?” I asked.“You mean, do I feel the way you do? No.” She cocked her head in my direction.“The dome of heaven is held up by five pillars. I own them. Here.” She touchedher heart, but instead of explaining she rushed on. We parted at my corner. Isuppose my little room also smelled too much of who I was.News of the Syrian campaign reached Medina. The Muslim force had been savagelyattacked without warning. Someone had warned the emperor’s deputy in Damascus,and the Byzantines were ready. There was a bloody skirmish. Many were lost. Iheard all this in scraps as the wind carried the words from the well, where thewomen looked anxious and afraid. I was afraid too. It wasn’t just his presencethat I longed for. There was something else, and I didn’t understand how to findit. I told Halimah that I was growing desperate. Then she surprised me.“I already knew that. I felt your desperation before you did.”“How?”I looked up. She was standing over me, straightening out her creaky knees.“The wage of sin is desperation,” she said. There was no sermon that followed.Instead she taught me to pray, my face to the floor, facing toward Mecca becauseGod’s house was there. She gave me the same prayer I had heard my soldiermumble. “Praise be to Allah, the Lord of creation, the compassionate, themerciful.” I was glad for that.Halimah warned me that I must pray at exactly the appointed hours of the daywhen the muezzin called, and then one last time before I went to bed. I nodded,wrung the last drops of water from my scrubbing rag, and started to leave.Halimah shook her head. “You haven’t asked why we pray.”I blushed. I couldn’t tell her that I was praying for a soldier whose name Ididn’t even know.“We pray out of gratitude to God. He has given us everything. Remember that,child.” She caught a look in my eyes. “You don’t believe me. Because you thinkGod hasn’t given you much.”I didn’t dare speak or even nod. If she sent me away, I’d have no more work orbread.“Let me tell you what you are,” she said.My heart sank. “I thought that you, of all people, wouldn’t tell me.” I heard myvoice shake.Halimah took my hand. “Listen to me, my dear. You are not what you seem. You areGod’s child. Fate has taken you far away from Him to show you what it is like tobe lost. But it’s the will of God to bring you back, all the more to rejoice.”Something inside me cracked. I trembled like a virgin stripped naked before astranger. Halimah and I wept together, and that was the start. I learned what Imust do to deserve God’s grace. I prayed, a reminder in thought and word thatGod is here. The world pulls us away; the voice of sin is never silent. But ifwe remember God throughout the day, our souls approach his glory.I followed Halimah around and watched her. She wrapped up pieces of bread andthrust small coins into each one. These she gave to the street beggars. That’show I learned to remember the poor, as the Koran tells us. It was autumn, andwhen Ramadan came, Halimah sat in her room for most of the day. I brought her atray of food, but she barely touched it or the jug of water I put by her bed.She didn’t have to tell me that she was fasting, or that the Koran told her to,but I had to know why.“For a month we remember who we are,” she said. “We are not this body that isnourished by food and water. We are made for God, and so it is right to repentof the flesh, and to abstain from the flesh’s craving.”She smiled like a child. “Of course, there are cravings I gave up long ago. Wewon’t speak of that.”Her simplicity moved me. Halimah trusted me. I was welcome in her house withoutsuspicion or scorn. Nothing was locked away from me. So it was an easy step toaccept her trust in God.As for my soldier, he never returned. The mujahidin marched home. The calamityof the Byzantine attack was written on their faces. They dragged the corpses ofthe fallen behind them, wrapped in white winding sheets. I couldn’t look. If mysoldier was one of them, it would be unbearable. Halimah noticed, of course, butshe didn’t say anything when she found me weeping in a corner.One day when I came to scrub the floors, she surprised me with a table spreadout for a guest.“Why didn’t you tell me I shouldn’t come?” I asked.“Why should I? You are the guest.”I had never seen lamb and apricots in her larder before, and the fresh oil shedripped over the soft warm bread smelled like an orchard in spring.“What’s this for?” I asked. I couldn’t imagine where she found the money, andsuddenly a pang of worry struck me. Perhaps this was her leave-taking. Was theold woman ready to die?Instead of answering me, Halimah said, “Which is better, to dream of a feast orto eat it?”“To eat it,” I replied mechanically.Halimah passed me a platter of shredded lamb steamed in spiced rice. “It’s timeyou realized that.”It took me time to understand her teaching. For that moment, I was just glad tobe her guest. In the past hunger had been my constant companion during the monthof Ramadan, which had just ended. Muslims led such quiet lives then that therewere almost no calls for me. Halimah stopped eating long before I was full, butshe was content to watch me. When I took my sleeve and wiped the last bit oflamb grease from my mouth, she smiled.“Now the feast begins.”Halimah looked amused at my puzzlement. “When the body has had enough, the mindstill craves its own feast. So far, you have been satisfied with wishes. Youdream of being as full here”—she touched her heart—“as you are here.” She movedher hand to her stomach. “But as you said, it’s better to eat a feast than todream of one. Are you ready?”“I don’t know.” Her words made me a little frightened.She went on. “You are standing at the door for the first time. What lies aheadis dim. But the angel who came to the Prophet speaks to you. He speaks on thewind and among the stars. Who knows what the wind says? The space between thestars is silent. That is why we have the Koran. The angel’s message lives in theBook. Anyone can understand it.“The world has unfolded according to God’s will. There have been many prophetsand messengers. But men soon forget, and then God sends those who warn ofdanger. Men still turn their backs, and finally God sends the pure word oftruth. When that happens, there is no excuse. This is the golden hour.”She had memorized scraps of the Koran, and with a glowing face she murmured onenow. “Call on Him with fear and longing in your heart, for the mercy of God isnear to those who do good.”A silence fell between us. “Fear?” I said. “Why must I call on God in fear?”“Because your young soldier may be dead. I’m sure you have other fears. Who elsewill ease them for you?”Halimah had never mentioned him before, and I had no idea how she knew. I pulledmy veil over my face to spare her the stricken look that came over me. “Can Godbring back the dead?” I whispered.“If He wills it, yes. But that isn’t the point.” Halimah’s voice grew sharper,as if she was pulling me back to myself. “To be born is to suffer, and to sin.The Arabs take no notice of mercy. Life is harder here than anywhere else. Thereis no better place to forget God than the desert. What is the point ofsuffering, but to endure?“Then one day God put Gabriel, his most trusted angel, in a small boat. Heplaced the Koran in his hands, and the little boat set sail. It arrived at theshores of Arabia, and you know what the angel said? ‘This hard land has madehard hearts. I will find one man who will heed God’s word. I will stand by himevery day, giving him drops of truth the way a mother gives a squalling babedrops of milk. In time, these hard hearts will melt.’”I will never forget that day, nor the teaching that came with it. Halimah taughtme that the angel is near, and wherever he goes, a feast is spread.I became devout and stopped longing for my soldier. After a while others noticedthe change. I was given a place at the well, and eventually some asked me myname.“Yasmin,” I said.I smile now as the black clouds roll in from the hills. The wisps of rain thathang from their bellies tell my story before I let mercy into my heart.Even so, I do run with the other women to the gates whenever the mujahidinreturn. They go farther and farther these days. The world is ready to fall toits knees. It’s time. And I confess it—I search the face of each soldier.Last month I lay in bed and the door opened. Hearing the hinges creak, I shut myeyes tight. Fate is a guest who can never be turned away.A man’s face brushed my cheek before his hands touched me. I imagined I feltcurls in his beard.“I’ve come back for the ruby,” he whispered. “Didn’t I promise?”My heart beat so fast I thought I would die. “You promised to teach me aboutlove. But I already know.”“There is always more to learn.”I felt his hand plucking the ruby earring from my ear. He held it up, andalthough it was midnight, the stone began to glow like a spark from heaven. Witha sudden plunge he brought the ruby down hard on my chest, and I felt it sinkbeneath the flesh. It sank as far as my heart. Amazingly, I could still see it.The red glow spread until every chamber of my heart was filled and grew still.The hinges creaked again, and he was gone. Did I dream it? No one could evermake me believe that. I carry the jewel of redemption in my heart, and withevery fiber of my being I know that my soldier had returned for me."},{"pageContent":"19 [003-TOC.html#chapter_19]ABU SUFYAN, THE ENEMYI call it canny politics. The superstitious call it magic. If you want, you cancall it the hand of God. But before he suddenly died last year, Muhammadachieved total victory. He could no more be stopped by force than you can stop asandstorm by holding up your fist.Mecca had no choice but to surrender. I will tell you that part in a moment.Many said the Prophet was inviolate from harm. I half believed it myself. Mywhole body trembled when I was brought before him, like a captive ready forsentencing. Muhammad wasn’t the picture of a conqueror. He was subdued. His eyesbarely saw me. Where were they fixed—on another world, another revelation?Quietly he said, “I am home again. I bear no ill will. If you wish to join us,the past is the past.”“Wish” was a nice word, a gentle word. He could afford to be gentle with athousand swords holding the streets of Mecca.More than anything he had wanted Mecca. To an orphan boy it was still the centerof the world. Without it, Muhammad’s conquests would have been like a necklacewithout the priceless pearl. After ten years of strife, though, how could heconquer Mecca when the Quraysh had sworn blood revenge? He would do it God’sway, the only way we couldn’t fight against.It took him three years and began with a dream. Muhammad saw himself with hishead shaved, the way pilgrims look after they perform the Hajj in Mecca. When hetold about his dream, his advisers were shocked. The Hajj belonged to the oldreligion before Islam. Everyone knows that. How could their new God share thesame rites as the old gods? For once Muhammad’s followers resisted him. Theyoung jihadis who had grown strong in battle were stubborn. Muhammad could notconvince them to bend, but finally he let the people in the streets know abouthis vision.A clamor arose to return to Mecca. The desire had been sleeping in the exiles’breasts all along. See what I mean about canny politics? A peaceful pilgrimagewould bring the exiles home and at the same time reassure us in Mecca that ourholy sites wouldn’t go bankrupt. They were our lifeblood. After all, each turnaround the Kaaba by the pilgrims was like an ox drawing water from a well. Weneeded it to survive.And so the Muslims came, wrapped in the white linen skirt and shawl of thedevout, dragging hundreds of sacrificial animals and keeping their weapons outof sight. I paid for a band of cavalry led by our best fighter, Khalid, tointercept them. Unfortunately, they completely lost Muhammad’s train, which hadpurposely veered off onto a different, rockier route.Sitting in council, half the Qurayshi elders wanted to concede. “Let them enterand worship. The Kaaba will still be ours. Doesn’t that signal that we havewon?”I stood up trying not to ridicule such feeble logic. “If you let them intoMecca, you are saying that Muhammad is your equal, each one of you. In place ofthe tribe, which has held us together from the time of Abraham, an upstart willunite the Arabs according to his revelations. Trust me, the first revelationwill be to destroy the idols.”Enough elders were persuaded by me that Muhammad had to stop outside the city.When forcibly stopped, he reached out to negotiate. No matter how differentIslam is from the faith of our fathers, one thing is agreed upon. The sacredprecincts of Mecca cannot be a place for violence. Pilgrims cannot fight holywars. Holy grace depends upon it.When his emissaries sued for peace, I didn’t relent easily. I forced the chiefsto demand that the Muslims go away for one year before attempting to worship inthe city. In return, we would halt hostilities against them for ten years. Iknow the concession was too great. I was admitting military defeat. But thesoldiers of Mecca—every citizen, in fact—believed that the Muslims fought withspecial magic to protect them. When that kind of belief takes hold, the enemyhas won before the first blow has been struck.After signing the treaty where he was camped, on the plain of Hudaybiyah,Muhammad’s camp buzzed with resentment. They had marched four days to visit theHoly House and make sacrifice. Why should they turn back when they were in sightof the city walls?Umar, one of the angriest, stood up and challenged Muhammad to his face. “Areyou not the prophet of God? Isn’t our cause right and the Quraysh’s wrong?Haven’t you promised us that we would make seven circles around the Kaaba?”Meekly Muhammad nodded yes to each question, but when Umar got to the last, hereplied, “I promised you worship at the Kaaba, but did I say it would be thisyear?”A tricky answer, but Umar sat down, and there was no rebellion. Still, Muhammadneeded a revelation. And one came. God told him that certain victory (Al-Fath)had been won. Therefore, Muhammad ordered that the sacrificial animals besacrificed outside the city walls. He strode outside and made the firstsacrifice of a prize camel. Some of his followers grumbled, but when he appearedbefore them to have his head shaved, as a sign that the holy rites had beensuccessful, they complied. Their shorn hair was carried by the wind to the gatesof Mecca. It slipped under and littered the holy sites themselves. The Prophetknew what he was about.As I feared, the treaty was thin. A few night raids on one side, a few murderson the other. Arabs suckle on strife, and they are never weaned. What the desertmakes us suffer, we make our enemies suffer. But I had lost the will to fightback. I became a negotiator hoping to extract a few bits of privilege, a littlemore breathing room before the final blow came.We had turned the Muslims away the first time they came to worship, but thesecond time, a year later, couldn’t be finessed. I sent word that Muhammad andhis followers could enter Mecca, but only after all the Quraysh had abandonedthe city. We would sit up in the hills for three days and wait out their visit.This was offered as a gesture of peace, to ensure that the pilgrims wouldn’t runinto violence. Muhammad knew that it was a mark of disdain as well.Muhammad entered the gates of an abandoned city and drew within sight of theKaaba. Walking up to it, he silently touched the Black Stone with his staff andgave thanks to Allah. The company of worshipers was deeply moved, thinking howmany years it had been since he could do that. When Muhammad approached thedoor, however, it was locked. My doing, I’ll admit it. I was damned if he woulddefile the inner sanctum. His followers grew enraged. I imagine they would havetorn the city apart. Looking down from the hilltop, I half expected to see Meccaengulfed in smoke. Remaining calm, Muhammad ordered Bilal, a former slave, toclimb to the roof of the Holy House and call the faithful to their noon prayers.When Mecca heard a Muslim singing out over the rooftops, the followers weresatisfied.My disdain was pointless, anyway. The new faith spread like a fever into everyhousehold. You couldn’t see it, yet it overcame you even as you breathed. My owndaughter, Ramlah, was lost to me. I renounced her when she ran off with a Muslimon the Hijra. One day soon after that I found my wife weeping.“What is it?” I asked.“There is no more Ramlah. She is now Umm Abibah.”I shook my head. “Her husband died. He was a dolt and a traitor. And now she hasa right to be a wife again.”“You think so? Well you have your wish. She is now the wife of Muhammad.”All the blood drained from my face, and I staggered to a chair. For the rest ofthe day and all that night I remained there, as if paralyzed. Nursing mygrievances, my mind drifted back in time when I could walk past Muhammad in thestreet and not bestow a glance. But I’m a realist. The thin treaty turnedworthless. I was sent to Medina in the hopes of fooling Muhammad into signing itagain. No one was fooled. All the power was on his side now.Maybe I was lonely in Medina. Something caused me to make a mistake. I went tomy daughter, in the rooms she kept near Muhammad. What good did I think wouldcome of it? She was nervous and stiff, barely bending to the floor to greet me.I saw a chair and began to sit down.“Oh no!” she said timidly, snatching off the blanket that covered it.I kept my temper. “You would deny respect to your father? It’s only a woolblanket, not embroidered silk from Cathay.”“But the Prophet sits on it,” she stammered. I stared at her, then turned on myheels and left without a word.It has been told that it took three years before Muhammad swallowed Mecca. Inthe end, the city fell without resistance. Before the Muslims marched in, theysent a declaration ahead of them. Any citizen who stayed in his house behindlocked doors would be spared. So that’s what we did. I cowered by lamplight asthe horses of the Muslims clanged their iron hoofs on the cobblestones. I didn’ttrust these warriors for God completely. I ordered that the lamps be kept low,so that the invaders would think my house was empty. All I could see in thedarkness was the glint of fear in my wife’s eyes. I never asked what she saw inmine.There was no avoiding my fate. I had to face him.“I will convert,” I said, offering no conditions. I licked my lips, preparing tokiss his sandals, but Muhammad stopped me with a small gesture.“You only need to swear two things. The first is that there is no god but God.”I repeated the words. If you have lived as long as I have, your allegiance isgreasy. It shifts easily from one god to the next.“And the second thing?” I asked.“There is no God but God, and Muhammad is His prophet.”The words fell simply from his lips. He didn’t puff himself up like an emperor.I knew that his struggles had humbled him. He had an infant son, Ibrahim, bornin Medina. Muhammad doted on the babe, but one day he caught a fever and died.Then he sent a band of his best warriors to Syria, but they were ambushed bymercenaries from Byzantium. His foster son, Zayd, was killed, and with him acousin, Jafar. Both were precious to Muhammad. An ordinary man wouldn’t love hisGod quite so dearly after that. Or trust him.One of the companions standing behind Muhammad cleared his throat. “There is noGod but God, and Muhammad is His prophet.”I suppose he was coaxing me. If I didn’t repeat the words, who knows what wouldcome next? For all his mercy, I had fought Muhammad bitterly in one campaignafter the next.Holding my feelings in, I rose to my feet. “Give me time to think.”I strode out of his tent without looking back. For all I knew, a dagger couldhave plunged into my skull.Few here in Mecca remember old Muttalib, the Prophet’s grandfather. If they do,it’s because he used to dote on his grandson, bouncing him on his knee while wedrank and argued at the inns around the Kaaba. But I remember something else.I returned to Muhammad’s tent the next day.“You’ve made up your mind,” he said. “I won’t ask. You wouldn’t be here if youweren’t ready to submit.” He saw how I faintly cringed. “You aren’t submittingto me.”I had wasted enough time. I knelt before Muhammad and proclaimed, “There is noGod but God, and Muhammad is His prophet.”Muhammad gave a faint nod, satisfied, and I rose to my feet.I could have walked out, but instead I asked, “When is God’s love so intensethat it feels like hate?”“My grandfather, Muttalib, used to ask that question,” said Muhammad soberly.“I know. I heard him. I was almost a man when you sat on his knee. But nomatter. Your grandfather planted a seed. That’s undeniable. He worried about hissoul while the rest of us were only worrying about money and women. You have thesame strangeness about you. No wonder.”Muhammad nodded. “And I still ask the same question. You aren’t my brother, notyet. Allah means nothing to you. I imagine you’re the one who tried to humiliateme at the Kaaba.”“Perhaps.”He died two years later, at the age of sixty-two. There was no great crisis,just a steady withering. He lost his strength the way a great tree loses sap.His last moments, they say, were spent with his head resting in the lap of hisfavorite wife, Aisha. The end was gentle; the faithful were certain that theProphet would be waiting for them in Paradise, where the trees are greener thanany in Arabia, the virgins more beautiful, the crystal rivers sparkling underthe sun.Even in death, Arabia is his. Syria and Egypt will fall soon. The emperor ofPersia trembles when the Prophet’s emissaries appear before his throne. Muhammadwas told by God to send letters to all the rulers of the earth, informing themthat they must heed the Lord’s word and convert. Without hesitation he sent theletters. Imagine.The Prophet died in Medina, and it was deemed best to bury him there, in thecourtyard of the house where he had lived. I watched the funeral without rancor.Beside me was Abu Bakr. Tribe and trade once united us, before we became swornenemies. Now he is calmly accepting of my conversion. We are tied by faith, andAbu Bakr makes that a cause for smiles. In the confusion after Muhammad’s death,several companions had a claim to his leadership. Ali had been chosen years ago,but he was a boy then. Umar and Uthman led strong factions. I imagine theirheads swam at the prospect of ruling the world that Allah had handed them. Butin the end it was Abu Bakr whom the chiefs chose. They call him caliph,successor to the Prophet’s authority in heaven and on earth. A good choice. AbuBakr is loved by everyone. One of his most lovable qualities is his age. The oldman won’t sit on the throne for long. The young rivals still have hope.I move among them freely, a prize convert and a harmless dog with its teethpulled. My end is near. My wife is sick, soon to leave me. She is half blindalready. She can’t see me when I sit by the lamp and read the Koran. What wouldshe do if she could see that? My eyes fall on words that God must have sentespecially to old men:Every soul will meet death.You will find your true reward only on the Day of Resurrection.This world is nothing but illusory pleasure.I have known illusion and pleasure, and both to the fullest. Is that my realbond with the Prophet?When I laid my wife in the earth, Aisha came to see me. She married so young, asa mere child, that she still looks beautiful. She entered my house lookingstately, and for a moment her eyes and the pearls she wore around her neck madethe dim room shuttered against the sun seem bright.“You will meet her again in Paradise,” Aisha murmured, taking my hand. Ittrembled slightly in hers. I couldn’t tell if it was from grief or age. Both, nodoubt.“My wife didn’t convert,” I said. “Doesn’t that mean she is lost?”“Love will draw her to you. That will be her way to God.”It was a comforting lie, and I was glad to hear it. Aisha sat with me for awhile. The sunlight that seeped through the shutters glanced off her necklace,turning it into glistening tears.“I want you to believe something,” she said. She saw me stiffen. “I didn’t cometo preach. This is a story, the one I hold closest to my heart. On a cool nightin Mecca the Prophet was walking to his house when he suddenly was overcome withsleep. He lay down in a doorway near the Kaaba. The next thing he knew, theangel Gabriel appeared and sent his light into the Prophet’s chest. Theintensity of the feeling sharpened every sense, and the Prophet realized thathis heart was being purified for something wondrous. Gabriel pointed to the endof the street where a winged beast stood. It was white and shaped like a donkey,yet larger. Calling the creature Buraq, the angel bade the Prophet to mount it.The instant he did, he discovered that Buraq was a lightning steed. Each of itssteps reached as far as the horizon. The Prophet was struck with awe and fear.In a matter of minutes they made a journey as far as the farthest mosque, whichstood in Jerusalem. At that time there was no mosque there, but Gabriel assuredthe Prophet of their destination. Inside the mosque were many holy fathers andprophets who had come before. After praying with them, the Prophet was told toremount Buraq, for his night journey was only half begun.”Aisha’s voice rose and fell in the dark. Her eyes sparkled in the near darkness.Among the Arabs, no one is more esteemed than a poet. I never knew of a womanpoet, but she could have been one. I felt myself filled with the scent of roses.“When the Prophet got back on Buraq, he looked to the horizon, where the nextstep would land them. Instead, with a clanging hoofbeat that printed the rockbeneath its feet, the creature soared into the sky. The stars came as near as abonfire in the Prophet’s courtyard. They passed through the crystal dome of thesky, higher and higher. How could this be? He was still alive, yet the Prophetwas entering the seven heavens. Each was dazzling to the eyes and blissful tothe heart. When they reached the seventh heaven, a tree blocked the way. Thiswas the sacred tree that no angel could set foot beyond. And yet the Prophet wasallowed to enter. He exchanged holy words with the great forebears of Islam,first Abraham, then Moses, and finally Jesus. The final gift was to be usheredinto the presence of Allah. Before the Most Glorious the Prophet was reduced toawed silence. Allah spoke and gave him guidance for the faithful. Their firstduty, said God, was to pray fifty times a day. The Prophet bowed in obedienceand withdrew. When he was back among the elder prophets, Moses asked him whatGod had said. When he heard about the duty to pray fifty times a day, Mosesshook his head. ‘That is impossible. Go back and ask for an easier way.’ TheProphet returned to Allah not once but several times, until his pleas wereheard. God granted that the faithful should pray not fifty, but five times aday.”In the dark Aisha heard me chuckle. She stopped telling me her tale.“Don’t be angry,” I said. “You’ve brought me a smile. I always knew the Prophetwas canny. He even talked God around to his way.”I couldn’t see Aisha’s reaction, but she didn’t scold me. Maybe she smiled, too.But the story came to an abrupt end. The lightning steed brought Muhammad backto earth, and he woke up shivering in the night air where he had fallen asleep.“Was it a dream?” I asked.“Many thought so, even those among the companions. They were shaken. The Prophethad received revelations, but he always insisted he was a man among men, not amiracle worker. One of them rushed to tell the story to my father, Abu Bakr.”“Ah,” I said. In those days I shunned Abu Bakr and barely recalled that he wasAisha’s father. “And he believed?”“Without hesitation. He said, ‘If Muhammad tells us that his journey wasn’t adream, I have no choice but to believe him. Don’t I already accept that theangel comes to him?’ It was from my father that I heard the story.”I felt Aisha’s hand press into mine again. “But you began by saying that youlive this story,” I said.“Every day. I take a journey to heaven, you see. That’s the treasure the Prophetgave us all. He opened the way so that we can follow him. We don’t need Buraq toreach God. Our steed is the soul.”Forgive me, but I was overcome. It was too much. My wife was gone. My body wouldlie next to hers very soon. What was left to me but a journey to heaven, ifthat’s possible? I held Aisha’s hand with a tight grip. Tears ran down my cheeksand were caught in the deep wrinkles there.“Allahu Akbar,” I whispered. “God is great.”“Allahu Akbar,” she repeated and slipped from the room, leaving behind theglimmer of pearls and the faint scent of roses."},{"pageContent":"AFTERWORD [003-TOC.html#backmatterpage_01]A WALK WITH MUHAMMADFew can read the life of Muhammad without feeling excited and disturbed at thesame time. I think he must have had the same conflicting reactions himself.Islam was born in a cradle of turmoil, and the arrival of Allah, one God whovanquished hundreds of ancient Arabian gods, caused an upheaval. A singleindividual had to carry the burden of violence with the awe of revelation.Muhammad didn’t see himself like Jesus, called the Son of God, or like Buddha, aprince who achieved sublime, cosmic enlightenment. An Indian proverb holds thatit only takes a spark to burn down the whole forest. Muhammad struck that spark.If the Prophet’s life were a fairy tale, he would march down from his mountaincave, spread his arms like a latter-day Moses, and tell the people what Godwanted them to do. In real life, Muhammad reacted with fear and trembling. Youand I would also fear madness if the angel Gabriel appeared in a flash ofblinding light and told us that our mission was to redeem the sinful world.God did not leave Muhammad alone. When a revelation was at hand, Muhammad wentinto a trance state that deprived him of his own will. His face became flushed;he sweated profusely. The messages he received were dire. The fate of the Arabsdepended on him. Muhammad’s divine task was to convince his people to renouncetheir ancestral idol worship and superstitious veneration of multiple gods. Ifthey didn’t, Allah had apocalyptic punishment in mind. No sinner would beforgiven. Only those who feared God and obeyed him to the letter would be saved.As for the Prophet himself, his freedom of choice was steadily removed, untilthe only path left was the proverbial razor’s edge: every word, act, and thoughtwas surrendered to God.A more fearful destiny is hard to imagine. Muhammad said, on various occasionsand in various ways, “The best in life comes from Allah. The worst is my fault.”He took that attitude, giving all the praise to God and taking all the blame onhimself. Not that every moment was about life and death. God had a way ofsolving Muhammad’s everyday problems. One of his favorite wives, Aisha, stoppedat an oasis by herself one day. A dashing Muslim rider came by and offered toescort her on her journey. They were alone together for a night, and tonguesbegan to wag. Eventually petty gossip turned into a major scandal. The Prophetprayed to Allah, and a revelation came. Aisha was innocent. Anyone who spoke outagainst her was to be whipped.In the same vein, Muhammad had helpful revelations that his various wives shouldstop bickering among themselves. God told the women around him to obey theirhusband in all things. The Almighty sometimes mentioned the Prophet’s enemies byname in the Koran and roundly condemned them. He offered hints about how todebate with critics and naysayers. When the Muslim exiles tried to reenter Meccaand were turned back, there was a revelation to tell them that their apparentdefeat was really a victory.Muhammad could count upon God’s counsel to extricate him from almost any tightplace. Scholars divide the revelations, amounting to thousands of separatemessages, into two main parts. The ones that came in Mecca focus on theology;the messages that came in Medina, after the Hijra, or migration, of 622 CE,mostly center on managing the new faith and the newly faithful.The Koran is about salvation and apocalypse—just as in Jesus’s lifetime, theearly converts to Islam believed that the end of the world was at hand. But theKoran is also about war, politics, infighting, treaties, jealousies, and theeveryday headaches of running the government in Medina, including the collectionof taxes.PRACTICAL REDEMPTIONAll religions attempt to bring worshipers closer to God, but few are as explicitas the Koran. The famous “five pillars of Islam” prescribe the duties of thefaithful:The profession of faith, declaring that Allah is the one God and Muhammad hisprophet.Prayer, which takes place five times a day facing Mecca, the most sacred placeon earth.Charity, through the giving of alms to the poor.Fasting during the month of Ramadan.Pilgrimage, at least once in a lifetime, to Mecca.Each of these duties is a reminder that earthly life exists for one purpose: toredeem fallen humanity. One can see a common thread in the five pillars: byprayer, professing one’s faith, or taking a month off to turn inward, theworshiper sets ordinary affairs aside, allowing space for God to enter.Redemption is turned into a practical matter of things to do, and you can lookout your window to see how your neighbors are coming along, as they can withyou. This became deeply important when the first Muslims had to defendthemselves from persecution by drawing into a tight community of believers, theUmmah. The image of presenting a united front against a hostile world remainspotent today.The tight bonding of believers didn’t leave out theology. There are six corebeliefs that would be agreed upon even by sects that otherwise divide alongfierce lines like the Sunni and Shia. These beliefs are:Belief in Allah as the only true GodBelief in the prophets sent by God as well as lesser messengers and warnersBelief in angelsBelief in the books sent by God: the Torah, the Gospels, and the KoranBelief in judgment day and the resurrection of the deadBelief in fate, whether good or badThese beliefs overlap closely with those of both Judaism and Christianity. Butno religion can escape the claim that it surmounts all others. This is also truewith Islam, which sees itself as “confirming” the past, meaning that God updatedhis old message as written in the Torah and the New Testament. He sent a newprophet whose word was final; therefore Jews and Christians should pay attentionand convert. This would show their true belief in the one God. Naturally, therewas much resistance to this idea, and the result has been a long, sad history ofreligious conflict.Allah wanted the updated message to be complete. As a result, Islam became morethan a religion; it is a way of life so all-consuming that nothing has been leftto chance. God has a commandment for everything. In case there are any gaps,thousands of hadith exist to guide the course of everybody’s daily affairs. Ahadith is a story or incident in the Prophet’s life. It indicates how he reactedwhen somebody brought a problem to him or a lawsuit or a question about rightand wrong. Aisha, the favored wife whom Muhammad married when she was a smallchild, long outlived him. She became the source of some two thousand hadith.These have the force of law, even today. So while Christians may muse over “Whatwould Jesus do?” the parallel question has a literal answer for Muslims. Thereare few crises in life, major or minor, where the faithful don’t know exactlywhat Muhammad would do.One should note that a great deal of Islamic doctrine evolved after theProphet’s death, which came suddenly. Jesus’s disciples were also suddenlybereft after the crucifixion. Muhammad’s followers were disconcerted, butquickly began to assemble a complete, authorized Koran from all the existingsuras. The compilation went through struggles and arguments, needless to say,leaving enough disputes to occupy generations of scholars and interpreters.THE PATH OF SUBMISSIONBecause the Prophet’s life was filled with God’s instructions, almost by theminute, for today’s Muslims the path to leading a good life leaves no room fordoubt. The highest virtue in Islam is surrender or submission. Those of usstanding outside the faith may have a difficult time understanding this virtue.We reject the absence of free choice. Most of us want to have it both ways, toobey God some of the time and make up our own minds the rest of the time. Islam,to be blunt, considers that the path to damnation. Why would anyone willinglyset his or her own sinful desires against the precious word of God? Why would aperson choose to live a single moment apart from the divine?There’s no getting around this vital difference, and it explains many things.For one, it explains the spread of Islam, which happened like wildfire within afew years of Muhammad’s death. His companions, the handful who migrated toMedina with him, began life as merchants and traders in Mecca. But Ali, Umar,and Uthman ended their lives as caliphs, rulers of an empire that extended fromEgypt to Persia. This vast expansion wasn’t due to warfare, although the Muslimswere fierce warriors. Instead, Islam offered closeness to God. Closeness to Godis a human yearning that wants to be fulfilled. Islam didn’t fulfill it intheory, but in everyday actions.Ordinary people were used to praying to idols and offering sacrifices in returnfor rewards as basic as a good crop and a reliable water supply. Allah took overthe functions of hundreds of idols, and in addition there was the promise ofgoing to Paradise after death, dwelling forever in the Garden.If the promise is delightful, the reverse is terrifying. Living according toyour own whims, without regard for God’s commands, leads to hellfire. That iswhy modernism has met with stubborn resistance in the Islamic world. Going onthe Internet, watching television, or attending a nightclub could imperil yoursoul. Orthodoxy is always that way, regardless of the faith. Muslims don’t holda patent on fearing the creeping infection of secularism. Fundamentalists inevery faith hold the same suspicions. To them, the worldly has always been theenemy of the other-worldly.If we look at Arabia before Muhammad, life was so harsh that it must have comeas an immense relief to find a way that promised not just eternal life, butthings far more basic: the end of blood feuds, a sense of belonging, the comfortof one faith for one people, and simple rules for getting along. The lifedictated by the Koran wasn’t a prison deprived of free will—it was order inplace of chaos.The tale of Muhammad and the five mares is central here. As recounted in thenovel, Muhammad had a string of horses that he loved. It was his habit to takethem out into the desert for a run. One day he took them out so far from Medinathat the animals became desperately thirsty. Up ahead they smelled an oasis andbegan to gallop toward it. Muhammad let them reach almost to the water hole, andthen he gave a sharp whistle for them to return. Most of the horses keptrunning, but five mares turned around and returned to the Prophet’s hand. Heused these five mares to breed the strain of Arabian horses that are most prizedtoday.The story is a parable about religious obedience, and when it’s told, the moralis that God favors loyalty above all other virtues.THE RETURN OF THE LOSTOne has to remember that the Arabs of Muhammad’s time felt like a people who hadbeen left behind. The desert isolated them almost completely, making them safefrom invasion, but also immune to religious influence. I was amazed to read thatduring Muhammad’s childhood not a single Bible could have been found in theArabian Peninsula. The dominant tribe in Mecca, the Quraysh, consideredthemselves the children of Abraham. And yet they also knew that Abraham’sreligion had been lost; they inherited only scraps and dusty remains. That’s whythe myth of Zamzam, the well that God created to bring water to his children,was so crucial. When Zamzam was lost, so was the water of life. When it wasfound again, by the Qurayshi chieftain Muttalib, the water of life returned.Muhammad was in the direct line of Muttalib, who was his grandfather. Historywrites itself from front to back, and once Islam thrived, writers were quick torevisit the Prophet’s early life and fill it with portents and omens. They hadChrist in mind as a rough model. We are given a lone mystical hermit who layshands on the head of the boy Muhammad and predicts that he will be the prophetforetold by the Bible. In Medina another mystic, a Jewish rabbi, arrives toproclaim that the last prophet is at hand. In Mecca a handful of monotheists,known as hanif, instruct the young orphan in their ways, and the most outspokenof them, Waraqah, is bold enough to proclaim Muhammad as the chosen one at thevery doors of the Kaaba.If this is exciting, the disturbing parts aren’t far behind. The Jews of Medinawere the first to welcome Muhammad and his tiny band of followers into theirmidst. The young faith was quite fragile. No more than a dozen close followers,the companions, had developed over the twelve years since the first revelation.For the first three years Muhammad told no one about his calling outside hisfamily. Under constant threats from the Quraysh, perhaps forty to a hundredconverts emerged before the Hijra. It is remarkable that the Jews of Medina werewilling to accept Muhammad as someone to judge their disputes and to draw up aplan for bringing peace to all the warring tribes in the city.Yet in the next few years, as the faithful grew in numbers, God told Muhammad todrive the Jewish tribes out of Medina, exiling them to marginal wastelands.Later, when Jewish resentment flared up and the last remaining tribe cooperatedwith the invading army from Mecca, Muhammad exercised violent retribution. Allthe men were beheaded, and the women and children divided as the spoils of war,many to be sold into slavery. This horrifying decision, because it came byrevelation, has been praised by Islamic historians. Only in recent times havesome revisionists considered it as the barbaric crime it is.Here we meet the dark underside of the Prophet’s mission. His every act and wordhas the force of God behind it (except perhaps only the “satanic verses” in theKoran, so called because they were inspired by demonic forces to delude andbriefly mislead Muhammad—he soon saw through them and returned to Allah’sguidance). I don’t think Muhammad believed himself to be infallible. We havetouching stories about his humility. He admitted his mistakes, and far frombeing the only one to give orders in times of crisis, he sat in council with hischieftains and listened to their voices.After his death, the ranks closed around absolute truth, which meant that it wasa test of faith to turn any act by the Prophet, even the beheading of hisenemies, into something right and good. On this point, the critics of Muhammadcite his marriage to Aisha. She was the youngest daughter of Abu Bakr, themerchant who stood up among the first and most devout of the new Muslims. At theage of six Aisha was betrothed to a husband, until Muhammad had a revelationthat she was meant for him. The prospective groom was persuaded to give her up.The marriage to Muhammad took place but wasn’t consummated until Aisha was nine.Beyond Islam, this episode is more than distasteful. Within the faith, however,it is praised. None of Muhammad’s other wives were virgins, and the rationale isthat Aisha served as a kind of Virgin Mary, made all the more pure because shewas so young. To the outside world, this is a prescription for blind fanaticism.CLOSING THE GAPThe bald fact is that we cannot identify with customs that exist across such ayawning abyss. And as mentioned, every faith closes ranks around its own versionof the absolute truth. Islamic extremism is no exception, and unfortunately theloud minority have poisoned our view.The God who speaks in the Koran isn’t simply an Old Testament God with revengeand punishment in mind, whimsically deciding who will be rewarded or destroyed.The Koran affirms Judaism and Christianity. The most significant mystical eventin Muhammad’s life was the night journey he took to Jerusalem on the back of alightning steed. Muhammad worshiped there with his predecessors and then waslifted up to the seventh heaven, where he communed with Abraham, Moses, andJesus before being ushered into the presence of Allah.The purpose of the Koran, to borrow Jesus’s words, was to fulfill the law, notto break it. It took warfare to spread the new faith, but just over the horizonwas a Paradise in which one God welcomed all believers. We can say that Islambrought monotheism to replace polytheism—the Arabs got one God in place of many.But the message was more universal. Allah wasn’t Yahweh dressed in a caftan. Hewas the One, an all-pervasive presence that upheld the cosmos.Every Muslim loves the Prophet, but one special branch of Islam developed anintense, mystical love for Allah—the Sufis. Within their approach to God, we canglimpse the immense beauty and power of Muhammad’s legacy. In my childhood, Iwas taken to visit Sufishrines, usually the graves of saints who were prayed tofor miracles. There were all-night poetry readings and dancing, truly ecstaticevents. For me, these Sufis, with their extreme courtesy to one another and theever present reminder of God’s love, stood for Islam—white domes against thesky, romantic tales of princes and princesses, and the hypnotic call of themuezzins from their minarets.The sweetness of these images is real, even if history has added a bitteraftertaste. Sufis strove for unity with God, and their path to enlightenment waslove. Devotion led to rapture, and rapture led to the Infinite. No romance ofthe soul is more extreme, as witnessed in this poem by Rumi, the greatestSufimystic:You miracle-seekers are always looking for signs,You go to bed crying and wake up in tears.You plead for what doesn’t comeUntil it darkens your days.You sacrifice everything, even your mind,You sit down in the fire, wanting to become ashes,And when you meet with a sword,You throw yourself on it.Fall into the habit of such helpless mad things—You will have your sign.These lines aren’t a flight of fancy—they describe what Sufis actually did toreach God. The beauty of union with the One was exquisite, but the seeker burnedhimself to ashes before reaching his Beloved.If Muhammad opened the door to God, Sufis were the ones who flung themselvesthrough it, blindly and crying out with passion. This ardent striving is thebest interpretation of jihad, and the one I hope will prevail. It brings lightout of darkness, as Rumi proclaimed:In love that is new—there must you die.Where the path begins on the other side.Melt into the sky and break freeFrom the prison whose walls you must smash.Greet the hue of dayOut of a fog of darkness.Now is the time!Muhammad’s ultimate legacy was to make time for the timeless. The One has nolimitations in time and space. No face or body can be assigned to Him, which iswhy Islam forbids portrayals of God. By comparison to Allah’s transcendentreality, the world below is a trifling illusion. Thus the heart of Islam callsthe faithful to look beyond illusion to find reality. For the Sufis, fear of apunishing Father evolved into a love affair with the invisible One, whoseessence is mercy, compassion, and the sacredness of all life.Muhammad can be judged by the worst of his followers or the best. He can beblamed for planting the seeds of fanaticism and jihad or praised for bringingthe word of God to a wasteland. In my walk with Muhammad I found that everypreconception was unfair. What the Prophet bequeathed to the world is entangledwith the best and worst in all of us.I doubt that the angel Gabriel has an appointment to meet me in a flash ofblinding light. But if he does, I’d expect to wrestle with revelation every day.God didn’t make life easier for Muhammad. He made it far more difficult, and thewonder of his story is how he brought light out of darkness with all thefallibility of “a man among men.” The message he brought wasn’t pure; it neveris. As long as our yearning for God exceeds our ability to live in holiness, thetangled mystery of the Prophet will be our own mystery too."},{"pageContent":"ABOUT THE AUTHOR [003-TOC.html#aboutauthor_page]DEEPAK CHOPRA is the author of more than fifty-five books translated into overthirty-five languages, including numerous New York Times bestsellers in bothfiction and nonfiction categories.
