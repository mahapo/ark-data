It was a tip-of-the-iceberg story, although few people realized itat the time. There was too much background noise from the usual stream of healthrisks people were supposed to heed. Among the latest risks: Working more thanfifty-five hours a week can be bad for your health. Pregnant women are at higherrisk of not getting enough iodine.These were not tip-of-the-iceberg stories—more like the drone of familiar advicethat most people have learned to shrug off. But one item was different.Twenty-four experts on old-age dementia—the greatest health threat around theworld—were asked to assess the overall chances for preventing every kind ofdementia, including Alzheimer’s disease. Their conclusion, published in theprestigious British medical journal The Lancet: One-third of dementia cases canbe prevented. There is currently no drug treatment to cure or prevent dementia,so this was startling news on the face of it.What was the key to preventing dementia? Lifestyle changes, with a differentfocus at every stage of life. The experts singled out nine specific factors thataccounted for around 35 percent of dementia cases: “To reduce the risk, factorsthat make a difference include getting an education (staying in school untilover the age of fifteen); reducing high blood pressure, obesity, and diabetes;avoiding or treating hearing loss in mid-life; not smoking; getting physicalexercise; and reducing depression and social isolation later in life.”One item from the list was startling: staying in school until at least the ageof fifteen. What in the world? A dreaded condition of old age could be reducedby doing something when you are a teenager? For that matter, it was also alittle peculiar that addressing hearing loss in middle age was related to alower risk of dementia. Something new was going on. If you looked close enough,this news story was signaling a trend in medicine that promises to be a majorrevolution.Not just in dementia, but across the board researchers are drastically pushingback the timeline of disease and life-threatening disorders like hypertension,heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and even mental disorders like depression andschizophrenia. When you catch a winter cold, you notice the symptoms andrealize, with annoyance, that you were exposed to the cold virus a few daysearlier. The incubation period was short and invisible; only the appearance ofsymptoms told the tale. But lifestyle disorders aren’t like that. Theirincubation period is invisible but very long—years and decades. This simple facthas become more and more critical in medical thinking. Now it looms largerperhaps than any other factor in who gets sick and who stays well.Instead of focusing on lifestyle disorders when symptoms appear, or advisingprevention when high risk has developed, doctors are probing into normal,healthy life twenty to thirty years earlier. A new vision of disease has beenemerging, telling us some very good news. If you practice lifelong wellness,beginning as early as childhood, the many threats that attack us from middle ageonward can be defeated—the secret is to act before any sign of threat appears.This is known as “incremental medicine”—the iceberg of which a single storyabout dementia is the tip. Take the seemingly strange finding about education.Experts estimate that dementia could be reduced by 8 percent globally if kidsstayed in school until they were fifteen, one of the biggest single reductionson the list. The reason why traces a long trail. The more educated you are, themore information your brain stores and the better it accesses what you’velearned. This buildup of information, starting in childhood, leads to somethingneuroscientists have identified as “cognitive reserve,” a boost to the brain interms of added connections and pathways between neurons. When you have thisboost, the memory loss associated with Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementiais countered, because the brain has extra paths to follow if some grow weak ordiseased. (We discuss this in more detail in our section on Alzheimer’s at theend of the book.)As medical logic goes, long trails are changing everyone’s thinking, becausethey exist in many if not most diseases. Suddenly it’s not about isolatedfactors like not smoking, losing weight, going to the gym, and worrying aboutstress. It’s about a continuous style of living where self-care matters everyday in every way. Not smoking, losing weight, and going to the gym still havetheir benefits. But lifelong wellness isn’t the same as lowering your risks fordisorder A or B. Only a holistic approach will ultimately work. Wellness is nolonger just a valid alternative to regular prevention. It’s the iceberg, thefour-hundred-pound gorilla, and the elephant in the room rolled into one.Wellness is the great hope springing up all around us. When the public gainsfull knowledge of this fact, prevention will never be the same. But to grasp howradically things will change, we have to back away and examine the currentsituation in health care, where threat increasingly overwhelms hope.THE IMMUNITY CRISISModern medicine makes so many headlines every day that they blur together, andit becomes nearly impossible to sort out what’s important here and now. It canseem like just being alive is a risk to your health. So let’s simplify things.The most urgent crisis facing human health today comes from something mostpeople take for granted: their immunity. This is the crunch where health anddisease clash. Immunity is medically defined as the defense your body mountsagainst invasive threats, medically known as pathogens. In common parlance theseare vaguely lumped together as germs, the host of bacteria and viruses thatexists for one purpose, not to make us sick but to promote their DNA. As abiosphere, the Earth is a vast arena in which DNA evolves, and although we feelspecial, even unique, as human beings, our DNA is only one gene pool amongmillions.Immunity is what keeps our genes ahead of survival threats, and it has beenbrilliantly successful to date. Despite catastrophic events in the history ofdisease that swamped our DNA like a tsunami—smallpox in the ancient world,bubonic plague in the Middle Ages, AIDS in modern times, just to mention a fewterrible examples—our immune system has never faced the level of threat it facestoday. Smallpox, plague, and AIDS didn’t annihilate Homo sapiens as a species,nor has any other pathogen, because three factors saved us:1. None of these diseases is so communicable that every person on Earth couldcatch it. Either the germ couldn’t survive in the open air or people lived farenough apart that the disease couldn’t survive while crossing the distancebetween them.2. Our immune system is capable of improvising new kinds of genetic responsevery quickly, through a process known as hypermutation. This constitutes animmediate tactic for combating unknown pathogens the moment they enter the body.3. The rise of modern medicine has come to the rescue with drug and surgicaltreatments when the body’s immune system can’t fight a disease on its own.These three powerful agents are all necessary for you to stay healthy, but theymay have reached a tipping point. The global competition among millions ofstrains of DNA has been heating up to alarming levels. Immunity can no longer betaken for granted no matter what part of the world you live in. Our overburdeneddefense system against disease is steadily crumbling. That’s because of a hostof problems that actually go beyond the scary potential for a new epidemic,whether from the Zika virus or avian flu. Those threats grab the headlines, butwith far less publicity the whole health-care situation is fraught on multiplefronts.WHY A TIPPING POINT IS COMING CLOSER• Modern travel has drastically reduced the distance between all peoples, makingit much easier and faster for new pathogens to spread and find new hosts.• Viruses and bacteria mutate faster than ever because new human hosts keepmultiplying at unheard-of rates of population growth.• New drugs cannot be developed as fast as potentially hazardous strains of DNAthat mutate at the microscopic level of bacteria and viruses.• While the threat keeps mounting, medical systems are burdened by inertia,income inequality, frightening expense, and massive scientific complexity.• Prevention has existed for fifty years but has failed to eradicate persistentheart disease, hypertension (high blood pressure), type 2 diabetes, widespreaddepression and anxiety, and the latest epidemic, obesity.• An aging population faces a higher incidence of cancer and the threat ofdementia, chiefly through Alzheimer’s disease.• Older people have higher expectations, wanting to be healthy and active wellpast sixty-five or even eighty-five.• Turning into a drug-dependent culture has caused a host of problems, includingopiate addiction, and even when drastic problems are sidestepped, it’s estimatedthat the average seventy-year-old takes seven prescription drugs.• New strains of “superbugs” like MRSA are staying ahead of antibiotics andantivirus medications.This list is too long and alarming to ignore. Your health is intertwined withevery factor on it, and as serious as it would be if the world went past atipping point, the immediate issue is keeping yourself from going past it.The secret is to expand the definition of immunity and then to use a rich arrayof choices with one aim, to supercharge your immunity. According to the standardunderstanding, your immunity gets stronger basically when you develop a newantibody against this winter’s flu virus, for example, but not when you eat ananti-inflammatory diet. Yet it is now recognized that low-grade chronicinflammation, a condition with almost no overt signs you would generally be ableto detect, is linked to more and more disorders, including heart disease andcancer. In an expanded definition, fighting inflammation would be absolutelycritical to total immunity.TOTAL IMMUNITY AND THE HEALING SELFTotal immunity is the measure of holistic health. A crucial aspect was coveredin our book Super Genes, where we introduced the concept of DNA as somethingdynamic, ever changing, and totally responsive to a person’s lifetime ofexperience. If DNA were frozen, locked up, and unchanging, then superchargingyour immunity would be wishful thinking. Such a viewpoint held sway, however,for decades. A new era began as soon as DNA was freed up through a model thatshowed how totally our gene activity is affected by the world around us. Thecompetition among global strains of DNA suddenly became much more urgent.We felt that total immunity demanded more. What about the mind and its effect onhealth? What about behavior, habits, and the contribution of the family? Whyshould germs be given more importance than other common causes of disease, forexample cancer, which is almost always unrelated to invading micro-organisms? Toencompass everything, it was necessary to abolish the boundary between mind andbody. A leap of imagination was called for. Therefore, we’re introducing a newterm, the healing self, that satisfies the real meaning of wholeness. Two rolesthat are involved every day in keeping us healthy have long been kept separate.The first role is the healer; the second is the one being healed. These tworoles are currently played by an outside healer and the patient who depends onhim or her. The outside healer doesn’t necessarily mean an MD. The importantword here is outside, which puts the burden of care on someone besides you.The traditional separation of roles isn’t realistic as far as your body isconcerned. Immunity is centered on the self. A doctor’s role isn’t to boost yourimmune response from day to day. Medical care becomes active, for the most part,only when symptoms appear, and by then the immune response has broken down. Inthe broader picture, the entire healing response has broken down, of whichimmunity is the centerpiece. There has always been a mismatch between whatmedicine can do and what the body needs if it wants to protect itself in theglobal competition of DNA.The doctor-patient partnership isn’t designed for meeting the competition andwinning. But the healing self, by merging healer and healed, can surmount thelooming threat. (Important note: We certainly aren’t advising you to ignore oravoid a physician’s care when it is needed.) If you become proactive about yourown immunity, the whole situation changes. Looking back at the list of threatswe began with, some urgently needed improvements can occur once you learn whatit means to adopt the healing self.BENEFITS OF THE HEALING SELF• It is noninvasive and involves no reliance on external therapies.• It maintains natural balance and boosts your immune system through lifestylechoices.• Lifestyle choices can prevent many forms of cancer and hold promise forpreventing Alzheimer’s disease and even reversing symptoms of dementia.• Successful aging will consist of a long healthspan as well as a long lifespan.• Drug dependency is staved off because healing occurs before the stage ofsymptoms begins. The vast majority of drugs are prescribed late in the diseaseprocess, a stage you don’t have to reach if you act early enough. This is truefor almost every lifestyle disorder, including heart disease and cancer,disorders that create the strongest need for drug treatments.These are practical outcomes from adopting the dual role—healer and healed—ofthe healing self. What makes it all possible is raising your awareness. What youaren’t aware of you can’t change. The biggest thing most people aren’t aware ofis the very possibility of self-healing. Let’s see how this applies to immunity.All living things need to repel outside threats to their DNA. Modern medicinerecognizes two types of immunity, passive and active. As the term implies,passive immunity is beyond your control, being genetically based. You inheritedyour mother’s antibodies in the womb, and after you were born other antibodieswere transferred in her breast milk. (There are also medical means to pass onantibodies from another person through blood and plasma infusions or even thetransfer of another person’s T-cells, but these methods are rarely used andcarry high risks.)The other kind of immunity, active immunity, fights disease organisms(pathogens) directly on the front lines. All living creatures above a certainlevel have innate, or inborn, immune defenses, including plants, fungi, andmulticelled animals. The innate immune system is very general. It can detectthat a pathogen is invading the host and then release chemicals to fight back.But active immunity in higher animals, including humans, has evolved far beyondthis stage. We have specific immune cells (for example, T-cells and B-cells)that have evolved to a nearly miraculous capacity for responding to invaders.Myriad times a day the immune response identifies one kind of germ fromthousands of possibilities and rushes into action to chemically disable theinvader. Specific white cells engulf its remains, and these are quickly flushedout of your body. On the other hand, you can’t help but notice when this precisesequence of events makes mistakes. The result is an allergy, which is the resultof mistaking a harmless substance (pollen, cat dander, gluten, etc.) for anenemy, giving rise to a full-blown chemical reaction that is often harmful. Thisimmune response can often be due to bacteria that ride along with the substanceinto the body. Even pollen has a microbiome! In other cases, the immune systemmay be activated to attack specific proteins in the body, causing an autoimmunedisorder like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus.Staying alive depends on minimizing such errors. Therefore, every disease yourancestors successfully fought off is stored as the antibodies you inherited, andwhen you ward off a new illness, like a new strain of flu, you add to this vastmemory bank. Although the function of active immunity was discovered as far backas 1921 by the English immunologist Alexander Glenny, its precise mechanismswaited for decades to be understood. The picture is incredibly complex,biologically speaking, yet at least one external method for boosting activeimmunity is more than two centuries old: vaccination.As we all learned in school, in the late 1700s the rural English physicianEdward Jenner developed the first vaccine—and became known as “the father ofimmunology”—after he observed that milkmaids generally were immune to smallpox,a disease that had reached epidemic proportions. In France the philosopherVoltaire estimated that 60 percent of the populace contracted smallpox and 20percent died of it. Jenner’s insight was to take pus from a milkmaid who hadcontracted a much milder disease, cowpox, and inject it into his patients totransmit the same immunity that the milkmaid had.Despite the current controversy surrounding vaccinations in some quarters, whatJenner established was proof that active immunity can be boosted. One does nothave to wait until the course of evolution, which occurs over tens or hundredsof thousands of years, brings an improvement. The standard recommendations aboutdiet, exercise, good sleep, and maintaining a good weight all benefit a person’simmune status. These standard recommendations appear on Harvard Medical School’shealth website (www.health.harvard.edu [http://www.health.harvard.edu]), withtwo additions for avoiding infection: remembering to wash your hands frequentlyand cooking meats thoroughly.Yet on the question of boosting the immune response itself, the Harvard websiteis skeptical:> Many products on store shelves claim to boost or support immunity. But the> concept of boosting immunity actually makes little sense scientifically. In> fact, boosting the number of cells in your body—immune cells or others—is not> necessarily a good thing. For example, athletes who engage in “blood> doping”—pumping blood into their systems to boost their number of blood cells> and enhance their performance—run the risk of strokes.The Harvard Health Publishing website goes on to say: “But that doesn’t mean theeffects of lifestyle on the immune system aren’t intriguing and shouldn’t bestudied. Researchers are exploring the effects of diet, exercise, age,psychological stress, and other factors on the immune system response, both inanimals and in humans. In the meantime, general healthy-living strategies are agood way to start giving your immune system the upper hand.”The main reason for this skeptical attitude is that there are so many kinds ofcells in the immune system that perform so many functions. But on the contraryside is powerful evidence from the mind-body connection. A variety ofpsychological states from grief to depression lower people’s immunity, makingthem more susceptible to getting sick. This deterioration in immunity can’t beseen under a microscope; it doesn’t show up as physical changes in specificcells. There are not many studies that directly connect stress, for example, tophysical changes in the immune system, yet the connection between high stressand getting sick has been well documented and is doubted by no one. If we expandour definition of immunity to everything that keeps us healthy, there is evenmore evidence about how lifestyle disorders like hypertension and heart diseasebecome a greater threat when someone is poor, depressed, lonely, or livingwithout social support.These findings all point in the same direction. Immunity can be transformed intototal immunity, but not by restricting our focus to the immune system, whichincludes only the physical side. The mind must be given equal importance, whichis why self is the key word in the healing self.THE MYSTERY OF HEALINGSelf sounds like something psychological, an invisible entity that you possessbut that is unrelated to your body. If you develop an ovarian cyst or high bloodpressure, those are problems rooted physically in the body, not the self. But isthis really so? How you see yourself today makes a huge difference in what yourbody will be like tomorrow. Imagine that two strangers knock on your door. Bothhave surprising propositions.The first stranger says, “I’m an MD, and I do advanced research on aging. Mylife’s goal has been to find a pill that will alter the genes that cause aging.I think I’ve found a promising formula, and we need subjects to test it on.”He holds up a bottle of tiny blue pills.“The trials start today, and I’d like you to volunteer,” he says. “This is ablind trial. You’ll take these pills twice a day for six months. Half of thesubjects will be getting a dummy pill, a placebo. But just think what this couldmean, the reversal of aging. Why should we accept that growing old is inevitablewhen we can unlock the genetic key that will change everything?”His excitement impresses you, but the second stranger is wearing a faint smile.You ask her if she’s part of the same drug trial.“No, but I am here to show you how to reverse your age,” she says. “No drugs orplacebos are involved. Your age will start to reverse in around five days. Aftera week you can expect a lot of other beneficial changes. My experiment is short,but effective.” She points to the first stranger. “His drug could have seriousside effects. The FDA will have to approve his experimental drug if it showsresults, and the approval process costs hundreds of millions of dollars andtakes years to complete.” The faint smile returns to her lips. “Of course, thechoice is yours.”Which would you choose? Although we set up the situation as imaginary, in factit’s very real. Drug companies are constantly testing anti-aging drugs, with themost recent trend involving altering your DNA. There could be breakthroughs thatwill make a huge difference in human aging, long considered “a one-way street toincapacitation,” to quote Professor Ellen Langer, a Harvard psychologist who hasperformed remarkable experiments of her own. Yet Langer could easily be thesecond stranger at your door. Professor Langer has a track record for reversingthe signs of aging and extending longevity without drugs. In fact, she bypassesthe body altogether and goes straight to the mind.Langer’s most famous experiment worked as follows. In 1981 eight men in theirseventies, who were in good health but showing signs of age, were bused to aformer monastery in New Hampshire. When they entered, the men found themselvesimmersed in the past, specifically the year 1959, listening to the crooning ofPerry Como. They dressed in clothes suitable to that year. They watched ablack-and-white TV and read newspapers filled with stories about Castro’stakeover in Cuba and the hostile attitude of Nikita Khrushchev, premier of theSoviet Union. For a movie they watched Otto Preminger’s Anatomy of a Murder,which came out in 1959, and sports talk focused on bygone figures like MickeyMantle and Floyd Patterson.As a control, another group of eight men lived as they normally would but weretold to reminisce about the past. The time-capsule environment group were toldsomething very different—they were to act exactly as if it were 1959 and theywere twenty years younger. By any reasonable medical standards, the results ofthe pretend time travel should have been nil. But Langer had done earlierstudies at Yale with elderly residents of nursing homes. She discovered thatsigns of aging, particularly memory loss, could be reversed through the simplestpositive reinforcement. Giving someone an incentive to remember, such as smallrewards that depended on their test performance, brought back memory thateveryone else had assumed was irreversible.But even Langer didn’t expect the dramatic results of her total-immersionexperiment. Before entering the time-capsule environment, the men were tested onvarious markers of aging, such as grip strength, dexterity, and how well theycould hear and see. At the end of the five days, the group that was immersed inthe world of their younger selves showed improved flexibility, dexterity, andposture. They also improved on seven out of eight measures, including bettervision, a startling finding. They looked younger as assessed by outside judges.These results were significantly better than in the control group, who alsoshowed improvements in the same physical and mental areas through reminiscingabout the past—for example, 63 percent of subjects in the time-capsule groupscored higher on an intelligence test as compared with 44 percent of the controlgroup.“What matters here is what actually happened,” Langer explains. “Men who changedtheir perspective changed their bodies.” Thirty-six years ago Professor Langerwas proceeding more or less intuitively. In 2017 we have research that indicateshow changing experiences can alter gene expression and train the brain tocontinue developing new pathways, as we do when we learn new things or changeour perspective (more on those breakthroughs in later chapters).(In 2010, BBC One produced a TV series called The Young Ones, in which six agingcelebrities lived together in a setting straight out of 1975. As in Langer’sprevious experiment nearly thirty years earlier, the participants seemed to getyounger in front of our eyes. One celebrity who arrived barely able to bend overto put on his shoes found new suppleness on the dance floor. In general,everyone progressively began to look younger, from their posture to their facialexpressions.)The reversal of aging is very closely tied to healing, because both have longbeen considered totally physical and confined to bodily processes that proceedindependent of the mind. Langer was among the first to explode theseassumptions. It’s easy to get lost in the fascination and mystery of whypretending to live in the past should change a person so quickly. But the mostimportant clue is that the changes were holistic. Doctors are trained to dealwith the body one organ, tissue, or even cell at a time. There is no medicalrationale for how so many functions can improve at once, especially throughplayacting. Langer’s results leave the placebo effect in the dust, because theplacebo effect depends upon fooling a patient that he is taking a potent drugwhen all that is administered is a dummy pill.In the time-travel experiment, no promises were made, no expectations raised.The only medicine involved was a new experience, and that was enough to confoundall medical assumptions up to that time.In one of her earlier experiments, Langer went into a retirement home and againdivided her subjects into two groups. Both were given some houseplants for theirroom. One group was told that they were responsible for keeping the plantsalive, and that they could make choices in their own daily schedule. The othergroup was told that the staff would tend the plants, and in addition they weregiven no choice in their fixed daily schedule. At the end of eighteen months,twice as many subjects in the first group were still alive compared with thesecond group.The entire medical community should have had an “aha” experience when theseexperiments were performed. Decades later, using new experiences as a means ofhealing the aging and afflicted has become more feasible. Retirement homeresidents are given pets to take care of. Alzheimer’s patients have been shownto improve while listening to music. In fact, Rudy and his colleagues haveproduced an app called SPARK Memories Radio to provide music therapy toAlzheimer’s patients. A caregiver family member enters the birthdate of thepatient and any information available about their tastes in music. The app thenplays songs that were hits when the patient was between thirteen and twenty-fiveyears old, since this is the music that people generally bond with emotionallyfor the rest of their lives.E-mails from users poured into Rudy’s team, recounting how early-stageAlzheimer’s patients became calmer and less agitated, and how late-stagepatients who were vegetative suddenly “woke up” again. One family told the storyof their afflicted father, who was suffering in the late stages of the diseaseand had not spoken for months. After hearing five songs from his youth, hesuddenly sat up in bed and started telling a story about a red pickup truck andhis first girlfriend, providing perhaps too many details! The family wasblushing with embarrassment, but they were thrilled to hear him speaking again,so happily and vibrantly. Similarly, one can find YouTube videos of Parkinson’spatients who can barely walk without the support of a nurse suddenly findingtheir balance and even beginning to dance when music is played. This is thehealing power of music or, more precisely, the healing power of our responses topleasurable memories.In short, we are entering a golden age for health and healing, largely dependingon how each person employs the most common and yet most powerful tools ateveryone’s disposal: everyday experience, simple lifestyle choices, andtechniques to increase awareness. The notion is actually ancient in origin. Themedieval Indian philosopher and sage Adi Shankara declared that people grow oldand die because they see other people grow old and die.THE BODYMINDThirty years ago, doctors were suspicious of the mind-body connection, whicharoused skepticism because, unlike the heart or a flu virus, the mind isinvisible and nonphysical. Today, thanks to decades of research into how thebrain communicates with every cell in the body, trying to find a bodily processthat isn’t influenced by the mind has become the real challenge. The brain,which was once the emperor of the mind, has been deposed. “Mind” is spreadthroughout your body. A heart or liver cell doesn’t think in words andsentences, but it sends and receives complex chemical messages all the time. Thebloodstream, along with the central nervous system, is an informationsuperhighway teeming with traffic as 50 trillion cells contribute to a unitedgoal: remaining alive, healthy, and thriving. Below is how the pathways of theinformation superhighway actually look.[images/Chop_9780451495532_epub3_002_r1.jpg]Original illustration source courtesy of Blake Gurfein. Illustration by DigitalMapping Specialists.To any medical student today or decades ago, the organs in this illustration arethe familiar stuff of medical knowledge. But in the future, the added text willbecome just as standard. An educated physician will need to know everythingabout the “signaling pathways” that lead from the brain and back again. Thesepathways are actually what holds your body together. Unless each cell isdirected what to do, kept informed about 50 trillion other cells, and plays itspart in the body’s holistic balance, there is no body, only a collection ofdetached independent cells, like the ones that make up a coral reef or ajellyfish.Decades of research went into validating that the information superhighway isreal, and even today more findings are proving how detrimental the separation ofmind and body really is. In this book, we will drop the artificial divisionbetween body and mind. The proper term should be bodymind, for sound biologicalreasons. The same brain chemicals known as neurotransmitters—the essentialmolecules that enable your brain to function—are present everywhere, includingyour intestines. That discovery, made three decades ago, stunned medical scienceand helped fuel an intelligence explosion.Suddenly the immune system, which is physically separate from the brain, wasunderstood as part of a vast network of chemical messages throughout the bodythat rivals the messages sent by the brain—researchers began to refer to theimmune system as a floating brain. It doesn’t matter today that the mind-bodyconnection is invisible, because at the molecular level it isn’t. There areenough chemical clues to convince anyone that mood, beliefs, expectations,fears, memories, predispositions, habits, and old conditioning—all centered inthe mind—are critical to a person’s health.Which brings us to the crux of this book. Among the processes that can beinfluenced by a person’s awareness, healing is one of the most vital. Cells usetheir own form of chemical consciousness already. The immune response is awakeand aware all the time, constantly monitoring itself, staying vigilant for anypossible invader or other outside threat. The immune response is asself-sufficient as someone’s heartbeat or breathing. Yet immunity as a built-inresponse, which every medical student learns as basic knowledge, has a gapingflaw in it. To find the flaw, pause and simply take a deep breath. There’s theflaw, staring everyone in the face. Breathing is an automatic, involuntaryfunction, but you can step in and make it voluntary anytime you want. The sameability extends almost everywhere. You can voluntarily induce the stressresponse by going to a horror movie. You can alter your metabolism by exercisingor changing your diet. Get into a sexual situation and you bring big-timechanges to all of the above, and more. The dividing line between what happensautomatically and what happens voluntarily isn’t fixed. Choices matter, and thusthe healing self comes into play. On its own the body knows how to survive; it’sup to us to teach it how to thrive."},{"pageContent":"Part One The Healing Journey [images/Chop_9780451495532_epub3_003_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"1GETTING REAL, GETTING STARTEDLet’s get real about staying healthy. Everyone wants to stay healthy as long aspossible, but we’re confused about how to do this. Conflicting information keepsappearing, backed up by studies that disagree as often as they agree. Eagerlyfollowed fads come and go. Even very basic questions—Is milk good for adults? Doeggs increase cholesterol levels? How is obesity connected to type 2 diabetes?Why are allergies on the rise?—have been thrown into doubt.We wind up taking the attitude that life is a gamble, and anyone who stays vitaland vigorous for seventy or eighty years has been very lucky. The deeper reasonwe hold this attitude is that we feel the odds are stacked against us. Lifeisn’t an upward arc. After your prime years, getting sick is inevitable. Everyadult is statistically at risk for heart disease and cancer, the two leadingcauses of death in this country. Most people’s greatest fear, Alzheimer’sdisease, apparently strikes at random and is incurable.The gambling model for staying healthy is taught in medical school, only in amore scientific way. Despite all the marvels of modern medicine, a great dealremains uncertain. A specific cause of disease like a cold virus only makes acertain percentage of people sick, not everyone. Standard treatments all involvesome degree of unpredictability, working better for some patients than others,and sometimes not at all. Reducing risks is how prevention is defined. By eatingright, exercising regularly, and avoiding toxins like alcohol and tobacco, aperson isn’t actually attacking the cause of major disorders like diabetes,coronary artery disease, and cancer. Instead, the odds of getting sick are goingup or down. The average person doesn’t realize that these risks apply to biggroups as measured by statistics. They don’t predict what will happen to theindividual. There will always be someone who does everything right but gets sickanyway, while someone else who has paid almost no attention to their healthdodges the bullet.Even if you’re blessed with good luck, the day will come when the best doctorsin the world cannot help you. Through no fault of your own, there will be abreakdown in your health, and the casino will start to gain its advantage.Here’s why.SEVEN REASONS MEDICAL CARE STOPS WORKING• The doctor doesn’t know what caused you to get sick.• There’s no drug or surgery that will resolve the situation.• The available treatments are too risky, toxic, expensive, or all three.• The side effects of the treatment outweigh the benefits.• Your condition is too far advanced to be reversed.• You’re too old to treat safely or with much hope of recovery.• Somewhere along the line, a doctor made a mistake.When any of these breakdowns in medical care occur, whatever happens next is outof your control, and your doctor’s. After three centuries of scientific medicinemaking huge strides—a legacy the authors deeply respect—it’s becoming obviousthat the gambling model for staying healthy needs to be replaced. Too manyunacceptable things are happening:• People are living longer and yet on average suffer eight to ten years of badhealth and one to three years of disability at the end.• Cancer is still approached with grim fatalism despite the fact that up totwo-thirds of cancers are preventable.• An estimated 400,000 people die every year due to medical mistakes.• The average person feels helpless, confused, and anxious about getting sickand going to the doctor.These unacceptable things arise when the gambling model takes hold and you throwthe dice with your future. The most unacceptable thing of all is losing control.People dread the notion of falling into the hands of doctors and winding up inthe hospital. But there is an alternative. The healing self is the choice makerwho steps into the arena of everyday life and steers mind and body toward alasting healing response. A paper cut goes away after a day or two; lastwinter’s cold is a distant memory. The healing self, on the other hand, is longrange. You set out to become whole, which is the only viable strategy forremaining healthy over a lifetime.It’s amazing how far the human body has evolved to make healing possible. Younow have an opportunity to evolve consciously, making choices that willradically upgrade your immunity to disease, slow down and reverse the agingprocess, and boost the healing response. These goals aren’t achievable bygambling, but they can be achieved when you adopt a new model, the healing self.In the new model, everything comes down to the process shown in the followingdiagram:Disruption [images/Chop_9780451495532_epub3_006_r1.jpg] Healing response[images/Chop_9780451495532_epub3_006_r1.jpg] OutcomeDisruption = Any health threat: an invading virus or bacteria, a physical wound,a stressful event, distortions at the cellular or genetic level, mentaldistress, and the likeHealing response = A reaction to the disruption that restores balance in eithermind or bodyOutcome = A return to the normal, undisrupted state of balanceAs you can see, the terminology is very general. Any experience can be adisruption, not necessarily a bacteria or virus. The memory of a past trauma canmassively disrupt the body, as can losing your job or simply giving in to theimpulse to have a double cheeseburger with fries. Likewise, the body’s responseto a disruption involves the entire messaging system of the informationsuperhighway. Whatever returns the body to a normal state of balance counts ashealing.This approach is gaining traction in contemporary medicine as the whole-systemapproach, about which we will have much to say. Whole system is simply anotherway to say bodymind. It looks beyond the artificial medical-school divisionsinto separate organs and the old skepticism about the mind-body connection. Whena happy event occurs, such as falling in love, the whole system responds asmessages course through the bloodstream, central nervous system, and immunesystem. When a tragic event occurs like losing a loved one, the response is justas holistic, but the combination of chemicals in the signaling process is verydifferent. What you experience subjectively as love or grief must have a preciseconfiguration in the bodymind. If that didn’t exist, you wouldn’t have theexperience.The whole-system approach isn’t just a bright shiny new model to replace the oldones—it comes closer to reality. Nature doesn’t recognize human-made categories.Body and mind are one domain, and every organ, tissue, and cell works toward thesame goal: sustaining life. Yet the sober truth is that our bodies haven’tevolved fast enough to cope with the disruptions we’re forcing on them. Thewhole-system approach reveals holistic problems as well as holistic solutions.Consider the current epidemic of obesity facing all age levels in America. Justone factor—excessive sugar intake—is a major contributor to obesity, type 2diabetes, and least suspected of all, heart disease. You can eat sugar today andnotice no signs of these creeping disorders, but your pancreas knows that thedemand for insulin is too high; your digestive system knows that too manyuseless calories are being converted to fat; your hypothalamus knows that thequick energy of a sugar high throws your metabolism out of balance.Powerful as the innate healing response is, it depends on evolution before amajor shift can occur, which is far too slow. The only viable strategy is tointervene with conscious choices that the bodymind can absorb and adapt to. Adouble cheeseburger with fries is known to cause inflammatory markers to appearin blood plasma (the straw-colored liquid that is left in your blood after thesolid part, chiefly red blood corpuscles, is removed), along with floatingparticles of fat. This happens within a few minutes and lasts upward of sixhours. During that time, your body is experiencing a disruption. In response,your liver will rev into gear to process the excessive load of fat, and yourimmune system will attempt to combat the surge of inflammation. The immediateoutcome is likely to be very undramatic and seemingly innocuous. But the drip,drip, drip of such disruptions has long-range damaging effects.If you live your life unconscious of what’s happening to the whole system, youare adhering to the gambling model of health. If you become aware of thedownside of a double cheeseburger with fries, you might swear off such anindulgence, and your body will thank you for it. But temptation is constant andgiving in takes only a minute, not simply with a cheeseburger but with all kindsof fatty, salty, overly sweet, processed, and junk food.The only way to get real is to make a major shift into a healing lifestyle, onethat isn’t chopped up into small temporary choices—even very healthy ones—butrises to the level where the whole system is cared for.WHAT CAN THE HEALING SELF DO?Imagine for a moment two patients, A and B, who feel feverish and go to thedoctor. Patient A encounters a full waiting room and is told that the doctor isrunning late by thirty minutes. In reality, the wait is over an hour, and when Agets to see the doctor, she’s feeling a bit tense and put out. In a businesslikeway, the doctor takes her temperature, does a cursory exam, and writes aprescription for antibiotics.“You might have a low-level infection,” he says. “Let’s see how this works foryou. If you’re catching a cold or the flu, your fever will get worse and thenget better. See you in two weeks. The nurse out front can make an appointment.”This scenario is fairly typical of everyday visits to primary-care physicians,and each of us knows the routine. Nothing A’s doctor told her is untrue oroutside normal practice—she got routine care.Patient B finds an empty waiting room and sees the doctor immediately. He asksabout her fever and wants details about when it started and how badly it mighthave affected her sleep, her mood, her energy level, and her appetite. Heinvestigates to see if B has had similar fevers in the past and, if so, how theywere resolved. Did they go away on their own or were medications necessary? Thisinteraction takes more than a few minutes, but the doctor looks interested andnever impatient. Patient B finds his manner reassuring.“Most of the time this kind of low-grade fever is the symptom of a cold or theflu,” the doctors says. “Over the next few days, call me whenever you feel aneed. Once we monitor what’s going on, we’ll have a better idea of what to do.”The second doctor sounds ideal, but there’s one hitch: he’s a fantasy. Few ifany patients receive the kind of unhurried, sympathetic attention that ourfictitious Patient B encountered—and things aren’t going to change anytime soon.There is certainly a strong reason to consider the medical profession a caringone, but even at the best of times doctor visits involve waiting, being resignedto only ten to fifteen minutes with the doctor, and getting treatment based on asnapshot of the situation.There is an alternative. You can accept the role of the healing self. Considerthe qualities of an ideal doctor, which would include the following:PatienceSympathyAn open mindVigilance over changes in the patient’s conditionClose monitoringDetailed knowledge of the patient’s historyThorough medical knowledge and expertiseOnly the last item on the list is exclusive to the medical profession.Everything else is something you can provide yourself, either through self-careor in conjunction with a good doctor. Certain things like constant monitoringare available only to you (or by being admitted to the hospital). Most of what’son the list are things you are probably doing already, even though you aren’taware of acting as a healer. Maximizing them will be very important, becauseawareness needs to be an everyday habit, even a skill.By the same token, the bad qualities we’d hate to see in a doctor are oftenpresent in how we treat ourselves from day to day. Millions of people approachtheir health with one or more of the following:IndifferenceDenial that pain and other symptoms need attentionWorry and anxietyLack of informationGuessworkUndertaking needless or ineffective treatmentsClearly these are things that everyone wants to avoid, but we fall intoself-defeating responses all the time. We worry needlessly or pretend thatnothing hurts. We guess at what’s wrong and then reach impulsively for somethingwe hope will work—usually this means grabbing a bottle from the medicine cabinetor kitchen cupboard. Most of the time the impulse is temporary, so we go back towaiting and worrying.You are in a position, starting now, to adopt the role of self-healer. By goingdeeper into the power of awareness, you can activate the hidden potential of thehealing system that you already depend upon every day. We hope this all soundsexciting, because some major life changes lie ahead. But first we need to makevery clear what this book is not about.A REALISTIC BASELINEWe won’t show you how to overcome a chronic illness like arthritis, type 1diabetes, or congestive heart failure.We don’t have cures for incurable diseases like Alzheimer’s.We aren’t promising a cure for cancer.Nothing we advise lies outside proven medical practice—we aren’t talking aboutfaith healing, placebos, or magical thinking.Once you have developed symptoms or a full-blown disorder, you must seekqualified medical care.WHERE ARE YOU NOW?Some will be disappointed that this book isn’t about curing a full-blown illnesson your own. But the advantages of the healing self are immense, because youlearn how to consciously remain in a state of well-being that increases for yourentire life. As big as this concept is, healing comes down to personalexperience today, tomorrow, and the day after. To that end, we are asking you topause and take two quizzes. The first quiz will assess where you are now—inother words, your starting point for your healing journey. The second quiz willassess how great your potential is—how far healing can take you.QUIZ #1: WHERE ARE YOU TODAY?For each question, consider your experience in the past month. Mark each itemaccording to how often an experience has occurred, as follows:1 = Not at all or once at most2 = Sometimes3 = Fairly often4 = Often___ I was depressed.___ I felt worried and anxious.___ I had to go to the doctor’s office.___ I was in pain but didn’t go to the doctor’s office.___ A chronic health problem was present.___ I ate the wrong foods, fast food, or junk food.___ I was under pressure.___ I felt stressed out.___ I had trouble getting to sleep.___ I didn’t get enough sleep.___ I didn’t control my weight.___ I had a headache.___ I had a backache.___ My relationships didn’t go well.___ I got seriously angry.___ I neglected exercise and physical activity.___ I had self-doubt or self-esteem issues.___ I felt lonely.___ I felt unloved or uncared for.___ There were troubling family issues.___ I was worried about the future.ASSESSING YOUR ANSWERSThis quiz doesn’t lead to a total score—each individual answer is what we willfocus on. If you have lots of 3 or 4 responses, your life over the last monthhas been a struggle. Most people, however, will have some 3 or 4 answers nomatter how well their lives are going.Hold on to your results, and take the quiz again after you finish reading thisbook. Take it every few days or weekly after you adopt a healing lifestyle. Ifyour answers improve, you have proof and motivation that such a lifestyle reallyworks.QUIZ #2: YOUR HIGHEST POSITIVE EXPERIENCESHealing is a holistic process, and the healing self opens the way for higherexperiences that make life more joyous and meaningful. We want to know how manyhigher experiences you are having now. For each question, consider yourexperience in the past month. Mark each item according to how often anexperience has occurred, as follows:1 = Not at all or once at most2 = Sometimes3 = Fairly often4 = Often___ I felt contented inside.___ I expressed love openly to someone else.___ I felt free and liberated.___ I saw myself without blame or judgment.___ I was appreciated and praised by someone at work or in my family.___ I felt inner peace and tranquility.___ I felt myself to be part of a larger plan or vision.___ I experienced a loving gesture toward me.___ I had a spiritual experience.___ I felt lovingkindness and compassion.___ I forgave someone.___ I forgave myself.___ I let go of something negative from the past.___ I developed an emotional bond with someone.___ I felt blessed.___ I sensed what I’d call a divine or holy presence.___ I was lighthearted.___ My faith in human goodness was affirmed.___ I felt blissful or ecstatic.___ I saw or experienced inner light.___ I experienced pure Being or unbounded awareness.___ I saw the sacredness of another person.___ I meditated, prayed, or did another contemplative practice.___ I felt creatively inspired.ASSESSING YOUR ANSWERSAs before, this quiz doesn’t lead to a total score—each individual answer iswhat we will focus on. If you have lots of 1 or 2 responses, your life over thelast month has probably felt mundane and uninspired. Most people, however, willhave some 1 or 2 answers no matter how fulfilled their lives are—access tohigher experiences is still waiting.As with the first quiz, hold on to your results, and take the quiz again afteryou finish reading this book. Every few days or weekly after you adopt oursuggestions for a healing lifestyle, look at your answers again. If theyimprove, you have proof and added motivation that higher experiences aren’t rareor random. They are accessible through your healing self anytime you want.Now you have a better idea of what getting real about your health actuallyentails. You’ve discovered the concepts that are critical for moving away fromthe gambling model for staying healthy. Realizing that consciousness is the keynow places you on the threshold of transformation. There are many details toexplain, and the following chapters describe the nitty-gritty of our new model.Yet nothing is as important as knowing that the healing self is real. It’s asclose to you as the next breath and as vital as the next heartbeat."},{"pageContent":"2WHO STAYS WELL AND WHO DOESN’T?The beauty of a whole-system approach is its naturalness. All the most basicthings we do to stay alive affect the whole system. We breathe, we eat, we go tosleep. Advanced medical science delves into these processes extensively, and thedeeper the research goes, the more complex eating, breathing, and sleep turn outto be. But this shouldn’t cloud a simple fact: the people who manage to staywell their entire lives, and who enjoy the highest state of wellness, are peoplewho have no trouble getting eight hours of good sleep a night, who eat abalanced nourishing diet that maintains a healthy weight, and who breatheeasily—that is, they are not burdened by stress and anxiety.Millions of us cannot say that we’ve mastered the most basic whole-systemprocesses. Somehow the naturalness of staying well has escaped us. How can thisbe? By analogy, think about a self-driving car. Long dreamed of by engineers,such a car has now become feasible, and its advent has been greeted with bothoptimism and panic. To the optimists, the self-driving car will be a boon tosafety. Equipped with artificial intelligence and sensors that maintain aconstant state of vigilance in 360 degrees, a driverless car would be able todetect potential dangers on the road almost instantly, far quicker than even thebest human driver. But what if these safety mechanisms fail? That’s where thepanic comes in. Being driven into an accident by a machine you aren’tcontrolling feels like a nightmare.In practice, therefore, a self-driving car needs to include a means for thehuman driver to intervene and take control. Judgment calls always occur intraffic situations. Not many of us, at this stage at least, would be willing torelinquish all control to a machine. Possibly we never will, given the risks tolife and limb.Much the same predicament relates to our bodies. Although perfectlyself-regulating in its machinery—a simplistic term but useful in this case—thebody is under dual control. At the outset of this book we mentioned the exampleof breathing. Whether you pay attention or not, you breathe in and outautomatically; it’s a basic survival mechanism. But anytime you want, you canintervene and breathe a different way, faster or slower, deeper or shallower.Because the body operates as a whole system, your interventions aren’t local—adifferent style of breathing could be linked to a panic attack at one extremeand a mindful yoga practice at the other. Which means that every interventionhas the possibility of moving you away from your natural state of wellness.Apparently, millions of people have done just that. The signs are obvious indozens of ways—poor sleep, chronic lifestyle diseases, obesity, anxiety, anddepression head the list. The healing response is compromised by a hugedisruption like pneumonia or polio, but these devastating events are becomingrarer and more curable. The real threat to healing comes from the dailyinterventions we make that have negative or unforeseen consequences; these arethe raindrops that can eventually cause a flood.The healing response holds no judgments; it adapts to every choice you make,positive or negative. Your cells are chemical factories that alter theirproduction line depending on the input you give them, which acts like adirective from upper management. Because everyone’s life is a mixture of goodand bad choices, everything in life must be viewed as either raising your stateof wellness or lowering it. Our cells, all the way down to the genetic level,tolerate our indulgences but are paying the price for them as well.The solution is to use the body’s dual control as a tool of healing. In the mostbasic terms, there are two kinds of healing going on in every person right now.Automatic healing, which everyone inherited in their genes through millions ofyears of evolution.Conscious healing, which covers every opportunity to assist and improveautomatic healing.Any experience is a possible candidate for healing. The simple fact is that aday without any sensation of physical pain doesn’t escape the followingexperiences:Feeling depressed, helpless, or hopelessWorrying about the futureFeeling anxious, fearful, or unsafeBeing stuck in old behaviors and bad habitsLow self-esteemLack of fulfillmentTroubled relationshipsFeeling lonely, shut out, and unappreciatedLeading a life without much purpose or meaningGuilt and shame from old traumas and woundingWho can say that something on this list isn’t afflicting them right now ordidn’t occur in the past? According to a recent survey, one in six Americanadults is reported to be taking psychiatric drugs. Relieving symptoms, as wesaw, doesn’t get at the real cause of a disorder like depression. Research hasattacked the cause of depression through brain scans, to see if a specific areaof the brain is involved; through genetic profiling, to discover if there is aunique “depression gene” or group of genes; and through psychiatric evaluation,hoping that a pattern of behavior leads to the onset of depression.Yet no specific cause has been found along any of these paths. The most acceptedconclusion, in fact, is that each person’s depression is unique, exhibiting anarray of psychological, physiological, and genetic traits. Depression is linkedto personal experience and how you react to it. Reading about bad news in thepaper doesn’t automatically trigger the same reaction in different people, whocan respond with a huge range of reactions from indifference to deep depression.The same variability applies to anxiety, which is why one person collectsspiders as an enjoyable hobby and another person is deathly afraid of them. Areyou in a troubled relationship? Does your life seem to lack purpose and meaning?It’s not the fault of medical treatment that such a huge range of perceptions isuntreatable. These causes of suffering have no drug cure; they don’t even fitthe standard medical model of disease, which stubbornly insists on physicalchanges as the “real” cause of illness.As a counter to this bias, impressive studies have shown that invisiblesubjective states can have a powerful effect on the body. For example,researchers at the University of Texas Medical School looked at mortality ratesamong a group of men and women who had received open heart surgery, includingheart bypass and replacement of the aortic valve. If you take the routinemedical approach, the reason someone dies six months after open heart surgerywhile someone else doesn’t must come down to a physical difference. But the teamheaded by Dr. Thomas Oxman took an unorthodox approach. They asked thesepatients two questions about their social situation: Do you participateregularly in organized social groups? Do you draw strength and comfort from yourreligion or spiritual faith?These are simple yes-or-no questions, and when assessing the answers, theresearchers excluded the typical risk factors for dying after heart surgery,including age, severity of the disease, and severity of a previous heart attack.With these factors zeroed out, the findings were startling:A person who answered Yes to both questions had less than a 5 percent chance ofbeing dead six months after their surgery.A person who answered No to both questions had between a 20 percent and 25percent chance of being dead six months after the surgery.Overall, being socially supported and taking comfort from your faith makes youseven times more likely to survive major heart surgery than someone who hasneither of those things in their life. This outcome is almost certainly the onlysevenfold difference in any risk for heart mortality, even bad cholesterollevels, high blood pressure, and a genetic history of heart attacks in thefamily. While asking somebody if they belong to social groups like a club orchurch is an objective measure, the question about religious or spiritual faithis entirely about how the person feels.How you feel is entirely subjective, but just as important, it’s an activity inconsciousness, a small indicator of your self-awareness. The support forconscious healing couldn’t be more obvious.MARGE’S STORY: AWARENESS COMES FIRSTMuch of the healing response remains a mystery. No one really knows—or canpredict in all cases—why one person gets sick and another doesn’t. The hiddenreasons exist in a shadow zone beyond the physical.Some people provide living proof that consciousness-based healing, as a way oflife, works. Consider an elderly woman named Marge, who proudly remained activeand self-sufficient until she was ninety-one. Marge still lived alone in herapartment, cooked for herself, continued to drive her car, and hired a housecleaner only for heavier chores. Marge’s health was unusually good, in thatcompared with an average of seven prescription drugs taken by seniors over ageseventy, she was on just one medication, for high blood pressure.In an aging population, more people will be eager to know Marge’s secret. Is itgood genes for longevity? To date, no definitive research has clearly found sucha gene or group of genes (although there are strong clues, as you’ll see a bitlater). Typically, if your parents both survived to eighty, your lifespan isexpected to be three years longer than average, not a great advantage.As a statistic, Marge did have certain advantages. She was born into awell-to-do family in Cincinnati, which meant that she had good medical care, notthat this would have saved anyone from serious childhood illness in 1920, whenshe was born—antibiotics, for example, still lay in the future. She was luckynot to contract tuberculosis, polio, or scarlet fever. An absence of seriouschildhood diseases is associated with longer life.But in her mind, none of these factors was the deciding one.“I had a difficult marriage to an artist in New York,” she recalls. “We wereboth strong willed, and we fought a lot. Most of my energy was spent on himrather than on my three sons. I’m not proud of that, and as much as I loved myboys, I could be harsh with them.”Looking back, Marge realizes now that it took decades for just one psychologicaltrait—her anger—to have drastic effects on her life.“I divorced when my boys were barely teenagers. One went off to boarding school,and the other two chose to live with their father, who was so angry with me ingeneral that he fought to keep all our money for himself and his sons. SuddenlyI was completely alone and bewildered over how my life could be overturned sodrastically.”Marge fought with depression. It became obvious that her sons had been scarredby her hot temper growing up. “I forgot what made me so mad the minute thingscalmed down, but they didn’t. They actually became afraid of me, their mother.”Up to this point in her story, nothing would suggest that Marge would livelonger than average—perhaps the reverse, if her depression had become chronicand affected her health status. Then a single factor changed her life—Margebecame a Buddhist. To her, this decision created an inner transformation.“I found a Zen master through a friend,” she recalls. “I can’t even tell you whyI gave Buddhism a try, but once I started to meditate, two things happened.First, by becoming calmer, my bad temper wasn’t triggered by every little thing.Second, I saw something real about myself. Deep down, I was very anxious aboutbeing alone. All the drama I kicked up was a tactic to get people to payattention to me, and that defended me from how alone I really felt.”Today, at ninety-six, Marge lives in a retirement home at the lowest level oftheir assisted-living program, which means that somebody looks in on her severaltimes a day and helps her bathe. Her medications haven’t increased. She goesdown to lunch and dinner on her own and takes excursions with friends to eat outonce a week. Two things only are areas of difficulty.“My hip replacement, which I got in my seventies, has begun to wear out, so I’vedecided to use a wheelchair rather than walk a long distance. And my sons arestill wary of me. Having an angry mother isn’t something they have been able toovercome easily. That’s the only sorrow that lingers in my mind. Otherwise, I’mat peace.”Marge was fortunate to begin meditating so long ago, because the late 1970s wasreally the first time mainstream medicine began to produce studies showing thatmeditation was associated with positive health outcomes such as lower bloodpressure. “Relaxation” was the recognized tag word for other benefits, such asreduced stress and anxiety. Skip ahead forty years, and meditation became morepopular and accepted. Today, the whole-system approach dissolves all theartificial barriers between mind and body. The realization that every experiencehas a mental result and a physical result is gathering greater force every day.Take a simple fact, that grief lowers a person’s immune response. Grief is adrastic mental event, a source of psychological pain. When someone is stillseriously grief stricken six months after a death in the family, which occurs inabout 10 percent of bereavements, their condition is known as traumatic grief.Studies on those who suffer from traumatic grief indicate “global impairment” isvery likely, meaning in layman’s terms that almost anything can go wrong withtheir health.A study of 150 widows and widowers, for example, found that “the presence oftraumatic grief symptoms approximately 6 months after the death of the spousepredicted such negative health outcomes as cancer, heart trouble, high bloodpressure, suicidal thoughts, and changes in eating habits at 13- or 25-monthfollow-up.” (Rudy remembers that after his father died at the age of forty-five,when Rudy was seventeen, it took years for his mother to overcome her grief andlive a normal life again.) If you absorb what this all means, certain people,for unknown reasons, are hit harder by grief than others. The natural recoverytime for grief doesn’t heal them, and up to two years later, they are at riskfor all kinds of disorders, both mental and physical. Other studies have foundsimilar results relating to disturbed sleep, low self-esteem, and sad mood.Traumatic grief throws into high gear the power of the mind-body connection.Although medical science can tell us many things on the physical side aboutcancer and heart disease—and going deeper can even spot the chemical imbalancesthat might show up in someone who suffers from traumatic grief—there is no causethat triggers this kind of long-lasting grief, no knowledge about why thehealing system failed, and little understanding about the purpose and meaning ofgrief in the first place. (Other mammals do not appear to grieve, with suspectedexceptions like elephants and domesticated dogs. If a deer is shot by a hunterin a herd of deer, the rest of the herd is disturbed briefly before going backto normal grazing.)The italicized words in the last paragraph—cause, why, purpose, meaning—point toan undeniable fact. Humans live for a purpose, and when the purpose isdamaged—your beloved spouse dies—grief can make life seem meaningless. Everycell in the body gets the message in chemical form. The chemicals are thephysical evidence of grief, but the loss of meaning isn’t chemical—it’s human inthe larger sense. As painful as grief is, if someone felt no grief at the lossof a spouse, that would be considered strange—some might say behind their backsthat they are heartless, another very human word.INVISIBLE HEALINGThe healing self is the part of us that deals with invisible causes, the why ofwho gets sick and who doesn’t, and the purpose and meaning of being alive.Healing isn’t mystical just because it’s invisible. Someone who has neverthought about the healing response will in all likelihood want to be happy, andone key to overall happiness is feeling loved. Is it really possible that yourcells can feel loved, too? Before reacting to what seems like a ridiculousassertion, consider the following study.Yale researchers looked at 119 men and 40 women who received the most accuratetest for detecting blockages in the coronary arteries, known as coronaryangiography. (It’s an anxiety-provoking procedure for many people, althoughrelatively noninvasive. Typically a narrow catheter inserted in the forearm isthreaded into the arteries of the heart. A dye is injected that will show up theinterior of the artery using a CT or MRI scan. In this way the size of thevessel’s opening or blockage can be seen directly.) Patients who told theresearchers that they felt loved and emotionally supported generally exhibitedless blockage in their coronary arteries, the main cause of heart attacks andstrokes.There are other risk factors that predict the presence of heart disease, such asdiet, exercise, smoking, and family history, but even when these were taken outof the equation, the feeling of being loved and emotionally supported was apredictor of who would have more or less arterial blockage. A study of 131 womenin Sweden came to the same conclusion. But perhaps the most striking researchwas based on asking a single question. A team at Case Western Reserve Universitysurveyed 10,000 married men with no history of angina pectoris, the typicalchest pain associated with heart disease (although heart attacks can occurwithout this previous symptom).As expected, the men who scored highest on the familiar risk factors for heartdisease, such as high cholesterol, hypertension, and older age, were more thantwenty times more likely to develop angina over the next five years. Then theresearchers asked a simple question: “Does your wife show you her love?” The menwho answered Yes were less likely to develop angina even when they had highscores on known risk factors. The reverse was also true. A man with high riskfactors who said his wife didn’t show him her love was almost twice as likely todevelop angina.As with traumatic grief, taking the mind-body connection seriously is enough toexplode two of the most common assumptions driving medical care:1. Healing is physical and happens automatically.2. When the automatic healing response breaks down, the only thing a doctor cando is to intervene with drugs or surgery.From opposite extremes of the emotional spectrum, love and grief cross theboundary between mental and physical. Heart disease is treatable with drugs andsurgery, but these can prove ineffective in someone who feels isolated, lonely,or unloved. The unpredictable physical effects of traumatic grief aren’ttreatable by drugs and surgery—after all, you can’t give a pill for everythingthat might go wrong thirteen to twenty-five months from the onset of grief. Byignoring the healing self, a physician in everyday practice has left out a keypart of health and healing.BASIC AWARENESSTaking everything we’ve said so far, the benefits of conscious healing are therefor the asking. But for many people conscious simply means that you aren’tasleep or knocked out. They have the same potential to be aware as the mostadvanced yogi or monk, but no one taught them how to use this ability. Takethree people and sit them in the same room, then ask them what they are awareof. You’ll receive random answers that won’t necessarily overlap. One person isaware of a smell in the room, another of the wallpaper, the height of theceiling, and so on, depending on what is being noticed at the moment. Lesslikely is that one of them will be aware of an inner state—thoughts, moods,sensations. Only if you blatantly change the environment, like turning up thetemperature to eighty-five degrees, will everyone be likely to mention the samething.Spiritual practices in yoga and other Eastern traditions are actually abouthoning random awareness to make it sharper, turning an innate ability into askill. Before they are aware of anything “out there” or “in here,” those whohave trained their awareness will universally say that they are self-aware. Theaverage person is also self-aware. You can’t have a sense of “I” without it. Butself-awareness is only one piece of the swirling, random, unpredictable activitygoing on in the mind.Awareness skills don’t have to be associated with spirituality or the East. Theycan be used to improve your quality of life. That’s where the healing selfbecomes practical in any situation, at any moment of the day, and with anyreligious background. It monitors the signals that indicate your immediate stateof well-being, here and now. These levels include the following:Knowing how you feel physically. This involves being open and sensitive to thesignals your body is sending you.Knowing how to interpret these signals. This involves acceptance of your body asyour greatest ally, not a source of distress.Knowing what is happening inside you emotionally. This involves giving up ondenial, wishful thinking, fear, and repressing your emotions.When someone casually asks, “How are you?” we usually give an equally casualanswer, but the healing self takes the question seriously. By knowing what isactually going on, you are beginning the process of self-healing. A wearabledevice can buzz you when your heart rate jumps, your blood pressure rises, oryour breathing becomes erratic; these are useful indicators, certainly. But onlyyou can respond to the signals and begin the healing.As a practical example of basic awareness, here’s what you can do almosteffortlessly at work.MINDFUL AT WORK: SEVEN SELF-AWARE THINGS YOU CAN DO RIGHT NOWADOPT ANY OR ALL OF THE FOLLOWING TIPS TO COUNTER THE INVISIBLE NEGATIVEINFLUENCES THAT AFFLICT THE TYPICAL WORKPLACE.1. In Eastern traditions, awareness should be one-pointed, which means that youkeep your attention in a state of relaxed focus. Don’t multitask, which dividesyour attention and has been proved to reduce efficiency at work.2. To keep your focus relaxed instead of tense, do what you can to work in anarea that’s quiet and relatively free of interruptions. So that your coworkerswon’t feel that you are unavailable, take time twice an hour to circulate, be incontact, and let it be known that you want personal interactions. In this way,your alone time is likely to be more respected.3. Awareness should be in the now. To stay in the present moment, don’t letsmall demands pile up. Immediately take care of anything that takes five minutesor less. If you make this a habit, your time management will improve, sometimesdramatically, and you won’t get to the end of the day complaining that youdidn’t have enough time to do everything you needed to do.4. Be mindful of your body and its needs. At a minimum get up out of your chair,stretch, and move around at least once an hour.5. Be mindful of your core or center. When you feel frazzled, find a quiet placewhere you can close your eyes, take some deep breaths, and become centeredagain. Some people find that centering works better if they put their attentionin the region of the heart.6. Remember to breathe, because breath connects many body functions, includingheart rate, blood pressure, and the stress response. At least once an hour, do afew 10-count breaths, as follows: breathe in to a count of 4, hold for a secondas you relax into the feeling of the in breath, then breathe out to a count of6. (Make sure your pace feels comfortable, not so slow that you gasp after a fewbreaths.) Typically, your breathing rate will slow down from 14 breaths perminute to 8, with an accompanying feeling of calmer mind.7. Be mindful of your ultimate purpose, which isn’t to meet a deadline but tocreate a day with happiness in it. Psychologists have found that people who leadthe happiest lives follow a strategy of having happy days. Whatever makes yougenuinely smile counts as a happy experience.These same practices are also effective outside the workplace. Yet we typicallyspend over one-third of every weekday at work, and sometimes far more (theaverage white-collar worker who brings work home is estimated to spend sixtyhours or more per week). It can be a challenge to remain self-aware underworkplace pressures and demands. But the benefits are considerable—if you canstay centered and focused without being frazzled by the mental “noisiness” thatcrowds into a typical workday, you will be genuinely meditating in the midst ofaction, one of the primary goals in every wisdom tradition. Leaving spiritualissues aside, being self-aware is a major component of a healing lifestyle."},{"pageContent":"3NOTHING IS BETTER THAN LOVEThe research showing that people who feel loved are more likely to enjoyhealthier hearts than those who feel unloved is important. It puts real sciencebehind something we all know personally: Love is the healthiest of all emotions.It sustains life at a level of trust, joy, and compassion unrivaled by anythingelse. A great poet from India, Rabindranath Tagore, declared that love was nomere emotion but a cosmic force. To be raised in a loveless household is thecruelest fate a child can endure, as the following story poignantly illustrates.Patrick, now in his early thirties, didn’t believe that he had sufferedemotional damage as a child. He only knew that when his mother said she lovedhim, he couldn’t expect her to hug him or even touch him. Her distance was aconstant from an early age.“I was hospitalized when I was five to get my tonsils taken out,” Patrickrecalls. “It was Valentine’s Day, and I was in a ward with other kids. Theirmothers came by with cards and candy, but my mother didn’t. But that’s the funnything. What I remember is turning my face to the wall and holding a pillow overmy ears so I couldn’t hear the other kids and their moms. I carried a grudgearound for years, and then a peculiar thing happened. One day my mother and Iwere having lunch, and my curiosity got the best of me. I asked her why shenever came to see me in the hospital, and you know what she said?“She told me she arrived a bit late when visiting hours started, and she foundme curled up in the bed crying. She comforted me, she said, but that part Idon’t remember, only the feeling of being alone and forgotten.”Young children, as many psychologists attest, form powerful beliefs about theirupbringing that don’t always match the facts. It has taken medical science along time to stop believing that only facts, as measured by medical tests anddiagnoses, are the sole component of being healthy. Beliefs matter, even whenthose beliefs are totally subjective—we all believe the stories we tellourselves. This story begins with the messages our parents send in childhood.Patrick’s parents sent a message that told him he was on his own. Being aloofand unaffectionate themselves, they treated this as normal. But children need tofeel closely connected to a parent who is loving and protective. This is anevolutionary trait millions of years old. In a famous experiment baby monkeyswere separated from their mothers and soon became restless, anxious, andinsecure in their behavior. When given an artificial mother constructed out ofwire mesh with padding around the torso, the babies immediately attachedthemselves to it, clinging for comfort.In humans the effects of poor bonding are just as devastating, even though wehave superior abilities to adapt even to the worst conditions. In Patrick’scase, believing that he was on his own led to what is known psychologically as“loose attachment.” In layman’s terms he didn’t feel safe, valued, andprotected. In his mind, true or not, if he was in trouble no one would be therefor him. That’s an exaggerated, black-and-white notion—no doubt his parentswould have been shocked to hear it—but kids’ ideas tend to be like this, basedon indelible emotional experience.“I was lucky in a way,” Patrick recalls with a faint smile. “I got very good atbeing independent. Everyone commented on how I was like a little adult even whenI was seven or eight. I was proud of it. I became a superachiever because that’swhat adults do, and this went on for a long time.”When he started dating in his teens Patrick didn’t fill the hole in his heart;he had no idea how to. Getting close to someone felt alien, in fact. Keepingtrue to his story that he had to look out for himself, he was motivated mainlyby his growing sexual urges. Girls tended to go along with this, and if theystarted to want more and the relationship verged on getting serious, Patrickfound excuses to start a fight or act so cold that the girl, bewildered andhurt, walked away.By the time he got to college, studying computer science, Patrick’s isolation,emotionally speaking, was baked in. His ability to take care of himself wasunquestioned. What he didn’t realize was this: He took care of himself becausehe believed that nobody else would. He had no model for a nurturing, protectinglove.The story could have stopped there. Fortunately for him, it didn’t. In graduateschool he met a girl, and she was different. Patrick’s totally rationalworldview collided with love at first sight.“To be honest,” he says, “I thought those words were just clichés. The firsttime I met Fran, I saw her for only a second outside the department while shewas talking to some friends, but I was riveted. There was just something abouther. I got up my nerve and introduced myself. She was friendly and smiled.Nothing else happened, but I went home, and Fran was all I could think about.“She agreed to go out with me, and things just unfolded from there. Withoutwarning I had become a fool in love. I died inside if she had a change of plansand couldn’t see me. I kicked myself every day to make sure it was true—I’dfallen in love with the most beautiful woman in the world.”Despite the undoubted experience of falling in love at first sight, and abundantevidence that love creates powerful physiological changes, the whole phenomenonremains mysterious. Do chemical changes in neural activity mean that Patrick’sbrain fell in love, or did he? In a whole-system approach the two areinseparable. Where healing is concerned, there are some deep issues that crossthe mind-body boundary:How and why does love promote physical health?When infatuation turns into lasting love, what can this do for our well-being?If love becomes deep enough, does it open the door for higher consciousness?The human experience testifies that love has a unique power in all these areas,and if we investigate deeply enough, there are answers for why this is so.LOVE REACHES DEEP AND FARWe live in an age in which such an overwhelming experience, one that transformssomeone’s entire being, is explained as biochemistry. But even withsophisticated brain scans and measurements of hormone levels and the like,what’s missing is the meaning of falling in love. That meaning is all embracing.In the terms we’re using, love is a whole-system event. The studies thatindicate how coronary arteries respond to love, or the lack of it, are only thetip of the iceberg. We carry a deep evolutionary imprint at a genetic level. Toquote psychologist Barbara Fredrickson, “Somewhere in our brains we carry a mapof our relationships. It is our mother’s lap, our best friend’s holding hand,our lover’s embrace—all these we carry within ourselves when we are alone. Justknowing that these are there to hold us if we fall gives us a sense of peace.”What’s most significant is that even when someone is alone, sitting quietly andpassively, they aren’t really alone. Inside they carry a map constructed fromall the relationships experienced since infancy. This, too, is a whole-systemphenomenon. Each moment in a relationship is a tiny piece being fitted into thewhole map as it changes and shifts.To see how this works, give the first answer that comes to your mind when youread the following statements:My mother loved me enough. YES NO I’m glad I had the father I had. YES NO Itrust where I am right now. YES NO My current relationship is in a very goodplace. YES NO I have a good friend I’m closely bonded with. YES NO I like beingemotional. YES NO I tend to show how I feel. YES NO Others feel safe confidingin me. YES NO I am a nurturer. YES NO I feel as if I belong. YES NOThere are no right or wrong responses to these statements. But if you answerquickly without pausing to give what you believe is the “right” answer, yourresponses come directly from your inner map of love and relationship. You may behappy or shocked by your responses, and we will be showing you how to improveyour inner map in many ways. Here just be aware of how an inner image youprobably never think about is affecting you, not incidentally but as the storyof who you are, involving the whole person.A whole-system approach would predict that love, or the lack of it, would havemultiple effects, and it does. In terms of biochemistry, a number of significantchanges take place when someone falls in love. Levels of brain neurochemicalssuch as dopamine and serotonin go up, together with hormones like cortisol andfollicle stimulating hormone. These are the earliest changes of falling in love.Ironically, the last two are indicative of stress caused by the arousal betweenthe sexes. In other words, there’s a chemical basis for why romantic love bringsjoy and pain. Shakespeare intuited a fact of neuroscience in A Midsummer Night’sDream with the famous line “The course of true love never did run smooth.” Evenmore intriguing is that testosterone levels go down in men and up in women as weage, leading to changes in temperament that render two members of the oppositesex just a bit more alike.Even more far-reaching are the possible effects of love on the healing response.How well your immune system works is a crucial factor, and it is well documentedthat emotions change the immune system. Drs. Janice Kiecolt-Glaser and RonaldGlaser looked at couples who had been married for a long time, on averageforty-two years, and found that those who constantly argued had a decreasedimmune response. If this finding seems to be a sad comment on older marriages,the same effect occurs very quickly, too. A study of couples who were on theirhoneymoon showed that newlyweds who showed hostile and negative behavior whenasked to discuss the topic of marital troubles had a decreased immune response.By now, having read this far, you won’t be surprised that the body responds topositive and negative emotions. But the speed of this response may stillsurprise you. A pioneering study by psychologist David McClelland and his teamat Harvard asked students to watch a film on the work being done in the slums ofCalcutta by Mother Teresa, the Catholic nun who gained worldwide fame by caringfor the poorest abandoned children. (As a control, a second group of studentswatched a neutral documentary on another subject.) On average the students whowatched the Mother Teresa film showed increased levels of antibodies on thespot, along with decreased measures of stress like reduced blood pressure.This finding is impressive for showing how the body responds here and now toemotional experiences, but McClelland wondered why some of these studentsactually had a decreased immune response to watching Mother Teresa’s good works.As a follow-up, all of the original study group were shown a photo of a couplesitting on a bench by a river. When asked to write a story about the couple,some students described them as loving, supportive, and respectful, while otherswrote very different stories in which the couple was unhappy, manipulative, anddeceitful. The students who showed the biggest decrease in immune response inthe first study happened to be the same ones who wrote the negative stories inthe follow-up. The implication is powerful: ingrained ideas we carry aroundinside us wind up defining what relationships are all about, even when thoseideas aren’t aligned with the truth. They forcefully impose their owninterpretation instead.Going back to Patrick, he and Fran had entered the first phase of romantic love,which is infatuation. In that state, everything about love is so powerful thatreality changes. Your beloved is the most beautiful person in the world. In thepresence of the beloved you have entered paradise. Under love’s spell, the wholeworld looks brighter and is inhabited by wonderful people. To a strictrationalist, these are illusions. And in fact, infatuation is temporary; itsintoxication wanes, giving way, if the person is lucky, to more stable stages oflove. In these later stages other neurochemicals, such as endorphins (naturalopiates), oxytocin, and vasopressin follow predictable patterns in response tothe back-and-forth of lovers. But is falling in love just a set of chemicalexperiences?There’s an important factor rationalists don’t consider. Falling in love gives amore realistic view of life by placing us in contact with our true self. We fallaccidentally and temporarily into a state of expanded awareness that is exaltedby the great mystic poets, who connect intense human love with divine love. Thebeloved Persian poet Rumi exults:> Oh God, I have discovered love!> > How marvelous, how good, how beautiful it is!…> > I offer my salutation> > To the spirit of passion that aroused and excited this whole universe> > And all it contains.There is no doubt that love can expand into this higher dimension, where thewhole person is healed in the most profound way. The connection between body andmind is undeniable, but that’s also true in an everyday instance of falling inlove. The following experiences pertain to love wherever it is felt:Feeling renewedBonding at the level of the heartFeeling protected and safeEmotions of joy, exhilaration, and upliftmentA more open heart, extending empathy and sympathy to othersFeeling physically lighterSensing energy or light coursing through the bodyThere’s no distinction here between what a saint would describe and a Patrickwho discovers love for the first time. He and Fran didn’t last as a couplebeyond a year. Like everyone who has passed through the stage of infatuation,they had ego needs that weren’t the same. Settling down to love whilenegotiating the demands of “I, me, and mine” poses its own challenges. ButPatrick learned the most valuable lesson of his life, that he was lovable and,along with this, that he could love.Humans are not biological robots. We live for meaning, for the personal value ofevery experience. The body metabolizes our experiences and sends the message toevery cell, while the mind, in its own domain, processes experience in terms ofsensations, images, thoughts, and feelings. Nothing fuses the whole-systemeffects of love and non-love like the human heart, which needs to be understoodas more than a physical organ.A WHOLE-SYSTEM VISION OF THE HEARTThe heart offers one of the best examples of how the whole-system approach makesthe most sense. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in this country forboth men and women, which makes it a primary target for a healing lifestyle.Your heart is very responsive to how you feel emotionally and physically.There’s almost no choice you make that your heart doesn’t know about.Yet very few people are really aware of this. Until they feel an alarmingsymptom like chest pain, they might think about heart health mainly in terms ofcardio at the gym. Other disorders, such as breast cancer, attract morepublicity and generate more fear among women, but statistically, this perceptiondoesn’t conform to the actual situation. Out of total deaths among Americanwomen each year, breast cancer accounts for 1 in 31, while deaths from heartdisease are 1 in 3. Depression and anxiety are associated with increased riskfor exercise-induced heart attacks. In contrast, greater levels of positiveemotions are associated with decreased risk. Being heart healthy is important.But in our whole-system approach, the physical organ is only part of the story.The other part has to do with one’s attitudes and outlook.Even if someone holds that a purely physical approach is adequate, that side ofthe equation isn’t completely well understood. For example, a study in the early1950s looked at the hearts of young soldiers who were casualties in the Koreanconflict. America was just becoming aware of an epidemic of heart attacksafflicting men between the ages of forty and sixty. No one knew what was causingthis alarming spike in premature heart attacks. The fashion for mainly blamingcholesterol hadn’t yet begun, and there were no drugs like cholesterol-loweringstatins to prevent heart disease.Into this baffling environment, the hearts of young soldiers told a grim story.A high percentage of them displayed considerable plaque blocking their coronaryarteries. Plaque is hardened fat mixed with minerals and caked blood that canshut off the heart’s own oxygen supply. When an artery is strangulated, theheart muscle goes into convulsions, entering into a full-blown heart attack. Itwas assumed that plaque buildup took decades, gradually increasing the risk ofheart failure.However, these were men in their early twenties, and their arteries weresometimes blocked as badly as older men who suffered from heart disease. How didthis happen? Just as mysteriously, why did the heart wait until a man was fortybefore a heart attack occurred? These questions remain unanswered today. Therelationship between arterial plaque and all the possible factors that mightcause it—diet, blood fats, stress, genetics, and microscopic changes in thewalls of the coronary blood vessel—is extremely complicated.The most obvious fact is that neither the soldiers nor the doctors who gave thema physical checkup had a clue that something serious was going on. (The adventof sophisticated tests like angiography lay decades in the future.) The typicalchest pain associated with heart disease, known as angina pectoris, generallyshows up late in the game, and it’s also possible to have blocked arteries withno pain—in such cases, a heart attack occurs out of the blue. A healinglifestyle needs to be followed whether pain exists or not.Even with so many open questions, once heart disease has been diagnosed, after abrief visit with a cardiologist, a battery of tests, the typical first step is aprescription drug to combat high cholesterol or elevated blood pressure. Lipservice is paid to lifestyle changes, sometimes not even that. A patient’smotivation to pursue diet and exercise generally isn’t strong in the firstplace. A lifetime of settled habits is hard to turn around. If the patient’scondition continues to worsen, some kind of surgical procedure is in the offing.The two most popular interventions are angioplasty and coronary artery bypassgraft. Here’s a thumbnail sketch of the “simplest” intervention, angioplasty,which in the United States is performed more than 600,000 times annually. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------ANGIOPLASTY: MORE DOWNSIDE THAN UPSIDE?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------WHAT IS IT? Angioplasty involves inserting a tiny balloon into a blocked arteryof the heart to expand the artery. The theory is that by opening up the artery,better blood flow will be achieved to the heart, decreasing the risk of a heartattack. Routinely a wire-mesh stent (a short, narrow tube) is inserted to keepthe artery open after surgery. The relatively low risk of angioplasty helped tofuel a dramatic increase from 133,000 procedures in 1986 to more than 1 millionannually by the 2000s, leading to a $100 billion industry today when you includeheart bypass surgery. As with all surgical interventions, however, angioplastyhas pros and cons.PROS: The intervention is not severe physically, involving a tiny wire overwhich a balloon is slid into the artery. Many times, one has no choice but tohave this surgery for survival—after a heart attack, for example.Angioplasty is quick and not terribly uncomfortable.After a night of observation in the hospital, recovery is rapid. Patientsgenerally resume their normal lifestyle.The main purpose of angioplasty, to make heart patients feel better by relievingchest pain or offering psychological relief from anxiety, is often achieved.CONS: Angioplasty doesn’t cure the underlying disease, which continues toprogress. The procedure must often be repeated, and stents replaced.Significant extension of life expectancy is not generally the case, especiallyin older patients. (A strong exception in extreme circumstances is with patientswho have recently suffered a heart attack.) The first clinical trials ofangioplasty, in the early 1990s, revealed no survival benefit of electiveangioplasty as compared with medication.The serious immediate risk is that arterial plaque may be dislodged by theballoon, leading potentially to a heart attack (or a stroke if the stent hasbeen placed in a blocked carotid artery in the neck), occurring in 1 to 2percent of procedures. Arteries can rupture if the balloon is inflated too much.Various possibilities of infection are present.Angioplasty is expensive, with costs varying widely. The cost is often not worththe results. A 2008 presentation at the annual conference of the American HeartAssociation (AHA) concluded that angioplasty relieves chest pain in some heartpatients but “at a cost generally considered to be prohibitive as a routineinitial management strategy.” Despite this conclusion, more than 1 millionAmericans receive heart stents every year.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- A far more serious intervention, heart bypass surgery, involves putting thepatient on an external pump to maintain circulation while the heart is beingoperated on. This increases all the risks just covered with angioplasty and iseven more expensive. We won’t go into detail except to offer some highlights:• Heart bypass surgery is more painful, takes longer for complete recovery, andstill doesn’t significantly increase life expectancy except in specialized caseswhere the primary coronary artery is severely blocked.• Even then, because few patients heed the advice to improve their lifestyle,plaque can begin to damage the grafted blood vessel in a matter of a few months.(The first patient to successfully receive a bypass graft in 1960 was relievedof his angina symptoms for just one year.)• The inventors of the procedure predicted, wrongly, that bypass surgery wouldbe a rare intervention, useful in patients with imminent risk of heart failure.At present, however, more than half a million coronary artery bypass surgeriesare performed in this country every year.Of the many cons involving angioplasty and heart bypass surgery, the one thatstands out is the first: the underlying disease isn’t cured. In the 1980s,pioneering studies by Dr. Dean Ornish at Harvard Medical School conclusivelyshowed that positive lifestyle changes can do more than prevent heart disease;they can heal it. Ornish’s program of diet, exercise, meditation, and stressreduction, then considered revolutionary, actually opened up clogged coronaryarteries, the first success in any form in reversing heart disease.A lifestyle-based approach remains the only proven way to reverse the plaquethat lines the coronary arteries in people at high risk for heart attacks. Theinclusion of meditation in the program was considered daring and controversialat the time—the medical profession still harbored the prejudice that meditationwas an esoteric Eastern religious practice and therefore had nothing to do with“real” medicine. Now it’s become accepted therapy to recommend meditation forhigh blood pressure, anxiety, insomnia, and other disorders. But the originalOrnish program was absolutely strict, demanding adherence to stringent dietaryrules. For example, one rule limited all fat intake to, at most, a couple oftablespoons a day.For the vast majority of people who have not been diagnosed with heart diseaseor suffered a heart attack, the search for an ideal lifestyle, one that healsand not simply prevents, remains open ended. Dr. Ornish has published many booksand articles that explore healing in body-mind terms. Medicine will continue tocompartmentalize mind and body, but as individuals seeking healing, we can’tafford to. The original lifestyle research broke down the wall separating mindand body. Without them, the whole-system revolution couldn’t have taken place.The emotional states associated with the heart include some that every lifewould benefit from:Empathy, which makes us feel what someone else is feelingCompassion, which motivates us to extend lovingkindnessForgiveness, which wipes the slate clean of old grievances and woundingSacrifice, which allows us to put someone else’s good above our ownDevotion, which inspires reverence for higher valuesNone of these states is a term in cardiology, yet they have medicalconsequences. In the next chapter, we’ll discover how recent breakthroughs aretransforming matters of the heart. But here we want to reinforce the healingvalue of love. People thrive when they feel loved and languish when they don’t.Love increases one’s sense of self-esteem, which leads to taking better care ofoneself. Love also alleviates stress, anxiety, and depression, which reduceschronic inflammation and risk for many age-related disorders, such as heartdisease, diabetes, and Rudy’s specialty, Alzheimer’s disease. Love is a state ofawareness, not a lifestyle choice. Ultimately what counts aren’t the choices youmake but the consciousness that keeps those choices going in a constant state ofhealing."},{"pageContent":"4LIFELINE TO THE HEARTThe fact that emotions play a part in heart disease is only one piece in acomplex picture. Where the common cold has a single cause, the rhinovirus,coronary heart disease (CHD) doesn’t; it is surrounded by a cloud of riskfactors, no one of them playing the leading role. Two people can develop heartdisease or escape it while seemingly facing the same risks. This may surpriseyou, because in a word association game, the first word most people would comeup with when thinking about heart attacks is cholesterol. The campaign toprevent heart disease expends billions of dollars on drugs that lowercholesterol levels in the blood. In the face of a nondrug program that actuallyreverses CHD, pioneered by Ornish and still viable, the proportion of people whoturn to drugs instead is overwhelmingly high. Our aim is to inspire you topursue a healing lifestyle, but people are habituated to depending on doctorsand drugs almost without thinking. In the case of CHD, fixating on cholesterolhas never been the whole solution because it doesn’t fully address a complexdisorder.The cloud of risk factors surrounding CHD illustrates perfectly the hugeadvantage of a whole-system approach. If your heart is responding to how youlead your life, including your relationships and your emotional life, keepingyour heart healthy should be all encompassing. Let’s begin by sketching in howthe cloud of risks came to be formed. As we mentioned in the last chapter, oneof the great mysteries in medical history was the epidemic of premature heartattacks that struck America in the 1950s. Heart disease was traditionallyconsidered fairly uncommon. At the turn of the century one of the leadingsurgeons in the country, William Osler at Johns Hopkins Medical School, declaredthat a physician in general practice would be likely to encounter a case ofangina once a year. Jump ahead to the 1950s and doctors saw patients,predominantly men, complaining of chest pain on a weekly or daily basis. In1900, pneumonia was the leading cause of death in the United States, a time whenthe average life expectancy was forty-seven. By 1930 heart disease had reachednumber one, where it has stayed ever since, and life expectancy was sixty.What happened in between? The usual explanation is that people were livinglonger and heart disease rises sharply with age. With longer lifespans, adisease that was always prevalent was being unmasked. Better sanitation hadplayed a major part in allowing people to live longer, and the germ theory ofinfectious diseases led to better prevention. Even when infectious diseases weremassively reduced by the introduction of antibiotics, especially penicillin, noone anticipated that deaths from heart attacks among men ages forty to sixty,the range considered premature, would climb to alarming heights after World WarII, resulting in an epidemic that reached its peak in the mid-1960s. Since then,deaths from heart attacks and strokes have steadily declined even though ourlife expectancy has kept growing.A CLOUD OF RISKSThe steady decline in deaths from heart attacks was not simply the result ofcontrolling cholesterol. The most important factors can be quickly summarized:• Many heart attacks were caused by infection of the heart (acute endocarditis),which could be detected with blood tests or echocardiograms and treated withantibiotics. Some researchers argue that this factor played the leading role indecreased heart attack deaths.• Better treatment in hospitals raised survival rates after someone suffered aheart attack.• In a combination of the above, patients with detected heart infections couldbe treated in the hospital, a much better environment for survival in case theyhappened to have a heart attack due to the infection.What one doesn’t see is an improvement in factors that started to build the riskcloud. These are also easy to summarize:• Paul Dudley White, a prominent Harvard cardiologist, was appointed to bePresident Eisenhower’s physician after Eisenhower suffered a heart attack in1955. White was of the opinion that a shift in the American diet was a chiefcause of the heart attack epidemic. Before and during the Great Depression, lowincomes kept most Americans eating a high proportion of vegetables and smallamounts of meat. With postwar prosperity there was an unprecedented rise inhigh-fat diets rich with meat.• White, who is credited with starting the push for heart attack prevention,also pointed to the health benefits of exercise, as American life was becomingmore sedentary.• A third factor White stressed was weight control.• Later on, as stress became better understood, the concept of the type Apersonality entered the popular culture. Heart attacks were linked to type Atraits of being tightly wound, demanding, driven, and perfectionist, as opposedto the type B personality, which was more relaxed, accepting, and generallyundemanding.• Toxicity entered the picture when the ill effects of tobacco were beingfocused on. Although lung cancer was the primary target, smoking was also foundin time to attack the lining of blood vessels, including the coronary arteries.• A gender gap in heart attacks between men and women was traced in large partto the role of estrogen, which protected women from heart disease untilmenopause.• Hypertension (high blood pressure) was found to aggravate heart disease byputting pressure on the lining of coronary arteries, exacerbating the tinycracks where fatty plaques first begin to be deposited.As you can see, this cloud of risks does not stand solely on cholesterol, so onthe surface it seems peculiar that one factor in our diet—and a totallynecessary chemical for cell structure—should emerge as the only villain.Inveterate cynics like to point out the huge profits amassed by drug companiespushing drugs, or the “silver bullet” mindset of Americans on the lookout for apill that instantly solves the problem, abetted by the willingness of doctors toprescribe a cholesterol-lowering drug when they know that CHD is a complexdisorder with multiple routes to prevention.Yet cynicism doesn’t lead to solutions, which is what we are after here.Controlling risk factors remains important. Despite the problem ofnoncompliance, more Americans now lead a lifestyle that’s good for their hearts:they exercise regularly; consume less fat as well as less sugar (the latter, itis now suspected, could pose a bigger risk than saturated fats); meditate and doyoga; and do not smoke.We will address these standard prevention measures in a later chapter, includingthe thorny complications of cholesterol. But making cholesterol the villain, andcholesterol lowering the panacea, isn’t valid. The Medical Clinics of NorthAmerica, after a meta-analysis (i.e., one that examines multiple studies) offour large primary prevention trials, suggested in 1994 that a 24 percentreduction in nonfatal heart attacks and a 14 percent reduction in fatal heartattacks could be expected because of cholesterol-lowering therapy.So stubborn is our addiction to silver-bullet drugs that a moderately successfuldrug like a statin, the most widely promoted class of cholesterol-loweringdrugs, used by one-quarter of the population over the age of forty, is touted asa solution. It should be acknowledged that statins can significantly lower therisk of a heart attack or stroke. In 2016, an article in the prestigious Britishmedical journal The Lancet claimed that statins prevent 80,000 heart attacks andstrokes a year in the United Kingdom. But what’s hidden from sight is thedifference between relative and absolute risks.Let’s say that a risk assessment conducted by your doctor told you that yourrisk of having a heart attack could be lowered 50 percent by taking a pill. Thatsounds impressive, but if your absolute risk of having a heart attack was only10 percent to begin with, lowering it to 5 percent isn’t so impressive. “Loweredby half” sounds dramatic compared with “lowered by 5 percent,” which is why drugcompanies tend to give only the relative risk improvement. (For some, thisrelative risk reduction is essential. In fact, Rudy, who comes from a familywith a strong history of early-onset heart disease, takes a statin as anecessary preventive in order to keep his LDL [low-density lipoprotein, or“bad,” cholesterol] below 60. Family history can point to a genetic risk thatwould otherwise not be offset except by intervening with a cholesterol-loweringdrug.)Medical researchers present different perspectives on the same data. In aJanuary 2009 letter to the New England Journal of Medicine, David H. Newman ofSt. Luke’s–Roosevelt Hospital in New York City offers a striking example. Themedical world had recently been encouraged by a meta-analysis showingconsiderable benefits from taking statins:> The range [being cited] as the relative risk reduction for all-cause> mortality, 20 to 30%, is inaccurate. The relative risk reduction was 12% over> five years. This number means that one death per year was averted for every> 417 patients taking a statin drug, or 1 of every 83 patients after five years> of therapy. The large preponderance of subjects in this meta-analysis had> established coronary disease, and the mortality rate among subjects in the> control group (9.7%) was quite high.> > This benefit is real, but it is small—and substantially smaller among patients> at lower risk (i.e., the great majority of patients currently receiving statin> therapy). This benefit should be explicitly discussed with patients so that> they understand, on the basis of their own five-year risk of death, their> individual chances of benefiting from statin therapy, given the known risks> and costs of these drugs.Everyone, the public and physicians alike, welcomes good news about reducing therisk of heart attacks, and it’s easy to forget the difference between relativeand absolute risk. In absolute terms the risk reduction isn’t large for patientswho already have a diagnosis of CHD. Over a five-year period,96 percent saw no benefit.1.2 percent had their lifespan extended by being saved from a fatal heartattack.2.6 percent were helped by preventing a repeat heart attack.0.8 percent were helped by preventing a stroke.0.6 percent were harmed by developing diabetes.10 percent were harmed by muscle damage.These findings are in keeping with general outcomes that find statins to reduceabsolute risk in people with preexisting heart disease by an average of 3percent, which is very different from the advertised lowering of relative risk,which was 20 percent.The American Heart Association advises that taking statins is on balance useful.In support of this, a comprehensive 2016 review in The Lancet showed that statintherapy reduces the risk of major vascular events—for example, heart attacks andstrokes—by incremental amounts that increase yearly if the drug is taken forfive years. The overall estimate indicates that if 10,000 people lowered theirLDL cholesterol with statins over this five-year period, 1,000 vascular eventswould be prevented; in other words, an absolute benefit of 10 percent. For thoselike Rudy with a strong family history that demands keeping their LDL levelslow, this benefit is sufficient to justify taking the drug. But is it enough forpeople at lower risk? The current government recommendation is that after anassessment of risk with your doctor, you should take statins if your risk ofheart disease is over 10 percent and you are between the ages of forty andseventy-five.Even though they are accepted as the gold standard in cholesterol reduction,statins are by no means foolproof. Two published studies found that thecalcification of plaques actually increased among statin users, making theirheart disease progress faster. In one study of 6,600 men without previousdiagnosis of CHD, published in the journal Atherosclerosis, the prevalence andextent of calcified plaque was 52 percent higher than in nonusers of the drug.Statins can also react with common blood pressure medications and bloodthinners, along with antibiotics. Women of childbearing age taking statins musttake birth control pills concurrently or else run the risk of the statinscausing birth defects.But let’s set aside whether it’s worthwhile to take statins for five years,counting the costs and the possible side effects (myalgia, or muscle pain, iscommon and increases with age or when taking other heart-related drugs). A moreimportant statistic isn’t understood by the general public: statins don’tnecessarily indicate that you will live longer. A meta-analysis by Dr. KausikRay and his colleagues published in Archives of Internal Medicine in 2010 foundthat statins had no effect on death rates from all causes. Statins work bymanaging one risk factor: they lower the levels of LDL cholesterol in thebloodstream, the low-density lipid considered to be the “bad” cholesterol.However, LDL levels were not found to significantly influence how long a personlives. One must take into account many other factors, such as inflammation andpredisposition to calcification.No doubt the cloud of risks for CHD is confusing, giving little indication whichrisk is key when you are making lifestyle choices. Is it cholesterol in yourdiet or stress at work? Is it sitting in front of the computer all day orcarrying extra weight? Nor does the cloud of risks help out with another crucialfactor—that as people age, entering the most dangerous decades for heartdisease, they also tend to decrease their efforts to exercise, to follow ahealthy diet, and to remain at an ideal weight. (A 2015 Gallup poll of 335,000American adults reported that 51.6 percent say they do exercise at least threetimes a week for 30 minutes. But this doesn’t really satisfy governmentrecommendations, which advise 150 minutes of moderate to intense physicalactivity per week, plus two or more sessions of strength-building exercises thatwork all the major muscle groups. Only 20 percent of adults comply with thisoptimal amount, according to current Centers for Disease Control and Preventiondata. People who tended to exercise the most were aged eighteen to twenty-six,earned more than $90,000 a year, lived in western states, and were male. Onlytwo out of five obese people exercised at least three times a week.)In a whole-system approach we want to clear away the cloud of risks and itsconfusion. To begin with, let’s stop isolating the heart as if it were avulnerable organ that has to be worried over constantly. The larger picture isvery different. According to statistics from the United States and Europe, aperson who is already sixty-five will on average live another nineteen to twentyyears. The average holds true for both men and women but is strongly impacted ifsomeone is poor, smokes, or is otherwise leading an unhealthy lifestyle. Yet ifyou ask a second question, how many of these extended years will be healthy, theanswer is shocking: about half. A sixty-five-year-old man typically looksforward to eleven years of healthy life, a sixty-five-year-old woman slightlyless. The term healthy is subject to varying definitions, but this overallpicture is of a decade of diminished quality of life. Ultimately that’s what weneed to improve and prevent. A healing approach to the heart keeps in mind thebigger goal of wellness for life.HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV)We need firmer ground if we want to find healing that benefits the whole system.Let’s begin with a measurement known as heart rate variability (HRV). Thetypical sound of a heartbeat is a steady drumming to the rhythm of a weak beatfollowed by a strong one: lub-DUB, lub-DUB. In reality, a healthy heart isflexible and changes its rhythm according to the situation. The pounding heartof a marathon runner is enormously different from the near cessation of theheart in the deep meditation of an Indian yogi. On a subtler level, your heartresponds to the stimulation of daily stresses, even the most minor. If you growtense, your heartbeat becomes more like a steady drumming, quick and evenlyspaced. In medical terms, this means your HRV is low, which isn’t preferable. Indiabetics, low heart rate variability is associated with poor heart health andcan even increase the risk of sudden cardiac death.High HRV occurs when the heart responds within a flexible range of faster orslower beats depending on what’s happening in the bodymind. On its own, a humanheart beats at around 100 beats per minute, but the effect of the autonomicnervous system, which is responsible for unconscious processes throughout thebody, reduces this to around 70 beats per minute. That’s a desirable restingrate, on average. But it’s ultimately the nervous system that proves critical.When HRV is high, the autonomic nervous system is in balance. The signals thatcould cause fight-or-flight and stress reactions generally are kept in check bysignals that promote rest and relaxation. When HRV is low, it can not only pointto heart problems but also give other diagnostic clues about cancer, diabetes,stroke, glaucoma, and more. The far reach of these influences becomes intriguingto students of autonomic responses. You can intervene and slow down your heartby applying pressure to your eyes, for example, or by rubbing the carotidarteries on either side of your neck.With the advent of wearable devices to monitor blood pressure, heart rate, andother vital signs, it turns out that HRV is one of the best single indicators ofhow stressed a person feels. Using simple deep breathing or a few moments ofmeditation, people can improve their HRV while reducing the stress response. Awearable device can monitor and verify the change. Thus, subjective andobjective reality merge together, as they already do in the union of body andmind.Let’s say you’re late for work and rush out of the house. It’s a cold morning,and when you turn on the ignition, your car won’t start. At that moment, bothsides of reality begin to have an effect. On the objective side is an outsidestressor—your car’s dead battery—which leads to objective changes in your body.Stress hormones like adrenaline and cortisol are likely to kick in; the brain’semotional center, the amygdala, will show heightened activity; your bloodpressure may rise, and your heart rate increase. All of this is typical of thebody’s stress response. On the subjective side, the range of reactions is sovariable that they are far less predictable. You could panic, for example, ifthis is your second week on the job and getting fired would be a disaster. Onthe other hand, you could own the company and consider this a minorinconvenience. Outside the realm of small daily stresses, the major stressesthat alter a person’s life evoke everything from grief and sorrow to extremefear, depression, and suicidal tendencies.The wonder is that the whole system is so sensitive and dynamic that it handlesthe entire spectrum. But at bottom, the pivotal factor is subjective. How youperceive and interpret any stress determines how hard it affects you. A dead carbattery can be the start of something big or nothing at all. So how do you dealwith a measurement that depends so heavily on your inner life? It’s an importantquestion, because in terms of risk factors, low HRV is linked to a number ofdisorders, both psychological and physical. As a marker for mental illness, lowHRV appears more or less everywhere, from depression and generalized anxietydisorder to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), bipolar disorder, andschizophrenia. The heart suffers the mind’s distress. On the physical side, lowHRV is associated with inflammation, opening the gateway for a range ofdisorders so wide that, once again, low HRV may be a marker for illnesses thatseem to have nothing to do with one another, like cancer, diabetes, and heartdisease.Clearly it’s good to have enhanced HRV—that much is medically certain. A directway to achieve this is through meditation and other contemplative practices, aswe’ve already mentioned. If you look back at the illustration of the bodymindpathways on this page [Chop_9780451495532_epub3_c001_r1.xhtml#img_002], you’llnotice that the heart is placed midway between the “bottom-up” messages sentfrom the intestinal region and the “top-down” messages sent by the brain. To aphysiologist who is looking for a specific part of the anatomy responsible forrouting messages in both directions, what stands out is the vagus nerve, solet’s look at it more closely. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------STIMULATING THE VAGUS NERVE--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The term vagus derives from the Latin for “wandering,” which is what the vagusnerve does. It is one of the ten cranial nerves that branch directly from thebrain to spread out across the body. The vagus nerve wanders from the brain tothe intestines, with stops along the way, primarily at the heart and lungs. Itsmajor responsibility is to regulate heart, lung, and digestive functions. As thelongest nerve in the body, the vagus has two main branches, right and left, thatdescend down either side of your neck. The vagus nerve can be consideredhardwired from the gut to the brain. The signals are produced by the gutmicrobiome, the bacteria that inhabit the gut. The gut microbiome contains 200times more genes than the human genome (4,000,000 versus 20,000).Of the many facts that can be stated about nerves, one important distinction isthat some nerves send signals away from the brain (efferent nerves) while otherssend signals back to the brain (afferent nerves). Because of its countless smallbranches reaching almost every organ, the vagus nerve is responsible for between80 percent and 90 percent of afferent impulses. In everyday language, this meansthat the sensory information—especially the effects of pain and stress—travelingalong the body’s information superhighway travels along this one nerve. As aresult, when vagal nerve activity is low, a host of things could be goingwrong—diminished activity is associated with increased death from infections,rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, irritable bowel syndrome, sarcoidosis (a disorderof unknown cause that creates swollen lymph nodes), trauma, depression, andstress. Stimulating the vagus nerve has an instantaneous effect on yourheartbeat and HRV.By now you’ve become used to these laundry lists of illnesses that cross thebodymind frontier. Here, it’s significant that the vagus nerve is a two-wayhighway, sending signals back and forth between the intestinal tract and thebrain. It regulates the gut-brain response, which in turn may be all-importantin inflammation. Published findings indicate that meditation and variouscontemplative practices may improve immune response by stimulating the vagusnerve in such a way that inflammation is reduced.One enticing piece of evidence involves stimulating the vagus nerve physically.This involves the surgical implant of a small battery-powered generator aboutthe size of a watch. Typically done as an outpatient procedure, the implant istucked into the space below the left collarbone. A wire is run into the neckwhere the left branch of the vagus nerve descends, and the wire is looped aroundthe nerve. When the generator is turned on—there are various settings from weakto strong—it sends faint electrical pulses that stimulate the vagus nerve.What’s mind bending, as viewed from conventional medical training, is how widethe possible benefits of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) seem to be. Presently noless than thirty-two disorders are undergoing research, with indications ofpositive results. They begin with alcohol addiction, irregular heartbeat (atrialfibrillation), and autism, running through a rogue’s gallery of physical andpsychological illnesses: heart disease, mood disorders like depression andanxiety, a variety of intestinal disorders, addictions, and perhaps even memoryloss and Alzheimer’s disease. The “wandering” nerve embraces many parts of thebrain and body, implying that it can have a healing effect holistically.A breakthrough finding about the vagus nerve came from Kevin J. Tracey, aneurosurgeon and a specialist in molecular medicine. Dr. Tracey had the insightthat the body’s immune system must have evolved to preserve homeostasis, theoverall balance of the body. When inflammation occurs as a part of a normalimmune response (the so-called inflammation reflex), the body goes out ofbalance, entering healing mode. There are specific chemicals that regulate thisreflex, which is controlled from the nucleus of cells. One importantinflammation marker is a chemical group known as cytokines. It’s known thatcytokines can go outside their normal range, and when this happens, acute orchronic inflammation occurs. By analogy, the body lights a fire that won’t goout and can flare up dangerously.It was long assumed that the immune system took care of the inflammation reflexon its own, but beginning in 2011 Tracey and his colleagues showed that a brainchemical, or neurotransmitter, called acetylcholine is engaged in regulating howmuch or little cytokine is produced. Specifically, they connected acetylcholinewith memory T-cells in the spleen. The highway that this messaging travels alongis the vagus nerve. (A May 2014 profile of Tracey in the Sunday magazine of theNew York Times was aptly titled “Can the Immune System Be Hacked?”)Tracey and his team went on in 2012 to demonstrate the therapeutic benefit ofstimulating the vagus nerve in a paper that disclosed improvements in rheumatoidarthritis symptoms that were resistant to conventional drug treatment. Thisresult opened the floodgates of research in many areas. Suddenly the brain-gutaxis became one of the hottest topics in internal medicine. The paradigm fordiseases is now undergoing radical revision, and the revision is always in thedirection of wholeness, viewing the bodymind as a single system.For example, millions of people suffer from irritable bowel syndrome, alsocalled by related names such as spastic colon, nervous colon, and mucouscolitis. It’s a miserable illness, causing not only severe abdominal pain andirregular bowel movements but also the psychological distress of never knowingwhen these unpredictable symptoms will strike. Looked at locally as purely anintestinal problem, an irritable bowel displays inflammation that makes theintestinal area hypersensitive—a minor stimulus can lead to raging inflammation.Now the paradigm for the disease has changed with the discovery that, via thevagus nerve, different brain areas are involved, such as the somatosensorycortex, insula, amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex, and hippocampus. Bothoutgoing and incoming nerve signals are involved along the brain-gut axis, andonce the brain is invoked, there’s a major opening for emotions and stressreactions. This helps explain why many sufferers from irritable bowel syndromefind themselves referred to psychotherapy, because the dysfunction in theireveryday routine makes them so anxious and depressed.However, now that we know that there is abnormal brain signaling in patientswith irritable bowels, separating the physical and psychological aspects oftheir illness no longer makes sense. One of the main causes for optimism intreating the disorder is the vagal nerve implant, because it would enhancebrain-gut axis activity. Also on the horizon are wearables that stimulate thevagus nerve without surgery, sending the faint electrical pulses through theskin where nerves are closely connected to the vagus nerve, such as around theear.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The vagus nerve is a convincing example that supports the idea that there isonly one bodymind—in effect, it’s a lifeline to the heart carrying messages ofboth physical and mental events. A completely noninvasive alternative ismeditation, long proved to reduce the stress response; there are anecdotalreports of meditators saying that their irritable bowels became better afterthey began meditating. The breakthrough discovery that the brain directlyaffects T-cells in the immune system was startling, even to experts in thefield. Medical school training always kept the central nervous system in onecompartment and the immune system in another. Now it is suspected that there aredozens of lifestyle choices that can stimulate the vagus nerve. This puts inplace a critical piece of the jigsaw puzzle, showing that the immune system isconnected to the brain and not an isolated system on its own. But all of thisphysical evidence must not pull us in the wrong direction. Healing is not onlycontrolled physically; the key is consciousness.AWARENESS AND INFLAMMATIONWe keep repeating that what you aren’t aware of, you can’t change. One keylink—perhaps the ultimate answer—to many chronic disorders, including CHD, seemsto be something it’s difficult or impossible to be aware of: inflammation. Theinitial effects are microscopic in the case of what’s happening inside theheart. This requires a bit of medical explanation. The slick inside surface ofyour arteries is known as the endothelium. Its slickness isn’t entirely becauseof having a smooth surface. The endothelium is dynamic and active. It secreteschemicals, for example, that repel toxins that are damaging to it, like theresidues of smoking. Unlike water pipes, blood vessels expand and contract toalter how much blood flows through them. The rigidity of the plaque that buildsup in heart disease is a problem, but the underlying issue is atherosclerosis,commonly called hardening of the arteries.Just as leaves gather in a rain gutter in the fall, when the endothelial liningof the coronary arteries starts to develop cracks, bits of LDL cholesterolfloating by get lodged in them, and the fatty deposits are slowly hardened withcalcium buildup and tiny blood clots. Over time, the white blood cells that rushin to deal with the LDL cholesterol inside the artery wall also add to theplaque. (Atherosclerosis isn’t limited to the coronary arteries but is asystemic disease. The potential for strokes is often associated with plaques inthe carotid artery in the neck.) It’s known that high blood pressure, smoking,and high LDL levels are causes of plaque.But they aren’t how the disease begins. At the microscopic level, the firstsigns of atherosclerosis seem to occur as fatty streaks in the artery’s musclecells. These fatty streaks apparently become inflamed, and from there the cracksin the endothelial lining develop. No one knows where the fatty streaksoriginate, but it seems likely that by the time traditional prevention isfollowed, the disease is well past its beginnings. Yet in between the fattystreaks and the cracks, one culprit—inflammation—can be attacked. In fact, fromeverything we know, this appears to be the best whole-system approach.Inflammation is a whole-system problem from head to toe. But if we can’t detectit in everyday life, how do we know what to do? Unlike the redness, swelling,and discomfort of acute inflammation (e.g., at a burn or wound site), low-levelchronic inflammation causes few, if any, symptoms. Telltale markers forinflammation, particularly cytokines, show up in artery walls afflicted withatherosclerosis. Where awareness can make an important difference is in the areaof stress, which, as is well documented, creates inflammation.Meditation reduces stress by acting at the level of unconscious autonomicresponses in the brain. But as you become more self-aware, either throughmeditation or some other avenue, you begin to pick up on negative input thatkeeps the whole system in a low-lying stress response. The chemical story iscomplex, but the chain of damaging events is clear:Stress [images/Chop_9780451495532_epub3_006_r1.jpg] Inflammation[images/Chop_9780451495532_epub3_006_r1.jpg] Atherosclerosis[images/Chop_9780451495532_epub3_006_r1.jpg] CHDIf the first link in this chain of events is instead self-awareness, the rest ofthe sequence is either preventable or reduced, making treatment easier. Earlier(see this page [Chop_9780451495532_epub3_c003_r1.xhtml#page_41]), we gave somepointers on how to remain self-aware at work. But self-awareness can be blockedby all kinds of things. Using the workplace as an example:• The pressure of deadlines induces a level of stress that’s chronic, and weadapt to it by blocking it out, eventually even normalizing it. But our cellsdon’t have this blocking mechanism and incrementally become damaged.• Heart rate variability suffers under the constant demands of a typicalworkday.• The sedentary routine of modern jobs, many of which involve hours at thecomputer, weakens muscle tone and adds to the current epidemic of obesity.• The repetition involved in routine work dulls the mind and creates a flattenedmood.• Interpersonal tensions in the workplace create resentment, anger, envy, andanxiety that wind up being shoved down out of sight without actually beingresolved.• Unexpressed negative emotions and tension are communicated back and forthbetween the brain, heart, and gut along the vagus nerve, creating diminishedfunction that often shows up in a tight stomach, an irritated bowel,constipation, and other signs of inflammation.These workplace stressors offer a prime example of how “normal” life is actuallyworking against healing, and similar stressors exist outside the workplace, athome. However, no matter how slow the pace of dysfunction is, the whole systemis paying a steady price that mounts up, bit by bit, every day. When you go towork, you are taking 50 trillion cells to the office with you, and theirwell-being determines your well-being in the end.Inflammation is a complex issue that largely occurs at a hidden cellular level,but the stress response is something we can control in everyday life.Ironically, this is the element most people pay the least attention to. Theyimprove their lifestyle with diet and exercise while leading fast-paced,demanding lives that lie at the heart of the problem. The next step in ourhealing journey is to look at how stress and the healing response are connectedat the deepest level."},{"pageContent":"5GETTING OUT OF OVERDRIVEDecades after stress became a household word, most people don’t understandit—and that’s not their fault. Ask yourself which of the following events youwould consider stressful:Going through a divorceWinning the lotteryGoing on vacationHaving a babyThe correct answer is “all of the above.” Stress can be defined as any inputthat triggers the body’s stress response. Psychologically, stress resultswhenever anxiety about the future or regrets about the past are invoked. We maylabel a nasty divorce as a negative event and winning the lottery as a positiveone, but that’s not how the lower brain sees it. The lower, or reptilian, brainis an evolutionary inheritance from earlier stages of life on Earth, bringingwith it our ancestral fight-or-flight response. A vast range of everydayexperiences, from giving birth to losing your job, from having depression inyour family history to breaking the bank at Las Vegas, can be stressful. Expertsrefer to “eustress,” indicating that the stressor is a happy event—the Greekprefix eu means “good” or “well”—but it is stressful nonetheless.In a healing lifestyle we must address the stress that accumulates over time,and because most of this accumulation is invisible and occurs very slowly, thereis really no difference between stress management and life management. Forexample, joyous as it is to give birth, new mothers report that raising aninfant is extremely stressful—not that this should come as a surprise. We adaptto eustress and distress, the good and bad along the spectrum, because we must.Babies need to be cherished and nurtured, despite the cost in both physical andmental stress to the parents.A whole-system approach tells us that putting up with stress isn’t good enough.New parents are assured by everyone who has been there that babies eventuallystop waking you up in the middle of the night, stop teething, stop beingterrible two-year-olds. All true, but there is always something stressful lyingahead, which is true of life in general. So dealing with stress involves twothings: clearing from the system the residue of old stressors and preventing theimpact of new stressors from being too severe. Both steps figure prominently inlife management.HANDLING ACUTE STRESSSome events strike out of the blue and face us with immediate stress—these areknown as acute stresses. Being fired is an example, and all of us haveexperienced how difficult losing a job can be; it’s something deeply feared bymillions of people. We have also experienced self-defeating ways of dealing withthis kind of crisis. A certain percentage of people simply withdraw and seekdistraction, hoping that time will heal their wound. Psychiatric studies havefound, for example, that the most common behavior in the face of acute stress iswatching more television (which now would be updated to constantly playing videogames), a phenomenon that has become endemic among older blue-collar workerslaid off from work, often permanently. Since this behavior is also attended byhigher rates of opiate addiction among white males over fifty and an alarmingincrease in suicides, using distraction clearly isn’t a viable defense againstacute stress.In your own life, when you are hit by acute stress, such as a bad breakup or thediagnosis of a potentially serious disorder, a certain amount of withdrawal anddistraction is natural and good. Time doesn’t lead to complete healing, but itallows disrupted emotions to return to equilibrium. Turning to comfort food and“eating your feelings” make sense emotionally for a while. But eventually youneed to cope with acute stress in a healing way that is proactive. Otherwise youmay walk away with lasting wounds, bad memories, lower self-esteem, and otherdamage.The path to healing is actually demonstrated by the situation of having a baby.After the mother gives birth, her brain creates higher levels of dopamine andoxytocin, two chemicals associated with heightened mood, even euphoria. As withany pleasure or reward a person experiences, the first time makes us want itagain. A 2008 study headed by Lane Strathearn at Baylor University and publishedin the journal Pediatrics showed that when new mothers experienced pleasure uponseeing their baby, the same brain regions were activated as those activated bycocaine—in this case a natural high. Intriguingly, seeing either a happy or sadbaby face was pleasurable, as measured by reward signals in the mother’s brain,as long as she felt confident and secure about her baby. In contrast, motherswho were overly stressed about their newborns had different areas of the brainactivated when the baby cried, areas linked to pain and disgust. It turns outthat the stress level of a mother can have a dramatic effect on her interactionwith the infant and how the baby’s own brain will develop.The stress that occurs when a newborn arrives isn’t simply going to vanish. Fora year or more, both parents live disrupted lives, and the typical signs ofacute stress rise up to greet them, including fatigue, frayed tempers, badsleep, and a sense of losing control. Stress experts indicate that increasingthe unpredictability in your life and feeling that you are out of control makesacute stress much worse. It’s easy to see how losing your job turns a steadyincome and pride in doing a good job into the opposite, having no accomplishmentto feel proud of and not knowing what the future will bring. But having a babyhas the same dimensions. Infant health is unpredictable, and parents have nocontrol over when their baby is suddenly going to need immediate attention.Some parents of newborns do much better at coping than others; see below forexamples of how they do it.THE “BABY SOLUTION” TO ACUTE STRESSTHE KEY IS A RANGE OF COPING MECHANISMS ANYONE CAN CALL UPON.• Get enough rest and sleep.• Make time for yourself every day to be alone and quiet.• Make sure you get outside to refresh your connection to nature.• Maintain an active life—don’t be chained to the situation.• Share duties and responsibilities. Ask for help before you feel overwhelmed.• Pursue a regular routine—this helps offset unpredictable events.• Find an activity that makes you feel in control.• Find a confidant with whom you can share your feelings without judgment.• Don’t martyr yourself by taking on more than you can handle.• Fight the urge to feel victimized.• Don’t isolate yourself—keep up your social activity.• Seek out people in the same situation who can empathize with you and offerpositive support.• Resist self-judgment. Be easy on yourself, accepting the ups and downs ofemotions as natural.• Where there is the possibility of finding joy, pause to appreciate it.The arrival of a baby is such a joyful event that the positive side thatcounters the stress is obvious and easily accessible. The same isn’t true if youare going through a divorce or suddenly lose your job. Even so, the importantpoint is to be aware that you can cope by developing the coping behavior we’veoutlined. This is a conscious, self-aware project. Your built-in responses can’taccomplish it for you.If you find yourself in a crisis that induces acute stress, take the followingsteps:1. Start to journal about your path out of the crisis.2. In your journal write down the list of coping mechanisms we’ve just given.You might want to make each one a page heading on its own.3. Under each coping behavior, write down something you can do immediately toadopt that behavior.4. Follow up every day with your successes when a coping mechanism is beginningto work for you.None of these coping mechanisms is complicated; most are self-explanatory. Butacute stress is such a powerful disruption that it throws our awareness offkilter. We wind up doing things we know deep down are self-defeating, such asbeing alone too much of the time, acting out the role of a victim, and lettingfear and anxiety gain the upper hand by keeping our emotions bottled up.We’ve already described how people who feel supported are significantly lesslikely to develop angina than those who don’t feel such support (see this page[Chop_9780451495532_epub3_c003_r1.xhtml#page_39]). The connection betweenemotional well-being and heart health is undeniable. But the same truth holdsfor confronting acute stress, which threatens health and well-being at everylevel, including your body. Yet in most lives, situations that create acutestress will tend to be intermittent and hopefully rare. We need to extend thediscussion to the invisible kind of everyday stress that actually causes moreharm than people realize, harm that can prove disastrous over a period of yearswithout being detected. We’re referring to the hidden culprit, chronic stress.CHRONIC STRESS AND “SYMPATHETIC OVERDRIVE”How are you handling the little everyday stresses in your life? Most peoplecomplain about the stressors that plague almost everyone in modern society,particularly its high speed, long work hours, and inescapable irritations liketraffic jams and boring commutes. Our inclination is to adapt to these stresses,taking them in stride. We shrug off the way life keeps speeding up (evendemanding more speed when it comes to the Internet and smartphones); we listento music to divert the frustration of traffic snarls and long waits at theairport; we accept that work pressures are necessary in order to get ahead inour careers.Human adaptation is a miracle, but stress management took a wrong turn at theoutset when experts, and the medical profession in general, focused on twofactors as the most important: physical stress and outside stress. These go handin hand. The theory was that some external event triggered a physical responsein the body, and in this interaction the main problem of stress was revealed. Soif you hear gunfire (outside stressor) and instantly feel your pulse racing(physical response), the typical stress reaction has been triggered. True, thispattern is common enough. We mentioned earlier a string of outside events thatare highly stressful, such as going through a divorce or winning the lottery.But from a whole-system viewpoint, at least half the story is untold, becausethe inner world of subjective events creates stress, too, and at the same timeis the source for healing the effects of stress. Let’s look at a highlystressful event, entering the hospital for surgery. On the physical side, thestressful event is the medical procedure itself, but other stresses are havingan impact mentally and emotionally. These include the following:Worrying about the surgery’s outcomeHigh or low expectationsTrust or distrust in medical careThe strangeness of the hospital environmentDisruption to normal daily habitsIntrusive and embarrassing poking and proddingLoss of control over what is happeningAnxiety about the futureFear of what will happen to the whole familySo much depends on these factors that they should be placed first and foremost.To a surgeon, either he successfully repairs a diseased heart, liver, or brainor he doesn’t. But the physical outcome barely touches upon the invisiblestresses and how we handle them.Because the inner approach to stress, including meditation and mindfulnesspractices, has proved to be so beneficial in reducing stress, it’s reasonable tothink that going inward is how the average person fights against stress. But itwould be an exaggeration to believe that meditation and mindfulness havepenetrated deeply into typical Western lifestyles. Why? There has been plenty ofmedia coverage about meditation and its benefits. The negative attitudes towardit have steadily melted away—few people now consider meditation a strangeesoteric religious practice from the East. The resistance to adopting meditationand mindfulness gives us a portrait of life that is stuck in old habits andattitudes that not only block meditation but also block a healing lifestylegenerally.Without seeing the damage we are doing, most of us, the vast majority in fact,have put ourselves in overdrive. What does this mean? In physiological terms,the best reference is the nervous system. The nervous system is the primeexample of how your body operates under dual control, a point we keep returningto. Any process that you don’t have to think about is handled by the autonomicnervous system, which in lay terms was once referred to (somewhat mistakenly) asthe involuntary nervous system. Essentially the autonomic nervous systemcontrols how organs function. The term involuntary once made perfect sense,because the nerves that control the heart, stomach, and digestive tract overseefunctions that don’t need our voluntary cooperation. You can’t tell your heartto stop beating or your small intestine to give you a break and extract fewercalories from the food you eat.But the idea that you have no control over the autonomic system is misleading,because this nervous system turns out to be more adaptable to our wishes,feelings, thoughts, and other mental activity than anyone used to think. Theautonomic nervous system is divided into two parts, known as the sympathetic andparasympathetic nervous system. (Again the terms are a bit misleading, sincesympathetic isn’t being used in the same way as extending your sympathy tosomeone else.) The basic function of the sympathetic nervous system is todeliver the fight-or-flight response. Even though the lower brain is the seat offight-or-flight, it takes a whole network of nerves throughout the body,extending from the spinal cord, to activate everything that goes into this oneresponse.A great many elements are involved in the fight-or-flight response: pupildilation, increased sweating, increased heart rate, and increased bloodpressure. At the same time, digestion is temporarily halted, metabolism shiftsinto another gear, and muscles begin to operate anaerobically—that is, withoutneeding oxygen. Being temporary, these are emergency measures only. Evolutiondidn’t equip us to react to stress constantly. In addition, when a full-blownstress response is triggered, there is little one can do to override it, becausethe hormones being secreted, such as cortisol and adrenaline, latch on tospecific receptors on the cell membrane and trigger a chain of unstoppableevents inside the cell. For example, in bone marrow, chronic stress can causeimmune cells to promote inflammation, a process that begins with changes at thelevel of genes. If a certain stressor, like a loud neighbor, is happening everyday, chronic inflammation can be the result leading to heart disease, cancer, orother disorders. Luckily, these detrimental changes in our cells in response tostress can also be temporary. From this picture, instead of saying that mostpeople are in overdrive, what we should call it is “sympathetic overdrive,”because too much demand is being placed on the sympathetic nervous system.Fight-or-flight feels like an on-off mechanism when you experience it: the signsare drastic and unmistakable.If you’ve ever seen street magic on TV or in person, when the magician performsa trick, whether it’s pulling the ace of spades from behind someone’s ear orcorrectly reading a random number they are thinking, many spectators actuallyrun away—they may be laughing, but the sympathetic nervous system can’t take ajoke and forces them to flee, at least for a moment.Yet, in reality, the stress response operates on a sliding scale, and thesympathetic nervous system can be thrown into a low-level state that over timeproduces a wide range of damaging effects.Beyond what most people realize, being in sympathetic overdrive undermines themevery day. We can illustrate the problem with a story about a woman we’ll callMara, whose life contains nothing disastrous or deeply troubling but whoexemplifies how far from healing many people actually are without knowing it.MARA’S STORY: INVISIBLE DAMAGE OVER TIMEMara is forty, successful, and has little to complain about. She learned earlyon that she was a bright student, and academic achievement followed her throughschool until she graduated with honors from an Ivy League college. This was inthe mid-1990s, and like many other young people buoyed by a booming economy, shewent into the financial sector, getting a good entry job at a major bank. Herlife began to unfold according to plan.“I made very good money, and I got promoted on the fast track,” Mara recalls.“The price was total dedication to the job, and like everyone I knew, I spent aminimum of sixty hours at work every week. I took work home and sometimes cameinto the office on Saturdays. Frankly, I enjoyed it. When I heard that somepeople thrive on stress, I thought to myself, This is me.”Mara developed this attitude after discovering very quickly how competitive herchosen career actually was. Her friendships soon became limited to coworkers atthe bank—young, ambitious types she found exciting to be around. They weredetermined to be winners. Out of this pool of people she began to date Frank,another banker, who was also attending law school at night.“Frank was driven,” Mara says, “but he was also smart and funny. He could sizepeople up and cut them down to size if he had to. It seemed like we made a greatteam.”With matching lifestyles and goals, they became a serious couple and moved intogether. With such a strong focus on work, they decided to postpone having ababy at least until their thirties.Fast-forward five years. At thirty Mara had moved on to a newrelationship—looking back at the three years she spent with Frank, they wereprobably too much alike. They both had strong egos; they argued a lot, andneither liked to back down. Yet what finally broke up the relationship wasmoney. When Mara began to make more than Frank did, he sulked and tried tocompensate by trying to act more dominant and aggressive, looking for excuses toput her down.“I wasn’t that shaken up when he decided to move out,” says Mara. “I suspectedhe was looking around for somebody else anyway. I bounced back pretty quickly,and it was only a few months later that I met Jason, who wasn’t ambitious andhad a career totally outside finance. Jason is tender, caring, andnoncompetitive where Frank was self-centered, tense, and angry. Once I saw thecontrast, it was easy to make a change.”Mara’s career was still moving ahead, but she did notice that males at her levelwere getting promoted ahead of her. This and other evidence of sexism made workmore problematic, but she was good at her job. She also started paying attentionto exercise—she jogged regularly now—and watching her weight, two things thathadn’t really been part of her lifestyle in her twenties.Jump ahead to age forty. Mara married Jason and they have a four-year-old girl.After taking three months of maternity leave when the baby was born, Mara wasback at work. She feels good about her relationship with Jason, but there areareas of conflict. In particular, he revealed himself to be passive andsometimes does things she considers passive-aggressive, like “forgetting” topick their child up from day care on the day after a big fight with Mara. In thedynamic of their marriage, Mara has adopted the aggressor role, although shehates being that way, while Jason goes quiet and watches TV if he sensestension, even though she’s begged him a thousand times to tell her how he reallyfeels.“I look around, and things aren’t perfect,” she says. “I sort of fell into thesupermom syndrome trying to be a total achiever at work and a caring wife andmother at home. It’s going okay. There are plenty of people worse off than me.”There are other positive aspects of her life that she rarely even thinks about.Mara’s health is good, essentially as worry-free as when she was twenty. She’snever had a cancer scare, and being premenopausal, her body’s estrogen hasprotected her so far from heart disease. It’s true that she stopped joggingduring her pregnancy and never returned to it, and she intermittently attemptsto diet to lose the ten pounds she gained back then. But with increasingemotional maturity, she is better able to navigate the ups and downs of anintimate relationship as well as raise a child like a responsible, lovingparent.So where’s the problem? Millions of people lead similar lives and feel thatnothing troublesome is affecting them. Yet if you consider what we’ve discoveredso far about a healing lifestyle, Mara isn’t living it. See below to gaininsight as to where the invisible cracks can occur in the life you are likely tobe leading now.HOW A “NORMAL” LIFESTYLE BLOCKS HEALING• Daily activity gets driven by work, with its demand for achievement andsuccess along with our fear of loss and failure.• Self-esteem is built on external norms like getting promoted and beingcompetitive.• With so much focus on externals, life is lived on the surface. As the outsidefactors get more organized, a person’s inner life doesn’t keep up.• Emotional needs are placed second or not faced honestly.• Little or no attention is paid to chronic low-level stress.• Relationships settle into routine and habit.• Physical activity and contact with nature begin to diminish over time. Lifebecomes gradually more sedentary.• There’s no higher vision of possibilities, thanks to the burden of constantdemands and duties from family and work.• Paying attention to health issues is temporary and intermittent. For the mostpart, little is done until actual symptoms appear.This is a shocking list of things we take for granted—or manage to put upwith—even though they keep us in sympathetic overdrive. Stress follows in thewake of each item on the list, which means that stress is a much bigger issuethan we assume. To put it simply, millions of people put a positive value onchoices that are actually negative from a whole-system perspective.So where do you stand right now? It’s hard to assess your own stress simplybecause the bodymind system is so good at adapting. Years go by without seemingto expose the damage stress is doing. Stress experts recognize three stages ofstress that occur one after the other. The earliest stage exposes psychologicaleffects; the next stage, behavioral effects; and the third stage, physicaleffects. What follows is a summary of each. Read each category to see if youdetect any signs of stress taking its toll on you.THREE LEVELS OF DAMAGEPSYCHOLOGICAL AND NEURALPsychological and neural damage begins with minor things like feeling mentallytired and under pressure from deadlines at work. When people say they arestressed out, they generally mean that they’ve run out of energy, which can maskmental states like being depressed, anxious, or even panicky. Because the brainis being affected, there’s interruption in normal sleep rhythms or the naggingfeeling that time is running out, a condition Dr. Larry Dossey dubbed “timesickness.” With mental fatigue can come flawed decision making or memory lapses,but in general the problem is loss of concentration, the ability to focus.Emotionally, stress seems to make us retreat to infancy, becoming prone tooutbursts of anger, distress, and irritability. The more the stress mounts, theshorter the fuse gets on our negative emotions.BEHAVIORALNegative changes in behavior are likely to manifest in two major areas, work andrelationships. Stressful jobs make us respond with all kinds of behaviors, fromoffice gossip to going out for a drink after work. As stress mounts, thedrinking can get heavier, the need for distraction more severe. Inevitably wetake our feelings home after work, where friction easily follows. A spouse whofeels neglected, mistreated, or ignored is feeling the brunt of stress-relatedbehavior. Stress makes one person lose his appetite and another overeat. Sleepoften gets disrupted, and in some cases chronic insomnia is the outcome. Thisand other ill effects might lead the person to become dependent on sleepingpills and other drugs in an attempt to shake off work stress and find the wayback to feeling normal.PHYSICALWhen the body can’t completely adapt to stress, bad effects follow without beingpredictable. Most people will suffer from physical fatigue. Stomachaches, baddigestion, and headaches are likely. So is a reduced immune response, leading tomore colds and worsened allergies. After that, the problems will tend to beassociated with inflammation, whose effects can travel anywhere. One person mayexperience skin eruptions, another irritable bowel syndrome, yet another a heartattack or stroke. By this stage, the damage caused by stress has led to serioussystem breakdown.In the brain, stress activates a specific neural network called thehypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Activation of the HPA axis leads tothe excess production of specific hormones known as glucocorticoids by theadrenal glands. Glucocorticoids are needed for normal brain development and arealso activated during moments of acute stress. However, elevated levels can havethe reverse effect and cause neurotoxicity, as shown in studies of stress duringpregnancy. There is a natural barrier that prevents stress hormones in themother from being passed through the placenta to the fetus. In stressfulpregnancy, this barrier appears to be crossed, and one major result isinterference with normal brain development and functioning—when glucocorticoidswere given to pregnant rats, the brains of the offspring didn’t developproperly.Much more than was suspected in the past, a difficult pregnancy that puts themother under chronic stress can have far-reaching effects at the cellular andgenetic level. In humans, excess glucocorticoids in the prenatal brain of thefetus directly affect levels of dopamine, which, as we saw earlier, is involvedin reward or pleasure seeking. Prenatal stress may also have downstream effectsas infants grow up, including learning disabilities, higher susceptibility todrug abuse, and increased anxiety and depression. Maternal stress has also beenlinked with increased HPA axis activity at different ages of the child,including at six months, five years, and ten years, and onward to adulthood.Disturbingly, in animal studies these elevated levels of glucocorticoids lingergenetically into the next generation or two.We don’t offer any of this information to alarm you, only to show that low-levelstress deserves to be called the epidemic of civilization. With its tentaclesreaching everywhere, no one is immune. The dilemma is that, being so pervasive,chronic stress causes too many things to potentially go wrong: experts havefound no single remedy that can cope with the unpredictable outcomes broughtabout by everyday stress. Let’s see how a healing lifestyle can do better.THE WHOLE-SYSTEM ANSWERYou won’t be surprised that the whole-system answer is to bring awareness intothe picture. Since the first ill effects of chronic stress are psychological andneural, this is where healing also begins. We’ve already mentioned that puttingup with stress and adapting yourself to it are bad strategies. Your cells aren’tadapting even when you think you are. A good example would be workers on thenight shift. Long stretches of night work disrupt the body’s circadian (ordaily) biorhythms. As a result, the most obvious detriment is the loss of goodsleep, which has long been known—the brain never fully adjusts to a schedule ofnot sleeping at night. But further investigations have revealed that night-shiftworkers are at risk in seven other ways:Higher risk of diabetesIncreased likelihood of obesity because of hormonal imbalance affecting hungerand satiationIncreased risk of breast cancerNegative metabolic changes that could influence heart disease riskPotential increase in heart attacksHigher likelihood of workplace accidentsHigher risk for depressionIn short, the whole system is potentially affected due to putting too muchdisruption in a single biorhythm that turns out to be connected to otherbiorhythms, like the link between sleep and hunger-satiation. It also seems thatthe obvious solution—quitting your night-shift job—may not be enough to reversethe damage if someone has been working too many years at night.The basic lesson for everyone is that stressors aren’t isolated things. Ablanket behavior or attitude can spread its bad influence very widely. Let’s sayyou’re at the airport and find out that your flight has been canceled. Theairline won’t bring another airplane into service but tells you that you mustwait five hours until a flight arrives that can accommodate you. With noalternative except to comply with the airline’s mistreatment, passengers lookpassive as they sit and wait, but on the inside many people (perhaps you) willreact with the following responses: worry, complaining, and pessimism. All areself-defeating.Worry is self-induced anxiety. It solves nothing and blocks the possibility ofdealing with things more positively.Complaining increases tension and anger. As a display of hostility, itencourages other people to act hostile in return.Pessimism induces the illusion that a situation is hopeless. It fosters thebelief that expecting a bad outcome is always realistic, when in fact it isn’t.If you see yourself in any of these behaviors and attitudes, you are foolingyourself into believing that you are adapting to stress. As your bodyexperiences it, however, you have become the stressor yourself. That’s becausean external event (canceled flight) must go through an internal interpretationbefore it triggers the stress response. Unlike a crisis like losing your job, aflight delay belongs in the category of everyday chronic stresses. Which meansthat you have a choice to respond. Worry, complaining, and pessimism areunconscious responses. People who are stuck in them have become the victims ofold reactions that became glued in place because the person didn’t reevaluatethem.Some people handle a canceled flight better than others. Just as we gave you the“baby solution” for acute stress, here’s the “airport solution” for low-leveleveryday stress.THE “AIRPORT SOLUTION” TO CHRONIC STRESSDetach yourself from the stressor. At the airport people do this by reading abook or finding a place to be alone.Become centered. At the airport people do this when they shut their eyes tomeditate.Remain active. At the airport this means walking around instead of slumping in achair and waiting.Seek positive outlets. At the airport this might mean shopping, getting a chairmassage, or going to a restaurant.Rely on emotional support. At the airport the usual way to do this is by callinga friend or family member on the phone. (A short call announcing that you’ll belate won’t give you emotional support. The key is a conversation with someonemeaningful in your life that lasts at least half an hour.)Escape if you must. At the airport, if the airline’s behavior gets toooutrageous, it saves your psychology to reschedule and go home. (Of course thisis not always practical or affordable.)All of these things are positive adaptations, as opposed to the negativity ofworry, complaining, and pessimism. They bring awareness into a situation wherefalling back on passive acceptance isn’t the right answer. Beneath the attitudeof “I have to put up with it” lies stress. A canceled flight is usually notfixable by you, and it can happen anytime without warning. Therefore, it fitsthe two conditions that make stress worse: unpredictability and loss of control.You have the option of turning the situation around by interpreting it not asbad luck but as a non-stress, to which you respond by doing things you actuallywant to do, like meditating, connecting with a friend, or shopping. When youbecome adept at this turnaround, chronic stress is nipped in the bud. You cutshort a process that otherwise would have affected your body like Chinese watertorture, drip by drip.The “airport solution” applies right now as well. It describes a strategy forgetting yourself out of sympathetic overdrive. There’s a physiologicalexplanation for what happens. The sympathetic nervous system is balanced by anentirely separate set of nerves with opposing responses known as theparasympathetic nervous system. Instead of tension, it brings relaxation. Asnature designed them, the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems areantagonists, we can say. The temporary, drastic action of the sympatheticnervous system is countered by the continuous, balancing activity of theparasympathetic nervous system.Under chronic stress, we ask the sympathetic nervous system to stay on guard allthe time, until it gets out of its normal groove and begins to impair the normalstate of balance. At the same time, the relaxed, normal state of theparasympathetic nervous system gets blocked or sidelined. To get out ofoverdrive, you must enhance the parasympathetic side of the equation. This canonly be done by applying conscious choice, since left to its own devices, thetwo antagonists will keep doing what they are habituated to do. Absent theinfluence of stress, the automatic back-and-forth of sympathetic andparasympathetic takes care of itself; it is self-regulating. But stress ismetaphorically like leaning on a wall until steady pressure makes it buckle.As applied to a healing lifestyle, the “airport solution” needs to be activatedevery day, as follows:Detach yourself from the stressor. Make sure you have periods of downtime andalone time.Become centered. Practice meditation, the most desirable tactic, or at the veryleast find time throughout the day to shut your eyes in a quiet place and takesome deep breaths until you feel relaxed and centered. The best breathingtechnique, which we mentioned in connection with the workplace (this page[Chop_9780451495532_epub3_c003_r1.xhtml#page_41]), is to breathe in to a countof 4, then breathe out to a count of 6.Remain active. Getting up and moving around throughout the day stimulates thevagus nerve, one of the principal pathways of the autonomic nervous system. Yogais even more stimulating and is the best activity for switching from sympatheticoverdrive to heightened parasympathetic activity.Seek positive outlets. In this case, the word positive means anything that makesyou happy. Making time to be happy is a whole-system strategy, but that’s dryand abstract. Happiness is the philosopher’s stone for turning a stressfulsituation into a healing one. In psychological terms, this is why the best wayto build a happy life is to build happy days.Rely on emotional support. Modern society is more and more isolating, which wastrue even before the Internet and video games greatly accelerated the problem.There is no substitute for emotional bonding, and one thing almost always foundin happiness studies is that the happiest people spend an hour or even more perday being in contact, either personally or on the phone, with friends and familywho mean the most to them.Escape if you must. This is generally the hardest choice for most people, whowill endure stressful situations long after it is evident that escaping andwalking away is the right choice. Aggravated situations like domestic abuse areactually acute stressors. Significant life changes like divorce or switchingcareers must take many factors into account. However, on an everyday basis youshould give yourself the freedom to walk away from heated arguments, maliciousgossip, rude e-mails, perpetual complainers, worrywarts, and anyone who isopenly criticizing you.In the end, getting out of sympathetic overdrive, which doesn’t occur to enoughpeople, turns out to be the most important single decision you can make, becausethe benefits to the whole system are lifelong."},{"pageContent":"6THE BIGGEST SINGLE THING TO HEALWe’ve shown you enough proof of the whole-system approach to make a boldstatement: mind and body are one. If only one thing is healed in your life, itshould be the separation between mind and body. Right now, as most of us liveour lives, the self we call “me” hasn’t fully mastered the role of the healingself. The chief reason is a loss of wholeness. We have been taught to regard thebody as separate from the mind, which is really only a belief. When you look inthe mirror, what do you see? Without a second’s thought, anyone would say, “Myface.” But, in fact, your reflection is something you aren’t simply lookingat—you are reading it.You read indications of what mood you are in, whether you’re feeling fresh ortired, how old you are, and what the years have imprinted upon you. We talkedbefore about an invisible map that we all carry around in our minds about howlife and relationships work. But as a visible map your face—and your wholebody—symbolize the same things. As your story changes, so does the map. To quotea clever medical axiom, if you want to see what your thoughts were likeyesterday, look at your body today. If you want to see what your body will belike tomorrow, look at your thoughts today.Holistic has become a staple term in the wellness movement, but at a certainlevel it’s easier to live in separation. You are able to detach yourself fromwhat your body is doing. As a sad example, when presented with the possibilitythat a disease might have a mental component, some patients wail, “You mean Idid this to myself?” Self-healing for them comes with an accusation that theyare at fault. Yet other people have taken the bodymind to extraordinary heights,and in each case a new possibility is opened that applies to everyone. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------EXTRAORDINARY POSSIBILITIES--------------------------------------------------------------------------------What if you could wake up every morning for years at a time at precisely thesame minute on the clock? This was the case with the pioneering Americanpsychologist William James (although it seems to have been an unconsciousability).What if you could instantly make an allergy go away? Such a feat has beenrecorded with patients suffering from multiple personality disorder, where onepersonality has an allergy that vanishes when a different personality appears.In one case a child would break out in hives while drinking orange juice as hisallergic personality emerged at that moment, but he showed no symptoms ifanother personality was present.What if you could sit in a freezing ice cave overnight wearing only a thin silkrobe? Such a feat has been observed among Tibetan Buddhist monks who havemastered a meditation known as tumo, in which body temperature, which isnormally involuntary, comes under conscious control. At one extreme a Westernerwho has been submitted to medical testing, Dutchman Wim Hof, performs feats ofbody temperature control like hiking to a mountaintop in a blizzard wearing onlya pair of summer shorts or sitting submerged up to his neck in ice-filled waterfor several hours.Hof has his own explanation of how he arrived at his accomplishments: “I saidthe autonomic nervous system will no longer be autonomic.” The problem with thisstatement is that standard medical understanding holds that the autonomicnervous system cannot be affected voluntarily. A significant study from Holland,however, strongly challenges that understanding and comes down on the side ofHof.The study, published in 2014 in the Proceedings of the National Academy ofSciences, provides evidence for voluntary activation of one activity linked tothe autonomic nervous system, the immune response. Healthy volunteers “weretrained for 10 days in meditation (third eye meditation), breathing techniques(cyclic hyperventilation followed by breath retention), and exposure to cold(immersions in ice cold water).” The control group was not trained. Then bothgroups were injected with toxins from a strain of the bacteria Escherichia coli,commonly called E. coli. E. coli normally resides in the intestinal tract and isharmless, but there are pathogenic strains that cause food poisoning, forexample.After receiving the toxin, the trained group followed their voluntary techniqueswhile the control group did nothing. Blood samples were taken, and they revealedthat the trained group had a lower release of pro-inflammatory chemicals thatthe researchers connected to a profound increase in the hormone epinephrine,which is known to decrease inflammation. Besides showing that Wim Hof hadgrasped the link between his extraordinary physical control and the autonomicnervous system, the Dutch results could theoretically be used by sufferers ofpersistent inflammation, especially those with autoimmune diseases.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- As exotic as these examples may seem, almost anyone can successfully will a redspot to appear on the back of their hands or make their palms grow warm usingsimple biofeedback. In the age of wearables, medical inventors are seeking waysthat we can monitor signs of potential disease or stress through a wrist-worndevice that then allows us to return to a normal state of balance at will, againusing simple biofeedback.The big question is what a life built around the bodymind would be like andwhether it will create a quantum leap in well-being. We think it will, as italready has for the remarkable woman in the following account.TAO’S STORY: PEACE AND PASSIONOne couldn’t hope for a better example of someone who has lived a healing lifethan Tao. She has a striking physical presence with her almond skin and darkhair, being the child of a French father and an Indian mother. But it’s herpersonal presence that’s even more striking, a kind of smiling serenity all ofus would wish for when we reach Tao’s age, which is ninety-eight. She is alsothe world’s oldest professional yoga teacher, as acknowledged in The GuinnessBook of World Records. She stills teaches six to eight yoga classes a week inthe New York City area.When asked what her definition of yoga is, Tao replies immediately, “Union,Oneness.”When asked if she ever plans to retire, she laughingly replies, “I will teachyoga as long as I can breathe.”If you amass the facts of her life, it seems too unique and extraordinary toduplicate. Born Tao Porchon in 1918, she came from a prosperous family inPondicherry, the French-colonized area of India on the southwest coast. Hermother died giving birth to Tao, and she was raised by her aunt and uncle. Whenshe was eight, she walked into a room of the house to see a man sitting on thefloor while visitors and family members touched his feet, the traditional signof veneration in India.Tao speaks about all her experiences in a clear, articulate voice. “I was shooedfrom the room, and then one night my uncle woke me up early. ‘We’re going on atrip,’ he whispered. ‘Don’t tell your aunt. She’ll be worried.’ I had no ideawhere my uncle was taking me, but as it turned out, I joined the first of twomarches I made with Mahatma Gandhi. He was the man whose feet they were alltouching.”This singular event put Tao on a path she has followed her entire life, whosetheme is peace. The casual sight of young yoga practitioners on the beach gaveher an early interest in doing yoga herself, even though at the time, the 1920s,the practice was considered to be almost strictly for males. Tao grew up in aspiritual atmosphere, and under the guidance of spiritual luminaries like SriAurobindo, who was the most famous guru in that part of India at the time andwhose reputation spread worldwide, she developed her own conscious philosophy oflife. It is essentially heart centered, seeing love as the universal force thatcan heal all forms of separation.Tao believes strongly in going inward and listening to your heart. But there’sanother path she’s walked that seems to contrast with a life of meditation andyoga. Following one central belief—“There is nothing you cannot do”—Taotransformed her inner life into an incredible series of outward accomplishments.To list them all almost strains credibility. She was a peace activist marchingwith Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Stage acting, including a career in Hollywood,took up a portion of her life starting in the 1950s, preceded by cabaret singingin London during World War II. But there were other career arcs, as a wife whenshe became Tao Porchon-Lynch (she was widowed in 1982 and has no children); as aballroom dancer specializing in the tango, for which she has won hundreds offirst-place finishes; and perhaps most unlikely, as a wine connoisseur andwriter.The one thing she shows little interest in is her longevity. “Don’t focus onage,” she says with a touch of impatience. “It doesn’t exist.”There’s more, much more, but we’re not introducing Tao simply as a remarkableachiever, not even as a beautiful example of a life lived with both peace andpassion. Her achievements aren’t likely to be duplicated by anyone else, and herhistorical time, often spent in close proximity to movie stars, writers,activists, and political leaders, won’t come again. It’s not what makes Taounique that fascinates us, but what makes her an example everyone can follow.Strip away the uniqueness, and Tao has lived almost a century consciouslyshaping her own life. As a result, if you took a snapshot of any day in her longexistence on Earth, you’d see someone whoPut her inner life firstTrusted her feelings and intuitionValued the now as the source of constant renewalCultivated emotional resilience, refusing to be stuck in old wounds and setbacksActivated her core beliefs, turning her vision into actionPlaced her trust in love and spiritual growth every dayWe’d call this the model of a healing lifestyle. It’s not that Tao hasn’t hadher share of painful experiences, beginning with the death of her mother; theloss of her husband; and on the physical level, three hip replacements. Butinstead of converting these experiences into suffering, she has consciously donethe opposite—she has become even more dynamic and resilient. One might say thatfor Tao, only two kinds of experience exist, not the good ones and the bad ones,the moments of pleasure and the moments of pain, but experiences she cancelebrate and those she can heal. You can live your life the same way.FOOD FOR THOUGHTHere’s an everyday example of how the separation of mind and body createspractical difficulties in approaching a very familiar problem: weight control.Millions of people flirt with fad diets, and millions more have struggled foryears to lose weight and keep it off. How many times have you heard statementslike the following? Perhaps you’ve made them yourself.“I look in the mirror, and I hate what I see.”“My downfall is chocolate—it goes right to my thighs.”“After my divorce, I gained ten pounds so fast I couldn’t believe it.”“I’ve tried everything, but the weight just won’t come off.”“I lose a few pounds, but then I plateau and nothing happens.”These are expressions of a society in which obesity has become epidemic, and inwhich diets don’t work—fewer than 2 percent of dieters successfully lose atleast five pounds and keep it off for two years. Magazine editors know they canincrease sales by putting a new fad diet on the cover, promising how easy weightloss will be this time, thus feeding a fantasy that the public is all toowilling to indulge in. Yet amid all the worry, frustration, self-defeat, andwishful thinking that surrounds weight loss, why would uniting body and mindinto the bodymind make a difference?Because the underlying problem isn’t weight. Looking back at the typicalstatements listed above, all have in common that “I” am unhappy with “it,” thebody, which turns the normal act of eating into a struggle between what the mindis trying to achieve and what the body is actually doing. Here’s what the mindof a dieter is typically doing:Fantasizing about how much weight the dieter will loseBelieving that just one more try will do the trickHating how the dieter’s body looksStruggling to have more willpowerEnvying those who have “perfect” bodiesFeeling guilty and ashamed about being overweightPromising to do better tomorrowFeeling trapped in bad eating habits that refuse to changeThat’s an enormous amount of mental activity to dedicate to a project—losingfive pounds and keeping it off—that is predictably doomed to failure in the longrun. Every bit of this activity is futile because it ignores or weakens themind-body connection. The mind is disconnected from what the body is actuallydoing, which looks something like this:Processing more calories than it needsCoping with overloads of fat and sugarAdjusting to toxins in food, air, and water that often have unknown effectsDealing with low-level inflammation exacerbated by fast food and junk foodConfronting the ups and downs of irregular eating during the dayThe separation of mind and body isn’t rare or harmless. It lies at the core ofwhy diets don’t work. This is a totally unnecessary situation. As a bodymind,each of us is naturally equipped to do what the body and mind both actually wantto do: eat normally by following the signals of hunger and satiation.Two hormones, leptin and ghrelin, are secreted in a natural biorhythm. When thestomach is empty, its cells secrete ghrelin, sending a message to the brain thatyou register as feeling hungry. When you’ve had enough to eat, that’s the resultof a message from leptin, secreted by fat cells, which balances thehunger-satiation rhythm.In fact, obesity and leptin have both been implicated in risk for Alzheimer’sdisease. Epidemiological (i.e., population) studies have shown highercirculating leptin levels to be associated with lower risk of Alzheimer’s, whilelower circulating levels of leptin have been found in patients already sufferingfrom the disease. Leptin receptors are highly expressed in the hippocampus, thearea of the brain responsible for short-term memory, which is ravaged byAlzheimer’s. Leptin supplementation actually led to less Alzheimer’s pathologyin this brain region in mouse studies of the disease. This is yet furtherevidence strengthening the link between the gut and the brain.WEIGHT GAIN: YOUR BODY ISN’T TO BLAMEOne reason that early versions of weight-loss surgery were unsuccessful is thatwhen a gastric bypass or lap band procedure was performed, the stomach was leftintact, with a small portion sealed off in order to drastically reduce how muchfood a person could eat at any given time. Instead of consuming a complete mealof cheeseburger with fries, less than a third of that would be satisfying—orshould have been. Patients reported being extremely hungry even when theirsmaller stomach pouches were full, and the reason was that the whole stomach wasstill secreting a full amount of leptin and ghrelin.The lesson here is that you haven’t had enough to eat when your stomach is full.You’ve had enough to eat when your brain says so, specifically the region knownas the hypothalamus. When mind and body get separated, however, you can overrideyour brain, or rather, you can distort your relationship with your brain.Instead of listening to the natural biorhythm that governs hunger and satiation,you impose your own behaviors. Because you have free will, these can bepractically anything, but social norms today are already distorted, which meansthat you find young children setting in place lifelong habits to which the brainadapts:Continuing to eat after you’re fullEating excessive sugar and fatIngesting alcoholSnacking at all hours“Eating your feelings”Ignoring regular mealtimesConsuming an imbalanced or very limited diet (such as a diet very low invegetables and fiber)Eating too much because you’ve lost the dieting battle and don’t care anymoreIronically, the blame for the problem is usually placed on the body. The more itgains weight and loses its shape, the more likely a person will judge againsthis (or more likely her) body for not cooperating. But this lack of cooperationbegan elsewhere, in the weakened mind-body connection. Let’s look a bit deeper.As we already noted, two hormones, leptin and ghrelin, control hunger andsatiation. After leptin was first discovered in animals in 1994 by the moleculargeneticist Jeffrey Friedman and his colleagues, the New York Times led theirstory with an air of excitement: “It seemed almost too good to be true—a hormonethat makes animals, and maybe people, eat less and exercise more. Butresearchers say that is exactly what they have found.” Drug companies were eagerfrom the start to produce a drug to increase leptin levels, which in turn wouldsignal the brain to suppress appetite and increase physical activity.But the story quickly grew more complicated. To begin with, obese people alreadyproduce higher levels of leptin because they have more fat cells than people ofnormal weight. Why doesn’t the leptin curb their appetite? No one knows forcertain. The relevant factors include leptin resistance, where the receptors forthis particular hormone get overloaded—this is similar to the way overproductionof insulin makes a person less sensitive to it. Leptin and ghrelin are alsobrain chemicals known as neuropeptides. The brain’s receptor sites are probablyaffected by chronic overeating, but the story gets complicated here because thesame region of the brain that contains these receptors, the hypothalamus, isalso required to balance overall metabolism and control how much fuel isallocated throughout the body.Other clues point to problems with the pathways that lead from the hypothalamusafter it receives leptin, along with the possibility that not enough leptin getspast the blood-brain barrier. Add to this the genetic factor. Mouse studiesdating to 2004 at Columbia University indicated that leptin levels early in lifecan alter the brain’s circuitry, influencing how much food is consumed asadults. This seems to correlate with findings that infants who are fed too muchrun a higher risk of future obesity. To an extent not yet known, leptin may beable to train the brain by changing its circuitry, leading to altered appetite.A person can wind up at either extreme, being hungry for either too much or toolittle food.It’s intriguing that leptin can do this, but you are much more powerful in yourability to train your brain, because you can do it consciously. If you want toclose the mind-body gap in relation to how you eat, try the following simplemindfulness experiment. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------A PRACTICE FOR MINDFUL EATING--------------------------------------------------------------------------------When you do anything consciously, including eating, you override the brain’sdefault setting and communicate directly with the higher brain, which isresponsible for conscious thoughts and actions. Very often we eat unconsciously,without thinking or weighing the consequences of what we’re doing.You can change the situation with a simple mindfulness practice.The next time you eat anything, whether as a meal or a snack, do the following:Step 1: Pause before you eat the first bite and take a deep breath.Step 2: Ask yourself, “Why am I eating this?”Step 3: Whatever answer you get, take note of it. Better yet, write it down—youmight even start a mindful eating journal.Step 4: Make a conscious choice to eat or not eat.There is nothing more to do, but this simple practice can lead to majorbenefits. Your goal is to return to a normal biorhythm of hunger and satiation.When you pause to make a choice, your reason for eating should therefore be “I’mhungry.” But there are a host of other reasons we reach for food, like thefollowing:“I’m bored.”“I can’t resist.”“I need comforting.”“There’s no use letting all this food go to waste.”“I’m stressed out.”“I feel a craving.”“I’m depressed.”“I’m anxious.”“I don’t know why.”“I’m lonely.”“I’m sick of dieting.”“The other people I’m with are eating.”“There’s not much left. I might as well finish the package.”“I feel like celebrating.”When you ask yourself why you are eating, it’s likely that some of these reasonswill come into play. Don’t judge against them, and don’t force yourself toreject the food out of guilt. Mindfulness is a conscious state, nothing more orless. In this state you are self-aware, and that’s the key. When you areself-aware, change comes with less effort than in any other state. The end ofunconscious eating is often enough to turn around a person’s weight problems,especially if they are mild to moderate.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- As you can see, there is hope beyond dieting, a way forward for people who moan“I’ve tried everything. Nothing works.” A whole-system approach to weight lossends the struggle; no longer is your body the enemy and you its victim.THE CONSCIOUS DIETERWe aren’t discounting the value of research into how digestion works. An entireresearch career could be devoted to studying a single hormone like leptin—somealready are—and even then, its promise for weight reduction may remain out ofreach. (The drug industry offers a host of over-the-counter and prescriptiondiet pills, from so-called fat burners to appetite suppressants, but they areeither unproven, ineffective, laden with side effects, or clinicallyinsignificant.)At the same time, a host of self-defeating beliefs will stop having power overyou. In the psychology of overeating, there’s a vicious circle at work. Painfulbeliefs turn into excuses. As an example, take the belief “I’ve always struggledwith my weight, so I must have been born to be this way.” No attitude is moreself-defeating, and there is science to make this belief stick even harder.There are indeed genetic indicators to suggest that some people are likely togain weight.For example, it’s invaluable to know the specific gene that modulates how muchleptin is produced, because in some obese individuals, a mutation in this genecauses leptin deficiency, leading to uncontrollable weight gain. The story ofleptin is interwoven with the story of obesity in the general public, and everyclue is worth pursuing. But we covered how misleading the early promise ofleptin turned out to be, and in the same vein, the search for a single “fatgene” has been equally fruitless. At best, your genes account for only apercentage of the causes for being overweight—other factors are at work that youcan change, such as your psychology, eating habits, and attitudes passed on byyour family as a child. These factors are subject to free will when you learnhow to change them. The good news is that when change occurs, your genes willrespond, altering their activity in the direction of healing this problem.Many other beliefs keep the vicious circle going by turning guilt into anexcuse. How many of the following have you bought into?The belief that food can make you happy when you’re sadThe belief that being full is a state of fulfillmentThe belief that known risk factors (high fat, sugar, and salt) don’t apply toyou—you are protected by magical thinkingThe belief, this time unconscious, that the food you don’t remember eatingdoesn’t countThe belief that you don’t really care how much you weighThe belief that you don’t mind what other people thinkThese beliefs all deliver a double whammy. They give you an excuse to fall backon, but the excuses stoke defeat. The better the excuse, the worse the failure.In our approach, being realistic means that you break the vicious circle byexchanging fantasy for reality. We are counting on the positive effects ofrealism, even though many people look at their weight issues and fear the painof confronting themselves—looking in the mirror is already painful enough.It takes time, but consciousness is its own reward. In our own experience withmeditation, for example, we’ve seen people return to normal weight effortlessly.The enjoyment of being alive and awake took the place of eating, and when thathappens, the whole system begins to normalize. You only realize the futility offighting your body when you free yourself from duality. You are here to enjoyyour thoughts, feelings, desires, and hopes. We’ve singled out weight issuesbecause they strike close to home for millions of people, and because makingweight loss a pleasurable part of personal growth is the last thing most dietersthink is possible. But in the larger scheme, conscious living is the goal. Nowthat we’ve established how important it is to heal the separation of mind andbody, let’s unfold the enormous fulfillment that comes from living consciouslyevery day."},{"pageContent":"7MINDFUL OR MINDLESS?When we last met Harvard professor Ellen Langer, she was astonishing thepsychology world by sending seventy-year-old men into a time capsule andbringing them out seemingly younger. But time travel isn’t applicable toeveryday life. Having proved her point in spectacular fashion, Langer took up alarger cause: mindfulness. We’ve been using this term also, showing how beingmindful reaches beyond the word’s old association with Eastern spiritualpractices. Langer has totally Westernized mindfulness with the followingdefinition: Mindfulness, she said before a medical school audience, is theprocess of actively noticing new things, relinquishing preconceived mindsets,and then acting on the new observations. Our goal here, of unfolding a healinglifestyle, includes the same things.Langer was very blunt—everyday behavior is mindless most of the time. One of herfavorite examples, she said, comes from personal experience: “I once went tomake a purchase and I gave [the cashier] my credit card, and she saw it wasn’tsigned.” Langer dutifully signed the card, and the cashier ran it through themachine. She asked Langer to sign the receipt. “[The cashier] then compared thetwo signatures to make sure they were the same person,” Langer recalled. Shepaused, and it took a moment before the audience caught on and started to laugh.Why would two signatures need to be compared when you’ve just witnessed the sameperson signing both? Small instances of mindless behavior tie us to the past andblock the possibility of being alive in the moment, alert to possibilities wewill never see. In fact, Langer calls her pursuit of mindfulness “the psychologyof possibility.”In this book we leap ahead to the ultimate possibility, being conscious all thetime. But is that feasible when someone is inundated with deadlines, bills,their children’s schooling, and so forth? With so much stress and tension beinglobbed at us from so many directions, attention gets dulled. We become reactiverather than attentive. This is how mindfulness gets lost despite our bestintentions. Pause for a moment, though, and reflect on how your day has beengoing. If you’re like most people, you will find yourself spending much of yourtime in reactions rather than paying attention and being mindful of what’s goingon. As a result, you are living unconsciously while accepting that this isnormal. Which of the following things apply to you?WHAT AN UNCONSCIOUS DAY IS LIKEYou eat irregularly or on the run.You consume packaged or fast food.You feel bad about your body or your weight, just as you did the day before andwill the day after.You act rushed and pressured.You listen to your spouse and kids without really listening.You react negatively toward someone without examining why this is necessary orright.You don’t notice anything beautiful for the entire day.You worry about a nagging problem with no plan to solve it.You habitually take a dim view of the future.You are haunted by something painful from your past.You feel stuck and unfulfilled.You feel insecure or unsafe.You are lonely.You lash out at a friend without thinking.You play the victim.You fail to stand up for yourself.You behave like a people pleaser—you go along to get along.It’s amazing how many unconscious reactions and behaviors are taken to benormal. What’s really going on is that mindlessness is being normalized. Only byseeing this can you begin to change. There’s a major shift toward healing whenyou decide to stop allowing unconscious negative events to have power over you.There’s a spectrum of possibilities here, which can be pictured with a simplediagram:Unconscious [images/Chop_9780451495532_epub3_007_r1.jpg] ConsciousThis is a nonjudgmental way of depicting disaster and fulfillment. At the farleft would be a totally unconscious lifestyle, where everything that needs to behealed is unattended to, which ultimately leads to a disaster. At the other endis a completely conscious lifestyle, where every potential problem is paidattention to, making room for complete fulfillment. Few of us live at eitherextreme, completely in heaven or hell. We find ourselves somewhere in themiddle: Sometimes we act unconsciously. Sometimes we act with self-awareness.This gray zone becomes normal and acceptable, without the realization of thedamage being caused over time.BRENDA’S STORY: A TALE FROM THE GRAY ZONESeveral years ago a woman we’ll call Brenda caught a winter cold. The colddidn’t go away immediately but kept coming back. She put up with it, annoyed bythe hacking cough that developed. Then with great suddenness a fever set in.This, too, she ignored, until one night, the roof caved in.“I was sitting up in bed, sweating and very weak. My husband is a very caringman. He held me, reassuring me that everything would be okay. But I knew I wasvery sick. A friend dropped by with some chicken soup. She happens to be anurse, and after taking one look, she ordered me to go to the emergency roomimmediately,” Brenda recalls.This intervention probably saved her life, because the ER doctor told Brendathat she had pneumonia in both lungs, which severely compromised herrespiration. In fact, she was on the point of respiratory failure and had to beput on a ventilator. The normal treatment with antibiotics will generally knockthe infection out, but a blood test revealed that Brenda, unknown to herself,was diabetic. She had struggled with her weight since early adolescence, andtype 2 diabetes is very common in obesity. To keep her from fighting theventilator, the doctors kept her in an unconscious state, sometimes called aninduced coma, with massive doses of Valium. It was a drastic course, but theyneeded to carefully control and monitor her treatment.“I was stunned. Two days before it was just a cold, and now they were telling meI could die,” she says. “My life became a nightmare overnight.”For the next nineteen days it was touch-and-go. Being totally knocked out wasinterrupted by intervals in which she was brought back into a blurry state ofwakefulness. The doctors did this in order to check on how she was faringmedically, but Brenda found these episodes terrifying.“I’d wake up feeling totally anxious, wondering if I was about to die. I had nocontrol over my body anymore, and I was laid out in bed with needles and IVtubes and beeping monitors. It was the worst thing that ever happened to me.”Brenda wasn’t prepared for how hard everything was, and when the doctors toldher she was out of danger, that the pneumonia was gone, she went home stillfeeling anxious. She kept telling friends about her brush with death,reinforcing her sense of inner dread and loss of control. In some ways, she’dstayed in crisis mode, which wasn’t at all like her.At fifty-three, Brenda considered herself a strong woman who had spent alifetime striving to get ahead. She was much more than a survivor. Born in apoor working-class family, she never got past high school, but she knew insidethat she was different from the rest of her family. She was more aware of whatlife could offer, and with determination she set out at eighteen to write herown story.“I saw girls my age getting pregnant too early, settling into marriages theydidn’t want, or just thought they wanted. The men had dead-end jobs, most ofthem, and spent a lot of time drinking beer in front of the TV. It wasn’t hardfor me to leave it all behind,” she says.She had gone out into the world and made something of herself. In her own mind,Brenda had great self-control. She was a helper, aiding anyone in need. Shestarted a service to cook food for the homeless and was a leader in communitysupport groups. Over the decades between leaving home and reaching middle age,the conscious side of her life wasn’t lacking. But after the bout withpneumonia, everything seemed to unravel. Brenda felt depressed and stoppedseeing her friends as often. The dinner parties she loved to cook for becamemuch less frequent. On the medical front, her blood sugar came under controlwith daily insulin injections, but the doctors told her that the damage alreadycaused by her diabetes in some cases couldn’t be reversed.“I was going to three specialists a week. My eyesight was being affected bydamage to the retina. I began to have terrible intestinal pain, and they told meit was diverticulosis. My cold feet were due to decreased blood flow to myextremities.” Brenda laughs harshly. “I was falling apart. I couldn’t believeit.”This apparently sudden drop in the quality of life wasn’t sudden—everything hada history. The longest history belonged to the obesity. From it followed ahistory of elevated blood sugar levels, and other histories for Brenda’s damagedcirculation, digestion, and eyesight. She deserves sympathy and care—Brenda isseeking both and has gotten them—because the unconscious side of her life isdemanding payment. Distressing as her crisis has been, Brenda was leading anormal life with familiar ups and downs. Yet if you look at it realistically,she was deep in the gray zone.There’s an old proverb, “For want of a nail.” It comes from a nursery rhyme thatwas well-known to children in the past, before automobiles replaced the horse:> For want of a nail the shoe was lost.> > For want of a shoe the horse was lost.> > For want of a horse the rider was lost.> > For want of a rider the message was lost.> > For want of a message the battle was lost.> > For want of a battle the kingdom was lost.> > And all for the want of a horseshoe nail.So what was the nail that Brenda, and many, many other people, lost? They lostthe connection to their bodies, to nature, and to themselves. None of these canbe seen in isolation. Your body is how you relate to nature, and when thatconnection frays, you stop being yourself. By becoming more and more aware thatthe thoughts you think today and the actions that follow from those ideas andemotions are impacting your body in real time, your life gets transformed atevery level. The word level is misleading, however, because the bodymind mergeseverything into a single consciousness of who you are and what is happening toyou. Many of us have heard that what’s in the past is in the past. Yet yourpresent state is a result of your past. In many ways, the two are inseparable.We can’t change the past, but we can change the present.A skeptic would raise a hand and object. Brenda’s story is about medical issuesthat she had no power to heal. Consciousness is all well and good as a loftyaim, but everyone has medical issues that require treatment. How could someonein Brenda’s predicament help herself by the time she was a patient?This is a polite rendition of a skeptical argument that’s often rude and hardnosed. The myth that only drugs and surgery are “real” medicine dies hard. Weall wind up going to the doctor’s office for various reasons. That doesn’tnegate the healing self but only gives it another area to deal with.WORRY AND THE IMMUNE SYSTEMAs we mentioned earlier, mainstream medicine is biological, believing that themind must be centered only in the brain. In fact, not just doctors but mostscientists who consider the issue would declare that brain = mind. We’ve beensteadily breaking down the validity of this assumption—and it is an assumption,not a fact—by pointing to the intelligence displayed by the bodymind. Theinformation superhighway of the bodymind delivers messages to and from everycell using the same chemicals as nerve cells.What this implies is that cells are more mindful than we are. Take the immunesystem as an example. Unless it breaks down in some way, the immune system isnever mindless. But if you engage in mindless behavior, the effect is farreaching and can compromise the intelligence of immune cells. Let’s go deeperinto this interaction by introducing the growing field of psychoneuroimmunology(PNI), which studies the interaction of mental activity with the immune system.PNI is one of the few areas in which the traditional division between physicaldisorders and psychological disorders isn’t compartmentalized. We’ve alreadytouched on how long-term bereavement can take its toll on a person’s health(this page [Chop_9780451495532_epub3_c003_r1.xhtml#page_37]), including theirability to fend off disease. (During the first two grief-stricken semesters atschool after his father’s sudden premature death from a heart attack, Rudyremembers being constantly assailed with colds he couldn’t shake off. He didn’tknow at the time about the mind-body connection that turned sorrow intocompromised immunity.) The damaging effects of grief can also be quite rapid. Ina study involving 100,000 recently widowed spouses, death rates doubled in thefirst week of mourning.Since the mind is everywhere, imbuing every cell, PNI could potentially apply toany mental state as it affects the immune system. We’ll confine ourselves to amental activity everyone is familiar with: worry. Worry is mindless in a host ofways. It obsessively occupies the mind and keeps the person in a state ofstressful anxiety. It blocks rational solutions to problems and on its own doesnothing to provide a solution. Despite its lack of utility, worry is endemic insociety. After the 2016 presidential election, for example, Gallup polls showedan immediate sharp upturn in worry. But turbulent politics and presidentialraces in general increase the public’s level of worry. There’s anxiety about thefuture, which is the hallmark of all worrying.Worry can also serve a purpose. It motivates us to prepare for the worst and toget ready to face an oncoming challenge or threat. This is presumably why worryhas been preserved as an evolutionary trait. But when it becomes constant anduncontrollable, chronic worry can be very detrimental to health. Specifically,PNI research has shown that excessive worrying can compromise the immune systemand contribute to a host of disorders from heart disease to Alzheimer’s. Worryis based in “un-ease” and is just a stone’s throw away from “dis-ease.”For anyone who maintains that all you need to do is replace worry with hope,it’s important to note that worrying whether something bad will happen isn’t theexact opposite of hoping something good will happen. In both cases there is anunderlying uncertainty and insecurity about the future, which is accompanied byanxiety. Yet insofar as hope is a positive emotion linked to other positiveemotions like optimism and acceptance, the balance tilts greatly in its favor.While chronic negative emotions can literally kill, a positive outlook can helpthe outcome of diseases as diverse as cancer and HIV-AIDS. Conditions likeasthma and psoriasis/eczema can be improved by positive feelings and worsened bystress, depression, and anxiety.By what mechanisms do these effects, positive and negative, actually work? Thisis the main thrust of PNI, which traces its origins to the work of psychologistRobert Ader, former director of the University of Rochester’s Center forPsychoneuroimmunology Research. In 1974, Ader and his colleagues gave laboratoryrats water sweetened with saccharin, followed by a chemical, cytoxan, thatsuppressed their immune systems and made them nauseous. When the experimenterslater force-fed the rats with saccharin, even in very small amounts, the animalssubsequently died. The more saccharin they were fed, the more quickly the ratsdied. Ader concluded that after sufficient conditioning, the taste of saccharinalone was enough to suppress the immune system, directly causing a weakenedimmune response and thus leading to fatal bacterial and viral infections therats would have normally been able to fight off. For the first time, theintimate connection between the brain and immune system was being uncovered,giving birth to the field of psychoneuroimmunology, a term Ader coined. Thenotion that the immune system was totally autonomous had been radicallychallenged, the start of many findings along the same lines.In 1981, neuroscientist David Felten, then at Indiana University School ofMedicine, later at the University of Rochester, made another major discovery byconnecting nerves in the thymus and spleen directly to immune system cells. In1985, the soon-to-be-celebrated neuroscientist and pharmacologist Candace Pertmade a crucial breakthrough by discovering special miniature proteins in thenervous system, called neuropeptides, that interact with both neurons in thebrain and immune cells. The effects can be long lasting: neuropeptidesstrengthen synapses and even change gene expression in both nerve cells andimmune cells. Pert’s revolutionary studies, which were fundamental tounderstanding how the body’s messaging network operates, went on to prove thatneuropeptides were involved with a wide range of activities from social behaviorto reproduction, as well as immune response.Perhaps nothing has been more studied in PNI than the effects of stress, whichkeeps cropping up in every aspect of how people heal differently. In connectionwith immunity, chronic stress can suppress the immunity needed for rapidlyfighting off infections (innate immunity) or to make antibodies to defendagainst invading germs (adaptive immunity). Chronic stress has been associatedwith frequent severe infections and also with worse prognoses for cancer, heartdisease, and HIV-AIDS. Worry is a form of self-created stress associated withfear, and in Part Two we devote a lengthy section to stress reduction (this page[Chop_9780451495532_epub3_c013_r1.xhtml#page_191]).As intriguing as the findings of PNI have been in pinpointing the biology of themind-body connection, the power of that connection is still underappreciated.Pointedly relevant here is the case of Norman Cousins, longtime editor of theSaturday Review, a peace activist, and in his later years a highly influentialauthor on mind-body healing. His spontaneous discovery that laughter has healingpower was once widely discussed, but it’s worth repeating the details asrecounted on the website Laughter Online University:> In 1964 following a very stressful trip to Russia, [Cousins] was diagnosed> with ankylosing spondylitis (a degenerative disease causing the breakdown of> collagen), which left him in almost constant pain and motivated his doctor to> say he would die within a few months. He disagreed and reasoned that if stress> had somehow contributed to his illness (he was not sick before the trip to> Russia), then positive emotions should help him feel better.> > With his doctors’ consent, he checked himself out of the hospital and into a> hotel across the street and began taking extremely high doses of vitamin C> while exposing himself to a continuous stream of humorous films and similar> “laughing matters.” He later claimed that 10 minutes of belly rippling> laughter would give him two hours of pain-free sleep, when nothing else, not> even morphine, could help him. His condition steadily improved and he slowly> regained the use of his limbs. Within six months he was back on his feet, and> within two years he was able to return to his full-time job at the Saturday> Review. His story baffled the scientific community and inspired a number of> research projects.Cousins began a personal crusade to publicize his remarkable recovery and itsimplications for medicine, meeting with popular success but receiving strongresistance from the medical community, which was still a decade away from Ader’sexperiments with rats dying from the taste of saccharin. Cousins’s story isfirst cousin to the placebo/nocebo effect. Over fifty years later, figuring outhow to channel the mind-body connection into healing remains more mystery thanscience. But perhaps the simplest lesson is the one Cousins learned at theoutset, that turning worry and anxiety into laughter can make all thedifference.AT THE DOCTOR’S: BE YOUR OWN ADVOCATEThere’s a larger lesson to be learned from Cousins’s healing, which has to dowith not accepting medical treatment passively. As he recounted to a radiointerviewer,> I asked [my doctor] about my chances for full recovery.

We putourselves in the hands of the medical machine, which in reality rests uponindividual people—doctors, nurses, physician’s assistants, and so on. Humanbehavior involves lapses and mistakes, and these get magnified in medical care,where misreading a patient’s chart or failing to notice a specific symptom canbe a matter of life and death. The riskiness of high-tech medicine like genetherapy and toxic cancer treatments is dramatically increased because there is awider range of mistakes the more complex any treatment is. To be fair, doctorsdo their utmost to save patients who would have been left to die a generationago, but they are successful only a percentage of the time.Risk and mistakes go together, but the general public has limited knowledge ofthe disturbing facts:• Medical errors are estimated to cause 440,000 deaths per year in U.S.hospitals alone. It is widely believed that this figure could be grosslyinaccurate, because countless mistakes go unreported—death reports offer onlythe immediate cause, and many doctors band together to protect the reputation oftheir profession.• The total direct expense of “adverse events,” as medical mistakes are known,is estimated at hundreds of billions of dollars annually.• Indirect expenses such as lost economic productivity from premature death andunnecessary illness exceed $1 trillion per year.Statistics barely touch upon the fear involved when any patient thinks aboutbeing at the wrong end of a medical mistake. What the patient is all too awareof is the doctor visit that goes by in the blink of an eye. A 2007 analysis ofoptimal primary-care visits found that they last 16 minutes on average. From 1to 5 minutes is spent discussing each topic that’s raised. This figure is at thehigh end of estimates, given that according to other studies, the actualface-to-face time spent with a doctor or other health-care provider actuallycomes down to 7 minutes on average. Doctors place the primary blame onincreasing demands for them to fill out medical reports and detailed insuranceclaims. Patients tend to believe that doctors want to cram in as many payingcustomers as they can, or simply that the patient as a person doesn’t mattervery much.Along these lines, in 2016 renowned cardiologist Dr. John Levinson and Dr. CalebGardner published an op-ed piece in the Wall Street Journal titled “Turn Off theComputer and Listen to the Patient.” They maintained that the introduction ofelectronic medical records, which are currently mandated by health systems andgovernment, has “degraded relationships between clinicians and our patients” andcontributed to the “corporatization—and de-professionalization of US healthcare.” These concerned doctors support the Lown Institute in Boston, anot-for-profit committed to restoring professionalism and a sense of caring tohealth care. While they believe there is a rightful place for medical computing,all too often doctors have to spend more time dealing with our medical formsthan talking with the patient.As a result, there’s a new movement afoot to provide a personal advocate whostays in the doctor’s office with the patient. The advocate is basically someonewho represents the patient’s best interests in any medical situation. The personmight be a well-meaning relative who helps an older patient understand what’sgoing on, or who steps in to do attendant tasks like picking up prescriptionsand organizing medical bills. But more and more one sees the need for anadvocate who is professionally trained to buffer the mounting risks in ahealth-care system in which less and less time is spent between doctor andpatient. If we return to Brenda’s situation, the absence of an advocate provedcritical in several ways. First and foremost, she wasn’t told about theconnection between obesity and type 2 diabetes. If that had been done inadvance, years ago, the downward spiral in her health could have been prevented.Brenda popped in and out of doctors’ offices all the time, but what she wastreated for was narrowly defined by the symptoms she exhibited that week. No oneput the whole story together. And yet it was not the most complex story, so whathappened?It would be up to an advocate to find out, and needless to say, this has createdhostility from some doctors. Used to ruling their domain with absoluteauthority, few doctors want an overseer in the room asking questions, insertingtheir own opinions, and potentially finding fault. At worst, the specter of amalpractice suit looms. The movement for professional advocates, which is quiteyoung, insists that looking out for a patient’s best interests is benign. Themedical profession has its doubts.The upshot, for now at least, is that patients who want an advocate must playthe role themselves. At the heart of the problem is passivity. When we surrenderto medical care, whether at the doctor’s office, the ER, or the hospital, weshouldn’t surrender everything. Poking and prodding is intrusive. Undergoingvarious tests can be stressful. The minute we walk in the door, we becomelargely anonymous—a walking set of symptoms replaces the person. There aredoctors and nurses who take these negative effects seriously and who go out oftheir way to offer a personal touch. They should be saluted for their humanecompassion in a system that focuses more on impersonal efficiency.You may like your doctor and feel that he or she cares, but this doesn’t ruleout being your own advocate. Quite the opposite—the inherent stress in medicaltreatment is what you want to counter. First comes the stress of worry andanticipation, what is commonly known as white-coat syndrome. We all remember howafraid we became as children thinking about getting a shot from the school nurseor how scary it was sitting in the dentist’s chair even before the drill wasturned on. Studies have verified that anticipating a stressful situation cancause as great a stress response as actually undergoing the stress. In one studysubjects were divided into two groups, one of which gave a public speech whilethe other was told that they were going to give a speech but actually didn’t.Both groups became stressed out, but the researchers wanted to measure how wellthey recovered from the stress.Recovery involved three things: having heart rate and breathing return to normalas well as reporting lowered emotional responses like anxiety. The recovery wassimilar in both groups, indicating that a stress you anticipated but never wentthrough could potentially be just as damaging as the real stressor. Also, howpeople reported their emotional state as they were recovering was a goodpredictor of what their heart and respiration were doing. In other words, if youfeel emotionally stressed out, your body does, too—no surprise on this point.How does this apply to going to the doctor’s? First, as we mentioned, there isstress in anticipation as well as stress once you get there. Second, understress people become mentally confused and distracted. Third, the stress islikely to be highest when the doctor or nurse enters the room, at the verymoment when you need to be clearheaded. As your own advocate, you don’t want tosuccumb to stress at any point. Your goal is to ask the right questions, gethelpful answers, and understand what lies in store for the future. (Everyoneknows the frustration of leaving the doctor’s office and suddenly rememberingall the things you meant to ask but either forgot to or were too stressed out tobring up.)One big secret to overcoming the stress of medical care is to realize that it isaffecting you, and how. Be conscious of the main factors that make any stressworse: repetition, unpredictability, and loss of control. In terms of going tothe doctor’s or entering the hospital, repetition means that one stressful eventfollows another, such as undergoing several tests in a row or being asked thesame question repeatedly by different people. Unpredictability means that youdon’t know what the doctor and the tests are going to reveal. Loss of controlmeans that everything happening to you is dictated by outside forces. Let’s facethese factors one at a time.Repetition: In a medical environment you can feel like an object being pushedalong a conveyor belt, and at each stop stress gets repeated. It is oftenunavoidable that a battery of tests must be run or that different people aregoing to ask you the same question. The worst repetition is probably having toreturn to the doctor or the hospital repeatedly for the same illness ortreatment. One solution is to get off the conveyor belt mentally, which is doneby returning to a sense of normal life even though you are in an alien place.Simple measures like chatting with other people, meditating, listening to anaudiobook, doing some paperwork, or texting friends—in other words, everydayactivity you associate with being in your comfort zone—keep you in the normalworld.Unpredictability: In the age of the Internet, medical care doesn’t have to beanywhere near as unpredictable and foreign as it used to be. There’s a mountainof information about every aspect of illness and wellness, which millions ofpeople now avail themselves of. The best use of this information is to waituntil you know what’s wrong with you. The worst use is to anxiously stab in thedark based on the symptoms you have or think you have. When you are at thedoctor’s or in the hospital, ask somebody to tell you what to expect when itcomes to next steps. Waiting passively for an unpredictable event causes stressto mount. (Dentists, who are acutely aware of their patients’ anxiety in thechair, now regularly explain in advance the steps of the procedure, offeringreassurance along the way. They also try to be realistic about the level of painor discomfort to come, because sugarcoating this aspect of treatment builds uplack of trust, itself a form of stress.)Loss of control: Handing yourself over to the ministrations of a stranger is anenormous stress, but it must be done in medical treatments. Knowing that you aregoing to be in such a situation, there are a number of ways to feel more incontrol:• Be informed about your illness. Don’t relinquish your opportunity to find outexactly what is wrong with you. This doesn’t mean you should challenge yourdoctor. If you feel the need to inform your doctor about something you sawonline, you aren’t being confrontational, and most doctors are now used towell-informed patients.• If the illness isn’t temporary and minor, contact someone else who is goingthrough the same diagnosis and treatment as you. This may involve a supportgroup, of which many exist online, or simply talking to another patient in thewaiting room or hospital.• If you are facing a protracted illness, become part of a support group, eitherlocally or online.• Keep a journal of your health challenge and the progress you are making towardbeing healed.• Seek emotional support from a friend or confidant who is empathic and whowants to help (in other words, don’t lean upon someone who is merely putting upwith you).• Establish a personal bond with someone who is part of your care—nurses andphysician’s assistants are typically more accessible and have more time thandoctors. Ideally, this bond should be based on something the two of youshare—family, children, hobbies, outside interests—not simply your illness.• Resist the temptation to suffer in silence and to go it alone. Isolationbrings a false sense of control. What actually works is to maintain a normallife and social contacts as much as possible.Following these steps will go a long way to achieving the goal of patientadvocacy, which is to serve the patient’s best interests at all times. But thereremains a difficult unknown, the possibility of a medical error. Studies haveshown that adverse events are tied to factors you as the patient can’t control,such as fatigue from the long hours and grueling routine that nurses, interns,and residents suffer from. In the rush of hospital routine, it’s inevitable thatsome patients get shortchanged, overlooked, or treated incorrectly.Writing in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2009, Dr. TaitShanafelt says, “Numerous global studies involving nearly every medical andsurgical specialty indicate that approximately 1 of every 3 physicians isexperiencing burnout at any given time.” Dr. Dike Drummond posted on The HappyMD, a website dedicated to alleviating physician burnout, that to understand theproblem, think of drawing energy from a kind of bank account in three forms:physical energy (needed simply to keep going); emotional energy (for stayingengaged and compassionate); and spiritual energy (necessary for remembering yourpurpose and why you do what you do as a physician). With every patient there isa withdrawal from this energetic bank account. The trick is to keep enough inthe account balance for the sake of the next patient.As a patient, the more informed and inquisitive you are, the better. If you knowwhat should be happening, you’re in a position to spot when something might beamiss. But the whole area of medical mistakes is a fraught one, and the lastthing you want to do is to establish an adversarial relationship with the peoplewho are there to care for you. Here’s an outline of what to do and what toavoid.DODo be involved in your own care.Do inform the doctor and nurses that you like to be involved.Do ask for extra information when you need it.Do ask for a questionable event, like a pill you aren’t sure is the right one,to be checked with the doctor.Do tell somebody if you have gone out of your comfort zone.Do remain polite in all of the above.Do praise the doctor and nurses when it’s called for. A show of gratitudedoesn’t go amiss.DON’TDon’t act hostile, suspicious, or demanding.Don’t challenge the competency of doctors and nurses.Don’t nag or whine, no matter how anxious you are. Reserve these feelings forsomeone in your family, a friend, or a member of a support group.Don’t pretend you know as much (or more) than the people who are treating you.Don’t, when hospitalized, repeatedly press the call button or run to the nurses’station. Trust their routine. Realize that the main reason patients call a nurseis more out of anxiety than out of real need.Don’t play the part of a victim. Show your caregivers that you are maintaining anormal sense of security, control, and good cheer even under tryingcircumstances.Probably the most important finding about medical mistakes is that they arefrequently caused by lack of communication. The breakdown mostly occurs betweendoctors and other medical staff as orders get passed along that are confusing,impatiently or poorly stated, or otherwise lost in translation. As before, ifyou are well informed about your illness and treatment, you are in the bestposition to spot miscommunication. But to be realistic, this isn’t an area wherepatients can do very much, and the medical profession has proved very reluctantto deal with the problem, or even to recognize how serious it has become.Social categories matter here. Medical errors are the most likely to occur underconditions in which some groups are already disadvantaged. If you are elderly,poor, have less education, or belong to a racial minority, you aren’t in thesame position as someone who is younger, white, highly educated, and well to do.To no one’s surprise, privilege has its privileges. But even so, each of usshould take responsibility for what a patient can actually do to minimizemiscommunication, which meansBeing clear about how you describe your symptoms.Stating your expectations in a realistic way. Do you want relief from pain, acure, some signs of progress, or reassurance that the worst isn’t going tohappen to you? Patients have different expectations, and you need to be clearabout what yours are so that the doctor and other caregivers know.Speak up when you don’t understand something about your condition.Ask about side effects of the drugs prescribed to you.Don’t be afraid to inform someone if you didn’t get answers to your questions.We’ve gone into detail on this topic because it stands in for something biggerthan going to the doctor’s office. When you become an advocate for yourself, youare being conscious instead of unconscious, you are valuing self-care at leastas much as care from someone else, and in this attitude of self-care, you arebeing a healer.The patient advocacy movement arouses suspicion among doctors because itoverturns the routine of patient care that puts the doctor completely in charge.Change is likely to come slowly, with organized resistance on the other side.Likewise, if you tell a doctor that you are a healer, his reaction isn’t likelyto be positive. He’d assume, more likely than not, that you are usurping hisrole. But we hope you believe, after reading this far, that no such challenge isbeing mounted. Our bodies already make us self-healers. Our conscious andunconscious choices determine whether we are helping or harming the healingresponse.The most basic choice of all is to be mindful instead of mindless. Nothing aboutthis decision represents an attack on the medical profession. If you getinvolved in your own care and a doctor or caregiver acts offended, they arecommitting a medical mistake already. Good doctors welcome patients who are notonly involved but show every sign of both self-reliance and trust in the doctor.The two attitudes aren’t mutually exclusive, because in the end, doctors andpatients are joined in the same activity, promoting the healing response as bestthey can."},{"pageContent":"8THE HIDDEN POWER OF BELIEFSIn the steady progress of artificial intelligence, computers will never acquireone of the leading features of human intelligence: belief. A computer’s realityis entirely based on facts that can be turned into the digital language of onesand zeros. If cold calculation represents a better mode of thinking than ourmessy mix of reason and emotion, even that is an assumption that AI (artificialintelligence) champions believe in and skeptics don’t. Belief makes us morehuman—no other creature exhibits this quality of mind—but how beliefs actuallywork is still a mystery.Which of the following sayings is truer: “I’ll believe it when I see it” or“You’ll see it when you believe it”? Neither one, because despite the fact thatthey are opposites, each statement is a half-truth at best. Every physician inpractice has experienced the phenomenon of patients who die from theirdiagnosis. This refers to how hearing bad news can be so traumatic, a patientquickly declines even though the underlying condition may be treatable, or atthe very least allow for months and years of survival. Seeing isn’t believing inthese cases. Two people diagnosed with lung cancer can be shown x-rays that areessentially identical, and yet their survival can’t be predicted, nor would anoncologist expect it to be the same for both of them.There’s an old medical school joke about the woman who goes to the doctor forher annual checkup and tells him that she is afraid she has cancer. He puts herthrough a battery of tests and informs her that it’s good news. She’s completelyhealthy with no signs of cancer. She returns the next year and again tells thedoctor she thinks she has cancer, and once more the tests reveal no signs ofmalignancy. This goes on for decades. Finally the time comes, when the woman isseventy-five, that the doctor says, “I’m sorry to tell you this, but you havecancer.”“I told you so!” the woman exclaims in triumph.How do we manifest our beliefs into a physical condition? That’s the keymystery. Many doctors would cling to an entirely physical explanation, pointingto changes in the immune system or the brain. But those changes in ourphysiology are the evidence of what the bodymind is doing. Once you startdealing with beliefs, the elusive word why cannot be avoided. For example, it iswell documented that traumatic psychological events like being fired or losing aloved one lower a person’s immune response. It has also been shown that thebrain by itself can stubbornly “believe” in a falsehood. This is what happens inthe phenomenon known as phantom limbs, where an arm or leg has been amputated,but the patient continues to feel the shape of the missing limb. This phantom isoften accompanied by pain and discomfort. Even though the mind knows the truth,the brain is holding on to the physical equivalent of a belief.Quite often when our bodies do something we don’t like, “Why?” becomes morepersonal: “Why is this happening to me?” No answer that depends on purelyphysical causes is dependable. Even in simple everyday cases, a whole-systemapproach is needed. In the winter, for example, catching a cold isn’t just amatter of being exposed to the cold virus (rhinovirus). Some people have“emotional immunity” that protects them even if you give them a pure dose ofrhinovirus directly into their noses.That’s exactly what a team from Carnegie Mellon University and the University ofPittsburgh did with 276 adult subjects. The virus entered the bloodstream andinfected almost everyone. But only a certain percentage actually developed coldsymptoms. Why? The researchers thought that the difference was created byrelationships. This turned out to be right, and not just that, the effect couldbe quantified. Subjects were asked about how many social relationships they had,ranging from family and friends to clubs, schoolmates, church, and volunteerwork—a total of twelve categories. One point was assigned for each relationshipin which the subject made contact, either in person or by phone, at least oncein two weeks, so the maximum score was twelve.The key finding was that people who reported only one to three kinds ofrelationships were four times more likely to exhibit cold symptoms than thosewho reported six or more kinds of relationships. It wouldn’t seem all thatsurprising if someone with a loving mother who supplied sympathy and chickensoup had greater immunity than a lonely widower. But this study proved a bitbaffling because it was the number and diversity of relationships that counted,not their level of intimacy. Being embedded in a wide social network createdemotional immunity, even when physical risk factors like smoking, antibodies,exercise, and sleep were accounted for.As before, finding evidence of a bodymind phenomenon isn’t difficult. It’s the“why,” which originates in the mind, that needs to be unraveled. The best placeto begin is with the placebo effect, a term almost everyone is familiar with butone that has yet to be explained, despite years of trying.BEING YOUR OWN PLACEBOMedical advances depend on knowing reliably what works and what doesn’t. No onewants to take an ineffective drug or supplement. Perhaps you’re considering anover-the-counter homeopathic product. Will it work for you? Is it acceptable ifit works for only a percentage of people? These are basic questions, but thereis an X factor to consider. If you take the homeopathic and feel better from it,maybe the physical product isn’t actually causing the improvement, but only yourbelief that it would.The fact is that your beliefs, your conditioning since childhood, and even thegenes you inherited from your parents belong to the X factor. The homeopathic—orany other drug or supplement—only partially determines how you will respond totreatment. The placebo effect, which brings healing totally without an activemedical ingredient, is very enticing. If you could be your own placebo, thesafest form of healing would be at your disposal. Every cell in your body knowsexactly what it needs and takes nothing else. Could this be true of the bodymindas a whole? If so, we would only need to contact the level of the self thattotally supports our cells, consciously offering what they need.Before deciding if that’s a realistic possibility, let’s look deeper into thewhole phenomenon. Among physicians, the placebo effect has been fascinating,confusing, and frustrating at the same time. In practice, few if any doctorswould dare to treat a patient with a dummy pill in place of the real thing. Butin clinical drug trials the placebo effect must be ruled out; otherwise, theefficacy of the drug can’t be known.The word placebo means “I shall please” and was once used in a prayer—PlaceboDomino means “I shall please the Lord.” The religious association survives eventoday, because some of the placebo effect comes from the ritual of receiving amedication at the hands of a white-coated physician in the environment of hisoffice or the hospital. It wasn’t until the eighteenth century that the termplacebo was used to mean a decoy drug. In modern medicine, a pioneering Americananesthesiologist, Henry Knowles Beecher, carried out some of the earlieststudies of the placebo effect in the 1950s.Beecher had served on the front as a doctor in World War II, where he observedthat some severely wounded soldiers apparently felt so little pain that theyasked for no painkillers. Based later at Harvard and Massachusetts GeneralHospital, Beecher put forward in a seminal 1955 paper that the perception ofpain isn’t always dependent on the severity of an injury or illness. Today, thisprinciple is widely accepted—we know that the only reliable way to measure thelevel of pain is by asking the patient to rate his own pain. What seems like a10 to one person on a scale of 1 to 10, where 10 is excruciating pain, will berated a 7 or even lower by another patient.Beecher asked whether the perception of pain can be influenced by someone’sbeliefs and expectations surrounding a placebo drug. He went on to conduct aseries of clinical studies to test his hypothesis, eventually concluding that inroughly 35 percent of successful treatments, the placebo effect was at work.This finding rocked the medical world at the time, and the shock waves onlyspread wider in the coming decades. In later studies, it was found that theplacebo effect was even more prevalent, accounting for up to 60 percent oftherapeutic effects. For example, in a study of leading antidepressants(chemically known as fluoxetine, sertraline, and paroxetine), 50 percent of thepositive outcomes were due to the placebo effect and only 27 percent to thedrugs themselves.Beecher’s findings also had indirect effects on the medical profession. Forexample, over the next half century, doctors’ attitudes about telling patientsthe truth changed radically. It had been accepted practice not to inform apatient of a fatal diagnosis, for fear that the news would do more harm thangood. When Emperor Hirohito of Japan was diagnosed with intestinal cancer inSeptember 1987, he wasn’t told by the court physician and had no idea of hiscondition up to his death in January 1989, more than a year later. We live in anera of truth telling today, and every patient expects as a matter of course tobe told their diagnosis. But the other side of the placebo effect, the noceboeffect, is also real; the belief that things are going to turn out badly exertsits own powerful influence.The nocebo effect can be self-induced. In a 2017 study of over 1,300 patientswho had been diagnosed with nonceliac gluten sensitivity, 40 percent turned outto have no actual sensitivity to gluten when tested in a blind clinicaltrial—that is, the patients didn’t know whether they were receiving actualgluten or not. In only 16 percent of the cases were gluten-sensitive symptomsfound despite previous diagnostic testing. It was concluded that the 40 percentwith no symptoms after receiving gluten may have experienced the nocebo effectin everyday life when they showed symptoms.A strange and fatal form of the nocebo effect occurred in an epidemic of peopledying in their sleep in the 1980s. In this case, dozens of Southeast Asianimmigrants, men in their early thirties, began dying, always in their sleep,thousands of miles away from their homeland. This mysterious occurrence centeredon males of the Hmong people (also known as the Mong), a mountainous tribespread from Laos to China. Here, they also had in common that they originallycame from Laos. This medical mystery acquired the name of sudden unexpectednocturnal death syndrome (SUNDS).Interviews would later reveal that the Hmong men were being killed by theirbelief in the spirit world. They were dying in their sleep of heart attackswhile they were being literally “scared to death,” as survivors reported theexperience. The common feature medically was “sleep paralysis,” a harmlessnatural occurrence that happens to everyone in deep sleep, in which the limbsbecome immobile. But here the paralysis was part of a lucid, or waking, dream,in which the dreamer believes he’s no longer asleep and finds to his horror thathe’s paralyzed.Sleep paralysis has long been associated with nocturnal evil in many cultures.In Indonesia, it’s called digeunton (“to press on”), in China bei gui ya (“heldby a ghost”). The word nightmare is derived from the Dutch nachtmerrie, in whichthe “mare” is a female supernatural being who lies on dreamers’ chests andsuffocates them. In many parts of the West, it’s called “Old Hag” syndrome. Theterror of being unable to move, combined with the preexisting cultural beliefthat this state involves an evil being, was enough to induce cardiac arrestamong the Hmong men.—Because a placebo is a two-edged sword, various issues arise. For instance, cana placebo wind up having the reverse effect, actually harming the patient?Consider one study that pushed the envelope on the efficacy of antidepressants,suggesting that up to 75 percent of success in treating depression was due tothe placebo effect. The public has reacted badly to the headline“Antidepressants Don’t Work,” because it undermines their faith in a pill theywish worked. Being told that they were in essence duped left many feeling alone,isolated, and helpless in the face of their depression. But drug dependency hasremained at high levels for this disorder. Prozac Nation wasn’t prepared to turninto Placebo Nation—and it didn’t. The market for the most popularantidepressants has only increased.Moreover, you don’t even need a pill to create a placebo effect. When patientswith irritable bowel syndrome underwent a sham acupuncture treatment in whichthe needles never actually penetrated the skin, the researchers found that astriking 44 percent of subjects reported improvement of their symptoms,including the digestive problems and pain associated with irritable bowel.Moreover, when the sham procedure was combined with positive reinforcement andencouragement from the acupuncturist, fully 62 percent of subjects reportedimprovement.For a long time, explaining the placebo effect was like entering a black box, ascientist’s term for a phenomenon that doesn’t connect cause and effect. Here,no one knew what happened between administering the placebo and later observingits effect, or lack of effect. Medicine was hampered by an apples-and-orangesmentality, because the physical nature of a sugar pill (the apple) didn’t matchthe psychological nature of whatever the pill was doing (the orange). With awhole-system approach we aren’t saddled with this dilemma, because there is noblack box. The placebo effect works because it crosses the artificial boundarybetween mind and body. Here’s a diagram to show what happens:Placebo [images/Chop_9780451495532_epub3_006_r1.jpg] Interpretation[images/Chop_9780451495532_epub3_006_r1.jpg] OutcomeNothing truly foreign is occurring in the placebo effect—quite the opposite. Anyexperience you have undergoes interpretation before it has any effect. In aclassic placebo experiment, patients suffering from chronic nausea were given adrug they were told would make their nausea go away, and in around 30 percent ofcases this happened. What they weren’t told was that the drug in questionactually causes nausea. So the power of interpretation went beyond sugar pillsthat improved symptoms despite the pills’ innocuousness; now experimenters sawimprovements despite the physical action of the drug. As shocking as Beecher’soriginal findings were, this new wrinkle has yet to impact the medicalprofession as much as it should.There’s no need to unfold a litany of the numerous placebo/nocebo trials thattogether reach the same conclusion. But to underline how indisputable the effectis, we want to show how blanket the effect is—it extends beyond sham drugs toprocedures as drastic as sham surgery, and the whole system is potentiallysubject to the placebo effect, far beyond the initial observations about pain.Here are some research highlights:• In a 2009 trial, patients were treated to alleviate the pain due toosteoporosis; the procedure consisted of repairing damaged vertebrae withinjections of bone cement. The placebo group didn’t receive the injection;instead, the doctor put pressure on their spines while allowing them to smellthe medical cement. Both groups reported the same level of pain relief. In theend, the placebo results helped to invalidate the efficacy of the actualprocedure, since shown to be effective, it would have to outperform a shamprocedure. (This still begs the question of how valuable it might be to relievepain strictly by relying on the placebo effect.) But what if those on placeboalso benefited simply based on their belief in the promise of the treatment?• In his career as a leading Alzheimer’s researcher, Rudy has tracked thedisease at the genetic level to discover how to combat the senile plaques thatlitter the brains of Alzheimer’s patients and destroy nerve cells. He activelyparticipates in the urgent mission to develop drugs to stop the buildup of theseplaques. A small trial was conducted on a promising new medicine developed inAustralia called PBT2, which was aimed at clearing existing plaque away.As a placebo, subjects were given an inert red pill, and plaque levels wereassessed before and after the treatment using brain imaging. Subjects given thePBT2 did show less plaque on average after taking the drug, but so did theplacebo group, to a lesser extent. Unfortunately, this was enough to rule thetrial drug a failure. In the larger picture, however, it’s remarkable that aplacebo can lead to an actual physiological change, not simply a patient’ssubjective sense of reduced pain and discomfort. If belief and expectation canalter the brain, how far does their power extend?• Because belief is so crucial in the placebo effect, it would seem thatdeception is necessary in order to trigger a patient’s trust in the actual drughe might be taking. But Ted Kaptchuk, a leading placebo researcher at Harvard,is investigating the possibility of doing away with the element of deception. Hetells patients up front that they will be taking a placebo, but he also informsthem about how powerful and effective placebos can be. In one trial withirritable bowel syndrome, it was found that roughly 59 percent of those on anopen placebo treatment reported improvements, as compared with 35 percent of thecontrol group that received no treatment. The results may seem modest, but theymake the point that giving a placebo isn’t the same as doing nothing, alingering prejudice that still exists in some medical quarters.HOW TO CHANGE YOUR INTERPRETATIONAlthough the actual cause of the placebo effect is unknown, there is no doubtabout the crucial role played by belief, expectation, and perception. As farback as 1949 the pioneering researcher Stewart Wolf proposed that the placeboeffect was greatly influenced by personal perception, writing that “themechanisms of the body are capable of reacting not only to direct physical andchemical stimulation but also to symbolic stimuli, words and events which havesomehow acquired special meaning for the individual.”We generally don’t think that symbols shape our sense of reality, much lessshape our bodies. But when you were sick in bed as a child, by taking a smallwhite pill with the expectation of getting better you entered the world ofsymbols. The contents of the pill were unknown to you, but it symbolically stoodfor getting well, and more symbols began to draw a map in your head. Pause for amoment and see if you agree or disagree with the following statements aboutdoctors:Agree/Disagree: If you want to stay well, keep away from doctors.Agree/Disagree: Health-care costs will never go down if doctors have anything todo with it.Agree/Disagree: Doctors ask us to trust them, but that’s hard when one medicalstudy says A and the next study says the opposite of A.Agree/Disagree: Doctors are in the pockets of the big drug companies.Agree/Disagree: Most doctors want to get you out of their office as fast aspossible.Rationally speaking, each of these statements can be fact-checked, but mostpeople will immediately agree or disagree based on other criteria—their good orbad experience with medical care, stories they get from the media, biasesacquired from friends and family, good or bad feelings toward upper-incomeearners, and so on. We rarely bother to untangle our personal reasons for makingsnap judgments, and yet we also don’t want to back down when facts are actuallybrought to bear. Those negative statements about doctors turn them into symbolsof bad personal traits: greed, incompetence, selfishness, callousness, and evenoutright dishonesty.Symbols are so powerful that the rational mind has a difficult time laying themto rest. Compared with the certainty and simplicity of a snap judgment, thecounterarguments against those same negative statements are boring and cautious.For example,Not all doctors fit a blanket description.It would take statistical studies to verify how many doctors actually do exhibitthese bad traits.Such studies are likely to be unreliable because judgments are so subjective.For each bad thing a doctor is accused of doing, he deserves to tell his side ofthe story.We could have presented a set of positive statements instead that turn doctorsinto positive symbols of professionalism, education, caring, dedication,compassion, and selflessness. An unscrupulous Medicare cheater committing fraudin a Florida pill mill symbolizes something very different from a member ofDoctors Without Borders combating an Ebola outbreak in West Africa. Depending onhow you have responded since childhood, these symbols have become ingrainedinside you as belief, habit, conditioning, fears, and preconceived notions. Allexist on a sliding scale between very positive and very negative. Therefore,placebo/nocebo extend far beyond the usual definition. No one can say withauthority how a symbol, seemingly so abstract and impalpable a thing, can createchanges in the physiology. But our discussion of the placebo effect leaves nodoubt about the fact that personal experiences get metabolized as much as food,air, and water get metabolized. In theory you could follow every molecule in abit of broccoli to see where it wound up in the body, but that’s not true of anexperience, because the mind-body links are invisible to begin with and onlytrigger physical effects at a later stage of chemical reaction.Alia Crum, a Stanford psychologist who led a 2017 study calling for moreresearch into the nonphysical aspect of healing, encapsulates the issuesperfectly: “We have long been mystified by the placebo effect,” she says. “Butthe placebo effect isn’t some mysterious response to a sugar pill. It is therobust and measurable effect of three components: the body’s natural ability toheal, the patient mindset, and the social context. When we start to see theplacebo effect for what it really is, we can stop discounting it as medicallysuperfluous and can work to deliberately harness its underlying components toimprove health care.”Being your own placebo obviously would be impossible if you had to foolyourself. Kaptchuk’s tactic of eliminating the element of deception opens thedoor to a different approach, but even here, the symbolic effect of a physiciantelling you that a placebo can be powerful medicine counts for something.Telling yourself that you might get relief from a migraine headache orlower-back pain by taking a sugar pill isn’t viable—you might as well dispensewith the pill and drink a glass of water. But you can activate the placeboeffect by instilling the one thing that triggers it: a positive belief in beinghealed.THE QUALITIES OF A HEALING BELIEFIt must be convincing enough to inspire confidence.It must dispel a negative belief.It must have personal meaning for you.It has to bring positive results.It must be reliable and repeatable in its effects.Each of these criteria is realistic and nonmystical, although some would arguethat the potent effects of phenomena like faith healing, psychic healing, andindigenous cults like voodoo are entangled with everything on the list. Takingno position on faith healing, we endorse the power of having faith inyourself—that’s where control of the healing response comes from. But there aremany levels of confidence a belief can instill. Hearing a friend say “I’m sureyou’ll get better” has very little effect compared to having a highly respectedphysician tell you the same thing. Yet nothing is as powerful as building yourown belief system and, more important, knowing that everyone’s belief system isdynamic and can change on a dime. Imagine that you are going to a party at theinvitation of a friend, and knowing nothing about what to expect, you ask on theway to the party who is going to be there. Your friend might reply:“Just some boring people from the office.”“The Broadway cast from Hamilton.”“A group of civil rights activists.”“Some convicts who just got out of prison and want a fresh start.”These responses will have wildly different effects on your belief that you willenjoy the party or not. They trigger everything we’ve been talking about withthe placebo effect, including expectation, perception, outcome, and symbols. Wegather them together under the heading of interpretation, the process that turnsthe data of an experience into an actual experience. Interpretation can bethought of as a series of filters. When you set eyes on something, hear words,or confront an everyday situation, your filters ask:Do I want this experience or should I shut it out?How much of this is going to feel good? How much is going to feel bad?Have I been here before? If so, how did I react?Is this something that needs my attention right now?Do I need to say or do something?Do I even care?Once you are conscious of the process of interpretation, you can change anyaspect of it. At the opposite extreme you can react mindlessly with a defaultresponse, like a child who hates spinach no matter how much coaxing her parentsdo. The point in this chapter is that your cells are listening to yourinterpretation and respond to it as their own experience. “I hate spinach” cantrigger a gag reflex (or pretending to have one), and by association theparents’ blood pressure could go up.So let’s accept that your beliefs, and all the other elements of interpretation,are activating bodily responses all the time. It’s your conscious choice to makeany situation a healing one, beginning with your choice of beliefs. The mosthealing beliefs would include:I expect to be happy and well.I’m in control.Whatever needs to be faced, I’m up to the challenge.I feel safe and unafraid.I’m supported by family and friends.I am loved and I love in return.I accept who I am.Notice that only the first belief, “I expect to be happy and well,” touches uponhealth and then only by implication. The other beliefs pertain to how you relateto yourself. The main point of this book is that everything comes down to theself. In large part, your “self” is a system of beliefs. A belief isn’t like acoat you can put on or take off. It’s more like a piece of invisible geneticcode that has helped to create you as a person.Among the beliefs that hinder healing, almost all are simply the reverse of ahealing belief:I expect to be unhappy and get sick more often than most people.I’m not in control of my life—a lot depends on people and circumstances beyondmy control.Many challenges would be too hard to bear.I’m subject to anxiety and worry about the bad things that could happen to me.I’m pretty much alone and have to look after myself without support from others.I don’t have much love in my life.I judge against myself.We realize that, on both the positive and negative sides of the equation, thesestatements aren’t couched in the form “I believe X.” But peel away the sentimentbeing expressed, and even something that looks like a statement of fact (“Iaccept who I am” or “I’m subject to anxiety”) can be traced to a belief that isbeing masked. “I’m subject to anxiety,” for example, could mask any manner ofbelief, such as “The world isn’t a safe place,” “It only makes sense to beafraid,” “Fear keeps me vigilant and alert,” or “I was made this way,” to givejust some leading possibilities.The process of transforming your beliefs in the direction of healing isn’tmysterious. It just breaks down negative beliefs step by step.1. When you catch yourself saying anything that’s negative, ask, “Is this reallytrue?” Exposing an automatic reflex to rational questioning is an important stepin letting go of it.2. When you start to examine a negative belief that has come up, ask, “Is thisreally helping me?”3. Be detached from the negative beliefs of others—secondhand infection happensfrequently.4. For every negative belief you expose, offer yourself two positive beliefs.5. Journal about your journey of self-exploration. Write down any changes inyour belief system that you see are happening, or simply that you want tohappen.6. Spend more time with supportive, loving, inspiring, and generally positivepeople. Avoid the opposite kind of people.7. Value the whole project of self-care and increasing your state of well-being.We want to particularly reinforce step 4: For every negative belief you expose,offer yourself two positive beliefs. This is a powerful way to become thecreator of your own belief system. If you don’t, you will passively accept allkinds of secondhand unproven beliefs that will continue to be in charge. Trycreating new beliefs by writing them down, and take the time to choose beliefsyou have some confidence in, not random or abstract possibilities. For example:Negative belief: I can foresee the worst-case scenario, and it’s bound to cometrue.New beliefs: I can’t really see the future. Dwelling on the worst-case scenariodoesn’t help me. If I am open to other possibilities, I’m more likely to find abetter outcome. A lot of times I’ve thought the worst-case scenario would playout and then it didn’t.Negative belief: I’m no good in a crisis.New beliefs: Asking for help doesn’t mean I’m weak. I can learn how to deal withthis crisis by consulting someone who has survived the same thing. No one says Ihave to do this alone. I’ve survived a lot so far. A crisis can also be anopportunity. There’s a solution to every problem if you look deep enough.Even though each of these beliefs, whether negative or not, isn’t the same as astatement of fact, it has the magical property of turning into a self-fulfillingprophecy. Reality goes where belief leads. How? For a group of medicalresearchers the question may come down to genetics, which can strongly influenceone’s predisposition to the placebo/nocebo effect. Predicting who is more likelyto benefit from a placebo is potentially very important for clinical trials ofnew drugs. In the search for genetic links, a set of genes has already beentermed the “placebome,” in keeping with the term genome and more recentoffshoots like the microbiome. The identification and characterization of theplacebome is still in the earliest stages, but some compelling clues havealready come to light. Genes involved with the brain neurochemical dopamine,which is associated with risk taking and reward, as well as other genes involvedwith opiates, pain relief, and even cannabinoids (molecules produced by thebrain that are analogues of the active ingredients in marijuana), have beenimplicated. Given the whole-system nature of the placebo effect, a complex webof processes is very likely at work, going all the way to the level of ourgenes.No one knows where the genetic trail might lead. In the meantime, for anyoneleading a healing lifestyle, negative beliefs must be exposed to light beforechange is possible. It’s fascinating to discover that the words we apply to oursense of being conscious, like alert, vigilant, self-aware, and awake, alsoapply to our cells. As we’ll see in the next chapter, the healer’s role is mucheasier to adopt once you realize that you are just expanding one of nature’sgreatest gifts, the wisdom of the body."},{"pageContent":"9THE WISE HEALERIt’s a major step to realize that body and mind should be considered thebodymind, thus curing the state of separation. But we can go a step further andreach a deeper level of healing. Not only deeper, but easier and more natural.This step involves the wisdom of the body, which too many people ignore or don’tbelieve in. If your body and mind were law partners, they’d hang out a shinglewith Mind, Esq., first, because the general consensus says that the minddeserves to be the senior partner.In contrast, the body supposedly understands nothing. The image in the Book ofGenesis of God creating Adam out of a lump of clay has had a far-reachingimpact, even though the lumps are now clumps of cells. Pause for a moment toanswer the following questions:Which is smarter, the body or the mind?Which is more creative?Which is wiser?Which are you prouder of right now?If you think more highly, right this minute, of your mind than your body (anyonepast the age of fifty will sympathize), then you have bought into old beliefsthat need revising. The intelligence of the body is millions of years older andfar deeper than the rational mind. The body deserves to be equal in the bodymindpartnership. The practical result of this realization is to become a wisehealer.CONTROL BY THE HOSTThe wisdom of the body exists everywhere. Scientists and laypeople alike havedeveloped the habit of exalting the brain as the only place where intelligenceresides. By now, having seen how the body’s information superhighway works, youknow that messaging is a constant process that involves all 50 trillion cells.But this doesn’t dispel the worshipful regard that has been directed at thebrain. After all, can a liver cell compose Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony? Can akidney cell understand E = mc2? Actually, the body performs feats ofintelligence that leave those two examples in the dust.Since our topic is healing, let’s look at the central player in protecting thebody from harm, the immune system. In medicine we talk about “control by thehost,” which means that after a disease organism (pathogen) enters the body,only a certain percentage of people will become infected, and only anotherpercentage will exhibit symptoms. The reason that everyone doesn’t get sick isthat the body runs a multilayered defense to control everything happening insideus. Control by the host is a natural phenomenon that begins with a series ofphysical defenses dating back tens of millions of years. An open wound exposedto the air puts you at high risk for invading pathogens, yet if you stop andthink, your lungs are just as exposed and open to the air as an open wound.The difference is that the respiratory system is lined with mucus, which catchesinvading dust and germs like flypaper. In addition, each breath you take mustfollow a long, convoluted path before reaching the delicate membranes whereoxygen is exchanged with carbon dioxide, and all these byways block or trap moreinvaders.The skull and spinal vertebrae are formidable defensive walls, because fewpathogens can make it through bone. Your skin is a much softer barrier, but itis more defensive than you might think: the dryness of the skin’s surface andthe salt left behind from sweating make a poor environment for pathogens tomultiply in. Where the skin has natural openings, there are other defensivemeasures like the flow of tears that drain debris from the eyes and the acidityof vaginal secretions. Tears, saliva, and nasal secretions contain lysozyme, anenzyme that breaks down the cell walls of bacteria.Inevitably this first line of defense proves inadequate, because the sameprocess of evolution that creates defense mechanisms also creates invadersbetter equipped to get past them. When a pathogen makes it inside the body,usually as a bacterium or virus, hand-to-hand combat is necessary. You’llremember video footage of white cells moving in on an invader, surrounding it,and gobbling it up. The immune cells responsible for this are macrophages(literally “big eaters”). Behind a process that looks as crude as a boaconstrictor swallowing its prey whole lies incredibly complex chemicalmessaging. We’ll dwell on just one aspect in order to show that calling theimmune response intelligent isn’t an exaggeration.Take the simplest example: catching a cold. Everyone assumes that catching acold is a physical process. The person is exposed to the cold virus, it entersthe bloodstream, usually by being inhaled, and as the virus multiplies, astruggle goes on between it and the body’s immune system. In a healthy child oradult, the immune system wins. The bloodstream is littered for a few days withtoxins from the virus, along with the residue of dead viruses and the dead whitecells that gobbled them up. In a week the body is cleared of invaders, newantibodies have been formed to protect against the same virus trying to sneakback in again, and you are once again well.The whole thing looks absolutely physical, but descend to the meeting pointwhere a single cold virus, inhaled on a chilly day by your third grader on theway home from school, comes face-to-face with a single macrophage, the footsoldier of the body’s immune system. A fight is about to happen, yet it can’twithout two packages of knowledge clashing first. One package of knowledge isbuilt into the cold virus’s DNA; the other is built into the child’s DNA. Whenthey meet, each package has an information exchange with the other. If the coldvirus, which is one of the fastest-mutating organisms on the planet, has broughtsomething new to the table, the macrophage is completely baffled. It doesn’tknow what to do.For the moment, therefore, the superior knowledge of the cold virus succeeds indoing what it wants to do, which is to trigger more of itself in vast numbersthroughout the bloodstream. But the body’s healing system is millions of timessmarter than a cold virus, and it can adapt to change even faster than a viruscan mutate. Back at immunity headquarters—the lymphatic system that has its ownpathways separate from the bloodstream—an urgent message has been received. Themacrophage informs the immune system exactly what the new chemical is that itcan’t block, usually a protein.Now a specific type of white cell, known as a B-cell lymphocyte, revs up into“hypermutation,” and in short order it produces a single antibody coded to blockthe sly protein that let the cold virus get past the body’s defenses. It hastaken decades of medical research to uncover and describe these minusculeprocesses (which also involve killer T-cells, helper T-cells, and others aswell), but the key point is that the body is all about knowledge and how to useit. The wisdom of the body is real but invisible. There is no reason to separateit from the wisdom of a philosopher, sage, or scientist. If intelligence isbeing used to solve a problem, that’s a sign of consciousness. After all, theseimmune cells recognize strangers, act with a purpose, invent new defenses, readand receive messages, and interpret those messages accurately. Even in thebrains of Alzheimer’s patients, Rudy and his colleagues discovered that thepathological senile plaques are not just lethal chemical junk but are actuallyintended to protect the brain against infections from viruses, for example (seethis page [Chop_9780451495532_epub3_c019_r1.xhtml#page_271] for more on thisimportant finding). What other word makes sense except to say that all of thisis conscious?Medical research has performed a tremendous service by investigating the body ata microscopic level, because in everyday life, what we mostly notice is theresponses that occur on a macro level, like what you’d experience during aworkout at the gym: sweating, heavier breathing, a faster heartbeat. Someadaptations are on the micro level, like the heightened process of bringingoxygen to your muscle cells and carrying waste products away, which also occursin your workout. Medical science has devoted thousands of research hours tounderstand each adaptation in detail. But the whole-system approach is concernedwith a much bigger mystery: How does the body know what to do?Your body uses its intelligence on multiple fronts simultaneously, to keepitself balanced, strong, well defended, efficient, coordinated, and aware ofeverything happening in trillions of cells. Control by the host includeseverything on this agenda. Moreover, each element is being handled in sync withevery other element twenty-four hours a day. The rational mind isn’t equipped tomatch the wisdom of the body. Consider what is needed, at a minimum, simply toget out of the body’s way and stop undermining it.IN THE SPIRIT OF COOPERATIONCHOICES THAT SUPPORT THE WISDOM OF THE BODY:Reducing stressFighting against low-level chronic inflammationPhysical activity every dayAvoiding toxic air, food, and waterEating a natural whole-foods dietGetting good sleep every nightBeing in a good moodTaking time every day to be alone and quietBeing centered in yourself, without undue distractionsGetting out of sympathetic overdrive, as covered in chapter 5Approaching everyday challenges in a state of relaxed alertnessThere are no surprises here, but we want to make two important points. First,the adaptive mechanisms in your body are preset to each of these actions bydefault. Your cooperation increases the bodymind’s status on all fronts; yourinaction decreases the bodymind’s status on all fronts. A good night’s sleepdoesn’t look like it has anything to do with immunity to catching a cold, thequickness of muscle response, the rhythm of eating and satiation, and notgaining weight. But on a holistic basis, getting a good night’s sleep affectsall of these things.The second point, which follows from the first, is that you can’t pick andchoose to do one thing for a while and then move on to another. Your bodyoperates on every front all the time. While you are focused on whether to buyorganic spinach in the supermarket or finding time to make it to the gym,anything you leave out must still be handled at the level of your cells.A natural response to all of this is “I can’t do everything at once.” Quitetrue, and that’s been the big failing of holistic health—no one can actuallyencompass the whole bodymind. You do one thing and at the same time you leavesomething else out. Overcoming this obstacle is where the wisdom of mind mustenter, not with laundry lists of good intentions but with a truly holistic wayto increase the wisdom of the body.BRITT’S STORY: THE BEGINNING OF WISDOMBritt is a beautiful Swedish woman with flowing blond hair; she looks muchyounger than her actual age of forty-eight. Until a few years ago, anyonelooking at her life would conclude that Britt has been incredibly fortunate.Besides her physical attractiveness, she had a fulfilling family life, marriedto Poul, a successful private investor who had emigrated to America in histwenties (Poul had fallen in love with Britt while living in the United Statesand had divorced his first wife to be with her). Together they have three grownchildren, now away from home, who all worked hard to become educated andproductive. Poul has been a devoted father, and their two children, now in lateadolescence, have turned out to be happy and successful in school.Then five years ago, without warning, when the whole family was gathered forThanksgiving, Poul announced that he was moving out. “I don’t love your motheranymore,” he stated flatly. “It will be good for the whole family if she and Iseparate.”It wasn’t just the shocking news that devastated Britt. “He made hisannouncement in front of the kids, not in private with me. And he acted so calmand certain.”Tears and wrangling followed. The children took sides, the two girls blamingBritt for not keeping their dad happy, the son wanting to protect her. But Poulwas adamant. He had already rented an apartment nearby, and to his wife’s utteramazement, he suggested that they all continue as before, being a family anddoing everything together as before, only with him living elsewhere.For the first month or two Britt went along. She was successful in her ownright, working with a public relations firm. “I couldn’t just drop everythingand fall apart,” she said. So Poul got his way. He moved out of the house butdropped in whenever he wanted to have dinner or to see the kids. When Brittdemanded an explanation for his change of attitude, he revealed that he hadbegun to mistrust her. On a business trip several years before, she hadn’tanswered her hotel-room phone late one night. Poul was sure there were othermen.Despite her resolve not to fall apart, Britt began to feel increasingly anxious,and what triggered her anxiety the most was something quite basic, being alone.Finally, unable to sleep, feeling afraid at night, and not knowing where else toturn, she consulted a psychotherapist. He arranged for a prescription fortranquilizers while at the same time asking Britt if she had any idea why beingalone made her so anxious. She shook her head and agreed to return for furthersessions—taking a pill, she knew, wasn’t the answer.Over the course of the next few months, a pattern emerged. Britt had sacrificedherself for twenty years being the perfect wife, mother, and career woman. Theburden of being a superwoman hadn’t bothered her; in fact, she was proud of hersuccess. But the therapist pointed out something that stunned her.“You gave too much of yourself away,” he said.“What does that mean?” she asked.“You gave yourself away by putting everyone else’s needs ahead of yours,” hereplied.Britt almost said, “That’s what women do,” but instead she reflected for amoment. “Everything I did created a loving family. At Christmas or on mybirthday, everyone told me I was the center around which they revolved, theguiding star.”She started to cry, and there was no mystery to that. Having occupied her placeat the center of her family life, Poul had undermined her security by tellingher that he no longer loved her. It made her role seem hollow.“You adapted to another person,” the therapist said, “which happens in everymarriage, and should happen. But it went one way. Your husband dictated howthings ran. He held all the power. He made the critical decisions. Feelingtotally in control, he could move out knowing that you would give in.”There was a lot more talk about what Britt had given away over the years,including self-esteem, dignity, and the right to make her own decisions. Herstory could be about a woman getting her life back on track after a devastatingbreakup—which was a major part of it—but one day she asked her therapist acritical question: How do you get back the self you gave away?The therapist was surprised. “Are you seriously interested in that?” he asked.In his counseling of couples going through a divorce, the focus was usually ongetting back at each other, overcoming feelings of betrayal and bitterness, andemotional recovery. These things take years, and not everyone makes it throughthe recovery process in good shape emotionally.“You said I gave myself away,” Britt insisted. “I want back what’s mine.”Britt wanted to become more whole, to reclaim an inner life that wasn’tdependent on giving up her power, self-esteem, and freedom to have her ownopinions and beliefs. She was looking for healing at the level of the self. Butwhich self? There are several possible versions of the self that you canidentify with, and how your life turns out depends on which one you reinforce.“I” is more elusive than most people realize. Let’s look at four possiblechoices.The outward self: This is the social persona, which you identify with if yourfocus is on socially approved things like money, career, the right neighborhood,an impressive house, and so forth. “I” is attached to labels that relate tothose things, so that “WASP surgeon with a Park Avenue practice, a socialitewife, and a major portfolio” defines a very different self than “Latinaworking-class single mother living on food stamps.”The private self: This is who you are behind closed doors. The private selfidentifies with feelings and relationships. The values that matter most includea happy marriage, satisfying sex life, children to love and be proud of, and soforth. On the downside are the private trials and miseries that come into everylife. “I” is attached to the hopes and fears of everyday existence, which forsome people means an existence of insecurity, anxiety, depression, and dashedhopes that seems inescapable.The unconscious self: This is the self we do not know in waking life. It isgoverned by instincts and drives that most of us don’t want to bring to light.At its most menacing, the unconscious self has been called “the shadow,” wherethe worst human traits of anger, violence, envy, revenge, and deep-seatedexistential fear reside. In relation to the shadow self, one might attempt tokeep the dark side of the unconscious self-hidden or try to convert it to thelight. Artists, musicians, and poets do the latter. They approach theunconscious self not as a fearful domain but as a source of creativity waitingto be born.The higher self: This is the self that aspires to rise above everyday conflictsand confusion. Experience tells us that the other versions of the self—theoutward, private, and unconscious self—are constantly in conflict. This is whycivilization is so discontented, to use Freud’s term. Eruptions from theunconscious bring war, crime, and violence. Private misery overshadows publicsuccess. The arts point to immense possibilities for creativity, but too fewpeople are able to take advantage of them. In the world’s wisdom traditions, thestruggle between so many conflicts can’t be won at the level of struggle. “I”must surrender every claim of the ego, whether public or private, to seek ahigher state of consciousness.Britt wasn’t unusual in finding herself mired in struggle. A crisis like the oneher husband threw her into creates heightened confusion and struggle, buteveryday life masks the same conflicted situation. Nor is Britt unusual in thechoices she made. In exchange for an outward self that looked perfect to theoutside world, she gave up her power over the private, unconscious, and higherself. What’s unusual is how quickly she came to this realization after herhusband moved out.Her therapist was very encouraging. “Whatever you gave away, you can take back,”he said. “It’s a return journey to pick up the pieces you dropped along theway.”The world’s wisdom traditions, which we define simply as the traditions ofhigher consciousness, agree. Wisdom begins by recognizing that the bodymindisn’t just about cells, tissues, and organs, nor is it just about thoughts,feelings, and sensations. Instead, the bodymind is about unity between body,mind, and spirit. If you fall in love, there is a corresponding biology of lovecreated in your body. Likewise there’s a biology of anxiety, a biology ofdepression, a biology of happiness. The whole-system approach rests upon thisfact, but it’s hard to grasp the whole truth: there is a shifting biology thatmeets the needs of every moment. Your cells know what to do in any situation,which counts as the most astonishing level of intelligence in nature.The “I” you identify with is like a magnifying glass gathering the sun’s rays toa point. Your “I” interprets every experience and makes it personal. “I” is abundle of hopes, fears, wishes, and dreams. “I” harbors memories no one elsehas, and in the compartments of memory are stored habits, beliefs, old traumas,and past conditioning. This multiplicity is bewildering, which is why theteaching of “Know thyself” is actually the point of being alive—until you knowwhere “I” came from, you cannot discover who you really are.Britt took the “journey of return” seriously. Despite all the advantages of herexternal life, she couldn’t do the most basic thing, which is to be alone.Without a life of keeping busy and caring for everyone else, “I” was aterrifying prospect to her. This implies a great deal of healing in theunconscious, where the demons lurk but also the wounded child. Britt’s journeyover the next five years went through roughly the following stages:Overcoming her anxiety. Britt relied on tranquilizers at first but weanedherself off through therapy and, more important, by taking up meditation andyoga.Learning self-reliance. Britt told Poul he couldn’t come around anymorepretending that family life was normal. (It quickly came out that he had had agirlfriend on the side.) She moved toward divorce on her own terms and at herown speed, taking fully two years before she felt ready to stand on her own.Getting back into relationship. Britt began to date, a strange experience for awoman who hadn’t been on a date in twenty-five years. She discovered that shewanted to be happy again, and at that stage she took up dancing, a love of hersfrom her teens, and steadily developed friends outside the couples she and Poulhad known together.Finding a spiritual path. Britt took her meditation practice more and moreseriously, looking far beyond issues of stress, relaxation, and health. She haddeeply absorbed the lessons of what happens when you give yourself away—youbecome unconscious. Beneath her anxiousness about being alone lay a kind ofnumbness. Her active, busy, successful life had soaked up all the energy. Deepdown nothing was moving. The inner woman was stuck and had been that way foryears.All of us resemble Britt, not in the particulars of her story but in the returnjourney we must make if we want to heal. “I” must reawaken to the possibility ofa vibrant existence once again, where the light of awareness is the true healer.When you lead a conscious life, the following experiences are realpossibilities, and they can unfold at any time:THE RICHES OF A CONSCIOUS LIFEALL THE POSSIBILITIES YOU COULD HAVE TODAY:You give someone a helping hand.You notice something beautiful.You do or say something kind.You offer yourself in service to someone in need.You smile with appreciation.You forgive a slight.You make another person laugh.You have a fresh new idea.You find the solution to a problem.You feel a close bond with another person.You meditate.You take time out to be alone, valuing your private time.You lift someone else’s spirits.You are playful and take time to play.You walk outside in nature and feel refreshed.You engage in physical activity that’s invigorating.You respect someone else’s boundaries without being asked.You feel light and buoyant.You feel spiritually uplifted.There is a moment of pure joy.You cherish another person.We don’t have to explain why these experiences are desirable; the fact that eachone of them creates a moment of happiness is obvious. The real question is howto create them. Each version of the self has a different point of view, each itsown goals.The outward self doesn’t look inward, because its goal is to achieve happinesswith outward success and the accumulation of money, possessions, status, and soforth. The private self does go inward, feeling the ups and downs of emotions.It wants to achieve happiness by having more pleasure than pain. Perfecthappiness would be a state of constant pleasantness. We all know this isunrealistic and will never be attained. Yet most people expend a great deal oftime and energy doing what they can to have more positivity in their lives thannegativity, however you want to define those terms.The private self can experience some of the riches of a conscious life, sinceour efforts to be loving or kind, for example, are often rooted in our emotionallife. It feels good to be kind and loving; therefore, most of us enjoy theexperience. But there are limits. The private self is selfish and insecure.Given a choice between its own happiness and someone else’s, it chooses theformer. If a loved one withdraws their love, as Poul withdrew his from Britt,the private self experiences a sense of loss and pain. The prospects for apleasant existence fly out the window, at least for a time.The unconscious self is a mysterious part of the psyche, a hidden region mostpeople fear. Who knows what its purpose is, or what it needs to be happy? Thegreatest conflict in modern psychology was over this very issue. Sigmund Freudcame to believe that the unconscious was the domain of the Id, a primal forcethat is untamed. Id isn’t held back by guilt or shame; social rules don’t touchit. A two-year-old throwing a tantrum in a grocery store might be a good exampleof pure Id breaking out. The child feels no restraint in displaying his angerand doesn’t care who he hurts or embarrasses. The tantrum, like the Id ingeneral, isn’t immoral or even selfish. Id is simply ungoverned, and we oftenfear its lawlessness, just as Freud traced every dark force—hatred, aggression,sexual appetite, the lure of death and violence—back to the unconscious.But his most famous disciple, the Swiss psychologist Carl Jung, stronglydisagreed and eventually split off from Freud entirely. Their disagreements arecomplicated, but one of the essential issues was Jung’s insistence that theunconscious didn’t simply hold dark forces. It held dozens of patterns ortemplates of behavior that Jung labeled archetypes. The human race shared thesepatterns in its collective unconscious. As proof, Jung pointed to the way everysociety had heroes, myths, gods, journeys into the light, questing, fixed modelsof masculinity and femininity, and much more. He conceded that the unconsciouscould erupt in war and violence, but for him this was the expression of onearchetype (such as Mars, the Roman god of war). Yet in the scheme of archetypes,there is also Venus, the Roman goddess of love.Jung worked closely with Freud from 1907 to 1913, but over that time theirrelationship became more and more tumultuous. After his split with Freud, Jungbegan work on what many consider his masterpiece, The Red Book, or Liber Novus(the “New Book”). The book was largely based on the vivid and often disturbingnightly dreams Jung had while he was serving as an officer in the Swiss army.Many believe that Jung was practicing lucid dreaming, or waking up in dreams,which he would journal with beautiful calligraphic narratives and detailedartwork of impressive quality. He believed that his dreams were a window intothe background activity of his unconscious, which he chronicled for sixteenyears.Before he died in 1961, Jung told an interviewer:> [W]hen I pursued the inner images [was] the most important time of my life.> Everything else is to be derived from this. My entire life consisted in> elaborating what had burst forth from the unconscious and flooded me like an> enigmatic stream and threatened to break me. That was the stuff and material> for more than only one life. Everything later was merely the outer> classification, scientific elaboration, and the integration into life. But the> numinous beginning, which contained everything, was then.The Red Book in its handwritten leather-bound form dates from 1915 to 1930, butit was only published in 2000. (Free facsimiles, including Jung’s elaborateillustrations, can be found online in PDF format.) Various commentators, likeits translator, Sonu Shamdasani, look upon the book as Jung’s tortuous quest tosalvage his soul through an inner dialogue with his unconscious, what he calledthe “spirit of the depths.” It’s sometimes contended that The Red Book was theresult of a psychotic break after Jung’s split with Freud. Sympatheticsupporters hold that Jung boldly faced his own psychosis head-on, confrontingwhat he found deep inside his psyche via his dreams, and emerging stronger andmore whole for doing so.This essential conflict between Freud’s Id and Jung’s archetypes had a powerfulinfluence over the field of psychology for many decades, and even today hasn’tbeen settled. Perhaps it never will be, yet for each person in everyday life,there are experiences of desire, appetite, anger, and the temptation of violencethat cause disruptions no one wants to experience. The outward self gains a lotof its power by pushing down the unconscious self. Every time you go to work,you put on your outward self, and so does everyone around you. The unacceptablealternatives, like sexual harassment and open hostility, are kept in check asmuch as possible. The upshot of this rather lengthy description is that theunconscious self isn’t opened up in normal life. If, as Jung says, we could findsomething beautiful and gratifying by exploring our unconscious, few dare toopen that door.What are we left with, then? Only the higher self has access to the richexperiences we call the conscious life. Its goal is to live in the light ofawareness, which isn’t the same as being pleasant all the time. Awareness isunfiltered and free. Its openness to every experience represents a leap offaith. But those who have taken the leap, including the world’s sages, saints,and spiritual teachers in every culture, declare that the higher self is real—infact, it is the only real self. The other versions of the self are unreliable.They make false promises, suffer from insecurity, fear loss of control, giveshelter to hidden demons, and ultimately cannot reach any permanent state ofhappiness.Britt discovered this by going through a personal crisis. She is one amongcountless people who have chosen to walk a different path, to discover forthemselves if the higher self can be found. She is on a healing journey becausethat is where she found herself as the crisis unfolded. But it doesn’t take acrisis to initiate this journey. On any given day, the one thing we cannot livewithout—a self—is shifting and unreliable. We may not be aware of it, but we areconstantly changing our loyalties. The outward self claims us at work orenjoying ourselves at a party or buying a new house. The private self claims usin matters of the heart, in moments of depression and anxiety, and in our familylife. The unconscious self does whatever it wants to, and hard as we try to keepit at bay, everyone knows the experience of sexual appetite, raging fury, andnightmares—perhaps nightmares are our purest encounters with the dark side ofthe unconscious.The instability and unpredictability of the self, the “I” we take for granted,poses the final challenge to healing. The thing that looks so simple—getting outof the way so that the bodymind can heal itself—turns out to be very difficult.The wisdom of the body is incredible, but we undermine it through the stress andunpredictability of everyday existence. Instead of having a healthy relationshipto the self, we constantly question who we are. We plunge into situations wecan’t handle and relationships filled with hidden conflict. Our attempts atself-control are temporary and only partially effective. If we succeed in beingperfectly controlled, the cost is paid in the negative emotions we push down outof sight.In short, the situation is messy. To be a wise healer, you have to solve theproblems created by “I” and its many problems. But how can “I” be part of thesolution at the same time that it is the source of so much harm? Asking the selfto heal itself is rather like asking a surgeon to apply a scalpel to remove hisown appendix. Needless to say, most people never resolve this paradox—they liveyear after year with an “I” that gets along as best it can. Experiences come andgo. Good things happen one day, bad things the next. In the end, people arriveat a state of health and well-being that has little rhyme or reason. They’restuck with what they’ve got.In the next chapter we’ll see if this haphazard outcome can be changed. Therehas to be a better way and, in fact, there is."},{"pageContent":"10THE END OF SUFFERINGIf the healing self could bring suffering to an end, it would seem miraculous.Every life brings some pain, and the mental side of pain, which is suffering,comes along with that. No one escapes the inner drama of the psyche, no matterhow happy their life is on the surface. (In the last chapter we talked about howJung openly embraced his own inner drama.) We’ve based our whole-system approachon leading a healing lifestyle, which means a lifestyle in which consciousnesscomes first. Essentially, what you aren’t aware of, you cannot heal. Juriesoften give massive awards for pain and suffering, but the two aren’t the samething. You can have acute physical pain and adapt to it psychologically, whichreduces the quotient of suffering much more than for someone who cannot adapt.Simply anticipating bad events in the future creates a level of stress in thebodymind that can create physical pain (e.g., a big meeting with a boss aboutyour performance could lead to chest pain, headaches, lower-back pain, upsetdigestion). When these symptoms appear, some people will also feel mentalsuffering, such as fear, anxiety, and depression. But others won’t. In otherwords, suffering is more personal and elusive than physical pain, which everyonenotices. It would be very unhelpful if knowing that you are suffering harmed youin comparison with someone else who goes into denial. Unfortunately, this is acommonly held belief. “What you don’t know can’t hurt you” causes its own hurtover the long run. Fear is often driven by subconscious memories of pain andsuffering in the past, which can create even more suffering in the future.Suffering isn’t a topic that’s easy for most people to talk about, but there aregood data on happiness around the world, which would correlate to levels ofsuffering. The Gallup organization, best known for political polling, alsogathers data worldwide on how happy people are. This is done one of two ways,either by asking responders to self-rate how happy they are or by posing asimple question: On the day before the interview, did the person laugh and smilea lot? Gallup’s highest happiness ranking is “thriving,” and in the UnitedStates, by their current estimates, only 51 percent of people say that they arethriving, placing us 14th among the 142 countries Gallup measures. Only 4percent of Americans respond that they are suffering, while 45 percent reportthat they are struggling. (By contrast, in India, which ranks 127th inhappiness, only 8 percent are thriving and 28 percent are suffering, leaving alarge majority to struggle.)It may be, as some experts believe, that people overrate their happiness if youconsider the hidden or unspoken causes for unhappiness. Approximately one infive Americans will suffer a bout of severe depression in their lives. Domesticabuse is notoriously underreported and belongs among the factors that are notaddressed in mainstream medicine. Even in the world’s two happiest countries,Denmark and Norway, where 68 percent of people report that they are thriving, 30percent are struggling. By implication, there are millions of people in theUnited States who urgently need to get out of suffering, whether that meansending an abusive relationship or leaving a job that causes one to get sick.At the end of the last chapter we introduced a new possibility, the higher self,which expands how powerful consciousness can be. Higher brings in a spiritualconnotation, which we need to explain before going any further. The separationbetween body and mind is artificial, and medical science strongly supportsmerging them into the bodymind. That much seems settled. “Higher” consciousnesswould appear to cross the line into the domain of God, spirit, and the soul,which medical science has nothing to do with. Every hospital has a chaplain, yethe doesn’t stand in the operating room beside the surgeons.If the healing self is going to bring an end to suffering, another boundary hasto crumble, because meditation research, now a completely accepted field,employs a spiritual practice. It might seem peculiar that popular televisionpersonalities like Dr. Oz and Dr. Phil would be joined by Dr. Buddha, but that’sentirely plausible. The Buddha offered a path to end suffering based onconsciousness, not an appeal to God, spirit, or the soul. Meditation isconsciousness-based medicine. Whatever happens when you are meditating (orpraying, doing yoga, being mindful, etc.) registers in cellular activity, firstin the brain, then farther down the line in the rest of the body.This leads to a simple but powerful conclusion: the end of suffering is aconsciousness solution to a consciousness problem. No one suffers because theyare in pain. Suffering is an interpretation based on all the things we’ve beendiscussing: beliefs, habits, old conditioning, and the struggle between actingmindfully or mindlessly. If you change your interpretation, your degree ofsuffering will change. The higher self represents a major change at the level of“Who am I?” When you identify with the higher self, you discover the path out ofsuffering, because you discover inside yourself that the following things aretrue:There’s a level of awareness that experiences no suffering. Painful experiencesregister but do not linger as suffering.Physical pain exists as a sensation, but this is a signal for healing, not acurse.The source of suffering is the same as the source of healing: your state ofawareness. We aren’t denying the benefits of pain research and the need torelieve physical pain. The first question the doctor asks the patient is “Wheredoes it hurt?” The aim on both sides is to become pain-free. Our goal in thischapter is to become free of suffering, which can only occur at the level ofconsciousness. (Dr. Buddha would say the same.)THE PARADOX OF PAINFew physicians specialize in pain per se. To the typical MD, pain is somethingto get rid of, not to understand. But if you try to understand the mechanics ofphysical pain, the picture isn’t simple. Sometimes pain is like a rock in yourshoe, which you immediately take out to relieve your discomfort, or a toothachethat sends you rushing to the dentist. But at other times physical pain isn’timmediate or easily fixable. In fact, a pain that signals serious long-termdamage somewhere in your body is often the last symptom to appear. Many of themost widespread disorders that medicine still wants to cure, such as heartdisease and cancer, can go for years without sending the signal of pain, bywhich time the possibility of preventing them may be long past.Consider aging, which typically brings its share of aches and pains. They don’thave to convert into a state of suffering, however, and when they do, thelinchpin is a person’s beliefs. In a society where billions of dollars are spenton pain relievers while suffering is a difficult topic that most people refuseto confront, beliefs exert hidden power. A typical chain of reasoning might bethe following:Pain creates suffering.The more intense the pain, the greater the suffering.As we age, we can expect to get increased physical aches and pains.Therefore, aging brings increased suffering.These are beliefs that have a shaky relationship to reality, but if you holdthem strongly enough, the bodymind converts them into your reality. To beginwith, people need to revise their belief that pain equates with suffering. Painby itself is often something we can work through and ignore. The “no pain, nogain” ethos in sports is a prime example. Marathon runners volunteer to undergoconsiderable pain to achieve the bigger goal of victory. The desire to win canbecome so all-important that a severe, life-threatening condition is tolerated,such as repeated brain trauma in boxing, football, and rugby, all the way downto junior leagues, where a child’s future health may be at stake.In society’s panic to make pain the enemy, listening to your pain anddiscomfort, which is the body’s primary reason for sending pain signals, comessecond or not at all. This indicates that our priorities are confused. A lifewithout the body’s pain signals turns out to be far from fortunate. There is agenetic condition that deprives certain people of any sensation of pain, andthose who suffer from it find everyday life quite threatening.One patient born with this genetic condition, known as CIP (congenitalinsensitivity to pain), is Jason Breck, as we’ll call him. The condition isexceedingly rare, with only about twenty documented cases in the medicalliterature. Breck’s parents discovered his condition when as a toddler he bitoff half his tongue. Interviewed as an adult, Breck recalls, “One incident Iremember is breaking my foot on my birthday. It was swollen and bruised, so Itook some duct tape and taped my foot, put on a boot, and just continued with myday.” For some time there was doubt that such a condition existed, but now it’sknown that CIP results from a mutation in a single gene (SCN9A), and even morestartling, that one molecule is responsible for controlling pain. The mechanismis linked to the fact that SCN9A sits on the neurons that cause the sensation ofpain.Since there is also generally an insensitivity to temperature, people with CIPare surrounded by dangers the rest of us don’t experience. “You have to behypervigilant in your day-to-day tasks,” Breck says, “to avoid causing seriousinjury to yourself.” Without the signal of pain, other strategies must bedeveloped to tell you that you are injured. The sensation of touch usually isn’tdamaged, so sensing pressure or a sudden knock serves as a cue. But this alsoposes a danger. As a young child Breck liked to bang his head against the wallto feel the vibration, which he enjoyed. Children with CIP therefore need towear helmets to avoid this dangerous behavior. (In Breck’s case, he is able tosense temperature but has no sense of smell, another threat since, for example,he wouldn’t smell smoke from a house fire.)It took the inheritance of the SCN9A mutation from both his father and mother tocreate Breck’s condition, so the genetic probabilities are extremely low. Thegenetic clue also could turn into a powerful painkiller. If the signals fromnormal SCN9A could be temporarily blocked after surgery or severe injury, forexample, the pain relief would be total and, at best case, without any sideeffects. Even more starkly, a sizable percentage of terminal patients who wantto have assisted suicide are in unbearable chronic pain that the most powerfulnarcotics can’t relieve. For them a genetic treatment may be their only hope.If you look at the wider picture, however, what this example is about is theparadox of pain. Because it evolved as a sensation to serve and preserve us, butcan harm us at the same time, pain is one of the most elusive things to handlein our lives. There’s no getting around the fact that pain alone doesn’t causesuffering. Not just your beliefs matter here. In a telling 2013 study, AntoineLutz and his colleagues wanted to test whether being open to the experience ofpain—in other words, mindful—works better than the usual tactic of avoiding painand feeling anxious before the pain occurs.As the researchers note, very little is known about how mindfulness affects thebrain activity associated with pain. As subjects they took a group of “expertmeditators” who had been doing their practice for more than 10,000 hours andused fMRI brain scans to look at brain activity associated with anticipatingpain, experiencing pain, and getting used to pain. When subjected to a painfulstimulus, the expert meditators felt the same intensity of pain as novicemeditators, but they reported that it was less unpleasant—that is, they sufferedless. In terms of what was happening in the expert meditators’ brains, theresearchers commented that “this difference was associated with enhancedactivity in the dorsal anterior insula (aI), and the anterior mid-cingulatecortex (aMCC), the so-called salience network. In neuroscience, saliency refersto how much a thing stands out compared with its neighbors.But why would lifelong meditators notice pain more quickly and yet suffer fromit less? The key is that their baseline for pain was lower than the controlgroup; they didn’t have as much anticipation of being hurt or the anxiety thatcomes with it. Then when pain was felt, they registered it quickly, and they gotused to it more quickly. This is the rather technical story told by brain scans.But it accords with subjective reports from meditators that they feel calm,centered, and at peace.Our view of these findings is simple: consciousness can intervene to reducesuffering, even when the level of physical pain doesn’t change. What do we learnfrom this? To be healed is to be free from suffering, and if this ideal cannotbe readily attained, each of us should try to get as close as possible. Let’slook at someone who set out to achieve the goal.DARREN’S STORY: CHANGE AND RENEWALDarren, who is forty-five, is married, and lives in Colorado, didn’t set out torevamp his identity. Yet somehow it happened, and the results have beendramatic—classmates who knew him in college are astonished at the changes.“I didn’t come from a rough background or a difficult family,” Darren says. “Ifelt completely normal—a brash, competitive kid heading for a career as a lawyeror doctor. Something good that paid really well.”With this vague goal in mind, Darren felt well equipped to succeed, althoughbehind his back others found him too aggressive and even arrogant. Classmateslet him have his way, not because they necessarily liked him, but because he dugin his heels or retaliated if anyone opposed him.He smiles with regret. “I know I was a jerk, and as far as anyone could predict,that wasn’t going to change.”But then a family tragedy occurred. His younger brother enlisted in the army,went to fight overseas, and didn’t return.“I rushed home to be with my parents,” Darren says, “and as devastated as theywere, I felt numb. I couldn’t even cry. One day, two soldiers arrived at thedoor to deliver my brother’s posthumous medals for bravery. My father barelysaid a word to them, but when they left he opened the box and said, ‘Take a lookat what your kid brother died for.’ ”Perhaps it was significant that this major disruption in Darren’s life happenedwhen he was twenty and he was still malleable. At a time when identity enters acrisis for most young people, he was more than badly shaken.“I started to hate myself—that’s not too strong a word. I began drinking toomuch and playing video games until three in the morning, but nothing really cutthrough the guilt for more than a few hours. I was supposed to protect my littlebrother, yet I had barely paid attention to him. I lay awake every nightwondering if I could have stopped him from enlisting, until I realized that Ididn’t even know his motivations. Was he out of options? Did he have a deepstreak of patriotism?”A period of self-examination began to unfold. Instead of going directly to lawschool or medical school, Darren took time off, supporting himself with casualwork like house painting. He didn’t find a solid, stable relationship, and aftera year or two, he stopped dating.“I had figured out something,” he says. “If I didn’t work on myself, only twooptions lay ahead. Either I would be stuck with some unbearable emotionalbaggage, or I could just pretend to myself that I was okay—then what?”Over the next five years Darren took the exceptional step of going inward andstaying there, investigating who he was. “I wasn’t qualified to psychoanalyzemyself, but that wasn’t it, really. I just wanted to be able to feel right withmyself again, and to get there, I had to deal with the fact that I had turnedinto the kind of person I never wanted to be—not just a jerk but a man with noinner life.”Darren’s decision isn’t unique—countless people have decided, for hundreds ofreasons, to step away from society and walk the inner path. Whether theyconsider this path spiritual or healing, walking the inner path requires a newkind of awareness, one that few people are prepared for. How do you rearrangeyour inner life, with its clutter of old memories, habits, wounds, andconditioning? Everything “in here” is invisible. Unwanted emotions like fear anddepression wander at will in times of crisis.Despite these difficulties, Darren kept being motivated by one thing:self-renewal: “I refused to buy into the idea that I was a finished product,that I’d show up at a class reunion twenty years from now and everyone wouldsay, ‘You haven’t changed a bit.’ To me, that would be a terrible way to turnout.”Seeking self-renewal is a conscious decision, and it’s never once and for all.Renewal at the level of the cell is a constant and virtually automatic process,and so is self-renewal. The noted spiritual teacher Jiddu Krishnamurti once madea provocative remark about meditation. People set aside a certain period of theday to meditate, he said, but they don’t realize that real meditation istwenty-four hours a day. The same is true for healing. Cells don’t see thisround-the-clock duty as an obstacle.On the personal level, however, round-the-clock healing seems impossible. But ifyou look more closely, to heal twenty-four hours a day isn’t like choosing towatch TV or bounce a basketball twenty-four hours a day. Healing is more likebreathing, a life-sustaining process that works automatically yet can also beaugmented (by the breathing exercises in yoga, for example). Because healing isan automatic process, you are totally immersed in it already. So what was Darrenreally choosing to do? How could he know whether his project of changing himselfwould work in the first place?He began with a belief that everyone needs to adopt: There is no fixed “I” orself. From this moment onward, you will never be the same person again.Therefore, it is futile to hold on to “I” like a raft in a storm at sea. The “I”self is the storm. Everyone is tossed about by every kind of external andinternal force, and as all of this turmoil crashes around, the bodymind bendswith the currents of change. Your conscious mind cannot possibly keep track ofthis turmoil. We’re incredibly fortunate that evolution developed the healingresponse to such perfection that living on automatic pilot saves us from beingdamaged by the changes that assault us.What Darren and millions of others have discovered is that evolution can take anew direction—it can become conscious. This puts healing in a different light.Instead of making positive lifestyle choices your chief focus (beneficial asthose choices are), you immerse yourself in the healing process, becoming thehealing process. It becomes your goal to evolve into a “higher healer,” if wecan put it that way. Here is what this involves.HOW HIGHER HEALING WORKSYou place a high value on happiness.You live from a stable center core.You stop struggling and resisting.You seek harmony by serving as an example to others, not trying to control them.You choose resonance with others over dissonance.You remain open to what’s happening here and now.You have a vision of the best life you can lead, based on values larger thanyourself.You pay attention to subtle signs of distress and discomfort.You undo the damage of the past.You look forward to the future with optimism.You enjoy being constantly in process.These are the traits of conscious evolution. By setting as your goal that youwant to grow and evolve every day, you are entering into an enlightenedpartnership with everything happening to you, holding no judgment againstyourself or what your life is bringing to you. Since every process in thebodymind is self-organizing and self-renewing, the most evolved way to live isto let yourself unfold naturally. Words like flow and surrender come to mind,yet they barely touch upon the reality of dedicating yourself to constantrenewal. Lao-Tzu, the father of Taoism, teaches that we must endure what lifethrows at us like reeds in the wind. If we bend and yield to the pressures oflife, allowing the natural course of events to sculpt us, we endure. If weinsist on remaining firm and upright, we snap.“Looking back, I see my path as one thing,” Darren says. “Can life be trusted?Can it take care of itself? I put it that way because my brother’s death broughtup a deep streak of distrust. Life had kicked me in the teeth—now what? Mostpeople take the blow, try to survive it, and then piece together their versionof a normal life. But they never solve the underlying question. Can you reallytrust what life is going to bring you? If not, you better build a wall aroundyourself and hunker down for the worst.” You can call this one man’s philosophyof life, but the issue runs much deeper.THE MYSTERIOUS “I”As we’ve noted, none of us has a fixed self. We are constantly changing. Weoften observe this when we try to soothe an infant who is teething or need tobuy new outfits for a teenage son or daughter because they’ve outgrown their oldclothes that fit just a week ago. In reality, nothing about you is exactly thesame as it was yesterday. Who are you, then? “I’m a process” sounds strange tomost people, but let’s examine the science that supports this answer.In a 2016 TED talk, Moshe Szyf, a prominent geneticist at McGill University,outlined a fascinating study that involves rats and how they are mothered. A“good mother” rat shows her goodness by licking her newborn offspring much morethan a “bad mother” rat, who neglects this task or does it half-heartedly. Whenthey grow up, the pups lead very different lives—the ones who had good motheringare more relaxed, less stressed, and exhibit different sexual behavior than therats from bad mothers. Normally, a geneticist would say that there is a specificgene being passed on that determines what kind of mother a rat will turn out tobe.But Szyf is a specialist in epigenetics, which studies how the genes we’re bornwith are affected by life experiences—the epigenome is all the factors thatcontrol the activity (expression) of our genes. It includes chemicalmodifications of our DNA and the proteins, known as histones, that sheathe andsurround it. DNA and its protein sheath get chemically imprinted by experienceand play a major role in turning genes off and on, up and down. (This processwas a major focus of our previous book, Super Genes.) Over ten years, Szyf andhis colleagues explored what might happen if a baby rat from a bad mother wasgiven to a good mother for its care, and the same in reverse for baby rats fromgood mothers. What the researchers discovered is that a significant number ofchemical pathways were changed, and this supported what they could see—a goodmother rat could turn her adopted baby into a relaxed, unstressed adult—in otherwords, the experience of being raised well overcame the inheritance from a badmother. The reverse was also true. Even though a baby rat was descended from aline of good mothers, this good inheritance could be reversed by having the ratbe adopted by a bad mother.Szyf goes on to speculate about more than nature versus nurture in rats. What isit about the way a human baby is raised that fixes its ideas about how lifeworks? Szyf points to a baby raised in Stockholm, where winter days are cold,bright, and very short, compared with a baby raised in a tribe in Brazil, wheredays are of equal length and hot. A baby whose system received these differentinputs would go on, he speculates, to expect life to be different based oninfant experience. There would be expectations about other important things,such as the abundance or scarcity of food, a sense of danger or safety, or aneasy or hard survival in general. Thus, Szyf declares, evolution has taught ourold fixed DNA to adapt dynamically to all kinds of environments—a major clue tosomething we have been saying, that you belong to a species that is the mostadaptive on Earth.Now we reach a crossroads. Is this early set of imprints the key to health anddisease? The sword cuts both ways. The same imprint could help or hurt you inlater life, and there’s no predicting which will occur. Let’s say child A israised to feel safe and protected, and he grows up holding this belief inside,while child B is imprinted with the idea that life is unsafe and unpredictable.We might say that child A is going to get along more happily than child B. Butwhat if danger looms on the horizon, like the first AIDS case or the emergenceof a Hitler or a Stalin? The child who assumes by default that everything willwork out well in a benign, safe world could be tragically unprepared as an adultfacing a looming threat, while the child reared to assume by default thatworst-case scenarios must be confronted could turn into the only survivor of thetwo.Szyf arrives at a groundbreaking conclusion. Thanks to genetic advances, one cannow see where exactly the entire genome has been marked by good or badmothering. He points to a study of monkeys and mothering where one baby had areal mother while another had a surrogate doll. Many genes looked differentbetween the two groups, beginning as early as fourteen days after the infant’sbirth. “This signals the whole way life is going to look like when you become anadult,” Szyf declares. “Stress rearranges the entire genome.” How early do allof these differences show up? The question has a bearing on experiences in earlyinfancy. For example, when caring for an infant, parents can choose to let thebaby cry in attempts to train it to sleep through the night, the so-calledFerber method. Or like Rudy and his wife, Dora, with their baby daughter, Lyla,they can attend to the crying every time it happens.In the latter case, it is tougher on the parent, but the earliest neuralnetworks and genetic imprinting in the infant will program a message that canlast for life, that the world is a good and secure place. Of course, the worldwill turn out to be full of challenges and letdowns, but this positiveimprinting very early on goes a long way to promoting healing over suffering allthrough life.We may already know—and be programmed to accept—our place in the world from themoment of birth. Animals obey such programming instinctively. For example,monkeys always arrange themselves in a social hierarchy, with a dominant monkeyat the top and the lowest monkey at the bottom. The differences in their genomesare already present when they come out of the womb, which in human terms maymean that belonging to a disadvantaged background would imprint a baby from thefirst day. What makes this possibility more distressing came out in a study thatwent back to an ice storm in 1998 that wiped out power in the dead of winter forall of Quebec. This event was more stressful for some people than others, andamong the population were pregnant mothers.Following their infants for fifteen years, the developmental psychologistSuzanne King found that children of mothers who went through highly stressfulexperiences during and after the ice storm suffered higher incidences of autism,metabolic disorders, and autoimmune diseases. Of course, one cannot assume acause-and-effect relationship here. Yet there are many roads leading away fromthese and similar studies, such as the discovery that single events occurring ata specific time during pregnancy can affect the development of the fetus. Butthe bigger picture is about how unstable the self really is, even though wethink that “I” remains the same from year to year.The longest study pertaining to the instability of self comes from Scotland,where in 1947 schoolteachers were asked to rate their fourteen-year-old studentson six personality characteristics: self-confidence, perseverance, stability ofmoods, conscientiousness, originality, and a desire to learn. A total of 1,208students was involved, and in 2012 a follow-up study tracked down survivors whowould agree to rate themselves on the same characteristics, a total of 174. Togain perspective, the survivors were also asked to find someone who knew themwell and who would give them a separate rating. It’s long been held inpsychology that personality is stable, and there’s a common bias that “peoplenever change.” But the Scottish study came to the opposite conclusion. Althoughthere were similarities between the younger and older age groups, the“correlations suggested no significant stability of any of the 6characteristics.”No one quite knows why previous studies indicated that personality remainsstable over time. Mothers often say that they saw in their babies the sort ofpersonality the infant would grow up to have. “You were a quiet baby, and you’requiet now” is a typical remark, or “You always wanted to get your own way, evenwhen you were two.” But it appears that time explains a good deal. The Scottishstudy is the longest on record, and by their seventies these people had “hardlyany relationship at all” to their adolescent selves.The opportunity to transform your sense of self has always been there. Just asimportant, a lifetime of experience is going to transform you anyway, and themore time you wait, the more you will be transformed without your knowledge andconsent. We’d like to point out some basic conclusions:Early experiences imprint a child much more than anyone thought in terms ofgenes, biology, and behavior.In the mix of all these influences, each of us carries around a map of life thatisn’t our choice but an imprint.We can change this imprint by choosing the beliefs, behaviors, andinterpretations we actually want. In other words, unconscious imprints can beundone once you set your mind to it—no other living creature is blessed withthis possibility as far as we know.There have been medical anecdotes about total changes of identity. In the 1960s,a brilliant but eccentric Scottish psychiatrist named R. D. Laing was in vogue.Laing reported the case of a young woman who had lapsed into a coma and whosuddenly woke up. She knew herself by her own name, but a strange process oftransformation had occurred. The girl had been shy and introverted before. Nowthe nurses treated her like a celebrity, the life of the party. Theycomplimented her for how witty and charming she was. In short order, believingwhat she was told, the patient underwent a personality change, becoming theperson that was being reflected back at her.If we know that “I” can be dismantled piece by piece, either through braininjury or for psychological reasons, then the self is much less stable andtrustworthy than anyone ever thought. Which leads us back to Darren. If it’strue that a fourteen-year-old wouldn’t recognize himself at sixty or seventy,Darren didn’t want to. He drastically changed his former self because hecouldn’t live with the old “I” any longer. Now that he’s in his forties, wheredid life take him after he turned his back on an unacceptable “I”?“I do occasionally meet old friends from high school and college who say, ‘Youhaven’t changed a bit,’ ” he admits. “But I can laugh it off. I know they’rejust trying to be complimentary. If they really knew me, they’d be shocked,because the way I feel about myself isn’t remotely like what I felt back then. Iused to run away from myself. I had a voice in my head reminding me every daythat I wasn’t good enough. All of that’s gone now.“The voice in my head that was constantly judging me took a long time to goaway. A thousand times, or ten thousand times, I would tell it, ‘I don’t needyou anymore.’ I used to be proud of how tough and hard I was, and that took along time to turn around, too. But you can’t be alive without feelings, and youcan’t feel unless you expose your vulnerability. I doubt one guy in a hundredfaces that truth. I had to, because the thing that got me on the path, myhorrible guilt over my brother’s death, was too real to deny.“On that front, my biggest lesson was that emotions can be a positive thing inyour life. And a lot of other stuff began to shift. The whole big tangle aboutwhether I was lovable and could love someone else—that could fill a book byitself. But if you lay every issue out in advance, you’d be paralyzed. I’m abeliever in letting things unfold the way they want to. I don’t fight or resistanything. When you aren’t scared of yourself anymore, you aren’t scared of yourfeelings, either, or of what other people say. You don’t worry about the futureor relive the past.“Somewhere along the line, I wasn’t escaping my pain. I shifted into anothergear and became interested in what was going on with me. It was a project,almost like observing another person under the microscope. When the fear andjudgment are gone, you begin to enjoy the project.”What exactly was this project?“Self-discovery. No single term is good enough, but that will do,” he says.“When you ask ‘Who am I?’ the answer goes through stages.”What stage is he in now?“In a way, I’ve always been in the same stage—a work in progress.”We’re all works in progress, and when all is said and done, that’s the best wayto exist. Knowing what genetics has to say about how every experience leaves animprint on up to hundreds of genes, the process will never stop, because it’snot meant to. To be alive is to join the river of evolution—the real river youcannot step into at the same place twice. The higher healing is about embracingevery experience with an attitude of expanding, growing, and evolving. Whatkeeps life going? Life itself. When we place our trust on this fact, the healingjourney gets where it needs to be, an all-consuming project that expresses thejoy of being alive, here and now."},{"pageContent":"Part Two Healing Is Now A 7-Day Action Plan[images/Chop_9780451495532_epub3_004_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"We began this book by saying that expanding the definition of immunity was anurgent need, because every person’s health is being challenged as never before.You must make sure that your immunity doesn’t reach the tipping point at whichstress, lifestyle disorders, and aging get the upper hand. Now you have theknowledge to follow a new model—the healing self—that will boost immunity andprotect your health for a lifetime.But knowledge is useless until it gets activated. That’s almost too obvious tostate. Motivating people to act tends to face a huge obstacle. Good intentionsfade, and best-laid plans go astray. So we had to ask ourselves how an actionplan can last a lifetime. Nothing less will produce the benefits we’ve beenholding out as a real possibility.The answer came to us by watching young children. Childhood development, asevery parent knows, is fascinating to watch. A four-year-old is playing withpaper dolls and alphabet blocks, then you turn your back for what seems like aninstant, and the same child is reading books and playing hopscotch. Majorchanges have taken place in brain development to coordinate everything needed tolearn how to read, even to do something as simple as hop on one foot withperfect balance.Nature has arranged every step of childhood development to be so effortless thata child doesn’t even know that an earlier self has been discarded for a laterone—and this gave us our clue. Adopting the healing self needs to be soeffortless that in a week, month, or year, major changes have occurred that feelso natural, you can’t remember living any other way.This is the philosophy behind the seven-day plan presented here in Part Two.Each day focuses on a theme that occupies your attention for that day. Monday,for example, contains recommendations about changing to an anti-inflammatorydiet. There are several recommendations in the “Do” category and several in the“Undo” category—we prefer “Undo” to “Don’t” because changing your lifestyleusually involves old choices you need to abandon. No recommendation is betterthan the others; choose whatever appeals to you.On Tuesday you’ll move on to a new theme, stress reduction, putting your focusthere. If you don’t want to continue with the change you made on Monday, that’sfine.After you finish the week and turn the page to the next week, the same themeswill be repeated. Once more you casually choose the changes you want to make. Wefeel that by doing this, putting absolutely no pressure on yourself, yourbodymind will enjoy each change and retain the ones that feel good. To counterinflammation, for example, one person might add nuts to her diet while anotherincreases the amount of fiber. We can’t predict which change will stick, but ifthese two people persist, it’s inevitable that some choices will become part oftheir lifestyle—it’s only a matter of time.Here’s the weekly schedule, covering themes you learned about in Part One.Monday: Anti-inflammation DietTuesday: Stress ReductionWednesday: Anti-agingThursday: Stand, Walk, Rest, SleepFriday: Core BeliefsSaturday: Non-struggleSunday: EvolutionYour only obligation is to follow your own desires, selecting something to do orundo from the list of choices. We recommend that you read the entire section forthat day at least once and go back to it as often as possible for reinforcement.How will your choice turn out? Keep an open mind. This is an experiment with youplaying the role of both scientist and lab rat!For some themes, like following an anti-inflammatory diet, it will be easy tomake simple changes and stick with them, hopefully on a permanent basis. Inother cases, such as taking a half-hour walk every evening, fitting this choiceinto your schedule over a long time span may be more challenging. Just move atyour own pace and always remember that your choices should be enjoyable."},{"pageContent":"MONDAYANTI-INFLAMMATION DIETTODAY’S RECOMMENDATIONS—CHOOSE ONLY ONE.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------DOAdd some anti-inflammatory foods to your diet.Include more organic food to your grocery shopping.Increase the fiber in your diet.Take a probiotic supplement (see this page[Chop_9780451495532_epub3_c012_r1.xhtml#page_182]).Switch to olive or safflower oil.Drink coffee 1 to 5 times a day, preferably at the heavier end.UNDOCut down sharply on your sugar intake.Cut out junk food and fast food.Throw out stale food, including stale cooking oils and leftovers more than a dayold.Reduce overall fat intake.Reduce salt intake.Use no alcohol.Monday’s action plan is about eating to reduce inflammation. We’re targetingdiet for two reasons: first, the changes you make can be incremental, whichmakes it easier to adopt an anti-inflammatory regimen you will stick to overtime; second, the American appetite for excessive sugar, salt, fat, andprocessed food is seen as a major contributor to inflammation. So under “Do” wewant you to add more foods that will support the healing response, while under“Undo” we ask you to cut back on the parts of your diet that aren’t supportinghealing.Diet alone isn’t enough to keep chronic low-level inflammation at bay. Asmedical science keeps discovering more and more ways that inflammation affects ahost of bodily processes, it is beginning to dawn that this is a whole-systemenemy that may be encroaching everywhere. The most general explanation for whatcreates chronic inflammation is twofold. In the first case, white cells andother immune cells swarm to fight a threat that doesn’t actually need theinflammatory response. In this case the cells, having no real assignment, maystart attacking the body’s own cells. In the second case, there is a low-gradethreat that’s real but undetected by the person or their doctor. Then the immuneresponse keeps being triggered without resolving the underlying problem.It’s basically the second case that you can help by changing your diet, which inturn can affect your intestinal tract and the process of digestion. To properlydigest a meal requires an array of micro-organisms, bacteria that break downspecific nutrients. Over time, this colony of bacteria has evolved into its ownecosystem within the body, known as the microbiome. We spent a great deal oftime in our previous book Super Genes discussing the microbiome, which when youfactor in bacterial DNA, amounts to an estimated 2 million genes. Compare thatto the 20,000 genes you were born with and it’s safe to say that we’re abacterial organism.The importance of the microbiome, which exists primarily in the intestines buthas other sites like the skin, vagina, and armpits, is immense, and it isdirectly affected by what you eat. These bacteria aren’t invaders. Themicrobiome is as much your DNA as the DNA inside a heart or brain cell—in fact,human DNA is now known to contain large contributions of microbial DNA thatbecame assimilated over eons of life on Earth.Feel free to skip to the list of “Dos” and “Undos” for today, but somefascinating information about the microbiome has been emerging that we’d like toshare. The body is open to the outside environment with every breath, and thestandard medical model held for many years that the nose and sinus cavities, asthe first location where microbes arrive when they are inhaled, are vulnerablesites. It’s true that dust, allergens, and micro-organisms are filtered throughyour nose and sinuses, but no one suspected that these warm, moistmini-environments are actually alive and thriving with their own microbiome.Yet that’s the reality, and it now seems that human beings have been relating tothe DNA of the microbes inside the nasal-sinus cavity in very complex ways.Actually there are two relationships going on and constantly shifting. Oneconsists of microbe colonies interacting with one another; the other is humaninteraction, spanning a time as brief as a day or as long as our species hasexisted. People who go around with a stuffy nose or congested sinuses all thetime (chronic rhinosinusitis) may not be reacting simply to something in theair, an allergen or pathogen. Instead, some kind of imbalance in this tinymicrobiome may be to blame. It is surmised that bacterial activity leads tochronic inflammation of sinus tissues (a conclusion you won’t be surprised tohear).Another example is the oral microbiome that inhabits our mouth. Hundreds ofspecies of viruses, bacteria, and fungi are involved—don’t apologize if theimage makes you a little queasy. These bond together into a biofilm that coatsall the mucous membranes inside your mouth. Brushing your teeth then usingmouthwash doesn’t remove this very stubborn film, and you wouldn’t want it to.This miniature ecology has evolved over the past 2 million years to keep thehuman species healthy, although how exactly this cooperative relationship worksis by no means understood.One theory holds that the bad bacteria (pathogens) are always present in theoral microbiome but are so outnumbered by the good bacteria that they are keptin check. Disease breaks out if the balance is reversed and the pathogens beginto overpopulate the ecology. This could be triggered by inflammation, but no oneis certain. Other triggers might be responsible. To develop a reliableunderstanding of all microbiome locations, large and small, the Earth MicrobiomeProject and similar endeavors are producing a catalog of the genomes ofthousands of species of microbes inside us. Back in 1972, it was estimated thatbacterial cells outnumbered human cells 10 to 1, but we now know thatmicro-organisms are estimated to be at about a 1 to 1 parity with the body’sactual cells, so mapping all their total DNA is one of the vastest projects inthe history of biology.Without repeating in detail what we covered in Super Genes, here are the mainpoints that pertain to today’s action plan:• The gut microbiome is different from culture to culture. In each of us it isconstantly shifting in response not just to diet, but to stress and evenemotions.• Because of its complexity and the enormous variability from one person to thenext, a “normal” gut microbiome hasn’t been defined yet.• It is generally believed, however, that a flourishing, healthy gut microbiomeis founded on a wide range of natural foods rich in fruits, vegetables, andfiber.• The modern Western diet, which is low in fiber but high in sugar, salt, fat,and processed food, may be seriously degrading the gut microbiome. Otherculprits include emulsifiers and artificial sweeteners.• When the gut microbiome is damaged or degraded, bacteria begin to releaseso-called endotoxins—the by-products of microbial action. If these toxins leakthrough the intestinal wall into the bloodstream, markers for inflammation aretriggered and persist until the toxins are no longer present.From these bullet points a vast amount of information can be extracted, becausewherever the bloodstream extends, which is everywhere, inflammation triggered bythe microbiome can start to create problems. Today, however, we are concernedwith getting your gut microbiome back into a healthy state.THE “DO” SIDEOn some days we will give choices that don’t apply to everyone’s lifestyle, butadopting an anti-inflammatory diet applies essentially to all of us. We’llreference the dietary information that we researched for Super Genes. Theessence is to adopt a natural, organic, whole-foods diet as much as possible.With box-store outlets now offering organic produce, going organic isn’t asexpensive as it once was. But we are aware of the impact on the household budgetof buying whole foods when processed, and fast foods are so much cheaper percalorie. But keep a few things in mind:• You probably don’t need the calories you think you need.People tend to lead sedentary or semi-active lives more and more, particularlyas they age. Such a lifestyle requires drastically fewer calories than you mightthink. The older guidelines put a lower limit per day of eating around 10calories per pound if you are inactive (i.e., if you weigh 150 lbs., you shouldconsume 1,500 calories a day). An average adult who is semi-active was thoughtto need somewhere in the vicinity of 2,000 to 2,500 calories a day.But some reports on extremely sedentary lifestyles cut this figure drastically.What used to be considered a fasting diet, which began in the 1,200- to1,500-calorie range, may well be a normal requirement for people who spend hoursa day working at the computer or playing video games.• Cheap calories are not the same as nutritious calories.America is addicted to empty calories, which also happen to be the leastexpensive. Sugar in the form of corn syrup and various fats like corn oil, whichare extremely cheap for use in processed foods, also have inflammatoryproperties. The calorie curve rises in processed, junk, and fast foods while thenutrition curve—fiber, vitamins, and minerals—declines.• Whole foods are nature’s way.The debate about the unhealthy American diet is over as far as science isconcerned, but people have a long way to catch up. The bottom line—no matterwhat foods you choose—is that the human intestinal tract, including its teemingmicrobiome, is adaptive to more foods than that of any other creature—we are theultimate omnivores. This incredible adaptive ability evolved over tens ofthousands of years entirely on natural whole foods.The spike in sugar, salt, and fat that occurred in the American diet essentiallyafter World War II has happened too fast for our bodies to evolve and adapt. Theshock of the new diet is still with us, and the resulting damage tends tochallenge or even overwhelm our adaptive capacity. Hormonal imbalance, obesity,type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, and excessive insulin production(hyperinsulinemia), and increased food allergies, including suspected glutenallergies, were all once rare and now have become endemic to modern Westernsociety. Ignoring nature’s way has come at a high price.• Whole foods are nonaddictive.It’s undeniably more expensive to buy whole and organic foods, but they aresatisfying to eat and do not lead to the addictive effects of processed, junk,and fast foods. Addictiveness is built into bad foods by habituation, or bydeveloping a constant craving for high levels of sugar and salt, along with thetastes that engender cravings: sweet, sour, and salty. Every “happy meal,” underwhatever name, leans heavily on those three tastes.When you switch to whole organic foods, the money spent on snacks, sodas, icecream, and chocolate declines, helping to balance the budget. Per calorie, thosefoods can be among the most expensive, especially if you favor deluxe ice creamand chocolates.A natural whole-foods diet takes care of a wide range of anti-inflammatoryissues, but what about specific foods? Anti-inflammatory foods have come intofavor with increasing public interest and research studies. If you are primarilyinterested in seeing a list of specific anti-inflammatory foods, the followingare included to reinforce your knowledge, not to tell you that only these“right” foods belong in your diet.FOODS THAT FIGHT INFLAMMATIONFatty cold-water fish (such as salmon, tuna, mackerel, herring)BerriesTree nuts (such as walnuts, almonds, and hazelnuts, but excluding peanuts, agroundnut)SeedsWhole grainsDark leafy greensSoy (including soy milk and tofu)TempehMycoprotein (from mushrooms and other fungi)Low-fat dairy productsPeppers (e.g., bell peppers, various chilies—the hot taste isn’t an indicationof inflammatory effects in the body)TomatoesBeetsTart cherriesGinger and turmericGarlicOlive oilIn their online health publications, Harvard Medical School adds a few otheritems to the list:Cocoa and dark chocolateBasil and many other herbsBlack pepperOther listings add the following:Cruciferous vegetables (cabbage, bok choy, broccoli, cauliflower)AvocadosHot sauceCurry powderCarrotsOrganic turkey breast (substitute for red meats)TurnipsZucchiniCucumbersLeaving aside their anti-inflammatory effects, these are all healthy wholefoods, and making them a mainstay of your diet can only be beneficial. However,the science is still out on whether all of these foods actually have ananti-inflammatory effect in the body, and also what effect, if any, they have onthe microbiome. Still, the fact that your genome and your microbiome respond toeveryday experience strongly suggests that what you eat has whole-systemconsequences.THE COFFEE CONNECTIONMany studies have validated the health benefits of drinking coffee, and quiteoften the mechanism is unknown. A 2015 study of more than 200,000 subjects whosehealth was assessed for thirty years found a 15 percent lower risk of mortalityamong those who drank 1 to 5 cups of coffee a day. We’ve used this as our guide,but drinking at the higher end (4 cups or more a day) seems to increase thebenefits. There are improvements in the risks for type 2 diabetes (perhapsconnected with coffee’s ability to lower blood sugar), heart attacks and strokes(probably linked to an anti-inflammatory effect), liver cancer (cause unknown),suicide (cause unknown), and disorders as diverse as gallstones and Parkinson’s.Because the most probable link with living longer is reduced inflammation, we’vechosen this as the best reason to drink coffee. For longevity, it doesn’t seemto matter whether the coffee is caffeinated or decaffeinated. Since coffeedrinkers are more likely to smoke, it’s important to note that increasedlongevity applied after removing smoking from the equation. (Also, tea andespecially green tea are claimed to have broad health benefits, most likely dueto an anti-inflammation connection, but research is less extensive andconclusive than for coffee.) Rather than jump on coffee as a magic elixir, youshould add it to the list of beneficial foods while keeping the broader picturein mind.PREBIOTICSIn tandem with the mounting research on the microbiome, there is skyrocketinginterest in foods that keep the microbiome healthy. You’ve probably heard aboutprobiotics, which are either foods or supplements that add beneficial microbesto the intestinal tract. On the other hand, prebiotics are foods or supplementscontaining plant fiber that nourish the microbes that already exist inside yourdigestive system.As a general rule, and keeping up with the best research, you should focus firston prebiotics in order to keep the microbiome from releasing endotoxins thattrigger the inflammation response. Throwing new bacteria into the mix won’t behelpful if your diet is low in fiber, as the typical American diet tends to be.The government recommendation for fiber intake is 24 grams a day of both solubleand insoluble fiber, which is roughly twice what a typical American dietcontains. You don’t necessarily need to start counting grams of fiber, althoughthey are now listed on the nutrition labels of processed foods.Once you consume whole foods, especially fruits and vegetables, your fiberintake will be healthy. The most basic soluble fiber is cellulose, theundigested bulk in all plant foods. But cellulose is what the microbes in yourdigestive tract thrive on. Fiber has been touted for decades as a preventive forheart disease, going back to initial findings from African tribes who consumedenormous amounts of fiber and exhibited almost no heart disease. But the panaceasoon faded, because other preventive factors were at work, such as abundantexercise and low stress in an indigenous tribal life compared with lifestyles inWestern cultures. What makes fiber so attractive still is its broad-spectrumbenefits. Not only does fiber fight against inflammation, but it also buffersthe digestion of sugars (helpful in some type 2 diabetes); makes you feel full(which helps with overeating); and preserves the health of the lining of thedigestive tract (which may be a crucial factor in some colorectal cancers, forexample).Eating a variety of soluble and insoluble fiber is a good idea, selecting fromthe following easy-to-find sources.SOLUBLE FIBERBeans and peasWhole grains (including oatmeal, whole wheat bread, and multigrain breads)All fruits, but especially those with more soluble fiber than insoluble:apricots, grapefruit, mangoes, and orangesAll vegetables—especially the cruciferous (cabbage) family, which are very highin soluble fiber: cabbage, brussels sprouts, broccoli, bok choy, and so forthFlaxseedsPsyllium, a vegetable extract that is the basis of most commercial fibersupplements—also the only fiber supplement known to reduce levels of the “bad”LDL cholesterolINSOLUBLE FIBEROat bran, often taken as a supplementBran-based breakfast cerealsShredded wheat breakfast cerealsNuts and seedsBeans and lentilsFruits and vegetables in generalPROBIOTICSProbiotic foods contain living bacteria. Active yogurt is the most popularprobiotic advertised on TV and sold in the supermarket, but there’s alsopickles, sauerkraut, kimchi (a traditional Korean fermented cabbage dish), andkefir (a fermented milk drink that tastes similar to yogurt). Including one ofthese foods during a meal helps to reset your microbiome by introducingbeneficial bacteria that will colonize the walls of the intestine and hopefullyreduce or drive out harmful bacteria. Because of the complexity of themicrobiome and the huge differences from one person to another, there is nocompletely reliable prediction on the effects of probiotic foods. The best thingis to try them—all are completely harmless—and then look for results.Probiotic supplements are a booming business that’s expected to risedramatically in the future. Health food stores offer a bewildering variety ofthese supplements, some in pill form to be taken on a full stomach, others inperishable form that must be refrigerated. There is no expert medical adviceabout the best probiotic supplements, for the simple fact that the microbiome istoo complex to fully understand as of now. It should also be noted that areliable supplement that contains 1 billion bacteria will enter a gut ecology of100 trillion microbes. Outnumbered 100,000 to 1, the supplement may havenegligible impact. To be optimistic, on the other hand, any opportunity to raisethe microbiome to a state of natural balance is worth taking. A supplement can’tsubstitute in any significant way for getting your probiotics through food, yetit’s an easy choice to take a supplement.As a side note, you can augment the anti-inflammatory effect by adding a babyaspirin, or half an adult aspirin, to your daily routine. The aspirin is aproven way to lower the risk of heart attack and some kinds of cancer, such ascolorectal, melanoma, ovarian, and pancreatic cancer. To date, however, thestrongest evidence is confined to colorectal cancer; other results have beenhit-or-miss, according to Harvard Medical School. (Be sure to consult yourdoctor before combining aspirin with other drugs, particularly those that haveanti-inflammatory or blood-thinning properties.)THE “UNDO” SIDEThe choices we’ve listed will come as no surprise to anyone who has paidattention to years of warnings about the imbalances in the typical Americandiet. If you can begin to eliminate the excessive salt, sugar, and fat in yourdiet, that’s the best way to complement adding natural organic foods. But thereare a few bullet points to consider:• Start improving as early as you can.Dietary cravings get worse the longer they persist. Children who start out lifeon a high-sugar, high-salt diet soon adapt to it as their default normal diet.You may not still be young, but as a parent you need to set a good example forthe whole family.• Don’t let age catch up with you.As people age, their diet typically declines. They move in the direction ofconvenience foods, although these aren’t necessarily bad now that the freezersection includes lots of healthy choices that are much lower in sodium and fatthan even a decade ago. There is also a tendency for older people to favor amono diet, or close to it, in which only a handful of foods are preferred. Thisis very unhealthy as you age.The intestinal tract becomes less efficient as we get older, which means amongother things that we don’t assimilate vitamins and minerals the way we did whenwe were younger. In some studies the effects of dementia and memory loss havebeen reversed dramatically by restoring trace minerals like manganese and zincto the diet. Even doctors rarely think about mineral deficiencies, but if youare older, it’s good advice to take a multipurpose vitamin that fulfills thedaily requirements for minerals. Even better is to keep eating awell-established natural whole-foods diet.At the same time, when age-related decline in kidney function is added to thepicture, there can be a lack of water-soluble vitamins (vitamin C and the Bcomplex), which get passed out in the urine. Supplements of these vitamins arehelpful, particularly if your diet hasn’t gotten rid of things that needundoing.• Consider no alcohol.Alcohol has a fixed place in American social culture, and most people use it oneway or another. The benefits of alcohol in preventing heart disease seem to besound, as long as intake is limited to one drink a day—usually a glass of wineat dinner. Research now suggests that the fabled benefits of red wine in theFrench diet aren’t unique—it’s the alcohol itself that is beneficial.Harvard Medical School’s website states that moderate alcohol consumption iseven anti-inflammatory, which seems counterintuitive. The red noses of heavydrinkers is a sign of both inflammation and liver damage. The anti-inflammatorybenefits of alcohol vanish and turn into inflammation as the result of excessiveconsumption.For many people, one drink can easily lead to two or three. In addition, acertain percentage of drinkers will become alcoholics; moreover, as people age,loneliness, boredom, and a sedentary lifestyle can lead to more drinking. So inthe overall picture, there are enough pitfalls to alcohol that you shouldseriously consider them. We’d be happier if alcohol was cut to a bare minimum (aglass of wine when eating out in a restaurant).• Keep it fresh.One of the reasons that antioxidants have become popular is to counter roamingoxygen in the bloodstream known as free radicals—in other words, oxygen atomsthat quickly latch on to other chemicals. This chemical reaction is totallynecessary in the healing response at wound sites, for example, so it is toosimplistic to claim that free radicals are “bad.”However, a simple way to outmaneuver the whole issue is to eat fresh food andthrow out stale cooking oils, leftovers more than a day old, freezer-burnedfood, and the like. Staleness is associated with oxidation and also a host ofmicro-organisms that potentially have an inflammatory effect. In any case,staleness isn’t what you want in the first place. Since cold-pressed virginolive oil is especially good for anti-inflammation but also is one of the oilsthat goes stale quickly upon exposure to air, it’s best to store the bottle inthe refrigerator and keep at room temperature only the amount you need for twoor three days.Just as it’s not enough to focus totally on a laundry list of anti-inflammatoryfoods, don’t fixate on other foods as somehow bad or unhealthy. We want you touse common sense when reading the following list of foods that have been taggedas having inflammatory properties.FOODS TO LIMIT OR AVOIDRed meatSaturated and trans fats (e.g., animal fats and the hydrogenated vegetable fatsfound in many processed foods)White breadWhite riceFrench friesSugary sodasTo these, other reliable sources add the following:White sugar and corn syrup (frequently hidden in processed foods that aren’tprimarily sweet)Omega-6 fatty acids (see below)Monosodium glutamate (MSG)Gluten (see this page [Chop_9780451495532_epub3_c009_r1.xhtml#page_125])Our feeling is that an anti-inflammatory diet has to be better than aninflammatory one, because the foods that are proven risks—junk food, fast food,fatty and sugary foods—also lead to inflammation. The link between inflammationand chronic disease is too strong to ignore, and paying attention has manybenefits.A note on omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids: For decades the public has beenconditioned to regard cholesterol as a “bad” fat even though cholesterol is abiochemical found in every cell and is necessary for cellular development. Thesame has happened in reverse with omega-3 fatty acids. We go along with thegeneral recommendation that cold-water fish high in omega-3s, like salmon andtuna, are beneficial. But the story is more complicated than this.There is another group of fatty acids known as omega-6. Both omega-3s andomega-6s are needed in the diet; our bodies don’t produce them. It turns out,however, that omega-6s in excess have a strong link to inflammation. Moreover,since both groups often occur together, the harmful effect of the omega-6s canundo the benefits of omega-3s. In short, the two must be kept in balance. AllWestern diets are too high in omega-6s because of the heavy use ofpolyunsaturated cooking oils. Yet these oils, made from vegetable sources—corn,soy, sunflower, and so on—were once considered the healthiest ones, withlowering risk factors for heart attack as the primary support for this claim.Today the evidence has strongly moved in another direction. Studies ofindigenous peoples (who use few processed vegetable oils and eat no processedpackaged foods) indicate that the ratio of omega-6s to omega-3s in their diet isabout 4:1. In contrast, Western diets are 15 to 40 times too high in omega-6foods, with an average ratio of omega-6s to omega-3s of 16:1. At such highlevels, the omega-6 fatty acids block the benefits of the omega-3s. Geneticstudies aren’t easy to come by in this area, but it’s speculated that we evolvedin hunter-gatherer societies to consume a diet even lower in omega-6s, with aratio of omega-6s to omega-3s closer to 2:1. In the body, getting closer to a1:1 ratio seems ideal, according to some experts.Among foods high in omega-6s, cooking oil leads the way, but there are others,as follows.MAIN SOURCES OF OMEGA-6 FATTY ACIDSProcessed vegetable oils—highest are sunflower, corn, soy, and cottonseedProcessed foods using soy oilGrain-fed beef“Factory-raised” chicken and porkNon-free-range eggsFatty cuts of conventionally raised meatsUnfortunately, the polyunsaturated oils that are a major part of standarddisease prevention turn out to have a serious drawback in terms of inflammation.The only vegetable oil that is low in omega-6s and also high in omega-3s isflaxseed oil. Safflower, canola, and olive oil aren’t particularly high inomega-3s but are the lowest in omega-6s among commonly sold vegetable oils, witholive oil the best.Adding to the confusion, “bad” saturated fats like lard, butter, palm oil, andcoconut oil are low in omega-6s. This is one reason why standard prevention hasbegun to recommend a balance of saturated and polyunsaturated fats. But the realculprit, it seems, isn’t so much the food we eat in its natural state butprocessed foods. Soy oil is cheap and readily available, lending itself to usein hundreds of packaged foods. Beef from cattle raised in feedlots on grain toachieve maximum bulk in the shortest period of time is much higher in omega-6sthan grass-fed beef (not to mention the widespread use of antibiotics andhormones in the beef and dairy industry). Also high in omega-6s are pork andchicken produced on conventional grain feed in the “factory” system, along withfactory eggs.If you are going to eat meat, we advise switching to grass-fed beef, along withnaturally fed (also called pastured) chickens and their eggs. “Free range” isn’talways reliable, since the birds might still be receiving some conventionalfeed. Of course, this isn’t always an easy or viable option. Grass-red beef andpoultry can be expensive and often are only found in specialty stores. So dowhat you can. Overall, rebalancing the fatty acids in your diet comes down tosome easy steps once you are conscious of the issue. Don’t fixate on this oneaspect of your diet—everything on the list is compatible with the whole foodsyou should be moving to, step-by-step.HOW TO BALANCE FATTY ACIDS• Cook with safflower and olive oil; canola oil isn’t as good but is acceptable.• Eat unsalted or low-salt tree nuts, including walnuts, almonds, pecans, andBrazil nuts. Limit the amount of fatty nuts, such as cashews and macadamias, aswell as peanuts.• Eat seeds, including unsalted chia, sunflower, pumpkin, hemp, and flaxseeds.• Eat fatty fish—no more than 6 ounces per week as well as mycoprotein-basedproducts. If vegetarian, eat more tree nuts that are lower in fat, such aswalnuts and almonds, and seeds.• Avoid packaged foods with soy oil high in the list of ingredients.• Don’t cook with soy, sunflower, or corn oil.• Cut back or eliminate conventionally raised beef, pork, and chicken.• With any meat and poultry, buy lean cuts and trim the fat from other cuts.The interaction of food with the bodymind is at once fascinating and complex. Wewanted to give you some in-depth information, but when it comes to thepracticalities, you should move at your own pace and remember that transformingyour diet is a marathon, not a sprint. What’s important aren’t the choices youmake but the good choices you stick with over time.That’s why our action plan for dietary changes involves some of the simplest,most direct steps in healing the whole system that you can take. Everyone shouldgive them high priority. But if present trends continue, a lot more focus isgoing to be placed on the microbiome and its connection to inflammation. Diet isonly one factor, which will come as no surprise in our whole-system approach. Toreally do more to heal and balance your microbiome, you need to think in termsof the bodymind as a whole. Here is a helpful list that gathers the bestinformation to date about lifestyle and the microbiome. Such a lifestyle wouldinclude all the choices covered in today’s action plan, but it means going a fewsteps further.THE OPTIMUM LIFESTYLE FOR A HEALTHY GUT MICROBIOMEEating less fat, sugar, and refined carbohydratesAdding sufficient prebiotics on which bacteria feed: fiber from whole fruits,vegetables, and grainsAvoiding chemically processed foodsEliminating alcohol consumptionTaking a probiotic supplementEating probiotic foods like yogurt, sauerkraut, and picklesReducing foods with inflammatory effectsFocusing on foods with anti-inflammatory effects, like freshly squeezed orangejuiceManaging stress diligentlyAttending to “inflamed” emotions like anger and hostilityChecking for medical causes of inflammation such as yeast infection and stressControlling weight gainAs you can see, being totally free of inflammation is the same as leading ahealing lifestyle in general. That’s why we focus today on diet as the singlebest way to deal with the problem. In other aspects of your life, such as losingweight or stress management, inflammation doesn’t really need to be singledout—these measures are for the whole system and general well-being."},{"pageContent":"TUESDAYSTRESS REDUCTIONTODAY’S RECOMMENDATIONS—CHOOSE ONLY ONE.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------DOMeditate.Go to a yoga class.Practice mindful breathing.Schedule downtime and quiet time.Practice being centered.Recognize the stages of stress (this page[Chop_9780451495532_epub3_c006_r1.xhtml#page_81]).UNDOStop adding to a stressful situation.Refrain from ignoring stressful events in your life.Walk away from stress as soon as you can.Resolve a repeated stress.Examine a problem you have been putting up with out of frustration.Turn irregular habits into a regular routine.Unlike chronic inflammation, which very often lurks beneath the surface and goesundetected, stress is an enemy that hides in plain sight. On any given day, theaverage person knowingly confronts the same stressors over and over: excessivenoise and haste; overlapping demands at home and at work; sensory overloadeverywhere; frustrations driving a car in traffic; and too little time in theday to accomplish everything that needs to be done. What external stressors allhave in common is pressure, and everyone knows what pressure feels like. Ifexternal stressors were the real problem, resolving stress would not be muchharder than removing a rock from your shoe—having felt the discomfort, you’ddeal with it as soon as possible.But as we know, stress is often much more complicated than that. The fact thatwe all put up with so much stress is testimony to how badly we deal with it.Today we want you to turn the corner and begin to seriously reduce the stress inyour life. You may be good at putting up with daily stress, but in tinyincremental steps your cells are adversely affected anyway. On this page[Chop_9780451495532_epub3_c006_r1.xhtml#page_81] we listed the three stages ofhow stress affects people, first psychologically and mentally, then in theirbehavior, and ultimately in the form of physical damage. But waiting until thethird stage, when symptoms like hypertension and digestive problems appear,would be very shortsighted. Stress will have gained the upper hand long before.WHEN STRESS GETS THE UPPER HANDIf people complain about stress all the time, constantly hear about its damagingeffects, and yet still do little to nothing about it, what has gone wrong? Thechoices we’ve listed for today aren’t novel or surprising. Meditation and yogaare now so familiar that taking them up should be far more widespread than itis. Scheduling downtime and quiet time during the workday should be routine.Learning to stay centered in a stressful situation should be a coping mechanismlearned from a young age.Clearly the first and most important step in reducing stress is a change ofattitude. Otherwise, your ability to deal with the pressures of everyday lifewill remain stuck where it is now, a half-hearted stab at coping without much inthe way of results. In a way, the situation is akin to crash dieting. As wementioned earlier and as most people realize, temporary diets don’t keep weightoff. The number of dieters who successfully keep more than five pounds off fortwo years is under 2 percent. But in the face of these dismal facts, Americansdiet constantly, and small fortunes are made by promoters of the newest faddiet. In other words, people keep doing more of what never worked in the firstplace—and many people do the same with stress.So that you can begin to change your attitude toward stress, here’s a list ofthe things that never worked in the first place.WHY STRESS KEEPS WINNINGINEFFECTIVE RESPONSES TO EVERYDAY STRESSORS:We consider it normal to be a little stressed.We feel helpless in the face of external forces.The signs of distress (irritability, fatigue, mental dullness) are ignored.Our coping mechanisms are too limited (see this page[Chop_9780451495532_epub3_c006_r1.xhtml#page_74]).We think that putting up with stress is harmless.We’re in denial or just plain unaware of how stressed we are.We’ve heard that it’s possible to thrive on stress.These beliefs and actions are self-defeating, but each holds a grain of truth.If you live in a noisy city or work on a construction site, the racket allaround you is beyond your control. Putting up with stress isn’t harmless, but ifyou’re stuck in traffic or have a newborn baby in the house, there’s not muchelse you can do. No one thrives on stress, not at the cellular level, but someambitious, successful people claim that they owe their success to an appetitefor high-stress situations in which they can prove that they are winners. Thesegrains of truth serve as cover for a reality that people aren’t willing to face:stress is the epidemic of modern life.For this point to really sink in, let’s illustrate it. First, a typical day forA, a young husband and father rising in his career. A wakes up a bit late andrushes to get ready for work. He hears the kids fighting in another room andyells for them to stop. On his way out the door he kisses his wife and says he’sin too much of a hurry to grab breakfast. Traffic is bad, so he’s not in thebest mood when he gets to the office, where his boss is staring at his watch andreminds A that there’s a big deadline coming up.After a staff meeting at which the whole team is pushed to produce results, Aslows down enough to take a coffee-and-doughnut break. A little guiltily heloosens up with a drink at lunch, and he feels less tense the rest of theafternoon. The afternoon commute isn’t so bad, and A feels pretty good when hegets home. He settles into his familiar domestic routine, spending a few minuteswith the kids and a few hours online. His wife has learned to put up with this.A gets steamed when he goes to a provocative news site—damn politicians. Beforegoing to bed he attacks some work he brought home with him. A and his wife stillhave an active sex life, but they’re both too tired tonight. There’s always theweekend.By no means is this a parody of how millions of people spend a typical weekday.Every event is a stress point, but by society’s standards, A is leading the goodlife, or doing what it takes to get there. A generation ago, when stress was anew topic, someone’s typical day might include chain smoking, imbibingconsiderably more alcohol, and more burdens on women in the home. Medicine knowsa vast amount about the effects of stress all the way down to the epigeneticlevel, where negative experiences leave marks that alter genetic activity. Yetthis knowledge hasn’t translated into how we lead our lives. Today we want youto ease into a self-aware approach to reducing everyday stress in your life.THE “DO” SIDEAll the recommended choices related to stress focus on getting out ofsympathetic overdrive, which we devoted an entire earlier chapter to. Theopposite of stress is relaxation. Practices like meditation and yoga go farbeyond simple physical relaxation, even beyond finding mental peace and quiet.But relaxation is a start, because without it, the bodymind is dealing withdisruptions due to stress, and this preoccupation blocks the ability to supportsubtler experiences. Both authors strongly endorse the Eastern wisdomtraditions, which have higher consciousness as their foundation. We endorse thehigher healing that arrives with higher consciousness. But on the basis of firstthings first, people need to return to a default state of relaxation throughoutthe bodymind.Meditation: The one stress-reduction practice we could list for every day of theweek is meditation, because of its holistic benefits. So far in this book we’vebeen open ended about which type of meditation you might prefer. Mindfulnessmeditations are popular; meditating on the breath is effortless; meditating onthe heart is appealing to many who have an inclination toward devotion. Thereare countless books and websites that allow you to explore the whole subject.There are scant experiments that compare one meditation to another in order toefficiently prove that there is a “best” meditation. In truth, best isn’t anapplicable term. The style of meditation that you are comfortable with and thatwill become a lifelong practice is by definition the best meditation. Peopledrop their meditation practice when they no longer feel any benefits; they keepwith a practice if they sense continual personal growth. None of this ispredictable. (Sometimes meditation gets dropped simply because life is goingwell, which is taken as a sign that meditation has already done its job.) Interms of the most proven benefits, the nod probably goes to mantra meditationbecause of its ancient roots in India, where literally hundreds of mantras havespecific effects; the ultimate effect is enlightenment, or total self-awarenessundisturbed by external events.A simple mantra technique that has no religious connotations is as follows:• Sit in a quiet, softly lit room. Close your eyes for a minute or two. If youfeel sleepy, lie down and nap rather than starting to meditate.• When you feel centered and your breathing is relaxed and regular, silently saythe mantra So hum.• Repeat the mantra for 5 to 20 minutes, depending on individual circumstancesand how much you enjoy meditating.• Do not repeat the mantra mechanically—this isn’t silent chanting. Instead, saySo hum when it comes to mind to repeat it. There can be gaps as short as a fewseconds or as long as several minutes. Mantra meditation calms the mind not bystopping the thinking process, but by allowing the mind to settle into anaturally quiet state. There is no question of forcing and nothing mechanical.No magic is involved. The repetition settles the mind through its naturalinclination to be quieter and calmer.• It doesn’t matter if thoughts intrude—they always will. Thoughts are a naturalpart of meditation. Simply return gently to the mantra. There are no minimumgoals for how often the mantra gets repeated. If you say it once and then dozeoff, that’s a good meditation. You needed the rest. If you say the mantra onceand go into deep meditation, that’s also good, and everything in between.• Meditation allows the bodymind to rebalance itself through stress release. Inthe course of stress release, any sensation or thought can arise. This isnormal, effective meditation. If a physical sensation is so strong you cannotthink the mantra easily, then put your attention on the area in your body whereyou feel the sensation. Let your awareness be with the sensation without tryingto change it in any way. After a moment or so, the sensation will fade. If itdoesn’t and you feel persistent discomfort, open your eyes for a few minutes. Ifthe discomfort doesn’t fade away, lie down and rest until it does. (Actualpersistent pain requires a doctor’s consultation.) Don’t mind negative thoughts:they will come and go. This is a natural aspect of meditation. However, if thenegative thoughts feel overpowering, open your eyes and breathe easily until thethoughts subside. Once the intense thoughts have subsided, you can resumemeditation.• After the designated time is up, relax and enjoy the meditative state, eyesclosed, breathing easily. To assimilate the relaxed state even more completely,lie down for 5 minutes. Don’t rush back into full activity; ease back into yourdaily routine if circumstances permit.• How often you meditate is up to you. Twice a day, morning and evening, isdesirable once you choose to make meditation a permanent part of your lifestyle.In support of their practice, many people join a meditation group or go onmeditation retreats. Again, this is a personal choice, but one benefit is thatwith group support, you are less likely to let your meditation practice dropoff.Mindful breathing: Today this technique is used to counteract the feeling ofbeing stressed. We’ve already mentioned it in connection with being mindful atthe office (see this page [Chop_9780451495532_epub3_c003_r1.xhtml#page_41]). Sothat you don’t have to thumb back to another page, we repeat the instructionshere:• If possible, find a quiet, softly lit room where you can be alone, althoughthis isn’t a necessity.• Close your eyes and center yourself.• Now take deep, relaxed breaths on the count of 4 for each in-breath and 6 foreach out-breath. If this becomes an exertion or you begin to gasp, don’t forceanything. Breathe normally until you catch your breath, then return to mindfulbreathing.• Continue for a minimum of 10 breaths. If you feel the need for more, continuemindful breathing for 5 to 10 minutes.THE “UNDO” SIDEToday the “undo” choices are about detaching yourself from stressful situationswhen you might otherwise be tempted to stay. These are often minor things thatcause momentary tension. But even these can cause a stress reaction that youdon’t need. The key is to pay attention to your feelings and the sensations youmight feel in your body. Check in with yourself several times today and ask ifyou feel tense, uncomfortable, tight, or pressured. This feeling can be eitherphysical or mental: as far as stress goes, they are equal. Your goal today is toextricate yourself from a negative situation, find a way to be alone, and regaina relaxed, centered state.When stress is more than incidental, more is called for. We take seriously thefact that stress is winning in many if not most people’s lives. Therefore, toundo your entangled relationship with stress, we need to discuss the problem andits solution in depth.STRESS IN DEPTH: THE INSIDE STORYExternal stressors are generally the kind that get the most attention fromresearchers. Mice are useful subjects in the laboratory, but they don’t have aninner life comparable to that of humans, so stress experiments with mice havecentered on external physical stressors. In one famous experiment, mice wereplaced on a metal plate that emitted tiny harmless electric shocks. The shockswere administered at random, and after only a few days, the mice showedextensive damage to their immune system. They behaved nervously and erratically;some were weak to the point of total exhaustion or death.The reason that harmless shocks caused this drastic deterioration is aninvisible factor: unpredictability. The anticipation of the shocks was like thesword of Damocles hanging over the animals’ heads. Being unable to predict thefuture, while knowing that another shock was inevitable, kept the mice in aperpetual state of inner stress. As applied to humans, we’ve already mentionedthat stress becomes worse when it is random, unpredictable, repeated, and out ofa person’s control. But the mouse study made another critical point: innerstress is as potent, or more potent, than external stress. The anticipation ofpain distresses us as much as the pain itself.This provides the key for reducing stress: approach it from the inside. Youcan’t control any number of external stressors, but you can control yourperception and interpretation. Imagine the difference between going to a concertand hearing the cymbals give a resounding climax in Tchaikovsky’s 1812 Overture,which you enjoy and welcome. Contrast that with a stranger walking up behind youand crashing a pair of cymbals in your ear. Same external stimulus, verydifferent inner response. Pleasure turns into an intrusive assault.Previously we gave the “baby solution” to acute stress (this page[Chop_9780451495532_epub3_c006_r1.xhtml#page_74]) based on what parents of anewborn infant can do to bring their stress levels down. Now we want to extendthose strategies to chronic everyday stress, which is the kind that causes themost damage over a long period of time. By changing your perception andinterpretation of external stressors, you can greatly reduce the effects ofstress.RANDOMNESS AND UNPREDICTABILITYThese two factors are related, since by definition random events areunpredictable. Part of letting stress win is our appetite for shock andsurprise. As much as disasters and catastrophes are terrible occurrences, thenews cycle has gone from one hour of major network news a night to 24/7 cableand Internet news that reinforces a craving to watch bad news over and over.Violent video games and action/adventure movies feed the same craving inimaginary ways. But the burst of adrenaline that is triggered by the stressresponse doesn’t know the difference between real and imaginary. At a certainpoint, even if you don’t become an adrenaline junkie, somewhere inside youprobably have a positive image of a life built upon intense conflict and action(more likely if you are a male).Taken altogether, randomness has become the everyday chaos we have all adaptedto. You need to view the chaos as a factor that increases your stress levels,not an inevitable aspect of life. Of course, life is always unpredictable, andthere is such a thing as creative uncertainty. Not knowing the next painting orpiece of music one will make is part of the pleasure that comes with beingcreative. But in daily life, bringing chaos under control is still important.Here are some steps to consider:• Make your daily routine more regular. Get up and go to bed at the same timeevery day. Eat three meals a day at regular times.• Develop a predictable lifestyle and bring erratic behavior under control. Thisis very important as a parent with young children, because predictability buildstrust. At work, predictability builds loyalty and cooperation. In relationships,it builds intimacy.• Being predictable isn’t the same as being boring and without originality.Instead, you want to be predictable in the following ways:~ You don’t show anger and frustration.~ You don’t criticize people in public.~ You are responsible.~ You carry out what you promise to do.~ You can be counted on for follow-through.~ You welcome open communication.~ Your door is always open.~ You let others have their own space.• Having established yourself as predictable, you encourage other people,especially family members, to follow your example.• Guard against future risks (e.g., with adequate insurance, following healthprevention, maintaining your car in good working order).• Develop a support network to help in times of trouble. Do your part to supportothers.• Face crises head-on. As the situation unfolds, talk about what’s going on withyour family and friends. Don’t isolate yourself or tough things out by going italone.LACK OF CONTROLStress is aggravated when you feel you aren’t in control. In animal experiments,control always belongs to the experimenter, but in nature animals organizethemselves in societies where dominance is clear cut. An alpha male in a monkeytroop spends time and energy preserving his status, but what doesn’t change isthat a single male will have such a status and that subordinate males will findtheir place in the pack and accept it. In humans the situation is so complex,however, that animal models often seem irrelevant. The mythical mailroom boydreams of rising to become CEO—unlike animals, we wish, hope, aspire, andstrategize.Control, then, is about matching our inner conception with what’s going onaround us. If you feel in control on the inside, you are in control. Externalevents may not put you in a leadership role, but that doesn’t matter comparedwith the ability to cope with stress by not losing control. Imagine a hundredcars stuck in a bad traffic jam. If one could hook up each driver to monitorsfor heart rate, blood pressure, brain activity, and respiration, there would bea hundred different responses, each dependent on an inner interpretation of theevent.At the negative end of the spectrum the most stressed-out drivers would beresponding in any of the following ways:• They resent being inconvenienced.• They dwell on how often they get trapped in traffic.• They expect things to work out the way they want them to, and when they don’t,frustration boils over.• They give in to reflex anger.• They blame other drivers, who are idiots.• They become sulky and irritable with other passengers in the car.• They get anxious about being late.It’s normal to feel some of these things, but they rise in intensity with peoplewho tend to be type A personalities. You don’t have to be a so-called controlfreak to be stressed when a situation is beyond your control. However, if youdemand of yourself that you must always be in charge, you will be at adisadvantage when coping with situations that don’t meet your expectations.Controlling personalities are difficult to live with, all the more because theyfrequently think that their way is the only way—in fact, this is a hallmark ofthe controlling personality. Another hallmark is that they always find a way toblame others while excusing themselves. They are perfectionists about detail andwill be just as critical over a misspelled word in a report as over a failedproject. Their demands are never totally met; they give praise grudgingly or notat all; they expect others to live by the same values and standards they set forthemselves (as in the boss who says, “I don’t ask you to do anything that Iwouldn’t do myself”). Emotionally, they are tightly wound, anxious, and afraidto show emotion because it reveals weakness and vulnerability.This description offers a general warning about the responses that do not workwhen you feel that a situation is going out of control. To some degree, all ofus are tempted to impose our will, to make demands on others, to insist that ourway is the only way, and so on. Seen from the inside, however, the root cause isanxiety and fear. To bring anxiety to rest, it is certainly necessary to regaincontrol, with inner control coming first, then making an effort to bring theoutside situation back from the brink of disorder.Here are some steps to consider:• Learn to center yourself. This is a skill that develops naturally with thepractice of meditation. But everyone has from time to time experienced feelingsof being centered—that is, calm, quiet, alert, observant, and grounded. For manypeople the feeling is centered in their chest.• Learn to recognize when you are not centered. This state is also familiar toeveryone. It is marked by anxiety; racing thoughts; uncertainty; feeling rattledby the outside situation; a pounding heart; shallow, ragged breathing;butterflies in the stomach; and muscle tightness and tension.• Develop the ability to get back to your center whenever you are thrown out ofit. This ability follows from the first two points—once you recognize that youaren’t centered, you can return to the feeling of being centered again. To dothis, several simple techniques are useful:• Recognize the stressor.• Walk away from the stressful situation.• Find a quiet place to be alone.• Close your eyes and place your attention in the region of your heart.• Use mindful breathing: Take deep, regular breaths, counting 4 on the in-breathand 6 on the out-breath.• If you have the time, meditate after you feel calmer and more centered.• Continue the above until you are back in your comfort zone.• Don’t rush back into the stressful situation. Give yourself a few hours, orpreferably a day, to remain in an unstressed state.• If you find yourself in a situation at work in which you have no control, dosomething about it. Companies are beginning to realize that workers thrive whengiven freedom of choice to make their own decisions and accept moreresponsibility. It’s not mandatory that you remain in a job where higherauthority controls everything down to the smallest detail and a strict code ofrules is enforced. Try asking for more decision-making power and freedom tooffer your own solutions. If these requests are rejected, look squarely at whereyou stand and make plans accordingly.• Examine your own controlling behavior. Take an honest look in the mirror andmove toward being more accepting and nonjudgmental, less critical and demanding.These are the most glaring traits of a rigid approach to self-control.• Pay attention to relaxing and being less demanding on yourself.• Learn to bend with the situation before you step in to interfere and bendthings to your will.• Find ways to be playful.• Put a high value on making someone else happy.REPETITIONStress is cumulative; the more often it’s repeated, the worse the damage itcauses. A straw wouldn’t break the camel’s back if thousands of straws hadn’tpreceded it. This lesson is so simple and self-evident that one would think itdidn’t need to be learned over and over. But subjecting yourself to repeatedstress is likely to be something you do without thinking about it. Old marriedcouples have the same arguments for years or decades until it turns into aritual. Politicians raise our blood pressure by lying and sidestepping theissues, as if this hasn’t been true since politics began. Parents raise theirvoice at misbehaving children, who ignore them or stop misbehaving for a littlewhile until they misbehave again.Self-inflicted stress is usually marked by repetition. It falls under thecategory, already touched upon, of disregarding futile behavior, or “doing moreof what didn’t work in the first place.” In the same vein, we continue to put upwith things that stressed us out in the first place. It’s the passive side ofthe syndrome: the wife who sighs when her husband puts her down for thethousandth time; the mother who can’t keep the kids from fighting; the officeworker who grits his teeth under an abusive boss; the disruptive student who hasturned getting sent to detention into a habit.The passive side of the syndrome is victimization, allowing bad things to repeatthemselves because you feel you deserve it or can’t make it stop. The activeside of the syndrome is willfulness, stubbornly repeating the sameself-defeating behavior because you insist on getting things to turn out the wayyou want them to. At the cellular level the story is the same from eitherviewpoint. A low-grade stress response keeps returning over and over.Having seen what doesn’t work, what does? We feel, and have advised in previousbooks, that you need to assess what you can fix, what you must put up with, andwhat you should walk away from. Most people endure repeated stress because theycan’t make up their minds. They waver between these three alternatives,sometimes making a stab at fixing things, other times putting up with a badsituation (the most common default response), and only walking away if worsecomes to worst. Domestic abuse is a notorious example of this confusion, andeven when the abused spouse manages to walk away, this often turns out to beonly a temporary respite before they return. Short of such an extreme, however,all of us tend to endure situations of repeated stress because ofindecisiveness. The kind of stress that keeps getting repeated may start out assomething minor, but a steady drip-drip leads to a buildup, and then it’s notthe stressor itself that becomes the main problem, but the suppressed anger,resentment, and frustration that take their toll.Indecision keeps you in suspense, which is the same as anticipating pain, which,as we’ve alluded to, has been shown to be as stressful as actually experiencingpain. Decisiveness, on the other hand, restores one’s sense of being in control.There is no guarantee that the outcome will be entirely good, but instead ofwaiting and anticipating, you can get on with life. Here are the criteria werecommend using when you face a mounting stress that keeps being repeated:• Finding a fixThe first and best choice is always to seek an improvement. Some repeatedstresses are external, such as trying to work in a noisy, chaotic office orcommuting in heavy morning traffic. But the vast majority of repetitive stressesare human, and of these, most occur in relationships. So what do you do toimprove a relationship that has hit a rocky place or a work situation in whichsomeone you cannot avoid is creating constant stress?Step 1: Assess the chances in favor of a successful solution. The key questionis whether the person at the other end of the problem is willing to listen,wants to change, can negotiate reasonably without getting angry and resistant,and can be trusted to keep faith with the bargain the two of you have reached.This is asking a lot, and you need to turn the tables and ask the same questionsof yourself. You are responsible for your own emotions and responses. Blamecomes from an emotional level that will always wreck any negotiation. Guilt willlead to appeasement, which ultimately leads to resentment. Also part of yourassessment should be how rigid the impasse is. If you have reached the point ofnoncommunication or worse, freezing each other out, there is no solution insight. You need to restore some level of communication first before facing anyother alternative.Step 2: Write down the pros and cons of each possible solution. Take your timerevising and adding to your lists. A fix-it that truly works needs longconsideration. Be as rational and objective as possible. A good angle is topretend that it’s not you who has the problem but a friend who has asked foryour advice. What would you tell your friend, pro and con, about the solutionsthat seem possible? As you make out your list, check to be sure that you wouldbe sharing the burden equally after adopting a change.Step 3: Present the solution that came out on top in your deliberation. Don’tbring the list to the table, and don’t offer multiple possibilities—that simplyleads to confusion. Even though you have personal issues at stake, don’t letthis first engagement turn into a gripe session. There’s always a temptation toitemize all the things that have gone wrong back from day one. Resist thistemptation. Most of the time, the other person already knows that a problemexists. Yet often the words “We need to talk” will come as a shock to the otherperson. It’s generally best to limit the first engagement to no more than 15minutes. You want to reach a specific goal—the solution you have in mind—and theother person deserves time to absorb what is happening. The instigator of changealways bears the responsibility for heading the negotiation, which means keepinga cool head and being as fair as possible about the other person’s viewpoint.Finally, if you are the one who is going to initiate the fix, wait until a calmmoment when various issues aren’t flaring up. The very worst time to bring upproblems is when you are arguing, criticizing, under the influence of alcohol,or feeling blame and guilt.Step 4: Having reached an agreement, follow through with your half of thebargain while asking the other person to do the same. Negotiations never succeedunless both sides feel they have won something, come away feeling safe andsecure, and find a way to hold on to their dignity. Win-win isn’t just an ideal;it’s the only acceptable outcome, because in win-lose, the losing party willalways act badly, given enough time. Remember, you are responsible only for yourside of the solution. It’s not your place to nag or remind the other person, tomonitor their compliance, or to attach blame if the solution isn’t working.Backsliding is part of everyone’s tendency to resist change. The best tactic isto pencil in a follow-up meeting right when the solution is agreed upon. Thisway you eliminate the tension of watching and waiting to see if the other personlives up to their side of the agreement. Finally, be honest with yourself if thesolution isn’t working. Instead of giving up, renegotiate; this time ask theother person what their best solution is. Compromises are easier to reach oncetwo people get to the stage of “We tried it my way, we tried it your way—nowwhat?”• Putting up with a bad situationMost problems get worse when they are allowed to fester, and yet we all tend toput up with bad situations out of passivity, inertia, or aversion to conflict.The bad situation is the conflict. Keeping quiet about it or going into denialonly pushes the conflict underground. Because we tend to wait too long, problemserupt into open hostility, and then negotiations become much harder. The reasonthat couples fail to reconcile their differences usually isn’t because thosedifferences are drastic but because the time for easy answers has passed. If youfeel today that you are putting up with stress in your relationship or at work,you are already past due to seek a solution.Yet there are times when your best solution is to stick it out. Having exploredthe possibility of finding a fix, but without success, you need to sit downagain with pencil and paper to make a list of the pros and cons of putting upwith the situation. Often there are outside factors—a frustrated spouse may haveto think of the children, a disgruntled employee may see no other job prospectsin sight. Nobody is completely free and unencumbered. You might want to use theheadings “Good for me,” “Good for us,” “Bad for me,” and “Bad for us” in yourdeliberations. Emotionally, most people look upon putting up with a stressfulproblem as a loss or defeat, victimization, or martyrdom. It’s hard to escapethese feelings, which have some basis in reality, since you did fail to reach asolution.You must focus on the positive side of staying and sticking it out. Spouses findways to live together in less-than-happy circumstances, and one key is knowingthat this is their decision, not a trap they’ve fallen into against their will.In your deliberations you want to reach the stage where you are content withyour decision, as much as that is possible. The columns devoted to “Good for me”and “Good for us” need to have legitimate entries, not excuses. Putting up witha bad situation is always a compromise. What you give away will feel much worse,however, if you aren’t firm in your decision. It’s like the difference betweengiving ten dollars to the homeless and having somebody steal ten dollars fromyou.Finally, ask yourself if you are using any of the following bad reasons forstaying:~ I have no other choice.~ I’m afraid to leave.~ I can’t take care of myself alone.~ I’m suffering, but that doesn’t matter.~ I have to be loyal, no matter what.~ This is all my fault.~ Just give it more time.These self-defeating responses are born of fear and guilt. When any come tomind, step back and rationally ask, “Is this really true?” Remember, your goalis to make a decision in which putting up with a bad situation is as positivefor you as it can be under the circumstances.• Walking awayThe third option is to make a decisive break. As with the decision to put upwith a bad situation, walking away generally comes too late—it is emotionallyforced on you when you have reached your limit to cope. We’re not beingjudgmental—there can be many good reasons for walking away, the best one beingthat you have decided to stand up for yourself. What is needed, as always, is adecision you feel good about, not a last resort or an act of desperation.Take out your pencil and paper and list the pros and cons of leaving. It’shelpful to add a third column headed “What will happen next?”—the consequencesof walking out on a relationship or quitting a job cannot be minimized. Rupturesalways create wounds; deep wounds always take more time to heal than youanticipate. The positive side of walking out sometimes leads to a honeymoonperiod in which you are relieved to be free of tension, discord, hostility, andgeneral stress. Just as often, however, the honeymoon leads to a backlashemotionally, accompanied by depression, guilt, and anxiety.We aren’t foreseeing doom—you just need to be armed with psychologicallyrealistic expectations. The backlash of walking out varies with each person.Unfortunately, it seems to be human nature that walking out brings up selfishmotives. Looking out for number one, generally tinged with revenge if a marriageis dissolving, becomes a driving motive. Try not to fall into the trap ofself-preservation at all costs. There are strong elements of fear and insecurityat work here. Be aware of what’s really going on inside you, because as long asanger and revenge are relied on as a driving motive, they mask the hurt thatneeds healing."},{"pageContent":"WEDNESDAYANTI-AGINGTODAY’S RECOMMENDATIONS—CHOOSE ONLY ONE.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------DOMeditate.Join a social support group.Strengthen emotional bonds with family and close friends.Take a multivitamin and mineral supplement (if you are age sixty-five or older).Maintain a balance of rest and activity.Explore a new interest.Take up a challenging mental activity.UNDODon’t be sedentary—stand up and move throughout the day.Examine your negative emotions.Heal injured relationships that are meaningful to you.Be mindful of lapses and imbalances in your diet.Address negative stereotypes about aging and ageism.Consider how to heal the fear of death.The good news about preventing or even reversing the aging process is that ithas become realistically possible. The time of wishful thinking has passed.Increasingly, the medical community knows what we’re dealing with as the bodyages, which wasn’t true before—in fact, aging was quite a mystery. There is nosingle process known as aging. Instead, aging is as multidimensional as lifeitself. To hear that aging is almost impossible to define will surprise mostpeople. They identify aging with its symptoms—loss of muscle mass, wrinkles,fading vision, and so on. But the symptoms of a cold aren’t the same as knowingthe actual cause, and the symptoms of aging are as far removed from the cause asa runny nose is from the cold virus.Current research has zeroed in on genetic changes as the key, and geneticactivity, as we’ve seen, can be strongly influenced by lifestyle.Since people are living longer, it’s realistic to say that past age fifty, youwill enter a second lifetime, and unlike children, who spend the first twodecades of life occupied with developing into fully capable human beings, afifty-year-old can bring a wealth of knowledge, skill, and experience to thesecond lifetime that now presents itself. In a word, how you age today—ordon’t—will turn old age into a rising arc or a steady decline. Despite theinfluence of genes and biology, the choice is largely yours.As things stand, the universal experience of growing older can’t be reduced to asingle cause or a single result. What society believes about aging and theelderly can be just as important as what’s going on biologically. The adage“You’re only as old as you think you are” points to a third factor, thepsychological. Taken altogether, the picture of aging has been confusing,leading to a collection of basic facts that apply differently to each person, asfollows:• Formerly, aging was thought to begin biologically starting around age thirtyand proceed at around 1 percent of physical deterioration a year for the rest ofa person’s life. Now we realize that this view was tied to symptoms of aging. Atthe cellular and epigenetic level, signs of impaired function can, and do, beginmuch earlier.• The whole bodymind system is affected by the aging process, but not at apredictable rate.• Because the aging process is so variable, some people are biologically youngerthan their chronological age, some older.• Aging leads eventually to death from a specific breakdown in one system(usually the respiratory system). At the time of death, the vast majority ofcells are still functioning normally, or at least well enough to keep the personalive.• For every typical sign of aging, there are at least a few people who improveas they grow older, including in such areas as memory, muscle strength, andmental acuteness. This raises the possibility that aging may not be necessary.If that’s true, why do we age?Faced with such a confusing picture, medical science couldn’t make aging fit thedisease model—aging isn’t the same as getting sick, even though the elderly aremore prone to illness than young adults. The holy grail in physics, sought afterfor many decades, is known as the theory of everything, a unified explanation ofall the fundamental forces in the universe. In medicine there is no comparabletheory of everything in regard to aging. When you catch a cold, you will exhibitsymptoms over the course of a week typical of almost everyone else who catches acold, but aging takes decades to unfold, and no two seventy-year-olds areexactly or even approximately alike. You are a unique person, and aginghighlights your unique qualities.Anti-aging took a leap forward in the last two decades when it became clear thatthe aging process is centered on DNA. Now we know, thanks to the field ofepigenetics, that a lifetime of experiences constantly affects gene activity,leaving marks or imprints that last a long time. No one can say with certaintyif a specific marker lasts for years, decades, or a lifetime, but the crucialfact is undeniable: Your lifestyle has genetic consequences. Even identicaltwins, born with the same genome, will exhibit gene activity in their seventiesthat is as different as two siblings who aren’t twins; sometimes the differenceswill be the same as between two total strangers.The most recent breakthrough in anti-aging is the finding that the aging processbegins young. In a 2015 Duke University study headed by Daniel W. Belsky, thefocus was on biological age (how old your body is) as opposed to chronologicalage (how old you are by the calendar). Traditionally, the aging process has beenstudied primarily in old people, who already show symptoms of lifestyledisorders. Instead, the Duke team looked at 954 young people, tracking thebiomarkers for aging at three different time points between ages twenty andforty: “Already, before midlife, individuals who were aging more rapidly wereless physically able, showed cognitive decline and brain aging, self-reportedworse health, and looked older.” This finding helps boost the idea of anti-agingby pushing the whole issue back decades before the signs of disease andinfirmity are advanced. As we’ve been demonstrating throughout this book, a longtrail leads to the start of many disorders, and now aging, which affects everysystem in the body, joins the list.Finding the most reliable biomarkers for aging is still controversial—thepossibilities range from deep neural networks to T-cells and epigenetic markers.Only when this issue is settled can anti-aging be measured with confidentaccuracy. Right now there is no gold standard for measuring aging. This isn’t asurprise, given that the process is incredibly complex and affects each persondifferently. Yet by any standard, the burden of anti-aging rests with eachindividual, not with the promise of a silver bullet in the future.As you make your choices today, keep one thing in mind. Just as you are uniquein the way you age, anti-aging will also be unique. The more you understand theaging process, the better you can individualize your anti-aging program. Hereare the most important variables that affect aging in general, according to thebest recent research.SUCCESSFUL AGING: TOP TEN VARIABLES1. Satisfying relationships with family, friends, and community2. Emotional resilience, the ability to bounce back from setbacks and losses3. Stress management4. Anti-inflammation, including diet and “inflamed” emotions like anger andhostility5. Good sleep every night6. Meditation, yoga, mindful breathing7. Moderate physical activity throughout the day. Standing up and moving tobreak up long periods of sitting8. Positive attitudes toward aging and the passing of time9. Absence of toxins, including tobacco and alcohol10. Youthful mindset—curious, open, always learning new thingsListed roughly in the order of priority, these variables provide insight intohow people age well. We should note, however, a cutting-edge theory of agingthat holds inflammation responsible for every aspect of the aging process.Although unproven, this theory may be the wave of the future, considering thatso many lifestyle disorders basically occur in old age and at the same time arelinked to low-grade chronic inflammation.As with every aspect of a healing lifestyle, waiting until you show visiblesymptoms of aging comes too late. Aging is the ultimate example of a creeping,incremental change surrounded by a litany of influences. Anti-aging is alsoincremental but clear in its strategy: maximize the positive input your bodymindreceives every day and minimize the negative input. Input is an all-embracingterm, but the best research points to the areas everyone should focus on, whichis what our “Do” and “Undo” recommendations are about.THE “DO” SIDEWe present only one age-specific choice on the “Do” list—taking a multivitaminand mineral supplement if you are over sixty-five (see this page[Chop_9780451495532_epub3_c012_r1.xhtml#page_184] for why this choice isimportant). The other choices pertain to your welfare and happiness right now,based on the notion that a happy life is built upon being happy every day. Thelongest-running study on aging is the Harvard Study of Adult Development, noweighty years old, which arrived at findings summarized in a headline at thewebsite Harvard Gazette: “Good genes are nice, but joy is better.” The studybegan in 1938 with the intention of following 268 Harvard sophomores throughouttheir lives. (The subject population was later expanded and diversified. Only 19of the original subjects were still alive in 2017, but their 1,300 offspring arebeing studied, along with their wives and additional inner-city volunteers.)Robert Waldinger, a psychiatrist and professor at Harvard Medical School who nowheads the study, reports: “The surprising finding is that our relationships andhow happy we are in our relationships has a powerful influence on our health.Taking care of your body is important, but tending to your relationships is aform of self-care too. That, I think, is the revelation.” This finding fits intoprevious points we’ve been making about heart disease, for example, whereanswers on social support or a spouse who expresses love turn out to be goodpredictors of who will exhibit symptoms of heart problems and who won’t. At theopposite extreme, to quote Dr. Waldinger: “Loneliness kills. It’s as powerful assmoking or alcoholism.”These findings aren’t tentative or confined only to an upper social group. Asthe article on the Harvard study goes on to say: “Close relationships, more thanmoney or fame, are what keep people happy throughout their lives, the studyrevealed. Those ties protect people from life’s discontents, help to delaymental and physical decline, and are better predictors of long and happy livesthan social class, IQ, or even genes. That finding proved true across the boardamong both the Harvard men and the inner-city participants.”Our “Do” choices focus on this key finding. The more social support you have andthe happiness you find in relationships will continue to affect you throughoutyour lifetime. In the “old” old age, as outdated attitudes are labeled, thegolden years were a euphemism for being stuck in a rocking chair and being of nouse to society once you passed sixty-five. In addition, people looked forward tobeing happy after they retired, setting this as their main goal rather thanbeing happy here and now. The ethos dictated that you worked as hard as possibleduring your prime years and postponed happiness until you retired; it was one ofthe perks, so to speak, of not having to work. In the “new” old age, a set ofattitudes still evolving, chiefly among baby boomers, there is no intention ofretiring as long as one’s work is useful and fulfilling. In aid of this, peopleintend to preserve their healthy status for as long as possible, preferablyuntil the final illness.Where the “new” old age needs to grow is in the area of social support andrelationships, because happiness for too many people is still an individualproject. The ethos of American individualism stands at the opposite pole from acommunal society like Japan or countries with policies of social welfare, likealmost every European nation. In our list of “Do” choices we present meditationas something where going it alone seems mandatory, but even there, people whojoin meditation groups are more likely to keep up their practice.The most valid measure of quality of life is how happy you are, how fulfilledand contented your lifestyle has made you. People who spend their careersbecoming secure financially often lack any but rudimentary skills in sustaininga happy relationship. We can’t address this problem in full—that would take tentimes more space than we can devote to it—but Deepak’s book The UltimateHappiness Prescription makes the following points:• Happiness is hard to predict. People think that they will be happier when theyhave more money, a baby, a job promotion, and other external factors, but thereis no correlation between these expectations and actually being happier. Whilehaving enough money and security is an important component of being happy,beyond that point making more money doesn’t increase happiness and often has theopposite effect of adding more stress to a person’s life.• Because it is so unpredictable, happiness should be addressed today ratherthan postponed for the future.• Each of us has an emotional set point, like the body’s metabolic set point,that chiefly determines our mood from day to day. After an unhappy event,whether it’s a bad breakup or a financial loss, we return to our set point,generally within six months.• Even taking this set point into consideration, the current psychologicalunderstanding is that at least 40 to 50 percent of happiness depends onlifestyle choices.• In the world’s wisdom traditions, the fickle nature of human happiness cannotbe solved by seeking happiness externally. Only by finding a level of the mindthat is established in inner peace and contentment can the problem ofunhappiness be solved—this is in keeping with our chapter on the end ofsuffering.THE “UNDO” SIDEThe choices offered on the “Undo” list revolve around a central theme: gettingunstuck. You have to be as resilient in your approach to life as your cells are.If you are rigid in habits, behavior, and attitudes, you will incrementallydecrease the ability of your cells to thrive and remain strong in the face ofchallenges. Remember, the bodymind is a single process operating with hundredsof subprocesses twenty-four hours a day. No experience goes unheeded. Clenchingyour mind is the same as clenching your fist—at a certain point you will developa cramp.Begin today to look at the negative attitudes that tend to increase with age ifyou aren’t mindful of them. These include the following:“Growing old is horrible. It’s all downhill from here.”“The prospect of death is terrifying.”“The best years are behind me.”“The past was a lot better than today.”“You can only look out for number one.”“People always let you down.”“Time is running out.”These attitudes and beliefs are not testable against reality one way oranother—they are held not for factual reasons, but for emotional ones. The wholepoint is how you choose to feel about your life and the future. If you hate andfear the thought of growing old, aging will become more and more negative astime passes. Every new sign of growing older, from graying hairs to pains inyour joints, will be another reason to hate and fear where life is taking you.Limiting belief systems are the major obstacles to healthy aging. It isimportant in mind, body, and spirit to always be looking forward to something,today and tomorrow, while not obsessing about the past.Since every belief is a personal creation, it can also be uncreated. We devoteThursday to core beliefs and how to change them, but for now, the undoingprocess involves a few mindful steps:• Associate with inspiring, happy older people, beginning today.• At the same time cultivate connections with young people.• Don’t participate in conversations in which people complain about aging.• Every negative belief about aging can be countered by consciously replacing itwith a positive belief, as follows:~ “Growing old is horrible. It’s all downhill from here.”~ Replace with “My life is a rising arc. The best is yet to come.”~ “The prospect of death is terrifying.”~ Replace with “Fear never solves anything, including this.”~ “The best years are behind me.”~ Replace with “I can create a better future if I choose to.”~ “The past was a lot better than today.”~ Replace with “Dwelling on the past cancels out the possibilities of today andtomorrow.”~ “You can only look out for number one.”~ Replace with “All my life I have looked out for others, and they have lookedout for me.”~ “People always let you down.”~ Replace with “People fundamentally are doing their best.”~ “Time is running out.”~ Replace with “There’s always enough time.”Since beliefs are held for emotional reasons, we aren’t saying that positivebeliefs are always factually true, only that your emotional state is where themost powerful motivations lie. That’s a very significant part of agingsuccessfully. Having a positive attitude toward it makes an enormous differencegiven that decades of living are involved. Positive thinking, however, tends tobe superficial and therefore not as important as self-acceptance. When you havethat, even the worst indignities of old age—which of course we want you toavoid—don’t turn into a downward spiral. A strong sense of self weathers anystorm.THE TELOMERE CONNECTIONNow that it’s accepted that people age differently, it’s critical to know why.Aging is such a holistic process that you might suppose that no simple answerabout why we age differently will ever emerge. But that may not be true at thecellular level. Cells have their own lifespan, ranging from the early stages,marked by rapid division and fresh renewal every time a cell divides—this is theperiod molecular biologist Elizabeth Blackburn calls luxuriant growth—endingwith a stage in which no more divisions occur and the cell is tired andunreliable in performing its basic functions—this is the period known assenescence.A senescent cell breaks down on several fronts. It sends out faulty chemicalmessages and fails to interpret incoming messages correctly. Its ability to healitself slows down and eventually comes to a halt. Pro-inflammatory substancescan start to leak out through the cell membrane into surrounding tissue and thebloodstream. It seems more and more possible that when our cells age, so do we.The most striking support for this theory comes from research into our genes andspecifically a section of DNA known as a telomere, which caps the end of eachchromosome like a period ending a sentence. Telomeres are “noncoding” DNA,meaning that they have no specified function in building cells, but they are farfrom passive. Their function seems to be to preserve cells. Every time a celldivides, which happens constantly somewhere in the body, its telomeres areshortened. Longer telomeres are typical of young cells in the stage of luxuriantgrowth; shortened or frayed telomeres are typical of weary senescent cells.The leading researcher on the subject is someone we’ve already brieflymentioned—molecular biologist Elizabeth Blackburn, who shared the 2008 NobelPrize in Physiology or Medicine with Carol Greider of Johns Hopkins and JackSzostak of Massachusetts General Hospital for their discovery of telomerase, theenzyme that replenishes telomeres. Now the head of the Salk Institute in LaJolla, California, Blackburn covers every aspect of cell aging and renewal inher 2017 book, The Telomere Effect, coauthored with her close research colleagueof fifteen years, health psychologist Elissa Epel. They convincingly describetelomeres and levels of telomerase in the cell as our best marker yet for themysterious and multifold process of aging. This also implies that by increasingone’s telomerase levels and thereby causing telomeres to grow longer, a healthylifespan can be founded on cells that keep renewing themselves for decades.In their book, Blackburn and Epel cite a startling actuarial prediction. Thereare currently around 300,000 centenarians existing around the world, a numberthat is rapidly increasing. According to one estimate, reaching age one hundredis about to become so commonplace that one-third of children born in the UnitedKingdom will live to be centenarians—the issue of protecting your cells issuddenly more urgent than ever. We highly recommend reading Blackburn and Epel’sbook—its wealth of information needs to be absorbed in detail. But the bottomline is to understand what puts your telomeres at high risk and low risk.The book’s survey of all the pertinent research dovetails with everything we’vebeen discussing under a healing lifestyle, as follows:Your telomeres are at low risk if you~ Have no exposure to severe stress.~ Have never been diagnosed with a mood disorder.~ Enjoy good social support, including a close confidant who gives good advice,friends who listen to you and with whom you can unburden yourself, andrelationships in which love and affection are shown.~ Exercise moderately or vigorously at least three times a week, preferablymore.~ Get good-quality sleep for at least seven hours a night.~ Consume omega-3-rich food three times a week while avoiding processed meats,sugary sodas, and processed food in general. A whole-food diet is best.~ Are not exposed to cigarette smoke, pesticides, and insecticides.The opposite is also true.Your telomeres are at high risk if you~ Are being exposed to severe stress in your life.~ Have a history of being medically treated for anxiety or depression.~ Lack social support from friends and family.~ Lead a completely sedentary lifestyle with no regular exercise, even lightactivity like walking.~ Suffer from chronic insomnia or cut your sleep shorter than seven hours anight.~ Consume a diet high in fat, processed foods, and sugary sodas, with noattention to sufficient fiber and omega-3 fatty acids.~ You are exposed to cigarette smoke, pesticides, insecticides, and otherchemical toxins.These points summarize the research-supported risk factors presented byBlackburn, and as with any risk-based program, some people are more affectedthan others. Severe stress is one of the most thoroughly damaging factors—in onestudy, caregivers who tended Alzheimer’s patients had shortened telomeres thatpredicted a shortened lifespan of between five and eight years. Blackburn alsolists a number of commercial labs where people can pay to have their telomeraselevel analyzed.It’s also significant that the lifestyle choices known to decrease the risk ofheart disease, particularly the intensive one devised by Dean Ornish (see thispage [Chop_9780451495532_epub3_c004_r1.xhtml#c04_01]), have a beneficial effecton telomere length. Extending the program to cancer, Ornish had anotherimpressive finding. A group of men with low-risk prostate cancer were selectedfor study. (Low risk means that their cancer was at an early stage and slowgrowing. Prostate cancer can take decades to advance, and the currentrecommendation advises balancing the risk and reward of doing any activetreatments, a change from the era when any cancer was immediately treated andusually aggressively.)The men were put on a variant of the heart-disease protocol: they ate a low-fat,high-fiber diet; walked for thirty minutes a day; and attended regular supportgroup meetings. Stress management was included, and there was training inmeditation, mild yoga stretching, and breathing. At the end of three months thegroup that was on the program had higher telomerase levels than the controlgroup, which meant that their cells were aging better. Stress seemed to play akey role, because the greatest increase in telomerase occurred among the men whoreported having fewer distressing thoughts about prostate cancer. Ornishfollowed some of the men for five years, and those who stuck with the programshowed telomeres that had increased by 10 percent, reversing the usualexpectation as cells age.If stress levels determine how well or badly our cells age, this should show upin meditation studies, and it has. Blackburn cites two studies conducted atmeditation retreats that were three weeks and three months long. At the end ofthe three-month retreat, meditators had higher telomerase levels compared withthe control group. In the three-week retreat meditators showed longer telomeresin their white blood cells than the control group, which showed no change.How long would it take for these effects to appear, and how intensive does yourdedication to meditation have to be? There is no definitive answer, but probablythe best clues come from a collaborative study that we carried out withBlackburn and other leading researchers, conducted at the Chopra Center inCarlsbad, California. Women in good health were divided into two groups. Onegroup enjoyed a spa vacation without other interventions. The other group wentthrough a program led by Deepak that included meditation and a variety ofAyurvedic treatments. At the end of the week everyone reported feeling better,which attests to the likelihood that most people are in sympathetic overdrive,because simply going on a week’s vacation improved their sense of well-being.In the same vein, there were improvements in gene expression (activity) in bothgroups, including the chemical pathways that trigger inflammation and the stressresponse. There also appeared to be a meditation effect on telomeres andtelomere-protective genes. These occurred in the meditation group amongexperienced meditators. The fact that it took only a week to produce resultsthat started to be significant points to the conclusion that you are doing yourcells some good almost as soon as you take up meditation and that the practiceneeds to be regular and long lasting.We are encouraged by how strongly telomere research validates the healinglifestyle this book advocates. It also underlines the conviction that cellsbenefit directly, at the genetic level, from conscious lifestyle choices.Blackburn ends her book with a visionary Telomere Manifesto that wouldprioritize protecting our cells as a part of parenting, social relations, thefight against income inequality, and global outreach for the planet. Like allvisions, this one depends upon individual decisions, and one comes away from TheTelomere Effect even more persuaded that anti-aging begins by keeping our cellsin a state of renewal. If there are no new startling things to do, becoming moreoptimistic about your own aging is valuable in itself."},{"pageContent":"THURSDAYSTAND, WALK, REST, SLEEPTODAY’S RECOMMENDATIONS—CHOOSE ONLY ONE.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------DOStand up and move around once an hour if you are working at the computer or at adesk job.Walk 5 minutes for every hour you work.Take the stairs instead of the elevator.Park your car far away in the lot when you shop or go to work.Be regular in your sleep routine.Make your bedroom an optimal sleeping environment (see this page[Chop_9780451495532_epub3_c015_r1.xhtml#page_228]).Walk for 20 to 30 minutes in the evening.Take 10 minutes of quiet alone time, preferably in meditation, twice today.Spend more time with a physically active friend or family member.UNDOReplace 10 minutes of sofa time in front of the TV with a walk instead.Break the habit of waiting until the weekend to catch up on lost sleep.If you drink alcohol, do it early in the evening—go to bed without alcohol inyour bloodstream.Replace the midmorning coffee-and-doughnut break with a walk.Walk to one place close by that you usually drive to.Examine your excuses for not being more active.Not getting enough sleep bothers many people, but it can’t be addressed alone.Today’s theme is expanded to include the complete cycle of rest and activitythat benefits the bodymind. As a society, we’ve created a situation with sleepthat works against the biorhythms governing the whole system. If you sit all dayand get no significant exercise, you can wind up “too tired to go to sleep,”because the rhythm of sleep and activity has been disturbed. Research has shownhow interlocked our needs for rest and activity actually are. To keep yourbiorhythms synchronized, four elements must be present:Standing: Simple as it sounds, the human physiology depends on gravity. Seminalresearch in the 1930s showed that college athletes, when confined to bed for twoweeks, lost months’ worth of muscle tone in their training. Standing up for onlya few minutes a day keeps muscle tone intact. It also appears to aid in recoveryfrom surgery, which is why patients are no longer advised to get constant bedrest in the hospital but encouraged instead to stand up and walk if they areable.Walking: Although exercise delivers more benefits the harder and more frequentlyyou exercise, the baseline for activity is walking. Research has shown that thewidest gap in levels of physical activity, medically speaking, occurs betweenthose who take zero exercise and those who get up off the sofa and do something,no matter how meager. Walking is now a regular practice in recovery from seriousillnesses and surgery.Rest: After heavy physical exertion, rest is necessary to replenish your musclesand restore internal balance—most people have no difficulty with this becausethey feel exhausted after heavy work or exercise. But the need for mental resthas only recently been taken seriously. If you equate mental rest with lethargyand dullness, that image is misleading. People who practice meditation, whichamong other things rests the mind, emerge with sharper alertness. Meditationdoesn’t dull the mind or put the brain to sleep—there is actually increasedbrain activity (in alpha waves, for example, which are associated withcreativity), resulting in a state previously unknown to neuroscience: restfulalertness.Sleep: Researchers still don’t know why we need to sleep at all, except thatundeniably we do. The most recent theory is that sleep allows the brain to riditself of built-up toxins during the day. These include, during the deepeststage of sleep, the removal of senile plaques that can cause Alzheimer’sdisease. It is also during deep sleep that we consolidate what we have learnedall day as short-term memories into long-term memories. Without theseactivities, our brain (as well as the rest of our body) can undergo damage doneby lack of sleep and poor sleep.Let’s do a deeper dive. The first thing everyone notices when they spend asleepless night is feeling tired and groggy in the morning, sometimes throughoutthe day. This becomes a chronic complaint from insomniacs, yet even when someonesays, “I didn’t sleep a wink last night,” dream studies reveal that intermittentepisodes of sleep do in fact occur, even though they may be fitful and shallow.If someone is forced to stay awake the entire night, for example, in a sleepclinic laboratory, more serious deficits begin to show up, such as lack of motorcoordination and attention—these are serious causes of motor vehicle accidents.Chemical imbalances start to show up, particularly in the flow of hormones,which are precisely balanced according to our circadian (daily) clock. Notgetting enough sleep can disturb your appetite because the balance of leptin andghrelin, the two hormones that govern hunger and satiation, has been thrown off.Except in a sleep lab, few people go beyond losing one night’s sleep; thebrain’s demand for sleep is too hard to overcome. But extended lack of sleepleads to headaches, muscle weakness, tremors, hallucinations, and other serioussymptoms. Because these drastic effects aren’t experienced doesn’t mean,however, that you aren’t suffering from sleep deprivation. As with low-gradechronic stress and inflammation, the habit of losing sleep creates problemsincrementally over the long run. Insomniacs run a higher risk of anxiety anddepression, for example. Knowing this, psychiatrists will caution their patientswho suffer from chronic depression to be on the lookout for poor sleep. This hasbeen shown to be one of the earliest signs that a bout of depression is about tobegin; it also marks an early enough stage that the onset of depression cansometimes be averted simply by correcting the irregular sleep pattern. Use ofdrugs like cocaine will often lead to poor sleep, which then leads to depressionand anxiety, stoking a desire for more drugs in a vicious circle.In a 2003 review article in the journal Behavioral Sleep Medicine, the authorsreported wide-ranging psychological effects: “Insomnia was consistentlypredictive of depression, anxiety disorders, other psychological disorders,alcohol abuse or dependence, drug abuse or dependence, and suicide, indicatinginsomnia is a risk factor for these difficulties.” This finding has its milderimplications, as anyone who has lain awake worrying knows all too well. Thereview article goes on to note that insomnia is associated with decreased immuneresponse, while the data were inconclusive over whether insomnia is a risk forcardiovascular disorders. Sleep studies tend to be small, and the definition ofinsomnia is fairly ambiguous, but it sounds disturbing that the regular use ofsleeping pills is a risk for mortality (i.e., a shortened lifespan). A 2012study at Scripps Health in San Diego linked popular prescription sleeping pillsto a five-fold increased risk of early death. This study indicated increasedrisk of death for both casual and heavy users.One of the usual suspects, inflammation, also seems to enter the picture. In a2010 study, subjects were kept awake for twenty-four hours or more and showedincreased markers for inflammation (cytokines). The results weren’t significantenough to be called clinical—needing medical treatment—but it’s notable thatincreased inflammatory markers also showed up in subjects who were awakenedafter only two to four hours of sleep. No reliable cause could be found for theincreased inflammatory markers, but speculation pointed to “autonomic activationand metabolic changes,” which we simplified as sympathetic overdrive (seechapter 5). In other words, the sympathetic nervous system was put under stress.The stress and strain of modern life keeps the sympathetic nervous systemchronically stimulated. When you toss and turn, unable to get to sleep, you mayblame the thoughts running through your head, or physical tenseness andtightness, or a nameless refusal of the sleep response to click in. But thesediverse symptoms are generally traceable to being in autonomic overdrive. Thestress response has been subtly activated, and one effect is to be alert—that’spart of responding to external threats. In acute stress the pupils dilate, heartrate rapidly increases, and the surge of adrenaline demands action, eitherfleeing or fighting. Low-grade stimulation of the stress response isn’t sodramatic, but at any level, the stress response negates falling asleep. Stressand sleeplessness form a vicious circle, and if you are also stressed out aboutyour insomnia, the effect is only aggravated. Our recommendations about stressreduction will go a long way to breaking the stress-insomnia connection.THE “DO” SIDEBabies and young children fall asleep effortlessly. Being tired from aphysically active day also makes sleep automatic. But most of us expend fewerand fewer calories per day in physical activity. Studies have shown that sittingat the computer uses about 80 calories an hour. You can use 8 to 10 morecalories by walking for five minutes four times an hour, and over the long run,this is enough to control the slow, gradual weight gain that plagues people asthey age. (Over an eight-hour workday, adding just 10 calories an hour, ifregularly kept up, would offset 20,000 calories a year, or around 6 pounds ofweight gain.) Standing desks are gaining in popularity, and they have somehealth advocates. However, standing adds only 2 calories an hour over the energyexpended sitting down.The trend toward using fewer calories is likely to increase in the future, whicheliminates the easiest way to assure sound sleep. Therefore our recommendationsfocus on some basic lifestyle changes you can adopt for life. You may wonder whywe haven’t included the standard governmental recommendation ofmoderate-to-heavy exercise lasting at least thirty minutes three to five times aweek. The answer is compliance. Studies have shown that Americans are exercisinga little more than in the past, but the age group that takes exercise is young,nineteen to twenty-nine years old, with steady declines every decade thereafter.The least active group are seniors, and that needs to reverse. Longevity andgood health in old age increase with activity and decrease among people who giveup and sit all day. Everyone over age seventy in good health would benefit frommild cardiovascular workouts and mild weight training, even into their nineties.For the sake of compliance, the secret is to habituate yourself early. Beingregular in simple things like standing and walking makes you much more likely tokeep up the habit as you age. For mental alertness, meditation is recommendedbecause you get to experience the state of restful alertness. As we pointed outabove, this is a state of awareness that is neither asleep nor dull. In restfulalertness the mind is fully awake but not stimulated. Everyone at every agegroup will benefit from making this state a familiar habit.Your sleep environment: Here’s a checklist for turning your bedroom into anideal place for sleeping.12 STEPS TO GETTING THE BEST SLEEP1. Make the room as dark as possible, using blackout shades or wearing asleeping mask.2. Make the room as quiet as possible.3. If you share a bed with someone who snores, wear earplugs.4. Avoid using your bed for work.5. Don’t text in bed.6. Keep your room on the cooler side.7. Stop watching TV at least an hour before bedtime.8. Keep the TV in another room.9. Make the room as soothing to the senses as possible with colors andscents—this should be the room in your house you associate with relaxation.10. Buy a comfortable mattress with sufficient back support—the firmer thebetter for most people.11. Use a hypoallergenic pillow.12. Wash bedclothes frequently enough to eliminate dust.The first imperative is a completely dark, preferably pitch-black bedroom.There’s a physiological reason for this. The pineal gland, which is buried deepin the brain, is crucial to regular sound sleep because it is sensitive tolight. As you sleep, brain activity fluctuates, and at the end of seven to eighthours, you rise toward wakefulness in waves. You aren’t aware of being awakeuntil the last wave lifts you out of sleep, yet if your bedroom is lit withmorning sunlight, you will tend to wake up too early, on a shallow wave. Thisinterruption can be fairly easy to overcome—you bury your head in the pillow andgo back to sleep. But because you didn’t get seven to eight hours of continuoussleep, you will usually feel groggy once you are fully awake. (If you’re afrequent traveler, you might notice how well you sleep in hotel rooms. That’sbecause they have blackout curtains that make the room considerably darker thanthe average bedroom.)Blocking out extraneous noise is important for two reasons: it can keep you fromfalling asleep and also wake you up too early (on one of those shallow waves).Another recommendation aside from improving your sleep environment is to takeyour daily low-dose aspirin—recommended for all adults as a preventive for heartattacks and even some forms of cancer—at night. As we mentioned earlier, minoraches and pains that go unnoticed during the day can become irritants when youget into bed. Taking an aspirin helps to eliminate this often-overlookedcontributor to insomnia.THE “UNDO” SIDEIf noncompliance is the obstacle on our “Do” list, inertia is the enemy on the“Undo” side. Habits are self-reinforcing. If you skip a day of exercise, forexample, it’s easy to let the next day slide. Yet for every skipped day, youlose the benefit of a day of exercise, so inertia leads steadily downhill. (As aside note, this pattern pertains to who has a good sex life as they age. Thepeople who are most likely to have satisfying sex are the ones who didn’t stop.Having sex reinforces itself; not having sex reinforces itself.)We believe that avoiding inertia rarely works if someone adopts a strenuoushabit like running every day—for every hundred people who adopt this routine,few will maintain it for life. The day comes when you quit running, and thenthere’s a steep decline before you reach the place occupied by people who don’trun and never have. Yet the example of brushing your teeth every morningreflects how easy it is to adopt very simple, undemanding habits.Over a lifetime, if you follow the pattern of stand, walk, rest, and sleep everyday, you will do a great deal to stay in optimal health. Our “Undo”recommendations gently nudge you to avoid the slow trend toward inertia.One reason that people give for not exercising when they took it up to loseweight is that exercise didn’t work. Not only did they not lose weight, butbecause exercise is physical work, so far as your metabolism is concerned, theygained weight by being hungry. (In regular strenuous exercise, like training fora marathon, there can be weight gain because the training regimen replaces fatwith muscle, and muscle weighs more than fat. Of course, a marathon runner’sheavier body is likely to look more attractive than the body of a couch potatoof the same weight.)For a long time the complaints about not losing weight were ignored, untilgenetics revealed that some people are biologically disposed to increase theirmetabolism during exercise, which burns calories, while other people are not sodisposed. As a system approach would predict, genes don’t tell the whole story.What you eat and how you eat also affect metabolism, as do your stress level andthe hormones controlling hunger and satiation. The cloud of causes is prevalentonce again.Leaving weight aside, even though it’s one of the biggest reasons that motivatepeople to exercise, along with looking more attractive, being physically activealso has varying effects. At one extreme are those who get the famous runner’shigh; at the other extreme are people who just get very tired when they run.Strenuous exercise is associated for some with being good at sports, a positivereinforcement. There’s no positive reinforcement, however, if you hated gymclass and never made the team in a sport.The upshot is that how you feel about being active should dictate your choices.There is no one-size-fits-all exercise program, despite the benefits promised bythe governmental guidelines about regular exercise. Our concern is to cross thegap that separates a totally sedentary life from an active one. Our solution isthe stand, walk, rest, sleep formula. If you can go beyond this stage, morepower to you. But be aware of one important thing. Stand, walk, rest, sleepisn’t a bare minimum that marks you as a slacker. Instead, it’s a healthy normthat you can maintain for life even when the winning high school quarterback hasdeveloped a pot belly along with his beer-drinking buddies."},{"pageContent":"FRIDAYCORE BELIEFSTODAY’S RECOMMENDATIONS—CHOOSE ONLY ONE.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------DOWrite down five core beliefs and evaluate why you believe them.Put a core belief into action.Read a poem, scripture, or spiritual passage for inspiration.Have a family discussion about which core beliefs everyone holds.Take your favorite role model and list what core beliefs they held.UNDOExamine your negative beliefs as they relate to fear and mistrust.Open a line of communication with someone who holds radically different values.If you are stuck on a negative belief, be a devil’s advocate and argue againstit.End your participation in us-versus-them thinking.Today is about your deepest beliefs, the ones you identify with over a longstretch of time. They can have healing value or the opposite, because beliefsget turned into thoughts, words, and actions that the bodymind reacts to.Everyone holds on to personal beliefs, and in one way or another we areemotionally attached to them. But not all beliefs are created equal. Some arejust opinions, picked up and dropped without much effort. Other beliefs aresecondhand attitudes we absorbed along the way, usually beginning in childhoodwith our parents’ belief system (as in the choice of religion). Studies findthat 70 percent of first-time voters vote for the same party as their parents,and from then on, they tend to stick with their choice.These sorts of beliefs are at best incidental to a healing lifestyle, but at adeeper level your health and well-being are strongly influenced by what we’recalling core beliefs. Core beliefs lock in your perspective on some crucialquestions:Is life fair?Is there a higher power in the universe?Does good triumph over evil?Should I expect the best or prepare for the worst?Should my attitude be relaxed or vigilant?Am I safe?Am I loved, cared for, and supported by others, or can I count only on myself?Am I good enough and smart enough?How your life turns out depends on your answers to these questions. In moderntimes the responsibility for answering them rests on the individual. Whether ornot you are consciously on a spiritual path, you have been seeking and findinganswers to higher questions all your life. In an age of faith, by contrast,fixed and authoritative answers were provided by religion. Here we are concernednot with the philosophical side of core beliefs, but with how they affect thebodymind. If you feel unsafe in the world, for example, your life will bepsychologically very different from that of someone who feels safe, anddepending on how much threat you perceive, you may experience much more stress.We’ve already discussed the possibility that an infant’s worldview may begenetically determined at the epigenetic level (this page[Chop_9780451495532_epub3_c011_r1.xhtml#page_163]), which would be disturbing ifthe infant’s programmed view of life was painful and discouraging. However, it’salmost certain that a familiar term, a cloud of causes, is at work. We form ourcore beliefs in a fog of influences, and for countless people the fog neverclears. Take the first question on our list, “Is life fair?” and compare how twopeople might hypothetically arrive at opposite answers.Person A has heard over and over that life is unfair, and he accepts the truthof this. Looking around, he sees good people being hurt while bad people riseand are never punished. Thinking back on his own experiences, lots of timesthere were unfair outcomes—the girl he loved and lost, the promotion he waspassed over for, the deal that collapsed because someone backed out at the lastminute. The news is full of unsolved crimes and biased jury decisions that allowthe guilty to go free. Who could possibly claim, just looking at the grossinequalities in the world, that life is remotely fair?Person B hasn’t led a charmed life, but she’s had no major setbacks, and fromthat perspective life has been more than fair—it’s been abundant and generous.Loved as a child, she married someone she loved and made the right choices.Their children are healthy and happy. B knows that there is ugliness andunfairness in the world, but her Catholic faith tells her that God alone isjudge and God acts in mysterious ways. It’s up to us to accept that God createda benevolent universe and that mankind can be redeemed from sin. Thisoverarching view outweighs the weakness and badness that human beings fall into.A and B hold opposite beliefs for all kinds of reasons, and there is nomathematical equation for how to weigh each influence, because the cloud ofcauses changes over time. We can’t concern ourselves with whether A or B isactually right, because core beliefs never match reality with a capital R;beliefs, as we mentioned earlier, are all about your personal reality. Yet thereare core beliefs that support health and well-being and those that don’t. Hereare the relevant factors.A BELIEF IS HEALING IF…It’s flexible, tolerant, and open to change.It promotes happiness.It is loving and kind.You gain in self-esteem from it.It doesn’t create stress for you or other people.You don’t use your belief to fuel anger, fear, and mental agitation.It helps you bond with family, friends, and community.It encourages an optimistic outlook.As you can see, we are using a broad definition of healing, which is justifiedby a whole-system approach. For many people there’s a vague sense that beingpositive is better than being negative, but we aren’t promoting positivethinking—we’re promoting a healing attitude toward the self. A core belief thatleads to inflammation or a stress response is like bad input into the body’sinformation superhighway. The difference between inflammation caused by cuttingyour hand and inflammation caused by getting enraged at a political story on theevening news is minimal from the viewpoint of a cell that must contend withpro-inflammatory markers in the bloodstream.In an earlier chapter we recounted the amazing recovery by Norman Cousins from apotentially fatal illness. After he became a crusader for the mind-bodyconnection, Cousins had a story he liked to tell that shows the power of beliefin the bodymind. He spotted the story in the Los Angeles Times in 1983, about anoutbreak at a local high school football game. Four people became ill withsymptoms of food poisoning during the game and were attended by a doctor on thescene. It turned out that all four had drunk Coca-Cola from a fountaindispenser, the kind that mixed the Coca-Cola syrup with soda water.The doctor didn’t know if the contamination came from the water or the syrup,and since copper pipes were involved, there was also the possibility of coppersulfate poisoning. An announcement was made warning the crowd not to drink theCoke, and within minutes 191 people fell sick enough to be hospitalized. Severalhundred more started retching or fainted; many rushed home to contact theirfamily physician. As Cousins commented, “[I]f we just hover over this a bit,what we come up with is the fact that sounds in the air can be translated intospecific physical illness. Those symptoms were not feigned. [They] were real, asanyone who watched those people retching could testify.”The same invisible trigger can come from inside us, creating a pathway frombelief to inflammation and stress or actual disease symptoms. No one willinglydesires food poisoning, so why do we tolerate self-created damage to thebodymind? One factor is what psychologists call secondary benefit. This is apsychological mechanism for offsetting pain, like the lollipop offered to achild after getting a vaccination. Another example is severance pay, which ismeant to soften the blow of being fired. At first sight, secondary benefit lookslike a useful mechanism for coping with pain and misfortune, but when misused,it turns into self-defeating tactics like denial.When a negative state lasts long enough, we become desperate to find a way tocope. Chronic anxiety is a perfect example. It has recently come to light thatanxiety is a serious problem among the young, down to ages that no one everpreviously associated with anxiety. But in reality, anxiety can become chronicas early as age four, and it is now known that every serious mental disorder inadulthood is associated with anxiety in childhood.Disturbing as this is, the reason childhood anxiety remained hidden for so long,even from professional therapists, is that children are good at finding ways todisguise it, even from themselves. They shove the feelings down; compensate withplay and distractions like watching TV to divert attention from their fear withother negative behaviors like bed-wetting; or simply learn that Mommy and Daddydon’t want to hear about these feelings. Anxiety is intolerable as a day-to-dayexperience, so the mind must find an escape, however ineffectual.Much of this is unconscious behavior we turn into mindless habits. Consider aself-defeating habit like hating the opposite political party or turning yourannoying neighbor into an enemy. Why would you cling to such a negativeattitude, even knowing that it isn’t healthy? The reason boils down tomindlessly reinforcing your reaction over and over again instead of weighingwhat it’s doing to you. By clinging to the belief that fuels your negativity,you aggravate the reaction. Let’s use rage as the reaction. The reason peopleget stuck in angry, hostile, raging behavior has a direct link to core beliefs.BELIEFS THAT KEEP YOU MAD AS HELLI have a right to act any way I damn well please.“They” are bad people who deserve my anger.Getting mad is a healthy way of blowing off steam.I can’t help myself—my emotions run away with me.Righteous anger is moral, which makes it all right.Human nature is horrible to begin with.The person who made me angry is responsible, not me.I’m not hurting anybody when I get angry.Anger is an effective way to get what I want and show who’s boss.Each of these beliefs is self-justifying. Each reinforces itself, and the longeryou remain stuck on it, the more ingrained such a belief becomes. Deeplyingrained beliefs feel “like me—this is just who I am.” But in reality you arehiding from yourself, and rage is doing harm to you. A rage episode is bothstressful and inflammatory. But to see reality clearly requires self-awareness.Most people use anger as a weapon, with the intention of attacking others,acting out of self-defense, expressing pent-up frustration, or getting what theywant through intimidation. (A minority, chiefly bullies, simply like the feelingof being angry.) These secondary benefits feel so important—or have become soconditioned over time—that the real harm being done is discounted.Not everyone has a persistent problem with anger management, of course, but allof us tend to normalize our bad behavior. For example, in a family in which thechildren witness their father abusing their mother, either physically ormentally, this aberrant behavior becomes their version of normal. Even whenchildren from backgrounds of domestic abuse hate the behavior and grow up torenounce it, their risk of turning abusive themselves is much higher thanaverage. They’ve been too conditioned by growing up in a family in which abuseisn’t taboo. In their minds there’s a confused imprint: “Daddy hits Mommy” isnext to the understanding “Daddy loves Mommy.” The contradiction between thesetwo imprints is very hard to resolve when both imprints are part of yourchildhood training.Today we are asking you to make choices that bring these old, unconsciousimprints to the surface so that they can be examined and healed.THE “DO” SIDEOur “Do” recommendations revolve around bringing core beliefs to light andexamining them. Your beliefs have tangled roots, and only you can untangle them.Some formative influences are universal, such as family attitudes, upbringing,religion, peer group attitudes, and everything that happens in school. Butexternals cannot account for why one person is so deeply affected by anexperience that rolls off another person’s back. We aren’t asking you topsychoanalyze yourself, much less to judge yourself for being bad, wrong,inferior, and so on. Our aim is simply to bring core beliefs to light so thatyou have more freedom of choice in how your life is going. Self-awareness is ahealing force. It doesn’t always bring immediate healing, but it starts you outon the path.Once you begin to see why you hold certain negative beliefs, you can retrain thebodymind, and over time, imprints from the past won’t have a strong influence onhow you think, feel, and behave. The steps of retraining aren’t mysterious, andall are under your control. Whenever you feel the grip of a thought that makesyou experience tense, angry, guilty, ashamed, or judgmental feelings, go throughthe following steps:1. Recognize the negative thought and look at it.2. Say to the thought, “I don’t need you anymore. You can go.”3. If the thought reminds you of bad things in the past, say to yourself, “I amnot that person anymore.”4. Sometimes the negative thought is so insistent that it doesn’t fade awayimmediately. Repeat the affirmations just mentioned a few more times. Lie down,take a few deep breaths, and center yourself. (In a work situation, try to finda quiet place and center yourself.)5. Keep breathing and allow your attention to go wherever it wants to, withoutresistance. As you do this, ask for relaxation to enter in. Keep going until youfeel the tension or discomfort begin to fade.6. To counter the actual content of the negative thought, replace it withsomething realistic and optimistic—both need to be present. For example, if thethought is “I’m helpless. I’ll never get through this,” the underlying belief isone of victimization and hopelessness to deal with stressful challenges. Toretrain yourself, write down all the countering thoughts you can think of.In this case, the realistic, optimistic thoughts might include the following:~ “I’m not really helpless. There are solutions if I look for them.”~ “I’ve survived worse crises before.”~ “Feeling helpless is just a feeling, not a reliable way to judge thesituation.”~ “I don’t have to do this all alone. It’s okay to ask for help, advice,guidance, and so on.”~ “I want to stand up on my own. I welcome this as an opportunity to grow.”This kind of retraining is absolutely critical if real, lasting change is tooccur. Core beliefs are like icebergs showing only the tip above water. In fact,that’s what makes the word core appropriate. When you encounter someone whopersists in self-defeating behavior, something deeper in the psyche isgenerating it, like a microchip constantly sending out the same signal. In hiscritically admired memoir Born to Run, Bruce Springsteen speaks with unusualcandor about the roots of his drive to become a rock star. He grew up with afather who drank heavily, a brooding man who offered no encouragement or supportfor his son. Springsteen declares that his chief memory of his father is that hesat in the dark in the kitchen drinking and never speaking. Springsteen believeshis father hardly spoke a thousand words the entire time he grew up.This powerful imprint had far-reaching consequences, but they can’t be labeledstrictly negative. The classic rock song “Born to Run” became an iconicSpringsteen hit, but it revealed his own motivation in life, to run away from anemotionally disabled father, to find his own authentic self, to make somethingout of his talent, and above all to keep running. Added to the emotional mix wasa powerful source of love, which came from Springsteen’s grandmother. She hadlost a very young daughter who ran out into the street and got hit by a car. Herchronic grief never lifted, and when Bruce came along, she found an intense,burning focus for all her maternal love.Bruce’s parents were too poor for one of them to stay home and raise theirchild, and his care was given over to his grandmother. As a result he became alittle prince (or tyrant) enveloped in her all-consuming love. Springsteen looksback upon those years with mixed feelings, knowing that his grandmother’s lovefilled a hole in his heart but also seeing the obsessive and unrealistic side ofit. Psyches don’t balance positive and negative influences on a scale with oneside outweighing the other. Instead, the now familiar cloud of influencesdevelops in an amorphous way that is hard to define or grasp.For Springsteen the urge to escape was overwhelming, and music became hissalvation. But if we turn back to the Harvard study on aging, the point was madethat money and fame cannot substitute for close, loving relationships.Springsteen found himself unable to sustain a close relationship, always findingways to drive girlfriends away. With considerable insight he identifies theunderlying dynamic. He had a core belief that he was unlovable; therefore, whenanyone got too close, he lashed out, punishing the other person for having theeffrontery to dare to love him.Caught in this psychological knot, Springsteen discovered that he was in adouble bind: the thing that would heal him, love, was the very thing he mostfeared and pushed away. In time, he went through intensive psychotherapy, and hewas fortunate to marry a woman who “whipped me into shape,” as he puts it. Inother words, she loved him enough that she refused to be pushed away. It takesreal courage to undo a core belief that you are unlovable. Often what’s involvedis a formative experience in which the people who are supposed to love you, yourparents, are at the same time the source of your deepest hurt. Springsteen wasin essence an abandoned child, even though his grandmother’s love couldcompensate for that to some extent. Unfortunately, compensation isn’t the sameas healing. Today, past sixty-five and still needing to perform as both artisticexpression and self-preservation, Springsteen has walked the path ofself-awareness, but the depth of his early emotional abuse exacts a price inbouts of severe depression.So what can we learn from this story, aside from the fact that it came from avery famous public celebrity? To us, the story reinforces the points we’ve beenmaking about how healing works. The earlier you face your past wounds, thebetter. Running away and acting out only work in the short run and are obstaclesin the long run. Yet with enough self-awareness healing is always possible,beginning with the belief that you want to heal and deserve to.THE “UNDO” SIDEWhen it comes to core beliefs, doing and undoing are merged. No one escapes thegrip of their deep-held beliefs, and when you seek healing, there are oldimprints that must be erased in order for new beliefs to really sink in.Retraining will always involve untraining. To begin the process you need tobecome unstuck, which is the focus of our “Undo” choices. Harmful beliefs aren’tone-dimensional. They create consequences to your cells, perhaps even yourepigenome; they are significant for your level of stress and inflammation; theydictate your reflex reactions; and in the end they are invisibly woven into yourmood, emotions, and even your view of life.This is an area in which you need to commit yourself to inner transformation.Mindful techniques and meditation clear the way by providing more detachment andself-awareness. You begin to identify with a level of the mind that doesn’t needanger, fear, stress, agitated feelings, and constant drama. Having experienced astate in which these things don’t exist, you will naturally begin to questionthe other state, which countless people are stuck in, in which anger, fear,stress, agitated feelings, and constant drama are so common, they’re simply agiven. Opening into a higher state of consciousness is a lifelong journey, andcore beliefs are just one aspect. But they are very useful as an example of howbeing attracted to the good is matched by being pushed away from the bad.What we’re asking you to undo is rigidity, closed-mindedness, mindless habit,outworn beliefs, attitudes that bring stress to yourself and others, andus-versus-them thinking. These things only get undone through expandedself-awareness.To be totally frank, self-awareness has its skeptics and detractors. Societydrums in the axiom “What you don’t know can’t hurt you,” despite the dozens ofreasons why this isn’t true. Inertia keeps us stuck in place; fear of looking atthe underside of our behavior promotes a state of denial. With these defenses infull swing, it becomes easy to believe that becoming more aware of our problemswill only lead to more hurt. There’s no doubt that if healing was about diggingup the pain of the past, few people would make the effort. But the whole picturedoesn’t look like that. Once you start to become aware of a harmful belief, thepain that returns isn’t the same as the original pain—this time you can reflectupon it and consciously address it. Pain that has control over you is far worsethan pain you can control. On the other side, the experience of being at peace,pain-free, and self-accepting is pleasurable and motivates you to stay on thehealing path.There are endless possibilities for believing in this or that, but one singlefactor, we believe, binds all negative core beliefs—judging against yourself.Self-judgment is so painful that people will do almost anything to escape theguilt and shame it induces. When Bruce Springsteen discovered deep inside thathe was punishing the women in his life for daring to love him, he hit one of themost distressing kinds of self-judgment. Self-judgment isn’t about how you act,think, feel, or behave. It goes to the very heart of who you believe you are,your very identity.What you believe about yourself has both positive and negative effects. If deepdown you believe “I must be successful at all costs,” you will gain a strongmotivation, which is positive. But if you believe success involves ruthless,selfish, and hurtful behavior, your motivation is disfigured by the belief thatyou are the kind of person who has no choice but to be ruthless, selfish, andhurtful. This is what it means to have your belief control you instead of theother way around. “I’m here to become a success. I don’t need anyone to love me”is a defense against facing the issue of whether you are lovable to begin with,and other forms of self-judgment are usually involved, such as “I have to takecare of myself because no one else wants to” and “I don’t want anyone to see howweak I really am, so I’ll always stay on the offensive.”Love is something everyone naturally wants to give and receive, untilself-judgment compromises this desire. But it doesn’t stand alone. There arefour core beliefs that heal self-judgment:• I am loving and lovable.• I am worthy.• I am trusting, safe, and secure.• I am fulfilled.You already hold core beliefs in these four areas of love, self-worth, feelingsecure, and feeling fulfilled. For most people there’s confusion and compromisethat blocks the pure feelings that should naturally be there. Withself-awareness you can reach clarity by finding a level of the mind where love,self-worth, security, and fulfillment can be experienced directly, without theshadow of a doubt. When you are settled and at peace after meditation, forexample, self-judgment is absent. The same is true when you first wake up in themorning or just before falling asleep at night. In all these instances yourego-personality, complete with all the beliefs that reinforce “I, me, and mine,”has withdrawn, but your awareness hasn’t. You are experiencing wakefulness as asteady state. We’ll expand on this state on Sunday, the day devoted to evolution(this page [Chop_9780451495532_epub3_c018_r1.xhtml#page_253]). For now, we justwant you to be aware that getting unstuck from self-judgment doesn’t have to bea trial; the wakeful state is the easiest, most natural state to be in.If you look in the mirror, where do you stand on being loved and lovable,feeling worthy, feeling secure, and experiencing inner fulfillment? Many peoplewould privately concede that there is a lack in these areas, but they don’t knowwhat to do. First, realize that no one was born with core beliefs. The issues oflove, self-worth, security, and fulfillment evolve as life unfolds. Societyoffers little reliable guidance, so core beliefs are decided at the level of theprivate self, which confronts emotions, and the higher self, which providesvision, meaning, and purpose. Emotions pull us up and down, this way and that.The higher self always brings us to our center.Therefore, the strategy for healing your core beliefs lies with the higher selfalone. Higher implies many things, but it shouldn’t mean something far out ofreach. We will soon discuss this more. Here we just want to say that findinglove, self-worth, security, and fulfillment is a process. If you enter theprocess, you will find these things within yourself. They aren’t a matter ofstruggle and strain. Your higher self wants to give you your heart’s desire.With this in mind, healing your core beliefs is a matter of connecting with yourown true nature. What could be more inspiring?"},{"pageContent":"SATURDAYNON-STRUGGLETODAY’S RECOMMENDATIONS—CHOOSE ONLY ONE.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------DOTake an allowing attitude.Approach a situation without resistance.Act gracefully.Share a responsibility.Encourage areas of flow.UNDOStop resisting where you don’t need to.Let someone else have their way.Help reduce an area of conflict.Remove obstacles from someone else’s path.Ease competition in favor of cooperation.“Non-struggle” isn’t a familiar term, but we’re using it to embrace three thingsthat are familiar: surrender, acceptance, and flow. Surrender is about giving upyour attachments, whether to a grievance, which would be a negative attachment,or to a wish that will never come true, which is a positive attachment. Positiveand negative aren’t all that important if an attachment keeps you stuck inplace. Acceptance is about the truth that reality is never wrong. In human lifereality is dynamic and moving. Wherever it wants to go, that’s the directionthat will prevail even if we resist because life seems to be heading in thewrong direction. Flow is about approaching life as a smooth, self-directedstream of events.When surrender, acceptance, and flow merge, you are leading your life withoutstruggle. As a formulation, this sounds very appealing, but society imposes avalue system that tilts strongly in another direction. Society teaches us,especially in the West, that surrender is what happens when you are on thelosing side of a struggle. Acceptance is a resigned sense that what you wantisn’t going to happen—you have to settle. Flow is what rivers do, not what isneeded to face the hard realities of life.A much larger belief system lies behind these negative connotations, one thatinsists that struggle is necessary in order to survive. Struggle has a mythicfoundation in the Old Testament, the fabled Fall of Adam and Eve. The Fall cameabout when Eve persuaded Adam to eat the fruit of the tree of knowledge.Suddenly the first humans knew shame over their nakedness and earned punishmentfor the sin of disobeying God. The Fall was a catastrophic event—God punishedAdam and Eve by throwing them out of Paradise and condemning them to lifelongtoil and suffering.Leaving aside the religious implications, the story of the Fall explains thehuman condition, and that’s where the choice between struggle and non-strugglestill rests. Deep down we all hold on to beliefs that tell us how life is—andmust be. The last phrase is important, because if life “must be this way,” weare powerless to change it. Consider the three indices of happiness used by theGallup organization to measure well-being (this page[Chop_9780451495532_epub3_c011_r1.xhtml#page_154]): suffering, struggling, andthriving. Without a doubt there is immense suffering in the world, but that’snot the same as saying there must be suffering in the world. Not unless yourbelief system tells you so.Today we ask you to examine your connection to struggle as something you have toaccept. Ironically, people who participate in lifelong struggle have acceptedand surrendered in their own way; what they accept and surrender to is a beliefthat struggle is unavoidable. The opposite worldview would be something likeBuddhism, which holds that pain and pleasure are inevitably connected to eachother, and therefore the way to rise above suffering is to stop participating inthe cycle of pleasure and pain. To do this, a person seeks and finds a level ofself-awareness that is eternally the same, eternally peaceful, and undisturbedby the mind’s ceaseless activity.This worldview, which opens the way to non-struggle, also has its own “must”:the seeker must be mindful, must turn his back on the pursuit of pleasure, mustfocus on expanded self-awareness, and must accept that the goal of non-struggleis possible. The reason that most people don’t reach the goal isn’t mysterious:they find it too difficult to follow the “musts” that this entails. Let’s setaside the specific teachings of Buddhism. From an everyday perspective, peoplewant to stop struggling. There’s no need for a higher doctrine or teaching—thenaked experience of beating your head against the hard realities is motivationenough.A moment of soul-searching is needed first. Think of an aspect of your personallife in which you find yourself struggling. Here are the main areas where youmight look:Struggling with yourselfStruggling in your relationshipsStruggling to improve your life materiallyStruggling against the world and external forcesYour struggles, big or little, are likely to fall into these four categories,and if you keep looking, more examples will probably come to mind. A personcaught in the throes of addiction or depression is at one extreme of strugglingwith themselves—the fight is “in here.” Another person who is resisting hisoutbursts of anger or who wants to live up to religious ideals (such as avoidingsin and temptation) experiences the middle ground of self-struggle. Someone whohas a high degree of self-acceptance and self-worth experiences smallerstruggles, such as trying to maintain a desirable weight or remain young. Inshort, no life is without areas of struggle, even when someone falls intoGallup’s category of thriving.Because there are so many ways struggle can manifest, people miss the questionthat matters most: Is any of this struggle actually necessary? Without payingattention to the question, people keep on living as if the answer is yes. Theystruggle because they feel they have to. To see how this works, consider thefollowing list, which uncovers the psychological attitudes behind everydaystruggle.WHY ARE YOU STILL STRUGGLING?I can’t see a way out.I’m in a bad place emotionally (depressed, anxious, helpless).I feel conflicted and confused inside.The situation is complicated.I made bad choices that I’m stuck with—you can’t turn back the clock.It’s been this way as long as I can remember.I’m too scared to fight back.It’s not me—life is hard.I’m in too deep—I feel overwhelmed.Someone else is in control of the situation.I’ve got no one to turn to.I deserve this.These are the most common rationales for getting mired in struggle, not tomention suffering. If you find yourself in a critical situation that severelytests your ability to cope, such as a nasty divorce or declaring bankruptcy,everything on the list might run through your mind at one time or another. Pausefor a moment and go back mentally to a difficult time in your life. Can youidentify with things on the list that keep you stuck and unable to move?Rationales are powerful because there is an aspect of “must” in them; otherwise,you’d find a way out instead of wasting time and energy on rationalizing why youare stuck.We’re not saying that you or anyone else is to blame for your struggles. Somesituations are unavoidable, and external forces are always at play. Gettingfired, having to care for a parent with dementia, dealing with a teenager usingdrugs—life brings countless tests. But you add to your difficulties by attaching“must” to them. Getting to a place of non-struggle is the same as eradicatingthe “must” from your worldview.THE “DO” SIDELife flows as you choose to let it—that’s the central theme of today’s “Do”recommendations. The bodymind is designed for unobstructed flow. Informationmoves everywhere freely; processes are interwoven; the same purpose—to live andthrive—is shared by every cell. When the flow is blocked, the bodymind runs intoresistance and obstacles. This is an internal situation—we decide for whateverreason to accept the need for struggle. Once a “must” is in place, it tends togo viral. Your attitude infects others around you, and because your “must”insists on having its way, situations mirror your inner world.By the same token, if you trust that life can take care of itself, which is thebedrock of every cell in your body, outer reality will begin to conform to yourinner world. Optimism, allowing, nonresistance, tolerance, self-acceptance—thesecan go viral, too. This phenomenon can only be known by testing it. Sociologistsalready have tested it, after a fashion. One of the largest databases forlifestyle choices is the Framingham Heart Study, which began in 1948 with 5,200residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. Although the principal aimof the study is cardiovascular health, sifting through the data revealed aninexplicable finding.A person’s overall risk of having a heart attack includes their familybackground. Someone raised in a household where there is smoking, a sedentarylifestyle, obesity, and so on is more likely to adopt those things in their ownlife. Extending this fairly obvious connection, if someone belongs to a circleof friends who smoke, lead a sedentary lifestyle, or are obese, the chances offollowing suit are increased. But the inexplicable part enters with friends offriends. The tendency to make a specific lifestyle choice like smoking increasesoutside the circle of people you know. For example, if your parents smoke, yousmoke, and your friends smoke, there is an increased risk that the people yourparents and friends know will smoke, too, even though you never meet them. Inother words, a habit can go viral.Because there are good habits as well as bad, it’s a small step to see that ifyou grew up in a loving family, which would decrease your risk of heart attack,you will be loving, you will have loving friends, and somehow, their friends aremore likely to be loving. So the data from the Framingham Heart Study wouldindicate, even though no one knows what the actual explanation is. Our point isthat if you take an attitude of accepting, surrendering, and letting thingsflow, the effect can go viral. Reality around you will display less struggle andmore non-struggle.To prove that this is possible, you must test it yourself by trying out the“Dos” on our list. If you find yourself in a situation today that cries out foryou to step in, intervene, take control, assume full responsibility, tell othershow to behave, and so on, recognize this as the perfect opportunity to see ifthe situation can flow into a good resolution without your intervention. Even ifthe outcome isn’t perfect, you will be surprised at how well non-struggle works.Flow is a real phenomenon, and the more you become convinced, the more you willrealize that the “must” behind all your struggles isn’t necessary to hold on to.THE “UNDO” SIDEIf flow is a real phenomenon, why don’t we see it at work all the time? Becausewe create internal resistance and roadblocks to control life. We can’t reallyblame ourselves for this desire. It’s hardwired in us to do what we can tosurvive, and in our fast-paced world today most of us are living at ahypersurvival level. Whether it’s realistic or not, we want to control the worldaround us. The “undo” recommendations for today focus on becoming aware of yourresistance as it occurs. Specifically, you are stopping the flow whenever youCreate stress for yourself or someone else.Insist that you are right and others are wrong.Act judgmental.Make it your way or the highway.Refuse to listen to outside voices.Put someone else down in public.Impose your own morality.Today be vigilant about how these behaviors are cropping up at work, in yourrelationships, or in family life. We all justify our behavior, so it might beeasier to observe if other people are acting this way. Then you can reflect onthe part you’re playing. For example, if something as trivial as arguing over amovie or TV show comes down to “I’m right” versus “No, you’re wrong,” thetug-of-war needs two people to hold their end of the rope.Whenever you become aware that you are blocking the flow, stop and get out ofthe way. This may mean literally walking away or else altering your behavior. Inthe world’s wisdom traditions, reality “out there” mirrors reality “in here.”Whether you fully accept that every situation is a self-reflection, you canremove roadblocks and stop resisting, then observe for yourself if the externalsituation shifts of its own accord.“LIFE CAN TAKE CARE OF ITSELF”If the bodymind has evolved to take care of itself in countless exquisite ways,could the same be true everywhere? The question points in a spiritual direction,because it asks if life itself is designed to support human beings. Are we sospecial? In spiritual traditions both East and West the answer is yes. Byteaching that the soul or higher self is real, a long line of sages, saints, andspiritual guides has affirmed some basic truths:Nothing is random. Every experience fits into a larger scheme.The larger scheme is embedded in consciousness.Everyone is connected to the larger scheme, whether they know it or not.To understand where you belong in the larger scheme, you must expand yourawareness.No matter how you define “the larger scheme,” these teachings are totally absentin secular society. Nothing like God’s plan, redemption of the soul, karma, ornirvana fits the modern secular model. Two worldviews clash, and therepercussions touch everyday life. In the spiritual worldview human beings arecherished in the universe, which is governed by a cosmic mind; in the secularscientific worldview human beings are a speck in the black void of outer space,existing on the same level as hydrogen atoms or the Milky Way as a product ofrandom chance unfolding after the big bang. Between these two opposingworldviews there is no compromise—the choice is either/or.This is true in the abstract, but in daily life people fence-sit. How often haveyou heard the following remarks?There are no accidents.Nothing is really a coincidence.Everything happens for a reason.Be careful what you wish for.No good deed goes unpunished.As you sow, so shall you reap.You can believe any of these things and also believe that getting rear-ended intraffic is an accident. Our mind inhabits both realities, crossing from one tothe other as we please. When someone says, “Everything happens for a reason,”the implication is that there is a hidden pattern in everyday events. Thishidden pattern offers glimpses of itself, but only glimpses. By now almosteveryone knows the term synchronicity, which sees a meaning in coincidences.Freud, being a committed atheist and a scientist, had no use for higher powers,the soul, spiritual experiences, or synchronicity. His rebellious acolyte Jung,who invented the term synchronicity (defined as two events that are meaningfullyconnected but have no causal relationship), couldn’t persuade him.As quoted on the website Physics Forums:> The first real crisis in their friendship came in spring 1909, from the> following incident. Jung visited Freud in Vienna and asked his opinion on> precognition and parapsychology. But Freud was too materialistic and rejected> these matters in a way that upset Jung. A strange thing happened then. As> Freud was leaving, Jung felt his diaphragm burning and a very loud crack came> from the bookcase next to them. When Jung told Freud that this is a perfect> example of paranormal phenomenon, he still denied it. Then Jung predicted that> in a moment there would be another loud noise. And he was right; a second loud> crack came from the bookcase. Freud remained puzzled and this incident raised> his mistrust toward Jung.What really happened that day? The line between synchronicity and the paranormalhas been blurry from the beginning, but the larger issue is this: Do our mindsaffect reality “out there”? People silently answer the question when theybelieve in things like “Be careful what you wish for.” To fully accept thatinner and outer reality are connected, you’d commit to beliefs like thefollowing:God is always listening.We live in a conscious universe.The human mind is a reflection of cosmic mind.No prayer goes unheard.If you wish hard enough, dreams come true.So in everyday life, we all have divided allegiances. By seizing on even a faintbelief that the world “out there” reflects who you are and what you desire “inhere,” you can test the truth. In this chapter we’ve offered non-struggle astrue and real. Despite all the struggle you see around you, none of it mustexist. This can be one of the most profound realizations in your rise to higherconsciousness. You can experience non-struggle by following your own personaljourney. The division between “in here” and “out there” never existed in thefirst place. The exquisite way in which the bodymind functions as a whole tellsus that, indeed, life can take care of itself. No other proof is needed. Itsounds lofty to say that someone is on a journey to higher consciousness, butthe truth is more humble. The journey takes us to the state of trust,acceptance, and flow that sustains every cell."},{"pageContent":"SUNDAYEVOLUTIONTODAY’S RECOMMENDATIONS—CHOOSE ONLY ONE.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------DOBe on the lookout for synchronicity (meaningful coincidences).Change your daily narrative for the better.Look for a chance to be compassionate.Openly express love and appreciation.Be generous of spirit.UNDOResist the voice of fear.If you find yourself expecting the worst, step away from that expectation andremain neutral.If you have a negative thought that keeps returning, ask if it is truly servingyou or is a relic of the past.If you feel emotionally upset, find a quiet place to become more calm andcentered.Seek the company of people who inspire and uplift you.Sunday is an appropriate day to reflect upon your highest values. Everyone hasaspirations. Everyone wants a life filled with meaning and purpose. The resultsof these desires take decades to unfold. In the end, however, those who arriveat old age feeling fulfilled will enjoy a higher quality of life than those wholook back with regret, frustration, and nostalgia, even if their lifespan inyears is the same. We’ve spent most of this book talking about how negativeinfluences like stress and inflammation build up incrementally over time. Butthe same is true of personal growth. The soul ripens incrementally, day by day.When this happens, life is a rising arc from birth to death. So how can thisvision be turned into reality?Our whole-system approach to the bodymind has blossomed into a healing lifestylethat will bring benefits for a lifetime. The final step is to take awhole-system approach to life itself. For that to happen, you need anall-encompassing vision. Religion provides just such a vision. Think of thestatements a staunch believer can make that apply to all of life, such as thefollowing:It’s all in God’s hands.Faith will carry me through.God is all-merciful.As you sow, so shall you reap.Man proposes, God disposes.These are all-embracing statements of belief, and if you adhere to them, yourentire life will be directed in ways that don’t apply to a staunch atheist.Atheism leads to another set of all-embracing statements, such as the following:The universe is ruled by random events.Miracles are fictitious.Religion is an irrational superstition.Choices need to be based on reason and logic.It’s easy to see that a whole-system approach to life is more common than youmight suppose at first glance. Leaving aside religious issues, many people saythings like “The family is everything” or “Success is ten percent inspirationand ninety percent perspiration.” But is there a similar mindset that applies tohealing? Can you stand above day-to-day events and hold on to an all-embracingvision that applies to life itself?The most successful vision that fits the bill is evolution, a theory thataccounts for every life-form, from one-celled micro-organisms and blue-greenalgae (both billions of years old), to a baby born in a hospital, to you readingthis sentence. If you can evolve personally throughout your lifespan, you willhave secured an all-embracing vision. Today our recommendations focus on yourpersonal growth/evolution and how to maximize it. To begin with, set asideDarwinian evolution, which is confined to the survival and nonsurvival ofspecies, which means very large groups. Darwinism explains why the saber-toothedtiger emerged from primitive ancestors and finally declined until it becameextinct. But Darwinism doesn’t tell us anything about a single saber-toothedtiger as an individual.This is because survival and extinction are ruled by genetic mutations thatspread throughout a plant or animal population. If the mutation leads to asurvival advantage, it becomes embedded in that species. Human beings long agoescaped this setup. Instead of only the physically strong surviving, we takecare of the weak (through health-care plans and retirement payments, forexample), and competing for a mate isn’t through physical combat. A poet has asmuch chance to win a loved one’s hand as a weight lifter.There are many arguments over how and why Homo sapiens evolved, which we won’tenter into here (a whole section of our book Super Genes covers the territory).For the purposes of healing, only one point proves critical—the personalevolution of the individual. Evolution for an individual is happening now. We’vealready offered one validation of this point in epigenetics, which has shown howexperiences over a lifetime imprint markers that affect gene activity. Someresearchers even hold that epigenetic markers from the mother or father can settheir baby’s view of how life works (see this page[Chop_9780451495532_epub3_c011_r1.xhtml#page_163]).These clues point in the right direction, and so does the evolution of the humanbrain. Traditionally, the brain is viewed as divided into three parts, from theoldest to the most recent. One can visualize the tripartite brain as being likethe staff of an English manor house, which in this case houses the mind. Themanor perpetually buzzes with activity, and each of us is the lord or ladyoverseeing the servants, who correspond to every region of the brain. Downstairsbustles the oldest brain, the reptilian or lower brain, which is nearly half abillion years old. It is organized around survival instincts likefight-or-flight, the urge to mate, and so on, instincts that first emerged infish and primitive reptiles. Halfway upstairs is the limbic system, which isorganized around emotions and bonding. It arose as long ago as 250 million yearswith the first mammals, who so far as we know are capable of somethingresembling human emotions (for example, elephants grieve over their dead andporpoises come to the aid of their sick and injured). Somehow the limbic systemacquired the ability to remember pleasurable and painful experiences, and fromthere arose our desire to repeat the pleasurable ones and avoid the painfulones.At the top landing of the stairs is the most recent brain region, the cortex,where the elite servants wait on the lord and lady of the manor. Everything wethink about and decide is managed here. The cortex surrounds the brain like thebark of a tree (cortex is Latin for “bark”). When you are deep in thought, yourbrow furrows, and strangely enough, furrows, crevices, and grooves turned Homosapiens into thinkers. The cortex in rats and mice is smooth. In cats thesurface becomes irregular, and grooves start to appear in primates. Evolvedspecies like higher primates and dolphins have deeper, more complicated grooves.But nothing surpasses the biological origami of the cerebral cortex in humans,which is folded into an intricate map that corresponds to the richness of ourmental activity. Language, music, and art occur here. (Shakespeare and Mozartare literally groovy!)We argue that the real you is none of the activities in these brain regions. Thereal you is the lord and lady of the manor who observe these activities—everyfeeling, thought, and fancy of the mind. What links the higher brain to personalevolution is quite unique and yet mysterious. It’s the ability to be self-aware.Self-awareness spans the immense territory between “Who am I?” and “This is thereal me,” between self-doubt and self-mastery. Humans experience a bewilderingrange of self-generated images as we look in the mirror. Seeing ourselves, wecan adopt a wide range of psychological profiles, including the following:Self-satisfied, egotistical, selfish, and blind to our own faultsSelf-doubting, humble, altruistic, and keenly aware of our shortcomingsIntroverted, reflective, contemplative, and privateExtroverted, aggressive, competitive, and gregariousThese qualities exist in mix-and-match fashion, and for each trait there arepolar extremes. So many possibilities exist, in fact, that one could assign aunique profile to everyone on Earth. Without self-awareness we betray ouruniqueness and fall into stereotypes and conformity. Habit and conditioningovertake mindfulness. Going along to get along becomes second nature. If theseexternal forces gain the upper hand, a person can live life by rote, existingmore or less as a biological robot.Because we are self-aware, human beings do not simply live: we also watch ourlives unfold. It’s not possible to get into the nervous system of a humpbackwhale, giraffe, or panda, but in some way these creatures have their own speciesof consciousness. It’s not simply the physical resemblance that makes tigers andlions members of the same family as a housecat prowling for sparrows on thelawn. They are linked by behavior, and this behavior goes back to how catsperceive the world. They are hunters, prowlers, capable of stealth, patientlycrouching before they pounce, and so on.Today’s recommendations revolve around exploring your unique participation inthe human species of consciousness. That’s a high-flown phrase, we know, butwhen all is said and done, planet Earth will thrive or decline depending on onething: whether human consciousness can evolve. If it can, global warming can bestabilized and perhaps reversed. If human consciousness doesn’t evolve, inertiawill lead us into deeper risk of calamity.THE “DO” SIDETo evolve, you need to get into the habit of noticing where a new perspectivegoes beyond what you are already used to. Today’s “Do” recommendations involvejust such shifts. Once you free yourself from your accustomed viewpoint,entirely new levels of awareness become possible. At this moment everyone isliving out a story in their heads. A good day adds something positive to thestory; a bad day slightly undermines the story. The ups and downs of daily lifedepend on the themes of your story, such as winning versus losing, loving versushating, leading versus following, and so on.The themes we live by are well-known and fairly standard, because we absorbedthem from our family, friends, and society.HOW YOUR PERSONAL STORY KEEPS GOINGTHE THEMES YOU REINFORCE EVERY DAY:Mindful or mindless Giving or taking Optimistic or pessimistic Supporting ordependent Winning or losing Loving or not loving Thriving or strugglingAttractive or unattractive Active or passive Helping or hindering Doer orthinker Hungry or satisfied Loner or gregarious Seeking or holding tight Leaderor follower Progress or inertia Vigilant or relaxed Confident or timid Acceptingor challenging Decisive or indecisiveLife is led by reinforcing both positive and negative themes, because they lendstructure to a person’s story. Without themes, the story would turn shapeless.Yet positive and negative themes share the same flaw. They bind you inside yourstory. It’s better to win than to lose, for example, but if we heed the world’swisdom traditions, winning and losing are opposites that depend on each other.Therefore, winners will always eventually face loss. Optimism will eventuallyfail. Loving will eventually lead to disappointment. Evolution occurs when youstop identifying with these themes—known as the state of duality—and begin tomeasure your life in ways that are not dual, not dependent on opposites. Whatwe’re talking about are the fundamental qualities of consciousness that liedeeper in our awareness.THE CORE QUALITIES OF CONSCIOUSNESSIntelligent Evolutionary Creative Self-organizing Self-aware KnowingSelf-sustaining Compassionate Alive Truthful Dynamic BeautifulHuman beings can consciously evolve by discovering that these qualities are realand attainable. That’s what the “Do” recommendations set out to demonstrate. Ifyou align yourself with any of these qualities—we’ve just suggested a handful onthe “Do” side—you will be directing your own personal evolution. But this mustbe more than an ego choice, because ego choices are based on duality. The ego’sreason for being truthful instead of lying is that it gains a benefit or avoidsa risk. “What’s in it for me?” is the basic ego question. The core qualities ofconsciousness transcend personal identity. They apply to mind itself, the pureessence of being alive and possessing awareness.Today you can decide to build your story on these primal themes instead of theones most people accept and live by. Dualism is insecure. What is given can betaken away. The thing you most desire can wind up being a disappointment. Likeschange to dislikes and vice versa. Some people have exaggerated, evenone-dimensional stories, like “I’m a winner” or “I’m a cockeyed optimist.” Butone way or another, people base their stories on themes that are constructs towhich we attach ourselves.Today we are asking you to take a higher view, to watch yourself as you keepliving the same story. Only then can you make a choice that bases your story onpermanent, unshakable values, like acting out of compassion or expressing loveand appreciation. To really be transformed, your story must evolve, and yourstory can’t evolve unless your consciousness evolves.THE “UNDO” SIDEEveryone believes their own story, even when it’s divorced from reality. Thinkof fashion models who are insecure because in their own minds they aren’tattractive enough; their self-esteem is rocked by a pimple or the first wrinkle.Think of a professional baseball player on a dismally losing team who stillfeels like a winner—winning is what got him into the major leagues to beginwith. We hold on to our stories for emotional reasons; therefore, the “Undo”recommendations for today are all about getting free of emotional bonds. Thebonds that keep us feeling insecure, unsafe, anxious, pessimistic, frustrated,and unfulfilled are blocking our evolution.A useful concept here is the “emotional body.” It includes the ingrainedemotions that sustain you the same way your cells support the physical body. Intheir emotional bodies one person may include feeling loved, safe, secure, andoptimistic while another person feels the opposite. If you try to improve yourstory, the ideal is to base it on the core qualities of consciousness we’ve justdiscussed. But this can’t happen if your emotional body is wounded. There issimply too great a gap.Your emotional body can be healed. Undoing the wounds you have suffered from thepast is a viable process anyone can undertake. The symptoms are easy to spot—anystrong negative thought that repeats itself is a symptom of pain in youremotional body. Let’s look at a few of the best and easiest techniques fordispelling negative thoughts from the emotional body.1. CATCH YOUR NEGATIVITY EARLY.Once you are sunk deep in gloom or anxiety, it’s more likely that you will findit hard to lift yourself up. So be on the lookout for the first signs ofnegativity. As soon as you spot a mood shift toward irritability, anger,frustration, worry, or pessimism, pause immediately. Take a few deep breaths,center yourself. Let the emotion pass, and get yourself somewhere quiet andpleasant, such as going outdoors for a walk.2. AVOID EXTERNAL STRESSORS.Dark thoughts usually occur under stress, and if you can, you should get awayfrom the stressor, whether it’s a negative person, a tense situation at work, orbad news on TV. Dark thoughts set in when they are reinforced, so don’t letanyone or anything reinforce your bad mood if you have the choice to avoid it.3. DEVELOP A SUPPORTIVE INNER DIALOGUE.About 75 to 80 percent of people talk to themselves in their heads, and a smallminority even hear inner conversations. When the voice in your head startssaying things that induce worry, fear, anger, guilt, shame, or lack ofself-esteem, pause for a moment, and say to the voice “That’s not me anymore.”Repeat until the dark thoughts depart. You might also try “I don’t need thisanymore. It doesn’t serve me.”4. KEEP COMPANY WITH POSITIVE, OPTIMISTIC PEOPLE.We all have friends and family members who are downers. They are pessimistic orcomplaining; they insist on seeing worst-case scenarios and failure around thenext bend. Inertia keeps us from walking away from these people, and sometimesyou’re stuck in situations you can’t escape. But you can cultivate friendshipswith positive, optimistic people. Sociological studies have shown that you aremore likely to adopt positive attitudes and behavior if you keep company withfriends who already display them.5. TRY A “THOUGHT-REPLACEMENT” STRATEGY.A technique that lies at the heart of cognitive therapy (an approach thataddresses thoughts and beliefs rather than feelings) is to question negativethoughts by asking if they are actually true. For example, if you begin to feelfrustrated and think, “What’s the use? Things never work out,” these thoughtsare tested against reality. You say to yourself, “Actually, things sometimes dowork out for me. I have succeeded by persevering. This might be one of thosesituations.”The secret here is to be specific and honest with yourself. When any negativethought arises, challenge that thought’s validity. Instead of “No one loves me,”you replace that thought with “My mother loves me, and my good friends do, too.I’m not helping myself by exaggeration and self-pity.” Once you get accustomedto a thought-replacement approach, you’ll be amazed at its effectiveness. Moodsfollow thoughts, which is why discovering that your bank account is bigger thanyou thought makes you cheerful, while discovering that your credit card balanceis twice as high as you thought makes you feel uneasy.6. DEVELOP BEING CENTERED AND DETACHED.Being detached can be a positive state; it’s not the same as being indifferentor bored. Instead, you are centered inside yourself, which allows you to viewsituations as a witness, without being swayed or emotionally rattled. Detachmentdevelops naturally through the regular practice of meditation, because once youexperience the centered, quiet, unshakable level of your mind, you easily learnhow to return there at will.7. GET “STICKY” EMOTIONS TO MOVE.As we’ve been saying, negative feelings have a mind-body connection, which youcan feel physically. After a bout of getting angry or crying, it takes a whilebefore your body settles down. This is due to various hormones, the stressresponse, and other biochemicals that do not clear immediately. You can help theclearing process by various means:Taking deep steady breathsLying down and restingWalking outside“Toning,” the technique of letting spontaneous sounds arise as they will (lowgroans, moans, shouts, etc.)Deep, repeated sighsEveryone needs to have a set of coping skills, and these are among the mostuseful and effective. Heavy thoughts don’t have to cloud your day. You have goodchoices for how to lift yourself out of them.THE HIGHEST EVOLUTIONMillions of people have stepped onto the spiritual path over the past fewdecades. The steady decline in organized religion, which began early in thepostwar era, doesn’t mean that the present generation is less spiritual.Spirituality is about going beyond the union of body and mind to the union ofbody, mind, and soul. When people step onto the spiritual path, they want toknow how it will change them, how their life will improve, whether the dark sideof their inner life will be filled with light, and so on.We haven’t discussed these questions very much in this book for pragmaticreasons. Rudy and Deepak both accept the existence of soul, spirit, higherconsciousness, and cosmic mind. But those are contentious terms founded oncontroversial beliefs. Because they are human constructs, there is no guaranteethat any of them are more than constructs. What about transcendence, which isthe experience of a domain beyond duality? To be practical, we’ve leftspirituality out of the discussion, but spirituality cannot be divorced fromreality. Every experience is known through the bodymind, including the highestspiritual experiences. The person who feels the presence of the divine is doingso through the same nervous system that we all possess. Therefore, a healinglifestyle that brings body and mind together opens a portal to infinitepossibilities.Human evolution, having incorporated survival, emotional bonding, and reason,still has new horizons to cross. The highest state of evolution has only onerequirement: self-awareness, which the higher brain already expresses. There aremany ways to describe the highest stage of evolution—union with the soul, thestate of grace, union with God, salvation, satori, going to Heaven. The mostancient term, dating back thousands of years in India, is enlightenment. Yet anyterminology begs the question of what it feels like to reach this highest state.The peculiarity of the spiritual path is that you don’t know where you are goingwhen you start out. (This is why the Indian tradition speaks of the pathlesspath.) The goal keeps shifting and blurring or even vanishing.In our view, the unpredictability of the path is inescapable. The self who tookthe first step isn’t the self who arrives at the goal. In everyday life thisfact already holds true—the self you had as an infant, kindergartner,schoolchild, and adolescent has vanished. So it should not be disturbing if theself you identify with today also morphs into something new by evolving. Despitethe burdens of the past, with its old wounds and bad memories, we are designedfor renewal at every level of the bodymind. New thoughts and new cellsconstantly replace the old ones.For all that, there is a measure of what it’s like to reach the highest state ofevolution: you feel, once and for all, like yourself. You get to be. In adetached yet passionate manner, you can observe your instincts, fears, desires,and random thoughts as they arise and fall in your mind. When you can do thisnaturally, you no longer get stuck in the mind’s ceaseless activity as it churnsthrough thoughts, feelings, decisions, and so on. The true self is masked bythis activity, as explained in an ancient Indian parable. A coach pulled by sixhorses is driving down the road. From inside the coach a quiet voice whispers,“Stop.” The driver is amazed, having never heard this voice. Resentfully, hewhips the horses faster. Again the quiet voice from inside the coach whispers,“Stop.” The driver feels even greater consternation and lashes the horsesharder. But it dawns on him that he has never met the owner of the coach, andthe one inside the coach must be the owner. He pulls the reins, and the coachcomes to a halt.In the parable the driver is the ego, the six horses are the five senses and themind. Only when they come to a stop do they recognize that the soul is themaster of all. In meditation one can have the actual experience of quieting themind so that the true self is encountered. You intuitively know that this is aspecial experience, although it takes time to grow into full wakefulness.Another metaphor is “the light of awareness.” Some people actually see an innerlight—most often in meditation, but not necessarily—and it holds an attractionthat draws them in. Without this attraction, the true self could never overcomethe mental activity that masks it. The ego and the five senses demand yourattention. The true self gently entices.It sounds confusing that the world’s wisdom traditions make so much of silentmind. In itself, there is no virtue to silence—psychological observationsindicate that around 20 percent of people hear no mental voice in their heads.No one knows why this is so or whether it indicates anything good or bad.Silence only becomes valuable when you investigate what’s inside it. Withexpanded self-awareness, silence blossoms, so to speak. In it are embedded thecore qualities of consciousness listed on this page[Chop_9780451495532_epub3_c018_r1.xhtml#page_258]. Creativity, intelligence,knowingness, and all the rest are your birthright. They cannot be fullysuppressed, much less extinguished. Simply by being conscious you possess them,but it takes the act of waking up to notice where they reside—at your source.Unlike every other self that can be described, the true self is pure source,pure awareness, pure being.Consciousness is using your brain to create the world you are experiencing. Yourreality is limited to what you are aware of and what you experience. All humanshave evolved to inhabit a species of consciousness that’s infinitely rich withpossibilities. But the highest evolution is to inhabit the reality that fits youperfectly. This is the ultimate healing, the state of complete wholeness. Butwhat proves that such a possibility even exists? The world’s wisdom traditionsteach that only the individual can prove it to himself or herself. How? Bydeveloping self-awareness into a mindful state known as “witnessing.” (In somewritings it has also been dubbed “second attention.”)When you witness from a detached position, you no longer try to control thedetails of your life, no longer worry or struggle. That may sound like a stateof total passivity, and it would be if you tried to fabricate the witness. Ifyou really wanted to go to a certain restaurant, only to arrive and find itclosed, if you wanted to win a competition only to finish out of first place, orif you are attracted to someone who has no interest in you, you could fabricatethe response “I don’t care. It’s out of my control.” This is a forced attitudethat contradicts how you actually feel. The true witness lies deep within themind, at the source. It observes every experience from a place of calm mastery.There is no room for loss or disappointment, for the following reasons:Every experience is infused with bliss at a subtle level.You experience wholeness, not the play of light and shadow.You don’t have a personal stake in the world.The play of consciousness in all its modes holds your complete attention.In the simplest terms, you’re the ringmaster of the circus.If the witness wasn’t a natural state of the mind, none of these things would betrue. They’d constitute spiritual fiction or wishful thinking. How can youpersonally determine if spiritual experiences are real? We have an answer thatwill solve this age-old question.THE “PULL OF THE SELF”Spiritual experiences, like any other, are verified by having them. Saints andsages aren’t descended from a separate species; they were born with the samenervous system as everyone. The reason they reached higher consciousness isn’tmagical. Instead, they felt an inner force one can call the pull of the self.Nothing supernatural was involved. From day to day, they chose peace overstrife, awareness over denial, love over non-love. These qualities areappealing; they pull at everyone.But other forces also pull at us. Modern society has so much stress and rush,relieved by endless distractions, that a consciousness-based lifestyle seems outof joint. Going on a meditation retreat shows a stark contrast to all thishustle and bustle, but when you come home, the pull of everyday life isinescapable.Look at yourself today. How much time will you expend on the duties and demandsof work and family? How tired will rushing around make you feel? How much willyou long for a distraction to take your mind off everything? In practical terms,this is what the pull of normal life means. The mind is filled with the noise ofconstant activity just to keep up with everything. By itself, a meditationsession isn’t enough to counter the pull away from inner silence andself-awareness.In the world’s wisdom traditions such an obstacle was fully recognized. Itreally doesn’t matter if someone lived in ancient India at the time of theBuddha or today in the middle of a noisy city; restless minds have alwaysexisted. The solution has always been managing the pull of the self. When youattune yourself to this inner magnetism, as it were, you can maintain yourinspiration to grow and evolve over years, decades, and a lifetime.The pull of the self means reorienting your attention away from externalsituations, but that doesn’t imply that you ignore the outside world or resistit, either. To ignore is a form of denial; to resist only strengthens the holdof what you are trying to push away. Instead, what we’re talking about is a newrelationship between two worlds, the one “in here” and the one “out there.”Think of this relationship as a sliding scale with two end points.At one end point the pull of the outer world totally dominates. Life will thenhave certain inevitable qualities, as follows:• Feeling unsafe and insecure, constantly vigilant to protect yourself from thenext threat from outside.• A sense of insignificance in the face of titanic natural forces.• Pressure to protect yourself by conforming to social norms and behavior.• A constant need for outward pleasures, since only they can stimulate a senseof enjoyment from life.• Fear of disease, aging, and death.Since most people don’t actually function at this extreme, all of this may soundfar removed from daily experience, and yet somewhere along the sliding scale weexperience degrees of anxiety and stress and often feel overwhelmed by theinsecurity that comes from being very small in a very big, empty universe. Thepull of the outside world induces us to put physical reality first, and lifebecomes a struggle to find security and happiness under the threat thateverything could collapse at any moment. There are ways to mask our insecurity,like the rush of thrill-seeking, the hypnosis of entertainment, and the drive tosucceed. But by turning to the outside world for these things, we only tightenits grip on our attention.At the opposite end point the pull of the self is total surrender. Life willthen have the qualities of full enlightenment, as follows:• Being centered and quiet inside is a constant state that cannot be shaken byexternal circumstances. This leads to a sense of complete security.• One’s own awareness provides the joy and fulfillment that life is meant tobring.• Change is no longer threatening, because you see yourself as the still pointin a turning world. Experience passes through you without altering your state ofbeing.• You live in the eternal now, which makes aging and death irrelevant—they havedropped away as part of the illusion of change.• By living from your source, your true self, you are always in touch with thesource of creativity and renewed possibilities.• You have no conflicts within yourself or with other people, because thewholeness of pure consciousness eradicates the play of opposites, including theplay of light versus darkness, good versus evil.This extreme may sound remote, to the point of being otherworldly, but anyexperience that draws your attention in this direction has been caused by thepull of the self. If you pay attention, there are many moments when you feelsafe and secure; life looks beautiful; the mind is quiet and calm; you feel freeof regret and worries; the past brings no bad memories; you find it easy toaccept and appreciate your life and the people in it; an inner joy bubbles up;or you feel somehow that a higher presence exists and enfolds you.Everyone values such experiences without being told to; they are satisfying inthemselves. It doesn’t matter if the feeling lasts two days or two minutes—theexperience feels timeless. Or to be more precise, you slip out of time intoanother place that is simply here and now.If you want to evolve, meditation and making positive lifestyle choices areimportant. But evolution won’t truly take hold unless you pay attention to thepull of the self. Human beings aren’t robots whose wiring can be changed simplyby plugging our brains into meditation, prayer, positive thinking, or theinfluence of wise teachers and mentors. The authors are not discounting thosethings—they have their valued place in the world’s wisdom traditions. But thecontext of life is always about the pull of the outside world, which is noisyand fretful, happy one day and sad the next, full of pain and pleasure inunpredictable proportion. The pull of the self is quiet but true, oblivious tothe rise and fall of everyday situations. Finding non-change in the midst ofchange has long been the byword in the evolution of consciousness. The pull ofthe self, which you can notice every day, is the secret for making non-change aliving reality.Paying attention to reality “in here” is how witnessing develops. The process issimple and natural. No esoteric teachings are involved. Every spiritualexperience is a glimpse of the true self. First you observe it, then you embraceit, and finally you become it. The transformation follows an effortless flow, sothere is nothing to resist.For a book on healing to be complete, the true self must be held up as the goalof life. We spoke earlier about the mind’s bustling activity being like servantsin a great manor house. When those servants are gently dismissed, the lord andlady can enjoy the full splendor of the manor. The outside world is theirs, asis the domain of the mind. There are no more constraints, and the spirit growsbright in the enjoyment of absolute freedom. To quote the famous lines from T.S. Eliot’s poem “Little Gidding,”> We shall not cease from exploration> > And the end of all our exploring> > Will be to arrive where we started> > And know the place for the first time.The place he means is inside us, where we find the essence of who we are andhave always been. It is our true self, the healing self."},{"pageContent":"ALZHEIMER’S TODAY AND TOMORROWBY RUDY TANZII wanted to end on a strong note of hope, touching upon healing a disease thatno amount of self-care or medical science has been able to accomplish up to now.Most people approach aging with a sense of dread, despite all the improvementsin our social beliefs about growing old, because of the looming shadow ofAlzheimer’s disease. As lifespan steadily increases, a person’s healthspan—theyears spent in good health—is often as much as a decade shorter. The threat ofAlzheimer’s isn’t the only reason for this, because other disorders, principallycancer, are chiefly disorders of old age. But none is as feared as Alzheimer’s.A 2012 public opinion poll of more than 1,200 people conducted by the MaristInstitute revealed that 44 percent of respondents said that Alzheimer’s wastheir greatest health concern versus 33 percent for cancer. When asked what theyfear most about Alzheimer’s, 68 percent cited being a burden on their familiesand loved ones, followed by fear of losing memory of their lives and loved ones(32 percent).Because my professional life as a research scientist has been devoted to findingthe cause and potential cure of Alzheimer’s, I’d like to explain the disease indetail. Alzheimer’s makes for a fascinating detective story that took a sharpand perhaps decisive turn only recently.It is hard to imagine a disease worse than Alzheimer’s. We spend our entirelives, from womb to tomb, observing, learning, creating, and loving, on ajourney that moves from one experience to the next. These experiences shape usas individuals and sculpt our personalities. They define how our friends andloved ones see us as unique people in their lives. The brain’s neural networksrecord our experiences and our reactions to them, as memories. Everything wesee, hear, touch, taste, and smell is logically placed into context thanks to arich tapestry of neural connections and interactions that define who we are.This same tapestry allows us to relate to the world; in fact, every quality ofsight, sound, touch, taste, and smell depends upon the brain’s ability toconvert raw neural data into the image of a three-dimensional world.But like a merciless vandal, as we age Alzheimer’s sneaks in and insidiouslybegins to tear this neural tapestry apart, thread by thread, until the suffererno longer recognizes their friends and family, who can only stand by andhelplessly watch as their loved one disappears. Alzheimer’s is a callous andrelentless thief of the mind, brutally ripping away the victim’s personhooduntil all is lost, leaving behind a body and spirit disconnected from the brainthat brought them to life. While Alzheimer’s patients in the early to middlestages may have a relatively well preserved long-term memory, still recallingdetails of their wedding day, for example, their short-term memory has beendevastated. As sensory information is coming into the brain with every newexperience, Alzheimer’s patients have difficulties placing the information intocontext and keeping track of it from minute to minute, or in later stages fromsecond to second.The result is the following set of symptoms (see the Alzheimer’s Associationwebsite, www.alz.org [http://www.alz.org], for further elaboration):1. Memory problems that disrupt activities of daily living, especiallyshort-term memory2. Challenges in solving problems, such as mathematical calculations in payingbills3. Difficulty with familiar tasks, such as playing a game or following afavorite recipe4. Confusion with time or place, such as seasons or months, or how to get tocertain places5. Difficulty with reading, driving, or determining distances6. Trouble following or joining conversations, and frequent problems findingwords7. Misplacing things and finding them in odd places, like car keys in the fridge8. Poor judgment or decision making, such as being easily conned bytelemarketers9. Withdrawal from usual activities, such as hobbies or following a local sportsteam10. Becoming suspicious, paranoid, or increasingly anxious or fearful aboutleaving homeIn 1906, Dr. Alois Alzheimer, a German psychiatrist and neuropathologist, firstdescribed the disease in a fifty-five-year-old woman patient, Auguste Deter.Deter had been admitted to a Bavarian asylum called the Irrenschloss (“Castle ofthe Insane”) suffering from what we now recognize as early-onset Alzheimer’s,which strikes before age sixty. In most cases this rare form of the disease(accounting for less than 5 percent of cases) is caused by mutations in threedifferent genes (those encoding for the amyloid precursor protein, presenilin 1,and presenilin 2), all co-discovered in the 1980s and 1990s by my colleagues andme at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. In fact, thesewere the first Alzheimer’s genes to be discovered; they carry over 250 differentgene mutations that virtually guarantee early onset of the disease usually wellbefore sixty years old.We now know that Deter had a mutation in the presenilin 1 gene, the same thatplagued Alice in the popular book and movie Still Alice, written by my Harvardclassmate, neuroscientist Dr. Lisa Genova. In his journal, Dr. Alzheimer wrotethat when he entered her room for the first time, Auguste Deter was sitting onthe side of her bed suffering from memory loss and hallucinations, which becameobvious in his interview with her. Alzheimer also noted that late at night manyresidents and staff were awakened by her anguished cries of “Oh God! I have lostmyself!” That single description perfectly defines this horrible disease: itrobs one of one’s self.Presently Alzheimer’s disease is becoming increasingly and alarmingly moreprevalent, reaching epidemic proportions in the United States and otherdeveloped Western countries. (The epidemic has been nicknamed the “silvertsunami.”) There were nearly 5.5 million Alzheimer’s patients in this country in2016. In 2017, Alzheimer’s and related dementias will cost our health-caresystem an estimated $259 billion, of which Medicare and Medicaid will spend anestimated $175 billion. This means that nearly one in every five Medicaredollars is already spent on Alzheimer’s patients. By the age of eighty-five, onehas a 30 to 40 percent chance of displaying symptoms of Alzheimer’s. As 71million baby boomers head toward high-risk ages, Alzheimer’s has the potentialto single-handedly collapse the entire health-care system.As a rule, all of us slow down mentally as we get older. Sometime after agefifty or sixty we might begin to have problems recalling names and words. We mayalso start to lose track of where we put things or experience “senior moments.”But just because our brain begins to slow down, this doesn’t mean we need topanic. The deficits of aging are compensated for by becoming wiser, gentler,calmer. People would rest easier if they knew that having senior moments is notnecessarily the beginning of Alzheimer’s. Misplacing your keys is fine—that’susually just a sign of being distracted or not paying attention. But, if thekeys were left in your car with the engine running in the garage after gettinghome from doing errands and such absent-minded events happen increasingly, theremight be reason for concern about the health of your brain.However, some experts argue that the underlying cause could be the presence ofsmall amounts of brain pathology that begin with virtually everyone after theage of forty. My colleague, Harvard neurologist Kirk Daffner, put it this way:As many of us get older we may have “a little bit of Alzheimer’s.” It’s likehaving a little bit of arterial plaque around the heart but not necessarilysuffering from congestive heart failure.This may all seem scary, but the good news is that we can handle “a little bitof Alzheimer’s” pathology in the brain without incurring dementia. We call thisresilience, which brings into play the brain’s ability to compensate. Dr. DavidBennett, an Alzheimer’s specialist at Rush University, likens it to “the sidestreets when there’s an accident on the expressway. Everything comes to a deadstop, and so you get off and meander through the side streets. You can still getto your destination.” The journey will take longer, but you get there. Bennettalso takes note of some people who tolerate the Alzheimer’s pathology observedby brain imaging, managing to avoid symptoms of cognitive impairment anddementia. Such people often have “a purpose in life, conscientiousness, socialnetworks, stimulating activities—all these things seem to be protective in termsof how your brain expresses whatever pathology it’s accumulating.”Further understanding the basis of brain resilience to Alzheimer’s despite thepresence of Alzheimer’s damage requires some understanding of the exactpathology that defines this disease. The trilogy of Alzheimer’s pathologyincludes the following:1. Senile plaques, which are large clumps of sticky material called beta-amyloidthat deposit around nerve cells in the brain.2. Tangles, which are twisted filaments that form inside of nerve cells and killthem.3. Neuroinflammation, a response of the brain’s immune system to the plaques,tangles, and dying nerve cells. While intended to help as part of the immunesystem’s healing response, this inflammation winds up killing many more nervecells by “friendly fire.”For decades we didn’t know how these three pathologies link to one another,which causes which, or which comes first. This mystery was largely due to earlyattempts to re-create Alzheimer’s disease pathology and symptoms in mice.Researchers took a human gene mutation that causes early-onset Alzheimer’s torun in families and inserted it into the mice’s genome. The mice got brainplaque but no tangles. This led to twenty years of fiery debate as to whetherplaques cause tangles. All those first Alzheimer’s genes discovered by me andothers indicated that Alzheimer’s started with plaques leading to tangles. Yetthis could not be proved in mouse models of the disease.The debate raged on. Did amyloid plaque actually cause Alzheimer’s? The familialAlzheimer’s genes all pointed to yes, while the mouse studies said no. Theimplications for treating and preventing the disease were enormous. I previouslywrote about this in my 2001 book, Decoding Darkness: The Search for the GeneticCauses of Alzheimer’s Disease. At the time, the argument was anything butresolved. Since then, much more has been learned. I held that we cannot justtrust results from Alzheimer’s mouse models. Humans are not 150-pound mice!Then, in 2014, my Harvard colleague Doo Yeon Kim and I decided to settle theissue once and for all. We invented what a New York Times headline would dub“Alzheimer’s-in-a-Dish,” which involved working out a stem-cell technology togrow mini–human brain organoids (an artificially grown mass of cells or tissues)in mini–human brain dishes. Beforehand we placed early-onset Alzheimer’s genemutations into the artificial brain tissue. Miraculously, the mini-brains in thedish formed actual senile plaques for the first time ever, and in only sixweeks. More important with regard to the ongoing debate, two weeks after theplaques formed, the human nerve cells were filled with toxic tangles. When Dooand I treated the brains with drugs that stopped the plaques, they also stoppedthe tangles.When our study was published in the prestigious scientific journal Nature, noone in the field disagreed. The debate was over. Senile plaques do cause thetoxic tangles that go on to kill nerve cells. The New York Times called thebreakthrough “groundbreaking” and “game-changing.” Now the discovery ofAlzheimer’s drugs could be achieved ten times faster and ten times cheaper thanin mice. (For this discovery Dr. Kim and I were honored in 2015 with thenation’s highest award for innovation and invention, the Smithsonian AmericanIngenuity Award, and I found myself on Time magazine’s list of the “100 MostInfluential People in the World” for 2015.)So, returning to a critical question, what makes a person resilient toAlzheimer’s? One factor is referred to as “cognitive reserve,” which we touchedupon at the beginning of this book (this page[Chop_9780451495532_epub3_c001_r1.xhtml#page_2]). The greater the amount ofknowledge one has amassed and learned, for example through higher education, thegreater the number of synapses in one’s brain. Since the degree of dementia inAlzheimer’s patients correlates most closely with loss of synapses, the moresynapses you have, the more you can lose before problems set in. Thus,continuing to learn new things is very important as we age. When planning foryour retirement, think just as much about your cognitive reserve as about yourfinancial reserve.Perhaps the most critical information on the nature of resilience has come fromsome individuals aged eighty to one hundred who die with no cognitive issues,yet who upon autopsy reveal Alzheimer’s levels of plaques and tangles. What dothese fortunate folks all have in common? In each of these resilient brainsthere’s no evidence of neuroinflammation. Despite abundant plaques, tangles, andnerve-cell death, the brain’s immune systems didn’t react with the inflammationresponse. The result was no Alzheimer’s disease. In 2008, we discovered a newAlzheimer’s gene known by the symbol CD33, which encodes a protein called“siglec-3” on the surface of certain types of immune cells. My colleague AnaGriciuc and I later figured out that this gene is the switch that turns onneuroinflammation. We then found mutations in this gene that could eitherincrease or decrease risk for Alzheimer’s by causing more or lessneuroinflammation in response to the plaques and tangles that show up in thebrain, usually after age forty.As a result of these studies, many pharmaceutical companies are now developingdrug therapies aimed at these genes to curb neuroinflammation. Such a drug wouldbe not only useful for treating Alzheimer’s but also helpful for otherneurological diseases such as Parkinson’s or stroke.When we put all of this information together, we’ve validated that the plaquesare like a match (head injury can also be the match in other forms of dementia,for example, chronic traumatic encephalopathy), while the tangles and nervecells they kill are the brush fire spreading throughout the learning and memoryareas of the brain. But once neuroinflammation kicks in, it’s like a majorforest fire, and this is when the symptoms of catastrophic cognitive decline anddementia set in.Armed with this knowledge, we now realize that we must stop the amyloid plaquesfirst. Brain imaging studies reveal that plaques form ten to twenty years beforesymptoms of dementia arise. This largely explains why so many clinical trialstargeting plaques had failed. They were used on patients who already displayedsymptoms, which was at least ten years too late. It’s akin to someone beingdiagnosed with congestive heart failure after suffering a heart attack and thendeciding to lower their cholesterol levels. Cholesterol would have had to beaddressed a decade earlier. Today, antiplaque therapies are being tried inearly, very mild cases of Alzheimer’s and even in presymptomatic individuals whohave abundant plaques in their brain just starting to initiate the diseaseprocess.I’ve warned that in these treatments we shouldn’t aim at totally wiping out theamyloid plaques. My Australian colleague Rob Moir and I, with financial supportfrom the Cure Alzheimer’s Fund, have discovered that the sticky amyloid plaquesactually help protect the brain from viral and other infections. In fact,viruses, bacteria, and yeast can rapidly seed the formation of plaques. This hassuggested a new theory about the cause of Alzheimer’s, in which the plaques areformed in response to infectious microbes as a natural way to protect the brain.What does the new theory mean for preventing and treating Alzheimer’s? Someday,very early on in life, we may be able to target infections that drive amyloidplaque deposition in the brain. Potentially we could use brain imaging andperhaps blood tests to detect when amyloid plaques are accumulating atalarmingly high levels and then target those plaques with anti-amyloid drugs.Such drugs are currently being tested by pharmaceutical companies and are alsobeing developed in labs like mine at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.Around the same time that we stop plaque buildup in the brain, ten to fifteenyears prior to symptoms, it would be best to also stop the tangles from formingand spreading in response to the plaques. It’s all about treating the rightpatient with the right drug, at the right time. For patients already sufferingwith cognitive symptoms and dementia, neuroinflammation must be curbed. It’s toolate to only target plaques and tangles.Until these drugs come on line, what can we do now in our own daily lives toreduce the risk for Alzheimer’s as we get older? The following recommendationshave been shown to have the most useful effects on risk reduction—you’llrecognize them from our general advice for a healing lifestyle, although theyare more specific here:• Eat a Mediterranean diet. This is a diet rich in fruits, nuts, vegetables,olive oil, minimal or no red meat, and alternative sources of protein (e.g.,fish or, if you’re vegetarian, like me, legumes, tofu, and mycoprotein frommushrooms).• Get seven to eight hours of sleep per night. It is during the deepest stage ofsleep (delta or slow-wave) following dreams (REM sleep) that the brain clearsitself of debris like amyloid plaques. This is also when short-term memories areconsolidated into long-term memories.• Exercise daily. Aim for 8,000 to 10,000 steps per day if you have anelectronic measuring device. Or take a brisk walk for an hour every day. Duringexercise, amyloid plaques are dissolved in the brain, neuroinflammation isturned down, and even new nerve stem cells are born in the area of the brainmost affected by Alzheimer’s, the hippocampus, which is responsible forshort-term memory.• Reduce stress. Managing stress with meditation and other techniques protectsthe brain from harmful neurochemicals like cortisol. In a clinical trial ofmeditation, we also showed changes in gene expression that favor removal ofamyloid from the brain and that lower inflammation. It’s also worth noting thatas people get older, finding that they can’t recall names and words as well,they often become increasingly stressed out, especially if they worry about thebeginnings of Alzheimer’s. Ironically, this stress can lead to cortisolproduction in the brain that kills nerve cells, perhaps increasing risk forAlzheimer’s.• Learn new things. Learning new things forces you to make new synapses in thebrain, enhancing your cognitive reserve. Growing older should include challengeslike learning how to play a musical instrument or taking foreign-languagelessons, but also small things like brushing your teeth with the opposite hand,taking a new commute route, or simply watching a documentary or attending alecture. Because all learning is based on associating new information with whatyou already know, you not only make new synapses but reinforce the ones youalready have. Moreover, this leads to new neural pathways for gaining access toinformation recorded by specific synapses and existing neural pathways. It’sworth mentioning that crossword puzzles and brain games do not serve the samepurpose as learning new things.• Stay socially engaged. Loneliness has been confirmed as a risk factor forAlzheimer’s. Social engagement and participating in positive, supporting socialnetworks have been shown to be protective against a higher risk for Alzheimer’sdisease."},{"pageContent":"SOME OPTIMISTIC THOUGHTS ABOUT CANCERCancer is viewed as a unique kind of threat because of the dread it inspires,but a healing lifestyle is just as pertinent as with heart disease or obesity.Compared with those two conditions, it’s hard to get people to feel optimisticabout cancer. Fear is a powerful force, all the more so when it containsirrationality. To most people’s surprise, cancer is actually moving steadilyinto the realm of hope and optimism.After the federal government declared its “war on cancer” in 1971, only to havehopes for a cure fade away, the public has found itself riding an emotionalroller coaster. There is still a widespread perception, despite the steadydrumbeat that “we’re getting closer every day,” that progress hasn’t been made.This is a massive misperception that reflects the lingering power of fear. Inits 2017 report on cancer rates, the American Cancer Society reported thatoverall cancer deaths declined by 25 percent between a peak in 1991 and 2014,the latest date for statistics. The reasons for this decline, however, are notrelated to an overall cure. That goal has been abandoned over the decades onceit was discovered that cancer behaves not like one disease but like many. Therecent decline has come in bits and pieces. To quote the American CancerSociety’s website, “During the most recent decade of available data, the rate ofnew cancer diagnoses decreased by about 2 percent per year in men and stayedabout the same in women. The cancer death rate declined by about 1.5 percentannually in both men and women.”Projecting forward, the bottom-line statistic for 2017 was that roughly 1.7million new cancer diagnoses would be made and 600,000 deaths would beattributed to cancer. In simplest terms, only 1 out of 3 patients wouldeventually die from their diagnosis. That’s a good baseline for optimism.For a long time patients feared cancer treatments as much as the disease itself.In the early days of modern cancer therapy, the basic fact that oncology clungto was that cancer cells multiply much faster than normal cells. Therefore, theapplication of drugs that were toxic to the entire body would hit cancer cellsharder. (One of the first forms of chemotherapy was deadly mustard gas,notorious from World War I.) By this logic, if you wanted to kill every scrap ofmalignancy, it was justified to put patients through severe suffering in anattempt to kill the cancer even if it meant that a certain proportion ofpatients would be killed first. Today’s therapies are much more preciselytargeted and safer. More important, they proceed with a new logic in mind,aiming at the genetic foundation of the disease.Just as important, however, was a dramatic change in attitude. Consider a 2015article in The Lancet that begins with a sentence that would have shocked andbaffled the cancer field a generation ago: “The nature of cancer control ischanging, with an increasing emphasis, fueled by public and political demand, onprevention, early diagnosis, and patient experience during and after treatment.”If you unpack this sentence, it says several important things:• Prevention is beginning to spearhead the overall approach doctors will take tocancer in the future.• Cancer is a controllable disease, not always calling for drastic treatment,particularly in older patients with slow-growing cancers such as prostate cancerin its early stages.• The public fear over cancer is being paid attention to. There are promises ofless arduous treatments, and a handful exist.LOOKING DEEPERThis new attitude toward cancer is a very good sign, but caution is stillwarranted. Official progress proceeds by small increments. The typical trial fora new cancer drug helps only 3 to 5 percent of participants. And historicallythe promises about lowering cancer deaths stalled. The toll taken by the diseaseis known through two measures: first, the number of people diagnosed with cancereach year, and second, the age at which they die. It’s the second number thatmost people overlook. They think in terms of five-year survival, the most commonstatistic for remissions, which has limited validity.Early detection is a great boon that former generations didn’t have. But it canalso increase the survival rate artificially. A woman diagnosed with breastcancer in the 1930s would most likely have been in a more advanced stage of thedisease than a woman diagnosed today. Let’s say in the 1930s that a woman’sdoctor detected a suspicious lump when she was fifty-five and she died atfifty-seven after unsuccessful treatment. (Back then, a radical mastectomy wasthe only viable course of action in this country, since chemotherapy andradiation were still in the future.)Today, anomalous or malignant breast cells can be detected much earlier, oftenat stage 1 of the disease if not before. Then it would be typical for thediagnosis to come when the woman is forty-eight, for example, instead offifty-five. She could survive nine years, which would put her in the five-yearsurvival category, and yet still die at fifty-seven—a different route leading tothe same outcome.This is why the adjusted age of mortality—the average age at which people diewho have been diagnosed with cancer—is the key figure. That age needs toincrease if we are to claim a real advance in cancer survival. For decades itdidn’t go up. If you look at the broad picture, cancer deaths have decreased,although not enough, because of interlocking factors:• Early detection is a boon but can also go too far. The standard test reliedupon for detecting prostate cancer, the PSA blood test, led to overtreatment ina cancer known to progress for years or decades without becoming lethal. It waseventually decided that the risk of harming patients through surgery andradiation was actually greater than the projected lives being saved throughregular PSA testing (along with false positives from the test).• A steady decline in smoking has cut into the rates for lung cancer.• Targeted treatments have become more effective.• Fewer patients are dying from massive assaults with chemotherapy and radiationthan in the past.• Genetic scanning has made possible new drugs that specifically target thegenetic source of cancer, but to date these drugs have been hugely expensive(tens of thousands of dollars per treatment), and few cancers are linked to asingle genetic mistake. One exception is a specific form of childhood leukemia,once nearly always fatal but now enjoying a recovery rate over 90 percent (withthe serious caveat that the recovered patients run into serious health problemsin their twenties).Yet the main reason for optimism has switched from treatment to prevention. Thisis a turnaround unforeseen even a decade ago, when hope was overwhelminglyplaced on more funding for basic research and new drug treatments. It is nowgenerally agreed that up to 50 percent of cancer cases are preventable usingalready existing knowledge. Everyday lifestyle choices are the main thrust ofcancer prevention, which includes not smoking; eating a natural whole-foodsdiet; avoiding carcinogens in your food, air, and water; taking half an aspirinper day; and wearing sunscreen.Most people already knew about taking aspirin to reduce the risk of heartattacks and strokes, and so the benefit for cancer is an add-on, not a panacea.In-depth data gathered from a thirty-year study following 130,000 people foundthat those who regularly took at least two adult aspirin a week had a decreasein gastrointestinal cancer of 20 percent and in colorectal cancer of 25 percent.(Other studies have corroborated the usefulness of aspirin as a cancerprevention measure, but also to decrease the risk of metastases after a tumorhas appeared.)The reason aspirin is effective in these cancers seems to be itsanti-inflammatory effect. One indirect proof of how damaging inflammation is wasstaring us in the face, when you think of what aspirin is good for: coldsymptoms, pain, and as a preventive of heart attacks. All are linked to itsanti-inflammatory action.The prevention measures relating to sunscreen and not smoking are targetedspecifically at skin cancer and lung cancer. But the best news is that positivelifestyle choices which apply generally, such as maintaining a good weight,avoiding alcohol or keeping consumption to a minimum, and leading an activelife, are beneficial for cancer—in other words, a healing lifestyle is abroad-spectrum approach. There is nothing you need to do to add an extra layerof cancer protection, because so far as the most up-to-date studies show, nosuch extra protection exists.This will come as a disappointment to anyone who tries to lower their anxietyover cancer by resorting to specific supplements, so-called cancer diets, andmagical foods that supposedly prevent the disease. One new trend, however, is tolink the early formation of cancer with chronic inflammation. To the best of ourknowledge, the diet we offer in Part Two of this book comes as close as possibleto being an anti-cancer diet as well.MANAGING CANCER, BEFORE AND AFTERFinally, there is optimism over cancer being a manageable disease. This is amajor change in attitude that is slowly seeping into the medical community.Cancer has always been a desperate “do something, anything” proposition foroncologists as well as patients. The image of an insidious enemy attacking thebody from within has motivated immediate, often drastic action. But being amultifaceted disease, not all cancers are created alike. Some are slow-growing,for example. If you consult the five-year survival rate for the seven types ofbrain tumor, for example, they range from 17 percent for glioblastoma, a deadlyaggressive form, to 92 percent for meningiomas, which tend to be benign and soslow-growing that the brain can often adapt to their presence. (Thyroid andbladder cancers also fall into the range of slow, manageable cancers.)How to manage a cancer depends on the oncologist, and they vary widely in theirapproach to immediacy of treatment. Consulting more than one is advisable, andit’s important to question them about their attitude toward manageability. Inany event, there are many factors that affect cancer rates and recovery. Yourrisk lowers if you are young, white, well-off, and get early detection. You areat higher risk if you are non-white, older, poor, and get delayed detection.(For example, the quoted survival rates for brain tumors applied to the agegroup twenty to forty-four. For patients fifty-five to sixty-four, the ratesworsen, going down to 4 percent for glioblastoma and 67 percent formeningiomas.)This brings us to an issue that seems self-contradictory, managing cancer beforeyou are ever diagnosed. If you take vitamin C or zinc to ward off a winter cold,you are practicing prevention; it would seem strange to say that you aremanaging a cold when you don’t even have one. But with cancer, the knownmeasures for prevention don’t tell the whole story. There is an X factor tocontend with, and this X factor must be managed, year in and year out.We are referring to self-induced stress and fear. Modern society is inundatedwith medical stress, thanks to constant repetition of stories about risks,studies, tragic deaths, and miraculous recoveries. None of this is morestressful than the news about cancer. Stress cannot be prevented when it is sopervasive, all the worse because you never know when cancer will strike close tohome among friends and family. The simplest advice is this: Stress management iscancer management. That holds true for both healthy people, patients who havejust been diagnosed, and cancer survivors.It has become standard post-treatment advice to tell anyone recovering fromcancer to seek loving support from family and friends, to which outside supportgroups should be added. Cancer is an isolating disease. The side effects ofchemo and radiation, particularly hair loss and the wasting of muscle tissue,tend to make people want to be alone even more. (The present generation ofcancer patients is fortunate that the disease isn’t greeted with nearly the samefear it created in the past.)The reason why managing the emotional stress of cancer is effective remainsvague—that’s why we refer to it as the X factor. But we strongly suspect thatthe answer will be epigenetic. As explained on this page[Chop_9780451495532_epub3_c011_r1.xhtml#page_163], epigenetics deals with thechange to DNA made by everyday experiences. The stronger the experience, themore marks are likely to be imprinted on a person’s epigenome, leading tochanges in gene activity, since the epigenome, which wraps around DNA like aprotective sheath, is believed to be the main switch for gene activity.Proving that bad experiences may influence the development of cancer in itsearly stages is fraught with danger, and may increase stress rather thanalleviate it. But there is no danger in associating positive experiences withreduced stress. Besides boosting survival rates, pursuing stress management—andspecifically working on your underlying fear of cancer—is important long beforeany sign of disease appears. By acquainting yourself with the optimistic newsabout cancer, you can take a big step to reducing your level of anxiety.Removing the irrational aspect of our attitude toward this disease might resultin the turning point everyone has desired for so long."},{"pageContent":"ACKNOWLEDGMENTSWhen a book is being created, it needs as much parenting as editing, so we aregrateful for the considerate understanding and nurturing of our editor, GaryJansen.
