For example, if you mark a 6 for the first question, a 3 for the second, and a 2 for the third, your total up to that point would be 6+3+2 = 11.

Proceed to the 20 questions for Pitta and those for Kapha.When you are finished, you will have three separate scores. Comparing these will determine your body type.

Most indicative is a score where the primary dosha is twice as high as the second (for example, Vata-90, Pitta-45, Kapha-35), but smaller margins also count. A true single-dosha type displays the traits of Vata, Pitta, or Kapha very prominently . Your next highest dosha will still show some influence in your natural tendencies but to a much lesser degree. Two-Dosha Types: Vata-Pitta or Pitta-V ata Pitta-Kapha or Kapha-Pitta Kapha-V ata or Vata-Kapha If no dosha is extremely dominant, you are a two-dosha type. This means that you display qualities of your two leading doshas, either side by side or in alternation. The important thing is not to fit a categor y but to lear n about yourself. As you gain mor e understanding of the Ayurvedic system, and your own unique body type, you will be able to make dramatic improvements in your health.

Vata Vata dosha is notably: Cold, leading to cold hands and feet, dislike of cold climates. Moving, giving good or bad circulation, depending on how well balanced this dosha is — hyper tension is related to excess Vata, as are irr egular hear t rhythms, muscle spasms, and backaches. A nervous, darting glance is a sign of imbalanced Vata. Quick, leading to many related characteristics: ability to pick up new information quickly , which is also quickly for gotten; poor long-ter m memor y; good imagination but frightening dreams; restless activity; acting on impulse; mood swings; racing, scatter ed thoughts; and fast speech. Dry , leading to dry skin, dry or dull hair , dull eyes, and scant or moderate sweat. Skin may chap or crack easily and be subject to psoriasis or eczema. Rough, leading to rough skin and coarse-textured hair . Pitta Pitta dosha is notably: Hot , leading to war m, flushed skin, any kind of inflammation, to overactive metabolism, hot sensations in stomach, liver , intestines, and so on. Pittas are usually fond of cold foods and drinks, which offset their own heat. Sharp , leading to a sharp mind but also sharp speech; the same quality can turn into excess acidity in the body and oversecretion of stomach acids. Moist , which may show up as profuse perspiration — hot, sweaty palms are typically Pitta. Being hot and moist give Pittas an aversion to humid summer weather . Sour -smelling, giving rise to bad breath, sour body odor , or bad-smelling urine and feces if excess Pitta is present. Kapha Kapha dosha is notably: Heavy , any heavy disorder suggests Kapha imbalance, whether it is obesity , heavy digestion, or a heavy , oppressive kind of depression. Sweet , leading to weight gain or diabetes if too much sweetness is added to the body . Steady , which makes Kapha types self-contained. Bodily processes do not swing to extr emes; Kapha’ s steady nature also has to do with not needing outside stimulation as much as Pitta or Vata. Their bodies remain unaffected by changes that would thr ow other bodies out of balance. Soft , leading to a wide variety of characteristics, such as soft skin and hair , soft manners, a soft look in the eyes, and an undemanding approach to situations. Slow , as expressed in the typically slow , fluid movements of Kapha people, along with slow speech and deliberate thinking.

If you show signs of Vata imbalance, these pointers will help you reshape your daily routine to make it more congenial to Vata dosha: • Get plenty of rest — this is all-impor tant for any Vata problem. • Stay warm — being a cold dosha, Vata benefits from heat. • Eat a Vata-pacifying diet. (See body-type diets.) Eat regularly . • Drink lots of warm fluids during the day to prevent dehydration. • Avoid very cold foods and drinks. • Massage your body with sesame oil in the morning. • Take a long, war m bath or shower in the mor ning. • Avoid mental strain and overstimulating yourself. • Make your surroundings light and bright. Vata responds well to sunlight and cheerful colors. • Do not drink alcohol while you are trying to balance Vata, which resents stimulants of any kind, including coffee, tea, and nicotine.

If you show signs of Pitta imbalance, the following pointers will help balance your daily routine and make it more congenial to Pitta dosha: • Take time to wind down from activity — alternating rest and activities is the basic rhythm of life. • Coolness in any form helps to counteract overactive Pitta. Keep your bedroom just below 70 degrees when you sleep and don’ t linger in a hot bath too long; too much moist heat can make you feel dizzy or nauseated when Pitta is out of balance. • Eat a Pitta-pacifying diet. It’s important not to overeat, which Pittas tend to do if they push their excellent digestion too hard. Rather than going to extremes, eat moderate meals at regular hours three times a day . • If you find that you have a runaway appetite, do not try to force yourself to eat less. Instead, take gradually smaller meals, starting with about three-quar ters of what you nor mally eat. Consume this amount for a day or two, then cut back to half of your normal consumption. Now you should be at a comfortable level of intake. • Avoid artificial stimulants, all of which raise Pitta. Alcohol in any for m is like throwing ker osene on the Pitta fire. The caffeine in cof fee and tea is also not recommended. • Be attentive to taking in only pure food, water , and air, since Pitta is especially sensitive to impurities of any kind. • Avoid strenuous physical exertion or overheating yourself outdoors. • Make sure to go outdoors as much as possible.

Kapha is the only dosha strongly identified with a taste — sweetness. Irrespective of calories, Kaphas will gain weight and go out of balance if there is too much sweet food in the diet. • Stay warm. Kapha benefits from heat. • Avoid dampness. • Perform a dry massage on your body to stimulate circulation. • Drink war m fluids during the day , but take them in moderation. • Exercise regularly , preferably every day . • Be honest with yourself when you are sick and you need to recuperate.

Fulfillment of desire requires that we first be and then simply have the notion (the idea, the desire). That’ s all! This is the mechanics of creation.
