Their requests took many forms, but they echoed a single theme: “Asmuch as I have benefited from living these spiritual laws, I wish I had learnedthem years ago. The value of such principles as giving, having no resistance,and trusting in the universe to fulfill my desires seems obvious now, but itwasn’t at first. It was a struggle to break the destructive habits that I grewup with. As a parent I don’t want my own children to learn the same bad habitsand later have to go through the same pain of having to change. How can I makesure that doesn’t happen?”I wrote this new book to answer these requests, extending The Seven SpiritualLaws specifically to parents. It will show anyone who wants to interpret thespiritual laws for children how to do that in terms a child can understand andapply. My approach here is founded on the belief that every parent needs toolsto raise children with a true understanding of the workings of Nature andconsciousness.Everyone in the world wants something; everyone in the world has desires.Children need to know, from the beginning, that desire is the most basic drivein human nature. It is the energy of the spirit. When we grow up and seekanswers to profound questions or set out to solve immensely challenging issuesin our personal lives, what we work with is the same natural desire that made uscurious children, nothing more. The seeker is the child who has gone fromneeding a parent’s love to needing God’s, from wanting toys to wanting infinitecreativity. In this book I will try to show parents how their children can bestfulfill their desires and successfully attain what they want in life. And I willdo my best to explain spiritual concepts so that a child can understand them.But this is not simply a book aimed at children, since what children need toknow is only a modified form of what adults need to know as well.With all its worship of material success, society has missed a profound truth:success depends on who you are, not what you do. Being or essence or spirit—callit by any name you want—lies at the source of all achievement in life. But Beingis very abstract, so people see it more as an idea than as something real anduseful. Nevertheless, if we examine the oldest traditions of human wisdom, wefind certain fixed, knowable, reliable principles by which spirit unfolds frometernal Being into everyday life.Some people may have difficulty understanding how spiritual laws could be ofsuch value in daily life yet remain in obscurity for so many centuries. Byanalogy, electricity did not enter general awareness before the lightbulb,despite the fact that the entire universe has been permeated with electricalenergy since the dawn of creation. Being or spirit or essence is invisible, too,yet it affects daily life in a tremendous way. The invisible intelligence behindthe visible universe operates through Seven Spiritual Laws. Again by analogy, ifthe laws of electricity hadn’t been discovered, the practical applications ofelectricity would never have been available to us.Now more than ever, in this age of violence and confusion, there is an urgentneed for parents to take on the role of spiritual teachers to their children.The laws behind Nature’s working are not private. They apply to everyone andeverything. Therefore, understanding these laws is not just a way to help a fewpeople; it is vital for our society and even for our civilization. If a criticalmass of our children are raised to practice the Seven Spiritual Laws, our wholecivilization will be transformed. Love and compassion, which are so oftentrivialized these days, can become the natural breath and life of everyone’sexistence. We owe it to the world, I believe, to ensure that as many children aspossible grow up knowing what spiritual reality is.Spirit has always been elusive. An ancient Indian scripture informs us that aknife cannot cut It, water cannot wet It, wind cannot blow It away, the suncannot dry It up. Every molecule in the universe is permeated with Being; everythought you have, every bit of information that reaches you through your fivesenses is nothing but Being. But Being can be overlooked, since it is completelysilent, like a master choreographer that never joins the dance. In Being we areall upheld; we take our very breath and life from it, yet it is something ourown parents taught us little about.We can all be forgiven our lack of knowledge about spirit, and we can teachourselves the Seven Spiritual Laws with the same enthusiasm as we teach ourchildren. More than anything else, this has been the guiding ideal behind thisbook."},{"pageContent":"PART ONEPARENTING AND THE GIFT OF SPIRITImage Missing [../images/title.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"AFTER ALL, WHAT IS GOD? AN ETERNAL CHILD PLAYING AN ETERNAL GAME IN THE ETERNALGARDEN.SRI AUROBINDOTHE DEEPEST DESIRE in a parent’s heart is to see one’s child achieve success inlife, yet how many of us realize that the most direct way to success is throughspirit? In our society we don’t usually make that connection—quite the opposite.We teach our children how to survive, how to behave in order to earn ourapproval, how to defend themselves, how to compete, how to persist againstdisappointment, obstacles, and setbacks. Although believing in God is oftenconsidered a good thing, spirit has traditionally been set apart from success indaily life. This is a mistake, and it has had a profound effect on all ourlives, from childhood on.Many people assume without question that success is essentially material, thatit can be measured in money, prestige, or an abundance of possessions. These cancertainly play a role, but having such things is no guarantee of success. Thesuccess we want our children to achieve has to be defined in many nonmaterialways as well. It should include the ability to love and have compassion, thecapacity to feel joy and spread it to others, the security of knowing that one’slife serves a purpose, and finally, a sense of connection to the creative powerof the universe. All of these constitute the spiritual dimension of success, thedimension that brings inner fulfillment.If the meaning of your life unfolds to you every day, in simplicity and wonder,you have achieved success—which means, in a profound way, that every baby isborn a success. Every child’s ability to feel wonder in the face of everydayexistence is the surest proof we have that Nature wants us to be successful. Itis in our own nature to respond to life with joy. The seeds of God are insideus. When we make the journey of spirit, we water these divine seeds. The goodlife merely reflects our inner intention. In time the flowers of God bloomwithin and around us, and we begin to witness and know the miracle of the divinewherever we go.Our responsibility as parents is therefore to place our children firmly on thejourney of spirit. This is the best thing we can do to ensure their success inlife, better than giving them money, a secure home, or even love and affection.I ask you to consider this spiritual notion of parenting, different though itmay be from how you see your role now.To bring about this new way of parenting we need practical principles to teachour children. The principles I have in mind were introduced in my earlier bookas the Seven Spiritual Laws of Success. In order to bring about a connectionwith spirit, a knowledge of spiritual law is essential. When we practicespiritual laws, we put ourselves in harmony with Nature. Any other way of livingleads to strain and struggle. Success achieved on the basis of struggle maybring good things to us, but the inner fulfillment we seek from these thingswill be lacking.In adult language the Seven Spiritual Laws are stated as follows:FIRST LAW: The Law of Pure Potentiality The source of all creation is pureconsciousness . . . pure potentiality seeking expression from the unmanifest tothe manifest.SECOND LAW: The Law of Giving In our willingness to give that which we seek, wekeep the abundance of the universe circulating in our lives.THIRD LAW: The Law of “Karma” When we choose actions that bring happiness andsuccess to others, the fruit of our karma is happiness and success.FOURTH LAW: The Law of Least Effort Nature’s intelligence functions witheffortless ease . . . with carefreeness, harmony, and love. When we harnessthese forces, we create success with the same effortless ease.FIFTH LAW: The Law of Intention and DesireInherent in every intention and desire is the mechanics for theirfulfillment . . . in the field of pure potentiality, intention and desire haveinfinite organizing power.SIXTH LAW: The Law of DetachmentIn our willingness to step into the unknown, the field of all possibilities, wesurrender ourselves to the creative mind that orchestrates the dance of theuniverse.SEVENTH LAW: The Law of “Dharma”When we blend our unique talent with service to others, we experience theecstasy and exultation of our own spirit, which is the ultimate goal of allgoals.Whether you call these “laws” or “principles” is not important. They are lawsinasmuch as they govern the unfolding of spirit as it moves from the invisibleworld of the soul to the visible world of matter. They are principles inasmuchas we can take them to heart and apply them the same way we would apply aprinciple like telling the truth or being fair.Why do we need such principles? Why not simply teach our children to love Godand be good?The answer is that the Seven Spiritual Laws put a person in touch with themechanics of Nature. When you consciously align your life with spiritual law,you are asking the universe to support you with success and abundance. This isthe key to becoming aware of your own Being and using its infinite power. Theearlier someone is taught how to live in the most effortless, harmonious, andcreative way, the more likely it is that all of life will bring success. This iswhat we are asked to pass on to our children, and if we can do it, nothingbrings more joy and pride.Every spiritual tradition contains some version of these seven laws, but theyemerge in their purest form from the ancient Vedic tradition of India, whicharticulated them more than five thousand years ago. The Seven Spiritual Lawsserve one vision, as follows:Human beings are made of body, mind, and spirit. Of these, spirit is primary,for it connects us to the source of everything, the eternal field ofconsciousness. The more connected we are, the more we will enjoy the abundanceof the universe, which has been organized to fulfill our wishes and desires.Only in a state of disconnection do we suffer and struggle. The divine intentionis for every human being to enjoy unlimited success.Success, therefore, is supremely natural.CHILDREN AND SPIRIT—THE TEACHING OF INNOCENCEThe language of the Seven Spiritual Laws has to be different when spoken to achild, less abstract. Fortunately, the same laws can be phrased so that even ayoung child is able to carry them around in mind and heart:FIRST LAW:Everything is possible.SECOND LAW:If you want to get something, give it.THIRD LAW:When you make a choice, you change the future.FOURTH LAW:Don’t say no—go with the flow.FIFTH LAW:Every time you wish or want, you plant a seed.SIXTH LAW:Enjoy the journey.SEVENTH LAW:You are here for a reason.On the day I wrote down these simple sayings, I didn’t pause to think about themmuch, but afterward it hit me: if I had been taught just these seven sentencesas a child, my life would have been profoundly different. I would have knownsomething precious and practical at the same time, something that would not havefaded as a childhood lesson but would have ripened into mature spiritualunderstanding year by year.A child raised with spiritual skills will be able to answer the most basicquestions about how the universe works; she will understand the source ofcreativity both within and outside herself; she will be able to practicenonjudgment, acceptance, and truth, which are the most valuable skills anyonecan possess for dealing with other people; and she will be free from thecrippling fear and anxiety about the meaning of life that is the secret dry rotinside the hearts of most adults, whether they can admit it or not.The deepest nurturing you can give your child is spiritual nurturing.I am not talking about forcing hard-and-fast rules on your children, the way weteach them to be good or risk being punished. Each of the Seven Spiritual Lawsshould be conveyed not as a rule or rigid precept but as your own way of lookingat life. As a parent, you will teach much more effectively by who you are, notwhat you say. This itself is part of the spiritual perspective.Every child has a spiritual life already. This is because every child is borninto the field of infinite creativity and pure awareness that is spirit. But notevery child knows that this is true. Spirit must be cultivated; it must benourished and encouraged. If it is, then a child’s innocent spirit grows up tobe strong enough to withstand the harsh realities of an often unspiritual world.Losing touch with spirit does nothing to the infinite field of creativity, whichis beyond harm, but it can do much to damage a person’s chances in life. Withspirit we are all children of the cosmos; without it we are orphaned and setadrift.Let’s take an example. The Seventh Law says, “You are here for a reason.” Achild’s reason for being here can be put in simple, everyday terms, such asHow did I make a difference today?What talent did I uncover?What came to me—a gift, a lesson, a beautiful experience—that made me feelspecial?What did I do to make someone else feel special?These are all simple variations on the basic question Why am I here? We allasked that question as children and only quit asking it because we felt that ourparents and teachers didn’t really have an answer.A child who has not learned to look for meaning in simple ways will one day haveto try to find a purpose in life under much more difficult circumstances.Usually we postpone the search until our late teens or early twenties, sometimesnot until midlife, unfortunately the most turbulent stages of personaldevelopment. “The meaning of life” gets confused with rebellion and the rollercoaster of emotions that are typical of late adolescence, or the growingawareness of mortality that comes in midlife. In school we grapple with theideas of the great religious teachers and philosophers. The debate over whetherexistence even has a meaning engulfs us. (I think anyone who lived through thesixties can painfully identify with all these phases of struggle.)However, a child who was taught from the age of three or four “You are here fora reason” would face a very different future. Such a child would see the searchfor meaning in life as a natural thing, the spiritual equivalent of learningyour ABCs. There would be no years of postponement, followed by desperate innerturmoil. “Why am I here?” doesn’t have to be a fearsome existential question. Itis the most joyful exploration a person can undertake, and we do our children animmense favor by presenting it as such. A child who paid attention to just thisone principle would have a far richer life—a more successful life—than countlessadults for whom “spirit” and “God” remain forever locked in a world ofabstraction.Real spiritual growth changes a person in a paradoxical way. It bringsunderstanding at the same time as it preserves innocence. As parents we aresorely tempted to distance ourselves from childhood. We do this by seeming toknow more about life, when in fact we have usually just experienced more. Wehave gotten good at knowing the rules and avoiding punishment, at hiding ourweakness with a show of strength, at never letting slip the mask ofinvulnerability. There is no better recipe for destroying a child’s innocencethan to destroy our own.In the eyes of spirit, everyone is innocent, in all senses of the word. Becauseyou are innocent, you have not done anything that merits punishment or divinewrath. You are new-made every day. You are a receptor for experience that neverceases to inspire delight and wonder There is only one spiritual differencebetween the innocence of children and the innocence of grown-ups: we grown-upsare innocent with understanding—and that is what we are meant to impart, whileretaining the pure, fresh, pristine quality that comes with true knowledge.HOW TO STARTFrom the day your baby is born, you are a teacher of spirit. If you create anatmosphere of trust, openness, non-judgment, and acceptance, those qualitieswill be absorbed as the qualities of spirit.In a perfect world, parenting would come down to one sentence: Show only love,be only love. But in the world we all cope with, children grow up to face muchnon-loving behavior, primarily outside the home but sometimes within it as well.Rather than worry about whether you embody enough love to qualify as a spiritualteacher, look upon spirituality as a skill in living, since that is what it is.I believe in imparting these skills as early as possible by whatever means achild can understand.INFANT, 0–1 YR.KEY WORDS: LOVE, AFFECTION, ATTENTIONFortunately for our generation, the misconception that children need to betrained and disciplined from the cradle has been discarded. An infant is purespiritual gold. Cherishing her innocence is the way to find the path back to ourown. So in a very important way it is the parent who sits at the feet of thebaby. Spiritual bonding with your infant comes through touching, holding,providing security from harm, playing, and giving attention. Without these“primitive” responses from the environment, the human organism cannot flourish;it will languish and wither as surely as a flower deprived of sunlight.TODDLER, 1–2 YRS.KEY WORDS: FREEDOM, ENCOURAGEMENT, RESPECTThis is the stage in which the child is first gaining ego. Here I mean ego inthe simplest sense of “self,” a conviction of “I am.” This is a precarious time,for the toddler is testing detachment from the parent for the first time. Thelure of freedom and curiosity pulls in one direction, but there is fear andinsecurity pulling in the other Not all experiences of being on one’s own arepleasant. It is therefore up to the parent to communicate a spiritual lessonwithout which no child can truly grow into independent selfhood: that the worldis safe.Feeling safe as an adult means that some time before the age of two, you werenot conditioned by fear; you were encouraged instead to expand without limit, tovalue freedom despite the occasional wound that can come when a child bumps intothe things of this world. Falling down is not the same as failing; being hurt isnot the same as deciding that the world is dangerous. Hurting is nothing morethan Nature’s way of telling a child where the boundaries lie—pain exists toshow a toddler where “me” begins and ends, to help a child avoid potentialdangers like burning oneself or falling downstairs.When parents distort this natural learning process, the result is a sense ofpsychological pain, which is not what Nature intended. Psychological pain setsup boundaries that you cannot cross without feeling deep anxiety about yourstate of being. If a child connects being hurt with being bad, weak, unable tocope, or constantly surrounded by threat, there is no room left for innerspiritual growth. For without a sense of safety, spirit remains out of reach;one is forever trying simply to feel secure in this world, yet that securitycannot be achieved without overcoming the imprints of early childhood.PRESCHOOL, 2–5 YRS.KEY WORDS: DESERVING, EXPLORING, APPROVING,This stage is all about building a child’s sense of self-esteem. Self-esteemprovides readiness to go outside the family to encounter the big, wide world. Itis identified with tasks and challenges. Until the age of two or three, atoddler has no responsibility for tasks—simply to play and be joyous is enough.There is no spiritual need for anything but to nurture the delight of thechild’s self as it unfolds to a fresh, new world.With toilet training and learning to feed himself, a toddler begins to realizethat “I am” can expand to “I can.” Once the ego realizes this, there is nostopping a two-year-old. He thinks he has the whole world—and certainly everyonein his family—by the tail. “I” is like a power generator just plugged in, andwhat makes the twos terrible is that the newly born ego surges with power in anundisciplined way. Shouting, screaming, running around, wielding theall-powerful word no! and generally trying to rule reality by sheer will—this isexactly what should be going on at this stage.Spiritually, the value of the preschool stage is that power is spiritual—onlythe distortion of power leads to problems. So rather than try to curb yourchild’s rush to power, you need to channel it into tasks and challenges thatteach balance. Without being put into balance, the power hunger of a preschoolerwill run into grief, because her experience is largely the illusion of power. Aranting two-year-old is still a very tiny, vulnerable, unformed person. In ourlove for the child, we allow the illusion to exist, because we want her to growup a strong, capable person who feels up to any challenge that comes along. Thissense of self-esteem won’t develop if the feeling of being powerful is shut downor repressed at this stage.KINDERGARTEN – EARLY PRIMARY SCHOOL, 5–8 YRS.KEY WORDS: GIVING, SHARING, NON-JUDGMENT, ACCEPTANCE, TRUTHThe key words that apply to the first years of school begin to sound moresocial. Of course there are many other words, for once a child has beenexperiencing the world for five years, the brain is so complex and active thatcountless concepts are being absorbed and tested. I also don’t mean to implythat sharing, giving, and telling the truth can be ignored before this age, butthe critical aspect of this stage is that abstract concepts can now begin to beassimilated. The concrete mind of the infant, which has not understood reasonsfor your behavior, only how it feels, now blossoms into a capacity for acceptingrealities beyond “I am,” “I want,” and “I come first.”Giving is how, at any age, we show that we empathize with needs outsideourselves. If giving is seen as loss—I have to give something up so that you canhave it—the spiritual lesson of this stage has not been taught. Giving, inspiritual terms, means “I give to you without loss because you are part of me.”A young child cannot fully grasp this idea, but he can feel it. Children don’tjust want to share—they love to share. They feel the warmth that comes fromreaching beyond ego boundaries to include another person in their world; no actis more intimate, and therefore no act feels so blissful.The same holds for telling the truth. We lie in order to remain safe, to avertdanger of punishment. Fear of punishment implies inner tension, and even if alie actually does protect us from perceived danger, it rarely if ever relievesthis inner tension. Only the truth can do that. When a young child is taughtthat telling the truth will result in a good feeling, she has taken the firststep toward realizing that truth has a spiritual quality. It isn’t necessary touse punishment. If you foster the attitude of “tell the truth or you’ll be introuble,” you have taught something spiritually false. A child who is tempted tolie is under the influence of fear; if truth gets associated with this fear,then the mind quite logically tries to get better at seeming to tell the truth.In either case, the child is forced to act better than he feels he actually is.Learning to act out what others demand is a sure recipe for spiritualdestruction. Your child must feel that “this is what I myself want to do.”OLDER CHILDREN, 8–12 YRS.KEY WORDS: INDEPENDENT JUDGMENT, DISCRIMINATION, INSIGHTFor many parents this stage is the most enjoyable because this is when childrendevelop personality and independence. They think on their own, come up withhobbies, likes and dislikes, enthusiasms—the rush of discovery is on itstrajectory to things that may last for life, such as a love of science or art.The key spiritual concepts here are all in line with this exciting phase.Although it sounds dry, “discrimination” is a beautiful quality of the soul. Itgoes far beyond telling right from wrong. In these years the nervous systemitself is capable of sustaining subtle impressions of great depth and importanceto the future. A ten-year-old child is capable of wisdom, and for the first timethat most delicate of gifts—personal insight—comes about. The child can see andjudge through her own eyes; she no longer has to receive the world secondhandfrom adults.This is therefore the first stage in which anything like a spiritual law can begrasped conceptually. Before this, the idea of a law just seems like a rule youhave to obey or at least pay attention to. Instead of using the word law, aparent might be conveying helpful insights into “how things work” or “why thingsturn out the way they do” or “how to do it so it feels good.” These are moreconcrete, experience-centered ways of teaching. By age ten or so, however,abstract reasoning takes an independent turn, and the true teacher is nowexperience, not an authority figure. Why this happens is a spiritual mystery,for experience has been there since birth, but for some reason the worldsuddenly speaks to a child; she can grasp the upwelling within herself of whysomething is true or not, why truth and love matter.EARLY TEENS, 12–15 YRS.KEY WORDS: SELF-AWARENESS, EXPERIMENTATION, RESPONSIBILITYChildhood ends with early adolescence, traditionally a trying and difficulttime. For children, innocence suddenly runs into puberty and the arrival ofneeds that parents can no longer fill. For parents, the realization dawns thatthey must let go of their children and trust that they are capable of dealingwith a world of responsibility and pressure that the parents themselves may havebarely learned to adjust to without insecurity.What is critical is that by now the lessons of childhood have borne either sweetor bitter fruit. The child who can go forth imprinted with genuine spiritualknowledge will reflect her parents’ pride and trust; the child who stumbles intoconfusion, reckless experimentation, and peer pressure is likewise reflectingthe hidden confusion of his upbringing. Adolescence is notoriously a time ofself-consciousness, but it can also be a time of self-awareness.Experimentation is a natural part of the transition from childhood, but itdoesn’t have to be reckless and destructive. Now the issue is whether the childhas an inner self that can be used as a guide. This inner self is the silentvoice that has the power to choose between right and wrong based upon a deepknowingness about life. This knowingness is not confined to any age. A newbornbaby has it as fully as a mature adult. The difference is that the mature adulthas cultivated behavior that follows the inner guide—if you have taught yourchild to heed her own silence, there is no peril in letting her go out into theworld no longer a child. In fact, it is a joyful experience (if occasionally anerve-racking one) to watch her grow in self-awareness by experimenting with thevast array of choices life has to offer.TEACHING RIGHT FROM WRONGBecause we have all grown up in a society that places so little real value onspiritual life, it can be confusing to consider what being a spiritual teacherto your child means. How does this differ, for instance, from merely being agood, loving parent? To demonstrate, let’s take a crucial issue that arises withall children: teaching the distinction between right and wrong.I think we’d all agree that the old practice of teaching through punishment andreprimand is to be avoided. Setting yourself up as a punitive authority onlyemphasizes moral dilemmas you have not solved for yourself. Children quicklydetect the gap between what we say as parents and how we behave. They may learnto obey us out of fear of punishment, but at the emotional level, they intuitthat a parent who has to use threats and coercion is not a model of what “good”should mean.Yet we all know that, despite our best intentions, times do arise when it istempting to punish children out of sheer exasperation and frustration. If weexamine these moments closely, we realize that we are using punishment toresolve issues that aren’t resolved in our own hearts. Do we really believe itis possible to be truly good all the time? Do we fear a God who will exactpunishment on us if we are bad? Is evil a force we feel helpless before,uncertain if goodness can even stand up to it in this world, much less triumph?The frailties of our own spiritual lives come out in the way we decide toparent. There is no escaping this, and even when you try to be loving and gentlewith your children, there are bound to be times when your own doubts will betriggered. Being a spiritual teacher goes beyond how you behave—you are here toimpart real truths about the nature of spiritual life.The easiest way to teach the meaning of spirit is to create an atmosphere inwhich spirit is breathed in as love. To have a baby is such an act of grace thatevery parent wants to return the gift many times over. This is an impulse I havefelt intimately. I could summon the confidence to write this book because my owntwo children allowed me to learn the Seven Spiritual Laws through them. Becauseof their innocence children are ruthless teachers of truth and love. Unless youparent in the total spirit of love, it doesn’t matter what laws you think youare teaching—they will become just lifeless rules that your child will discardas soon as there is no longer an authority to demand obedience.From very early in our children’s lives, my wife and I found that we wereinstinctively following certain practices that only later jelled intoprinciples: * We taught our children to take spirit as a reality, to believe in an infinite source of love that held them dearly. This was our working definition of God. * We put no pressure on them to achieve conventional success. This was our way of telling them that the universe cherished them for who they are, not for what they do. * We never felt the need to punish them, although we let our children know very honestly when we were disappointed, angry, or hurt. This was our way of teaching by reflection instead of rules. * We always remembered that our children were gifts from the universe and let them know that we felt that way. We told them how privileged and honored we felt to help raise them. We didn’t own or possess them. We didn’t project our own expectations onto them. We never felt the need to compare them—for good or bad—with anyone else. This was our way of making them feel complete within themselves. * We told them that they had gifts that could change other people’s lives. We also told them that they could change and create anything they wanted in their own lives. * We told them very early on the kind of success that matters—to bring about worthwhile goals that were meaningful to them, goals that brought them joy. This was the best way we knew of to bring joy and meaning to others. * Finally, we encouraged their dreams. This was our way of telling our children to trust their own desires, the royal road to the inner world.Without being perfect parents, and of course by slipping many times from ourideals, my wife and I found a way to raise our children by inspiration. Showinghow to be “in spirit” is what the word inspired actually means, that is, “tobreathe in the breath of God.” And such modeling also shows what it means tohave enthusiasm, which comes from the Greek words en theos, meaning “in God.”This last point is probably the most important. As parents, if you really wantto impart spiritual laws to your children in a practical way, you need to knowwhether you are being successful or not. The easiest way to tell is to see ifyour children are inspired and enthusiastic. Inspiration, enthusiasm, anddelight are spiritual qualities. Without them, there is no spiritual life at anyage.This is an opportunity to express my deep-felt gratitude to my wife, Rita, whoseinstinct for love and kindness always led the way for me. Being led by herspiritual instincts also implied those things we didn’t do as parents. We didn’tcommand obedience or set ourselves up as authorities. We didn’t pretend alwaysto know the answers. We didn’t suppress our feelings or tell our children thatit was good for them to. And we tried every day to raise them to live their ownlives, not the lives we regretted not having lived ourselves.All these practices can be boiled down to one precept: Every child needs as muchmature love as you can give. What makes love mature—and not just adult—is theconscious spiritual intention behind it. The birth of a baby launches us asteachers of spirit. Afterward we rely on the grace of love, which guides ourintentions in the years to come. Spirit lifts us above our individualfallibility, and in doing that it teaches our children the deepest, mostvaluable lessons."},{"pageContent":"PART TWOPRACTICING THE SEVEN SPIRITUAL LAWSImage Missing [../images/title.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"THERE ARE TWO LASTING BEQUESTS WE CAN HOPE TO GIVE OUR CHILDREN.

Rememberthat children mainly learn from what you are, not what you say. Your ownpractice is always the greatest positive influence. Children need you as a modeland example; in that sense, watching you is their practice from very early on.If they see you growing and changing and finding more meaning and joy in yourown life, the expression “being in harmony with the universe” takes on practicalforce. They will want that for themselves, even if they don’t yet grasp theprinciples involved.In the following pages I’ve outlined a day-by-day program for the family. Eachday of the week is devoted to a single law, beginning with Sunday and the Law ofPure Potentiality. In our family we spend some time every day discussing themeaning of a law, and we agree to look for examples of how that law worked forus that day.In general, all spiritual practice is centered in alertness—just by payingattention to the Seven Spiritual Laws, you invoke their organizing power in yourlife.Each day’s routine also contains three activities that help to focus yourattention on the law for that day. On Sunday the three activities are silentmeditation, communion with Nature, and the practice of non-judgment. Everyone inthe family, children and parents, agrees to spend a little time on theseactivities; it is best if this is time shared with the whole family.All in all, these three activities don’t take more than a few minutes, at mosthalf an hour. Paying attention isn’t a matter of time, anyway, it’s a matter ofusing your awareness. It can take a split second to notice something beautiful.It takes no time at all to stop judging others as right or wrong.The culmination of each day is dinnertime, when we all talk about what we’vedone and observed and learned during the day. This discussion is casual andunforced. Whoever wants to speak up does, in as few or as many words as feelcomfortable. At the beginning, while the Seven Spiritual Laws are new, you asparents may have to do a little coaxing to encourage your children to comment,but in very short order they will catch on—after all, this is their time to beheard, to have you pay attention to them in a wholly positive way."},{"pageContent":"SUNDAYis the day of Pure Potentiality.Today we tell our children,“Everything is possible, no matter what.”On sunday we agree as parents to do the following things with our children: 1.

Thefield where everything is possible is spirit; this is our source. Withineveryone is the seed of creativity that can grow in any direction. Nothinglimits us except ourselves, for the truest aspect of each person is unboundedpotential.By connecting with our source we activate all possibilities in daily life. Inpractice this means that we all take time to experience the silent field of pureawareness. Children need to learn that silence is the home of spirit. All othervoices speak out loud, but spirit communicates without making a sound.Being in touch with the field of all possibilities means that you experienceself-referral—that is, you look within for guidance. Self-referral bringsfulfillment of the spirit that cannot be achieved by material success. Thereason we want success is to reach our potential for happiness and wisdom, notjust our potential to earn and acquire. Sunday is a good day to ground the wholeweek on such beliefs.With children, using the vocabulary of the heart is often more effective thanusing abstract words like potentiality. “Listen to your heart, your heart knows”is a good beginning, along with sentences like these:Set your heart on being all you can be.In your heart, anything is possible.In your heart you know things are going to work out for the best.If you’re pure of heart, you can bring anything to you.No matter what seems to be going on around you, in your heart you’ll know thatyou can do it.You should also make clear that heart isn’t just another word for emotions. Theheart is a spiritual center. It contains silence and wisdom. Certainly thetruest emotions, such as love and compassion, arise from this source, but wewant our children to locate the heart as a place where the sense of “I am”resides. This is the seed of inspiration from which all possibilities flow; itis our connection to the field of pure potential. No one is a success whodoesn’t feel successful in his or her heart of hearts.SUNDAY WITH THE CHILDRENThe three activities for Sunday are meditating, appreciating Nature’s wonder andbeauty, and learning to see new possibilities in familiar situations.1. Adults in the family should practice a period of silent meditation lasting15–20 minutes in the morning and afternoon. Young children can be nurtured inthis practice gradually. From the time your children are the age of six orseven, begin to teach them that a few minutes of being alone and quiet every dayis good. Before this age, do not make any attempt to suppress your children’snatural energy and enthusiasm. Inner silence is a delicate experience thatcannot blossom until the nervous system has begun to mature. Until your childrenare age twelve or so, it is enough just to set a personal example. Rather thaninsist that meditation become part of the daily routine, wait for relaxedopportunities to invite a child to sit still with you (preferably while you aredoing your own meditation) and breathe quietly with eyes closed. Ask her to feelthe breath as it softly goes in and out; an older child might be asked tovisualize the breath as a soft blue-white light going in and out of thenostrils. Say something encouraging. Indicating that you enjoy your ownmeditation is a good way to provide incentive.Five minutes of this simple breathing exercise is enough at the outset. Increaseto 15 minutes by ages ten to twelve.Don’t be impatient if your child doesn’t take to sitting still every time youinvite him to. If all you get is fidgeting, just have him go out while youcontinue your meditation. The example of your own enjoyment will draw your childinto the practice naturally. What should your own meditation practice be? Iadvocate either the breathing meditation just described or Primordial SoundMeditation. (This is taught at The Chopra Center for Well Being as well as bythe teachers trained there. You can call the Center in La Jolla, California, tolocate a qualified teacher in your area.)Meditation without knowledge loses half its value, therefore, whatever you cansay to your children about the benefits of meditation will be extremelyencouraging. Inner silence promotes clarity of mind; it makes us value our innerworld; it trains us to go inside to the source of peace and inspiration when weare faced with problems and challenges.2. Nature breathes the breath of spirit. Its beauty reflects our souls’ wonderat being here. So when you take time to go out into a natural setting—walking inthe park, hiking a nature trail, picnicking at the beach or in themountains—infinite creativity can be seen in every tiny flower. I love thesaying “What God can give us is limited only by our ability to appreciate Hisgifts.” In terms of success this is totally true—you can see as far as yourvision permits. Nature is the perfect place to stretch your horizon.Children love to be inspired by natural wonders, and you can support theexperience by pointing out how expanded and free Nature makes us feel. The senseof “I can do anything” wells up naturally when you contemplate the vast open skyor the glories of a towering mountain range. People who focus on the physicalaspects of Nature tend to dwell on how small and insignificant human beings seemto be on Nature’s vast scale, but this isn’t true on the spiritual plane.Spiritually, the infinite vistas of the natural world make us feel that we canbe at one with infinity.3. Every second of time is a doorway to unbounded possibilities. Yet if you arenot open to them, these possibilities shrink. It’s important, therefore, toteach children to reach for something new in a well-known situation. What doesit take to see new things? You need insight and perceptiveness, freedom fromjudgment, a willingness to be open. Success hinges on all these things, and youwill be teaching all of them whenever you pose the simple question “Is thereanother way of looking at this?”There always is. For example, a friend of mine was invited to dinner recently.At the doorstep he was told not to mind Claudia, the youngest child in thefamily, if she didn’t eat. “We have problems with her. She’s six, and she’s juststubborn about not eating,” the parents said. When my friend sat down to dinner,Claudia immediately went into her pattern of “I don’t like this,” “What is it?”and so on—a well-worn routine that the parents greeted with “Nothing can be doneabout it.” In other words, everyone concerned was voicing those thoughts thatkeep us imprisoned in old, uncreative patterns.On sheer impulse, my friend leaned over to Claudia and whispered, “That food onyour plate looks so good, I want it for myself.” He drew a line down the centerof her plate with his knife. “Okay, everything on this side of the line is mine,and you can’t touch it, no matter what.” This was all said in a playful tone.Claudia looked wide-eyed. She had always faced dinner as a trial, a powerstruggle with her parents. Now my friend was making it into a game. He lookedaway and said in a loud voice, “Claudia’s not eating my food, is she? Shewouldn’t do that, would she?”Of course Claudia couldn’t help but eat everything on “his side” of her plate asfast as possible. The temptation to play the game was just too great. This is agood example of how reframing a situation allowed everyone, parents included, tobreak through old barriers.Without noticing it, each of us imposes limits on the way we perceive the world.We are faced with infinite, boundless possibilities, yet we don’t seize them—orwe seize them very rarely—because our past conditioning is always forcing us topass judgment. Our minds say:I don’t like it.I can’t understand it.I already know all about it.It’s wrong (or bad or boring).Nothing can be done about it.This is a good day to catch yourself and your children when you make one ofthese statements out loud. They happen all the time. Someone or somethingcrosses our path, and we instantly pass judgment, which seals off any flow ofnew possibilities. Therefore, when you notice even a single instance, shift yourperception. Ask your children to look for some new quality in themselves orsomeone else; ask for a stretch of imagination. Invite fantasy, experimentation,openness.If you can be the teacher of this thing only, you will do more for yourchildren’s success than you could by any other means—success is synonymous withgrasping opportunities others have passed by.Once older children are ready for more abstract concepts, it’s extremelyvaluable to teach non-judgment. Non-judgment means not labeling other people andtheir ways “right” or “wrong.” It is the first step toward the mature attitudesof acceptance, nonviolence, and compassion for life.Passing judgment is not part of a spiritual person’s approach to life. We allproject negativity onto other people, but we do this because we confuse ouremotional reactions with reality. If people make us angry, distressed, afraid,and so on, we feel that this negativity is their responsibility. Spiritually,the Law of Pure Potentiality tells us that no one can be labeled or judgedbecause life is all possibilities; everything is inside ourselves. Nothing inour nature can be created or destroyed by someone “out there.” The very personwho makes you angry or afraid can have the opposite effect on someone else. Soit is worth setting aside some time on this day to see everyone in the light oflove, to hold no judgment, to call no one bad or wrong.Non-judgment isn’t easy to communicate to young children. Even a simplestatement like “Don’t say your little brother is wrong” becomes confusing, sinceit can easily be interpreted as a reprimand; any time you use the word don’t orstop or no, you are passing your own judgments. It’s far better to take apositive approach: ask each child to find one good thing or one lovable thing inanother child. Make that the task for the day, and then discuss it at dinner.In truth none of us should outgrow this simple game, but you can start to askolder children to take responsibility for how they feel. This means that theybegin to learn the difference between “You did something that made me mad” and“I have angry feelings I want to deal with myself.”Don’t push on this front, however, since it takes a lifetime to grow into matureresponsibility for how we feel. Projection is a powerful force. But if you teachacceptance and tolerance, imparting the belief that everyone is doing the bestthey can and should be seen in that light, not as we expect them to behave, thenyou will be doing a great deal to teach the First Law."},{"pageContent":"REFLECTIONS ON THE LAW OF PURE POTENTIALITYEverything flows from the infinite source, which is God. . . .God is part of every child,connecting every child with the source.Since God creates everything,a child should be encouraged to believe thateverything is possible in his or her life.Everyone can get in touchwith the seed of God that is inside. . . .Every day brings a chance to water that seedand watch it grow.When children feel small and weak,remind them that they are children of the universe."},{"pageContent":"MONDAYis the day of Giving.Today we tell our children, “If you want to get something, give it.”On monday we agree as parents to do the following things with our children: 1.

Share a brief ritual of gratitude for life’s gifts"},{"pageContent":"IF YOU WOULD TAKE, YOU MUST FIRST GIVE.LAO-TZUON THIS DAY we pay attention to ways we can give to others. Because there is nogiving without receiving, we complete the cycle by paying attention to receivingas well. Giving is thus seen as constant movement, the circulation of everythingin creation. Creating anything implies taking some seed or inspiration andgiving birth to it. In this giving the seed grows, the fruits multiply, and theinspiration finds form.Spiritually, success depends on following the laws that govern Nature’sworkings, and giving is among the most valuable. Many spiritual masters havetaught, as the modern yogi Shivananda puts it, that “giving is the secret ofabundance.” There is no mystery to this; it has always been true that to getlove you must first give it, and God always gives all things from love. When wegive, we show our understanding of the truth that spirit is the giver of all.It’s not always easy to resist the urge to take and hoard. These tendencies areborn from ignorance of spiritual law. Children love to give, and if they startnot to give, that is a reflection of the attitudes they see in us. Even agrown-up who constantly says, “Learn to share. Be good and give your littlebrother some. Be a good girl and you’ll get something nice,” may still becommunicating, at a deeper level, her own gnawing fear of lack and scarcity andthe ego’s need to possess and hold on. These deep-seated beliefs defeat thespirit of giving. Devoting this day to giving is far more important than whatyou give in material terms.MONDAY WITH THE CHILDRENExcept for the very youngest children, Monday is a school day, so we discuss theLaw of Giving at breakfast and dinner. At breakfast we set the agenda for theday; at dinner we all share what we’ve accomplished and learned. The same holdstrue for all the other laws that fall on weekdays. (But remember, the minutes ofsilence that are practiced on Sunday get repeated every day, during the times inthe morning and afternoon when you do your own meditation.)The three activities for Monday involve giving to someone else in the family,receiving graciously, and performing a brief ritual of gratitude.1. Make it a practice as a family to have every member give something to someoneelse. These gifts should not be elaborately planned or worked over. Rememberingto give a smile, a word of encouragement, or help with a chore is natural andsimple. It is also what is likely to last, for simple giving within the homecultures the desire to serve. Success is combined with fulfillment when there isan ample aspect of service in it.Some families find that a big problem can develop over this issue of giving,sharing, and serving. Children naturally want to give. It is unfortunate thatpeople so thoughtlessly repeat the statement “Children are born selfish.”Selfishness results from a young child not yet understanding how things actuallywork. To a very young child, letting go of a toy is the same as losing itpermanently; grabbing a piece of candy is a natural response because a youngchild doesn’t yet realize that there is more than one piece, or that the one canbe shared.Observing my own children when they were young, I found that their faces lit upwhen they had the opportunity to give, and not because they thought they wouldreceive anything in return. We begin to doubt that the universe will returnthings to us only after our minds get imprinted by fear, lack, abandonment, andgreed. Without these imprints, it is obvious that life is a flow of infinitethings, some material, some not. How much did anyone have to pay for the air,rain, and sunlight that sustain our life?People who forget how to give have reverted to a primitive state ofconsciousness—they believe that if they let go of something, it is gone forever.They forget that we receive anything only because the universe wants us toexperience its inner significance for ourselves. In every getting there is aspiritual lesson. Mere possessions are no substitute for the satisfaction,contentment, and inner fulfillment that are meant to go with them.You should concentrate with your children on how it feels to give. To make surethat the feeling is pleasurable, first treat giving as sharing. Even a three- orfour-year-old can feel how nice it is to give a friend one piece of candy if shehas two. Older children can be taught to give less tangible things, such as asmile, a kind word, or help to someone in need. Set these as goals for the dayand then discuss how things went at dinner.With children ages twelve and above, the emphasis changes yet again. They areold enough to learn to give when it is not so easy, when one is tempted towithhold or to be selfish. It is at this age that you can talk about how holdingon causes pain to the heart and makes others see one as selfish. Learning togive praise to the winner of a game you’ve just lost, to treat outsiders withkindness and include them in your clique, and to offer help with tact and a lackof self-importance are all appropriate lessons for older children.2. To receive graciously is an art that cannot be faked. If it is more blessedto give than to receive, it is much harder to receive than to give. We receiveungraciously out of pride, feeling that we don’t need anyone’s help, handouts,or charity, or out of some sense of discomfort. These are all ego reactions, andthere is no need to have them once you realize that the giver is never thegiver, just as the receiver is never the receiver. Both stand in for spirit.Every breath we take is a gift, and in that realization, we see that receivingfrom another person is a symbol of receiving from God. Every gift is a gestureof love that stands in for divine love, and should be received as such. Withyounger children, this isn’t a problem—they love to receive and have nodifficulty lighting up with gratitude.At later ages the onset of ego needs clouds the issue somewhat. We’ve allexperienced the grudging thank-you forced out of a child’s mouth by a parentwhen no gratitude is present. This attitude can be changed only by having yourchildren continue to pay attention to how it feels to receive. If attention ispaid from an early age, the natural warmth and happiness of receiving will notfade. Any person at any age must feel grateful in order to show gratitude. Suchfeelings can be supported by teaching that all things come from the universalsource. Every time we receive, we are given a glimpse of divine love, whoeverthat love happens to be acting through at the moment.3. A ritual of gratitude, shared by the whole family, is a nice way toacknowledge the gift of life. You might hold hands at the dinner table and givethanks, not just for the food on the table but for all that has been given thatday. Have each family member mention one thing, such as “I’m thankful for thebeautiful butterfly I saw on the way home from school,” “I’m thankful we’re allwell and happy,” “I give thanks for getting a part in the school play,” and soon.In many families the ritual of saying blessing has grown stale, and the holidayof Thanksgiving has all but dwindled into meaninglessness. To reverse this takesconscious effort, with the emphasis on conscious. It takes awareness to rememberthat life is a gift, however overwhelmed we may be by other thoughts andpursuits. The joy and enthusiasm you can feel for the spirit reflects back ontoyou."},{"pageContent":"REFLECTIONS ON THE LAW OF GIVINGAll good things move around.

Talk about some choice they made today 2. Show them how our future was changed by a past choice we made 3. Explain right and wrong in terms of how choices feel"},{"pageContent":"CERTAIN ARE THE BLESSINGS GROWING OUT OF YOUR GOOD ACTIONS.BUDDHABECAUSE IT IS a specialized term, I have put the word “karma” in quotationmarks, but any instance of cause and effect falls under this heading. Questionslike “Why should I choose this instead of that?” or “What will happen if Iapproach a problem this way instead of that?” arise every day in children’slives. Children need to know that each choice they make leads to results of akind that will be good or bad for them—in other words, every choice changes thefuture.In crude terms, karma is usually interpreted as bringing rewards for good actionand punishment for bad. Parents translate this into a system of rewards andpunishment without teaching the really crucial thing: Nature herself handlessuch matters. A popular cynical saying holds that “life isn’t fair,” whenkarmically the exact opposite is true. Life is completely fair. But the workingsof life can be deep and hidden, and effects can follow causes on many levels. Itis up to us not to judge what result an action deserves but to observe closelyhow the cause-and-effect universe works, then to model our behavior accordingly.Here the Seven Spiritual Laws seem to run into conflict with received opinion,for the Law of Karma states that there is no unfairness, no accidents, novictimization—all things are ordered according to an inescapable system ofcosmic cause and effect. Karma is not fatalism; it doesn’t dictate that peoplehave to suffer What it does dictate is that free will is absolute. There is nodivine power keeping us from making bad choices, nor is there an escape clausethat nullifies the universal rule “As you sow, so shall you reap.”Karma, then, involves awareness in several areas: witnessing how choices getmade, evaluating their outcome, and listening to your heart, the place wheresubtle emotional signals indicate when actions are right or wrong. All thesestrategies can be communicated to children when we teach them how to makechoices. Choice in all its complexity is critical to success in life, forsuccess is just a name for the desirable results we wish to achieve through ouractions.TUESDAY WITH THE CHILDRENThe three activities for Tuesday all center on talking about choices—how we makethem, how they change our lives, what results to expect when we favor one wayover another.1. Talk to each of your children about one choice he or she made today.Naturally the sky’s the limit here, because every moment is filled withchoices—just encourage anything that comes to their minds. Whatever thechoice—making a new friend, spending money on something, deciding not to playwith A or B—begin to explore what happens when choices are made. Without settingdown hard-and-fast rules (which would kill the spontaneity of the discussion),you can start to teach your children about the intricate mechanisms of cause andeffect, of sowing and reaping.When a choice is brought up, gently explore it by asking questions such as “Howdid you feel about that?”; “What do you think will happen?”; “What will you doif that happens instead?” Choice is intimately personal, and as much as youmight be tempted to try to control your children’s choices of playmates,activities, hobbies, school subjects, and so on, the best way to use yourinfluence is to make your children into sensitive, aware choice makers.For young children, choice is often crude and indiscriminate. As soon as theylearn to talk, toddlers automatically say, “Let me do it,” “I want to,” and thelike. This is an assertion of will, and will drives choice. Only later does achild begin to see that choices lead to consequences. The ego doesn’t enjoy notgetting its way, and it would be absolute ruler of our lives if negative resultsdidn’t arise from actions that are not right for us. Thus karma constantlyteaches us to discriminate between what we want and what we know is good for us.This theme comes up naturally in every child’s life. Every child wants more thanshe gets, and our task is to show our children that choice isn’t an endlessstream of willful demands. The universe listens to choices from the depth atwhich they are made. To choose love and truth, for example, is very deep andbrings good rewards. To choose selfishness is shallow and brings little reward.I don’t believe it’s helpful to use the time-honored statement “Every good deedis its own reward.” This implies an inattentive or blind universe. Spiritualmasters have all asserted that God or spirit rewards virtue; nothing is leftunrewarded, in the sense that no action occurs in a vacuum. Karma is a computingsystem that gives back what we put in, but with a measure of grace added. If wehad omniscient vision at all levels, as God does, we would certainly accept anyso-called negative result, because we would see that nothing better couldresult.The fact that every action leads to the best result possible is a law known asgrace. Grace is God’s loving organization of time and space. It allows us freewill to do anything we want, and the results of our actions, whether pleasant orunpleasant, are brought back to us at the perfect time to learn from what wechose. In other words, anything that happens to us reflects a lovingguardianship of our well-being.Children need to learn, then, that pleasure and pain aren’t the ultimate guideof whether an action is good or bad for them. By observing how cause and effectwork, a child gradually sees that life is a learning process on many levels.Quite often an action can be judged solely on whether it brings pleasure orpain, but many times other factors enter in.2. It’s helpful as children grow older to tell them stories about the choicesthat affected your life. Instinctively children know that life is a quest; theymay have to learn that the future depends on the choices they make, butemotionally they intuit that adults have made many important choices. When youtalk about your choices, don’t voice them in terms of regrets. “I did thiswrong, so I’m going to make sure you never do the same” may be well intended,but your offspring are going to try a little bit of everything. That isinevitable. Besides, a parent’s wish is always for the children to have morechoices, not fewer, and more choices can be overwhelming unless they areaccompanied by the ability to choose.3. Talk to your children about how it feels to make one choice over anotherChildhood is the age when we first decide whether results are more importantthan emotions. Discussions therefore tend to take a familiar shape: “You won thegame when you didn’t pick that weak boy to be on your team, but how did you feelwhen you looked at him? How did he feel?” Or “Your friends asked you to cutschool, and now you’re afraid they’ll think you just suck up. But how would youhave felt knowing that you weren’t where you should have been?” Or “You didn’tpick up your room when I asked you to. Did you have a certain feeling aboutthat?”The critical factor in being a good choice maker is usually not the rationalreason for doing one thing as opposed to another but how each choice felt. Thisis because, in spiritual terms, intuition is a subtler faculty than reason.Evaluating cause and effect is more emotional than intellectual: our hearts tellus when an action is right or wrong or in some gray zone of doubt.From an early age you can teach your children to notice if doing something wrongfeels bad. Later on, the concept of having a conscience can be introduced, andfinally, after age twelve or so, you can begin to discuss the more abstractaspects of how actions and results are intimately linked. I don’t mean teaching“you have to pay if you do something wrong”—this implies that we all live underdivine threat. There is no divine threat; the only reason that certain negativeresults seem to come out of the blue is that we are not in touch with the deeperlevels of Nature. We violate spiritual law through ignorance.Because we are a results-oriented society, and one where praise and fame oftengo to people who’ve earned their success in ways that are harmful to boththemselves and others, the heart value of karma is often overlooked. Yetrecently the notion of “emotional intelligence” has come into vogue, and it hasbeen strongly linked to success. Emotional intelligence centers on empathy; ittells us how an action will affect someone else; we feel in advance what theywill feel. Choices made on the basis of promoting other people’s well-being tendto result in more success than choices made solely out of self-interest. Thismay be a surprising finding in a materialistic culture, but it is totallypredictable through the Law of Karma. Asking your child, “How does that choicefeel?” and “How did it make the other person feel?” is primary to both emotionalintelligence and good karma.A critical part of emotional intelligence is learning to delay immediategratification. Children who learn to be patient, to wait for results rather thangrab immediate gain, are much more successful in life than children who mustgratify every whim immediately. This is particularly true in relationships,since learning to see beyond one’s immediate reactions is the first step towardempathy, and without empathy for another person’s feelings, lastingrelationships are impossible.Spiritually, emotional intelligence is connected to the vitally important issueof ego boundaries. If you feel that you are a person isolated in time and space,disconnected from others, there is no reason to obey any guidance except yourown impulses. But if you see that your ego is not the real you, that your selfextends without limit throughout all of Nature, then you can afford to act inways that are altruistic, unselfish, and empathetic because you realize, at thedeepest level, that “you” and “I” are one. Thus actions are not limited to what“I” want; results are not bound by what happens to “me.” There is an overallflow to life that embraces everyone in a larger divine purpose. Teachingchildren to observe this flow, to see how their lives fit into the universe as asingle cell fits into the body, is extremely valuable. The lessons of emotionalintelligence can be extended far beyond the emotions to the realm of all actionand reaction.In practical terms, what we do on this day is observe our immediate reactionsand then ask, “Is this all there is to a situation?” Introduce the notion thatevery situation contains aspects beyond what any one person can see. How doother people see the situation? For example, how did the loser of a game feel ifyour child was the winner? How does your child feel when someone else hurts herfeelings? Show that it is possible to empathize by putting the shoe on the otherfoot. Through these gentle instructions on witnessing how things work, you canmake karma very real and concrete."},{"pageContent":"REFLECTIONS ON THE LAW OF KARMANo debt goes unpaid in the universe.Don’t grieve over losses—you can only lose what is unreal, and when it is gone,the real will be left behind.To bring yourself love and happiness, do what you can to bring them to others.If you don’t see an immediate result to good or bad action, be patient andobserve."},{"pageContent":"WEDNESDAYis the day of Least Effort.Today we tell our children, “Don’t say no—go with the flow.”On wednesday we agree as parents to do the following things with our children: 1.

ALLOW IT TOFULFILL ITSELF.NISARGADATTA MAHARAJTHE SIMPLE PHRASE “Go with the flow” is actually very significant spiritually.The ancient Greek philosopher Heraclitus declared that life is like a river—youcannot step into it in the same place twice. Existence is always new, yet we aretempted to bring old reactions to it. When we find ourselves resistinganything—which basically means saying no—we are usually trying to impose an oldbelief or habit on a new situation.The Law of Least Effort bids us to recognize the newness of life by allowing itto unfold without interference. It tells us to be in the moment, to look forNature’s help, and to stop blaming anyone or anything outside ourselves. In theflow, spirit is already organizing the millions upon millions of details thatuphold life—from the infinite processes needed to keep a single cell alive tothe vast intricacies of the evolving universe. By connecting with spirit, weride this cosmic organizing power and take advantage of it.For many adults, however, the concept of least effort is a difficult one. Ourtechnology is constantly trying to find ways to save work through more efficientmachines, but translating this to the human level is not easy. The biggestobstacle is our work ethic, which holds that more work reaps greater rewards.There are two flaws in this. First, Nature herself operates through leasteffort—the laws of physics dictate that any process, from the spin of anelectron to the spin of a galaxy, must function according to the most efficientexpenditure of energy, with the least drag. Second, human advancement alwayscomes through ideas, inspiration, and desire. These occur spontaneously; thereis no amount of work that can force inspiration, or desire, or even consistentlygood ideas.If going with the flow is hard for us, it comes very naturally to a child.Hardly any instruction is needed before age six or so, since young childrenimmediately take the course of least resistance—they reach for what they want,say what they have to say, express the emotion that rises with the moment. Andtheir chief activity is not work but play. We can introduce older children tothe interrelated ideas of not resisting, putting up no defense, and takingresponsibility for how one chooses to work. Acceptance is essential because alot of effort is wasted whenever you put up resistance. Defenselessness is tiedto acceptance, in that having to defend your point of view creates conflict andchaos, which are both huge wastes of energy.Trying to get our own way is a temptation few of us can resist, but the Law ofLeast Effort tells us that we can have our way through means other than struggleand conflict. We can follow the flow of spirit, knowing that its infiniteorganizing power will tend to our wants. Thus the Law of Least Effort brings infaith and patience. We were all taught that fighting and struggle are the routeto success. In reality, it is much more important to have faith in your owndesires. When you assume that other people exist to block you from achievingwhat you want, you have no choice but to constantly defend yourself. Teaching achild that there is a wish-granting power far beyond the power of other peopleis a valuable lesson.The third element in the Law of Least Effort is responsibility. Children shouldalso be taught that success and fulfillment come from inside, and it is onlyinside that matters. Each of us is responsible for how we feel, what we wishfor, and how we decide to approach life’s challenges. The highest responsibilityis fulfilled not by doing a huge amount of work but by doing the work of spiritin an attitude of joy and creativity. This is the only way that life withoutstruggle becomes possible.WEDNESDAY WITH THE CHILDRENThe three activities for Wednesday are finding the game in a task, reducingwork, and looking for ways Nature helps us.1. The ancient Vedic scriptures of India say that the whole cosmos is a lila, orplay of the gods—meaning that this is a recreational universe. By finding thegame in even one task today, you teach your children the divine way to approachwork. Most of the time, you as parents can make a task into a game by removingthe pressures that obstruct play. These include warnings, threats, timepressures, guilt tripping, and offers of money or other rewards for work done.Despite your own ingrained work ethic, there are certain spiritual truthsconcerning work:Spirit doesn’t blame for work not done.Life doesn’t depend on whether something gets done or not.Work isn’t the source of happiness.Your attitude toward your work, not the task itself, comes first.Thus a task that waits to get done until you feel relaxed and comfortable aboutit is a task well done. The exact opposite of this attitude is perfectionism.Perfectionism is rooted in fear and control. It masks the hidden feeling “Iwon’t survive if I don’t do this exactly as God wants it,” implying that God isa blaming, unloving taskmaster.In reality God wants you to enjoy this recreational universe, and the sooner youteach your children that doing so is all right, the more chance you give them tobe successful. By definition successful people enjoy what they do. They havefound the only way to be in “the zone” or “the flow,” which is to relax.Relaxation is the prerequisite for that inner expansion that allows a person toexpress the source of inspiration and joy within.Having realized this, set an example for your children by turning anytask—vacuuming the rug, picking up their room, mowing the lawn—into a game or asource of stimulation. You can practice a song while taking out the garbage ormake up a poem washing the dishes.Games take a little more invention: “We’re not just going to vacuum today, we’relooking for ghosts. Didn’t you know that ghosts run away from vacuum cleaners?They can’t stand them.” With this as a start, have one of your children be theghost. After the “ghost” hides, the child with the vacuum goes into thedesignated room and tries to lure the ghost out by vacuuming under the bed, inthe closet, behind the sofa, etc. Once you find the ghost, you get to tradeplaces and become the ghost in the next room. (If you have only one child, cutout a paper ghost and hide it somewhere to be found, or five ghosts, and give aprize if more than four are found.)Making up games is a good way to reverse our own tendency to forget that life ismeant to be approached as play, reflecting the divine play of the cosmos. Thematuring process can be a numbing, even deadening process. To combat thistendency, find the game in your own activities, the joy as the heart of work.Show your own enjoyment to your children, and as soon as any task isn’t fun orthe game grows stale, stop working. There’s no harm in a job well done, but ajob done in an attitude of fatigue, struggle, and imposition isn’t worth doing.The results of your work will be clouded by the negativity that comes with them.2. Set aside a few minutes for the whole family to concentrate on reducingeffort, strain, and wear and tear. Talk at the dinner table about times whensolutions appeared that were much easier than you thought they would be. Thewhole drift is to defuse the notion, which bombards us from every side, thatlife is a problem. In spiritual terms, life is not problematic; only ourattitudes toward it are. Your children are going to hear from dozens of people aday that things are hard, tough, difficult, a struggle, even overwhelming. (Ifyou think this isn’t happening among grade-school children, just listen tointerviews with third- and fourth-graders complaining about the pressure toachieve that is already crippling their chance for happiness and forcing them tocope with stress at inconceivably early ages.)Reducing the amount of work in a situation sometimes calls for a mechanicalsolution, such as using a more powerful computer to solve a technical problem,but more often what’s needed is a shift in attitude. Nothing is more efficientthan spirit. When you can invoke spirit, you have more chance for success thanunder any other circumstance. Spirit is creative fullness; that is why the Latinword genius also means “spirit.”In practice, invoking spirit means the following: * Being in a good mood for work. * Approaching tasks with relaxed confidence. * Not straining or putting excessive demands on yourself physically (e.g., staying up late, working overtime, not taking breaks, not eating and getting enough fluids). * Meditating regularly. * Asking for inspiration; being patient until it comes. * Not resisting changes in the situation. * Not having to have your own way. * Not assuming that you know the answer in advance.Review these points at dinner to reinforce the habits you want your children todevelop.3. When spirit, or Nature, does come to help with a task, its arrival is oftensilent and unnoticed. Therefore it’s good to start children noticing as soon aspossible. “Did you get a new idea today?”; “Were you surprised by how easysomething that you thought would be hard turned out to be?” You can begin withquestions like these and then offer your own examples. The emphasis should be oncreative solutions, however trivial seeming, that made you feel inspired.Encouraging such an attitude from the earliest age opens the way for inspirationin years to come."},{"pageContent":"REFLECTIONS ON THE LAW OF LEAST EFFORTPut every effort into organizing your life, but remember that the ultimateorganizer is Nature.Don’t try to steer the river.When Nature is most productive and creative, it does not work . . . it plays.The best work flows from us effortlessly.Putting up resistance to life ultimately never succeeds.Allow the gifts of spirit to come to you."},{"pageContent":"THURSDAYis the day of Intention and Desire.Today we tell our children, “Every time you wish or want, you plant a seed.”On thursday we agree as parents to do the following things with our children: 1.

Be alert in the present moment, where all fulfillment occurs"},{"pageContent":"BE VERY CAREFUL WHAT YOU SET YOUR HEART UPON, FOR YOU WILL SURELY HAVE IT.RALPH WALDO EMERSONMAKING OUR DESIRES come true is at the heart of success, and, for all of us, howwe learned to do that dates from childhood. Desire is a tangled issue. It raiseshidden questions about how much we deserve, how good we really are, whether Godwants us to succeed, and so on. There are so many questions, in fact, that noparent can answer all of them in advance. Success and failure are extremelypersonal experiences, being intimately linked to who you think you really aredeep down.As parents we therefore want to lay the strongest foundation of self-esteem forthe countless experiences of success and failure that will come as our childrengrow up. Spiritually, desire is never a negative; we were born as creatures ofdesire. Without it, we would not want to grow. Other creatures don’t have towant to grow, because for them the process is genetic; for humans, however,wanting to grow leads the mind toward the source of infinite love, peace, andpower that is the very goal of life.Children need to learn that desire is the path to God, and intention is thechief tool on that path. What you intend for yourself determines what you get.Although it seems like a paradox, you must have a vision of the future in orderfor the future to surprise you, for without visions, life dwindles into ritualand repetition. A future that merely repeats the present can never besurprising.The spiritual process that makes desires come true doesn’t occur to us asspontaneously as desire itself. It needs to be taught. Lack of success in lifeis principally due to mental confusion. We fail to notice how deeply conflictedour desires are, for example, causing us to send unwitting mixed messages to theuniverse. A chronic failure who wishes for wealth, for example, while alsowanting to accept no responsibility for himself is in essence sending a contraryinput to the cosmic computer, and usually the person cannot see this. Twocontrary desires coexist: “I want wealth” and “I don’t want to see my situationhonestly.” Lack of awareness then shifts the blame for failure onto some outsideperson or circumstance when in reality Nature is giving a response to each wish.It just happens that the wishes are weak, unfocused, and in contradiction witheach other.Being aware of what you want is such an obvious first step in the process ofdesiring that it is amazing how many people ignore it. Your children have manylevels of desire they may not be aware of, just as adults do. Desires don’talways arise clearly, and they rarely arise by themselves; they are liberallymixed with fantasy, dreaming, wishing, and projection. Also, desiring is aprocess that comes in continuous waves, one overlapping the other. We are allworking on big desires that take months and years to be fulfilled, along withsmaller desires that take days, hours, or minutes.The more specific your children learn to be with their intentions, the moreeasily they will be able to order their lives, since order begins in the mind.THURSDAY WITH THE CHILDRENThe three activities for Thursday center on clarifying the mechanics of desire:listing or stating the desire as specifically as possible, releasing the desireto the universe, trusting in the mechanics of creation to bring you a result,and remaining alert to the present moment, which is where all results occur.1. Today have everyone in the family make a list of desires for the coming weekand post it on the refrigerator. (You can begin this activity when a child isnine or ten; younger children would just interpret it as making out a list forSanta Claus, since they can’t yet grasp the mechanics of intention.)In guiding your children’s lists, ask prompting questions such as “What do youmost wish for yourself this week?”; “What do you most wish for someone else?”;“What do you want to happen at school?” Try to avoid the tendency for the listto simply become a series of acquisitions—i.e., a new bicycle or a computergame.Point out instead that the universe is always bringing to us a stream of resultsand rewards that stem from our wishes and wants. Wishes and wants are likeseeds, and the things that happen to us are the sprouting of those seeds. Someseeds take a long time to sprout—a child inspired to play the piano can beplanting a seed that grows for a lifetime, for example. All of us are working onboth big and small desires. Not all of these can come true at once. Each desirehas its own season, its own way of coming true.Encourage your children to want happiness and fulfillment, the absence ofconflict and struggle, and other spiritual rewards as primary desires. But alsoencourage the sprouting of seeds that you see as valuable on any level—a buddingtalent, a good tendency at school or in personal relationships, being less shyor better at a certain game or subject, for instance.And what about younger children who aren’t ready to make lists or think aboutdesires as intentions? Try a more concrete approach: actually plant a bean seedbetween two wet blotters and show them the miracle of germination. Thentransplant the seed and tell them that if they want the seedling to grow, theyneed to help water it and care for it. The metaphor of the seed is applicable atevery age, since it relates directly to the mechanics of Nature.2. Releasing your desire is not the easiest thing for children to grasp,especially if they have developed the habit of seeing their parents as thesource of all the things they want. Many parents, faced with children whounendingly try to wheedle things out of them, would be horrified at the thoughtof teaching them to want more. The point is to want more efficiently. Releasinga desire to the universe is part of being efficient, because making wishes andwants come true is never solely in anyone’s power.Success comes from any and all directions.Once you realize this, you can teach your children the principle of patientexpectation. That is, once you know what you want, you stay relaxed about it.The shallow, trivial desires will simply fall away, but those that are sincereand deep will be nourished by Nature. Tell your children that desires kept inthe heart come true faster than those we constantly broadcast by talking aboutthem or putting demands on others.3. At any moment of the day, some desire is in the process of coming true. Oldseeds we planted (and perhaps forgot about) are bringing results, mixed in withthe beginnings of larger results to come. The point is to make your childrenaware that the universe (or spirit or God) is always listening; none of us isalone. We are constantly being heeded.A simple way to remain alert for the universe’s response is to keep tabs on thelists you have put on the refrigerator Ask your children to report on how eachdesire is coming true throughout the week. You can ask a prompting question like“Did anything really nice happen to you today?” and then point out how theanswer fits in with the child’s list for that week.Alertness in the present moment is the fertilizer that keeps fulfillment ofdesire growing.Most desires are fulfilled in many small stages, not all at once; this isespecially true of the seeds that, once planted, grow for years and years. Everystep of fulfillment comes in its own time, at its own moment. Therefore, bybeing alert to every moment, we receive the results of our wishes. A simpleexample is happiness. Everyone wants to be happy, but many people expect someepiphany or sudden burst of joy that will last forever. True happiness is notlike that; it is a state of well-being that you must be alert to. Otherwise themoment will pass without notice or else be masked by the things outside yourselfthat seem to be making you happy (or unhappy). Thus remaining alert to thepresent moment happens inside; to keep looking outside yourself for desires tocome true is to miss the real focus of fulfillment.Many younger children do not have the attention span to follow a desire frominception to completion, but they can still be taught that wanting somethingdoesn’t have to lead to demands, whining, and general distress if thefulfillment doesn’t come immediately. Being attentive to your children’s wants,you stand in for Nature at this early stage. By trusting that you hear what theywant, by feeling secure that you want to fulfill their needs, young childrenmake a good start for trusting Nature later on.Older children are capable of closer and longer observation. They can be taughtthat desire is a mechanism rooted in the heart, that it doesn’t have to bechased in the outside world. The road of our desires is natural—we are led towork for things that bring the deepest fulfillment, that fall in line with ourtalents and abilities. Desire thus becomes its own teacher, showing a child howto follow inner guidance.“Is this what you really want?” is an appropriate question to begin to askchildren in late grade school, and it remains relevant for life. If the answeris yes, then a child needs to learn that her wish is enough to satisfy God;divine intention aligns with human intention when a desire is pure, focused, andin the best interests of one’s spiritual growth. Desires that fail to come truelack one of these ingredients or simply need time."},{"pageContent":"REFLECTIONS ON THE LAW OF INTENTION AND DESIREHonor the good things you want for yourself, since desire is the path to God.Every event that baffles you today had its seed in an intention yesterday.Spirit cannot fulfill any desire until you release it.As specific, clear, and pure as your intention is, just that clear will be theresult brought back to you."},{"pageContent":"FRIDAYis the day of Detachment.Today we tell our children, “Enjoy the journey.”On friday we agree as parents to do the following things with our children: 1.

THE MORE EXPERIMENTS YOU MAKE THE BETTER.RALPH WALDO EMERSONENJOY THE JOURNEY” is a positive expression for an idea that isn’t popular inour society. Words have different values in different cultures, and there is nobetter example than the word detachment. For thousands of years, particularly inthe East, detachment has been a positive word, connoting the ability to findhappiness beyond the play of pleasure and pain. In the West, however, ourintense fixation on achieving material goals has made detachment a negativeword, associated with indifference, apathy, and non-involvement.There is no doubt that the Eastern attitude can degenerate into fatalism andlack of initiative, but in its pure meaning, detachment implies intenseinvolvement and creativity, albeit with surrender of the outcome. Both arenecessary for happiness: passionate involvement gives us the happiness of usingour creativity; surrender recognizes that all outcomes depend upon the universe,not on our bounded ego-selves. A wise man is detached from the drama of thematerial world because he focuses instead on the source from which all dualitiesof light and darkness, good and evil, pleasure and pain actually originate.Because it runs so counter to our cultural bias, detachment is not the easiestprinciple to teach. We can begin with what detachment isn’t.It isn’t detached to say that you don’t care.It isn’t detached to say something isn’t your responsibility when it is.It isn’t detached to ignore the needs and feelings of others.It isn’t detached to constantly look out only for number one.Teaching your children to avoid these things is a good way to begin them on theroad to detachment. Most of the time, we are tempted to be attached tosomething, a condition always labeled with “me” or “mine.” Holding on to mythings, my job, my opinions, my pride, and so forth is the result of fear. Wefear that the universe is cold and indifferent, therefore we contract all ourenergies around this “me” that is supposed to protect us.Ego contraction, however, prevents precisely the free expansion that enables usto find our connection to spirit. This is often described as the differencebetween the self and the Self. The self is the isolated ego clinging to itssmall reality; the Self is the unbounded spirit that can afford not to cling atall.Detachment means that you live from the Self instead of the self.Childhood is the critical time for learning about the Self, for this is theperiod when the ego, and all its needs and fears, starts to develop. When achild simply succumbs to ego, the whole illusion of “I, me, mine” takes hold,and it will be both painful and difficult to break away from in adulthood. Egohas to be tempered with the notion that “I” doesn’t have to be ego; I-ness canbe a sense of oneness with the field of all possibilities—this has been calledcosmic ego. Thus in teaching detachment, you are inviting your children to joinyou in the cosmic dance.Detachment is the perspective that allows us to enjoy the journey of life. Suchenjoyment is critical to success.It would also be good to say a little more about the concept of “detachedinvolvement”—throwing yourself with complete enthusiasm into anything you do,but without expecting to control the outcome. Your responsibility is restrictedto the actions you undertake; the outcome is left in the hands of spirit. Foryoung children, this concept is not really applicable, because it contains aseeming paradox. How can a person be fully involved and detached at the sametime?The answer can only lie in the field of Being. If you see yourself as identifiedwith spirit, then your individual actions fall into a larger pattern. Beinginfinite, this larger pattern—we can call it God’s divine plan—is beyond anyperson’s rational conception. Detachment is how we show that we leave the largerplan to God; involvement is how we show that we want to participate, sincenothing can inspire more passion than to be a co-creator with God.The wisdom of uncertainty is a closely related concept. Uncertainty is fearfulto the ego, which always wants to control reality, but from the viewpoint ofdetachment, a constantly shifting and changing universe must remain uncertain.If things were certain, there could be no creativity. Therefore spirit worksthrough surprises and unexpected outcomes. The divine love of uncertainty atfirst seems to contradict the Law of Karma, which says that everything followscause and effect. But karma isn’t the ultimate reality; it is just the mechanicsof how things work in the relative world. The ultimate reality is the unfoldingof divine creativity. The universe is ultimately a recreational universe; itexists for divine play. The more we realize this, the more we can join the playand be free from all anxiety about how things will turn out. We achieve peace ofmind only when we accept the wisdom of uncertainty.If the universe is uncertain—as Heisenberg’s famous principle assures us—theneverything is possible. We may feel emotionally comfortable with fixed outcomes,but total fixity would be death. In spiritual terms death is not extinction, itis frozen life, energy that has been forced to stay in one place instead offlowing to its next purpose in God’s plan. A complete vision of life mustinclude the realization that anything and everything is destined to happen, andour role is to remain open to uncertainty and surprise.FRIDAY WITH THE CHILDRENThe three activities for Friday involve seeing the world in a more detached way:realizing that the “real you” is spiritual, accepting that uncertainty isinevitable and not to be feared, and being balanced about loss and gain.These lessons are just a beginning—detachment grows on all levels as spirituallife ripens. Altruism and compassion are the natural results of being detached,as is service to others. Replacing pride with humility is a fruit of detachment;so is the condition Christ called “being in the world but not of it.” Myfavorite expression for detachment is that it makes one a citizen of theuniverse. All these things are implied in the simple lessons for today.1. The “real you” is a fascinating topic at any age. Children already feel anage-old attraction to the otherworldly. Stories of God, heaven, and angels aretold to children almost from the cradle; fairy tales create a similar world thatchildren accept as imaginary and yet more real than the world around them. Withthis in mind, you can talk to your children about the Self in understandableways.Here’s the kind of fable, for example, suitable to tell younger children:“Everyone has an invisible friend who looks after everything they do. You havethis friend, and so do your brothers and sisters, and so do Mommy and Daddy. Godsent you your friend. Your friend isn’t in heaven like the angels but righthere, in your heart. You know what your friend’s name is? Just the same as yourname, because your friend is really part of you. When you love your toys or meor anything else, your friend helps you to feel that love. So you always want tomake sure you pay attention whenever you feel sad or angry. Shut your eyes andask your friend to remind you that we all love you very much, so you must alwayslove yourself. That’s what your invisible friend is here to tell you, always.”The Self is a person’s soul, which looks down on all events in this world withperfect peace and joy. It is one’s connection to God and heaven (if you chooseto use those terms) or to the field of all possibilities. Your Self is neverhurt or confused; it always loves you; it is always near. Children will bereassured to hear these things, even though it will be a long time before theybelieve them completely.To identify fully with the Self requires long experience in meditation, since itis out of the silence of inner awareness that the Self is known. Gradually youbegin to realize that this Self isn’t just inside you; it permeates all ofexistence. The infinite complexity of life isn’t graspable by the small self—asdesperately as one might try to believe otherwise, reality isn’t under egocontrol. The Self organizes reality by observing, allowing, accepting, andultimately joining itself with the cosmic intelligence that organizes all ofreality down to the smallest detail.2. There is always a delicate balance between giving children security andteaching them that reality can be very insecure. This is a dilemma all parentsface, and they usually face it anxiously, afraid that they will err on one sideor the other, either instilling false security in their children or going toofar in warning them about danger and risk.Spiritually we have to reconcile these opposing values to feel safe in ashifting, unpredictable world. Uncertainty can’t be wished away; therefore it’sdeeply valuable to come to terms with it, to realize that there is wisdom inuncertainty—the wisdom of a Creator who wants to keep reality fresh, new, andever-moving toward fulfillment.How do we communicate this to a child? Young children love surprises, and thisis the day to fully indulge your delight in surprising them. Unexpected treatsbring joy to giver and receiver, and they need to have no better reason than “Ijust wanted to do something different”—after all, that’s the only reason Godneeds.At older ages, uncertainty can seem to be a problem, since it implies a shiftingworld that is difficult to cope with. Teaching your children to let go and enjoychange as it comes is important, as is direct confrontation of hidden anxiety.With children of five and older, asking if something new is a source of fear isappropriate. All you need is a simple opening like “I know you haven’t done thisbefore. Is it a little scary?”On this day you can also remind yourself not to act in front of the children asif you know everything, as if being an adult means that all questions aresettled. This is a sensitive matter, because children are reassured byauthority. So you need to put your uncertainty in positive terms. Instead ofsaying, “I don’t have an answer,” emphasize that there are a lot of answers andthe fun of life is finding out how much you have yet to learn, no matter howmuch you already know.3. No one likes to lose things, on any level. Children are as distressed by thedeath of a pet or the loss of a toy as adults are by the death of a close friendor the loss of a job. Our grief over loss comes from expectation; we expect thathaving something will make us happier while not having it will make usunhappier. Despite countless cautionary tales that riches don’t buy happiness,all of us still equate money and possessions with well-being.You can begin early to teach your children another way, to look inside ratherthan to outside things for happiness. This is where the lesson of loss and gaincomes in. Treating loss on the material plane alone isn’t satisfying to a child.To say, “Don’t cry, I’ll buy you another doll,” is just as shortsighted as tosay the opposite, “It’s your fault for losing it, you’re not getting another.”Both statements assume that the doll is the source of happiness. You are goingto have to decide whether or not to replace something that’s been lost, but thelarger issue is that the doll doesn’t matter. Make children feel secure andloved no matter what anyone has or doesn’t have. Thus loss can be a reason toreinforce the notion that “the real you” is all right no matter what. Allow thegrieving over loss to occur—you shouldn’t stand in the way of emotionalexpression—but put it in perspective: “I know you feel bad now, but it’s only athing, and you are here for much more important reasons than the things you ownor don’t own.”What are these reasons? In difficult situations, after the emotion has come andgone, you might say something like:“You are here to be special, because you are special.”“You are here to find out all kinds of things.”“You are here for Mommy and Daddy to love you and take care of you.”“You are here to make yourself happy in all kinds of ways.”Each statement touches on the notion that “I” am unique, creative, loved, notharmed by loss. Crying over a lost doll isn’t the same as losing part ofyourself—but you’d be surprised how many children don’t realize this simpletruth because their parents fail to remind them of it.In this way the whole matter of loss and gain gets treated at the same time.Countless people grow up thinking that their problems will be solved as soon asthey have enough of something—money, fame, status, et cetera. But loss and gainalways come in cycles. Ultimately this holds true for life and death, which areforever pursuing each other in the cycle of birth and rebirth.Detachment is the quality that enables a person to feel unmoved by either lossor gain. Neither affects the Self; the Self is always full. It always getsenough love and happiness from its source to satisfy it. Teach this to yourchildren, constantly focusing on the fact that this same source of love andhappiness is always available. The spiritual journey is an unfolding of how muchmore secure the Self is than the self."},{"pageContent":"REFLECTIONS ON THE LAW OF DETACHMENTDetachment means being passionate about your work but dispassionate about itsrewards.Any name or label you identify yourself with is false—the real you is unboundedand nameless, beyond all labels.Trusting in yourself, not what you accomplish, is the key to success.Put yourself in the hands of the universe—then you will have no need forcontrol.Self-acceptance leads to success, not the other way around."},{"pageContent":"SATURDAYis the day of “Dharma.”Today we tell our children, “You are here for a reason.”On saturday we agree as parents to do the following things with our children: 1.

In asense the day of dharma is the day of law, the fulfillment of a whole weekdevoted to spiritual laws. On this day we reflect on how well we have followedspiritual law, how attuned our existence actually is to the harmony of theuniverse.Today we remind our children, “You are here for a reason.” Spiritual law is hereto serve us as we serve it. It serves us by showing that lasting happiness andfulfillment are possible, indeed inevitable. There is a hidden purpose workingfor our evolution in every event, every action, every thought. The highest goalin life is to find this purpose and live by it.On this day we measure our success according to how fulfilled the week has been,how much ease and opportunity it has brought, what new inspirations and insightshave come our way. Then we reflect these things onto our children. The beliefthat life is unfair seems valid only because we experience the unloving behaviorof others, who cannot always share the high levels of consciousness that spiritis trying to inspire.Purpose is activated only when you have receptivity. Awareness is the key toachieving what the universe has planned for you.In the family you can reinforce that life is always fair. The dharma ensuresthis through the force of spiritual law. To say that life is unfair is to implythat it is random, meaningless, capricious, and dangerous. In other words, thatit is without spiritual law. So on this day you can counter all such impressionsby showing how fair life really is, and what makes it fair is that we areallowed free will to express ourselves with every ounce of creative power at ourdisposal.SATURDAY WITH THE CHILDRENThe three activities for Saturday center on life’s purpose as it is unfoldingfor a child. Ask your children, “Where are you right now?,” encourage eachchild’s uniqueness, and invite your children to perform an act of service.1. The question “Where are you?” is your way of exploring your children’s ownideas of their purpose and progress. One’s dharma is one’s path, whichtranslates into several components: * Where I think I’m going. This is my vision. * How I plan to get there. This is my work on the path. * How far I think I’ve gotten. This is my level of awareness. * What I think is holding me back. This is my present challenge or lesson.To be complete, dharma must contain all these ingredients. A vision without ameans of traveling the path is only a fantasy. Hard work and achievement withouta vision are talent being emptied into the sand. Not all these ingredients needto be verbalized every day; a vision, for example, is usually strongest at theoutset, giving place to the work and obstacles that arise in order to make thevision real.Even so, it’s good to have your children learn to be aware of their paths. Theyoungest children have an instinctive purpose, being happy. But as soon as achild is old enough to set goals—after age five or six—measuring progress towarda goal is a necessity. “Where are you? How are things going? Are you gettingclose to what you want to achieve? If not, why not?” With these questions inmind, parents can begin to encourage each child to feel an intimate connectionwith life’s purpose day in and day out.You can also broaden this topic by asking, “Where are we as a family?” Manyfamilies would cringe from asking such a question, because they do not haveenough openness and intimacy and trust for answers to come out honestly. Or theparents are too attached to seeming to have all the answers.From an early age you need to teach your children that expressing how they feelabout family matters is all right. The same holds for saying honestly if theirpersonal wishes aren’t coming true. Many desires don’t come true, at least notimmediately; disappointment, discouragement, and frustration are spiritualrealities that children do not need to hide from. No path is without itsobstacles, and although an obstacle may feel negative on the emotional level,the Law of “Dharma” tells us that some good is hidden within every block. Dharmais universal law; it upholds us in where we need to be. So the ultimate answerto the question “Where are you right now?” is “Just where I need to be.”To give that answer implies great security, and it is this security you want toreinforce with your children. As individuals, we lack the vision to see aroundevery corner in the road; it is not in Nature’s way to open up the completevista, given that surprise and uncertainty are built into the divine plan.Of course, children are easily frustrated when things don’t go exactly right,and it is a lifelong process to become patient and make peace with the notionthat every person is just where she needs to be.2. Making a child feel unique means making him or her feel uniquely wanted.Having a talent is one thing; feeling that the universe welcomes it is another.Uniqueness without love is barren and very little different from loneliness.Today you can sit down and list each child’s talents, having your childrenparticipate, in order to reinforce the notion that talents are given to us byspirit for our happiness and fulfillment.3. Invite each child to do something kind for someone else, however small thegesture might be. Picking up litter seen while taking a hike, opening a door foran older person, helping younger siblings pick up their room—these are asvaluable as charity work. The inner meaning of the gesture is what you want toteach. Helping someone else feels good in a way that just doing something foryourself doesn’t—this is the kernel of what you want to impart, not just thatservice is virtuous or makes a person look good to others (which is too oftenthe motive for adults).Serving others fits nicely with the notion that uniqueness is everywhere. Whenyou serve others, you have an opportunity to appreciate their worth; serviceexpresses this appreciation directly. Having a child do nice things for ayounger brother or sister or friend leads directly to a sense of how specialthat friend, brother, or sister is. In this way specialness gets accepted as aquality everyone has.When you serve others, you remind yourself of your duty as a loving child of theAlmighty. Duty is a synonym for dharma, and the word covers duty to society,duty to oneself, and duty to God. Your duty to society is to serve others; yourduty to yourself is to unfold spiritually; your duty to God is to participate inthe divine plan for humankind’s higher evolution.As parents, we are not teaching our children hard-and-fast rules that must beheeded. We are inviting them into our own journey, into our sense of purpose,which never ends. It is a journey of ever-expanding meaning. Although very youngchildren may not be able to understand what this means in words, your child caneasily sense whether you find life exciting and wondrous. Your sense of purposein the universe speaks far louder than any words."},{"pageContent":"REFLECTIONS ON THE LAW OF “DHARMA”A life of purpose reveals the purpose of life.You can never be wrong about destiny. Whether you succeed or not, you are provento be right.The universe has a purpose—the fulfillment of human creativity and happiness.Don’t judge your life. Every life is a step toward unity with God.Don’t struggle to find out why you are here—just look closer."},{"pageContent":"CONCLUSIONTHE ONE THING YOU CANNOT DO WITHOUTAS A PARENT, what is the one thing you cannot do without? Most people wouldautomatically say “love,” which is certainly right. But then you have to ask adeeper question, “Where does love come from?” By itself, the bond of love isn’tenough, because it frays and sometimes breaks. We all raise our childrenaccording to what we call love; yet today’s young people still have horrendousproblems.Deeper than love, the one thing you can’t do without is innocence. Innocence isthe source of love. Innocence, as I am defining it here, isn’t naïveté. Quitethe opposite. Innocence is openness. It is based on a deep spiritual knowledgeof several critical issues.Innocence is the knowledge that you can guide children but never control them.You must be open to the person within every child, a person who is bound to bedifferent from you. In innocence, this fact can be accepted with a peacefulheart.Innocence is the knowledge that life is never certain. Your children areguaranteed to go in directions you cannot predict, to do things you would neverdo. Uncertainty is a given, because life is nothing but change. In innocence youcan accept this—you will let go of your need to make your children conform toyour preconceived notions.Innocence is the knowledge that love is deeper than surface events. On thesurface, a child’s journey is wayward and difficult. We all want to teach ourchildren those lessons we found were the hardest to learn; we want to protectthem from unnecessary pain. But in innocence we realize that the surface of lifeis a distraction from the deeper journey every person must make. This is thejourney of soul-making. Soul-making happens under the watchful eye of spirit. Wecan help our children realize the essential importance of their souls, but wearen’t responsible for the journey. That is a unique agreement made betweenevery person and his or her higher Self.If I were to take all these points and put them into a single sentence, thiswould be it: Innocence is the knowledge that your child is yours and yet notyours. Everyone is ultimately a child of spirit. We all grew up belonging to afamily, but this is a very loose kind of belonging. Mostly we belong toourselves, which means to our spirit or soul or essence.Thus to see a child with real love means to see this spark of the divine. It’seasy to say that every child is unique and precious, but what really makes ittrue is innocence, being able to look at a child as a soul embarked on thejourney of soul-making. This means giving up some deeply imprinted patternsabout parenting.Parents are used to being authority figures. As such, we are above and beyondour children—smarter, more powerful, more experienced, in command of money andproperty. From this position of authority, parents have been able to passjudgment, to inflict punishment, to lay down the rules of right and wrong, andto do so with a clear sense of duty and purpose.This book has outlined a different duty and purpose. In this new vision, aparent isn’t an authority. You and your child are both souls; you are bothembarked on the journey of soul-making. The only difference is the roles youhave chosen. All souls are immortal; they cannot be created or destroyed. But wedo choose temporary roles to play.The most good you can do for yourself spiritually is to play your role as parentwith total love, conviction, and purpose. The reason you undertook the role ofparent was ultimately selfish—in the best spiritual sense. This is the role thatwill uplift and inspire you more than any other. The same is true for yourchild. As an all-knowing, immortal spirit, your child has decided to be a weak,vulnerable infant, totally dependent upon your help. That is the role a childplays, with total conviction and dedication. And yet both of you, if you stripaway the role playing, are pure souls, equal and as one. Innocence enables youto see this, to play the role yet go beyond it.Some people may argue against this whole notion, but I think every parent hashad moments when the look in a child’s eye told a tale of infinite wisdom, ofexperiences that go far beyond this particular moment in time and space. I knowthis has been true with my own children. I’ve put them to bed, read stories tothem, thrown a ball around with them, and sat proudly through dance recitals.The whole time I was doing this, I was the daddy and they were the kids.But there have been other, rarer moments when the whole facade fell away. I’veseen my son give me a glance that said, “Here we are again. What an interestinggame we’re playing this time.” I’ve seen my daughter smile in such a way that Ijust knew she was on the verge of laughing out loud at the masks we have put onto keep our roles alive.In those precious glances and smiles I felt the bond of innocence, which is morepowerful than love because it transcends love. Instead of just being here as aunit with its own private triumphs and failures, every family is a communion ofsouls. What we have in common isn’t where we live, what schools we go to, orwhat we do for a living. We are sailing the seas of immortality together—that isthe real bond. When you can see past the role playing and still act your rolewith love and dedication, then I believe you are truly spiritual in yourapproach to parenting.Finally, the Seven Spiritual Laws are just ways of making this happen. Theyremind us how to keep the innocence flowing. There’s a lot in this world thatcan destroy innocence and precious little that keeps it flowing. I don’t lookupon spiritual law as optional—this is how the universe works as it unfolds frompure, unmanifest Being to the infinite variety of the created world. If you livein tune with spiritual laws, you will be in harmony with the unlimitedintelligence of Being. As parents, then, what we teach our children is nodifferent from what we must keep teaching ourselves.Keep the innocence flowing. It all depends on that."},{"pageContent":"Deepak Chopra and Infinite Possibilities International offer a wide range ofseminars, products, and educational programmes.
