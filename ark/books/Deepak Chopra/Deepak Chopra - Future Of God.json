The all-embracing holistic quantum fieldis a step forward from our classical reductionistic interpretation of adetermined ‘reality.’ It suggests a dynamic, alive cosmos, or ‘Wirklichkeit.’Dr. Chopra’s work will be talked about for a long time to come.”—HANS PETER DUERR, scientific member and director emeritus of Max PlanckInstitute for Physics and Astrophysics“As Deepak explains, Dawkins’s materialism is the delusion, not God. Easternspiritualists, Western constructivists, and quantum physicists agree—the mindshapes, if not creates, the world. Materialism is a mirage of deeper levelquantum reality, one which surfaces in living systems, guiding consciousness andevolution. The ‘Watchmaker’ isn’t blind. Dawkins is.”—STUART HAMEROFF, M.D., professor of anesthesiology and psychology director ofthe Center for Consciousness Studies at the University of Arizona,www.quantumconsciousness.org [http://www.quantumconsciousness.org]“The Future of God is a brilliant exposition for the need of consciousness-basedreality. It is consistent with the worldview of quantum physics that showed theimportance of the mind and is a fitting answer to the claims of militantatheists whose science is based on outdated views now known to not be true andwhich became obsolete almost a century ago.”—MENAS C. KAFATOS, Fletcher Jones Professor of Computational Physics at ChapmanUniversity and coauthor of The Non-Local Universe: The New Physics and Mattersof the Mind“A magnificent and masterfully argued presentation of why randomness can neverexplain the great mystery of life on earth. This wonderfully accessible book isa must-read for anyone who, much like Einstein and other pioneers of the newphysics did, experiences a feeling of utter humility when contemplating thegrandeur of the cosmos.”—P. MURALI DORAISWAMY, professor of psychiatry and member of the Duke Institutefor Brain Sciences“Deepak Chopra has successfully blended ancient Vedanta philosophy with hisunique perspective on modern science to provide a vast audience with solutionsthat meet many needs for our modern age. He is among the influential scholars,authors, and thinkers who have found truth in the Perennial philosophy anddeveloped ways to help people apply that truth to their daily lives.”—HUSTON SMITH, author of Why Religion Matters: The Fate of the Human Spirit inan Age of Disbelief“The most transformative discoveries begin with delusion, are challenged byinsight, driven by faith, pursued with science, and culminate in truth. DeepakChopra beautifully makes the case that the biggest delusion is a universewithout God or consciousness.”—RUDY TANZI, coauthor of the New York Times bestseller Super Brain“At a time when the revolutions of the physical sciences are changing ourunderstanding of the human consciousness, The Future of God is a book thatneeded to be written, and no one could have written it better than DeepakChopra. In this brilliant analysis, Chopra shows how God is evolving with ourconsciousness, and how both the religious and atheistic fundamentalists arefocused on an outdated God. This book is a treasure of deep insights that willnot only touch your heart but will also lead you to understand how a God withoutillusions is a necessary condition for your physical well-being.”—LOTHAR SCHÄFER, distinguished professor of physical chemistry (emeritus) at theUniversity of Arkansas and author of Infinite Potential“In The Future of God, Deepak Chopra crisply dissects the militant atheist’sassertion that there is no meaning or purpose to life, and no need for faith inan accidental universe. He lays bare the belief vs. disbelief controversy andprovides sound reasons why it is both possible and necessary to mature beyondthe simplistic dogmas that have sustained a timeworn and increasingly futiledebate.”—DEAN RADIN, PH.D., author of The Conscious Universe and Supernormal“The Future of God is a much-needed book. Chopra convincingly exposes thelimitations, arrogance, and intellectual blindness of the ‘new atheists.’ Herecognizes that unbelief has a role to play, but he also shows how to go beyondthe atheists’ narrow dogmatism to a far richer experience and understanding ofreality.”—RUPERT SHELDRAKE, PH.D., author of Science Set Free“The Future of God is the freshest riposte yet in response to the chest-beating,triumphal, militant atheism that can’t stop congratulating itself for imaginaryvictories over traditional religion. Dr. Chopra shows how this tiresome movementis based in bad philosophy, bad science, and bad psychology, and how it is miredin abysmal confusion about what authentic spirituality is all about. He showshow militant atheism, through sleight of hand, merely substitutes one blindfaith for another, managing to fool itself in the process. In The Future of God,Dr. Chopra describes an approach to God that is congruent with a modernworldview, while simultaneously honoring the innate human connection with theDivine.”—LARRY DOSSEY, M.D., author of One Mind: How Our Individual Mind Is Part of aGreater Consciousness and Why It Matters“The continuing struggle between two worldviews, one religious, the otherscientific, has confused the Western mind enormously. In this book the visionaryDeepak Chopra has taken on the task of a ‘guide for the perplexed’ as only hecan. The Future of God is important for two reasons. First, and this ismarvelous, Deepak has done a wonderful job of debunking the so-called debunkers,people like Richard Dawkins, who, it seems, cannot even distinguish betweenpopular and esoteric aspects of religion. The latter is about spirituality,which has found new support from quantum physics and other recent breakthroughsin science. The second reason for the book’s importance is that it really is areliable guide to why and how you can seek God in even these confusing times.”—AMIT GOSWAMI, quantum physicist and author of The Self-Aware Universe, TheQuantum Doctor, and How Quantum Activism Can Save Civilization"},{"pageContent":"BESTSELLERS BY DEEPAK CHOPRAAgeless Body, Timeless MindThe Book of SecretsBuddha: A Story of EnlightenmentGrow Younger, Live Longer (with coauthor David Simon)How to Know GodJesus: A Story of EnlightenmentLife After DeathMuhammad: A Story of a ProphetThe Path to LovePeace Is the WayPerfect HealthQuantum HealingReinventing the Body, Resurrecting the SoulThe Return of MerlinThe Seven Spiritual Laws of SuccessThe Shadow Effect (with coauthors Debbie Ford and Marianne Williamson)Spiritual SolutionsSuper Brain (with coauthor Rudolph E.

For thousands of years religion has asked us to accept onfaith a loving God who knows everything and possesses all power. As a result,history has walked a long and sometimes tumultuous road. There have been momentsof great elation interspersed with unspeakable horrors in the name of religion.But today, in the West at least, the age of faith has drastically waned. Formost people, religion is simply taken for granted. There is no living connectionwith God. Meanwhile, unbelief has been rising. How could it not?Once you expose the unhealed rift between ourselves and God, a deep kind ofdisappointment rises to the surface. We’ve gone through too many catastrophes totrust in a benign, loving deity. Who can ponder the Holocaust or 9/11 andbelieve that God is love? Countless other heartbreaks come to mind. If you probeinto what is really going on when people think about God, their comfort zonewith religion shrinks. They harbor a nagging sense of doubt and insecurity.For a long time, the burden of faith has rested on the imperfect believer. IfGod doesn’t intervene to relieve suffering or bestow peace, the fault must be inus. In this book I’ve reversed things, putting the burden back on God. It istime to ask some blunt questions.What has God done for you lately?In supporting yourself and your family, which is more effective, having faith orworking hard?Have you ever really surrendered and let God solve a really tough problem foryou?Why does God allow such suffering in the world? Is this all a game or an emptypromise that a loving God exists?These questions are so troublesome that we avoid asking them, and for millionsof people, they aren’t even important anymore. The next technology that willimprove our lives is always on the horizon. A God who matters in thetwenty-first century is all but extinct.As I see it, the real crisis in faith isn’t about declining church attendance, atrend that began in Western Europe and the United States during the 1950s andcontinues today. The real crisis is about finding a God who matters and can betrusted. Faith presents a fork in the road, and all of us have come to it. Onefork leads to a reality upheld by a living God; the other leads to a realitywhere God is not just absent but a fiction. In the name of this fiction, humanbeings have fought and died, tortured infidels, mounted bloody crusades, andperformed every imaginable horror.There’s a heartrending show of cynicism in the New Testament when Jesus is onthe cross—a slow and agonizing way to die—and the bystanders spit with mockery,including the chief priests of Jerusalem:“He saved others,” they said, “but he can’t save himself! He’s the King ofIsrael! Let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him. Hetrusted God, so let God rescue him now if he wants him!” (Matthew 27:42–43)The vitriol in those words hasn’t diminished over time, but there’s a moreunsettling point. Jesus taught that people should trust in God completely, thatfaith can move mountains. He taught that no one should toil today or save up fortomorrow, because Providence will provide everything. Leaving aside the mysticalmeaning of the Crucifixion, should you and I have that kind of trust?If people only knew it, they reach a fork in the road many times a day. I’m notwriting from a Christian perspective—I practice no organized religion in mypersonal life—but Jesus didn’t mean that Providence will supply money, food,shelter, and many other blessings if only you wait long enough. He meant thismorning’s food and tonight’s shelter. “Ask and you will receive; knock and thedoor will be opened” applies to choices we make in the present moment. And thisgreatly raises the stakes, because if God is disappointing for all the times hehasn’t come through for us, we are disappointing for all the times we have takenthe road of unbelief—literally every hour of the day.The seed of unbelief is in all of us. It offers plenty of reasons not to havefaith. I hope as a compassionate human being I would have looked at thespectacle of a crucifixion and felt pity. But when it comes to my own life, I goto work, save for the future, and look over my shoulder at night on a dangerousstreet. I put more faith in myself than I do in an external God. I call this thezero point, the nadir of faith. At the zero point, God doesn’t really matter,not when it comes down to the tough business of living. Viewed from the zeropoint, God is either pointless or feeble. He may look down on our suffering andfeel moved, or just as likely he may greet suffering with a shrug.For God to have a future, we must escape the zero point and find a new way ofliving spiritually. We don’t need new religions, better scriptures, or moreinspiring testimony to God’s greatness. The versions we already have are goodenough (and bad enough). A God worthy of faith must actually matter, and I don’tsee how he can until he starts to perform instead of disappoint.Making such a radical change involves something equally radical: a totalrethinking of reality. What people fail to realize is that when you challengeGod, you challenge reality itself. If reality is only what appears on thesurface, then there is nothing to have faith in. We can stay glued to the 24/7news cycle and do our best to cope. Yet if reality is something that extendsinto higher dimensions, the story changes. You can’t rebuild a God who neverexisted, but you can repair a broken connection.I decided to write a book about how to reconnect with God so that he becomes asreal as a loaf of bread and as reliable as a sunrise—choose anything you trustin and know to be real. If such a God exists, there’s no longer a reason to bedisappointed either in him or in ourselves. Nothing like a leap of faith isrequired. Yet something deeper must be done, a reconsideration of what ispossible. This implies an inner transformation. If someone tells you “Thekingdom of heaven is within,” you shouldn’t think, with a twinge of guilt, Notin me it isn’t. You should ask what it would take to make the statement true.The spiritual path begins with a curiosity that something as unbelievable as Godmight actually exist.Millions of people have now heard about “the God delusion,” a slogan from a bandof militant atheists who are avowed enemies of faith. This disturbing movementcentered around Professor Richard Dawkins cloaks its vehement, often personalattacks in terms of science and reason. Even if people don’t apply the wordatheist to themselves, many are still living as if God doesn’t matter, and thisaffects the choices they make in their daily lives. Unbelief has implicitly wonwhere it counts.Faith, if it is to survive, can only be restored through a deeper exploration ofthe mystery of existence.I have no harsh things to say about atheism without the militancy. ThomasJefferson wrote, “I do not find in orthodox Christianity one redeeming feature,”but he also helped found a society based on tolerance. Dawkins and company areproud to be intolerant. Atheism can be humorous about itself, as when GeorgeBernard Shaw quipped, “Christianity might be a good thing if anyone ever triedit.” Every strain of thought has its opposite, and when it comes to God,unbelief is the natural opposite of belief.It’s not right, however, to suppose that atheism is always opposed to God.According to a paradoxical 2008 Pew Research survey, 21 percent of Americans whodescribe themselves as atheists believe in God or a universal spirit, 12 percentbelieve in heaven, and 10 percent pray at least once a week. Atheists have notentirely lost faith; there’s nothing in that to judge against. But Dawkinsproffers spiritual nihilism with a smile and a tone of reassurance. I realizedthat I had to speak out against this, even though I feel no personal animusagainst him.Faith must be saved for everyone’s sake. From faith springs a passion for theeternal, which is even stronger than love. Many of us have lost that passion orhave never known it. As I argue for God, I wish that I could instill the urgencyexpressed in just a few lines from Mirabai, an Indian princess who became agreat mystic poet:The love that binds me to you, O Lord,is unbreakableLike a diamond that smashes the hammerwhen it is struck.Like the lotus rising from the watermy life rises from you,Like the night bird gazing at the passing moonI am lost dwelling on you.O my beloved—come back!In any age, faith is like this: a cry from the heart. If you are determined tobelieve that God doesn’t exist, there’s no chance that these pages will convinceyou that he does. The path is never closed, however. If faith can be saved, theresult will be an increase in hope. By itself, faith can’t deliver God, but itdoes something more timely: It makes God possible."},{"pageContent":"WHY GOD HAS A FUTUREWhen it comes to God, almost all of us, believers and nonbelievers alike, sufferfrom a kind of nearsightedness. We see—and hence believe—only what’s right infront of us. The faithful see God as a benign parental figure bestowing graceand justice as he judges our actions here down below. The rest of us think Godis far more distant, impersonal, and uninvolved. Yet God may be closer and moreinvolved than that, closer than breathing, in fact.At any given moment, someone in the world is amazed to find that the Godexperience is real. Wonder and certainty still dawn. I keep at hand a passagefrom Thoreau’s Walden about this, where he speaks of “the solitary hired man ona farm in the outskirts of Concord, who has had his second birth.” Like us,Thoreau wonders if someone’s testimony about having a “peculiar religiousexperience” is valid. In answer, he looks across the span of centuries:Zoroaster, thousands of years ago, travelled the same road and had the sameexperience, but he, being wise, knew it to be universal.If you find yourself suddenly infused with an experience you cannot explain,Thoreau says, just be aware that you are not alone. Your awakening is woven intothe great tradition.Humbly commune with Zoroaster then, and, through the liberalizing influence ofall the worthies, with Jesus Christ himself, let “our church” go by the board.In contemporary language, Thoreau is advising us to trust our deepest beliefthat spiritual experience is real. Skeptics turn this advice on its head. Thefact that God has been experienced over the ages only goes to show that religionis a primitive holdover, a mental relic that we should train our brains toreject. To a skeptic, God persisted in the past because priests had the power toenforce faith, allowing no deviations among their followers. But all attempts toclarify matters—to say, once and for all, that God is absolutely real orabsolutely unreal—continue to fail. The muddle persists, and we all have feltthe impact of confusion and doubt.WHERE ARE YOU NOW?Let’s move from the abstract to the personal. When you look at yourself and askwhere you stand on the God issue, you are almost certainly in one of thefollowing situations:Unbelief: You don’t accept that God is real, and you express your unbelief byliving as if God makes no difference.Faith: You hope that God is real, and you express your hope as faith.Knowledge: You have no doubt that God is real, and therefore you live as if Godis always present.When someone becomes a spiritual seeker, they want to move from unbelief toknowledge. The path is by no means clear, however. When you get out of bed inthe morning, what is the spiritual thing to do? Should you try to live in thepresent moment, for example, which is considered very spiritual? Peace residesin the present moment, if it resides anywhere. And yet Jesus outlines howradical such a decision actually is: “Therefore I tell you, do not worry aboutyour life, what you will eat or what you will drink, or about your body.… Butstrive first for the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these thingswill be given to you as well. So do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow willbring worries of its own.” (Matthew 6:25, 33–34)In Jesus’s version, living in the present implies having complete trust in Godto provide everything. His confidence in God is unlimited. Whatever Jesus needswill come. But what about the poor Jewish workers who were his audience,struggling to provide the bare necessities, grimly living under the thumb ofRoman oppression? They might have hoped that Providence would care for them;they might even have had enough faith to believe it. Still, surrendering was amystical act. Only Jesus was in a state of consciousness that was totallygrounded in Providence, because he saw God everywhere.In all of us there are seeds of unbelief, because we were born in a secular agethat questions everything mystical. Better to be free and skeptical than boundby myths, superstition, and dogma. When you touch the skeptic inside you,unbelief is a reasonable state to be in. But for most people it’s also anunhappy state. They feel unfulfilled in a totally secular world where thedeepest worship, arguably, goes to sports heroes, comic books, and having aperfect body. Science gives us no assurance that life has meaning when itdescribes the universe as a cold void ruled by random chance.And so faith persists. We want the universe to be our home. We want to feelconnected to creation. Above all, we don’t want freedom if it means enduringperpetual anxiety and insecurity, a freedom that has lost its moorings to themeaning of life. So whether you call it clinging to faith or abiding by thetraditions of our forefathers, religious belief exists everywhere. For billionsof human beings there is no livable alternative.But what about the third stage, after unbelief and faith—certain knowledge ofGod—which is the rarest and most elusive? To be truly certain, a person may haveto undergo a transformative experience or miraculously retain the innocent soulof a young child. Neither is all that realistic in most lives. People who returnfrom near-death experiences, which are extremely rare to begin with, have nohard evidence about “going into the light” that would convince a skeptic. Whathas changed for them is private, internal, and subjective. As for the innocenceof children, we have good reason for abandoning it. Childhood joy is a naïve,unformed state, and as happy as it was, we yearn to experience a wider world ofachievement. The creative heights of human history are reached by adults, notovergrown infants.Let’s say that you recognize yourself in one of these three states: unbelief,faith, and knowledge. It’s quite all right if they are jumbled and you havepassing moments of each. According to cold statistical models, most of uscluster under the middle hump of a bell-shaped curve, part of the vast majoritythat believes in God. At the tail end of the curve are a tiny minority: to theleft, the confirmed atheists; to the right, the deeply religious who pursue Godas their vocation. But it’s fair to say that most people who respond that theybelieve in God aren’t experiencing either wonder or certainty. Typically, wedevote our days to everything but God: raising a family, looking for love,striving for success, reaching for more material goods on the endless conveyorbelt of consumerism.The current muddle is doing no one any good. Unbelief is haunted by innersuffering and a dread that life has no purpose. (I’m not persuaded by atheistswho claim to live cheerfully in a random universe. They aren’t waking up everymorning to say, “How wonderful, another day when nothing really has meaning.”)The state of faith is untenable in a different way: Throughout history it hasled to rigidity, fanaticism, and desperate violence in the name of God. And thestate of true knowledge? It seems to be the province of saints, who areexceedingly rare.Yet God is hidden somewhere, as a shadow presence, in all three situations,whether as a negative (the deity you are fleeing when you walk away fromorganized religion) or as a positive (a higher reality that you aspire to).Being faintly present isn’t the same as being truly important, much less themost important thing in existence. If it is possible to make God real again, Ithink everyone would agree to try.This book proposes that you can move from unbelief to faith and then to trueknowledge. Each is an evolutionary stage, and by exploring the first, you findthat the next one opens. Evolution is voluntary when it applies to the innerworld. There is complete freedom of choice. Once you know unbelief in everydetail, you can remain there or move on to faith. Once you explore faith, youcan do the same, accepting it as your spiritual home or looking beyond. At theend of the journey lies knowledge of God, which is just as viable—and much morereal—than the first two stages. To know God isn’t mystical, any more thanknowing that the Earth moves around the Sun. In both cases, a fact isestablished, and all previous doubts and errant beliefs naturally fall away."},{"pageContent":"GOD IS A VERB, NOT A NOUNFaith has become almost impossible to enforce, especially on yourself. Our oldmodel of God is being dismantled before our eyes. Instead of trying to pick upthe pieces, a deeper shift must take place. Reason, personal experience, and thewisdom of many cultures are coming together already. This new synthesis is likeGod 2.0, where human evolution takes a leap in matters of the spirit.God 1.0 reflected human needs, which are many and varied, and these needs tookon a divine personification. The needs came first. Because humans need securityand safety, we projected God as our divine protector. Because life needs to beorderly, we made God the supreme lawgiver. Reversing the Book of Genesis, wecreated God in our own image. He did what we wanted him to do. What follows arethe seven stages we fashioned for such a God.GOD 1.0MADE IN OUR IMAGE1. The need for safety, security, protection from harmGod becomes a father or mother. He controls the forces of nature, bringing goodor bad fortune. Humans live like children under God’s protection. His thoughtsare unknowable; he acts on a whim to dispense love or punishment. Nature isorderly but is still dangerous.This is your God if you pray for rescue, view the divine as an authority figure,believe in sin and redemption, crave miracles, and see God’s hand at work whenaccident or disaster suddenly strikes.2. The need to accomplish and achieveGod becomes a lawgiver. He sets down rules and follows them. This allows thefuture to be knowable: God will reward those who follow the law and punish thosewho disobey. On this foundation, human beings can build a good life and achievematerial success. The secret is hard work, which pleases God, and a society thatis lawful, which mirrors the laws of nature. Chaos is overcome; crime is held atbay. Nature exists to be tamed rather than feared.This is your God if you believe that God is reasonable, wants you to succeed,rewards hard work, separates right from wrong, and has created the universe towork according to laws and principles.3. The need to bond, to form loving families and communitiesGod becomes a loving presence inside every heart. The worshipper’s gaze hasturned inward. Bonding with others goes beyond mutual survival. Humankind is acommunity joined together by faith. God wants us to build a city on the hill, anideal society. Nature exists to nourish human happiness.This is your God if you are an idealist, optimistic about human nature, abeliever in common humanity, and open to be loved by a forgiving deity.Forgiveness will be felt inside, not delivered by a priest.4. The need to be understoodGod becomes nonjudgmental. To know all is to forgive all. The wound in humannature that divides good from evil starts to heal. Tolerance increases. Wedevelop empathy for wrongdoers, because God shows us his empathy. The need forstrict reward and punishment lessens. Life has many shades of good and bad, andeverything has its reasons. Nature exists to show us the full range of life inits most creative and most destructive form.This is your God if he understands rather than judges, if you see yourselfsympathetically because God does, if you accept good and evil as inevitableaspects of creation, if God tells you that you are understood.5. The need to create, discover, and exploreGod becomes a creative source. He gave us our birthright of curiosity. Heremains unknowable, but he unfolds one secret after another in creation. At thefar edge of the universe, the unknown is a challenge and a source of wonder. Godwants us not to worship but to evolve. Our role is to discover and explore.Nature exists to provide endless mysteries that challenge our intelligence—thereis always more to discover.This is your God if you live to explore and be creative, if you feel happiestconfronting the unknown, if you have total confidence that nature can beunraveled, including human nature, as long as we keep questioning and neversettle for fixed, preordained truth.6. The need for moral guidance and inspirationGod becomes pure wonder. After reason has reached the limits of understanding,the mystery remains. Sages, saints, and the divinely inspired have penetratedit. They have felt a divine presence that transcends everyday life. Materialismis an illusion. Creation was fashioned in two layers, the visible and theinvisible. Miracles become real when everything is a miracle. To reach God, onemust accept the reality of invisible things. Nature is a mask for the divine.This is your God if you are a spiritual seeker. You want to know what liesbehind the mask of materialism, to find the source of healing, to experiencepeace, and to be in direct contact with a divine presence.7. Unity, the state beyond all needsGod becomes One. There is complete fulfillment because you have reached the goalof seeking. You experience the divine everywhere. The last hint of separationhas vanished. You have no need to divide saint from sinner, because God imbueseverything. In this state, you don’t know the truth; you become it. The universeand every event in it are expressions of a single underlying Being, which ispure awareness, pure intelligence, and pure creativity. Nature is the outwardform that consciousness takes as it unfolds in time and space.This is your God if you feel totally connected to your soul and your source.Your consciousness has expanded to embrace a cosmic perspective. You seeeverything happening in the mind of God. The ecstasy of great mystics, who seemespecially gifted or chosen, now becomes available to you, because you havefully matured spiritually.The God that brings the scheme to an end, God as One, is different from theothers. He isn’t a projection. He signifies a state of total certainty andwonder, and if you can reach that state, you are no longer projecting. Everyneed has been fulfilled; the path has ended with reality itself.Looking at the list, you may not identify with any need that God might fulfill.That’s understandable when belief is a muddle. No version of God is strongenough to win your allegiance. The muddle is also rooted in how the brainprocesses choices. When you are deciding in a restaurant whether to order asalad or a greasy cheeseburger, separate groups of neurons in the cerebralcortex organize your choice. One group promotes ordering a salad, the otherpromotes having a cheeseburger. You are making up your mind.But at the same time, each neuronal group sends out chemical signals to suppressthe activity of the other. This phenomenon, known as “cross-inhibition,” isbeing newly studied by brain researchers. The basic notion is a familiar one: Insports, the fans root for their team and boo the other team. In every armedconflict, soldiers are told that God is on their side but not the other.Us-versus-them thinking probably has a deep brain connection. Referring tospiritual doubts, the idea of a loving Father cross-inhibits the idea of apunishing Father. Each one has its rationale, and each diminishes the other. Aloving father should love all his children equally, yet every people favored byGod have suffered without cause. God’s behavior is as erratic as our own, sothat any reason to worship one kind of God is inhibited by a competingversion—seven competing versions, in fact.If God 1.0 is a projection, does that mean God doesn’t exist? Has another nailbeen driven into his coffin? Not necessarily. The fact that Richard Dawkins andcompany reject God doesn’t mean that their view is complete or true. Ask ateenager to describe his parents, and you’ll get an unreliable description. Asan adolescent, he has a muddled view of what parents are like. It mixes achild’s need for love, security, and protection with an adult’s need forindependence, self-reliance, and self-hood. When the two sides meet, theycross-inhibit each other. No one would take a teenager’s criticism of hisparents at full faith, much less abolish the institution of the family based onit. Likewise, in our muddled view of God, we are unreliable witnesses to thetrue nature of the divine, and our doubts don’t mean that God should beabolished.A NEW VERSION, GOD 2.0Every age creates a God that serves only for a while (although that while can becenturies). Our age makes the most minimal demand on spirit: We want a deitythat we can freely ignore.How, then, should we re-create God? I’m speaking of God in the West. Othervarieties of God are not ready for renewal. Fundamentalist Islam is a rearguardaction that is desperately trying to preserve God 1.0, insisting on the mostprimitive version, a God who protects the faithful from annihilation; such a Godcannot help but be a matter of life and death. Nor am I speaking of God in theEast, which has a long tradition of seeing God as One. That’s God 1.0 in theseventh stage, a presence that imbues all of creation. Such a deity has nolocation except at the source of our consciousness, which can only be foundafter an inner journey. God as the higher self is the ultimate revelation.Countless people in Asia are brought up to believe in the higher self—in Indiait is called Atman—but they don’t actually undertake the inner journey. As inthe West, most people in the East live as if God were optional, a fixture oftheir cultural heritage that makes little or no difference in how theirpractical life turns out.In order to have a future, God must fulfill the promises made in his namethroughout history. Instead of being a projection, God 2.0 is the reverse. He isthe reality from which existence springs. As you journey inward, everyday lifebecomes suffused with divine qualities like love, forgiveness, and compassion.These are experienced in yourself as a reality. God 2.0 does much more—he is theinterface between you and infinite consciousness. As things are now, a Godexperience is rare, barely hinted at, because our focus is on the outer worldand material goals. When you begin the process of finding God, the inner worldreveals itself. God experience will start to become the norm, not in aspectacular way like a wished-for miracle but in the far deeper way oftransformation.GOD 2.0MAKING THE CONNECTIONFirst connection: God experience dawnsYou become centered. The mind calms down and gains more self-awareness.Restlessness and dissatisfaction decrease. You have moments of bliss and innerpeace, which become more frequent. You find less resistance in your life. Youfeel that you matter in the larger scheme of things. Everyday life gets easier.You feel less stress, struggle, and pressure.Deeper connection: God experience transforms youHigher consciousness becomes real. You appreciate the value of simply being.Your desires come true with much less effort than before. In bursts of insight,you see why you exist and what your purpose is. Outer distractions lose theirgrip on you. You feel emotionally bonded with those you love. Anxiety andstruggle drastically decrease. Your life is pervaded with a sense of rightness.Total connection: Your true self is GodYou merge with your source. God is revealed as pure consciousness, the essenceof who you are. In time, this essence will radiate in all of creation. Youexperience the light of life within yourself. All is forgiven; all is loved.Your individual ego has expanded to become the cosmic ego. As enlightenmentdeepens, you experience a second birth. From now on, your evolution will takeplace as a journey into the transcendent.In reality you are completely connected to God already, since we are talkingabout the source of existence. But there are different states of consciousness,and reality changes in each of them. If your awareness is turned outward,focused on the material world with its precarious ups and downs, you willperceive no God. The outer world will be sufficient on its own terms. If insteadyou look beyond external appearances, focusing on higher values such as love andunderstanding, your faith in God offers security and reassurance. But only whenyou transform your own awareness will God become clear, real, and useful. Untilthen, the divine has a shadow reality and is almost useless. The skeptics areright to question such a God. Their mistake is that they are blind to a betterone.In a word, God 2.0 is a process, a verb instead of a noun. Once you begin theprocess, it builds upon itself. You will know that you are on the right pathbecause each step brings insight, clarity, and expanded experiences—theyvalidate that higher consciousness is real.When there is enough consciousness, God appears. You will know this as surely asyou know that you have thoughts, feelings, and sensations. This is God willcross your mind as easily as This is a rose. The presence of God will be aspalpable as a heartbeat.THREE STATES OF AWARENESSThat’s what lies ahead. We have to give equal weight to the three states thatpeople find themselves in right now, since unbelief, faith, and knowledge allserve a purpose. They are the stepping-stones from “No God” to “Perhaps God” to“God in me.”Unbelief: In this stage a person is guided by reason and doubt. The “No God”position feels reasonable. It is arrived at by questioning all of God’sinconsistencies and the myths surrounding religion. Science plays its part, notby proving or disproving God but by showing us how to ask skeptical questions.Unbelief isn’t just negation: There is positive atheism, too, the kind thatfocuses on God as a possibility but refuses to accept tradition, dogma, or faithwithout evidence. This strain of unbelief leads to mental clarity. It forces usto grow up and act like adults, spiritually speaking, defying the pull ofinertia that makes it all too easy to accept the God of Sunday school lessons.Imagine that your brain has neural pathways dedicated to unbelief. Thesepathways process the world as it comes to you through your five senses. Ittrusts in objects it can see and touch. It distrusts anything mystical. Rocksare hard, knives are sharp, but God is intangible. A good deal of yourself isattached to this area of the brain, which spans diverse regions. The primitivedrives of hunger, fear, anger, sex, and self-defense throw you into the physicalworld, here and now. Life consists of gratifying your desires in the present,not postponing them until you arrive in heaven. At the same time, unbeliefincorporates the higher brain function of reason and discrimination, as well asthe entire project (which has no definite location in the brain) of building astrong ego, an “I” that is never satisfied for long. All of this neuralprocessing works against the reality of God. It will do no good to pretend. Lifeis a demanding taskmaster, and God has failed to make it any different.Faith: Even as modern life has eroded every organized religion, people stillidentify with faith. In polls, 75 percent of Americans identify themselves withan organized religion, whatever their doubts may be. To a skeptic, clinging tofaith seems childish and weak. At worst it’s a primitive defense that shields aperson who is unable to handle reality. But for the process of restoring God,faith is crucial. It gives you a goal and a vision. It tells you where you areheaded long before you arrive. (I like a metaphor I once heard, that faith islike smelling the sea before you see it.)Faith can be negative. We all know the perils of faith-based fanaticism. Thestep from believing in the promise of heavenly rewards to becoming a suicidebomber is frighteningly small. Beyond the ranks of fanatics, faith demands itsprice. The “good” Catholic and “good” Jew are proud not to think for themselves.Faith supports a deeply conservative impulse, and when we are honest withourselves, we all wish for the security and belonging in which tradition enfoldsthe faithful.In the functioning brain, faith spans its own neural networks. A major part ofthe activity takes place in the limbic system, the seat of emotions. Faith isattached to love of family and devotion to your parents when you were a child.Memory invokes nostalgia for a better time and place; faith tells you that youwill get there once more. But your higher brain is also involved. Throughoutreligious history the faithful have suffered persecution. Turning the othercheek instead of lashing back in revenge requires the higher brain to hold on toevolved values like compassion, forgiveness, and detachment. We all know what itfeels like to have forgiveness and retaliation conflicting inside us; it’s aclassic example of cross-inhibition in the brain.Knowledge: The only way to end inner conflict is to arrive at a state ofcertainty. The trail leads from “I have faith that God exists” to “I know Godexists.” You can drum skepticism into children from a young age (there isactually a Web site devoted to showing kids how to “escape” from God); you canfool believers into following a false messiah. Knowledge is different when itcomes from inside. You know that you exist; you know that you are conscious. God2.0 needs nothing else as a foundation. The expansion of consciousness bringstrue spiritual knowledge completely on its own.God isn’t like Halley’s comet—you can’t wait for him to appear in the sky. Youcan’t think your way to God, either. Fortunately, you don’t have to. You beginby seeking, and your search builds upon itself. God isn’t like the dinosaurs.One T. rex fossil suffices to settle the question of whether dinosaurs onceroamed the earth. Knowing God consists of many experiences acquired over alifetime, a slow-motion epiphany, as it were. Certainly you will experiencetemporary peaks, striking revelations and moments when the truth seemsastonishingly clear. A selected few may be blinded by the light of God on theroad to Damascus. For them, God is revealed in a flash.But the brain tells a different story. Healthy brain function depends onreliable neural pathways that work the same every time. If you’ve trainedyourself to play the piano or throw a football, the skill became dependablebecause you laid down specific neural pathways. Every experience either adds toyour skill or subtracts from it. Although you don’t realize it, your brain isalways building new pathways and diverting or even destroying other ones. At themicroscopic level where neuron meets neuron, God needs his own pathways.In a slow-motion epiphany, you train your brain to adapt to spiritualexperiences. According to a popular notion, any of us can master a skill if wedevote ten thousand hours to it: playing the violin, performing close-up magic,developing super memory, or any other goal. This theory has a basic validity,because altering old pathways and building new ones takes time and repetition.God 2.0 is more than a project in brain remodeling, but unless your brain isremodeled, the experience of God will be impossible. An adage from the Vedictradition in India says, “This isn’t knowledge you learn. It is knowledge youbecome.” Viewed through the lens of neuroscience, that’s literally true.The God process incorporates the whole person. I invite you to disbelieveanything you’ve ever heard about God, and I invite you to keep the faith at thesame time. If God is One, you should leave nothing out, including the mostextreme skepticism. Reality isn’t fragile. If you doubt a rose, it doesn’twither and die. The only prerequisite is that you accept the possibility thatGod 2.0 could be real.A famous guru was once asked, “How should I be your disciple? Should I worshipyou? Should I accept every word as truth?” The guru replied, “Neither one. Justopen your mind to the possibility that what I’m saying could be true.”Suppressing any inner potential—including the potential to find God—aborts it.The seed is killed before it sprouts. Having an open mind is like opening ashuttered window. The light will enter of its own accord.I think it’s clear that we’re not talking about a come-to-Jesus moment.Self-transformation is more like child development. When you were four years oldplaying with paper dolls and watching Sesame Street, your brain was stilldeveloping; in the course of time you abandoned paper dolls and began readingbooks. There was no single moment where the road forked, where you had to chooseto be four or five, six or seven. You were simply yourself, while at aninvisible level evolution was exerting its force.The process of self-transformation works the same way. You remain yourself whileinvisible changes take place deep inside. Every person is like a ragged army.Some aspects of your personality scout ahead, while the camp followers lagbehind. The spiritual path feels as if you are flying ahead one day andfoot-dragging, or even backsliding, the next. Unbelief, faith, and knowledge allhave their say.But eventually, if you remain self-aware and keep track of the process, you willmake real progress. There will be more days when you feel safe and protected,and fewer days when you feel alone and lost. Moments of bliss will increase.Feeling secure in your inner core becomes a baseline feeling. The self is like ahologram, where any small piece can stand for the whole. The process that buildsthe God experience scrambles the old hologram, splinter by splinter. You willsee a new wholeness when the job is done. That wholeness is God."},{"pageContent":"THE PATH TO GODStage 1: Unbelief"},{"pageContent":"DAWKINS AND HIS DELUSIONSUnbelief isn’t the born enemy of faith. In modern times, in fact, unbelief is areasonable starting point. But it’s a poor end point. The most virulent protestsagainst God can be used to clear the mind of false beliefs, paving the way forstronger faith. In that way Richard Dawkins, an avowed enemy of God, becomesGod’s tacit ally.When The God Delusion appeared in 2006 and became a major bestseller, Dawkinsgave militant atheism its polemical stance. Dawkins does not just reject God; heshows contempt for spirituality altogether. He mocks our aspirations to connectwith a higher reality, basing his argument on the most simplistic grounds: thatthe physical world is all there is. He portrays religion as a deluded state,with no basis in reality.There is no denying the power of The God Delusion when it indicts religion inits most fanatical forms. At one point, Dawkins co-opts John Lennon’s gentlesong “Imagine” and turns it to his own purposes.Imagine, with John Lennon, a world with no religion. Imagine no suicide bombers,no 9/11, no 7/7, no Crusades, no witch-hunts, no Gunpowder Plot, no Indianpartition, no Israeli/Palestinian wars, no Serb/Croat/Muslim massacres, nopersecution of Jews as “Christ killers,” no Northern Ireland “troubles,” no“honor killings,” no shiny-suited, bouffant-haired televangelists fleecinggullible people of their money (“God wants you to give until it hurts”).As the horrific examples pile up, Dawkins’s confidence builds; he isn’t offeringhope or sympathy here. He’s venting his contempt.Imagine no Taliban to blow up ancient statues, no public beheadings ofblasphemers, no flogging of female skin for the crime of showing an inch of it.You would think, after hearing this litany of horrors, that converts would flockto join the atheist cause, but they haven’t. The decline of organized religionin America, along with Western Europe, began in the 1950s and hasn’t reversed.The unchecked catastrophes of the twentieth century emptied the pews at a steadypace. But there hasn’t been a mass embrace of Dawkins-style unbelief, whichcannot abide God and must attack anyone who is a believer. Why have peopledeserted religion without deserting God? This is an important question thatDawkins remains blind to.Let’s go back to when Time magazine ran a cover story in 1966 asking thequestion “Is God Dead?” A rift was opened, in which people dared to ask thequestion, once unthinkable, and in the four decades since, the rift has onlygrown wider. Dawkins threw a bomb into the rift. (Time put him on the cover forhis efforts in 2007.) He called the God of the Old Testament an “appalling rolemodel” in no uncertain terms—Jehovah is “the most unpleasant character in allfiction: jealous and proud of it; a petty, unjust, unforgiving control freak; avindictive, bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser; a misogynist, pestilential,megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic, capriciously malevolent bully.” A Godlessworld, Dawkins claimed, would be better in every way.Moving on to the New Testament, Dawkins wrote, “The historical evidence thatJesus claimed any sort of divine status is minimal.” If such evidence everemerged, then the evidence would indicate that Jesus might have been mad; atbest he was “honestly mistaken.” The only plausible reason that religion evertook hold, Dawkins tells us, is that our ancestors heard fairy tales and, like“gullible children,” believed they were true. Being duped was good enough forprimitive brains, but we need to grow up. If Dawkins can convince us once andfor all that God is a worthless holdover from the age of superstition, the HolyGhost won’t stand a ghost of a chance.Dawkins prides himself on being the absolute atheist, capable of pulling stuntslike the one involving the visit of Pope Benedict XVI to the U.K. in the fall of2010. It was the first official state visit to Great Britain by any pontiff andwas deemed controversial on a number of grounds, including the Church’s positionon contraception and the ongoing scandal of sexual abuse among the priesthood.Dawkins’s participation in a “Protest the Pope” rally was far more extreme. Noaccusation was too inflammatory or reckless. He had previously backed the notionthat a warrant should be issued for the pope’s arrest for “crimes againsthumanity.” At the rally Dawkins gave a speech that brought up Benedict’sassociation with Hitler Youth in the 1930s, not mentioning that this wasrequired of all German youths at the time—the pope’s father actually spoke outagainst Hitler. Dawkins accused the Church of supporting Nazism, called Hitler aRoman Catholic (the dictator was born into a Catholic family but stoppedpracticing the faith after childhood), and repeated the denunciation that thepope was “an enemy of humanity.”Anti-Catholicism in this virulent vein—a prominent Catholic newspaper editorcalled the attack “lunatic”—has never been acceptable in civilized society. Itfosters discord and religious prejudice. Dawkins had already become a publiccelebrity for The God Delusion, and his academic prestige masked attitudes thatwould have been found disgraceful in an ordinary citizen—and that should havedisgraced him. He wrongly appropriated the authority of being a professor andbiologist at Oxford University. In his own field, Dawkins’s previous writings onevolution and genes had made him perhaps the most respected explainer of sciencein his generation—his official Oxford title is not about any specific field ofscientific expertise and has nothing to do with research; he is SimonyiProfessor for the Public Understanding of Science. Moving on to the publicmisunderstanding of God was a perverse step.The God Delusion is aimed at a specific target audience, the author tells us:all the doubters who remain in the religion of their parents but don’t believein it anymore, and who worry about the evils done in the name of God. Amultitude of people want to flee from religion, he writes, but they “don’trealize that leaving is an option.” The motto for The God Delusion, in fact, is“I didn’t know I could.” Dawkins believes that he is advancing the human spirit;he presents himself as a freedom fighter. As he declares on the very first page,“Being an atheist is nothing to be apologetic about. On the contrary, it issomething to be proud of, standing tall to face the far horizon.”The God Delusion received some scathing reviews for its extremist tactics. Thereis more to religion than the terrible acts committed by fanatics, but not inDawkins’s argument, where he explicitly says that moderate religion should becondemned equally with the most intolerant fundamentalism. (One chapter istitled “How ‘Moderation’ in Faith Fosters Fanaticism.”) Militant atheism equatesabsolutism with certainty. Once branded as “very evil,” believing in God makes asaint as guilty as Osama bin Laden.The multitudes of doubters just waiting to be liberated by the message of TheGod Delusion don’t exist. They are Dawkins’s delusion.None of his flaws, mistakes, and shifty tactics are difficult to spot. But manyreaders gave The God Delusion a free pass, I think. It proclaims to upholdrationality over irrationality; it flatters secular society for being superiorto religious society. But I suspect that the major reason is psychological.Dawkins is telling troubled doubters that they have no reason to be guilty,confused, lost, or lonely. They are on the cusp of a new world that is brighterand better than anything to be offered by spirituality. He offers atheism ascomfort and reassurance—which it may be for some.But if the possibility of God is so backward that any rational mind would rejectit, why did Einstein devote a considerable amount of time trying to fit God intothe new universe he pioneered? It’s a question worth pursuing, because the starkcontrast between reason and unreason dominates The God Delusion on every page.If the twentieth century’s greatest mind didn’t accept that science is the enemyof religion, he might have seen deeper than Dawkins. Which guide to the futureshould we trust, after all?EINSTEIN’S SPIRITUALITYEinstein wasn’t a conventional believer, but he was compassionate enough torealize that loss of faith can be devastating, all the more if God has beencentral in your life. At first his story conforms to that of manytwentieth-century skeptics. As a young man, he rejected religion and his ownJudaism on logical grounds, unable to accept the literal truth of eventsrecounted in the Old Testament. Creation in seven days, God speaking to Mosesfrom a burning bush, Jacob wrestling with the angel: Many turn-of-the-centuryJews couldn’t reasonably support the miracle world of ancient Judaism. (Later inlife Einstein said, “The idea of a personal God is alien to me and seems evennaïve.”) Einstein moved beyond orthodox faith while still struggling personallywith his Jewishness. He could have followed the easy trajectory of a Dawkins,using science as a weapon to combat the vestiges of faith. The God Delusion hasa short section on Einstein, gathering him into the fold as an “atheistscientist.” Certainly Einstein wasn’t a mystic. But Dawkins discounts a personaljourney that actually points where spirituality is headed, even today.Einstein was interested in the essence of religion, which he thought wascompletely genuine. An anecdote stands out in Walter Isaacson’s recentbiography. At a dinner party in Berlin in 1929, where Einstein was inattendance, the conversation turned to astrology, which the guests dismissed assuperstitious and unbelievable. When someone said that God fell into the samecategory, the host tried to silence him, pointing out that even Einsteinbelieved in God. “That isn’t possible!” the guest exclaimed. In reply, Einsteingave one of his subtlest and most consistent reasons for believing:“Try and penetrate with our limited means the secrets of nature, and you willfind that, behind all the discernible laws and connections, there remainssomething subtle, intangible, and inexplicable. Veneration for this force beyondanything we can comprehend is my religion. To that extent I am, in fact,religious.”This comment is rich with possibilities. It reinforces the idea that a modernsearch for God shouldn’t be pursuing the old image of a patriarch sitting on histhrone. Einstein wasn’t after that. He was looking for God behind the curtain ofmaterial appearances. The key here is subtlety. Like all scientists, Einsteinexplored the material world, but he perceived a subtler region of existence.Notice that he didn’t claim that his religious belief was based on faith.Perception was involved, and discovery through the mind.Einstein took the bolder step of trying to understand whether a single realityencompasses both the drive to believe in a higher reality and the drive toexplain nature in terms of laws and processes that operate independently ofspirit. Time, space, and gravity don’t need God, yet without God the universeseems random and meaningless. Einstein expressed this dichotomy in his famoussaying: “Science without religion is lame. Religion without science is blind.”Another of his famous quotes touches on the mind again: “The religiousinclination lies in the dim consciousness that dwells in humans that all nature,including the humans in it, is in no way an accidental game, but a work oflawfulness, that there is a fundamental cause of all existence.” The mainthought here is about the orderliness of nature. Einstein could not believe thatthe kind of intricate beauty that surrounds us was accidental. He fought hiswhole life against the random universe explained by quantum mechanics. Withoutreally understanding what he meant, the public was on Einstein’s side when hesaid that God doesn’t play dice with the universe.But what stands out for me in this quote is a passing phrase: “all nature,including the humans in it.” Lesser scientists, including the popular skepticslike Dawkins, make the mistake of believing that humans can stand outside natureand look into its workings like children pressing their noses against a bakeryshop window. They presume objectivity of the kind that quantum physics totallyabolished almost a hundred years ago. The observer plays an active part in whathe observes. We live in a participatory universe.Beyond a purely scientific argument, Einstein understood the ambiguity of thehuman situation. Our “dim consciousness” of something beyond the observableuniverse puts us in a strange position. Which should we trust, consciousness orobjective facts? Science itself was born in “dim consciousness,” if you thinkabout it. Instead of accepting the world of sight, sound, touch, taste, andsmell, the scientific mind transcends appearances. It thinks, “Perhaps there areinvisible laws at work here. God’s creation may obey these laws. He might evenwant his children to discover them, as part of their reverence for Creation.”We need to remember that Copernicus, Kepler, and Galileo had to wrestle with theage of faith personally; they were men of that age as well as pioneers of a newage. Religion defined how everyone participated in the universe. The first rulewas that God transcends the visible world. It took inner struggle to switch thisover and say that mathematics transcends the visible world, because once youelevate mathematics, you elevate the laws of nature that operate according tomathematics. It’s a slippery slope. Suddenly undreamed-of thoughts enter yourhead. Perhaps God is subject to the same laws. He can’t overturn gravity. Or isGod just playing at being powerless? Having decided to let Creation runmechanically, as if ruled by mathematical precision, he could topple the wholemachine if he wanted to.Einstein’s search moved in much the same shadowy world. He couldn’t explain whatlay beyond time and space—he had pushed the mathematics of time and space as faras it could go—but he didn’t make the crude mistake of dismissing his “dimconsciousness” of higher reality as a throwback to superstition. This kind ofambiguity frustrated many people at the time. Dawkins is right to point out inThe God Delusion that believers and atheists both like to cherry-pick Einstein’scontradictory statements about God. They want the greatest thinker in the worldto give definitive answers.A prominent rabbi sent Einstein an exasperated telegram: “Do you believe in God?Stop. Answer paid. Fifty words.” Einstein replied, “I believe in Spinoza’s God,who reveals himself in the lawful harmony of all that exists, but not in a Godwho concerns himself with the fate and the doings of mankind.” Influenced by thefreethinking Dutch philosopher Spinoza, he became fascinated by the possibilitythat matter and mind form one reality, and that God is the supreme intelligencesuffusing that reality. He praised Spinoza as “the first philosopher to dealwith the soul and body as one, and not two separate things.”By middle age, Einstein had rejected a personal God, putting himself beyond theconfines of the Judeo-Christian tradition. But not entirely: When he was fifty,an interviewer asked Einstein if he had been influenced by Christianity, towhich he replied, “I am a Jew, but I am enthralled by the luminous figure of theNazarene.” Clearly surprised, the interviewer asked if Einstein believed thatJesus had actually existed. “Unquestionably. No one can read the Gospels withoutfeeling the actual presence of Jesus. His personality pulsates in every word. Nomyth is filled with such life.”Even so, Einstein was progressing personally toward a spirituality far moresecular than this comment suggests. Secular spirituality looks at the wholenessof existence without prejudice. God and reason are allowed to coexist withoutfighting. How? The link is at the level of mind. Einstein’s ultimate goal, hesaid, was to understand God’s mind. But to do that, the human mind must beexplained first. After all, our minds are the filter through which we perceivereality, and if this filter is distorted and misunderstood, we have nopossibility of grasping God’s mind. Either we think like him or he thinks likeus. If neither is true, there can be no connection.Einstein surpasses Dawkins in every way as a guide to both religion and science.Without a shadow of arrogance, Einstein wrote, “What separates me from mostso-called atheists is a feeling of utter humility toward the unattainablesecrets of the harmony of the cosmos.” (The God Delusion relates nothing aboutEinstein’s actual spiritual journey, in keeping with Dawkins’s loose relation tothe truth.) For me, the most inspiring trait is Einstein’s fascination with alevel of creation just out of reach. It’s the unseen place where wonder begins.In his 1930 credo, “What I Believe,” we find this sentence: “To sense thatbehind anything that can be experienced there is something that our minds cannotgrasp, whose beauty and sublimity reaches us only indirectly, this isreligiousness.” Statements like these open the way for a broad, tolerant view ofthe spiritual quest. In that regard, Einstein outshines the rigidity of currentscientific skeptics, who throw out a personal God but leave a vacuous sterilityin his place."},{"pageContent":"ANSWERING MILITANT ATHEISMRichard Dawkins, espousing atheism-as-progress, has been joined by otherprominent voices. They include three best-selling writers: the philosopherDaniel Dennett, the late polemicist Christopher Hitchens, and the anti-Christianlightning rod, former student of Buddhism, and neuroscientist Sam Harris. Thebooks they write are deliberate provocations, but I am puzzled by how shallowtheir arguments against God actually are. They gleefully distort spiritualityand have no qualms about using unfair tactics. Hitchens, for example, throws outspiritual testimony before it even has its say.Any decent intellectual argument has to begin by excluding people who claim toknow more than they can possibly know. You start off by saying, “Well, that’swrong to begin with. Now can we get on with it?” So theism is gone in the firstround. It’s off the island. It’s out of the show.Personally, I can’t imagine a better formula for intellectual dishonesty. Thespokesmen for militant atheism don’t confront their own tunnel vision; theyrevel in it instead. All ideologues do. This leads them into making blindmisstatements. Here’s a sampling taken from taped talks:Harris: “Every religious person feels the same criticism of other people’sfaiths that we do as atheists. They reject the pseudo-miracles … they see theconfidence tricks in other people’s faith.”Hitchens: Religious people “like the idea that [God] can’t be demonstrated,because then there would be nothing to be faithful about. If everyone had seenthe Resurrection and we all knew we’d been saved by it, then we would be livingin an unalterable system of belief—it would have to be policed.”Harris again: “If the Bible is not a magic book, Christianity evaporates. If theKoran is not a magic book, Islam evaporates. If you look at these books, isthere … a single sentence that could not have been uttered by a person for whoma wheelbarrow would have been emergent technology?”Raw prejudice is spewed out all over the place, yet in a skeptical age, militantatheism has gotten a good deal of intellectual respect. Dennett, who argues thatwe are all “zombies” mechanically following the dictates of our brains, iswidely praised for debunking such worn-out notions as the soul and the personalself. Hitchens’s provocative book, god is not Great (lowercasing God is hischoice, in the title and throughout the text), was a finalist for the NationalBook Award. In 2011, during his last dying days, as he succumbed to cancer ofthe esophagus—the sad outcome of being a lifelong heavy drinker andsmoker—Hitchens wrote an open letter to an annual atheist convention in America.His message was poignant in its defiance of any death-bed conversion. Here are afew excerpts.I have found, as the enemy [death] becomes more familiar, that all the specialpleading for salvation, redemption and supernatural deliverance appears evenmore hollow … than it did before.I have found my trust better placed in two things: the skill and principle ofadvanced medical science and the comradeship of innumerable friends and family,all of them immune to the false consolations of religion.It is these forces among others which will speed the day when humanityemancipates itself from the mind-forged manacles of servility and superstition.The key terms that Hitchens uses in his letter to condemn an old, discreditedworldview are familiar in the rhetoric of militant atheism: “superstition,”“false consolation,” “mind-forged manacles of servility,” “stultifyingpseudo-science,” and the “blandishments” of organized religion. Against theseinimical forces he amasses the impulse for good that is on his side: decency,skepticism, “our innate solidarity,” courage, “sincere resistance to insidiousnonsense,” and so on.Rhetoric is just rhetoric, and few take seriously that atheists are models ofdecency and morality while all believers are servile and superstitious. Humannature is not so neatly parceled out. At the emotional level I am most disturbedby bullying behavior that seeks to crush the early shoots of personalspirituality. In my experience, people who have left the reassurance oftraditional faiths usually feel insecure. Their spiritual yearning is vague andunformed. They aren’t armed against the arguments of militant atheists. Dawkins,Hitchens, Harris, and Dennett are professional writers and thinkers; they havemastered the art of persuasion. They are unashamed to marshal dishonestarguments just for the sake of winning, or out of disdain for their opponents.In a flash, Dawkins and his cohorts lump anyone who utters the word “God” inwith the crudest religious fundamentalism. There are many shades of atheismalso. It’s worth repeating that 2008 Pew survey I began with, which found that21 percent of American who describe themselves as atheists believe in God or auniversal spirit. The same poll found that 12 percent of atheists believe inheaven, and 10 percent pray at least once a week.What about the claim that we would all enjoy life more if we dropped thepreposterous notion that God exists? The Irish-American writer T. C. Boyle gavethe lie to this in a doleful remark made in an interview with the New YorkTimes. The topic of death came up—Boyle’s novels feature death prominently—andhis telling response goes to the heart of what disillusionment actually feelslike.In previous generations, there was purpose; you had to die, but there was God,and literature and culture would go on. Now, of course, there is no God, and ourspecies is imminently doomed, so there is no purpose. We get up, raise families,have bank accounts, fix our teeth and everything else. But really, there isutterly no purpose except to be alive.For many, this kind of disillusionment feels very real, but no one would call ita happy state of mind. Leave out the tainted word God with all its badconnotations. Substitute a synonym for what seekers want, such as inner peace,spiritual fulfillment, the soul, higher consciousness, the transcendent. Wipingthem off the face of the earth isn’t the key to a happier existence. It’s morelike a preview of hell on earth. The happiness that is supposed to follow whenyou give up on your spiritual aspirations is hollow.None of this is hard to see. But it is hard to counter, because militant atheismmakes the right diagnosis while offering the wrong medicine. The right medicineis spiritual renewal. We are essentially spiritual beings. Our place in creationisn’t defined by being intelligent—although we are proud of that—but by aspiringto reach higher. Militant atheism would crush this precious trait. It wouldexchange the tragedy of a failed God for the tragedy of having no soul. Scienceand the data it collects contain no wonder, awe, or mystery. The joy ofexistence has no reality except inside us—we add the wonder, and we can take itaway.Christopher Hitchens died of cancer ten days before Christmas 2011. He wassixty-two. The kind of existential courage he showed, in the “long argument I amcurrently having with the specter of death,” is honorable and touching. It isequally honorable to be a spiritual seeker, and ironically, there’s aconvergence here. Spirituality is existential, too. It asks who we are, why weare here, and what the highest values are by which a person should live.The atheist’s mistake is to hog the moral limelight, declaring that onlynonbelievers own the truth. The truth is a process of discovery, and someone whoscorns the process needs to wake up before claiming that anyone else is fastasleep. When they talk to pollsters, people almost unanimously express a beliefin God. But the seed of unbelief hasn’t been plucked out. To begin the processof rebooting God, each of us needs to hold up a mirror to our own unbelief. Thatmay seem like a frightening or disheartening prospect. It isn’t. When you removethe illusions that you trust in, what remains is the truth, and the ultimatetruth is God."},{"pageContent":"PROVING THE PLATYPUSGod’s existence is hard to prove, but so is one of nature’s most whimsicalcreations, the platypus. If it didn’t really exist, no one would give muchcredence to this improbable creature. It has webbed feet and a bill like a duck.The male can deliver a venomous sting with his hind feet. The female doesn’tgive birth like other mammals but lays eggs like a fish, reptile, or bird. Let’ssay that a mathematician is called in to prove how unlikely such a creature is.With enough reliable variables, he could give you a statistical probability, andit would be very low. A fishlike, reptilian mammal defies all the odds. Yet loand behold, those odds prove to be wrong as soon as a platypus is dug out of itsburrow beside an Australian stream. (They are shy, nocturnal creatures.)Beware of arguments based on probability. When he was a young man, Einsteinworked as a clerk in the Swiss Patent Office. What are the odds that a clerk inthe same office today will be the next Einstein? It’s an absurd question to posethat way (like asking the odds that a deaf person will become the nextBeethoven). Even if you came up with plausible odds (ten zillion to one), thenext Einstein won’t be found using probability. Likewise, when you want to geton a bus, you don’t calculate the probability of its taking you where you wantto go. You consult the schedule and find out. There are lots of wrong questionsthat lead to wrong answers.In The God Delusion, Dawkins makes improbability the centerpiece of denyingGod’s existence. It’s a classic case of asking the wrong question. His argumentcan be found in a chapter titled “Why There Almost Certainly Is No God,” whichposes as objectivity. On a scale of 1 to 7, where 1 is certainty that God existsand 7 is certainty that he doesn’t, he counts himself a 6: “I cannot know forcertain, but I think God is very improbable, and I live my life on theassumption that he is not there.”Why should the existence of God come down to calculating the odds like a horserace? You don’t need to call in a statistician if you’ve found a platypus, andfor three thousand years the same has held true of God. People have had manydirect experiences of God throughout history. Writing in the generation afterthe Crucifixion, Saint Paul declared that more than five hundred converts hadseen the risen Christ. Muhammad went up to a cave above Mecca where he foundpeace and quiet, only to be confronted by the angel Gabriel, who commanded himto “Recite!” Spontaneously Muhammad began to speak the verses of the Koran.Religious history is filled with epiphanies, revelations, visions, miracles, andwonders. With a phenomenon as universal as spirituality, direct experience meanssomething. A skeptic has a right to discount something generic like a publicopinion poll. The fact that 80 to 90 percent of Americans believe in God is weakevidence unless you interview each respondent and ask them why they believe.God (unlike the platypus) may be invisible, but so is music. We trust ourexperience of music, but what if a deaf skeptic came along? How would you provethe existence of music to him? You could take him to concert halls where peoplehave gathered to enjoy music. If he remained unconvinced, you’d have many otheroptions: music conservatories, factories where musical instruments are made, andso on. At a certain point, even if a deaf skeptic had no ability to validatethat music is real, the vast experience of others would be convincing—unless hewas dead set against it.Dawkins is dead set against acknowledging the existence of God; therefore thedirect experience of other people carries no weight with him. All are deludedand duped. The God Delusion has a detailed index at the back. Here are somenames that do not appear in it: Buddha, Lao-tzu, Zoroaster, Socrates, Plato,Saint Francis of Assisi, and the gospel writers Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.Dawkins dismisses all spiritual experience from the past with a shrug. Hedoesn’t mention Confucius, either, and his single reference to Confucianism getslumped in with Buddhism because to Dawkins they aren’t really spiritual innature:I shall not be concerned at all with other religions such as Buddhism orConfucianism. Indeed, there is something to be said for treating these not asreligions but as ethical systems or philosophies of life.This will come as news to many generations of Buddhist priests and Tibetanlamas. But then, Dawkins is the kind of writer who wants the reader to acceptthat Judaism was “originally a tribal cult of a single fierce, unpleasant God,morbidly obsessed with sexual restrictions, with the smell of charred flesh,”and so on. He doesn’t consider that exaggerated put-downs might undermine hisown credibility as an objective scientist.A large body of scientific research attempts to verify spiritual experiences andthe paranormal. The God Delusion spends little time on impartial researchfindings and no time objectively weighing the pros and cons on controversiesabout reincarnation, near-death experiences, and the efficacy of prayer.Beginning in the 1960s, for example, at the psychology department of theUniversity of Virginia, psychiatrist Ian Stevenson headed a long-term study toinvestigate children who seem to remember their past lives. Typically thishappens between the ages of two and seven; it fades quickly after that. Fromover four decades of research, more than twenty-five hundred case studies havebeen compiled. The children bring up memories of where they used to live, theirfriends and family, and the details of their deaths. A number of children inJapan and the United States remember dying in combat in World War II. In onecase a little boy got excited seeing a newsreel of fighter planes over thePacific, and when one went down, he pointed to the television screen and said,“That was me.” The family sought out survivors of that particular battle, andthey described in detail the pilot whom the little boy thought he was. He gotevery detail and even a few names right.Coming from India, I was well aware of such incidents, which are widely knownand believed. Children have been tested by taking them to the village theyremembered living in, and quite often their recollections of streets, houses,and people are verified. Stevenson pursued these anecdotal stories, and by nowthe research team that continues his work has amassed hundreds of verifiedexamples from around the world. The most startling examples are probably thosein which a child is born with birthmarks that duplicate the wounds, such aswhere a bullet entered the chest, that correlate to how his previous incarnationdied.An independent study reviewing the data that Stevenson’s program gathered cameto the conclusion that “in regard to reincarnation he has painstakingly andunemotionally collected a detailed series of cases … in which the evidence isdifficult to explain on any other grounds.” A fascinating subject has been heldunder scientific scrutiny for anyone to examine. The same is true of everyphenomenon that skeptics like Dawkins ridicule rather than investigate. At thevery least, experiences that you don’t understand deserve to be examinedscientifically, especially if you are a scientist. Dawkins considers suchresearch bogus by definition, so all he has to do is cite a single contrarystudy to avoid even looking at masses of objective research.Dawkins devotes a few pages to scientists who believe in God. He shrugs offCopernicus, Kepler, Galileo, and Newton immediately because their prestige giveslittle weight to “an already bad argument.” But Darwin, who is Dawkins’shousehold god, should have given him pause. As a young man, Darwin wasconventionally religious. In his autobiography he writes, “Whilst on board theBeagle I was quite orthodox, and I remember being heartily laughed at by severalof the officers (though themselves orthodox) for quoting the Bible as anunanswerable authority on some point of morality.” His doubt arose over aconventional question that many other Victorians wrestled with: How could oneGod countenance the existence of many gods, like Shiva and Vishnu? Did he haveseparate messages for Hindus and Christians? Darwin found many reasons to doubtthat the Gospels were literally true, and after much consideration, he tells us,“I gradually came to disbelieve in Christianity as a divine revelation.”But it isn’t on the basis of evolution that Darwin abandoned Biblical religion,which makes for discomfort if you rely on evolution as a mainstay of youratheist position. Darwin didn’t consider the issue of a personal God until latein life, at which point he did use natural selection to refute arguments infavor of a benign, loving creator. It is striking how diffident he is whenwriting about his unbelief. He compares himself to someone who is blind to thecolor red in a world where everyone else can see red. Thus he understands that“the most usual argument for the existence of an intelligent God is drawn fromthe deep inward conviction and feelings which are experienced by most persons.”As a young man he had the same feelings—in a journal entry from his voyage onthe Beagle, he recalls being so overawed by the Brazilian jungle that he wasconvinced that only the existence of God could account for it. But in later lifethose feelings looked untrustworthy: “I cannot see that such inward convictionsand feelings are of any weight as evidence of what really exists.”Without a doubt, he was laying the ground for a modern scientist’s reliance onobjective evidence alone. But Darwin was far from being a God-basher. Afterdiscussing the possibility of immortality and other attributes of God, he says,“I cannot pretend to throw the least light on such abstruse problems. Themystery of the beginning of all things is insoluble to us; and I for one must becontent to remain an Agnostic.” Dawkins’s way of wriggling out of thisinconvenient fact is to say that in the nineteenth century the pressure tobelieve was so great that unbelievers were reluctant to really speak their mind.He quotes Bertrand Russell, a famous atheist among philosophers, to the effectthat such pressures inhibited scientists well into the twentieth century: “theyconceal the fact in public, because they are afraid of losing their incomes.”Against this conjecture, which seems weak even for Dawkins, he fails to considerthat a scientist can believe in God because, as the geneticist Francis Collinssays, science is good at commenting on the natural world but not on thesupernatural. For Collins as a believing Christian, “both worlds, for me, arequite real and quite important. They are investigated in different ways. Theycoexist. They illuminate each other.”Does it matter if great scientists believe in God? Copernicus, Newton, and therest didn’t conduct experiments on the existence of a deity. Nor did they relyon direct personal experience (although their biographies reveal some suchexperiences, as all kinds of people have had). Polling great scientists fortheir opinions on art wouldn’t matter; the two fields are entirely separate.Since The Origin of Species did so much to crush the Bible and Christian beliefin general, why did Darwin avoid atheism? A young admirer wrote a letter askingDarwin about his religious beliefs and received a careful reply. It was a studyin high-minded fence-sitting. Darwin wrote,It is impossible to answer your question briefly; and I am not sure that I coulddo so, even if I wrote at some length. But I may say that the impossibility ofconceiving that this grand and wondrous universe, with our conscious selves,arose through chance, seems to me the chief argument for the existence of God;but whether this is an argument of real value, I have never been able to decide.This brings us back to chance and probability. In the age of faith, peoplebeheld the intricate patterns in nature and immediately saw the hand of acreator. The rise of science undermined such intuitive perceptions. Every aspectof nature demanded some kind of data. Mathematics trumped “natural religion,” asit was called. So let’s see which side the probabilities actually favor. Is itmore likely that God exists or that he doesn’t?IS GOD THE ULTIMATE 747?There’s a famous answer to that question. In 1982 the British astrophysicist SirFred Hoyle gave a radio lecture in which he mentioned in passing that “acolleague of mine worked out that a yeast cell and a 777 airplane have the samenumber of parts, the same level of complexity.” The current scientificexplanation for how all the complex parts of a yeast cell came together israndomness. Hoyle tried to calculate how unlikely it was that random chance hadassembled a living cell. The odds were very low. But what has survived is astriking analogy that doesn’t depend upon whether he got his numbers right (themodel of airplane changed along the way):The chance that higher life forms might have emerged in this way [i.e.,randomly] is comparable to the chance that a tornado sweeping through a junkyardmight assemble a Boeing 747 from the materials therein.The analogy was brilliant because it can be easily understood, and believed, byanyone. A Boeing 747 has around six million parts, and it takes intelligence,design, and planning to fit them all together. Hoyle wasn’t a creationist, andhe didn’t believe in God. His aim was to show that highly complex structurescan’t be explained by chance.It’s easy to amplify the Boeing 747 junkyard analogy to make it even stronger—athousand times stronger, in fact: There are six billion, not six million,genetic letters strung along human DNA. Their arrangement is precise anddelicate. Major impairments like birth defects and genetic disorders can resultif the arrangement of even a few genes is imperfect. This implies that anIntelligent Design is present, even though the words intelligent and design haveturned into buzzwords for creationism. Creationism enjoyed a flurry of publicityas fundamentalist Christians dressed up the Biblical creation story in wobblyscience. The long-term damage was that it tainted the concept of intelligence innature.Dawkins makes hay by aiming chapter after chapter against religiousfundamentalists. As he presents it, if you suggest that nature looks designed,you are in the same leaky boat as someone who believes that the Book of Genesisis literally true. Dawkins participates in debates with theologians and emergesunscathed (by his account), since his opponents are befuddled and intellectuallyoutgunned, forced to retreat to musty arguments about God having a special placein nature outside the reach of science. In effect, he says, they put God in asafe zone, making him exempt from scientific reasoning. If he weren’t securelytucked away in a safe zone, God couldn’t survive the scrutiny we apply toamoebae, electrons, and dinosaur bones.The Boeing 747 junkyard analogy is too convincing to ignore, however, and TheGod Delusion must face it squarely. As Dawkins writes, “The argument fromimprobability is the big one.” He picks up a religious pamphlet published by theWatchtower Bible and Tract Society—the publishing arm of Jehovah’sWitnesses—that defends creationism. The pamphlet cites examples of complexlife-forms that indicate the hand of a creator God. One is Euplectella, adeep-sea sponge popularly called Venus’s Flower Basket. (It is a traditionalgift in Asia as a symbol of romantic love, because inside each sponge lives amale and a female shrimp, protected in their nest. When they mate, theiroffspring swim out into the ocean to find their own nest in anotherEuplectella.) The sponge’s skeleton is formed of millions of glass fibers sointricately interwoven that their design has interested the makers of fiberoptics; the sponge converts silicic acid, found in seawater, into silica, thechemical basis of glass. The Watchtower pamphlet declares that science cannotexplain how such complexity arose: “But one thing we do know. Chance is not thelikely designer.”Dawkins intends to surprise the reader by agreeing. Randomness is indeed a badexplanation for the glass skeleton of Venus’s Flower Basket, he says. No onewould credit that such exquisiteness came about by chance. Dawkins intends tosurprise us with this apparent flip-flop, since he relies so heavily onrandomness and probability. But he refutes the Boeing 747 junkyard analogy byusing it against itself. The problem, he says, is that Fred Hoyle, brilliant ashe was, misunderstood evolution completely. The secret of natural selection, thesource of its brilliance as a theory, is that it doesn’t need random chance.Living things compete selfishly. They take deliberate action. Plants want lightand water. Animals want food and a mate. As soon as a liana vine evolves and cantwine to the top of a tree in the jungle, it gets the light it craves. A cheetahthat evolves loose shoulder joints to enable it to stride longer and faster isgoing to beat out other big cats chasing after gazelles. Step by step, eachliving thing earns its right to survive; the steps aren’t random at all.So why, he asks, do our minds keep reaching for God as the designer of thephysical world? Because we falsely assume that some things are so beautiful andcomplex that their design cannot be denied—think of the intricate helix of achambered nautilus shell or the same spiral helix at the heart of a rose, thedouble strands of DNA, and the arrangement of seeds in a sunflower. Our eyestell us that a designer must have devised this beauty and complexity.Well, yes and no. It’s natural to connect a man-made machine like a pocket watchwith a maker, says Dawkins. Watches don’t assemble themselves. But the sameisn’t true in nature. Galaxies, planets, DNA, and the human brain did assemblethemselves. How? For life to appear on Earth, Darwin shows the way. Intricacy isbuilt up by a sequence of tiny steps. You may stand in awe of a Roman mosaicwall, but if you get close, you’ll see that it’s made of tiny chips of coloredstone. A chip isn’t awesome. Darwinism explains that the tiny steps of evolutionare not improbable at all; they are the building blocks of everything complex inthe natural world. The choice between God and chance is a false one, Dawkinswrites. The real choice is between God and natural selection.If you want to see something really improbable—to the point of laughing it outof existence—look at God. Dawkins calls God “the ultimate Boeing 747 gambit.” AGod who could create every form of life in one stroke, as the Book of Genesisdeclares, would have to be more complex than what he created—more complex thanDNA, quarks, billions of galaxies, and everything else that emerged over 13.7billion years since the Big Bang.It is extremely improbable that such a being stands behind the curtain ofnature. You can peer at the fossil record and prove the slow, inexorable processof evolution to yourself. Hoyle brought up a red herring when he tossedrandomness into the ring. The right answer is that a designer God defies anyodds. Dawkins cites his atheist colleague Daniel Dennett from Tufts University,who as a philosopher has been given the role of deep thinker in these matters.In a 2005 interview with a German journalist, Dennett addresses “the idea thatit takes a big fancy smart thing to make a lesser thing.” If you’re naïve, thisnotion seems intuitively right, Dennett says. “You’ll never see a spear making aspear maker. You’ll never see a horseshoe making a blacksmith. You’ll never seea pot making a potter.”Dennett labels this the “trickle-down theory of creation.” God is a blacksmithhammering out horseshoes on a cosmic scale. Dennett, whom Dawkins offers up as a“scientifically savvy philosopher,” lends credence to the argument ofimprobability. They both agree that a cosmic blacksmith or watchmaker is toointricate to be likely. Science, when faced with a choice, prefers the simplestexplanation that fits. Random chance is too far-fetched, so it doesn’t fit. AGod who is infinitely complex doesn’t fit. What’s left is evolution. Caseclosed.PERHAPS, OR PERHAPS NOTIn real life, only the tiniest handful of people believe in God because they’vewaded into the weeds of probability theory. But let’s stay with this knottyproblem. Do you believe the Boeing 747 analogy? I do. At its crudest, The GodDelusion turns God into a simplistic caricature. It’s absurd to ask whetherJehovah created DNA or not. We must toss out Dawkins’s straw man, a personal Godwho designed the universe. This is just another variant on seeing God as a humanbeing, only much smarter. Many people, as we’ve discussed, can conceive God onlyin a human image. When someone runs away from organized religion, this is theGod they are rejecting.Dawkins takes nearly four hundred pages to demolish God without seriouslyconsidering that a father in the sky might not be the only way to think aboutthe divine. As soon as you reply, “That’s not the God I had in mind,” the strawman of God the Father becomes irrelevant. Organized religion has been backedinto a corner by its refusal to find a viable alternative to God the Father, butsuch alternatives do exist. Saint Augustine had already rejected a literalreading of the Bible in the fifth century AD. Modern belief has gone muchfurther away from literalism, but it serves Dawkins not to even take a peek.One possibility is that God became the creation. (Einstein suggested somethinglike this in his famous quote about wanting to know the mind of God, although hedidn’t explicitly say that God was inside the laws governing time and space.) Inother words, God is not a person but the totality of nature. As the source ofexistence, he is the starting point of your being and mine. God isn’t ourfather; he isn’t a watchmaker assembling parts into a watch (an image devised inthe eighteenth century to explain how a single intelligent creator put all themoving parts of the cosmos together); he doesn’t have feelings and desires. Heis being itself. All things exist because he existed first. There is no need forsuch a God to be intricate.Setting up a God who must be more complex than the entire universe is merely aploy. Medieval theologians argued that God had to be more complex than hiscreation. Dawkins and Dennett should be arguing in the lecture halls of theUniversity of Paris around 1300. In the eighteenth century, the watchmakeranalogy became popular because a movement known as deism, which Thomas Jeffersonbelonged to, wanted to reconcile faith and reason. Deists accepted that Godisn’t present in the world, and reason told them that miracles can’t exist,because they defy the laws of nature. What sort of deity can be worshipped whoisn’t present and who doesn’t perform miracles? A rational god, one whoconstructed the universe, set it in motion, and then walked away. For Deists,God is like a watchmaker who built his machine, wound it up, and let it run onits own.The Dawkins twist is to demand that the watchmaker God be more complex than theuniverse. It’s not a demand anyone should accept, for good reason. When you liftyour hand to switch on a lamp, you carry out a simple intention. The fact thatyour brain contains a hundred billion neurons and perhaps a quadrillion synapticconnections is irrelevant. No one needs to examine all those neurons andconnections to calculate the probability that they will result in moving yourhand. Your intention moves it; the brain’s complexity serves the performance ofa simple act. Complexity is no obstacle to creating the thoughts, words, andactions that make up the human condition. The brain is too complex for anyone tounderstand, yet we use it every day.God could be the simplest thing of all, in fact. He is a unity. Diversityunfolds from this unity, and diversity—the expanding universe, billions ofgalaxies, human DNA—is bewilderingly complex. But its source doesn’t have to bediverse. Picasso was the source of tens of thousands of artworks, but he didn’thave to imagine all of them at once in his mind. Like natural selection, God isallowed to produce the natural world step by step, unless you insist, as Dawkinsdoes, that the literal acceptance of Genesis is the only creation storyreligious people believe in. The alternative I posed, that God became thecreation, has a long tradition as well.The next point that Dawkins makes is quite crucial: complex designs don’t need adesigner. In a triumphant sentence, The God Delusion explains why naturalselection is the only successful theory for how life evolved:Once the vital ingredient—some kind of genetic molecule—is in place, trueDarwinian natural selection can follow, and complex life emerges as the eventualconsequence.Most nonscientists won’t spot the sleight of hand here. The Boeing 747 junkyardanalogy isn’t refuted by what happened after life already appeared. What abouthow DNA got formed in the first place? DNA is a chemical, but in order toexplain its structure, you must invoke physics. The sequence of events that ledfrom the Big Bang to DNA is a single chain as far as physics is concerned. Thesame laws of nature must be at work; there can’t be any breaks in the chain, orDNA wouldn’t have come about.It would only have taken a few dropped stitches, billions of years ago, for thewhole enterprise to have collapsed—for example, if water didn’t emerge from thecombination of oxygen and hydrogen. The early cosmos was full of free-floatinghydrogen and oxygen, as it is today. DNA cannot exist without water, and thewater must have been in abundance for hundreds of millions of years. Since99.9999 percent of the oxygen and hydrogen in the universe didn’t turn intowater—add as many decimal places as you like—the fact that water appeared onEarth isn’t a matter of tiny probable steps. Quite the opposite—arguments forthe uniqueness of life on Earth still hold enormous power, and they don’t haveto be arguments based on a Biblical God.The God Delusion offended some scientists as much as it did creationists. Theypointed out, in their hostile reactions, that science depends on data, of whichDawkins offers none. He has conducted no experiments and made no calculations insupport of his atheistic ideas. The most severe scientific rebuke, however, isthat The God Delusion doesn’t really present a hypothesis that could be tested.Its author is wedded to preordained conclusions and has no time for anyarguments except the ones that get him where he wants to go.A distinguished biologist, H. Allen Orr, quotes Dawkins’s claim that “we shouldblame religion itself, not religious extremism—as though that were some kind ofterrible perversion of real, decent religion.” Orr dryly comments, “As you mayhave noticed, Dawkins when discussing religion is, in effect, a bluntinstrument, one that has a hard time distinguishing Unitarians from abortionclinic bombers.” Dawkins tries to knock the stuffing out of the Biblical God,but to make sure that he can kick him when he’s down, he uses only the mostsimplistic version of the Biblical God.If you explore the universe mining it for data and discount everything else,most of what makes life rich and beautiful goes out the window. God isn’t astrange supernatural fiction, as Dawkins asserts. He’s the source of our innerworld, the same place where art, music, imagination, visionary conceptions,love, altruism, philosophy, morals, and human bonding are born. This world hasits own truths. We can reach them by experiencing them. Only an alien fromanother planet would try to prove the existence of love by weighing theprobabilities. Only someone who has never seen a platypus would rely onstatistics to prove that one couldn’t exist. The same goes for Dawkins’sapproach to God."},{"pageContent":"THE PATH TO GODStage 2: Faith"},{"pageContent":"BEYOND THE ZERO POINT“I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.” Even many people who have neverread the Bhagavad Gita recognize this quotation with a shudder. It was spoken byJ. Robert Oppenheimer, director of the Manhattan Project, when the first atomicbomb was exploded in the New Mexico desert. He might as well have said, “I amMan, the destroyer of God.” The date, July 16, 1945, marks the zero point offaith. A loving, protective God lost all credibility before the unleashed furyof atomic destruction. Very few except the most fervent believers thought thatGod would—or could—do anything to stop our slide into self-annihilation.To get beyond the zero point, the nadir of belief, takes focus and effort. Faithmust be rebuilt from the ground up. Inertia would simply let it slip away, andthen one of the most powerful forces in human existence would be forgotten. Whatmakes the power of faith so remarkable is that it runs contrary to everything wethink we know about evolution based on survival. Survival is the ultimate needof every living thing. But human beings answer to multiple needs that areblended into a confusing, shadowy mass. In some cases, we struggle for food,shelter, and family. In other cases, those things are taken care of, and wedon’t give them a second thought. What makes faith so extraordinary is thatsometimes we live for invisible things so intangible that they cannot be putinto words. (Can you dissect the difference between “He shows a lot of heart”and “He shows a lot of soul”?) Yet matters of faith sometimes override everyother drive in our lives, even the drive to survive.In the same year that the atom bomb changed the world, the Allies liberated theconcentration camps that had carried out the Final Solution. Scenes ofunspeakable suffering were revealed, but so were stories of prisoners whovolunteered to die in place of others.One of the most inspiring examples was a Polish Franciscan friar named FatherMaximilian Kolbe, who died at Auschwitz in 1941. The Gestapo had arrested himfor harboring Jews in the monastery that he had founded in Niepokalanów; it wasa center for publishing Catholic devotional materials in Poland. Photos of himshow a resolute man with black-rimmed spectacles and close-cropped hair. He hadbeen a fervent proselyte for the faith and a missionary to Japan. While there,he had built a mountain mission near Nagasaki. Later when the atom bombdestroyed most of the city, the mission was untouched. Kolbe’s devotees hintedat divine inspiration because he had chosen to locate it on the side of themountain that would be shielded from the blast.Soon after he was transported to Auschwitz in May 1941, some prisoners hadsuccessfully escaped, and authorities decided to retaliate. They chose teninmates to be held in subterranean cells and starved to death. When one of thechosen cried out in anguish, Kolbe stepped forward and volunteered to take hisplace. He spent the next two weeks praying and leading the other condemned insong and prayer, always facing his tormentors resolutely. The other nine died,but Kolbe still survived. He was summarily executed with an injection ofcarbolic acid. His body was cremated in the Auschwitz ovens that becamesynonymous with the worst crimes against humanity.Father Kolbe’s death has always moved me, but it is entangled in the complexfate of modern faith and in the Catholic teaching about martyrs who die for God.His road to sainthood unfolded quickly. By 1950, two miraculous healings wereattributed to him. He was beatified in 1971 and canonized in 1982 by Pope JohnPaul II, a fellow Pole and sufferer at the hands of the Nazis. I’ve readdevotional accounts that Saint Maximilian, as he now is, emitted light when heprayed, and that Jews in Auschwitz stuck small notes into the floorboards oftheir bunkhouses before they went to their own death, attesting to hissupernatural faith.This sketch of a remarkable believer raises all the paradoxes of faith. Someonewho showed the greatest faith was not protected by God but was allowed to die.Instead of his life, it was his death that became the greatest thanks that Kolbecould give to God. Should we have faith in that kind of deity? Children aretaught that it is natural to worship God, yet miracle stories make ultimatefaith seem supernatural. The enormous divide between the rational and themagical seems unbridgeable here. But the miraculous aspect of saints—as opposedto their saintly behavior—is what appeals most to believers and is most scornedby skeptics.Kolbe’s story demonstrates that the seeds of both unbelief and belief exist inall of us. I have met few people whose faith made God a mighty fortress, asMartin Luther would have it. And I’ve met few who realized how tender faith canbe, as when Tagore says, “Faith is the bird that feels the light and sings whenthe dawn is still dark.” If your heart is touched by those words, you’ve arrivedat one of the deepest spiritual secrets: What is most tender can also beimmortal. As long as the heart survives, so will faith.Losing faith happens one person at a time, and so does regaining faith. I’mapproaching faith as the middle stage of renewing God. It isn’t the end stagebecause faith is belief, and belief falls short of knowledge. For some things amiddle stage isn’t necessary. When you order chocolate mousse in a restaurant,you don’t need to test your faith that it will come. But we can all feel theterror of concentration camp victims waiting for God to rescue them. Faithweakens when God doesn’t perform to our expectations; it weakens fatally whenGod seems to pay no attention at all.By whatever path, when you arrive at the zero point, much the same pattern ofdisappointment holds true.THE ZERO POINT OF FAITHHOW DID GOD FAIL YOU?He ignored your prayers.He allowed you to fall into danger and didn’t protect you.You don’t feel divine love.No mercy was shown to you.You got sick, and no healing came.You saw bad people prosper while goodness went unrewarded.There was abuse and violence in your life, and no one stopped it.An innocent child died.Accidents and trauma happened to you without reason.You suffered mentally through grief, anxiety, or depression, and God offered nocomfort.Every life has had at least a few of these occurrences and sometimes more.History is a graveyard of unanswered prayers by the millions of people who haveneedlessly suffered and died. Theology has come up with various excuses: theDeus otiosus, or “idle God,” whose role ended after the creation; and the Deusabsconditus, or “hidden God,” who is there and not there at the same time. Buttheology is cold comfort when God does not respond to us under desperatecircumstances. Most people believe—understandably so—that God should show hislove, mercy, and protection when the going gets tough. We can mostly handle thelesser crises ourselves.THE SKEPTICAL ALTERNATIVEOnce you have settled on the zero point, why leave it? If God doesn’t exist,it’s the most realistic place to be. I don’t want to replow the field ofatheism, but it does seem rational to take the world as it presents itself. Thisis the position taken by religious skeptics. God becomes another phenomenon,like the northern lights or cold fusion: Show me, and I’ll believe it.Skepticism demands visible proof; therefore it’s the opposite of faith. Abeliever doesn’t require God to knock at the front door with a government-issuedID.In our time, the most adamant skepticism has linked itself to science: Beforethey believe anything, hard-core skeptics want measurable data, experiments withresults that can be replicated, and impartial peer review—the whole apparatusassociated with the scientific method. If these are lacking, one’s belief islikely to be discredited, if not maligned. Skepticism sees itself a realistic, ahardheaded rebuttal of all the superstition, gullibility, and fantasy that holdsthe world in bondage.Michael Shermer, the editor of Skeptic magazine, quotes with approval a fellowskeptic who deems “the God question—atheist, agnostic, theist, whatever”—to bealtogether the wrong question to ask. What makes it wrong? “Gods that live onlyin people’s heads are far more powerful than those that live somewhere ‘outthere,’ for the simple reason that (1) there aren’t any of the latter varietyaround, and (2) the ones in our heads actually affect our lives.”On the list of disappointments that cause people to turn away from God, eachitem is positive to a skeptic, a wake-up call to face life as it is, not as wewish it to be.SKEPTICAL ANSWERS FOR DOUBTERSDid God ignore your prayer?Answer: Prayers are never answered at all. What you think inside your head hasno effect on outside events.Did God allow you to fall into danger? Did he fail to protect you?Answer: The risks you run are your own responsibility. Blaming a higher powersignals a failure of self-reliance, if not childish weakness. Nobody who ismature needs a supernatural parent in the sky.Do you not feel divine love?Answer: Love is the product of chemical reactions in the brain. It has noexistence outside its physical manifestation. The scientific truth is thatromantic love may be as much a fantasy as divine love.Was God’s mercy not shown to you?Answer: Mercy is wish-fulfillment, born of a futile desire to escape the laws ofnature. Every cause has its effect. The whole setup is mechanical. There is nofree pass from determinism.Did you get sick and no healing came?Answer: Disease is a complex process that medical science continues tounderstand better. One day, as research continues, we will know precisely whycertain illnesses befall certain people. At that point, new drugs will solve thewhole issue of healing.Have you seen bad people prosper while goodness went unrewarded?Answer: What we call good and bad are evolutionary traits that were developedfor survival. Once we understand natural selection more fully, we will know theoptimal behavior that holds societies together.That sampling will give you the gist of how skepticism views the zero point.Every complaint against God has a scientific answer. If current science fallsshort, there will eventually be a better answer in the future. Over the yearsI’ve found that the assumptions of the skeptics are far more pervasive than thearguments of the atheists. The skeptics feel that they occupy high groundbecause they are necessary to the progress of science. Without a handy skepticaround, we’d all still believe that Zeus throws thunderbolts.The skeptical point of view earns wide popular acceptance, I think, when itattacks easy targets. Skeptic magazine devotes many pages to exposingcharlatans, medical fraud, and pseudoscience. It gives almost no space to aserious consideration of speculative thinking about God, the soul,consciousness, and the nature of reality. It draws a fence around conventional,materialistic explanations (which are considered good and true); outside thefence lies the darkness of the deluded mind. Bringing down a medical quackserves a good purpose, no doubt. Exposing con men has marginal value, althoughit’s usually their victims who sound the alarm, not scientific skeptics. Butwhen the skeptical crusade encroaches on genuinely sincere, far-seeing thinkers,it turns noxious. Anyone who champions mind-body medicine, for example, isliable to the same ridicule as quacks. In the 1980s faculty members from medicalschools in Boston grew apoplectic whenever I—or any other M.D. interested inalternative treatments—proposed that the mind-body connection was real. Thespontaneous remission of cancer was almost totally ignored. (A prominentoncologist told me that cancer was a numbers game; he had no interest in therare case where a tumor vanished without medical treatment.) Skepticism doesgeneral harm by suppressing curiosity, hiding its intolerance behind the excusethat only official scientific guidelines are valid when exploring the unknown.One might call this institutionalized curiosity.God is much harder to get past the skeptics. To them, belief destroys a person’scredibility as a rational thinker. And once you use the fatal word supernatural,the way is open for contemptuous dismissal. Francis Collins, as I havementioned, is an eminent geneticist and the director of the National Institutesof Health; he is also a practicing, Bible-believing Christian. Uniquely placedas he is, he will serve as a prime test for faith as it stands next to reason.Collins recounts the spiritual experience that changed his life in The Languageof God:On a beautiful fall day, as I was hiking in the Cascade Mountains, the majestyand beauty of God’s creation overwhelmed my resistance. As I rounded a cornerand saw a beautiful and unexpected frozen waterfall, hundreds of feet high, Iknew the search was over. The next morning, I knelt in the dewy grass as the sunrose and surrendered to Jesus Christ.There is nothing to be skeptical about in this description of a peak experience,when the everyday world of appearances suddenly changes. For Collins, themeaning of his peak experience was religious, as it would be for almost anyseeker. But other minds work in other ways: the famous landscape photographerAnsel Adams had a similar thing happen to him while climbing in the SierraNevada, and his interpretation was an artistic epiphany. Both men experiencedwonder and awe before nature’s grandeur. Collins dedicated his inner life toChrist; Adams dedicated his to photography. A common thread runs through peakexperiences: In a sudden expansion of consciousness, the mask of the materialworld falls away, revealing hidden meaning.Sam Harris compares Collins (whose scientific credentials exceed Harris’s by anorder of magnitude) to a surgeon who has “attempted to operate using only histoes. His failure is predictable, spectacular and vile.” Leave aside thehostility. What Harris, and all like-minded skeptics, object to is the mind-setthat finds messages in nature, coded communications written in the beauty anddesign of mountains, sunsets, rainbows, and so on. Scorning the fact thatcountless people have seen God’s hand at work, he comments sarcastically onCollins’s experience:If this account of field research seems a little thin, don’t worry—a recentprofile of Collins in Time magazine offers supplementary data. Here, we learnthat the waterfall was frozen in three streams, which put the good doctor inmind of the Trinity.At this point, Harris remarks, “Thoughts of suicide might occur to any readerwho has placed undue trust in the intellectual integrity of his fellow humanbeings.” I don’t think so. Most readers would respect the experience as genuine.They might long for a peak experience of their own—I’ve never heard of anyonewho even remotely reacted to one with “thoughts of suicide”—and common sensewould tell them that Collins’s conversion has nothing to prove to science. Asthe noted mathematician and physicist Eugene Wigner remarked, “Where inSchrödinger’s equation is the joy of being alive?” If I say that I am in lovewith the most beautiful woman in the world, in what way is a skeptic provinganything when he points out the improbability of finding the one woman out ofthree billion who is the most beautiful?Human existence would be fatal without moments of inspiration. In exchange forsuch moments, when love, beauty, and the possibility of reaching higher realitybecome vividly true, we endure a great deal of tedium, routine, mundane work,and suffering. But skepticism denigrates inner illumination or tries to explainit away as some kind of brain anomaly. A 2007 article in Skeptic magazinereviewed a debate set up between Dawkins and Collins by Time magazine. Collins’sdefense of God rested on a belief that science is powerless to refute: “Godcannot be completely contained within nature.” As a skeptic views it, thisposition is a cop-out. It begs the question of whether God even exists andsidesteps the need to offer evidence.And yet the skeptical position is equally tied to assumptions of its own. Hereis how a timeless God looks from the viewpoint of an article in Skepticmagazine.If there is no time, there is no change. If there is no change, there is noaction. If there is no action, there is no creation. If God were to existoutside time, he would be impotent to do anything at all!This argument assumes that the timeless is a place that we can refer to the waywe refer to Pittsburgh or New Delhi. Thinking about anything that lies outsidetime is so difficult, if not impossible, that it baffles the most advancedphysicists in the world. The whole point is that logic breaks down there, and sodoes the linear world of cause and effect. Collins’s belief in a transcendentalGod permeates every spiritual tradition for a very good reason—the source ofnature cannot be found by looking around at nature.However, the flaws of skepticism don’t make faith perfect. In his book Collinsasserts that “of all the possible worldviews, atheism is the least rational.”This carries weight coming from a renowned scientist, but Collins’s exhortationto other fundamentalist Christians jangles against rationality, as most peopleunderstand the term: “As believers, you are right to hold fast to the concept ofGod as creator; you are right to hold fast to the truths of the Bible; you areright to hold fast to the conclusion that science offers no answers to the mostpressing questions of human existence.” Sir Isaac Newton, a confirmed Christian,might have agreed with every word. Two great scientists could still be religiousnuts—but it might not matter: Skepticism has taught everyone to be wary.It’s not a question of twisting science to make it agree with the Bible. Theharmony that Collins seeks between science and faith is extremely rational.God, who is not limited to space and time, created the universe and establishednatural laws that govern it. Seeking to populate this otherwise sterile universewith living creatures, God chose the elegant mechanism of evolution to createmicrobes, plants, and animals of all sorts.All he asks us to do is keep an open mind. Faith, as it has evolved in the ageof science, is about possibilities, not about dogma. If you have an open mind,you will have no trouble with the possibility that something beyond space andtime served as the source for the universe. The real issue—and this is where thecontroversy starts—is whether creation came out of “nothing,” that is, anonphysical source. Is there room in that nothingness for higher organization,the kind of mind that could have perfectly fit the laws of nature together tosuch a finely tuned degree that the slightest change would have spelled doom forthe early universe? After all, with an alteration of less than one billionth inthe law of gravity, for example, the nascent universe would have collapsed in onitself after the Big Bang; an alteration in the opposite direction would havecaused it to fly apart in uncontrollable winds of proto-gases, never to formatoms and molecules.The fine-tuning of the universe is indisputable, and we are the directbeneficiaries. Somehow creation emerged in such perfect harmony that human DNAarrived on the scene thirteen billion years later. Because Collins appliesreligious significance to the problem, he is excluded from the minds of thearch-skeptics. Harris gives him no credit for even holding a rational position.Skeptics never give anyone who thinks differently from them the benefit of thedoubt—their minds are closed. But the issue isn’t one of fair play. Every newdiscovery requires faith, including scientific discoveries. The list of thingsin our lives where we apply faith is impressive.IT TAKES FAITH …To believe in yourself.To believe in progress.To accept that reasoning solves problems.To trust your emotions.To reach moments of insight.To see beyond surface appearances and trust what you see.To let your body take care of itself.To feel bonded with another person.All these things are so basic that we take them for granted, as if having faithin God were altogether different and special, or supernatural and irrational.But the first science experiment in history required all these everyday acts offaith to be securely in place. It’s particularly strange that skeptics mockanyone who explores supernatural phenomena, since one item on the list—seeingbeyond surface appearances and trusting what you see—is a hallmark of science.Ghost hunters are doing nothing more or less than physicists hunting for quarks.Believing that the person next to you thinks the same way you do is a huge leapof faith. The brilliant early psychologist William James spoke of “the breachbetween one mind and another,” which cannot be bridged. Two brothers brought upin the same house with the same parenting have almost no chance of thinking theexact same way. One may love hunting and fishing, while the other loves to readProust. We accept on faith that our minds are connected. But suppose you sneakup behind someone, clap your hands loudly, and get no response. Is the persondeaf or simply ignoring you? Is he too absorbed in something else, or is heangry with you? Silence indicates immediately how far apart two minds actuallyare. Men like to complain that women want them to read their minds (He: “Whydidn’t you tell me that you didn’t want to meet my old girlfriend?” She: “Youshould have known.”). In fact, we spend our whole lives reading everyone else’smind as best we can.Then look at what happens when you lose faith in your body. We take nothing onfaith more than our hearts, which in a typical lifetime will beat without fail40 million times a year, or 2.8 billion times in seventy years. The mechanismthat sustains a heartbeat is so complex that modern medicine is only nowbeginning to grasp it. (For the average person, these mechanics, beingmicroscopic, are as invisible and mysterious as God.) But let the heart begin toshow signs of distress, as in the chest pains known as angina pectoris, and ourfaith is shattered. The result, for almost every heart patient, is high anxiety.We suddenly realize that a fist-sized bundle of twitching muscle tissue standsbetween life and death.Reducing every aspect of life to facts and hard data is, frankly, preposterous.(We would laugh away anyone who said, “I don’t believe you love your children.Show me a brain scan.”) The demands of skepticism appeal mostly to the cadre ofprofessional scientists who are bound to strict guidelines when they conductresearch. They must examine new results skeptically until viable proof appears.Einstein had to wait for his theory of relativity to be proved by observation,which happened during a solar eclipse in 1919; measurements by the astronomerSir Arthur Eddington bore out the theory’s prediction that light from distantstars would be bent in a curve by the sun’s gravitational field. But in thatexperiment, as in all experiments, the whole point is that science isn’t likereal life. Its constraints are artificial and specialized.The famous British philosopher Bertrand Russell was an avowed atheist; he made asplash with his 1927 essay, “Why I Am Not a Christian.” When Russell was askedhow he would defend his nonbelief if he died and wound up in heaven facing hismaker, he replied, “Not enough evidence, God, not enough evidence!” Skepticslike to quote that story, but it entirely misses the point. The rules ofevidence that apply to material things or events do not apply to God. He can’tfail a test he didn’t take. Let me explain.Imagine that a car has run off the road, resulting in a fatal accident in whichthe driver was killed. The highway patrol show up and find several bystanders.They are asked what happened. The first one says, “See those skid marks? I’m aphysicist, and this accident happened because the car’s momentum exceeded theforce of friction.” A second bystander shakes his head. “Look at the position ofthe wheels. The driver suddenly turned, and the car veered off the road intothis ditch. I’m an airline pilot. The accident was caused by veering offcourse.” A third bystander, detecting alcohol fumes from the corpse, announcesthat he’s a doctor, and the accident was caused by drunk driving.Each bystander has taken a different perspective and offered evidence for it.But notice that there is no scientific way to settle their differences. Theanswer you get depends upon the question you ask. Perception defines reality.Now imagine that a car rushes up and a distraught woman jumps out, crying,“Fred! You said you would kill yourself, but I never thought you’d go throughwith it.” Her explanation is the right one, because she understands the meaningof the accident. It was caused by the driver’s warped emotional state. Thelesson here is that descriptions never arrive at meaning. Skeptics, even ones asbrilliant as Russell, set up false expectations. No matter what kind of externaldata you arrive at (skid marks, turned wheels, alcohol in the bloodstream), youcan’t address the meaning of someone’s actions—or the motive for suicide.Martin Luther King, Jr., gave a reasonable guideline for getting beyondskepticism. “Faith,” he said, “is taking the first step even when you don’t seethe whole staircase.” Thinking about Collins’s conversion, I came away with somepractical principles that are perfectly compatible with rationality yet do notfall under the heavy hand of skepticism:Faith is personal. It doesn’t need to be justified to someone else.Faith is something you must participate in—you can’t judge it from the outside.Faith is a way of exploring reality, but it doesn’t have to pass scientifictesting.Faith looks beyond physical appearances.Faith is about meaning.I’ve gotten only one laugh out of skepticism. I was speaking on spiritualmatters to an audience in England. A heckler kept interrupting, and finally heleaped to his feet. “No one should listen to this rubbish!” he shouted. “It’sall nonsense.”Taken aback, I asked, “And who are you, sir?”He straightened himself up. “The head of the British skeptics’ society.”“I don’t believe you,” I said. The audience burst out laughing, and he stompedout of the hall.A BETTER DEFINITIONWhen God fails you personally, it strikes home. A best seller from the 1980ssummarizes loss of faith in its brilliant title, When Bad Things Happen to GoodPeople. Whether the bad things befall us at home or in Bosnia or Rwanda, themost basic trust that ties us to God—the promise that good will prevail overevil—frays and then snaps. There is only so much we can take on faith.I’d suggest that God’s failure is not enough to show that he doesn’t exist. Godcan’t succeed if he is just a disguise for ourselves—we’ve already met thisdeity as God 1.0. Imagine that you’ve prayed that someone close to you willrecover from lung cancer, but she dies anyway. God, like a super doctor whosemedicine didn’t work, has failed you. He didn’t give you what you wanted. Youhave no way to figure out why. Let’s say that the sick person was a chain smokerall her life. Then perhaps God was only being rational. He let the laws ofnature, as they operate in the human body, take their normal course.Or perhaps God chose justice over mercy. It seems fair that someone who ignoresevery warning about cigarettes and lung cancer shouldn’t be miraculously saved.A miracle would be an act of mercy, but what about everyone else who heeded thewarnings and then went on to be afflicted with cancer? Should a good shepherdsave only the black sheep? We can be sure that a fickle God modeled on humannature can’t be real; we constantly judge and blame him when the only thingwe’re relating to is an extension of ourselves.The reality of God is hidden behind a fiction of God. Buddha was asked toreassure his followers about the existence of God—who would know the answerbetter than the Enlightened One? But he took pains not to oblige, because theonly viable answer requires a personal journey. It’s not easy to get past ourimaginary ideas of spirituality, but we have to. It’s fascinating to Google thequestion “Where is heaven located?” One answer, taken from Genesis, is thatheaven is the atmospheric envelope surrounding the earth, because God said, “Letthe waters abound with an abundance of living creatures, and let birds fly abovethe earth across the face of the firmament of the heavens” (Genesis 1:20). Butthere is also Biblical authority for the celestial heavens, where the stars are,and a heaven beyond that, the paradise that is “the abode of God.” We are firmlyin the realm of God as a person who needs a home somewhere.The Catholic Encyclopedia makes the issue even more complicated. First, there isthe omnipresent heaven, which “is everywhere, as God is everywhere. According tothis view the blessed can move about freely in every part of the universe, andstill remain with God and see everywhere.” This answer gets past the image of ahumanized God who lives in one place. But is “place” even necessary? TheEncyclopedia recognizes a more abstract state, “the happy state of the just inthe next life.” After theological twists and turns, we arrive at the notion thatheaven is a condition of the soul, while some theologians still hold out for theimage taught in Sunday school—God, they argue, “should have a special andglorious abode, in which the blessed have their peculiar home and where theyusually abide, even though they be free to go about in this world.”These answers all depend on a depressing assumption: that ordinary people willhave no direct experience of God. A psychologist was asked why ordinary peoplewho aren’t addicted to gambling keep going to casinos, even though they know theodds are stacked against them. “Because every time the slot machine hits,” hereplied, “they’ve proved that God loves them.” Theology works out its tortuousanswers based on the word of great spiritual teachers. The rest of us are leftout in the cold. I’d suggest that the whole framework is wrong. In every lifeGod has a chance to succeed when you make a connection with higher reality, thehigher self, or higher consciousness—choose any terminology you want. Godbecomes more secure the stronger your connection becomes.Then and only then will heaven become real, too. Nor does it have to be the oneand only heaven. When people report having a near-death experience, some saythat they have seen heaven. The most common description is childlike. Heaven isa green rolling meadow with flowers and frisky baby animals under a clear bluesky. To a skeptic, such an image is too close to pictures seen in children’sbooks to be real. No doubt. But if we place heaven in consciousness—as a “stateof the soul”—there is no need for a fixed image or one for adults only. Leaveall images aside, and you have the blank slate where any depiction of heaven isviable; the blank slate is consciousness itself.LAYING DOWN CONDITIONSYour faith won’t be fully restored until God starts to perform again. Hisperformance must be consistent and reliable. It can’t be a game of chance, wishfulfillment, or an imaginary act that proves he loves you. Faith has to get youbeyond failed expectations and reopen the possibility that you can rely on God.This places a demand on God, and naturally many people are reluctant to do that.If demand is too strong a word, let’s rephrase it. When you ask God to perform,you are saying, “I believe you can do it.” In that way, faith becomesfunctional, a working connection.For centuries anyone who blamed God, even slightly, for a negative event wasbranded a heretic. Countless innocents suffered torture and death when theironly crime was asking questions. The holdover from that horrible era is theguilty thought What’s wrong with me? that comes to mind when you question thereligion of your fathers. When Daniel Dennett says that most religious peopleare conformists, the point isn’t wrong. People display more “belief inbelief”—showing allegiance to their religion in order to fit in—than true beliefitself.To be valid, belief must have a basis in reality. The only basis that makessense to me is to believe in a God who does what he promises to do. Take theelements of the Zero Point of Faith list (on this page) and reverse them. Faithis justified whenYour prayers are answered.Goodness prevails over evil.Innocence isn’t destroyed.You feel God’s love.God protects you.Providence provides for you.My position is that all these elements are real aspects of God; therefore wehave a right as believers to experience them. We aren’t like petulant childrenstamping our feet until we get what we want; we are asking God to act in hisnatural capacity. The bond between God and humankind is a living one. If that istrue, higher reality isn’t far away. There’s no set number of miles you have totravel, no fixed length of time on the road, to arrive there. Higher reality ishere and now once you are connected to it. It shapes the everyday reality weexperience with all its constant demands and challenges. Faith alone will notsuffice to bring it into your life. But without faith, you cannot envision whathigher reality is. You can’t test it or discover where it touches yourexistence.I am delighted by poets who transform their inner world into a meeting with thedivine. Hafiz (1325–89), a medieval Persian poet in the Sufi tradition, taughtthe Koran and held court posts. His subject matter was often worldly, reflectinglives of hunting, drinking, and other pleasures. He and other Persian poets cameup with wonderful epigrams, such as this one:Your soul long ago drowned in the middle of a vast seaWhile you pretend to be thirsty.Or this one about the purpose of life:Time is a factory where everyone slaves away,Earning enough love to break their own chains.Even more strikingly, Hafiz transforms everyday life, conveying the glowingessence that lies behind it. This gives rise to quite startling imagery.To really lose yourself is like holding a gun to your headAnd pulling the trigger—it takes guts.Facing the truth means tying a bag over your headUntil you suffocate—it takes faith.You have to be brave to follow God’s tracks into the unknownWhere so many things can overwhelm and panic you.This is the journey of faith rubbed down to raw psychology. Hafiz puts intowords the passion and insecurity that fill human existence, and we turn to himbecause he feels them so urgently. He describes a state where heart and mindjoin forces to find out the truth of life, down to its very roots. There is noeasy projection of a loving father.Trust me and plunge the jeweled dagger into your heart.This is what it takes to lose yourself.There is no other path back to God.I feel an instinctive truth in such poetry, but how do we turn inspiration intopracticality? Hafiz’s dagger thrust into the heart evokes the thrill of courage.But the real point is to turn your inner world into a place where you can meetGod. Poets feel free to do that. We can, too, once the zero point is loosenedup.Return again to the Zero Point of Faith list (on this page). For every item onthe list, there are several possibilities that can loosen up a stuck notion.Take the first item: God ignored my prayers. The skeptical position is thatprayers aren’t answered at all. Faith doesn’t have to promise that your nextprayer will be answered. Instead, it offers some new possibilities that open awindow to God. Here are some:At least one of my prayers was answered. I will see if that really happened.Perhaps the answer to my prayer is not in my best interest right now, and I needto pay attention to other blessings in my life.Not getting an answer made me realize that my prayer was too selfish and thatwhat I really wanted was much bigger.Maybe God didn’t answer my prayers, but he has answered someone else’s. I’lllook into it.Unanswered prayers could be a good thing. Maybe God gave me something betterthan what I prayed for.Faith is about new possibilities. Once you realize this, you are freed fromextremes of both absolute belief and absolute skepticism. The issue of prayerhas occasioned centuries of debate. Atheists claim that those centuries werewasted on a fiction; agnostics shrug and say that the answer is inconclusive.But nothing can be true until it’s tested. The possibilities opened by faith areliberating simply by being possible. In every case, a link is forged between theinner and outer worlds. God may be everywhere, as theology says, but he has toget there one step at a time.HOW TO HAVE FAITHESCAPING THE ZERO POINTPrayer: Open the possibility that your thoughts have an effect on the world “outthere.” A prayer is just a special kind of thought. If it makes a connectionwith the outer world, it may come true.Accidents: Open the possibility that all events have a meaning. Accidents areevents we can’t find a reason for. If we expand our vision and a reason isrevealed, there are no accidents.Bad luck: Open the possibility that good and bad are two halves of a singleunfolding process. If you can find out the higher purpose of your life, the twohalves will make sense. Then luck, good or bad, will be irrelevant.Suffering: Open the possibility that events are shaped to bring the leastsuffering. If divine mercy exists, perhaps it allows suffering only so that wecan grow and evolve. Then we don’t have to wrestle with what caused oursuffering. We only have to accept that there is a way out.Loneliness: Open the possibility that you have never been alone. If there is acomforting presence that exists everywhere, perhaps it lives inside you, notoutside. Loneliness is the natural result of feeling empty inside; the cure isinner fullness.We don’t have to stop here—I’ve only offered a handful of new possibilities. Forsome people, they won’t be satisfactory. To say that suffering is a means togrow and evolve, for example, will make no sense to someone who doesn’t believein the afterlife. Too many horrors remain inexplicable if all we’re given isthis one life. But I’m not foisting the afterlife on you. When you think aboutsuffering—which for millions of people is the deal breaker with God—find yourown new possibility. It could even be skeptical: “Suffering is meaningless, butthere’s a way to live without being destroyed by it.” Or “I fear suffering, butthere’s a possibility that I could get over my fear.”Just keep in mind that your aim is to free up fixed unbelief. You aren’t beingasked to take a leap of faith. But you can’t simply wait for God to appear.Stuckness is real, and becoming unstuck requires the flow of awareness. Takeeach item on the Zero Point of Faith list that applies to you, and write downthe new possibilities that branch out from it. Be as thorough as possible. Forexample, there is I don’t feel divine love. In the Christian West, where everylittle child knows the melody to “Jesus loves me, this I know,” not feelingGod’s love is a serious reason to give up on him. Yet think of the otherpossibilities:You could be more open to being loved by other people, which may open you todivine love.You could find someone who has felt God’s love, either in a book or in reallife. Perhaps there are lessons you can learn from their experience.You might start with the beauty of nature as a connection to a loving God.You might expand your definition of love. Maybe it’s not a warm feeling ofaffection but good health, well-being, and freedom from care and woe that showdivine love.These aren’t proofs of divine love and shouldn’t be mistaken for such. Farbetter to open your mind more and more as the path unfolds, because then youhave a real chance for transformation. Hafiz holds out that possibility inanother visionary verse:When the mind becomes like a beautiful womanIt bestows all that you want of a lover.Can you go that deep?Instead of making love in the bodyWith other children of God,Why not seek the true LoverWho is always in front of youWith open arms?Then you will be free of this world at lastLike me.If you feel touched by these words, you’ve found the starting point of faith.Faith has been described as a candle in the window, the light that waits for Godto see it. Perhaps a better image is one taken from the Indian spiritualtradition. Faith is like a lamp sitting in an open door. It shines out into theworld and inside the house at the same time. When the world “out there” is asfilled with God as the world “in here,” faith has fulfilled its role."},{"pageContent":"BAD FAITHBad faith leads us away from God. Many roads do this, and not all callthemselves religion. Science can be used as bad faith to undermine belief whileoffering no good alternative. This isn’t the same as labeling science the enemyof faith, because if your aim is to gain true knowledge of God, science may be agreat help. You can identify bad faith, by any name, by its results. The God itputs forward doesn’t make life better.Faith, like God, should be testable. A popular evangelist writes, “Faithactivates God.” Is that true? I can imagine both sides of a football gamekneeling to pray for victory (this scene often appears on television), andclearly one team won’t activate God, since it is going to lose. In horrificsituations where lives are lost, we can’t say that those who survived were theones whose faith activated God. Perhaps it should be the opposite. Perhaps Godneeds to activate faith. If he doesn’t, faith won’t have much to show foritself.Because faith is private, it’s tricky and often unfair to say that someone elseis guilty of bad faith. What we’re concerned with is the path to true knowledgeof God. Faith should help open the way. If instead it blocks the way, we cancall it bad faith for our purposes. This criterion seems to me limited and fair.It would be unfair to intrude where we don’t belong, just for the sake ofpointing fingers at someone else’s strange-seeming cult. All religions beganwith a small number of the fervent faithful; therefore all could have beenbranded as cults until they grew so large that they immunized themselves. By ourlimited definition, bad faith opposes spiritual growth. The leading suspects arethree:Blind faithRank prejudicePseudoscienceEach of these gives us scope to distinguish between faith as a guide tospiritual growth and faith as an obstacle to such growth. I once had adistinguished patient named Eknath Easwaran who told me more wise things aboutfaith than anyone else I’ve read or known. A person of refined mind andgentleness, Easwaran—this was his first name—came from Kerala in South India andemigrated to California, where he established a meditation center. (HisWikipedia entry features a picture of him lecturing to a full hall of Berkeleystudents in the fateful year of 1968. The caption says he was teaching the firstaccredited course in meditation given at a major university.) He died in 1999 atthe age of eighty-eight, having spent his life in devotion to the classicspiritual literature of India.I was raised by a religious mother and a physician father who placed his faithentirely in science. Over time, although my heart went out to my mother and herway of seeing the world, it was my father’s way that I chose to follow. Thisimposed a division inside me, and during my formative years I simply lived witha divided self—as most people do—paying almost all my attention to practicalaffairs. Becoming a doctor entails scientific training, and my aptitude for itcame easily. I became a living example of something that Eknath Easwaran putvery simply, so simply that most of us completely overlook it: “You are whateveryour faith is.”He wasn’t speaking in religious terms. By faith, he meant the core ideas andbeliefs you live by. If you believe that people are good and that life is fair,those ideas don’t sit inside you passively like pennies in a piggy bank. Theyare dynamic; they infuse who you are. You won’t need to refer to them the wayyou look up ideas in a book—in a very real sense, you are the sum of your innerconceptions.The implication, which I wish I had seen years before, is that everyone hasfaith. Faith lives through them. Human beings walk, talk, eat, and breathe theirpersonal faith. It can be a negative, even destructive faith, as when someonelives for revenge. Defending one’s religion by killing infidels is a destructivefaith disguised as a positive faith. Easwaran was simplifying a verse from theBhagavad Gita where Lord Krishna imparts to the warrior Arjuna the essence offaith:Everyone’s faith comes from the perceptions of the mind.O Arjuna, the ego-personality is the living embodiment of faith.Your faith is your identity.Suddenly faith is much more far-reaching than simply asking yourself, “Do Ibelieve in God?” If you are your faith, almost nothing that happens to you canbe left out. It then becomes vitally important to know good faith from bad. Badfaith embodies a set of core beliefs that are countered by good faith. Lookingat yourself honestly, you will see a confusing mixture of beliefs that arerooted in bad faith and other beliefs rooted in good faith. Untangling them isan important aspect of making faith work for you as it was meant to.BLIND FAITHEvery religion has dogmas that become matters of faith, binding the religioninto a community. A Muslim believes that the Prophet Muhammad recited the Koranat the command of the archangel Gabriel, who appeared to him one night as he wasmeditating in a cave above Mecca. Christians believe in the Resurrection andMormons in the Book of Mormon. The faithful are not to question these exclusivebeliefs—they are required to have blind faith.Enemies of religion tend to conflate blind faith with faith itself, quiteunfairly. Innocuous examples of faith get blurred into the extreme wrongs thatare justified by blind faith. Christopher Hitchens writes about a definingincident in his boyhood. At school one teacher, a pious widow, was in charge ofnature studies and the Bible. She fused the two, Hitchens recalls, when she saidone day, “So you see, children, how powerful and generous God is. He has madeall the trees and grass to be green, which is exactly the color that is mostrestful to our eyes. Imagine if instead, the vegetation was all purple, ororange, how awful that would be.”Most of us can recall hearing similar silly things being told to us as children.Adults are guilty of talking down, and it’s not hard to imagine that this woman,described as harmless and affectionate, had some fanciful religious ideas (nomore fanciful than the notion of heaven as a place where good Christians willone day sit on clouds playing harps). But Hitchens says that he was appalled bywhat she said—and he had an atheist epiphany.My little ankle-strap sandals curled with embarrassment for her. At the age ofnine I had not even a conception of the argument from design, or of Darwinianevolution as its rival.… I simply knew, almost as if I had privileged access toa higher authority, that my teacher had managed to get everything wrong in justtwo sentences. The eyes were adjusted to nature, and not the other way around.The last sentence is arguable, but what strikes me about a little boy’s epiphanyis that something like it occurs in every childhood. The moment comes when yourealize that adults make mistakes. This moment is disappointing because life issimpler when parents and teachers are perfect, but it also opens the way fordeveloping your own self. In short order, Hitchens began to question other“oddities,” as he calls them.If God created all things, for example, why should he be praised for doing whatcame naturally? “This seemed servile, apart from anything else.” If Jesus couldheal the blind as he chose, why didn’t he cure blindness itself? As for Jesushurling out devils that entered a herd of pigs, “that seemed sinister: more likeblack magic.” These questions are precocious, but Hitchens also had morecommonplace doubts. “With all this continual prayer, why no result? Why did Ihave to keep saying, in public, that I was a miserable sinner? Why was thesubject of sex considered so toxic?” Certainly these troubling questions haveled many people to a loss of faith, although that doesn’t mean they cannot beanswered. Hitchens made the leap into total shutdown in matters of religionthanks to another school incident:The headmaster, who … was a bit of a sadist and a closeted homosexual … wasgiving a no-nonsense talk to some of us one evening. “You may not see the pointof all this faith now,” he said. “But you will one day, when you start to loseloved ones.”This may seem like another example of harmless piety and a correct insight intohuman nature. It could have come from a kindly teacher who wasn’t a sadist orcloseted (presumably those tags were gratuitously thrown in to impugn thespeaker’s character). Millions of people have sought solace from grief throughtheir faith. But Hitchens recalls that he felt a stab of indignation anddisbelief. The headmaster was basically saying that “religion might not be true,but never mind that, since it can be relied upon for comfort. How contemptible.”It’s good to go back and reexamine the ideas that occur to us aschildren—especially if they are delivered, as Hitchens’s was, as if from ahigher authority. But children are impressionable, and formative experiencesstick. In this case, even though he was a professional writer and thinker,Hitchens never abandoned his first bout of indignation. He didn’t consider thatreligion might be simultaneously comforting and true—the two are mutuallyexclusive in his view. Blind disbelief has this in common with blind faith: Bothturn to zealotry through black and white thinking. (It’s worth noting thatcontempt and indignation became signature tones in Hitchens’s writing career.)Blind faith and blind unbelief have other things in common. They both refuse tobe tested. They condemn the other side. They depend on strong emotionalattachments. The main difference is that unbelief disguises its blindness behinda veil of reason. Thus Hitchens says that prayer brings “no result.” Thisdiscounts the countless people who declare that their prayers have beenanswered. A reasonable person would take this into account as evidence. Yet thefact remains that most articles of blind faith are not subject to testing fortruth or falsity. The Holy Trinity, the Immaculate Conception, Muhammad’s rideto Jerusalem on a flying horse and subsequent ascension to heaven—the call ofatheists to reject all religion on the basis of its unproven dogmas misses thepoint. Dogma is like an entry pass or club membership. Most people are born intoa religion and therefore automatically have a pass.Only later do they have a chance to examine the dogmatic side of their faith.Then three salient questions arise: What do I have to do? How much does itmatter? Will I be affected? Take the most basic of Christian dogmas: that Jesusdied and was resurrected from the tomb. This isn’t a belief that can be tested;you accept it blindly if you want to be a practicing Christian in most (but notall) denominations. To an outsider, accepting the Resurrection may seemirrational. But if you subject it to the three questions listed above, thisarticle of blind faith exists for more reasons than its believability to arational person.What do I have to do? For the vast majority of Christians, the answer isnothing. Belief in the Resurrection is passive except when Mass is taken, andthat is voluntary.How much does it matter? This is a more ambiguous question, since theResurrection is connected to the forgiveness of sins, a subject that pressesclose to home for Christians. Also, as a matter of conscience, believing in theResurrection is a pretty fundamental test—it’s hard to consider yourself aChristian if you wholeheartedly disbelieve that Jesus rose from the dead. Yeteven here the either/or thinking of militant atheists doesn’t apply. Moderntheology makes room for faith that lives side by side with doubt, and manydenominations long ago turned away from mystical events like the Resurrection infavor of doing good works and living a moral life.Will I be affected? Just because it is mystical, the Resurrection affectsChristians after they die, primarily, and go to heaven. Only then will theydiscover if Christ redeemed them from their sins. Even then, dogma isn’tuniform. Some denominations don’t teach about sin and redemption and they placelittle emphasis on Judgment Day. You can be a practicing Christian, in short,without being affected by the Resurrection.A popular evangelical saying holds that “Faith activates God.” If that’s what ittakes for God to be present, the stakes are higher than the minimal faith thatmany Christians feel. Without faith, God will remain inert; the Almighty, whohas asked you to take things on faith that in your heart of hearts you don’tbelieve, will ignore you. I reject this quid pro quo setup. A God that acceptsone person and rejects another cannot be divine, because, as we’ve seen, hewould be just imitating human nature. In this book, the criterion of faith isdifferent from blind acceptance. Faith is a stage on the way to true knowledgeof God. By that standard, blind faith is questionable but not fatal—far from it.As a mystical act, blind faith can open up subtle aspects of the mind. It canlead to an expanded view of reality and allow a person to see himself or herselfas multidimensional, existing on other planes beyond the physical.Blind faith has served such purposes for many centuries. No doubt the rise ofscience has lessened the power of dogma. On the whole, that’s to the good.Testable faith will be much more valuable than untestable. We can’t contest thedamage done by superstition and ignorance in the history of religion. On thewhole, blind faith deserves to be considered bad faith. But equating religionwith spirituality isn’t valid. You can question blind faith and reject itwithout doing harm to your spiritual journey. Indeed, you would probably helpyourself along the way.RANK PREJUDICEWhen religion creates divisions of intolerance and hatred, it is obviouslyguilty of bad faith. Southern churches—piously justifying slavery before theCivil War, then turning a blind eye to racial injustice for a centuryafterward—used God as a mask for rank prejudice.Some religious teachings actually consider it necessary for faith to beprejudiced. Several years ago I was doing research for a book on Jesus andsought out the writings of a recent pope (whose name doesn’t need to be singledout). I casually turned to the index reference under “Buddha” and read thefollowing opinion: Although some people see parallels between the lives of theBuddha and of Jesus, this is a false belief. Buddhism is a form of paganism,believed in by those who have not yet accepted that Jesus Christ is the saviorof the world. Another pope, when he was a cardinal, wrote the encyclicalcondemnation of Eastern meditation that became church doctrine, on the groundsthat meditation took Catholics away from praying to the Virgin Mary asintercessor with God. This reactionary posture saddened me. It is all tooprevalent in dogmatic faiths. Whatever the Bible or Koran condemns—be itinfidels, gay people, eating prohibited foods, or treating women asequals—cannot be challenged. Orthodoxy, when it turns into rank prejudice, isproud to ignore the changing times. Attitudes never evolve beyond the date ofancient scriptures.Religious intolerance has to be dealt with in every society and kept fromharming other people. Most believers won’t feel that the issue comes near totheir lives. The courts will be there to order blood transfusions for seriouslyill children over the religious objection of their parents or to uphold women’srights. Religion, in all its variety, will step into the marketplace of ideas asone voice among many for cutting-edge change like gay marriage. Yet for allthat, these issues do come near us as trials of conscience. I must state my ownbias here. Any form of us-versus-them thinking strikes me as bad faith.Religions draw into tight camps where their God is the only true God, forracial, tribal, political, and theological reasons. I find none of themjustified.We all know true believers who reject and even denigrate other faiths. RadicalIslam has done great harm to general tolerance for all faiths, just asanti-Semitism has for many centuries. My aim isn’t to impose my bias on anyoneelse. People remain prejudiced for irrational reasons; the best that can be saidis that religion is only one ingredient in the mix. Family upbringing oftenfosters more intolerance, I would imagine, than Sunday school. Rank prejudicebelongs to the underbelly of religious culture far more than to its officialteachings. The wise course is to let prejudice be what it has always been, atest of conscience. Each person must decide his own limits; each must take astand according to her own circumstances. As a general topic, rank prejudice isbad faith in its most egregious from. The fact is known to everyone, so not muchdiscussion is needed.On the other hand, there is much to say about pseudoscience, a form of bad faiththat occupies believers and unbelievers alike. Dawkins and company label someoneelse’s serious inquiry quackery if its thinking contradicts their narrow brandof science. In turn, militant atheism misuses the scientific method for its ownagenda. The term pseudoscience changes depending on what angle you look at itfrom.SCIENCE TAKES FAITH, TOOYou can make the argument that science should be atheistic in the most literalsense: It should leave God out entirely. God can’t be squeezed into a scientificmodel. It isn’t possible to subject him to experimental testing, and thereforeDawkins’s claim that God doesn’t meet the rigors of science is a blind alley. Bythe same token, the universe can be measured and explored without bringing inmatters of faith.But of course the simmering feud between science and faith runs deeper than therise of militant atheists or their avowed opponents, the creationists. Theirsideshow has little resonance in the laboratory. Bestseller lists don’tnecessarily reflect reality. By any realistic standard, the number of people whocrusade for either side is small. It distresses scientists far more that so manyAmericans—more than half, according to one poll—believe that creation could nothave taken place without at least some participation by God. (If it helps atall, I imagine that this belief is passive, much like believing in UFOs and theyeti.)The deeper reason for science facing off against religion in our day is thatreality has become too difficult to explain using even the most complexmechanistic models. The hard and fast line that used to divide science andmysticism has become hopelessly blurred. Could the universe be as alive as weare? Might it be capable of thinking? A hint comes in a quote from the lateBritish physicist David Bohm: “In some sense man is a microcosm of the universe;therefore what man is, is a clue to the universe.” Humans have always looked tonature as a mirror of ourselves. If we really are a microcosm, then themacrocosm—the universe at large—must be seen in terms of what makes us human.Suddenly one sees a rash of books by credentialed physicists arguing in favor ofa conscious universe, a living universe and even a universe shaped by humanperception. This poses a radical challenge to scientific materialism. It mightseem that Einstein was in a poetic mood when he declared that he wanted to knowthe mind of God. It’s a serious speculation, however, when Freeman Dyson writes,“Life may have succeeded against all odds in molding a universe to itspurposes.” In other words, since the only universe we can know anything aboutcomes to us through our minds, it may be that our minds shape reality. A redfilter makes everything look red, and if other colors exist, they can’t be knownas long as you are looking through a red filter.Looking through the human mind is more complex than holding up a piece ofcolored glass, but the same limitation holds. Our minds look at a baseballplayer hitting a home run and, being linear, perceive that the bat has to hitthe ball before it can sail over the fence. Simple cause and effect tells thetale. But we know from quantum physics that at a deeper level time goesbackward, and that the cause can be assigned after the effect takes place. So itis possible that cause and effect wouldn’t exist without a mind geared to seethings that way. If you are wedded to an outdated kind of materialism, such astatement sounds absurd. The habit of looking into the mirror of nature stoppedmaking sense when everything “out there” consisted of bits and pieces ofdata—all breadcrumbs and no loaf.We need to be clear about a very basic point: The visible universe isn’t thesame as reality. When solid objects are reduced to atoms and then to subatomicparticles, they are no longer solid. They are clouds of potentiality. As physicsdefines it, potentiality is neither matter nor energy but completely intangible,no matter how solid a mountain may be or how powerful a lightning bolt.Particles in such a state aren’t even particles anymore. They do not have aspecific location in space; instead, every particle emerges from quantum wavesthat can extend infinitely in all directions. Even if Dawkins could rescue thenotion that what you see is the benchmark for what is real, the most recenttheories of the cosmos propose that only 4 percent of the universe is made up ofmatter and energy that can be measured—the remaining 96 percent consists ofso-called dark matter and energy, which are little understood. They cannot beseen, only inferred.Physicist Joel Primack, who specializes in how the universe is constructed,offers the image of an ice cream cake, a “cosmic dessert” with a makeup thatwill astonish anyone. Most of the cake, 70 percent, is dark energy, sandwichedwith dark matter (25 percent) like chocolate cake and ice cream. Primack chooseschocolate because it is dark, while in reality dark matter and energy have neverbeen observed. This leaves only 5 percent of the cosmos that could be visible.Most of that (4.5 percent of the total) is taken up by floating atoms ofhydrogen and helium, along with various mixed atoms in deep space—call this theicing. All other visible matter, which includes stars and galaxies by thebillions and billions, are like a sprinkling of cinnamon on top of the cake. Theuniverse upon which materialists base reality, in other words, counts as 0.01percent of the cosmic dessert.All the evidence points in one direction: We need a new paradigm for explainingthe cosmos. We need to accept first and foremost that the last things to betrusted are the five senses. More than that, even cherished theories likerelativity have become drastically unstable. Dark energy is enlarging the spacebetween galaxies faster than the speed of light. So something beyond space andtime serves as the major force for creation and destruction in the cosmos, andwhatever it is, it will be as invisible as mind, God, the soul, and higherconsciousness.For decades, the outspoken British biologist Rupert Sheldrake has worked withcourageous vision to bring about a new paradigm; in the process he’s madehimself a lightning rod for materialists who cannot abide the notion thatinvisible things might be real. Sheldrake wrote a telling article on why badscience is like bad faith: “Bad religion is arrogant, self-righteous, dogmaticand intolerant. And so is bad science. But unlike religious fundamentalists,scientific fundamentalists do not realize that their opinions are based onfaith. They think they know the truth. They believe that science has alreadysolved the fundamental questions. The details still need working out, but inprinciple the answers are known.” This is exactly the position taken by Dawkins;he and his cohorts pursue a faith based on scientism, the belief that thescientific method will one day solve all problems.As a brand of faith, scientism seems more appealing than, say, creationism,which denies the evolution of the universe and life on Earth. But as Sheldrakepoints out, scientism has the harmful effect of suppressing thinking andresearch in any direction that doesn’t conform to conventional guidelines.“Science at its best is an open-minded method of inquiry, not a belief system.But the ‘scientific worldview,’ based on the materialist philosophy, isenormously prestigious because science has been so successful.”If science is a belief system, as faith-based as religion, then it betrays itsown principles. It becomes pseudoscience. But the average person—including theaverage working scientist—has no idea, really, of how much faith scienceactually takes. Sheldrake writes, “These materialist beliefs are often taken forgranted by scientists, not because they have thought about them critically, butbecause they haven’t. To deviate from them is heresy, and heresy harms careers.”Sheldrake has written brilliantly on the beliefs that all of us tend to take forgranted because of the prestige of science. Let me condense these beliefs into afew sentences:SCIENCE AS A BELIEF SYSTEMWHAT YOU MUST TAKE ON FAITHThe belief that the universe is a machine whose working parts can be explainedand diagrammed. Once that is accomplished, we will have a Theory of Everything.The human body is also a machine, and science will one day understand everyaspect down to the molecular level. Once that is accomplished, disease will beeradicated. In addition, all mental disorders will be cured with drugs.Nature is mindless, the product of random activity at the physical level.Science will one day convince us to stop believing that life has any innatepurpose other than survival.The evolutionary struggle for food and mating rights explains how human behaviorarose. Modern behavior is a direct result of Darwinian evolution. Our genesdetermined our destiny.The mind can be reduced to physical processes in the brain. Since theseprocesses follow strict laws of chemistry and physics, our lives aredeterministic. Free will plays no part or perhaps a very minor one.In this belief system anything tangible has priority over anything intangible.Dawkins belongs to the camp that traces every aspect of human psychology tonatural selection. This, too, is pure faith. There are no fossils of behavior,which is fortunate for Dawkins, because none of his theories can be tested. Ifhe claims that God arose as a survival mechanism, there is nothing either toprove or disprove the notion. The way is open for the most fancifulsuppositions. Let’s theorize that Paleolithic women started to wear necklacesbecause that attracted more powerful males, who then brought these women anextra mastodon steak as opposed to women who wore only earrings. Dawkins’s brandof evolutionary psychology traces behavior back to nothing more than made-upstories like this one.Unless you have faith that Darwin must apply to everything we think and do, itis obvious that his theory doesn’t. Natural selection means that a particulartrait makes you better at getting food or fighting for a mate. In what way doescave painting achieve either goal, or the love of a mother for her baby, or thepleasure we get from music? The general public has no idea how rigidly thebelief in evolutionary psychology is clung to. Religionists are accused,rightly, of arguing backward from God as a given which has to be true. BecauseGod must exist, a fundamentalist Christian can see God’s hand in plane crashes,hurricanes, or the divorce of a Hollywood star. Anything at all can be made tofit their sin-and-damnation scheme.Science is supposed to be the exact opposite of arguing from faith, yet forDawkins, the most improbable aspects of human behavior become survivalmechanisms. I smile reading Oscar Wilde’s quip, “Always forgive your enemies.Nothing annoys them so much.” Nobody can possibly prove that humor developed inour ancestors through a random genetic mutation. And how did such a mutationhelp them to survive? Maybe they got better at picking up girls at Stone Agesingles bars. When he scoffs at faith for not being based on facts, Dawkinscould aim the same accusation at his own field.Sheldrake dissects the unproven assumptions of materialism at length in his bookScience Set Free, which goes a long way to dismantling a worldview that isseriously fraying around the edges. He is realistic about the shortcomings ofhuman nature: “In both religion and science, some people are dishonest,exploitative, incompetent and exhibit other human failings.” But his conclusionis that science is being held back by “centuries-old assumptions that havehardened into dogmas.”Does that really affect how we think about God? Yes, quite directly. A universethat is meaningless can’t be divine. Random activity undermines all sense ofpurpose. A mind that arose out of electrochemical activity can’t know revelationor epiphany. The choice, for once, does come down to either/or. To me, it isself-evident that spiritual experiences exist, that we act out of free will, andthat our lives have meaning. One might claim, with deep conviction, that“natural religion” grew out of human experience, age upon age.Which means that science has a perfect right to be a belief system, too. Theonly demand one can make is that scientists own up to their articles of faith.Science doesn’t describe reality, because no school of philosophy has everproved that the physical universe is real. (Even Stephen Hawking, no believer inGod, has attested to this.) We assume that physical things are real, on theevidence of the information that enters through the five senses. But that is thesame as saying that we accept reality subjectively. Without sight, sound, touch,taste, and smell, there is no reality to experience.The surprising result is that God is on a level playing field with stars,galaxies, mountains, trees, and the sky. None of them can be objectivelyvalidated. “This rock feels hard” is no truer than “I feel God’s love.” But it’sno less true, either, since feeling is one sure way to navigate through theworld. If feeling that fire is hot and should not be touched is reliable, thenfeeling God’s love has the same claim to be reliable. What makes it seemunreliable is only a shift in worldviews. We are all embedded in the worldviewof materialism; therefore the assumption that spiritual experiences must beunreal has become an article of faith.The enormous question “What is reality?” will figure prominently in later pages,when we get to the topic of true knowledge about God. All of us, whetherscientist or believer, are led by reality. Wherever it takes us, we must follow.The discovery of fossils changed faith forever, as it led the mind into a newmodel of reality. At this moment, the same thing is happening thanks todiscoveries in all kinds of fields, including biology, physics, neuroscience,and genetics. A new model of reality is being shaped, and in turn it is shapingus.But change hasn’t overturned an ancient sentence from the Bible: “For as hethinks in his heart, so is he” (Proverbs 23:7). In other words, we are what ourthoughts have made of us. My friend Eknath Easwaran was echoing that sentence inhis view of faith as the invisible core inside everyone. Even older than theHebrew Bible is the Indian concept of shraddha, which is usually translated as“faith” but which includes everything we value, strive for, and envision. SaintJohn of the Cross wrote, “In the evening of life, we will be judged on lovealone.” In his world of Catholic devotion, the universe was created as a gift ofGod’s love, and our response to the gift indicates our worthiness to receive it.There is no need, however, to translate this truth in religious terms. Shraddhatells us that we live by what we love. To love God isn’t different from lovingscience, if that is what shapes your life at its very core.In bad faith, we insist that our beliefs should define reality for everyone. Ingood faith, we make the most of what we love and desire no less for everyone. Inthe Bhagavad Gita, Lord Krishna shows a sublime confidence in the power ofreality to lead us where we need to go: “As people approach me, I take them intomy love. All ways follow a path to me” (Gita 4:11). I call this the power ofreality rather than the power of God, since an omnipresent deity must be insideevery grain of reality, expressing itself through every experience. Sheermysticism? Only if you choose not to test it. The highest use of free will is tosee if it actually leads to God. Krishna limits his powers by saying that if aperson chooses no path, there is nothing God can do. The secret of human nature,fortunately, is that all of us follow the path of what we love the most.For the moment, faith is a way station. Eknath Easwaran looked deep enough intohis own life to believe one more thing: When a person is devoted with completefaith, the object of devotion is achieved. It doesn’t matter that he found thisidea in the Gita. What matters is that his life was long enough—and fullenough—to prove that it was true."},{"pageContent":"THE WISDOM AGENDAFaith makes life better. That’s the proposition before us. On the face of it,the proposition seems shaky. Faith quite often doesn’t bring the rewards thathave been promised over and over. Empty-handed faith may lead to disillusionmentor a broken heart. A touching example comes to mind. The world was shocked whenthe letters of Mother Teresa, long withheld by the Church, came to light in2007. The diminutive Albanian nun had died ten years before. Her work with thepoor in Calcutta made her a model of Christian charity far beyond the boundariesof Catholicism. Psychological experiments done at Harvard used films of MotherTeresa holding sick, orphaned babies in her arms and showed them to groups ofsubjects. Merely viewing these images caused beneficial physiological changes,decreasing blood pressure and offsetting various measures of stress.Suddenly her letters revealed that this saintly figure was wracked with doubts,which had tormented her at the beginning, middle, and end of her career. Theformer Agnes Bojaxhiu received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979, but that same yearshe wrote a letter to a priest with a desolate message in it.Jesus has a very special love for you. As for me, the silence and the emptinessis so great that I look and do not see, listen and do not hear.Those who campaign to see Mother Teresa canonized claim that her doubts make heran even more heroic exemplar of faith. (So strenuous was her spiritual strugglethat she used a cilice, the proverbial hair shirt or rough undergarment, thediscomfort of which reminds the wearer of Christ’s suffering.) But if you takethe letters literally, at face value, Mother Teresa had a knotty predicament.She tried to live according to a Christian ideal, only to be baffled when Goddidn’t listen or answer her. God never showed his presence to a great devotee,and therefore she had to confront deep disappointment and (as some atheistsgleefully point out) unresolved skepticism about the truth of religion.When belief is great, doubt is never far away. Too much is at stake. Even thoughshe was an outsize personality and a model of immense compassion, the “saint ofthe gutters” wasn’t all that different from ordinary believers who feel that Godhas abandoned them. Mother Teresa’s story reinforces my core conviction: Faithhas to make your life better in order to be valid. The legacy of religion can beviewed from afar, in terms of great historical epochs, but ultimately it comesdown to how people of faith have fared, one person at a time. If living asaintly life at the service of others leaves you in a state bereft of God, yourwell-being hasn’t improved. If holding fast to religion creates the basis forintolerance—much less torture and war—then an evil has been hatched in theworld. The proposition that faith brings a better life fails.What saves faith from this grim analysis is a counterforce: wisdom. Wisdomsupports faith, because both are about invisible things. Both must be tested oneperson at a time to see if they are valid. When you decide to live in goodfaith, what happens next? Life happens, between breakfast and dinner. What youthink, say, and do has to be shaped into something valuable. The whole questionof value is where wisdom applies. Every fork in the road, however small,requires a choice. The world’s wisdom traditions provide a guide, based onthousands of years of human experience, as to which choices enhance life themost. Let me give you a general sense of where wisdom points.WISE CHOICESTHE DECISIONS THAT SHAPE A CONSCIOUS LIFEWhen you are afraid and anxious, don’t trust the voice of fear.When you are in a chaotic situation, find a way to bring order and calm.When faced with an angry conflict, make no decision until the anger hassubsided. When you meet resistance to your cherished ideas, consider theviewpoint of those who resist you.When you are tempted to condemn someone else, see if what you hate in them ishidden away in yourself.When you are in trouble, decide if the situation is one you should put up with,try to fix, or walk away from. Having decided, act accordingly.When you know the truth, speak up for it.These are just some examples of wisdom in action; they apply to everydaysituations rather than great spiritual issues. There is a story in the Vedictradition about a young man who went in search of the secret of abundance. Formany months he traveled through the countryside until one day, deep in a forest,he met a spiritual master and asked how to make his dreams come true.“What do you really want?” the master asked.“I want to have untold wealth, but not for selfish reasons,” the young manreplied earnestly. “I want to use it to help the whole world. Can you pleasetell me the secret to creating such abundance?”The master nodded yes. “In the heart of every human being there are twogoddesses. Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth, is generous and beautiful. If youworship her, she may bestow you with treasures and riches, but she is capriciousand may also withdraw her favors without warning. The other goddess isSaraswati, the goddess of wisdom. If you venerate Saraswati and dedicateyourself to wisdom, Lakshmi will become jealous and pay more attention to you.The more you seek wisdom, the more fervently Lakshmi will chase you, showeringyou with wealth and abundance.”This advice goes beyond common pieces of wisdom that one might hear today, suchas “Do what you love, and the money will come” or even “Follow your bliss.” Thelessons of wisdom aren’t always blissful, and what you love can change. At adeep level, devoting yourself to Saraswati or wisdom is about connecting to whoyou really are, discovering and then using what is unique about you. In yourselfis the path to fulfillment. Take an external path instead, and all the rewardsof money, status, and possessions can end up being worthless, because youhaven’t really tapped into what would truly fulfill you. But telling someonethat money doesn’t buy happiness is futile—what it does buy feels good enough.The real problem is mental programming. If you have no other imprinting exceptmaterialism, the road less traveled doesn’t even exist. They tore it up to builda superhighway to the shopping mall.As with God, wisdom is valid only if it’s practical from day to day. But wisdomalso has long-range goals, and these too are the result of decisions. Everyspiritual tradition values the goal of peace over conflict, love over fear,understanding over judgment, good over evil. The reason we fail to achieve theselong-range goals isn’t a lack of vision. Libraries are stuffed with volumes ofwise teachings. Rather, the failure is due to the short-range decisions we makebetween breakfast and dinner. They shape our behavior, attitudes, beliefs, andeven our brains.The brain is predisposed, in a remarkable way, toward making decisions thatfavor goodness, and from an impossibly young age. Solid evidence has beengathered by the Infant Cognition Center at Yale University, where babies aretested to see if they have an innate moral sense. In one experiment a baby isshown a scene enacted by three dolls. One doll is trying to open a box, but thelid is too heavy for him to handle alone. The doll on the right helps him, andtogether they get the box open. The doll on the left slams the lid down instead,refusing to help.After the baby has seen this little drama, he or she is offered a choice. Wouldit like to play with the “good” doll or the “bad” doll? Over 80 percent of thetime, babies will reach for the good doll. This is for babies as young as threemonths old. Similarly, if an infant who has barely gotten beyond the crawlingstage sees his mother drop something on the floor, he will voluntarily pick itup and offer it to her. We can speculate on where this predisposition for goodbehavior comes from, but it constitutes the seed of wisdom. Not that thesituation is so simple that babies are always good. The Yale baby lab alsoconducts an experiment in which a “bad” doll is punished, and babies show atendency to favor the punishment rather than to forgive the bad doll. Frominfancy we have a predisposition not to forgive. This may be the seed ofus-versus-them thinking, which some researchers believe is also innate.The seed of goodness, if it is going to grow, takes years of teaching andexperience. Nurturing the good takes place invisibly, and you must have faith tokeep moving forward. Viewing our times from the outside—like the proverbialMartian landing in his spaceship to examine the human species—we see that highlyvisible things like war, crime, and violence trump wisdom. The great new savioris technology, and if 80 percent of college graduates in China are engineers,that shows what a forward-looking society China must be. Ask anyone what theythink the solution to global warming, overpopulation, or the worldwide AIDSpandemic will be (pick your own crippling dilemma), and almost certainly theywill say that their hopes are pinned on a future scientific breakthrough. Thenumber of people who expect us to be saved by wisdom will be very tiny indeed.That is shortsighted, however. Despite the treachery of history, wisdom hasthrived in the struggle against human folly. The nature of wisdom is that itgathers from the inside, creating a shift in the direction of higherconsciousness. We are visionary creatures. Our instinct is to move toward thelight. What does the poet William Blake mean when he says, “And throughout alleternity, I forgive you and you forgive me”? The statement is nonsense if youfocus on the war and strife that litter bloody history. But if you are convincedthat goodness prevails, it’s wisdom. When the Frank family were hiding out fromthe Nazis who occupied Amsterdam and hunted down their Jewish population, AnneFrank wrote in her diary, “Despite everything, I believe that people are reallygood at heart.” Is that credible once we know that the Gestapo eventually foundthe Franks and sent them to die in Auschwitz—and on the very last train thatdeparted from Holland? In the concentration camps, prisoners died from thehorrendous medical experiments performed by sadists like Josef Mengele,Auschwitz’s “angel of death,” yet with their last breath rare individualsblessed their tormentors. Such extraordinary behavior prevails over pain andsuffering, even in the face of certain death.Wisdom, instead of calculating good versus evil, considers the deeper value oflife. We are applying wisdom, for example, when we raise children. A baby has anabsolute status; in a good family it is an object of unquestioned love. As thebaby grows, the parents teach right from wrong. But they never say to theirchild, “The fact that you exist is wrong” or “You have brought more wrong intothe world than good.” This isn’t blind love; it’s just how love is supposed tobe. Wisdom tells us so.Wisdom is the ability to look beyond the surface of things. No ability is morevaluable. On the surface, a two-year-old throwing a tantrum is exasperating. Asshe screams bloody murder in the supermarket, the child’s mother looksembarrassed. People are staring with frowns on their faces. The mother sees intheir eyes that they think she’s a bad mother or can’t control her child. Thisis a moment for wisdom, which says that young children must be tolerated,guided, and loved for who they are, not judged for how they behave. Beyond theappearance of the situation, the mother understands that “the terrible twos” arejust a phase.Some mothers cannot base their reactions on wisdom. They grow angry at thechild. They blame him for causing a scene. They resort to scolding or physicalpunishment. Their first thoughts are about their own embarrassment and how badthey look in other people’s eyes. In other words, such mothers are trapped inthe superficial appearance of the situation. They are unable to see beyond it.We consult wisdom in all kinds of situations where gathering evidence isn’tapplicable. Wisdom sees what can’t be seen with the naked eye. God is a loftyexample, but there are many situations that only wisdom can resolve. For mostpeople, the first person in the Old Testament who comes to mind as wise is KingSolomon. In the most famous tale about him, two prostitutes appear before him ina bitter dispute. As one tells the story, she gave birth to a son in the housewhere both women lived. Three days later the other gave birth, too, but in thenight she rolled over and crushed her baby to death. Getting out of bed, sheexchanged her dead baby for the living one. No one else was in the house exceptthe two of them. The second prostitute says that this is all a lie. So who wasthe real mother of the living son?No doubt it was expected, since the king stood in for God, that Solomon woulddivine who was telling the truth. Instead, he set up a test.Then the king said, “Bring me a sword.” So they brought a sword for the king. Hethen gave an order: “Cut the living child in two and give half to one and halfto the other.”The woman whose son was alive was deeply moved out of love for him and said tothe king, “Please, my lord, give her the baby! Don’t kill him!”But the other said, “Neither I nor you shall have him. Cut him in two!”Then the king gave his ruling: “Give the living baby to the first woman. Do notkill him; she is his mother.” (1 Kings 3:24–27)The Bible doesn’t explain what made the judgment of Solomon so wise, only thatit was greeted with astonishment. “When all Israel heard the verdict the kinghad given, they held the king in awe, because they saw that he had wisdom fromGod to administer justice.” Today we might say that Solomon understood humannature. He knew that the real mother would rather give up her baby than see itdie. Yet there is something else. Wisdom is a surprise; it defies expectation;it leads to an unpredictable place.THE PATH OF WISDOMI’d venture that it is a mark of wisdom to believe in God. What makes it wise isour simple proposition that faith makes life better. Everyone wants to be happy.In the Indian tradition, you can choose two paths to happiness. One is the pathof pleasure; the other, the path of wisdom. The path of pleasure is based uponmaximizing all the experiences that feel good and minimizing those that feelbad. Instinctively children follow this path, not by choosing it but bypreferring pleasure over pain. The same instincts persist when we grow up. Ourbrains are wired to react to painful stimuli by storing them in memory assomething to avoid in the future. In the most primitive region of the brain, thereptilian brain, basic sensations of pain and pleasure create a strong physicalresponse, which is why we gravitate toward sex, food, and creature comfort.The path of wisdom must override this basic setup, and we do that all the time.A marathon runner endures pain for the sake of reaching the end of the race. Aprudent eater denies herself rich, fatty desserts for the sake of stayinghealthy. Human beings do not operate on the pleasure principle; we are toocomplex to be ruled by any simple brain mechanism. But prudent living isn’t thesame as living wisely. Nor is wisdom found in adages like “Things have a way ofworking themselves out” or “Time heals all wounds.” Wise saws are based oncollective experience, which can be helpful. It’s mostly true that time healsall wounds and that bad situations, if left alone, tend to work themselves out.But Socrates, the wisest man in Athens, opposed another school of philosophers,the Sophists, because they packaged wisdom and doled it out to their students inneat packages. Socrates held that wisdom could not be taught; in fact, that isits predominant characteristic.Wisdom is discovered inside a situation; it is elusive and changeable. Youcannot confine it to rules and adages. Most of the time wisdom startles usbecause it is so contrary to reason and common sense. A Buddhist parable makesthis point. In ancient India, a disciple hears of a great teacher residing in acave in remotest Tibet. He sells his worldly goods and makes the arduous journeyacross the Himalayas to find the cave. After many trials, the disciple arrivesat the cave and prostrates himself before the teacher.“I’m told that you are the wisest of men,” the disciple entreats. “Impart yourwisdom to me. Show me how to become enlightened.”The teacher is a grumpy old man who resents being disturbed by this intruder.Shaking his head, he replies, “Do you think wisdom is handed out for free? Bringme a bag of gold dust, and if you have brought enough, I will make youenlightened.”Hearing this, the disciple almost loses heart, but he gathers himself up andreturns to India, where he toils to fill a bag with gold dust. A long timepasses. Then the disciple retraces the arduous journey across the Himalayas andprostrates himself before the teacher.“I’ve done as you asked, master. I’ve filled a bag with gold dust so that youmight teach me the way to enlightenment.”The teacher holds out his hand. “Show me.”Trembling, the disciple takes the bag out from under his cloak, the payment foryears of slavery. The teacher grabs it and with a toss throws the gold into theair. Within seconds the wind has carried it away.“What? What?” the disciple cries in dismay.“I have no use for gold,” the teacher says. “I’m old and live in a cave. Don’tyou know that money cannot buy wisdom?”The disciple’s jaw falls; his head is swimming. Suddenly the teacher takes offhis shoe and slaps the disciple hard against the ear. At that instant, thedisciple is filled with total clarity. The truth dawns. He has awakened.Wisdom stories are often like this—they lead to a surprising conclusion becausethe mind, stuck in its conventional thinking, must be shocked into seeing thelight. The Christian version, which is much less dramatic, is condensed intoJesus’s teaching in Matthew 19:24, “Again I tell you, it is easier for a camelto go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom ofGod.” Both are about a mind that goes beyond worldly concerns. (I’ve told theBuddhist tale as I heard it, although later I discovered that it’s an amalgam ofstories told about two illustrious Tibetan masters, Naropa and Milarepa.)The path of wisdom has been called “the pathless path” just because it has nofixed guidelines. There’s no curriculum, and most frustrating of all, a teacherisn’t of much help. Mostly the teacher says, “I’ve been where you are now. Keepgoing.” The rest is taken on faith. If there were another way, frankly, mostpeople would take it. The path of pleasure had to fail before the path of wisdomhad a chance. In Buddhism, the seeker cannot take the first step until he or shehas given up on pleasure. This bald fact was encapsulated in a doctrine known asthe Four Noble Truths, which begins with “Life is suffering.” If you unpack thisbrutal statement, it comes down to the unreliability of pleasure. There isn’tenough pleasure in the world to stave off suffering. Some kinds of pain (such asthe death of a child or killing someone by accident) cannot be healed with extradoses of pleasure. Guilt and shame make deep, often permanent impressions. Thepast leaves scars. As if all of that weren’t enough, aging and death areinevitable.But something deeper is at work. The same thing that roots life in sufferingalso leads to the way out of suffering: self-awareness. We are the onlycreatures who have awareness that pain is inevitable. We can foresee futurepain, and that is enough to remove the savor of present pleasure. Withoutself-awareness, you can’t feel guilty about the bad things you’ve done or pastwounds that remind you of your failings. (As one mordant wit remarked, “I don’twant to come back after I die if it means going through junior high schoolagain.”)Self-awareness plunges us into the sad knowledge that we were born to suffer.But at the same time it offers a solution: the path of wisdom. Why was thedisciple suddenly enlightened when his teacher hit him on the head with hisshoe? The act itself wasn’t the reason. Rather, he had a stroke ofself-awareness, in which he realized that being in the world—working, raising afamily, learning how to do all the right things—takes place at a different levelfrom the truth. Of course the parable is simplistic. In real life, learning howto obey Christ’s injunction to “be in the world but not of it” takes years.Wisdom is a process of inner growth; it doesn’t come about instantly.Once you accept that life is suffering, the other three Noble Truths follow:Suffering is caused by attachment.There’s a way to bring suffering to an end.The path for ending suffering has eight necessary parts to it.The eight necessary parts (formally known as the Eightfold Path) are joinedtogether by the word right: right view, right intention, right speech, rightaction, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and rightconcentration. Leaving aside some terminology that is specifically Buddhist,such as mindfulness, the core issue comes down to a single question: What doesright mean? Unfortunately, no simple answer emerges. Buddha didn’t provide aplaybook for the game of life. His version of wisdom, like every other, cannotbe reduced to a formula with fixed rules.I realize that for many Buddhists, as for many Christians, the teaching ofwisdom winds up in some impossible contradictions. (You can work so hard atbeing good to others, for example, that you stop being good to yourself.) Thisis a major problem. When you look closely at Jesus’s teaching about turning theother cheek, it’s no wonder that very few Christians manage to follow it.“But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If someone strikes you on theright cheek, turn to him the other also. And if someone wants to sue you andtake your tunic, let him have your cloak as well. If someone forces you to goone mile, go with him two miles.” (Matthew 5:39–41)This passage from the New Testament falls under the Buddhist category of doingand thinking what is “right,” but we continue to ignore “resist not evil,” justas Buddhists and Hindus sometimes turn their backs on the doctrine of Ahimsa,which tells them to do no harm to any living creature. The path of wisdom veryoften defies common sense, human nature, and social practicalities. As a matterof course, we resist evil, punish wrongdoers, and refuse to go the extra mile.It is so counterintuitive to follow wisdom that there are only two choices:Either pay lip service to the great spiritual teachers while living your ownlife, or reduce their teachings to simple rules of morality and conduct.Neither alternative comes close to the intention of a Christ or a Buddha. Theywere not moralists. They were radicals who showed the way to innertransformation. I’m not condemning practicing Christians as failures when theyresist evil instead of turning the other cheek. It isn’t a failing, either, thatBuddhists reduce the Eightfold Path to an admirable cut-and-dried set of ethics.Human beings can always use reminders to be peaceful, treat other peopledecently, and act out of love instead of anger. By comparison, a teaching thatwould completely overturn everyday behavior seems more threatening than healing.So let me take a moment to defend the path of wisdom in all its radicalism.Since the Christian message is so well known (and has been temporarilydiscredited by right-wing fundamentalists), I’ll use Buddha and his solution forsuffering instead.DOCTOR BUDDHALooking around at the state of the world, we feel overwhelmed by its chaos,which seems to be teetering between madness and catastrophe. Yet when peoplecame to Buddha more than two thousand years ago, they brought the samecomplaints as ours. They felt helpless in the face of natural disasters, war,and poverty. They couldn’t comprehend a world on the edge of madness.When I was young, a few seminal ideas guided my life. One of them (now wellknown in the West) was expressed by Mahatma Gandhi: “Be the change that you wantto see in the world.” Because the world is so huge, it came as a revelation tome—and also a mystery—that by changing myself I could affect the world. The ideawasn’t original with Gandhi. It’s an offshoot of a much older idea, traceable toancient Vedic India, which says, “As you are, so is the world.” This is the sameas saying that the world begins in consciousness. Buddha was famously practical.He told people to stop analyzing the world and its troubles and to stop relyingon religious rituals and sacrifices.By refusing to accept a religious culture that had become rigid and divorcedfrom individual lives, Buddha was the avatar of the situation we find ourselvesin today, where God seems disconnected from the individual. Buddha didn’tjustify the social safety net of the priestly caste with its automaticconnection to the invisible world of spirit. Above all, he accepted theinescapable fact that each person is ultimately alone in the world. Thisaloneness is the very disease Buddha set out to cure.His cure was a waking-up process, in which suffering came to be seen as rootedin false consciousness, specifically in the dulled awareness that causes us toaccept illusion for reality. The steps of waking up have trickled down into theeveryday life of practicing Buddhists:• Meditate on the core of silence within the mind.• Observe the shifting contents of the mind carefully, separating out anythingthat sustains suffering and illusion.• Unravel the ego’s version of reality and pierce through the ego’s claim thatit knows how to live properly.• Face the truth that everything in nature is impermanent.• Let go of materialism in both its crude and subtle forms.• Become detached from the self and realize that the individual self is anillusion.• Be mindful of one’s being; overcome the distraction of thoughts andsensations.• Abide by a set of higher ethics whose basis is compassion for other people andreverence for life.Some or all of these things stand for Buddha’s path of wisdom, by which thedisease of suffering can be cured. So how is the cure proceeding? Let’s say thatan outsider is coming in from the cold. He or she wants to be free of pain andsuffering and wants to feel that life at its core is meaningful. An outsidercould think that the Buddhist cure has become difficult, complicated, andconfusing. Every aspect has its drawbacks:• Sitting and trying to find a core of silence is beyond the average person’sshort attention span and doesn’t fit into the hectic pace of modern life.• Watching and examining the shifting contents of the mind is time-consuming andexhausting.• Confronting the ego is nearly impossible, because it has a hundred heads forevery one you cut off.• Facing the truth that everything is impermanent frightens people.• Seeking detachment makes people think they will be giving up worldly successand comfort.• Abiding by a set of higher ethics makes people anxious that they will be preyto anyone who is stronger, less moral, and capable of using violence without anysense of guilt or remorse.Even if you believe that these objections are unfair to Buddhism, bringingwisdom to a world built on illusion and suffering is difficult. Solving violencethrough pacifism is unworkable. Detaching from materialism has little appealwhen people everywhere are rabid consumers of material goods. Yet the genius ofBuddha’s teaching lies in its universality, and whatever is universal is alsosimple enough for everyone to understand.Right now Buddha’s cure isn’t simple, because we fear being alone. By askingpeople to go inside, Buddhism seems to be asking them to be more alone. We arealso asked to strip ourselves of labels. Labels fit things you already seebefore you, things you already know. They work for Jell-O and Chryslers but notfor invisible things. Soul and God are therefore false labels. So is the self,which is tagged with misleading labels of all kinds. I can label myself anIndian male, a husband and father, a breadwinner, a citizen, and so on. Allthese are things I see and know already.Can I label my inner self the same way? No. To Buddha, God and the soul werequestion marks, because the seeker after God doesn’t even know who “I” am.Nothing is closer to each of us than our sense of self, but if it remains amystery, what good does it do us to pursue higher mysteries? Someone who seekssolace from God and communion with the soul has turned them into spiritualsecurity blankets. There is no comfort in the unknown, and it is pure wishfulfillment to think of God as anything but unknown—so Buddha taught.He was a master diagnostician of spiritual afflictions; he understood that whenpeople prayed to the Hindu gods, they were praying to creations of the mind, andthat what the mind creates has no lasting truth. Maybe a person can be cleverenough to disguise his ego while projecting it as an all-powerful, all-knowing,all-present deity. But whenever the known is projected into the unknown,something false is happening, and the truth moves further away. Wisdom is agreat respecter of the unknown. It isn’t distracted by the mind’s incessant needto create pleasing illusions.Buddha was a radical surgeon, cutting out all labels that put a name on theunknown. Naturally, people who came to him for comfort and solace were shockedthat he proposed major surgery. They saw themselves as humble seekers aftertruth, which they would hear from his lips. Buddha knew better than to satisfythem—instead, he overturned their expectations about how truth works.Truth isn’t found in words but through insight and self-discovery.Truth isn’t taught or learned. It is wrapped inside consciousness itself.Your consciousness must deepen until what is false has been left behind. Thentruth will exist by itself, strong and self-sufficient.These are universal statements applicable to everyone’s life. Yet Buddha’steaching became easy prey for the ego-personality. Let’s say that you are beingtrue to your higher self—or God or the soul—by practicing Ahimsa, the doctrineof nonviolence and reverence for life that one finds in every Eastern tradition.And not just there. The Hippocratic Oath taken by physicians, which begins“First, do no harm,” is an expression of Ahimsa. But Ahimsa can easily turn outto be part of the human disease rather than the cure. Following wherenonviolence leads, I may become a pacifist who finds himself hated by hiscountry for refusing to protect it from enemies. This hatred may lead topersecution, and so I become a martyr to the truth. I get thrown in jail—or inextremis I become a monk setting himself on fire in Vietnam to stir theconscience of the world—and in the end I suffer more than if I hadn’t learnedthis truth called Ahimsa.The web of the ego is complicated, and the negative possibilities I’ve mentionedhave marred the good intent of Ahimsa when it was put into practice. I couldpick another spiritual value instead, like love. People have killed in the nameof love and suffered terribly in countless ways. The positive is always woven inwith the negative. Truth can cause suffering; it can deepen the illusions of theseparate self. Does the good of nonviolence outweigh the bad? After all,peaceful disobedience freed India under Gandhi and led to civil rights reform inthe racist South under Martin Luther King, Jr., an avowed follower of Gandhi’sprinciples. Buddha didn’t measure truth that way. If it were enough to tellpeople to go and cause no harm, the human disease wouldn’t need a drastic cure.INNER REVOLUTIONBuddha wanted to pluck out the seed of illusion, not to feed the mind with newideals that would succumb to corruption. He aimed for nothing less than an innerrevolution. I think inner revolution is the purest form and the highest purposeof wisdom, as stated in the original Buddhist teachings, the Theravada, whoseaim was to make people not into Buddhists but into Buddhas.Coming in from the cold, modern people yearn for some kind of innertransformation because there is a hole inside them where God used to be.Buddha’s radical cure is necessary when nothing less will do. Filling the holewith a new image of God merely replaces one illusion with another. Some peoplewould disagree. In Mahayana, the “greater way” of Buddhism, personalenlightenment came to be seen as selfish. For me to try to become enlightened ina suffering world isn’t morally right. A different goal—compassion for allliving things—arose as a substitute ideal. Mahayana Buddhism stands for healingthe suffering we see all around us. One lifetime after another, each Bodhisattva(awakened person) is offered the choice between personal enlightenment (i.e.,saving himself) and service to humanity (i.e., postponing personal salvation).Always, they choose the latter. This is altruism that never ends—realistically,the world cannot be saved by a handful of enlightened beings, though it can bestrongly influenced.My mind comes back to practicalities. I can’t settle centuries-old disputesamong deep religious thinkers. The value of inner transformation doesn’t dependon Buddhism and right doctrine. The same promise was held out by the Vedic sageswho lived long before Buddha; by Socrates, who was born soon after Buddha died;and by Jesus five hundred years later. Each opened up the pathless path usingdifferent words. When you reach higher consciousness by any means, you no longerseparate what is good for you from what is good for everyone. Humanity containsBuddha nature (the source of compassion); the world contains Buddha nature; thecosmos is nothing but Buddha nature.The reason that the average person cannot live the pure teachings of Jesus orBuddha is that these teachings depend upon higher consciousness. Otherwise,turning the other cheek will get you beaten up twice as badly. Burning yourselfup to protest the Vietnam War will be an act of futile pain. Even devotingyourself to sick, orphaned babies in Calcutta might bring painfuldisillusionment. Most of the time, in fact, the teaching of wisdom can’t beapplied effectively to the surface of life. An inner revolution must occur alongthe way. By finding a new level of awareness, one solves the negatives ofBuddha’s radical cure—isolation, fear of detachment, anxiety about becoming weakand passive, the apprehension that nirvana will be cosmic loneliness.To me, the Eightfold Path represents a way to find out who you really are byinviting your awareness to show what it really is. Many practicing Buddhistsstrive for right action, right speech, or right thought because they are virtuesspouted by an enlightened person. I think there’s a better reason. These valuesare innate. They are part of every person’s makeup once we drop our disguises. Imentioned Ahimsa to show that it has hidden pitfalls. Those pitfalls exist ifyou struggle to be nonviolent, if you suppress your anger and resentment,disciplining yourself with gritted teeth to meet evil with good. At bottom youare still judging against yourself for harboring the seed of violence, andself-judgment is the root of guilt and shame. How can reminding yourself to bekind ever turn into spontaneous kindness? The mystery of Buddha’s cure is this:What you seek you already are.If people could see that the human disease is temporary, a station on the way toenlightenment, I think wisdom would speak to the world’s problems in very realways. Wisdom could guide trends that are already moving ahead. We are alreadybecoming more peaceful, for example. In the past forty years more than eightydictators have fallen. Deaths from large-scale conflicts, including civil wars,have drastically decreased. Even broader trends are moving in the rightdirection. In America, the past decade has seen declines in abortion, teenagepregnancy, drug use among the young, and overall violent crime. Wisdom tells usto nurture and guide these trends if we can.If you need somewhere to put your faith, look to the agenda of wisdom, which isbased on rising consciousness. The blueprint of the future is invisible, butsomething important is working its way through the global mind.IF WISDOM HAS ITS WAYA FUTURE BASED ON RAISING CONSCIOUSNESSMeditation will become mainstream.Natural ways of healing, both physical and psychological, will becomecommonplace.Prayer will be seen as real and efficacious.Manifestation of desires will be talked about as a real phenomenon.People will regain a connection to spirit. Individuals will find answersinwardly to their deepest spiritual questions. They will believe in theirprivate answers and live accordingly.Communities of belief will arise.Spiritual authorities will wane in influence.A wisdom tradition will grow to embrace the great spiritual teachings at theheart of every religion.Faith will no longer be seen as an irrational departure from reason and science.Wars will decline as peace becomes a social reality.Nature will regain its sacred value.These may seem like baby steps compared to Buddha’s deep teaching ofenlightenment or Jesus’s universal love. I feel just the opposite. Every stepforward contains a hint of Buddha nature. If you notice these hints and givethem value, they will expand, and in time they will fill the hole of lonelyisolation and the threat of meaninglessness. The path of wisdom is natural andopen to everyone. Einstein said as much when he considered how God relates toeveryday life: “Whatever there is of God in the universe, it must work itselfout and express itself through us.” In a sentence Einstein outlined the agendaof wisdom. Wisdom is the divine working itself out and expressing itself throughus.Wisdom tells us secrets before we have a right to know them. That’s the beautyof it. You don’t have to pray for wisdom or make yourself worthy of it. As withthe concept of grace in the New Testament, which falls like rain on the just andthe unjust alike, the ultimate truth simply is. When we catch a glimpse of it,we become more real in ourselves. It is undeniable that the outward appearanceof life contains suffering and distress. Wisdom reveals that suffering comes andgoes while a deeper reality never changes. That reality is founded on truth andlove.Faith makes life better because in the midst of pain and suffering, we need totrust that something else is more powerful. Your present self, in its unawakenedstate, isn’t your enemy or a cripple or a failure. It is Buddha waiting torealize itself. It’s the seed of wisdom needing to be nurtured."},{"pageContent":"ARE MIRACLES POSSIBLE?Miracles are a joyous release from everything we expect is possible. But theylay a trap for both sides of the God debate. For believers, if miracles aren’treal, then God might not be real either. For unbelievers, the trap is just theopposite: If a single miracle can be proven to have happened, then the door isopen for God. It might seem easy enough to validate a miracle and agree that itwas real—such effort has been going on for centuries. But there can be no commonground when both sides are deaf to each other’s arguments. Atheists areunconvinced by any amount of eyewitness testimony to a miracle. They deem fakeall apparitions of the Virgin Mary, of which there are hundreds. They regard allfaith healing as mere coincidence; the patient was about to recover anyway. Theythink psychic powers have no basis in fact, despite numerous controlled studiesto prove that they exist.One advantage of coming from India is that it remains a faith-based society,untouched in many regions by the inroads of modernism. A boy growing up in sucha setting could easily accept that supernatural occurrences were not deviationsfrom reality. They were part of the landscape where God seeped into every nookand crevice. One heard of holy men and women, for instance, who never ate foodor drank water. Their devotees claimed to have kept close watch for years, evendecades, without seeing any food pass the holy man’s mouth. For two weeks in2010, a branch of the Indian defense department put a yogi named Prahlad Janiunder hospital observation with round-the-clock attendants and closed-circuittelevision. Jani ate and drank nothing during that time and showed no changes inhis vital signs or metabolism. A team of thirty-five researchers took part inthe trial, so the possibility of collusion or fakery was basically nonexistent.Jani, who tested medically like someone half his age, was eighty-three and livedin a temple; his devotees said that he hadn’t eaten for seventy years. Skepticsdismissed the results on various grounds. Some pointed out that Jani was allowedto gargle and bathe, which gave him access to water. Others noted that he leftthe sealed room to sunbathe, and that devotees were occasionally given access.Since the results of the test were medically “impossible,” some form of cheatingmust have taken place.When such an episode is transposed from a society steeped in faith to a societysteeped in science, almost no reaction is possible except disbelief. Yet in theWest cases of the same kind have been documented. In the eighteenth century, aScottish girl named Janet McLeod lived for four years without eating. A detailedreport was submitted to the Royal Society in London in 1767 attesting to thereality of the case. While the Catholic Church has amassed its own records ofsaintly people who lived without eating or drinking, in other cases, such asJanet McLeod’s, there was no spiritual connection. In fact, she was deemedseriously ill.Even if you find the evidence compelling, what causes such an extraordinaryphenomenon? When the few individuals who have totally stopped eating are askedfor an explanation, they don’t agree. Some stopped as an act of faith; othersspontaneously began to live, they say, on sunlight or the life-force (prana). Ahandful quit eating as the result of illness, while a modern group callingthemselves Breatharians believe that the most natural way to gain nourishment isthrough the air we breathe.BEGINNING WITH “IMPOSSIBLE”Strong skeptics accept none of these accounts as anything but fraudulent ordelusional. In his 2011 book for young readers, The Magic of Reality, RichardDawkins devotes a chapter to miracles, which, as one would expect, he approacheswith a mixture of strict rationality and debunking fervor. The purpose of thebook, as encapsulated in its subtitle, is to instruct its readers in “How weknow what’s really true.” Dawkins’s agenda is given away by the cautionary wordreally, implying that there are ways of knowing the truth that might seem validbut aren’t.Miracles serve as an object lesson in every frailty of belief, from masshysteria to hallucination. Methodically Dawkins tells us that any number ofmiracles are the tricks of stage magicians working in front of credulousaudiences. At other times eyewitnesses are so primitive and childlike thatnatural phenomena awe them, as in the famous “cargo cults” that arose on theislands around New Guinea after World War II. The islanders had looked on asJapanese and Allied airplanes landed, unloading huge amounts of war supplies.They had never seen airplanes before, and the sudden influx of material goodsseemed to be a gift from the gods. When the foreigners disappeared after 1945,the islanders appealed to their gods to bring back the “cargo,” the materialgoods that had flowed in abundance. To entice the gods, the islanders builtcrude replicas of airstrips and planes. A supernatural significance was attachedto events that seem completely natural to us.Dawkins’s skepticism about miracles is certainly defensible. It’s possible, ashe argues, that the miracles recorded in the New Testament are just asunreliable as modern-day miracles but have acquired legitimacy simply throughthe passage of time. (Dawkins can’t control his tendency to insinuate badmotives, so he cheerfully tells young readers that miracles are generallyassociated with charlatans, implicitly including Jesus and the disciples.) But Iimagine his unsophisticated readership won’t spot the weakness of Dawkins’s“proof” that miracles don’t exist. Once more he relies on probabilities, just ashe does with God. He proposes that if any other explanation is more probablethan a true miracle, one must accept the alternative explanation.He prominently cites the “Miracle of the Sun” witnessed by numerous peoplegathered in an open field near Fatima, Portugal, on October 13, 1917. Thousandswere assembled (the estimate varies widely, from 3,000 to 400,000) because threeyoung shepherd children had predicted that the Virgin Mary would appear at noonthat day. For the children, who had already had visions of her, the predictioncame true. They reported seeing Mary, Jesus, and other holy apparitions. Whatmany eyewitnesses saw was something different but equally inexplicable.The day had been gray and rainy, soaking the ground and the expectantspectators. All at once the clouds parted, and the sun showed itself, not in itsusual brightness but as a dark, opaque orb. It radiated multicolored beamsacross the sky and on the whole landscape. Then the sun zigzagged its way closerto Earth, making some terrified observers believe that Judgment Day had arrived.After ten minutes the phenomenon was over, and as reported by local journalists,many witnesses attested that their clothing and the muddy ground had becomecompletely dry. After extensive examination, the Catholic Church recognized thegenuineness of the miracle in 1930.Dawkins cannot prove that such events didn’t occur. His task is simply to statedefinitively that they are impossible and then argue his way back from there.The problem is that “impossible” is the very assumption that miracles disprove(should they be real). To cover this weakness, Dawkins falls back onprobability, telling the young reader to consider two possibilities. A: The sunbehaves the way astronomy says it behaves. B: The sun jumps around the sky anddoes crazy things the way the eyewitnesses at Fatima claim. Which is morelikely? A sane, rational person must pick A, the view of science. He makes amore extended presentation than this, to the point of reducing astronomy to babytalk, but the gaping hole hasn’t been filled. Miracles defy science; they don’tcontradict it. Astronomy can be right 99.9999 percent of the time. That doesn’tdisprove miracles, and by the same token, the miracle of the sun doesn’tdisprove astronomy.The whole thing is an inescapable conundrum. Something has been intruding intoeveryday existence that must be explained. History was once on the side ofmiracles, which were accepted without question. Now skepticism is acceptedwithout question. Thus miracles are a vexing problem when we try to straightenout the muddle surrounding God. Do they have to be real for God to be real?No. When Thomas Jefferson edited his own version of the New Testament, hedeleted the miracles while retaining his faith. Among the four gospels, the Bookof John tells Jesus’s story without mentioning miracles, not even the virginbirth and the Christmas story. One has to be clear that every faith containsdenominations that accept God without accepting miracles. But skeptics usesupernatural as a buzzword for ignorant credulity. In his chapter on “thetawdriness of the miraculous,” Christopher Hitchens scoffs that “the age ofmiracles seems to lie somewhere in the past. If the religious were wise, or hadthe confidence of their convictions, they ought to welcome the eclipse of thisage of fraud and conjuring.”Most miracles, however, do not have a star player who offers amazing tricks.Jesus was an exception. More common was the appearance of the Virgin Mary in thehardscrabble village of Knock in Western Ireland in 1879. Two women walking inthe rain saw an illuminated tableau that replaced the back wall of the localchurch. They summoned thirteen other people, who attested to seeing the visionover the next two hours, when Mary appeared in white robes and a gold crown, herhands raised in prayer. She was flanked by Saint Joseph and John the Evangelist;before them was an altar circled by angels. The spectators ranged in age fromfive to seventy-five. They were strictly examined for truthfulness by the Churchthat same year and again in 1936. Other villagers who didn’t rush to the scenedescribed seeing bright light emanating from the locality of the church, andseveral healings occurred in the vicinity. There was no possibility of a stageillusionist, in any case. One can choose to shrug off the event as a fraud, massdelusion, or a phenomenon awaiting explanation. Without a doubt, however, allbelieved in what they saw.Hitchens is obviously wrong to label miracles petty and tawdry. Still, it’sundeniable that religion brings the supernatural down to earth, so to speak,from its home in another, invisible dimension. Saint Augustine declared, “Iwould not be a Christian except for the miracles.” The onus is on believers inmiracles—they must show that miracles can exist peaceably beside reason, logic,and science. We’ve already seen the limitations of choplogic, reason mixed withprejudice, and pseudoscience. Skeptics can’t disprove miracles, so they cutcorners to provide a show of proof. Faith has a stronger position, and notmerely by amassing eyewitness accounts of miraculous healing that extend even tothe present day. Faith sees the divine in every aspect of creation. All theworld’s wisdom traditions declare that there is only one reality, which embracesany conceivable phenomenon. If miracles have any chance, they must fit intoreality as securely as planets, trees, DNA, and the law of gravity.A SCIENTIST SEES A HEALINGEstablishing that miracles exist requires two steps. First, we have to take downthe wall that separates the natural from the supernatural. Fortunately, that’sfairly easy to do since the wall was artificial to begin with. The basis ofeverything in the physical world is the quantum domain. If anything deserves tobe called the zone of miracles, it is this level of nature. Here the laws thatmake miracles “impossible” are fluid. The constraints of space and time as weknow them do not hold.One of the most revered among modern Catholic saints was a humble southernItalian priest, Padre Pio (1887–1968), who caused consternation in the Church bygathering huge crowds and countless believers among the common people. Besideshealing the sick, one of Padre Pio’s miracles was bilocation, appearing in twoplaces at once. If this occurrence happened at the quantum level, miracles wouldbe a simple matter. Every particle in the universe can also transition into thestate of a wave embedded in the quantum field, and instead of existing in twoplaces at once, such waves exist everywhere at once.But Padre Pio wasn’t a quantum; therefore the behavior common to the subtlestlevel of nature can’t automatically be transferred to the grosser level where welive our lives. There must be a second step of proof, showing that the mergingof natural and supernatural takes place all around us. Skeptics consider thisstep impossible, but that’s far from the case. Scientists have been present forsupernatural events. There have been hundreds of controlled experiments inpsychic phenomena, for example. When a scientist views an actual miracle,however, the inner conflict that results is acute.In May 1902 a young French physician named Alexis Carrel boarded a train boundfor Lourdes. A friend, another doctor, had asked him to be in attendance on agroup of the sick who were traveling to the famous shrine in hopes of a cure.Normally the dying were not permitted on board, but a woman named Marie Baillyhad smuggled herself on. She was dying of complications from tuberculosis, thedisease that had killed both her parents. Her belly was hard and distended fromperitonitis; doctors in Lyon had refused to operate given the severe risk thatshe would die during surgery.During the trip Carrel was called to Bailly’s side when the woman becamesemiconscious. He examined her, confirmed the diagnosis of tubercularperitonitis, and predicted that she would die before reaching Lourdes. ButBailly regained consciousness, and when she insisted, against medical advice, onbeing carried to the healing pools, Carrel accompanied her. The reader will haveno trouble anticipating that I am about to recount a miraculous healing—Dossier54, the official medical records of Marie Bailly’s case, are among the mostfamous in Lourdes history. But the presence of Dr. Carrel makes the tale farmore enigmatic.Bailly was carried on a stretcher to the pools but was too fragile to beimmersed in the waters. She was in her mid-twenties and had already survived about of meningitis brought on by her TB, which she attributed to Lourdes water.Now she insisted that a pitcher of the pool’s water be poured over her swollenabdomen. Carrel, who was an assistant professor in the anatomy department of themedical faculty in Lyon, stood behind her stretcher taking notes. When the waterwas poured over her abdomen, which was covered by a blanket, Bailly felt hotpain, but she asked for a second application, which was less painful, and then athird, which gave her a pleasant sensation.Over the next half hour, her distended abdomen shrank under the blanket until itbecame completely flat. No discharge was seen from the body. Carrel examined thepatient. The hard mucinous mass that he had detected on the train was completelygone. Within a few days Bailly rode back to Lyon to tell her family about themiracle. She joined a charitable Catholic order that cared for the sick and diedin 1937 at the age of fifty-eight. A medical exam in the aftermath of herrecovery revealed that Bailly had no signs of tuberculosis; she passed allphysical and mental tests.For all the hundreds of thousands of visitors to Lourdes, the number ofconfirmed healings accredited by its medical bureau is scanty. In Bailly’s case,two other physicians besides Carrel attested to her cure, but the Churcheventually rejected the case as miraculous in 1964. They cited as their reasonthat the attending physicians had not considered the possibility ofpseudoscyesis, or false pregnancy. Skeptics have leaped on that diagnosis, eventhough false pregnancies do not reveal hard masses in the abdomen when aphysician palpates it; it is also unlikely that Bailly would have convinced anumber of physicians that she was dying if she wasn’t, or that her belly couldhave flattened in half an hour without discharge.But it’s Alexis Carrel who fascinates me, since he serves as a proxy for theinner struggle we experience between faith and reason. Having witnessed thehealing firsthand, Carrel returned to Lyon with no desire to publicize theevent. The University of Lyon was strongly anticlerical in the medicaldepartment. Unfortunately for him, a local newspaper carried a story aboutBailly’s healing, which became a sensation. Carrel was mentioned as one of thewitnesses, and he was forced to come forward with an account. He tried his bestto hedge, declaring that what he saw was real but must have some unknown naturalcause. But fence-sitting did him no good. When the medical faculty got the news,a senior professor told him, “It’s useless to insist, sir, that with views suchas these you can ever be received as a member of our faculty. We have no placefor you here.”Unable to secure a hospital appointment, Carrel emigrated to Canada, then to theUnited States, where he joined the newly established Rockefeller Institute forMedical Research in 1906. He remained intrigued by what he had seen but was nota believer in miracles—he had been brought up in a devout family and educated bythe Jesuits but was no longer a practicing Catholic by the time he became aphysician. Another event, fortuitous for him rather than miraculous, had shapedhis career. In 1894, when Carrel was a young surgeon, the president of France,Sadi Carnot, had been stabbed in the abdomen with a knife by an assassin. Alarge abdominal vein was severed, and there was no reliable surgical techniquefor suturing large blood vessels. Carnot lingered and died two days later.Carrel was then motivated to study the anatomy of blood vessels and the way theyconnect naturally or through surgery. For his work he was awarded the NobelPrize in medicine in 1912. Upon returning to France, he followed up on hisfascination with Bailly’s healing, returning to Lourdes repeatedly on the chancethat he might observe another possible miracle and find a natural explanation.In 1910 he witnessed an eighteen-month-old infant suddenly regain its sightafter being born blind. But he never satisfactorily resolved his perplexity.After the publication in France of his memoir, The Voyage to Lourdes, in 1948,four years after his death, Carrel became controversial: Scientific Americanpublished a skeptical article in 1994 (which also covered, with admiration, hiswork with blood vessels), yet he was hotly defended among the Catholic faithful.Where do miracles belong in regaining one’s faith? They would appear to be aprime example of “what you believe, you see.” The faithful are primed to acceptmiracles; skeptics are primed to reject them out of hand. This may seem obvious,but we can go deeper. If factors hidden inside your mind dictate yourperception, then the whole issue of searching for rock-solid evidence may be ared herring.The real issue is how to unite the natural and the supernatural, just as Dr.Carrel wanted to do. Separating the two is merely a habit. Science is made tofit inside one mental box, miracles inside another. The time has passed when theboxes have to be kept sealed. I want to show that you don’t have to abolishmiracles to have science—quite the opposite. When Einstein said that a sense ofawe and wonder was necessary for any great scientific discovery, he wasn’t beingsoft-minded. In a universe where visible matter accounts for only 0.01 percentof creation, it would be foolish to undertake science without a sense thatreality is extremely mysterious. Dark energy exists on the fringe of theunknowable, and so does a saint who exists without eating. The simplistic logicand outmoded science applied by Dawkins and company don’t remotely approach howreality works.In 1905 Pope Pius X declared that rigorous medical investigations must beconducted at Lourdes before any healing could be confirmed as miraculous. Todate, after extensive critical review, sixty-seven cures have been officiallyconfirmed as miracles. The latest, from 2002, is of a Frenchman who was healedof paralysis, an event that twenty physicians at the Lourdes Medical Bureau havelabeled “remarkable.” That’s a considerable distance from miraculous, but donumbers really matter? It would be necessary, not to tot up all the supposedmiracles in history, of which there are thousands, but to explain just one. Thesupernatural has no validity until it can be connected to the natural; a worldapart satisfies no one except believers, who are simply the reverse of skeptics,accepting as easily as their opposites reject.Because there is only one reality, it is continuous. Chopping reality up intoslices like a loaf of bread makes it more understandable. The slices that tasteof the supernatural can be thrown away. Science has made finer and finer cuts,getting near the very source of matter and energy. But if you claim that breadcomes only in slices, denying the whole loaf, you’ve made a mistake. The analogymay be humble, but this is the mistake made by modern science: It hasbrilliantly subdivided nature into tiny packets of knowledge while missing themiraculousness of the whole.NATURAL/SUPERNATURALThe healing of Marie Bailly may seem like a supernatural event, but it wassurrounded by everyday occurrences. Her sickness had proceeded normally. It wasabout to follow a natural course that ends in death. Then suddenly, withoutapparent cause, the seams of everyday existence came apart. What possibleexplanation begins to make sense of it? A hint of the answer was provideddecades ago by one of the most brilliant quantum pioneers, Wolfgang Pauli, whenhe said, “It is my personal opinion that in the science of the future realitywill neither be ‘psychic’ nor ‘physical’ but somehow both and somehow neither.”By using a word that science shuns—psychic—Pauli was pointing to a kind ofultimate mystery.The vast physical mechanism we call the universe behaves more like a mind thanlike a machine. How did mind ever find a way to manifest as the physical world?That question brings us to the merging of the natural and the supernatural,because the very fact that anything exists is supernatural—literally beyond therules of the natural world.SUPERNATURAL EVENTS, HERE AND NOWBEYOND ALL RULES AND EXPLANATIONS• No one can show at what point simple molecules, like the glucose in the brain,become conscious. Does blood sugar “think” when it enters the brain? It doesn’tthink in a test tube. What makes the difference?• Tissues automatically heal when they are injured or invaded by diseaseorganisms. The healing system spontaneously assesses the damage and brings theexact repairs needed. It defies explanation that a machine could learn how torepair itself. The laws of nature should dictate that physical breakdown ispermanent: Cars don’t inflate their punctured tires. Damaged organisms, if theyare subject to the same physical laws, should stay damaged—but some kind of Xfactor has changed that.• Ever since the Big Bang, the energy in the universe has been dissipating, likea hot stove cooling off. This dispersal of heat, known as entropy, isinexorable. Yet somehow islands of “negative entropy” have evolved. One of themis life on Earth. Instead of dissipating into the void of outer space, thesunlight that hits green plants begins the chain of life, holding on to energyand converting it into incredibly complex forms that hand the energy around,recycle it, and use it in creative ways. It is impossible for random events toexplain how entropy could be defied for billions of years.• DNA was born in a hostile environment filled with extreme heat and cold, toxicgases, and a firestorm of random chemical reactions. Unlike any chemical in theknown universe, DNA resisted being degraded into smaller molecules; instead itbuilt itself up into higher complexity and learned to replicate itself. Noexplanation for this unique activity has been offered.• All the cells in our bodies, trillions of them, contain the same DNA, yet theyspontaneously “know” how to become liver cells, heart cells, and all otherspecialized cells. In the embryonic brain, stem cells travel along precisepaths, stop when they reach their destination, and become specific neurons forseeing, hearing, controlling hormones, and thinking. This spontaneous ability to“know” how to suppress one part of the genetic code while enlivening others isinexplicable.• DNA can tell time. From the moment an ovum gets fertilized, a single cellcontains time-sensitive triggers for growing baby teeth, entering puberty,causing menopause, and eventually dying. How all these sequences, which spanseven decades or more, can be contained inside a chemical is beyond explanation.These mysteries—I’ve selected a mere handful out of many—cry out forexplanation. We mustn’t lose sight of what they have in common: They all defythe separation between natural and supernatural. If you aren’t wedded tomaterialism, then you will recognize that there is a common link between islandsof negative entropy, embryonic brain cells traveling to their final home, bloodsugar learning to think, and the rest. Intelligence is at work. In an uncannyway, molecules “know” what they are doing, whether in the ancestral chemicalsoup from which DNA emerged or in the chemistry of your brain cells as you readthis sentence.This implies a completely radical view of where the mind began and where itresides. The founder of quantum physics, Max Planck, had no doubt that mindwould eventually become the elephant in the room, an issue too massive andobvious to ignore. Planck is worth quoting in full:I regard consciousness as fundamental. I regard matter as derivative fromconsciousness. We cannot get behind consciousness. Everything that we talkabout, everything that we regard as existing, postulates consciousness.If mind is everywhere, we’ve taken a huge step toward merging the natural andthe supernatural. When a person like Marie Bailly is selected to be healed,that’s an act of intelligence, no matter how hidden its motives may be, and oncethe decision is made, the molecules in her body act as if directed—a naturalmiracle. The healing system we all depend upon, when we cut a finger or comedown with the flu, turns into a supernatural miracle. Yet neither can beexplained. So there is no reason, in theory, why the intelligence that guidesimmune cells to rush to the site of invading bacteria might not rush even morequickly to heal an incurable disease.In other words, there’s a sliding scale for the body’s response to disease. Letme sketch in the extremes of that sliding scale, keeping in mind than not asingle phase can be explained medically, even though one extreme is considerednatural and the other miraculous, i.e., supernatural.THE SPECTRUM OF HEALINGA patient gets sick and recovers in the expected time, without complications.Another patient contracts the same disease and recovers much faster or much moreslowly than normal.A patient contracts a life-threatening disease and dies.Another patient contracts a life-threatening disease and recovers with normalmedical treatment.Yet another patient contracts a life-threatening disease and recovers withouttreatment.Very rarely, a patient contracts a life-threatening disease and recoversinexplicably because healing happens too fast to fit the medical model.This wide range of outcomes defies any system of prediction. It is as quirky asthoughts, moods, and other mental events. Different bodies “decide” how torespond to the same physical condition.One of the everyday mysteries that medicine can’t explain is control by thehost. Every minute you and I inhale millions of microbes, viruses, allergens,and toxic substances. The vast majority reside in us harmlessly. Our bodiescontrol them from harming us. But when AIDS destroys the immune system, the hostloses control, and rampant disease breaks out in an autoimmune disorder likerheumatoid arthritis. The system for protecting the body turns upon it instead.Even an innocuous condition like hay fever indicates that control by the hosthas failed. In all these examples, the breakdown is a breakdown of intelligence.Thus mind is pervasive in every cell and swims invisibly through thebloodstream.CONSCIOUSNESS HOLDS THE KEYThe reason that mixing mind with matter disturbs mainstream doctors, who aretrained to be scientific, isn’t a secret. Mind rules the subjective world, whichscience distrusts, while matter is the basis of “real” knowledge. Heart patientsfeel all kinds of pain, pressure, and strangeness about their condition; anangiogram tells the doctor what’s really going on.Subjectivity is mistrusted for being fickle, individual, shifting, and prey toall kinds of bias. But this mistrust exhibits a strange prejudice, for the bodydisplays all these qualities. Bodies are fickle and highly individual. They makedecisions about getting sick that cannot be explained. Medicine has no idea whysomeone develops a sudden allergy after years of not being allergic. When yourbody confronts a single cold virus, unpredictability is at work. (Medicine knowsthat direct contact with a new cold virus infects people only around one ineight times. Why this is so cannot be explained.)I’m sure that Planck and Pauli were right to suspect that consciousness is morethan a given, and that mind and matter are indissolubly linked. Amongphysicists, these two were not alone. Mind holds some kind of key to theultimate nature of reality. Once you admit that this is true, the possibility ofmiraculous events increases, because the non-miraculous has shifted so much.Natural and supernatural are infused with the same properties of consciousness.It turns out that supernatural is the label we apply to things we aren’t yetcomfortable with. In reality, nature goes to the same source to create a galaxyas we go to think of a rose. The field of consciousness embraces both.CONSCIOUS CREATIONWHAT IT TAKES TO MAKE ANYTHING HAPPENIntelligenceIntentionAttentionA bridge from mind to matterAn observerA connection between events “in here” and events “out there”Everything on this list is built into our awareness. As conscious beings, we usethem every day, almost entirely without being aware of what we’re doing. If youhave a math problem to solve, you can select one aspect—intelligence—and focusit on the problem. If your mind wanders from a task, you can bring in anotheraspect—intention—to combat your distracted mood. So you have no need to goanywhere outside yourself. You possess everything it takes to make themiraculous live peaceably with the rational. The essential thing is that realityis participatory. Nothing is real for us outside our experience of it, andexperience is a conscious creative act.This sounds strange at first. How am I participating when I see the stars atnight? The act feels passive. In fact, seeing the stars—or anything atall—requires having every ingredient on the list:Intelligence: I know what I am looking at and can think about it. Microbes andplants exist under the same stars but are (presumably) unable to think aboutthem.Intention: I purposely focus on the stars. I see them in particular, as opposedto a photograph, which indiscriminately depicts all objects without singling anyout.Attention: I consciously focus my mind. If my attention is elsewhere—walkinghome in the dark, listening to music on my iPod, wondering who is walking upbehind me—the stars lose my attention.A bridge from mind to matter: Experiences can’t happen without processing in thebrain. How photons of light from the stars turn into a visual image in the mindhas never been explained. However, it is undeniable that I am experiencing thestars, so something is bridging the purely mental and the physical.An observer: Without me, an observer, there is no proof that the stars exist.This is why Heisenberg declared that consciousness is something science cannotget behind, or go beyond. We only know that we are here observing the world.What happens when nobody observes it is a mystery.A connection between events “in here” and events “out there”: Quantum theory, aspart of the so-called observer effect, holds that observation isn’t passive. Itcauses waves to collapse into particles. Something that is invisible,all-pervasive, and subject to the laws of probability turns into something elsethat is local, physical, and certain. One interpretation calls the observereffect a small glitch in the mathematics that support quantum mechanics. Anotherinterpretation says that the observer effect operates in the real world. Ineither case, events “in here” are tied to events “out there.”Have I just done what I accused science of doing: cutting up reality into smallslices? In the everyday world, all these ingredients merge and operate together.To participate in seeing the stars—or in seeing the Virgin Mary where a churchwall should be—you call upon the same aspects of consciousness. None can be leftout. What is more important, science does not understand these aspects ofconsciousness. Are miracles all in your mind? Yes. Is the everyday world all inyour mind? Yes again. Having turned its back on consciousness for severalhundred years, science is hardly in a position to say what consciousness can orcannot do. The crude manipulations of science by Dawkins and company are evenless credible.Neither Planck nor Pauli followed up on the mystery they had uncovered. They hadno need to, not for a long time. Quantum physics blossomed into the mostaccurate and mathematically sophisticated model in the history of science. Itachieved such precise results that its predictive powers were stunning. As theeminent British physicist Sir Roger Penrose notes, Newton’s gravitationaltheory, as applied to the movement of the solar system, is precise to one partin 10 million. Einstein’s theory of relativity improved upon Newton by anotherfactor of 10 million.As spooky as the domain of quarks and bosons may be, even to trained physicists,it obeys mathematical rules and can be predicted using those same rules.Reality, it cannot be denied, has led science along a very productive path. Butleaving consciousness out of the equation was like leaving metaphysics out ofcookbooks. You don’t need metaphysics to measure cake flour and butter, but thecommitment to follow reality wherever it leads can make science veryuncomfortable, especially when it’s time to overturn some cherished assumptions.That time inevitably arrives, for one simple reason: Reality is always morecomplicated than the models we use to explain it.Every experience we have, mental or physical, is a miracle, because we have noway of explaining experience scientifically. We assume that photons give us theexperience of form and color, yet photons are formless and colorless. We assumethat the vibration of air creates sound, but vibrations are silent outside thebrain. We study the receptor sites on the tongue and inside the nose that giverise to taste and smell, yet what takes place at those sites is chemicalreactions, not an experience. (What did it taste like for oxygen and hydrogen tobond into a molecule of water? The question is meaningless without anexperiencer.)Materialism, in its conquest of the spiritual worldview, has burdened us withexplanations requiring just as much faith as believing in miracles. Faith alonesupports the notion that sodium and potassium ions passing through the outermembrane of neurons, in turn setting up electrochemical reactions that spanmillions of neural networks, create sensations, images, feelings, and thoughts.These are assumptions with no explanation whatsoever. Chemicals are just nameswe have applied to a mystery. Brain scans are snapshots of activity, telling usnothing about actual experience, just as snapshots of piano keys tell us nothingabout the experience of enjoying music. Only consciousness makes experiencepossible; therefore, as the source of consciousness, God exists outside thedomain of data.The same road that leads to miracles leads to God. We haven’t traveled the roadyet. We’ve only made the goal possible. That is the role of faith, to expand therange of possibilities. I am not asking anyone to believe in miracles; stillless am I attesting to the miracles amassed by the church. All that thesupernatural needed, to escape the ridicule of skeptics, was a level playingfield. Nature can accommodate any imaginable event. The next step is to turn thehighest possibilities, so long cherished in the human heart, into reality."},{"pageContent":"THE PATH TO GODStage 3: Knowledge"},{"pageContent":"GOD WITHOUT BORDERSEvery time God falters, he comes back tomorrow.

Looking over our shoulder, we have no difficultydistinguishing Jehovah, whose favorite command is “Smite!” from the God ofChristianity, whose favorite command is “Love” (but leaving wiggle room for agood deal of smiting). It’s harder to see how God will look in the future,however. Almost every divine attribute has been extracted, like silk threadspulled from a cosmic tapestry until the fabric is bare. What’s left after you’vetried vengeance, love, and everything in between?In the West one aspect of God has been ignored, a unique trait that is sharedwith nothing else in creation. It’s not that God sees and knows everything. It’snot that he is infinitely loving and all powerful. Religion has tested all thosequalities, only to end in disappointment. It’s inspirational to read, “The Lordis my shepherd, I shall not want,” until the day comes when you have many wantsand God does nothing about them. But something has been missed that makes Godabsolutely unique: He cannot be put into a box. As curious as this sounds, it’sthe most important thing about God. It holds the clue that will lead us to trueknowledge. Quite literally, to find God, you must go outside the box.There are two kinds of boxes that we put things into. One is physical. If youwant to study a horned toad, a quark, or a star, you first isolate it as aphysical specimen. Sometimes the box isn’t literal. No one can containerize astar. But a star is perceived as a thing, an object that sits alone, ready to bestudied. God fits into no such box, although the old Sunday-school image of apatriarch sitting on his throne above the clouds attempts to do that.The other kind of box is mental. In it we put ideas and concepts. Freedom is aconcept, and so is enlightenment. Even though they aren’t physical, we still setideas aside to think about them. A very broad concept that applies to everyoneon Earth, such as human nature, still fits into a box, ready to be studied likea star or a quark. It doesn’t matter that human nature is invisible and verytricky to define. It has to have boundaries that make it different from, say,Buddha nature or the nature of a wolf—the boundaries are its box.God has no boundaries, however—not if he is omnipresent, which means “everywhereat once.” (He falsely puts God into a box labeled “masculine,” so it’s worthrepeating that we’re using a gender only for the sake of convenience.) Trying tothink about him means trying to think about everything at once, which is clearlyimpossible. People try to get around this impossibility by breaking down Godinto smaller parts, the way a mechanic breaks down a car engine or a biologist aheart cell. But what works with car engines and brain cells doesn’t work withGod. Let’s say you want to talk about God’s love, which people often do. “God’slove is eternal and infinite. When I get to heaven, I will bask in his eternallove”: This is a religious sentiment that millions of people might say and hopeis true. But in fact the words have no meaning.Infinite is being used to mean “very, very big,” but infinity cannot beconceived of that way. Our minds think in finite terms. We look around and seethat everything in nature has a beginning and an end. Infinity doesn’t. It liesoutside our ability to count; it is incompatible with how our minds work inlinear time. The only practical use for the word infinite is to denote anabstract mathematical concept. We can’t meaningfully say that God is very, verybig when size doesn’t apply to him.Eternal is being used in the sentence to mean “a very long time.” But eternityisn’t linear the way that hours, days, and years are. Eternity is infinityapplied to time. Therefore the same objection that makes infinity inconceivableapplies to eternity. The mind can’t wrap itself around time without beginning orend. We can’t meaningfully say that God has been around a long, long time whentime itself doesn’t apply to him.Love is being used to mean the kind of deep affection and caring that is humanlove. But God’s love doesn’t pick and choose, so it applies to serial killers,Adolf Hitler, Chairman Mao, and all other monsters in history. It applies to allcriminal acts as well as to holy acts. Therefore divine love is more like anatural force field—gravity, for instance—than a human emotion. Such love can’tbe expressed into human emotional terms.I didn’t pick a trick sentence here but a fairly typical one. Nor was thewording sloppy, needing a copy editor’s red pencil to fix it. Infinite, eternal,and love simply aren’t the right words. They force God into a mental box wherehe won’t fit. There is nothing to be done about it. Yet the journey to know Godbegins where words fail us. We can ditch the scriptures, sermons, andinspirational writings that have failed us. Faith brought us to a level playingfield where God is a real possibility. Beyond faith lie experiences that cannotbe put into words. Yet the path is real, and the ability to make the journey isimprinted in the human mind itself.WHAT CANNOT BE THOUGHTThe journey has already begun by acknowledging that it is impossible to thinkabout God the way we think about everything else. If we can’t think about him,we can’t talk about him, either. As the Vedic seers of India declared, “Thosewho speak of it know it not. Those who know it, speak of it not.” Like a cosmicHoudini, God will escape every kind of box, including all the ones we dependupon the most: time, space, feelings, ideas, and concepts. Hence the mystery.All the thinking and talking about God that we do is symbolic; thankfullysymbols can point the way. The New Testament reaches to find words for God’strue nature: “I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and thelast” (Revelation 22:13). More concretely, God has been compared to a calm,still ocean, from which all created things arise like waves. Another symbol islight, by which all things can be seen even though it is invisible. It would bemuch more convenient if he could be described without symbols. Unfortunately,religion cannot exist without symbols, labels, and categories. When Dawkins andcompany attack God, they are actually attacking symbols and concepts, whichresults in a great mass of hot air but nothing with a firm foundation inreality. In India yogis bypass words, seeking to be united with God through deepexperience, and once they have achieved divine union, religion no longer appliesto them. Being with God sets you free from all restrictions, including religionitself.In an Indian parable, a holy man chooses the reclusive life. He finds a remotemountain cave and lives there for years in continual meditation. Finally the daycomes when he reaches enlightenment. Overjoyed, the holy man rushes down themountain to tell the local villagers about his liberation. He reaches the townbazaar, which is packed, and begins to make his way through the teeming crowd.Bodies press against his, and an elbow jabs him in the ribs.“Get out of my way, you idiot,” the holy man grumbles. He pauses for a moment,then turns around and heads back up the mountain.Getting angry when a stranger bumps you in a crowd shows that you aren’tenlightened. More than that, the parable is about our need to identify with allkinds of things—emotions, desires, possessions, money, status, security, theapproval of others. As long as you have a personal stake in the world, you arenot one with God.In the East the process of becoming enlightened is made easier, if onlyslightly, because everyone is raised to know that God is One, the totality ofexistence. So putting him in a box has no meaning. The fact that God wasreflected in hundreds of individual gods to be worshipped doesn’t contradict thenotion of God as One. Children in India are taught that the image of Krishna orDevi or Shiva, along with the temples devoted to them, are merely a facade,behind which hides Brahman, the true name of God since Brahman denoteseverything in creation, plus every possibility that could emerge from the domainof infinite possibilities.It could be said, with some justice, that a society that knows God is One hasfailed if it builds so many temples with idols for worship. But I think the caseis more complicated. Brahman is also a label, no different from Jesus or theProphet Muhammad. It’s a fairly rudimentary label, since the root word forBrahman simply means “to swell or expand.”But Brahman makes the same impossible demand as God does in the West: that youthink about everything in existence. The history of religion consists ofshuffling God from one box to the next as faiths rise and fall. This wasconvenient for the world’s faiths but disastrous for knowing God. When theIndian seers who wrote the Upanishads declared that “the knower of Brahman isBrahman,” they understood that God stands apart from anything else we know. Theissue isn’t how to think about God but how to experience him directly.This may sound like using mysticism as an escape route for true believers whodon’t want to be contradicted by reason. “I can’t talk about it” isn’t astatement you can refute, much less “No one can talk about it.” The mystery ofGod is treated that way all too often. But other things in life can beunderstood only if you experience them, from the scent of a rose to the taste ofchocolate, to the luxurious touch of cut velvet, to music. These sensations haveno reality for someone who hasn’t experienced them. Music strengthens the caseeven further, because music changes people. Studies have shown that playingmusic to Alzheimer’s patients seems to reduce their symptoms in a way that nodrug can, and although drugs can affect depression, music therapy is promisingthere, too, as it is in certain cases of autism.Music bypasses the part of the cortex responsible for rational thought, butnaming the location where the brain processes music doesn’t tell us why it istherapeutic. Single tones can have a balancing effect, it appears, in somepsychological and physical conditions. The stress response can be lessened withsoothing music. Some of these findings match common sense—listening to soothingbackground music settles the jitters of flying for some travelers, and it is soubiquitous in department stores (presumably to put shoppers in a mood to buy)that we block it out. My point here is that many experiences can alter us simplythrough our having the experience. God would be the ultimate example.Besides being futile, some religious thinking causes harm. With seeminginevitability, different faiths, because they disagree, lead to us-versus-themthinking, and then it’s a short step to persecution. In our own mental box, “we”are good, devoted, beloved by God, forgiven of sin, and headed for a divinereward after death; “they” are misguided, set apart from God, ignorant, wicked,threatening, and headed for divine punishment after death.A gruesome fact of religious history in the West is that the first heretics tobe burned at the stake were thirteen Catholic clergy in Orléans, France, onDecember 28, 1022. It is speculated that burning was chosen because of astricture against the priesthood shedding blood. The charge of heresy wasundoubtedly trumped up; the hapless victims were pawns in a political strugglefor the throne of France. But as a trigger for violence, us-versus-them was offto a roaring start and only increased as deep divisions grew betweenChristianity and Islam (igniting the Crusades to save the Holy Land frominfidels), the pope versus secular kings, the Eastern Church in Constantinopleversus the Western Church in Rome, and even priests versus laypeople, which gavethe Inquisition the right to judge the private faith of everyday citizens.The ultimate us-versus-them thinking separates “me” from “God.” Once thisseparation arises, it brings with it all the problems of duality. It’sastonishing that people were ever persuaded to love a God who is set apart fromthem—usually we fear and distrust “the other.” But religion has built in a largedose of fear along with love, as anyone who has ever heard of mortal sin, hell,and damnation knows. I mention these well-worn facts because they lead to asurprising conclusion. If separation from God leads to fear, persecution, andevils done in the name of God, then the only escape is to heal separation. Onlya God who is inseparable from us can be real.What if God is reality? Only then would we be free from illusion. If you reduceGod to a mental construct, you are stepping into illusion and its many aspects.GOD AS ILLUSIONWHEN IS GOD NOT REAL?When he seems to come and go.When he judges and disapproves.When he makes demands.When he is fickle and changing.When he seems to have abandoned you.When he answers some prayers but not others.When there are two contending Gods at war.I apply the same standards to God that we ordinarily apply to reality. Realitydoesn’t come and go. It doesn’t abandon us. What changes is how we relate to it.Moods rise and fall; pessimism gives way to optimism. Whenever you say “I’mhaving a bad day,” you’re talking about a relationship. I know that reality isan abstract word, so imagine the air you breathe. The act of breathing is aconstant, and Earth’s atmosphere is a given. If it weren’t for problems like airpollution and global warming, we could leave breathing to the unconscious mind.Yet you can bring the act of breathing to your mind whenever you want. On abeautiful day you fill your lungs deeply, feeling nourished by the air youbreathe. Running a marathon, you regulate your breathing to keep the oxygensupply to your muscles constant. Feeling anxious, you gasp in short, raggedbreaths.But to claim that the air has changeable feelings about you, or that it ispunishing you one day and rewarding you the next, would be illusory. We are theones who change; air is constant. The same holds true for God, who has beenidentified mistakenly as a fickle, changeable, mysteriously unpredictablepresence. Such a belief is a symptom of separation; we have to bridge the gapand get closer to what God actually is.Everyone has an interest in being real. On that basis, we can bypass the debatebetween believers and nonbelievers. When Lord Krishna tells Arjuna that allroads lead to God, he’s making this very point. Reality leads everyone forward.In the interval between birth and death, we all come to grips with reality;therefore, consciously or not, we are coming to grips with God.But I must pause on a tragic note. Sometimes suffering is so incomprehensiblethat illusion comes as the only comfort. I say this under the shadow of thehorrifying school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, just before Christmas 2012.A disturbed gunman entered two classrooms with assault weapons, killing sixadults and twenty children, almost all six and seven years old. In the wake ofmass murder on this scale, pastors come forward, and one said, “This isn’t inGod’s plan.” I wondered how many people were comforted by the statement. Ifthere is a moment when a loving God grievously disappoints us, it must be withthe senseless death of innocents.Sometimes you look away and let illusion do what has to be done. God gets offthe hook for not saving the children. Insanity makes the killer less than human.Evil gets its day. Gradually the faithful return to their beliefs, while a fewmore doubters peel away from religion, and the atheists shake their heads overthe way people look to God for answers when he is the problem. I didn’t want tolet illusion take hold, so I wrote a private note to myself: “It’s our deepestinner intelligence that mirrors the wisdom of the universe. Ultimately allsuffering is the result of the fragmented mind, personal and collective.Violence is rooted in collective psychosis. The cure is transcendence to Godconsciousness. My challenge is to make this real. In the meantime, each of usmust find consolation any way we can.”If God is everywhere, like the air we breathe, why is he so hard to find?Because everything you say about him is open to contradiction. Once you singleout any quality, its opposite is just as true. Does God love us and bring goodthings into our lives? All religions say so. But then what about the bad things?If God causes them too, then he doesn’t stand for good. If he can’t stop them,then his goodness has severe limitations. So does our own goodness. Why notworship ourselves? (A college student on television commented on why she didn’tgo to church anymore. “I can’t believe in a God who would send me to hell fordoing something bad,” she said. “If I made my parents mad, they wouldn’t throwme in the fireplace.”)No matter how you dice it, every aspect of God winds up biting its own tail.Protector: If God is here to keep us safe, why are there natural disasters?Lawgiver: If God hands down the rules of moral conduct, why are we free to be asimmoral as we like?Peacemaker: If God brings inner peace, why does he permit war and violence?A God who is all things can’t be only good, loving, peaceable, and just. Whetherwe like it or not—and mostly we really hate it—we must make room for God’sparticipation in the bad, painful, and chaotic parts of life. Am I saying thatGod is good and bad, loving and unloving? No. Any quality you give to God is anillusion. When in doubt, an easy test is to substitute reality for God. Isreality loving or unloving? The question makes no sense. Reality isall-inclusive. It simply is. Once your mind begins to wrap itself around anall-inclusive God, one who simply is, you are truly escaping illusion.Everyone is used to relating. Two people get together, and they either click orthey don’t. Maybe there is intense infatuation. Love begins to blossom, but at acertain point there are problems. Each person in the relationship has an ego. Ilove you, but this is how I do things. If the relationship is going to survive,“I” and “we” have to come into balance. All kinds of issues must be worked out.The beauty of relating to God is that none of this applies.God doesn’t have an ego. He always likes what you like. He always wants what youwant.God doesn’t have a point of view. He accepts your way of seeing things.God isn’t selfish. He doesn’t want anything from you.God doesn’t reject. Whatever you are is fine with him.If this sounds like an ideal relationship, it is. Human beings have projectedtheir deepest yearnings and feelings onto God, only to be disappointed whentheir projection didn’t yield results. No amount of worship makes God love youbetter. If God were human, this fact would condemn him to being unloving. Inmost cases, if you are in a relationship and worship the other person, you willget love in return. The irony is that God, the possessor of infinite love, getslabeled as showing no love at all. The relationship never started in the firstplace—that was the problem, not a flaw in the deity.A MAP FOR THE JOURNEYThe key to reaching God is to undergo a shift in awareness. The shift isn’tminor or incidental—it’s total. Unless we transform our minds, God will remainout of reach. Fortunately, we have a map to guide us. It was drawn collectivelyby the world’s wisdom traditions, incorporating what religion has to say butrelying far more on what those who delved deep into their own consciousness havediscovered.Open up the map, and the main features of the path to God are clearly visible.They show us the existence of three worlds.THE THREE WORLDSThe material world. This is the world of duality. Good and evil, light and darkcontend here. Events unfold in a straight line. Each person is a tiny speck inthe vastness of nature. We journey through this world driven by desire. Godremains out of our reach because he is the one thing that we cannot see, touch,talk about, or conceive of. As long as we remain in duality, the ego-personalitydominates. Everything revolves around “I, me, and mine.”The subtle world. This is the transitional world. Good and evil are not rigidlyseparated; light and dark merge into shades of gray. Behind the mask ofmaterialism, we sense a presence. We move toward it using intuition and insight.Random events begin to reveal hidden patterns. We are driven through the subtleworld by a craving for meaning. Nature becomes a stage setting for the soul.Everything revolves around self-awareness and its expansion.The transcendent world. This is the source of reality itself. At the source,there is oneness, a state of unity. Nothing is divided or in conflict. The veilof materialism has fallen away completely. Good and evil, light and dark havemerged. We move through this world guided by our higher being, which isinseparable from God, who is the state of supreme being. The individual ego hasexpanded to become the cosmic ego. Everything revolves around pureconsciousness.God remains a muddle because these three worlds overlap, undivided by fixedwalls. At any moment, you might be living in any one of them or peering acrossthe frontier from one to the next. Awareness takes you where you want to go.Reality remains constant as you travel from one state of awareness to another.But as things stand now, when most of us are attached to the material world,awareness is the last thing we know much about. We are constantly confused aboutwhether other worlds even exist, and when someone steps forward to affirm thatthey do, they are likely to be greeted with skepticism and hostility.Faith can go only so far in promising that other worlds exist beyond the onedetected by the five senses. Once faith opens up the possibility, we must turnit into a living reality. First we need a clear sense of where we’re going. Forthe sake of bringing order out of disorder, the spiritual map indicates astarting point (the material world), a middle section (the subtle world), and adestination (the transcendent world). It’s not really that way, however. Beingfluid, awareness can go wherever it likes, whenever it likes.You venture into the subtle world all the time. Here are some typicalexperiences in that state of awareness:You follow a hunch.You become aware of another person’s actual motives or feelings.You see how you are affecting the people around you.You feel bonded to another by love.You stop feeling the need to judge.You are struck by beauty.You feel generous of heart.You want to give and be of service.You feel inspired and uplifted.To one degree or another, these are egoless experiences. “I, me, and mine” losetheir grip. You expand beyond selfish desires. You intuit that there is more toreality than what your five senses tell you.You travel into the transcendent world all the time as well, although modernsociety isn’t set up to acknowledge or approve of these excursions. Here aresome typical experiences when you touch the highest level of awareness.You feel light, unburdened, and unbounded.You see common humanity in every face.You feel completely safe.You enjoy being here for its own sake.A calm stillness appears inside you.Infinite possibilities seem to open up.You feel wonder and awe looking out at nature.You surrender, accept, and forgive.You are certain that everything matters; things happen for a reason.You feel that perfect freedom is the most natural way to live.You shift your reality by entering a new state of consciousness. The onlyboundaries are self-imposed, yet we impose them all the time. We remainstubbornly attached to a core of beliefs that stop our spiritual journey beforeit has even begun. I can imagine science taking hold with such conviction thatthe world’s wisdom traditions become totally marginalized. No one believes inthe subtle world, and the transcendent world is degraded to a delusion.Yet even on the verge of extinction, spirituality would be revived. Despite allthe disappointment in God and the reasonable doubts offered by skeptics—even theunreasonable ones promoted with a whiff of malice by the four horsemen—certainconstants remain the same from age to age. They urge everyone to change, and allmust be taken into account if you want to know God. These constants areDesire for a better lifeLoveThe force of evolutionExperiences of ecstasy and blissCuriosityThe growth of wisdomDissatisfactionDreamsVisionsInspirationPersonal experiences of God, higher reality, the higher selfThese are the drivers of spirituality, with or without religious labels. Theycame first, before anyone applied words like God or soul. A decree could abolishthose words but not the motivation behind them.The drivers of spirituality fight against the status quo. They make us intorestless creatures who yearn for change. How we respond to them is entirelyindividual. Indian lore is full of precocious seekers who left home to find Godwhen they were small children. Jesus was wise enough to confound the rabbis atthe Temple in Jerusalem at the age of twelve. But as in all things, the extremesare rare because they are so single-minded. At one extreme are seekers who livefor personal transformation and nothing else; the world’s saints, sages, andspiritual guides need almost no motivation. At the other extreme are theperpetually stuck, people who deny or hate any kind of change; the world’sideologues, fanatics, and psychologically fearful will never be motivated toopen up their minds.The rest of us find our spiritual way more haphazardly. Our path is a crookedone, affected by all kinds of distractions. We are confused and doubting. Innerconflicts cause us to get stuck. But the same forces that create saints arepresent in your life. What they wait upon is to be noticed. If you arereasonably attentive to what’s happening inside yourself, you are alreadyresponding to the forces listed above. You envision a better life for yourself.Growing as a person matters to you. You can see the outlines of a better futurefor yourself.These everyday motivations are enough. We can reach the most exalted spiritualgoal through them. You will hear no mystical voice inside your head, and no handwill reach down from heaven to grab you by the nape of the neck. The whole storyis told in a single concept: God is realized in the highest state of awareness.Since everyone is aware, God is reachable by all of us."},{"pageContent":"IS THERE A MATERIAL WORLD?I’ve described three worlds, each of which has its own spiritual purpose. Thematerial world doesn’t show any physical evidence of God’s presence that wouldconvince a skeptic. Atheists often make much of this fact, and their argumentsare reasonable, as far as they go. In a violent world, a loving God can’t bedefended. The existence of lawbreakers makes it unreasonable to say that God hasthe power to punish wrongdoing. The human rights violations of oppressivegovernments make an all-powerful God seem like a cruel joke—Stalin and Hitlerwelded absolute power without the slightest interference from the Almighty. Wecan concede all these things as they apply to the material world. God becomesreal only when you discover that the material world isn’t the end of the story.An Indian spiritual master once told a devotee, “The physical world is veryconvincing. It seems solid and reliable. How can you possibly escape it? Byseeing that this world is actually a product of your mind. Without thatrealization, the physical world wraps around you like a net. But all nets haveholes. Find one and jump through.” If you are a materialist, such statementsdrive you crazy; they seem totally bizarre when the world “out there” is soobviously real. I won’t repeat the arguments against accepting the world “outthere” as a given. Our concern now is to jump through the net.Escape is possible by seeing a simple but radical truth: All worlds are createdin consciousness, including the physical world. Find a way to free yourconsciousness, and nothing will ever be the same.On the subtler levels of reality, God possesses the love, goodness, and powerattributed to him. Our challenge is to connect these subtler levels to thematerial world. If we succeed, the picture changes. On the spiritual path, youdiscover that being human is multidimensional, and the subtler dimensionscontain great power. There will even be enough power to change events “outthere” in the material world.MIND OVER MATTERThe New Testament contradicts the rules of physical reality using a famousanalogy: “Because you have so little faith. I tell you the truth; if you havefaith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, ‘Move from hereto there’ and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you” (Matthew 17:20).Jesus’s words have sustained the faithful and aroused skeptical disdain almostequally.The basic claim he makes is that mind moves matter. In the human body this claimis undeniable. Thoughts and feelings create molecules in the brain thatcommunicate to the rest of the body. If you are intensely afraid, yourhormones—in this case, the stress hormones cortisol and adrenaline—send a verydifferent message from the one they send if you are in love. Moreover, to haveany thought, image, or sensation, the brain must operate through electricalsignals and chemical reactions that bridge the synapses, the gaps between braincells. These chemicals are in a constant state of flux, being created anddestroyed thousands of times per second to keep up with your shifting mentalstate.If we move outside the body, the situation seems very different, but Jesusexplicitly declares that a mental state—faith—can create a shift in the materialworld. How? The religious explanation is that God, because he favors therighteous, will intervene to alter physical reality for them. But too manymartyred saints have died in agony to trust that the righteous have much pull inthis department. What we want instead is a natural explanation, and for that,mind over matter must be reduced to a common denominator. Earlier I nominatedconsciousness as being common to all experience, inner and outer, listing theelements necessary to make anything real.IntelligenceIntentionAttentionA bridge from mind to matterAn observerA connection between events “in here” and events “out there”Jesus is talking about the last item on the list—for him, the bridge between “inhere” and “out there” is faith. God has created mind and matter together, and ifyou have enough faith, God gives you control over them together. In Jesus’sexample, something very tiny (a mustard seed) is juxtaposed with something huge(a mountain), but the exaggeration is simply for effect. Faith doesn’t have asize, big or small. It’s a state of mind; either you are in that state or youaren’t. The point is easy to miss, as believers often do. They interpret Jesusas giving faith such unimaginable power that even a tiny bit of it must benearly impossible to acquire—after all, who among us is moving mountains?Certainly the four Gospel writers are quite consistent about putting mind overmatter. Jesus tells the disciples that they will acquire remarkable powersthrough faith. “He that believeth in me, the works that I do shall he do also;and greater works than these shall he do” (John 14:12). In the Sermon on theMount, Jesus degrades the material world, putting the sacred world above it. Thesacred world follows different rules. That’s the whole point of the examples hechooses: The birds of the air are fed by Providence even though they do notstore up grain, and the lilies of the field are beautifully arrayed even though“they neither toil nor spin” (Matthew 6:28).The rules of the material world point to a different conclusion. Each of ustoils in our own way, and in our struggle to build a worthwhile life, we cannotrely on faith alone. Faith doesn’t pay the gas bill, much less move mountains.If you are devout enough, you cannot simply ignore this disappointing fact, andif you are a confirmed skeptic, you cannot simply ridicule it. But there is analternative approach, known as seeking. You can seek to build a livingconnection between mind and matter, between what happens “in here” and how thataffects events “out there.” The connection isn’t a given. If it were, prayerswould reach God automatically, like telephone calls. The seeker wants to findout why God responds to us some of the time—as countless believers attest overthe centuries—while ignoring us even in dire need most of the time.I’d suggest that the spiritual purpose of the material world is seeking. Mindmeets matter every day. Which is more powerful? The Book of John’s declaration“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God”(John 1:1) is a stark statement about mind coming first and the material worldsecond. For the Gospel writer, creation itself was an act of mind, the thinkingor utterance of a word. As a seeker, you try to get back to the creative sourcein yourself, not as a word but as a state of mind filled with untoldpossibilities. There’s nowhere else to go if you want to solve themind-over-matter problem.Wisdom traditions agree that the source of creation is inside us. In one of thegreat texts of Vedanta, the sage Vasishtha declares, “Dear ones, we have createdeach other in our fancy.” This claim, preposterous at first sight, becomesinescapable if God is reality. Then the logic is simple and ironclad, a logicthat sustains every spiritual tradition, East and West.If God is the creative source of everything,And if God is in us,The creative source of everything is in us.A seeker is searching for God, reality, and the true self all at once. To dothat, one must escape the net that traps us in the physical world. We mustredefine ourselves as multidimensional. Seeking begins in the physical world,however, because we are all entangled in it from birth. It’s a tricky businessto be in the world but not of it. Physicality is incredibly convincing. Is therereally a way to jump out of the net?When you have a dream, you are in the dream world—running around, flying, seeinganimals, people, and stranger creatures perhaps. But as soon as you wake up, yourealize that you are not of that world—that it’s not the reality you come from.To the enlightened, the same holds true of the events we experience when we’reawake, going to work, raising a family, and so on. We are in that world, butit’s possible to wake up and realize that we are not of it. To the Vedic seers,the material world is as much a dream as the dreams we have when we’re asleep inbed. In a famous verse, Vasishtha contemplates a spiritual version of whatmodern physics calls the multiverse, where countless universes exist in theirown dimensions:In the infinite consciousness, universes come and go like particles of dust in abeam of sunlight that shines through a hole in the roof.This is a spiritual version of the multiverse, as becomes clear in anotherverse: “Whatever the mind thinks of, that alone it sees.” All roads lead to Godonly if all roads lead to consciousness first.Dawkins and company don’t concede the existence of any level of reality beyondthe material world. It’s easy to sympathize with their position, even if theystate it with such open hostility. Seeking, as an inward project, is unknown tothem, as it is to many people. Religious history is a centuries-old record ofseekers going in different directions, encountering every possible pitfall alongthe way. So if we are to do better, we need to be very clear about where oursearch is going.WHAT IS SEEKING?Seeking isn’t a fixed activity with a single goal—it has shifted over time. Inthe medieval era, seekers wanted to get a reward in heaven, and although wecannot know if they found it, every aspect of social life, from wandering friarsto great cathedrals, was focused on it. The vast majority of people who werealive in the Middle Ages, a huge span of eight hundred years (from 400 to 1200CE), had no hope of acquiring power or money. They could love one another, butthey lived in a “vale of tears” where everyday existence was a struggle tosurvive. The best they could hope for was to find refuge in monasteries andconvents. Large masses of people took that path. But in a way, by seeking refugefrom a cruel world, they turned their backs on faith. To judge by the results,The Age of Faith, as a rubric for the centuries dominated by Christianity, is amisnomer. If Jesus is telling the truth, faith is what makes it possible tocreate an ideal world where every desire is fulfilled: “Ask and it will be givento you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you”(Matthew 7:7). If you seek, the sign of success is that desires come true. Youhave proven that mind is the ultimate power. Whatever a Christian was meant todo to turn this promise into reality—have faith, align with God’s will, or bewithout sin—nothing was enough for the wretched mass of medieval believers.When the world was a harsher place, seeking led directly to renouncing theworld. Because we have easier lives today, we have much less reason to renouncethe world, but a lingering belief that the world is a vale of tears makes manypeople feel that religion is opposed to fulfilling one’s desires. If there areapproved Christian teachings in favor of desire, few believers know about them.In fact, modern believers are not versed in religious teachings much at all—a2012 Pew Research poll posed thirty-two basic questions about religion, and thepeople who got the most right were the atheists, with an average of 20.9. (PeterGomes, who preached to a liberal congregation at Harvard College, asked a groupof them what the epistles in the New Testament were. A shy hand went up: “Arethey the wives of the apostles?”)Today, seeking has become almost entirely private; there is no consensus aboutthe goal. It takes courage to step away from the religion you were brought upin. The Protestant theologian Paul Tillich wrote a best seller in 1952, TheCourage to Be, which is steeped in the angst of the atomic age. The Holocaustand the terrors of two world wars had scraped belief in God down to the last fewchips of paint. There was a widespread acceptance that life must be meaningless.Tillich saw the situation and asked, “Why are we here in the first place?” Life,he said, poses that question automatically. If being alive makes you ask why youare here, you automatically want to find an answer. The two activities—askingthe most basic existential questions and answering them—form a circle. Questionslead to answers, for no other reason than that you are alive.I don’t think society has gotten much beyond the situation Tillich describes.God has been worn down to a nub, and terrorism is an everyday threat, even asthe threat of mass nuclear destruction has begun to wane. The seeker doesn’thave a platform of belief to stand upon. Finding the courage to be means findingthe heart to go beyond meaningless existence.This isn’t pretend or make-believe courage. In many ways seeking is harder thanhaving faith. Having faith is passive; it doesn’t demand constantself-examination the way seeking does. Believers are nervous that if they losetheir faith, they will be left with aching doubt and uncertainty. So they mustfend off doubt. Seeking, on the other hand, begins with doubt as a foundationfor finding out the truth. It welcomes uncertainty as better than inflexible,dogmatic certainty. Seekers are courageous enough to be different, to renouncethe comfort of a community inside church walls. They are open to consideringspiritual ideas from other traditions beside Judeo-Christianity. For all thesereasons, a modern secular society, far from being the enemy of spirituality,offers fertile ground for it.Whenever someone tells me that they have found God, I’m tempted to ask what helooked like. If they gave me a definite answer, I’d have to tell them to keeplooking. This is what Buddhists mean when they declare, “If you meet the Buddhaon the path, kill him.” A preconception never works—it will only lead you to runinto the thing you’ve already imagined. God—or the Buddha—will remainunimaginable. But I don’t say this to seekers, because it sounds defeatist. Ijust point out that the issues surrounding God are secondary. You have to knowreality before you can know God.If I had to name one motivator that turns someone into a seeker, it would bethis: People want to be real. The will to believe, which in earlier centurieswas focused on God, has morphed into a yearning for a real life, one that holdstogether, that is rich in meaning and purpose, that brings fulfillment. TheHolocaust and every other mass horror created a terrible sense of unreality.Feeling unmoored has become so pervasive that we rattle along workingfrenetically and getting distracted even more frenetically, unaware that anyother reality exists.But at the beginning, when modern life first became frightening in itsunreality, only a few witnesses were brave enough to face it. Primo Levi was anItalian Jew who was transported to Auschwitz and survived. In the late 1940s,just a few years after the Russian army captured the camp and freed theprisoners, Levi wrote movingly about how it felt to come back home to his nativeTurin, where everyone wanted to forget the Nazis and return to normal joys anddesires. At first Levi found himself talking incessantly about Auschwitz—hestopped strangers on the street and passengers on trains, unable to keep silent.This did him some good; at least he was reconnecting to other people. But he nolonger felt real, the way they seemed to feel. He felt set apart, isolated, awandering ghost. His struggle to feel real again sometimes went to extremes. Afriend recounted a disturbing incident when Levi came across a wild persimmonbush and attacked it maniacally, clawing at it and chewing on the fruit.Although trained as a chemist, Levi felt driven to put his Auschwitz experienceinto words. The result was a classic survivor’s memoir, If This Is a Man.“Probably, if I had not written my book,” he told his biographer, “I’d haveremained one of the damned of the earth.” Levi took the courage to be to ananguished extreme. But I’m grateful that he—and others who have struggled toreturn from severe depression, heartbreaking trauma, and even madness—has shownus that being real can be such a powerful drive. Translated into normal life,seeking has some crucial ingredients that bind all of us together.WHAT MAKES A SEEKER?The desire to be realThe courage to step into the unknownA refusal to be fooled by illusionsThe need to feel fulfilledThe ability to go beyond material satisfactionsAn intimation of other levels of existenceYou are a seeker if these ingredients exist inside you. They may only be seeds;nonetheless you feel a stirring within you, some sort of desire percolatinginside. For religious people, the word desire can be worrisome. Doesn’t God wantus to renounce desire? If, as we are told, sex, money, and power are pitfalls onthe way to heaven, the enticement of desire is contrary to God. Yet Freud calledsex, power, and the love of women the primary goods in life. (He was speaking toa male world.) Human nature was designed to pursue these things. If that’strue—and millions of people live their lives as if it is—how can seeking offersomething better?In this regard, seekers present a misleading public face. On the one hand, theproject becomes something religious, a kind of hunt for the unicorn, except thatthe mythical beast is God. On the other hand, New Age spirituality has becomesynonymous with crystals, angels, channeling spirits, and communicating with thedead. It’s easy to mock such things; they get thrown onto the pile of evidencethat atheists have amassed about the irrationality of religion. The deeper issueis our yearning for reality and what is to be done with it.MAKING IT WORKNow it’s time to get real. The material world is chaotic, filled with eventsbeyond anyone’s personal control. To be a seeker, you are required not toconquer the chaos but to see through it. The Vedic tradition uses a clevermetaphor for this: A seeker walks through a herd of sleeping elephants withoutwaking them up. The elephants are your old conditioning, which insists that youare weak, isolated, and abandoned. You can’t fight this conditioning, becauseonce you wake it up, your fear, insecurity, and certainty that you must struggleto survive will have tremendous power. Once the elephants wake up, they’lltrample you.So the world’s wisdom traditions figured out another way. Sneak past theseobstacles, without trying to fight them head on. Shift your allegiance, silentlyand inwardly. Stop being ruled by the chaos and start being ruled by your coreself. Let me map out what the process entails.In practical terms, the process follows this precept: “Strip away yourillusions, and what is left must be real.” The material world rests uponillusion, as quantum physics has proved. Yet the mythology of materialismpersists. How does it affect you personally? Consider the rules that governmaterial life, such as struggle, self-defense, competition, class divisions, andthe attempt to control nature. The assumptions that underlie these rules arehard to challenge. They are rigid and, for most people, a given. Let me spellout a few, as they pertain to various levels of our existence.Scientific level: The rigid assumption here is that human beings are smallspecks in the vast, cold cosmos. All uses come down to matter and energy,including the mind itself, which is a by-product of how molecules behave in thebrain. The laws of nature are fixed and immutable. Whatever happens inside themind has no effect on reality “out there,” which is devoid of consciousness.Social level: The main assumption here, which drives endless consumerism, isthat acquiring material things leads to happiness. More is better. Money is themost valuable commodity in life. You solve problems by climbing the ladder ofsuccess and wealth.Spiritual level: The main assumption here is that spirituality is a matter ofhard work, like everything else. You climb the ladder to God by striving. Youget demoted when you become lax. Every faith sets down dogmatic rules forarriving at success. Those who obey the rules earn their way to heaven. Thiswhole scheme has rightly been dubbed spiritual materialism. That is, the soul isput to work just as the body is in the material world.These aren’t passive influences. They have trapped us into the danger thatVasishtha warned against: The mind sees only what it has created. The inabilityto discover inner power can be traced directly to the “mind-forged manacles”that William Blake lamented. Although I’m arguing that materialism isn’treality, I’m not saying that a deliberate lie is at work. Arch-materialists,including Dawkins and company, are describing what they see. Their fatal erroris to miss that the mind makes every version of reality, using its invisiblecreative power.To become a seeker, you don’t have to walk away and exist as an outsider fromsociety; you aren’t required to turn your back on those who love you or toproselytize a set of new beliefs. Those are the customary trappings of religiousconversion. Because religion has monopolized that field, it seems wise to take acompletely different tack. I’d suggest a simple version of “the courage to be.”Reexamine your present situation. Sit down with a sheet of paper and confrontwhat your existence is about.Here’s a simple format. In one column list the external things you put effortinto, for example:FamilyFriendsCareerSchool, higher educationStatusWealthProperty and possessionsPoliticsHobbiesExerciseGoing to the moviesSexInternet and social mediaVideo gamesTelevisionTravelChurch attendanceService organizationsCharityBeside each category, put down a number. It could be the number of hours a weekyou devote to this activity; it could be how much you value the activity, on ascale from one to ten.In another column, make a list of the inner activities that you put effort into,such asMeditationContemplationPrayerSelf-reflectionStress managementReading spiritual material, including poems and inspirational literaturePsychotherapyPersonal growthIntimacyBonding with someone else empathically, or out of compassionAppreciation and gratitude, toward yourself and othersExploring the world’s wisdom traditionsTaking a period of silenceGoing on a spiritual retreatRate these things, too, with a number, reflecting the value you put on each oneor how much time you devote to it.When you have finished, compare the two lists. They will give you a rough senseof where your allegiance lies between the inner and outer. I’m not suggestingyou play a spiritual blame game—almost everyone predominantly pursues outwardactivities. The material world holds us fast. It’s quite all right for inwardactivities to take place in the material world; they can be part of one dailyroutine. (Jesus pointed to the need for peaceful coexistence when he spoke ofrendering unto Caesar what is Caesar’s and unto God what is God’s.)Unless you devote time and attention to inward things, you are not seeking.Being pious and doing good works are not a substitute. They remain all too oftenon the external plane. For someone who needs a set of spiritual goals, I’d beginwith two that have nothing to do with religion and everything to do with gettingreal: find your center, and then run your life from there. Both goals arenecessary. If you leave out one, the other will have limited use.Finding your center means settling into a stable, coherent state of awareness.Outer forces do not dominate you. You’re not restless, anxious, worried, orunfocused. You are finding your center whenever youAct with integritySpeak your truthRemain unswayed by the need to be likedStop people-pleasing and placatingDo not fear authorityProtect your personal dignity and respect the dignity of othersDon’t keep secrets from yourself and those closest to youHonor confidencesRemain self-reliant, not dependent on othersDo not blind yourself with denial and self-deceptionsRefuse to turn against others for ideological reasonsPractice toleranceBecome slow to anger and quick to forgiveAim to understand others as you understand yourselfThe second goal, running your life from your center, means obeying subtle innerguidance, such as instinct, intuition, love, self-knowledge, trust, andcompassion. It also helps to know what not to do. You aren’t living from yourcenter whenever youFocus on external rewards (e.g., money, status, possessions)Crave approval from othersGo along to get alongEndorse social conformityOpen yourself too easily to outside influencesUphold rigid moral guidelinesPut too much emphasis on rulesSet yourself up as an authorityCompete as if winning is the only thing that mattersDemonize your rivals and competitorsGossip and belittle othersHold on to prejudice or ideologySeek revengeSkirt the truthPractice us-versus-them thinkingKeep your inner world a secretOnce you achieve the two goals, your material world will hold together in thesame way that you hold together. Inner and outer will no longer be two separatedomains; you’ve made them connect. You can operate from a core of integrity andexpress your true self. That’s how a person learns to overcome the materialworld’s chaos and fragmentation.This project of seeking that I’ve outlined is existential, to put it in a word.The courage to be has traced a path, not to the God of faith but to a solidsense of what it means to be real.When you begin to suspect that you are the author of your own existence, seekinghas begun.When you start to use your awareness to actively shape your life, seeking hasbrought an answer.When you look around and know that reality is based entirely on consciousness,seeking has reached its goal.The next stage is to journey deeper, always moving toward the source ofcreation, which is where the real power lies. Seeking takes place in thematerial world, but finding happens somewhere else."},{"pageContent":"THE SUBTLE WORLDIf you go into any bookstore—some of them are still around—and throw a rock, ithas a good chance of hitting a book about science and religion. The vastmajority of these books call for a truce between two camps that havetraditionally struggled against each other. In July 2005, science had no choicebut to shake hands with its old nemesis: The prestigious journal Sciencecelebrated its 125th anniversary by citing 125 open questions that science hadyet to answer. The top two were these:What is the universe made of?What is the biological basis of consciousness?After so many years of tremendous scientific achievement, it’s shocking that noone even has come close to answering these questions—in fact, the latestinvestigations only deepen the riddle. As we saw, just 0.01 percent of thecosmos is filled with atoms forming all the visible stars and galaxies. Roughly4 percent of the cosmos gathers in the remaining invisible atoms, asinterstellar dust and free-floating hydrogen and helium atoms. The remaining 96percent of “stuff” appears to be nonatomic, and it disobeys basic rules aboutgravity and the speed of light. So it isn’t stuff at all, not by any measure ofthe visible world. To say that physics explains space and time is like sayingthat someone with 4 percent eyesight sees the whole landscape.As for the biology of consciousness, no one has shown that consciousness evenhas a biology. Brain imaging, although a huge advance in looking beneath theskull, reveals where blood is flowing. That isn’t remotely the same as showinghow a chemical soup—a mélange of water, blood sugar, DNA, and potassium andsodium ions—learned to think. It is just as likely that a thinking universedecided to create the brain.If you can’t answer the preceding questions, which are like the ABC of reality,your theory of where human beings came from is, to say the least, questionable.As a scientist, you have no choice but to keep insisting that the answer will befound one day, probably soon. (This was Science’s position. The editors basedtheir list on a survey of one hundred leading scientists, asking them to focuson questions that might be answered within twenty-five years.) It’s rather latein the day to ask for more time when what you are after isn’t a grand goal (likethe long-awaited Theory of Everything) but only a credible starting point. Godis all about starting points. A matchup between spirituality and science isinevitable. Both of them peer into a level of reality across the border from thevisible world. Both confront the wonder of nature and the strangest of allphenomena, as Einstein saw it: that nature can be understood in the first place.I’m calling the invisible domain the subtle world. We’ve arrived there by thepath of faith. Science gets there by using a chain of steps that peel awayreality like an onion or a Russian doll, with smaller and smaller matryoshkasnested inside each other. But the subtle world isn’t exclusive territory foreither side. If it’s real, it’s real. Science may disdain the path of faith, butthat only shows its disdain for the very consciousness that links all mentalactivity, whether it is prayer or bombarding protons to release Higgs particles.The onion layers as peeled back by science are straightforward propositions thatall scientists agree upon:Is life reducible to biology? Yes.Is biology reducible to chemistry? Yes.Is chemistry reducible to physics? Yes.Is physics reducible to mathematics? Yes.Is mathematics an activity in consciousness? Yes.In public forums and private conversations, I’ve presented a number of prominentscientists with this sequence, and they show no hesitation all the way to theend (only a slight suspicion, perhaps, about walking into a possible trap). Thesquirming begins when I say, “It looks like life is reducible to consciousness,right? We’ve used your own methods to get there.” Generally they meet thisconclusion with a shrug of the shoulders. One neurologist conceded that this wasthe hardest chain of questions he had ever confronted. A cosmologist accused meof reductionism. But I hadn’t laid a trap. Consciousness pops up as the basis ofcreation, whether you start from God or from the test tube. In one case, matterdisappears into mind; in the other case, mind emerges as matter. The subtleworld is their common denominator.Faith is supported by logic, but it’s hard to convince someone if your logicisn’t theirs. Dawkins has alienated even those who share his atheism because hearrogantly supposes that he took out the patent on rationality. No logic worksbut his. Even so, until very recently, forcing science and religion into ashotgun wedding satisfied no one. Dawkins and company reflect a social rift asmuch as anything else—if you “do science,” you aren’t likely to keepprofessional company with those who “do religion.” The two courses of studydon’t overlap at university; the two kinds of work don’t share the samebuilding.Yet the tools for making God real are the ones that construct the real world.They can be stated in a small handful of principles. No one needs to take out apatent on them. If they pertain to reality itself, they should be acceptable toboth believers and skeptics.Principle 1—You are not a passive receiver taking in a fixed, given reality. Youare processing your experience at every second.Principle 2—The reality you perceive comes from the experience you areprocessing.Principle 3—The more self-aware you are, the more power you will have as areality-maker.None of these principles will come as a surprise. Consciousness and creator havebeen important words in my argument all along, but you must test each principle;you have no other way to reclaim your role as a creator. If you don’t test them,you have passively accepted the skeptics’ position, which maintains thatconsciousness is totally unreliable because it is subjective. “I like lollipops”can’t be equated with “The sky is blue.” One is a fickle personal experience;the other is a scientific fact. But as we’ve seen, the distinction is baseless.It takes consciousness to make the sky blue. It takes consciousness to think inthe first place. Skeptics warn us not to trust the events that happen “only inyour mind,” when the truth is that the entire world happens only in your mind.INVISIBLE SIGNALSThe real question is “How far can you trust?” Can you trust your mind when ittakes you across the border from the visible world? That’s the crux of it.Consider what it means to surrender to God. This has always been portrayed as anact of faith, which means—if we are brutally frank—that most reasonable peoplewill reject it out of hand. Surrendering means trusting in an invisible forcebeyond the five senses. Obviously you wouldn’t let God drive your car. Noinvisible force is going to cook dinner tonight. The material world worksaccording to its own rules. If you stop there, surrender isn’t reallynecessary—you can trust the material world in an everyday way. No one has eversurrendered to God except by mistrusting the material world and following hintsthat lead in another direction. These hints are like peeks behind the smoke andmirrors of a magic act. They show you how the tricks are done.Since the subtle world touches all of us, hints about it cross your path everyday. Reflect on how many of the following things have happened to you. The listis long, but it’s important to realize that you are already connected to adeeper level of consciousness, if only through momentary glimpses.HINTS FROM THE SUBTLE WORLDCONNECTING TO DEEPER CONSCIOUSNESSYou have an “aha” or “eureka” moment.You feel a burst of heightened reality, as if things suddenly became clear toyou.You are struck by awe and wonder.You are visited by a sudden sense of pervasive peace and calm.Inspiration comes to you. You have a leap of creativity.Events seem to form a pattern, and suddenly you see what the pattern is.Unexpectedly, you feel loved, not by a specific person but simply loved.You think of a person’s name, and the next minute that person telephones you.A random word comes to mind, and you then run across it in your reading orconversation immediately afterward.You foresee an event, and it comes true.You have a particular desire, and it gets fulfilled as if on its own.You run into meaningful coincidences, when two events coincide and mesh.For a whole day, things seem to organize themselves, falling into place withouteffort.You feel the presence of someone who has passed away.You see another person’s aura, either as visible light or as a subtle sensationof light.You detect charisma, a strong personal force, from someone else.You feel that someone else radiates pure love or a holy presence.You sense that you are guided.You are certain that your life has a purpose, which may feel predestined orbeyond what your ego wants.It takes only a speck of self-awareness to notice such hints. They presentflashes of mystery. Something is asking to be noticed. Now ask yourself a keyquestion. How many of these hints did you trust? Did they make a difference inyour outlook or your everyday response to life? The amount of trust people placein them varies enormously. One “eureka” moment can change an entire life, butthat is rare. What is far more common is to receive a hint about the subtleworld, only to let it pass as you return to living the way you normally do.The arena of subtle perception is fragile at first. This is the main reasondoubt arises about the power of consciousness. We take awareness for granted,and when events jump out of their usual groove, we don’t know how to respond. Afriend told me about visiting an Indian holy man—in this case, a woman,actually, born in poor circumstances who grew up to be surrounded by devotees.My friend was quite reluctant to go. “I was asked by a follower of the holywoman, and I’ve always been embarrassed to tell him that his beliefs lowered himin my eyes. The notion of surrendering to someone else appalled me. Why on earthwould a person give up their freedom that way?”My friend arrived to find the holy woman sitting in a large tent; it was crammedwith people and redolent of sandalwood incense. She sat on a low dais, a smallfigure dressed in a sari, to all appearances indistinguishable from anyone else.My friend had a surprising reaction. “I expected to shut down, seeing hundredsof people focused on this unknown person, most of them bowing down as theyapproached her. She smiled at each and gave them a light embrace. It was astrange sight, the very picture of what I disliked about the whole guru science,but for some reason I felt quite relaxed and comfortable.”Shy to approach the holy woman, my friend sat in the back of the tent. But shehad heard about darshan, the traditional Indian practice of receiving a blessingin the presence of a holy person. An impulse told her to go forward and receivedarshan, so she gradually made her way toward the front.“I have no explanation for what happened,” she later told me. “People werejostling me on either side, but I kept inching ahead. As I did, my mind becamequiet. The crowd didn’t make me feel agitated or impatient. A little closer, andthis inner quiet became very peaceful. Closer still, and I sensed a sweetnessinside, the way you’d feel around a happy infant—only this sweetness wentdeeper.“Finally I was next in line. The holy woman smiled at me and lightly put herarms around me. She uttered a few words in my ear that I didn’t understand—laterI was told that this was her blessing.“What if I had been given a photograph of that moment? It would show a tallwhite Western woman stooping over to be hugged by a little brown Eastern woman.Yet the experience was indescribable. I felt an intensity in her presence thatonly the word ‘holy’ can describe. At the same time, it was like meeting myself.The little brown woman wasn’t even there. She was—what?—the symbol, the carrier,the messenger of a divine encounter.”A powerful hint indeed. Afterward my friend found herself puzzled and deeplytouched at the same time. She’s still working out what happened. I’m using theword hint because plunging directly into the subtle world would be sooverwhelming that our minds shut out the possibility. We permit ourselves onlyhints and glimpses. The world would be a strange place if every other personwere blinded by the light, like Saul on the road to Damascus. We’ve conditionedourselves to see through a glass darkly. When his traumatic conversion turnedSaul into Paul, he used the metaphor of seeing through a glass darkly becausehis perception had changed forever. The subtle world became his home, comparedto which the normal world was a place of dingy shadows.The hints won’t stop coming unless you persistently block them out, which somepeople do. The subtle world awaits the moment when these scattered signals beginto matter. Then a shift occurs. Your consciousness starts to free itself up. Adramatic example of this would be the long-term response of people who have hadnear-death experiences. Most report that they no longer fear death and dying,while some go further and report a loss of anxiety altogether. You and I don’tgo around feeling a constant fear of death, because it is embedded in the psycheat a subtle level. This is also the level where release comes. Whether onebelieves in near-death experiences or not, release of fear takes place, whichindicates that the subtle world has been contacted, and the contact led to apractical result.Once the subtle world starts to matter to you, it will allow you to overcomemore than hidden anxiety. It is the realm of light, where light means “clearperception, a state of transparency.” Consciousness is meant to be free. Youhave only to provide an opportunity and encourage every step of expandedawareness. How is that done?You remain open-minded.You don’t listen to the voice of fear.You don’t allow yourself to escape into denial.You take a holistic point of view.You question the narrow boundaries of ego.You identify with your highest impulses.You are optimistic about the future.You search for the hidden meaning in everyday events.These are what I call subtle actions. You don’t take them on the material level.The hints left by the subtle world require a subtle response.SUBTLE ACTIONAll of us are used to subtle action, although we don’t use that name for it. Allsubtle actions are choices. Imagine that you have left on a vacation, and on theway to the airport a nagging thought comes to you: Did I lock the front door?perhaps, or Did I leave the oven on? At that moment, you are confrontingyourself, and a choice arises. Do you return home and double-check, or do youtrust that nothing is wrong? The first is action in the material world, whilethe second is subtle action. You may not see a difference, but consider this. Inthe material world, we worry, double-check, fret, and so on out of a sense ofinsecurity. But intuition, which is subtle, doesn’t fret or worry. When youdecide to trust your feelings, you are making your choice on the subtle level.(Simply stating the difference doesn’t mean that you can ignore every worry. Youneed to follow a process before trust becomes real.)Subtle actions pervade life. If you trust that your partner loves you, that’s asubtle action. A less secure person asks for reassurance, such as ending everyphone call with “Love you” in order to hear “Love you, too” in return. Onlywords and deeds can assuage their insecurity, but they can’t trust their owninner world. Inner trust and mistrust can affect the course of a lifetime. Achild who has been well loved by his parents will almost always go through lifefeeling secure about his lovability. At the subtle level, lovability is asettled matter. But if a child grows up doubting that she is lovable, she willexperience nagging doubt at the subtle level. What happens then? She will spendyears trying to calm a sense of restlessness, dissatisfaction, and insecurity,and a fear of never being good enough.The basic needs that religious people direct to God are also subtle. Lord, makeme feel worthy. Lord, make me feel loved. Lord, make me feel blessed. If youdirect these appeals outward, you cannot trust that God will reply. You’re likea telegraph operator at an isolated station tapping out a message with nosecurity that the lines aren’t broken. Only after you experience the state knownas “God within” do you trust the connection. God is disconnected in the materialworld but has a presence in the subtle world. This isn’t the end of the journey,but through subtle action, followed by a real response, the divine starts tomatter. To lose fear or to feel blessed isn’t a mystical response. You think andbehave differently from someone who hasn’t undergone a subtle change.An Indian parable comes to mind as an illustration. Once there was a monktraveling by himself and teaching the dharma, the right way to live spiritually.As he made his way through the forest, he came upon a large clearing and satdown to rest.Just as he opened his sack to take out some food, a thief happened to pass by.He saw that the sack contained an enormous diamond. When the monk finished hismeal and set out on his way again, the thief ran ahead and hid in the bushes.Soon the monk approached, and the thief leaped out. The monk calmly asked himwhat he wanted.“The diamond in your bag,” the thief replied.“You followed me all this way just for that?” the monk asked. He took thediamond from his bag and held it out. “All right, take it,” he said.The thief greedily snatched the diamond and hurried away. He hadn’t gone farwhen he looked back to make sure the monk wasn’t coming after him. What he sawstunned him. The monk was sitting cross-legged under the stars, meditatingpeacefully with a look of complete bliss on his face.The thief went running back to him. “Please,” he begged, “take your diamondback. I only want to learn how you could lose it with so much peace.”The story is about the difference between human nature that hasn’t beentransformed and human nature that has. Subtle actions matter deeply; theyprovide direction to our whole existence. At every moment of the day we arearriving at hidden crossroads and making choices that lead one way or the other.To trust or mistrustTo surrender or controlTo let be or interfereTo pay attention or ignoreTo love or fearTo engage or escapeWe can distinguish subtle actions that have positive results from those thatdon’t. But they shouldn’t be taken as directions in an instruction manual. Thereis no approved set of choices that are always right while the others are alwayswrong. Love is the greatest good in life, but sometimes you have reason to fear.Not interfering is often wise counsel, but sometimes you must intervene. Thesecret to making the right choice is to be comfortable in the subtle world. Whenit is your home, you see clearly the right choice to make. The situation speaksto you. The gap between the question and the answer gets ever smaller. Whenthese things start to be familiar, you have learned to trust your instincts andoperate through intuition.Instinct and intuition are genuine skills. Most of us merely make stabs in thedark because we have spent so little time developing these skills. Our innerworld is confused and conflicted. Great artists are beautiful examples ofskilled intuition. Imagine standing next to Rembrandt as he paints. His palettecontains the same jumble of colors as that of any other painters of the day. Thesubject before him is perhaps a rich Amsterdam lady wrapped in a stiff whitelace collar and gold jewelry. (Rembrandt’s subjects were often eager to weartheir wealth on their backs.) Rembrandt’s hand dabs at his paints, then at hiseasel. These are the ordinary actions of any professional portrait painter.Yet after a few sittings, a transformation has taken place. Instead of aportrait, a living human being has emerged on canvas. With his subtle skill,Rembrandt has intuited what this lady’s character is. She displays a hiddenrange of qualities (vanity, melancholy, sweetness, naïveté) that shine throughthe pigments. These inner qualities can’t be translated into mechanicaltechnique. They require a direct connection between the subtle world and thepainter’s hand, which is why we stand in awestruck admiration and say, “He hascaptured her soul.”Not just geniuses but anyone can develop subtle skills. New mothers do it allthe time when they learn to read the signals given off by an infant. (In tribalAfrica, mothers carry their naked babies around on their backs. The mother knowsimmediately when to take her baby and hold it out to urinate or move its bowels.There is an instinctive bond, and no accidents.) The issue isn’t whether youhave subtle skills—I’m sure you have many. But experiencing God isn’t a singleskill. God is everywhere in the subtle world. The divine doesn’t appear byglimpses, in peak moments with sudden blinding light. The divine is constant; itis we who come and go.Until the subtle world becomes your home, you can’t help but come and go.Repetition and practice are part of the learning curve. The trick is to knowthat you are in the subtle world to begin with. The level of the solution isdeeper than the level of the problem. Staying at the level of the problemtherefore leads to frustration.You’ve probably met people who are constantly aiming for self-improvement, whosay things like “I’m learning to be less angry,” “I’m learning how to trustmore,” or “I’m learning how to be less controlling.” Somehow this learning neverends. Despite all their struggles, they are stuck with anger, mistrust, andcontrol issues. (People who take anger management courses, for example,sometimes wind up angrier afterward. Likewise, the benefits of grief counselingare suspect and highly unpredictable.) Why does this happen? There is nocut-and-dried answer, but a range of possibilities comes into play.The person didn’t reach the subtle level but struggled at the level of ego,self-doubt, and blame.They lost heart when they met with inner resistance.They lost motivation after one too many setbacks.Their approach was confused and filled with contradictions.They didn’t take real responsibility for their behavior.They were lacking in self-awareness.To put it simply, most people approach the subtle world haphazardly, rather like“cheasters,” casual Christians who attend church only at Christmas and Easter.Our failure to find God can be traced back to our habit of coming and goingrather than making a home in the subtle world. Just so, our failure to play thepiano well can be traced back to the moment we dropped piano lessons; ourfailure to perfect your golf swing, or to be creative, resulted from lack ofpractice. As banal as it sounds, finding God depends on regular practice.I’m not here to catalog the failures of seekers who never find what they aresearching for. It’s far more important to arrive at a trustworthy path to thegoal. The subtle world may lie in the unknown, but it is always open.LEADING YOUR BRAINThe most trustworthy path is to take a mind-body approach. In any state ofawareness, the brain processes experience; a mundane experience like walking thedog is on the same plane as an exalted experience like hearing angels sing. Thebrain must be adapted to process both. As a child, you went through veryspecialized adaptations in your brain to learn how to read. Your eyes had to beguided to focus on small black specks on a piece of paper; they had to move inlinear fashion from left to right and then down to the next line. Your cortexhad to decode the black specks into letters. Your memory committed itself tobuilding up a vast library of words and ideas. Becoming literate was like movingto a new world.Your shift away from materialism will be far more radical, because you give upall attachment to the physical universe as your fixed reference point. Animpulse of love will gain more power than a thunderstorm. The sight of a rose inyour mind’s eye will have the same status as a rose held in your hand; both areproducts of consciousness. Just as it adapted when you learned to read, yourbrain can adapt to experiencing God. When you commit to a strategy of shapinghow your brain processes perceptions, your spiritual vision will becomepractical. In fact, this serves as the litmus test—if your brain hasn’t beenretrained, you will not discover anything real in your spiritual search. Youwill still be in the net, waiting to find a hole to jump through.The brain cannot reshape itself; it functions as a mechanism for processing whatthe mind wants, fears, believes, and dreams about. By becoming more conscious,you automatically begin to lead your brain where you want it to go. In the Ageof Faith, every person was conditioned to process daily life in terms of God.There were sermons in the stones; a fallen tree was a telegram from theAlmighty. Today the opposite is true. The stones are dumb; a fallen tree is arandom event. The human brain has learned to adapt to any reality. That’s agreat gift, because it means you can lead your brain into the subtle world,which becomes real as your brain adjusts to a new landscape.Your brain, despite its marvels, requires basic training when you learn any newskill, and finding God is a skill. New neural pathways must be formed, whichwill happen automatically once you put focus, attention, and intention behindit.Below are seven strategies for processing the subtle world, one for each day ofthe week. Each day focuses on a different exercise to make you feel comfortablewith your inner world. Be easy with each exercise, repeat them over a period oftime, and you will witness a genuine and lasting change in your consciousness.DAY 1BE GENEROUS OF SPIRITOld pathway: Holding on to what is yoursNew pathway: Sharing yourselfExercise: Today be aware of old habits that cause you to react with “me first.”Watch yourself holding back instead of giving. If you see hints of selfishness,greed, fear of lack, fear of loss, and other kinds of contraction around giving,stop and take a deep breath. Cut off the reaction, and go back on the self. Waitand see if a new way of responding comes up. It’s okay if it doesn’t. Juststopping the old reaction is a step forward.To lay down a new pathway, look for one opportunity today where you can be kind,affectionate, or appreciative to someone. Anticipate someone’s need before theyask. See what you can do to go out of your way to help. Ask what it means to begenerous, and see yourself in that role. Act on your generous impulses insteadof shrinking away from them.DAY 2BE LOVING AND LOVABLEOld pathway: Suppressing loveNew pathway: Expressing loveExercise: Today your goal is to turn repression into expression. Inside us allthere are feelings and impulses that we resist. We don’t express them even whenthey are completely positive. It may be healthy or socially prudent not toexpress how hostile you feel at a given moment, but repressing something aspositive and basic as love is self-destructive. Happiness consists of knowingwhat you need and gaining fulfillment from someone who wants to meet your need.Since giving is easier than receiving for most people, show some aspect of lovetoday that you would normally repress. This doesn’t mean that you suddenly comeout of your shell and say “I love you”—although that is often a very welcomething to say and to hear. Instead, think of your mother or someone else wholoved you in a very natural way. What did she do to express love? She lookedafter your needs, she put you ahead of herself, she didn’t judge or criticize,she helped heal your wounds, and she supported you when you were nervous,afraid, or insecure. Find a way today to enact that role for someone else.It is impossible to turn “I am not lovable enough” into “I am perfectly lovable”overnight. A process is involved. What made you feel unlovable was a series ofmessages from other people; these negative messages became incorporated intoyour self-image. So let’s reverse the process. If others give you positivemessages that you are lovable, your self-image will shift in that direction. Bitby bit, you will earn a new self-image.Be aware of yourself today in terms of love. Watch to see if you push away otherpeople’s positive messages. See if you fall into the groove of acting neutral,indifferent, or careless with others. If so, stop. All retraining requires thatyou stop doing what doesn’t work. If you simply stop, that is a step forward.But also add to the new pathway. Be someone who is worthy of love. A smile, akind word, any act of bonding—these small daily things tell other people thatyou care. Most love isn’t romantic. It’s an expression of a warm heart, and theone thing that every warm-hearted person does is care. Instead of worrying ifyou will ever find the right one to love you, be the right one. The more youexpress love, the more your higher brain will automatically react in lovingways.DAY 3LET GOOld pathway: Holding on to resistanceNew pathway: Surrendering to what isExercise: Today you need to let go of something. Keep your attention on this,and when a moment arises when your inner voice says “I’m right, dammit,” or “I’mnot giving in,” just stop. You don’t have to do the opposite of anything. Merelypause and be self-aware. Notice that you are clinging, holding on, demandingthat the situation change. How does this make you feel? Almost always, holdingon feels tight, constricted, angry, and stressful. If you feel any of this, walkaway and relax. Do deep breathing or meditation. Center yourself before youreact.Letting go is both emotional and physical. You are opening a pathway ofacceptance. Whatever your inner voice says, reality is simply what is. You needto look at “what is,” which means dropping “what should be.” Don’t think of thisas surrender in the sense of losing. Think of it as being more open, lettingyour brain gain more information. At a higher level, you are also calling uponthe brain to deliver better responses that suit the situation.Being self-aware will alert you to your negative reactions. In the past, the oldpathways gave you two options when you felt negative: shut down or act out. Mostpeople shut down, since they’ve learned from painful experience that acting outtheir judgment, anger, resentment, and ego gets poor responses from others. Yetthis was never an either/or situation. Instead of shutting down or acting out,you can simply be aware. When you do that, you let in the light ofconsciousness. Your higher self is actually nothing more than expandedconsciousness. By holding on to anything, you squeeze it into a narrow place inyour mind—the mental equivalent of folding your arms tight across your chest.You can spend a lot of time with tight-folded arms, a clenched jaw, and beadyeyes, or you can notice what you are doing and stop.The mental equivalent works the same way. You can cast other people as wrong fora long time, or you can notice what you are doing and stop. The process ofletting go begins here. In this case, once you stop clenching inside, your brainis automatically freed up. Over time openness becomes a habit. The new pathwaysreplace the old by gaining fresh experiences. Once you actually look for proofthat holding on isn’t working, it’s easy to find. What takes patience is to findthe rewards in letting go. Life is hugely complicated; shutting yourself up intoa small room delivers a safer reality. But once you let life flow in by nolonger resisting, letting go becomes easier, and then you see that life is yoursto experience as an individual. Bliss is universal; finding our own kind ofbliss is a privilege that belongs only to you.DAY 4FIND YOUR FULFILLMENTOld pathway: RoutineNew pathway: SatisfactionExercise: Today you need to break out of predictable routine. That’s easy todo—too easy, if all we’re talking about is asking for poached eggs instead ofscrambled, or turning the channel from Sunday Night Football. Routine is rootedin the brain. It’s a form of survival when in truth it never ran a risk of notsurviving. Most people’s lives are established when it comes to the basics offood, shelter, and clothing. The fact that we can take survival for granted,however, doesn’t convince the lower brain. It is constantly trying to shoreitself up against famine, aggression, exposure to the elements, and a dangerousenvironment. Hence the sense of risk, amounting to dread, when people are cutoff from their familiar routines.Your goal today is to learn to expand beyond your brain’s habit of equating new,fresh, and unexpected with alien, threatening, and anxious. Be aware of how youstructure your whole day around making yourself feel safe. Protecting yourselfis a lower-brain instinct. But remember, the lower brain never evolves; itcontinues to do what it did millions of years ago. Only your higher brain canevolve, but it won’t if you live behind mental barriers. Break out of thesecurity systems you’ve built around yourself, even for a little while. When youdo, what happens? You will walk around feeling insecure, and that’s your actualreality. We are not talking about foolish risk-taking. We are talking about theroot of insecurity, which is the belief that the universe would never uphold ourexistence.To dispel that deep sense of insecurity, you must go through a process ofretraining your brain. Give it room to evolve. The lower brain won’t go away;you need its protective instincts some of the time, although very rarely. Mostpeople are protecting themselves from imagined threats. But if your higher braindominates, the protective voice will grow smaller and less anxious.Imagine that you have been dropped unwillingly into the middle of Haiti afterits devastating earthquake or into Malaysia after its tsunami. You will probablygo into some kind of anxiety or panic. Now imagine that you have voluntarilygone to those disaster sites to help. You are there for a higher purpose,something deeply meaningful to you, and therefore, the voice of threat isrendered marginal.Meaning overrides insecurity. That’s the key. So today find something to do thatexpresses your purpose. Let life support your purpose. Be decisive; know whatyou are about. If you cannot think of anything that fits the bill, then read abook about someone in real life who inspires you, a potential role model. Absorbyourself in the path that this person took. Now sit back and consider whetheryou have been given a clue about your path. Clues are always present. It’s partof the dharma, the cosmic force that will uphold anything you intend for a deeplevel inside yourself.DAY 5ENABLE YOUR HEALINGOld pathway: Passive neglectNew pathway: Active well-beingExercise: Today your goal is to help your body’s healing system. Healing systemis a relatively new term medically, in that in brings together several of thebody’s systems. The immune system may be central to healing a wound orinfection, but emotional healing involves the brain, exercise involves themuscles and cardiovascular system, diet involves the digestive system, and soon. People pop vitamin pills thinking that they are helping to fend off disease,but the benefit is minimal and mostly unnecessary given a healthy balanced diet.When the same person refuses to address damaging stress in their lives orlong-held anger and resentment, the result isn’t passive; the healing system ismeeting a serious obstacle.Today, break through your passive neglect. When you brush your teeth, thinkabout the whole issue of your dental health. When you eat breakfast, considerhow to nurture your body. When you take the elevator instead of the stairs,consider how good it is to be active. As you do these things, check in on howyou feel. The reason you neglect yourself always has an underlying feelingattached to it.You are tuned to the world, including the subtle world, through body awarenessas much as mental awareness. Are you happy to tune in to yourself physically?Many women, indoctrinated to have a poor body image, don’t want to tune in atall. They use worry and self-judgment instead. They accuse their bodies for notbeing perfect, a form of rejection that carries a hidden price: They arerejecting the body’s healing system at the same time. Thus it becomes anannoyance when the body signals discomfort, and if the discomfort is actualpain, their only response is anxiety and panic.You can avert all this by tuning in, not out of anxiety, but as your body’sally. In turn, your body will become your ally. The most positive signal you cansend every day is to be aligned with balance in all things. Your body isconstantly in the state of dynamic equilibrium called homeostasis. This is thesame as a car idling at the stoplight or setting a thermostat and walking away.Homeostasis is meant to be disturbed, to be thrown off its set point. The reasonis that a body at rest also needs to move at a moment’s notice. If you decide torun after a cab, rush to the phone, or enter a marathon, homeostasis gives youthe flexibility to do so.Passive neglect reinforces the body at rest; it chooses inertia over dynamism.What helps homeostasis to remain dynamic, flexible, and available at the touchof intention? All kinds of things, as long as they are the opposite of inertia.Exercise wards off physical inertia. Taking an interest in life wards off mentalinertia. Best of all, self-awareness enables the whole mind-body system to bedynamic, because self-awareness makes room for spontaneity. The best kind offreedom is unexpected, because it renders you open to surprise, passion, and theunknown. So see if you can trigger those things in your daily life. Surpriseyourself; take an interest; find something to be passionate about. These are alldeep forms of healing, and when you pursue them, you are truly finding yourhealing.DAY 6RAISE YOUR EXPECTATIONSOld pathway: Limited expectationsNew pathway: Unlimited potentialExercise: Today you need to be fulfilled, not by waiting for a magical day inthe future but by changing the pathways of fulfillment. Fulfillment ismultidimensional. It feels satisfying physically, emotionally, and spiritually.The ingredients are, first, a general sense of relaxation and contentment in thebody, along with the absence of tension and discomfort. Second, at the emotionallevel, you feel a sense of personal satisfaction; you are living your life well.With this comes an absence of threat, isolation, loneliness, and emotionalbaggage. Finally, on the spiritual level, you feel at peace and centered,connected with your highest self. This comes with an absence of doubt, of fearof death, and of abandonment by God.Although only a sketch, this picture of your multidimensionality shows you whereto look for fulfillment. Any of these dimensions will do, and if you trulypursue physical, mental, and spiritual satisfaction, they will merge. All thepathways will be open to the many avenues that fulfillment comes from. There isno set recipe. It’s true that giving brings fulfillment to many people, andothers experience satisfaction only when being of service. These are generalconclusions only. Because you are multidimensional, any map you draw leads towhere you want to go.The chief obstacle is limited expectations. Whether they admit it or not, mostpeople are unfulfilled because they set their sights too low. They have in factachieved what they imagined would make them happy. For decades psychologistslooked at what makes people miserable and psychologically impaired. In the newfield of positive psychology, researchers instead look at what makes peoplehappy, but their findings are full of contradictions.Everyone tries to be happy; everyone pursues the thing they think will make themhappy. But it turns out that human beings are bad predictors. When we get thething that should make us happy, it doesn’t. New mothers, for example, oftenfeel frustrated and depressed by taking care of their babies; some mothers rankcaring for small children as a source of unhappiness, along with doing householdchores. Having money makes people happy only up to a certain point. They reach anice level of comfort, but then extra money increases their unhappiness byadding responsibility and worry. And once you have enough money, you receivediminishing returns from getting more. The second Porsche doesn’t carry thethrill of the first; the tenth time you stay at the Ritz, the glamour has mostlyrubbed off.Wealth aside, the essential reality is that achieving fulfillment requireshaving higher expectations. As you go through your day, experiencing all kindsof things, pause and ask yourself, “Honestly, what is this doing for me?” Theanswer won’t be cut and dried. Some things will be more fulfilling than youmight suppose; others will fall flat. Then ask yourself, “What would be morefulfilling instead?” In other words, embark on a journey of discovery. You willquickly find that discovery isn’t a piece of cake; obstacles and limitationswill lie in your way.Be aware of the following kinds of limitations: Thinking that you don’t deservebetter. Fear of not being accepted. Fear of failure. Fear of sticking out toomuch from the crowd. Anxiety over leaving your old ways behind. For many people,happiness equates with settling. They choose good enough because it’s safe. Butgood enough means that your dreams will be so limited that fulfilling them willbring only small satisfactions. Take a second look at the people you associatewith. Their expectations are likely to be your own, because in all likelihoodyou want to fit in with your own crowd. You aren’t asked to disapprove of yourfriends or yourself—quite the opposite.Choose the person you most admire among your circle, or the one whose dreamssecretly match yours. Here is a living example of how to expand yourexpectations. You can get closer to this person, ask for advice, and share yourheart’s desires. Yes, this means taking a risk. Exposing who you want to beisn’t necessarily safe. But finding out who you want to be is crucial, becauseit will keep your eye on the prize. You will accept constant growth, an unendingjourney, expanding horizons. Achieving fulfillment isn’t like building a wallbrick by brick until you stand back to admire the finished product. It’s likestepping into a river in which you can’t step into the same place twice.The one image is static; the other, dynamic. The one is fixed securely in place;the other leads who knows where. You have neural pathways to deal with bothextremes. Stability is important, but so is dynamism. Most people are soimprinted to be secure that they don’t have much play on the dynamic side. Theirlandscape features more walls than rivers. As you go through your day, try to beaware of how your personal landscape looks. That’s the first step in gettingaround the walls. Some will need tearing down; others will need climbing over orsneaking around while not knocking them down. It feels good to live with as fewwalls as possible if they are the kind that shut out new possibilities. See ifyou can take one deep breath of real satisfaction today. In that lies the pathto lasting fulfillment.DAY 7LET IT BEOld pathway: Struggling to achieveNew pathway: Using least effortExercise: Today is about learning to let it be. The basics are simple: Intendfor a certain outcome, let your intention go, and wait for the result. There isnothing esoteric about these steps. You go through them every time you send anorder to your brain, such as wanting to raise your arm. The intention is carriedout automatically. You don’t stand watch to see if your brain will respond theway you ask it to. The feedback loop between intention and result runs smoothlyand automatically.The art of being consists in bringing the same trust and effortlessness to otheraspects of your life. The difference is that in the West, people keep events “inhere” apart from events “out there.” Claiming that one’s intention can affect anexternal situation sounds normal in Eastern spiritual traditions, which holdconsciousness to be everywhere, both “in here” and “out there.” One worldview isdualistic; the other is unified. But terminology is irrelevant; the proof is inthe pudding. Can you have an intention and allow it to manifest withoutstruggling to achieve your goal?The world’s wisdom traditions say that you can. “Letting it be” means beingconnected to the same source in pure Being as everything in the cosmos. Whenthis connection is strong, having a desire “in here” leads to a result “outthere” automatically, because the underlying unity transcends boundaries andartificial separation. To arrive at the point where you are completely connectedis a process, one that takes place through the brain. As in the previousexercises, you only need to become more self-aware.In practice, what I’m asking you to do is this: Have one intention today, let goof it, and see what happens. If you get the result you want, appreciate the factthat you connected, you tuned in to the mechanism of least effort. “Leasteffort” is the same as letting your Being do the work. If you don’t get theresult you want, shrug it off and try again with a new intention. Many times,however, the result won’t be obvious. You will come close or sense that thingsworked out approximately as you wished.This is part of the process, so notice that you came close, and accept theresult you received. (Most of the time you will have to do more work to achievewhat you wanted, but that’s okay.) In this exercise, there is no failure.Creating a strong connection to your Being is the same as creating any newpathway. You are making progress if any of the following indicators appear:It takes less effort to get to a result.You feel less stressed about getting a good outcome.People begin to cooperate with you more easily.You sense that everything is going to be all right.You start to have strokes of luck.Events mesh together in synchronous fashion.Results start to appear more quickly.Creative solutions appear as if out of nowhere.None of this is mysticism. Every life already contains synchronous happenings,strokes of luck, and happy coincidences. Instead of accepting that these areaccidental or random events, you can now look upon them as a sign that making aconnection is very real and possible. Mastering the art of being takes time andself-awareness. But your brain is designed to forge the ultimate pathway tofulfillment, which is effortless.Let’s say that you have begun the process of reshaping new pathways. At firstthis requires effort and patience. You must address the old pathways, whichrepresent imprinted memories, habits, and conditioning, over and over. You arechanging the default mode of your brain, and it takes conscious attention to dothat. But the project is highly rewarding, and if you persist, various signs ofprogress will appear, including the following:Your internal dialogue quiets down.Negative responses diminish.You resist and control impulses more easily.A sense of meaning grows.You begin to feel cared for.You feel less regret over the past and less anxiety about the future.Decision making becomes clearer.At a certain stage, you reach a tipping point. Having done the work ofimprinting your brain to have new responses, you can trust those responses. Thisopens the door for Being. You can “let it be” when your brain starts taking careof you. You already trust your brain to take care of you in countless ways. Itautomatically controls hormone levels, respiration, the sleep cycle, heart rate,appetite, sexual response, the immune system, and much more. So the art of beingisn’t foreign to you; it is second nature."},{"pageContent":"TRANSCENDENCE: GOD APPEARSWe have reached the point where a complete transformation is possible. A God whohardly matters can turn into a God who matters more than anything else. Thiskind of transformation leads to freedom. Who wouldn’t want to accept Rumi’senticing invitation when he says,Out beyond ideas of wrong-doingand right-doing there is a field.I’ll meet you there.When the soul lies down in that grassthe world is too full to talk about.There’s the prize. But at the same time, transformation is threatening. Our corebeliefs define us. We resist having them ripped away from us just as we fearradical surgery.To see God without illusions, we’ve had to overturn conventional religion. Wehad no choice. Religion does its worst because of lower-brain responses (fear ofpunishment, us versus them, the need for security and safety) mixed in withtribalism, cultural mythology, childhood fantasies, and projections. The wholemélange was unhealthy. More to the point, it wasn’t God. Dawkins and companywere absolutely right to attack these illusions. But they didn’t lay a hand onGod, because they never dismantled their own bundle of illusions.What does that take? During the dark days of the Civil War, Abraham Lincolnrealized that the Union would defeat the Confederacy, but the old United Statescouldn’t be reassembled without a drastic change. Slavery had not beenprohibited in the Constitution. Lincoln had grown up with the same mentality ofracism as almost everyone else. The inferiority of black people was an ingrainedbelief. As with all core beliefs, its strong emotional hold was hard to shake.In Steven Spielberg’s moving film Lincoln, there’s a finely imagined scene whereLincoln’s mind finds an escape from racial prejudice. He is sitting alone in thewar room, which is deserted except for his two young secretaries. The mood issomber, naturally; moments of quiet only brought home the true horror of thebloody conflict. At such a moment, what does Lincoln bring up? Euclid, the greatGreek mathematician. A dropout after grade school, Lincoln had educated himselfby becoming a voracious reader, and in the theorems of Euclid, he discovered alogical proposition: If two things are equal to a third thing, they are equal toeach other. He repeats this basic piece of logic in a fervent voice, but Lincolndoesn’t reveal its hidden significance. We are asked to grasp the implicationourselves, something like the following:If a white man was created by God,And if a black man was created by God,Black and white men are equal before God.The higher brain, we might say, proved its superiority. Trained to value reason,the cortex couldn’t retreat into lower responses to the slavery issue(self-protection, suspicion, hatred, fear), even though these responses stillexisted, even in a great man like Lincoln. His ultimate view of the slaveryissue was spiritual. His personal journey was a struggle—to the end, Lincolnnever had a close friend who was black—but logic aided him to get there.There’s something explosive in simple logic. It has the power to make the mindquestion everything it has hitherto taken for granted. The things we take forgranted are more powerful than anything else. They support our worldview,holding it together, secure and safe. In this book, true knowledge of God wasunreachable as long as we took for granted three things: reality, consciousness,and God himself. God was simply there in the background, doing nothing. Beingconscious was the opposite of being asleep; it had no hidden power. Reality wasthe material universe and the stuff that filled it.We’ve now exploded all of those assumptions and have arrived at a simple pieceof logic that can free the mind totally, once and for all:If God is reality,And if reality is consciousness,Then God is consciousness.The trick is to make this logic livable. It remains dead as just a set of ideas.The mistake when we try to think about God—pro, con, or in between—is that Godis not an idea. I was testing out this book on social media (it seemedappropriate to keep up with the times), and one day I tweeted, “Militantatheists and religious fundamentalists are both obsessed with God. But whatobsesses them is an idea. God is not an idea. God is consciousness.” A heateddiscussion arose, and one person tweeted back, “You’re in the same boat withDawkins. Consciousness is just your idea of God.” But that’s not so. God isreality itself. He isn’t a thing, which is what fills the material world. He’snot an image, feeling, sensation, or thought, which fills the subtle world. Godinhabits a third world beyond anything that words and ideas can describe. Thisis the transcendent world, the place where true knowledge of God is found.THE MYSTERY OF ONENESSYou get to the transcendent world by first arriving at a dead end. Thinking musthit a wall. This is bound to happen for one inescapable reason. Our minds aredesigned to process opposites: light versus dark, good versus evil, insideversus outside, subjective versus objective. Duality is the name of the game.God, however, cannot be described from the state of duality. He isn’t here orthere; he’s everywhere. He doesn’t know this or that; he knows everything. Toborrow a metaphor from the Vedic tradition, looking for God is like a thirstyfish looking for a drink of water. What you seek is all around you, but youdon’t realize it. A fish might leap up and find a place that is not ocean. Wecan’t jump out of the everyday world to find a place that is not dual. God, itmust be admitted, is everywhere and nowhere at the same time.It would seem that finding God is self-defeating, since our minds are set up toexperience only duality. One approach might be to empty your mind of allopposites. Since God has no opposite, what you will be left with is Oneness. Theway it works is something like this. A crisis has arisen, and people are rushingaround in a panic. The crisis could be anything—a hurricane, a bank failure, apolitical upheaval. You are tempted to join in the rush, but you tell yourself,“God isn’t found here. He isn’t the crisis or the solution but both. He isn’taction or inaction but beyond both. He isn’t panic or calm but beyond both.” Byexamining every detail of duality, you stop being attached to mental constructsand the emotions they arouse.Still, it would be hard to imagine anything less suited to everyday life.Constant rejection isn’t practical, not when you have to choose between A and B.Do I want oatmeal this morning or toast and coffee? Neither one is God, yet Ihave to eat breakfast. Choices are inescapable. They are the essence of life aslong as we remain in duality. So what good is Oneness when it comes to leadingyour life? What can it actually do?Human beings have pondered this question and wound up in a bad state. Religionbegan with the right answer. Going back to its roots in India, religion wasgrounded on the certainty that God creates, governs, and controls the universe.Therefore God is the source of all love, beauty, and truth. God’s perfection cannever be shattered. Divine light radiates through every speck and particle ofthe world. Yet this certainty, instead of making people feel optimistic andcared for, did the opposite. They felt unworthy and punished. The gap betweenperfection and imperfection never went away. People gazed at God across anunbridgeable gap and despaired.Eventually the strain between a perfect God and an imperfect world led to acrack in the cosmic egg, which we call science. Oneness was dismantled intomeasurable facts. Psychology shifted. Ordinary people resented that a perfectGod lorded it over them. Online Richard Dawkins reposts for his followers hisreasons for being an atheist. Some examples:I’m an atheist because I choose knowledge over mythology.I’m an atheist because I don’t want to be associated with the heinous teachingsand actions of a so-called peaceful religion.I’m an atheist because after I rejected organized religion, “spirituality” hadnothing left to hold it up.These are like the hostile emotions of a prisoner who has escaped his jailer.They persist even now, four hundred years after Galileo and Copernicus broke theChurch’s monopoly on truth. Medieval Christians’ anxiety at being sinners hasmorphed into outrage today. But worried or angry, the problem of dualityremains. Thomas Aquinas wasn’t wrong when he said that all causes need a sourcethat isn’t caused. He wasn’t wrong to say that a world filled with design needsa source that didn’t have a designer, or that the creator had to be uncreated.Science is making the same point when it says that time and space must have asource that is beyond time and space. God talk has turned into physics talk; thedilemma remains the same.Bridging the gap between duality and Oneness seems like a classic case of “youcan’t get there from here.” Yet there is a way forward, derived from wisdomtraditions that look at Oneness not as an unreachable God but as our source hereand now. Listen to the South Indian spiritual master Nisargadatta Maharaj as headvises a worried questioner:Q: I am never sure of what reality is.A: As long as you allow yourself an abundance of moments of peace, you will findreality.Q: I did try.A: Never steadily. Otherwise, you would not be asking such questions. You areasking because you are not sure of yourself. And you are not sure of yourselfbecause you never paid attention to yourself, only to your experiences.The tone is bracing—Maharaj isn’t going to let the questioner off the hook—butthe way forward is clearly laid out as Maharaj expands upon his answer.Be interested in yourself beyond all experience, be with yourself, loveyourself; the ultimate security is found only in self-knowledge.This is the same answer given by Vedanta, the oldest and most honored spiritualtradition in India. Reality is located in the self. To understand why this isthe right answer, we must define self differently from the “I” that thinks,feels, and moves through the world. That self constantly creates doubts andquestions. The self that is certain about reality has a wider vision. It looksat its own awareness, leaving aside daily experiences, to discover the source ofreality.Maharaj goes on to tell the questioner how vital it is to shift his attention inthe direction of self-awareness:Be honest with yourself and you will not feel betrayed. Virtues and powers aremere tokens for children to play with. They are useful in the world but do nottake you out of it. To go beyond, you need alert immobility, quiet attention.God is reached by “going beyond,” which is the definition of transcending. Thereis no other way to get past the dead end where thinking stops being useful.Quiet awareness must step in. If it wants to, awareness is capable of goingbeyond the material and even the subtle world.Dawkins and company dismiss the whole project of “going beyond” as puredelusion. The self is the last thing they trust. I’ve had several head-to-headexchanges over this with Michael Shermer, the editor of Skeptic magazine, who isas stubborn in his materialistic viewpoint as anyone but not hostile ordemeaning. I might pose the question, “Who are you?”Shermer replies, “I am the sum of the processes in my brain.”I point out that he said “my” brain. “Who is this ‘me’? Don’t you want to know?”“No,” Shermer replies. “The self is an illusion. There are only brainprocesses.”“If that’s true,” I say, “you’re telling me that you feel okay about being azombie.”Shermer shrugs and smiles. “You use language to confuse people. I never askmyself such questions when you’re not around.”Shermer is enamored of Dennett’s zombie metaphor for the deterministic brain, asare many movement atheists. Besides, no one really believes that his own self isan illusion. We innately trust what we think; we accept our own point of view.If we didn’t, it would be like asking a stranger where the nearest gas stationis, and he replies, “Two blocks away. But I’m a liar.”Ninety-nine percent of scientists have no need to ask “Why am I?” They haveexperiments to run and data to collect. Even so, science has hit the same deadend that forces thinking to give up. The Big Bang is as inconceivable as God. Wecan’t envision it, since it was invisible and silent and neither hot nor cold.(All these qualities require the five senses, which didn’t exist.) Time andspace emerged from the Big Bang, so we can’t ask “where” or “when” it occurred;both concepts depend on time and space already being here. In short, scienceconfronts the pre-created state with no trustworthy way to cross the gap.Fortunately, a dead end for some is an open door for others. You don’t have tostare at God while remaining stuck in an imperfect world. Quite theopposite—Oneness can solve the woes of everyday life. In the Gita, Lord Krishnadeclares that all suffering is born of duality. If so, then a step out ofduality is a step of healing. God becomes useful once the transcendent world isreachable.BRIDGING THE GAPYou cross the gap all the time without knowing it. You make sound out of silenceand light out of darkness. Nothing you perceive around you—not this page, notthis room, not this house—has any reality except through you. How do you do it?By crossing the gap. The transcendent world isn’t a faraway place you might getto someday. It’s the workshop of creation where you go to find the raw materialof reality. A painter reaches for his paints to make a picture. Your rawmaterial is nothing more than a possibility. A possibility occurs in the mind;through the act of creation reality emerges. Now we see why there have to bethree worlds:The transcendent world is a field of infinite possibilities. It is the startingpoint, the womb of creation.The subtle world brings a possibility to mind as an image. Something real istaking shape.The material world presents the result. A new thing or event is manifested.All three worlds are in fact real, not just the end point, where the resultappears. Depending on your state of consciousness, depending on which world youinhabit, reality is completely different. The Vedic tradition provides a clearmap of the people who inhabit each world.When you are free, silent, at peace, and completely self-aware, you inhabit thetranscendent world. Labels applied to such people are Buddha, Christ, mahatma,swami, yogi, the enlightened, the awakened.When you are creative, imaginative, intuitive, insightful, and inspired, youinhabit the subtle world. Labels applied to such people are visionary, dreamer,genius, sage, seer, shaman, artist, and psychic.When you are involved with physical objects and sensations, you inhabit thematerial world. The blanket label for this is normal.You can see that human beings live in multiple dimensions. The rules change fromone to the other. If a bus hits you in a dream, which is a department of thesubtle world, your body isn’t injured. In the material world, it is. But gettinghit by a bus doesn’t prove that the material world is the only reality. Eachreality forms a stable framework of its own. If a piano string breaks, you can’tplay that note, no matter how inspired you are. But the note still exists inyour mind, because the subtle world precedes the material world. Without music,no one would build a piano in the first place.We’re not going to wade into the boggy marsh of metaphysics. The issue ispractical: When you cross the gap and come back again, what is actuallyhappening? A possibility comes true. Look at three such possibilities, eacharriving at a different result:You want a name for an Australian animal that hops across the landscape with itsyoung in its pouch. From the world of all possible words, you find kangaroo.You want to see the creature that matches this word. From the world of allpossible images, you fetch the picture of a mother kangaroo balancing on hertail while a joey peeks out of her pouch.You want a real kangaroo to touch. From the world of all possible objects, youfetch a live kangaroo.No one has any trouble with the first two examples, but they balk at the third.Surely fetching a word or an image can’t be the same as fetching a livekangaroo. But I can show you that they are the same. What is a live kangaroomade of? The look of it, the feel of it, the smell of it; its weight andsolidity; its shape and the way it behaves—all of these qualities, when fittedtogether in the right way, create a kangaroo, and since each is created in yourawareness, so is the animal itself.I realize that I might be creating a queasy feeling inside, since we accept that“of course” kangaroos exist without us. Actually, there’s no proof of that andnever has been. It’s just part of the psychology of certainty to posit a fixedworld with kangaroos hopping around in it. We must shift into the psychology ofcreativity. A creator is constantly making possibilities come true. All that ittakes is to be comfortable in all three worlds of the creative process:Transcendent world: You are comfortable here when you can experience allpossibilities. Your awareness is open. You are connected to the source. Yourconsciousness is merged with the mind of God.Subtle world: You are comfortable here when you can hold on to your vision. Youtrust yourself to follow where the mind goes. You aren’t bound up in resistance,objections, skepticism, and rigid beliefs. Inspiration occurs as a normal partof your existence.Material world: You are comfortable with your personal reality. You takeresponsibility for it. You read the world as a reflection of who you are andwhat is happening “in here.” As the reflection shifts and changes, you track thechanges occurring inside yourself.QUALIA AND THE CREATORPut all this together, and you have the special relationship that exists betweenhuman beings and God. It’s a creative relationship. It straddles the gap betweenthe uncreated and the created. I hope this special relationship no longer soundsstrange.I’ve tried to use ordinary words to ease you into realms that most peopleconsider mystical and therefore far away. The only technical term I want tointroduce is qualia, because it will make you a more confident creator. At itsmost basic, qualia is the Latin word for “quality,” meaning the sight, sound,touch, taste, and smell of things. Expand the meaning one step, and qualia alsoapplies to mental events. The redness of a rose in a florist shop is a qualia,but so is that same redness in the mind’s eye. The brain center for seeing arose “out there” or “in here,” which is the visual cortex, processes them thesame way.It’s easy to get stuck on the paleness of a mental image compared with a realrose. No one bleeds from the thorns of a mental rose. But vividness and palenessaren’t the issue. The same process creates a rose “in here” and “out there.”Besides, dreams can be so intense that you wake up disappointed—the real worldfeels flat by comparison. For artists, the discrepancy can be very wide, leadingJohn Keats to write, “Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard are sweeter.”What makes reality personal is the unique way you mix and match qualia. No twopeople do this in exactly the same way. Take a common experience: You arewalking down the street, and a big black dog suddenly runs in your direction.For person A this isn’t the same experience as for person B. Here are twopossibilities. Person A was once bitten by a dog, remembers the pain of beingbitten, avoids dogs, hears the black dog’s bark as threatening, and sees itsopen mouth as a weapon of attack. Person B is the dog’s owner, loves it, feelsrelieved that her missing dog has returned, hears its bark as a greeting, andsees its open mouth as a smile. Two different realities, each depending on thequalia that are made to fit like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle.You don’t observe yourself assembling your experiences, because creation happensinstantaneously. To see the pieces of the puzzle, we’ve taken a snapshot,stopping the flow of time, dissecting an organized picture into smallingredients. If you expand qualia fully, everything becomes an ingredient,including feelings, sensations, memories, and associations. Each experience getsassembled out of qualia. The picture doesn’t assemble itself. It only seems to.To become a creator, the role you were born to fill, you must take control overyour experience. You choose which qualia to plug in. If you are afraid of dogs,your past experience has accumulated to support your fear; new input can replacethose impressions. To treat that phobia, you can gradually reshape the brain’singrained reaction. If you see a big black dog coming at you, there’s no time tocreate a new reaction. But on your own you can desensitize your fear by takinggradual steps: looking at pictures of lovable dogs, visiting a pet store,touching a friendly dog that’s held on a leash. Even more powerful is to gaindirect control over your mental response. Fear is fixed and frozen. You canloosen it up and make it malleable instead. Imagine a frightening dog, then makeit larger or smaller in your mind’s eye, run it backward or in slow motion: Thiskind of mental “Photoshopping” puts you in control, a necessary step when fearis controlling you.Fear is an inner event, but what about the dog itself? Surely you didn’t producea Doberman pinscher out of nowhere. But nowhere is exactly where it came from. Adog is created out of molecules and atoms, which in turn are created out ofsubatomic particles that wink in and out of the quantum field. “Out” means thatthey go into the pre-created state. They return to their source, which is beyondtime, space, matter, and energy. Here nothing exists except possibilities. (Touse a technical term, a subatomic particle that has disappeared from thematerial world is in a “virtual” state.)The cycle that carries everything from uncreated to created occurs constantly;it is the basic rhythm of nature. The brain also processes reality through acycle that turns off and on thousands of times per second. The key is thesynapse, the gap between two neural connections. A chemical reaction jumps thegap (this is the on switch), and then the synapse is cleared for the next signal(the off switch). There are other basic on-off switches, keyed to the positiveand negative charges of ions passing through the cell membranes of neurons, butthe template remains the same. To a neuroscientist, the brain’s ability toprocess reality looks incredibly complex. How do millions of separate signalsget orchestrated from all parts of the brain to deliver a single picture of theworld? No one knows, even remotely, because when you examine the brain, you arelooking at a piano played by an invisible pianist—somehow eighty-eight keys movetogether to create music. Only in this case, a quadrillion synaptic connectionsflash on and off (a quadrillion being the estimated number in an adult brain).Watching them doesn’t tell us how sight, sound, taste, texture, and smell arecreated. Whatever is happening in the gap between creation and the source ofcreation goes on under the table. We can’t see it, only the physical result.Even less can we see how two brain cells, each with identical DNA, emitting thesame chemical and electrical signals, manage to produce sound in one part of thebrain and sight in another.Unless you are blinded by your allegiance to materialism, it’s obvious thatbrain cells can’t see or hear in the first place. This fact is supported by thesimplest test: if you peer inside, the brain is dark and silent. Somethingcreates glowing sunsets and the clap of thunder, along with all the ravishingsights and sounds of the world. That something is personal; it’s creating yourworld right this second. Genesis is now, but it isn’t happening in the brain.The creator behind the scenes is consciousness. It is using the brain, just as apianist uses a piano. Whatever consciousness wants comes into existence.Whatever consciousness blocks doesn’t come into existence. The choosing happensout of sight, but never out of mind. Why do you have eyes? Because the mindwanted to see, and it created eyes for that purpose, just as it created ears,nose, taste buds, and the whole mechanics of perception.“No, this cannot be,” a skeptic will object. Evolution created the human eyeover billions of years, starting with the impulse of one-celled organisms toseek the light. This objection doesn’t hold water. It’s like saying that pianokeys evolved before music was invented. The piano is an instrument to satisfythe mind’s desire for music. The human eye is an instrument to satisfy themind’s desire to view the created world. Every other qualia follows the samepattern. Consciousness created the sense of touch in order to feel the createdworld, the sense of hearing to hear the created world, and so on.Religion often emerges as the repository of irrational mythmaking. But theBiblical creation story gets one crucial thing right. God entered his creationin order to enjoy it. We are told that Adam and Eve “heard the sound of the LordGod as he was walking in the garden in the cool of the day” (Genesis 3:8). Inmodern terms, we’d say that consciousness permeates the world. Sight, sound, andall other qualities arose so that the universal mind could experience itself.Religion got something else right that was crucial: There are no limitations onthe creative process. Reality is as malleable as a dream. If you forget this,reality starts to freeze up, and then it’s only a small step to a world so rigidand self-enclosed that every other dimension is excluded. A classic examplearose when the Church denounced Galileo for heresy because he espoused thenotion that the Earth moves around the Sun, in contrast to the Church’sgeocentric view, in which the Earth is the immobile center of the universe.Brought before the Inquisition in 1633, the judges “forced him under the threatof torture to kneel and read aloud a long, abject retraction saying that he‘abjured, cursed, and detested’ the heliocentric theory.” (Legend has it,probably incorrectly, that as he rose to his feet, he muttered the words eppursi muove …, meaning, “and yet it does move …”)Physicist David Deutsch relates Galileo’s ordeal, as every scientist does, as avictory for direct observation of the heavens. It offended faith to second-guessGod’s works with mathematical calculations. In the long run, the great age ofscience was dawning. In the short run, Galileo was convicted and consigned tohouse arrest. Enough fear was created that science was suppressed in theMediterranean basin for centuries, Deutsch tells us. But he makes a crucialconcession here.Given that the Inquisition believed in divine revelation, Deutsch says, “theirworld-view was false, but it was not illogical.” One kind of observation, suchas Galileo’s, could not limit God. “As they would put it, God could produce thesame observed effects in an infinity of different ways.” Galileo’s theory aboutthe sun and the planets was arrogant if it claimed to be “a way of knowing,through one’s own fallible observation and reason, which way He chose.” God’sway is infinite; man’s way is finite.The language of Church authority is obnoxious to a scientist, but hidden insidethe judgment against Galileo is one of the essential points of Eastern wisdomtraditions. The visible world is a world only of appearances. Looking atappearances doesn’t tell you what creation is actually like. (Even the Earthgoing around the Sun turns out to be only an appearance. If you stand at theedge of the Milky Way, the whole solar system is orbiting around the galaxy. Ifyou stand at the starting point of the Big Bang, the Milky Way is rushing awayfrom every other galaxy as the universe expands, taking Earth with it. Indeed,Earth’s motion can be described from infinite perspectives, just as theInquisition claimed.) The ancient Vedic seers put this in terms of maya, whichmeans more than illusion. Maya is a goddess whose seductive charm tempts themind into believing that the unreal is actually real. Nothing she shows us istrustworthy. We are so distracted by the spectacle of life that we forget whocreated it, ourselves. We must place our trust in the creative process.Then God matters, more than anything in creation, because God is the word weapply to the source of creation. It isn’t necessary to worship the source,although reverence is certainly deserved if we want to give it. The necessarything is to connect. Across the gap in the transcendent world are some totallynecessary things that cannot be created, not by hand, by imagination, or bythought.WHAT GOD ACTUALLY ISASPECTS OF THE TRANSCENDENT WORLDPure awarenessPure intelligencePure creativityInfinite potentialUnbounded possibilitiesBlissSelf-organizationInfinite correlationAll matter and energy in a virtual stateThese are the best terms the mind can devise when looking at Oneness from acrossthe gap. The list doesn’t imply anything religious; it applies strictly toconsciousness and how it operates. Consciousness is creative and intelligent. Itcan correlate a quadrillion brain connections or the fifty processes that aliver cell performs. It can keep track of simultaneous activities at the sametime (allowing you to breathe, digest, walk, be pregnant, think about your baby,and feel happy at the same time).You are finding God whenever any of these aspects begins to expand. God enterseveryday life this way. When you experience greater creativity, you areinspired, which means “bringing in spirit.” It doesn’t matter if yourinspiration is to make cookies, while Michelangelo’s was to paint the ceiling ofthe Sistine Chapel. In both cases, an aspect of God, pure creativity, has beenbrought into the material world. The inspiration of a saint comes from the samesource. When Saint Francis of Assisi says, “If God can work through me, he canwork through anyone,” he is uttering the truth about how pure consciousnessenters the world: through each of us. No one is bound to the same creative path.Saint Francis chose to fashion his experience along the lines of humility,celibacy, charity, and devotion. Michelangelo chose art, beauty, nobility, andgrandeur. These are all qualia, and so are the ingredients that go into allexperiences.But if you look at the list again, the items on it are not qualia. They are morebasic than any experience. Existence itself depends upon them. Withoutintelligence, nothing would ever be understandable. Without creativity, nothingwould ever be new. Without organizing power, everything would remain in a stateof chaos. The one aspect of God that looks out of place is bliss. Isn’t blissthe experience of happiness, which is much less than divine? But when used byBuddhists and the Vedic sages who preceded them, bliss (Ananda) is the vibrancyof creation, the underlying dynamism that enters the world as vitality, desire,ecstasy, and joy.So, did you create that big black dog running toward you? Yes. Not “you” as anindividual but “you” as an agent of consciousness itself. Clinging toindividuality creates confusion here. A wave can lap at the White Cliffs ofDover and ask, “Did I create this magnificence?” Yes and no. The ocean washedaway the shore; each wave played its part. You have always been universal, andto see yourself otherwise would be unreal. This is made clear in another Vedicimage. When an ocean wave rises up, it says to itself, “I am a separateindividual,” but when it falls back, it says, “I am the ocean.” As a creator,you rise up from the ocean of consciousness to create your personal reality.When you go deep inside, however, you see that you belong to the ocean ofconsciousness. It is creating reality through you without ever leaving thetranscendent world.In the end, to know God is to remember and to forget. You forget the illusionthat you are separate, isolated, powerless, and stranded in an overwhelmingcosmos. You remember that you are the dreamer who is in charge of the dream.What you perceive through the five senses isn’t the same as reality. Go beyondthe shadow play of appearances, and reality will greet you, as Rumi says, in “aworld too full to talk about.” Enter the realm of all possibilities. Making themcome true is a great gift. It comes directly from God."},{"pageContent":"THE TOUGHEST QUESTIONWhen you fully remember who you are, you become one with God. An invisible gracepermeates every aspect of your life. The hope expressed in Psalm 23, “Surelygoodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life,” comes true. Youcannot achieve such a state of grace overnight. You and I, wherever we findourselves, must balance hope, faith, and knowledge. It’s a precarious balance.There may be moments of grace that break through like sunshine through clouds.These moments don’t come every day, however, unlike the personal trials that weface. The trick is to begin looking for the grace hidden beneath the struggle,and then your trials start to ease and fade away.I want to show that spirituality can be a way of life at every stage of thepath. At the beginning—and well into the middle—“the courage to be” means thecourage to be confused. God seems relevant off and on. The possibility offinding peace or trusting in a higher power flickers. The rest of the time Godis nowhere. Are these glimmers of the divine enough? Obviously not. When youwatch the evening news, you will see some fresh disaster—a jetliner crashinginto the Atlantic, genocide in the Congo, a gunman on the rampage in a movietheater who then shoots himself—pulling you back into the “real world.” Your oldconditioning kicks in: You believe the world is full of violence and chaos, andyou have no choice but to meet it on its own terms, struggling to hold your own.It takes a hidden element to keep us from backsliding into our old ingrainedreactions. That element is wholeness. Unknown to us, wholeness is in charge ofour lives. It keeps chaos at bay. It provides support even when bad things arehappening. The world’s wisdom traditions have an axiom: “As it is in the great,so it is in the small.” In other words, even the tiniest fragment of reality isthe whole. But you and I cling to the perspective of a fragment. Taking thispoint of view, no one can see wholeness. The air in a party balloon would besurprised to hear that there is no difference between it and the Earth’satmosphere. Until the balloon is popped, a thin membrane keeps it from knowingwho it really is.For you and me, the thin membrane is mental. From the perspective of a fragment,you approach your life as “I,” a single, isolated person. This “I” possessesindividual drives and motives. It wants more for itself. It thinks thatconsciousness is private. Looking out for number one, along with immediatefamily, takes top priority. But no matter how strong “I” becomes, outside forcesare far more powerful, which makes existence insecure. God has the perspectiveof wholeness. At the end of the spiritual journey, the seeker who has becomeenlightened has also gained this perspective. He can say Aham Brahmasmi, “I amthe universe,” which is like seeing infinity in all directions, with noboundaries or limitations.Mystery swirls around this word enlightenment, what it means and how to getthere. Stripped of mystery, you are enlightened when you become completelyself-aware. Each step on the spiritual path expands the self-awareness youstarted with. Your sense of self changes. You begin to perceive that wholenessis possible. (To lift an image from the Vedic tradition, you smell the sea evenbefore you reach it.)If you observe the following changes in yourself, wholeness is actually dawning.BECOMING WHOLEHOW THE PATH CHANGES YOUYou feel less isolated, more connected to everything around you.Insecurity is replaced with a sense of safety.You realize that you belong.The demands of “I, me, and mine” are not so strong.You can see from a wider perspective than self-interest.You act on the impulse to help and serve.Life and death merge into a single cycle. Creation and destruction are no longerfrightening.Us-versus-them fades away. Divisions seem less meaningful.Status and power become less important.The ups and downs of everyday life don’t trigger you as much.You feel guided in your actions. Life is no longer random and full of impendingcrises.You feel more balanced and at peace with yourself.Being whole is a state that grows inside you, but reality has always been whole.The entire universe conspires to bring about every moment in time. In Sanskritthis fact is compressed in the verb dhar, “to uphold.” Reality upholds itselfand all the fragments that seem to exist in it. The fragmentation that is soobvious in the material world is maya, a part of the illusion. Gazing atbillions of galaxies masks the reality that they all came from one event, a BigBang that had no fragments. This is easy to understand now that physics hastraced all matter and energy back to their source. But the mind has no Big Bangto refer to. Thinking is always fragmented. It takes place one thought at atime, so makes it much harder to see that all thoughts come from one mind. “My”mind is the most convincing fragment of all.If you tell someone to stop clinging to the notion of “my” mind, they’ll lookalarmed and say, “You want me to lose my mind?” No, you want them to gain cosmicmind instead. It helps to substitute something you can actually see: your body.While you are focused on doing something small and specific—reading thesewords—fifty trillion cells are upholding that tiny action. Cells are not fooledby their isolated situation as individuals. They operate from wholeness all thetime. Each is leading a spiritual life that any saint would envy.Every cell follows a higher purpose, maintaining the whole body.Each cell knows its place in the body. It has total security.The body protects and embraces the life of every cell.Without judgment or prejudice, every cell is accepted.Every cell lives in the moment, constantly renewed, never clinging to the oldand outworn.The natural flow of life is trusted to operate with supreme efficiency.Individual cells are born and die, yet this all takes place against the body’sperfect balance.None of these things are spiritual aspirations; they are facts of dailyexistence at the level of your cells. Everything that seems unreachable inspiritual terms—perfect surrender, humility, innocence, nonviolence, reverencefor life—has been built into you. It doesn’t matter how minuscule a single redblood corpuscle is; the wisdom of life upholds it.This leads to a surprising conclusion. For a cell to remain alive, it dependsupon infinity. A single cell can say Aham Brahmasmi without spending years in acave in the Himalayas. Saying “I am the universe” doesn’t mean that you arevery, very big. The issue isn’t about size, place, time, or space. It’s abouteverything in creation being the same in essence, despite all appearances. Suchdifferences, to use a Vedic image, are like a gold watch and a gold ring arguingover which one is more valuable. Trapped in their egos, they can’t see that theyare made of the same essence, which is gold. Brain cells exhibit intelligence.Is intelligence big or small? Would you need a lunch sack to carry it around inor a shipping container? The question is meaningless. Intelligence has nophysical size. All the invisible attributes that uphold life have no physicalsize. The beauty of the spiritual path is that you are supported by an infinitepower every step of the way.The real issue is how much of infinity you can absorb into your life. Whenexpansion is infinite, the whole project feels daunting. Why challenge yourboundaries, which feel like home? You might go flying outward like a paddleball,only to come springing back on a rubber band. A liver or heart cell isfortunate. To remain alive, it must connect with wholeness. It cannot doubt oropt out, turn its back on its creator, or denounce God as a delusion. But youare even more fortunate. You have self-awareness, the ability to know who youare. So your spiritual path comes down to choosing an identity. You act like anisolated individual or like the whole. You either align yourself with theuniverse or you don’t.Alignment = self-acceptance, flow, balance, orderliness, being at peaceNonalignment = self-judgment, suffering, struggle, opposition, restlessness,disorderIf you focus on the right side of the equation, life looks incrediblycomplicated. Paralyzed by a welter of choices, you’d hardly be able to start thecar. At any given moment, you’d be deciding whether to accept or resist, tostruggle or let go. Perhaps that’s why we can’t stop fantasizing aboutperfection. If you can only get the perfect body, the perfect house, the perfectmate, you will escape the hardest thing in life, which is ambivalence. Allbodies, houses, and mates have imperfections. There are good days and bad. Lovecan unexpectedly turn into boredom or even hate.The left side of each equation, however, consists of only one word. You faceonly a single choice: to align yourself with wholeness or not. Simplicity isextremely powerful. You ask God to uphold you, and everything else follows. Thisis the holistic solution to all problems.Many pages ago I mentioned how impossible it was to live as Jesus taught in theSermon on the Mount. The lilies of the field do not toil or spin, but humanbeings spend a lifetime of toil. Jesus was holding out the same holisticsolution that we have arrived at: Providence will uphold you when you aretotally aligned with God, as nature upholds all simpler life-forms. “Look at thebirds of the air; they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet yourheavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they? And can any ofyou by worrying add a single hour to your span of life?” (Matthew 6:26–27). Theexpression may be poetic, but the logic is pure wisdom: Alignment is the naturalway; nonalignment isn’t.THE FIVE “POISONS”It’s hard to be left behind, but that’s the situation we all find ourselves in.If we could be sitting at the feet of Jesus, Buddha, or one of the great Vedicrishis, they would show us, day by day, when we were aligned with God and whenwe weren’t. The New Testament swings constantly between the master’s rebukes andhis praise. At one moment, Jesus scorns his followers for demanding healings andmiracles. At another moment, he bestows healings and miracles with a smile. Itmust have been incredibly confusing for them. Caught between rebuke andblessing, the disciples needed constant course correction.You and I need course correction just as much, with only ourselves to follow.The obstacles that we face test our faith and tease us with hope that soonfades. It’s necessary, then, to examine the broken state we’ve created.Nonalignment has been a way of life for generations. (What greater symptom ofour plight than the doctrine of a random, cold, uncaring universe that Dawkinsand company promote?) The Vedic masters point to five obstacles that keep us outof alignment with God. The Sanskrit term for these obstacles is more dramatic:klesha, which literally means “poison.” The five poisons are• Ignorance (the inability to tell the real from the false)• Egoism (identifying with “me,” the individual self)• Attachment (clinging to certain things, the objects of desire)• Aversion (rejecting other things, the objects of revulsion)• Fear of deathThe first poison starts a chain reaction, we might say, leading to the last.Fear of death, the fifth klesha, is the end product on the assembly line ofignorance. Not many people are happy to be told that they’ve shaped their livesthrough ignorance; it sounds offensive. A more palatable way is to talk aboutfragmentation.How did you come to see yourself as a fragment? The first step wasforgetfulness. A rich man afflicted with amnesia forgets his bank account. Themoney is still there, but forgetfulness makes him impoverished. You and I lostthe memory of wholeness. We are still whole, but we’ve lost the advantage of it.The chain reaction has started.You forget that you are whole.You see yourself as “I,” an isolated, vulnerable fragment.“I” has desires that it clings to in order to feel safer.It also has things that feel threatening, which it pushes away.Despite its pursuit of desire, “I” knows that it will die one day, and thisknowledge makes it very afraid.The five poisons look bad, yet one thing gives hope: Once you extract the firstpoison—forgetting who you are—the chain reaction stops. This is an invaluablesecret. People waste years trying to improve the bits and pieces of their lives.Let’s say you look in the mirror one day and dislike the body you see. You wantto impress the opposite sex, so you resolve to exercise. Running on a treadmillstokes desire by leading to better fitness; it stokes revulsion by being boringand tiring. You pay for an expensive date, which stokes the desire to beconsidered a success, but knowing that you are compensating for your insecuritystokes revulsion. You have been poisoned by the kleshas of attachment andrevulsion. The result is that “I” feels conflicted, falls back on inertia, andwinds up feeling worse about itself because it has failed to get what itwanted—a better body. The whole process takes place in consciousness, asclinging, revulsion, desire, and ego clash in a confusing melee. But there wasnever any real hope in the first place. By trying to satisfy “I,” you weretrying to placate an illusion.The way out of this dilemma is to remember who you really are, which meansaligning yourself with what is real. Instead of asking “What would Jesus do?”which seems pretty imaginary, ask “What would my real self do?” That question ismore authentic and immediate.Your real self would take responsibility for the reflection that the universesends. Reality is a mirror that never lies.Your real self would focus on inner growth. It wants nothing more than to reachits full potential.Your real self wouldn’t project blame and judgment on others.Your real self wouldn’t act on impulse. It relies on self-reflection. It makesdecisions in a state of calm, away from the chaos.You might grumble that you still see a flabby body in the mirror.Actually not, because once you inhabit your real self, judgment ends; focusingon externals ends; you are no longer motivated by insecurity, which traps peopleon the endless treadmill of self-improvement. This is just a broad outline, butit’s enough to show you that “I” has a very different agenda from your realself.God should be a way of life that you can rely upon as securely as you rely upongrocery stores, a monthly paycheck, and your insurance policy. What would be thepoint of an unreliable God? The devout French writer Simone Weil put it thisway: “In what concerns divine things, belief is not appropriate. Only certaintywill do. Anything less than certainty is unworthy of God.” I totally agree, butwe need a process that arrives at certainty. Let’s set aside absoluteanswers—they leave no middle ground, no evolution, and no chance to correct yourmistakes. Unbending certainty is the position taken by atheists at one extremeand fundamentalists at the other. For the rest of us, certainty grows from innerexperience, and this unfoldment takes time. Meanwhile, we have a whole life tolive, and we must embrace our uncertainty. It’s okay to be wobbly as long as youare still heading down the right road.THE TOUGHEST QUESTIONNo one has really been left behind. As a child, I didn’t know this. I marveledat the miracles that Jesus performed in the New Testament—my early schoolingtook place under Christian Brothers, mostly Irish missionaries who ran the bestschools in India. But Jesus’s miracles weren’t anything I’d ever see. Walking onwater has gone away. A process of disenchantment began, and it was easy for meto slide from disenchantment to disillusionment, then on to amnesia, forgettingthat my childhood ideals ever existed. The best I could do was adapt to a worlddevoid of God. If he would not intervene in the world’s evils, I would. I thinkmany doctors follow this path in their own way. What I didn’t see was that theentire slide perfectly matched the five kleshas.If you find yourself fighting the world’s many evils, you are immersed in them.The system of evil has claimed you. It sounds shocking, but if you believe inevil, you have forgotten who you really are. I thought helping sick people wouldimprove one small corner of the world. From a wider perspective, though, I wasdoing something quite different. I was keeping an illusion going. Every time youfight evil, you are reinforcing the system of evil, which would shrink awayunless people paid attention to it.Krishnamurti was one of the frankest teachers on this point, regardless of howit baffled people or hurt their feelings. In one of his journals, he recounts anincident in India when a kindly, well-dressed woman came asking for acontribution to her cause, the prevention of cruelty to animals.“What’s the reason for this cause?” Krishnamurti asked.“Animals are terribly mistreated in this country,” the woman said. “I know thatyou teach Ahimsa, reverence for life. Surely this means being kind to animals.”“I meant, why is this your cause? What’s your reason for taking it up?”Krishnamurti replied.The woman was taken aback. “I feel how much these poor creatures suffer.”“Then it’s your own distress you want to alleviate,” said Krishnamurti. “Thereis a way. Look deep into yourself. Where is the seed of violence? If animals arebeing mistreated, it is because we don’t take responsibility for our ownviolence. The seed is nowhere else but in you.”The wider perspective can be very painful. It rips away the ego’s pride in beingright and good. Krishnamurti doesn’t recount whether he made a contribution ornot. (He probably did, being a supporter of good causes.) His aim was to exposethe root of evil itself, because that is the only way to end it once and forall. The same applies to any particular evil one can name. Imagine that apsychic reads your mind and tells you, “Your notion of true evil is child abuse,domestic violence, religious hatred, and a helpless person dying in horriblepain from cancer.” You might agree with this list—surely most people would—andyet it implies no solution. You can give to good causes that help victims ofchild abuse and support harsher laws against domestic violence. You can praythat you don’t die in agony from incurable cancer. But these acts only skirt thequestion; they don’t get at evil itself.The question of evil is the toughest we can ask and the greatest challenge toGod. Why does evil exist? Why doesn’t God intervene? If the evils we deplore insociety are symptoms of cosmic evil, then hope vanishes. The entire spiritualenterprise collapses, as it did for countless people after the Gulag, theHolocaust, and the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Although carriedout by human beings, these horrors felt satanic. They erased any optimism thatgood could triumph over evil. The ultimate reason to despair, as many saw it,was that the perpetrators who perform the most evil acts in modern historythought of themselves as moral and their victims as the actual bad people.If we can answer the toughest question, the whole trend reverses. Once evil isexposed as an illusion, reality has a chance to convince us. Love can proveitself more powerful than fear. The greatest of spiritual ideals, a world freeof evil, will begin to actualize. On the other hand, if evil cannot be defeated,it will doom the spiritual path itself.“DO YOU WANT EVERYTHING TO BE GOOD?”If you are spiritual, does that provide a safeguard against the heinous crimesperpetrated on humanity? We can’t begin at such an extreme with questions aboutcosmic evil and that dark, seductive creature Satan. Instead, we have a moremodest way to get at the question of evil. Start with a personal question:“Would you accept a world that contained no badness at all? Do you wanteverything to be good?”Your immediate answer might be yes. For instance, pain is the body’s idea ofevil, and a world without physical pain sounds desirable. But a handful ofpatients worldwide have a rare condition (traced to two mutations in the SCN9Agene) that prevents them from feeling any pain. Justin Heckert, a journalist whowas reporting on a thirteen-year-old girl living with this anomaly, writes that:She really has a lot less fear and regard for her body than other girls her age,anyone her age, anyone at all, really. She was playing air hockey with hersister so crazily I thought she might hurt herself, or hurt her sister. Shethrew half of her body onto the table and was trying to smash the puck towardthe little goal as hard as she could. Her parents were mortified.But Heckert quickly lost his envy of a child who felt no pain, accepting insteadwhat her doctor said: “Pain is a gift that she doesn’t have.” In grade school amonitor followed her constantly to make sure she wasn’t injured; after everyrecess it was necessary to check her eyes in case grit had gotten in. At home,her parents “got rid of all their furniture with sharp corners. They laid downthe softest carpet they could find. They didn’t let [their daughter]roller-skate. They didn’t let her ride a bicycle. They wrapped her arms inlayers of gauze to keep her from rubbing them raw. They used a baby monitor inher bedroom to listen for grinding teeth.”Pain is a gift, once you realize the consequences of doing without it. Fireburns the skin, but it also cooks food. Then what about violence? A worldwithout crime and war seems completely desirable, but surgery is a form ofcontrolled violence. The body is (carefully) torn open, exposing it to manyrisks. A healthy ecosystem depends on one species eating another, which entailsviolence. Make all animals vegetarians, and in the absence of predators, nothingwould stop insects from filling the world; they already outweigh all mammalsmany times over.And what about mental suffering, which is entangled with shame, guilt, fear, andanger? Two angry factions in a civil war wind up killing each other and manyinnocent bystanders. On the face of it, anger has led to great evil. But thecombatants don’t stop, because their desire for vengeance makes them acceptanger as justified and even righteous. Civil wars are driven bydesires—defending your home, hatred of “the other,” racial and religiousintolerance—that are just as tied to anger as revenge. War glorifies anger,masking the suffering that it brings. Caught up in a righteous cause, a soldiermight brush aside his own suffering, but once the war is over, new forms ofmental suffering emerge, such as guilt and the complex symptoms ofpost-traumatic stress disorder.Mental suffering can’t be summarized in a few paragraphs. Let’s stick to ouroriginal line of questioning: “Do you want everything to be good? Is a painlessworld desirable?” If you define mental pain as depression, anxiety,schizophrenia, and other mental disorders, no one wants them to exist. But theneed for pain applies to the mental world, too. Fear keeps you from putting yourhand in the fire a second time. Guilt teaches children not to steal from thecookie jar even when their mothers aren’t watching. Mental pain is useful in allkinds of ways when it isn’t excessive.What we call evil is often something we can’t do without and don’t want to.Human beings thrive on contrast. Without pain there can be no pleasure, only abland state of nonstimulation. (Hence the natural suspicion that young childrenshow when they are told about heaven—it sounds boring to sit on clouds and playharps for eternity.) Are we designed to be good in the first place? Apparentlyso. Researchers into infant behavior have found that babies as young as fourmonths old will try to pick up an object that their mothers dropped and hand itback.But the impulse to goodness is mixed in with contrary impulses. Otherresearchers have found that young children learn to act the way their parentstell them to; they know what “be good” means in terms of getting approval athome. But when left alone without an adult in preschool, the same child maysuddenly turn from Jekyll to Hyde, snatching toys from other children andshowing no remorse when their victims cry. Still, these intriguing findingsdon’t solve the problem of evil itself. For that, we must go deeper.In duality, everything inevitably has its opposite. Good cannot be separatedfrom evil, just as light cannot be separated from darkness. They areinseparable, one of the basic teachings in Buddhism. Every golden age inmythology has led to a fall. Paradise always has a flaw, if not a serpent in thegarden, because our divided nature demands it. Should God be held responsiblefor our predicament? Or is evil entirely a product of human nature?SATAN AND THE SHADOWIt’s hard for God to escape responsibility for evil. You can do it byfiat—simply declaring that God is all goodness. Many believers do just that,assigning the evil part of creation to a cosmic demon, who was given the nameSatan in Hebrew, meaning “the adversary.” Regardless of whether this arch-demonis a fallen angel, once you assign evil to Satan—leaving aside the existence ofhell, the kingdom that he rules—God gets demoted. An omnipotent God wouldn’thave an enemy who holds sway over us almost as powerfully as God himself. Aloving God wouldn’t let the Devil hurt us all the time. An omniscient God wouldknow when the Devil is going to strike and would intervene, or at the very leastgive us advance warning. Once God loses his monopoly over love, power, andwisdom, trouble is afoot.To allow God to be God in all his glory, religion shifted the blame for evil. Itbecame a human problem, tied in with temptation and sin. Adam and Eve had everyother food laid out before them, but they perversely ate the apple. Perversityhas struck with us. So God permits evil to exist because we deserve it. We runloose with desire; our aggression makes us attack and kill one another. We erectmoral schemes only to defy them at will, act like hypocrites, and turn to crimeand rebellion.Shifting the blame resulted in a huge burden, but most people are willing tocarry it. Some evils arise beyond our control, such as hurricanes and othernatural disasters. Others are the product of genes, like cancer, but even hereblame persists. Poor lifestyle choices are connected to many cancers, and evenif they weren’t, patients anxiously ask themselves, “Did I cause my disease?” Asfor natural disasters, we’ve all become aware of the human contribution toglobal warming and the erratic weather it has produced.The two schemes, cosmic evil and human evil, merge in the concept of the shadow,which manages to be universal and human at the same time. No one ever doubtedthat darkness lurks in the human heart. But modern psychology wanted asystematic, rational way to understand this darkness; the early Swisspsychoanalyst C. G. Jung provided it when he described a force in theunconscious he named “the shadow.” To the domain of the shadow, Jung consignedguilt, shame, anger, and anxiety. But the shadow is more than a warehouse fornegative impulses. Being conscious, it looks at the world through its owndistorted lens, and when it does, anger and fear seem justified. The shadowmakes us want to kill our enemies and feel good about it, or at least justified.The shadow sends messages to the rest of the psyche that are no doubt powerful,contradicting the desire for goodness, well-being, and happiness. It persuadesus that anger, which feels good at the time, is good. Never mind the aftermath.To use Jung’s phrase, the shadow creates “the fog of illusion” that surroundseveryone. Since there is no escape from it, the shadow is universal. I oncedebated a staunch Jungian who argued that peace can never be achieved becauseMars, the archetype of war, resides permanently in our psyches. (So does sex, Iargued back, but people don’t run around in a state of erotic mania. Primitivedrives leave room for choice, the domain of the higher brain.) In the depths ofthe unconscious, Satan and the shadow join hands. Each is equally invisible,equally a projection of the mind.If cosmic evil holds such sway that even God permits it to exist, what hope dowe have of undoing it? This question was tested in the Book of Job, which somescholarly accounts say was the last part of the Hebrew Bible to be written, butthe same themes are found in more ancient texts from Sumer and Egypt (givingsupport to Jung’s notion that mythology from all cultures can be traced to thesame archetypal roots). In the Book of Job, God and Satan wager over the soul ofa man in the land of Uz. God’s adversary claims that he can tempt any man torenounce God, even the most righteous. God claims that Job, being of utmostrighteousness, cannot be swayed. He gives Satan a free hand to torment Job, theonly restriction being that he cannot kill him.The wager intrigues any reader the first time he encounters the story. What kindof torture will Satan inflict? Will Job hold out or give in? The makings of anexciting morality play are all there. As it turns out, the afflictions of Jobcover almost every form of human suffering. He loses everything that was good inhis life—money, crops, wife, and children. His body is covered with seepingsores. The infamous three friends appear to tell Job why God has done thesehorrible things to him. Their basic argument is that he deserves everything thathas befallen him. As their taunts and blame increase, the setup makes ussympathize more with the victim. No convincing reason is given for why a goodman should suffer so much. There couldn’t be a reason, in fact, since Job andhis friends have no clue that God and Satan are using him as a pawn in a cosmicbet.If you are literal-minded, the bet was cruel to begin with. A God who uses soulslike poker chips isn’t worth worshiping. Besides, if God can keep Satan fromkilling Job, he should be able to keep Satan from hurting him in any way shortof death. True goodness doesn’t say, “Okay, you can be evil, only don’t go toofar.”So Job’s tale has to be read as an allegory. The cosmic wager stands for themystery of evil, which descends upon our lives without reason, and when it does,our suffering feels undeserved. Clearly, despite the three friends accusing himof hypocrisy and hidden sin, Job doesn’t deserve his afflictions. The allegoryneeds a moral, and the Book of Job has one that is quite unconvincing.A young servant named Elihu has been listening to the argument between Job andhis friends with increasing dismay. Jumping to his feet, he startles everyone byspeaking in a holy voice, as God’s stand-in. Both sides are wrong, Elihudeclares. The three friends are wrong to claim that Job has a hidden flaw thatGod is punishing. Job is wrong to believe that his righteous life trumps God’spower. God can do what he wants, when he wants, to whomever he wants. His waysdo not have to be justified to man.The three friends flee, their hypocrisy and disloyalty exposed. Job’s reactionisn’t clear, but a happy ending is tacked on (probably by later scribes; thewhole framework of a cosmic wager also seems to be a late addition). He ishealed, and his wealth is restored. A new wife gives birth to sons to replacethose who died. Righteousness has prevailed. Job never renounced God, and havingwon the wager, God rewards his favored child. But the Job who emerges safe andsound from his horrendous trials isn’t the same Job as before. Addressing God,he says, “I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeththee. Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes” (Job 42:5–6).He has become humble and repentant—a default position frequently reinforced inthe Hebrew Bible—but this seems strange. Job wasn’t proud or boastful to beginwith. He was the model devotee of God. The allegory is telling us somethingdeeper. Before his trials, Job thought he understood God “by the hearing of theear”—sermons, the reading of the Torah, temple rituals, the teachings of elderrabbis. All of this pointed in the wrong direction. God isn’t the same as talkabout God. When Job declares that he abhors himself, he is referring to thearrogant ego, which would demote God to just another thing to be figured out andmanaged.For me, this is a profound story about the kleshas, the poisons that distortreality. Job, for all his goodness, is attached to his own righteousness. He hasturned his existence into a regimen dictated by scripture and the law. Such alife is unreal when there is no contact with the transcendent world. Rules aboutGod are like rules about driving a car. They can prevent mishaps and keepeveryone safer, but passing a DMV exam isn’t the same as driving down thehighway. Reality can’t be defined by rules and laws. It is dynamic, unbounded,creative, all-embracing, and eternal.The allegory of Job applies to the bad things in our lives. Pain and sufferingweaken faith; God gets deposed with every new atrocity on the evening news. Butwhat topples is only an image. God himself isn’t even touched by bad things;afflictions are part of the illusion. In a whimsical moment, when I came acrossa Twitter argument over whether heaven is real, I tweeted, “Material existenceis an illusion. Heaven is an upgrade of the illusion.” That’s why Satan, asJob’s tormentor, is given free rein in the world of appearances, while God, whoabides in the transcendent, doesn’t interfere. God’s role isn’t to upgrade theillusion but to lead us out of it.EVIL IN A VACUUMEven though we might dissect evil into a thousand parts, we don’t need to.Escaping evil is far more important than explaining it. Find your true self, andyou will no longer want to participate in the illusion. You will create apersonal reality that isn’t tied to the play of opposites. At that point, Job’slesson becomes abundantly clear. Don’t be attached to your own goodness orsomeone else’s badness. Find out your real relationship to God, and base yourlife on that.Your real relationship with God emerges by eliminating everything that led to afalse relationship.YOU AND GODWHEN THE RELATIONSHIP GOES BADYou lose your connection to God whenever youFear divine punishmentFeel burdened by God’s demandsReduce God to a set of dos and don’tsDefend God with anger or violenceShirk responsibility by saying that something is God’s willDespair that God has turned against youHope to be so good that God can’t help but love youKeep guilty and shameful secretsLive as if God is secondary to the “real” worldTreat other people as if God loves them less or not at allThese ingredients don’t just sour your relationship with God; they’d doom anyrelationship between you and another person. Living in fear, keeping secrets,using anger and violence—no positive relationship can grow under thoseconditions, even if it manages to limp along. When applied to your relationshipto God, the effect is more disastrous. Evil is created in the misplaced desireto make ourselves worthy of God. Holy wars are the most obvious example, butguilt, shame, and anger are direct results of an either/or trap that isinescapable: either you aren’t good enough for God, or no matter how good youare, God doesn’t care. Suffering is rooted in a false relationship to God, andwhen we suffer, we lash out at ourselves and others. When Emerson wrote thatevil is the absence of good, he didn’t satisfy those who believe in Satan, anactive agent for evil. But what Emerson meant turns on the word privation orlack.Evil is merely privative, not absolute: it is like cold, which is the privationof heat. All evil is so much death or nonentity … Benevolence is absolute andreal.This remark echoes the world’s wisdom traditions, which say that evil is like avacuum, the emptiness of illusion. Fill the vacuum with reality, and evilvanishes. I’m not talking about a magic trick that makes genocide, war crimes,and oppression go away overnight. Human nature does its worst when it finds noway to change. But you will undergo an inner transformation, and as you do, thelabels of good and evil won’t be as sticky. The fullness of God will steadilyfill the vacuum. You are creeping out of the illusion, quietly and withoutflashiness.Let me give a sense of the stages that mark this transformation.FADING IN THE LIGHTAS CONSCIOUSNESS GROWS, EVIL SHRINKSStage 1: FearWhen consciousness is dominated by fear and insecurity, evil is everywhere. Itcomes in physical threats to our bodies, the struggle to provide food andshelter, and natural disasters that no one can prevent. God offers noprotection. The only protection is self-defense.Stage 2: EgoEgo brings the building of a strong self. “I” can stand up to challenges. Livinga good life, obeying the rules, and trusting that God is fair will keep badthings at bay. In a world of risk and reward overseen by God, “I” will beblessed for my goodness as long as I avoid the pitfalls of sin.Stage 3: Social orderIndividual consciousness expands to include others. The group bonds together forthe common good. A system of laws protects people from crime and otherwrongdoing, enforced by the police. The greatest bond is a shared version ofGod. Faith sustains the belief that evil can never defeat God’s love for hischildren.Stage 4: Empathy and understandingConsciousness expands to embrace the world “in here.” One sees that other peoplehave their own motives and beliefs, just as you do. They share your feelings, asyou share theirs. It becomes possible to understand why people behave as theydo. The seed of evil isn’t just inside “bad people” but in everyone. God, whounderstands everyone, is forgiving. He embraces the wrongdoer and the righteousalike.Stage 5: Self-discoveryConsciousness expands to ask why. Why do we act the way we do? What are theroots of good and bad in human life? There is no longer pure evil or cosmicevil. The responsibility lies squarely on us. By trusting in reason and insight,we can explore our nature and improve it. God is clarity, the light of reason,no longer judging us. He wants us to live in the light.Stage 6: CompassionConsciousness expands to love humanity. The wall between right and wrong hascrumbled. All people are valued no matter how they behave. God looks down on hischildren with love. Knowing that love is eternal, people can offer compassion,treating others as God would treat them.Stage 7: BeingConsciousness expands beyond duality. The play of good and evil is allowed to bewhat it is. One’s allegiance has shifted elsewhere. Having sensed thetranscendent world, one enters it and lives there. God is One. Merging with purebeing, a person lives in a state of grace, which holds the ultimate power forovercoming evil.As a person passes through these seven stages, evil changes. It moves from beingan overwhelming threat to being a minor threat and then no threat at all. Whenyou try to figure out why evil exists, you may decide that the source is acosmic demon, a flaw in human nature, or a shadowy domain that has its ownagenda. But the bottom line is the same. Evil is created. You can fight as hardagainst it as you want. In the end, the solution doesn’t exist on the level ofthe created. Emerson intuited this, I think, when he said that evil istemporary. Anything that depends on human perception can’t be eternal. The onlyeternal state is Being, the simplest state of existence. Plant your feet there;it is the only safe haven, where evil has no meaning.THE POWER OF BEINGAs a boy in India, I imbibed faith from my mother, who was very devout. I stoodbeside her every day as she lit incense and prayed before the household altar.Afternoons were frequently filled with the sounds of kirtan, group singing ofdevotional songs that were fervent and enchanting.In the still of the nightFrom the darkness comes a light.And I know in my heart it is you.When the fire in my soulBurns with longing for the goal.Then I know in my heart it is you.It didn’t stay with me. Faith leaked away with each passing year. I wasfortunate, stranded in Boston as a young doctor drinking after hours so that Iwould be accepted by the crowd, smoking to relieve stress, and driving myself tosucceed. Nonetheless I felt the vacuum that exists when fullness is absent. Ihad witnessed lung cancer patients crossing the street as soon as they left mycare, rushing to buy a pack of cigarettes at the corner convenience store. I hadseen the look of abject fear in dying patients who were deprived of solace. Thefaith my mother introduced to me could have turned to cynicism or despair.Looking back to childhood didn’t change my life. I sensed my own emptiness andwanted to do something about it. Here a piece of good fortune came my way. Thereligion I had been taught didn’t focus on sin, guilt, temptation, or the Devil.It makes no promise of a heavenly reward or punishment in hell. It helps to havethat old lumber cleared away. The secret to finding God, it taught, is to fillyourself up with Being (capitalized to denote pure, absolute being). Once you dothat, you know that you are nothing but Being, and in that knowledge comes totalawakening. You look around and behold light in all directions.Wherever you start from, waking up is the destination. Evil is the most powerfulof illusions, supported by fear, the most powerful of negative emotions.Whenever you are in the grip of fear, a panicked voice inside screams, “Getaway! Run! You’re about to die.” Fear constricts the mind. It freezes you up andblots out everything else. By contrast, what can Being do? Its voice is silent.It makes no demands. It doesn’t tell you to choose A over B, because Being isbeyond duality. People bitterly accuse God for not intervening in the world, yetBeing has no other choice. It underlies everything equally—in that regard Hamletwas wrong. “To be or not to be” isn’t a real choice. To be is inescapable. SoBeing is left to solve all problems without speaking, acting, changing, orinterfering. Success doesn’t look very probable, does it?In the famous Beatles song, the advice to “let it be” is called “words ofwisdom.” I agree—nothing is wiser, because when Being becomes human, it isn’t apassive state. It’s a mode of living, one that most people have never tried.This book has outlined what this mode of living calls for, from showinggenerosity of spirit and expressing love to finding inner silence and followingyour own guidance.What changed my life had nothing to do, in the end, with who I was as a person.The labels I attached to myself—Indian physician, a success, well-loved,self-reliant, and so on—were positive. Like heaven, the illusion I lived in camewith upgrades. None of that actually mattered. What mattered was that I shiftedinto a new mode of living, beginning with an empty feeling inside and workingfrom there to fill the vacuum. Saints and angels didn’t light the way. Every dayI did what I always did, getting up before dawn, making hospital rounds, andseeing a stream of patients in my private practice.The difference was that I aligned myself with my Being. The verb dhar, “touphold,” leads to a way of life that the universe upholds, called dharma.Foreign words aren’t better than common everyday words. Get to know yourself,and you will be in your dharma. Dharma comes down to one crucial thing: trustingBeing to give you a course correction when you need it. Being provides hintsabout a higher reality. You feel subtly wrong when you veer into ego andselfishness. Being speaks silently, but existence is tilted in its favor. A fewhidden advantages are tucked away in our lives.Moving forward is favored over inertia.Once it begins, evolution accelerates its pace.Consciousness naturally expands.The more you know yourself, the better your life becomes.Positive intentions are supported more than negative intentions.Individual consciousness is connected to God consciousness.These advantages are subtle, but they endow Being with enormous power. When youthink with love about your children, the thought is also occurring in God’smind—they both have the power to bless. If you are on your way to the movies andstop to help a traveler stranded in the snow, your impulse is the same as theimpulse of salvation. The toughest questions will never stop plaguing the mind.God is the place where the mind finds an answer beyond thought. When you seethis, no one in the world is an enemy, only a fellow traveler. The door to Beingis open to everyone, leaving evil behind at the threshold."},{"pageContent":"EPILOGUE: GOD AT A GLANCEApproval is sweet. Anyone who wants it should avoid writing about God. No onewill completely agree with you. (In a multicultural world, that’s good.) Youwon’t get the satisfaction of preaching to the choir—in most churches, the choirstalls are growing empty and cold. In a single week in 2013, the New York Timesran two op-ed pieces that denied the possibility of spiritual aspirations. Onewas titled “The Blessings of Atheism”; the other, “The Myth of Universal Love.”They appeared right after Christmas. Perhaps that was the point. Being of goodcheer left a bitter taste. God is a divider, not a uniter.I’ve tried to present God without demanding an either/or choice. If the BhagavadGita is right to say, “All roads lead to me,” meaning God, the road of nonbeliefcan’t be judged against. I don’t go to church or temple myself. The writer of“The Blessings of Atheism” decries people like me, who think of themselves as“spiritual but not religious.” With undisguised disdain, she continues with thisphrase, “as translated from the psychobabble, can mean just about anything—thatthe speaker is an atheist who fears social disapproval or a fence-sitter whowants the theoretical benefits of faith … without the obligations of actuallypracticing a religion.”Or it can mean something genuine. Atheism makes a mistake when it equatesreligious practice with spirituality. The deeper I got into this book, theclearer it became that almost anything one can say about God implies some kindof mistake. No one has a monopoly on the truth. That doesn’t mean that truthdoesn’t exist. In the same way, no matter how badly religions act, it doesn’tprove that God doesn’t exist. So many heated emotions swirl around God that Itook the tack of meeting atheists on their own ground. Dawkins and company own alabel maker that stamps their camp with approving words like rational,scientific, sane, courageous, and logical. When the label maker is pointed atanyone who believes in God, it spits out demeaning words—irrational,superstitious, conformist, illogical, and crazy.Belief deserves its share of the good labels, so I apply sanity, reason, andlogic to support the reality of God. Faith can’t save itself. Stranded in asecular world, it will fall on deaf ears unless we talk in secular terms. In anideal world, both sides would obey the injunction in the Old Testament to “bestill and know that I am God.” In our silence, we could take time to read Rumi,Kabir, and Tagore. God is in the thrill of inspired verse, as in this couplet:Listen, my heart, to the whispering of the world.That is how it makes love to you.That’s Tagore, and he doesn’t have to mention God for you to feel that he isspiritual.I grew tired of the roadwhen it took me here and there.I married it in lovewhen it took me Everywhere.Tagore again, just as spiritual, just as free of religiosity. A book that speaksentirely from the heart would be the next best thing to silence. When you havewritten a sentence that you’re sure will convince a skeptic, you set yourself upfor a fall. I’ve wept over verses that make another person snicker or lookbored.Which leaves the arena of ideas, where reason, sanity, and logic must beapplied. With that in mind, I’ll end by offering a batch of key ideas, thosethat must be addressed by both sides. Each idea points to a bigger discussion inthe book. On their own, they are like telegrams, a few phrases to get themessage across. I’ve divided the batch into three sections that correspond tothe major subjects the text has covered: militant atheism, faith, and God. In mynew enthusiasm for social media, I’ve tweeted these ideas, so I can attest thatthey generate heat, one way or another. What they can do here is better, Ithink. You have an opportunity to see where your beliefs have wound up.Even your most cherished beliefs may have shifted—or not. We are often the worstjudges of what is going on in our inner world. Ideas mostly play on the surfaceof the mind. It’s better to rely on a poetic image about God. He is like a faintperfume detected when you are drowsing off at night. You hardly know whatdelicious scent awakens you, but for a while it’s hard to go back to sleepagain.MILITANT ATHEISMTEN FLAWS IN THE DAWKINS DELUSION 1. His atheism attacks a Sunday school version of God as if there were noother. It lumps any kind of religious belief in with the excesses of extremefanatics. 2. His atheism rests on the belief that the universe has no intelligentsource. Yet a random universe is the least likely explanation for howintelligent life came about. 3. His atheism equates reality with the material world, as perceived by thefive senses. This fails to account for the quantum revolution, which opened upreality far beyond the visible world. 4. His atheism traces all events back to inflexible laws of nature but cannotexplain why the laws of nature exist or where they came from. 5. His atheism uses evolution as an argument against an intelligent sourcefor life, even though survival of the fittest cannot explain the creation oflife. 6. His atheism positions itself as rational but cannot explain the source ofrationality. How does random brain activity produce order and logic? 7. His atheism claims that biology is the basis of consciousness withoutoffering a theory for how molecules learned to think. 8. His atheism views the brain in terms of rigid cause-and-effect. Allthought and behavior is deterministic. He gives no explanation for free will,creativity, or insight. 9. His atheism denies the existence of the self, considering it an illusioncreated by the brain. Yet neuroscience has never found a location for “I”anywhere in the brain.10. His atheism cannot explain how the illusory self arrives at self-knowledge.FAITHTEN REASONS WHY FAITH IS WORTHWHILE 1. Faith is not blind belief but a knowing that comes from experience. 2. Faith is the willingness to step into the unknown. 3. Faith expresses wonder before the mystery of existence. 4. Faith comes from inner silence and what it reveals. 5. Faith brings trust in the inner world of insight, intuition, andimagination. 6. Faith brings a person closer to the source of creation. 7. Faith introduces the true self, which is beyond ego. 8. Faith connects the world “in here” with the world “out there.” 9. Faith abolishes the divide between natural and supernatural.10. Faith in your deepest self is faith in God.GODTEN IDEAS THAT GIVE GOD A FUTURE 1. God is the intelligence that conceives, governs, constructs, and becomesthe universe. 2. God is not a mythical person—he is Being itself. 3. God is uncreated. The universe cannot reveal God, since everything thatexists is created. 4. God exists as a field of all possibilities. 5. God is pure consciousness, the source of all thoughts, feelings, andsensations. 6. God transcends all opposites, including good and evil, which arise in thefield of duality. 7. God is One but diversifies into the many—he makes possible the observer,the observed, and the process of observation. 8. God is pure bliss, the source of every human joy. 9. God is the self of the universe.10. There is only God. The universe is God made manifest."},{"pageContent":"ACKNOWLEDGMENTSAnew book expresses itself as it grows, sometimes more from the brain than theheart, sometimes the reverse. First, I am deeply indebted to the many eminentscientists in the physical and biological sciences I have been dialoguing withover the last few years. They have broadened and strengthened my understandingin countless ways. This book on God grew from the need to make spiritualitycredible for modern people, walking them back from the brink of unbelief. I’mvery grateful for the opportunity to fulfill this need, and to the people whoworked with such dedication to make it happen.The team at Harmony and Crown has stood by me and believed in my work throughmany changes in the publishing world. Tina Constable (publisher at Crown), DianaBaroni, Meredith McGinnis, Amanda O’Connor, Michael Nagin, Patricia Shaw, andTammy Blake are the kind of people we writers cannot do without, and I ferventlyhope the book world realizes that for decades to come.There are certain projects where the editor’s contributions are especiallycrucial. This book was one of them, and my editor Gary Jansen altered tone,direction, and wording with astute judgment every step of the way—thank you.
