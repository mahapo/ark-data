DOTY, M.D., Professor of Neurosurgery, Founder and Director, Centerfor Compassion and Altruism Research and Education (CCARE), Stanford Instituteof Neuro-innovation and Translational Neuroscience, Stanford University Schoolof Medicine“Astrophysicist Sir James Jeans wrote: ‘The Universe begins to look more like agreat thought than like a great machine.’ This is the essence of Chopra’s view:that a great consciousness—which we share—is the basis of the Universe and allreality. From Mlodinow’s perspective it is unimaginable that consciousness couldbe anything more than brain chemistry at work and certainly not somethingcapable of creating a universe. The book presents a lively and articulate debateon this most important human question: Are we simply complex biological machinesdestined for oblivion at death, or are we immortal spiritual beings temporarilyexperiencing reality through physical bodies?”—BERNARD HAISCH, astrophysicist“Deepak Chopra and Leonard Mlodinow argue convincingly for their particularworldviews. However, reading this book convinces me they should call a truce:science and spirituality are two sides of a quantum coin.”—STUART HAMEROFF, M.D., Professor, Anesthesiology and Psychology; Director,Center for Consciousness Studies, The University of Arizona, Tucson“Finally! The beginning of a dialogue in the true spirit of open-ended sciencethat should be inclusive of all phenomena including spirituality.Congratulations to Chopra and Mlodinow for the breakthrough.”—AMIT GOSWAMI, quantum physicist and author of The Self-Aware Universe and HowQuantum Activism Can Save Civilization“Is consciousness an aspect of nature that had no precursor prior to theappearance of life, or is it a feature of nature that was in some form alwayspresent? This question is debated in this lively, informative, and entertainingbook coauthored by two skilled writers. Chopra argues for the pervasiveness ofconsciousness, while Mlodinow argues for emergence of everything from the purelyphysical, in the absence of adequate scientific evidence to the contrary. Thisbook is a good read even if, and particularly if, you already have a fixedopinion on the matter.”—DR. HENRY P.

To Deepak Chopra, the truth exists inconsciousness. The time has come for humanity to open its mind to all levels ofreality.”—LOTHAR SCHÄFER, Distinguished Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry,University of Arkansas“Deepak Chopra did an excellent job explaining why the all-embracing quantumfield suggests a dynamic, alive cosmos.

Each of us has one.We believe that our worldview expresses reality. The Native Americans of theSouthwest traveled hundreds of miles to hunt buffalo but never ate fish fromtheir local streams. In their worldview, it was real that fish were the spiritsof departed ancestors. In the Old Testament it was real that animal sacrificesappeased God’s wrath; to the everyday Roman it was real that the future could beforetold in the entrails of a chicken. To the ancient Greeks it was real that amoral individual could keep slaves and that there existed many gods, of love andbeauty, war, the underworld, the hunt, the harvest, the sea.What happens, then, when two worldviews clash? In 399 BCE three Atheniancitizens accused Socrates of refusing to recognize the traditional gods andintroducing new divinities instead (he was also accused of corrupting theiryouth). The penalty for this clash of worldviews, or gods, was death. During histrial Socrates refused to back down or to flee from a certain verdict of guilty.According to Plato, he said, “So long as I draw breath and have my faculties, Ishall never stop practicing philosophy.” Unfortunately, in many parts of theworld today, a clash of worldviews is still met with violence and death.This book is about a clash of worldviews, but no blows were exchanged. The bookcame about when two strangers met at a televised debate on “the future of God.”The setting was an auditorium at the California Institute of Technology, and theaudience was composed of many scientists and students, but also of laypeople,including Deepak’s fans from the surrounding community. Each of them brought hisor her own personal beliefs—no doubt some of them were religious—but they alsobrought their own worldview, which runs much deeper than belief.In the Caltech debate Deepak served as the defender of a worldview broadly knownas spiritual. Since the ideas of physics became an issue, during thequestion-and-answer period Deepak asked, “Is there a physicist in the house?”Neither Leonard nor anyone else answered. But after the debate, the moderator,who recognized Leonard as a physicist, pulled him out of the audience to askDeepak a question. Leonard instead offered to teach him about quantum physics.Deepak accepted—to a mixture of laughter and applause—and as we started tocommunicate, we found ourselves strongly disagreeing about our worldviews.Realizing the depth of our clash, we decided to have it out in this book.Science has set humanity on a path to unravel the secrets of nature, harnessnatural forces, and develop new technologies, using reason and observationinstead of emotional bias as a tool for uncovering the truth of things.Spirituality looks toward an invisible, transcendent realm discovered within theself. Science explores the world as it is offered to the five senses and thebrain, while spirituality considers the universe to be purposeful and imbuedwith meaning. In Deepak’s view, the great challenge for spirituality is to offersomething that science cannot provide—in particular, answers that lie in therealm of consciousness.Which worldview is right? Does science describe the universe, or do ancientteachings like meditation unravel mysteries that are beyond the worldview ofscience? To find out, this book explores the clash of worldviews on threelevels: the cosmos, or physical universe; life; and the human brain. Finally, wealso explore the ultimate mystery, God. In “Cosmos” we argue about where theuniverse came from, its nature, and where it is going. In “Life” we debateevolution, genetics, and the origin of life. “Mind and Brain” addressesneuroscience and raises all the issues of mind and body. And “God” refers notonly to a presiding deity but also to the broader concept of a divine presencein our universe.This book covers eighteen topics in total, with essays from both authors. Eachof us told his side of the story, one topic at a time, but whoever came secondon any given topic did so with the other’s text in hand, feeling free to presenta rebuttal. Since rebuttals tend to persuade audiences, we tried to be as fairas possible about who got that advantage.Each of us believes deeply in the worldview he represents. We have writtenfiercely but respectfully to define the truth as we see it. No one can ignorethe question of how to perceive the world. The best we can do—writers andreaders alike—is to leap into the fray. What else could be more important?Deepak ChopraLeonard Mlodinowdy>"},{"pageContent":"PART ONE[../images/00009.jpeg]THE WARdy>"},{"pageContent":"[../images/00009.jpeg]PERSPECTIVES"},{"pageContent":"THE SPIRITUAL PERSPECTIVE[../images/00010.jpeg]DEEPAKWho looks outside, dreams; who looks within, awakens.—CARL JUNGIf it is going to win the struggle for the future, spirituality must firstovercome a major disadvantage. In the popular imagination, science long agodiscredited religion. Facts replaced faith. Superstition was graduallyvanquished. That’s why Darwin’s explanation of man’s descent from lower primatesprevails over Genesis and why we look to the Big Bang as the source of thecosmos rather than to a creation myth populated by one or more gods.So it’s important to begin by saying that religion isn’t the same asspirituality—far from it. Even God isn’t the same as spirituality. Organizedreligion may have discredited itself, but spirituality has suffered no suchdefeat. Thousands of years ago, in cultures across the globe, inspired spiritualteachers such as the Buddha, Jesus, and Lao-tzu proposed profound views of life.They taught that a transcendent domain resides beyond the everyday world of painand struggle. Although the eye beholds rocks, mountains, trees, and sky, this isonly a veil drawn over a vast, mysterious, unseen reality. Beyond the reach ofthe five senses lies an invisible realm of infinite possibility, and the key tounfolding its potential is consciousness. Go within, the sages and seersdeclared, and you will find the true source of everything: your own awareness.It was this tremendous promise that religion failed to deliver on. The reasonsdon’t concern us here, because this is a book about the future. It’s enough tosay that if the kingdom of God is within, as Christ declared, if nirvana meansfreedom from all suffering, as the Buddha taught, and if knowledge of the cosmosis locked inside the human mind, as the ancient rishis, or sages, of Indiaproposed, we cannot look around today and say that those teachings bore fruit.Increasingly few people worship in the old ways around the world, and even astheir elders lament this decline, those who have walked away from religion nolonger even need an excuse. Science long ago showed us a brave new world thatrequires no faith in an invisible realm.The real issue is knowledge and how you attain it. Jesus and the Buddha had nodoubt that they were describing reality from a position of true knowledge. Aftermore than two thousand years, we think we know better.Science celebrates its triumphs, which are many, and excuses its catastrophes,which are also numerous—and growing. The atomic bomb delivered us into an age ofmass destruction that brings night terrors just to contemplate. The environmenthas been disastrously disrupted by emissions spewing from the machines thattechnology gives us to make life better. Yet supporters of science shrug offthese threats as either side effects or failures of social policy. Morality, weare told, isn’t the responsibility of science. But if you look deeper, sciencehas run into the same problem as religion. Religion lost sight of humilitybefore God, and science lost its sense of awe, increasingly seeing Nature as aforce to be opposed and conquered, its secrets stripped bare for the benefit ofhumankind. Now we are paying the price. When asked if Homo sapiens is in dangerof extinction, some scientists offer hope that within a few hundred years spacetravel will be advanced enough to let us abandon the planetary nest we arefouling. Off we go to spoil other worlds!We all know what’s at stake: the foreseeable future looms grimly over us. Thestandard solution for our present woes is all too familiar. Science will rescueus with new technology—for restoring the environment, replacing fossil fuels,curing AIDS and cancer, and ending the threat of famine. Name your malady andthere’s someone to tell you that a scientific solution is just around thecorner. But isn’t science promising to rescue us from itself? And why is that apromise we should trust? The worldview that triumphed over religion, and thatlooks upon life as essentially materialistic, has set us on a path that leads toa dead end. Literally.Even if we miraculously eliminated disastrous pollution and waste, cominggenerations will still have no model for the good life except the one that hasfailed us: endless consumption, exploitation of natural resources, and thediabolical creativity of warfare. As a young Chinese student bitterly commentedabout the West, “You ate the whole banquet. Now you give us coffee and dessert,but tell us to pay for the entire meal.”Religion cannot resolve this dilemma; it has had its chances already. Butspirituality can. We need to go back to the source of religion. That sourceisn’t God. It’s consciousness. The great teachers who lived millennia agooffered something more radical than belief in a higher power. They offered a wayof viewing reality that begins not with outside facts and a limited physicalexistence, but with inner wisdom and access to unbounded awareness. The irony isthat Jesus, the Buddha, and the other enlightened sages were scientists, too.They had a way of uncovering knowledge that runs exactly parallel to modernscience. First came a hypothesis, an idea that needed testing. Next cameexperimentation to see if the hypothesis was true. Finally came peer review,offering the new findings to other researchers and asking them to reproduce thesame breakthrough.The spiritual hypothesis that was put forward thousands of years ago has threeparts:1. There is an unseen reality that is the source of all visible things.2. This unseen reality is knowable through our own awareness.3. Intelligence, creativity, and organizing power are embedded in the cosmos.This trio of ideas is like the Platonic values in Greek philosophy, which tellus that love, truth, order, and reason shape human existence from a higherreality. The difference is that even more ancient philosophies, with roots goingback five thousand years, tell us that higher reality is with us right here andnow.In the following pages, as Leonard and I debate the great questions of humanexistence, my role is to offer spiritual answers—not as a priest or apractitioner of any particular faith, but as a researcher in consciousness. Thisruns the risk, I know, of alienating devout believers, the many millions ofpeople in every faith for whom God is very personal. But the world’s wisdomtraditions did not exclude a personal God (to be candid, I was not taught as achild to worship one, but my mother did, praying at a temple to Rama every dayof her life). At the same time, wisdom traditions all included an impersonal Godwho permeates every atom of the universe and every fiber of our being. Thisdistinction bothers those believers who want to cling to the one and only truefaith, whatever it may be for them. But an impersonal God doesn’t need to be athreat.Think of someone you love. Now think of love itself. The person you love puts aface on love, yet surely you know that love existed before this person was bornand will survive after they pass away. In that simple example lies thedifference between the personal and the impersonal God. As a believer you canput a face on God—that is a matter of your own private choice—but I hope you seethat if God is everywhere, the divine qualities of love, mercy, compassion,justice, and all the other attributes ascribed to God extend infinitelythroughout creation. Not surprisingly, this idea is a common thread in all majorreligions. Higher consciousness allowed the great sages, saints, and seers toattain a kind of knowledge that science feels threatened by but that iscompletely valid. Our common understanding of consciousness is too limited to dojustice here.If I asked you, “What are you conscious of right this minute?” you wouldprobably start by describing the room you’re in and the sights, sounds, andsmells surrounding you. On reflection you’d become aware of your mood, thesensations in your body, perhaps a hidden worry or desire that lies deeper thansuperficial thoughts. But the inner journey can go much deeper, taking you to areality that isn’t about objects “out there” or feelings and thoughts “in here.”Eventually those two worlds meld into one state of being that lies beyond thelimits of space-time, in a realm of infinite possibilities.Now we face a contradiction, however. How can two realities that are opposites(the way baking a loaf of bread is the opposite of dreaming about a loaf ofbread) turn out to be the same? This improbable vision is succinctly describedin the Isha Upanishad, an ancient Indian scripture. “That is complete, and thisis also complete. This totality has been projected from that totality. When thiswholeness merges in that wholeness, all that remains is wholeness.” At firstglance, this passage seems like a riddle, but it can be deciphered by realizingthat “that” is the state of pure consciousness, while “this” is the visibleuniverse. Both are complete in themselves, as we know from science, which hasbeen satisfied for four centuries with exploring the visible universe. But inthe spiritual worldview a hidden wholeness underlies all of creation, andultimately it is this invisible wholeness that matters most.Spirituality has been around for many thousand years, and its researchers werebrilliant—the very Einsteins of consciousness. Anyone can reproduce and verifytheir results, as with the principles of science. More important, the futurethat spirituality promises—one of wisdom, freedom, and fulfillment—hasn’tvanished as the age of faith declined. Reality is reality. There is only one,and it’s permanent. This means that at some point the inner and outer worldsmust meet; we won’t have to choose between them. That in itself will be arevolutionary discovery, since the dispute between science and religion haspersuaded almost everyone that either you face reality and deal with the toughquestions of everyday life (science), or you passively retreat and contemplate arealm beyond everyday life (religion).This either/or choice was forced on us when religion failed to deliver on itspromises. But spirituality, the deeper source of religion, hasn’t failed and isready to meet science face-to-face, offering answers consistent with the mostadvanced scientific theories. Human consciousness created science, whichironically is now moving to exclude consciousness, its very creator! Surely thiswould leave us with worse than an orphaned and shrunken science—we’d inhabit animpoverished world.It has already arrived. We live in a time of rude atheism, whose proponentsderide religion as superstition, illusion, and a hoax. But their real targetisn’t religion; it’s the inner journey. I am less concerned with attacks on Godthan I am with a far more insidious danger: the superstition of materialism. Toscientific atheists, reality must be external; otherwise their whole approachfalls apart. If the physical world is all that exists, science is right to mineit for data.But here the superstition of materialism breaks down. Our five senses encourageus to accept that there are objects “out there,” forests and rivers, atoms andquarks. However, at the frontiers of physics, where Nature becomes very small,matter breaks down and then vanishes. Here, the act of measuring changes what wesee; every observer turns out to be woven into what he observes. This is theuniverse already known to spirituality, where passive observation gives way toactive participation, and we discover that we are part of the fabric ofcreation. The result is enormous power and freedom.Science has never achieved pure objectivity, and it never will. To deny theworth of subjective experience is to dismiss most of what makes life worthliving: love, trust, faith, beauty, awe, wonder, compassion, truth, the arts,morality, and the mind itself. The field of neuroscience has largely acceptedthat the mind doesn’t exist but is merely a by-product of the brain. The brain(a “computer made of meat,” as Marvin Minsky, an expert in artificialintelligence, dubbed it) is our master, chemically deciding how we feel,genetically determining how we grow, live, and die. This picture isn’tacceptable to me, because in dismissing the mind we eliminate our portal toknowledge and insight.As Leonard and I debate the big mysteries, the great sages and seers remind usthat there is only one question: What is reality? Is it the result of naturallaws rigorously operating through cause and effect, or is it something else?There is good reason for our worldviews to be at war. Either reality is boundedby the visible universe, or it isn’t. Either the cosmos was created from anempty, meaningless void, or it wasn’t. Until you understand the nature ofreality, you are like one of the fabled six blind men trying to describe anelephant by holding on to just one of its parts. The one who has hold of the legsays, “An elephant is much like a tree.” The one who has hold of the trunk says,“An elephant is much like a snake.” And so on.The childhood fable about the blind men and the elephant is actually an allegoryfrom ancient India. The six blind men are the five senses plus the rationalmind. The elephant is Brahman, the totality of all that exists. On the surfacethe fable is pessimistic: if all you possess is your five senses and yourrational mind, you’ll never see the elephant. But there is a hidden message soobvious that many people miss it. The elephant exists. It was there before us,patiently waiting to be known. It is the deeper truth of unified reality.Just because religion didn’t succeed doesn’t mean that a new spirituality, basedon consciousness, won’t. We need to see the truth, and in the process we willawaken the profound powers that were promised to us thousands of years ago. Timeawaits. The future depends on the choice we make today."},{"pageContent":"THE SCIENTIFIC PERSPECTIVE[../images/00010.jpeg]LEONARDThe further the spiritual evolution of mankind advances, the more certain itseems to me that the path to genuine religiosity does not lie through the fearof life, and the fear of death, and blind faith, but through the striving afterrational knowledge.—ALBERT EINSTEINChildren come into the world believing it all revolves around them, and so didhumanity. People have always been anxious to understand their universe, but formost of human history we hadn’t yet developed the means. Since we are proactiveand imaginative animals, we didn’t let the lack of tools stop us. We simplyapplied our imagination to form compelling pictures. These pictures were notbased on reality, but were created to serve our needs. We would all like to beimmortal. We’d like to believe that good triumphs over evil, that a greaterpower watches over us, that we are part of something bigger, that we have beenput here for a reason. We’d like to believe that our lives have an intrinsicmeaning. Ancient concepts of the universe comforted us by affirming thesedesires. Where did the universe come from? Where did life come from? Where didpeople come from? The legends and theologies of the past assured us that we werecreated by God, and that our Earth was the center of everything.Today science can answer many of the most fundamental questions of existence.Science’s answers spring from observation and experiment rather than from humanbias or desire. Science offers answers in harmony with nature as it is, ratherthan nature as we’d like it to be.The universe is an awe-inspiring place, especially for those who know somethingabout it. The more we learn, the more astonishing it seems. Newton said that ifhe saw further it was because he stood on the shoulders of giants. Today we canall stand on the shoulders of scientists and see deep and amazing truths aboutthe universe and our place in it. We can understand how we and our Earth arenatural phenomena that arise from the laws of physics. Our ancestors viewed thenight sky with a sense of wonder, but to see stars that explode in seconds andshine with more light than entire galaxies brings a new dimension to the awe. Inour day a scientist can turn her telescope to observe an Earthlike planettrillions of miles away, or study a spectacular internal universe in which amillion million atoms conspire to create a tiny freckle. We know now that ourEarth is one world among many and that our species arose from other species(whose members we may not wish to invite into our living rooms but who are ourancestors nonetheless). Science has revealed a universe that is vast, ancient,violent, strange, and beautiful, a universe of almost infinite variety andpossibility, one in which time can end in a black hole, and conscious beings canevolve from a soup of minerals. In such a universe it can seem that people areinsignificant, but what is significant and profound is that we, ensembles ofalmost uncountable numbers of unthinking atoms, can become aware, and understandour origins and the nature of the cosmos in which we live.Deepak feels that scientific explanations are sterile and reductive, diminishinghumankind to a mere collection of atoms, no different in kind from any otherobject in the universe. But scientific knowledge does not diminish our humanityany more than the knowledge that our country is one among many diminishes ourappreciation of our native culture. In fact, the opposite is closer to thetruth. Emotion, intuition, adherence to authority—traits that drive the beliefin religious and mystical explanation—are traits that can be found in otherprimates, and even in lower animals. But orangutans cannot reason about theangles in triangles, and macaque monkeys do not look to the heavens and wonderwhy the planets follow elliptical paths. It is only humans who can engage in thewondrous processes of reason and thought called science, only humans who canunderstand themselves and how their planet got here, and only humans who coulddiscover the atoms that form us.The triumph of humanity is our capacity to understand. It is our comprehensionof the cosmos, our insight into where we came from, our vision of the place weoccupy in the universe, that sets us apart. A by-product of this scientificunderstanding is the power to harness nature for our benefit, or, it is true, toemploy it to our detriment. The particular ethical and moral choices people makedepend on human nature, and human culture. People dropped boulders on theirenemies long before they understood the law of gravity. And they spewed filthinto the skies long before they understood the thermodynamics of burning coal.Promoting good and avoiding evil is the charge of organized religion andspirituality. It is those enterprises—not science—that have often failed todeliver on their promise. Eastern religions did not prevent a history of brutalwarfare in Asia, nor did Western religions pacify Europe. In fact, more peoplehave been slaughtered in the name of religion than by all the atomic weaponsmade possible by modern physics. From the Crusades to the Holocaust, in additionto being a tool of goodness and love, religion has been employed as a tool ofhatred. Deepak’s universalist and peaceful approach to spirituality is thereforea welcome alternative. But Deepak’s metaphysics goes beyond spiritual guidanceto offer views on the nature of the universe. Deepak’s belief that the universeis purposeful and imbued with love may be attractive, but is it correct?Deepak criticizes science for its vision of life as “essentially materialistic.”By materialistic, Deepak does not mean to suggest that scientists are focusedonly on things and the desire to possess them, but that scientists deal onlywith phenomena we can see, hear, smell, detect with instruments, or measure withnumbers. He contrasts the visible, or detectable, universe studied by sciencewith an implicitly superior but invisible “realm of infinite possibility” thatlies beyond our senses, a “transcendent domain” that is the source of allvisible things. Deepak argues passionately that only by accepting this realm canscience grow beyond its limits and help save the world. But arguing that such arealm can expand the limits of science, that it can help humanity, or thatancient sages taught about it doesn’t make it true. If you think you are eatinga cheeseburger, and I tell you that in some other unseen realm it is really afilet mignon, you’d want to know how I know this, and what evidence supports myidea. Only those answers can enable a belief to transcend wish fulfillment, soif Deepak is to be convincing, those questions are the challenges he mustaddress.The real issue, as Deepak says, is knowledge and how you attain it. Deepakcriticizes science for denying “the worth of subjective experience.” But sciencewouldn’t have gotten very far if one scientist described a helium atom as“pretty heavy” while another noted that “it feels light to me.” Scientistsemploy precise objective measurements and precise objective concepts for goodreason, and the fact that they seek to ensure that their measurements andconcepts are not influenced by “love, trust, faith, beauty, awe, wonder,compassion,” etc., does not mean that they dismiss the value of those qualitiesin other areas of life.Scientists are often guided by their intuition and subjective feelings, but theyrecognize the need for another step: verification. Science proceeds in a loop ofobservation, theory, and experiment. The loop is repeated until the theory andthe empirical evidence are in harmony. But this method would fail if conceptswere not precisely defined and experiments were not rigorously controlled. Theseelements of the scientific method are crucial, and it is they that determine thedifference between good science and bad science, or between science andpseudoscience. Deepak said Jesus was a scientist. Was he? He probably did notgather a sample of the population and, after being insulted, turn the othercheek to half of them, and lay out the other half with a solid right hook, thengather statistics on the efficacy of the different approaches. It might seemsilly that I object when Deepak calls Jesus a scientist, but it introduces atheme—the use of terminology—that will become important in more substantivecontexts later in this book: one must be careful when discussing scientificissues not to use terms loosely. It is easy to use words imprecisely in anargument, but it is also dangerous, because the substance of the argument oftenrelies on the nuances of those words.I do not suggest that science is perfect. Deepak says that science has neverachieved pure objectivity, and he is right. For one, the concepts employed inscience are concepts conceived by the human brain. Aliens with different brainstructures, thought processes, and sense organs might view matter in completelydifferent, but equally valid, ways. And if there is a certain kind ofsubjectivity to our concepts and our theories, there is also subjectivity in ourexperiments. In fact, experiments that have been done on experimenters show thatthere is a tendency for scientists to see what they want to see, and to beconvinced by data they wish to find convincing. Yes, scientists, and science,are fallible. Yet all these are reasons not to doubt the scientific method, butto follow it as scrupulously as possible.History shows that the scientific method works. Being only human, somescientists may at first resist new and revolutionary ideas, but if a theory’spredictions are confirmed by experiment, the new theory soon becomes mainstream.For example, in 1982, Robin Warren and Barry Marshall discovered theHelicobacter pylori bacteria, and hypothesized that it causes ulcers. Their workwas not well received because at the time scientists firmly believed that stressand lifestyle were the major causes of peptic ulcer disease. Yet furtherexperiments bore out their claims, and by 2005 it had been established thatHelicobacter pylori causes more than 90 percent of duodenal ulcers and up to 80percent of gastric ulcers, and Warren and Marshall were awarded the Nobel Prize.Science would also embrace Deepak, if his claims were true.When theories that people are passionate about are brushed off by the sciencecommunity, cries of closed-mindedness often emerge. But the history of scienceshows that the real reason for the rejection of theories is that they clash withobservational evidence. In fact, some very weird ideas, arising sometimes fromvery obscure and unexpected quarters—ideas like relativity and quantumuncertainty—have quickly gained acceptance, despite challenging conventionalthinking, for just one reason: they passed their experimental tests. Proponentsof metaphysics and Deepak’s spirituality are far less open to revising orexpanding their worldviews to encompass new discoveries. Rather than welcomingnew truths, they often cling to ancient ideas, explanations, and texts. If onoccasion they turn to science in an attempt to justify their traditional ideas,whenever it appears that science does not support them they are quick to turntheir backs on it. And when they do employ scientific concepts, they use them soloosely that the meanings are altered, with the result that the conclusions theycome to are not valid.One can’t expect science to answer all the questions of the universe. There maywell be secrets of nature that will remain forever beyond the outer limits ofhuman intelligence. Other questions, such as those regarding human aspirationsand the meaning of our lives, are best viewed from multiple perspectives, bothscientific and spiritual. These approaches can coexist and respect each other.The trouble arises when religious and spiritual doctrine makes pronouncementsabout the physical universe that contradict what we actually observe to be true.To Deepak, the key to everything is the understanding of consciousness. It istrue that science has only begun to address that question. How do thoseunthinking atoms we are made of conspire to create love, pain, and joy? How doesthe brain create thought and conscious experience? The brain contains more thana hundred billion neurons, roughly the number of stars in a galaxy, but thestars hardly interact, while the average neuron is plugged into thousands ofothers. That makes the human brain far more complex and difficult to fathom thanthe universe of galaxies and stars, and is one reason we have made great leapsin our understanding of the cosmos, while knowledge of ourselves proceeds at arelative crawl. Is that a sign that our minds cannot be explained?It is shortsighted to believe that because science today cannot explainconsciousness, consciousness must lie beyond science’s reach. But even if theorigin of consciousness is too complex to be fully grasped by the human mind,that is not evidence that consciousness resides in a supernatural realm. Infact, though the question of how consciousness arises remains a puzzle, we haveplenty of evidence that consciousness functions according to physical law. Forexample, in neuroscience experiments, thoughts, feelings, and sensations insubjects’ minds—the desire to move an arm, the thought of a specific person likeJennifer Aniston or Mother Teresa, and the craving for a Snickers bar—have allbeen traced to specific areas and activities in the physical brain. Scientistshave even uncovered what they call “concept cells,” which fire whenever asubject recognizes a concept, such as a specific person, place, or object. Theseneurons are the cellular substrate of an idea. They will fire, say, each time aperson recognizes Mother Teresa in a photo, no matter what her dress or pose.They will even fire if the subject merely sees her name spelled out in text.Science can answer the seemingly intractable question of how the universe cameinto being, and there is reason to believe that science will eventually be ableto explain the origins of consciousness, too. Science is an ever-advancingprocess, and the end is not in sight. If at some future date we are able toexplain the mind in terms of the activity of a universe of neurons, if all ourmental processes do prove to have their source in the flow of charged ionswithin nerve cells, that would not mean that science denies the worth of “love,trust, faith, beauty, awe, wonder, compassion, truth, the arts, morality, andthe mind itself.” To explain something is not, as I have said, to diminish ordeny its worth. It is also important to recognize that even if we consider ascientific explanation of our thought processes (or anything else) aestheticallyor spiritually unsatisfying or unpalatable, that does not make it false. Ourexplanations must be guided by truth; truth cannot be adjusted to conform towhat we want to hear.Unfortunately, the current absence of a fully developed scientific theory ofconsciousness invites just the type of imprecise reasoning that leads toconclusions that conflict with known physical laws. Philosophy and metaphysicscannot explain an MRI machine, a television, or even a toaster. Can they explainconsciousness, or why the universe is as we find it? Maybe, but as Deepak offershis explanations of a universal consciousness, I plan to hold to an importantprinciple of science, skepticism. Deepak tells me that in our discussion he isthe underdog. The data show otherwise. According to random samples, only 45percent of the American public believes in evolution, but 76 percent believes inmiracles. No presidential candidate can be credible without proclaiming a beliefin some higher power, but many have found it politically advantageous to denythe theory of evolution. Science is not the lord of modern life Deepak imagines,but its underappreciated servant.The answers of science don’t come easily. Nobel Prize–winning physicist StevenWeinberg has dedicated his life to the tireless study of the theory ofelementary particles, such as the electron, the muon, and the quark. Yet hewrote that he has never found those particles very interesting. Why then has hedevoted his life to understanding them? Because he believes that at this momentin the history of human thought, their study offers the most promising way toachieve insight into the fundamental laws that govern all of nature. Some of theten thousand scientists who worked, many for over a decade, to build the LargeHadron Collider, the multibillion-dollar particle accelerator in Geneva,probably didn’t think the long hours of calibrating delicate instruments andfine-tuning spectrometers was all that fascinating either (though many certainlydid!). They did it for the same reason Weinberg studied muons. Humans are unlikeother animals in the questions they ask about their environment. When droppedinto new surroundings, a rat will explore for a while, form a mental map, getsafe, then stop probing. But a person will ask, Why am I in this cage? How did Iget here? Where’s the nearest decent coffee? Humans study science because wehave an urge to know how our lives fit into the greater scheme of the universe.That’s one of the defining qualities of what makes us human. But the answers areonly edifying if they are true. So to you, the reader, I would suggest that asyou ponder Deepak’s often very appealing worldview, you keep in mind the wordsof the iconic Caltech physicist Richard Feynman: the first principle is that youmust not fool yourself—and you are the easiest to fool.dy>"},{"pageContent":"PART TWO[../images/00009.jpeg]COSMOSdy>"},{"pageContent":"[../images/00009.jpeg]HOW DID THE UNIVERSE EMERGE?"},{"pageContent":"[../images/00010.jpeg]LEONARDEvery civilization has had its creation stories. The Europeans came up with adoozy in the early twentieth century, and it has since been refined andelaborated upon by scholars from all over the world. It came to be called theBig Bang, but it has morphed into something called the standard model ofcosmology. We consider it a theory, while we call the other explanations myths.What makes the Big Bang different from the Mayan proposition that we are allmade from white and yellow corn? Is science’s faith in its explanationjustified? What are the limits of current knowledge?The idea of the Big Bang arose from Einstein’s theory of general relativity,which he completed in 1915, after over a decade of work. General relativity is aset of equations that describe the way gravity, space and time, energy andmatter, all interact. With his theory Einstein was asking people to toss out theintuitively satisfying and very successful theory of Isaac Newton, and in itsplace to accept some very weird ideas that seem to contradict what we experiencein everyday life. Metaphysics is a court of opening and closing arguments, withno requirement that evidence be presented in between. In science it is only theevidence that matters. So when Einstein said there is a hidden realityunderlying and quite different from the world we perceive with our senses, noscientist would have listened unless he produced a series of smoking guns. Hedid.Though one can apply general relativity to the universe as a whole, theapplications that provide the easiest tests of its validity are the ones thatsuccessfully explain simple systems such as a planet orbiting our sun, or a rayof starlight flying past it. It was these applications that provided the firstphysical evidence that Einstein was onto something. In the case of the planet,Einstein’s theory explained a previously observed irregularity in the orbit ofMercury, which deviated from the prediction of Newton’s laws. It was a smallirregularity, so most scientists before Einstein had simply scratched theirheads over it, and expected that eventually a mundane explanation would befound. Einstein showed that the explanation was anything but mundane. Becausethat irregularity was already known, an even more impressive test of the theorywas his novel (and at the time astonishing) prediction that, given the effectsof relativity, gravity would bend light rays, and hence that our view of distantstars would be altered when their light passed near our sun. In order to observethat effect, and not have the starlight in question swamped by that of the sun,one had to look at it during a total solar eclipse. This experiment wasperformed, and Einstein’s theory was found to correctly predict not just thatthe light would be bent, but also the amount of the bending.Einstein’s triumph—and the equally revolutionary triumph of quantum theory—didnot mean that everything about Newton’s view of the world had suddenly beeninvalidated. It is not as if civilization woke up one morning and realized ithad built all its buildings and bridges wrong, that Edison’s lightbulb is reallya quantum laser, or that if you drive faster than the speed limit you’ll neverneed wrinkle cream. Newton’s theory had been tested and retested, and, exceptfor the problem of the orbit of Mercury, never been found lacking, andEinstein’s theory didn’t challenge the fact that Newton’s theory provides anexcellent description of the events we experience in our everyday lives. Infact, when applied to such situations, Einstein’s theory yields predictions soclose to those of Newton’s that only very sophisticated instruments can detectthe difference. But under certain conditions, relevant for astrophysics and incertain laboratory experiments, Newtonian predictions do differ significantlyfrom those of Einstein’s theory. So when scientists say that Newton’s theory is“wrong,” we mean it is only approximately correct. Still, Einstein’s theory is amore fundamentally true description of nature, which reveals the character ofspace and time on a much deeper level than what Newton had envisioned.The experimental support for his theories made Einstein an internationalcelebrity, but the most astounding implications of his ideas were yet to come.In the 1920s a Belgian priest and astronomer named Georges Lemaître appliedEinstein’s equations to the universe as a whole. He discovered something that atthe time might have seemed both obvious and shocking. First the obvious part.Since gravity is an attractive force, when you toss an apple into the air, thepull of gravity will cause it to fall back toward the Earth. That is, the applefirst moves away from the earth, then back down toward it, but does not hover inplace (except for that single instant at the top of its trajectory). Theshocking part came when Lemaître showed that, similarly, due to the mutualattraction of the matter and energy within it, the universe can expand, slowdown, and possibly contract, but cannot remain at a fixed size, as everyone atthe time—including Einstein—believed. If the universe is expanding, that meansthat if you trace the history of the universe backward in time, you’ll find theuniverse getting ever smaller. And so Lemaître speculated further that theuniverse began as a single point. That theory is now called the Big Bang theory.The Big Bang theory was intimately connected to Einstein’s general relativity,but if it had made no testable predictions it would have been little better thansaying the universe was made from corn. A critical element of the theory wasconfirmed shortly after Lemaître’s work, when Edwin Hubble discovered that theuniverse is expanding. But a more specific implication of Lemaître’s scenario isthat, as the primordial fireball cooled to a billion degrees in the first fewminutes after the Big Bang, various light elements should have been created incertain definite proportions. In particular, about 25 percent of the matter inthe universe should be in the form of helium—and this is precisely what we find.Another implication is that the universe should have cooled a great deal moresince then. According to the theory, space today should be permeated withresidual radiation at a temperature of, on average, about 2.7 degrees centigradeabove absolute zero. Again, this agrees with what we measure.By the 1970s the Big Bang model had proved very successful at explaining most ofthe history of our universe. But there remained some apparent anomalies. Forexample, consider a frying pan that is at a uniform temperature except for onespot that is hotter than the rest. After a short time, the hot spot will be abit cooler, while the nearby region of the pan will be slightly warmer. Withmore time, the hot spot will cool further, transferring its heat to ever largerareas of the pan. Eventually the entire pan will end up at a uniformtemperature. But this transition to uniformity takes time. The universe is likethe pan after a very long time—its temperature is almost uniform. The problemwas that we happened to know that not enough time had passed to have allowedthat to occur. So why is it so close to 2.7 degrees in every direction? Why nota hot spot here and a cold spot there? Physicists called this the horizonproblem.The so-called flatness problem was another puzzle. General relativity dictatesthat the amount of matter and energy in the universe determines the curvature ofspace. What does that mean? Curvature of our three-dimensional space can bedifficult to visualize, but the idea is similar in two dimensions, so let’sconsider that. A flat plane is a two-dimensional surface with no curvature. Thesurface of a sphere, on the other hand, curves in on itself, and is an exampleof a surface with what is called positive curvature. In contrast, a saddle iscurved outward, so it is said to have negative curvature. The equations ofgeneral relativity tell us that if there is more than a certain critical amountof matter and energy per unit volume in the universe, space will curl up into aspherelike shape, and eventually collapse upon itself. If there is less thanthis critical density, space will curve outward like a saddle. Only if theaverage concentration of matter and energy is exactly at the critical value willspace be flat. The critical density varies with the age of the universe. Longago it was very high, but today it is the equivalent of about 6 hydrogen atomsper cubic meter of space.We can measure the large-scale curvature of space directly, and space appears tobe flat, at least to the precision to which we can measure. The problem is thatthe equations of general relativity show that if the density of the universeever deviated from the critical value, that deviation would quickly getenormously amplified. That means that if, in the early universe, the density ofmatter had been even slightly less than the critical density, the universe wouldtoday be saddle-shaped and vastly more dilute than we find it. Or if its densityhad been just a bit higher than the critical value, the universe would long agohave collapsed in on itself like a balloon with the air sucked out. Due to thisamplification effect, in order for the Big Bang model to account for the degreeof flatness that we observed, when the universe was one second old, theconcentration of matter and energy had to be tuned to the critical value withinan accuracy of one part in a thousand trillion.One might ask, “So what? Couldn’t the universe simply have been made that way?”It could have, but this illustrates an important point in science. The keyaspects of a theory should follow from some principle, and not be contrived tomake the theory work. To a scientist, a theory stating that the universe dependsupon being set up long ago in a very precise way is not a very satisfyingtheory. Scientists want to comprehend the underlying reason, the natural lawsthat explain the special circumstance.The horizon problem, the flatness problem, and some other difficulties with theBig Bang theory were all resolved in the late 1970s when physicists discovered anew chapter in the evolution of the universe, a chapter called inflation.Inflation was discovered by Alan Guth, a young particle theorist who, by his ownadmission, hadn’t really accomplished very much up until then. Guth changed thatwhen he realized that certain conditions that physicists believe were presentwhen the universe was a fraction of a second old would have caused the cosmos togo crazy, doubling in size in less than every billionth of a trillionth of atrillionth of a second. Assuming that doubling continued for “only” a hundredcycles, a parcel of universe the width of a penny would have blown up to morethan ten million times the diameter of the Milky Way.How does inflation benefit a troubled cosmologist? Imagine running a film of theuniverse backward from today. As we move backward through inflation, theobservable universe is crunched into an extremely tiny region. Inflationtherefore means that regions of the universe that are now widely separated wereclose enough together in preinflation times that their temperature differencescould have been smoothed out before the expansion. That solves the horizonproblem. Inflation also solves the flatness problem. To understand why, imaginewhat would happen to a tiny balloon that suddenly inflated to the diameter of,say, the sun. Though it would have been easy to measure the balloon’s curvaturebefore its great blowup, once it is the size of the sun, to anyone on itssurface, the balloon would appear much flatter. In an analogous way, inflationflattened our universe.Guth’s theory could not have been envisioned by Einstein, Lemaître, or anyoneelse working with general relativity alone. It depended on ideas taken from thatother revolution of the twentieth century, quantum theory. Quantum theory is notreally a theory, but a set of principles that define a type of theory. Theoriesdeveloped according to those quantum principles are called quantum theories.General relativity is not a quantum theory and we don’t yet know exactly how tomake it one, but there are ways of extracting limited predictions that draw uponthe principles of both theories. In his work Guth relied on many quantum ideasdeveloped between the 1930s and the 1970s.One of the basic tenets of any modern quantum theory is that for every particlethere is a field, something like the force fields you see in science fiction.According to quantum theory, those fields cannot remain constant in magnitude,but are subject to continual quantum fluctuations on a microscopic scale. Asinflation began to occur and the old wrinkles in space were flattened out, newmicroscopic quantum wrinkles arose to replace them. As inflation progressed, itstretched those wrinkles to macroscopic size, resulting in a specific pattern ofvariation in the matter/energy density of the postinflationary universe. Andsince gravity is attractive, the areas that emerged from inflation denser thantheir surroundings attracted ever more matter, creating the seeds of galaxies.In that way the stretched-out quantum fluctuations led to the structure we seein the universe today—the galactic clusters, galaxies, and stars. Without thequantum fluctuations, the universe would be a uniform and featureless soup.The pattern of density variation created by inflation can still be detectedtoday. Earlier I said the fact that the temperature of the universe was almostthe same everywhere was a mystery that inflation explains. But inflation goes astep further—it predicts that although the temperature is nearly constant in anydirection you look, it will vary slightly and in a particular pattern. That is avery precise prediction, and a high bar of evidence to clear, but temperaturevariations of exactly the kind predicted by inflation have now been observed,variations that occur within a range of less than a hundred thousandth of adegree centigrade.That, in brief, is the scientific picture of how the universe got here, and someof the evidence for that scenario. The real bang in the Big Bang was not thebeginning of the universe, but the period of inflation, an expansion many timesmore drastic than that predicted by the original Big Bang scenario, and one thathappened an instant after the universe began.What happened before inflation? For now, scientific answers to that question arefar more speculative, and far less certain, than the picture I’ve describedabove. Better answers await progress in creating a quantum version of generalrelativity (string theory, if shown to be true, would accomplish that). Manyphysicists argue that the new theory, once we have it, will show that, at somepoint before inflation, time as we know it did not exist. But the most strikingspeculation about what a quantum theory that includes general relativity mighttell us comes from a quantum principle called vacuum fluctuations.I mentioned above that galaxies are products of the microscopic fluctuations ofquantum fields. Vacuum fluctuations refer to the quantum prediction that even“nothingness”—which in quantum theory is given a precise mathematicaldefinition—exhibits fluctuations, and is therefore in a sense unstable. That is,even if you start with a region of space in which there is neither energy normatter, it will not remain that way. Nothingness is instead like a boilingcauldron in which particles are always bubbling in and out of existence. That isa strange concept taken in the context of everyday experience, but to those whospend their days studying the behavior of elementary particles, it is a familiareffect. Vacuum fluctuations are one of the best-confirmed results in all ofscience, and have been measured to an accuracy of ten decimal places. They mustbe accounted for in all calculations and experiments in modern particle physics.In fact, most of your mass comes from the protons in the atoms you are made of,and most of the mass of a proton comes, not from the masses of the quarks thatmake up the proton, but from the energy of the “empty” space between thosequarks, the turbulent brew of particles arising from nothingness, and thenquickly disappearing back into it. So next time you think about how much youweigh, remember that most of your weight is due to the weight of empty space.Many physicists believe that vacuum fluctuations point to an astoundingprediction: the universe could have arisen spontaneously from nothing. Did it?We don’t yet know for sure because we don’t yet understand exactly how generalrelativity and quantum theory can be combined. Even once we think we havefigured it out, specific predictions pertaining to observable phenomena willhave to be made, and those predictions tested. Physicists will do that, becausethat, ultimately, is the work of science. Unlike philosophical, metaphysical,and mystical speculations, which are not bound by the constraint of evidence, ascientific theory of the origin of the universe must pass observational tests.The resulting picture might not satisfy those looking for a divine source forour beginnings, but it will be the answer of science."},{"pageContent":"[../images/00010.jpeg]DEEPAKThe first and greatest mystery is how the universe came to be. For spirituality,the issue seems like a lost cause before discussion even begins. Modern physicshas taken over the genesis question, and its answer—the Big Bang and all thatfollowed for the next 13.7 billion years—has succeeded in wiping out thecredibility of the Bible, the Koran, the Vedas, and every other indigenousversion of creation. Yet today, just at the moment when science seems poised tostrike the final blow, it has gotten stuck. Quantum physics has been forced tostop at the edge of the void that preceded creation, with no way forward untilthat void can be bridged by an explanation. Leonard’s position, shared byphysics in general, is that the full explanation will be found throughmathematics. My position, shared by students of consciousness in general, isthat the very meaning of existence is at stake. In modern times we have assignedcosmology to specialists the way we assign genes to geneticists. But you can’tpin a sign on creation that says “Keep out; you don’t know enough math.” We allhave a stake in genesis, and that’s fortunate, because a new creation story istrying to be born in our time, and all previous versions are up for radicalrevision.The void is the starting point for any creation story, whether scientific orspiritual. The book of Genesis tells us that “the earth was without form andvoid, and darkness was over the face of the deep.” Assigning God a home in thevoid doesn’t satisfy the scientific mind, however, and spirituality mustovercome some strong skeptical objections, which include the following:• There is no scientific proof that God, or any creator, exists.• The universe cannot be proven to have a purpose.• The preuniverse may be unimaginable. Insofar as our experiences happen in timeand space, is it futile to try to explain reality before space and timeappeared?• Randomness seems to be the long-term winner in the universe as stars die andenergy approaches absolute zero.These seem like crushing objections, and Leonard exemplifies the stubbornresistance of science to other ways of regarding the cosmos. Nonscientificexplanations he regards with suspicion or worse—as primitive superstition(“white and yellow corn”), or self-delusion. For him, all processes in thecosmos, visible or invisible, can be explained through materialism. But it’sfascinating to see just how spirituality has resurged in the debate, and why, inmy view, it will gain the upper hand. All of science’s objections can be met,and in the process we can lay the groundwork for a new creation story.Stephen Hawking is regarded by popular culture as the last wise man, who, likeEinstein, carries the full weight of science when he speaks. Hawking madeworldwide news in 2010 by declaring that “it is not necessary to invoke God … toset the universe going.” The world of devout believers had one more reason toconsider science the enemy of faith. Einstein personally felt awe and wonderbefore the mystery that lies at the far horizon of the cosmos. But since thenthe universe of theoretical physics has become random, complex, paradoxical, andbarren of divine presence.Hawking and others say that quantum principles make it possible for the universeto arise from nothingness. But to keep this from being the void that beginsGenesis, physics ties itself into a knot. “Nothing” gave rise to the humandesire for meaning, so how can it be meaningless? The universe operatesrandomly, but this randomness created the human brain, which does all kinds ofnonrandom things (such as writing Shakespeare and saying “I love you”), so howdid the purposeless give birth to the purposeful?The still unproven nature of “nothing” is the opening wedge for spirituality,which, contrary to what Leonard says, doesn’t need to revert to prescientificmyths. Instead, it presents insights about what lies beyond space and time. Thenew creation story will be based on the following:1. Wholeness: The universe, including the void that precedes creation, is onesystem. The ground of existence is not inert emptiness, but a dynamic fieldconnecting all creation in a single totality. Smaller processes in the quantumfield hang together even when they are light-years apart. We see all kinds ofthings happening around us that cannot be totally disconnected: How is a fireflyon a sultry summer night connected with emperor penguins marching hundreds ofmiles across the Antarctic ice, or with a tropical storm in the East Indies? Thedeeper truth is that wholeness must include all of them.Our five senses are caught up in diversity, and part of diversity’s job is tolook disconnected; that’s what fascinates us about life’s endless variety.Wholeness, on the other hand, is invisible. It can be fully known only with theprobing mind in its deepest explorations—that is the spiritual perspective. Theonly external way to glimpse wholeness is through mathematics. As Einsteinobserved, he thought up the concept of relativity in mathematical terms and thenwas astonished that Nature agreed with him. But an inner experience ofwholeness, which is what the Buddha and other sages report, is just as valid aform of knowledge, and in the end is more satisfying, as I hope to establish.2. Orderliness: The natural laws that govern the universe are orderly becausethey can be mathematically explained. Events that look random, from thescattering of light to the bombardment of atoms, from wind to volcaniceruptions, distract us from that deeper truth: Randomness is just a way to getfrom one stage of orderliness to another. To put it another way, randomness isthe universe’s way of breaking eggs to make cosmic omelets. As higher orders oforganization emerge, they go through messy transitions that seem to behaverandomly—the way vegetables in a compost heap go through decay in order tobecome fertile soil—but randomness is not the end stage; it is only theintermediate step for a new, more complex level of organization. It is only astep from orderliness to meaning, which implies that the universe actually meanssomething.3. Evolution: The first cousin of randomness is entropy, the law of which statesthat heat is constantly being dispersed throughout the universe. Entropy is howthe cosmos winds down, heading for absolute zero, to the so-called heat deaththat awaits all things. But another force exists that creates the opposite—warmspots in creation where heat collects, leading to DNA and life on Earth. Thisopposing force is evolution, the tendency that makes everything grow.Spirituality holds that evolution is dominant in Nature. Growth, once it begins,never ends.4. Creativity: Evolution doesn’t simply scramble old ingredients into new forms;nor does it just turn small clumps of matter into bigger clumps. Instead,evolution makes leaps of creativity. These happen in quantum form—that is, thereis a sudden emergence of a property that never existed before. Water emergesfrom two invisible gases, hydrogen and oxygen. Nothing about those two gaseswould predict what water is like. Quantum leaps dominate in creation everywherewe look, but especially in the startling, beautiful novelty of life-forms onEarth. The cosmos is ruled by creativity.5. Consciousness: To be creative you have to be conscious. Spirituality holdsthat consciousness is basic to creation. It has always existed, and the visibleuniverse unfolds as a display of what consciousness wants to explore. Wholenesscouldn’t unfold simply by following mechanical laws such as gravity. Lookingaround, we see too much experimentation, invention, and imagination in Nature.Instead of saying that those things are unscientific fantasies of the humanmind, many speculative thinkers make the opposite point. To arrive at DNA, lifeon Earth, and the human mind, the universe was self-aware and could understandwhat it was doing. Science is obligated to accept the simplest, most elegantexplanation for things. It is far simpler to accept consciousness as a giventhan to come up with tortured schemes that become ever more complex by denyingthe central role of consciousness.Creation without consciousness is like the fabled roomful of monkeys randomlystriking keys on a typewriter until they wind up, millions of years later,writing the complete works of Shakespeare. One researcher actually arranged tohave a random-number generator (an updated monkey) spew out letters to see ifsensible words would emerge. They did, but it took countless tries to form evena simple phrase, and the unlikelihood of producing Hamlet was astronomical. (Asa character, Hamlet speaks 1,495 lines, and if our computer-monkey got the lastsyllable wrong—writing “The rest is silent” instead of “The rest is silence”—itwould have to repeat the whole random process from the start. Only thirty-sixplays to go!) Human DNA is thousands of times more complex in its structure thanthe letters composing Shakespeare’s writings. Rather than supposing that Naturehad to go back to the beginning every time it randomly left out a gene splice,it’s more reasonable to assume that the universe remembers the steps ofevolution and can build upon them. In other words, it is self-aware, orconscious.Spirituality, then, has viable arguments about how the universe came intoexistence, arguments that transcend Leonard’s mathematical model because thatmodel is insufficient. Math doesn’t begin to explain why the ingredients of theearly universe look suspiciously like the exact materials needed for consciouslife. As the noted theoretical physicist Freeman Dyson writes, “Life may havesucceeded against all odds in molding a universe to its purposes.” For those whoinsist on the primacy of matter, there is even convincing material data forthrowing randomness out the window. At the time of the Big Bang, the number ofparticles created was slightly more than the number of antiparticles. There werea billion plus one particles for every billion antiparticles. These particlesand antiparticles instantaneously collided and annihilated each other, fillingthe universe with photons. Because of the initial tiny imbalance, however, therewere excess particles left over after the annihilation, and this alone createdwhat we know as the material world. What are the chances of that? About the sameas the chances of blowing up a skyscraper with dynamite and finding a newskyscraper springing up from the leftover dust.Leonard has offered even more intricate descriptions of the first few secondsafter the Big Bang, but I want to stay with a simple concept. If all you careabout is the data, then you and I, and all living species, along with the starsand galaxies in our universe, are the result of a freakishly small imbalance atthe moment of creation. The physical universe had every likelihood of notemerging. But it did, and something else emerged along with it: an organizingforce that shaped the roiling, chaotic infant cosmos without itself beingvisible.In the absence of that shaping force, the odds against you and me appearing aretoo fantastically small to be credible. Physicists have added many othercoincidences to the ones Leonard enumerates, but he minimizes the baffling stateof affairs that has resulted: the universe’s parts fit together with infiniteand infinitesimal precision. No matter how small the scale or how large, thecosmos is seamlessly exact in a way that randomness cannot account for.Something must have caused this, and it must exist beyond the visible universe.Even by their own lights, materialists confront a transcendent realm, andthrowing God out of that realm won’t make it any less real.Still, to arrive at a new creation story, there is no need to invoke God in atraditional sense (even though Einstein’s awe and wonder are, according to him,completely necessary if someone wants to make great scientific discoveries).What is crucial for my side of the debate is that science has been forced topeer into the void that exists beyond time and space, opening the door forconsciousness, creativity, evolution, orderliness, and wholeness as basicprinciples in Nature. As I will show, without these traits, the universe couldnot have produced DNA, life on Earth, the human mind, and civilization. Sincethey all exist, the cause for spirituality is far from lost. It’s just beginningto assert itself.dy>"},{"pageContent":"[../images/00009.jpeg]IS THE UNIVERSE CONSCIOUS?"},{"pageContent":"[../images/00010.jpeg]DEEPAKIn an old Jewish punch line, God creates the world, sits back to view hishandiwork, and says, “Let’s hope it works.” In science’s creation myth, nothingcreates the world or has any idea if it will work. The universe was mindlessuntil the arrival of the human brain, which looked back at its own evolution anddeclared, “Nothing could be conscious but me. There is no awareness outside meor before me.”The curious thing is that physics, in proposing a universe where consciousnesshas no place for 13 billion years, undercuts its own foundation. The mostadvanced aspect of physics, quantum theory, tells us that a subatomic realmprovides our best description of nature—the quantum field that holds realitytogether. But then physicists place this field outside ourselves: in otherwords, human consciousness knows itself, but the field isn’t permitted to do thesame. This exclusion forces science into some tortuous claims. For example,Stephen Hawking publicly declared his support for the existence of trillionsupon trillions of other universes (the exact number being 1 followed by fivehundred zeros). None of these alternate universes has ever been seen or proven.The need for other universes is to have enough spares to throw away, because ifyou hold, as Hawking does, that consciousness is the outcome of random physicalprocesses, it takes a lot of failures before one lucky universe—ours—hits thejackpot.Against this fantastical conception of trillions of leftover universes, I’d liketo quote the Bhagavad Gita, at the moment when Lord Krishna wants to describehis divine nature: “I am the field and the knower of the field.” In ten shortwords he marks out the spiritual side of the debate. There is a field thatcomprises all of creation, both visible and invisible, and it is imbued with amind that knows itself. (Although physics defines “field” in a narrow technicalway, the ancient usage simply means the ground of existence.) When they exploredtheir own awareness, the great sages of ancient India discovered “AhamBrahmasmi,” which means “All that exists is within me,” or in simplest terms, “Iam the universe.”Aham Brahmasmi states something very basic: consciousness exists everywhere inNature. If you reject this notion, the alternative is nearly absurd, because itturns consciousness into an accident, the chance result of DNA being boiled upin the chemical soup of the Earth’s oceans two billion years ago. Then, througha chain of equally haphazard events, human intelligence evolved in order to lookout at the cosmos and say, “I’m the only one who can think around here. Aren’t Ilucky?” (I was told by one physicist who became interested in a consciousuniverse that she was heckled at a conference by senior physicists, one of whomcried, “Go back and start doing good physics again.” She noted that theiryounger colleagues looked interested but kept quiet.)As we’ve seen, the weakest link in the current argument from science israndomness. Substitute a car factory for the visible universe. The factory’sassembly line produces beautifully made machines, intricate and efficient, eachdesign displaying invention and creativity. Yet when you go around to the backof the plant and look closely, you find a cloud of iron atoms, silica, andplastic polymers swirling mindlessly as they are sucked into the factory. Is itreally credible that this cloud of matter and energy, plus an indeterminateamount of time, was enough to lead to a car, all on its own? That is science’scurrent story about how the Big Bang led to the human brain. Incredibly, whenasked if perhaps the Big Bang contained the potential for creativity andintelligence embedded in it, science’s conventional answer is a resounding no.Chaos can produce those things, we are told, given enough time and trillions ofrandom interactions.Some scientists, uncomfortable with a blind creation, have tried to awaken thecosmos a little, and sometimes a lot. Sir James Jeans, an eminent Britishphysicist in the first half of the twentieth century, mused, “The universebegins to look more like a great thought than a great machine.” In our time SirRoger Penrose, another renowned English physicist (and a frequent debater withStephen Hawking), proposes that the seeds of consciousness are embedded in theuniverse at the finest level of Nature, the vanishing point of matter and energy(technically known as the Planck scale of space-time geometry).Penrose speaks of mathematical truth, for example, as being a Platonic value,named after the Greek philosopher Plato, who proposed that every human qualitywas born from a universal quality—for example, love is a Platonic value becauseit is inherent in creation, not something invented by humans to describe theiremotions. We feel love because we are part of creation. Penrose relies on thefact that all of science rests upon mathematics, but he sees math as more thanjust numbers to be crunched. To someone who really understands it, mathematicsexpresses values that reflect the cosmos, including orderliness, balance,harmony, logic, and abstract beauty. You can’t strip the numbers out and leavethese other values behind.Every physicist agrees to the preeminence of mathematics, so it’s hard to seehow science can get away with rejecting the qualities that go with mathematicalreasoning. In other words, if you are looking for truth, doesn’t truth have tobe part of the setup of your mind? Otherwise, how would you know what to lookfor? Once you have embedded harmony and logic in the fabric of the cosmos, youhave a much harder time excluding consciousness. Spirituality takes the nextlogical step: everything we experience occurs in consciousness; therefore, thereis no reality “out there,” divorced from consciousness. Penrose won’t go thisfar, since he is on record as declaring that he abhors the notion of asubjective universe. But the beauty of invoking cosmic consciousness is that wecan do away with the war between subjective and objective. In the universe’sprecreated state the potential for both existed, as seeds in the womb.Other thinkers have taken a deep breath and let the whole thing in. Instead ofisolating the human mind from the field of creation—like a hungry child with hisnose pressed against the bakery window—some scientists choose to break down thebarrier between the universe and ourselves. The late John Wheeler of Princetonheld that the visible universe could come into existence only if someoneobserved it, and without such an observer, there would be no universe. Minus theparticipation of an observer, the universe would still be in a state of purepotential. When we gaze at the stars, is that what makes them appear?Cries of “solipsism” may fill the air, but it isn’t necessary to say that theuniverse waited for human beings before it came into existence. The observercould be God. (Now cries of “faith” and “superstition” fill the air.) But wedon’t need God, either. All we need is a universe that contains consciousness asan inseparable aspect of itself. Once you grant that, then any and allobservers—divine, human, or any other kind—are expressions of self-awareness.They share the same status; each is a participant in creation. The greatopportunity for spirituality to rescue science from a blind creation is that itallows conscious beings (us) to participate in a conscious universe.But what does “participate” really mean? When a physicist like Wheeler reasonsthat in the beginning there were only probabilities, he is talking about awell-known concept in physics, the collapse of the wave function. An elementaryparticle like a photon doesn’t simply exist in time and space like a shinylittle ball hanging from the Christmas tree of the cosmos. Photons carry lightin tiny packets, but they also behave like waves. Waves extend in alldirections, forming the electromagnetic field that spans the universe. There isa probability of finding a photon anywhere in the field, but as soon as youdetect one somewhere, you don’t need a probability. The very act of observinghas transformed the wave into a particle.To me, the fact that a particle can exist in an invisible state has immenseimplications (some of them unacceptable to workaday physicists), and the mostimportant one for spirituality is this: Before the Big Bang the state of theuniverse contained all possibilities. Everything that does exist—or evercould—derives from that original state. In everyday life this doesn’t seem likea statement with practical implications, but it is. Consider your use ofEnglish. Before you pick any word to say, such as “elephant,” it is only onepossibility. You may or may not pick it. You might pick “pachyderm” instead,which exists as another possibility. But once you do pick a word, an event hasoccurred in the physical universe, and the possibilities that you might havechosen in that moment (but did not) have remained in the state of purepotential.The strange thing, so far as logic goes, is that no matter how manypossibilities turn into reality, an infinite number still remain. The visibleuniverse is only a tiny bit of what could exist. All the possibilities thatdidn’t collapse are still there, just as real as the ones that did.Consciousness works the same way. When you pick the word “elephant,” yourvocabulary still contains thousands of words that you didn’t use. The unusedwords aren’t destroyed or forgotten; they remain as possibilities. Here we are,you and I, participating in genesis right now, and in every moment. Lord Krishnasays about the process: “Curving back upon myself, I create again and again.”If the field contains everything that could possibly be, we cannot excludeconsciousness or human values. Here spirituality can enrich science. Physicsblithely dismisses the all-too-human need for the cosmos to be a meaningfulhome, a nurturing place for love, truth, compassion, hope, morality, beauty, andevery other value once ascribed to God. Since these qualities have nomathematical validity, science feels free to banish them. But in reality wepluck these values out of the universe’s infinite possibilities, just as wepluck words out of our vocabulary.Even though Roger Penrose—and almost every other senior faculty member in thefield of science—abhors the notion of a subjective universe, it doesn’t have tobe thrust upon him. Spirituality isn’t about substituting subjectivity forobjectivity. Some paranoid schizophrenics are convinced that the world willdisappear if they fall asleep, so they try to remain awake twenty-four hours aday in service to humanity. But the Buddha and the Vedic sages aren’t sayingthat’s necessary. They are saying that a primal state exists that embraces bothsubjectivity and objectivity, a premise that is totally consistent with quantumreality. Once the wave function collapses, there is a subject-object split: now“I” am looking at “a thing.” But before the subject-object split, reality is oneinfinite entity. It must be that way if all possibilities are contained in it.There is much more to say about how the human mind and the cosmic mind arelinked. Once you admit that the universe might be self-aware, there is suddenlyno mystery as to why humans are intelligent, creative, and conscious. It’s inthe air we breathe; it’s in the neighborhood where we grew up. In fact, thedomain of infinite possibilities is the closest thing to us all the time. As themystic Persian poet Rumi put it, “Look at these worlds spinning out ofnothingness. That is within your power.”Whatever the universe contains, including us, must exist in potential first. Thesource keeps tabs on creation because it is actually keeping tabs on itself.This is the role that consciousness plays, and by not recognizing it scienceblindfolds itself. From the spiritual viewpoint, the probability waves ofquantum physics inhabit the same dimension as the mind of God, which thegreatest scientists throughout history have always hoped to fathom."},{"pageContent":"[../images/00010.jpeg]LEONARDFriedrich Nietzsche wrote, “Formerly one sought the feeling of the grandeur ofman by pointing to his divine origin: this has now become a forbidden way, forat its portal stands the ape, together with other gruesome beasts, grinningknowingly as if to say: no further in this direction!” That was in 1881, tenyears after Darwin wrote The Descent of Man, in which he proposed that even thenoblest features of human beings were the result of the same processes ofrandomness and natural selection that produce the quack of the duck and theslither of the snake. Darwin’s theory of evolution has grated on people eversince he made it public with On the Origin of Species. In one early encounter,according to legend, Samuel Wilberforce, bishop of Oxford, asked T. H. Huxley, astaunch Darwin supporter, if it was “through his grandfather or grandmother thathe claimed his descent from a monkey?” Huxley is said to have answeredessentially that he would not be ashamed to have descended from an ape, butwould be ashamed to be connected to a man who argued like Wilberforce. Today,ironically, physicist Stephen Hawking, a man who has done much to banish theneed for a divine origin from our understanding of creation, has his CambridgeUniversity office on none other than Wilberforce Road. The détente is notuniversal. Plenty of scholars today, religious and otherwise, feel a need toattribute the grandeur of humanity to our special connection with the divine.Deepak calls the scientific explanation of how we got here “science’s creationmyth.” In employing such terminology he equates the careful observation andtheoretical work of science with the legends and speculations of ancientcivilizations, some of which form the basis of his own beliefs. But thatanything-goes approach is not a productive path to truth. Deepak considersdistasteful a universe in which consciousness did not exist before the arrivalof human beings. He prefers a rosy picture of a universal consciousness that hasbeen present ever since creation. However, if we don’t subscribe to theanything-goes approach, the issue is not whether a conscious universe ispreferable, but whether a conscious universe is real. Wish fulfillment shouldnot shape our worldview.What would it mean for the universe to be conscious? Scientists have a difficulttime attaching a precise definition to “consciousness,” though we all have arough idea of what the term means. One quality always included in consciousnessis self-awareness. In contrast, cerebral processes that are automatic, beyondwillful control, and of which we are not aware are considered unconscious.Experiments with mirrors seem to indicate that chimpanzees and orangutans, andeven magpies, do have some self-awareness, in that they recognize the image inthe mirror as themselves. Nematodes and fruit flies presumably don’t, soself-awareness draws a certain line among the species. Still, self-awarenessalone is a crude classifier, and most of us would like to think that the oneshanding out the bananas have at least a higher level of consciousness than thosereceiving them, so consciousness probably comes in degrees.Consciousness also varies with the state of our mind. For example, we all havenonconscious periods, occurring in what is called slow-wave, or deep, sleep. Ifyou ask normal awake people to describe what they were thinking or experiencingjust before you asked them, they can tell you. This is also true if you wakesomeone during rapid eye movement, or dreaming, sleep, though the dream mayquickly fade from memory. But if you awaken people during deep sleep they willhave nothing to report. Their minds will be blank notebooks. Indeed, recordingsof neural function during deep sleep show only activity associated withautomatic, unconscious cerebral processes.Another complication in defining consciousness is that our conscious andunconscious minds are coupled systems. There has been much recent research intothe effect of the unconscious on what we think of as conscious social behaviorand decision making. But the most vivid example of conscious actions based oninformation the conscious mind is unaware of comes from a phenomenon called“blindsight.” Blindsight results from damage to a part of the brain called theprimary visual cortex. As a consequence, people afflicted with blindsight failto consciously see anything in all or part of their field of vision, a situationthat can be confirmed through brain scans. However, we know that in those withblindsight, images picked up by the eye are nevertheless transmitted to thebrain, where, without ever reaching the level of conscious experience, theyinfluence conscious behavior. Thus, people with blindsight can reach out andtouch objects, catch objects you toss to them, distinguish smiling from angryfaces, and even, in one case, navigate an obstacle course, all without beingaware of having seen anything.We infer the consciousness of other humans, or animals, by interacting withthem. But we can’t hold up a mirror to the universe to see if it preens. If theuniverse is conscious, how can we tell? It would be like a cell of the stomachlining knowing that when it is inflamed, the individual it is part of feels theache. It is tempting to believe that consciousness (preferably a loving andcompassionate consciousness) plays a role in the physical universe. In fact,natural philosophers for centuries believed that physical laws were analogous tohuman laws, and that objects in the universe consciously obeyed those lawsbecause they wished to avoid the punishment of the gods. Even as late as theseventeenth century, the great astronomer and physicist Johannes Kepler believedthat planets followed laws of motion that were grasped by their “minds.” Butthat idea did not lead to any testable consequences, so science abandoned it.The idea of universal consciousness is equally barren, so it is best to abandonthat idea, too.Deepak says that science displays a stubborn resistance to other ways ofregarding the cosmos, but the “other ways” science resists are merely ways forwhich there is no supporting evidence. Deepak laments that “we have assignedcosmology to specialists the way we assign genes to geneticists.” But I’m sureDeepak would agree that there are some enterprises that benefit from the work ofspecialists and some that don’t. For example, we probably both think that prettymuch anyone can make peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, but if one or both ofus had to have heart surgery, we would certainly want a top-notch cardiacsurgeon to do the job. Where Deepak and I seem to disagree is that I considercosmology more like surgery, and he considers it to be sandwich making.Deepak also warns that you can’t say, “Keep out; you don’t know enough math.” Iagree that people should be free to discuss whatever intellectual issuesinterest them, but we shouldn’t confuse discussing and learning about a topicwith creating a meaningful theory about it. Anyone can speculate whether or notthe sun can go on shining like this forever, but it takes mathematics to givethe speculation substance, and to fill in details such as that in seven billionyears the sun will grow 250 times larger and swallow up the inner planets.I embrace the preeminence of mathematics in science. It allows scientists tocalculate numbers and to determine the logical consequences of scientificstatements. It also helps us make precise and unambiguous definitions. It iseasy to convince oneself of dubious ideas if the arguments one uses to supportthose ideas are built around words with wrong, vague, or multiple meanings. Infact, it is a theorem in mathematics that if you accept a false statement astrue, you can use it to show that any other false statement is true. Soprecision of language is important, and the tools of mathematics are a greathelp in ensuring that concepts are precisely defined.I agree with Deepak that mathematics is more than numbers to be crunched. Iagree that mathematics is also about orderliness, balance, harmony, logic, andabstract beauty (though it is also about randomness and disorder). Scientists donot reject Deepak’s values. We do not banish love, truth, compassion, hope,morality, and beauty from our thinking, but we do banish them from our theories.Would Deepak prefer that our equations say that the sun gets a fuzzy feelingwhen a pretty comet flies past? Should physicists punctuate their mathematicswith theorems about the emotional state of a nebula? Can we appeal to thecreativity of the universe to prove the Big Bang? Subjectivity is an importantpart of human experience, but it doesn’t mean we must incorporate love into ourtheory of the orbit of Mercury, or universal consciousness into our theory ofthe physical universe.Lord Krishna might have said “I am the field and the knower of the field,” butit is a good bet he never designed a radio. There is plenty of room in humanexperience for Lord Krishna’s teachings, but that doesn’t mean one gains byincorporating them into science. Physics proposes a universe in whichconsciousness has a place within human beings—and within other animals on Earthand possibly on other planets—but that is where nature seems to draw the line.Stephen Hawking might theorize about trillions upon trillions of otheruniverses, but he doesn’t foresee them theorizing about him. And until ourobservations of the cosmos indicate otherwise, few scientists are likely toconsider the universe a conscious entity.dy>"},{"pageContent":"[../images/00009.jpeg]IS THE UNIVERSE EVOLVING?"},{"pageContent":"[../images/00010.jpeg]DEEPAKEvolution is the club that science wielded to beat religion into the dust, andwhenever religious ideas threaten to take on new life, science rushes in tosmash them down again. These ideas include, first and foremost, the perfectionof God. According to religion, the deity didn’t need to get smarter, because Godis omniscient. He (or she) didn’t need to expand into new places, because God isomnipresent, or to increase in power, because God is omnipotent. Having declaredthe creator perfect, religion couldn’t call God’s creation imperfect; therefore,the universe didn’t need to evolve, either. But the rise of intelligent lifefrom primitive life-forms is undeniable. Physics has proven that the universeexpands, and that energy gathers into vast clumps known as stars and galaxiesthat are more organized than interstellar dust. The defeat of perfectionismseems totally justified. We live in an evolving universe.Spirituality therefore cannot get back into the game on religious terms. It hasto add something new to the concept of an evolving universe. I think it can. Ifconsciousness underlies everything in Nature, it is the force that directsevolution. If not, then evolution becomes, along with everything else, theresult of blind random activity. Physics has chosen the second assumption, whichhas led it to some glaringly false conclusions.First, science focuses on physical expansion as the basic foundation ofevolution. At the instant of the Big Bang the known universe was billions oftimes smaller than the period at the end of this sentence. Now it spans billionsof light-years. But that expansion isn’t evolution, any more than blowing up ahouse with dynamite is. The house certainly expands when you blow it up,scattering its fragments in all directions, much like the Big Bang did for theuniverse, when an unimaginable blast of energy scattered elementary particles inall directions. Yet behind the mask of matter, something more mysterious washappening.To get at the mystery, let’s follow the path a hydrogen atom might take over thethirteen billion years or so following its creation. First it drifts out intospace in a completely disorganized, random fashion, bouncing around like aninfinitesimal feather on the cosmic wind. Some atoms keep on doing this untilthey form clouds of interstellar dust. But this atom falls into a strongergravitational field and becomes a building block for a star, which takesprimitive atoms like hydrogen and helium and transforms them into heavier, morecomplex elements. Through a series of nuclear reactions our particular hydrogenatom becomes part of the element known as iron, the heaviest metal formed insidestars.The life span of this star comes to an end in the dramatic death throe known asa supernova, an enormous explosion that scatters iron atoms throughout thenearby regions of the cosmos. Our original hydrogen atom no longer exists assuch, but its component parts are being drawn toward another star, hundreds oftimes smaller: the sun.By this point in the history of the universe, the sun has already thrown offenough matter during its birth pangs that rings of dust have settled into orbitaround it. This dust is clumping into planets, and our iron atom, pulled in bygravity, joins the planet Earth. At its core, the Earth is thought to be up to70 percent molten iron, but our atom arrives late enough to settle onto thesurface of the planet, which is around 10 percent iron.Ten billion years have now passed. Many iron atoms have undergone randominteractions with various chemicals, but ours is still intact. More time passes.It finds itself drawn into a spinach leaf, which gets eaten by a human being.Then our iron atom becomes part of a molecule thousands of times more complexthan itself, a molecule that has the ability to pick up oxygen and throw it offat will: hemoglobin. Hemoglobin’s ability to perform this trick turns out to becrucial, because another molecule, this one millions of times more complex, hasmanaged to create life. It is known as DNA, and around itself DNA is gatheringthe building blocks of life, known as organic chemicals, of which hemoglobin isone of the most necessary, since without it, animals cannot convert oxygen intocells.In our story, one primal hydrogen atom has undergone incredible transformationsto get to the point where it can contribute to life on Earth, and every step ofthe way involves evolution. Since all the iron on Earth was once part of asupernova (plus some iron deposited when meteorites collided with the earlyplanet), the journey from the Big Bang can be observed and measured. Yet ouriron atom has still another transformation to undergo. It has entered thebloodstream of a human being—you or me, perhaps—to become part of a sentient,thinking creature, one that is capable of looking back on its own evolution. Infact, this sentient creature created the notion of evolution in order to explainitself to itself. A primal atom has somehow become thoughtful.I’ve taken the time to follow a single atom for 13.7 billion years because thesteps it took to arrive in my body or yours, allowing me to write this sentenceand you to read it, encompass the invisible qualities that spirituality is allabout: creativity, quantum leaps of transformation, the emergence of unexpectedproperties, and overall, an enormous display of intelligence. As evolvedcreatures, we attribute all these qualities to ourselves. So where did they comefrom? Physics claims that they came from random physical processes, but thatanswer makes no sense. At every single step of its journey, our hydrogen atomresisted randomness. It became more complex; it contributed to increased energy;finally, it made the leap to human intelligence. The iron that allows you and meto be alive and sentient is no different from the iron in a rusty sewer pipe, orin interstellar dust. Yet evolution had a different fate in mind for our atom,and spirituality claims that its fate was directed by consciousness.Consciousness-directed evolution isn’t the same as invoking a creator God.Instead, it introduces a property inherent in the cosmos: self-awareness. Thebeauty of this property is that it can include randomness; there is no need foran either/or choice. If you take a highly ordered molecule like hemoglobin,which contains thousands of perfectly arranged atoms, like thousands of dewdropson a spider web, you can examine it at finer and finer levels. As you get to thequantum level, atoms are considered clouds of probability. The dewdrops haveevaporated into a mist. Because science is reductionist, it claims that randomelectrons emerging from probability waves provide the ultimate explanation forthe visible universe, based on chance but guided by basic forces likeelectromagnetism.In spiritual terms, this is a topsy-turvy explanation. It’s very hard to get tolife on Earth starting from total chaos, much more difficult than shaking abeaker of stem cells, walking away, and then coming back to find Leonardo daVinci. Why not explain creation by what it achieves, instead of by what it canbe broken down into? The Great Pyramid of Cheops can be examined as a heap ofdifferent kinds of dust, but that doesn’t explain it, any more than breaking thehuman body down into subatomic particles explains who we are. As the notedEnglish physicist David Bohm put it, “In some sense man is a microcosm of theuniverse; therefore what man is, is a clue to the universe.” The music of Bachcan be broken down into sound waves, but once you arrive at this raw data, youlose Bach. His genius has been reduced to the same level of information as aclap of thunder or a rumbling earthquake.The great flaw of reductionism is that when it pushes out the invisible aspectsof creation, it thinks it has improved our understanding. Turning around andsaying that data is actually better than the messy, ever-changing thing we callexperience is totally wrongheaded. As the great quantum pioneer Niels Bohr putit, “Everything we call real is made of things that cannot be regarded as real.”To someone who insists that solid objects are the only real things in theuniverse, this is a fatal blow.Evolution stops short of being God. Rather, it’s the tendency for the universeto unfold along steps of increasing intelligence. A huge amount of wiggle roomis left for experimentation, side trips, detours, and sudden leaps. This fizzy,uncertain, yeasty reality has been with us since time began.Spirituality will win the struggle for the future by restoring consciousness toevolution. The next step depends on us. Human beings must break away frommaterialism if we want to keep evolving. As a species we alone can transcendbiology. In fact, the process is already well under way. We have crossed thecrucial divide. Science is proof that we have taken conscious control of our ownevolution, and so is spirituality. The guiding hand has let go, allowing us moreand more freedom. When we accept it, our participation in the universe will takea quantum leap: we will fully become cocreators of reality. Evolution isn’t thewhole of the mind of God. It is only one aspect, the one we are about to claimas our own."},{"pageContent":"[../images/00010.jpeg]LEONARDA quick way to turn science into science fiction is to play with the meaning ofits terms. When an astronomer says the sky is alive with stars, she doesn’t meanyou can trade recipes with it. So if we say, quite catchily, that “evolution isthe club that science wielded to beat religion into the dust,” and then ask ifthe universe is evolving, we’d better get straight what we mean by “evolution.”In common parlance evolution is “any process of formation or progressivechange.” In biology (the field that ostensibly used evolution to club religionto death), it means “a process that produces change in the gene pool of agroup—via mechanisms such as mutation and natural selection—that is heritablefrom one generation to the next.” There are two differences in thesedefinitions. First, the scientific meaning of evolution refers to a specificchange, an alteration in the genes of a group of organisms. Second, it specifiesthe mechanism of change. Natural selection is a process in which organismsbetter able to cope with their environment tend to have more offspring, whichcreates a new generation that on average has more traits favorable to survivaland reproduction than the last.Natural selection is what makes evolution more than just a random process. Ifyou ignore it, you can indeed make the theory of evolution appear absurd andfar-fetched. For example, Deepak writes that “creation without consciousness islike the fabled roomful of monkeys randomly striking keys on a typewriter untilthey wind up, millions of years later, writing the complete works ofShakespeare.” He tells about a researcher who arranged to have “a random-numbergenerator (an updated monkey) spew out letters to see if sensible words wouldemerge.” Since it took countless tries to form even a simple phrase, and sincehuman DNA is thousands of times more complex in its structure than the lettersconstituting Shakespeare’s works, Deepak concludes that the theory of evolutioncould not possibly account for the structure of our DNA. That random-typingexperiment is typical of the kind of misleading arguments that arise when youignore natural selection. Richard Dawkins addressed it in his book The BlindWatchmaker. He described a computer program he wrote, which included a mechanismanalogous to natural selection. Setting it in motion, he waited to see how longit would take for the program to arrive at Shakespeare’s phrase “Methinks it islike a weasel” through random typing in a manner that mimics evolution. In thepurely random model Deepak described, the chance of typing the entire phrasecorrectly is one in ten thousand billion billion billion billion, so a computercould generate random string after random string in this manner until the sunburns out and still never hit upon the target phrase. But by incorporatingnatural selection into his random-typing program, Dawkins showed that the phrasecould be produced in just forty-three generations—a mere moment or two on adecent computer. That is the magnitude of the error that can arise if one is notcareful about the precise definition of concepts in science!One cannot apply the Darwinian concept of evolution to the universe as a whole,because concepts like heredity and natural selection—by which individuals lessable to survive their environment die out and the gene pools of those that aremore fit prevail—make no sense in that context. A cloud that changes shape froman elephant to the face of Jesus cannot be thought of as evolving according tothe biological meaning of the word. Nor can a spinning cloud of interstellardust and gas that flattens and condenses into a star and planets. Such a systemcan be said to be evolving in the sense of everyday language, and physicistsmight on occasion use the word in that sense, but its progression has nothing todo with the theory of evolution that “beat religion into the dust.” So is theuniverse evolving? The universe is undergoing progressive change, but that isnot evolution in the sense that Darwin made his name on.Having locked Darwin in the basement for now, we can deal with the real issue.Is the universe evolving, in the colloquial sense, toward greater complexity andintelligence? And, if so, is there evidence that the trend is the result of aguiding force such as consciousness? Is the march of the cosmos an evolutiontoward something higher? Have scientists overlooked the existence of meaningfulprogressive change in this universe that is our home?The answer is, again, no. In later chapters we’ll see that even biologicalevolution does not have any “innate” drive toward intelligence and complexity,but as regards the physical universe, the opposite is in fact true: theuniverse, I am sorry to say, is heading toward a simple and lifeless end.Why is that the future of the universe? As I explained earlier, the universe isexpanding. That expansion will continue at an ever-increasing rate. As thathappens, the matter and energy within the universe will grow ever colder andmore dilute. Distant galaxies will eventually move so far away that we will nolonger be able to detect them. Eventually all that will remain in our observableuniverse will be our local group of galaxies, bound to us, if weakly, bygravity. Astronomers living then could conclude that our galaxy, and perhaps afew neighbors, are all that there is in the universe, or ever was. They mighthave no way of knowing the rich history that preceded.Sadly, those isolated worlds, too, will eventually end, for stars burn out. Theycan end their life cycle in different ways: they can collapse into black holesor neutron stars; they can fade like glowing embers, becoming a type of starcalled a white dwarf; or they can explode as supernovas. In the last case, newstars and solar systems can form from interstellar gas and debris, leading tonew life, but with time supernova explosions will become rarer, and eventuallycease, and the reservoir of interstellar gas will become dilute and “dry up.”When that happens the universe will consist of just the corpses of dead stars:white dwarfs, black holes (which will eventually “evaporate”), and neutronstars. None of these can sustain life, so the universe will then be utterlydead. And if physicists who believe the proton is unstable are correct, eventhese corpses will break up and dissipate, leaving a universe that is nothingmore than a thin gas of particles within a vast void. This may seem to be adepressing picture, but as my mother told me when I was three and learned thatpeople die—don’t worry, the death of the universe is a long time off. Perhaps asmany as 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 years.If Deepak is right that the universe is purposefully becoming ever more complex,then the picture I just painted is wrong, and some of the most fundamental andwell-tested principles of physics are also wrong. But if this picture iscorrect, if the development of the universe is not purposeful, and not evolvingtoward ever greater complexity, then how do we interpret Deepak’s story of thelone hydrogen nucleus, born in the early universe, improving its lot by becomingpart of that princely metal, iron, and eventually making its way into aconscious human being? How could such an unlikely event happen? Could it reallyoccur through random processes?Beautiful and ordered objects arise from the purposeless laws of nature all thetime, from rainbows to snowflakes. But human beings are predisposed to searchfor patterns and, once we’ve found them, to assume they are born of good cause.We don’t need to look to cosmology to be fooled by randomness. In The Drunkard’sWalk I wrote about the case of a mutual fund manager named William Miller. Hebecame famous for running a fund that outperformed the Standard and Poor’s indexfor fifteen years straight. Thousands of mutual fund managers over severaldecades were all trying to accomplish that feat, but only one manager did it.Even to many who think that stock picking is of marginal value at best, itseemed that feat could have been accomplished only through a relentlesslybrilliant knack for anticipating the futures of individual stocks, and investingaccordingly. But the mathematics of probability yields a surprising result: ifyou replace those thousands of managers with gamblers who simply flip a coinonce each year with the goal that it come up heads, you’ll find that the chancesare very high that one of those gamblers, too, will have a streak of fifteen ormore successful years. William Miller’s much-heralded feat, it turns out, couldindeed have resulted from randomness alone.The story of the “evolving” hydrogen atom is analogous: our awe in the face ofthe unlikeliness of a rare feat can be neutralized by knowledge of the greatnumber of opportunities for such a feat to be accomplished. Supernovas, forexample, are extremely unlikely events. If you pick a typical galaxy of, say, ahundred billion stars, you’d have to stare at it on average for an entirecentury before you’d see one of those stars explode. Yet if you hold your armout and block a patch of sky with your thumbnail, there are so many galaxies inthat patch that, with a sufficiently powerful telescope, you’d see tensupernovas each night. Rare events happen all the time.In the case of the proton, there are roughly 1080 bouncing around in theobservable universe, only a very tiny fraction of which end up a cog in somelife-form. In fact, on Earth there are about 1042 protons in the biomass, soeven if we assume that every star in the observable universe has its ownlife-friendly Earth—and probably few actually do—we find that for every protonthat stumbles its way into a living organism, there are at least10,000,000,000,000,000 protons stumbling around that don’t. Just as once in ablue moon a coin flipper can achieve fifteen heads in a row, on very rareoccasions, without the intervention of any conscious force, so too can a protonend up, not in a star, or in interstellar space, but inside a living thing.Science doesn’t say that nature shook a beaker of stem cells, walked away, andcame back to find Leonardo da Vinci. It says she sent matter into a billiontrillion star systems, let it brew for 13.7 billion years, and then produced aLeonardo da Vinci. The former is indeed far-fetched; the latter is the beautifulconsequence of the unguided and purposeless forces of nature.If scientists describe the universe through laws that act without purpose, it’snot because we oppose an intentional universe; it’s because we don’t appear tolive in one. It can be inspiring to believe the universe is evolving towardgreater complexity and intelligence under the guidance of a universalconsciousness. But for scientists, such musings are not where the investigationends; they are where it begins. Deepak attacks science’s use of reductionism asan approach to understanding the universe, but scientists are not wed to asingle method. When a phenomenon can be easily explained by reducing it to itssimpler elements, scientists do that. When it cannot, when it depends on thecollective interactions of a great number of components, we recognize that, too.Thus, when chemists study the properties of water, they analyze its molecularcomponents. But when oceanographers study waves, they are not interested indealing with the finer constituents of the water. Science has theories of watermolecules, and theories of water waves, and having one does not exclude havingthe other. The end of an investigation comes when, regardless of an idea’sattractiveness, we are able to find evidence to prove it either right or wrong.If the universe evolved through physical law and had no guiding purpose, noconsciousness, does that negate the value of humankind, or make our livesmeaningless? Is the scientific view a heartless view of life? My mother, nowalmost ninety, told me once of a cold day when she was about seventeen, and thewar was raging in Europe. Her town in Poland was occupied by the Nazis, and onthis day one of those Nazis told a few dozen of the town’s Jews, including mymother, to line up in a row and kneel in the snow. He walked the row and, everyfew steps, leaned down, put his gun to someone’s head, and fired. The spiritualview says that my mother’s survival was not random. It says my mother was passedover for a reason. Does this not imply that there was also a cosmic reason thatthose not passed over were slaughtered? Since most of the members of my parents’families were killed during the Holocaust, to me it is this “spiritual”explanation that feels cold and heartless.Science offers a different view: The human animal evolved to have the capacityfor both good and evil, and it does plenty of both, but there is no hidden handof universal purpose or consciousness behind what we do, only our ownconsciousness, our own purpose. Each of us chooses love or hate; we give and wetake; we leave our own imprint on our family, our friends, and society. We don’tneed an eternal and conscious universe to give our lives meaning. Our lives areas meaningful as we make them.dy>"},{"pageContent":"[../images/00009.jpeg]WHAT IS THE NATURE OF TIME?"},{"pageContent":"[../images/00010.jpeg]LEONARDA few years ago researchers interested in the subjective perception of timearranged to have volunteers harnessed to a platform, raised a hundred feet intothe air, and dropped into a net at an amusement park in Dallas, Texas. Beforeany of the twenty participants had a turn, they observed someone else beingdropped. After this preview they were asked to shut their eyes and imagine thefall. They were told to press a button at the moment when they pictured theperson beginning to drop, and again when they pictured the person landing. Theneach subject took the plunge themselves. Afterward, they were asked to imaginetheir own fall and as before to press a button at the beginning and the end. Thesubjects’ mental playbacks of their own experience lasted significantly longerthan both their imagined experience of others, and the actual experience. Theresearchers had expected this because people who have endured brief dangerousevents, such as violent attacks and car accidents, often report that the eventsseem to have occurred in slow motion. But our memory of an event depends on twoneural systems—that governing our perception of the event, and that governingits recording and recall from our memory. So one might ask, Do we reallyperceive dangerous events in slow motion, or do we just remember them that way?Do we have a single sense of time that becomes distorted, or does the clock ofour perception of the event run at its usual pace, but the clock of our memoryof the event slow down?To investigate that issue the subjects were given a wristwatch that flashedrandom numbers and told to read the digits during their fall. The catch was thatthe digits flashed just a bit too quickly for them to make out—that is, too fastto make out in ordinary circumstances. If the stretching of time that affectsthe memory of such events also affects perception, the falling subjects wouldsee the numbers as flashing more slowly, and be able to read them. But thesubjects couldn’t read the numbers. Their memories recorded the events in slowmotion but their perception clock was unaltered.Perception and memory clocks are not our only measure of time. We seem to havemany internal clocks, underpinned by different neural mechanisms. Much of ourfeeling for time comes from the clocks built into our bodies and visible in ourenvironment. The principal clock in our environment, the rhythm of day andnight, light and dark, is intimately connected to at least one clock in ourbodies, the circadian rhythm. Living things—even unicellular organisms—have thisbiological rhythm that runs on a sleeping and waking cycle of about one day. Inmany animals this is governed by a biochemical process in which certain proteinsaccumulate, enter cell nuclei, degrade, and cycle back to their original state.The process is more complex in humans, and takes place in a part of our braincalled the hypothalamus. In all animals the twenty-four-hour clock is onlyapproximate. Human beings living in total darkness will have sleep/waking cycleslasting about twenty-five hours, while mice and fruit flies kept in darknesshave cycles that are somewhat less than twenty-four. But under normalconditions, these biological clocks are reset each day, in humans whenphotoreceptors in the eyes and skin cells pick up light from the sun. Animalshave other built-in bodily rhythms that run on much shorter cycles, such as thein and out of respiration and the pumping of our hearts, as well as certain wavepatterns that occur in our brains. It is through all these internal clocks thatwe feel the passage of time.The multiplicity of biological clocks leads to some interesting illusions—forexample, in one experiment subjects were fooled into thinking that a flash oflight preceded their pressing a key when actually it came afterward. Biologistsand neuroscientists are interested in understanding the subjective aspects ofour sense of time, and the physical, chemical, and biological mechanisms thatproduce them, and indeed these are fascinating topics. But although your ownmemory clock might slow when you’re tossed off a platform, for the rest of theuniverse it is business as usual. And so physicists, unlike biologists andneuroscientists, or saints and sages, ponder time’s mysteries from a lesspersonal standpoint.The starting point for physicists is to examine what we mean by time. Humanlanguage excels at capturing human feelings, but we shouldn’t let our languagedefine our concept of reality. If you haven’t thought much about it, time ishard to define. It is an abstract concept derived and distilled from ourexperience. We describe the motion of projectiles and planets employing time,but time isn’t a material object. One can think of time as one thinks of space,as a coordinate that enables us to label events. The event of the opening of theheliport atop the World Trade Center has the coordinates 40 degrees 43 minutesnorth latitude, 74 degrees 1 minute west longitude, 1,350 feet above groundlevel, and the year 1972. From this point of view we can consider the universeas a four-dimensional space akin to the three-dimensional space we see aroundus. But time not only labels the moments events take place and orders them; italso assigns events a duration.One of the first clocks used in physics, at least according to legend, was thepulse of Galileo, who used that rhythm to time the swing of a chandelier in thecathedral of Pisa. Today we use more reliable clocks, like the naturaloscillations of atoms. For example, when an atom jumps from a higher energystate to a lower energy state, radiation is emitted. That radiation oscillateswith a frequency determined by the difference in energy between the states. Theradiation corresponding to the transition between two particular energy levelsof the cesium-133 atom passes through exactly 9,192,631,770 cycles each second.I can say “exactly” here with confidence because since 1967 that has been,according to the International System of Units, the definition of a second. Andso if we say the crystal in a quartz watch vibrates 32,768 times per second, wemean that if we started counting the oscillations of the crystal and theradiation simultaneously, at the precise moment the cesium radiation had gonethrough 9,192,631,770 cycles, the quartz crystal would be reaching its 32,768thvibration. This highlights an important related concept that is crucial to thedefinition of time as duration: the concept of synchrony. We measure the timeone process takes by comparing it to some other standard process—like the ticksof a stopwatch—that has a concurrent beginning and ending.This nice intuitive picture of time works well in everyday life, but between1905 and 1916, Albert Einstein showed that it is only an approximation of theway nature really works. The approximation is perfectly fine if you don’tmeasure time too accurately, and you consider objects that are moving muchslower than the speed of light, and that are in gravitational fields not muchstronger than those we experience on Earth. But in truth, Einstein showed, thoseconcepts upon which our ideas of clocks are based, especially synchrony, andeven the fixed order of events, depend on the state of the observer—by which hedid not mean the emotional state.The fact that two events one perceives as simultaneous can, from the perspectiveof another observer, occur at different times, probably sounds somewhere betweenstrange and wrong. It might help to look at the same effect with regard tospace. Suppose a person standing in the aisle of an airplane bounces a ball onthe floor. That passenger would report that the ball hit the floor at the samespot, over and over again. To an observer on the ground, however, the ball wouldnot be returning to the same spot, but rather tracing a line across the sky atover 500 miles per hour. Both observers are right, from their own perspective.Analogously, different observers may disagree about whether events happen at thesame time, and if the observers are moving fast enough relative to each other,that disparity can be noticeable. This is an important point for our laterdiscussion of the nature of reality, so we’ll come back to it then.The inability of moving observers to agree on simultaneity means that clocks candisagree, and that different observers can disagree on the duration of events.The referees working for the Guinness World Records 2010 watched as the world’sfastest hot dog eater downed sixty-six hot dogs in twelve minutes, but observersflying past at great speed would have measured the feast as having taken muchlonger. According to relativity, each clock measures its own local flow of time,and observers who are moving relative to each other, or are experiencingdiffering gravitational fields, will in general find that their clocks do notagree.One can think of a clock as a kind of odometer for time. An odometer measuresthe distance you travel in journeying from one event to another, while a clockmeasures the duration that elapses between events. The distance an odometermeasures depends on both the difference in the spatial coordinates of the twoevents—such as their latitude and longitude—and the path the odometer takes toget from one event to the other. According to relativity, the time a clock willmeasure between events also depends on the path the clock takes between theevents. For example, suppose two fifteen-year-old twins watched the World TradeCenter dedication in 1972, after which one was snatched up by aliens and whiskedoff on a very fast rocket ride, perhaps even passing near (but not too near) thepowerful gravitational field of a black hole. If the abducted twin was returnedto Earth and reunited with her sister at the dedication of a World Trade CenterMemorial in 2013, the Earthbound sister would be fifty-six while the abductedtwin might be just sixteen. Between the abduction and the reunion the odometerof the Earthbound twin would have registered many miles, and her clock anelapsed time of forty-one years. Her sister’s odometer would have registeredmany more miles—but her clock, perhaps only one year—between the same twoevents. Einstein showed that there is no contradiction in this; it is just theway time works. This effect was confirmed by experiment in 1971, in which a veryaccurate atomic clock was flown around the world and compared to an identicalearthbound clock. The effect of the clock’s motion at those relatively slowspeeds, however, amounted to a difference of only about 180 billionths of asecond per circuit.Since an hour spent in a moonlight stroll with a loved one does not feel thesame as an hour spent justifying your work to a nasty boss, we are lucky to haveour reliable cesium atoms, whose light will pass through 33,093,474,372,000cycles each hour regardless of our state of mind. Though the biologist, theneuroscientist, and the physicist will all conclude that time depends on theobserver, they mean it in different ways. To a physicist, time depends only onmotion and gravity, and we have mathematical formulas that account for therelevant factors. These allow physicists to translate back and forth amongdifferent observers’ clocks, without any bias that might arise from theobservers’ feelings entering into the physicists’ formulas.When we humans slow down to smell the roses, the betadamascenone molecules thatcarry the smell continue their motion unaffected by our subjective feelings. Butwhen the Earth exerts its gravitational pull, it does affect the clocks in theGPS systems that tell you how to get to the nearest florist. That’s how natureworks, and it is nature’s gift—random as it may have been—that we evolved intobeings with minds that can comprehend the difference."},{"pageContent":"[../images/00010.jpeg]DEEPAKEternity is in love with the productions of time.—WILLIAM BLAKETime gives spirituality a golden opportunity. People need a new way to livewhere time hasn’t become a kind of psychological enemy. Deadlines press upon us.There are only so many hours in the day. No matter how fast we move, all of usare running out of time. Religion hasn’t helped, because it tends to be grimabout our time on Earth. What could be more depressing than the Puritan doctrineof “Sin in haste, repent at leisure”? If spirituality can free us from time’spsychological downside, everyday life would be transformed.Leonard is at pains to precisely define and measure time. He also hits upon afavorite point made by science, that subjectivity is unreliable. If you are aphysicist collecting data on hadrons, bosons, and the like, you don’t get tosay, “My measurement changed because I have a migraine.” But people don’t usesubjectivity to measure time; we use it to experience time. There is no otherway. Time in all its aspects comes to us through our nervous system, as anexperience in consciousness. Being conscious of time isn’t abstract andobjective. It’s personal and participatory. And once we know how we participatein time, we will have an important clue about how to participate in thetimeless.The timeless? At this point I can imagine a wave of doubt coming from thereader, even a sympathetic reader. I’m not challenging the accuracy of thecesium-133 atomic clock, because there is no need to do so. Any aspect of time,including Einstein’s relative time, is a by-product of the timeless; in thepreuniverse there is no time. Our very source is the realm of timelessness. Thestory of how time sprang from eternity is the real mystery, and it’s one thatspirituality can solve. When you and I can experience the timeless, then phraseslike “eternal life,” “the immortal soul,” and “a transcendent God” aren’t justwishful thinking. When we look at it closely, eternity doesn’t mean a long,long, long time. It means a reality where time is not present. But how do weactually get there?Let’s establish a point where spirituality and science agree. Time is relative.It isn’t fixed. We don’t need Einstein to confirm this, because everyday lifealready does. Depending on the state of consciousness you are in, the flow oftime changes. In deep sleep there is no experience of time. In dreams, time iscompletely fluid: an epoch can pass in a moment, or a passing moment can last anepoch. (A story about the Buddha has it that he shut his eyes for a few moments,and yet inside he was experiencing thousands of years past.) Leonard stepped offthis train before it left the station. He argues that time coming to us “throughour senses” isn’t the same as “the workings of the inanimate universe.” Butthere is much more to consciousness than the five senses. Birds, bees, and snowleopards would see a mountain, the sky, or the moon in different ways becausethose creatures possess unique nervous systems.If you change the nervous system, the idea of objectivity breaks down. Thisholds true not just for animals but for us, too. In recent experiments Buddhistmonks were shown to have brain waves in the gamma region that were twice as fastas the norm: 80 cycles per second instead of 40 cycles. Gamma waves are thoughtto be the brain’s way of holding the world together as a conscious experience.So Buddhist monks, by receiving twice the number of signals per second, aretwice as awake, or conscious. Other people, operating on half-wakefulness, aresleepy and dull by comparison.We can match this finding to other experiences. Quarterback Joe Namath reportedthat when he was “in the zone,” time seemed to stand still. The ball left hishand as if in slow motion, while at the same time the roar of the crowddisappeared, and he knew, with certainty, exactly where the ball would go; heeven knew it would be caught. In other words, time cannot be detached frompersonal experience, which in turn means that no two people experience time inexactly the same way.Subjective time, far from being an illusion, meshes quite well withpost-Newtonian physics, where the notion of an objective observer was undercutlong ago by relativity. If a space traveler’s starship begins traveling near thespeed of light, his time, as observed by someone standing back on Earth, slowsdown. This is a basic principle in relativity. Yet even as time became slowerthan molasses on a winter’s day, as observed from Earth, the space travelerwould register the clocks around him ticking off seconds, minutes, and hours innormal fashion. Likewise, since the gravitational field gets more and morepowerful in the vicinity of a black hole, a faraway observer would see a spacetraveler’s time seem to slow down until it virtually stopped altogether as thetraveler approached the black hole’s horizon—he would appear to take an infiniteamount of time to cross that horizon and enter the hole. However, relativity issecondary to my main point, that some kind of nervous system is inescapable, andtherefore so is the central role of experience. Science may not care, inobjective terms, if Joe Namath felt time slow down; the timekeeper’s watch saysit didn’t. It’s up to me, then, to show how subjectivity is actually reliable.In India’s spiritual tradition the zero state of consciousness is referred to assamadhi, where the mind enters pure consciousness. This state is an experienceof an eternal timeless now. Here time does not exist as a measurable event. Onlyafter pure consciousness splits into subject and object do we experience theflow of time.Once again the findings of great sages mesh with quantum reality. (I apologizefor giving the impression that all sages are either Indian or ancient. Theycover the span of time, East and West. I give special weight to the ancientsonly because their spiritual observations have passed the test of time—whatevertime turns out to be!) The underlying state of the universe is timeless. Beforethe first nanosecond of the Big Bang, there was only the potential for time in adimension of all possibilities, after which quantum objects (e.g., energy, spin,charge, gravity) emerged. A potential doesn’t have a life span. It encompassespast, present, and future. The ground state of physics turns out to resemble thezero state of samadhi. Once these timeless possibilities begin to collapse intospace-time events, our connection to eternity seems lost. That is an illusion,though, fostered by our dependence on clock time. You have always been eternal;you still are.There is certainly a huge objection to the claim that we can experienceeternity. How can the human mind think about the timeless when thoughts taketime? Everything human takes time, from being born to lying on one’s deathbed.But the great sages noticed that the movement of thought is critical to time. Ifthoughts stop moving, so does time. We’ve all had a hint of this. When you say,“Sorry, I blanked out for a second,” you weren’t participating in time: theclock stopped. The Buddha took a more radical stance. He (and many otherspiritual teachers) declared that when the mind stops, everything comes to ahalt. It’s not just time that is the movement of thought—the whole universe isthe movement of thought.Take this insight seriously and you wind up with an earthshaking idea: the stateof precreation thinks itself into becoming the universe. Infinity transformsitself into the finite. Using whatever vocabulary you prefer, a silent mind(belonging to God, Brahman, nirvana, the absolute) creates physical realitythrough a thought, because without a vibration or frequency, time cannot begin.The same is true of space. Without some kind of vibration, there is no Big Bang,no expanding universe.Vibrations emerge from a silent, motionless source. Then, as time enterscreation, it is adapted to whatever nervous system uses it, including our own.Snails, for example, have a neural network that experiences time in wideintervals, as long as five seconds, as if a snail is seeing the world in aseries of snapshots taken five seconds apart. If you reach down and snatch alettuce leaf away from a snail fast enough, the hungry creature will experiencethe leaf vanishing into thin air. A snail can’t make time speed up, but wehumans have a special capacity: we can experience time at different speeds. Manyversions of time are available to us, not just steady forward motion measured bythe clock. We see the past repeat itself; we observe the cycle of life; we cantake our imagination forward or backward; we feel time hang heavy, speed up, andeven stop.Medical doctors worry about “time sickness,” a generic term for disordersresulting from the speed of modern life. Too much speed leads to stress, whichin turn leads to the higher levels of stress hormones connected to manylifestyle disorders, like heart attacks and hypertension. Time literally runsout for a certain percentage of the newly widowed, or the chronically lonely,for whom time is such a burden that they run the risk of premature death. That’swhy it is so important not to merely describe time, as science does, but tounderstand it.Changing your sense of self can give you more time, and improve its quality. Alot of research has been done on telomerase, a specific protein that seems tohelp cells live longer. The underlying theory is that telomerase keeps genesfrom unraveling and undergoing damaging mutations, so increased levels oftelomerase may have a beneficial effect. Studies have shown that telomeraseincreases with positive lifestyle changes, and more than that, a person’s senseof well-being—particularly the positive psychological changes brought about bymeditation—promotes telomerase activity. (A coauthor of this study from 2010 wasDr. Elizabeth Blackburn, professor at the University of California, SanFrancisco, who shared the Nobel Prize in Medicine for the discovery oftelomerase.) Just as we can alter the way we metabolize food, we have controlover how we metabolize all experiences, even one as abstract as time.It boils down to this: Human beings stand on the cusp between time and thetimeless. We are a lamp at the door, to use an ancient Vedic image. At anymoment we can look into the manifest or the unmanifest, the visible or theinvisible, the world of time or the infinite expanse of eternity. Once we escapethe mind-made trap science has unwittingly laid, we find ourselves grantedenormous freedom and power, but this mastery over Nature is not an endorsementof the use of blunt force. Instead of coercing the physical world to do ourbidding, we can use consciousness to achieve anything at all. Once our minds cantravel back to the source, we recognize ourselves as part of the creativeprocess that gives rise to space, time, and the physical universe. Here is thetrue power of now.dy>"},{"pageContent":"[../images/00009.jpeg]IS THE UNIVERSE ALIVE?"},{"pageContent":"[../images/00010.jpeg]DEEPAKThe possibility that we live in a universe that has a life of its own hasintrigued human beings for centuries. Religion tells us that the universe isimbued with the divine force of the Creator; therefore it is alive. But I’mresponsible for revisiting every concept with a mind that takes both science andspirituality seriously. This isn’t easy, since science takes the position thatthe first primitive life-forms emerged 3.8 billion years ago, which is the sameas saying that the Earth—and the universe—was dead before that moment. Why is itso necessary to make death the foundation of life, as if it is more real? That’swhat science insists upon.Even more real than death, however, is flux. The cosmos is part of anever-ending process that recycles matter and energy. Nothing has a fixedidentity: not a star, a galaxy, an electron, or a person—not you or me. Nothing,then, is truly dead. This isn’t just philosophy but an observable truth. Everyatom in your body came from an exploding supernova or interstellar gases; youand I are made of stardust. Our lives extend far beyond what happens to uspersonally, and at a subtler level, Nature is also recycling information andmemory. Every time a cell divides, it must remember how to do that from thecells that came before it, which means that the molecules that produce enzymesand proteins inside a cell are programmed with the information, or code, forwhat to do.You are the embodiment of a dynamic universe, which means you extend far beyondsuch narrow identities as “I am a Caucasian male” or “I am forty and happilymarried.” Seeing yourself in any bounded way is illusory, just a wisp of thoughtdrifting by in an eternal continuum. Spirituality provides a way to knowyourself beyond the personal, which leads to enlightenment. I know this soundslofty. To bring it down to earth, we need to build an argument on crediblefacts. The first fact is the one we’ve just discussed, that the universe is aliving process, despite claims to the contrary.Obviously we witness physical aspects of death all around us. But to equate thatwith death itself is shortsighted. Science and spirituality come to a decisivebreak in this regard, because science defines death in purely physical terms.Without a space suit, a human being (or any living thing, presumably) would diein the freezing vacuum of outer space within seconds. This fact, however, isirrelevant in determining whether the cosmos is animate. What’s at stake indeciding between a dead universe and a living one is consciousness. If thecosmos is self-aware, as I’ve argued, it is alive.Discovering consciousness in the universe is much more momentous thandiscovering gravity, although science doesn’t seem to think so. There are goodreasons for this resistance. In the materialistic scheme, matter must precedethe emergence of life. The universe must be considered dead before DNA appeared.Even so, it seems like a miracle—or the remotest chance in the universe—that DNAlearned to reproduce itself, a molecule that somehow reaches down and unzipsitself into identical mirror images. No molecule had that ability before DNAappeared (although crystals are capable of simple replication, as children learnwhen they dip a string into a saturated sugar solution and watch sugar crystalsbegin to form on it, like stalactites in a cave). Spirituality doesn’t need amiracle to explain life once the concept of a dead universe is discarded. What Iwant is to shed light, not make the case for magic. Far stronger is the argumentthat the universe gave rise to complex life because life has always existed,going back to the precreation state.A cell that grows and multiplies looks much like a robot that has learned tobuild itself. Such a robot is logically impossible without a creator, sincesomebody or something had to assemble the first robot and program it. I applythe same logic to the cosmos. It creates itself, and if that is physicallyimpossible without some kind of programming, then the miracle that DNA pullsoff—self-replication—must be only one aspect of the cosmic program. At everysecond the universe disappears into the void and returns by re-creating itself.Physics explains this rebirth by pointing to the laws that govern the universe:they act like the meshed gears of a grandfather clock, only in this case thegears are invisible.I am arguing that the recipe for life on Earth is wrapped up in the underlyingexistence of cosmic self-creation. The technical term used is “autopoiesis,”literally “auto” (self) combined with the Greek word meaning “to make.” No onecan deny that the universe creates and maintains itself, just as a parameciumdoes as it floats on a pond in the sunlight.On a cellular level each paramecium isn’t a descendant of the first one thatevolved billions of years ago: it is that first one. Completely identicalversions are made by cell division, adding and subtracting nothing. It is truethat new raw materials have to be collected to construct each generation ofparamecia (and mutations may occur along the way, most dying out), but that issecondary. Life is like a house that keeps standing, looking the same from dayto day, even though each brick is constantly being changed out for a new one.Food and air constantly fly in and out of every living cell, but somethingremains intact.I can choose to call this invisible organizing power “life,” but a specificexplanation emerges only when we look more closely at autopoiesis, orself-creation. Four elements are involved, and I apologize in advance for howtechnical they sound. To be self-creating, you need:1. A mechanism that is unified, with the ability to build itself2. Component parts that self-organize into that mechanism3. A network of processes that can transform themselves into anything theunified mechanism requires4. A self-contained space that doesn’t depend on an outside causeThis is much more abstract than saying “We reside in a living universe,”although that is the conclusion to which these four requirements lead. Let mebreak them down by looking at an embryo gestating in the womb. The embryo isunified—we see one cell dividing into two, four, eight, sixteen, and so on,through fifty replications, all tending to the same goal: a baby. It grows asits components (food, air, and water) come together to serve the common goal. Anetwork of processes constructs each cell, leading to another network that turnsstem cells into specialized heart, liver, and brain cells. Finally, there is noneed for an outside cause. The fertilized ovum can be put into a test tube, andeven in such sterile isolation from the mother, as long as the first threecomponents are provided for, a baby will begin to grow.A skeptic will argue that the universe doesn’t work this way. It only looks likea living organism. By analogy, the sugar crystals growing on a string when it isdipped into a saturated sugar solution aren’t alive, even though they grow andreproduce. But autopoiesis can’t be compared to crystals. The universe had nogrowing medium, no equivalent of a sugar solution. It created itself out ofnothingness. Self-creation simply changes its costume when a baby is born. Ababy, a galaxy, a photon, and the ecology of the rain forest look nothing alike,yet when you examine life at the deepest level, nothingness is creating everyaspect of the living universe. Life is the universe’s way of inventing eyes andears to see and hear itself. The human brain is an observation deck for thecosmos to experience itself.If you follow this path of inquiry, there is abundant evidence that thepotential for complex life-forms has been embedded in the cosmos from thebeginning. Since we will be discussing life at greater length in upcomingchapters, I will only offer a summary here in order to set the stage.The universe can be understood as a living thing because of:1. Autopoiesis: Any living thing grows from within.2. Wholeness: Living things function as a single process, unifying many separateparts.3. Consciousness: Living things, whether primitive or complex, exhibitawareness. Unlike inert chemicals, they respond to the environment.4. Life cycle: Living things pass from birth to death, and in between theysustain themselves.5. Spontaneous reproduction: Living things multiply and gather into populations.Within these populations there is a relationship among the individual members.6. Creativity: Living things evolve; they don’t mechanically reproduce clones.Thus we see a display of constant creativity.7. Manifestation: An animate organism takes abstract ingredients and projectsthem into space-time, like a living hologram. These projections can be seen;they communicate; they enter the dance of life. When you break down any livingthing, including the universe, you arrive at the abstract level again. Along theway, the spark of life seems to vanish. Examined under a microscope powerfulenough to reveal molecular structure, living tissue can be reduced to inertchemicals. In reality, however, the spark of life didn’t go out, because therewas never a spark to lose. Life is in the void, too, but so abstractly that ittakes a hologram—like you or me—to manifest it.From a spiritual perspective, asking whether the universe is hospitable to lifeis a meaningless question. The universe and life are the same. We cannot befooled by the mask of materialism. Behind the mask, the dancer is the dance,ever and always."},{"pageContent":"[../images/00010.jpeg]LEONARDIn 1944 psychologists Fritz Heider and Marianne Simmel made a short filmfeaturing a circle, a large triangle, and a small triangle. The action involvesthese geometric figures chasing each other around until a final scene in whichone moves offscreen and another breaks apart. You might think that such a moviewould have the emotional resonance of a text on Euclidean geometry. But whenSimmel and Heider asked subjects who had viewed the film to “write down whathappened,” the subjects made it sound like Academy Award material, interpretingthe geometric figures as people, assigning the inanimate figures humanmotivations, and inventing a plot to explain the figures’ movements. People likea good story enough to read one into just about anything. We anthropomorphizeeverything from cats and dogs to cars and, apparently, even our geometry, soit’s easy to understand why a metaphysical theory about a universe that livesand thinks appeals to us.Deepak offers an attractive story in which equating the physical aspect of deathwith the end of life is said to be “shortsighted,” for we are all part of auniverse that is “self-aware” and therefore “alive.” In order for the statementthat the universe is a living entity to have meaning, we must understand what itmeans for something to be alive. One can say that a piece of toast is alive, buttry getting it to butter itself. A rock could be called alive, but chances areyou’ll never see one give birth. Usually when we think of something as alive, wemean at a minimum that it reacts to its environment and is capable ofreproduction. What do these criteria mean when we speak of the universe?Deepak lists seven requirements for life that he says the universe satisfies.First on the list is growth. Does the universe grow? To grow means to increasein size or substance. The universe is not increasing in substance, andphysicists believe it is infinite, so the size issue is a subtle one. But if youplace any boundary within the universe, that region will grow because, as Iexplained earlier, space is expanding. So the requirement of growth can be saidto be satisfied. His second criterion, wholeness, requires that a living thingfunction as a unit. That’s a squishy requirement. Pick your favorite sportsteam. Does it function as a unit? A good one does, a bad one doesn’t, andcoaches, writers, and fans can argue endlessly without coming to any definitiveconclusion. But the universe by definition includes everything, so it would behard to argue that the universe doesn’t satisfy “wholeness.” The life cyclerequirement, that living things pass from birth to death, is satisfied by allobjects that don’t last for an eternity. The birth of a child is not the same asthe birth of a chocolate cake, but still, one might say the universe alsosatisfies this criterion. On the other hand, most mainstream physicists wouldnot say that the requirement of reproduction is satisfied. One might considerleaving this as an open question, since some untested and highly speculativemodels in cosmology—like the so-called ekpyrotic universe—come close to this,allowing that universes can be reborn, phoenixlike, from their own remains. Buteven in those models, the newborn universes don’t “multiply and gather intopopulations” as Deepak requires, so one can only conclude the criterion ofreproduction is not satisfied. The consciousness requirement—which is said tomean that an organism responds to its environment—cannot be applied to theuniverse, because the universe, being “everything,” has no environment.Similarly—as I argued in chapter 4 [part0013_split_000.html]—because theuniverse does not exist in an external environment and undergo naturalselection, it cannot be said to be evolving in the biological sense of the term.So the universe does not satisfy this criterion, either. Deepak’s concept of aliving universe is an interesting one, but these latter three criteria showthat, even according to Deepak’s own definition, the universe is not alive.Could the universe be considered alive in some more abstract or generalizedsense? Deepak talks about changes that happen within the universe, such as thedevelopment of galaxies and life, and asserts that “life is the universe’s wayof inventing eyes and ears.” The real criterion for judging if the universe isalive, he offers, is not his checklist of the usual characteristics, but this:if the cosmos is self-aware, or conscious, it is alive.Deepak believes that discovering consciousness in the universe is more momentousthan discovering gravity, but “science doesn’t seem to think so.” Actually,science would think so. True, there might be the vociferous opposition thatoften accompanies new approaches. But if it were discovered—rather than merelyproposed—that the universe is conscious, history shows that scientists wouldeventually swarm all over the discovery, and before long you’d have Nobel Prizesawarded and thousands of articles written on the psychology of the universe,with titles like Are Supernovas Self-Destructive? and Are Black Holes a Sign ofDepression? Scientists make their careers on new and revolutionaryideas—especially young scientists, whose reputations do not depend on thecontinued usefulness of the old revolutionary ideas. But to gain acceptance inscience the idea must have testable implications, and this concept of universalconsciousness doesn’t seem to.The evidence Deepak offers is this: he says universal consciousness explains howlife originated in the universe. We’ll get to that claim soon, but first let’sclarify the issue. Deepak compares the appearance of DNA to a zipper thatsomehow learns to reach down and unzip itself. Where did DNA come from? he asks.That is something that needs explaining. We know what happens once simple-celledorganisms have formed: Evolution brings about the ever-developing progression oflife-forms from simple to complex cells, then multicellular life, and theninsectlike creatures, fish, amphibians and reptiles, birds and mammals, andfinally primates, and us. But though evolution creates organisms of increasingcomplexity, all these organisms, going back to even the simplest bacterium, havesomething in common, which is that they are packed with molecular machines thatcreate energy, transport nutrients, relay messages, build and repair cellstructures, and perform many other amazing tasks. These molecules are mostly atype of molecule called an enzyme, which is a catalyst made from proteins (acatalyst is a molecule that changes the rate of a chemical reaction). Since alllife utilizes such molecules, one might conclude that they are a requirement oflife, at least of life as we know it. The issue is that if even the first simpleliving organisms from which everything today evolved included these structures,then how did these molecules first come into being?The origin of life is an ongoing field of research, with many questions yetunanswered, but experiments suggest that it is possible for genetic moleculessimilar to DNA to form spontaneously, and other experiments suggest it ispossible for those genetic molecules to curl up and act as catalysts. That meansthat the earliest forms of life, or what we might call “prelife,” could haveconsisted of membranes made from fatty acids—another type of molecule known toform spontaneously—that enveloped a mix of water and those genetic molecules.Random mutations could then have taken over, enabling those cells to adapt totheir environment, creating life as we know it today. Remember that even if thespontaneous origin of life, or prelife, within any given star system isimprobable, that would not preclude its occurrence, because there are tenbillion trillion stars in our observable universe. So as long as by “improbable”you don’t mean less than a one-in-a-trillion shot, you could still expect over abillion star systems to harbor life.Suppose life in any given star system is a trillion-to-one shot. How can weaccount for being so lucky? If, out of a group of a trillion stars, through thenormal processes of nature, exactly one star system develops life, it might seemto the beings in that star system that their presence there is a miracle.Certainly if they chose their home by throwing a dart at a map of the heavens,the odds would be a trillion to one against hitting a life-bearing solar system.But that’s not what happened. They were born into a star system in which lifedeveloped. And no matter how rare life is, by definition if living beings lookaround, they will find that they were born into a star system that harbors life.So that is not a miracle, or even good luck. It is just a consequence of logic.Scientists may not yet have solved the problem of the origin of life, but ourcivilization is not so advanced in its discoveries that we should leap to theconclusion that if science hasn’t yet been able to explain something, it neverwill. As the alternative to science, what does Deepak’s metaphysics offer? Howdoes a living, conscious universe explain how life appeared? He says,“Spirituality doesn’t need a miracle to explain life once the concept of a deaduniverse is discarded.… Far stronger [than the appeal to a miracle] is theargument that the universe gave rise to complex life because life has alwaysexisted, going back to the precreation state.” Such an argument might sound deepwhen applied to life and the universe, but let’s examine the logic in a moremundane context—say, breakfast foods. Then the argument goes something likethis: “We don’t need a miracle to explain how the sunny-side-up egg appeared onmy plate once the concept of an eggless plate is discarded.… Far stronger thanthe appeal to a miracle is the argument that the universe gave rise to asunny-side-up egg because the sunny-side-up egg has always existed, going backto when the plate was originally manufactured.” This explanation is obviouslynot very enlightening.Deepak’s argument is similar to that of Thomas Aquinas’s thirteenth-century“first cause proof” of the existence of God, which goes something like this:Nothing can cause itself, so everything has a prior cause. Each prior cause mustalso have a prior cause. The only way to terminate this chain is for somethingextraordinary to exist which requires no cause, and that is God. God is thatwhich can create, but which itself requires no creator. Even if one accepts thatargument, it is a giant leap from this concept of God to Deepak’s more specificconcept of universal consciousness, or the biblical God that Aquinas employedthis argument to justify. The argument really does nothing more than transferthe mystery of how a universe can come from nothing to the mystery of how Godcould have come from nothing. Simply asserting that God is God because Godrequires no cause does not get us very far.After Stephen Hawking and I finished writing The Grand Design, I tried todescribe the book to my then-nine-year-old daughter Olivia while waiting for atable at IHOP. Science tackles the big questions, I told her, and we want toexplain the exciting answers to people who aren’t scientists. Where did we, andthe universe, come from, and why is it the way it is? She listened intently, andthen I thought I’d check and see how much she’d absorbed. Why are we here? Iasked her. She looked at me with an odd expression. Because we’re hungry! shesaid. I guess I shouldn’t try to discuss deep intellectual issues beforebreakfast.We all have our own approach to the important questions, but once our hungersextend beyond a taste for pancakes to deeper human yearnings, we must be carefulto start questioning the tooth fairy. The rigorous approach of science, whichDeepak believes obscures the richness of life, is designed to help us avoidbelieving in seductive ideas that the evidence we reap from nature does notsupport.Deepak writes that “higher consciousness allowed the great sages, saints, andseers to attain a kind of knowledge that science feels threatened by.” We canprobably all agree that the great sages, saints, and seers penetrated toknowledge that is outside the realm of science, and we can also agree that thereare many kinds of subjective knowledge that are hugely important to us. It isimportant to know what makes one’s children feel loved and secure and happy, forwhen, as an example, Olivia says that the adjective that best describes her is“joyful,” this adds great meaning to my life. That such subjective experience isimportant does not threaten a scientist. But the danger of putting subjectivityon a pedestal and uncritically accepting metaphysical speculation as truth isthat one will miss out on the most important intellectual understanding we canachieve—that of knowing the real place humanity holds in the physical cosmos. Tome, that too is part of the richness of life.dy>"},{"pageContent":"PART THREE[../images/00009.jpeg]LIFEdy>"},{"pageContent":"[../images/00009.jpeg]WHAT IS LIFE?"},{"pageContent":"[../images/00010.jpeg]LEONARDEvery spring in ancient Egypt the Nile River flooded neighboring land, and whenit subsided it left behind nutrient-rich mud that enabled people to grow thecrops that would sustain them. The muddy soil also gave rise to something elsethat wasn’t around in drier times: a large number of frogs. The frogs came sosuddenly that it seemed they had arisen from the mud itself—which was indeed howthe Egyptians believed that they came into being. Medieval Europeans hadanalogous experiences. Butchers found that maggots and flies would soon appearon meat that had been left out in the open. Barnacle geese, which migrate bynight, showed up suddenly on the coast of western Europe, apparently born fromflotsam. Mice, too, seemed to generate themselves, in the grain stored in barns.In the seventeenth century a mystic and chemist, Jan Baptist van Helmont, evencreated a “recipe” for making mice: place dirty underwear in an open pot with afew grains of wheat, and wait twenty-one days. Though the theory was flawed,this was a successful recipe. For most of human history, it seemed obvious thatsimple living organisms could come into being spontaneously, a process that wascalled spontaneous generation.But then different explanations began to emerge. In 1668 an Italian physicianand naturalist named Francesco Redi suspected that the maggots that arose onmeat—and the flies into which they developed—were due to tiny invisible eggsthat other flies had lain. Redi performed one of biology’s first trulyscientific experiments to test his idea. He placed samples of snake meat, fish,and veal in wide-mouthed jars, leaving some uncovered, and covering others, somewith paper, some with a gauzelike material. He hypothesized that if his theorywas wrong, flies and maggots would appear on the meat in all three situations.But if he was correct, they would soon infest the uncovered meat, but not themeat covered by paper. He also expected to see flies buzzing around outside thegauze-covered jar, but not inside it. Later, he expected, maggots would appearon the gauze, and then drop onto the meat below. That is exactly what happened.Redi’s experiment threw a wet blanket on spontaneous generation, but the ideawas not extinguished. With the development and refinement of the microscope, by1700 people had for the first time been able to see all sorts of unfamiliarlife-forms such as bacteria and other unicellular organisms. No one knew wherethese came from, but most people did suspect they were associated with thespoilage of meats and other foods that went bad. However, there were some whostill favored the idea of spontaneous generation, because it seemed proof of alife force immanent in the universe. It could also be taken as evidence of howGod could have created life from nothing. And so in 1745 a biologist and RomanCatholic priest named John Needham performed an experiment similar to Redi’s,but on the microscopic scale. Knowing that heat killed the bacteria associatedwith spoilage, he heated chicken broth for a few minutes to kill anything thatwas living within it, then let it cool and sealed the vessel. A few days later,the broth showed signs of rotting. An Italian abbot named Lazzaro Spallanzanirepeated Needham’s experiments with a stricter protocol for sterilization, andthe broth did not spoil. But Needham’s experiment had breathed new life into theidea of spontaneous generation, and the abbot’s more meticulous scientific workwas not enough to kill it off.The belief that there is some sort of essence—a life force—present in theuniverse was (and still is) appealing to many whose religious or spiritual viewstell them that life is imbued with a special quality that can’t be explained bythe forces of nature. People had observed since ancient times that living thingsseem essentially different from the inanimate, so even apart from religiousmotives, it was natural to see in spontaneous generation evidence of some forcethat might be the carrier of this essence. About a century after theNeedham/Spallanzani controversy, however, Louis Pasteur put the matter ofspontaneous generation to rest through careful experiments that providedconvincing evidence that microorganisms carried through the air, not born of thebroth itself, are what causes broth to spoil.So what is life? What does it mean to be alive? Deepak approaches consciousnessas the foundation of a living universe. His views are reminiscent of a theoryknown as vitalism, which holds that life arises from a vital principle, or lifeforce, that permeates the cosmos and lies outside the domain of chemistry andphysics. If there were a life force that imbued each living organism, then theact of determining what is alive would be on the same footing as, say, that ofdetermining whether an object is a magnet. Just as a magnet is a source of, andresponds to, magnetic force, if there were a life force, a living object wouldinteract with it and we could use that interaction to define and measure what isalive. But if there is no life force, then what is it that makes living things“essentially different”? How do we decide what is alive?Biologists don’t agree on the best way to define life. The living organisms wemeet in our everyday world have some common properties, similar to the criteriaDeepak gave in chapter 6 [part0015_split_000.html]: they undergo metabolism,which means they convert or use nutrients and energy; they reproduce; they grow;they respond to stimuli, such as when the leaves of a plant turn toward the sun;on a larger scale of time, their species change by adapting theircharacteristics to the demands of the environment; and they exhibit homeostasis,the self-regulating processes (having to do with everything from bodytemperature to the balance of biochemical substances in the bloodstream) thatallow organisms to maintain a consistent internal state. For example, an icecube tossed into a swimming pool is colder than the pool, but after a shorttime, it will melt and warm up, while the pool grows ever so slightly cooler.The forces of heat and cold, in other words, battle it out and come toequilibrium in the form of a uniform temperature. Similarly, a pot of boilingwater placed in a cold stream will cool down, while the stream heats up ever soslightly, until the two reach the same temperature. A person tossed into aswimming pool or a cold stream, however, is capable of homeostasis and willmaintain body temperature.Though the above list of properties works well as a definition of life forturtles, redwood trees, and fungi, it is controversial in borderline cases likeviruses, self-replicating proteins, and computer viruses. And who knows howexotic lifelike creatures we may someday discover on other planets might fitinto our definitions? We’ve already seen that here on Earth, in an arsenic-richenvironment, the sacred molecule of DNA operates in an alternate form, in whichthe phosphorus atoms in its backbone are replaced by arsenic, an element in thesame family as phosphorus, yet quite different.One can make a good argument that biologists don’t need a single definition oflife—the solution may be to accept that there are different categories of life,each exhibiting different combinations of lifelike characteristics. A virus maynot satisfy all the traditional criteria, rock salt may satisfy just one or two,and a Martian microorganism three, but the details of how we choose to definelife are unimportant as long as we are all aware of the criteria each of us isusing.Biologists want to know what makes living things tick, and so they need adefinition of life for operational reasons. But here both Deepak and I areinterested in a deeper question: what is the relation of living things to thephysical universe? That is, if we consider squirrels, redwood trees, and fungito be alive, and viruses, or even computer viruses, to be at least “lifelike,”what physical qualities distinguish the atoms and molecules those things aremade of, from the atoms and molecules in a chunk of metal, or sea salt?If there were indeed a life force, one could say it instills into each of ourmolecules a quantum of vitality, making every atom within us alive. We’d be likea cake in which the sweetness of each crumb adds up to the sweetness of thewhole. A living being, however, is not as alive as the sum of its parts. Life iswhat scientists call an “emergent property.” An ocean wave depends on theinteractions between many molecules, so to analyze a wave you must understandconcepts like temperature and pressure that have no meaning when speaking ofjust a few molecules. Similarly, it is difficult or impossible, by studyingindividual molecules alone, to understand what it means to be alive. The atomsand molecules of something that has qualities fitting the definition of life areno different from those in a chunk of metal. It is only their organization thatis different.From the point of view of physics, living things are distinguished through theirorder, and their ability to maintain it. There are far more ways of rearrangingthe components in a pot of minestrone soup without destroying its identity assoup than there are ways to rearrange the parts of a cat without destroying itsidentity as a living thing, and so organization and order are more important tothe cat than they are to the soup. Mess with how your molecules are puttogether, or which organs connect with which, and you won’t last long. When westop maintaining order, we die, and revert to a highly disordered state.This idea was first popularized by Erwin Schrödinger, one of the founders ofquantum theory, who gave a series of public lectures in Ireland that werepublished in 1944 as a book entitled What Is Life? I don’t normally quotelong-dead physicists, for a couple of reasons. For one, unlike religion, physicsdoes not put much weight on authority. Certainly physicists listen carefully tothe arguments of brilliant colleagues, but then we check their equations. Moreimportant, because science marches forward, every decent physics graduatestudent today knows far more than Schrödinger, Heisenberg, Bohr, Planck,Einstein, or any other pioneer of quantum theory ever knew about quantum theory,or any other fundamental theory in physics. And anyone who reads ScientificAmerican knows more about the brain and neuroscience than they did. That doesn’tmean that everything these scientists said was wrong; it just means that noteverything they said was right, and for good and understandable reasons.What Is Life? is famous in part because in it Schrödinger speculated about howgenetic information might be encoded in living things. The book was lateracknowledged as a source of inspiration by physicist turned molecular biologistFrancis Crick, who with James Watson and Rosalind Franklin discovered thedouble-helix structure of DNA. In tackling the question posed by the book’stitle, Schrödinger also offered a pearl that still inspires the way physicistslook at life, and describes that outlook very clearly:What is the characteristic feature of life? When is a piece of matter said to bealive? When it goes on “doing something,” moving, exchanging material with itsenvironment, and so forth, and that for a much longer period than we wouldexpect an inanimate piece of matter to “keep going” under similarcircumstances.… It is by avoiding the rapid decay into the inert state of“equilibrium” that an organism appears so enigmatic.Living things are not like lifeless boulders rolling down a hill: thanks tohomeostasis, our fluids keep their precise mix, our internal structures maintaintheir composition, and in warm-blooded animals, our temperature stays within acertain range.When I talked about homeostasis I said a pot of boiling water tossed into a coldstream will cool down, while a human being won’t. Of course, if you remain therefor too long, your homeostatic mechanisms may be overwhelmed to the point thatyou develop hypothermia, and eventually die—at which time your body temperaturewill indeed be the same as that of the water, and you will be in equilibriumwith your environment. However, most people will eventually feel uncomfortablycold and get out of the stream. So two of the fundamental characteristics oflife are at work in thus resisting the fate of the pot of boilingwater—metabolism (which helps you maintain your body temperature, at least for awhile) and response to stimuli. That’s life functioning on its most fundamentallevel—as a complex of energy-hungry molecules temporarily organized in a formthat resists the inevitable return to equilibrium.But the return is indeed inevitable. In this case I happen to believe ratherliterally what the Bible says in Genesis: “out of [the ground] you were taken;for dust you are and to dust you will return.” Dust is a disorderlyconglomeration of all sorts of tiny particles; but in between our beginningsfrom dust and our end as dust, the universe has given all of us living thingsthe ability to maintain a strict order. For human beings this gift means that,for a time, our cells can stay organized and preserve the integrity of theircontent; our blood can flow through its proper channels within our bodies; ourmuscles, organs, and bones can maintain their structure and function. And, mostimportant to our sense of who we are, it means that our brains can operate, andgive us the capacity to reason, to store fond moments from childhood, to growattached to others.I spoke to my father while writing this book. For as long as I can remember Ihave feared for his health. When I spoke to him the other night he reassured methat he is alive and well, in the same way he has reassured me each time I’veseen him over the last twenty years—in my dreams. My father died two decades agobut I’d obviously rather not accept it. I’d rather believe that he has rejoinedthe universe, or gone on living in some other form. Unfortunately, for me thedesire is not strong enough to outweigh the skepticism. Deepak’s metaphysics isnot a religion, but like the answers of many religions, his answers arereassuring. It takes special courage to instead believe in science—to face thefact that after death our bodies return to the temperature of the inanimateobjects around us, that we and our loved ones reach equilibrium with ourenvironment, that we again become one with the dust."},{"pageContent":"[../images/00010.jpeg]DEEPAKIt takes a huge perspective to know what life is. If life arose from the mostbasic physical mechanisms that Leonard describes, such as homeostasis and heatexchange, blue-green algae would understand themselves better. But the richdepths of life haven’t been plumbed by science, and that’s what spiritualitywants to address. In an earlier chapter, Leonard defended the superiority ofscience by saying that metaphysics can’t build an MRI scanner. True, but theother edge of the sword is that metaphysics doesn’t build high-tech weapons,either. Science can make life better in material ways, but no one could say thatthe world is suffering from a lack of materialism; in fact, the world issuffering from the exact opposite: a lack of self-knowledge.Science could add to self-knowledge by expanding its sights. It could take heedof Einstein’s core belief: “I maintain that the cosmic religious feeling is thestrongest and noblest motive for scientific research.” To my way of thinking,Einstein, Schrödinger, Pauli, and other so-called quantum mystics showed realwisdom in honoring the spiritual side of the human mind. After dedicating alifetime to scientific research they came to the conclusion that spiritualityoffers a much broader exploration of life than science will ever come to on itsown.So, what is life? Life is the essence of existence. “Essence” doesn’t mean adivine elixir that God poured into the ear of Adam and Eve. Nor is it the “lifeforce” (more about that later). Essence refers to that which is most basic, thething we cannot take away and still have creation. Evolution has given rise tomillions of different forms, but let’s not be distracted because plants andanimals look different from stars and galaxies. Life is woven into the veryfabric of the universe. You can’t pet a star or walk an electron in the park,but deep down, they are both alive.Why? Because, as we saw, the universe passes the same tests that biology appliesto microbes, viruses, liver cells, white mice, and so forth. Every livingcreature is born and dies. The physical part decays and gets recycled into newlife. Last year’s fallen leaves become fertilizer for next spring’s green buds.(It may make you queasy, but if a dead worm sends nitrogen into the earth,allowing an oak tree to grow, which drops acorns for pigs to gobble up, and youeat bacon for breakfast—well, draw your own conclusion about where your bodycomes from.) This cycle of rebirth isn’t on automatic pilot, however. If anamoeba dies and decays, its raw materials don’t have to come back as anotheramoeba. Any life-form, including the human body, can use those materials.In other words, birth and rebirth are intensely creative. Something old andfamiliar leads to something new and original. The universe has been perfectingits creative abilities for billions of years. This creative drive is what Iwould call the “life force.” Leonard maintains that real forces can be measured;some kind of meter, like the electrical meter fixed to the side of your house,must be able to measure it. But the life force is more like the power ofimagination. If you measured the calories put out by Leonardo da Vinci’s brain,you wouldn’t be measuring the power of his imagination. His brain happens togive off heat, but that is a side effect, not the real power, which is invisibleand immeasurable.Materialists may tut-tut their disapproval, but forces exist that don’t registeron scientific instruments. (The force of desire, the force of curiosity, and theforce of love could head the list.) Spirituality argues that creativity lies atthe heart of everything that can be called alive. Does that mean that a rock inyour shoe is alive? Yes, because it is part of the same creative process thatincludes you, a process that keeps endlessly emerging with new products. (It isfascinating to note that rocks needed life in order to evolve. The earliestphase of Earth’s history began with 250 minerals, which came as we saw from thedust of supernovas and asteroid collisions. The turbulent forces on the Earth’scrust, including the tremendous heat released by volcanoes, raised the number ofminerals to around 1,500. But about two billion years ago living organisms beganto process these minerals—feeding off them, and using them to build shells andskeletons. Tiny ocean plankton, whose skeletons are primarily made of calcium,laid down the White Cliffs of Dover and most other limestone formations.Amazingly, living things allowed minerals to keep evolving to reach the presentnumber found on Earth, which is now 4,500—three times the original number.Cosmic evolution has relied upon life as a major cocreator.)Leonard pleads with us not to fall for the delusions of metaphysics, ascomforting as they may be: life is only the interval before dust returns todust. But science has made a metaphysical decision of its own by putting itsfaith in matter. To say “We can do away with God” is metaphysics. To say “Lifewas created only by molecules” is also metaphysics. I’d call it bad metaphysics,actually. Basic physiology tells us that our brains are fed by glucose, or bloodsugar. I couldn’t write a word or have a thought without using up molecules ofglucose. Yet even if a super-MRI in the future could match a molecule of bloodsugar to the exact instant that a neuron fired the signal corresponding to aword on this page, it wouldn’t mean that glucose is thinking.Let’s say that you track a brain cell back to the atoms that make it up, thenfarther back to subatomic particles, and finally across the divide into theinvisible domain that lies beyond. No one can point to a specific physicalprocess and say, “Aha, that’s where thinking comes from” or “That’s whereglucose came alive.” The effort to find such a starting point continues, butmaterialism is fooling itself. If a young child asked how gasoline learned todrive a car, he would be making the same mistake as some of our leadingneuroscientists.Every molecule that gets transformed into a living process poses an enigma. Howdoes it go from an inert, random state (death) into a vital, creative state(life)? Spirituality takes the approach that nothing is dead. Because we fearour own disintegration and dissolution, we have projected onto death much morepower than it actually has. Death is just a transitional stage, as one livingform is reborn into another. (I’m not making a religious statement about thesoul here, but I will later on.) Materialism can hypothetically trace the pathof an oxygen atom in the jet stream until it enters the lungs of a futureMichelangelo or Mozart, but it is useless in explaining how that atom isconnected to genius, beauty, and art.In order to explain how matter suddenly becomes part of the dance of life, withall the creativity that life exhibits, you must go to a more essential level.I’ve been arguing that consciousness is innate in Nature. It’s part of ouressence. So are the other qualities that distinguish life; intelligence,creativity, organization, and evolution are all essential to living beings. DNAdidn’t create them. Saying that DNA creates life is like saying that paintcreates paintings. I believe we’ll arrive at the truth by reversing thesequence: life came first, and eventually matter brought it into visible form.Physicist Freeman Dyson points the way to accepting the spiritual viewpoint aspart of an expanded science: “I have found a universe growing without limit inrichness and complexity, a universe of life surviving forever.”Some scientists seem to be willing to split the difference. Let biology tell ushow life arose, they contend, while religion or metaphysics asks why. This isreally a polite form of declaring victory, however, by giving life over entirelyto science. Having identified DNA and having set out to map it, genetics isattempting to gobble up everything. There is supposedly a love gene, a criminalgene, even a faith gene. In fact no such genes have been found, and the leadingspeculation is that they never will be. An apparently simple problem likepredicting a child’s height involves more than twenty genes interacting with oneanother, and even if each of those genes could be isolated, researchers concedethat less than half the story would have been told. Why have the Dutch shot upto be the tallest people in the world? Why are the Japanese now among the topten? Their genes haven’t changed. The answer lies somewhere with diet,environment, an unknown genetic switch, and perhaps an X factor (such as whetherthe mind can affect the body in its growth. Don’t be incredulous—medicinealready knows that psychological abuse can lead to stunted babies, through aprocess know as psychological dwarfism).Science keeps getting greedier about the subjects it wants to gobble up. Thereis no room, as Leonard would have it, for wishful thinking, which we should haveleft behind in childhood. Don’t talk to me about such fanciful things asintelligence existing everywhere. The best rebuttal I can offer is aneight-year-old border collie named Betsy who lives just outside Vienna, Austria.Betsy’s owner trained her to fetch things by name. If she said “bone,” Betsyfetched a bone. If she said “ball,” Betsy fetched a ball. Any dog owner can tellyou this isn’t difficult, but this particular owner was more ambitious. Shetaught Betsy to fetch dolls, cheese, and a set of keys—until, against all odds,Betsy could understand 340 commands without getting them confused.Cognitive psychologist Juliane Kaminski tested this phenomenon, which was filmedby public television’s science journal, Nova. Human babies understand aboutthree hundred words when they are around two years old. The next stage in humandevelopment, which no other primate has reached, is to grasp symbols. Forexample, if you hold up a tiny toy car and ask a toddler to find the same thingin the room, she knows that the tiny car is a model, so it poses no difficulty,at around age three, for a child to bring back a bigger toy car. News flash: socan Betsy the border collie. She understands that models represent thingssymbolically. (I can’t resist mentioning that dogs are the only creaturesbesides human beings who know what pointing means. At six weeks old a puppy willgo to an object if you point at it. At six months old, so will a human baby. Butchimpanzees, our nearest primate relatives, cannot. If you point to a cup thathides a treat under it, chimps don’t know what you mean. They don’t catch oneven after hundreds of repetitions.)Betsy isn’t the only smart border collie; at least two others can understand upto two hundred words, which runs counter to almost every old assumption aboutintelligence, the brain, the evolutionary ladder, and human pride in ourexclusive mental abilities. Betsy has one more accomplishment to humble us with.It has long been claimed that only humans can understand abstract renderings. IfI show you a picture of a bone, for example, you can run and bring me a realbone. So can Betsy. When shown a picture of any object she knows how to fetch,she goes and gets it. Researchers are left in awe, not before the grandeur ofthe universe but before an animal who has no right, scientifically, to do whatshe does. Yet she does it anyway.Once we open our minds, Betsy can be the wedge to an all-embracing theory oflife. The reader faces a clear choice between wholeness and parts. If science isright, life is a puzzle with lots of tiny pieces that, once assembled, turnedinert matter into living creatures. If spirituality is right, life is part ofNature’s wholeness, an aspect that becomes visible through living creatures butdoesn’t depend on them. The choice you make here reflects your worldview, andthe universe will present itself accordingly.The real problem with the theory of a life force is when it tries to bematerialistic. But because it can’t be measured, the “life” part of the lifeforce has no material validity. Ironically, DNA runs into the same objection.I’m well aware that genetics is considered the greatest triumph in modernbiology, the breakthrough that made it possible to decode life itself. DNA isthe chemical carrier of an incredibly complex message, but it’s not the messageitself, any more than the letters of a telegram are the same as the thought thatgoes into the telegram. Life is Nature experiencing itself in as many differentways as possible. We can choose other words than “Nature.” That’s the message.We can speak of God looking at his (or her) creation, or the universal mind.Each term points toward a self-creating universe that unfolds as a livingentity. Spirituality doesn’t need a special moment when life suddenly appeared.Life has always been.dy>"},{"pageContent":"[../images/00009.jpeg]IS THERE DESIGN IN THE UNIVERSE?"},{"pageContent":"[../images/00010.jpeg]LEONARDIf by design one means a blueprint or pattern, then scientists and those with areligious or spiritual outlook can all agree that yes, the universe does have adesign. We all see it with our eyes, and scientists seek to represent it throughtheir equations, for we believe that the laws of physics are the blueprint forthe universe. To create or simply understand a mathematical theory, and thenobserve as even the most minuscule atoms or the largest and most distant starsact according to the physical laws embodied in those equations, is one of thegreatest wonders and joys of being a physicist.Why nature follows laws is a mystery. Why the specific laws we’ve observed existis also a mystery. But what is clear is that the laws of nature are sufficientto enable us to show how life arose without the necessity of there being anyimmortal hand or eye executing the design. Those laws dictated that from theprimordial cosmic soup, stars would condense and create carbon and the otherelements living things require. They dictated that some of those stars wouldthen explode, and from the debris new solar systems would form. And theydictated that from the primordial chemical soup on at least one planet, ours,naturally occurring processes led to objects of beautiful design, from geodes totigers to people.The issue that separates Deepak and me is not whether the universe has design,but whether something designed it, and whether it was designed for a purpose.Creationists and adherents of “intelligent design” believe, as Deepak does, thatthe intricacies of living creatures could not be the result of natural law. Thatview has a long tradition. The British philosopher David Hume published a bookin 1779 called Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion, in which three fictionalcharacters debate the issue. One of them, Philo, puts the argument this way:“Throw several pieces of steel together, without shape or form; they will neverarrange themselves so as to compose a watch.”In 1802 theologian William Paley famously elaborated on that theme:In crossing a heath, suppose I pitched my foot against a stone, and were askedhow the stone came to be there: I might possibly answer, that for any thing Iknow to the contrary, it had lain there forever: nor would it perhaps be veryeasy to show the absurdity of this answer. But suppose I had found a watch uponthe ground, and it should be inquired how the watch happened to be in thatplace; I should hardly think of the answer which I had before given, that forany thing I knew, the watch might have always been there.… the inference, wethink, is inevitable, that the watch must have had a maker; that there must haveexisted, at some time, and at some place or other, an artificer or artificers,who formed it for the purpose which we find it actually to answer; whocomprehended its construction, and designed its use.The crux of all these gee-whiz arguments is that things as incredible as a watchor your grandmother are really complicated and hence could not have arisenexcept as the product of some being’s exceptional expertise. They are sincereand compelling arguments based on the best science of their day, which was notup to the task of explaining how life came to be. But to paraphrase Arthur C.Clarke, any sufficiently advanced consequence of a scientific law that we do notyet understand is indistinguishable from the work of a “higher power.”Again and again through history people have assigned to any aspect of naturethey could not explain an origin in the supernatural. Hume’s character Philo wascorrect that pieces of steel thrown together will not form a watch, but thatanalogy seemed convincing only because people in Hume’s day, nearly a centurybefore Darwin published his great work, were not yet aware of the principle ofnatural selection, which makes it clear how unguided nature can indeed designamazingly complex objects (such as DNA; such as, ultimately, ourselves). Had ascientist from the future shown an eighteenth-century philosopher an airplane,an X-ray machine, or a cell phone, that philosopher would have been equallydumbfounded, and could just as well have attributed those devices to a divineorigin. Perhaps then, some philosopher might have argued,“Fix several wings together onto a steel hull; they can never be arranged so asto allow that hull to fly.”“Shine whatever light you wish onto a person’s head; it will never allow you topeer at the brain inside.”or“Scream as loudly as you wish into a tiny box; you will never be heard acrossthe ocean.”Today science does explain how such devices can be constructed—just as itexplains how natural processes lead to the development of intelligent life.There is one difference between science’s explanation of life and itsexplanation of those apparatuses. The science behind the airplane, the X-raymachine, and the cell phone doesn’t threaten anyone’s preferred beliefs. Hence,there is no public outcry against the science behind them. No one claims thatscientists are closed-minded because they believe in aeronautics. No oneproposes that X-ray images of broken bones don’t really come from photons. Noone says electromagnetism is “just a theory,” or suggests that courses intelecommunications give equal time to carrier pigeons, just in case. Butevolution concerns how we all got here, which makes it harder for some people toaccept. The William Paleys of today willingly make use of the miraculousscientific feat that enables text messages offering two-for-one quesadillas tobe coded into an invisible type of energy, transmitted through the air, andreconstituted on their handheld devices, but they question the integrity of thescientific method when it comes to the biological miracle of life. They arehappy to employ inventions and products created through science they don’tunderstand, but they balk at accepting the scientific “theories” that explainthe very origins of life.Biologists tell us that the designer of life was not a being, but theenvironment. The assumption implicit in the argument that complex things musthave been designed by a higher intelligence is that it would have been simplerto accomplish the creation of life that way than through evolution. That is anunderstandable belief, especially for those who ignore the role of naturalselection in evolution and view it merely as some sort of random hocus-pocus.But actually, because of the astonishing power of natural selection, theopposite may be true. That’s why natural selection (technically, “artificialselection”) has become the basis of a revolutionary new method of designingmolecules called “directed evolution,” in which chemists and chemical engineersset up environments that encourage starter molecules to evolve into commerciallyuseful products. Directed evolution has proved successful in allowing thesynthesis of many proteins that no one knew how to “design” in the traditionalsense. So when admiring the amazing capabilities of life, perhaps it is morenatural to say, not that they could only be the work of a creator, but ratherthat “this could only be the product of evolution.”Natural selection explains how organisms change from generation to generationuntil what started as the type of simple organism that causes stomachaches canevolve, after billions of years, into the type of complex organism that getsthem. Darwin wrote about elephants. Suppose Noah had saved a single pair ofelephants on his great ark, sometime around 3000 BCE, which was the time of theFlood. Though elephants are the slowest of breeders, in just five centuries theywould have produced fifteen million descendants. By 2000 BCE, there’d have beentrillions, many thousands of elephants for every person now alive. By now weshould all have been crushed under a mountain of pachyderms. What saved us?Injury, sickness, starvation, and death. They ensured that only a fraction ofelephants survived to produce offspring. It was not an unbiased pruning. On thecontrary, in determining which should live and which should die, the environmentacted as the intelligent designer. Animals that weren’t tough or big or tall orsmart enough to find sufficient food, fend off predators, and survive diseasetended to die before they could pass on their ineffective traits. Those moresuited to their environment survived and created progeny fit to compete in thenext, new and improved, generation. And so on. In chapter 4[part0013_split_000.html], I mentioned that when a process like naturalselection was included, in just forty-three generations evolution could createthe Shakespearean phrase “Methinks it is like a weasel,” which would take arandom letter generator longer than the life of the solar system to produce.That is the power of evolution.Evolution predicts that the design of living beings comes from both randommutation and selection due to the competition to survive. As a result, whenstudying living organisms in detail, one can’t help but be struck by the factthat often their “design” is neither optimal nor elegant. It is, instead, “justgood enough.” Living organisms might be wondrous from the point of view offunction, but they are not beautiful from the standpoint of design. That is verydifferent from what you would expect if the design were created by an“intelligent designer,” at least one that possessed superhuman intelligence.Evolution creates inelegant design because, as species evolve, nature doesn’ttear down the house and rebuild from scratch, but takes the more expedient routeof altering what’s already there. Sometimes we’re left with wisdom teeth or anappendix, or, as I’ll talk about in the next chapter, a gene for a tail, traitsthat once served a function, but are no longer necessary. A purposeful designerwould probably have made other choices, but since living organisms need notexhibit perfect design, evolution makes organisms that are just good enough tosurvive.Evolution explains the origin of intelligent life on one level, but there ismore to explain. Though biologists have made great strides in understanding themechanism of evolution, right down to the molecular scale, biology is only theouter layer of the onion of scientific explanation. It describes organisms,their organs, cells, and, as of the last few decades, even the DNA, proteins,and other molecules living things are made of. But the descriptions and laws ofbiology take as their elementary elements objects which themselves can be brokendown into more elementary components. At the deepest level—the core of theonion—lies physics. Physics is concerned with the forces and elementaryparticles that, by the trillions upon trillions, act to create the structures ofthe biologists’ concern. So one ought to also ask, Does the development of lifewithout the aid of a designer make sense on the level of physics? It is on thatlevel that the answer to Deepak’s challenge really lies: from the fundamentalequations governing matter and energy, without any guidance or purpose, can lifebe spontaneously created? If we are to believe that no designer was needed, wemust provide an answer that works not only at the level where biologicalprocesses are at work, but also at the level where the laws of physics operate.To address whether, from the point of view of physics, the obvious design innature required a designer, we must translate the issue into the language ofphysics. The early Earth was a rough mix of rocks and sand and air and waterwith various compounds dissolved or suspended within it. Living things, on theother hand, are made from very particular complex molecules and structures. Thecrux of the issue for physicists is: can such order arise without guidance? Thetool physicists use to analyze that kind of question is a concept calledentropy. Loosely speaking, entropy is a measure of the disorder in a system. Themore disordered, usually, the higher the entropy. Entropy is the enemy of life,and of any concept of “design.”Physicists in the nineteenth century noticed that, with time, things tend tobecome more disordered—that is, the entropy increases. In a way this is areflection of the lack of purpose or guidance in physical law. To understand whyentropy, or disorder, increases, let’s consider a simple (and classic) example,a box of gas molecules that has a partition down the middle with a hole in it.Suppose we start with a thousand molecules on the left side and none on theright. As the molecules bounce around, some of those on the left will passthrough the hole in the partition and end up on the other side. With time, morewill pass from left to right, but some on the right will occasionally pass tothe left. That won’t happen often as long as the right side is underpopulated,but eventually there will be many molecules on the right side, and so the netexodus will slow down. After more time there will be roughly the same number ofmolecules on both sides, and the number per unit time passing from right to leftwill be nearly the same as the number passing from left to right. That is anexample of a state of equilibrium, as explained in the last chapter.Though the term “disorder” is vague and subjective, it is probably safe to saythat the initial configuration, with all the molecules congregating on the left,seems more ordered than the final one, in which the molecules are spread throughthe entire box. We think of the initial arrangement as ordered because it has aregularity—there are no molecules anywhere on the right side of the box. Thefinal state of the box has no restrictions on its arrangement—the molecules areeverywhere, so it is disordered. Our bodies, when we are alive, are like theinitial arrangement. For example, our blood cells must maintain a certaininternal biochemical balance, and not mix with their surroundings, and our bloodmust stay inside its vessels, and remain pure, not mixing randomly with otherbodily fluids.In the box scenario the initial configuration, with all the molecules on theleft, was a low-entropy setup, and the final configuration, with the moleculesall over the place, was a high-entropy situation. With time, and no higherconsciousness or power at work to influence the distribution of molecules, thesystem moved toward a roughly equal split of the molecules, which is the mostdisordered, or maximum entropy state (that being the technical meaning of theterm “equilibrium”). That is the tendency of all nature—the drive toward everhigher levels of entropy. As I explained earlier, life resists that drive. Andwhen it ends, the drive toward entropy continues.The law that explains why living things have to work at staying alive—i.e., atmaintaining their order—is called the second law of thermodynamics. It dictatesthat the entropy of a closed system never decreases. That’s a scientist’s way ofsaying what Hume had his character say: “Throw several pieces of steel together,without shape or form; they will never arrange themselves so as to compose awatch.” But the second law also says: “Leave a watch uncared for in nature andwith time it will tend to become just several pieces of steel, without shape orform.” The second law is why, if we shove a splattered egg off the counter, itwill never hit the floor and coalesce into that nicely structured object we callan intact egg, but if we shove an intact egg off the counter, it will splatterinto a random-looking mess. Similarly, if we find a box containing moleculesequally distributed within it, we will never see the molecules all gather on oneside, but if we find such a box with all its molecules on one side, with timethey will eventually distribute themselves uniformly throughout the box. In viewof this law, the challenge a physicist must address is, how can we start withatoms distributed willy-nilly throughout the universe, and find that at somelater time they have coalesced into the ordered state we call living beings? Inother words, if the natural tendency of the universe is disorder, then wheredoes the order of life come from?The phrase “closed system” here is the key. Entropy can’t fall if there is nooutside interference, but the entropy of one system can decrease if the entropyof another increases by an equal or greater amount. The hand of God may reach inand keep all the molecules on one side of the box, but that hand must suffer anincreased disorder of its own. We keep the disorder in our bodies fromincreasing by consuming order in the guise of things like broccoli and chicken(until they’ve decomposed, they maintain a good bit of order) and expellingdisorder as excrement and heat. So, too, must our planet respect the entropybalance. In order for life in our biosphere to have evolved from inorganicmaterials, the Earth needs to export entropy—that is, to import order. How?Where does the order come from?Each day the Earth receives a sizable gift of energy from the sun, and alsobequeaths a roughly equal amount of radiation back into space—that radiationbalance keeps the planet’s temperature from continuously rising. But the qualityof the energy the Earth radiates is not the same as the quality of that which itreceives. The surface of the sun is about twenty times the average temperatureof the surface of the Earth, which means that the Earth must radiate twentytimes as many photons—the particles of light—as the sun in order to radiate thesame amount of energy. Physics tells us that this corresponds to twenty timesthe entropy, and so, day after day, the Earth radiates twenty times as muchentropy as it receives. As Caltech physicist Sean Carroll has calculated, thenet entropy generated by the Earth over the years is far more than enough toaccount for the entropy decrease the Earth has experienced by generating life.The gift of life is not, then, the gift of a god, or of a “universalconsciousness”; it is a gift from the sun."},{"pageContent":"[../images/00010.jpeg]DEEPAKIt’s a shame that “design” became a buzzword for Christian fundamentalists, apivot for their belief in the creation story of the book of Genesis. The wordsuddenly became radioactive in other circles. Scientists grew worried thatreason itself was under attack. Skeptics and atheists threw their dogs into thefight, ever ready to beat back superstition. It thus became impossible toseparate charged emotions from the issues that were at stake. Offering“intelligent design” as an alternative to Darwin’s theory of evolution never didhave any validity. What it did have was political clout. Elected officials whowanted to woo religious voters tried to sidestep overwhelming protest from thescientific community.With this in mind, it’s a welcome development when a respected scientist likeLeonard agrees that the universe does, indeed, display traces of design. But hisway of getting there is completely materialistic, meaning he relies onrandomness and the dictates of the laws of Nature. There is a huge gap between“dictate” and “allow”: without question the laws of Nature allow human beings tobe here and to invent things like airplanes and watches, but did Bernoulli’sprinciple, which allowed the Wright brothers to shape a wing in such a way thatit got lift, dictate to them? The setup of the early universe cannot dictate myactions billions of years hence.We take it for granted that there are ways to get around physical laws, usuallyby using one against the other. When I lift my arm I defy gravity by invokingelectromagnetism, the force that controls muscles. I can pull two magnets apart,using the same law against itself. As it exists today, the universe allows usenormous scope to play with the laws of Nature. Of course there are limits. Icouldn’t lift my arm on Jupiter, because my muscles would be too weak to counterthat planet’s stronger gravitational field. But materialism can’t account forhow a person chooses which laws to obey, counter, or play around with.Latitude is built into Nature. When carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen meetup, their free electrons dictate that they will bond; all of life is based onsuch bonding, and as we observe, there are billions of possible combinations.Nature left lots of wiggle room for variation; therefore, the simple exampleLeonard provides of gas molecules drifting from the left side of a box to theright is not only reductionist, it doesn’t apply. The same holds for the entireargument based on entropy. No one denies that entropy rules states of heatexchange. No one denies that living forms are islands of negative entropy. Butthe real mystery is how they got that way. The entire cosmos is heading towardheat death, as Leonard explains. But heat death is just a blown-up version ofthe molecules drifting in a box. Drift doesn’t explain how islands of negativeentropy, like the sun, the Earth, and life on Earth, can last for billions ofyears and keep growing more self-sustained.Reductionism will always fail the test of how mindless natural laws can createanything as intricate as a watch. Leonard tries to escape the flaws inreductionism by verbal sleight of hand. He calls a watch complex, which it is.But it is more than that. It is designed. On the slopes of the Swiss Alps, oneskier leaves a trail in the snow that is a simple line. A hundred skiers goingdown the same slope leave many more trails that form a tangled weave. The linesare more complex, but they are far from being a design. A Swiss watch doesn’tjust pile a bunch of simple processes on top of one another; it has purpose andmeaning. It was designed to perform a specific task. It can be beautiful, butwithout a doubt it is precise. And when it drifts into inaccuracy, itsimprecision can be corrected. All these aspects of design must have come fromsomewhere. Spirituality argues that they are aspects of consciousness, theinvisible designer behind the scenes of the visible world.I am not bothered when Leonard lumps my argument in with those of creationistsand believers in “intelligent design.” He isn’t claiming that I am either ofthose things. Yet the lumping together does imply a kinship, which I mustcounter. Creationism and intelligent design are just as far from the world’swisdom traditions as materialism. When choosing sides in the ongoing debatebetween religious faith and scientific rationality, spirituality actually comescloser to science, since wisdom is the blossoming of reason, not its enemy.I found it deplorable when a conservative White House announced that there wasnothing wrong with teaching schoolchildren an alternative to evolution, and thatchildren would benefit from an open debate. The public seemed to agree. In theend, it took the federal courts to affirm the obvious truth: intelligent designis a religious concept, not a scientific one, and therefore it cannot beconsidered an “alternative” in science classrooms. There is nothing to debate.In an age of faith, the abundance of patterns in Nature was used to defend theexistence of God. Leonard gives us the analogy of the watchmaker, which heassociates with a kind of primitive, early scientific mind. That’s not entirelyright. The so-called argument from design was respectable on intellectualgrounds in the seventeenth or eighteenth century. But it disappeared along withevery other argument that tried to uphold the notion of purpose in the universe(known in philosophy as teleology). Scientists today offer the opposite, theargument against design, although they graciously allow that design cantemporarily appear in the swirling randomness that rules all things.The beautiful design found in Nature—as opposed to mere complexity and islandsof heat—cannot simply be brushed aside. Science is forced to explain how designappeared in an accidental universe. For its part, spirituality is forced toexplain the opposite, how randomness appeared in a purposeful universe. But ifcreation is imbued with consciousness, there is no war between chance andpurpose, randomness and design. You can have both at the same time.Look at your own life. You are a conscious being. Sometimes you stroll aimlesslylooking at the scenery; sometimes you know where you are going. Sometimes youdoodle and sometimes you draw. Aimless wandering doesn’t negate destinations anymore than a squiggle on a scratch pad negates studies in an art class. The sameholds true on a cosmic scale. At a deeper level, random chance can benefitpurpose. In the human sphere, letting go of a problem, releasing it to newpossibilities, is often the best way to arrive at a solution. Nature seems toagree. The universe combines matter and energy, apparently by chance, only toarrive at sudden leaps of pattern and form. Before DNA there was a primordialsoup of amino acids. The soup churned around without visible “design,” but outof it emerged an incredibly complex design. This was creativity at work, notwar.Randomness can easily live in the same neighborhood as purpose, design, andmeaning. All exist simultaneously in Nature. Red corpuscles bounce alongrandomly in my bloodstream, but I am not writing these words randomly. Beingforced into an either/or choice—which is what happens when science says “choosematerialism” and religion says “choose God”—puts a roadblock on the path to thetruth. There is no use even arguing until everyone is willing to consider thedeeper issues with an open mind.dy>"},{"pageContent":"[../images/00009.jpeg]WHAT MAKES US HUMAN?"},{"pageContent":"[../images/00010.jpeg]DEEPAKDarwin stands in the road as the enormous obstacle that religion never gotaround. So completely has the theory of evolution succeeded that most peoplecannot imagine a reasonable alternative. But it is possible to accept all thephysical remains of our ancestors, tracing Homo sapiens back to early primates,and still derive a different answer for where human life comes from.Spirituality holds that the origins of human life lie in a transcendent realmbeyond physical processes of any kind. We are mind first, matter later.According to Erwin Schrödinger, “What we observe as material bodies and forcesare nothing but shapes and variations on the structure of space.” If such astatement is true for the universe, it must be true for us, which means thatspace isn’t empty; at the source, it’s human (and a lot of other things, too).Jesus puts this much more poetically in the Gospel of Thomas when he says:“Split a piece of wood and I am there. Lift up a stone, and you will find methere.”So what does “human” mean, anyway? We are so complex and varied that there isroom to view our species from any perspective you choose. I find it easy to sitin an armchair and agree with Hamlet when he exclaims,What a piece of work is man, how noble in reason, how infinite in faculties; inform and moving how express and admirable, in action how like an angel, inapprehension how like a god!Suddenly I am transported back to the late Renaissance, to a world full ofconfidence, still holding on to the divine origin of human beings. But someoneelse could pick up an anthropology textbook and be transported just as quicklyto the Afar Triangle in northeast Ethiopia, where paleontologists have dug upthe oldest fossil remains of our hominid ancestors. Modern people are prone tobelieve in material things—skeletons, fossilized teeth, a hairline fractureshowing where an animal attacked—as convincing scientific evidence. At the sametime, bones and fossils discredited long-held concepts. It wasn’t just religionthat Darwin overthrew, but centuries of anthropocentrism, the belief that humanbeings are the most privileged creatures in creation. Suddenly we became nothingmore than links in a biological chain. Lucy, the most famous example ofAustralopithecus afarensis, is a long way from Hamlet: about 3.2 million years.Every step back brings us closer to the animal kingdom and further from God’sspecial dispensation.But we’d be going to the opposite extreme to assess what it means to be humansolely, or even mainly, from buried remains. It has been said that figuring outthe human mind through physical evidence is like putting a stethoscope to theoutside of the Houston Astrodome in order to learn the rules of baseball.Spirituality has no argument with paleontologists in their excitement overfinding a hominid even older than Lucy (the latest candidate, announced in 2009,is Ardi, short for Ardipithecus ramidus—a male skeleton that dates to 4.4million years ago, over a million years older than Lucy but far short of anundiscovered ancestor common to all hominids, targeted at around 10 millionyears ago). What spirituality does argue against is that any physical structuretells the whole story, either ancestral or present-day. Reductionism can followthe physical structure of the body down to the molecular and atomic level, butnowhere along that journey can physical traces tell us why we are creative, fullof wishes and dreams, unique and different from one another, capable of memory,or many other things that are central to our story. Just as we need a Theory ofEverything for physics, we need a theory of everything when it comes to beinghuman.In asking where human life arose, spirituality has two advantages over science.The first, which sounds the simplest, is actually the most profound:spirituality embraces unpredictability. To the ancient Vedic sages, the wholeuniverse was Lila, an expression of the playful, whimsical nature of God. Theelement of spontaneity cannot be dismissed from the human story. In thelaboratory you can make mice happy by feeding them, and every time they take anibble, a specific pleasure center in the brain will light up. You can go a stepfurther and train mice to expect food every time they hear a bell or buzzer (avariation on the famous Pavlovian conditioning of dogs). When the mice simplyhear this sound, the pleasure centers in their brain will light up, showing thatmice can anticipate pleasure, just as we do when we think of an upcomingvacation in the Bahamas or the perfect Christmas gift. Brain structures in miceand humans are analogous, but this similarity proves very little, because onbeing shown a plate of food, a human being can say such things as “I’m on adiet,” “It’s too rare; I like my meat well done,” “I’m too busy to eat,” and“What about the starving children in Africa?” We humans possess countlessresponses to the same stimuli. No model of the human brain can predict whichresponse you or I will choose, not just to food, but to anything at all.Unpredictability destroys all forms of determinism, and that’s fatal forphysical explanations, because physical systems are ruled by fixed processes. Acarbon atom can’t choose whether or not to bond with an oxygen atom. When theymeet, their interaction is determined. When two human beings meet, they mightnot have any chemistry at all!If you ask where unpredictability entered the evolutionary record (e.g., who wasthe first human to say, “You can have my mastodon rib, I’m not hungry”?),scientific answers do come back. We hear about selfish genes and altruisticgenes causing us to behave in certain very human ways. But even if you couldpinpoint a gene for selfishness and the opposite one for altruism, wouldn’t weneed a third gene to choose between them? After all, we can be both selfish andselfless. Where is the gene that shows me how to select this word from thethirty thousand-plus in my vocabulary, or the chemical reaction that dictateswhere I will eat lunch when faced with a choice of a hundred restaurants in amidsized city?The second advantage that spirituality enjoys over science is that it embracesthe richness of experience. You can break any brain response down to action andreaction, stimulus and response. Imagine a lemon with a knife sitting next toit. In your mind’s eye, see a hand pick up the knife and cut the lemon in half,then watch the juice being squeezed out. Almost everybody will salivate whiledoing this exercise, which to a reductionist means that we are like Pavlov’sdogs, who salivated when they heard a bell. But dogs don’t salivate to imaginarylemons, while we do that and much more: we create whole worlds in ourimagination. The richness of inner experience encompasses everything human; italso defines us. We thrive on meaning, and we languish and atrophy in itsabsence.Neuroscience probes for these qualities in brain tissue. Its worldview, and itsmethods, require such an approach. This gives rise to a strange blindness.Reductionists cannot, in my experience, be talked out of believing in a worldwhere physical processes can eventually explain meaning, purpose, and all therest. They would be better served by realizing a simple fact: you can’t startfrom a meaningless cosmos and get to the rich meaning of human life.Spirituality turns the telescope around and looks at experience first. Then, ifyou ask where human life originated, your answer is that what really matters hasno beginning or end. Human life is embedded in the domain beyond space-time,like everything else. From the Gospel of Thomas comes this passage: “If they sayto you, ‘Where have you come from?’ say to them, ‘We came from the light, theplace where the light came into being of its own accord.’ ” The beauty of thispassage is that it is equally true for science and for spirituality."},{"pageContent":"[../images/00010.jpeg]LEONARDIn 1522 townspeople in the district of Autun, France, were angered to discoverthat rats had eaten their crop of barley. The rats did not own the barley, andhad not been authorized to eat it. The villagers went to court and obtained asummons ordering the rats to stand trial. Sounds strange, but in Exodus it says,“If an ox gore a man or a woman that they die, then the ox shall surely bestoned,” so why should rats be above the law? Indeed, according to records,throughout Europe from the ninth through the nineteenth century, a wide varietyof animals that violated human laws were put on trial just as people were. Oxen,pigs, and bulls were jailed, tortured for confessions, and even hung by the samehangmen who executed humans. In Autun a court official went to an area of thecountryside where the alleged offenders were believed to reside, and read, quiteloudly, a solemn notice demanding that the rats appear in court. When theydidn’t show up, a court-appointed attorney for their defense argued that moretime was needed for them to make the journey to the courthouse. When they againfailed to appear, their attorney argued that they could not be expected to riskdeath by hostile cats in order to obey the summons. These trials were not reallyabout revenge against evil animals. Legal systems are about more than punishmentand deterrence. They are about maintaining the social order, and in these casesthe need to follow society’s rules trumped any doubts that birds have souls,bees are capable of evil intent, or field mice can engineer fraud.Our organization into social networks is a distinguishing feature of ourspecies. Certainly social order is found not just among humans, but also amonganimals like ants, termites, and bees. One of our fellow mammals also lives inhighly organized societies—the naked mole rat. Naked mole rats make their homesin subterranean hives supported by a specialized workforce, and sustained by asingle breeding queen. On its own, a naked mole rat could not keep warm, obtainfood, or avoid predators, and so it wouldn’t last long. But even thewell-socialized mole rat, upon bumping into others of its species, does notwonder if their search for food has left them stressed out, contemplate how theyfeel about the predator situation, or raise the issue of the starving rodents inAfrica. A human being, on the other hand, might help an elderly stranger acrossthe street, wonder how another person is feeling, or not trust a doctor whowears a nose ring. And humans have developed culture, which other species haveonly in rudimentary form. People are natural mimics, so even when we still livedin the wild, we were capable of learning new things, actions that went beyondthe instinctive, by watching one another, an advantage most other species don’tenjoy. It might have taken bears thousands of generations to evolve their thickfur, but all our species needed was a single human to get the idea that we couldskin a bear to make a fur coat, thus enabling our species to stay warm foreverafter. Today we build on human discoveries made over the course of millennia,and share our knowledge worldwide.The bonds cementing human society are far more complex than they are among otheranimals. Even among our closest mammalian relatives, our social abilities standout. The taxonomic family to which human beings belong is called the hominids,and our genus, a kind of “subfamily” of closer relatives, is called Homo. Ourspecies, Homo sapiens, is one of more than a dozen within the Homo genus, thebest-known of these besides ourselves being Neanderthals, Homo habilis, and Homoerectus, all of which, of course, have long since died out—possibly because ofthe lack of those social abilities. Many of these nonhuman species engaged inhumanlike activities, such as using tools, harnessing fire, interring the dead,and engaging in cultural rituals such as painting their bodies. But none livedin societies nearly as complex as our own.What unique talents have we humans developed to enable us to interact soeffectively with so many others, to live in cities exceeding a million or eventen (or more) million inhabitants? One is language. Not only does languagefacilitate intensely social interactions; it also allows the transmission ofknowledge across society, and through the generations. Dolphins and monkeysmight exchange signals, but only humans have the capacity to explain complexnuances to our children. A moral code is also important. Our primate ancestorsmay not have had to worry about a society gone amok due to investment fraud, butin general people living together have always done better if they have felt areluctance to bash one another’s skulls with a rock. It might seem we humans arealways at war, but our hesitance to kill is actually so strong that a U.S. Armysurvey during World War II concluded that 80 percent of field combatantscouldn’t bring themselves to shoot at the enemy, even when attacked.Human beings also engage in altruism far more deliberately and pervasively thanany other species, and certain structures in our brain linked to rewardprocessing are engaged when we participate in acts of mutual cooperation. Evensix-month-olds evaluate others based on their social behavior. Infants in oneexperiment observed a “climber” consisting of a disk of wood with large eyesglued onto one of its circular faces. The climber started off on a hill, andrepeatedly tried but failed to make its way to the top. Occasionally, after sometime passed, a “helper triangle”—a triangle with similar eyes gluedon—approached from below and aided the climber with an upward push. Other timesa “hinderer square” approached from uphill and shoved the circular climber backdown. The experimenters were investigating whether infants, unaffected anduninvolved bystanders, would cop an attitude toward the hinderer squares. And,judging by the infants’ tendency to reach for the helper triangles rather thanthe hinderer squares, they did. Moreover, when the experiment was repeated witheither a helper and a neutral bystander block or a hinderer and a neutral block,the infants preferred the friendly triangles to the neutral block, and theneutral block to the nasty squares. Long before we can verbalize attraction orrevulsion, we have a sense of social morality—we are attracted to those who arekind and repulsed by the unkind.Another quality that distinguishes humans from other species is our desire andability to understand what others of our species think and feel. That ability iscalled “theory of mind,” or “ToM” for short. ToM allows us to make sense ofother people’s past behavior, and to predict how their behavior will unfoldgiven their present or future circumstances. Only humans have socialorganization and relationships that make high demands on an individual’s ToM,and though scientists are still debating whether nonhuman primates use ToM, ifthey do, it seems to be at a rudimentary level. In humans, though, simple ToMdevelops in the first year, and by age four, nearly all children develop theability to assess other people’s mental states. It’s what enables us to formlarge and sophisticated social systems, from farming communities to largecorporations. When it breaks down, as in cases of autism, people can have adifficult time functioning in society.All these qualities—especially ToM—require a certain amount of brain power, andso the survival advantages of social interaction may be an even more importantfactor in the evolution of the human brain than the skills and decision-makingabilities the brain makes possible.The capacities we’ve been discussing go to the heart of what makes us human, andwe are getting ever more sophisticated in our ability to map the areas of thebrain that are responsible for them. But Deepak looks to something less tangiblefor the source of our humanity, something that goes beyond the physical.Deepak argues that spirituality has the advantage of including unpredictabilityand spontaneity as key elements in the “human story.” He says that to look forthe physical basis of humanity’s essence will fail, because we areunpredictable, and “unpredictability destroys all forms of determinism” and sois “fatal for physical explanations.” That’s not in fact true. Quantum theory,for example, is famous for the limits it places on predictability, andphysicists do fine with that. Even without resorting to the esoteric laws ofquantum theory we can find many examples of unpredictability that do not violatethe laws of the material world. One such example is the dwarf planet Pluto,which has been shown to follow a chaotic orbit, meaning that its path, in thelong run, cannot be predicted—but that doesn’t mean Pluto is disobeying Newton’slaws. Or consider the path of a simple stone rolling down a rocky hill. Nophysicist believes that he or she can predict it, but neither would anyonebelieve the path taken by the stone is beyond physical explanation. A hurricane,in taking its unpredictable path, seems to have a mind of its own, but itdoesn’t really.The real issue in Deepak’s argument is free will, and though the question offree will has important implications for our view of ourselves, from thepractical standpoint, it is actually of questionable relevance. That’s becausewhether or not people have free will in principle, in practice it appears thatwe do because our behavior is so difficult to predict. There is no contradictionin saying that our decisions are determined by the laws of physics, yet we stilldon’t know how to reliably predict behavior. Human beings, like the dwarf planetPluto, may well be so complex that our actions and decisions will forever remainto some extent unpredictable. But to say we cannot predict people’s actions is astatement about our powers of prediction, not a statement about whether we havefree will.Deepak writes that a carbon atom can’t choose to bond with another carbon atom,but (he implies) what makes humans special is that we can choose, that we havefree will. Free will is a tremendously fraught issue. Modern psychology andneuroscience have addressed it employing a range of techniques, from directelectrical stimulation of the brain to cutting-edge neuroimaging and animalneurophysiology. And indeed, science is challenging our intuitive andtraditional understanding of human choice: experiment after experiment seems toindicate that our choices are far more automatic and constrained than we’d liketo think. Take your taste in facial beauty. That feels very personal, defined byyour individual sensibilities, though perhaps influenced also by the culture inwhich you live. But numerous studies show that men and women, regardless ofculture and independent of race, generally agree on which faces are mostattractive—and that these preferences emerge very early in life. The key? Faceswhich possess features closest to average are considered the most appealing. Soif you want movie star material the recipe is simple: toss one hundred randommale or female faces into a specialized computer graphics program, and averagethem. It’s not romantic, but it works—the faces that result from suchmanipulations are those we find beautiful. Our sense of morality, too, seems tobe largely hardwired. Studies show that when confronted with a situation wherequestions of morality might arise, people seem to very quickly, andunconsciously, reach a moral judgment first, and only a split second laterconsciously construct reasons—based either on practical or on religiousvalues—to justify how they feel.The evidence so far supports the view that the physical arrangements of all theatoms and molecules, and the laws of nature that govern them, determine ourfuture actions in the same way that they determine the actions of the sun, orthe growth of a rosebud. But science has not proved that there is no immaterialconsciousness that makes our decisions, nor is it clear that it ever can provethe absence of a phenomenon, such as a “soul,” that has no physicalmanifestation. All science can really say is that if it existed, we think itseffects on the material realm would have been noticed, and that, until now,there has never been any credible evidence for it.It can be difficult to accept that nature, rather than some version of animmaterial self that transcends nature’s laws, governs our actions. And it’svery hard to see ourselves accurately, objectively. Our judgments are all madein the framework of our prior beliefs and expectations, which are themselvesoften influenced by our desires. Illusions expert Al Seckel offered me astriking demonstration of how expectation can shape beliefs. It started out withan excerpt from a Led Zeppelin song:If there’s a bustle in your hedgerow, don’t be alarmed now,It’s just a spring clean for the May queen.The next few lines go on to say that though there are various ways to live yourlife, you can always change your direction. After playing the song Seckel playedit again backward, an effect easily achieved employing sound-editing software.It seems absurd to expect that a singer’s voice could make linguistic senseplayed both forward and backward, and indeed, I listened to the backward versionseveral times, and just as I assumed, it sounded like total gibberish. Seckel,however, claimed that this song did make sense when played backward, and thatLed Zeppelin intended it to. To help me hear the message he said was encoded inthat version, he offered me a framework—a printed-out version of the text to thebackward lyrics, so that I could read along as I listened. Here is what it said:Oh here’s to my sweet Satan. The one whoseLittle path would make me sad, whose power is Satan. He’llgive those with him 666, there was a little tool shed wherehe made us suffer, sad Satan.I expected that when listening yet one more time, I’d find that the backwardsong still sounded like gibberish, but this time, when I followed the text, itwas striking how closely the words really matched. I was now convinced thatSeckel was right, and I had a difficult time understanding how I could havemissed comprehending those words the first few times! I was astonished. ThenSeckel told me Led Zeppelin didn’t really encode a satanic message. Seckel saidthey were made up. One could have made up other sets of words that fit thegibberish, he said, and I would have believed the song said them, had heprovided those lyrics to me instead.When perceiving the world without prejudice, as I had at first, our minds judgethe world quite differently than when assessing it in the context of a belief orexpectation, as I did after Seckel gave me the text. That is also true of theway we perceive ourselves. Our “self” is the most fundamental element of ourworld, and we do not approach the subject of “me” without bias or prejudice. Isour intuitive feeling about the special place our species holds in the universe(and about the free will that makes us so special) correct, like ourunderstanding of the song lyrics? Or is it an illusion of our subjectivity, likeour understanding of those lyrics when played backward?How would we judge ourselves and humanity from the outside, if we weren’t one ofthem? Advanced aliens would probably group us with squirrels and mice—lowerbeings that are mere automata—while perhaps believing that they themselves aredifferent, that they are the only truly intelligent species, and the onlyspecies with free will. But according to the evidence of science so far, theytoo would be wrong. We are all governed by the same physics, the physics of thismaterial world. I admit it feels strange to think of myself as a biologicalmachine governed by the same laws that govern Pluto. But understanding myessence doesn’t diminish my appreciation for the gift of being alive; it makesme appreciate it even more. That’s not a scientific principle. It’s just the wayI feel.dy>"},{"pageContent":"10"},{"pageContent":"[../images/00009.jpeg]HOW DO GENES WORK?"},{"pageContent":"[../images/00010.jpeg]LEONARDOn April 25, 1953, two young researchers at Cambridge University inEngland—James Watson and Francis Crick—published a paper in the journal Naturearguing that the structure of DNA consisted of two interlocking strands arrangedin a double helix, something like a twisted chain ladder. In their proposedmodel each rung of the ladder consisted of a molecule called a base from onechain, paired with a complementary base from the other chain. As a result, ifyou pulled the chains apart, each of them could act as a template from which anew complementary partner could be created. In this manner, one molecule of DNAcould turn into two. Watson and Crick’s article was brief and contained only onesentence that hinted at its implications: “It has not escaped our notice thatthe specific pairing we have postulated suggests a possible copying mechanismfor the genetic material.”Watson and Crick’s publication came almost exactly two years before Einstein’sdeath. Unlike Einstein’s general relativity, their work was neither a greatconceptual leap nor an advance that would have been greatly delayed had they notgotten there first. But it did mark the beginning of a new era in biology, whichallowed scientists to study the details of inheritance on the molecular level.No one knew where that investigation would lead, although Watson and Crickpublished a speculative paper about the meaning of their work a month later. InJune the New York Times ran an article with the timid headline “Clue toChemistry of Heredity Found,” along with a cautionary statement from famedCaltech chemist Linus Pauling that he “did not believe the problem ofunderstanding molecular genetics had been finally solved.” Pauling—who the nextyear would win the first of his two Nobel Prizes—was right.How complex is the mechanism of heredity? Today, some sixty years later,tremendous progress has been made, but thousands of scientists are still workingout the details.The idea of evolution goes back at least to the ancient Greeks, but what manyconsider the first coherent theory of the subject—involving the concept ofinherited traits—was proposed around 1800, decades before Darwin, by the Frenchscientist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. According to Darwinian evolution, new traits,such as the giraffe’s long neck, arise through mutations, which make it possiblethat the traits of a child might not correspond to the traits of either parent.If, given the environment, that new trait turns out to provide an advantage, thechild will thrive, reproduce, and pass the mutation on to subsequentgenerations. But Lamarck believed that animals’ traits are not limited to theeffects of their heredity. He proposed that traits can change during anorganism’s lifetime in order to allow it to best adapt to its environment, andthat the organism’s newly developed traits can then be passed to the nextgeneration. In this view, for example, if a giraffe were suddenly moved to anenvironment with taller trees, its neck might grow longer, in which casesubsequent offspring could be born with longer necks. Today we call that processsoft inheritance. It is not the way evolution normally operates, though recentlyscientists have discovered that such processes do occur, spawning a field calledepigenetics, which I will return to later.Both Darwinian and Lamarckian theories of evolution raise a crucial question:how are traits passed from parent to child? In 1865 Czech monk Gregor Mendelpresented a paper showing that certain traits in peas, such as shape and color,are passed along in discrete packages we now call genes, but his work wentunappreciated until the turn of the century. Meanwhile, the molecule we now callDNA was discovered in 1869 by Friedrich Miescher, a Swiss physician studyingwhite blood cells he obtained from the pus in surgical bandages. Miescher didn’tknow what the substance was good for, but he knew there was a lot of it—there isin fact enough DNA in almost every human cell to make a strand about six feetlong.The connection between genes and DNA didn’t get made until 1944. Before that, ifthere was one thing scientists were confident about, it was that DNA was not themolecule of heredity. That is because DNA seemed far too simple—it was known tobe made of just four different components, called nucleotides. (Each nucleotideconsists of a base, as I mentioned—one of four different types—plus two othersmall molecules, a sugar and a phosphate molecule, which we now know form thespine of the DNA.) Then in 1944, after many years of intricate experiments, ashy sixty-seven-year-old researcher named Oswald Avery and his colleagues showedthat if DNA was extracted from dead bacteria and injected into a live strain, itcaused permanent changes in the DNA and traits of the live strain, which wereinherited by subsequent generations. Avery’s work inspired a search to discoverthe structure of that mystery molecule, culminating in Watson and Crick’sdiscovery of the double helix in 1953.Roughly speaking, in modern parlance a gene is a region of an organism’s DNAthat contains instructions for making a particular protein. Biologists say thatthe gene “codes for” the protein. The code, or recipe, is written using justfour letters—A, C, G, and T, which stand for the four bases that make up DNA—butthe recipe book is a long one, containing over three billion pairs of bases.When the recipe is used successfully to create the protein product, the gene issaid to have been “expressed.” The proteins are all cooked up from a pantry ofjust twenty amino acids. Proteins constitute much of any organism’s physicalstructure, are involved in virtually every cell function, and control all thechemical processes inside the cell. Each of our bodies contains over a hundredthousand different proteins, including our hormones, enzymes, antibodies, andtransport molecules such as hemoglobin.The traits we inherit are determined by the proteins our bodies produce, whichare in turn dictated by the recipes in our genes. The cookbook containing allthose recipes is an opus of many volumes called the genome, the differentvolumes of which are called chromosomes. We all have distinct characteristics,some due to our environment and experiences, others arising from our heredity.Since each of us has a different heredity, my genome is different from yours.What, then, does it mean to speak of “the human genome”?Our personal differences seem great to us. Some of us would rather shovel snowthan listen to opera, while others can’t imagine a world without La traviata.Some propose marriage over a quiet picnic on the beach, others at a table nextto a drunken rugby team at the Outback Steakhouse. But on the level of genes,what makes us alike is far, far greater than what makes us different: thegenomes of any two human beings typically differ by only about one letter out ofeach thousand. They are virtually identical, like copies of the same book thatdiffer only in their misprints.The misprint metaphor is apt here: our genetic differences arose throughmutations—random changes in the genetic letters—that occurred over themillennia. These mutations account for that part of human variability that isnot due to differences in experience or environment, such as our differing bloodtypes, hair and skin colors, and facial features, and perhaps even for why someof us can carry a tune, while the singing of others could be used to keep ratsout of the basement.All told, humans are now thought to have about twenty-three thousand genes.That’s fewer than a newt has, or a grape, which is bound to make those whobelieve that bigger is better a bit uncomfortable. That illustrates the dangersof oversimplified thinking, and indeed though I’ve given the big picture of howgenes are connected to traits, it is important to keep in mind that it is agreatly simplified version. For example, each cell has not one, but two copiesof the recipe book, since we receive one intact genome from each of our parents.When the recipes conflict, sometimes one prevails over the other, but at othertimes some sort of compromise is made, or a completely different protein iscreated. Also, many genes contribute recipes for more than one protein—almosthalf of our genes are spliced in order to produce multiple proteins, which iswhy we can have more than a hundred thousand proteins but just twenty-threethousand genes.The effect of a gene also depends a great deal on what is called “generegulation”—processes that determine whether the recipe dictated by the gene isactually carried out or, as we say, expressed. On the molecular level generegulation occurs when certain chemicals interact with parts of the DNA moleculeto inactivate a gene. As a result, for example, two identical twins—who bydefinition have the same DNA—can be strikingly different. In rodents calledagouti mice one twin can be thin and brown, while the other is obese and yellow.Such obese yellow mice result from environmental effects. These mice occuroccasionally in natural conditions, but when pregnant agouti mice are exposed toa chemical called bisphenol A, present in many plastic drink bottles,significantly more obese yellow mice are born. It was found that as a result ofthe exposure, the DNA of the offspring have less “methylation,” a process thatturns off genes. This causes more than the usual amount of a certain protein tobe produced, which in some mice has two disparate effects—one in the skin(blocking cells from making black pigment) and the other in the brain (affectingfeeding behavior). Though giraffes don’t develop long necks by stretching towardtrees, as Lamarck believed, the expression of genes—and hence the makeup of anindividual—can, through gene regulation, be profoundly affected by theenvironment, and you don’t need chemical toxins to do it. Himalayan rabbits, forexample, carry a gene required for the development of pigment. But the gene isinactive in temperatures above 95 degrees Fahrenheit, which is below therabbits’ body temperature—except at their extremities, which are cooler. As aresult, Himalayan rabbits are white, with black ears, nose tips, and feet.Changes in traits that, like these, are due to mechanisms other than a change inthe underlying DNA are called epigenetic. Because of gene regulation andepigenetic changes, there can be many characteristics within an organism (of anyspecies) which did not arise at conception, but rather are a reflection of theinteraction between the genome and the information in the organism’senvironment, from its time in the womb onward through life. In a few cases theseepigenetic changes have been observed to continue through many generations.These instances correspond to the Lamarckian view of evolution, in which traitsthat change within the lifetime of an individual can be passed on to thatindividual’s descendants.Another complication to the simple picture is that only 1 or 2 percent of thegenome corresponds to the genes I described above, the recipes for proteins. Therest was mislabeled “junk DNA” by scientists before anyone understood itspurpose, but it has since been discovered that most of this “intergenic” or“noncoding” DNA—terms now preferred by scientists—does indeed serve an importantfunction. About half of it stabilizes the structure of the chromosome, which isa strand of DNA packaged in a protein. Other sequences define where genes beginand end, something like the capital letter and period that play the same role inlanguage. Sequences called pseudogenes are copies of normal genes that contain adefect that prevents their expression as proteins. They used to be thought of asvestigial—perhaps the only true “junk” in our genome—but a breakthrough in 2010indicated that they may play an important epigenetic role, keeping their normalgene sisters from becoming deactivated.If this all seems complicated, that’s good, because living things arecomplicated. In computer programming a “kludge” is an ad hoc and perhaps cleverbut inelegant alteration to a program to accomplish some added purpose, or maybeto fix a bug. A program with many kludges can be complex and difficult for anoutsider to decipher. But kludges are how evolution operates. For example, ourancestors needed a tail and we still have the gene for making one; rather thanneatly excising it when the need for the tail disappeared, natural selectionjust turned the gene off.Although the general ideas of science can often be described succinctly, thereis an awesome complexity to biological systems that doesn’t come through in suchaccounts. One might describe the hippocampus as a tiny structure deep in thebrain that plays an important role in emotion and long-term memory, and as faras it goes that is quite accurate; but the standard textbook on the hippocampusis several inches thick. Another recent work, an academic article reviewingresearch on the interneurons—just one type of nerve cell in another part of thebrain called the hypothalamus—was over a hundred pages long and cited sevenhundred intricate experiments. Few of us would have the patience or the abilityto digest such publications, but fortunately for the human body of knowledge,there are those among us, shaped by who knows what interplay between theirgenome and their environment, who consider them compelling reading.Being human, we often hope for simple links, like an easy correspondence betweena single gene and a trait or a disease, and scientists sometimes find them—as incystic fibrosis and sickle-cell anemia. Deepak’s metaphysics is always free tooffer easy but vague answers and unsupported statements such as “You can’t startfrom a meaningless cosmos and get to the rich meaning of human life” or “Humanlife is embedded in the domain beyond space-time,” but science must give answersthat are true, as determined by experiment, and the truth is rarely simple.The richness of life comes from its complexity. It is a great gift that one canlive and love and function as a being, the cooperative effort of thousands oftrillions of cells, intricately and elaborately organized. And yet amidst alllife’s complexity one can still find unity. I said above that it is only 0.1percent of our genes that differentiate one human from another. The genedifference between a person and a chimpanzee is only about fifteen times that—weshare 98.5 percent of our genes with those primate cousins. And we share over 90percent with mice, and 60 percent with the lowly fruit fly. There seems to beintegrity to life on Earth, resulting from its common basis, the molecule ofDNA.We are all here—from the grape to the fruit fly to the human—carrying our DNAforward. Every creature on Earth is a unique expression of it. But unique aseach one is, all organisms share the same evolutionary mandate: to promulgatetheir own special version of that extraordinary molecule that—in 1869, in theguise of a being called Friedrich Miescher—made the discovery of its ownexistence."},{"pageContent":"[../images/00010.jpeg]DEEPAKFrom a spiritual perspective, my role isn’t to argue against Leonard’s fineaccount of how genes have evolved into the rich complexity that they displaytoday. In all the great questions that face us, science is our best means ofdescribing physical events. But spiritually speaking, genes exist to do morethan provide a recipe book for life. Let’s see what that “more” is, whichcontains many surprises.I attach great importance to the small number of human genes, but it takes a bitof discussion to show why. As the Human Genome Project was nearing completion in2003, bets were informally placed. Would it turn out that we possess 80,000genes, or 120,000? It was assumed, as the most advanced species on the planet,that our complexity required far more genes than any other species. What ashock, then, when the number came in at between 20,000 and 25,000, about thesame number as a chicken or a lowly worm like the nematode. Corn had more genes,which was baffling. We experienced a minor version of the shock that hit theVictorians when Darwin revealed that Homo sapiens, like all mammals, wasdescended from fish.In both cases the shock proved highly productive. As Leonard has described sowell, inheritance is far more flexible than anyone ever supposed fifty or eventwenty years ago. At that time we were getting to the point where “my genes mademe do it” was turning into a universal explanation: my genes made me overeat,caused my depression, reduced my sex drive, made me suicidal, or made me abeliever in God. The code of life was being interpreted like a code of law.Cells are not fixed structures, however; they are fluid, changing, and dynamic.They respond to thoughts and feelings; they adapt to the environment with allthe unpredictability of a person. For anyone who values life’s richpossibilities, that’s very good news.When schoolchildren are taught about the double helix, the example used over andover is that there is a gene for blue eyes, another for blond hair, and yetanother for freckles. This gives the impression that one gene equals one trait,but that is the exception, not the rule. I mentioned before how frustrating itwas for geneticists to discover that what should be a simple link to how tall achild will grow has turned out to be a complex, dynamic process involving notjust twenty different genes but a host of outside factors from the environment.Alzheimer’s or cancer seems to involve even more genes.As a result of this murkiness, geneticists eager to fulfill the promise of DNAto improve human life are redoubling their efforts. Since that’s also aspiritual goal, how can the two join forces? One way is to quickly get pastchemical determinism. The public is still being told that there might be a“criminal gene,” for example, that explains antisocial behavior. There’sspeculation that such a gene could even be offered as a defense in court, and itwouldn’t be a big step to propose that antisocial genes could be removed throughsome kind of medical procedure, say, for the good of the criminal and society asa whole. But as genetics is being forced to abandon the simplistic notion offinding a single gene to fit every disorder, there is an opening forspirituality, which stands for free will, consciousness, creativity, andpersonal transformation—the opposite of chemical determinism. We shouldcelebrate being released from our genetic shackles, while at the same timeseeking more insight into how genes relate to consciousness.DNA is treated by biologists like any other chemical sequence, but its behaviorbreaks the rules of mere objects. It spontaneously divides itself in half,turning into two identical versions of itself. It encodes life but also death,since there’s a gene for cancer that must be triggered for malignancies todevelop. Why in the world would evolution retain such a gene when its wholepurpose is to sustain life? And at an even more basic level, how do genes makeinanimate chemicals like hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen come to life?Tracing these issues back to the genome is a feature of materialism. Instead offlying in the face of facts, the spiritual perspective calls for expanded facts.Without them, we can’t hope to solve, for example, how DNA deals with time.Genes precisely time their actions years or decades in advance. Baby teeth,puberty, menstruation, male-pattern baldness, the onset of menopause—all theseappear on a timetable; the same may also apply to cancer, which is largely adisease of old age. How does a chemical keep track of time? I asked a cellbiologist that question and he pointed to telomeres, genetic material that capsthe ends of genes like a dangling tail. (We previously touched on them indiscussing the nature of time.) Telomeres bring a genetic word to a stop, theway that a period brings this sentence to a stop. But telomeres degrade overtime, and aging could be based on their growing shorter and shorter, leading tocellular degradation and higher risk of harmful mutations.But if the telomere really is like a clock, where did it get its sense oftiming? Rocks are worn down by wind and rain, but that doesn’t make them clocks.Besides, how can telomeres lead to the harmful effects of aging and also to thebeneficial effects of losing your baby teeth and passing into puberty? Even moremysteriously, DNA coordinates many different clocks simultaneously, since thetimings of the processes I mentioned are very different from one another.Menopause obeys a clock that takes decades to unfold, while the steadyproduction of enzymes in a cell takes a few hundredths of a second, red bloodcorpuscles follow a life cycle of a few months, and so on.The reader will see where this is going. Genes don’t behave like ordinarythings, because they serve consciousness. Timing requires a mind, and leavingmind out of the equation fatally flaws any genetic theory. To a materialist, thethought of mind outside the body is outlandish, but there is simply too muchthat mindless, random chemical reactions cannot explain. At bottom, a deepspiritual issue is at stake: free will versus determinism. At first, determinismwas just physical, but lately it has been invoked to rule human behavior, too;whether you’re acting criminally, depressed, or awed before God, the argument isthe same: if genes cause X, and you cannot change the genes that you’re bornwith, then X is here to stay.Everyday experience belies this logic; none of us feels controlled by thenucleus of our cells. Leonard allows for environmental influence on our genes. Iwould make it a decisive factor. Identical twins offer a good test case. Theyare born with the same genes, but as life progresses, twins make differentchoices and go through different experiences. One twin may run away with thecircus while the other joins a convent. One may become an alcoholic while theother becomes a vegan. By age seventy, the expression of their genes will becompletely different from the perfect match they displayed at birth. In otherwords, the chromosomes haven’t altered, but the genes that got triggered, alongwith the products they produce in the tissues, have widely diverged. The escaperoute from chemical determinism was always there, waiting to be used.Genes have no effect until they are switched on; they remain mute, as it were.When they do speak, a lifetime of experiences shapes the words expressed, eventhough the starting point is the same alphabet. Genes don’t tell our story; theygive us the letters to tell our own story, and that genetic expression can bepositive or negative. If twin A habitually lives with low sleep, high stress, abad diet, and no exercise, such a lifestyle is likely to lead to drasticoutcomes compared to those for twin B, who has chosen the opposite lifestyle.Studies in positive lifestyle choices by Dr. Dean Ornish and his research teamhave shown that more than four hundred genes change their expression in apositive way if someone practices the well-known preventive measures of diet,exercise, stress management, and good sleep.In a word, the tables have been turned. Where genes used to take responsibilityoff our shoulders for the things we don’t like about ourselves, now they havebecome the servants of the choices we make. “Soft inheritance” is happeningevery second, as your cells adapt to the instructions you give them. For decadeswe’ve known that depressed people are at higher risk for disease, as are lonelypeople, the recently widowed, and executives who have been forced out of theirjobs. The body can’t respond to such traumas without genes being involved, butback when genes were considered fixed, permanent, and unchangeable, no onethought much about the connection between the environment and DNA.(“Environment” in this case is a broad term to cover any outside influence on acell.) Now doctors routinely warn pregnant mothers that they put their fetusesat risk by smoking and drinking, for instance, since we know that toxicchemicals in the bloodstream degrade the environment of an unborn child.The next step was to show that toxic behavior can have the same effect. For along time it was assumed that embryos develop automatically from the blueprintof the DNA inherited from their parents. As long as the fetus received the rightnutrients in the womb, the theory went, the blueprint would unfold stage bystage until a baby was born. But as Professor Pathik Wadhwa, a specialist inobstetrics and behavioral science at the University of California, Irvine, putsit, “This view has more or less been completely turned upside down.… At eachstage of development, the [fetus] uses cues from its environment to decide howbest to construct itself within the parameters of its genes.”Suddenly we find that we can add a new chapter to autopoiesis, or self-creation.The unborn embryo is part of a complex feedback loop, assessing the present tocreate a future for itself. DNA does the same thing. It takes cues from aperson’s thoughts, moods, diet, and stress levels (to simplify the thousands ofchemical signals coming into a cell at any given moment), and based on thosecues, it expresses itself. A stressed-out mother passes on higher stresshormones to the fetus. Premature birth is then a risk; so is much else.Professor Wadhwa continues, “The fetus builds itself permanently to deal withthis kind of high-stress environment, and once it’s born may be at greater riskfor a whole bunch of stress-related pathologies.”Where does that leave us? Our knowledge of medicine and biology has been shakento the core. Genes do not control themselves. They are controlled by the entiremind-body system: in others words, we aren’t pawns but masters of our genes,which respond to everything we think and do. The signals from the epigene, thesheath of proteins that surrounds our DNA, are capable of causing thirtythousand different expressions from a single gene. The program of life isdynamic, constantly changing, and under our influence insofar as we make good orbad choices.More and more, researchers are realizing that genes are more like rheostats thanlike on-off switches. Areas of “junk DNA” are vitally important, as Leonardtouches upon, since they decide which genes to turn on, how much activity a geneexpresses, when the activity occurs, and how it relates to thousands of othergenes. But as we now know, these genes don’t control themselves. No one can tellthe final story of the gene until it includes the way in which we metabolizeexperience. The epigene shows us that even invisible things like stress turninto bodily processes; whatever you feel, every cell in your body also feels.None of this comes as a surprise to those of us who work in the realm ofspirituality. The very basis of the spiritual worldview is that everything isentangled and interconnected; one process diversifies into thousands of specificprocesses without losing its wholeness.I find myself deeply moved when I reread some lines from the great Bengali poet,Rabindranath Tagore, as he addresses his creator. “Time is endless in yourhands, my Lord. There is none to count your minutes. Days and nights pass. Youknow how to wait. Your centuries follow each other perfecting a wild flower.” Idon’t read these words theistically, based on the existence of the God of anyparticular faith. What moves me is the patience and intricate workings of cosmicintelligence, which moves through us in order to create us, as life unfolds fromwithin itself.dy>"},{"pageContent":"11"},{"pageContent":"[../images/00009.jpeg]DID DARWIN GO WRONG?"},{"pageContent":"[../images/00010.jpeg]DEEPAKSpirituality owes heartfelt thanks to Charles Darwin, although he would besurprised to hear it. When people wake up all around the world with similaraspirations—“I want to better myself, I want to grow, I want to fulfill mypotential”—they are taking personal advantage of Darwin’s great discovery,evolution. Darwin didn’t intend for people to think of their personal evolution,much less their spiritual evolution. A disillusioned theology student whoharbored a bitter distrust of the Victorian God—benign, merciful, and a lovingfather to humankind—Darwin struck the decisive blow against that God. The theoryof evolution liberated science from religion, toppled the myth of perfection inNature, and supplied an airtight mechanism for how each species came into being.Yet great ideas spread far beyond their discoverer’s control. Darwin’s blowagainst perfection was also a blow against sin, the “human stain” that could beatoned for but would always return. Evolution opened a way to escape the trap ofsin by offering hope for progress in all aspects of life, although it took along time for such a humane implication to strike home. At first people seizedon another aspect of Darwin’s theory: the violent struggle for survival thatleft only the fittest standing. Alpha-male industrialists could abuse theirworkers on the grounds that Nature intended the strong to rule over the weak,and tyrants could justify themselves the same way. But today it is in theinterest of spirituality to promote evolution over materialism. Where Darwinwent wrong was to see evolution as a mindless mechanism. Spirituality canrestore it as a mindful way to make life better, through higher consciousness.Wake up and evolve.It’s fascinating to follow the bright-eyed young naturalist as he set sail forSouth America in 1826 on the HMS Beagle, a voyage that would last five years. Hedug up the fossilized skulls of giant extinct mammals and wondered how theyrelated to present-day mammals. He pondered why the sea iguanas of the GalápagosIslands, among all iguanas in the world, took to the ocean for their food. Herode on the backs of six-hundred-pound Galápagos tortoises (it’s easy to getthem going with the tap of a stick, but much harder to keep from slipping off),and he speculated why the shells of tortoises from each island were subtlydistinct from those on neighboring islands, having perhaps a larger flare at thebottom, a slightly different color, or a helmet-like extension at the front thatcovered the beast’s head.These oddments and observations gathered in Darwin’s head, and once he got backhome to England, his thinking went into a feverish state. After bouts of writingwhen ideas poured out of him as if on their own, he eventually hit upon the ideathat has been called the most brilliant ever conceived: the tree of evolutionthat links all living things. In Darwin’s system, adaptation is the drivingforce behind evolution. Gazelles have adapted to outrun lions. Clownfish haveadapted to hide safely amid the poisonous tentacles of sea anemones. Humans haveadapted to use opposable thumbs so that we can make better tools (and weapons).Species change. A single evolutionary tree grows thousands upon thousands ofbranches, and some die off while others thrive and flower.Evolution is invoked by eager atheists to grind into dust everything that theword “God” implies. But atheists are fighting yesterday’s battles. Todayevolution is bringing people closer to God. Darwin devised a perfect physicalmechanism only for the life-forms that preceded us. As long as mountain gorillasstruggle for food and breeding rights, some will be more successful than others.Dominant males can pass on their genes while submissive males sit by sullenlyand envy them. Taller trees will stretch for sunlight while shorter ones witherin their shade. But Homo sapiens has evolved beyond mere survival of thefittest. We raise food for each other. We nurse our weak, giving their genes asgreat a chance of being passed on as the genes of the strong. Darwin’s universalmechanism stopped applying to us the moment our species learned to shelter ourgenes, even recessive ones, from the forces of Nature. Gazelles and clownfishdon’t tape reminders on the bathroom mirror saying, “Note to self: Remember toevolve today.” For them, evolution is automatic. That’s no longer true for us.Spirituality can be seen as a higher form of evolution, best described as“metabiological”—beyond biology. We have been on this track for at least 200,000years. Our ancestors, such as Neanderthal man and Homo erectus, were preparingthe way as far back as 1.8 million years ago. When they chipped stone axes outof flint, our ancestors thought out what they were doing. Once you wake up witha desire to do something besides eat and breed, you start choosing X over Y.Conscious decision making turns the future into a series of choices.Neanderthals were advanced enough to place their dead in cave tombs, and someevidence suggests that the deceased were decorated with ornaments. Beauty, itseems, had become a choice, too, along with reverence, and perhaps even a senseof the sacred.Yet modern Darwinists act as if humans are still in the primal state of Nature.Not that primal was ever simple. Survival is complex—an intricate tapestry—evenamong lower creatures. Penguins have been swimmers instead of fliers for over 36million years. Diving for fish was a spectacular success in evolutionary terms,although the original penguin was feathered in brown or gray (this wasdiscovered by examining fossilized pigment cells). Why did that change to theblack-and-white penguin suit we smile at today? Darwinism has only one answer:competitive advantage. The original penguin was five feet tall and weighed twiceas much as the present-day emperor penguin. Why did penguins grow smaller? That,too, must have contributed to survival. Darwinism is forced to explain anychange the same way, because it cannot get past its one-eyed focus on thestruggle for food and breeding.But species don’t just compete for survival; they also cooperate in arelationship known as mutualism. Bizarre tubeworms that live near hydrothermalvents at the bottom of the sea survive with no guts, thanks to bacteria thatprovide a digestive function in return for the hydrogen sulfide or methane thatthe tubeworm provides for them. The clownfish I mentioned earlier has developedan adaptive mucus to protect it from the poison in a sea anemone’s tentacles.Using those tentacles as a safe haven from predators, the territorial clownfishreturns the favor by protecting the sea anemone from sea-anemone-eating fish. Tosay that competition alone drives evolution is clearly wrong on the face of it.The same goes for the so-called selfish gene. Genetic theory had to come up withan answer for why evolution sometimes favors death over life. Survival is notalways a creature’s sole drive. Honeybees are equipped with a stinger to protectthe hive, but when they use the stinger, it pulls out, fatally injuring the bee.You cannot explain this kind of self-sacrifice as contributing to survival; thebee is dead. So evolutionists had to back up a step. It’s the honeybee gene thatis fighting for survival, not the individual insect. Specifically, the genes inthe queen bee must survive, which means that lower-ranking bees can sacrificetheir own lives so long as the hive as a whole benefits. The same argumentapplies to female spiders that bite off the heads of the male during mating, orby extension to the millions of fish eggs that drift through the sea providingfood for other fish without ever having a chance to hatch. If a hundredhatchlings survive while a million perish, the gene pool continues.As a credible explanation, the selfish gene borders on the absurd. It doesn’tget us to the real locus of evolutionary change, the intelligent cell. DNAcannot control how a gene responds to the environment, for example, because DNAis deaf, dumb, and blind. It sits passively inside the nucleus of a cell; itreplicates as RNA to produce the enzymes and proteins for cell growth. Nowherein this chain of chemical events is there a way for the gene to look out uponthe world and decide to be selfish or unselfish. The only valid way to explainself-sacrifice is by inserting the one element that materialists abhor:consciousness.A honeybee can serve the hive when there is an overriding purpose—to keep thewhole alive despite the death of some parts. The human body clearly preservesthe whole over the parts. White blood cells, for example, die after they consumeinvading bacteria. Every cell in the body has a programmed life span, from a fewweeks in the case of skin and stomach cells, to the lifetime of the body itselfin the case of some brain cells. The mindful principle that the whole is moreimportant than its parts extends to our entire planet. The purpose of ecology isto maintain itself, not any one plant or animal. Yet within this scheme hundredsof thousands of species can thrive at the same time, even those that are mortalenemies.A mindless mechanism will always be insufficient to explain how life evolves andthrives. There are too many opposites, like competition and cooperation,selfishness and altruism, that coexist. Conscious choices are being madethroughout Nature. It’s not just the critics of Darwinism who found flaws in thetheory. Today as many as eleven reinterpretations and revisions are competingfor primacy among evolutionists themselves (in classic Darwinian fashion). Eachrevision tries to fill in a gap or correct a mistake. Progressive Darwinists,for example, try to explain how infinite variety develops from limited geneticmaterial. Human beings have only twenty-three thousand genes, of which 65percent are so basic that we share them with a banana. These progressiveDarwinists look more closely at the developmental stages of growth—hence theirnickname of “evo devos”—and they have discovered that stretches of seeminglyrandom sequences in our DNA are helping to turn genes off and on, acting as“molecular fingers” controlling a bank of switches so that embryos in the wombcan develop along entirely unique lines.Another camp, the collectivists, recognized that evolution required cooperationas much as competition. They focused on how the enormous leap from one-celledorganisms to eukaryotes, or multicelled organisms, was the result of acooperative venture with plants, who had developed photosynthesis. StrictDarwinists had reason to resist, because cooperation defies the notion of theselfish gene, and only after a twenty-year struggle did cooperation becomeaccepted as the basis of life.Other camps snip off other pieces of the puzzle to solve. The complexitytheorists study how a system can become so intricate that it spontaneously givesrise to ever greater complexity. Without that ability, a single fertilized ovumcouldn’t develop into fifty trillion cells—our best estimate of the cell countin an average adult human. The so-called directionalists tackle the way thatcomplexity and cooperation never stop—two kinds of one-celled organismscooperating two billion years ago has snowballed into a planet where everyliving creature affects every other. Seven other specialized camps are busyinjecting bioengineering, design, God, and metaphysics into the scheme to see ifany fit. All the parts of this patchwork are aimed at pinpointing exactly howthe mechanism of evolution works.What if you look at the whole picture at once? Because billions of living partsare involved, the whole is nearly impossible to glimpse, but one can see thatall of life is evolving, here and now. It’s time to adopt a holistic approach toevolution, and no better case exists than our own species. Early hominids likeLucy, roaming the African grasslands 4 million years ago, evolved into humanslike Homo erectus about 1.8 million years ago. Homo erectus looked incrediblylike us. It was well over five feet tall (whereas Lucy was under four feet). Ithad lost the fangs of primates such as chimpanzees; its hips had widened; itwalked upright all the time instead of sometimes crawling or climbing in trees;it had lost almost all its body hair; and sweat glands had replaced pantingthrough the tongue as a way to cool down. (A body that can cool down is able torun long distances after prey, which early man had to do since he couldn’toutfight large animals; present-day bushmen of the Kalahari Desert continue tochase antelope for hours at a time until the animal drops from fatigue and iseasily dispatched.) Larger brains developed outside the womb, after a child wasborn (this was necessary because a fully formed human brain cannot pass throughthe birth canal). It is hard to believe that each of these adaptations drippedinto the hominid gene pool as a random event. The arrival of Homo erectus lookspurposeful and holistic.But where does purpose originate from? Intelligence seems to guide structure.Some anthropologists speculate that Homo erectus took a great leap in more thanphysical traits. As a primitive toolmaker he learned to judge which flints madegood blades and which didn’t. That implies the capacity of reason. To ward offpredators at night Homo erectus might have tamed fire twice as early as the750,000 years ago that is currently accepted. Studies of brain shape indicatethat the first humans may have had much the same language centers that we do: sodid they speak? As one speculation bounces off another, it seems likely thatmultiple traits appeared at nearly the same time, rather than single traits atrandom. Each change provided a catalyst for others. Standing upright allowed forlong-distance running, which allowed for more food, which allowed for a largerbrain (the most calorie-hungry organ of the body), which allowed for the higherreasoning necessary to discover fire and take care of helpless babies whiletheir brains matured.Beyond Darwinism lies a better way to view life on our planet: intelligentfeedback loops. Life creates a new trait, gets good at it, and watches itself asit gets good. Such a feedback loop isn’t mindless; it has purpose, desire, andintention. For example, every person has a sense of balance. It is innate, agiven we don’t need to think about. You can improve upon it, as people do whenthey learn to ski, skateboard, or walk a tightrope. When you look carefully atwhat is going on when a beginner is learning to ski, to all appearances there’sa lot of falling down and flailing. But this chaotic behavior isn’t what itseems. Every mistake is contributing to a feedback loop inside the brain that islearning, step by step, to master a new skill. Behavior that appears to berandom actually is serving a purpose, even though you cannot observe the purposeby just watching the random events.If you keep trying to ski, you will train your sense of balance even further. Ina word, you are causing it to evolve. The whole body joins in the enterprise.Your long muscles adjust as you lean one way or another. Your ankles adapt tothe stiff ski boot; your breathing changes as you focus intently. Your eyes feedinformation to your brain about how the slope looks as it races by. None of thisactivity is isolated; it is all funneled by your single-minded intention. Andalthough skiing is a new development, you have possessed the potential to learnit from birth.What applies to your use of intelligent feedback on a ski slope can be extendedeverywhere in Nature. Darwinism is stuck if it insists that every trait cameabout as a result of getting better at finding food and a mate. Creatures gainan identity, which discovers itself through intelligent feedback loops. Horseslearn to be better horses, snakes to be better snakes. Each is a special, uniqueset of qualities that mesh beautifully. The mistake we make is to humanize suchintelligence. Evolution doesn’t need to employ a complex brain. Feedback loopsare universal. One-celled animals use them, too, since even the most primitivecreature orchestrates eating, breathing, cell division, and motion.Spirituality restores purpose and direction to their rightful places at theheart of evolution. As humans we know where we want to go (at least we hope wedo), and our intentions have led to a world where atom bombs coexist with peaceconferences, cars with pedestrians, lumber companies with conservationists. Wehave entangled ourselves in a web of desires, some tending to make life betterand others tending toward self-destruction. If we want to evolve beyond ourworst impulses, the only way is through a higher purpose that benefits everyone.Religion tried to supply that higher purpose through God, but as we see in holywars, sectarian violence, and terrorism, God can serve destruction, too. This iswhy spirituality, the taproot of religion, is our last best hope. It holds outthe possibility for the evolution of consciousness.Darwinism (as opposed to Darwin himself) stands as a huge obstacle for savingus, which is deeply ironic but undeniable. Evolutionary theory is used tosupport the following false ideas:Life is completely physical.Evolution proceeds by accidental mutations.Mind and higher purpose are illusions.Survival is the ultimate goal of all living things.Competition is the driving force in Nature.Darwin himself isn’t to blame for these notions; his goal was purely to show howone species gives rise to another. He didn’t invent the phrase “survival of thefittest,” much less the gloomy Victorian view of “Nature red in tooth and claw.”But seeds were planted through Darwin’s aversion to God and his focus onmechanism. His followers and descendants grew those seeds into a theory whererandomness and mindlessness prevail. As long as this network of ideas colorsyour worldview, there is no reason to believe that consciousness can evolve.Remove those false assumptions, however, and it becomes clear that consciousnesshas been evolving since the very beginning, and it will never stop."},{"pageContent":"[../images/00010.jpeg]LEONARDDeepak pleads passionately about the need for humanity to evolve beyond itsworst impulses, and argues that it can do so through a higher purpose thatbenefits everyone. He is right that religion has often failed to provide that,providing instead motivation for conflict and destruction. And I believe he isalso right in saying that we can rise above the basest of thesurvival-of-the-fittest mechanisms because the social and altruistic behaviorsthat distinguish us from other animals are also a product of evolution, thuspart of our very nature, as I will discuss below. It is those behaviors that canenable us to find salvation from the many dangers we now face. Deepak’sspiritual approach can serve that end, too, especially if it encourages us toexpress our innate altruism, or nurtures culturally based altruism. But we mustbe careful not to allow ideas about what we must do to improve human life toinfluence what we believe is human life.Deepak tells us that spirituality owes a deep thanks to Charles Darwin, but thepicture he paints of Darwin’s ideas today is a portrait of a theory racked byconfusion and chaos. “As a credible explanation, the selfish gene borders on theabsurd,” he writes, and “it’s not just the critics of Darwinism who found flawsin the theory. Today as many as eleven reinterpretations and revisions arecompeting for primacy among evolutionists themselves (in classic Darwinianfashion). Each revision tries to fill in a gap or correct a mistake.”Did Darwin go wrong? Are scientists really climbing over one another to plugholes in the bow of a sinking ship, or to claw their way onto a lifeboat?The answer is absolutely not. With the exception of a handful of creationistsmotivated by their religious beliefs, no scientist doubts the basic idea ofDarwinian evolution, or that natural selection is the mechanism behind it.That’s why working scientists don’t call themselves “evolutionists” or“Darwinists.” These terms are common among creationists (from whom Deepakrightly wishes to distance himself), because to use them gives the mistakenimpression that among biologists there are some who believe in evolution andothers who don’t. Calling a biologist an “evolutionist” or “Darwinist” is likecalling a physicist a “round Earther” or a “Columbus-ist.” The original idea ofa “round Earth,” dating back to the ancient Greeks, held that the Earth isperfectly spherical. The flat-Earth theory resurfaced from time to time untilColumbus made his famous voyage, which provided dramatic evidence for theround-Earth theory. Still, over the years there were those who made“revisions”—people like Isaac Newton—who realized that the Earth is not really asphere. They “reinterpreted” the round-Earth theory, predicting and measuringthe Earth’s slightly squashed shape, and studying its details, causes, andimplications. Does the need for revision and reinterpretation mean we shouldrevert to the flat-Earth theory? Of course not. But filling in the “mistake” or“gap” in the theory did not discredit the idea that the Earth is round, andphysicists today would roll their eyes at anyone worried about falling off.Similarly, there are debates about the relative contributions to naturalselection made by genes, individuals, or groups of individuals, and it’s truethat understanding the detailed patterns of evolution in different species iscomplicated, but the basic idea of natural selection, and the fundamental roleof randomness in the process, is not in question.What should we make, then, of all the biologists studying different aspects ofevolution? Deepak calls them camps, and remarks that scientific ideas aboutevolution are themselves competing in “classic Darwinian fashion.” The commentsounds damning, as though there is a war going on, which may ultimately removeDarwin from his place of honor in the scientific pantheon. But this is just thenormal scientific discussion that surrounds every theory. In fact, itilluminates an important difference between science and metaphysics. Inmetaphysics one has the luxury of embracing any attractive idea. In science newideas can be incorporated into theories—as happened in the round-Earthexample—but the only new ideas that survive are those that experimental evidenceshows to be valid. It is one thing to say that “the selfish gene doesn’t hold upas a credible explanation,” but it is quite another to prove it.What does it take to “prove” something in science? One of course wants to test atheory’s obvious predictions, and to collect evidence that it explains what itclaims to explain. But that is only the beginning. In fact, more important thangathering evidence that a theory is right—and more exciting to a scientist—istrying to find situations in which a theory’s predictions might be wrong.Scientists are like devil’s advocates—or your annoying little brother; theyquestion everything, eager to concoct an exceptional situation that proves youare misguided. That’s not a flaw in the fundamental character of science; to thecontrary, it is how science makes progress. So when scientists say they’ve foundevidence in support of a theory, they often mean they have been looking for anew way to challenge the theory, and the theory passed the challenge. Thishappens even in well-established theories like evolution, but it should not beinterpreted as a sign that the theory is in trouble.Take Newton’s law of gravity, for example, which accurately describes, under theconditions of everyday life, the force of gravitational attraction betweenobjects. Experimental physicists are still testing that law, though in the threehundred-plus years since Newton proposed it, no one has ever found a deviation,except in extraordinary circumstances, such as those described in chapter 2[part0011_split_000.html]. So why are scientists still looking to poke holes?Because in the centuries since Newton, scientists have been able to verify onlythat Newton’s law of gravity correctly describes the attraction of objects atdistances ranging from a few thousandths of a centimeter to a light-year, butnew experimental methods now allow scientists to test it at even shorterdistances, and it would be a discovery with exciting implications if the lawwere found not to hold at all distances. That is valid science, but it is not anindication that physicists are abandoning the theory.What if a theory does fail an experimental test? That means the theory must bealtered, but it doesn’t necessarily mean its basic principles are wrong. Theround-Earth theory is a simple example—the Earth is not perfectly “round,” butthough the details of the theory changed as we learned more about the Earth’sshape, the main idea that the Earth is not flat survived. Genetics, as we haveseen, has also evolved from the simple early models that arose when thestructure of DNA was first revealed to the very complex reality scientists haveuncovered in the decades since. Though a theory can often be succinctlysummarized, the headline telegraphing its meaning usually belies considerablecomplexity, both in the concept and in its application to situations in the realworld. Much of the work of scientists concerns understanding the details of thatcomplexity, and adjusting or elaborating on the theory as we keep learning more,as was done in the theories I’ve just mentioned.In criticizing Darwin, Deepak focused on a facet of the theory of evolution thatis relevant to his humanitarian goal, and something he believes Darwin’s theorycannot explain: cooperation among individuals, which seems to contradict theidea of selection through competition. I agree that this is an importantchallenge for evolution, one of those critical blanks that must be filled in.Darwin himself wrote that it is “by far the most serious special difficulty,which my theory has encountered.” Darwin believed the answer was that thecommunity benefits, that natural selection in this case is operating on thelevel of the group, rather than the individual. As we’ll see, there is a lotmore to it than that, but there is an answer, and the work of filling in thatblank was nothing above and beyond the analogous filling in that occurs in alltheories, from the round-Earth theory to the theories of electromagnetism andthe quantum that are responsible for most of modern technology.Deepak wrote that Darwinian evolution must be wrong because, if it were correct,“competition and cooperation, selfishness and altruism” cannot coexist. It istrue that the headlines of evolution theory—natural selection throughcompetition, and survival of the fittest—seem to disallow cooperation; but asoften happens in science, it turns out that if you read the whole story, you geta far more nuanced picture, and in this case a surprisingly wonderful one—of thekind that even Deepak would welcome.Einstein is said to have remarked that everything should be made as simple aspossible, but not simpler, and in addressing this issue, I will try to keep mytoes on that fine line. Can competition and cooperation, selfishness andaltruism, coexist? Richard Dawkins, who thirty-five years ago coined the term“selfish gene” in his book of that name, now says he has second thoughts aboutthe term because it can be misleading. There is indeed a problem in that thebook’s title is now widely quoted even though most people have not, in Dawkins’swords, read the rather “large footnote of the book itself.” A good alternativetitle, he now offers, would have been “The Cooperative Gene.” This seems odd,that a gene can be described as both cooperative and selfish. Let’s see why hesays that.Consider Deepak’s example of kamikaze bees. They belong to an order of insectscalled Hymenoptera, which also includes ants and wasps, the social organisms Idescribed earlier. Such insects are famous for their apparent altruism andcooperative behavior. In these insects, the society as a whole is like anorganism. The majority of individuals are sterile workers. Some ants tend to thenest, others to battle, others to food. Among bees, intruders are recognized andattacked, with individuals playing the role of the cells in our immune system;and together the metabolism of individual bees regulates the temperature in thehive nearly as well as the individual human body regulates its owntemperature—even though bees are not “warm-blooded.” In each hymenopteran colonythere are also a minority of individuals (typically one of each sex) thatreproduce—the female queens and male drones—and it is through those insects thatthe gene line flows. In the advanced societies, the queens and drones do nothingbut reproduce, while all food, defense, and nanny tasks are taken care of by theworkers. Each female hymenopteran has the genes to become any type of worker,even the queen. But as we saw in my last chapter, the type of genes that areturned on can depend on the environment, and in this case theenvironment—especially the food provided—determines whether a female developsinto a particular type of worker, or a queen.Given this social structure, the kamikaze behavior of worker bees who die afterstinging makes perfect evolutionary sense, because it does not diminish thesurvival of their genes—worker bees never bear offspring—while it does enhancesurvival of the hive, and hence of the bees that do reproduce. As Dawkinswrites, “The death of a single sterile worker bee is no more serious to itsgenes than is the shedding of a leaf in autumn to the genes of a tree.”But there is still an important question: why did the workers’ reproductiveability wither, like an unused appendage? Can it really be that it is somehowmore efficient for worker bees to pass their genes along by aiding thereproduction of the queen—their mother—than by having offspring of their own?The answer is astonishing. In most animals (except in the case of identicaltwins), a female is more closely related—that is, genetically more similar—toits offspring than to its sisters. But when scientists examined the reproductiveprocess of hymenopterans, they found something quite odd. As a result ofparticular quirks in the bees’ reproduction, a female is genetically closer toits full sisters than to its children of either sex. A gene encouragingsacrifice for the good of the hive, which would aid in the creation of sisterbees, is therefore favored by evolution over a gene for making offspringdirectly, and so the fertility of the worker bees became genetically irrelevantand disappeared. Kamikaze bees look altruistic, but their behavior is in theirgenes’ best interest!There are many other details to the story, as usual. For one, though femalehymenopterans are closely related to their sisters, they are not as closelyrelated to the males, and so if the system I described works, one should expectthere to be many more female offspring than males. It is even possible topredict the optimal sex ratio, and this turns out to be very close to what isobserved. Another detail is that there are some species of social insects inwhich a queen mates with multiple males, resulting in sisters that are not fullsisters—that is, not as closely related—yet these societies exhibit the samealtruistic behavior. That mystery was finally explained by a striking study in2008 in which sophisticated DNA analysis showed that when, millions of yearsago, the current social structure of social insects evolved, the queens in alllineages were monogamous, and sister bees were all very closely related.Cooperation among social insects, a challenge evolution had to answer, hasturned out not to represent evidence of a flaw in the theory, but rather toprovide convincing support that it is correct.Associations of mutual benefit also occur in animals other than social insects.But there are limits to altruism. Consider the case of an animal that would giveaway food if it had plenty, and another animal that was near starvation. Thechances of the altruistic animal avoiding starvation would diminish just alittle, while the chances of the other surviving might increase a great deal.But unless the organism on the receiving end shared the donor’s genes, the donorwould slightly decrease the odds of its living to pass its genes on to the nextgeneration, while its genes would receive no survival benefit in return. Such ananimal would have chronically a little less to eat than a selfish cohort thattook but never gave. As a result, according to natural selection, animals withgenes bestowing this kind of blanket altruism should be expected to die off—butif an altruist is choosy regarding the animals it shares with, things change,and we see that kind of altruism in many species.One way to be choosy is to have the sophisticated ability to recognize andremember who returns the favor, and to stop sharing with individuals who don’t.Animals of this sort help others in times of need, but in exchange receive helpwhen they are in need. That is called reciprocal altruism. We all have sometendency to practice it, and behavioral economists have studied that tendency ingreat detail, setting up games in which volunteers cooperate and compete formonetary awards.A more selfless style of biological choosiness is to share only with relatives—atype of altruism called kin selection. When an organism shares with relatives,especially close relatives, there is a good probability that the recipients ofthe kindness share its genes. As a result, though an organism might reduce itsown chances of survival slightly by sharing, when it boosts the chances of therelative, it increases the odds of its own genes’ survival. The net result ofsuch acts can be that the altruism gene is likely to be passed along, so thiskind of altruism tends to survive. Kin selection has testable consequences. Forexample, it predicts that altruism in the animal world is more likely towardrelatives than toward unrelated animals, and that the closer the relationship,the higher the degree of altruism, predictions that have been confirmed inempirical work on species ranging from birds to Japanese macaque monkeys.Darwin wasn’t wrong, but as Deepak says, Darwin takes us only so far. Mostpeople, when stepping into a street today—even a deserted one—will look bothways, often without even thinking about it. We have genes for abilities todetect danger, but there is nothing in our genes that makes us look beforecrossing the street. We needn’t develop a genetic mechanism for that, becauseeach generation can easily solve that kind of problem anew, and the knowledgecan be passed down through culture.The evolution of culture is perhaps more important than genetic evolution tohumanity today. Humans have lived in countless civilizations, but the fewhundred generations since the ancient Greeks have not been enough for naturalgenetic evolution to have had much of an impact on us. It’s not that we haven’tchanged—we have; but what most distinguishes us from the civilizations of thepast few thousand years is not the effect of shifting genes, but the effect ofshifting culture. Stephen Jay Gould noted that in other mammalian species, the“murder” rate is far higher than in human cities. In this and other ways ourcultures can allow us to rise above our genetic makeup. That’s a key to oursurvival because, due to rapid technological progress, the environment in whichwe function has changed drastically over the past centuries. Today’s technologybrings us great good, but today both groups and individuals have the power to dogreat harm, either through bad intention (terrorism) or simply throughinattention to technology’s harmful effects (pollution and global warming). Ourbest hope for a better future, then, is through the development of values thatencourage caring for one another, cherishing knowledge and learning, preservingnatural resources, and minimizing harm to our environment. It is only this kindof evolution, which is cultural rather than biological in nature, that can saveus.dy>"},{"pageContent":"PART FOUR[../images/00009.jpeg]MIND AND BRAINdy>"},{"pageContent":"12"},{"pageContent":"[../images/00009.jpeg]WHAT IS THE CONNECTION BETWEEN MIND AND BRAIN?"},{"pageContent":"[../images/00010.jpeg]LEONARDWhen it comes to sensations, emotions, and the ultimate question ofconsciousness, science still can’t explain the connection between neuralpatterns and the mind. We can characterize many emotions according to thephysiological reactions that accompany them—a blush or change in the electricalconductance of your skin, for example; and we’ve also made progress inunderstanding what is going on in your brain, both anatomically and chemically,as you experience those emotions. So we understand a lot about how the brainfunctions. What we understand very little about is the subjective experience ofthose emotions, the “felt quality” of experience, as philosopher David Chalmerscalls it.What does it mean to “feel bad,” or to experience a burn, or the color blue, orsexual desire?In 1915 a scientist named Alfred Sturtevant carefully observed what we think ofas stereotypical barroom behavior—a couple of males fighting over a female,charging each other, ending up in a chaotic tussle. What made his studynoteworthy was that the vertices of this love triangle were fruit flies. Evensimpler creatures like nematodes, many species of which are microscopic, alsoexhibit special behaviors related to mating. Nematodes procreate like crazy—graba handful of soil humus, and the chances are you’ll have thousands of theseprolific roundworms within your grasp. So forget trying to grasp thecomplexities of the human mind—what does sex “feel like” to a creature of thephylum Nematoda? It might seem silly to ask about feelings in a species sosimple it can survive being frozen in liquid nitrogen. But for one nematodespecies, C. elegans, we have the complete blueprint of its construction—a map ofall of its 959 cells, including the wiring of its 302-node neural network (youcan find it online)—and there was the hope that the blueprint would help us tounderstand how sensations arise from its networks of neurons. Alas, even in acreature this simple, it did not.What is the nature of inner experience, and how can it be the result of neuralprocesses? How do neural processes create the mind? Chalmers termed that “thehard problem.” It’s so hard that philosophers and poets, theologians,scientists, and physicists have been wrestling with the question of theconnection between the material and the immaterial worlds for millennia.Plato, for example, viewed people as having an immortal soul inside a mortalbody. Christianity embraced that idea, as did many other faiths, and some earlyscientists also embraced it. The great seventeenth-century physicist,mathematician, and philosopher René Descartes, like many before him,differentiated between physical substance and mental substance. In his view, thebrain was a physical structure, a machine, but the mind—our thoughts andconsciousness—was something altogether different, which did not operateaccording to the laws of physics. Today we call that idea “mind-body dualism.”For Descartes, as for Deepak, it was philosophical considerations that seemed todrive him. In part Descartes was trying to refute “irreligious” people who puttheir faith solely in mathematics, and would not accept the immortality of thesoul unless it could be mathematically and scientifically demonstrated. ButDescartes was also grappling with the problem of how to account for physicalphenomena in a way that was consistent with his underlying worldview. In this hediffered from the Aristotelian tradition, which was the reigning philosophicalbelief at the time. The Aristotelian worldview holds, as Deepak does, that thereis purpose in the universe. In Aristotle’s version of purpose, all objects innature, both animate and inanimate, behave as they do for the sake of some endor goal, sometimes called a “final cause.” For example, a stone tossed into theair would be said to fall back to the Earth because it is striving to reach theEarth’s center. Unlike most scientists and scholars of his era, Descartesopposed this idea, and its apparent implication that stones can have knowledgeof a goal, and of how to attain it. Instead, Descartes took a mechanisticapproach, maintaining that nonhuman objects follow physical laws. His theory ofmind-body dualism was in part an attempt to dissuade people from assigningmental properties to inanimate objects and nonhuman animals, and thereby todistinguish the human world, which he did see as being guided, ultimately, bymind and purpose, from the inanimate and nonhuman.Descartes was aware of certain difficulties that plague mind-body dualism fromthe scientific viewpoint. For example, through what physical mechanism does themind control the brain? An accomplished anatomist, Descartes eventually came tothe conclusion that the interface between mind and brain was a physicalstructure called the pineal gland, tucked deep between the two hemispheres ofthe brain. As it is one of the only structures of the brain that does not existin two mirror-image parts, one in the left hemisphere and one in the right,Descartes thought it was where mind and brain communicated, and he called it“the principal seat of the soul.”Descartes’s anatomically grounded theory is not accepted today, even by thosewho believe in mind-body dualism. The “hard problem”—the question of where innerexperience comes from—remains unsolved. But scientists feel no shame in not yethaving arrived at the answers. They may come in the next century, or in the nextmillennium. Or if they are too complex for human understanding, they may nevercome. In any case, even on the basis of our limited knowledge today, it isdifficult to maintain the distinction between an immaterial mind and a materialbrain. For one, if a realm that obeys physical laws were to interact with arealm that doesn’t, wouldn’t the interaction cause noticeable exceptions to thelaws of nature in the physical realm? Today we can routinely measure physicalphenomena, including those inside living human brains, to enormous degrees ofaccuracy, but we have seen no evidence of such exceptions. If they do exist, whydon’t we see them? On the other hand, evidence that thoughts and even subjectivefeelings are manifestations of the physical state of connected neurons abounds.For example, in the course of treating epilepsy patients, neurosurgeonssometimes implant tiny electrodes in their brains and stimulate the tissue withbrief pulses of electrical current. What they observe goes far beyond themechanical responses high school biology students used to observe when theyapplied electricity to make a frog’s leg twitch. Depending on where they placethe electrode, the surgeons can cause patients to hear identifiable sounds, likea doorbell or the chirping of birds (when there are no such sounds in thevicinity); to suddenly recall an event from childhood; or to feel urges, such asthe desire to move an arm or a leg. These feelings and experiences, which Ithink we would all agree occur in the “mind,” can be traced directly to thephysical stimulation of the brain, persuasive evidence that the brain controlsthe experiences of mind, and not vice versa.Even more dramatic evidence comes from patients with epilepsy so severe that tobring relief surgeons sever a nerve bundle called the corpus callosum. Suchpatients are called “split-brain” patients because severing the corpus callosumdivides the brain into its two nearly mirror-image hemispheres, with nothing toconnect them. Without the corpus callosum bridge between them, the left andright hemispheres can for the most part no longer communicate, coordinate, orintegrate information. What does dividing the brain in two do to a patient’smind? If the mind exists in an immaterial realm, the surgery should not affectit. But if the mind arises solely from the physical brain, splitting the brainshould also split the mind.Neuroscientist Christof Koch wrote about one such case, a split-brain patientwho was asked how many seizures she had recently experienced. Her right handwent up, showing two fingers. Then her left hand, controlled by her brain’sopposite hemisphere, reached over and forced the fingers on her right hand down.After a pause, her right hand went back up and indicated three, but her lefthand went up and indicated only one. The patient seemed to be of two minds, andthey were having a spat. Eventually the patient complained verbally that hermaverick left hand often “did things on its own.” Language, it turns out, is oneof the few functions that resides on just one side of the brain, usually theleft side, which controls the right hand. But though her right hemisphere couldnot speak, it could hear the remark. Apparently it didn’t like what it heard,because at that point a fight broke out between the two hands. If the mind werenot reducible to the brain, there is no reason that splitting the brain into twoshould also split a single conscious mind into, as Koch wrote, “two consciousminds in one skull.”Deepak writes, “It doesn’t matter if you track a brain cell back to the atomsthat make it up, then farther back to subatomic particles.… No one can point toa specific physical process and say, ‘Aha, that’s where thinking comes from.’ ”Though it’s true that we still have a lot to learn about the connection betweenour neurons and our thoughts, not knowing “where thinking comes from” does notprove that the source of thought lies in an immaterial realm. Scientists don’tdeny what seems special about human experience, but they try to avoidexplanations of it that are contrary to the evidence. There are currently anestimated fifty thousand scientists worldwide studying the brain, and none ofthem, nor any of their predecessors, has ever found credible, replicablescientific evidence that people’s mental experiences are the result of anythingother than physical processes that obey the same laws as every other assemblageof molecules.That the origin of mind lies in the physical substance of the brain has beenrepeatedly demonstrated in biology, but it is also demanded by physics. It is ofcourse obvious that if some immaterial entity from another realm knocks a lampoff a table, the laws of physics have been violated. You don’t need to studyNewtonian mechanics to know that natural law doesn’t allow things to jump aroundwithout a physical cause. But the immaterial mind, as envisioned by Deepak,doesn’t go tossing lamps off tables. Deepak sees it as being a more subtle moverand shaker. And yet one of its chief activities is actually not subtle at all:the immaterial mind, according to Deepak, processes knowledge. In his view, itis this nonphysical mind that is the essence of who we are; it knows what weknow, feels what we feel, and makes our judgments and decisions. But accordingto the laws of physics, the existence of knowledge, thoughts, feelings, or anyother kind of information in an immaterial mind—that is, in a realm that has nophysical substance—is an impossibility.The kind of trouble one can run into if one allows for the existence ofimmaterial information is illustrated by a famous thought experiment conceivedby physicist James Clerk Maxwell in 1867. Imagine, as we did in chapter 8[part0018_split_000.html], a box of gas with a partition down the middle. Thistime instead of a hole in the partition, imagine a tiny door in it—a door sosmall it can be opened and closed without expending an appreciable amount ofenergy. When the door is shut, the molecules on either side are in a constantstate of motion, bouncing off the partition as well as off the walls of the box,but always remaining on the side of the box on which they started. Next, picturea creature, also of insignificant size and mass, standing at the door, observingthe molecules and letting them pass one way or the other at his whim. As Maxwellimagined it, this creature has free will and intelligence, but negligiblesubstance. In other words, it resides in an immaterial realm, just as Deepakbelieves our consciousness does. William Thomson, a contemporary of Maxwell’s,nicknamed it “Maxwell’s Demon.”Suppose this Demon decides to let only fast-moving, high-energy moleculestransit from left to right, and only slow-moving, low-energy molecules move fromright to left. Since the temperature of the gas is a measure of the speed of itsmolecules, over time the gas on the right side of the box will become hot, andthe gas on the left side, cool. In chapter 8 [part0018_split_000.html], Iexplained why gas molecules in a box will never spontaneously gather on oneside, but one can equally well say that they will never sort themselves into hotand cold. If such a scenario were really possible, it would be revolutionary.For example, you could use the temperature differential to drive an engine,which means you’d be able to power a vehicle without consuming any fuel. Butthat would violate the second law of thermodynamics, which dictates that theentropy—or disorder—of a closed system never decreases. The entropy of the gasesin Maxwell’s box, however, is decreasing, as the Demon arranges them in such awell-ordered fashion.This violation of the second law, which leaves the physicist wondering where themissing entropy could have gone, occurs because the Demon has been posited ashaving an immaterial mind. If, on the other hand, the Demon’s mind has amaterial basis, then the “closed system” I described would include not just thebox of gas, but also the Demon’s mind. Let’s look at how that would change theentropy equation. In order for the Demon to do its work, it has to note andremember information about the velocity of the molecules. As that informationaccumulates in the Demon’s mind (or in a notebook, or in a computer’s memory ifthe Demon is a robot), the mind’s entropy increases. To understand why, comparean empty room to a room containing furniture. However you arrange the tables,chairs, and other odds and ends, the room will not be as orderly as when thereis simply nothing in it. The tables and chairs are like the bits of informationcluttering the Demon’s mind: as you add information, you increase entropy. Theend result: the decrease in the entropy of the gas molecules in the box isoffset by the increase in entropy caused by the information buildup in theDemon’s physical mind. With that, we understand where the missing entropy went,and we find that the second law has not been violated. (To those clever readerswondering why one can’t simply periodically erase the Demon’s memory, it turnsout that all that does is transfer the entropy elsewhere through the erasingprocess!)Physics defines not just knowledge of the kind the Demon possesses asinformation, but all our ideas, memories, thoughts, and feelings, which means,according to the laws of physics, that they must reside somewhere in thephysical universe—whether embodied in the neural patterns in our brains, encodedin a computer circuit, or printed as letters on a page. Even our experiences ofbeauty, hope, love, and pain arise in a brain that obeys the ordinary laws ofphysics. Unfortunately, accepting that a mind that harbors information cannotexist in some immaterial realm does not mean that we understand the workings ofconsciousness. The challenges we face in trying to understand how a neuralsystem that obeys the ordinary laws of physics can give rise to subjectiveexperience make this one of the great scientific projects of our time. AlthoughDeepak would probably call the attempt to locate the mind in the material worlda reductionist’s pointless dream, many scientists are at work on just thatproject, complex and impossible as it may seem. And they are making realprogress.Koch wrote that when he started doing research on the question of consciousnessin the late 1980s, it was practically considered a sign of cognitivedecline—ill-advised as a career path for a young professor, and likely to makegraduate students roll their eyes. But he and a few others did work on it, andtoday those attitudes have changed. There is a whole new science ofconsciousness. It is legitimate science, and it has helped us understand whichstructures in the brain produce emotions, sensations, and thoughts, and how theyare chemically regulated and electrically connected. We still aren’t close todiscovering the basis of “mind,” or consciousness, as an emergent phenomenonbased on interactions among neurons. But every day more evidence emerges tosupport the idea that mental experiences like beauty, love, hope, and pain areproduced by the physical brain. Researchers in Koch’s lab, for instance, havedeveloped a way for subjects to activate individual nerve cells deep insidetheir own brains—concept cells like those I mentioned in chapter 1[part0009_split_000.html]—enabling them to control the content of an image on anexternal computer screen by simply thinking about the image they want to see.Experiments like this one, and work that is being done in many other settingsaround the globe, encourage us to think we are on the right path, though we arefar nearer to the beginning of the road than to the end of it."},{"pageContent":"[../images/00010.jpeg]DEEPAKSome years ago black colleges in America wanted to raise much-needed funds, andthey came up with a brilliant ad campaign. Its slogan was “A mind is a terriblething to waste.” It would be even more terrible to throw the mind away entirely.Leonard does that when he claims that love is understandable as essentially abrain process. This would be a bizarre statement in any case, although it seemssomewhat more reasonable when the exact phrasing is pieced back together:“Beauty, hope, love, and pain arise in a brain that obeys the ordinary laws ofphysics.” Love and beauty are core experiences in spiritual life. We need to getto the bottom of where they come from. There is an answer, but to accept it, youhave to see the difference between love and the products of a chemistry set.Leonard calls for backup from fifty thousand brain researchers, and he presentstheir position fairly. In the field of neuroscience the mind is considered to bea by-product of the brain, the way sweat is a by-product of burning calories orflushed cheeks a by-product of sexual excitement. But thoughts are not readilybroken down into data. Love and beauty aren’t reducible to data, either. As theeminent British physicist Russell Stannard writes, “There is no way we can seeconcepts like hope, fear, and pain being quantified.” In order to followChrist’s injunction to seek the kingdom of heaven within, or the Greek ideal toknow thyself, the road lies only through the mind. And so spirituality puts mindfirst, where it belongs.So how did the brain manage to dethrone the mind? Twenty or thirty years ago thehuman brain was still poorly understood. One neurologist quipped that we knew solittle about memory that the skull might as well be filled with sawdust. But theadvent of new technologies shot brain research forward, and today a scan with anfMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) machine not only reveals thebrain’s memory centers; it can show them lighting up in real time, or going darkif a patient is suffering from Alzheimer’s disease. Hope, pain, and fear may notbe quantifiable, but at least we can film images of them as brain activity.The logic that places brain before mind is amazingly weak, however. Let me givean analogy: I’m sure you would agree that you can’t play “Twinkle, Twinkle,Little Star” on a piano without a piano. That’s obvious, just as obvious as thefact that you can’t have a thought without a brain. But if somebody told youthat the piano composed “Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star,” the statement wouldmake no sense. A piano is only a machine; it doesn’t create new music. You can’toverturn this fact by examining the molecules inside each ivory key under anelectron microscope to explain where Mozart comes from, but brain researchers dojust that when they probe the molecular structure of neurons for the hiddenorigin of thoughts and feelings. Before a piano can produce music, a mind mustwrite the notes. Before a brain can register a thought, a mind must think it.For centuries the mystery of how the mind relates to the body has been aphilosophical question, not a practical one. So far as ordinary life goes, brainversus mind isn’t a pressing debate. We say, “I’ve made up my mind,” not “I’vemade up my brain.” The average person goes through life never questioning thatit takes a mind to be human. But this seemingly ivory-tower issue has incrediblypractical implications. You cannot be indifferent to the question of mind versusbrain if the mind serves as a portal to a deeper reality; if reaching thatreality can transform your life, mind versus brain turns into the most urgentquestion of all.We don’t lack for inner voyagers. Neuroscience has already shown that the brainscans of advanced Buddhist monks are very different from the norm. (Earlier Imentioned the finding that the monks’ brains operated at twice the frequency ofnormal brains in the gamma wave region.) The biggest discovery was that generalactivity in the prefrontal cortex was very intense—more intense, in fact, thanever observed before—a change that came about after years of meditation oncompassion. As it happens, the prefrontal cortex is the brain’s center forcompassion, among other higher functions. In this case, it would be inaccurateto say that the brain changed itself. First the monks had the intention to becompassionate; they meditated upon it for years, and their brains followed suit.This is the opposite of what science expected. One much-publicized view amongWestern doctors has been that visionaries like Saint Teresa of Avila and SaintBernadette, figures who have had mystical experiences, might have suffered frombrain lesions, epilepsy, or some other malady that fooled them into thinkingthey were experiencing God. (Among confirmed atheists, the way to explain a holyvision comes down to a choice between hoax, delusion, and brain disease. Thelast is actually the most compassionate explanation.) Skeptics can argue allthey want about how an unbalanced brain fools mental patients into believing inillusions. Some schizophrenics with grandiose delusions believe that they canmake a locomotive stop by standing in front of it and willing it to stop. Faithhealers believe that they can cure cancer by asking God’s help. Scoffers callsuch beliefs magical thinking. Everyone knows that you can’t move objects withyour mind. Yet that is precisely what you do when you make a fist or throw aball: not only does your mind move thousands of molecules in the brain, but yourintention spreads throughout the nervous system, reaching the muscles andbones—every step of the way is mind over matter. As for equating saintlinesswith mental disease, such a judgment is insulting and foolish on the very faceof it.What does matter is a strong desire to be close to God. As we saw with Tibetanmonks, intention translates itself into new brain functioning. Why is that soincredible? Nobody can explain why we have any thoughts, so it’s not thatexperiencing God is more mysterious than experiencing orange juice or the WorldSeries. We can’t shift in a spiritual direction unless the brain shifts, too,and it’s our desire that alters the material landscape of the brain, not viceversa.In many ways neurology is a red herring when deciding what a valid experienceamounts to, since the visual cortex lights up when you actually see a horse andwhen you dream of one. An image is an image is an image, to paraphrase GertrudeStein. Spirituality embraces a wider perspective. The cosmos didn’t have to waitbillions of years before the human brain evolved. The cosmos was behavingmindfully long before that. Here’s eminent physicist Freeman Dyson: “It appearsthat mind, as manifested by the capacity to make choices, is to some extentinherent in every electron.”So which came first, mind or brain? Science is used to solving hard problems,but this one, as Leonard notes, is considered the hard problem. I’d like topropose that pitting mind versus brain is a no-win proposition. The hard problemcan be settled without either side losing. Why must we claim that mind createsmatter—or vice versa—in the first place? Such a need disappears once we concedethat there is no entry point in the last 13.7 billion years when matter suddenlylearned to think and feel. When we stop futilely searching for that fictitiousmoment, a better answer appears: mind has always been here, if not eternally,then as long as gravity and the laws of Nature have been here.In this alternate view, the cosmic mind surrounds us so completely that nomatter what we do it won’t go away. It exists in our heart, liver, and gut cellsas much as in our brain, providing intelligence, organizing power, creativity,and everything else. Even if you lose your mind through psychosis, drugs, or acatastrophic accident, the aspect of intelligence that keeps the body going willbe intact (as we witness with patients in a coma). This neatly solves thechicken-or-the-egg riddle about which came first, mind or brain. “Coming first”isn’t valid or relevant in the quantum vacuum, which is outside space and time.If gravity and mathematics began there, it’s a small step to give mind the samestatus. After all, there’s no way to experience mathematics, gravity, oranything else without a mind.I realize that this small step carries science where many don’t want it to go,into the realm of things that cannot be quantified. But science is alreadythere. (A personal aside: I once discussed consciousness with a prominentphysicist deeply versed in the hard problem. When I asked if he wanted todiscuss the issue publicly, he shrank away. “You don’t understand. Consciousnessis the skeleton in the closet. We don’t discuss it, and if I did, myprofessional reputation would be ruined.”) Rumi, the beloved Sufi mystic,understood that mind is everywhere when he said, “The whole universe existsinside you. Ask all from yourself.” Placing the mind center stage in theuniverse solves a vexing riddle wrapped inside the hard problem, as follows:When I see a sunset in my mind’s eye, its glowing orange splashing across asapphire sky, where is that sunset? It’s not in my brain, because the brain hasno light or pictures inside it. There is nothing in the brain but soft quiveringtissue, pockets of water, and stygian darkness. Yet the sunset I envision has tobe somewhere, and the best answer is mental space.In mental space mind and matter move together as one. If I want to remember mymother’s face, I conjure it up instantly. It doesn’t matter how many thousandsof neurons must be orchestrated, or what centers of the brain must light up, toturn memory into a visible image. Mind and matter are inseparable. As theinstrument of consciousness, the human brain needed time to evolve. Once itevolved sufficiently, a thought and a neuron became connected as perfectly as apianist and a piano—only in this case, the brain plays the music of life.Leonard offered Maxwell’s Demon to defend the basic laws of physics. I have nodifficulty with that, so long as “basic laws” include the quantum world fromwhich all possibilities spring. Let me offer Deepak’s Demon to defend the mind.This demon is perched on the top of the Empire State Building peering down atthe traffic. Cars heading along Fifth Avenue sometimes turn left and sometimesturn right. The demon knows that all the cars are obeying the laws of physics,as are the atoms inside the bodies of the drivers. He knows that a statisticalprediction can be made about which car might turn left or right. Does that meanthat the laws of probability tell us what each driver is doing? Not at all,because Deepak’s Demon realizes that each car represents a mind making adecision. Am I going to Macy’s or to the United Nations? One is left, the otheris right. Without the mind deciding first, cars don’t turn.So the hard problem can be solved, but it takes a broader vision to do it.Reductionism isn’t enough. When asked what the quantum world means for everydaylife, physics generally shrugs and goes about its day-to-day business. Thisattitude has been summarized as “Shut up and calculate.” Physics is proud of itsdesire to remain aloof from metaphysics. But like it or not, we must bring theessence of existence center stage. Our minds cannot rest until we know what themind is. Spirituality has always welcomed that quest; now it’s time for scienceto do so as well.dy>"},{"pageContent":"13"},{"pageContent":"[../images/00009.jpeg]DOES THE BRAIN DICTATE BEHAVIOR?"},{"pageContent":"[../images/00010.jpeg]DEEPAKThe average person can’t easily be talked out of free will. If you go to aChinese restaurant, you get to choose from column A or column B. You do not feelthat someone or something is choosing for you. The universe runs according tophysical laws, but we are still free to make our own choices. We may doubt ourjudgment afterward, it’s true. Falling into a bad habit shows how some choicesstick around and cannot easily be changed. Addictions go a step further. Theymake us feel that we are slaves to our craving and have no choice but to obey.Spirituality is about widening your choices. Science can aid in this project orhold it back. It aids by giving us control over mechanical switches, whetherthey are in the brain or in our genes. It holds back the project when it insiststhat our brains or genes control us. No issue is more critical, becauseultimately there is only one master, either you or the mechanisms built intoyour body. Most of us have not faced this issue head-on. We exert choice some ofthe time and run on automatic the rest of the time. Hence the resistance toposting the nutritional facts about a Big Mac on the menu. Nutrition involvesthinking; fast food is mindless. Sometimes we are clear, sometimes confused,sometimes in charge, sometimes the victim of our conditioning. But life doesn’thave to be so compromised.At the moment, mainstream science is highly deterministic. As Leonard notes inan earlier essay, “Our choices are far more automatic and constrained than we’dlike to think.” I find that assessment both gloomy and unrealistic. In a brainscan, the same area of the prefrontal cortex associated with the motherlyfeeling of nurture lights up when the subject see photos of a baby or a puppy. Adeterminist would say that an identical reaction is taking place. But when youwalk into a room where a baby is present, you don’t give it a dog treat and burpthe Irish setter. We override our brains all the time.This is incredibly important, because it’s all too easy to give up your powerand lapse into unconsciousness. When you sit down with a bag of potato chips andeat the whole thing without noticing what you’re doing, you have goneunconscious. When you let another person dominate or even abuse you because youdon’t want to make waves, you’ve gone unconscious, too. Reclaiming the power ofchoice comes down to reclaiming consciousness; the first step in this process isthat you must want to be awake, aware, flexible, and free of old habits.Neuroscience doesn’t help in this regard when it reduces thinking and feeling tochemical reactions and electrical signals in the brain. Pathways that supposedlydictate behavior are mapped on MRIs and CAT scans. By now everyone has seen TVprograms showing how a normal brain lights up compared to a distorted brain, thedistortion being anything from a brain tumor, depression, or insomnia tocriminality or schizophrenia. Such findings cannot be dismissed, of course. Themind has no choice but to be yoked to the brain, and when the brain isphysically out of balance, mental changes will occur. But this is far fromsaying that the brain controls the mind.Your behavior is constantly being influenced from many angles, both within andwithout. Indeed, one proof that the brain doesn’t control the mind is that thebrain lights up the same way when you remember a stress, like a bad autoaccident or being fired from your job, as when you actually go through thestress. But we have no trouble knowing that a memory isn’t the same as the realthing. Some determinists claim that thinking must be rooted in brain chemicalsbecause the two are exactly correlated. A rush of adrenaline appears when aperson becomes suddenly excited or afraid. The physical signs of fear areundoubtedly triggered by adrenaline, but that’s not the same as saying thatadrenaline, or any other chemical, causes fear.Let’s go into this a bit more deeply. There’s a 2010 study from the Mount SinaiSchool of Medicine on the link between a hormone called oxytocin and how grownchildren feel about their mothers. Oxytocin, popularly known as “the hormone oflove” because it appears in higher levels when people are in love, is foundthroughout the body; in the brain it has been associated with a number ofpositive things like trust, sexual pleasure, and low anxiety. When mothers givebirth, oxytocin levels rise in the brain, which is connected to a powerfulfeeling of nurturing. Mothers who reject their babies or feel postpartumdepression seem to lack this burst of oxytocin.Chemical determinists would appear to have a powerful argument for their case,saying that oxytocin causes people to feel better in various ways, and theirelevated mood leads to more positive thoughts. For example, a dose of oxytocinwill make people act and feel more generous when they are put in a situationwhere they can choose to be generous or not. So does low oxytocin make a Scroogeand high oxytocin a philanthropist like Warren Buffett? That would indeed bedeterministic. The new study casts serious doubts, however. When adults who hadhappy relationships with their mothers were given oxytocin, they rememberedhaving even more positive feelings. But here’s the rub. When subjects reportedthat they had a bad relationship with their mothers, a dose of oxytocinincreased those bad feelings. The “hormone of love” has a dark side. More to thepoint, there isn’t a one-to-one correlation to loving feelings, much less anestablished cause.I’ve already mentioned the crudest metaphor used by proponents of artificialintelligence, that the human brain is a machine made of meat. Many brainresearchers don’t take this as a metaphor but as literal fact, to which there isa simple but devastating reply: a machine can’t decide not to be a machine, butwe do, all the time. Our nervous system can run the body on automaticpilot—that’s why patients in a coma aren’t dead—but if you’re not in a coma, thesame nervous system can release the controls over to the mind. To say that it’sthe machine itself that decides when to be in control and when not to be defiescommon sense; that’s like having a car engine decide “It’s my turn to drive.”The existence of free will, along with mind over matter, was once supported byneuroscience. In the 1930s a pioneering Canadian brain surgeon named WilderPenfield discovered that if you stimulate the area of the brain that controlslarge muscles (the motor cortex), those muscles move involuntarily. In onetrial, Penfield inserted a delicate wire into the specific area of the motorcortex that controls the arm, and when he sent a tiny shock through it, thepatient’s arm would shoot up. He would ask his patients what just happened.Their response was “My arm just moved.” (Brain surgery is regularly performedwith the patient awake and conscious, because the inner tissue of the brainfeels no pain.)So far, Penfield’s results sound highly deterministic. He showed a causal linkbetween brain and body, and it would seem to be only a small step to say thatthe brain must be controlling the body. But Penfield believed in the existenceof the mind. He told his patients to raise their arms (without sending a smallshock through the wire), which they easily did. Then he asked, “What happenednow?” Their response was “I lifted my arm.” In other words, patients knew thedifference between “My arm just shot up” and “I lifted my arm.” One isautomatic, the other voluntary. It’s deeply ironic, then, that brain researchersnow defend the notion of determinism by replaying this same experiment to provethat the brain controls us when in fact it proves the opposite. (Penfield wenton in his distinguished career to insist that the brain serves the mind.)When people undertake spiritual disciplines like yoga, meditation,self-reflection, and devotion, they discover that it’s possible to attainmastery even over involuntary processes. In a few minutes, for example, I couldshow you how to lower your metabolic rate and blood pressure through a simpleexercise in focused attention. When carried to real mastery, meditation can slowheart and breathing rates almost to zero, a feat displayed by Eastern yogis andswamis. I could show you how to choose to make your palms warmer, or even todevelop a red patch of hot skin on the back of your hand. Tibetan monks usetheir minds to warm their whole bodies sufficiently to sit all night in freezingHimalayan caves wearing only a thin silk robe. The worldview I’m arguing forwants people to move in the direction of such mastery.What would you look like as a master? Let’s ask the question with no religiousovertones or exotic images of yogis and monks. Mastery means that you would beable to pursue self-determination—that is, you would have the freedom to writeyour own life script. There could be as many life scripts as there are people,but they’d all have one thing in common: a person’s desires would increase hisor her well-being. Right now, few of us can confidently match our desires withour well-being. We are severely limited by repetition and habit. This is wherefree will hits a wall, hard and often. But why?You and I are spiritual paradoxes. Gifted with the most flexible nervous systemin the universe, we tie it down with a thousand tiny ropes, just as Gulliver wastied to the beach by the Lilliputians. We are attached to our own little ways ofdoing things, our firm likes and dislikes, not to mention our memories, pastconditioning, and emotional hot buttons that other people can push. A cognitivepsychologist once calculated that 90 percent of the thoughts a person thinkstoday are the same as those he thought yesterday. We pay a high price forletting the nervous system run on automatic pilot.It’s tempting to blame our lack of mastery on the brain. Wedded to determinism,brain science used to make basic assertions that were eventually proven to befalse. One such assertion held that the brain was inexorably hardwired for agiven response. A good example is fear. When our ancestors were threatened bywild animals, they went into fight-or-flight mode, and the anatomical reason forthat is our lower brain, inherited from ancestors as primitive as fish andreptiles. Stacked on top of the lower brain, exactly like an archaeological digwhere new cities are stacked over the buried ruins of ancient cities, is thehigher brain, or cortex. The higher brain is where we counter fear. We can lookat a threat and tell ourselves, “Calm down. That wasn’t a gun going off; it wasa car backfiring,” or “I’m scared, but I can’t let my kids see it.”There are myriad ways for you to deal with fear through reason and higheremotions like devotion to family or a sense of duty. But fear comes first. Fightor flight has a privileged pathway in the brain, which is why you jump when acar backfires and think about it later. Thinking enables you to decide that thebackfire was harmless. No need to fight or flee. In itself this two-partsequence seems beneficial. It’s good to react quickly to danger, even if thedanger turns out to be illusory. The problem is that if a reaction is repeatedoften enough, it forms fixed tracks in the brain, neural pathways that workautomatically, curtailing freedom of choice. Each of us knows what it’s like tolose control over our anger, eating habits, weight, anxiety, depression, andcravings of every kind. There’s wisdom in the Talmudic saying, “No man owns hisinstincts.” But civilization teaches us how to make them our allies, not ourenemy.In spiritual terms, losing control is traced to falling asleep. Strongmaterialists believe that the brain runs the show anyway: being awake (i.e.,more free to choose) is a fairy tale we tell ourselves. They believe we aremarionettes that refuse to see the strings that control them, and since thebrain pulls invisible strings made of chemicals and electric signals, we arefooled into believing that our feelings of love, courage, and kindness, and ouraspirations, have any force or meaning.But what about the obvious fact that some people manage to break their oldhabits, overcome past conditioning, work through fears, and recover fromaddictions? Obeying a habit and kicking it are opposites. It cannot be true thatthe brain rigidly dictates behavior A and the opposite of behavior A. Inevitablybrain science has had to soften its insistence on hard wiring, leading to atheory of soft wiring, which allows the brain to change the way a person wantsit to change. The technical term for this is “neuroplasticity,” which refers tohow neural pathways can be altered at will.Suddenly the prospect of mastery opens up enormously. A spectacular exampleinvolves going blind. Contrary to popular belief, blind people don’t plunge intototal darkness. Inner sight of some kind generally remains. One man blinded by aspray of industrial acid went on to envision and develop intricate gear boxeswith dozens of interlocking parts. Another took up roofing and alarmed theneighbors by doing his work on extremely steep gables that he climbed at night.Sometimes another faculty takes over from sight. I once read about a blindmarine biologist whose specialty was gathering highly poisonous sea snails inthe Indian Ocean; he found the creatures with his toes, used touch to identifythem, and never got poisoned. Eventually these inspiring examples ofneuroplasticity led to a new technology, known as BrainPort, which gives thebrain a controlled way to replace one sense with another.The BrainPort device, which resembles a cap outfitted with electrodes, began asa wired-up chair mounted with a camera above and a pad on the back of the blindperson that delivered a pattern of electrical signals to the skin. The personsitting in the chair would receive an image of what the camera saw by having theimage sent to his back through the sense of touch. The brain transformed the“felt” image into a “seen” image. This breakthrough, which happened forty yearsago, showed that one sense can substitute for another.Later, neuroscientist Paul Bach-y-Rita, having made this breakthrough, found away to restore balance to people whose brains had been damaged in that region.Losing your sense of balance is very disorienting, like walking perpetually on arocking ship at sea. Bach-y-Rita placed a small pad on their tongue that sent atiny electrical signal to the right, left, front, or back of the tongue,depending on which way the unbalanced person was tilting. His subjects quicklylearned to bring the signal to the middle of the tongue, which meant that theywere upright. After a while, the brain took over the task by itself. A personwho previously couldn’t stand up without falling over, now could be weaned offthe BrainPort and walk, or even ride a bicycle, on their own.The brain is guided by determination, as was learned very early by theBach-y-Rita family. In 1959 Paul’s father, Pedro, suffered a debilitating strokethat paralyzed one side of his body and impaired his speech. A second son,George, was a psychiatrist, and by defying the prevailing belief back then thatsuch damage would be irreversible (the brain wasn’t supposed to be able to healitself), George helped his father regain a normal life. Years later, when Pedrodied, his brain was examined, and it was found that the brain stem, the portiondamaged by the stroke, had in fact repaired itself.One aspect of science can be thanked for these discoveries, even if anotheraspect clings to determinism. The fork in the road could hardly be clearer. Ifyou and I choose to attain mastery, our spiritual goal finds a physical ally.The human brain, like the universe itself, delivers whatever you expect it to,in accordance with your deepest beliefs. So why not believe that your brain candeliver mastery? If one sense can be substituted for another, if the brain canheal itself, and if new neural pathways develop because a person decides theycan, there is much more freedom available to us than anyone ever supposed."},{"pageContent":"[../images/00010.jpeg]LEONARDIn his book The Incoherence of the Philosophers, the eleventh-century Sufiphilosopher Abu Hamid al-Ghazali wrote that when fire is held to cotton, thecotton is not burned by the fire, but is burned directly by God. According tothis view, our expectation that the fire causes the cotton to burn arisesbecause each time that we have placed cotton in fire, God has willed that thecotton burn; but the fire itself cannot dictate the burning because that wouldtie God’s hands, and God is free to do whatever God wishes. More generally,al-Ghazali argued that the laws of nature are a kind of illusion we’ve come tobelieve in because God is rational and usually consistent (except in the casesof miracles). The connection between cause and effect only seems to followunalterable laws, with the true causes of events lying beyond our physicalrealm.Deepak and many others have an attitude very similar to this when it comes tothe connection between the physical brain and human consciousness. We can studythe brain and understand its laws, but in their view the physical substrate ofour cortex is ultimately controlled by an invisible hand of consciousness thatis the true source of our thoughts, feelings, and actions. Deepak believes thatthe brain is the puppet of the immaterial mind—which because it is immaterial isnot governed by physical laws.Deepak compares the neurons in our brain to a piano, and our conscious mind tothe music it plays. In this view, consciousness is expressed by our physicalbrain just as musical notes are brought to life by a physical piano. Deepaksays, “You can’t play ‘Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star’ on a piano without apiano.… But if somebody told you that the piano composed ‘Twinkle, Twinkle,Little Star,’ the statement would make no sense.” That is true. But if somebodytold you that “Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star” was composed in an immaterialrealm of universal consciousness, that would also sound illogical—and that, ifyou follow Deepak’s analogy, is the alternative he offers.Let’s not be misled by analogies. While both viewpoints—that consciousness comesfrom an outside realm, and that it arises within the brain itself—are admittedlychallenging, the way to make progress in elucidating the connection between mindand brain is to examine the brain, and see how much of what we do and feel canbe accounted for by its actions. Deepak writes that you can’t understandanything about the connection between a piano and how the music that is playedon it is made by “examining the molecules inside each ivory key under anelectron microscope,” which he believes is comparable to what brain researchersare trying to do when they look at the brain in order to find a physical basisfor the mind. But when one looks at the brain, one does find that there isplenty of evidence to indicate that the brain is the source of consciousness.Deepak and I have been doing all the work so far, which is only fair, since weare the authors. But here is a little exercise for you. Have a look at theblocks pictured on the next page. One of the black tops looks long and narrow,the other shorter and wider. They aren’t—if you measure them, you’ll find theyare identical. You are fooled because the perspectives in the drawings weredesigned to take advantage of a quirk in the way your brain perceives shapes.Now please look at the blocks again, and, now that you know they are identical,try to see them that way. You’ll find that you can’t. Such illusions and theinability to overcome them are evidence that there is no external mind separatefrom the physical brain and capable of lording over it. We cannot transcend theworkings of the physical brain.[../images/00011.jpeg]Here’s another example. Have a look at the faces below. How do they strike you?A male and a female of roughly equal attractiveness, with the woman on theright? We all have our own quirks when it comes to making assessments ofattractiveness, but the first requirement for a successful love life is beingable to recognize the sex of your preference when you see it. And if you thinkthe faces below belong to people of different sexes, you are wrong. They are thesame face, differing only in the degree of contrast in the photograph. In bothEast Asians and Caucasians—the populations studied—female faces exhibit greatercontrast, and though that is probably news to you, it is not news to your brain.It automatically interprets the image with less contrast as male, and even afteryou know the faces are identical, it is difficult or impossible to override yourbrain’s automatic judgment.[../images/00012.jpeg]There are also many striking examples of the deterministic connection betweenthe brain and the mind in nonhuman animals. I mentioned the courtship of fruitflies last chapter. It accounts for most of their social life and is, in oneresearcher’s words, “the activity they do best.” The male’s usual courtshipbehavior is to approach the female, tap her with his forelegs, vibrate hiswings, lick her, and then curl his abdomen and wait. If she is interested,she’ll approach, and if not, she’ll buzz her wings at him. How can one accountfor the swagger of the fruit fly? It has been traced to a gene that causes aparticular protein to be created in certain neurons within the fly’s brain.Those neurons appear to direct each step of the coordinated sequence ofcourtship. For example, when a biologist genetically engineered female flies tomake the male version of that protein, the females aggressively pursued otherfemales, and performed the male courtship dance.Mammals, too, can be manipulated chemically or genetically in a manner thatseems to reduce them to robots. For example, though female sheep—ewes—can bedownright nasty to strange lambs, they appear to be caring and loving mothers totheir own babies. As it turns out, their admirable maternal behavior is directlytraceable to the oxytocin that is released in the mother’s brain when it givesbirth. During the period in which her oxytocin level is elevated (which aftergiving birth lasts about two hours) a ewe will suckle and bond with any lambthat approaches, learn its smell, and then proceed to raise it to adulthoodwhether or not it is her own. Outside that window of time, however, a ewe willchase off any lamb she has not previously bonded with—even her own infant if thenew baby was withheld until her oxytocin levels fell. Moreover, the ewe’sbonding behavior can be turned back on at any time through an injection ofoxytocin.Other animals in which the role of oxytocin has been studied extensively are thevoles, a group of about 150 species that resemble mice. One type of vole, theprairie vole, is a loyal mate that forms bonds for life and rarely takes on anew partner, even if its original partner disappears. Two other species of vole,however, the montane and meadow voles, are promiscuous loners. As in sheep, thebehavior of these animals can be traced to oxytocin, and to a related compoundcalled vasopressin. Increasing the level of these chemicals in the brain of apromiscuous montane or meadow vole will make it a model husband and father,while decreasing the level in the prairie vole will cause it to act more likeits loner cousins. Interestingly, scientists have found a gene that governsvasopressin receptors in the human brain and have observed that it causesdifferences among humans analogous to the differences between the voles. Men whofall into the montane/meadow vole category in terms of their vasopressin levelswere found to be twice as likely to have experienced marital problems, and halfas likely to be married.Deepak asks, “So does low oxytocin make a Scrooge and high oxytocin aphilanthropist like Warren Buffett? That would indeed be deterministic.” We canobviously perform only limited experiments on humans, but when oxytocin brainlevels are manipulated in animals, the answer has been yes, such manipulationsdo result in the corresponding behavioral changes.The relationship between oxytocin and behavior in people is of course far morecomplex than in these animals. As Deepak mentions, in humans oxytocin also seemsto have a connection with certain negative feelings. That is not a sign thatbrains don’t determine behavior. It means only that brains are complicated, andhormones play many roles. But in human mothers, as in ewes, oxytocin is releasedduring labor and delivery, and promotes bonding.That the brain directs behavior and emotions is also sadly evident in peoplewhose brains have been damaged. Nowhere is the effect of an altered brain onbehavior starker than when it impacts a person’s moral judgment. “Moral judgmentis, for many, the quintessential operation of the mind beyond the body, theEarthly signature of the soul,” wrote neuroscientist Joshua Greene. But Greeneand other scientists have made a lot of progress in understanding how thephysical brain creates moral judgment just as it encodes memories or interpretsvisual information. One area of the brain vital to that function is called theventromedial prefrontal cortex, or VMPC, which sits just inches behind theforehead. Patients with severe impairment of the VMPC have unchangedintellectual abilities, but they exhibit less empathy and a reduced revulsion tohurting others. In one study a group with VMPC injuries and a control group werepresented with a series of hypothetical moral choices involving the killing ofan innocent person for the greater good. Those with VMPC injuries were twice aslikely to say they’d push someone in front of a train to save a group of othersor suffocate a baby whose crying threatened to attract enemy soldiers. In reallife VMPC damage has been associated with the onset of divorce, job loss, andinappropriate social conduct. In fact, many habitual criminals are psychopathswho typically begin to exhibit cruelty in their early years, and display shallowemotion and lack of empathy throughout their lives. Neuroscientists have found aneural basis for their behaviors, implicating a wide range of brain regions suchas the VMPC and the amygdala. “Because of their brain damage, these patientshave abnormal social emotions,” said neuroscientist Ralph Adolphs, one of theVMPC researchers.We commonly accept that physical disability in stroke victims is due to braindamage, but the prospect of viewing “evil” as a neurological deficit, the directresult of a person’s brain structure, can be unsettling. It may feel as thoughwe are excusing the individual (“his brain made him do it”). There is one group,however, for whom we do readily make allowances for moral or ethical lapsestraceable to insufficient development of the prefrontal cortex. This is aneasily identifiable group, and one close to the heart of many of us. I’mreferring, of course, to children. We recognize that below a certain agechildren should not be treated as responsible adults or held accountable in thesame way. Our legal system makes this distinction, and so do most of us—the mainreason for this being that the prefrontal cortex isn’t fully developed until theearly twenties. The risk-taking behaviors of teenagers, and their lack ofimpulse control in the face of the urge for immediate gratification, are commonknowledge, and now we know not just that they exist, but why.I agree with Deepak that human behavior “is constantly being influenced frommany angles.” Those angles include past experiences and current circumstances,and their influence on the many brain structures whose complex interactionscreate the people we are. But all those angles are within our physical world.There is no evidence that, as Deepak believes, our brains are controlled bysomething outside them. Still, we are not slaves to our genes. People canchange, and I agree with Deepak that “when people undertake spiritualdisciplines like yoga, meditation, self-reflection, and devotion, they discoverthat it’s possible to attain mastery even over involuntary processes.”Neuroscience doesn’t debunk those ideas; it provides support for them. In fact,the studies of Buddhist monks that have shown how they can modulate the activityof their brains are illustrations of a feedback loop. Like the experimentalsubjects I mentioned in chapter 12 [part0023_split_000.html] who could maketheir neurons fire at will in order to control images on a computer screen, themonks offer another example of a decision of the mind-brain system that canalter the brain.Mastery, self-determination, and the freedom to write our own life script areadmirable goals, and I believe that we—that is, our brains—can achieve thosegoals. And they don’t have to leave the material world to do it.dy>"},{"pageContent":"14"},{"pageContent":"[../images/00009.jpeg]IS THE BRAIN LIKE A COMPUTER?"},{"pageContent":"[../images/00010.jpeg]LEONARDIn 1955 a group of computer scientists appealed to the Rockefeller Foundation tofund a meeting of ten experts at Dartmouth College. The scientists said theyintended to “proceed on the basis of the conjecture that every aspect oflearning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so preciselydescribed that a machine can be made to simulate it. An attempt will be made tofind how to make machines use language, form abstractions and concepts, solvekinds of problems now reserved for humans, and improve themselves.” They statedtheir agenda clearly and concisely, but the most striking sentence of theirproposal is the one that followed their agenda statement. They said, “We thinkthat a significant advance can be made in one or more of these problems if acarefully selected group of scientists work on it together for a summer.” Inretrospect, it seems obvious that significant progress in artificialintelligence comes over decades, not “a summer.” As cognitive neuroscientistMichael Gazzaniga put it, they were “a little optimistic.”At the very heart of this early overoptimism is the “brain-as-computer”metaphor, which is, at best, an oversimplification. The operatingcharacteristics of biological brains are very unlike those of the computers thatwere used in 1955, or even of the much more sophisticated ones we build today.Conventional computers consist of electronic components such as transistors—akind of on-off switch—that implement a series of logical operations calledgates. Logician George Boole proved in 1854 that any “logical expression,”including complicated mathematical calculations, can be implemented by a “logiccircuit” made by wiring together components built from just four fundamentalgates, called AND, OR, NOT, and COPY. These gates transform one or two bits ofinformation at a time (a bit is a register—a storage location—that can have thevalue 0 or 1). For example, a NOT gate changes a 0 to a 1 and vice versa, whilea COPY gate changes 0 to 00, and 1 to 11. Whatever it is used for, all acomputer is really doing is applying electronic logic gates to bits, one or twoat a time. Brains, on the other hand, execute operations in a parallel manner,doing millions of things simultaneously.There are many other distinctions. Brains’ processes are noisy—that is, subjectto undesired electrical disturbances that degrade useful information—whilecomputers are reliable. Brains can survive the removal of individual neurons,while a computer operation will fail if even a single transistor it employs isdestroyed. Brains adjust themselves to the tasks at hand, while computers aredesigned and programmed for each finite task they must perform. The physicalarchitectures, too, are quite different. The human brain contains a thousandtrillion synapses, while a multimillion-dollar system of computer hardware todaymight have a trillion transistors. Moreover, though synapses (the gaps betweenneurons through which electrical and chemical signals flow) are a bit liketransistors, a neuron’s behavior is vastly more complex than that of a computercomponent. For example, a neuron fires—sending its own signal to thousands ofothers—when the aggregate signals from the neurons that feed it reach a criticalthreshold, but the timing of the incoming signals matters. There are alsoinhibitory signals, and neurons can contain elements that modify the effect ofincoming messages. It’s an intricate design of vastly greater richness andcomplexity than anything employed in electronic devices.Still, a metaphor can be useful even if the things being compared correspond injust one aspect. Carson McCullers wrote that “the heart is a lonely hunter,” andthat is a wonderful observation despite the fact that hearts don’t carry rifles.So it can be helpful to think of the brain as a computer despite the differencesin physical design and operation if, for example, biological brains and computer“brains” produce similar behavior. Among simple animals and advanced (by today’sstandards) computers that can certainly be the case. Take the female huntingwasp, Sphex flavipennis. When a female of that species is ready to lay her eggs,she digs a hole and hunts down a cricket. The expectant mother stings her preythree times, then drags the paralyzed insect to the edge of the burrow andcarefully positions it so that its antennae just touch the opening. After thecricket is in place the wasp enters the tunnel to inspect it. If all is well,she drags the cricket inside and lays her eggs nearby so that the cricket canserve as food once the grubs emerge. The wasp’s role as mother completed, sheseals the exit and flies away. Like the ewes I described in the previouschapter, these female wasps appear to be acting thoughtfully, and with logic andintelligence. But as the French naturalist Jean-Henri Fabre noted in 1915, ifthe cricket is moved even slightly while the wasp is inside inspecting theburrow, when the wasp emerges she will reposition the cricket at the entrance,and again climb down into the burrow and look around—as if she had arrived withthe cricket for the very first time. In fact, no matter how many times thecricket is moved, the wasp will repeat her entire ritual. It seems that the waspis not intelligent and thoughtful after all, but rather follows a hardwiredalgorithm, a fixed set of rules. Fabre wrote, “This insect, which astounds us,which terrifies us with its extraordinary intelligence, surprises us, in thenext moment, with its stupidity, when confronted with some simple fact thathappens to lie outside its ordinary practice.” Cognitive scientist DouglasHofstadter calls this behavior “sphexishness.”If living creatures can appear intelligent, but disappoint when they sink to thelevel of sphexishness, digital computers can excite us when they rise to meritthat same modest label. For example, in 1997 a chess-playing machine named DeepBlue beat reigning world chess champion Garry Kasparov in a six-game match.Afterward Kasparov said he saw intelligence and creativity in some of thecomputer’s moves and accused Deep Blue of obtaining advice from human experts.In the limited domain of chess, Deep Blue seemed not only human, but superhuman.But although the human character Deep Blue displayed on the chessboard was farmore complex, nuanced, and convincing than the motherly care displayed by thewasp, it did not arise from a process most of us would be likely to think of asintelligent. The three-thousand-pound machine made its humanlike decisions byexamining 200 million chess positions each second, which typically allowed it tolook six to eight moves ahead, and in some cases, twenty or more. In addition,it stored a library of moves and responses applicable to the early part of thegame, and another library of special rule-based strategies for the endgame.Kasparov, on the other hand, said he could analyze just a few positions eachsecond, and he relied more on human intuition than on processor power. Evenwithout checking under the hood, there is an easy way to illuminate thedifferences in intelligence: just change the game a bit. For example, scramblethe pieces’ starting positions—or eliminate the rule, important in the endgame,that allows a pawn to be traded for any more powerful piece if it advances tothe opposite end of the board. Kasparov would be able to adjust his thinkingaccordingly. But Deep Blue would be more like the wasp, unable to adapt tocircumstances and make a judgment, its enormous apparent intelligence suddenlydecimated by its inflexibility.Deep Blue had a superhuman ability in chess, but it wasn’t what most of us wouldterm “intelligent.” The same can be said of Watson, IBM’s Jeopardy-playingcomputer that in 2011 beat the best human champions. To equip it for the game,IBM stuffed Watson with 200 million pages of content stored on 4,000 gigabytesof disk space, and endowed it with 16,000 gigabytes of RAM and an estimated 6million rules of logic to help it arrive at its answers. Still, though Watsonwas usually right, it got to the answers through brute-force searches based onstatistical correlations, not on anything one could call an “understanding” ofthe question. That issue was best illuminated by some of its wrong answers, suchas choosing Toronto as an answer in the category “U.S. Cities.” Behind its vastfact base, and impressive ability to answer questions posed in plain colloquiallanguage, there was actually nothing one could call real intelligence.Jeopardy is a relatively recent invention. So, too, are computers. That acomputer could be programmed to play chess like an intelligent human being wasoriginally proposed by mathematician Alan Turing in 1941, before the firstmachine that could reasonably be called an electronic computer had even beenbuilt. One of the most influential thinkers of the twentieth century, Turingprovided many of the ideas that form the foundation of computer science, and ofour digital age. He recognized the limitation of a computer having sphexishintelligence confined to a particular domain, and argued that thinking machinesshould also be learning machines, capable of altering their own configurations.How does one judge whether a computer is intelligent? In Turing’s view,intelligence should not be assessed according to the process through whichbeings or machines operate, but rather from the outside, by examining theirbehavior. That is how we judge people in our everyday lives—after all, wenormally have no access to the inner feelings and thought processes of people wedon’t know. Little was known in Turing’s day about the detailed workings ofbiological brains, but Turing believed that whatever the physical similaritiesand differences, a computer with intelligence and behavior similar to those of ahuman being would eventually be built.Turing’s life and brilliant career were cut tragically short when he committedsuicide in 1954 after being forced by the British government to undergo hormonetherapy because he was gay. But a few years before his death Turing published apaper titled “Computing Machinery and Intelligence,” in which he outlined a testfor intelligence that is now called the Turing test. In its current form, theTuring test consists of a human being and a computer that both interact throughtextual messages with an impartial human judge. If the judge cannot distinguishwhich contestant is the human, the machine is called intelligent. Turingpredicted that computers would pass this test within a half century, that is,before the year 2000.The Turing test burst into popular culture in 1966, with a simpletwo-hundred-line computer program called ELIZA, which employed a handful oftricks to generate bland responses that often sounded startlingly humanlike. Inthe decades since, computer scientists have created many other “chattingrobots.” Here is a snippet of dialogue from a chat at a recent Turing testcontest. Can you distinguish which speaker is the human judge and which is therobot contestant?BILL: Do you know any good jokes?JOAN: I don’t even know any bad ones. I just can’t remember them for very long.BILL: Please tell a joke.JOAN: What do you get if you walk under a cow?BILL: I don’t know.JOAN: A pat on the head.BILL: That’s very good.JOAN: I know.The actual conversation went on for twenty-five minutes. The truth: Joan is thecomputer. But unlike the designer of ELIZA, which merely followed fixed scripts,Joan’s creator took Turing’s advice and designed this machine to achieve its“intelligence” through learning: the program “chatted” online over a period ofyears with thousands of real people, building a database of several millionutterances which it searches statistically when composing its replies.Computer scientists still haven’t succeeded in creating a program that canconsistently fool human judges over an extended period of time. But knowing boththe degree to which programs like Joan do work, and how they work, suggests twoconclusions. First, achieving “intelligence” of the Turing test variety in adigital computer is far more difficult than most people initially thought.Second, there is something wrong with the Turing test—for a machine that cobblestogether speech by repeating responses it encountered previously isn’texhibiting intelligence any more than a nematode that slithers past a McDonald’sis demonstrating culinary sophistication.Though the Turing test is questionable, and has fallen out of favor withresearchers in artificial intelligence, no better litmus test for intelligentthought has gained general acceptance. There are some interesting ones outthere, however. Christof Koch and his colleague Giulio Tononi arguethat—contrary to Turing’s belief—the key point is to assess the process thebeing or machine in question utilizes, something easier said than done if youhave no access to the candidate’s inner workings. They propose that an entityshould be considered intelligent if, when presented with any random scene, itcan extract the gist of the image, describe the objects in it and theirrelationships—both spatial and causal—and make reasonable extrapolations andspeculations that go beyond what is pictured. The idea is that any camera canrecord an image, but only an intelligent being can interpret what it sees,reason about it, and successfully analyze novel situations. To pass theKoch-Tononi test a computer would have to integrate information from manydomains, create associations, and employ logic.For example, look at the image on the facing page from the film Repo Man. Aninsect crawling over the page might detect the photo’s purely physicalqualities—a rectangular array of pixels, each of which is colored in some shadeof gray. But in just an instant, and without apparent effort, your mind realizesthat the picture depicts a scene, identifies the visual elements, determineswhich are important, and invents a probable story regarding what is transpiring.To meet the criteria of the Koch-Tononi test an intelligent machine ought to beable to key in on the man with the gun, the victim with raised arms, and thebottles on the shelves. And it ought to be able to conclude that the photodepicts a liquor store robbery, that the robber is probably on edge, that thevictim is terrified, and that a getaway car might be waiting outside. (Thescenes depicted would obviously have to be tailored to the cultural knowledgebase of the person or computer being tested.) So far no computer can come close.An unintelligent brute-force approach like that which achieved limited successin passing the standard Turing test is of no help in passing the Koch-Tononitest. Even limited success in passing their own test, these researchers believe,is many years away. In fact, it was only a few years ago that computers gainedthe ability to do what a three-year-old child can do—distinguish a cat from adog.Is the fact that computers have had so little success thus far at achieving thesame sort of intelligence as our brain a technical problem, which we may one daysolve? Or is the human brain inherently impossible to replicate?[../images/00013.jpeg]In the abstract sense, the purpose of both brains and computers is to processinformation, that is, data and relations among data. Information is independentof the form that carries it. For example, suppose you study a scene, thenphotograph it and scan the photo into your computer. Neither your memory nor thecomputer’s will contain a literal image of the scene. Instead, through anarrangement of their own physical constituents, mind and computer will eachsymbolize the information defined by the scene in its own trademark fashion. Theinformation in the physical scene would now be represented in three forms: thephotographic image, its representation in your brain, and its representation inthe computer. Ignoring distortions and issues of limited resolution, these threerepresentations would all contain the same information.Turing and others turned such insights about information, and how it isprocessed, into an idea called the “computational theory of mind.” In thistheory, mental states such as your memory of the photograph, and more generallyyour knowledge and even your desires, are called computational states. These arerepresented in the brain by physical states of neurons, just as data andprograms are symbolized as states in the chips inside a computer. And just as acomputer follows its programs to process input data and produce output, thinkingis an operation that processes computational states and produces new ones. It isin this abstract sense that your mind is like a computer. But Turing also tookthe idea a big step further. He designed a hypothetical machine, now called aTuring machine, that in theory could simulate the logic of any computeralgorithm. That shows that, to the extent that the human brain follows some setof specified rules, a machine can indeed—in principle—be built that wouldsimulate it.The computational theory of mind has proved useful as a framework scientists canuse to think about the brain, and technical terms common in information theoryare now used widely in neuroscience, terms such as “signal processing,”“representations,” and “codes.” It helps us to think about mental processes in atheoretical way, and to better understand how beliefs and desires need notreside in some other realm, but can be embodied within the physical universe.Still, biological brains are not Turing machines. The human brain can do farmore than simply apply a set of algorithms to data and produce output. Asdescribed earlier, it can alter its own programming, and react to a changingenvironment—not just to sensory input from the outside, but even to its ownphysical state. And it has astonishing resilience. If the corpus callosum iscut, severing the brain in two, a person doesn’t die, but somehow goes onfunctioning, a wondrous testament to just how different we are from thecomputing machines that we build. A human brain can suffer the degradation ofdisease, or have vast sections obliterated through stroke or accidental impact,yet reorganize itself and go on. The brain can also react psychologically, andit is as resilient in its spirit as in its ability to heal itself. In Stumblingon Happiness, psychologist Daniel Gilbert wrote about an athlete who, afterseveral years of grueling chemotherapy, felt joyful and said, “I wouldn’t changeanything,” and about a musician who became disabled, but later said, “If I hadit to do all over again, I would want it to happen the same way.” How can theysay things like that? Whatever happens, we find our way. As Gilbert says,resilience is all around us. It is just these qualities of the human mind thatelevate it above simple algorithmic machines, providing both the beauty of beinghuman and the greatest mystery that science has yet to unravel."},{"pageContent":"[../images/00010.jpeg]DEEPAKThe last time someone asked you if it looked like rain, did you reply, “I’llhave to sample some randomized variables for that”? If a person came to you totranslate the Kalevala, the Finnish national epic, would you say, “I’m sorry,that’s not programmed in my software”? On the face of it, people don’t thinklike computers, which are machines that shuffle two numbers, 0 and 1, to arriveat their “thoughts.” Even if you believe, as Leonard apparently does, that thebrain will eventually reveal the secrets of the mind, the brain doesn’t operateusing 0s and 1s, either. There is really no similarity between our brains andany “thinking” machine yet devised, which means that those quotation marksaren’t going away.Inevitably, the once promising field of artificial intelligence (AI) has notcome close to reproducing actual thought. Leonard has covered the basic problemswith AI, so I could just nod my head in agreement and move on. But there’s acrucial question left hanging in the air. If the brain isn’t like a computer,what does it do to produce thoughts? I believe the answer is clear-cut: thebrain doesn’t produce thoughts. It transmits them from the mind. What does themind do, then? It creates meaning. Not only that, but meaning evolves, and as itdoes, the brain races to catch up, guided by the next interesting thing the mindwants to think about.If a computer could embrace meaning, AI would make an earthshaking breakthrough.Science fiction would become reality, since one of the favorite plots in sciencefiction consists of computers who outsmart their human masters, either turningon them or becoming all too human themselves. HAL the onboard computer stole themovie 2001: A Space Odyssey by sounding more sympathetic than the roboticastronauts traveling into deep space. The audience was shocked when HAL decidedto kill off the crew for the sake of the mission, and yet it was also touchingwhen the last surviving spaceman started to dismantle HAL’s memory, and thedying computer voice pleaded, “Please don’t do that, Dave. I feel strange.”Isaac Asimov’s I, Robot explores the same theme, when mankind’s mechanicalslaves rebel against their masters.The ability of computers to imitate us isn’t just entertaining. One of the moreingenious software programs was ELIZA, already referred to by Leonard. ELIZAused a clever trick, based on a school of psychotherapy developed bypsychologist Carl Rogers in the 1940s and 1950s, which put patients at ease bymaking empathic remarks of a seemingly simple kind, such as “I understand,”“Tell me more about that,” or just “Um.” Programming such statements into ELIZAbypassed the computer’s need to know anything about the real world. Bland,empathic remarks have the effect of making people feel heard and understood.Presto, a computer comes off as human. (In fact, various people who talked totheir computers through ELIZA reported therapeutic results as good as those of areal psychiatrist.)My position is that computers will never think—tricks can offer a goodimitation, but no machine is capable of creating meaning, of crossing the linethat separates mind from matter. However, the instant I make such a claim, ahuge obstacle stands in the way. The brain is matter, and it seems to traffic inmeaning. If squishy bits of watery floating chemicals in a brain cell cantransmit the words “I love you” and await with exquisite vulnerability to hearif the other person will reply “I love you, too,” a computer in the future maybe able to do the same. Why not?Rather than jumping headfirst into a complex argument about mind and meaning,let’s consider the following experiment. Subjects at Harvard volunteered for astudy in game strategy. They were seated in front of a monitor and told therules of a specific game. “You are playing with a partner who is hidden behind ascreen. There are two buttons each of you can push, marked 0 and 1. If you bothpress 1, you get a dollar, and so does your partner. If you both press 0, youget nothing, and so does your partner. But if you press 0 while your partnerpresses 1, you get five dollars, and he gets nothing. The game lasts half anhour. Begin.”Imagine yourself as a player of the game—what would your strategy be? Would youcooperate by pressing 1 all the time, so that you and your partner got the samereward? Or would you sneak in with a 0 while he was innocently pressing 1, sothat you got a much bigger reward? You’d be tempted, but if he got angry enough,he could retaliate by pressing 0 all the time, forcing you to do the same, andthen both of you would wind up with nothing.After the experiment was conducted, subjects were asked about how their hiddenpartners played the game, and many said that their partners were irrational.Even when the subjects pressed 1 many times in a row, for example, signaling awillingness to cooperate, their partners refused. They would sneak in with a 0in order to grab five dollars, while other times they seemed intent on pointlesssabotage. It became necessary to punish them by pressing 0 all the time, butthat didn’t faze them, either.In reality, this wasn’t an experiment about game strategy at all. It was anexperiment in psychological projection, because there were no hidden partners.Each subject played against a random number generator, which spewed out 0s and1s in no particular order. Yet when asked what their partners were like,subjects projected human traits onto them, using words like “devious,”“uncooperative,” “fickle,” “underhanded,” “stupid,” and so on. The human mind,it seems, creates meaning even when none is present.The mind is all about meaning, and machines cannot travel there. Unless you haveBeethoven on hand to input a Tenth Symphony, Shakespeare to input his lost playCardenio, or Picasso to input a style of painting he never expressed on canvas,the machine is helpless to do so. Creative inspiration can’t be reduced towriting code. Artificial intelligence was doomed from the start because“intelligence” was defined as logic and rationality, as if the other aspects ofhuman thought—emotions, preferences, habits, conditioning, doubt, originality,nonsense, etc.—were beside the point. In fact, they are the glories of ourhighly fanciful, perversely delightful intelligence. Meaning has floweredthrough us in all its facets, not just as reason. These include irrationality.Atomic war is an example of such irrational behavior that it makes us shrink interror from our own nature, but the Mona Lisa and Alice in Wonderland are justas irrational, and we gravitate toward them in fascination.Computers are bound by rules and precedents, without which logic machines cannotoperate. Computers don’t say, “When I was daydreaming, something suddenlyoccurred to me.” Yet Einstein did a lot of daydreaming, and the structure ofbenzene was revealed to the chemist Friedrich August Kekulé in a dream.(Somewhat ironically for AI, the German physiologist Otto Loewi, who won theNobel Prize in Medicine in 1936, discovered how nerves transmit signals thanksto a dream he had.) So be grateful for the irrational. The French philosopherPascal was right when he said, “The heart has reasons that reason cannot know.”I imagine that Leonard would agree with most of this. But I also imagine hewould cling to the belief that one day a deeper understanding of the brain—hepoints in the direction of neural networks—will tell us what thinking is. Yet,what if no such solution exists? There may be no simpler model of the brain thanthe brain itself. This doesn’t mean that the mind-brain connection isn’tevolving. Certainly it is. When the mind created reading and writing severalthousand yeats ago, a region of the cerebral cortex adapted and made reading andwriting physically possible. When new forms of modern art are created, peoplescratch their heads at first, just as they did when Einstein’s theory ofrelativity appeared, but in time they catch on, and then for future generationsCubism and relativity become second nature, just as reading and writing are.Once you train your brain to read and write, you cannot go backward and reclaimilliteracy. Those black marks of ink on the page will forever be letters, notrandom specks. Irrevocably, meaning has moved you forward.The spiritual life is entirely about moving meaning forward, and I contend thatscience alone will never be equal to that project. The fact that mind isn’tmatter goes to the heart of my argument, but so does a more technical point,which revolves around a famous mathematical argument known as Gödel’sincompleteness theorems. In order to grasp what those theorems mean in everydaylife, we must look into the nature of logical systems. We are the only creaturesthat love all kinds of nonsense. “ ’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves …” butsense is where we make our home.In our craving for meaning, logic is our primary tool for determining what makessense and what doesn’t. But how can we truly know if we’re right? The laws ofnature make sense because they can be reduced to mathematics, a completelylogical system. That’s why we tell each other that two plus two equals four, notthree or five. But can logic somehow fool itself? If so, then the world may seemto make sense when in reality it doesn’t. (Thousands of years ago, the ancientGreeks were wrestling with this issue and ran into baffling riddles like thefollowing paradox: A philosopher from Crete named Epimenides declares, “AllCretans are liars.” Should you believe him? There’s no way to know. He could betelling the truth, but that means that he’s lying. Self-contradiction is builtinto the sentence.)In simplified form, this is the problem that confronted Kurt Gödel (1906–1978),an Austrian mathematician who joined the wave of illustrious immigrants whoescaped war-torn Europe to live in the United States. Gödel’s area was the logicthat governs numbers. We don’t have to delve into that specialized field, exceptto say that natural numbers (the counting numbers like 1, 2, 3, etc.) areconsidered facts of nature and therefore can stand in for other things we takeas facts. Numbers need to be consistent; when you apply procedures to them, theresults should be provable. The same can be said of facts about the body, suchas heart rate and blood pressure, because they, too, are governed by numbers.The doctor learns what range of numbers is considered normal, and your health ismeasured against that standard.Gödel distilled numbers down to their purest essence, the logical processes thatlead to such things as computers. What Gödel found is that logical systems havebuilt-in flaws. They contain statements that cannot be proven—hence, his notionof incompleteness. His first theorem says that incompleteness is the fate of anylogical system; there will never be a system that explains everything. Hissecond theorem says that if you are looking at a system from the inside, itmight be a consistent system, but you won’t be able to find out as long as youstay inside the system. A blind spot is built in, because certain unprovableassumptions are part of every system. If you want to escape these fatal flaws,you must find a way to step outside the system. Logic cannot transcend itself.Spirituality argues that consciousness can go where logic can’t. There is atranscendent reality, and to reach it, you must experience it. Leonard, who ismathematically sophisticated, may be able to demonstrate how I’ve misconstruedthese highly technical matters. But it’s hard to escape one of Gödel’s mainpoints, that mathematical systems include certain statements that are acceptedas true but which cannot be proven. If I boldly take this out of the realm ofnumbers, Gödel is saying that unprovable things are woven into our explanationof reality. Religionists make statements based on the assumption that Godexists, although they can’t prove it. Materialists make statements based on theassumption that consciousness can be ignored, which they, too, cannot prove. Whydo we keep living with these unprovable X factors? Several answers come to mind.1. Faith: We believe in certain things and that’s good enough.2. Necessity: We have to make sense of the world, even if there are glitchesalong the way.3. Habit: The unprovable assumptions haven’t bothered anybody so far, andtherefore we’ve gotten into the habit of forgetting them.4. Conformity: The system may be flawed, but everybody else uses it, so I will,too. I want to belong.Lump all of these reasons together, and lesser mortals—even lesser mortalstrained in science—find it easy to defend systems that have flaws they don’twant to admit to. But it’s not just the Achilles’ heel in logic that plagues us.We are trapped by the implications of Gödel’s second theorem, which holds that alogical system cannot reveal its inconsistencies; blindness is built in. I knowthat I am humanizing mathematics, which marks me as a total outsider, butsystems engulf us at every turn—systems of politics, religion, morality, gender,economics, and above all, materialism. It’s vital to know that you have beenconditioned to accept these systems without regard for their unprovableassumptions. (Note that unprovable isn’t the same as wrong. I can’t prove thatmy mother loved me, but it’s still true.)Several times Leonard has asserted that we can’t long for childish things likeGod, the afterlife, or the soul, and then expect them to be true. I don’t thinkspirituality came about from wishful thinking. It came about because the world’ssages, saints, and seers managed to escape the limitations of the logical systemthat Leonard has put so much faith in.Gödel’s insights can be extended to show us that logic machines can’t makecreative leaps, because any system that can’t reveal its internal flaws willalways be confined within the prison of its logic. Think of a computer that candetect a million shades of red. If you ask it which one is the nicest, it hasnothing to say. “Nice” is outside its logic. Fortunately, Nature refuses to beimprisoned by logic, and we humans have taken our cue from that. When Picassoinvented Cubism, when Tolstoy imagined Anna Karenina jumping in front of thetrain, when Keats wrote the final draft of “Ode to a Nightingale” in a frenziedfew minutes, turning a promising poem into a masterpiece, creativity made leapsthat were not based on mixing and matching the ingredients of what came before.Logic didn’t come into it.Leonard mentions Deep Blue, the chess-playing computer. On May 11, 1997, DeepBlue won a six-game match against the world chess champion, Garry Kasparov. Thisvictory took ten years to achieve, growing out of a student project at CarnegieMellon University. It was an anguishing emotional loss for Kasparov (we know thecomputer felt nothing about winning), who had defeated Deep Blue just the yearbefore. But I’d like to turn this feat on its head. Deep Blue is a perfectexample of a self-contained logical system that cannot escape its basicassumptions.The machine knew nothing outside number crunching, and therefore it didn’t knowhow to play chess at all. It only knew how to shuffle, at lightning speed, thehuman knowledge it was fed. Chess grandmasters display a lovely arrogance aboutwhat they do. Alexander Alekhine, a legendary Russian champion, was asked byawestruck admirers how many moves ahead he could look in a game. He repliedcoolly, “I can only see ahead one move, the right move.” Chess playing isintuitive. It involves grasping the whole board, reading your opponent, takingrisks, and so on. Grandmasters don’t memorize thousands of games by rote to getwhere they are. They learn from thousands of games, which is entirely different.The mind is training the brain, which in turn gives the mind a higher platformto stand on, and thus the process continues, mind and brain evolving together.All that Deep Blue could do was to suck up this knowledge and spit it back out.Finally, one branch of AI is devising artificial hands to replace hands lost inbattle; countless disabled veterans and other amputees will benefit if theproject succeeds. Figuring out the complex signals sent to and from a human handis incredibly difficult. Could a prosthetic hand one day mold a beautifulsculpture like the Venus de Milo? Could it ever feel the cool hard surface ofthe marble? To oppose such altruistic work seems wrong, and critics of AI areroutinely treated as enemies of progress. But we have to consider the work of aneuroscientist at the Salk Institute in San Diego, Vilayanur Ramachandran, andhis amazing work with amputees.After an amputation, many patients experience phantom limbs. They continue tofeel that the lost hand or arm is still there, and phantom limbs can beexcruciatingly painful, often due to the sensation that the muscles arepermanently clenched. Professor Ramachandran knew that drugs often do little forthis pain, even strong doses of powerful painkillers. Pondering the problem, hemade a creative leap. He took a patient whose right arm had been amputated andsat him in front of a box that had a mirror inside dividing the box in two. Whenthe patient’s left arm was placed in the box, he was asked to peer inside. Whathe saw were two arms, the right one being simply a reflection. But to the nakedeye, the mirror image looked real.The patient was then asked to clench and unclench both hands, the real and thephantom one. To the astonishment of everyone, this simple action could bringrelief, sometimes instantaneously, to acute, intractable pain. The brain wasfooled by the sight of a “real” right arm, and Ramachandran suggests that thearea of the brain that received input from the limbs (the somatosensory cortex)had become cross-wired—it was mapping the lost arm by adapting other nearbyregions reserved for the feet and face. Showing it the image of a right arminside the mirror box enabled the brain to remap it, and thus unclenching thephantom muscles became possible. (A curious sidelight to Ramachandran’s theorythat the brain had become cross-wired is that sometimes the feelings from theamputated arm were transferred to the area that received sensations from theface. Thus, stroking a patient’s face made him report that he felt the strokingon his lost arm.)This could happen only because the mind, being different from the brain, figuredout how to trick the brain and its pain signals. Ramachandran’s methods arebeing tested in veterans’ hospitals. Not all amputees benefit fully, and theamount of time spent in the mirror box varies, but the key thing was to provethat sudden change is possible. Neuroplasticity, the ability of old pathways toturn into new ones, took on new prestige.I want to go a step further. If we could discover what’s inside the mind, a doorwould open to higher intelligence. The trick—and it’s the trick of all time—isthat the mind can be explored only by the mind. Every person knows how to lookinside. We reflect, we second-guess, we try to make sense of our own motives. (Afew familiar examples: “Why did I say something so stupid?” “I don’t know how Iknew, I just knew.” “What made me eat the whole thing?”) Knowing your mind isn’teasy. The difference between a spiritual life and every other life comes down tothis. In spirituality, you find out what the mind really is. Consciousnessexplores itself, and far from reaching a dead end, the mystery unravels. Thenand only then does wisdom blossom. The kingdom of God is within, I am the wayand the life, Love thy neighbor as thyself—these are not objective statements offact. They cannot be deduced through computation. The mind has looked deeplyinto itself and discovered its source, which is transcendent.Speaking of the presence of God, Hebrews 11:3 says, “What is seen was not madeout of what is visible.” If you want, you can match that statement with quantumphysics, but in the end, it comes from something else, the ability of the mindto know itself. That, too, is an unprovable assumption, but what saves us isthat this particular assumption is true.dy>"},{"pageContent":"15"},{"pageContent":"[../images/00009.jpeg]IS THE UNIVERSE THINKING THROUGH US?"},{"pageContent":"[../images/00010.jpeg]DEEPAKOne of the most admired organizations in the world is Doctors Without Borders,whose courageous members travel to the world’s trouble spots bringing healing.It would be inspiring if disputed borders gradually dissolved around the globe,but the most embattled borders are mental, and they are the ones that need todissolve first. Everyone, even the most open-minded among us, is trapped behindsuch borders.Let’s say you are reading this chapter sitting outside under a tree on a sunnyday. You lean back against its rough, cool bark to think. In order to have suchthoughts you need red blood cells coursing through your bloodstream; that’s howthe brain gets the energy it needs to think. You also need the sun, withoutwhich life couldn’t exist on Earth. You need the tree, because withoutphotosynthesis, animals that breathe oxygen would never have appeared. Doesn’tthis mean that the tree and the sun are as much you as your blood? Theboundaries that we’ve set up between mind, body, and the natural world areconvenient, of course, and living within boundaries becomes second nature as weall learn to define ourselves as mothers, fathers, children, spouses, or singleswhen we get home. Yet the cosmos forgot to specialize, so it delivers realityall at once, in a huge messy package.This fact can be overwhelming (which often drives people back to the comfort oftheir familiar pigeonholes). It implies that the universe—all of it, not justour cozy corner—is working through each of us. In order for you to take yournext breath, the entire universe had to collaborate—you are the growing tip ofthe cosmos, the fresh spark of life being pushed forward by all that exists, theway the tip of a green needle on a Pacific sequoia is being pushed by the wholeforest and ultimately the entire Earth.Summon the courage to see yourself this way. Put aside any limited definition ofwho you are, and be without borders for a moment. I propose that it’s not justthe physical universe that is acting through you. When you pierce the mask ofmatter, you realize that the universe is also loving through you, creatingthrough you, and evolving through you. Such a truth is very personal. To acceptthe spiritual life at all, this truth must be real for you, for it is theconnection to a higher reality. Science sees human beings as isolated specks inthe cosmos, accidental outcroppings of mind in a mindless creation. Yet mind isthe connection that makes spirituality real. As the universe acts through you,it wraps you in the cosmic mind.How do you know that you even have a mind? Without taking a philosophy course,most people intuitively accept René Descartes’s maxim, “I think; therefore, Iam.” But they wouldn’t say the same about a tree, a cloud, a neutron, or agalaxy. Borders are stubborn; walls are thick. What we need is a more unboundeddefinition of mind that embraces everything.In his intriguing book Mindsight, Dr. Daniel Siegel, a deeply inquisitivepsychiatrist from UCLA, provides just such a definition, and he has gone to thetrouble of testing it out. At first he tried to define mind by asking variouscolleagues (all of them presumably had a mind), but no one could give him asatisfactory answer. Siegel was particularly interested in qualities of mindthat could not be ascribed to the brain, and he found one: the mind’s ability toobserve. How we are able to observe the world is one of the greatest of allmysteries. If you try to claim that the brain is the same as the mind, you mustanswer a simple question: none of the ingredients in a brain cell—proteins,potassium, sodium, or water—can observe, but you can; so how did these objectsacquire that capacity?Let’s have a writer explore the mystery in eloquent fashion: “I am a camera withits shutter open, quite passive, recording, not thinking. Recording the manshaving at the window opposite and the woman in the kimono washing her hair.Someday, all this will have to be developed, carefully printed, fixed.” Thesetting is Nazi Germany. The speaker is the nameless narrator in ChristopherIsherwood’s haunting short novel Goodbye to Berlin, whose characters wouldbecome famous in the movie musical Cabaret. The speaker stands in for Isherwoodhimself, who wanted to keep truth alive by becoming an objective observer ofhistory as Hitler plunged Europe into the horrors of a second world war. Butcertain facts work against Isherwood: the eye isn’t a camera. The brain has nophotographic images inside it. Perception is a function of consciousness, so themind comes first, before any physical apparatus—eyes, ears, or brain. That’s whyIsherwood says “I” am a camera.Clearly Leonard’s basic allegiance lies with fixed mechanisms. He offerseye-catching optical illusions to prove that some things are seen the same wayautomatically, no matter how hard you try to see them a different way. To me,optical illusions prove exactly the opposite. Here’s a classic example:What do you see in this picture—a white vase standing in the middle of theimage, or two faces in black silhouette looking at each other? Both arepossible, and the whole point is that you can decide which one you want to see.You can switch from one to the other at will. As with every aspect of being anobserver, the process is mental.[../images/00014.jpeg]If perception came down to a physical mechanism, a camera, there would be nochoice involved. The brain would take a snapshot, develop the image, and printit out. In fact, the brain does none of those things. It is set up solely torepresent the mind, which sees, interprets, picks out details, chooses differentviewpoints, etc. Presented with an optical illusion, your mind has the abilityto see from at least two different points of view. For a second example, stareat the X in the diagram below.[../images/00015.jpeg]If you see the X as close to you, then it is on the front of the box. If you seethe X as far from you, it is on the back of the box. You are the one making thischoice; your brain isn’t making it for you. Leonard’s optical illusions wereselected to force you to see in a fixed way. But that’s because the brain is afallible organ. For example, the visual cortex has a specific region devoted torecognizing faces, but it cannot recognize faces that are upside down. Try thisyourself. Take a photo of a famous movie star and present it to a friend butturned upside down. Your friend won’t be able to see that the photo is ofElizabeth Taylor or Robert Redford. However, the mind knows how to overcome thisfallibility. It can look for clues, even in an upside-down photo—for example,spotting Bob Dylan’s distinctive frowzy hair or Captain Hook’s eye patch. Thenit becomes possible to override, at least partially, the limitations of aphysical organ.The brain can limit the mind, of course. If you should happen to have a blindingmigraine or a brain tumor, you might not be able to see images at all. Certainlyyour visual cortex isn’t set up to register ultraviolet or infrared light, asbees and snakes can. So physical limitations do count. They just don’t provideproof of what the mind can and can’t do.Getting back to Daniel Siegel and his quest for a definition of mind, he made agood choice in settling on our ability to observe, and in particular on themind’s ability to observe itself. It’s impossible to imagine a computer that canmeditate and, by doing nothing else, arrive at insights and breakthroughs, muchless change its wiring—but we can do both. Siegel eventually devised his owndefinition of mind, and having presented it to scientific audiences since 1993,he has met with no objection. The mind, he says, is an “embodied and relationalprocess that regulates the flow of energy and information.” That’s a mouthful,but what makes Siegel’s definition watertight is that not a single term can beomitted. Let’s break it down one word at a time.“Embodied”: The mind makes itself known through an organ of the body, the brain.“Relational”: Our minds reflect the environment around us. We are constantlybeing shaped by the people around us, responding to their habits, speech,gestures, and facial expressions.“Process”: Mind is an activity. It isn’t static but dynamic.“Regulate”: The jumble of data that the universe produces would be chaoticunless something organized it into a coherent reality. To keep reality intact,each part must be regulated with every other part.“Flow”: There is an uninterrupted stream of consciousness to parallel theuninterrupted stream of external events.“Energy”: To keep the flow going takes energy, at all levels from the immensityof the Big Bang to the micro level of ions passing through the cell membrane ofa neuron.“Information”: Every piece of data can be seen as information, containing a bitof meaning.What’s so apt about these terms is that you can apply them to every aspect ofNature. As proud as we are of being human, mind is present in an amoeba, amouse, a neuron, and a distant galaxy. Information and energy flow everywhere;they must be processed and distributed; their activity forms a tight web thatconnects everything in existence. As a universal definition of mind, this one ishard to improve upon.Now we have a basis for asking if the universe is thinking through us, or to bemore personal, through you. The answer is yes. It’s such a simple answer that inmy experience almost nobody resists it. In front of audiences I begin bypointing out that solid objects are deceptive. In reality, everything in theuniverse is a process with a beginning, a middle, and an end. “Photon” and“electron” aren’t nouns, as far as Nature is concerned; they are verbs. Next Iask the audience to look at themselves.Are you, too, a process in the universe, with a beginning, a middle, and an end?They nod yes.Is your brain part of the process? Yes.Is the electromagnetic storm in your brain giving rise to thoughts? Yes again,and we are almost there.Then is the universe thinking through you? Most people have no trouble answeringyes. If the universe can light up the sky with jagged arcs of lightning on ahumid summer night, it can set up the lightning storms that appear on brainscans. In the present chapter all I’ve done is to define “thinking” as a processof mind rather than of brain, and most people don’t object to this, either."},{"pageContent":"[../images/00010.jpeg]LEONARDI grew up in an observant Jewish family, so I was surprised one day when mymother told me that she didn’t believe in God. I asked her to explain, and shesaid that she used to believe, but she couldn’t reconcile God with herexperience of losing her family in the Holocaust. On bad days, I remember that Iknow what she means.It was years ago, and I had just dropped my son Nicolai off for his fourth dayof kindergarten. I stopped on my way to the subway to speak to another parent. Iheard an odd sound and looked up the street to see a jumbo jet heading my way,but flying so low it felt eerie. A second or two later it passed overhead,seemed to bank slightly, and quietly penetrated the ninety-fifth floor of thenorth tower of the World Trade Center a short distance away. Almost immediatelythe upper floors spewed fire. The thunder of the crash came a half second later,as it would have if lightning had hit. The street broke into chaos, and the airfilled with screams, and a rain of fiery debris. What haunts me most is thethought of the ninety-two people I saw obliterated in that moment—my involuntaryfeeling of connection with those people I never knew, but whose last momentsstaring out their windows in terror I can’t stop imagining. Nicolai, hisfive-year-old face apparently pressed against the large picture window in hisnearby classroom, saw it all, too, including those who leaped from the roof toavoid being incinerated.Deepak wrote that we humans are “the growing tip of the cosmos, the fresh sparkof life being pushed forward by all that exists,” and that the universe isloving through us, creating through us. He says that “to accept the spirituallife at all,” that truth must be real for us. In taking the point of view ofscience, and rejecting Deepak’s version of spirituality, I sometimes find myselffeeling like the haggard and unshaven Humphrey Bogart sending away beautifulIngrid Bergman at the end of Casablanca, offering up my cold, calculatedassessment that the problems of us little people—and our feelings—don’t amountto a hill of beans in this crazy universe. But if Deepak is right about auniversal consciousness, and that the universe is loving through us, then itmust also be hating through us, murdering and destroying through us, doing allthe things that humans do in addition to loving, including the acts that blew upmy mother’s faith in God. Deepak avoids talking about this dark side, but if theuniverse is working through each of us, then this universal connection must be adouble-edged sword.Though I believe in neither the God of the Bible nor the immaterial world Deepakadvocates, I don’t agree with him that to embrace the scientific view is to turnmy back on spirituality. The great physicist Richard Feynman lost his childhoodsweetheart, and the “great love” of his life, to tuberculosis when they were intheir twenties, just a couple years after they had married. He once told me thathe was not angry about it, because “you can’t get angry at a bacteria.” Howrational and scientific, I remember thinking. But I later learned that he alsowrote a letter to her—more than a year after her death:D’Arline,I adore you, sweetheart.… It is such a terribly long time since I last wrote toyou—almost two years but I know you’ll excuse me because you understand how Iam, stubborn and realistic; and I thought there was no sense to writing. But nowI know my darling wife that it is right to do what I have delayed in doing, andwhat I have done so much in the past. I want to tell you I love you.I find it hard to understand in my mind what it means to love you after you aredead—but I still want to comfort and take care of you—and I want you to love meand care for me.…Richard Feynman was not only one of the greatest physicists in history, he wasalso famous among physicists for his passionate insistence that all theories beclosely connected to experimental observations. Feynman felt lucky to have methis soul mate, even though he knew that what they felt for each other could betraced to physical processes, just as her death could be traced to a bacterium.And even though he knew she wasn’t really there with him, he felt Arline’sspirit through all the ensuing decades, until the day he himself died. That loveis a mental phenomenon governed by the laws of nature he studied didn’t diminishthe depth of Feynman’s feelings, or make him any less spiritual in his approachto life; and that he didn’t really know what it meant to love Arline, or wanther to love him, after her death, didn’t cause him to deny that love. He knewthat the effort to understand the mysteries of nature, of our mind and ourexistence, would never bring him in conflict with what he felt in his heart.Indeed, penetrating those mysteries is one of the ultimate triumphs of all thequalities that make us human.As Deepak says, science draws borders; scientists believe it does that for goodreason—to exclude from our worldview that which is not true. But there is plentyof room within those borders for emotion, and meaning, and spirituality. Ascientific and a spiritual life can exist side by side.Is the universe thinking through us? Even in our speculations, we scientists arecareful. We want to see our ideas quoted in journals like Physical Review andNature, not the Encyclopedia of the Wrong. As often happens when questions areposed in words rather than in precise mathematics, the scientific answer dependson the definition of terms. In chapter 14 [part0025_split_000.html], I describedthe computational theory of mind. If by “thinking” one means, as some do,computing, then yes, the universe is thinking, because all objects followmathematical laws and hence their behavior embodies the results of thecomputation dictated by those laws. Physicist Seth Lloyd wrote, “The universe isa quantum computer,” and we are all part of it. In that sense I could agree withDeepak that we are all part of a universal mind, and that the universe isthinking through us.But when Deepak argues that the universe thinks through us, he means more thanthat. He sees us all as connected through a universal consciousness imbued withwonderful qualities such as love, and presumably also its opposite, hate.Embedded within this consciousness, somehow, are our immaterial minds, whichexpress themselves through and also control our physical brains. As evidence ofthat view, he offers the faces/vase image below.[../images/00016.jpeg]He says your ability to choose whether to see the two faces in black silhouetteor the white vase is evidence that the mind is not a physical mechanism, for aphysical mechanism can only “take a snapshot, develop the image, and print itout.” He says that the nonphysical mind, in contrast, “interprets, picks outdetails, chooses different viewpoints, etc.” But Deepak is wrong about yourdegree of control in the vase/faces illusion. You cannot choose to see eitherthe vase or the faces. There is no immaterial mind that can overcome thestructure of the physical brain.Try it. If you keep looking long enough, you’ll find that—whichever object youchoose to focus on—your brain overrules your choice and flips a visual switch,so that now you see the other object. For example, if you focus on the vase, youcannot indefinitely make your mind consider the space around it as dead space,and not interpret it as two faces. Some people with mood disorders have verylong switch periods, minutes compared to seconds, but everyone switches(researchers haven’t relied on people’s self-reports to know this; people’sswitching can be measured using external instruments).Your visual experience when you look at a “bistable” image like this depends onmany factors, such as conscious effort, prior exposure to the image, and itsparticulars, such as shading, but it also depends on limitations imposed by yourphysical brain. For example, scientists who studied people as they observed thisimage found that when subjects are experiencing the faces, but not the vase, apart of the temporal lobe that specializes in face recognition—the specializedregion Deepak mentioned—is active. That area, called the fusiform face area,relies on the face being in a normal orientation, and as Deepak said, itsefficacy is greatly diminished if you see a face that is, say, upside down. Flipa face over, and the hypothesized immaterial mind should not be fooled, but thephysical brain will behave differently. So here is a test: look at the invertedfaces/vase image below. Since your brain is in charge, you’ll find the faceimages less conspicuous than before, but you will still switch perspectives.[../images/00017.jpeg]In Deepak’s other example he says that if you look at the X in the cube below,you are making the choice of whether to see it at the front or the back of thebox. I disagree. So let’s consider a simpler challenge. Armed with the consciousknowledge that the image below is not really a cube, but just some lines on aflat page, command your immaterial mind to take over from your physical brain.Try to perceive what you know are just meaningless lines on a page as nothingmore than that. Can you look at the diagram below and not see a cube? If, asDeepak says, your brain is the mere servant of your mind, a camera or instrumentyour mind uses, while you—your mind—are really making the choice, you should beable to look at the diagram and not perceive a cube. But you can’t.[../images/00018.jpeg]Deepak employs such examples when he thinks they support his argument anddismisses them when they don’t, saying they arise because the mind is expressedthrough “a fallible organ.” But that is just the point: scientists have beenable to show that every aspect of human thought and behavior that has ever beenstudied is expressed through that fallible physical organ.Everywhere we look we see evidence that the mind is a phenomenon of the brain.Daniel Siegel, a professor of psychiatry at UCLA, whose book Mindsight Deepaktries to use as evidence to the contrary, opens the book with a story that veryclearly illustrates the physical basis of what we call “mind.” It concerns afamily in which the mother, a previously warm and loving presence, was in anautomobile accident that severely damaged a part of the prefrontal cortex thatis involved in “creating empathy, insight, moral awareness, and intuition.” Theresult: a person who, while sane and rational and reasonably functional, felt noemotional connection to her family. As she herself described the difference sheexperienced in her new way of being: “I suppose I’d say that I’ve lost my soul.”Siegel was brought in to work with the family, for the children were very badlyaffected by the change in their mother’s behavior toward them. He showed thefamily a scan of Barbara’s brain and where it had been damaged, so that theywould understand that “her brain was broken,” as one of the childrensubsequently put it. But the other child, not satisfied with this explanation,said, “I thought love came from the heart.” Siegel answered that she was right,and that the networks of cells around the heart and throughout the bodycommunicate directly with the social part of our brain and “send that heartfeltsense right up to our middle prefrontal areas.” But since that was the part ofBarbara’s brain that was damaged, it could no longer receive the signals. Overtime, the family began to heal, but Barbara never did. Siegel wrote that the“damage to the front of her brain had been too severe, and she showed no signsof regaining her connected way of being.” Her brain was broken, so her mind was,too.The famous twentieth-century philosopher Bertrand Russell was once asked what hewould say if he died and God confronted him, demanding to know why Russell hadbeen an atheist. Russell famously said he would reply that it was God’s fault.“Not enough evidence, God! Not enough evidence,” he would say.Deepak portrays the scientific insistence on data as cold and impersonal. Iwould be dishonest to dispute it when he says science sees human beings as“isolated specks in the cosmos, accidental outcroppings of mind in a mindlesscreation.” There is much in humanity to be thankful for, but to deny that we areisolated specks in the cosmos is to avoid the truth rather than embracing it.Deepak said it takes courage to see ourselves as he suggests we should, but hepaints a rosy picture, one that, as in the quote above, he likes to contrastwith the worldview of science. What takes real bravery is to embrace the realitywe actually observe, without regard to whether it is a bleak or a rosy picture.To grow old, to see friends die and planes crash, and to experience love andloss without the comforting illusion of a living, thinking universe imbued witha divine essence is what takes courage.At the same time, I do choose a less bleak outlook. To me, though humans mightbe isolated specks with accidental outcroppings of mind, what is important isthat we do have minds, we do have emotions, and we do have the capacity toexperience art and beauty and joy. We are made according to chemistry andphysics, but we are not “just” chemistry and physics. We are more than the sumof our components, and more than just alive. We are uncaring atoms and moleculesthat have banded together to care for one another, to feel love—andunfortunately also hate, as well as many other emotions, some exalted, some not.I feel connected. Tiny speck in the vast cosmos that I am, I feel a kinship withall the other tiny specks, and grateful for my brief moment of existence as aphysical phenomenon, connected with all the other phenomena in nature. I am gladto be even a small part of an unthinking but wonderful and ever-changinguniverse.dy>"},{"pageContent":"PART FIVE[../images/00009.jpeg]GODdy>"},{"pageContent":"16"},{"pageContent":"[../images/00009.jpeg]IS GOD AN ILLUSION?"},{"pageContent":"[../images/00010.jpeg]DEEPAKThere is no escaping the fact that the world isn’t what it seems. Among thegreat quantum pioneers, I’ve mentioned Niels Bohr, who declared that what weaccept as real is based on the unreal. In his Nobel Prize speech of 1932, WernerHeisenberg concluded that the atom “has no immediate and direct physicalproperties at all.” The universe was doing a vanishing act at that time, and itcertainly hasn’t become more solid since. Mystery and wonder don’t need thepermission of science to exist, but in this case they got it.That still leaves us far from God the benign creator, but spirituality isn’tabout defending the patriarchal God of convention. It’s about a shift inconsciousness. The famous Indian spiritual teacher J. Krishnamurti was speakingone afternoon against the backdrop of the Swiss Alps. Krishnamurti insisted onrigorous debate with his audiences—one of his main doctrines was that no oneshould blindly follow a guru or self-professed holy man—and on this occasion theexchange stalled out. People seemed baffled by the shift in consciousness thatKrishnamurti wanted them to achieve.Instead of going deeper, he turned toward a hazy peak in the distance. “If forone moment you could actually see that mountain,” he murmured, “you wouldcompletely understand. Reality has been hidden from you, yet it is everywherewaiting to be noticed.”Unless you perceive things in a new way, spiritual teachings are a fiction. Buthow do those of us with normal perception arrive at such a state? How can weactually see the mountain? First, we need to realize what “normal” seeingactually means. In our everyday waking state we are:1. Overshadowed by bodily sensations, information from our five senses, and pastconditioning2. Bound by the brain and its physical limitations3. Dulled into following well-worn channels of perception, seeing the worldtoday just as we saw it yesterday4. Doubtful of our true purpose and destination5. Haunted by fears and hidden memories from the past6. Blind to what lies beyond the boundary that separates life and deathSeeing, it turns out, has problems. Happily, there are ways to escape theselimitations of everyday consciousness. The world’s religious scriptures arebased on such journeys from the “normal” to the extraordinary, but so areinspired music, art, and poetry, not to mention the sudden spiritual experiencesthat life can bring to almost anyone. (Over half of people responding to aGallup poll report that at least once in their lives they have seen light aroundanother person, gone into the light themselves, felt the presence of thedeparted, or seen auras.) But science won’t be satisfied until such experiencescan be replicated, and whenever people “go into the light,” a broad term forentering a higher state of consciousness, one thing is usually lacking: a way torepeat their journey afterward.The spiritual life fills this void. It provides a path to higher consciousnessthat is universal. Let me try to offer a reliable map to such a journey, becausethis is one area where validation has taken place many thousands of times overthe centuries.Stage 1: The opening. We have a powerful personal experience that lifts us outof everyday consciousness. This can be a sudden insight that changes lifeforever or a taste of unity consciousness, or it can be something as simple asknowing that you are safe, or that everything in your life has a reason and apurpose.Stage 2: Revising the meaning of life. Either slowly or all at once, we realizethat material life is not what it seems on the surface. There is a higherpurpose, which implies a mind or a consciousness, that is greater than theindividual mind.Stage 3: Becoming part of the plan. If higher reality begins to make more sensethan everyday life, we begin to find ways to be transformed. Our desire to liveon a different plane grows.Stage 4: Walking the path. With a vision in mind, now we make the process ofreaching higher reality a serious undertaking. The goal is God or higherconsciousness, and a way must be found to get there.Stage 5: Illumination. Higher consciousness becomes a living reality. The shiftis complete. We know no other way to see the world than as an aspect of thedivine. Indeed, sacred and nonsacred no longer have separate meanings. There isonly the light of consciousness everywhere we look.I believe you can take any deeply meaningful life and find that it fits thistemplate, without regard to religion. In fact, one of the greatest failings ofreligion is the claim that it has patented the way to God. In the West we sorelylack a nonreligious model for becoming illuminated, but we’re getting there.Ironically, we can thank science for forcing us to drop preconceived notions andrely on hard evidence. Reason tells us that the Buddha, Saint Paul, Bernadetteof Lourdes, and Sri Ramakrishna underwent a common experience, and likescientists sorting out how an apple and a rose are linked to the same genus, wecan fit unique examples of spiritual awakening into the same template.Thoreau writes about “the solitary hired man on a farm in the outskirts ofConcord, who has had his second birth” and who muses that his “peculiarreligious experience” might not be true. This leads to a passage in Walden thathas haunted me for decades, ever since I first read it:Zoroaster, thousands of years ago, travelled the same road and had the sameexperience, but he, being wise, knew it to be universal, and treated hisneighbors accordingly, and is even said to have invented and established worshipamong men.We may smile at the naïveté of dating religion to one seer in ancient Persia andhis “peculiar religious experience.” Zoroaster, who was born somewhere betweenthe eighth and tenth centuries BCE, was a relative late-comer compared to theVedic seers of India. But I share Thoreau’s essential point, as well as what headvises the hired man on the farm outside Concord to do:Let him humbly commune with Zoroaster then, and, through the liberalizinginfluence of all the worthies, with Jesus Christ himself, and let “our church”go by the board.In contemporary language this means that the person who has had a suddenawakening should see himself or herself in the great tradition of awakening. Thesecond reference, to putting the church aside, has already occurred on a largescale.Your life and your mind sit somewhere on the continuum of awakening, even if wehave turned our backs on religion en masse. The conscious process of coming toterms with higher reality is personal, spontaneous, and never on schedule.Countless people have revised their view of material life and decided to walkthe spiritual path—but then they stop. Sadly, as long as divinity means the Godof organized religion, the spiritual path has little chance of going mainstream.Faiths promote their own agendas. They want followers who pose no doubts. Theyinsist that their dogmas were handed down by God, even when history reveals thatthey were devised by powerful clerics. So many agendas work against finding thedivine that the situation has given rise to a cynical joke: God handed down thetruth, and the Devil said, “Let me organize it.”Yet the spiritual path exists, and can be followed. Once you stop seeking thetraditional God, a different goal takes its place: transcendence. To transcendmeans to go beyond. The process should be regarded as natural; in fact, wetranscend all the time. When a three-year-old throws a tantrum until it gets itsway, the mother doesn’t sink to the level of childish demands. She knows thatsomething else is at work: her child is tired or upset or anxious. Shetranscends the context created by the tantrum and goes to a different level ofexperience. The Buddha and Jesus did much the same thing. In the context of asuffering, bewildered humanity, they didn’t recommend pleasure as a replacementfor pain. They pointed to solutions that went beyond the level of the problem.Without transcendence, our experience of suffering will never change.Pioneering American psychologist William James reduced the mystery of findingGod to a simple statement: “All around us lie infinite worlds, separated only bythe thinnest veils.” The secret is that these veils are made of consciousnessthat is blocked and constricted, while the other worlds are made ofconsciousness that is expanded and free. The spiritual path is about removingthe veils over your own awareness, which requires dedication. What makes theeffort worthwhile is knowing that awareness can grow at any moment.A simple parable comes to mind. In a remote town lived a gifted sculptor. Hiswork decorated the town’s streets and parks, and everyone agreed that it wasextraordinarily beautiful. But the artist was reclusive and remained out ofsight. One day a visitor arrived and so admired the statues that he insisted onmeeting the sculptor, but no one could tell him how to find the artist hesought. In fact, it turned out that none of the townspeople had actually methim; the sculpture had just appeared, as if on its own.Then an old man stepped forward and said that he had been fortunate enough tomeet the elusive sculptor.“How did you manage that?” the visitor asked.The old man replied, “I stood before these wonderful works of art and keptadmiring them. The more I gazed, the more I saw. There was intricacy andsubtlety beyond anything I had ever observed before. I couldn’t stop marveling.Somehow the sculptor must have become aware of my rapture, for, to myastonishment, he appeared by my side.“I said, ‘Why did you pick me to show yourself to, when no one else has foundyou, no matter how hard they searched?’“He said, ‘No creator can resist appearing when his work is loved as intenselyas you love mine.’ ”In this little tale we can see the only article of faith that is necessary. Ifyou go deeply enough into your own awareness, you will find a place of silenceand peace. In time this place will reveal much more than that, however. Thesource of creation abides there, and the more you experience it, the richer andmore beautiful creation becomes. Beyond suffering lies bliss; transcending takesyou to the domain of light. Go there and find out for yourself, not by seekingGod but by seeking reality.Eventually the artist won’t be able to resist you—your appreciation of what hehas created will draw him to your side. Then the divine will no longer be aprojection or a fantasy. It won’t be a wished-for father or a mother. The propsof wish-fulfillment will no longer be needed once you come face-to-face withyour own inner experience of the divine. You won’t care about such things asworldviews. They are only stepping-stones for the mind. In the end it isirrelevant whether the nameless assumes the face of God or not. Far better isreality itself, seen as clearly as the light of day."},{"pageContent":"[../images/00010.jpeg]LEONARDDecades ago, when I was still walking to school every day carrying a lunch bag,I decided that physical science held the key to the mysteries I wanted tounderstand—both those of the universe around me (what caused the sun to shine,the stars to twinkle above me, the elegant butterfly to look the way it did),and those of my own mind. Over thousands of hours I digested lectures, articles,and books, and over thousands more I explored the cosmos through mathematics.Could I ever understand everything? Or anything? What does it even mean tounderstand?In college my friends and I believed in a hierarchy of truths, like the layersof the Earth’s atmosphere. Mathematics formed the outer and most sacred sphereof the truths—the heavens, the realm of pure ideas. Just below it was thestratosphere, consisting of theoretical physics, the fundamental truths ofeverything palpable. The less rarefied regions beneath were where we located theapplied sciences, thick, turbulent, and polluted with endless facts andintricate details. Philosophy, metaphysics, and theology were hard to place,however. Our attitude toward those subjects varied with the philosopher, withthe particular work we were reading, with our mood, and even with how much wehad been drinking. Baruch Spinoza, the great rationalist philosopher and lensgrinder, for example, wrote a book called Ethics, an unforgivingseventeenth-century critique of traditional religion and morality. It seemedheavenly in its mathematical structure of definitions, axioms, propositions, andproofs, but disappointing in the less-than-mathematically-precise argumentsSpinoza attached to that formal structure. My friends and I found we could feaston his ideas, but afterward be uncertain what we had eaten. So in the end we hadsympathy for Spinoza’s approach, but skepticism about whether he had made aconvincing case for his ideas.The disciplines of science and mathematics were different. We reveled in theirprecision. We celebrated the methodologies they had developed to avoid thepitfalls of human bias and subjectivity. And, knowing both how they reachedtheir conclusions and how open they were to changing those conclusions when theevidence warranted, we felt confident that we could trust what they told us.Though many today debate the validity of “mere scientific theories,” the samepeople depend upon science, in all aspects of their lives, without giving it asecond thought. The power of the scientific method is why advertisers screamthat their detergents have been “scientifically” proven to remove stains, whileno one would spend a dime to advertise that metaphysics proves their mouthwashwill sweeten your breath. Doubters appear on television and radio to deny thereality of evolution or the Big Bang theory, but somehow, when the debate getsreduced to coffee stains on white dress shirts, or how to treat pneumonia, theyfind reality versus illusion easy to sort out, and they side with thescientists.No one, of course, employs the scientific method to sort out truth from illusionregarding their own lives. You might think that the person you married is yourideal partner, but that person would frown on it if you married a dozen othersto gather evidence for your theory. You might think your great talentsguaranteed your professional success, but you won’t restart your career to testthat hypothesis. You might believe in an afterlife, but you’re in no rush toperform the one experiment that could tell you if you are right. We build ourworldviews through experience, intuition, schooling, books, and dialogues withpeople whose ideas we trust and respect. We make decisions about what is trueand what is false, but most of us rarely think about how we come to our beliefs.We assume we’re rational—and therefore correct—and then we rush off to our nextappointment. But there are factors affecting our beliefs that most of us areunaware of. These manifest most visibly when it comes to issues of greatpersonal importance. It is well known amongst psychologists, for example, thatthe burden of proof people ordinarily require varies with the desirability ofwhat is being “proved”—and that it is our subconscious mind that adjusts thedial.There are many examples of this subconscious activity in the scientificliterature. Studies show that it takes an immense body of smoking-gun evidenceto convince us we are nitwits, but to persuade us of our genius or talentrequires only the flimsiest data; that partisans studying research on apolitical issue will view the same methodology as lacking or sound, depending onwhether the conclusion implied conforms to their beliefs; that jurors tend todiscount shoddy evidence of guilt when they have sympathy for a defendant, butjudge it as convincing when they consider the defendant unlikable. In one studyresearchers presented two groups of volunteers with documents adapted from amurder trial in which both the prosecution and the defense presented strongarguments. The documents included parts of the trial transcript, and a newspaperarticle from the time of the trial that was neutral with regard to whether thedefendant had committed the crime. But the two groups were shown slightlydifferent articles. The newspaper article shown to one group quoted neighborsdescribing the defendant as an unpleasant character. When asked whether theythought—based on the trial transcript—that the prosecution had proved thedefendant’s guilt, the subjects who were led to believe the defendant wasunlikable were much more apt to conclude that the prosecution had indeed provedits case.In all these instances, people thought they were being objective, but theirobjectivity was an illusion. In truth, our everyday analyses always depend onprior beliefs and desires. If we want to reach a certain conclusion, our brainswill alter the way we perceive and weigh data and analyze arguments. And—mostimportant—our brains do this beneath our level of awareness. So it is oftenpossible to honestly believe what we wish to believe, even though an objectiveobserver would come to another conclusion. Psychologists sometimes call thismotivated reasoning, which is a force to be reckoned with when examining why wemight choose to believe in a seductive worldview involving universalconsciousness and a loving universe.Consider Deepak’s interpretation of the experience of “going into the light” orof seeing an aura around someone. According to a study in the British medicaljournal The Lancet, about 10 percent of cardiac patients resuscitated fromclinical death report either “out-of-body” or “near-death” experiences. Howshould we interpret them? Deepak associates such experiences with entering a“higher state of consciousness.” That explanation fits neatly into Deepak’sworldview, which, like Buddhism, postulates an immaterial mental realm. But isthat just a desirable way to interpret the event, or is there evidence tosupport that view? Through painstaking effort, and the application of newtechnologies for examining the brain, scientists have been studying such eventsand coming to a very different conclusion. For example, David Comings, aneuroscientist who specializes in altered states of consciousness, has foundthat near-death experiences seem to come when the brain is deprived of oxygenfor prolonged periods of time, immediately prior to brain damage. Out-of-bodyexperiences, too, seem to have a physical basis. That was dramaticallyillustrated recently by the case of a forty-three-year-old woman who reportedfeeling a “lightness,” and said she was floating about two meters above the bed,close to the ceiling, and seeing herself, from above, lying in bed. She wasn’tnear death, but rather had had electrodes implanted in a part of her temporallobe called the right angular gyrus. The electrodes were part of a treatment forsevere epileptic seizures, but they also allowed researchers to probe theeffects of mild electrical stimulation on the brain. As professional skepticMichael Shermer reported in The Believing Brain, researchers found that, byvarying that stimulation, they could not only induce out-of-body experiences,but actually control the height above the bed at which the patient reportedfloating.Richard Dawkins wrote that, when watching a great magic trick, it’s hard not tothink, “It must be a miracle,” even though in that case one knows full well itisn’t. It is even more difficult not to believe in the miraculous when we have avested interest in an interpretation that science contradicts. Exotic and poorlyunderstood phenomena like out-of-body experiences can be a haven of “proof” forideas that have been examined in better-understood contexts, and found lacking.But even if a phenomenon is as yet poorly understood, it is useful to recallthat throughout history, the inexplicable has repeatedly been found, over thelong run, to have a natural explanation. Never, so far, has a scientist beenforced to fill in a gap in understanding with Sidney Harris’s famous cartooncaption “Then a miracle occurred.”We might have good objective reasons for the views we hold so dearly, and wemight not, but either way it is best to be able to assess how convincing theevidence is. This is not always easy. If you ask a friend why she believes inGod, or in a higher presence, she probably won’t say she came to that beliefthrough a series of controlled experiments. More likely, she’ll say she feelsit, or she just knows. Is God merely an illusion perceived by those who arelooking for a divine presence? Science is the best method we know fordiscovering truth about the material universe, but the powers of science are notwithout limit. Science does not address the meaning of life, nor can it, fornow, explain consciousness. And science will never be able to explain why theuniverse follows laws. So while science often casts doubt on spiritual beliefsand doctrine insofar as they make representations about the physical world,science does not—and cannot—conclude that God is an illusion.Since Deepak offers parables, I, too, will offer an illustrative story, this onesymbolic but true. In 1969 Richard Feynman invented a model of hadrons—particleslike the proton and the neutron that interact via a force called the strongforce, which, as its name indicates, is the most potent force in nature. InFeynman’s model, a hadron is like a bag containing partons that move freelyinside it, but are constrained not to leave the bag. Feynman used his partonpicture to explain certain data regarding what happens when hadrons are smashedinto one another at high energy, and it worked well, which is to say itspredictions were confirmed. Yet, since partons must stay within the bag—withinthe hadron—we don’t see partons. Are they real, or just an illusion, mereconstructs in Feynman’s intellectual model? It’s a metaphysical question, andthough Feynman once famously said he “was under doctor’s orders not to discussmetaphysics,” he did address it. He wrote that since partons help us make senseof what is going on, they may be a useful “psychological guide,” and “if theycontinue to serve this way to produce other valid expectations they would ofcourse begin to become ‘real,’ possibly as real as any other theoreticalstructure invented to describe nature.”Useful as these “psychological guides” are in physics, there is no reason not toemploy similar guides in our spiritual life, so long as they help us to makesense of the universe—and are compatible with our observations of it. Manypeople intuitively believe in a higher power, and draw solace, strength, andcourage from that belief. When faith feels real to a person, and when thatparticular belief does not lead to conflict with what we observe in the physicalworld, there is nothing science says to oppose it. If, however, we are asked tobelieve in a God who created the universe a few thousand years ago, and we haveconvincing evidence that the universe is much older than that, then we have aconflict. But the demands of science do not preclude the rewards ofspirituality. In fact, even Albert Einstein, almost superhuman in his clarity ofthought and his ability to reason, exulted in his sense of spiritual connectionto the universe. In his case, it was the very “rationality” of that universethat shaped his spiritual life:Whoever has undergone the intense experience of successful advances made in[science], is moved by profound reverence for the rationality made manifest inexistence. By way of the understanding he achieves a far-reaching emancipationfrom the shackles of personal hopes and desires.… And so it seems to me thatscience … contributes to a religious spiritualization of our understanding oflife.dy>"},{"pageContent":"17"},{"pageContent":"[../images/00009.jpeg]WHAT IS THE FUTURE OF BELIEF?"},{"pageContent":"[../images/00010.jpeg]DEEPAKI equate the future of belief with the future of God. Modern belief in a deityis much diluted, which requires some blunt talk. All too easily discussions ofGod descend into polite murmurs over tea and cookies about matters that have nobearing on the practicalities of everyday life. For countless people, personalbelief is both embarrassing and shaky. I’ve been advocating for the spiritualpath, on the other hand, as something vital and urgent. The future of the planetdepends upon raising our consciousness. Since God is intimately tied into who weare and what life means, there is no separate future for God and for theindividual. You and I will make decisions that determine if God has a viabletomorrow.The main issue is a shift away from God as an external force to God as an innerexperience, from religion to spirituality. We are not talking about a return tomysticism. Modern life rests upon two things: information and personalsatisfaction. There are no concrete facts, however, to support that Jesus Christrose from the dead, that the angel Gabriel dictated the Koran, or that Mosesactually existed. That basically leaves personal satisfaction, and herespirituality finds its entry point.People crave meaning and value in their lives. If an inner experience of God canfulfill this craving, it will supplant the old ways of approaching the divine.An external God sitting above the clouds, as represented in popular religion,faces bleak prospects. Behind every pulpit an invisible clock is ticking,counting off the hours as thousands of people flee from churches and temples. Inalmost every developed country religious attendance has waned to no more than 20percent of the population, and in many places, such as Scandinavia, the figureis less than 10 percent. God is no longer personally satisfying. Religionsemphasizing sin, guilt, and punishment are not likely to attract people who wantto pursue fulfillment without being stigmatized (one example being the CatholicChurch’s condemnation of Eastern meditation as a way to experience the divine,which is viewed as heretical).I am convinced that a shift inward is necessary. We must free ourselves from theburden of religious dogma, but at the same time we can’t give in to materialism.Even when espoused by a voice as sympathetic as Leonard’s, mechanisticdeterminism offers no personal satisfaction, except for a certain grimappreciation of the courage required to face a universe that is cold and void.Spirituality can do better. However, skeptics have a right to ask for specifics,and there are certainly pitfalls that must be avoided.A visitor once came calling on a famous spiritual teacher. He was motioned tosit on the floor in a cool, empty room. Across from him the teacher, dressed inwhite, sat silently while an attendant poured tea. It was difficult for thevisitor to wait; he was obviously agitated.Once the attendant had left, the visitor burst out, saying, “Sir, I hear thatyou are revered and wise. But I have met many others just like you, and frankly,it has taken me a long time to convince myself that I should even tell you myproblem. You are likely to fail me, as everyone else has.”The teacher looked unperturbed. “What is this problem of yours?”The visitor sighed. “I am sixty years old, and ever since childhood I’ve beendrawn toward God. While earning a living and raising a family, I also undertookan intense quest. I’ve prayed, meditated, and gone on retreats. I’ve read everyscripture. I have passed months in the company of so-called holy men.”“And what did your quest reveal? Did you not find God?”The man shook his head mournfully. “I’ve had countless experiences that seemedright. I’ve had visions. I’ve been filled with the light. Every golden bell andBuddha you can imagine has appeared to me. But it has all turned to dust. I feelempty and depressed, abandoned by God. It’s as if I’ve experienced nothing.”“Of course,” the spiritual teacher murmured.The man looked startled. “You mean there is no God?”“I mean that the mind can project whatever you ask it to. If you are looking forgolden Buddhas, they will appear. So will all the gods, or the God. Each pathleads to a goal that is known in advance. But is that really God? God is aboutfreedom. You have ardently pursued all these disciplines, yet you have notarrived at your destination.” Then the teacher smiled enigmatically. “Now let meask you one question: can you discipline yourself to be free?”This exchange, which happens to be true, casts radical doubt upon conventionalpaths to God. But it also points to another way, sometimes called “the pathlesspath.” On the pathless path there is no fixed goal and no prescribed process tofollow. Looking at yourself intimately, from moment to moment, you peel away theunreal aspects of yourself, until only the real is left. Many things are unreal,as viewed by the wisdom traditions of the world. Ignorance is unreal, especiallyignorance about who you really are. The ego and its urgent needs are unreal.Since these needs form the foundation of most people’s lives, you can see thatdeep transformation is called for.Getting there sounds forbidding, I know. Having said farewell to organizedreligion, is it any better to be faced with your own pain and suffering? Cananyone really give up the ego’s endless desires? The saving grace of thespiritual path is that it comes naturally. Although life is full of sufferingand the ego demands to be satisfied, those things are not as substantial as theyseem. If you walk through a garden rank with weeds and withered flowers, theylook real enough. But looks are deceiving—the deeper reality is the garden’srich soil and the renewal of life, which cannot be stopped. In our case, thenurturing soil is the soul, and the renewal of life happens within. You don’thave to tell your body to renew itself; it does so naturally. You don’t have toforce your mind to have new perceptions; billions of bits of sensory data floodthe mind every day. The process of renewal guides life on every level. To me, aviable future for the spirit centers on discovering that the creative andevolutionary impetus in Nature is the same force that resides at the heart ofwho we are.I’ve often thought that everyone would lead a spiritual life if they simplywatched young children closely. Children don’t resist their inner development.It doesn’t frighten them that life may stop at three years old or five or ten;when it’s time to give up paper dolls and learn to read, this new stage emergesspontaneously. How do three-year-olds prepare to be four? They don’t. Each childdoes what he or she does, just allowing whatever comes next to unfold naturally.This is a secret that Nature has mastered—how to allow the new to emerge, not bydestroying the old, but by welling up from the inside, invisibly and silently,until the new has flowered of its own accord.On the pathless path a similar process takes place. New qualities arise in yourawareness, not by warring against your old self but by encouraging naturalgrowth from within. Modern people may be baffled as they look back at the age offaith, but the fact that we live in a different age doesn’t mean that spiritualawakening is invalid. Quite the opposite, in fact. Cleared of the undergrowth ofdogma and superstition, the spiritual path has become much easier to walk. Thebest way to fulfill your aspirations is by waking up, and instead of choosing torenounce the world in God’s name, choosing to embrace it in your own. However,to make such a radical shift possible, we must explore what it means to wake up.The process of waking up centers on transcending, as we’ve discussed. Beyond oureveryday waking state we find a deeper level of inner silence. This is not asearch for peace and quiet; rather, we are transcending the maelstrom ofeveryday thoughts to find the source of the mind. Practically speaking, thereare many levels of transcendence. The most profound is deep meditation, which isknown to alter brain structure and lead to lasting transformation. At theshallow end there is the exhilaration that fans feel at a football game, or thatserious shoppers find when they snap up a bargain. These two poles seem to havenothing in common, but there is a hidden bond. Whenever you experience anyquality of pure consciousness, however fleeting, you have transcended.Pure consciousness isn’t a way of thinking or a point of view. It’s the unseenpotential from which everything springs. The qualities of pure consciousnessseem subtle at first, but they grow more powerful as you proceed farther on yourpath. Here are the chief qualities described in the great wisdom traditions.TEN QUALITIES OF PURE CONSCIOUSNESS1. Pure consciousness is silent and peaceful. When you experience this quality,you are free of inner conflict, anger, and fear.2. Pure consciousness is self-sufficient, or centered within itself. When youexperience this quality, the need for distraction vanishes. You are comfortablesimply being here. The mind is not restless in its quest for stimulation.3. Pure consciousness is fully awake. This quality is experienced as mentalalertness and freshness. The mind is no longer dull or fatigued.4. Pure consciousness contains infinite potential; it is open to any outcome.When you experience this quality, you are no longer bound by fixed habits andbeliefs. The horizon seems open, the future full of possibilities. The greateryour experience of pure potential, the more creative you become.5. Pure consciousness is self-organizing. It effortlessly coordinates allaspects of existence. You are experiencing this quality when things fall intoplace of their own accord. There is less struggle to force different parts oflife to harmonize, because you are more in tune with the natural harmony thatruns through everything.6. Pure consciousness is spontaneous. Timetables, boundaries, and rules don’tapply; nor are they needed. Breaking free of old constraints, whatever they maybe, makes you feel safer about expressing who you are and what you want withoutconstraints. This is the state of absolute freedom, which you experiencewhenever you feel liberated.7. Pure consciousness is dynamic. Although not in motion, it provides energy forall the activity in the universe. You experience this quality when you feel thatyou can fully embrace life. You have the energy and the will to do great things.8. Pure consciousness is blissful. This is the root of happiness and its highestexpression. Any surge of happiness, whatever the cause, is a taste of bliss. Anorgasm is blissful, but so is compassion. Every experience of love can also betraced back to its origins in bliss.9. Pure consciousness is knowing. It contains the answers to all questions and,more crucially, the practical knowledge needed for unfolding the universe, thehuman body, and the mind. Any experience of intuition, insight, or truth tapsinto this quality.10. Pure consciousness is whole. It is all-encompassing. Therefore, despite theinfinite diversity of the physical world, at a deeper level only one process isoccurring: wholeness is moving like a single ocean that holds every wave. Youexperience this quality when your life makes sense and you feel a part ofNature; you are at home simply by being alive.As you can see, I haven’t used any religious terms, yet this is divinity,stripped of the demands of faith and obedience. At this point you cannot beexpected simply to accept that these ten qualities are, in essence, divine.However, you can use this idea as a working hypothesis. In that sense you arethe experimenter and the experiment. If you are transcending everyday reality,these ten qualities will grow in your life. You will notice more fulfillment andcreativity. Your sense of being secure will grow as you come to know who youreally are.Now we can say with certainty what kind of action the spiritual path calls for.You don’t have to brace yourself to become “spiritual” in quotation marks. Theonly requirement is that you measure your activity, inner and outer, by onecriterion: does it develop the qualities of pure consciousness? In spiritualitythere is room for deeply religious people and room for worldly people (includingscientists). Doing good works and being of service aren’t a guarantee that youare transcending, yet they are landmarks on a recognized spiritual path, andcountless seekers do find that service increases their sense of bliss, peace,centeredness, and self-sufficiency. Another recognized path is deepcontemplation; yet another is mindfulness—becoming aware that your thoughts arejust thoughts, coming and going like clouds against the eternal sky ofconsciousness. The spiritual experiment is yours to set up as you wish.I’m not suggesting that you take on a regimen and cling tightly to it.Consciousness does the work for you here, just as genes do the work for anembryo as it develops. The difference is that spiritual growth requires choice.As you come to know what pure consciousness is, you orient your mind toward it.To avoid sounding too mystical, let me share with you a parable from theUpanishads of ancient India.A coachman is driving a team of horses, using his whip to goad them faster andfaster. It’s a sunny day; he feels exhilarated, as if he owns the world. Fromthe inside of the coach a faint voice says, “Stop.” In his excitement thecoachman ignores the voice; he’s not even sure he heard anything. Again the samesoftly spoken command comes from inside the coach: “Stop.”This time the coachman knows that he has heard the command, which makes himangry, so he flogs the horses to race even faster. But the voice from inside thecoach continues to repeat its command, never raising its voice, until thecoachman remembers something. His passenger is the owner of the coach! Thecoachman pulls on the reins, and slowly, slowly the horses come to a halt.In the parable the horses are the five senses and the mind, constantly beingwhipped onward by the ego. The ego feels that it controls everything. But theowner of the coach is the soul, whose soft voice waits patiently to be heard.When it is, the ego relents. It gives up false ownership. The mind slows downits frantic activity, and in time it learns to stop. Stopping isn’t an end untoitself; it’s the basis for knowing who you really are: a soul with all itsdivine attributes. Those attributes are the qualities of pure consciousness.I believe every home should have a nook devoted to divinity—a shrine of roses,or an altar of scented lavender. A shard of crystal would do, or a small bronzeBuddha placed where the sun can warm it. We need daily reminders if the divineis to have a future. Reminders of what? The voice from inside the coach.I won’t cramp the soul by attempting to define it. That’s part of theexperiment, to find out for yourself. But I can’t resist sharing a passage fromthe Bhagavad Gita, written from the soul’s point of view:This entire universe is pervaded by Me, the unmanifest Brahman.All beings depend on Me. I am the origin, the seed of all beings.There is nothing, animate or inanimate, that is not pervaded by Me. I am foundin all of creation. I am inside and outside all that exists.In the end, the spiritual path does one simple thing: it makes those timelesswords come true for you. Belief becomes knowledge that can be trusted, and onthat basis God can once again be revered."},{"pageContent":"[../images/00010.jpeg]LEONARDAuguste Comte, one of the most influential French philosophers of the first halfof the nineteenth century, wrote extensively on the nature of knowledge, what itmeans, and how we obtain it. Alas, Comte chose an unfortunate example toillustrate his philosophy, based on what he considered an infallible scientificfact: “On the subject of stars … we shall not at all be able to determine theirchemical composition or even their density.… I regard any notion concerning thetrue mean temperature of the various stars as forever denied to us.” Justfourteen years later Gustav Kirchhoff and Robert Bunsen discovered that we couldindeed determine the properties of stars by analyzing the light they emit, andtoday we use that method, spectroscopy, to measure chemical abundances,temperatures, density, and many other properties of distant planets, stars, andgalaxies. Some of the astronomical objects we study in this manner are over tenbillion light-years away.According to the dictionary, the difference between knowledge and belief is thatbelief implies confidence, while knowing implies certainty. Though there areissues of consistency, and philosophers may debate the issue, it is possible toachieve certainty of sorts in mathematics—you apply the rules and derive theconsequences, an exercise in pure logic. But in our everyday lives, and even inscience, that distinction between what we “know” and what we merely “believe” isdifficult, or even impossible, to make. We might think that we can distinguishbetween believing we won’t get sick from the raw halibut at our local sushi bar,and knowing that tomorrow the sun will rise in the east. But can we really? Webase what we think we know—the beliefs we feel certain about, or which we atleast don’t question—partly on empirical evidence. We have seen or heard aboutthe sun rising on every other day of our lives, and even before our birth, so we“know” it will rise again tomorrow. In 1812 astronomer and mathematicianPierre-Simon Laplace employed probability theory to examine the degree ofcertainty that is justified in that prediction, based solely on the fact thatthe sun had risen every day for the past five thousand years (the approximateage of the Earth according to biblical accounts). He came up with odds of1,826,214:1 in favor. But empirical evidence is not all we use to form ourbeliefs, and Laplace pointed out that people probably have a much higherconfidence that the sun will rise than his calculation indicates because theyknow that the laws of nature—technically, gravity and celestial mechanics—callfor it to do so. Ironically, today’s theories of physics tell us the sunprobably won’t forever continue to rise or even to exist. As I said earlier, inroughly seven billion years the sun will grow 250 times larger (and 2,700 timesmore luminous) than today, ballooning out to fill the entire sky, and thenprobably swallowing up the Earth. Billions of years later it will burn out andshrink and turn into a kind of stellar corpse called a white dwarf. In a senseall that we say we “know”—except perhaps mathematical truths—is just belief, andso the question of the future of theological belief is tied to how and why webelieve things in ordinary life, and even in science.Bertrand Russell wrote that “believing seems the most mental thing we do.” It isalso one of the most complex and varied things we do. Not only do observation,theoretical understanding, our needs, desires, and biases, our emotions andmood, and our existing framework of beliefs all interact in a complex manner toaffect the way we form beliefs; but we might not even be aware of what ourbeliefs are, because while we may consciously think we believe one thing, on adeeper unconscious level we may believe and sometimes act on the oppositebelief. For example, consider an experiment concerning what psychologists callthe illusion of control, the unconscious belief that we are the masters of ourown fate even when we consciously know we aren’t. In the study, employees at aninsurance agency and a manufacturing company on Long Island who donated $1 foran office lottery were either allowed to choose their own lottery ticket, orelse given one at random by the seller. Then the morning of the drawing thesellers approached each buyer individually and said that someone else “wanted toget into the lottery, but since I’m not selling tickets anymore, he asked me ifI’d find out how much you’d sell your ticket for. It makes no difference to me,but how much should I tell him?” Though it is doubtful that many of the subjectsconsciously believed they had any skill in picking the winner of a randomdrawing, they seemed to believe it nonetheless: those who had been randomlyassigned a lottery ticket agreed to sell it back for an average price of $1.96,while those who had chosen their own ticket demanded on average $8.67. Our innerweighing of evidence is not a careful mathematical calculation resulting in aprobabilistic estimate of truth, but more like a whirlpool blending of theobjective and the personal. The result is a set of beliefs—both conscious andunconscious—that guide us in interpreting all the events of our lives.For example, a parent’s suggestion to a teenager that he or she put on a jacketbefore going out in the cold can be construed as an attempt to exercise control,as a protective move arising from an exaggerated fear of sickness, or as anexpression of love and concern. A computer analyzing only the parent’s wordsmight make no inference, or might request more data. But the teenager on thereceiving end will probably jump to some conclusion based upon his or her priorbeliefs regarding the parent, and not give much thought to alternative possibleinterpretations. Like Comte, we assume we know.Our brains, for good reason, tend to jump to conclusions based on pastexperience, rules of thumb, and an existing framework of beliefs. We wouldn’tget very far in life if before setting out to watch the beauty of the sunrising, we debated whether it was likely to do so. In fact, evolution favoredthose whose gut reactions guided their choices. When the earth starts tremblingand you’re standing at the foot of a cliff, it’s better to run first and engagein making theories about what is happening later. If instinct hadn’t made aconnection between cause and effect and catalyzed an immediate plan of action inresponse, our ancestors would have been devoured while still pondering thatmysterious movement in the bushes. As William James remarked, “The intellect isbuilt up of practical interests.”Whatever the future of theological belief, people will always adhere to beliefsystems that gratify their emotional needs. None of us can function withouthaving faith of one sort or another. Entrepreneurs start businesses on faith,immigrants with no concrete prospects move to a new country on faith, writerstoil for long hours in the faith that people will want to read their words.There are atheists who put their faith in lucky numbers, and otherwise rationallawyers who eat tuna, a cheeseburger, or a Mayan sun salad each day that a trialcontinues because they think it’s their lucky meal. “You certainly wouldn’t wantto learn that your heart surgeon or your 747 pilot always wears the same pair ofunderwear when it’s time to perform,” said an attorney critical of suchpractices, but there are no doubt surgeons and pilots who do just that. Therewas even a politician in Israel who was famous for always wearing his luckyunderwear on election day. Physicist George Gamow told a story about Niels Bohr,who supposedly had a horseshoe nailed over the door of his country cottage. Whenasked how a famed scientist can have faith in a charm, Bohr replied that hedidn’t believe in it, but “they say that it does bring luck even if you don’tbelieve.”We call these superstitions, but they reflect a deep emotional need to justifybelieving that when we undertake a great challenge, we will succeed. WilliamJames wrote about imagining himself stuck in the Alps, in a position from whichthe only escape is by a terrible leap. “Being without similar experience,” hewrote, “I have no evidence of my ability to perform it successfully, but hopeand confidence in myself make me sure I shall not miss my aim, and nerve my feetto execute what without those subjective emotions would perhaps have beenimpossible. But suppose, on the contrary … I feel that it would be sinful to actupon an assumption unverified by previous experience; why, then I shall hesitateso long that at last, exhausted and trembling, launching myself in a moment ofdespair, I miss my foothold and roll into the abyss.” James wrote that “everyphilosopher, or man of science either, whose initiative counts for anything inthe evolution of thought, has taken his stand on a sort of dumb conviction thatthe truth must lie in one direction rather than another … and has borne his bestfruit in trying to make it work.”Without their faith, many theoretical physicists facing years sequestered indank offices, working on complex calculations with no promise of success, mightindeed have insufficient courage to leap across their abyss. For example, one ofthe central pursuits in fundamental physics today is the quest for an ultimateand elegant theory that unifies all four of the forces we have observed tooperate in nature. One of the forces, gravity, is known to obey this simpleequation, which was formulated by Einstein:[../images/00019.jpeg]Einstein’s equation is of course not really as simple as it looks—it takes muchstudy to be able to learn to apply it, and to understand what it means, and itis one of the most difficult equations in all of physics to solve. But it has asimple physical interpretation, and is a highly economical way of expressing acomplex thought through mathematics, with the left side of the equationrepresenting the structure of space-time, while the right side represents itsmatter-energy content. To a physicist, that makes it an elegant equation. Nowhave a look at the current theory of the other three forces, called the“standard model.” It doesn’t matter what the symbols here actually mean, foreven an uninformed viewer will be able to see that this set of symbols is quitea bit messier and less elegant than the one above:[../images/00020.jpeg]From W. N. Cottingham and D. A. Greenwood, An Introduction to the Standard Modelof Particle Physics, 2nd ed. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007),extracted by J. A. Shifflett, July 28, 2010. Copyright © 2007 W. N. Cottinghamand D. A. Greenwood. Reprinted with the permission of Cambridge UniversityPress.[../images/00021.jpeg]To both the trained and the untrained eye, the standard model is ugly—more likea circuit diagram for some high-tech appliance than an expression of simplephysical principles. Yet it works very well. Is there a more elegant theory ofthese forces yet to be discovered? Richard Feynman said, “People say to me, ‘Areyou looking for the ultimate laws of physics?’ No, I’m not. I’m just looking tofind out more about the world. If it turns out there is a simple, ultimate lawwhich explains everything, so be it; that would be very nice to discover. If itturns out it’s like an onion, with millions of layers, and we’re sick and tiredof looking at layers, then that’s the way it is.” But despite Feynman’sskepticism, if you asked those working in the field, you’d have trouble findingone who doesn’t have faith that a more attractive theory does exist. Physiciststake comfort in their faith that at its core, nature is simple and elegant. Forthem as for everyone else, belief based on feeling, desire, need, or intuitionis a fundamental feature of the human mind.Whenever we face difficulties, challenges, or uncertainties, it can be helpfulto hold beliefs that stretch beyond that which we know without question to betrue. Faith, as James put it, can be a great “working hypothesis.” This is astrue for scientists as it is for anyone else. In fact, it’s important forscientists to formulate such working hypotheses (and then to be willing tojettison them if they aren’t borne out) because if we didn’t, we would nevermove forward in our knowledge of the universe. But working hypotheses likeDeepak’s, which insist on the primacy of an immaterial world, or like thebeliefs of those who deny evolution or embrace supernatural miracles, are atodds with our knowledge of the world, often in active conflict with the physicallaws that govern it. Hence they are flawed.I agree with Deepak that it would be nice if over time theological beliefshifted away from God as an external force that created and rules the universeto God as an inner experience. But God the Ruler has a long history. The stronghuman desire to understand the universe, and to attribute causes to the eventsthat transpire in our world, gave rise, in ancient times, to myths, beliefssynthetically constructed to explain situations people simply didn’t understand.The attraction of those myths was not so much in any objective truth theycodified, but rather in their ability to provide comforting answers to thequestion “How did we get here and why?” Before the advent of science, God theRuler was the answer. God the Ruler met other human longings, too—satisfying ourneed to believe that events happen for a purpose; that the world is just; thatdeath is not the end, but a beginning.Many predict the demise of this kingly and personal God as future scienceproduces triumph after triumph. But science has already shown its prowess in thephysical world—from demonstrating that the Earth is round to explaining howspace is curved. We have seen evolution studied down to the molecular level, theuniverse explored almost back to the Big Bang, bacterial life synthesized, lambscloned, surgery performed with lasers, people sent to the moon, robots sent toMars, three-dimensional images of our brains, quantum teleportation … and still,the enthusiasm for religious explanations of the physical world remains strong.The science of the future might produce a laser that teleports a synthetic lambto Mars to feed robot astronauts, but there is no reason to think that that orany other spectacular feat would bolster the prestige of science at the expenseof religious belief. If there’s one area in which we might find ourselves inagreement with Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the president of Iran, it’s expressed in aletter he wrote to George W. Bush in 2006, saying that “whether we like it ornot, the world is gravitating towards faith in the Almighty.”Sure enough, a Gallup poll taken not long after Ahmadinejad wrote his lettershowed that 94 percent of Americans believe in God, 82 percent say religion isat least fairly important to them, and 76 percent say the Bible is the actual orinspired word of God. If those numbers are down, they certainly haven’t fallenfar. To believe is human, and belief in the traditional God seems to be aliveand well, enjoying the likelihood of a long-lasting future.dy>"},{"pageContent":"18"},{"pageContent":"[../images/00009.jpeg]IS THERE A FUNDAMENTAL REALITY?"},{"pageContent":"[../images/00010.jpeg]LEONARDOn December 17, 1999, a woman known as F.B. in the neuroscience literaturesuffered a stroke on the right side of her brain. As a result, she lost thefeeling of sensation on the left side of her body and could no longer move herleft arm or leg, nor see anything on the left side of her visual field. Andthough F.B.’s memory was not tested, in patients with similar damage to thebrain, access to memories of the left side of the world were found to beobliterated, presumably because the retrieval of those memories entailsactivation of some of the same neural circuits that are active during the actualperception of a scene.When F.B. was asked to touch her left hand, she was unable to find it, and whenit was pointed out to her, she denied it was hers. F.B. was fully oriented, didwell on a mental-state examination doctors administered, and did not show anysign of general mental deterioration. But, as regards her left hand, she wasseriously misinformed: she insisted it belonged to her niece.The phenomenon of a patient disowning a limb was first documented in 1942. Thedelusion was named “somatophrenia.” What is striking about somatophrenia is thatpatients suffering from it are profoundly unaware of their delusion, andmaintain their belief regardless of strong evidence to the contrary. Whenpressed, they typically concede that what they are reporting sounds odd, butoffer evidence to support their story. How could an otherwise intelligent andgrounded individual hold such an absurd belief? Presented with a limb they canneither move, feel, nor remember, these patients’ brains attempt to construct acoherent story that will lead to an apparently reasonable conclusion: that thelimb does not belong to them. From the point of view of people who have normalbrains, the patients’ conclusions are flawed because of damage to both theirsensory data systems and the particular brain structures that interpret thatdata. But even healthy human brains have limitations and peculiarities ofdesign, and so healthy people, too, are constrained in the way they observe andinterpret the world.It would be narrow-minded for us to believe that our picture of the world is thedefinitive one. Aliens with senses and brains that function differently fromours might consider our perceptions to be as deluded as we believe F.B.’s to be.Or if they have superior brains, they might wonder about our primitive worldviewthe way we might wonder about that of a grasshopper or a bat. Yet we are as sureof the validity of our interpretation of reality as somatophrenics are oftheirs.Most people are what philosophers call “naive realists.” They believe that anobjective external reality exists, and is populated by objects with definiteproperties they can identify and codify. Experiments in psychology support theidea that people automatically assume their subjective experience to be afaithful representation of the real world. But long before knowledge ofsyndromes like somatophrenia, or access to technologies like fMRI that allow usto peer into the brain, there have been thinkers who have mounted impressivearguments against the beliefs of naive realism. For example, in 1781, Germanphilosopher Immanuel Kant postulated that the reality we experience is one thathas been constructed and shaped by our minds, minds limited by our beliefs,feelings, experiences, and desires.In the century after Kant, developments in physics grew to require, more andmore, the consideration of reality on a new level, beyond that which weexperience in everyday life. Unseen entities such as electric and magneticfields, atoms and electrons, began to creep into the intellectual theories ofthe physicists. Einstein would come to call the idea of the field “probably themost profound transformation which has been experienced by the foundations ofphysics since Newton’s time”; Feynman would have a similar opinion about theconcept of the atom. These were mental models. Physicists found them useful inanalyzing the phenomena they studied, helping them visualize the events theyobserved, and hence aiding their ability to reason about them, and to make newpredictions. But they were outside our usual experience, and, initially atleast, not seen in the laboratory, either, so it was not clear to what extentthey should be considered real. As Ludwig Boltzmann, the nineteenth-centuryphysicist who might be called the father of modern atomic theory, wrote, suchtheories could be regarded as “merely a mental picture of phenomena that isrelated to them in the same way in which a symbol is related to the thingsymbolized.” In other words, atoms and fields were a kind of language.Galileo said, “The universe is a grand book written in the language ofmathematics,” and that grand book has been the concern of scientists ever since.But are we reading the grand book of the universe, or are we writing one?Mathematician David Ruelle, in a series of articles beginning with“Conversations on Mathematics with a Visitor from Outer Space,” pointed out thathumans do math (and therefore physics) with parts of their brain that evolvedfor other purposes. Our mathematical thinking, he says, is limited by poormemory and attention span, and by our peculiarly human reliance onvisualization. This suggests that at least as far as the scientists constructingnew theories of the universe are concerned, the innate peculiarities of thehuman style of theorizing must be added to the list of the influences affectingour concept of reality.Consider, for example, the idea of the atom. In our everyday world we experiencegaseous matter through its bulk characteristics such as pressure, temperature,and flow. Scientists had previously noted relations among those properties, butpioneers like Boltzmann realized that they could derive those conclusions from amodel in which gases are made of atoms. The atomic model explains the propertiesof gases in terms of these hypothetical unseen entities. More important, theatomic picture could also be used to predict new phenomena. Many scientistsopposed such theories on the ground that atoms were mere mathematical constructsand didn’t “really exist.” Then in 1905 Einstein showed that atomic andmolecular processes accounted for the quantitative features of a phenomenoncalled Brownian motion, which is visible under a microscope. That was enough formost physicists to consider atoms to be real. But it wasn’t until 1981 thatscientists first “saw” a molecule “directly.” And even then, what the scientistsreally did was to compile an image by scanning a needle over the surface of amaterial. So although some would say this constitutes “seeing” a molecule“directly,” others would say it is merely a human artist-scientist’svisualization of Boltzmann’s mathematical construct, the “atom.”[../images/00022.jpeg]This image of peritacene, a molecule made up of five carbon rings, was madeusing an atomic-force microscope.From “The Chemical Structure of a Molecule Resolved by Atomic Force Microscopy,”by Leo Gross, Fabian Mohn, Nikolaj Moll, Peter Liljeroth, Gerhard Meyer, ScienceMagazine, The American Association for the Advancement of Science, August 1,2009. Reprinted with permission from AAAS.The subtleties of what physicists mean when they say that something exists ledSteven Weinberg, in his book Dreams of a Final Theory, to take a step back andask, “What after all does it mean to observe anything?” Weinberg analyzed the“discovery” of the electron, usually credited to British physicist J. J.Thomson, for an experiment he performed in 1897. What Thomson actually did wasmeasure the way the “rays” in a cathode ray tube—essentially an old-fashioned TVpicture tube—are bent by electric and magnetic fields. He found that the amountof bending was consistent with the rays’ being made of tiny particles that carrya definite ratio of charge to mass, and he jumped to the conclusion that theseparticles actually exist and are the constituents of all forms of electricity,from wires to atoms. But Thomson didn’t really see any individual electrons. Hedid not even really observe the bending of the cathode rays; he simply measuredthe position of a luminous spot on the tube, downstream from the source of therays, then inferred the bending, and the charge-to-mass ratio, by employingaccepted theory to calculate how the applied fields could have caused the raysto hit the observed luminous spot. And, “very strictly speaking,” says Weinberg,he did not even do that: he “experienced certain visual and tactile sensations”that he interpreted as a luminous spot.As it happens, German physicist Walter Kaufmann performed a very similar (butmore precise) experiment at about the same time. But Kaufmann took a differentapproach to what he considered real. He believed physics should concern itselfmore strictly with what is observed, so he did not report that he had discovereda new type of particle—the electron. Instead, he reported only that whatevercathode rays are made of, they carry a certain ratio of electric charge andmass. Meanwhile, Thomson went on to perform follow-up experiments, and foundthat his electron model applied in other venues, such as radioactivity, and whenmetals are heated. As a result, Thomson is considered the sole “discoverer” ofthe electron.In the century following Thomson and Boltzmann, physics changed a lot. Todayphysicists have little hesitation considering as real objects that have not beenobserved—and even objects that we believe cannot be observed. In particular,consider the quark, a type of elementary particle thought to be inside theproton, neutron, and many other particles. In the early 1960s, Murray Gell-Mannand George Zweig independently invented the concept. Their theory wascompelling, and led to new predictions that were confirmed, providing convincingevidence for the quark model. Yet when experimentalists smashed particlestogether that should have shaken out and isolated the individual quarks, theynever found any. Eventually physicists realized why we don’t see them: at itsroot, it is because the attraction between quarks increases with distance, as ifthe quarks were connected by a tight spring.If the quark picture is reminiscent of Feynman’s parton model, which I describedin chapter 16 [part0028_split_000.html], that is because Feynman’s partons areindeed the same particles as Gell-Mann and Zweig’s quarks. But Feynman used hismathematical model to explain the data from just a single class of experiments,and for that less ambitious purpose he did not have to assume the partons hadall the specific (and in one case, peculiar) properties that Gell-Mann and Zweighad postulated for their quarks. At the time, most physicists were unsurewhether to consider either the quarks or the partons real, and by using adifferent name for the particles in his model, Feynman avoided committinghimself to endorsing the specifics of theirs. Eventually, however, as Feynmanhad speculated might happen, the parton model and the quark model—having provedtheir usefulness not just as “psychological guides” but as a way of producing“other valid expectations”—did “become real” as far as physicists are concerned,even though we have never observed one, and most of us believe we never will.Einstein stressed the importance of observation, writing, “Pure logical thinkingcannot yield us any knowledge of the empirical world; all knowledge of realitystarts from experience and ends in it.” Today, however, mathematics andobservation are more intimately intertwined than ever before. In modern physics,observation cannot be freed from either the human sensory system or the humanreasoning system.As long as they don’t conflict, different theories, each valid in the sense thatits predictions are confirmed by observation, can present us with differentpictures of the reality, all of them valid. As an example of different butnonconflicting realities, in The Grand Design Stephen Hawking and I wrote aboutthe worldview of a goldfish in a bowl with curved sides. A freely moving objectoutside the bowl that an observer there would deem to be traveling along astraight line—as Newton’s law requires—would seem to the goldfish to be movingalong a curved path. A pioneer goldfish scientist might therefore formulate lawsregarding the motion of objects outside the bowl that are different fromNewton’s laws. Despite that, the goldfish’s laws would enable the goldfish topredict correctly what it could see of the motion of objects on the outside, andso the laws would represent a valid picture of reality. Now suppose anexceptionally brilliant goldfish proposed another theory, that Newton’s lawsapply beyond the boundary of their watery universe, but that light from thatouter realm bends as it passes into the water, causing the paths of outsideobjects to only appear curved. This theory offers goldfish scientists acompletely different conception of what is going on. Those of us standingoutside the fishbowl can argue that the latter is the theory that reallydescribes “reality,” but since both theories supply their formulators with thesame accurate predictions, each would have to be considered an equally validpicture.I have argued that today’s universe is a result of the laws of physics, thathumanity arose from randomness guided by nothing more than the natural selectionof evolution, and that our thoughts and feelings are phenomena with origins inthe physical brain. It is difficult today, in view of what science knows, tobelieve in a god that created the universe a few thousand years ago, depositedsome creatures in it, and now goes around preventing (or causing) wars, healing(or afflicting) the sick, helping college quarterbacks score touchdowns (orenabling the defense to stop them). But science has taught us that otherrealities can exist, and that if you look under the hood of everyday life, theworkings of nature are very different from those we perceive with our senses. Isthere also room for another hidden reality, a reality that includes God?Even those who understand quantum theory go about their everyday lives employingthe model of reality described mathematically by Newton as their workinghypothesis. There is nothing to be gained in describing billiard balls byquantum mechanics, or refusing a glass of wine because of uncertainty regardingthe momentum of the molecules that compose it. Belief, too, can be a workinghypothesis. I once asked a friend whose rationality I respected why she believesin both God and an immortal soul when there is no evidence for either. Iexpected her to disagree about the absence of evidence, but she didn’t. Do yourbeliefs have to be consistent, she asked? Can you enjoy a film even if you’d beat a loss to describe its merits? Can it speak truth to you even if it is not acinematic masterpiece? Why is it wrong to believe in a higher power even if youdon’t have proof? Then she told me of a book published in German, a collectionof notes and letters written by people about to be executed for helping Jewssurvive during World War II. All were written either by people deeply involvedin their faith or by children. There was only one exception, she said—anineteen-year-old secular man who got involved in the resistance movement as asort of adventure. His letters were different from all the others, she said. Hewas the only one who feared death."},{"pageContent":"[../images/00010.jpeg]DEEPAKIf you put a frog in a box and hand it to a scientist, he can tell you manyfascinating things about the creature. Luigi Galvani, an Italian physician inBologna, applied a spark to a frog’s leg in 1771 and observed that the legmuscles twitched. Making a connection between electricity and how the body worksopened up a new world. It would be fair to say that without Galvani’s simpleobservation, the entire field of neuroscience couldn’t exist.If you take another box and put a human brain in it, scientists once againdiscover fascinating things, but some essential mysteries cannot beexplained—for example, how images are visualized in the cortex, how a brain cellstores memory, and how we come to identify with a self. So from a scientificperspective the brain is a “black box,” a system whose inner workings defyexplanation. When you put something in a black box, all a scientist can study iswhat goes in and what comes out. What takes place inside can only be a topic forspeculation.Yet there is a third kind of box that Leonard has been struggling with. In thisbox you put reality. When you ask a scientist to tell you what’s in the box, heruns into huge problems. For example, Leonard grapples with my interpretation ofthe strange way that atoms, the basic building blocks of the physical world,exist in a shadow realm between the real and the unreal. I rely on the fact thatevery particle in the universe has its source in “nothing.” Naturally, it isvery difficult to connect nothing with something, the visible with theinvisible. Our back-and-forth has been a tussle over this one problem, really.Leonard ends his last essay by putting science and spirituality in separatecompartments, each viewing the universe from its own perspective. I don’t thinkthat’s good enough, not if we expect a rational Christian, for example, toaccept evolution over the book of Genesis. We have to look at the whole picture,subjective and objective. Only then can we stop defending a flawed worldview,whether it’s scientific or spiritual. Worldviews are pointless unless they canexplain the reality in the box.Even among the most broad-minded physicists, the mystery of reality borders onthe unsolvable. It is both touching and sad to read about the regret that theearly quantum pioneers felt when they realized that they had left the physicalworld—so dependable, reassuring, and available to the five senses—in tatters.Schrödinger, after providing his famous equation that explained the wavelikebehavior of particles, wished that he hadn’t made his discovery, given the painand struggle it caused. Einstein refused to accept the strangeness of a worldruled by quantum mechanics. For him, the dismantling of certainty was toounnerving. But there is no doubt that quantum theory was right, so far ascalculation goes.Leonard represents a generation of physicists who have come to terms withquantum reality, but I believe he has paid a high price. In my view, he hasfinessed the most unsettling facts, even though science is supposedly ruled byfacts. The first fact is that all experience occurs in consciousness. This ismore than brain processes. The second fact is that if there is a reality outsideconsciousness, we will never know what it is. Leonard acknowledges that nothingoutside the brain can be known, yet he somehow believes at the same time thatscience is on the right road to all the answers we will ever have. Perhaps themost distinguished physicist to try to account for this discrepancy, Sir RogerPenrose, remained baffled, declaring, “I do not believe that we have yet foundthe true ‘road to reality,’ despite the extraordinary progress that has beenmade over two and half millennia, particularly in the last few centuries. Somefundamentally new insights are certainly needed.”On my side of the debate, these insights have existed for a long time. Realityis pure consciousness. Nothing exists outside it. Its effects are all-embracing.There can be no other answer, yet to arrive at this one, science must drop theillusion that there is a physical world “out there” to which it can cling.Leonard has been clinging with all his might, even as he cites evidence to thecontrary.This reminds me of the fishermen who brave the frozen winter seas off Alaska tocatch king crabs. Their job is considered the most dangerous in the world. Theirsmall fishing craft become encrusted in thick ice, making it treacherous tostand on deck, much less carry out the perilous work of hauling up traps heavywith crabs while being tossed about by huge waves.I can imagine Leonard as the captain, shouting to the first mate to measure thenext wave that is about to crash over the bow. The mate raises an instrument tohis eye, which tells him it’s a thirty-foot swell. “How fast is it coming atus?” the captain shouts, worried that they may capsize. The first mate grabsanother instrument, takes a reading, and finds that the wave is approaching atforty knots. But by the time he is ready to shout out the answer, the wave hashit the boat, and it’s all that the crew can do to grab the gunwales or themast, holding on for their lives.If you substitute a light wave or a stream of electrons for the oncoming oceanwave, this is remarkably like the situation that Einstein and his colleaguesfound themselves in. Like the first mate, they could take measurements of mass,charge, and spin by stopping physical reality in midprocess and describingwhatever they could. Meanwhile, the waves keep crashing over the bow: reality isperpetually on the move, waiting for no one.Penrose understood how unmanageable reality actually is, saying, “Some readersmay still take the view that the road itself may be a mirage. Others might takethe view that the very notion of a ‘physical reality’ with a truly objectivenature, independent of how we might choose to look at it, is itself a pipedream.” Leonard seems to feel no ambivalence on these matters. “Shut up andcalculate” is always a potential fallback position where hard science isconcerned, but reality won’t shut up, and the gnawing truth is that ourcommonsense concept of the physical world has proved a leaky boat indeed.Let me take a stab at helping any skeptical reader understand why pureconsciousness must be the right answer to the question, What is fundamentalreality? The thorn in everyone’s side when posing this question is that whateverfundamental reality is, it cannot be created. If you plant a stake and say,“This is it. X is the most basic aspect of reality,” anybody can raise theirhand and say, “But who or what created X?” The creator of X—whether it is God,mathematics, gravity, the curvature of space-time, or any other speculation—mustalways be more fundamental.Which means that the source of creation is uncreated—a concept science has analmost impossible time wrapping its head around. Theories about multipleuniverses don’t save us, because even if you hold that there are trillions ofother universes, who or what created them? One camp speculates that each worldcreates the other, or that they rise and fall in a cosmic rhythm of birth anddeath. That doesn’t solve the problem, either. Who or what started the rhythm?The uncreated is an intellectual nightmare.Although we assume that we must be the smartest people who ever lived, theancient sages of India knew enough to declare that X, the most fundamentalreality, has no physical properties. They refused even to give it a name,instead calling it “that” (tat in Sanskrit). By calling it pure consciousnessinstead, I’ve committed a philosophical sin, making X seem more tangible than itreally is. At bottom, I accept the nameless, formless, inconceivable nature of“that.”Here science and spirituality can hold each other in a consoling embrace. Justas the atom disappears once you realize that it has “no physical properties atall” (Heisenberg), the human mind also disappears once you realize that it hasno physical properties, either. Atoms emerge from a void that is pure potential;thoughts emerge from a void that is pure consciousness. In the interests offairness, one must offer a challenge. When you describe the void, you are simplymaking nonstatements about nonexistence. Aren’t you just giving up?Here we are saved by an unlikely hero, technically known as “qualia,” a wordthat derives from Latin and refers to the subjective aspects of perception. Theredness, softness, and scent of a rose are all qualia, for instance, as are thesaltiness of salt and the sweetness of sugar. Daniel Siegel has bundled thesequalia together with the acronym SIFT, which stands for sensation, image,feeling, and thought. It’s a clever acronym because we do sift through the floodof data that bombards us from all sides, transforming it into one or more ofthese qualia. Going back to Christopher Isherwood’s famous phrase, “I am acamera,” the rock-bottom reason that you and I aren’t a camera—or any othermachine—is that a camera doesn’t sift through reality, whereas we have no choicebut to do so. Peering at the Grand Canyon involves a unique process of sifting,as each of us notices various colors amid the changing light, takes in the smellof the surrounding pines and the sound of the wind rushing up from the canyonfloor, and then incorporates all of this into a feeling of awe (or boredom, ifyour job is to pick up the trash left by tourists), along with personal thoughtsas the scene soaks in.No two people sift the experience of the Grand Canyon in exactly the same way.Two cameras, however, can easily take a pair of photos that are exactly alike.Science pounces on this uniqueness with alacrity, insisting instead that oneexperimenter must replicate the results of another experimenter forverification. Yet in pretending that a camera is recording reality as it shouldbe recorded, science has thrown the sifter out the window. The qualia that havebeen discarded—those sensations, images, feelings, and thoughts—turn out to bethe only things we can really trust. If I send a crab fisherman to sea in Alaskawith a sheaf of data about the waves he will encounter, it would be foolish toclaim that he is prepared for the hazards ahead. Those huge waves are cold,heavy, pounding, fearsome things—that’s their reality. They are nothing butqualia.So the obvious question is, Where do qualia come from? Neuroscientists claimthat they come from the brain. An ancient thinker like Plato claimed that theyare part of Nature. Both answers are assumptions. No matter how finely aneuroscientist probes the visual cortex, he will never find the redness of arose in those squishy gray tissues; he will find only electrochemical soup. Nomatter how deeply a philosopher looks inside the mind, he will never find theexact point where consciousness suddenly produces velvet redness. The trail endswith an admission that the sensations, images, feelings, and thoughts thatconstitute reality are irreducible. Qualia rule.That’s why the connection between mind and brain—or to be more general, betweenmind and anything physical—is called the hard problem. Consciousness won’t letyou look behind the curtain. Reality is modest; it won’t be seen naked. But whatif you reverse the hard problem? Instead of asking for a physical explanation ofsubjective reality, ask for a subjective explanation of the physical world. Thistactic works. If you break down a brain cell seeking where the redness of a rosecomes from, the cell will eventually vanish into energy waves, and those wavescollapse into potentials. If you start instead with redness as an experience, itwill again vanish, this time into the silent mind. But when this happens, youwon’t be left empty-handed. You will still be awake and aware. That can’t bemade to vanish. Moreover, by throwing a mental switch, you can turn silentawareness into the whole physical world. We do it all the time. Even scientists,while claiming that they are being purely objective, are doing it. Consciousnessis master of everything that emerges from itself.Leonard dismisses or ignores arguments that might upset his grip on objectivity.I sympathize. The Yoga Vasistha, one of the major texts of Vedanta from India,proposes a startling idea. When describing the ultimate reality, Vasistha says,“It is that which we cannot imagine, but from which imagination springs. It isthat which is inconceivable, but from which all thinking springs.” To me, thisstatement is so close to quantum reality that I keep wondering when myscientific friends will jump into the water—and discover that not only is itsafe, it’s familiar.There’s no terrifying mystery here, nothing to fear. The thing is, we are all incontact with our inconceivable, unimaginable source. As much as Schrödinger andhis colleagues rebuked themselves, they got over the pain that came withaccepting a quantum world. Now it’s time to integrate that world into oureveryday working lives, because consciousness is fully capable of embracing boththe subjective and the objective aspects of reality. The two don’t have to liveapart, and in truth they cannot. We are sifting and sifting through every singlesecond of our existence. Many scientists wouldn’t trust the inner journey, but Idon’t trust anyone who has a fixation; materialism is a fixation, which Iobserve with real sadness. Materialism has caused as much struggle and pain asanything the world has ever witnessed. Our greed for possessions goes hand inhand with our willingness to wage war against those who pose a threat to ourpossessions, or whose defeat will lead us to own even more. Only in the light ofthe awareness that binds all human beings together does true safety lie.dy>"},{"pageContent":"[../images/00009.jpeg] Epilogue"},{"pageContent":"[../images/00010.jpeg]LEONARDIn the mid-nineteenth century, a leading physicist in England was asked toassess the “table-turning” phenomenon that had become a craze among people whofelt that a type of spiritual contact was occurring during these sessions,allowing them to communicate with the dead. The supposed contact took place asparticipants sat around a table, resting their hands upon it. After some time,the table would become animated. It would turn, tilt, and move about, sometimesdragging the sitters along with it. Determined to embark on a seriousinvestigation of the phenomenon, Michael Faraday, inventor of the electricmotor, one of the founders of electromagnetic theory, and one of the greatestexperimental physicists of all time, attended two séances, where he performed aseries of technically difficult, intricate, and ingenious experiments thatenabled him to understand what was happening. Faraday showed that the motionbegan as random fidgeting; then at some point the participants’ small fidgetymovements would coincide and amplify one another until the table moved slightly.The expectant participants followed it, inadvertently amplifying the motion evenfurther until it seemed the table had a mind of its own. The effect was quitedramatic, and the participants, who were unconsciously pulling and pushing thetable themselves, not being pulled by it, genuinely believed the motion to be acommunication from another realm. But Faraday discovered that it wasn’t.Every once in a while we all come across something mysterious and unexplained.When that happens it is good to be open-minded. But to passively accept aready-made answer, without a critical consideration of the alternatives or anyserious scrutiny of the “proof,” is not being open-minded, it is beingempty-minded. Unfortunately, humans seem to be by nature more comfortable with adefinite if flimsily supported explanation than with hypotheses requiring moreinvestigation and analysis before the issue can be regarded as settled.I don’t mean to compare Deepak’s spirituality, which has its roots in ancientEastern philosophy and religion, to the nineteenth-century “spiritualist”movement that embraced table moving. I use the example merely to show thatscience has often, throughout history, examined untraditional ideas. Moreover,sometimes it comes around to accepting them. For example, until Einstein’s workin 1905, the idea that measures of space and time are subjective, and depend onthe motion of the observer, would have sounded just as foreign and implausibleas Deepak’s ideas sound to most scientists today. And some of Einstein’scontemporaries never did accept relativity. Nevertheless, it soon becamemainstream physics. Why? Because relativity’s predictions were shown to conformto experimental observation. Unfortunately, Deepak’s words and ideas do not.I have tried in this book to point out where Deepak’s arguments clash with whatmodern science tells us. In response, he has referred to a “stubborn resistanceof science to other ways of regarding the cosmos.” He argues that scientists areclosed to seeing the world other than through their traditional “materialist”lens. Deepak’s views of a purposeful universe and the immaterial realm of themind do not constitute a religion, yet like the religions that address theseissues, Deepak’s beliefs are far less open to being questioned and altered thanare the beliefs of science. The Catholic Encyclopedia explicitly warns us thatto disbelieve the Christian revelation “involves not merely intellectual error,but also some degree of moral perversity,” and that “doubt in regard to theChristian religion is equivalent to its total rejection.” Deepak does not gothat far, but his key points, too, have traveled to us largely unchanged if notunchallenged since their origination with great Eastern philosophers ofcenturies and even millennia ago. In science, on the other hand, we areconstantly refining our views, and have readily forsaken the orthodoxies of oursages, from Newton to Einstein to Bohr, whenever the evidence required us to doso. Science thrives on doubt. Far more than any religion, science has been openand accepting enough to embrace vast revolutions in its worldview, and seemingheresies on issues like the corruptibility of time and space, and theimpossibility of certainty in prediction. Even the materialism that Deepak tellsus science holds sacred has been altered as our knowledge of the universe hasincreased. At first science considered only visible, palpable objects as real;then science grew to accept intangible force fields, unseen atoms, and evenunseeable quarks. Science is open to accepting new truths. What it resists isaccepting untruths.Science is open-minded because it has no agenda. Science does not care if theEarth is the center of the universe or just another planet, if the Milky Way isthe only galaxy or just one of many billions, or even if our universe is notunique. Science does not take offense at finding that human beings developedfrom apes or bacteria, that we are gone to dust when we die, or that ourconsciousness has no magical side to it. Darwin did not approach the issue ofthe origin of life saying “We must remove purpose from creation.” Deepak, incomparison, writes, “If we want to evolve beyond our worst impulses, the onlyway is through a higher purpose that benefits everyone” and “Spiritualityrestores purpose and direction to their rightful places at the heart ofevolution.”I agree that it is good to lead a purposeful life, but that should not beconfused with believing that nature has purpose built into its laws. I alsoapplaud Deepak’s vision of how people ought to live and to treat one another.But whereas Deepak and I both would like to see a better world, one in whichpeople have transcended their worst impulses, as a scientist I cannot let theway I want the world to be drive my apprehension of the way the world is.One of the issues Deepak feels science is closed-minded about is the existenceof a hidden or invisible realm. It is true that historically science hasrejected many suggestions of invisible realms. But that’s not because sciencehas never examined them. One of the most important traits of a great scientistis curiosity, and over the years scientists from Faraday to Feynman havepondered such issues. But another great trait of the scientist is skepticism,for there is no joy in satisfying curiosity with false explanations. Therequirement that our theories correspond to what we observe in the real worldhas thus far necessitated our always rejecting ideas regarding the immaterialrealm.Events can be deceiving, and discovering their true explanations often isn’teasy. The emergence of galaxies, stars, and people from chaos can appear, liketables apparently moving by themselves, to demand some supernatural explanation.When philosophizing one can talk freely about unseen realms, invisiblerealities, and organizing forces that guide evolution. One can illustrate theideas with stories and anecdotes, and argue by analogy. One can use everydaylanguage, with its pitfalls of vagueness, and terms with multiple meanings. Onecan pepper one’s prose with satisfying terms like “love” and “purpose.” One caneven appeal to ancient sages and texts. These arguments may seem attractive. Butscience answers to a higher authority—the way Nature actually works.When Richard Feynman had the idea to recast quantum theory based on his newinterpretation, a reformulation that would give physicists a completelydifferent picture and a new understanding of reality, he too began with simpleexamples and analogies. But then he spent years making his ideas precise,figuring out all the details, defining exactly what his words and ideas meant,and recalculating almost every quantity anyone had ever calculated using the oldformulation in order to check that his form of the theory produced the samepredictions—all of which had been confirmed by experiment. Only then did Feynmanbelieve and publish his revolutionary work. For a theoretical physicist to havea new and interesting idea, or even to develop an attractive and plausible newtheory, is not uncommon. To have it meet the test of reality and find acceptanceis. The scientific approach to truth has brought humanity a wealth of knowledgenot attainable by other means.Deepak has repeatedly brought up the destructive applications of science. Butlet’s not forget that a world that ignores the truth of science is a world leftin the darkness of superstition, the misery of ignorance. Centuries ago, thehuman condition was one of pestilence, filth, hardship, and disease. Think aboutthe improvements in living conditions that have resulted from the scientificrevolution. Being a physician himself, Deepak knows that if we relied on hiswisdom tradition for our knowledge of the universe, instead of the scientificmethod, we’d still be falling victim to rampant diseases like smallpox,tuberculosis, polio, and pneumonia, and women would still commonly perish inchildbirth; we’d be the victims of dirty and disease-ridden water; and we’d bestarving because agriculture could not have kept up with worldwide food demand,nor would reliable contraception methods exist to help people limit the numberof children to those they can feed and support. In short, we’d still be dyingbefore middle age because ancient wisdom traditions are no substitute for modernscience.I’m not saying that science has all the answers. Consciousness lies at the heartof Deepak’s worldview. It is also science’s last frontier. Today science doesnot even have a good operational definition. We are like Michael Faraday at thestart of his career. As he explored what we now call electromagnetism, even thecharacterization of electricity as positive or negative was controversial. Manyanalogous debates about the fundamental nature of consciousness take place inscience today. We poke around, we make observations, but we are not really surewhat it is we are trying to study. Still, there is no reason to believe thatconsciousness won’t be explained. We need not jump the gun and accept that itsexplanation lies in some unphysical realm.There are many mysteries in physics today, from the nature of dark matter, tothe recent discovery that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, to thepossible observations of exotic new types of neutrinos that don’t fit into thestandard model. Such mysteries could result in a revision of current theories,or in a complete overhaul. Either way, it is natural for scientific theories tokeep evolving. When I talk to other scientists about the possibility ofidentifying a phenomenon that pokes a hole in our current theories, the mostcommon response I hear is a desire for such an anomaly to occur. For whilemetaphysics is fixed and guided by personal belief and wish fulfillment, scienceprogresses and is inspired by the excitement of discovery. The scientist’s dreamis to make new discoveries, especially when they mean that established theoriesmust be revised. Scientists discovered two new forces in the twentiethcentury—the strong and weak nuclear forces—and the same excitement thataccompanied those discoveries would reign if we ever found real evidence ofanother realm of consciousness. All it takes is convincing data to support theidea. If that were to come, many a scientist would enlist in the effort to findmore evidence, in order ultimately to prove or disprove the existence of thatrealm.I’ve argued for a worldview grounded in observation and evidence, and I’veargued that such a viewpoint need not deny the richness of the human spirit, orthe wonder of the universe. As Einstein wrote, concerning the idea that humanbehavior is governed by nothing more than the laws of nature, “This is mybelief, although I know well that it is not fully demonstrable. [But if] onethinks out to the very last consequence what one exactly knows and understands,there will be hardly any human being who will be impervious to this view,provided his self-love does not ruffle up against it.”Admittedly, our self-love makes it difficult to accept a worldview in whichhuman beings do not play a central role in the universe. But science’s ultimatetriumph lies in the integrity of its methods, the openness of its point of view,the eagerness of its embrace of the truth. Science may never have all theanswers, but it will never stop looking for them, and it will never take theeasy way as it continues on its search for understanding."},{"pageContent":"[../images/00010.jpeg]DEEPAKTo many readers, there is no war of two worldviews, or if there is, onecombatant is puny and unarmed while the other possesses tanks, robot drones, andsmart bombs. Science is fully armed, while a new spirituality, divorced fromreligious dogma, is a fledgling. I’d suggest that the war doesn’t need to befought anymore, because it’s already over. Hidebound science is ready to topple,making way for a new paradigm where consciousness takes center stage. Don’texpect the bodies of fallen physicists littering the field. The outcome won’t bethe vanquishing of science but its expansion. The expanded version will be ableto admit into evidence something that Leonard shuns: a purposeful universe.(When Leonard says that I am clinging to precepts from thousands of years ago,he can’t be serious, given how much up-to-date science the new spirituality hascome to terms with.)He himself hits on the guiding principle of an expanded science, which “answersto a higher authority—the way Nature actually works.” Unfortunately, he hasn’tbeen able to follow his own prescription. Faced with evidence aboutpost-Darwinian evolution, the quantum basis of consciousness, and the futilityof equating the brain with the mind, Leonard runs for shelter in cherishedbeliefs that forward-looking science is abandoning with greater and greaterspeed. I invite him to jump in the water—it’s not scary—but like the CatholicEncyclopedia he somewhat bizarrely cites, he has deeper concerns (scientificsalvation, perhaps?) that make it forbidden to accept a spirituality that isconsistent with science. Anyone allied to rooting mind in matter will continueto ignore the anomalies that crack their worldview.Leonard is in favor of leading a purposeful life, only he wants to divorce itfrom science. I’ve always been struck by the way scientists wed themselves tothe dogma of a random universe, one totally devoid of meaning, when it’s obviousthat every moment of life embraces the things that matter to us, even if yourgoal is as small as making it through the day, finishing a mystery novel, orpicking up the kids after soccer practice. If our life has meaning, it must havecome from somewhere.For me to declare that the war is over, I must offer evidence. These essays haveindicated numerous trails of evidence—from the plasticity of the brain to thefluidity of genes, from the quantum vacuum to the domain outside space andtime—to meet the call for “new insights” that Sir Roger Penrose has sounded.Twenty-five years ago, my medical colleagues in Boston refused to believe thatthere was a mind-body connection. Now it’s accepted without question that ourthoughts, feelings, and moods are conveyed instantly to every cell in the body.The cell membrane receives news of the world, inner and outer, and on amicroscopic level it is the world, written in molecules. Back then, when aprofessor of medicine smirked at the notion of the mind affecting the body, Iwould blurt out, “How do you wiggle your toes? Isn’t your mind sending an orderto your feet?”I’ve declared repeatedly that I am not defending any conventional God. Butspirituality cannot be artificially segregated from the essence of religion.Both depend on a personal journey, leading in the end to the transformation ofconsciousness. The invitation to begin such a journey comes from reality itself.I firmly believe that reality wants to be known, and human evolution answers tothat call. Science is one answer, but it can’t hog the road; spirituality isjust as valid an answer.Science shouldn’t be the enemy of the inner journey, and I feel disheartened ifLeonard believes that his view of a “higher authority” forbids innerexploration, as if table rapping in a Victorian séance should be our model forspirituality. Does anyone think that the Buddha and Plato ran séances? Yetthere’s no reason to make rhetorical hay here. The world’s great spiritualteachers were Einsteins of consciousness. They provided principles anddiscoveries fully as valid as those of Einstein, who had his religious doubtsbut never lost sight of the awe and wonder that he felt were essential to allgreat scientific discoveries.Leonard places great store in doubt as a tool of science. I can only agree, buta rigid, hostile skepticism does no one any favors. Skeptics squat by the roadlike guardians of truth, letting no one pass who doesn’t come up to scratch.They never realize that they can see only what their paradigm tells them to lookfor. If you judge a person only by how well he plays pool, Mozart won’t passscrutiny, but the fault is in your lens.I was once talking on mind and body before an audience in England when a loud,red-faced man jumped to his feet shouting, “This is all garbage. Don’t listen tohim. It’s crap!”The audience stirred uneasily, and I was a bit shaken. “Who are you, sir?” Iasked.“I’m the head of the UK Skeptical Society,” he replied.“I doubt it,” I said, and the audience burst out laughing.Leonard comes close to joining the Society for the Suppression of Curiosity,which is where blanket skepticism leads. But I imagine he is as guided by aweand wonder as Einstein, so let me speak to those qualities. At the instant ofthe Big Bang, the laws of nature apparently came about within 10–43 seconds—anunimaginably short blink in which to assemble every ingredient of the knownuniverse inside a space trillions of times smaller than the period at the end ofthis sentence. Nothing existed during the “quantum epoch” that preceded thisinstant except for a sea of roiling energy. Even that is conceptually shaky,because there were no physical laws, and therefore nothing like electromagnetismexisted, either.The human brain, if you believe in strict materialism, was also predetermined inthis roiling energy soup billions of years ago. If so, then we are the productof what came next: this astonishingly fine-tuned universe, where dozens ofconstants are perfectly meshed in such a way that a change of one part in abillion would have defeated the whole venture. You are able to read andthink—along with playing at billiards or the game of love—only because of whatcame after 10–43 seconds. Without light, gravity, and electrons, not to mentiontime and space, none of us would be here. What came before is unknowable, andfor that reason alone, science is reduced to conjectures no less fanciful thanwhat I have been proposing. When we argue over where the cosmos came from, theplaying field gets flatter every day.In fact, fanciful is being kind. Materialism cannot venture anywhere before thecreation of matter. Objectivity cannot venture anywhere before there wereobjects to observe. If the fate of the universe was decided in a single moment,why can’t it be a creative moment? Leonard’s thundering “no!” makes littlesense. It’s not as if his method will get us anywhere. Our subjectivity connectsus to the primordial impulse to make something out of nothing; otherwise, wedeprive ourselves of creativity, deep intelligence, and free will.Ordinary people aren’t going to give up emotions and inspiration just becausescience sniffs at subjectivity. Science shouldn’t be so edgy and defensive.Vandals aren’t going to smash their way into laboratories and throw Bibles atthe equipment. Despite reactionary religious activity on the fringes, we allaccept that science represents something enormously good and progressive. Theivory tower would be a modern replacement for the sacred city upon a hill, butunfortunately, from that tower rained down not just good things but the atombomb, biochemical weapons, and nerve gas.Most scientists wince at the existence of weapons research and then go on abouttheir business. The rise of diabolical creativity seems unstoppable. Otherscientists join the profitable enterprise of death with relish. One must bedecisive here: a world ruled completely by science would be hell on earth. Beingwedded to rational thought is acceptable inside the lab, but once scienceventures to dismantle faith, striving, love, free will, imagination, emotion,and the higher self as so many illusions cooked up in our fallible brain, arescue effort must be mounted, and quickly.I don’t mean to embarrass anyone by my fervor—we all know the destructive powerof fervor when it’s attached to religious intolerance. But the time is growinglate. Millions of people have abandoned organized religion. Almost a hundredyears ago Freud derided religious faith as a rearguard action in defense of theindefensible. But aspiration is defensible, and it can’t be fulfilled byscience—not unless science is willing to break down the walls that falselyseparate the inner and outer worlds. Ten years ago it was considered unthinkableto be interested in consciousness and still preserve a respectable scientificcareer. Today one can attend conferences where hundreds of scientists acrossevery field present panels on consciousness, and the word “quantum” is tossedaround to describe brain processes, photosynthesis, bird migration, and cellformation. Right under the nose of physics, brilliant minds are creating a newfield, quantum biology.Which means that to have a vision of a new, expanded science is no longer afolly. Clearly the rescue operation needs to expand much wider, however. Allaround us people ache with emptiness and yearning; there’s a vacuum to befilled, and it’s a spiritual vacuum. What other word really fits? Only whenpeople are given hope that this ache can be healed will we truly know what thefuture holds. Let science join in the cure, because otherwise, we may wind upwith marvels of technology serving empty hearts and abandoned souls.dy>"},{"pageContent":"Acknowledgments [../images/00010.jpeg]DEEPAK CHOPRANothing is more gratifying to a writer than discovering that his books havebecome a family affair.
