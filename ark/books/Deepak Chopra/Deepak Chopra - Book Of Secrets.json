Time and aga in people have ach ieved all of these things and wound up still feeling dissatisfied— indeed, often more dissatisfied than when the y began. The deepest hunger in life is a secret that is reveal ed onl y when a person is willing to unlock a hidden part of the self. In the anci ent tradi tions of wisdom , this quest has been lik ened to diving for th e m ost prec ious pearl in existen ce, a poetic wa y of sa ying that you have to swim far out be yond shallow waters, plunge deep into yourself, and search pa tient ly unti l the pearl beyond price is found. The pearl is also call ed essence, the breath of God, the water of life, holy nec tar—l abels for what we, in our more prosaic scient ific age, would simp ly call transform ation. Transfor mation means radic al change of form, the way a caterpil lar transform s into a butterfl y. In hum an terms, it means turning fear, aggres sion, doubt, insecurit y, hatred, and emptin ess into their oppo sites. Can this real ly be ach ieved? One thing we know for certa in: The secret hunger that gnaw s at people ’s souls has noth ing to do with externa ls like money, status, and securit y. It’s the inner person who craves meaning in life, the end of suffering, and answers to the riddl es of love, death, God, the soul, good and evi l. A life spent on the surface will never answer these questions or satisf y the needs that driv e us to ask the m. Finding the hidden dimensions in yourself is the only way to fu lfill your deep est hunger . After the rise of science, this craving for knowledge should have faded, but it has only grown stronger . There are no new “facts” to discover about life’ s hidden dimensions. Nobod y needs to peer at more CAT scans of patien ts under going a near -dea th experienc e or take more MRIs of yogis sitting deep in meditation. Tha t pha se of exper imentation has done its work: We can be assured that wherev er con sciousnes s wants to go, the hum an brain will follow . Our neurons are capable of register ing the highest spiritu al experienc es. In some ways, howeve r, you and I know less about the m ystery of life than our ancestors. We live in the Age of the Higher Bra in, the cerebral cortex that has grown enor mousl y over the last few millennia, overshadowing the ancien t, instin ctive lower brain. The cortex is often called the new brain, yet the old brain held swa y in humans for millions of years, as it doe s today in most living things. The old brain can’ t con jure up ideas or read. But it does possess the power to feel and, above all, to be. It was the old brain that caused our forebears to sense the closen ess of a mysterious presence ever ywhere in Nature. That presenc e, which is found in ever y part icle of crea tion, suffuse s your life, too. You are a book of secrets waiting to be opened, although you probabl y see yourself in tota lly differen t terms. On a given day, you are a worker , a father or mother, husband or wife, a consu mer combing the mall stores for something new , an audienc e m ember wait ing i mpatientl y for the next enter tain ment. When you are living the truth of one r eality, every secr et reveals itse lf without effort or struggle. It comes down to the age- old choic e of separat ion or unit y. Do you want to be fragm ented, confli cted, torn between the etern al forces of darkness and light? Or do you want to step out of separation into wholen ess? You are a creature who acts, thinks, and feels. Spiritu ality fuses these three into a single real ity. Thinking doesn’ t lord it over feeling ; feeling doesn’ t stubbornl y resist the higher brain; doing occurs when both thought and feeling say, “This is right.” The one reali ty can be recogn ized because once you are there, you experienc e the flow of life without obstac les or resistanc e. In this flow , you encount er inspiration, love, truth, beaut y, and wisdo m as natural aspects of exist ence. The one reality is spirit, and the surface of life is only a disguise with a thousand masks that keeps us fro m discovering what is real. A thousand years ago, such a stat ement would have met with no argum ent. Spirit was accepted ever ywher e as the true source of life. Toda y, we have to look with new eyes at the mystery of existence, for as proud childr en of scienc e and reason, we have made ourselv es the orphans of wi sdo m. Therefore, this book mus t work on two fronts. First, it mus t persuade you that ther e really is a mystery lying in"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"the hidden dimensions of life. Second, it must inspire you to feel the passion and dedi cation required to get there. This isn’t a project to postpone until you are read y. You have been read y since the day you forgot to keep asking who you are and why you are here. Sadl y, most of us keep shutting out thousands of experi ences that could make transfor mation a real ity. If it weren’ t for the enor mous effort we put into denial, repression, and doubt, each life would be a constan t revel ation. Ulti mately you have to believe that your life is worth investiga ting with total passion and com mitment. It took thousands of tiny decisions to keep the book of secrets closed, but it takes only a single moment to open it again. I take it litera lly when the New Testa ment says, “Ask and you will receiv e, knock and the door will be opened.” It’s that simpl e. You will kno w ever y secret about life when you can truly say I must know. I can’t wait a moment longer. Buddha sitting under the Bodhi tree and Jesus wrestl ing with demons in the desert are symbolic of the same dram a of the soul that you were born to repeat. Never doubt this: You are the most significan t being in the world, because a t the level of the soul y ou are the world. You don ’t have to earn the right to know . Your very nex t thought, feeling, or action can begin to uncover the deepest spiritu al wisdo m, which flow s as pure and free as mount ain waters in spring. It isn’ t possible for the self to keep secre ts from itse lf forever , no m atter how thoroughl y we’ve been train ed to bel ieve otherwise. Secret #1 THE M YSTER Y OF LIFE IS REAL THE LIFE YO U KNOW is a thin layer of events covering a deeper real ity. In the deeper real ity, you are part of ever y event that is happening now , has ever happened, or ever will happen. In the deeper real ity, you kno w absolutel y who you are and what your purpose is. There is no confusion or confl ict with any other person on earth. Your purpose in lif e is to help crea tion to expand and grow . When you look at y ourself, you see onl y love. The mystery of life isn’t any of these things, howeve r. It’s how to bring them to the surface. If som eone asked me how to prove that there really is a mystery of life, the simplest proof would be just this enor mous separat ion between deep real ity and ever yday existen ce. Ever since you and I were born, we’ve had a constant strea m of clues hinting at anoth er world inside ourselves. Haven’ t you ever fallen into a moment of wonder ? Such moments may come in the presence of beautifu l music, or at the sight of natur al beau ty that sends a shiver up your spine. Or you may have looked out of the corner of your eye at someth ing fam iliar— morn ing sunlight, a tree swaying in the wind, the face of someone you love as he or she sleeps—knowing in that moment that life was m ore than it appears to be. Countless clues have come your way, only to be overlooked because they didn’ t form a clear message. I have met an astonishing numb er of people who se spiri tual beginnings were nothing short of amazing: As children, they may have seen a grand mother ’s soul leav e at the moment of her death, witnessed beings of light surrounding on a birthda y, trave led beyond their physical bodies, or com e home from school to see a beloved fam ily member standing in the hallwa y, even though the person had just died in a terr ible auto acciden t. (One man told me he was a “bubble boy” for the first ten years of his life, journe ying in his bubble high over the city and away to unknown lands.) Millions of people—th is is no exagg eration but test imon y from public polls— have seen themselves bathed in a pearl escent white ligh t at times. Or they heard a voice they kne w came from God. Or the y had invisibl e guardi ans in childhood, secret friends who protect ed the m while the y slept. Even tual ly, it beca me clear to me that more people have had such exper iences—tru ly secret voyages into a reali ty separated from this one by a flimsy veil of disbeli ef—than not. Parting the veil means changing your own perc eption. This is a personal, total ly sub jective, yet ver y real shift. Where would you begin to solve a mystery that is ever ywhere, yet somehow never forms a whole message? A"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"great sleuth like Sherlo ck Holmes would start his search from one elementary deduction : Something unknown wants to be known. A mystery that doesn ’t want to be kno wn will just keep retrea ting the closer you com e to it. The mystery of life doesn ’t behav e that way: Its secrets are revea led immediately if you kno w where to look. But where is tha t? The bod y’s wisdom is a good entr y point into the hidden dimensions of life, because although com pletely invisibl e, the bod y’s wisdom is undeniab ly real—a fact that medical resear chers began to accept in the mid- 1980 s. The form er view was that the brain ’s cap acit y for inte llig ence was unique. But then signs of inte llig ence began to be discover ed in the immune system, and then in the digestive system. In both these systems, specia l messenger molecules could be observed circul ating through ever y organ, bringing infor mation to and from the brain, but also func tioning on their own. A white cell that can dist inguish between invading ene my bacter ia and harm less poll en is m aking an in telligent decision, even though it floa ts in the bloodstrea m apart from the brain. Ten years ago, it would have seemed absurd to speak of intestines being intelligent. The lining of the digestive tract was kno wn to posses s thousands of nerve endings, but these were just remot e outposts of the nervous system—a way for it to keep in touch with the lowl y business of extra cting nutri tion from food. Now it turns out that the intestines are not so lowl y after all. The ir scattered nerve cells form a fine ly tuned system for react ing to outside events—an upsetting remark at work, the threa t of danger , a death in the family. The stom ach’ s reac tions are just as reli able as the brain’ s thoughts, and just as intri cate. Your colon, your liver , and your stom ach cells also think, only not in the brain ’s verbal language. What peop le had been calling a “gut react ion” turn ed out to be a m ere hint of the co mplex in telligenc e at work in a hundred thousand bi llion cells. In a sweeping medical revolut ion, scien tists have stepped into a hidden dim ension that no one had ever suspect ed. Cel ls have been outthink ing us for mi llions of y ears. In fac t, the ir wisdom , more ancien t than cortic al wisdo m, could be the best model for the only thing more ancient than they, which is the cos mos. Perhaps the universe has been outthink ing us, too. No matter where I look, I sense what cosm ic wisdo m is trying to acco mplish. It is much the sam e as what I myself want to acco mpl ish—to grow , expand, and creat e—the main difference being that m y bod y is cooperat ing with the universe better than I m anage to. Cel ls have no proble m full y particip ating in the mystery of life. Theirs is a wisdo m of total passion and com mitmen t. So let’s see if we can link the qualit ies of bodil y wisdom with the hidden dim ensions we want to uncover: THE WIS DOM YO U ARE ALREAD Y LIVIN G Identifying with the Body’s Intelligence 1. You have a higher purpose. 2. You are in communion with the whole of life. 3. Your awareness is alwa ys open to change. Fro m moment to moment, it senses ever ything in your environ men t. 4. You fee l acceptance for al l others as y our equa l, without judg men t or prejudice. 5. You seiz e ever y mo ment with renewed creativ ity, not clinging to the old and outworn. 6. Your being is crad led in the rh ythms of the universe. You feel safe and nurtured. 7. Your idea of efficiency is to let the flow of life bring you what you need. Force, control, and struggle are not your wa y. 8. You fee l a sense of connection with y our source. 9. You are committed to giving as the source of a ll abundan ce. 10. You see all change, including birth and death, aga inst the background of immortality . Whatever is unchanging is most real to y ou. None of these it ems are spiri tual aspirat ions; the y are facts of dail y existence at th e leve l of y our ce lls."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" Highe r purpose: Ever y cell in your bod y agrees to work for the welfar e of the whole; its indiv idual welfare com es second. If nec essar y, it will die to prote ct the bod y, and often does—the lifet ime of any given cell is a fraction of our own lifet ime. Skin cells perish by the thousand s ever y hour , as do immune cells fighting off invading microbes. Selfishnes s is not an option, even when it com es to a cel l’s own s urviva l. Communion: A cell keeps in touch with ever y other cell. Messenger molecul es race ever ywhere to notif y the bod y’s farthest outposts of desire or intention, however slight. Withdrawing or refusing to communica te is not an option. Awarenes s: Cel ls adapt from momen t to moment. The y remain flex ible in order to respond to immediate situat ions. Getting caught up in rigid hab its is not an option. Acceptance: Cel ls recogn ize each oth er as equal ly importan t. Ever y function in the bod y is int erdependen t with ever y othe r. Going it alone is not an opt ion. Creativit y: Although ever y cell has a set of unique funct ions (liver cells, for exam ple, can perform fifty separate tasks), these combine in creat ive ways. A person can digest food never eaten before, think thoughts never thought before, danc e in a wa y never seen before. Clinging to old behavior is not an option. Being: Cells obe y the universal cycle of rest and activ ity. Although this cycle expresses itself in many ways, such as fluctua ting hor mon e leve ls, blood pressures, and digestiv e rhythms, the most obvious expression is sleep. Wh y we need to sleep rem ains a medical mystery, yet complete dysfunct ion develops if we don’ t enjo y its benefits. In the silence of inact ivit y, the future of the bod y is incub ating. Being obsessivel y active or aggressive is not an option. Efficienc y: Cel ls funct ion with the sma llest possible expendi ture of ener gy. Typically, a cell stores only three seconds of food and oxygen inside its cell wall. It trusts totally on being provided for. Exc essive consum ption of food, air , or w ater is not an option. Bonding: Due to their common genet ic inheri tance, cells kno w that they are funda mentally the sam e. The fact that liver cells are different from hear t cells, and muscl e cells are different from brain cells, does not nega te their common identi ty, which is unchanging. In the labora tory, a musc le cell can be gene tically transfor med into a heart cell by going back to their common source. Heal thy cells rem ain tied to their source no matter how many times the y divide. For them , be ing an outc ast is not an option. Giv ing: The primary activ ity of cells is giving, which maintains the integrit y of all other cells. Total com mitmen t to giving makes receiv ing auto matic—it is the other half of a natura l cycle. Hoarding is not an option. Immortalit y: Cel ls reproduce in order to pass on the ir knowledge, experienc e, and talents, withholding nothing from their offspring. This is a kind of practic al immortal ity, subm itting to death on the physical plan e but defeat ing it on the nonph ysical. The generat ion gap is not an option. When I look at what my cells have agreed to, isn’ t it a spiritua l pac t in ever y sense of the word ? The first quali ty, following a higher purpo se, is the same as the spiritu al qua lities of surrender and selfl essne ss. Giving is the same as returning to God what is God’ s. Immorta lity is the same as a belief in life after dea th. The labels adopted by the mind are not my bod y’s concern, however . To my bod y, these quali ties are simpl y the way life works. The y are the result of cos mic intelligenc e expres sing itse lf over bi llions of y ears as biolog y. The mystery of life was pat ient and carefu l in allowing its full poten tial to emerge. Ev en now , the silent agre ement that holds my bod y toge ther feels like a secret because, to all appearanc es, this agree ment doesn’ t exist. More than two hundred and fifty types of cells go about their dail y business: The fifty funct ions that a liver cell perfor ms are tota lly unique, not overl apping with the tasks of muscl e, kidne y, heart, or brain cells— yet it would be catastroph ic if even one function were com pro mised. The mystery of life has found a way to express itself perfect ly through me ."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" Scan the list of quali ties again and take note of ever ything marked “not an option”: selfishness, refusing to com municat e, living like an outc ast, overconsu mpt ion, obsessive activit y, and aggression. If our cells know not to behave in these ways, why do we? Wh y is greed good for us and yet spells destruction at the level of our cells, where greed is the basic mistake made by can cer cells? Wh y do we allow overconsum ption to lead to an epide mic of obe sity when our cells measure to the molecule how m uch fuel to consu me? The ver y behav ior that would kill our bodies in a day hasn’ t been renounced by us as peopl e. We are betra ying our bodil y wisdom , and worse, we are ignoring th e m odel of a perfec t spiritu al life insid e ourselves. This book was not born out of a sense that people are spiri tual ly weak and inadequat e. It was born from a moment of crisis in my family that gave me new hope instead. My fath er died a few years ago when no one expect ed it. Still vigorous at eight y-one, he had spent that Januar y day watching a new U.S. president being inaugurat ed. Retired fro m his long medica l practi ce as a cardio logist, my father stil l kept a profes siona l hand in, and he had spent that evening discu ssing m edica l cases with a circ le of his students. My mother, who was sleeping in a separat e roo m because of poor hea lth, didn’ t hear Krishan go to bed. But after midnight, when she was still unabl e to sleep, he appe ared at her door in his bedc lothes, barel y a dim outlin e in the darkness, and said that he was leaving. Immediately my mother knew what he meant. My father kissed her goodb ye and said that he loved her. Then he padded quie tly back to his roo m where only the night sounds of crick ets, tropi cal birds, and Delhi traf fic penetrat ed. He la y down, ca lled to God three times, and died. Our fa mily was swept up in tur moil. My younger brother and I rushed to India fro m the United Sta tes as fast as we could, and within hours, having tradit ionall y dressed my father ’s bod y for the funera l and stre wn it with marigo lds, we carried it downstairs to the wail ing of wom en mixed with sacred chant ing. Not long after that, I was standing over a pile of ashes at the burning ghat by the rive r, perfor ming the eldest son’ s duty of smashing the re mains of the skull with a stick to symbolically release th e earth ly bonds to the life my father had led. I couldn’ t escape the feeling that he had com pletely and utterly disappeared, this man who had been the most loved person in my life and the last one I thought of losing so soon. But the fact that he had passed with such clea r, calm awareness kept all of us from feeling the deep est pangs of grief. Although I was cert ain Krishan Chopra was gone in the form of the bod y and personali ty I knew , my emotions couldn’ t rest until I arti culat ed, in ever y detai l pos sible, what he had beco me. The mystery was changing him from one state to another , and I reali zed that the sam e transform ation is happening in myself and in ever yone. We are all held together and we all dis solve accord ing to m ystery, nothing else. Instead of invest igat ing the mystery of life as an intimate part of ourselves, we’ve been acting as if it doesn’ t exist. Ever yone has suffered for this neg lect, and more suffering, perhaps on an unheard-of scale, is looming over the horizon. My father depar ted from a world sunk in the depths of gloo m. When the even ing news com es on tonight, trouble will be breaking out ever ywhere, as it alwa ys is, and the answers being offered won’ t be anywher e close to the wisdo m of a single cell. Man y people lose heart and withdraw from the chal lenge of so much suffering. Others assume that they must leave where they are and find something they do not yet have—a new relat ionship, a new job, a new relig ion or te acher—befor e the y can feel aliv e again. Would the cells in your bod y accept such defeatist logic? If where you are isn’t good enough, then love and healing and God will rem ain forever out of reach. After genera tions of life spent in chaos, are we read y to let the m ystery save us no w? I s ther e an y other wa y?

Our wayward lapses poin t to a much larger patt ern. To get back to the cell ’s wisdom, each of us needs to see that we are living the afteref fects of someon e else’ s old cho ices. We were taught to follow a set of habits and beliefs that total ly disregard the mystery of life. These beli efs are cont ained one inside the other like nested boxes: There is a ma terial world. The m ateria l world is full of things, even ts, and people. I am one of those people, and m y status is no higher than that of an yone else. To find out who I am , I m ust explore the m ateria l world. This set of beliefs is binding. It allows no roo m for soul- search ing, or even for the soul itself. Wh y bring the mystery of life into a system that alread y knows what is real? But as convin cing as the materia l world looks, to the great embarrassm ent of mod ern science, no one has been able to prove that it is real. Ordinar y people don’ t focus on science, so this glar ing proble m is not well known. Yet any neurologist will assure you that the brain offers no proof that th e outside world reall y exists and m any hints tha t it doesn ’t. All the brain does, in fact, is to rece ive con tinuous signals about the bod y’s state of che mical balance, temper ature, and oxygen consum ption, along with a crackl ing strea m of nerve impulses. This mass of raw data starts out as che mical bursts with attached electr ical char ges. These blips run up and down a tangled web of spidery nerve cells, and once a signal reaches the brain, like a runner from the edge of the Empire bring ing a message to Rom e, the cortex assembles the raw data into even more compl ex arrange ments of electr ical and che mical blips. The cortex doesn’ t infor m us about this never -ending dat a processing, which is all that is happening inside gra y matter. Instead, the cortex tells us about the world—i t allows us to perc eive sights, sounds, tastes, smells, and textures—th e whole arra y of crea tion. The brain has pull ed an enor mous trick on us, a remarkabl e sleigh t of hand, because there is no direct connect ion between the bod y’s raw data and our subjective sense of an outside world. For all anyone know s, the entir e outside world could be a drea m. When I’m in bed having a drea m, I see a world of events just as vivid as the waking world (for most of us, the other four senses are scatter ed unevenl y throughout our drea ms, but som e dream ers can touch, tast e, hear , and smel l as accura tely as they can while awake). But when I open my eyes in the morn ing, I know that these vivid events were all produced inside my head. I’d never ma ke the m istake of fal ling for this trick because I a lread y assume that dream s aren’ t real. So doe s my brain dedi cate one appar atus to making the drea m world and another to the waking world ? No, it doesn ’t. In terms of cerebral function, the drea m mech anism doesn’ t flick off when I wake up. The sam e visual cortex in the rear of my skull allow s me to see an object—a tree, a face, the sky— whether I am seeing it in memory, in a drea m, in a photo, or standing before me. The locations of brain cell activit y shift slight ly from one to the other, which is why I can distinguish among a dream , a photo, and the real thing, yet the sam e fundam ental process is constant ly taking plac e. I am manufa cturing a tree, a face, or the sky from what is actua lly a random tangl e of spider y nerves shooting bursts of che micals and elec tric al char ges in my brain and all around my bod y. No matter how hard I try, I will never find a single pattern of chem icals and char ges in the shape of a tre e, a fac e, or an y other shape. There is j ust a fire- storm of el ectroch emical activ ity. This embarrassing proble m—that there is no way to prove the existenc e of an outside world—under min es the entire basis of material ism . Thus we arrive at the second spiritu al secre t: You are not in the world; the world is"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"in you. The only reason that rocks are solid is that the brain regist ers a flurr y of electr ical signals as touch; the only reason the sun shines is that the brain regist ers another flurr y of elec tric al signa ls as sight. There is no sunligh t in m y bra in, who se interior rem ains as dark as a li mestone cavern no m atter how brigh t it is outside. Having said tha t the whole world is crea ted in me, I immediately real ize that you could say the sam e thing. Are you in my drea m or am I in yours—or are we all trapp ed in some bizarr e com bina tion of each other ’s personal version of events? To me, this isn’ t a proble m but the very heart of spiri tual ity. Ever yone is a creato r. The mystery of how all these individu al viewpoints som ehow mesh, so that your world and mine can harmoni ze, is the very thing that makes peopl e seek spiritu al answer s. For ther e is no doubt that reali ty is full of confli ct but also full of harm ony. It is ver y liber ating to rea lize that as creators we gener ate ever y aspect, good or bad, of our experien ce. In th is wa y, each of u s is the center of creat ion. People used to find these ideas very natur al. Centur ies ago the doctrin e of one reality occupi ed cent er stage in spiritua l life. Relig ions and peoples and tradi tions varied wildl y, but there was universal agree ment that the world is a seamless creation imbued with one intelligenc e, one creative design. Monotheis m called the one reali ty God; India called it Brah man; China called it the Tao. By any name, ever y person existed within this infini te intelligenc e, and whatev er we did on our own was part of crea tion’ s grand design. A person didn’ t have to beco me a spiri tual seeker to find the one reali ty. Ever ybod y’s life alread y fit into it. The crea tor permeated each partic le of cre ation equall y, and the sam e div ine spark ani mated life in al l its for ms. Toda y we’d call this view mystical because it deals in invisibl e things. But if our ancestors had had acc ess to microscopes, wouldn’ t they have seen concret e proof of their mysticism in the way cells behave? To believ e in an all-e mbracing reality places ever yone at the cent er of existen ce. The mystical symbol for this was a circl e with a dot in the center , signif ying that ea ch indiv idual (the dot) wa s secre tly inf inite (the circle). This is like the tiny cell whose cen tral dot of D NA conne cts it to bil lions of y ears of evolu tion. But is the concept of one reali ty mystical at all? Outside my windo w in winter I can usuall y spy at least one chrysalis dangling from a branch. Inside it a caterpi llar has turned into a pupa that will emer ge in spring as a butterf ly. We are all familiar with this metamorphosis, having witnes sed it as children (or by read ing Eric Carle’ s The Very Hungry Caterpil lar ). But what goes on invisib ly inside the chrysalis remains deep ly mysterious. The caterp illar’s organs and tissues dissolve into an amorphous, soupl ike state, only to reconsti tute into th e structure of a butt erfl y’s bod y tha t bears no rese mblanc e to a caterp illar at all. Scien ce has no idea why metamorphosis evolved. It is almost impossible to imagine that insects hit on it by chance— the che mical complexi ty of turning into a butt erfl y is incredib le; thousands of steps are all minut ely interconn ected. (It’s as if you dropped off a bicycle at the shop to be repaired, and when you came back the parts had beco me a Gulfstre am jet.) But we do have some idea about how this delicat e cha in of events is linked. Two horm ones, one called juvenile hormone, the other ecdysone, regulat e the process, which looks to the naked eye like a caterpil lar dissolving into soup. These two horm ones make sure that the cells moving from larva to butt erfl y know where they are going and how they are to change. Som e cells are told to die; others digest themselves, while still others turn into eyes, antennae, and wings. This implies a fragi le (and miracu lous) rhythm that mus t rem ain in prec ise balance between creation and destruc tion. Tha t rhythm, it turns out, depends on day leng th, which in turn depends on the earth’s rota tion around the sun. Therefore, a cosm ic rhythm has been inti mately conne cted to the birth of butterf lies for m illions of y ears. Scien ce concentr ates on the molecu les, but this is a strik ing exam ple of inte llig ence at work, using molecules as a vehic le for its own intent. The inten t in this case was to crea te a new crea ture without wasting old ingredien ts. (And if there is only one real ity, we can’ t say, as science does, that day length causes the pupa’ s horm ones to begin the metamorphosis into a butt erfl y. Day length and hormon es come from the sam e creat ive source, weaving one reality. Tha t source uses cos mic rhythms or molecules as it sees fit. Day leng th doesn ’t cause horm ones to chang e any more than hor mon es cause the day to change—both are tied to a hidden inte lligen ce that creates both at once. In a drea m or a painting, a boy may hit a baseball, but his bat doesn ’t"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"cause the ball to fl y through the ai r. The whole drea m or painting fits toge ther sea mlessl y.) Here is another exa mpl e: Two che micals called actin and myosin evolv ed eons ago to allow the mus cles in insect wings to contra ct and relax. Thus, insec ts learned to fly. When one of these paired molecules is absen t, wing s wil l grow but the y cannot flap and are therefore useless. Toda y, the same two proteins are responsible for the bea ting of the human heart, and when one is absent, the person’ s heartb eat is inef fici ent and weak, ulti mately leading to heart failure. Again, scien ce m arvels at the wa y molecul es adapt over m illions of y ears, but isn ’t there a deeper intent? In our hearts, we feel the impulse to fly, to break free of boundaries. Isn’ t that the same impulse nature expressed when insec ts began to take flight? The prolac tin that gener ates milk in a mother’s breast is unchanged from the prolact in that sends salm on upstrea m to breed, enabl ing them to cross from saltwa ter to fresh. The insulin in a cow is exact ly the sam e as the insulin in an a moeb a; both serve to m etabol ize carboh ydrates, even though a cow is millions of times more complex than an amoeba. To believe in one real ity that is tota lly inter connect ed isn’t mystical at all, it turns out. How, then, did the belief in one reali ty fall apart? There was another alternat ive, which also put each person at the cen ter of his or her own world. But instead of being included, one feels alone and isola ted, driven by personal desire rather than a shared life force or commun ion through the soul. This is the choice we call ego, although it has been call ed by other nam es, such as the pursuit of pleasure, the bondage of karm a, and (if we resort to a religious vocabular y) banishm ent from paradise. So thoroughl y does it perm eate our culture, following your ego doesn ’t feel like a choice anymore. We’ve all been careful ly trained since childhood in the ways of I, me, and mine. Compe tition teaches us that we have to figh t for what we want. The threat of other egos, who feel as isola ted and alone as we do, is ever present—our desires could be thwart ed if someone else gets there first. I don’ t have an ego-bashing agenda in mind here. Ego bashing looks for a villa in whose actions keep peopl e from finding happiness, which is the underl ying reason why people suffer, why they never find their true self, God, or th e soul. The ego, we are told, blinds us with its constan t de mands, its greed, selfishnes s, and insecurit y. That is a common theme but a mistak en one, bec ause throwing the ego into the dark, making it an enem y, only creat es m ore div ision and frag mentation. If ther e is one real ity, it must be all- inclusive. The ego can’ t be thrown out an y more than desire can be thrown out. The choic e to live in separation— a choice no cell ever makes unless it beco mes canc erous—gave rise to a certa in strain of mythology. Ever y cultur e tells the stor y of a golden age buried in the dim past. This stor y of lost perfec tion debases hum an beings inst ead of exa lting them. People told themse lves that hum an nature must be innat ely flawed, that ever yone wore the scars of sin, that God disapproved of his once- innocent children. A myth has the power to take a choi ce and make it seem like destiny. Separa tion took on a life of its own, but did the possibil ity of one reali ty ever reall y go awa y? To embrace one real ity again, we must accept that the world is in us. This is a spiritua l secret based on the nature of the brain, which spends ever y second manuf actur ing the world. When your best friend calls you on the phone from Tibet, you take for granted that he is far awa y, yet the sound of his voice occurs as a sensation in your brain. If your friend show s up on your doorstep, his voice hasn’ t gotten any closer . It is still a sensation in the sam e part of your brain, and it will remain there after your friend leaves and his voic e ling ers inside you. When you look at a distant star , it too seems far awa y, yet it exists as a sensation in ano ther part of your brain. So the star is in you. The same is true when you taste an orange or touch a velvet cloth or listen to Mozart— ever y possible experienc e is being ma nufac tured inside yourse lf. At this moment, ego-based life is thoroughl y convincing, which is why no amount of pain and suffering drives people to abandon it. Pain hurts, but it doesn’ t sho w a way out. The debate on how to end war , for exam ple, has proved total ly futile bec ause the instant I see myself as an isol ated indiv idual, I confront “them,” the countless other ind ividuals who want what I want. Violenc e is buil t into the oppo sition of us versu s them. “The y” never go awa y and “they” never give up. The y will alwa ys fight to protect their stake in the world. As long as you and I have a separat e stake in the world, the"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"cycle of violen ce will remain perm anen t. The dire resul ts can be seen in the bod y, too. In a hea lthy bod y, ever y cell recogn izes itself in ever y other cell. When this perception goes awr y and cert ain cells beco me “the other ,” the bod y goes on an attack against itse lf. This stat e is known as an auto-immune disorder, of which rheu matoid arthri tis and lupus are devastat ing exa mples. The violenc e of self aga inst self is based entire ly on a mistaken concept, and although medicine can bring some relief to the war-torn bod y, no cure can be ach ieved without correct ing the mistaken concep t first. Gett ing serious about bringing violence to an end means giving up a personal stake in the world, once and for all. That alon e will pluck violence out by the roots. This may sound like a shocking conclusion. One’ s immediat e reac tion is to say, “But I am my personal stake in the world.” Fortunat ely, such isn’t the case. The world is in you, not the other way around. This is what Christ meant when he taught that one should attain the kingdom of God first and worr y about worldl y things later, if at all. God owns ever ything by virtue of having creat ed ever ything. If you and I are crea ting ever y percep tion that we take for real ity, then we are allowed to own our cre ation as well. Perception is the world; the world is pe rception. In that key idea, the drama of us-versu s-th em coll apses. We are all included in the only project that makes any difference : reali ty-making. To defend any outside thing— mone y, propert y, pos sessions, or status—m akes sense only if those things are essent ial. But the material world is an afteref fect. Nothing in it is essentia l. The only personal stake worth having is the abil ity to creat e free ly, with full awareness of how real ity-making works. I feel sympathet ic to those who have exa mined the ego and found it so repugnant that they want to be without ego. But in the end, attacking the ego is just a subtle disguise for atta cking yourse lf. Destro ying the ego would serve no purpose even if it could be ach ieved. It is vita l to keep our entir e crea tive machin ery intact. When you strip awa y its ugly, insecure, violent drea ms, the ego is no longer ugly, insecure, and violen t. It takes its natural place as part of the mystery. The one reality has alread y reveal ed a deep secret : Being a creator is more important than the whole world. It’s worth pausing for a m oment to take that in. In fact, it is th e world. Of all the lib erat ing ideas that cou ld change a person’ s life, this one is perhaps the most free ing. Yet to trul y live it, to be a true crea tor, a grea t deal of condit ioning needs to be broken down. No one remembers being told to believ e in the materia l world. Yet somehow we’ve learned to acc ept ourselves as limited beings. The outside world mus t be far more powerful. It dicta tes the stor yline, not y ou. The world co mes first; you com e a distant second. The outside world will never produce any spiri tual answers until you take on a new role as the manufa cturer of reali ty. Tha t feels strange at first, y et we can alre ady see how a new set of bel iefs is fal ling in to plac e: Everything I am expe riencing reflects myself: Therefore I don’ t have to try and escape. There is nowhere to escape to, and as long as I see m yself as the cre ator of m y real ity, I w ouldn’ t want to escape even if I could. My life is part of every other life: My conne ction to all living things makes it impossibl e that I have ene mies. I feel no need to oppose, resist, conquer , or destro y. I have no need to contr ol anyone or any thing: I can affect change by transfor ming the only thing that I ever had control of in the first pla ce, which is m yself. CHAN GING YO UR REALITY TO ACCO MMO DA TE THE SECON D SECRET To trul y posses s the second secre t, begin to see yourself as a co-cre ator in ever ything that happens to you. One sim ple exerc ise is to sit wherever you are and look around. As your gaz e falls on a chair , a picture, the color of the walls in your room , say to yourself, “This stands for me. This, too, stands for me.” Let your awareness take in ever ything, and now ask y ourself:"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" Do I see order or disorder ? Do I see my uniqueness? Do I see how I rea lly fee l? Do I see what I real ly want ? Some things in your environ ment will speak instan tly to these questions whil e others won’ t. A bright, cheerful ly pain ted apar tmen t open to the ligh t stands for a very different state of mind than a dark base ment effici enc y. Yet a clut tered desk piled high with papers cou ld stand for quite a few things: inner disorder , fear of meeting one’ s obligat ions, accep ting too much responsibil ity, ignoring mund ane details, and so on. This inconsistenc y is valid because we each express and at the same time hide who we are. Som e of the time you express who you are, while at other times you deta ch from your real feelings, den y them, or find outle ts that feel socially accep table. If that sofa was bought just because it was cheap and you decid ed to make do, if the wall color is white because you didn’ t care what color you looked at, if you’re afraid to throw out a picture because your in- laws gave it to you as a present, you are still seeing symbols of how you feel. Without dwel ling on details, it’s pos sible to scan someone ’s personal space and fairl y accurat ely discern if that person is satisfied or dissatisfied with life, has a strong or weak sense of personal identi ty, is a conform ist or nonconfor mist, values order over chaos, feels opt imistic or hopel ess. Now step into your social world. When you are with your family or friends, listen with your inner ear to what is going on. Ask y ourse lf: Do I hear happiness? Does being with these people ma ke m e feel aliv e, aler t? Is th ere an undertone of fat igue? Is th is just a fa miliar routin e, or are these peopl e real ly responding to each other ? However you answer these questions, you are assessing your world and what is going on inside you. Other people, like the objects in your surroundings, are a mirror . Now turn on the evening news, and instead of watching it as if events are happening “out there, ” tune in personall y. Ask y ourself : Does th is w orld I see feel safe or unsafe ? Do I fee l the fear and dism ay of a disaste r, or a m I just being titillated and entert ained? When the new s is bad, a m I stil l watching basical ly to be enter tained? Which part of me doe s this program stand for? The part that dwel ls on one proble m after another or the part that wants to find answers ? This exercise develops a new kind of awareness. You begin to break the habi t of seeing yourself as an isolat ed, separate enti ty. The realiz ation dawn s th at the whole world is ac tuall y nowhere but insid e you."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" Exercise #2: Bring ing Home the World To say that you are a crea tor isn’ t the sam e as to say that your ego is. The ego will alwa ys remain attached to your personalit y, and certain ly your personali ty doesn’ t create ever ything around you. Creat ion doesn’ t happen on that level. Let ’s see, then, if we can get closer to the real crea tor inside you. We’ll do this by meditating on a rose. Get a beau tiful red rose and hold it in front of you. Inhale the fragran ce and say to yourse lf, “W ithout me, this flower would have no fragrance.” Take in the glowing crimson color and say to yourse lf, “W ithout me, this flower would have no color .” Stroke the velvet y peta ls and say to yourself, “W ithou t me, this flower would have no texture.” Rea lize that if you subtract yourself from any sensation—sight, sound, touch, tast e, sme ll— the rose would be nothing but atom s vibra ting in a void. Now consider the DNA tha t is inside each cell of the rose. Visual ize the billions of ato ms strung along a double helix and say to yourself, “M y DNA is looking at the DNA in this flower . The experien ce is not an observer looking at an object. DNA in one form is looking at DNA in another form .” Now see the DNA begin to shimmer and turn into invisibl e vibra tions of ener gy. Say to yourse lf, “The rose has vanished into its primal ener gy. I have vanished into my pri mal ener gy. No w onl y one ener gy field is looking at ano ther ener gy field.” Finall y, see the boundar y between your ener gy and the rose’ s ener gy fade as one set of waves merges into another , like ocean waves rising and fall ing on the vast surface of an endless sea. Say to yourse lf, “All ener gy com es from one source and returns to it. When I look at a rose, a tiny flicker of infini ty is rising fro m the source to experi ence itself.” Having followed this trai l, you have arrived at what is tru ly real : An infin ite, silent ener gy field flick ered for an instant, exper iencing an object (the rose) and a sub ject (you the observer) without going anywhere. Awareness sim ply took a look at one aspect of its eternal beaut y. Its only motive was to crea te a moment of joy. You and the rose stood at opposite poles of tha t moment, yet there was no separa tion. A single crea tive stroke took place, fusing you both. Secret #3 FOUR P ATHS LEAD TO UNIT Y ALL THE SPIRITU AL SECRETS from this point on, mean ing the vast majorit y, depend on your accepting the existenc e of one real ity. If you still think of it as a pet idea held by someon e else, your experi ence of life won ’t change. One reality isn’ t an idea—it is a doorwa y into a com pletel y new way to part icipa te in life. Imagine a passenger on an airp lane who doesn’ t know that flight exists. As the plan e takes off he panics, think ing such thoughts as “W hat’s holding us up? Wha t if this plane is too heav y? Air weighs nothing, and this whole plane is made of steel!” Thrown back on his own percept ions, the pani cked passenger loses all sense of being in control ; he is trapped in an exper ienc e that could be leading to disaste r. In the cockpi t the pilot feels more in control bec ause he’s been trained to fly. He knows the aircraft; he understands the plane’ s controls that he work s. Therefore he has no reason to pan ic, even though in the back of his mi nd th e danger of me chani cal failure is alwa ys present. Disaster could occu r, but tha t is out of his control. Now move on to the designer of jet planes, who can build any craft he wants based on the prin ciple of flight. He occupies a position of grea ter con trol than the pilot because if he kept on exper imen ting with various designs, he could com e up with a plane that is incapab le of crashing (perhaps som e kind of glider with an airfo il that never stal ls, no ma tter what angle of dive the plane goes into). This progres sion from passenger to pilot to designer is s ymbolic of a spiri tual journe y. The passenger is trapped"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"in the world of the five senses. He can perc eive fligh t only as impossible bec ause when steel is com pared to air, it only seems cap able of fall ing through it. The pilot know s the princip les of flight, which transcend the five senses b y going to a deeper law of natur e (the Bernoulli princip le), which dicta tes that air flowing over a curved surfac e crea tes lift. The design er transcends even further by coaxing the laws of nature to arrive at an intended effect. In other words, he is closest to the source of reality, acting not as a vict im of the five senses or a passive partic ipant in natur al law but as a co-cre ator with nature. You can take this journe y yourself. It is more than symbolic because the brain, which is alread y manuf acturing ever y sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell that you experien ce, is a quantu m machine. Its atoms are in dire ct contac t with the laws of nature, and through the magic of consciousness, when you have a desire, your brain is sending a signal to the very source of natur al law . The simp lest defini tion of consciousnes s is awaren ess; the two are synon ymous. One time at a business conference an execu tive came up to me dem anding a defin ition of consciousness that was prac tica l and concrete. At first I wanted to reply that consciousness can’ t be defined concret ely, but I found m yself blurting out, “ Consciousness is the poten tial for all crea tion.” His fac e brighten ed as he suddenl y got it. The mor e consciousness you have, the more potenti al you have to crea te. Pure consciousness, because it underli es ever ything, is pure poten tial. You need to ask yourself this question: Do you want to be a vict im of the five senses or a co-cre ator? Here are how th e options look. ON THE WAY TO CREA TION • Depending on the five senses: Separa tion, duali ty, ego-based, subject to fear , detached from the source, limited in ti me and space. • Depending on natural law: In contro l, less sub ject to fear, taps into natura l resources, inven tive, understanding, explores the reaches of t ime and space. • Depending on conscious ness: Creativ e, intimate with natural law , close to the source, boundaries dissolve, inten tions turn in to results, be yond time and space. Awareness is all that changes in the journe y from separation to the one real ity. When you depend on your five senses, you are aware of the physical world as primar y reality. In such a world you must come second because you see yourse lf as a solid object made up of atoms and molecu les. The only role your awareness has is to look upon the world “out there. ” The five senses are extr emely dec eptiv e. The y tell us that the sun rises in the east and sets in the west, that the earth is flat, that an object made of steel couldn’ t possibl y be held up by air. The next stage of awaren ess depends upon laws of nature that are arrived at by thinking and experi menting. The observer is no longer a vict im of dec eption. He can figure out the law of gravit y using mathematics and though t experi ments. (Newton didn’ t have to sit under a tree and have an actua l apple fall on his head—h e could perform a thought experi ment using images and the numbers that match those imag es. This was the process he followed, as did Einstein by imagining how rela tivi ty worked.) When the human brain considers the laws of nature, the material world is still “out there” to be explored. More power is gained over nature, but if this level of awareness was the ulti mate one (as many scient ists think it is), utopia would be a te chnologic al triu mph. However , the brain can’ t set itself aside foreve r. The laws of natur e that keep airplan es in the air also app ly to ever y elec tron in the brain. Eventua lly som eone has to ask, “Who am I who is doing all this thinking?” That’ s"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"the question that leads to pure awareness. For if you empt y the brain of al l thoughts (as in a stat e of m editation), awareness turns out not to be empt y, void, and passive. Beyond the limits of time and space, one process—and only one—is taking place. Crea tion is creating itself, using consciousness as its modeling clay. Consciousness turns into things in the object ive world, into exper iences in the subjective world. Break any experienc e down to its most basic elemen t, and what you get are invisibl e ripples in the quantum field ; break down any object into its most basic element, and what you get is also a rippl e in the quantu m field. There is no difference, and by a stroke of suprem e magic, the hum an brain doesn’ t have to stand outside the crea tive process. Just by paying atten tion and having a desire, y ou flip on the switch of creat ion. You flip it on, tha t is, if you kno w what you’re doing. The vic tim of the five senses (pre-scient ific man) and the explorer of the laws of nature (scient ists and philosophers) are just as crea tive as someon e experien cing pure awareness (sages, saints, sha mans, siddhas, sorcerers—pi ck any label you want). But they believe in limitations that are self-i mposed. And because they do, those limitations turn into reality. The glor y of the spiritua l journe y is the same as its iron y: You acquire full power only by real izing that you have been using that power all along to thwart yourself. You are potenti ally the prisoner , the jailer, and the hero who opens the prison, all rolled into one. Instinc tive ly we knew this all along. In fair y tales there is a magical connection between victi ms and heroes. The frog knows he is a prince, need ing only the magic touch to rega in his true status. Mo st fair y tales put the vict im in peril, unable to break the spell until the magic is delivered from outside. The frog needs a kiss; the sleeping princess needs som eone to break through the wall of thorns; Cindere lla needs a fair y godm other with a magic wand. Fair y tales symboliz e a belief in magic that wells up from the most ancient parts of our brain, but they also lamen t tha t we are not ma sters of this ma gic. This dile mma has frustra ted ever yone who has tried to embra ce the one reality. Even when wisdo m is gain ed and you real ize that your own brain is producing ever ything around you, finding the contro l switch to crea tion is elusive. But there is a way. Behind any experi ence is an experien cer who know s what is happening. When I find a way to stand where the experi encer is standing, I will be at the still point around which the whole world turns. Getting there is a process that starts here and now. Ever y exper ience comes to us in one of four ways: as a feeling, a thought, an action, or simpl y a sense of being. At unexpect ed moments the experienc er is more present in these four things than usual. When that happens, we feel a change, a slight difference from our ordinar y reali ty. Here is a list of such subtle changes taken from a notep ad I kept by my side for several weeks: FEELINGS A lightn ess in my bod y. A strea ming or flowing sen sation in my bod y. A sense tha t all is well, that I a m at hom e in the world. A fee ling of co mplet e peac efulness. A sensation of com ing to rest, as if a speed ing car has glided to a hal t. A fee ling of l anding in a soft plac e where I a m safe. A fee ling th at I a m not what I seem to be, that I have been pla ying a part tha t isn’ t the real me . A fee ling th at so meth ing li es be yond the sky or behind the mirror . THI NKIN G “I know mo re than I think I do.”"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" “I need to find out what’s real.” “I need to find out who I rea lly am.” My mind is beco ming less restl ess; it wants to cal m down. My inn er voices have beco me ver y quie t. My internal dialogu e has suddenl y stopped. ACTIO NS I sudden ly sense that my act ions are not my own. I sen se a greater power act ing through m e. My actions see m to s ymbolize who I a m and w hy I’m here. I am acting out of com plete integri ty. I gave up contro l and what I wanted si mpl y came to m e. I gave up the struggle, and instead of falling apart, things got bet ter. My actions are part of a plan I can barel y glimpse, but I kno w it must ex ist. BEIN G I reali ze th at I a m cared for . I reali ze th at m y life has purpo se, th at I m atter. I sen se that random events are not rando m but for m subtle pat terns. I see that I am uniqu e. I reali ze th at life has the abil ity to run itself. I feel drawn to the cen ter of things. I reali ze with wonder that life is infinit ely worthwhil e. This may seem like a very abstra ct list because ever ything on it is about awareness. I didn’ t record the thousands of other thoughts, feelings, and actions that cen tered on outside things. Of course, like ever yone else, I was thinking about my next appoint ment or rushing to it, feeling harried in traf fic, being happ y or out of sorts, confused or cert ain, focused or distrac ted. All of that is like the conten ts of a mental suitcase. People stuf f their suitcases with thousand s of th ings. Yet awareness is not a suitc ase, nor is it the things you stu ff inside. Awareness is just itself—pur e, alive, alert, silent, and full of potent ial. Som etimes you come close to experien cing that pure state, and at these times one of the hints I’ve listed, or something sim ilar, com es to the surfac e instead of lying hidden out of sight. Som e hints are palpabl e; they arise as undeni able sensations in the bod y. Others arise at a subtle level that is difficult to verbal ize: a shiver of something unexpect edly catches your atten tion. If you notice even one such hint, you have in your hand a thread that could lead beyond thought,"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"feeling, or action. If there is only one reali ty, ever y clue must lead eventua lly to the same place where the laws of creat ion opera te free ly, which is a waren ess itself. Once you start out with a pro mis ing hint, how can you wrest free fro m the ego’ s grip ? The ego fierce ly protec ts its view of the world, and we’ve all exper ienced how wisp y and fleeting any experi ence can be when it doesn’ t fit our ingr ained belief system. Sir Kenneth Clark, the renowned English art histori an, recounts in his autobiograph y abou t an epiph any in a church when he suddenl y real ized, with total clar ity, that an all- embrac ing presence was filling him . He sensed beyond though t a reality that was subli me, filled with light, loving, and sacred. At that moment he had a choice : He could pursue this transc endenta l reali ty or he could go back to art. He chose art, without apolog y. Art, even if it fell far short of higher reali ty, was Clark’ s earthly love. He was choosing one infin ity over another— the infin ity of beautifu l objects over the infini ty of invisib le awaren ess. (There is a witt y cartoon showing a fingerpost standing at the fork of a trai l. One sign points toward “God,” the other toward “Discu ssions about God.” In this case the signs could be chang ed to “God” and “Pictur es of God.”) Man y other people have made similar choi ces. In order to displace the physical world you alread y know , a hint mus t expand. The threads of exper ienc e must weave a new patt ern because, as separate strands, they are too fragile to co mpete with the fam iliar dra ma of ple asure and pain that grips all of u s. Con sider the list aga in. The boundar ies between the categories are blurr y. Ther e is only the slight est differenc e between feeling that I am safe, for exa mple, and knowing that I am safe. Fro m this I can proce ed to acting as if I am safe until final ly I realize, withou t a doubt, that my whole exist ence has been safe since I was born: I am safe. In pract ical term s, this is what it means to weave a whole new pattern. If I take any other item from the list, I can weave si milar interconn ections. As I draw thought, feel ing, act ion, and being toge ther , the experi encer beco mes mor e real ; I am learn ing to put myself in his place. Then I can test this new reality to see if it has enough strength to repla ce an older , outworn pic ture of m yself. You might want to pause for a momen t and do just that : Choo se any item that speaks to you—a sensation or thought you can remember having— and connec t it to the other three categories. Let’ s say you pick “I see that I am unique.” Uniqueness means that there is no one else who is exact ly like you. Wha t feeling would go with that reali zation? Perhaps a fee ling of strength and self- estee m, or a sensation of being like a flower with its own unique scent, form , and color. Ther e is also the sensation of standing out from the crowd and being proud that you do. The thought might then come, “I don’ t have to imitate anybod y else.” With this thought you might begin to feel free of other people’ s opin ions about you. Fro m this, a desire arises to act with integrit y, to show the world that you know who you are. Thus, from one tiny sensation a whole new patt ern emer ges; you have found the path of expanded awareness. If you pursue a momentary glimpse of awareness, you will see how quickl y it expands; a single thre ad leads to a complex tapestr y. Yet this metaphor cannot exp lain how to change reali ty itse lf. To ma ster pure awareness, y ou mus t learn how to liv e it. When an exper ience is so powerful that it motivat es people to change the whole pattern of their lives, we call that a breakthrough, or an epiphan y. The value of an epiphan y doesn ’t lie just in some new or exci ting insight. You might be walking down the street and pass a strange r. Your eyes meet, and for som e reason there is a connect ion. It isn’t sexual or rom anti c or even a suspic ion that this person could mean something in your life. Instead, the epiphan y is that you are that stranger— your experien cer merges with his. Call this a feeling or a thought, it doesn’ t matter which— it’s the sudden expansion that counts. You are flung outside your narrow boundaries, if only for a moment, and that makes all the differen ce. You have tasted a hidden dim ension. Com pared to the habit of shutting yourself behind the walls of ego, this new dimension feels freer and lighte r. You have a sense that your bod y can’ t contain you anymore. Another exa mple: When you watch a young child who is playing with compl ete focus and yet total ly carefr ee, it’s hard not to feel a tug. Doesn’ t the child’ s innocen ce seem palpabl e at that moment? Can’ t you feel in yourse lf—or yearn to feel—the same delight in play? Doesn ’t the child’s tiny bod y seem as fragil e as a soap bubble and yet bursting with life itself, som ething immense, eternal, never to be defeat ed? In a fascina ting text call ed the Shiva Sutras, which dates back centuries in India, one can find sim ilar epiph anies. Each one is a"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"sudden glimpse of freedom in which the underl ying experienc er is direc tly confronted, withou t interferenc e. One looks at a beautifu l woman and suddenl y one sees beaut y itse lf. Or one looks at the sky and suddenl y one sees an infini ty beyond. No one else, however much you love and adore the person, sees the true significan ce of your priv ate epiphani es. The secret belongs to you, with you, in you. In the title Shiva Sutra, the word Shiva means “God” and the word Sutra means “thread,” so quit e del iberat ely the reader is being shown tiny thr eads that lead back to the et ernal source. There is a wider cont ext for the Shiva Sutras, which requires following the path that is opened up by an epiphan y. In the Vedic trad ition, each person can choose four paths that arise from feeling, thinking, acting, and being. Each path is call ed a Yoga, the Sanskrit word for “union,” because unit y—mer ging with one reality—was the goal. Over the ages, the four Yogas have come to define specific paths that suit the kind of temperamen t a seeker has, al though in tru th y ou can follow several or all at once: Bhakti Yoga leads to unit y by loving God. Karma Yoga leads to unit y through selfless action. Gyana Y oga leads to unit y through knowledge. Raj Yoga leads to unit y through m editation and renunciat ion. Litera lly transla ted, the fourth path, Raj Yoga, means “the royal way to union.” What makes it royal is a belief that meditation transcends the other three paths. But the fourth path is also inclusive: By following it you are actua lly following all four at once. Your meditations go direct ly to the essenc e of your being. Tha t essenc e is what love of G od, selfl ess ac tion, and knowledge are trying to reach. It’s not nec essar y to think of the four paths as being Eastern. These Yogas were the origin al seeds, the means that brought unit y within reach. Ever yone has feel ings, so ever yone can be on the path of feel ing. The same is true for thinking, acting, and being. So the vision of Yoga is simp ly that unit y is possibl e for anyone, starting from wherev er you happen to be. Indeed, unit y is secre tly present in ever y moment of dail y life. Nothing can happen to me tha t is outside the one reali ty; noth ing is wasted or rando m in the cosm ic design. Let ’s look at how ea ch path is actua lly lived: Feeling points the way whenever you experienc e and express love. On this path your personal emotions expand to beco me all-enco mpassing. Love of self and family merges into love of hum anity. In its highest expression, your love is so powerful that it calls upon God to show himself (or herself) to you. The yearning heart finds ulti mate peace by uniting with the heart of creat ion. Thinking points the way whenever your mind stops being rest less and speculat ive. On this path, you silenc e your internal dialogue in order to find clarit y and stilln ess. It takes clar ity for your mind to see that it doesn’ t have to be so driven. Thinking can turn into knowing, which is to say wisdom. With greater clarit y your inte llec t looks into any proble m and sees the solution. As your kno wingness expands, personal questions fade. What your mind really wants to kno w is the mystery of existence. Quest ions knock on the door of eterni ty, at which point only the Creator can answer them for you. The fulfill ment of this path com es when your mind merges with th e m ind of G od. Action points the way whenev er you surrender . On this path your ego’ s con trol over action is loosened. Your actions stop being motivat ed by selfish wants and wishes. At the beginning, it is inescapabl e that you will be acting for yourse lf because, even if you try to be com pletely selfl ess, you will be earn ing personal satisfact ion. In time, however , action detaches from the ego. Doing beco mes motivated by a force outside yourself. This universal force is call ed Dharma in Sanskrit. The path of action is summed up in a phrase: Karm a gives way to"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Dharma. In other word s, personal atta chm ent to your own actions is turned into nonat tach ment through perform ing God’ s actions. This path reaches its fulf illment when your surrender is so complete that God runs ever ything you do. Being points the way whenev er you cult ivat e a self beyond ego. At the outset the sense of “I” is attached to fragm ents of your real identi ty. “I” is an accu mulat ion of ever ything that has happen ed to you since you were born. This shallow identi ty gets exposed as an illusion, a mask that hides a much grea ter “I” existing in ever yone. Your real identi ty is a sense of exist ence pure and simpl e, which we’ll call “I am.” All creatur es share the same “I am,” and fulfi llment occurs when your being embra ces so much that God is also included in your sense of being al ive. Unit y is a state in which noth ing is left out of “I am .” Yoga is seen in the West as a renuncian t’s path, a way of life that demands giving up fam ily and posses sions. Wander ing yogis with their begg ing bowls, of the kind that used to be seen in ever y village in India, symbolize such a life. But outer trapp ings don’ t signif y renuncia tion, which happens on the inside no matter how much or how little you posses s materially. Interna lly, a crucia l dec ision is made : I am starting over. In other word s, you renounce your old percept ions, not y our posses sions. When your heart grow s sick of the violen ce and divisiveness in the world, start ing over is the only choi ce. You stop looking at the reflec tions and turn instead to the source. The universe, like any mirror , is neutr al. It reflec ts back whatever is in front of it, without judgment or distor tion. If you can trust that, then you have taken the crucia l step of renunci ation. You’ve renounced the belief that the outer world has power over you. As with ever ything else on th e path to unit y, living this truth is w hat will ma ke it true. CHAN GING YO UR REALITY TO ACCO MMO DA TE THE THIRD SECRET Finding a path back to your source is a matter of letting life settle down to where it wants to be. There are gross and subtle levels of ever y experi ence, and the subtler leve ls are more sensitive, awake, and meaningful than the gross. As an exercise, begin to observe when you touch upon subtle levels in your own awareness. Notice how these fee l co mpar ed to the gros ser levels. For exa mple: To lov e som eone is s ubtl er than to resent or pu sh the person awa y. To ac cept someone is subtler than to crit iciz e the individua l. To pro mote pea ce is subtler than to prom ote anger and violence. To see someon e without judg men t is subtler than to criti cize the per son. If you let yourself feel it, the subtler side of each experienc e puts the mind at ease, decr eases stre ss, and results in less restless thinking and less pressure at the emotional lev el. Subtle experi ence is quiet and harm onious. You feel settled ; you aren’ t in confli ct with an yone else. There is no overb lown dram a or even an y need for it. Once you have identif ied it, begin to favor the subtle side of your life. Value this level of awareness—onl y if you valu e it will it grow . If you favor the grosser levels instead, the world will reflec t your percep tion back to you: It will alwa ys remain divisive, disturb ing, stressful, and thre atening. The choi ce is yours to make at the level of consciousness because, in the infin ite diversit y of creat ion, ever y percept ion gives rise to a world that mirrors it. Exercise #2: Medi tation Any experien ce that brings you into conta ct with the silen t level of awaren ess can be called meditation. You may have spontaneousl y hit upon a routin e that allow s you to exper ience a deep settl ing in your mind. If you"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"haven’ t yet, then you might adopt one of the more form al meditation practi ces that appear in ever y spiritua l tradi tion. The sim plest, perhaps, is breathing meditation, as follows: Sit quie tly with your eyes closed in a roo m with the ligh ts low and no distra ctions from the telephone or knocks at the door . Shut your eyes for a few minutes; then becom e aware of your breath ing. Let your atten tion follow your breath as it gentl y, natural ly draws inward. Do the same as the brea th flows outward. Don ’t make any attempt to brea the with a certa in rh ythm and don’ t try to m ake your breath deep or shallow . By following your brea th you are align ing yourself with the mind- bod y connect ion, the subtle coord ination of thought and Prana, the subtle ener gy cont ained in the breath. Some people find it easier to stay with their breathing if they repe at a sound: one syllable for the out breath, one for the inner . Ah-Hum is a tradit ional sound usefu l for this purpose. (You can also adopt the seed mantr as or ritua l sound s as describ ed in any text on Eastern spiri tual teach ings.) Perfor m this meditation for 10 to 20 minut es twic e a day. You will beco me aware of your bod y relaxing. Since mos t people are storing massive amounts of fatigue and stres s, you may even fall asleep. Don’ t worr y about this, or about any sensation or though t that crops up as your mind grows quiet er. Rely on the bod y’s natural tendenc y to release stres s. This is a gentle meditation that has no nega tive side effects or dangers as long as you are health y. (If you feel pain anywh ere or a repea ted sense of discom fort, these may be symptoms of undiagnosed il lness; in that case, should such feelings persist, y ou need to ask for me dical help.) The relax ing effect will continu e, yet you will also begin to notice that you are more self-aware. You may gain a sudden insight or inspiration. You may start to feel more centered ; sudden spurts of ener gy or aler tness may occur . These effects vary from person to person, so be open to whatever comes. The overal l purpo se of meditation is the sam e for ever yone, however : You are learning to rela te to awareness itse lf, the purest level of experien ce. Secret #4 WHA T YO U SEEK, YO U ALREA DY ARE WHEN I TUR NED TWENTY -ONE as a medical student in New Delhi I had my cho ice of two kinds of friends. The materialist ic kind got out of bed at noon and went to all-nigh t parties where ever yone drank Coca- Cola and danced to Beatl es records. The y had discovered cigaret tes and wom en, perhaps even bootl eg liquor , which was much cheaper than impor ted Scotch. The spiritua l kind got up at dawn to go to tem ple—about the time the materialists were staggering home with hangovers—and they ate rice out of a bowl and drank water or tea, usual ly out of the sa me bowl. It didn’ t seem strange at the time that all the materialists were Indians and all the spiri tual types were Western ers. The Indians couldn’ t wait to leav e home and go som eplac e where Coca- Cola, good tobacco, and legal whiske y were cheap and plentifu l. The Westerners kept asking where the real holy men were in India, the kind who could levi tate and hea l lepers by touching them. As it happen ed, I ran with the materialists, who were all around m e in class. Nobod y who was actu ally born in India ever saw him self the other wa y, as a seeker . Toda y I wouldn’ t have two types to choose from—ever yone around me seem s to be a seeker . In my mind, seeking is anoth er word for chasing after something. My Indian classmates had the easier chase because it doesn ’t take much to get mon ey and materi al things, whereas the spiri tual types from the West almost never found their holy men. I used to think that the proble m was due to how rare holy men actuall y are; now I realize that what defea ted their thirst for a higher life was tied up in the act of seeking itself. Tactics that will succ essfull y get you whiske y and Beat les records fai l miserab ly when y ou chase holiness. The spiritu al secre t that appli es here is this: What you seek, you already are. Your awaren ess has its source in"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"unit y. Instead of seeking outside y ourself, go to the source and reali ze who y ou are. Seeking is a word often appl ied to the spiri tual path, and many people are proud to call themse lves seekers. Often, they are the sam e peopl e who once chased too hard after mone y, sex, alcohol, or work. With the sam e addict ive intensit y they now hope to find God, the soul, the higher self. The proble m is that seeking begins with a false assumpt ion. I don’ t mean the assumpt ion that materia lism is corrupt and spiri tuali ty is pure. Yes, materialism can beco me all-consu ming, but that’s not the really impor tant point. Seeking is doom ed because it is a chase that takes you outside yourself. Whether the object is God or mone y makes no real differenc e. Productive seeking requir es that you throw out all assumptions that there is a prize to be won. This means acting withou t hope of rising to some ideal self, hope being a wish that you’ll get som ewhere bett er than the place you started from . You are starting from yourself, and it’s the self that conta ins all the answers. So you have to give up on the idea that you must go from A to B. There is no linear path when the goal isn’ t somewhere else. You must also discard fixed judgm ents about high and low , good and evil, holy and profane. The one reali ty includes ever ything in its tangl e of experi ences, and what we are trying to find is the exper iencer who is present no m atter what experi ence you are having. Looking at the people who race around trying to be models of goodness, someon e coined the apt phrase “spiritua l materialis m,” the transfer of values that work in th e m ateria l world over to the spiritu al world. SPIRITUAL MATERIALISM Pitfalls of the See ker Knowing where you’re going. Struggling to get th ere. Using so meone else’ s m ap. Working to i mprove yourse lf. Setting a ti metab le. Waiting for a miracle. There’ s no bet ter way to be a genuin e seeker than to avo id these pitfal ls. • Don’t know where you’re going. Spiritua l growth is spontaneous. The big events come along unexpect edly, and so do the smal l ones. A single word can open your heart; a single glance can tell you who you real ly are. Awakening doesn’ t happen accord ing to the plan. It’s much more like putting together a jigsaw puzzle without kno wing the finished pictur e in advan ce. The Buddhists have a saying, “If you meet the Buddha on the path, kill him,” which means if you’re following a spiritua l script written in advance, bur y it. All you can imag ine in advance are i mages, and i mages are never the sam e as the goal. • Don’t struggle to get there. If there were a spiri tual payoff at the end of the trail, like a pot of gold or the key to heaven, ever yone would work as hard as possible for the reward. Any struggl e would be worth it. But does it help a two-y ear-old to struggle to beco me three? No, because the process of child develop ment unfolds from within. You don ’t get a paycheck; you turn into a new person. The same is true for spiri tual unfolding. It happens just as natur ally as childhood develop ment, but on the plan e of awareness rather than in the realm of physiology."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" • Don’t follow someone else’s map. Ther e was a time when I was certa in that deep medita tion using one spec ific mantra for the rest of my life was the key to reaching enlighten ment. I was following a map laid down thousands of years ago by venerab le sages who belonged to India ’s greatest spiritua l tradi tion. But caut ion is alwa ys required : If you follow someone else’ s map, you could be train ing yourself in a fixed way of thinking. Fixed ways, even those devo ted to spiri t, are not the sam e as being free. You should glean teach ings from all direct ions, keeping true to those that bring progress y et remaining open to chang es in y ourself. • Don’t make this a self-improvemen t project. Self-i mprov ement is real. People get stuck in bad places that they can learn to get out of. Depression, lonelin ess, and insecurit y are tangible exper ienc es that can be improved. But if you seek to reach God or enlighten ment because you want to stop being depres sed or anxious, if you want great er self-este em or less lone liness, your search may never end. This area of understanding isn’t cut- and-dried. Som e people feel tremendousl y self- improved as their awareness expands; but it takes a strong sense of self to confront the many obstacl es and chal lenges that lie on the path. If you feel weak or fragil e, you may feel weaker and more fragil e when you confront the shadow ener gies within. Expanded awareness com es at a price— you have to give up your limitations—and for anyone who feels victi mized, that limitation is often so stubborn tha t spiritual progress becom es very slow. To the exten t that you feel any deep conflic t inside yourse lf, a large hurdle stands before you on the path. The wise thing is to seek help at the leve l where the proble m exists. • Don’t set yourself a timetable. I’ve met count less people who gave up on spiritua lity because they didn’ t reach their goa ls fast enough. “I gave it ten years. What can I do? Life is only so long. I’m moving on.” More like ly they devoted just one year or a month to being on the path, and then the weekend warriors fell awa y, discouraged by lack of results. The best way to avoid disappoint ment is not to set a deadl ine in the first place, although many peopl e find this difficul t to do without losing motiva tion. But motivation was never going to get them ther e in the first place. Disciplin e is involved, no doubt, in rem embering to meditate regul arly, to keep up Yoga class, to read inspiring texts, and to keep your vision before you. Gett ing into the spiritua l habit requir es a sense of dedica tion. But unless the vision is unfolding ever y day, you will inev itab ly get distract ed. Rather than a timetab le, give yourself support for spiritu al growth. This can be in the form of a personal teacher , a discus sion group, a partner who shares the path with you, regular retrea ts, and keeping a dail y journal. You will be m uch less likel y to fal l pre y to disappoint ment. • Don’t wait for a miracle. It reall y doesn ’t matter how you define miracle— whether it is the sudden appearan ce of perfe ct love, a cure for a life- threa tening disease, anoint ment from a great spiritu al lead er, or perm anen t and ever lasting bliss. A miracle is letting God do all the work; it separa tes the superna tural world from this world, with the expe ctation that one day the supernatur al world will noti ce you. Since there is only one real ity, your task is to break through boundaries of division and separa tion. Watch ing and wai ting for a miracle keeps the boundari es up. You are ever at a rem ove from God, connect ed to hi m by wishful think ing. If you can avoid these pitfalls of spiri tual materialis m, you will be much less tempted to chase after an impossible goal. The chase began because peopl e came to believe that God, disapprov ing of what he sees in us, expects us to adopt a certa in ideal. It seems impossible to imagine a God, however loving, who doesn’ t get disappointed, angr y, vengefu l, or disgusted with us when we fall short. The most spiritua l figures in histor y were not totally good, however , but total ly human. The y acc epted and forgave; they lack ed judgm ent. I think the highest forgiveness is to accept that creation is thoroughl y tangled, with ever y possible quali ty given some outle t for expression. People need to accept once and for all that there is only one life and each of us is free to shape it through the choices we make. Seeking can’ t get anyone out of the tang le because everyth ing is tang led up. The onl y thing tha t will ever be pure and pristine is y our own a waren ess, once y ou sort it out."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":" It’s much easier to keep up the fight between good and evil, holy and profane, us and them. But as awareness grows, these oppo sites begin to calm down in their clashes, and som ething else emerges—a world you feel at hom e in.

Awareness offers an alt ernat ive be yond the fra y. Last nigh t in bed, I was drea ming. The usual kinds of drea m images were passing back and forth ; I don’ t rem ember much what they were. All at once I beca me aware of the sound of breath ing in my drea m. After a second I real ized that it was my wife, who was mov ing in her sleep beside me. I knew that I was hearing her, and yet I also knew that I was drea ming at the same time. For a few seconds I was in both worlds, and then I woke up. Sitting up in bed, I had the strange sensation that it was no long er impor tant that a drea m isn’t real. Being awake is more real than a drea m only because we have agreed that it is. Actua lly, the sound of my wife breathing is in m y head, whether I am drea ming or not. How, then, could I te ll one from the other? Someone e lse must be watching. An observer was aware without getting caugh t up in being awake, asleep, or drea ming. Most of the time I am so caught up in waking, sleep ing, and drea ming that I have no other perspec tive. The silen t observer is the simp lest version of me , the one tha t just is. If you strip awa y all the distract ions of life, som ething yet remains that is you. This version of yourself doesn ’t have to think or drea m; it doesn’ t need sleep to feel rested. There is real joy in find ing this version of yourself because it is alread y at home. It lives above the fray, totally untouch ed by the war of opposites. When people say that they are seeking, it’s this level of themselves that is calling to them in its silent, untroubled way. Seeking is rea lly just a wa y of winning y ourself back. But to win yourself back you have to get as close to zero as possible. At its very core, reali ty is pure existenc e. Meet yourself there and you will be able to creat e anything in exist ence. The “I am” conta ins all that is needed for ma king a world, even though by itself it consists of nothing but a silent witn ess. You’ve alread y undertaken the exer cise of look ing at a rose and breaking it down from the level of a physical object to the leve l of ener gy vibr ating in empt y space. The other side of that exer cise consisted of seeing that your brain can also be understood the sa me wa y. So w hen y ou are seeing a rose, is nothing looking at nothing ? So it would seem, but the real pheno menon is more amazing : You are look ing at yourself. One part of your awareness, which you call yourself, is gaz ing upon itse lf in the form of a rose. There is no solid core to eith er the object or the observer . There is no person inside your head, only a swirl of water , salt, sugar , and a handful of other che micals like potassiu m and sodiu m. This whirlpool of a brain is alwa ys flowing, and thus ever y experien ce is swept along in curren ts and eddies as swiftl y as a mounta in strea m. So, where is the silent observer located if not in my brain ? Neurologists have found locations for all kinds of mental states. No matter what a person is exper iencing—d epression, ela tion, creativ ity, halluc inat ion, amnesia, para lysis, sexual longing, or anything else—the brain displa ys a signature pattern of activi ty scatter ed acros s various locat ions. Yet there is no locat ion or pat tern for th e person having these experi ences. The person could be nowhere, at least nowhere that science will ever spot. This is a cause for incredib le excit emen t because, if the real you isn’t inside your head, you have been set free, like awareness itself. This freedo m is limitless. You can create anything because you are in ever y atom of creat ion. Wherever your awaren ess wants to go, matter mus t follow . You do com e first after all and the universe second. I can hear the cries of outrage from those who claim that toda y’s wor shippers think they are larger than God, that instead of obe ying his laws they arrogantl y want to defin e life any way they choose. There is some truth to this criticis m, but it mus t be put into context. Imagine an infan t who has been crawling for several months and who suddenl y finds that there’ s a new mode of travel called walking. Ever yone has watched a toddl er find his legs—the bab y’s face sho ws a combinat ion of unstead iness and deter minat ion, insecurit y and joy. “Can I do this ?” “Should I fall back down and crawl, the way I kno w how to do?” What you’re reading in a bab y’s face is"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"exact ly the sam e tangled exper ienc e of anyone caught at a spiritu al crossroad s. In both cases, ever ything is on the move in a new way. The brain is motivating the bod y; the bod y is bring ing new infor mation to the brain; unexpect ed actions begin to emerge from nowhere; and even though the whole mixture feels scar y, a certa in exhilar ation drives us for ward. “I don’ t know w here I’m going, but I have to get ther e.” All experienc e takes place within the bubbling cauldron of creation. Ever y moment of life sweeps the bod y along in an uncert ain balance of mind, emotions, perc eptions, behav ior, and outside even ts. Your attention gets pulled here and there. In a moment of awakening, the brain is just as confused, joyful, insecure, uneas y, and astonished as a bab y finding his legs. But at the leve l of the witness, this confused mix is utter ly clear : It’s all one thing. Look at the bab y again. As he lurch es across the floor , the whole world totters with him. Ther e’s no stead y place to stand, no way of saying, “I am in control. This is going to turn out the way I want it to.” The bab y has no choic e but to plunge his whole being into a world that is bursting into new di mensions. Can anyone live this way, plunging into new dim ensions, all the time? No, stabi lity must be found. Sinc e childhood, all of us have found a stable point through the ego. We imag ine a fixed “I” who is in contro l, at least as mu ch as possible. But there is another , far mo re stab le point of stabil ity: the witn ess. MEETING THE SILENT WITNESS How to Seek Within 1. Follow the flow of awaren ess. 2. Don’t resist what’s happening inside. 3. Open yourself to the unknown. 4. Don’t censor or den y what y ou fee l. 5. Reach beyond yourse lf. 6. Be genuine, speak y our truth. 7. Let the cen ter be your hom e. Follo w the flow: The phrase “follow your bliss” has beco me a maxim for many people. The princip le behind the maxim is that whatever brings a person deep est joy is a reli able guide to follow into the future. An even more reliabl e guide is to follow your awaren ess as it grow s. Somet imes awaren ess doe sn’t equate with joy or bliss. You may be aware of a hidden need to feel grief or a nagging sense of unease or discon tent with the limitations of your present life. Most people don’ t follow these signs. The y search for outside sources of happiness, and they think their bliss comes from them. If you follow your awareness, however , you will find that it cuts a path through time and space. Awareness cannot unfold without also unfolding outside events that mirror it. Thus, desire and purpose are linked—if you follow your desire, the purpose reveals itself. There is a flow that links disconnected even ts, and you are this flow. When you were a child, the flow took you from one stage of deve lopm ent to the next; as an adult, it can do the sam e. No one can predict your next step of unfoldm ent, including yourself. But if you are will ing to follow the flow , the path will certain ly lead you closer to the silent witness, w ho resides at the source of all your desires. Don’t resist what’s happening: It’s impossibl e to be new and old at the same time, yet we all wish we could stay the way we are while changing in ways we desire. This is a perfec t formul a for gett ing stuck. To seek who you are, you have to let go of old imag es about yourself. Whether you like yourself or not is irrel evant. Som eone with high self-este em and proud acco mplishm ents is still caught up in the bat tle of opposites—in fac t, such peopl e usual ly think they are winning the batt le for the “good” side. The part of yourself that has found peace from all batt les is the witness. If you ask to meet the witness, be prepared. Long-held habits cent ered on winning and losing, being accepted or rejected, feeling in contro l or scatt ered, wil l begin to change. Don’t resist this change— you are shedding the trapp ings of ego and m oving to a new sense of self. Open yoursel f to the unkno wn: This whole book, being about the mystery of life, returns to the unkno wn many times. Who you think you are is not real but a concoc tion of past events, desires, and memories. This"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"concoct ion has a life of its own—it motors forward through time and space exper ienc ing only those things that it know s. A new exper ience isn’ t real ly new; it’s just a slight twist on very familiar sensations. To open yourself to the unkno wn means cutt ing the ground out from under your fam iliar reactions and habits. Notic e how often the sam e word s com e out of your mouth, the same likes and dislikes dict ate what you do with your time, the sam e people fill your life with rout ine. All of this familiarit y is like a shell. The unknown is outside the shell, and to encoun ter i t, you have to be will ing to welcom e it in. Don’t censor or deny what you feel: On the surface, ever yday life has becom e much more comfor tabl e than ever before. Yet people still lead lives of quiet desperation. The source of this desperation is repression, a sense that you cannot be what you want to be, cannot feel what you want to feel, canno t do what you want to do. A creator should never be trapped in this way. No authori ty looms over you to enforce repression; it is entir ely self-enforced. Any part of yourself that you cannot fac e puts a barr ier betwe en you and rea lity. Yet emotions are entire ly priva te. Onl y you know how you feel, and when you stop censoring your emotions, the effect goes far beyond feeling better. Your aim is not to experienc e only positive emot ions. The road to freedo m is not through feeling good; it is through feeling true to yourself. We all owe emotional deb ts to the past, in the form of feelings we couldn’ t allow ourselves to express. The past isn’t over as long as these debts go unpaid. You don’ t have to return to the person who made you angr y or afraid, with the intent ion of revising how the past turned out. For that person, the impac t can never be the sam e as it is for you. The purpo se of getting rid of emotion al debt is to find y our plac e in th e present. The ego has a repertoire of ration alizations for not being em otion ally free: I’m not the kind of person who feels l ike tha t. I should be over it. No one wants to hear abou t these feelings. I don’ t have a right to feel hurt ; it isn’ t fair to ever yone else. I’ll onl y open old wounds. The past is the past. If you find yourself saying such things as a defle ction from facing painful feel ings, you may succeed in keeping them repres sed. But ever y hidd en, blocked feel ing is like a chunk of frozen consciousness. Until it thaws, you are saying “I am this hurt” even as you refuse to look at it; it has you in its grip. This is another obstacle between you and the silent witness that must be dissolv ed. Time and attention have to be paid, sitting with y our feel ings and le tting the m say what the y have to sa y. Reach beyond yourself: When you are inhab iting a self that is fixed and set in plac e, you may think that you have attain ed som ething positive. As people say, “Now I know who I am.” What they really kno w is an imitation of a real self, a colle ction of habits, labels, and preferenc es that is entirel y histori cal. You have to reach beyond this self-cre ated identi ty to find the source of new ener gy. The silent witness is not a second self. It doesn ’t rese mbl e a new suit hanging in the closet that you can reach for and put on to replace the shabb y suit you’ve worn out. The witness is a sense of self that lies beyond boundaries. Ther e’s a haun ting poem by the great Bengal i poet Rabindrana th Tagore in which he imagin es what it will be like to die. He has a deep intu ition that it will be like a stone m elting in his hear t: The stone wil l melt in tears"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":" Because I can’t remain closed to you for ever. I can’t escape wi thout be ing conquer ed. From the blue sky an ey e will gaze down To summon m e in silence. I will receive death utt erly at your feet. To me, this is a perfect description of reaching beyond yourself. Having lived with a hard place in the hear t, you still can’ t avoid your real self. It is the silent eye look ing down. (Instead of saying, “I will receiv e death,” the poet could have said, “I will receiv e freedom ” or “I will receive joy.”) To reach beyond yourse lf means reali zing, with real det erm ination, tha t your fixed iden tity is false. Then, when the ego dem ands that you see the world from the perspect ive of “what’s in it for me,” you can free yourse lf by saying in return, “that me isn’t in char ge an ymore.” Be genuine: Wh y is it said that the truth will set you free? People are punished and ostra cized all the time for telling the truth. Lies often succeed. A polite agree ment to go along and make no waves has brought money and power to many people. But “The truth shall set you free” wasn’t meant as practic al advice. Ther e’s a spiri tual inten t behind the words, saying in essence, “You canno t set yourself free, but truth can.” In other word s, truth has the power to set aside what is false, and doing so can set us free. The ego’ s agenda is to keep i tself going. At crucia l moments, however , the truth speaks to us; it tells us how things real ly are, not forever or for all people but right at this moment for us alone. This impulse must be honored if you wish to break free. When I think of what a flash of truth is lik e, som e exa mples co me to mind: Knowing th at y ou can’ t be what so meone else wants y ou to be, no m atter how m uch you love the other person. Knowing th at y ou love, even when i t’s scar y to say so. Knowing th at so meone else’ s figh t isn’ t yours. Knowing th at y ou are bett er than what you appear to be. Knowing th at y ou wil l survive. Knowing th at y ou have to go y our own wa y, no m atter what the cost. Each sentence begins with the word knowing bec ause the silent witness is that level where you know yourself, without regard for what others think they know . To speak your truth isn’ t the sam e as bursting out with all the unpleasant things you’ve been too afraid or too polite to say. Such outbursts alwa ys have a feel ing of pressure and tension behind them; they are grounded in frustrat ion; they carr y anger and hurt. The kind of truth that com es fro m the knower is cal m; it doesn’ t refer to how an yone else is behaving; it brings clari ty to who y ou are. Value these flashes. You can’ t make them appea r, but you can encourage them by being genu ine and not letting yourse lf fall into a persona crea ted ju st to m ake you feel safe and acc epted. Let the center be your home: To be cen tered is considered desirabl e; when they feel distract ed or scatt ered, people often say, “I lost my cen ter.” But if there is no person inside your head, if the ego’ s sense of I, me, mine is illusor y, where ’s the cen ter?"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":" Paradoxica lly, the cen ter is ever ywher e. It is the open space that has no boundar ies. Instead of thinking of your center as a defined spot—the way peopl e point to their hearts as the seat of the soul—be at the center of experien ce. Experi ence isn’ t a place; it’s a focus of attention. You can live there, at the still point around which ever ything revolves. To be off cen ter is to lose focus, to look awa y from experi ence or block it out. To be center ed is like saying “I want to find my home in crea tion.” You relax into the rhythm of your own life, which sets the stage for meeting yourself at a deep er leve l. You can’ t sum mon the silent witness, but you can place yourse lf close to it by refu sing to get lost in your own crea tion. When I find myself being overshadowed by anything, I can fal l back on a few sim ple steps: • I sa y to m yself, “This situa tion m ay be shaking m e, but I a m mo re than an y situa tion.” • I take a deep brea th and focus m y atten tion on w hatever m y bod y is feeling. • I step back and see myself as ano ther person would see me (prefer ably the person whom I am resisting or react ing to). • I reali ze that my emotions are not reliabl e guides to what is perm anent and real. The y are momentar y react ions, and m ost l ikel y the y are born of habit. • If I am about to burst out with uncontrol labl e reac tions, I walk awa y. As you can see, I don’ t try to feel bette r, to be more positiv e, to com e from love, or to change the state I’m in. We are all framed by personali ties and driven by egos. Ego personal ities are trained by hab it and by the past; they run along like self-propel led engines. If you can observe the mechanis m at work without gett ing wrapped up in it, you will find that you possess a second perspect ive, one that is alwa ys calm, aler t, deta ched, tuned in but not overshadowed. That second place is your cen ter. It isn’ t a place at all but a close encoun ter with the silent witness. CHAN GING YO UR REALITY TO ACCO MMO DA TE THE FO UR TH SECRET This fourth secre t is about meeting your real self. Words can say a great deal about the real self, but it takes an actua l meeting to realiz e what it is. Your real self has qual ities you are alread y exper ienc ing ever y day: Intel ligenc e, aler tness, being tuned in, knowingness—whenever any of these qual ities com es into play, you are living closer to your real self. On the other hand, when you feel distracted, lost, confused, fearfu l, scat tered, or trapped inside ego boundar ies, y ou are not. Experien ce seesaws between these two poles; therefore, one way to meet your real self is to push away from the opposite pole whenever you notice that you are there. Try to catch yourself in such a moment and pull away from it. Pick a strongl y negativ e experi ence of the following kind (if possible, choose a repe titive one that has cropped up severa l times): • Road rage • Arguing with y our spou se • Resenting authorit y at work • Losing contro l over y our chi ldren"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":" • Feeling cheat ed in a deal or tr ansaction • Feeling betra yed by a close friend Put yourse lf back in the situation and feel what you felt then. You might want to close your eyes and visual ize the car that cut you off in traf fic or the plumber who handed you the outrageous bill. Do what it takes to make the situa tion vivid in your mind. When you feel that stab of anger , hurt, mis trust, suspicion, or betra yal, say to yourself, “That ’s how my ego feels. I can see why. I’m very used to it. I will go along as long as it lasts.” Now let the feeling run. Get as worked up as your ego wants; envision fant asies of revenge or self-pit y, or whatever your ego thinks is appropriat e. Imagine that you are swelling up with your feeling; it spreads out from you like the shock wave from a slow-m otion explosion. Follow this wave as far as it wants to go, watching it grow fainter and faint er as it spreads to inf init y, filling the whole universe if it wants to. Take deep brea ths if you need to in order to get the wave of fee ling to depart from you and trave l outward. Don’ t time yourself. The feel ing may be strong enough to take a while before it wants to expand. Now, just as you see the wave disappearing into infin ity, look at yourself and see if any of the following feelings are present: • A giggle, the desire to laugh at i t all • A shrug, a s if the whole thing is no big deal • A sen se of cal mness or pea ce • Looking a t yourself as if at another person • A deep sigh of rel ief or exhaustion • A feel ing of rele ase or let ting go • A sudden reali zation tha t the other person m ay be right These are the telltale feelings that arise in us when we are crossing the invisible boundar y between ego and the real self. If you follow any emotion far enough, it will end in silenc e. But it’s asking a lot to get that far ever y time. Your ai m is to get to th e frontier at least, the line where the ego’ s needs begin to lose the ir grip. • When y ou laugh, you are losing the need to take yourse lf so seriousl y. • When y ou shrug, y ou lose the need to blow things out of proportion. • When y ou fee l cal m, you lose th e need to feel agita ted or to have dra ma. • When y ou can look at yourself as if y ou are another person, y ou lose the need to be the onl y one who counts. • When you feel reli ef or fatigue com ing out, you lose the need to hold on to stress.

There are other telltale signs of leav ing ego beh ind. If you fall into the pattern of being easi ly offended, feeling either superior or inferior , wanting what is com ing to you and begrudging what others get, or imagining that people are talking behind your back, each of these can be dea lt with just as you did in the above instanc es. Relive the feeling, let your ego take it as far as it wants, and watch the feeling expand unti l it fades awa y at the edge of infin ity. This exercise won’ t miracu lousl y dispel ever y negativ e feeling. Its purpo se is to give you a close encounter with your real self. If you try it in that spiri t, you will be surprised how much easier it beco mes in the future to escape th e grip of e motions tha t have been in control for y ears. Secret #5 THE CA USE OF S UFFERIN G IS UN REALITY THE MOST COMM ON REASO N that peopl e turn to spiri tuali ty is to deal with suffering. The y don ’t do this by accident, but bec ause ever y religion pro mises that it can relieve pain, that faith transc ends the sorrow s of the flesh, that the soul is a refuge for the suffering heart. Yet when they turn to God or faith or the soul, many people find no reli ef, or only the reli ef that otherwise might com e from talk ing to a therapist. Is there a spec ial power found only in spiri tuali ty? For those who turn to it, therap y works, and the mos t com mon forms of suffering, anxi ety and depression, respond in the short run to drug s. When the depres sion lifts, is there any reason to turn to spirit? To answer these questions we have to reali ze, first of all, that pain is not the sam e as suffering. Left to itself, the bod y dischar ges pain spontaneousl y, letting go of it the moment that the underl ying cause is healed. Suffering is pain that we hold on to. It comes from the mind’s mysterious instinc t to believ e that pain is good, or that it canno t be escap ed, or that the person deserves it. If none of these were present, suffering would not exist. It takes force of mind to crea te suffering, a blend of beli ef and perc eption that the person thinks he or she has no control over . But as inescapabl e as suffering may appear to be, what brings escape is not attack ing the suffering itself but get ting at the unreali ty that makes us cl ing to pain. The secret cause of suffering is unreal ity itself. Rec entl y I saw dram atic eviden ce of this in a very ordinar y way. I chanced on one of those television program s where peopl e who were born with physical defor mities are given a free makeover using the full powers of plastic surgery, dentistr y, and the beaut ician’s art. On this particu lar episode, the people who desperat ely wanted makeov ers were ident ical twins. Onl y one twin wanted to change her looks; the other didn’ t. As adults, the twins no longer looked exac tly alike. The “ugly one” in a given pair had suffered a broken nose or dam aged teeth or had put on extra weight. The dram atic thing for me was how minor these cos metic defec ts were compar ed to the intense beli ef, shared by both twins, that one was extre mely beautifu l and the other distr essing ly ugly. The “ugly ones” adm itted that not a day went by withou t com paring themselves to their “beautifu l” sisters. In this TV program one cou ld witnes s all the steps that lead to suffering : Overlooking ac tual facts Adopting a negativ e percep tion"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":" Reinforcing that percept ion b y obsessive think ing Getting lost in the pain without looking for a wa y out Com paring yourself to others Cem enting the suffering through rel ationships The handbook on how to suffer would include all these steps, which build up a sense of unreali ty until it seems tota lly real. And by implication, the dire ctions for putting an end to suffering would reverse these steps and bring the person back to rea lity. Ove rlooking the fact s: The beginning of suffering is often a refusal to look at how the situation really is. Several years ago som e research ers conducted a stud y to find out how people deal with crisis when it unexpect edly arises. The stud y was spon sored by therapists hoping to learn where people turn for help when they find themselv es in troubl e. When the wor st misfor tune occurs—when someon e gets fired, has a spou se walk out, hears a diagnosis of canc er—about 15 percent seek som e kind of help from a counselor , therapist, or pastor . The rest watch TV. The y refuse to even consider looking at the probl em or opening it up to discussion with som eone who m ight help. The therap ists behind the stud y were appa lled by this deep denial, but I couldn’ t help think ing: Isn’t watch ing TV a natural reaction? People instinct ivel y try to blot out pain with pleasure. Buddha faced the same situa tion many centur ies ago. People at the time of Buddha were also trying to blot out pain because the monsoons didn’ t com e and all their crops died, or the ir whole fa mily perished in a cholera epide mic. Without TV the y had to find other escapes, but the assumpt ion was the sam e: Pleasure is better than pain; therefore, it must be the answer to suffering. Repl acing pleasure with pain may work in the short run. Both are sensations, and if one is strong enough it can cance l out the other . But Buddha didn’ t teach that life hurts bec ause of pain ; it hurts because the cause of suffering hasn’ t been exa mined. Som eone can be sitting by the pool in Mia mi Beach, watching a favori te sitco m, eating chocola te, and being tick led with a feather at the same time. The person won’ t feel much pain, but she could be suffering very deep ly anyway. And the only lasting way out is to take steps that will confront the source of the suf fering, the first step being a will ingness to look a t what is ac tual ly happening. Negative perceptions: Rea lity is percept ion, and the suffering person gets trapp ed by negat ive percep tions of his own creation. Percept ion keeps the pain under control, not by reducing it but by sealing out even greater pain. This twist is the one most peopl e find hard to understand. The bod y dischar ges pain auto matical ly, yet the mind can override that instinct by turning the pain into so mething “good,” in the sen se that it’s bet ter than other , even worse pos sibi lities. Inner confusion and confli ct are why the mind has such a hard time hea ling itself, despite all the power it holds. The power has been turned aga inst itself, and thus perc eption, which could end suffering in an inst ant, locks the door inste ad. Reinf orcing a perception: Percep tions are fluid unless we seal them in place. The self is like a constantl y shifting system that incorporat es the new into the old at ever y moment. If you constant ly obsess over old percept ions, however , they beco me reinforced with each repet ition. Let ’s consider a spec ific exam ple. Anorexia nervosa is the medica l term given to a condi tion in which a person, usuall y a girl under the age of twent y, adopts starvat ion as a wa y of life. If you interview an anorexic teenag er who weighs under 90 pounds and show her four pictur es of bod y images, ranging from the thinnest to the fatt est, she will say that her bod y matches the fat one despite the fact that in real ity her fram e is skeletal. If you go so far as to superi mpose her own face on the four pictures, an anorex ic will still choose the fatt est photo as being herself. This distorted bod y image tota lly baffles other people. It seem s bizarre to look in the mirror at a skeleton and see a fat person instead (just as it is biz arre for id entic al twins to feel that one is extre mely ugl y and the other beau tiful). In these cases, perc eption has beco me distorted for hidden reasons connec ted to emotion and personal ity. An anorexic, if shown photos of four cats, can easil y pick out which one is the fattest. The distortion com es at a"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"deeper leve l where “I” dec ides what is real about oneself. The whole thing is a feedb ack loop. Once “I” dec ides something about oneself, ever ything in the outside world must confor m to that decision. In the anorexic’ s mind, shame is essenti al to who she is, and the world has no choic e but to throw her shameful imag e back at her. Starving herself beco mes the only way she can figure out to make that fat girl in the mirror go awa y. Which leads to a general rule: Reality is whatever you identify with. Anywhere that life hurts we have locked ourselves into som e kind of false ident ific ation, telling ourselves private, unchal lenged stories about who we are. The cure for anorex ia is to somehow pry a wedge between “I” and this powerful, secret iden tification. The same appli es to all suffering because each person arbitrari ly ident ifies with one thing after anoth er tha t tells an ina ccurat e stor y of who he or she is. Even if you were able to surround yourself with pleasure ever y minute of the day, the wrong stor y of who you are will wind up bringing deep suf fering. Gett ing lost in the pain: People have rem arkab ly different thresh- olds of pain. Researchers have hooked subjects up to equal stim uli, such as elec tric shocks to the back of the hand, and asked them to rate the discom fort they feel on a scal e from 1 to 10. It was long thought that since pain is registered along iden tical neural pathwa ys, people would register a pain signal more or less the sam e (as for instance, almost ever yone would be able to feel the difference between bright head lights in their eyes and low bea ms). Yet the pain that registered as a 10 for som e patients felt like a 1 to others. This indi cates not just that pain has a sub ject ive com ponent but also that the way we assess pain is com pletely individua l. There is no universal path betwe en stim ulus and respon se. One person can feel deep ly traum atized by an experienc e that hardl y regist ers for someone else. What’ s so strange about this resul t is that none of the subjects though t they were creat ing a response. If you accid enta lly put your hand on a hot stove, your bod y reacts instant ly. Yet in that instant your brain is actu ally assessing the pain and giving it the intensit y you perceiv e as objective ly real. And by not renouncing their control over it people get lost in their pain. “What can I do? My mother just died, and I’m devasta ted. I can’ t even get out of bed in the morning.” In such a state ment ther e seems to be a direct link betwe en cause (the death of a loved one) and effect (depression). But, in fact, the trail followed between cause and effect isn’ t a straight line; the whole person enters the picture, with a wealth of factors from the past. It’s as if pain enters a black box before we feel it, and in that box the pain is matched up with ever ything we are—our whole histor y of emotions, memories, beliefs, and expe ctations. If you are self-aware, the black box isn’t so seal ed off and hidden. You kno w that you can affect what goes on inside it. But when we suffer, we victi mize ourselves. Wh y is the pain a 10 inste ad of a 1? Bec ause it just is, tha t’s wh y. In truth, suffering persists onl y to the exten t that we allow ourselves to rem ain lost in our o wn cre ation. Comparing yourself to others: The ego wants to be number one; ther efore, it has no choice but to get caugh t up in a never -end ing game of com paring itself to others. Like all ingra ined habits, this one is hard to break. A friend of mine recentl y learned that a wom an he knew had been killed in a car crash. He did not know the woman well, but he knew all her friends. Within hours of her death a pall of grief had settled over them. The woman was beloved and had done many good works; she was young and full of opti mis m. For these reasons people grieved even more, and my friend was caugh t up in it. “I saw myself getting out of my car and being struck by a hit- and-run driver , the way she was. I kept thinking that I should do more than send flower s and a card. As it happened, I went on vaca tion the week of the funera l, and I actu ally found myself unable to enjo y myself ju st thinking about the shock and pain of d ying that wa y.” In the m idst of these reactions, my friend had a sudden real izat ion. “I w as going a long gett ing gloo mier when i t hit me: ‘Tha t isn’t my life. She isn’ t me.’ The though t felt very strange. I mean, isn’t it good to be com passionat e? Shouldn’ t I share in the grief all my friends were feeling?” At that moment he stopped com paring himself to som eone else—not an easy thing to do because we all gain ident ity from parents, friends, and spou ses. An ent ire com munity has taken up fragm entary residen ce inside us, com posed of bits and pieces of other personal ities. Our style of suffering is learn ed from others. To the extent that you feel stoi c or weak, in control or victimized, desperate or hopeful, y ou are adhering to reac tions set down b y som eone else. Deviat ing fro m their pa ttern feels strange, even threat ening. In my friend ’s case, he broke out of a patt ern of grief only when he realized that it"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"was second-hand. Before that, he wanted to feel what was proper and expe cted. He wanted to fit in with the way others saw the situa tion. As long as you compare yourself to others, your suffering will persist as a way of fitting in. Cementing suffering through relat ionships: Pain is a universal exper ience ; therefore, it enters into ever y relat ionship. Nobod y trul y suffers alone, and even if you do ever ything you can to suffer in silenc e, you are having an effect on those around you. The reason that peop le find it so difficu lt to enter a healing rela tionship is that life in our family of origin often requ ired a good deal of unawareness. We overlook what we don’ t want to see; we keep silen t about things that are too difficul t to discu ss; we respec t boundaries even when they put someone into a box. In short, the fam ily is where we learn to den y pain. And deni ed pain is j ust another term for suffering. Given a choi ce, most people would rather preserve their relat ionships than stop suffering. One sees this in abusive fa milies w here the victi ms don’ t speak up or walk out. (Some states have passed laws forcing the polic e to arrest dom estic abusers over the prot est of the spou ses they beat up and torm ent. Without such laws, the vict im sides with the abuser more than half the time.) A hea ling relat ionship is based on awareness; in it both partners work to break old habi ts that promo te suffering. The y have to walk a fine line, just as my friend did, because compassion means that you appre ciate the suffering som eone else is experi encing, as well as your own. Yet at the same time there has to be detach men t, making sure that suffering, no matter how real, isn’ t the dominant reality. The attitud es that make for a hea ling rela tionship beco me part of a vision you hold for yourse lf and the other person. A VISI ON WITH OUT SU FFERING How to Relate When Someone Else Is in Pain I have s ympathy for y ou. I know w hat you’re going through. You don’ t have to feel a cert ain wa y just to m ake me happ y. I will he lp y ou get through this. You don’ t have to be afra id that you are driv ing m e awa y. I don’ t expect you to be perfect. You aren’ t letting m e down. This pain y ou are going through isn ’t the rea l you. You can have the spac e you need, but I won ’t let you be alone. I will be as real with you as I can be. I w on’t be afraid of y ou, even though y ou may be afra id of y our pain. I will do a ll I can to show y ou that l ife is sti ll good and joy stil l pos sible. I can’ t tak e your pain on as m y responsibili ty. I w on’t let y ou hold on to y our pain—we are here to get through this. I will t ake y our hea ling as seriousl y as m y own w ell-being. As you can see, ther e are subtl e pitf alls in these attitud es. When rela ting to someone in pain, you have to extend yourself and yet rem ain with in boundaries at the sam e time. “I feel your pain, and yet it’s not mine” is a trick y stance ; it can tip either way. You can beco me so involved in the pain tha t you turn into an enabl er. Or y ou can hide behind your own boundaries and shut out the person who is suf fering. A heal ing rela tionship maintains"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"the proper balance. You both must rem ain alert and attentiv e; you must keep your eye on the spiritu al vision ahead; you mus t be willing to have new responses ever y day. Most of all, you share a path that leads, step by step, out of unrea lity. The ultimate goal, if you really want to be real, is to experien ce existen ce itself. “I am” is such an experi ence. It is both common and rare because ever yone kno ws how to be, yet few people extra ct the full pro mise of their own being. “I am” gets lost when you start iden tifying instead with “I do this, I own that, I like A but not B.” These iden tifications becom e mo re impor tant than th e real ity of y our own pure be ing. So let’s go deep er into the link between suffering and unreali ty. The way we forget the peace and clari ty of “I am” can be broken down into five aspects. In Sanskrit these are called the five kleshas, the root causes of ever y form of suf fering. 1. Not kno wing what is real 2. Grasping and cling ing to the unreal 3. Being afra id of the unreal and recoi ling fro m it 4. Identif ying with an imagin ary self 5. Fear of death Right now you and I are doing one of these five things, although we began so long ago that now the proces s is ingrained. The five kleshas are arranged in a cascade. Once you stop knowing what is real (first klesha), the others fall into place auto matically. This means that for most people only the end of the line—fear of death—is a conscious exper ience ; therefor e, we m ust beg in there and go back up the ladd er. Being afra id of dea th is a source of anx iety that reaches into many areas. The way our societ y wor ships youth and shun s the elder ly, our despera te need for distract ion, the prom otion of cosm etics and beau ty trea tmen ts, flourishing g yms with full-l ength m irrors on all sides, and the cra ze for ce lebri ty are all symptoms of wanting to den y death. Theolog y tries to conv ince us that there is life after death, but since that claim has to be taken on faith, religion exac ts obedienc e by holding the afterlif e over our heads. If we lack faith, if we worship the wrong God or sin against the right God, our chan ces for a reward after we die are ruined. Rel igious war s continue to erupt over this issue, which is so anxi ety-provoking that fanati cs would rather die for the faith than live with the adm ission that som eone else’ s faith has a right to exist. “I die so that you may not believe in your God” is the m ost twisted leg acy of the fifth klesha. A person fears dea th not for itself but for a deeper reason, which is the need to defend an imaginar y self. Identif ying with an imagin ary self is the fourth klesha, and it’s something we all do. Ev en on a superfic ial level, people erect an imag e based on inco me and status. When Francis of Assisi, the son of a wealth y silk merchan t, stripped off his rich garm ents and renounced his father ’s mone y, he was throwing awa y not just his worldl y possessions but also his iden tity—the way peopl e knew who he was. In his mind, God could not be approach ed through a false self-i mage. Self-i mage is close ly connec ted to self-estee m, and we know the high cost a person pays when self-este em is lost. Children who sit in the back row in grade school and avo id the teache r’s eye usuall y don’ t grow up to discus s foreign polic y or medieval art because, early on, their self-i mag e incorporated a sense of inadequ acy. Conversel y, studies have shown that if a teacher is told that a part icular studen t is excep tiona lly bright, that student will perfor m much better in class even if the sele ction was rando m: Low IQ kids can ach ieve beyond high IQ kids with enough approva l from their teachers. The image set in the teacher ’s mind is enough to turn a poor perform er into a sterling one. Ident ifying with a false image of who you are causes a great deal of suffering in other ways. Life never stops dem anding more and more. The demands on our time, pati ence, ability, and emotions can becom e so overwhel ming that adm itting your inadequa cy seems like the honest thing to do. Yet in a person’ s false self- image is buried the ugl y histor y of ever ything that has gone wrong. “ I won ’t,” “I can’ t,” and “I give up” al l flow"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"from the fourth klesha. The third klesha says that even with a heal thy self-i mage we reco il from things that threa ten our ego s. These threats exist ever ywhere. I am afra id of being poor , of losing my spouse, of break ing the law . I am afraid to shame myself before anyone who se respec t I want to keep. For som e peopl e, the thought of their children turning out badl y is a deep threa t to their own sense of self. “W e don’ t do that in this family” is usual ly code for “Your behav ior threatens who I am.” But people don’ t recogniz e that they are speaking in code. Once I have ident ified with my self-i mag e, the fear that it might break down is instinct ive. The need to protect myself from what I fear is part of who I am . The second klesha says that a person suffers because of clinging, which means clinging to anything at all. Holding on to som ething is a way of showing that you are afraid it will be taken from you. People feel viol ated when a purse snatcher runs awa y with a purse, for exa mple, or if they come home to find that the house has been broken into. These violations don ’t matter bec ause of what has been taken; purses and hou sehold goods can be replaced. Yet the sense of personal injury often persists for months and years. If the right trigger is pulled, having a purse snatch ed can make you lose entirel y your sense of personal safet y. Som eone has stripped you of the illusion that you were untouchab le. (Am erica ’s national parox ysm after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center continu es to play out this drama of “us” versus “them” on a mass scal e. The sense of Am erican invu lnerabi lity was exposed as an illusion. Yet at botto m this wasn’ t a nation’ s proble m. It was an individu al proble m felt on a huge scale.) There are many twists and turns to suffering. The trail leads from fear of death to a false sense of self and the need to cling. In the end, however , unrea lity alon e is the cause of all suffering. The proble m never was pain; quite the opposite : Pain exists so that illusion won’ t keep getting awa y with its tricks. If unrea lity didn’ t hurt, it would seem rea l foreve r. The five kleshas can be solved all at once by embr acing one real ity. The differenc e between “I am my hurt” and “I am” is smal l but cruc ial. A huge amount of suffering has resulted from this single misperc eption. Thinking that I was born, I canno t avoid the thre at of dea th. Thinking that outside forces exist, I must accept that these forces can harm me. Thinking that I am a person, I see other person s ever ywhere. All of these are percept ions that were crea ted, not facts. Once created, a percept ion lives a life of its own unti l you go back and change it. It takes only a flicker of awaren ess to lose touch with real ity. In reali ty nothing exists outside the self. As soon as you begin to accept this one bit of kno wledg e, the whole purpo se of life changes. The only goa l worth atta ining is com plete freedo m to be y ourse lf, without illusions and false bel iefs. CHAN GING YO UR REALITY TO ACCO MMO DA TE THE FIFTH SECRET The fifth secret is about how to stop suffering. There is a stat e of nonsuf fering inside you; it is simpl e and open awareness. By contrast, the stat e of suffering is complica ted because, in its atte mpts to wrestl e with pain, the ego refuses to see that the answer could be as simple as simpl y learn ing to be. Any steps that get you to stop cling ing to complications will bring you closer to the sim ple state of healing. Com plications occur as thoughts, feelings, beliefs, and subtle ener gies, me aning hidden em otion al deb ts and resistance. For this exer cise, take anything in your life that is bringing you a sense of deep unease, disco mfort, or suffering. You can choose something that has persist ed for years or som ething that is upper most in your life right now . Wheth er there is a physical com ponent or not is unimpor tant, although if you pick a chronic physical disorder , don ’t approa ch this exer cise as a cure—we are deal ing with the patterns of perc eption that encourage you to hold on to suffering. Now sit by yourself for at least 5 minutes a day for the next month with the intention of clear ing awa y the following co mplic ations: Disorder: Chaos is com plicated, order is simpl e. Is your house a mess? Is your desk piled high with work ? Are you letting others create messes and disorder bec ause they kno w you won’ t make them take responsibi lity?"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Have y ou hoarded so m uch junk tha t your environ ment is like an archaeo logica l record of y our past ? Stress: Ever yone feels stressed, but if you cannot compl etely clear your dail y stress at night, return ing to a calm, cen tered, enjo yable inner stat e, you are overstressed. Look closel y at the things that make you tense. Is your commute stressful ? Do you get up too earl y without enough sleep? Do you ignore signs of exhaustion? Is your bod y stres sed by being overweigh t or by being total ly out of shape? List the major stresses in your life and work to reduce them unt il you know for cert ain that y ou are not overstressed. Empathic suffering: Gett ing infe cted with the suffering of others causes you to suffer. You have crossed the line from empa thy to suffering if you feel worse after offering sympathy to som eone else. If you honestl y cannot be in the presence of nega tive situa tions without taking on pain that isn’ t yours, get awa y. Losing sight of y our boundaries doesn’ t make you a “good person.” Negativity: Well-being is a simp le state to which bod y and mind return naturall y. Negativi ty prevents this return by causing you to dwell on not being well. Do you casual ly gos sip about others and relish their misfortunes? Do you spend time with people who carp and crit icize? Do you watch ever y disaster and catastroph e dished out on the even ing news ? These sources of negat ivit y don’ t have to be engaged in—walk awa y and put your atten tion so mewhere mo re posit ive. Inertia: Inertia means giving in to old habi ts and condit ioning. Whatev er the cause of depression, anxiet y, trau ma, insecur ity, or grief, these states linger if you take a passive attitud e. “That ’s just how things are” is the motto of inert ia. Beco me aware of how doing nothing is actual ly the way you’ve train ed yourself to keep things the same. Do you sit and dwell on your suffering? Do you reject helpfu l advic e before even considering it? Do you kno w the dif ferenc e between griping and genuine ly airing your feel ings with the intent ion of hea ling them? Exa mine the routine of y our suffering and break out of it. Toxic relat ionships: Ther e are only three kinds of people in your life : those who leav e you alone, those who help you, and those who hurt you. People who leav e you alon e are dealing with your suffering as a nuisanc e or inconveni ence— they prefer to keep their distance in order to feel better them selves. Those who help you have the strength and awareness to do mor e with your suffering than you are able to do by yourse lf. Those who hurt you want the situation to stay the sam e because they do not have your well-being at hear t. Honestl y coun t how many people in each categor y you have in your life. This isn’t the same as counting friends and loving fam ily members. Assess others solel y as the y rela te to your dif ficul ties. Having m ade a real istic count, t ake the following atti tude: • I will no long er bring my proble ms to anyone who wants to leav e me alone. It’s not good for them or me. The y don’ t want to help, so I will not ask the m to. • I will share my proble ms with those who want to help me. I will not reject genuine offers of assistan ce out of pride, insecur ity, or doubt. I will ask these people to join me in my hea ling and make them a bigger part of my life. • I will put a distanc e between myself and those who want to hurt me . I do not have to confront the m, guilt- trip them, or make them the cause of my self-pit y. But I canno t afford to absorb their toxi c effect on me, and if that means keep ing m y dist ance, I will. Beliefs: Exa mine your possible motives for want ing to suffer. Do you den y that ther e’s anything wrong ? Do"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"you think it makes you a bett er person not to show others that you hurt? Do you enjoy the attention you get when you are sick or in distress ? Do you feel safe being alone and not having to make tough choices? Belief systems are complex—the y hold toge ther the self we want to present to the world. It is much simpl er not to have beliefs, which means being open to life as it com es your way, going with your own inner inte llig ence instead of with stored judgm ents. If you find yourself blocked by your suffering, returning to the same old thoughts again and again, a belief system has trapped you. You can escape the trap only by ending your need to cling to these beliefs. Energ y and sensations: We rely on our bodies to tell us when we are in pain, and the bod y, like the mind, follows fam iliar patterns. Hypochondria cs, for exa mple, grasp the first sign of disco mfor t as a clear message that they are seriousl y ill. In your own case, you are also taking fam iliar sensations and using them to confir m your suffering. Man y depressed people, for exa mpl e, will interpre t fatigue as depression. Because they haven’ t gotten a good night’ s sleep or have been overworked on the job, the y interpr et fee ling depleted as a symptom of depression. The way to deal with these sensations is to strip awa y the interpre tation. Instead of being sad, look upon this as the ener gy of sadnes s. Like fatigue, sadness has a bodil y compon ent that can be dischar ged. Instead of being an anxious person, deal with the ener gy of anxie ty. All ener gies are dischar ged in the same wa y: • Take a deep breath, sit quiet ly, and feel the sensation in y our bod y. • Feel the sensation withou t judgm ent. Just be with it. • Let any feel ings, thoughts, or ener gies that want to come up do so—this often means list ening to the voic e of anxiet y, anger , fear , or woundedness. Let the voices say what they want to say. Listen and under stand what is going on. • Watch the ener gy disperse as much as it can. Don ’t dem and complet e dischar ge. Take the attitude that your bod y will l et go of as m uch stored ener gy as i t is able to. • After a few hours or the nex t da y, repe at this whole process. This may seem like a stiff regi men, but you are being asked to spend only 5 minutes a day on any one of these areas. Tiny steps bring big results. The simp le state of awareness is natur e’s defaul t position ; suffering and the com plicat ions that keep it going are unnatural— it wastes ener gy to maintain all that com plex ity. By working toward a simpl er state ever y day, you are doing the best anyone can do to bring suffering to an end by cutting out the roots of unreali ty. Secret #6 FREEDO M TAMES THE MIN D"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":" DO YOU LOVE YO UR MIN D? I’ve never met anyone who did. People with beau tiful bodies or faces frequentl y love their gift from nature (although the oppo site can be true—the most beaut iful people physically can also shun themselves out of insecurit y or fear of being seen as vain). The mind is the hardest part of ourselves to love because we feel trapp ed inside it—not all the time but in those moments when troubl e breaks in. Fear has a way of roaming the mind at will. Depression darkens the mind; anger makes it erupt in uncontrol lable tur moi l. Ancien t cultur es tend to echo the notion that the mind is restless and unrel iable. In India, the most common metaphor compares the mind to a wild elephant, and calming the mind is said to be like tying the elephan t to a stake. In Buddhis m, the mind is liken ed to a monk ey peer ing out at the world through the five senses. Monke ys are notoriousl y impulsiv e and fickle, liabl e to do anything withou t notic e. Buddhist psycholog y doesn ’t aim to tame the monk ey so much as to learn its ways, accept them, and then transcend to a higher awaren ess that is beyond the ficklen ess of the mind. Metaphors won ’t get you to a place where you can love the mind; you have to find the actual experi ence of peace and calmness on your own. The secre t for doing that is to free the mind. When it is free, the mind settles down. It gives up its restl essne ss and beco mes a chann el for pea ce. This is a counterin tuit ive solut ion because nobod y would say that a wild elephant or a monke y can be tamed by sett ing it free. The y’d say that the freed animal would only run wilder , yet this secret is based on actua l experienc e: The mind is “wild” because we try to confine and contro l it. At a deep er level lies compl ete orderliness. Here, though ts and impulses flow in harm ony with what is right and best for each person. How , then, can you set your mind free? You need to understand how it bec ame trapp ed in the first place. Freedom isn’ t a condition you can simply step into by unlocking a door or break ing a set of shack les. The mind is its own s hack le, as th e poet William Blake kne w when he conte mplated people on the stree ts of London: In every cry of every man In every in fant’s cry of fear In every vo ice, in every ban The mind-fo rged manacles I hea r. When they tried to understand how the mind traps itself, the anci ent Indi an sages devised the key concep t of samskara (fro m two San skrit word roots that mean “to flow together”). A samskara is a groove in the mind that makes thoughts flow in the same direction. Buddhist psycholog y makes sophistica ted use of the concep t by speak ing of samskaras as impr ints in the mind that have a life of their own. Your personal samskar as, built up from memories of the past, force you to reac t in the sam e limited wa y over and over , robbing you of free choic e (i.e., choosing as if for the first time). Most peop le build up an iden tity on the basis of samskara without knowing that they chose to do this. But the clues are inescapab le. Consider someon e prone to attacks of rage. For these so-ca lled rageaho lics, the anger impulse is like an “it,” a thing that controls them from som e secret place of power . Uncontrol lable outbre aks unfold in stages. First, there is usual ly some physical symptom—co mpr ession in the chest, the onset of a headach e, rapid heartbea t, tigh t brea thing. Fro m there an impulse rise s. The person can feel anger building up as if it were water behind a dike. The pres sure is both physical and emotiona l; the bod y wants to throw off its discom fort, and the mind wants to release pent- up feel ings. At this point, the person general ly looks for an excuse to trigger a full-blown attack. The excuse can be found in some slight infract ion—a task not perform ed by the chi ldren, a slo w wai ter, a less than court eous store clerk. Finall y, the eruption of rage occurs, and only after it sett les down does the person real ize the damage he has caused—the cycle ends in remorse and a prom ise never to erupt again. Sham e and guilt enter, vowing to damp down the impu lse for the future, and the mind reflec ts rationa lly on the point lessnes s and risk s of vent ing one’ s"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"rage. For any rageahol ic, the element of choice is hard to reclaim. When the impu lse starts to build up stea m, the pres sure has to find release. Often, however , there is collusion—a taci t agre ement to let the rage have its way. At som e time in their pasts, raging people decided to adopt anger as a coping mechan ism . The y saw rage at work in their family or a t school. The y link ed power to inti midation, perhaps they had no other access to power . The y typically feel unable to express themse lves verbal ly, and striking out in anger beco mes a substitu te for words and though ts. Once in the habit of raging, they stopped seeking other avenues of release. The rage they struggle to end is bound to the m by need and desire—th ey don’ t know ho w to get what the y want withou t it. This is the ana tomy of samskar a in all its variet ies. You can substi tute other exper iences for rage, such as anxiety, depression, sexual addiction, substance abuse, obsessive compulsion; all will test ify to how samskar as rob people of free choi ce. Unable to escape their toxic memories, people adapt to them, adding one layer after ano ther of impr essions. The botto m layers, laid down in childhood, keep sending out their messages, which is why adul ts often look in the mirror and feel like impulsiv e, frightened children. The past has not been worked through suf ficien tly; samskar as rule the psyche through a jumbl e of old, outworn exper iences. Stored memories are like microchips program med to keep sending out the sam e message over and ove r. When you find yourself having a fixed react ion, the message has alre ady been sent: It does no good to try to change the message. Yet this is exac tly how the vast major ity of people try to tame the mind. The y receiv e a message they don’ t like, and their reaction is one of thre e things: Manipulat ion Control Denial If you look at them closel y, it beco mes clear that all three of these behaviors com e after the fact—the y dea l with the mind’s disorder as the cause of the distress rather than as a symptom. These supposed solut ions have tremendous negativ e ef fects. Manipulat ion is getting what you want by ignoring or harm ing the desires of others. Manipulators use char m, persuasion, coax ing, tricker y, and m isdirect ion. The underl ying idea is “I have to fool peopl e to m ake them give me what I want.” When they are really caught up in their ploys, manipul ators even imagin e that they are doing their victi ms a favor—af ter all, who wouldn’ t feel good helping out a guy who’ s so entert aining? You can catch yourse lf fall ing into this behav ior when you aren’ t listening to other people, when you ignore what they want, and when you pretend that your desires cost nobod y else a price. There are also extern al signs. The presenc e of a manipul ator brings tension, stra in, com plaints, and confl ict to a situat ion. Some peop le use passive manipu lations—th ey come up with “poor me” scenar ios to coax sympathy and pity out of others. Or they lay subtle guilt trips with the aim of making others think that what they want is wrong. Manipula tion comes to an end when you stop assum ing that your desires are all- importan t. Then you can reconne ct with others and begin to trust th at their desires might be aligned with yours. When there is no manipu lation, people feel tha t what they want counts. The y trust that you are on their side; you aren’ t seen as a perform er or salesperson. No one feels that he or she is being fool ed. Control is forcing events and people into your way of doing things. Control is the great mask of insecurit y. People who use this behav ior are deathl y afra id of letting others be who they are, so the contro ller is constantl y making demands that keep others off balanc e. The underl ying idea is “If they keep paying atten tion to me, they won’t run away.” When you find yourself making excuses for yourse lf and blaming others, or when you feel inside that no one is showing you enough gratitude or apprec iation, the fault is not with them—you are exhibi ting a need to con trol. The externa l signs of this behavior come from those y ou are trying to control : The y are tense and resistant ; the y com plain of not being list ened to ; the y call you a perfec tionist or a de mand ing boss. Control begins to end when you admit that your way isn’ t auto matically the righ t way. You can tune in to your"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"need for contro l by catching yourself com plaining, blaming, or insist ing that no one is right but you, and com ing up with one excuse after another to prove that you are withou t blame yourself. Once you stop control ling them, the peopl e around you begin to breathe easy. The y relax and laugh. The y feel free to be who they are without looking to you for approval. Denial is looking past the proble m instead of facing it. Psycho logists consider denial the most childish of the three behaviors because it is so intimately linked to vulnerab ility. The person in denial feels helpless to solve proble ms, the way a young child feels. Fear is link ed to denial, and so is a childlik e need for love in the face of insecurit y. The under lying idea is “I don’ t have to notic e what I can’ t change in the first place. ” You can catch yourse lf going into denial when you experi ence lack of focus, forgetfu lness, procrast inat ion, refu sing to confront those who hurt you, wishful thinking, false hope, and confusion. The main extern al sign is that others don’ t depend on you or turn to you when a solution is needed. By pulling your atten tion out of focus, denial defends with blindn ess. How can you be accused of failing at som ething you don’ t even see? You get past denial by facing up to painfu l truths. Honestl y expres sing how you feel is the first step. For som eone in deep denial, any feeling that makes you think you are unsafe is general ly one you have to face. Denial begins to end when you feel focu sed, alert, and read y to parti cipa te despit e your fears. Each of these behaviors tries to prove an impossibili ty. Manipula tion tries to prove that anyone can be made to do what you want. Control tries to prove that no one can reject you unless you say so. Denial tries to prove that bad things wil l go awa y if you don ’t look at them . The truth is th at other people can refuse to do w hat you want, can walk out on y ou for no good reason, and can cause troubl e whether you face i t or not. There is no predic ting how long any of us will stubbornl y try to prove the opposite, but only when we admit the truth does the behavior com pletely end. The next thing to kno w about samsk aras is that they are not silen t. These deep impressions in the mind have a voice; we hear their repe ated messag es as words in our heads. Is it possibl e to figure out which voices are true and which are false? This is an i mpor tant question bec ause it isn’ t possible to think without hear ing some words in y our head. Earl y in the ninete enth cen tury, an obscure pastor in Den mark known as Magister Adler was fired from his church. He was convi cted of disobe ying church authori ties by claiming that he had received dire ct revel ation from God. While preaching from the pulpit, he began claiming that when he spoke in a high, squeak y voic e he was speaking from revela tion, whereas when he spoke with his own norm al, low voice he was speak ing only as him self. This bizarre behavior led his congreg ation to think their pastor mus t be craz y, so they had no alternat ive but to fire him. As it happen ed, new s of the case reached the great Danish philosopher Søren Kierkega ard, who asked the real ly crucial quest ion: Is it ever possibl e to prove that someon e has heard the voice of God ? What behav ior or other outward sign would allow anyone to tell true revela tion from false? The disgraced cler gyman would probabl y be diagnosed as a paranoid schizophren ic if he showed up with the sam e symptoms toda y. Kierkegaard concluded that Adler wasn’ t speaking in God’ s voice, but he also observed that none of us knows where our inner voices co me from . We sim ply accept the m, as well as the strea m of w ords that fill our heads. A deep ly religious person might even claim that ever y inner voice is som e version of the voic e of God. One thing is certain, however: We all hear the inner voices of a clamoring chorus. The y nag, praise, cajole, judge, warn, suspect, disbeli eve, trust, com plain, hope, love, and fear— in no specia l order . It’s too simplisti c to say that we each have a good side and a bad side—we have thousands of aspects form ed out of past experien ces. It’s impossible to sort out how many voices I am actu ally listening to. I sense that som e are buried from childhood ; they sound like orphans of my earliest experien ces begging me to take them in. Other voices are adult like and harsh—in them, I hear people from my past who judged or punished me. Each voic e believ es that it deserves my whole attention, heed less of the others that believe the same thing. There is no cen tral self who rises above the din to quell this riot of opinions, dem ands, and needs. At any given moment, whatever voice I pay the most attention to beco mes my voice, only to be crowded offstag e when my attent ion shifts. The unruliness that pulls m e this wa y and tha t is liv ing proof of how frag men ted I have beco me. How can this clamoring chorus be tamed? How can I retriev e a sense of self that fits one real ity? The answer"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"once again is freedom , yet in a most pecu liar way. You must free yourself from decisions. The voice in your head will die down once you stop making choices. A samsk ara is a choic e you remember from the past. Each choic e changed you by a tiny frac tion. The process began at birth and continues to this day. Instead of fight ing it, we all believ e we should keep on making cho ices; as a result, we keep adding new samskaras and reinforcing the old ones. (In Buddhism, this is call ed the wheel of samskara because the sam e old react ions keep coming around again and again. In a cosm ic sense, the wheel of samskar a is what drives a soul from one lifet ime to the next— old i mpr ints i mpel us to fac e the sam e proble ms time and aga in, even beyond death.) Kierkegaard wrote that the person who has found God has freed himse lf from choices. But what does it feel like to have God make your decisions for you? I think you would have to be deep ly connec ted to God to even come close to answer ing that question. Yet in a stat e of simple awareness, the most evolut ionar y choi ces seem to come spont aneousl y. Whi le the ego agonizes over ever y detai l of a situat ion, a deeper part of your awareness knows what to do alread y, and its choices emerge with amazing finesse and perfect timing. Hasn ’t ever yone exper ienc ed flashes of clarit y in which they suddenl y know just what to do? Choicelessawar eness is anoth er nam e for free awaren ess. By free ing up the choi ce-m aker inside, you reclaim your right to live without boundaries, acting on the will of God with com plete trust. Have we beco me trapped sim ply by the act of choosing ? This is a surprising idea bec ause it runs coun ter to a life long behavior . For all of us, life has been lived one choice at a time. The externa l world is like a huge baz aar offering a daz zling arra y of possibil ities, and ever yone shops the bazaar , cannil y seizing what is best for me and mine. Most peopl e know themse lves by what came home in their shopping bag—a hou se, job, spou se, car, children, money. But ever y time you choose A over B, you are forced to leav e som e part of the one reali ty behind. You are defin ing y ourself b y sele ctive (and co mplete ly arbi trar y) prefer ences. The alternat ive is to stop concentr ating on the results and look to the cause. Who is this choice- maker inside you? This voice is a relic of the past, the accu mulation of old decisions carr ying over beyond their time. Right now you are living under the burden of y our past self, who is no longer alive. You mus t protect the thousands of choices that make up this dead self. Yet the choice- maker could live a much freer life. If cho ices occurred in the present and were full y appre ciated right now , ther e would be nothing left to hold on to, and then the past couldn’ t ac cumul ate into a crushing burden. Choice should be a flow . Your bod y alread y suggests that this is the natura l way to exist. As we saw earlier, each cell maintains only enough reserve of food and oxygen to survive for a few seconds. Cel ls don’ t store up ener gy because they never know what’ s com ing next. Flexib le responses are much more impor tant to survival than hoarding. From one viewpoin t, this makes your cells look entirel y vulner able and undefended, yet as fragile as a cel l may appear , two bill ion y ears of evolu tion can’ t be deni ed. Ever yone kno ws how to choose; few know how to let go. But it’s only by letting go of each experienc e that you make room for the next. The skill of letting go can be learn ed; once learned, you will enjo y living much more spontaneousl y. LETTING GO How to Choose Without Getting Trapped Make the most of ever y exper ience. Don’t obsess over right and wrong decisions. Stop defending your self-i mag e. Go be yond risk s. Make no decision when in doubt."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":" See the possibil ities in whatever happens. Find the strea m of jo y. Making the most of an experi ence: Liv ing full y is extolled ever ywher e in popul ar culture. I have only to turn on the television at rando m to be assailed with the following messages: “It’ s the best a man can get.” “It’ s like having an angel by your side.” “Ever y move is smooth, ever y word is cool. I never want to lose that feeling. ” “You look, they smi le. You win, they go home. ” What is being sold here? A fantas y of tota l sensor y pleasure, social status, sexual attr action, and the self- image of a winne r. As it happens, all these phrases come from the sam e commercial for razor blades, but living life full y is part of almost any ad cam paign. What is left out, howeve r, is the reality of what it actua lly means to full y experien ce som ething. Instead of looking for sensor y overload that lasts forever , you’ll find that the experien ces need to be engaged at the level of meaning and emotion. Meaning is essent ial. If this moment truly matters to you, you will exper ience it full y. Emot ion brings in the dim ension of bonding or tuning in: An exper ienc e that touches your hear t makes the meaning that much more personal. Pure physical sensation, social status, sexual attract ion, and feeling like a winner are general ly superf icia l, which is why people hunger for them repea tedl y. If you spend time with athlet es who have won hundreds of gam es or with sexua lly active singles who have slept with hundreds of partners, you’ll find out two things very quick ly: (1) Numbers don ’t count very much. The athlete usuall y doesn ’t feel like a winner deep down; the sexual conqueror doesn’ t usuall y feel deepl y attra ctive or worth y. (2) Each experi ence brings dim inishing returns; the thri ll of winning or going to bed beco mes less and less excit ing and l asts a shorter ti me. To exper ienc e this moment, or any moment, full y means to engage fully. Meeting a stranger can be total ly fleet ing and meaning less, for exam ple, unles s you enter the individu al’s world by finding out at least one thing that is meaningfu l to his or her life and exchange at least one genuine feeling. Tuning in to others is a circu lar flow: You send yourself out toward people ; you receive them as they respond to you. Notic e how often you don’ t do that. You stand back and insulat e yourself, sending out only the mos t superfic ial signals and rece ive little or nothing back. The same circl e must be present even when someon e else isn’t involved. Con sider the way thre e people might observe the same sun set. The first person is obsessing over a business dea l and doesn’ t even see the sunset, even though his eyes are regist ering the photons that fall on their retinas. The second person thinks, “Nice sunset. We haven’ t had one in a while.” The third person is an artist who immediately begins a sketch of the scene. The differences among the three are that the first person sent nothing out and received noth ing back; the second allowed his awareness to receive the sunset but had no awareness to give back to it—h is response was rote; the third person was the only one to compl ete the circle: He took in the sunset and turned it into a creativ e respon se that sent his awareness back out into the world with som ething to giv e. If you want to fully experience life, you must close th e circle. Right and wrong decisions: If you obsess over whether you are making the right decision, you are basic ally assuming that the universe will reward you for one thing and punish you for anothe r. This isn’ t a correct assumption bec ause the universe is flex ible—i t adap ts to ever y decision you make. Right and wrong are only mental constructs. Immediate ly I can hear strong emotion al objections to this. Wha t about Mister Righ t? What about the perfec t job? Wha t about buying the best car? We are all in the habit of looking like consu mers at people, jobs, and cars, wanting best value for the mone y. But in reali ty the decisions we label as righ t and wrong are arbitr ary. Mister Right is one of a hundred or a thousand peop le you could spend a satisf ying life with. The best job is impossible to define, given that jobs turn out to be good or bad depend ing on a dozen factors that come into play only after you star t the job. (Who knows in advance what your co-workers will be like, what the corporat e climate is, wheth er you will have the righ t idea at the right moment?) And the best car may get driven into an ac ciden t two da ys after you buy it. The universe has no fixed agenda. Once you make any decision, it works around that decision.

Keep in m ind that you are the choice- maker , which m eans that who y ou are is far mor e than any single choice you have ever ma de or ever will ma ke. Defending your self-image: Over the years you have built an idealiz ed self-i mag e that you defend as “me. ” In this image are pack ed all the things you want to see as true about yourself; banished from it are all the shameful, guil ty, and fear -provoking aspec ts that would thre aten your self-confiden ce. But the very aspec ts you try to push awa y return as the most insistent, dem anding voices in your head. The act of banish ment creates the chaos of your intern al dialogue, and thus your idea l erodes even while you are doing ever ything to look good and feel good about y ourself. To really feel good abou t yourself, renounc e your self-i mage. Immediately you will find yourse lf being more open, undefended, and relaxed. It’s helpful to remember a startl ing com ment from the reno wned Indian spiritu al teach er Nisargada tta Maharaj: “If you noti ce, you only have a self when you’re in trouble.” If that seems unbeliev able, imagine yourself walking through a dangerous neighborhood in a bad part of town. All around you are peopl e whose stares make you nervous; the sound of unfam iliar acc ents rem inds you that you are different from these people, and in that differenc e you feel danger . The percep tion of threat causes you to withdraw by contra cting inside. This builds up a wider gap between you and what you fear . Yet this retrea t into the isola ted, con stricted self doesn’ t really defend you from anything. It is imaginar y. By widening the gap, you only ensure that what might serve you—look ing confid ent and at ease—c an’t occu r. Maharaj’ s point is that what we call the self is a contr action around an empty core, whereas in reality we are meant to be free and expansive in our awareness. Much time is spent in self- help trying to turn a bad self-i mage into a good one. As reasonable as that sound s, all self-i mag es have the sam e pitfall : The y keep reminding you of who you were, not who you are. The whole idea of I, me , and m ine was erec ted on m emories, and these m emories are not rea lly you. If y ou release y ourself from your self-i mage, you will be free to choose as if for the first time. Self-i mage keeps reality awa y, part icul arly at the emotion al level. Many peop le don’ t want to admit what they are actua lly feel ing. Their self-i mage dicta tes that being angr y, for exam ple, or sho wing anxi ety is not perm issible. Such feel ings don’ t accord with the “kind of person I want to be.” Certa in emotions feel too dangerous to be part of y our idea l image of y ourself, so you adopt a disguise th at exc ludes those fee lings. Deep- seated rage and fear belong in this categor y, but sadl y so does immense joy, ecstas y, or freewheel ing spont aneit y. You stop being ruled by self- image when: • You fee l what you feel • You are no longer offended by things • You stop appra ising how a situa tion m akes y ou look • You don’ t exclude people y ou fee l superior or inferior to • You qui t worr ying about what others think about y ou • You no long er obses s over mon ey, status, and po ssessions"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":" • You no long er feel the ur ge to defend y our opin ions Going beyond risks: As long as the future remains unpredi ctab le, ever y decision involv es som e leve l of risk. That’ s the stor y that seems to be universa lly acc epted, at least. We are told that certain foods put one at risk for heart atta cks and cance r, for exa mple, and therefore the rational thing is to quantif y the risk and stay on the low side of the numbers. But life itse lf cannot be quantifi ed. For ever y stud y that shows a quantif iabl e fact about heart disease (e.g., men who drink a quart of milk a day are half as likely to suffer a severe hear t attack), there is another stud y to sho w that stress raises the risk of heart disease only if you are suscep tibl e to stress (som e people actua lly thr ive on it). Risk is mechanic al. It impl ies that there is no intelligenc e behind the scenes, only a certa in num ber of factors that result in a given outco me. You can go beyond risk s by knowing that ther e is infin ite intelligence at work in the hidden dimension of your life. At the level of this intelligence your choic es are alwa ys supported. The point of looking at risks would be to see if your course of action is reasonabl e; you wouldn’ t rely on risk anal ysis to override far mo re importan t factors, the ver y fac tors that are being weighed at the level of deeper awaren ess: Does th is choice feel right for m e? Am I int erested in where this cho ice is leading? Do I l ike the people involved? Is th is choice good for m y whole fa mily? Does th is choice ma ke sen se giv en m y stage in lif e? Do I fee l morally justified in m aking this cho ice? Will this choi ce help me to grow ? Do I have a chanc e to be mo re cre ativ e and inspired by what I a m about to do? It’s when these things go wrong that cho ices don ’t work out. The risks may be relev ant, but they aren’ t decisive. People who can assess their choices at the deeper level of awaren ess are align ing themselves with infini te intelligenc e, and thus they have a greater chance for succ ess than does som eone who crunches the num bers. When in doubt: It’s hard to let go when you don’ t know if you have made the right choice in the first plac e. Doubt lingers and ties us to the past. Man y rela tionships end in divorce because of a lack of commitment, but that lack didn’ t grow over ti me; it was present fro m the ver y outset and was never resolved. It’s impor tant not to make critica l decisions when you are in doubt. The universe supports actions once they are begun, which is the sam e as saying that once you take a direc tion, you are setting a mechan ism in motion that is very hard to reverse. Can a married wom an feel unm arri ed simp ly because she wants to? Can you feel that you aren’ t your parents’ child simpl y because you think it would be better to have differen t parents? In both cases the ties to a situat ion, once it is in plac e, are strong. When you are in doubt, however , you put the universe on hold for a while. It favors no particu lar dire ction. There is a good aspect to this pause and a bad one. The good aspect is that you are giving yourse lf room to beco me aware of m ore things, and with mo re awaren ess, the future can bring y ou new reasons to ac t one way or the other . The bad aspect is that iner tia isn’ t productive—wi thout choic es you cannot grow and evolve. If"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"doubts persist, you have to break out of stasis. Mo st peopl e do this by plung ing into the next choic e, catching life on the rebound: “This didn’ t work out, so I be tter do s omething else, no m atter what. ” Usual ly, the people who wind up making totally arbitrar y choic es—recklessl y going for the next house, the next job, the next rela tionship that show s up—turn out to be ove r-calcul ating. The y spend so much time figuring out the risks, looking at all the pros and cons, assessing ever y worst-case scenario, that no choi ce looks right, and sheer frustration pushes them to break the deadlock. Ironical ly, such irra tiona l leaps sometimes work out. The univ erse has more in store for us than we can ever predict, and bad choices frequent ly smoo th out in the end because our hidden aspirat ions kno w where we are going. Even so, doubt is destruc tive to the one quali ty tha t awareness is tr ying to bring to you: knowingness. At a deep level, you are the knower of real ity. Doubt is a symptom indica ting that you aren’ t in cont act with the kno wer inside. It usual ly means that you are looking outside yourse lf when you have to make a choice. Your decision is going to be based on externals. For most people, the strongest externals com e down to what other people think because fitting in is the path of least resistanc e. But fitting in is like embra cing inertia. Social accep tance is the lowest common deno min ator of the self—it ’s you as a social unit rather than you as a unique person. Find out who you really are; let fitting in be the last thing on your mind. Eith er it will happen or it won’t, but in either case y ou will be in no m ore doubt about yourse lf. There is no formula for remov ing doubts because find ing the kno wer inside is personal. You have to be com mitted to expand ing your awareness. Don’t be in doubt about that one thing. If you turn inward and follow the path that leads to your inner int elligence, the kno wer wil l be ther e wait ing for y ou. Seeing the possibil ities: It would be much easi er to let go of outcom es if ever y choic e turned out well. And why shouldn’ t it? In the one reality there are no wrong turns, only new turns. But the ego personali ty likes things to be connect ed. Coming in second toda y is better than com ing in third yesterd ay, and tom orrow I want to com e in first. This kind of linear think ing reflec ts a crude concep tion of progress. Real growth happens in many dimensions. What happens to you can affect how you think, feel, relat e to others, behave in a given situat ion, fit into your surroundings, perce ive the future, or perceive yourse lf. All these dimensions mus t evolv e in order for y ou to evolve. Try to see the possibili ties in whatever happens. If y ou don ’t get what you expected or wished for , ask y ourself, “Where am I supposed to look?” This is a ver y freeing attitud e. On som e dimension or other , ever y even t in life can be causing only one of two things: Either it is good for you, or it is bring ing up what you need to look at in order to create good for you. Evolut ion is win-win, which we can say not out of blind optimism but once again by referring back to the bod y. Anything happening inside a cell is either part of its heal thy operat ion or a sign that a correc tion should tak e pla ce. Ener gy is not expended random ly or on a whim to see ho w it turns out. Life is self-correc ting in just this way. As the choice- maker you can act on a whi m; you can follow arbitr ary or irrat ional paths. But the underl ying machin ery of consciousness doesn’ t alter. It keeps following the same princip les, which are : • To adapt to your desires • To keep ever ything in balance • To harm oniz e your indiv idual life with the l ife of the cosm os • To ma ke y ou aware of what y ou are doing • To show y ou the con sequen ces of y our act ion • To ma ke y our life as rea l as pos sible"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":" Because you have free wil l, you can ignore these principl es entir ely—we all do at one time or anoth er. But you can’ t make them devia te. Life depends on them. The y are the ground of existen ce, and even as your desires com e and go, the ground of existence is unchanging. Once you absorb this truth, you can align yourself with any possibil ity that comes your way, trusting that win-win is the attitud e that life itself has been taking for bill ions of y ears. Finding the stream of joy: My fanc y was caught by an episode in the adventur es of Carlos Castaned a when his master Don Juan sends him to a witch who has the abil ity to adopt the percept ion of any creature. The witch allows Castaned a to feel exac tly like an earthwor m, and what does he perc eive? Enorm ous exhi larat ion and power. Instead of being the tiny blind crea ture that a worm appears to human eyes, Castaned a felt like a bulldozer pushing each grain of dirt aside like a boulder ; he was mighty and strong. Instead of feeling like drudger y, the worm’s digging was cause for e lation, the elat ion of som eone who could mo ve m oun tains with his bod y. In your own life ther e is a strea m of joy that is just as elementa l and unshakab le. A worm kno ws nothing but itself, so it cannot devia te from the strea m of joy. You can disperse your awaren ess in ever y dire ction, and by doing so distract yourself from the strea m. You won’ t really let go of your self-i mage and your restl ess mind until you feel, without question or doubt, a palpable joy in yourself. The renowned spiri tual teacher J. Krishna murti once made a passing com ment I find very moving. People don’ t reali ze, he said, how importan t it is to wake up ever y morning with a song in your heart. Once I read that, I perfor med a test on myself. I asked inside to hear the song, and for a few weeks, without any further willpower on my part, I did notice a song as the first thing tha t ca me to mind when I woke up in the m orning. But I also know that Krishnam urti was being metaphor ical : The song stands for a sense of joy in existen ce, a joy that is free of any good or bad choic es. To ask this of yourse lf is both the sim plest thing and the most difficul t. But don ’t let it slip your mind, no matter how complex your life beco mes. Keep before you the vision of freeing your mind, and expect that when y ou succe ed at doing this, y ou wil l be gree ted b y a stream of jo y. CHAN GING YO UR LIFE TO ACCOM MOD ATE THE SIXTH SECRET The sixth secret is about the choicel ess life. Sinc e we all take our choi ces very seriousl y, adopt ing this new attitude requires a major shift. Toda y, you can begin with a sim ple exer cise. Sit down for a few minutes and reasses s som e of the impor tant choices you’ve made over the years. Take a piece of paper and make two colu mns lab eled “Good Choice” and “Bad Choice.” Under each colu mn, list at least five choic es relating to those moments you consider the mos t memorab le and decisive in your life so far— you’l l probabl y start with turning points shared by mos t people (the serious relat ionship that collapsed, the job you turned down or didn’ t get, the decision to pick one profession or another), but be sure to include private choices that no one kno ws about except you (the fight you walked awa y from , the person y ou were too afraid to confront, the courag eous mo ment when y ou overca me a deep fear). Once you have your list, think of at least one good thing that came out of the bad choi ces and one bad thing that came out of the good choices. This is an exercise in breaking down labels, gett ing more in touch with how flexib le reali ty reall y is. If you pay atten tion, you may be able to see that not one but many good things came from your bad dec isions while many bad ones are tangled up in your good dec isions. For exa mple, you might have a wonderful job but wound up in a terr ible relationship at work or crashed your car whil e com muting. You might love being a mother but know that it has drastica lly curta iled your personal freedom . You may be single and very happ y at how much you’ve grown on your own, yet you have also missed the growth that comes from being m arried to som eone y ou deep ly love. No singl e decision you ever made has led in a straigh t line to where you find yourse lf now . You peek ed down some roads and took a few steps before turning back. You followed som e roads that came to a dead end and others that got lost at too many intersec tions. Ulti mately, all roads are connec ted to all other roads. So break out of the mindset that your life consists of good and bad choic es that set your destin y on an unswerving course. Your l ife is the product of y our awaren ess. Ever y choic e follows fro m that, and so does ever y step of growth."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Secret #7 EVER Y LIFE IS S PIRITUAL ONE OF THE PECULIARITIES of modern life is that peop le violen tly disagree over relig ious beliefs and then go on to lead similar lives. Nietzsche ’s famous remark that God is dead should be changed to God is optiona l. If the governm ent kept round-the- clock surve illan ce on those who felt that they were abiding by divine law and those who never gave a though t about God’s rule book, I imag ine the sum total of virtue and vice, love and hate, pea ce and violence, would look exa ctly the same. If anything, the balance of intoler ance and lovel essne ss would probabl y tilt toward the mos t loudl y relig ious people in an y socie ty. I’m not mentioning this to be cont entious. Rathe r, it’s as if the universe has a sense of humor , since at a deep level it’s impossible not to lead a spiritu al life. You and I are as deepl y engaged in making a world as a saint. You can’ t be fired from the job of crea ting a world, which is the essenc e of spiritua lity. And you can’ t resign from the job even when you refu se to sho w up. The universe is living through you at this moment. With or without beli ef in God, the chain of events leading from silent awaren ess to physical real ity remains intact. The operating system of the universe applies to ever yone alike, and it works along principl es that do not require your cooperat ion. However , if you decid e to lead a consciousl y spiri tual life, a change occurs. The princ iples of the operating system, which means the rules of creat ion, becom e personal. We’ve alread y touched upon many of the rules of creat ion; let’ s take a look at how we can line up th e universal with the personal. UNIVERSA L PERS ONAL Nothing in these statemen ts smacks of religion ; there isn’ t any spiritu al vocabul ary involved. Yet this first princip le is the whole basis for saying that religion (who se root word s in Latin mean “to tie back”) unites the Creator with his crea tion. The physical world mirrors a m ind; it carries intent ion and in telligenc e in ever y ato m. UNIVERSA L PERS ONAL In this princ iple, we see the beginn ings of all myth and arche types, all heroes and que sts. The colle ctiv e psyche shares a leve l of awareness that goes be yond indiv iduals. When you see other people as aspects of y ourself, you are actua lly seeing faces of mythical types. We are one human being wearing countless masks. When all the masks are stripped off, w hat rem ains is es senc e, the soul, the divin e spark. UNIVERSA L PERS ONAL In the one real ity, consciousness creates itself, which is the sam e as sa ying that God is inside his creat ion. Ther e is no place outside cre ation for divini ty to stand—om nipresenc emeans that if any plac e exists, God is there. But where as God can be attent ive to an infinitud e of worlds, human beings use attent ion select ivel y. We put it one place and take it awa y from anothe r. By paying attention we add the creativ e spark, and that part of our experien ce, ei ther positive or nega tive, will gro w. Violenc e begets violenc e, but so too does love beget love. UNIVERSA L PERS ONAL The war between relig ion and scien ce is old and nearl y exhausted, but on one point, neith er side is will ing to budge. Religion sees design in natur e as proof of a creato r. Science sees random ness in nature as proof of no design at all. Yet, ther e has never been a culture based upon chaos, includ ing the subcul ture of science. Con sciousnes s looks at the univ erse and sees design ever ywhere, even if the spaces in between looked disor ganized and rando m. For the individual, it’s impossible not to see order—ev ery aspect of life from the fam ily outward is based on it. Your brain is set up to perceive patt erns (even an inkb lot looks like some kind of image, no matter how hard you try not to see one) because it took patterns of cells to make a brain. The mind is ulti mately a machine for making meaning, even when it flirts with mean inglessness, as the twent ieth and the twent y-first centuri es have done so well. UNIVERSA L PERS ONAL"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Nature loves efficien cy, which is ver y odd for something supposedl y working at rando m. When you drop a bal l, it falls straight down without taking unexpec ted detours. When two molecules with the potent ial for bonding meet, they alwa ys bond—ther e is no room for indec ision. This expendi ture of least ener gy, also call edthe law of least effort, covers human beings, too. Cert ainl y our bodies cannot escape the efficienc y of the che mical processes going on in each cell, so it is probab le that our whole being is wrapped up in the same principl e. Cause and effect aren’ t just linked; they are linked in the mos t efficien t way pos sible. This argument also applies to personal growth—th e idea is that ever yone is doing the best he or she can from his or her own level of consciousness. UNIVERSA L PERS ONAL This principl e is baffling to the religious and scien tific alike. Man y religious people believe that God crea ted the world in his image, which implies that creation had nowhere to go after that (except perhaps to devolve from its initial perfect ion). Scient ists acc ept that entrop y is inexorab le, entrop y being the tend enc y of ener gy to dissipate. Thus, in both systems it’s a proble m that DNA is a billion times mor e com plex than the first prim ordi al atoms, that the human cortex has vastl y incr eased in size over the past 50,000 years, that life appeared out of iner t che micals, and that new thoughts appear ever y day out of the blue. Entrop y still makes us grow old; it still causes cars to rust and stars to grow cold and die. But the drive of evolut ion is equa lly inexorabl e. Nature has decided to evolve, whatever our opinions about that m ay be. UNIVERSA L PERS ONAL According to a com monly held idea, ancient cultur es saw a unified creation, while we moderns look on a fragm ented and divided world. The declin e of faith has been blamed for this, as has the absenc e of myth, tradi tions, and socia l bonding. But I believ e the oppo site is true : The ancien t way of understand ing could barel y explain a sliver of all the pheno mena in Nature, while physics toda y is on the verge of a “theor y of ever ything.” The eminent physicist John Wheel er makes a crucia l point when he says that before Einst ein, human beings thought that they were looking at Nature “out there,” as if through a plat eglass window , trying to figure out what extern al reality was doing. Thanks to Einst ein, we realize that we are embedded in Nature; the observer changes reality by the very act of observat ion. Therefor e, despite a widespread feeling of psycholog ical alien ation (the resul t of techno logy’s outstripp ing our ability to keep meaning alive), the dualit y of man and Nature is shrinking with each succ essive genera tion. UNIVERSA L PERS ONAL Adap tation is a miraculous thing because it proce eds by quantu m leaps. When some ancestra l dinosaurs developed feathers, they hit upon an adapt ation that would be perfec t for winged flight. The cells on the outside of their bodies, which were hard and scal y, were useful as armor, but cou ld not contr ibute to soaring aloft. It’s as if evolut ion set itself a new proble m and then took a crea tive leap to get ther e. The old use of scales was abandoned for a new world of winged flight (and those same scales would take a leap in a different direc tion when they turned into hair , allowing the deve lopm ent of furr y mammals). Science and relig ion both worr y about this. Science doesn ’t like the notion that evolut ion know s where it’s going; Darwinian mutations are supposed to be rando m. Religion doesn ’t like the notion that God’ s perfect creat ion changes when someth ing new is needed. Yet this is a case where exp lanat ions have taken a backse at. Without a doubt, the physical world adapts itse lf b y crea tive leaps tha t tak e plac e at a deeper level— call this l evel geneti c or conscious, as y ou will. UNIVERSA L PERS ONAL Swirl ing chaos is a reali ty, but so is order and growth. Which is dominant? Science has yet to arrive at a conclusion because more than 90 percen t of the physical univ erse is composed of mysterious dark matter. Since it has yet to be observed, it’s an open question what the fate of the cosmos might be. Relig ion is firmly on the side of order , for the simp le reason that God made the world out of chaos. Accord ing to scien ce, there is a delic ate balance between creation and destruct ion, with billions of years having elapsed in the mainten ance of that balanc e. Ho weve r, since cosmic forces on a huge scale haven’ t been able to rip apar t the delic ate fabric that wove the beginn ings of life, a reasonabl e person might conclud e that evolut ion is using chaos the way a pain ter uses the jumbled colors in his box. On the personal level, you can’ t reach unit y while you’re ruled by the whirling of though ts and impu lses in your head, but still you can use your mind to find its own source. Unity is the hidden purpose that evolut ion is working toward, using the fragm ented mind as a tool along the way. Like the cos mos, the surface of the mind looks chaotic, but ther e is a t idal pool of progress at work beneath. UNIVERSA L"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"PERS ONAL 1.

Yet the current superstring theori es that descended from Einstein use at least eleven dimensions to expl ain the visible world. Relig ion has alwa ys held that God inhabits a world beyond the five senses; scien ce needs the sam e transcendent realm to expla in how parti cles separated by bill ions of light years could act like mirror twins, how light can behave as both partic le and wave, and how black holes can transfer matter beyond the clutches of gravi ty and time. Ulti mately, the existenc e of multidi mensions is irrefu table.

The cosm ic joke is that the same laws will continu e to uphold y our life even though y ou don’ t recogn ize the m. The choic e is to be conscious or not, which brings us to the pos sibility for transfor mation. No one disputes the fact that life consists of chang e. But can a person, simpl y by alter ing his or her con sciousnes s, actual ly bring about a deep transform ation and not just another superfic ial chang e? Transform ation and change are two different things, as can be seen in any fair y tale. The poor girl left by her wicked step mother to scrub the firepla ce while her stepsisters go to the ball doesn’ t improve herself by attend ing night school. Cinderel la is touched by a ma gic wand and whisked of f to the palac e as a co mpleted, transfor med crea ture.

More impor tant, this fant asy disguises the wa y true transform ation tak es place."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":" The key to true transfor mation is that nature doe sn’t mov e forward in step- by-step movements. It takes quantu m leaps al l the time, and when it does, old ingredi ents aren’ t sim ply reco mbined. Som ething new appears in creat ion for the first time, an emergent property. For exa mple, if you exa mine hydrogen and oxygen, they are light, gaseous, invisible, and dry. It took a transfor mation for those two elements to com bine and crea te water , and when that happen ed, an entirel y new set of pos sibilities emerged with it, the most impor tant from our point of view being life itself. The wetness of water is a perfec t exa mpl e of an emer gen t propert y. In a universe without wate r, wetness can’ t be derived by shu ffling around propert ies that alre ady exist. Shuffling only produces chang e; it isn’ t sufficien t for transfor mation. Wetness had to emer ge as something complete ly new in crea tion. Once you look closel y enough, it turns out that ever y che mical bond produces an emergen t propert y. (I gave the exa mple in passing of sodiu m and chlor ine—two poison s that when combin ed produce salt, anoth er basic element of life.) Your bod y, which is bonding millions of molecu les ever y second, depends on transfor mation. Brea thing and digestion, to mention ju st two processes, harness transfor mation. Food and air aren’ t just shuf fled around but, rather , under go the exact che mical bonding needed to keep you alive. The sugar extr acted from an orange trave ls to the brain and fuels a thought. The emer gen t propert y in this case is the newness of the thought: No molecul es in the histor y of the universe ever combined to produce that result. Air enter ing your lungs com bines in thousands of ways to produce cells that have never existed before in just the way the y exist in you, and when you use oxygen to move, your musc les are perform ing actions that, however they may be sim ilar to those of other peopl e, are unique expressions of y ou.

Your area of kno wledge is life itse lf and the movement of consciousness on ever y level. Kno wingness feels wise, confident, unshakab le, and y et humble.

Ther efore, life isn’ t limited to plants and animals—ever ything posse sses a glowing, animated vitality. Rever ence for life feels warm , connec ted, and exhilar ating."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":" Nonviolen ce means being in harm ony with ever y action. There is no opposition between what you do and what anyone else does. Your desires do not clash with another person’ s well-being. When you look around you see conflic t in the world at large but not in your world. You emana te pea ce like a force field that subdue s conf lict in your surroundings. Nonviol ence feels peac eful, sti ll, and com pletely without resistan ce. Fearlessness means total securit y. Fear is a jolt from the past; it reminds us of the moment when we left a place of belonging and found ourselves in a place of vulnerabi lity. The Bhagav ad Gita says that fear is born of separation, impl ying that the original cause of fear was the loss of unit y. Ulti mately, that separation is not a fall from grace but a loss of who y ou reall y are. To be fear less feels, ther efore, l ike y ourself. Wholeness means including ever ything, leaving noth ing out. At present we each experi ence life sliced up into bits of time, bits of exper ience, bits of activ ity. We cling to our limited sense of self to protec t the slices from fall ing apart. But it’s impossible to find continu ity in this way, hard as the ego tries in its struggle to make life hang togethe r. Whol eness is a state beyond personalit y. It emer ges when “I am” as it app lies to you is the sam e “I am” ever ywhere. Whol eness feels solid, eternal, without beginning or end. True transform ation, in my view , depends on the emergenc e of these propert ies as your personal exper ience. The y are prim al qualit ies embedded in awareness; they weren’ t invented by hum an beings or projected out of lack, need, or hunger . You cannot experien ce any of them by attaining more of what you alread y have. Being as nice as possible to others and causing no harm isn’t the same as nonviolenc e in the spiritu al sense. Showing courage in the face of danger isn’t the same as fearlessness. Feel ing stable and well put together isn’ t the sam e as w holen ess. One mus t emphasize that however unrea chabl e these things sound, they are com pletely natur al—the y are extensions of a process of transform ation that has been with you all your life. Each of us is alread y an emer gent propert y of the universe, a total ly new crea tion from our parents’ genes. And yet ther e is a deep er magic at work. At the che mical level, your parents’ genes were only reco mbin ed; you got som e from one person and some from anoth er. The survival of a certain gene pool extend ed to include a new gener ation ; it didn’ t suddenl y break down into a new and unknown s ubstanc e. Som ehow nature used those old build ing blocks to perform a feat of alche my because you are not a reconfigured genet ic repl ica. Your genes are just a supporting structure for a unique exper ience. DNA is the universe’ s way of beco ming conscious of itself. It took eyes for the universe to see what it looks like, ears to hear what it sounds like, and so on. To make sure that it didn’ t lose interest, the universe created you so that it could be conscious of itself in a way that had never appe ared before. Thus, you are an expression of eterni ty and of this ver y second, both at once. Transform ing yourself is like get ting pregnant. Ev ery wom an who decid es to get pregnant is making a personal decision and yet sub mitting to a tremendous force of nature. On the one hand, she exer ts free will ; on the other , she is caught up in inexor able even ts. Once she has a fertil ized seed inside her womb, nature takes over ; producing a child is something you do and at the sam e time it is som ething that is happening to you. The sam e can be said for any other true transform ation. You can make a persona l decision to be spiri tual, but when spiri t reall y takes hold, you are caught up in forces far beyond yourself. It’s as if a sur geon is called into the operat ing room for an essenti al sur gery and looks down to find that the pat ient on the tab le is hims elf. We’ve covered the ten principl es that serve as the opera ting system of one real ity. But mos t peopl e are firm ly entrench ed in ano ther operating system— the system of duali ty. The y live accord ing to the assumpt ion that they are separa te, isola ted ind ividua ls in a rando m cosm os where what happens “in here” is not refle cted “out ther e.” How, then, does a person shift from one operat ing system to the other? Unit y is tota lly different from dual ity, but you don’ t have to wait for the end of this journe y to live as if you are ther e in the next. Right now you are living as if limitation and separa tion mus t be true; therefor e, you aren’ t leav ing room for them not to be true. Even so, a hidden inte llig ence is preserv ing the incredib le orderl iness of life while allowing chang e to swirl around in appar ent chaos. If exposed to sunlight on a fresh spring day, a living cell would wither and turn to dust, and its DNA would blow awa y in the wind. But such apparen t fragili ty has survived two billion years of constant assaul t fro m th e ele ments.

Then a univ ersal law reveals itse lf: Wholeness remains the same no matter how much it changes. Your task is to make wholeness more real in your life. As long as you remain on the level where change is dom inan t, there is no pos sibi lity of trul y beco ming new . Duali ty maintains its operating system from moment to moment, and as long as you are plugged into it, that system seems real, workable, reliab le, and self- valida ting. The other operat ing system, the one based on wholeness, works far better than the system you are used to. Wholeness is also real, workable, reliable, and self-va lidat ing. For the sake of getting our bearings, let’s look at some familiar situat ions and see how each system would handle the m. You arrive at work one day to find out through the grapevine that your com pan y is downsizing. No one can tell you if your job is at risk, but it might be. In the operat ing system of dual ity, the following implica tions start to com e into pla y: I could lose the one th ing I need to support m yself. Som eone else has control over m y destin y. I am fac ed with so mething unpredi ctab le and unkno wn. I don’ t deserve to be blind- sided like this. I could be hurt if things go w rong for m e. These are all familiar thoughts whenev er you find yourse lf in crisis. Som e people manage the threa t better than others; you yourself have been through sim ilar situations with more or less success. Yet these concerns are just part of an operat ing system. The y are progra mmed into the software of th e ego with its tota l fixation on keeping ever ything under contro l. Wha t is really being threa tened here is not the loss of a job but loss of contro l. This reveals just how fragile the ego’ s grip actu ally is. Now let’s refra me the situation in terms of the opera ting system program med from wholeness, or one reality. You come to work to find that the compan y is downsizing, and the following implica tions begin to come into play: My deep er self cre ated this situa tion. Whatever happens, there is a reason. I am surprised, but this change doesn ’t affect who I a m. My life is unfold ing accord ing to what is best and m ost evolution ary for m e. I can’ t lose what’s real. The extern als will fall into pla ce as the y need to. Whatever happens, I can’ t be hurt. You can see immediately that plugg ing into the second opera ting system brings a far grea ter sense of securi ty. Wholeness is safe; dual ity isn’ t.

But it does. Reali ty shifts as you do, and when you change your perc eption of being separate, the one real ity responds by shifting with you. The reason ever yone doesn’ t notice this is that the ego- based world with all its dem ands, pres sures, dram a, and excesses is highl y addic tive, and like any addict ion it needs a daily fix as well as den ial that there is any way out. By giving your alleg iance to the one rea lity inst ead, you won’ t end the addi ction immediately, but you will begin to starve it. Your ego and personalit y, which give you limited awaren ess of who you are, will be put on noti ce that clinging and grasping mus t come to an end. Your condit ioning from the past that told you how to win out over the outside world will no longer help you survive. The support you counted on from externa l sources such as fam ily, friends, status, possessions, and mo ney will no longer ma ke you feel secure. Rest assured that percept ion is flex ible enough to let go of the addict ion to dualit y. Any event can be seen as com ing from the creat ive cen ter in oneself. At this very moment I can look at any part of my life and say “I made that.” Then it is only one step awa y to ask “W hy did I make that?” and “What do I want to make instead?” Let’s take another exa mple: You stop at a red light on the way hom e, but the car behind you doe sn’t stop and rear -ends you. When you jump out to confront the other driver , he is not apologet ic. Sullenl y, he begins to give you his insurance inform ation. In one opera ting system the fol lowing i mplica tions co me into pla y: This stranger doesn’ t have my best in terests in mind. If he is l ying, I could be left with all the da mages. I am the aggriev ed part y, and he should recogn ize that. I ma y have to force him to cooperat e. As these ideas com e into play, consider the possibil ity that the car acciden t didn’ t cause them—the y were alread y imprinted in your mind waiting for the moment they’d be need ed. You aren’ t seeing the situation as it reall y is but only through your progra mmed percept ion. In a different opera ting system the following implicat ions are equa lly valid: This accid ent was no acc ident ; it’s a refle ction of m yself. This stranger is a messeng er. When I find out why this event happened, I will uncover so me aspect of m yself. I need to pay more attent ion to some kind of hidden or stuck ener gy. When I deal with it, I will be glad this accid ent happen ed. Does the second viewpoin t seem impossible, or a matter of wishful think ing? Actua lly, it is the natura l way to perceiv e the situation from the viewpoin t of one real ity. The first viewpoint was imprinted by circu mstances in your ear ly life— you had to be tra ined to see others as strangers and to assum e that acc idents are random events. But instead of relying on such limited consciousness, you can open yourself to expand ed possibil ities. The larger viewpoint is more generous to you and to the other drive r. You aren’ t antagon ists but, rath er, equa l players in a scene that is trying to tell both of you something. The larger viewpoin t holds no blame. It puts respon sibility equal ly on ever y player and allows equal ly for growth. A car acc ident is neith er right nor wrong —it is an opportunit y to recl aim who you are, a crea tor.

CHAN GING YO UR REALITY TO ACCO MMO DA TE THE SEVENTH SECRET The seventh lesson is about alche my. By any measure, alche my is magical. You can’ t turn lead into gold by heating it, beating it, molding it into differen t shapes, or com bining it with any known substance. Those are sim ply physical chang es. Lik ewise, you will never cause an inner transfor mation by taking your old self and ham mering it with criticism , heat ing it up with exc iting experien ces, reshaping how you look physically, or connect ing with new peop le. How , then, does the ma gic work ? It work s accord ing to the prin ciples that make up the univ erse’ s opera ting system.

Secret #8 EVIL IS NOT YO UR ENEMY THE MOST GRIEVOU S FAILURE of spiri tual ity occurs in the face of evil. Idealist ic and loving people who would never harm another person find themse lves drawn into the maelstro m of war . Faiths that prea ch the existenc e of one God m ount campa igns to kil l infid els. Relig ions of love devolve in to partisan hatred of hereti cs and those who threa ten the faith. Even if you think you hold the ultimate truth in your hand s, there is no guarante e that you will escape from evil. More violence has occurred in the name of relig ion than for any other reason. Hence the bitt er aphoris m: God handed down the truth, and the Devil said, “Let me organize it.” There is also the more subtle failur e of passivit y—stand ing by and letting evil have its way. Perhaps this reflec ts a secret belief that evil is ultimately more powerful than good. One of the mos t spiri tual figures in the twentie th cen tury was asked how England should hand le the threa t of Nazis m. He rep lied:"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":" I want you to fight Nazis m without arms. I would like you to lay down the arms you have as being useless for saving you or hum anit y.

The author of this passage was Mahat ma Gandhi, and need less to say his “open letter ” to the Brit ish was greeted with shock and outrag e. Yet Gandhi was being true to the princip le of Ahimsa, or nonviol ence. He succ essfull y used passive nonviolenc e to persuade the British to grant freedom to India, so by refu sing to go to war against Hitler—a stand he took throughout World War II— Gandhi was consisten t in his spiri tual beli efs. Would Ahimsa really have worked to persuade Hitl er, a man who declar ed that “war is the fath er of all things” ? We will never know . Certain ly passivi ty itself has a dark aspect. The Catho lic Church marks as one of its darkest eras the years when it perm itted millions of Jew s to be kill ed under Nazis m, to the extent that Ital ian Jews were rounded up with in sight of th e Vatican windo ws. So let’s acknowledge that spiritua lity has alread y failed on coun tless occ asions to dea l with evil. Turning awa y from teach ings that have only allowed evil to propagat e and spread, the one real ity opens a new way, because if there is only one reality, evil has no spec ial power and no separate existence. There is no cos mic Satan to rival God, and even the war between good and evil is only an illusion born of dual ity. Ulti mately, both good and evil are forms that consciousnes s can choose to take. In that sense, evil is no different from good. Their similarity goes back to the source. Two babies born on the sam e day may grow up to commit evil on the one hand and good on the other , but as babi es it cannot be true that one was crea ted evil. The potent ial for right and wrong exists in the ir consciousness, and as the babies grow up, their consciousness will be shaped by ma ny forces. These forces are so com plex that labe ling som eone as purel y evil makes no sense. Let me list the forces that shape ever y newborn chi ld: • Parental guidanc e or the lack of i t • The presence of love or its absence • The cont ext of th e whole fa mily • Peer pressure at school and social pres sure throughout lif e • Persona l tenden cies and react ions • Indoctrina ted beliefs and religious teaching • Karm a • The tid e of histor y • Role m ode ls • Collec tive consciousness • The appe al of m yths, heroes, and idea ls Ever y force listed above is influ encing your choices and invisibl y pushing you into action. Because reality is tangled up in all these influ ences, so is evil. It takes all these forces for evil and good to emerge.

Think of a person as a building with hundreds of elec tric al lines feeding count less messages into it, powering a host of different projects. Looking at the building, you see it as one thing, a single object standing there. But its inner life depends on hundreds of signals co ming into it. So doe s yours. In and of itself, none of the forces feed ing into us is evil. But under this m enu of influen ces, each person m akes choices. I believe that any evil incl inat ion com es down to a cho ice made in consciousness. And those choices seemed to be good when they were made. This is the centr al paradox behind evil actions, because with rare except ions, peopl e who perform evil can trace their motives back to decisions that were the best they could make given the situa tion. Children who suffer abuse, for exa mple, frequent ly wind up as adults abusing their own children. You would think that they’d be the last ones to resort to family violence, having been its victim. But in their minds, other , nonviolen t, options aren’ t avail able. The contex t of abuse, acting on their minds since earl y childhood, is too powerful and overshadows freedo m of choice. People in dif ferent states of awareness won’ t share the sam e defin ition of good and bad. A prim e exa mpl e is the social enslave ment of women around the world, which seems totally wrong in the modern world but is fed in many countr ies by trad ition, relig ious sanction, social valu e, and family practi ces, going back for centur ies. Until very recent ly, even the vict ims of those forces would see the role of the helpless, obed ient, childlike woman as “ good.” Evil depends comple tely on one’ s level of consciousness. You can bring this messag e hom e by consider ing seven differen t definit ions of evil. Which one do you instinc tivel y agree with ? WHA T IS THE WORST EVIL? Seven Perspectives 1. The worst evil is to hurt someon e ph ysical ly, or endang er the ir survival. 2. The worst evil is to enslave people econo mically, depriv ing the m of an y chan ce to succ eed and pro sper . 3. The worst evil is to destro y pea ce and bring about disorder . 4. The worst evil is to entr ap people ’s m inds. 5. The worst evil is to destro y beau ty, cre ativ ity, and the freedom to explore. 6. The worst evil is often dif ficult to te ll fro m good, since al l of crea tion is relat ive. 7. There is no evil, onl y the shift ing patt erns of consciousness in an et ernal dance. The vast majori ty of peopl e would probabl y choose the first two definit ions, because physical harm and deprivat ion are so threaten ing. At this leve l of consciousness, evil means not being able to survive or earn a living, and good means physical safet y and econo mic secur ity. In the next two levels, evil is no long er physical but mental. One’s greatest terror isn’ t being deprived of food but rather being told what to think and forced to live with chaos and unrest. Good means inner pea ce and the free flow of insight and intui tion. The next two levels are even more refin ed; they have to do with crea tivi ty and vision. One’ s greatest fear is not being allowed to expres s oneself or being forced to label others as evil. A deepl y spiritua l person doesn’ t view good and evil as rigid categori es but has begun to acc ept that God had a purpose in crea ting both. Good is free expres sion, openness to all new things, reveren ce for both the dark and light aspects of life. Final ly, the last level sees the entire play of good and evil, light and shadow , as an illusion. Ever y exper ienc e brings union with the creator; one lives as a co-crea tor i mmersed in God consciousness. The one reality accepts all these definitions, as it mus t, because anything that consciousnes s can perce ive is rea l to the perceiv er.

If you wake up one day to sudden ly discover that you hate someone else, that ther e is no way out of a situat ion except violence, that love isn’ t an option, consider how subtl y you arrived at your position. It took a whole world to throw you or anyone else into the arm s of what is labeled as good or evil. Having intern aliz ed these forces, you refle ct the world just as the world refl ects you. This is what it means in prac tica l terms to have the world in y ou. Yet evil cannot be your enem y if the world is in you; it can only be another aspect of yourself. Ever y aspect of the self is worth y of love and compassion. Ever y aspec t is nec essary to life, and none is exc luded or ban ished into darkness. This view may seem even more naive at first than Gandhi’ s passivit y, for it appears that we are being asked to love and understand a murderer the same as a saint. Jesus taugh t exact ly that doctr ine. But translat ing love and co mpassion into dif ficult situations has been the crux of spiritua lity’s huge failur e: Violen ce causes love to break down, turn ing it into fear and hatred. But evil doesn’t actually do this. The shaping forces on consciousness do. H ere is w here good and evi l beco me equal. I can giv e a striking exa mple of what I me an. In 1971, students at Stanford Universit y were asked to volunt eer for an unusual experi ment in role playing. One group of students was to pretend that they were prison guards in char ge of anoth er group who pretended to be prisoners. Although it was understood that this was make- beli eve, a jail setting was provided, and the two group s lived toge ther for the duration of the experi ment. According to plan, ever yone would play their roles for two weeks, but af ter only six da ys the prison experi ment had to be termin ated. The reason? The boys chosen for their mental hea lth and mor al values turned into sadisti c, out-of-control guards on the one hand and depres sed vict ims of exorbit ant stre ss on the other . The professor s conduct ing the experi ment were shocked but couldn’ t den y what had occurr ed. The lead researcher , Philip Zimbardo, wrote: “M y guards repe atedl y stripped their prisoners naked, hooded them, chained them, denied them food or bedding privileg es, put them into solitar y confine ment, and made them clean toilet bowls with their bare hands.” Those who didn’ t descend to such atro cious behavior did nothing to stop the ones who did. (The parall el with infa mous acts by Ameri can prison guards in Iraq in 2004 pro mpt ed Zimbardo to bring the Stanford experi ment back to ligh t after more than thir ty years.) There was no extre me to which the student guards would not resort short of outright physical torture. Zimbardo mournfull y recal ls, “As the boredo m of their job incr eased, they began using the prisoners as their playthings, devising ever more hum iliating and degrad ing games for them to play. Over time, these amuse ments took a sexual turn, such as having the prisoners simulate sodo my on each other . Once aware of such deviant behav ior, I closed down the Stanford prison.” Where did this runawa y abuse come from? For comfor t’s sake, we usuall y say that it exists in a few “bad apples,” but the Stanford experi ment suggests som ething mor e disturbing: Evi l exists in ever yone as a shadow , for the very reason that the world is in ever yone. Being raised as a good person is a counter to the shadow of evil, of course, and if we return to our list of shaping forces on consciousness, each person would exhibi t a different map of influences. But if you are fortunate enough to have made choices on the good side of the equation, you mus t stil l acknowl edge tha t the shadow exists in y ou som ewhere. The shadow was formed by the sam e ever yday situa tions that shape our consciousness, and it is released by new situa tions that paral lel them. If you were abused as a child, being around children can bring up those memories. The Stanford experi menters devised a list of conditions that cause peop le to do things we’d call evil, or at the very least alien to our true selves. I’ve expand ed on it in ligh t of what we know about dualis m and separation.

This list, as com pared to the first, feels as if some evil com ponent has entered. Leav ing aside prison s, where one might expect the worst in human nature to emer ge, as a ph ysician I’ve seen si milar abuse in hospital settings. Cer tainl y, hospita ls are not evil; the y were established to do good in the first place. But the shadow isn’ t about who is good or bad. It’s about sealed- up ener gies look ing for an outle t, and a hospital is rife with the very cond itions listed above : Pati ents are helpless under the authori ty of doctors and nurses; they are dehum aniz ed by the cold mechanist ic rout ine, isola ted from ever yday society, ma de mor e or less anon ymous as one “case” a mong thousands, and so forth. Given the right cir cumstances, everyon e’s shadow ener gy will emerge. Let ’s focus, then, on the shadow as the area where consciousness has beco me distorted to the poin t that evil choices might be made. (Keep in mind the word “might, ” since even under the most dehu manized condi tions, there are good people who rem ain good, which is to say tha t the y are abl e to resist or control the release of the ir shadow ener gies.) The fa med Swis s ps ychologist C. G . Jung was the first to use “ the shadow” as a clini cal term, but here I want to speak in genera l of the hidden places where we all repress things we feel guil ty about or asham ed of. I will ca ll th is place the shadow , and I bel ieve there are cert ain true things to be said about it: The shadow is personal and univ ersal at the sa me time. Anything can be stored there. Whatever is stored in darkness beco mes distorted. The int ensit y of shadow ener gies is a wa y of getting notic ed. Bringing consciousness to any ener gy defuses it. The shadow itself is not evil and therefor e not your enem y. By exa min ing each state ment, we get closer to rem oving the fearful demon we labe l—al most alwa ys in other people—as evil in carnat e. The shado w is personal and universal at the same time: Ever yone harbors a unique patt ern of sham e and"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"guilt. Simple things like nudit y, sexual intercourse, anger , and anxie ty give rise to enor mousl y complex feelings. In one socie ty, seeing your mother naked could be trivia l, while in another it could be such a trau matic experien ce that it can only be deal t with by shoving it down into the shadow . There is no sharp dist inction between personal feel ings, family feel ings, and socia l feelings. The y blend and weave togethe r. But even if you feel asha med that you hit a bull y on the playground when you were seven, and another person thinks doing the sam e thing was a valuabl e moment in developing personal courag e, to have a shadow is universal as well as personal. The hum an psyche was set up with a hiding place, and for mos t people that place is tota lly necessar y, given the enor mous dif ficu lty of facing one ’s darkest i mpu lses and deepest hum iliations. Anything can be stor ed there: A bank vaul t where you keep your most precious pos sessions is a hiding place as much as a prison dungeon. The same is true for the shadow . Although the term is used most of the time to describe a hiding plac e for negat ive ener gies, you have the power to turn positive to negat ive and vice versa. I once knew two sisters who were close as children but grew up as very different adults, the one a succ essful colleg e profes sor, the other a twice- divorced worker at a temporar y agenc y. The successful sister describes her childhood as wonderful ; the other sister describes hers as trau matic. “Remember when Dadd y locked you in the bathroo m for six hour s aft er y ou did something wrong?” I heard the unhapp y sister sa y to her sibling. “That was a turning point for m e. I could onl y imag ine how angr y and hopeless y ou felt.” The happ y sister looked very surprised. “Wh y didn’ t you ask me about that? I liked being alone, so I just went inside and told myself imag inar y stories. The incident was nothing.” And so our stories go th eir separate, high ly idios yncrat ic ways. The sam e incid ent had no emotiona l char ge for one sister , where as it was a source of anger and shame for the othe r. Great art can be made out of scenes of viol ence (witness Picas so’s Guernica ) and horror s can be concoct ed from holy virtu e (witn ess the crucif ixion of Jesus). In the unconscious, there is a full populat ion of unexa mined impulses. The sam e Stanford student who might debase himse lf as a sadistic prison guard could also be harboring artisti c talent that will never emerge unless the right situat ion allow s the unconscious m ind to rele ase what it is holding. Whatever is stor ed in darkness beco mes distorted: Awareness, like fresh water , is meant to flow , and when it can’ t, it turns stagnant. In your inner world, there are countless memories and repressed impulses. You do not allow these to flow , which is to say to be released; therefore, they have no choic e but to stagnate. Good impulses die for lack of being acted on. Lov e grow s timid and afraid when not expressed. Hatred and anxie ty loom larger than life. It is the prim ary proper ty of consciousness that it can organize itself into new pat terns and designs. If you don’ t allow consciousness to go where it needs to, howeve r, diso rgan ized ener gy is the resul t. For exam ple, if you ask peopl e to describ e how they fee l about their parents, a subject tha t most adults set aside as a thing of the past, you find that their memories from childhood are a confusing jumb le. Trivial even ts stand out as huge trau mas; other fam ily members are simp lified into cartoons; true feelings are hard or impossible to excava te. Thus, when a disturbed patient comes to a psychiatr ist to be hea led of a painful childhood wound, it often tak es mo nths if not y ears to separa te fac t fro m fantas y. The inten sity of shado w energi es is a way of getting noticed: Hiding something is not the same as kill ing it. Shado w ener gies remain alive. Even though you refuse to look at them, they aren’ t extingu ished—in fact, their desire for life beco mes all the more desperat e. To catch your atten tion as a parent, a child who is over looked will beco me mor e and m ore extreme in its behavior : first a ca ll for a ttent ion, then a cry, then a tan trum. Shadow ener gies follow much the sam e pattern. It seem s only reasonab le to see panic atta cks, for exa mpl e, as a hidden fear throwing a tantrum. That same fear first called out to be noticed in a norm al way, but when the person refused to noti ce it, a call turned into a cry and finall y ended up as a full-blown attack. Fear and anger are especia lly adept at incr easing the voltag e to the point where we feel that they are alien, evil, dem onic forces acting withou t our will. The y are actu ally just aspec ts of consciousnes s forced into inhu man intensit y by repression. Repression says, “If I don’ t look at you, you will leave me alon e.” To which the shado w answers, “I can do things that will m ake you look at me.” Bringing consciousnes s to any energy defuses it: This follows natura lly from the last state ment. If an ener gy dem ands your attent ion, then paying atten tion will begin to satisf y it. An overlooked child isn’ t plac ated by one glance. It takes time to chang e any behav ior for good or ill and, like children, our shadow ener gies get stuck in patterns and habits. But this doesn’ t alter the general truth that if you bring ligh t into the shadow , its distortions start to lessen and eventu ally are hea led. Is there time enough and patien ce to do the whole job thoroughl y?"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"There’ s no fixed answer to that. Depression, for exa mple, is a com plex respon se that can be hea led by insigh t, com passion, patien ce, caring attent ion from others, will ingness, and professional therap y. Or you can take a pill and not bothe r. The choice is personal and varies from person to person. Condit ions as apparent ly hopeless as childhood autis m have been cured by parents who spent enorm ous amounts of time and attention to bring a child back from darknes s. The darkness was a distor tion in consciousnes s that need ed ligh t to be cured. The shadow in all its forms requ ires consciousness in the form of light and love, and the onl y limit to heal ing is how much of ourselves we are willing to give to the pro ject. The shado w itsel f is not evil and ther efor e not your enemy: If the preceding state ments are true, then this one must be also. I real ize that for many people there is a huge barri er in the form of “the other ,” som eone outside themse lves whose evil is unquest ioned. Sixt y years ago “the other” lived in Germ any and Japan; thirt y years ago it lived in the Soviet Union; toda y it lives in the Middle East. Such people find evil easier to expl ain by never losing sight of “the other”—withou t an enem y, they would have to face the presence of evil inside themselv es. Ho w m uch mo re conven ient it is to kno w in advance that you are on the side of the angels! Seeing the shadow in yourse lf defuses the whole notion of “the other ” and brings closer the statemen t of the Rom an poet Terence: Nothing human is foreign to me. Can absolute evil be banished so quick ly, however? Polls show tha t a m ajorit y of people believ e in the existen ce of Sat an, and m any relig ious sects fir mly beli eve tha t the devil is loose in the world, secretl y changing histor y through his malignan t doings. It doesn ’t seem that good has a chance to conquer evil—perh aps their com bat is etern al, never to be finally settled. But you can still choose the side you want to be on. Tha t very fact remov es the absolu te from absolute evil, since by defini tion absolute evil would win ever y time, finding no obstacl e in the frail ty of human choice. Mo st people don’ t accep t this conc lusion, howeve r. The y watch the dram a of good and evil as if it and not they have the power , sitting me smerized b y pictures of the latest epide mic of cri me, war , and disaste r. You and I as individua ls can’ t solve the proble m of evil on a mass scal e, and this sense of being powerless magnif ies the belief that good in the end reall y isn’ t going to win. But to grappl e with evil, you have to look at it, not in horror or as specta cle but with the sam e attention that you’d give to any proble m you are seriousl y interest ed in. Many people find it taboo to look at evil; the theme of most horror movies is that if you com e too close, you get what you deserve. But the facts abou t persona l evil are more mundane than horrif ying. In all of us, there are impu lses fuel ed by a sense of inju stice. Or we feel that som eone has done us unfo rgivab le harm from which we harbor grudge s and grievanc es. When you have been treated unjustl y or personal ly harm ed, the natura l emotion is anger . If this anger can’ t get out, it festers and grows in the shadow . Lashing out when holding it back no longer works; this anger leads to a cycle of violen ce. Guilt can make you feel like a bad person simply for having an impulse or enter taining a thought. This is a kind of double bind: If you lash out and return the harm done to you, you have done something evil, but if y ou keep the anger inside and harbor it, you can feel just as evi l. Yet violenc e can be tamed by breaking it down into manage able bits. Negativ e emotions feed off certain aspects of the shadow tha t are ver y manag eable : The shadow is dark. Ever yone has a s hadow bec ause of the natural contrast between darkness and th e ligh t. The shadow is secret. We store impulses and feelings ther e tha t we wish to keep private. The shadow is dangerous. Repressed feelings have the power to convinc e us that they can kill us or make us go insane. The shadow is shrouded in myth. For generations, people have seen it as the la ir of dragons and m onsters. The shadow is irrational. Its i mpu lses fight against reason; the y are explosive and tota lly willful. The shadow is primitive. It’s benea th the dignit y of a civil ized person to explor e this dom ain, which reeks of the smell of the charn el house, the prison, the lun atic asylum, and a public lava tory."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":" Negativi ty assum es its overwhel ming power from the fact that it feeds off all these qual ities at once : A secret, dark, primitive, irrat ional, dangerous, mythical evil is much less convin cing if you break it down into one quali ty at a time. But this process of bringing evil down to scale won ’t be convinc ing unti l you appl y it to yourse lf. So let’s do that. Take a volat ile issue at this moment: terroris m. By any measure, to infl ict terror on inno cent people is an act of cowardl y, despic able evil. Now pull closer .

No m atter how evil your impulse is, i t can be broken down into steps to resolve it : Darkness: Ask yourself if it’s really you having this impulse, the you whom you see in the mirror ever y morning. Darkness is dealt with by bringing in the light. Freud called this replac ing Id with Ego, meaning that “It” (the unnam ed thing inside us) needs to be gathered back into the real m of “I” (the person you kno w yourse lf to be). In sim pler terms, awareness needs to go into th e plac e where it has been shut out. Secr ecy: Confide y our evi l impu lse to someon e you trust. Secre cy is deal t with by honestl y facing things that seem shameful or guilt y. You face any and ever y feeling head on, without denia l. Danger: Rel ease your anger out loud, staying with it as it decreases. Have the intent ion that this release is not merely venting, but trul y letting go of y our rage. Danger is deal t with b y defusing the bo mb; that is, y ou find the explosive anger tha t lurks inside and y ou dispel it. Anger is the primal drive of evil impu lses. Like all impulses, it com es in varying degrees, and even a towering rage can be deflat ed until it defuses into controll ed rage, then justifi ed anger , and on down to righteous indigna tion, and finall y personal offense. Personal offense is not difficult to dispel, once you manage to rele ase the built- up intensit y that turns into uncontroll able rage. Myt h: Name a hero who would dea l with your feel ings in a differen t way and still remain heroic. Violence is part of herois m but so are m any other positive qualit ies. Myth is imaginativ e and creativ e. Therefore you can take any myth and mold it along different lines—Satan him self beco mes a com ic figure in mediev al miracle plays, a ploy that leads direct ly to the comic villains in Jam es Bond films. Myth is nothing but metamorphosis; therefor e, this level gives us a powerful way to turn dem ons into helpers of the god s, or defe ated ene mies of the ange ls. Irrational ity: Come up with the best argum ent for not acting on your rage. Don ’t do this emotion ally: See yourse lf as an adult counselor of a wayward teenag er about to ruin his life. What would you say to make him see reason ? Irrationa lity is deal t with by persuasion and logic. Em otions are much more gripp ing and powerful than reason, but they will not be able to escape their world, where only feelings prevail, unti l the thinking process gives them a reason to feel different ly. On their own, without mind, feel ings remain the sam e and grow more intense over time. (A com mon exa mple: Imagine yourself enraged because a kid in a red baseba ll cap keyed your car. He runs awa y and escapes. The nex t day you see him and run up, but when he turns around, it’s a different kid. Rage turns into apolog y because the mind was able to introdu ce a simp le idea: wrong person.)

At this level, your “reasonabl e” sense of in justic e is exper ienced as blind pani c and bl ind feroci ty. Even though your impulses may never cros s the line into violenc e, ordinar y impulses intensif y in the shadow , where you can’ t see them. Whenever you hear yourse lf sounding resentful or angr y without provocat ion, whenev er you find yourself on the ver ge of tears for no reason, whenever you cannot expla in why you suddenl y made a rash decision, you are actu ally feel ing the effects of ener gy covertl y building up in the shadow . The shadow has grown used to being repressed; therefor e, to access this region of the mind doesn’ t happen easil y. Nor is direct assaul t effective. The shadow kno ws how to resist; it can slam the door and hide its dark ener gy even deeper . If you recal l the concept of catharsis from Greek traged y, it was though t that only by deepl y frightening the aud ience could the y open up and fee l pity. Catharsis is a form of purifi cation. In this case it was arrived at second- hand, by having the audien ce see fearful actions in the life of a charac ter on stage. But this form of trick ery doesn ’t alwa ys work. You can go to a horror film toda y and com e out of the theater com pletely unmoved, the higher brain mutter ing, “I’ve seen those specia l effects before.” (In the sam e way, telev ised new s, after fifty years of displ aying gruesom e imag es of war and violen ce, has done little more than inure its viewers to such images, or worse, turned them into entertain ment.) Dischar ge is natural to the bod y, howeve r, and simply by observing these shadow ener gies, we give them access to the conscious level of the mind. People assum e that the dark side of hum an nature has unstoppabl e power; Satan has been elev ated into the equival ent of a negativ e God. But when it’s broken down, evil turns out to be a distorted respon se to ever yday situat ions. Imag ine yourse lf sitting alone at night in an empty hou se. Som ewhere else in the house, there’ s a noise. Instantl y you recogni ze the sound of a door creaking open. Ever y sense goe s on full aler t; your bod y freezes. With difficult y, you resist the urge to call out, and yet a tremendous anxiet y has leapt out of hiding. A robber! A murderer! Ever yone has suffered through these agoni zing seconds before the creaking door turns out to be a loose floorboard or the entr y of som eone coming hom e unexpected ly. But what reall y happened in that moment of dread? Your mind took an insignif ican t bit of data from your environ ment and caused it to take on mean ing. In itse lf, the sound of a creaking door is trivi al, but if you unconsciousl y harbor fears of being attacked in the dark—and no one can help harboring such fears—the leap from a bit of sensor y data to full- blown anxie ty seems auto matic. But in the gap betwe en the noise and y our reac tion, an interpr etat ion crep t in, and it was the intensit y of the in terpret ation (“Som eone’ s breaking in! I’m going to be kill ed!”) th at cre ated the dange r. What I’m suggesting is that evil is born in the gap between bod y and mind. Ther e is no powerful ruler of the kingdom of evil. Satan started out as a moment of sensor y input that got wildl y out of hand. Take the fear of flying, one of the most com mon phobias. People who suffer from it usua lly have a vivid memory of when it began. The y were on a flight and sudden ly, just as with the creak ing door , som e noise of the plan e or a sudden jolt made their awareness grow supersensitiv e. Insignific ant sensat ions like cabin vibr ation and the rise and fall in the pitch of engine noise suddenl y felt om inous. Betwe en these sensat ions and the reac tion of fear there was a gap that lasted a fract ion of a second. Tiny as it was, this gap allowed an interpr etation (“W e’re going to crash! I’m going to die!”) to atta ch itself to what the bod y was feeling. An instant later, the typical signs of anxiet y—sweat y hands, dry mouth, racing pulse, dizzin ess, and nausea—added to the persua siveness of the thre at. Phobics rem ember their first moment of uncontro llab le panic without being able to take it apart in steps. Therefore, the y don’ t see their reaction as self-induced. That fear was a b y-product of the following ingredien ts: Situation: A nor mal situa tion is infused with som ething unusual or slight ly stressful."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":" Bodily response: We experi ence a ph ysical react ion tha t is associat ed with th e stress. Interpretation: These physical signals are label ed as signs of danger , and unconsciousl y the mind jum ps to the conclusion tha t the danger has to be real (the unconscious mind is ver y concre te, which is wh y nigh tmares see m as threat ening as ac tual events). Decision: The person chooses to think “I am afra id right now .” Because these ingredi ents fuse so quickl y, they seem to be a single response, when in fact ther e is a cha in of tiny even ts. Ever y link of the chain involves a cho ice. The reason we can’ t let raw sensation go without interpre ting it is that for reasons of surviva l the hum an mind was buil t to find meaning ever ywhere. Phobias can be treated by slowl y taking the phobic person back through the formative cha in of even ts, allowing him or her to make new interpr etat ions. By slowing the response down and giving the person time to look at it, the knot of fear can be undone. Gradual ly, the noises as soci ated with fl ying return to their neutral, nonthreat ening place. The flee ting gap between sensation and interpr etat ion is the birthplac e of the shadow . When you go into the gap and see how int angible ever ything is, the gho sts begin to disperse. Bec ause t errorism now weighs so heavil y on people’ s minds, the issue of mass evi l cannot be avoided. The two mos t troubling questions are “How did ordinar y people agree to part icip ate in such evil?” and “How could innocent people beco me the vi ctims of atroci ties?” The Stanford Prison Exper iment and our discus sion of the shadow com e close to answering these questions, but I can’ t give one answer to satisf y all com ers—an y time evil is brought up, we find ourselves visited by our own shadow . What could I have done about Auschwitz? a voice inside us says, usual ly in guilt y, accusing tones. No answer will ever reverse the past, but it ’s im portan t to reali ze tha t no answer should be expe cted to. The best approa ch to mass evil is not to keep remember ing it but to renounce it so com pletely in yourself that the past is purifi ed through y ou. My best answer to “How did ordinar y people agre e to part icip ate in such ev il?” lies in the pages you’ve just read. Evi l is born in the gap. The gap isn’ t anyone ’s priva te pos session. The gap contains colle ctive response s and colle ctiv e the mes. When an ent ire society accepts the the me of “the outsiders” who cause all the troub le, then evil has ever yone for a father and mo ther. Yet in ever y case of mass evil, there were thousands of people who didn’ t identif y with the colle ctiv e impu lse —the y resisted, escaped, hid, and tried to save others. It’s indiv idual choi ce that determ ines whether you latch on to the colle ctiv e the me and agre e to pla y it out. The second question, “How could innocen t people beco me the victi ms of atroc ities?” is more difficu lt, because almost ever yone’s mind is alre ady closed. The questioner doesn’ t want a new answer . Ther e is too much righteous anger , too much cert aint y that God turned his back, that no one wanted to risk their own lives to stop the enor mous evil being done to others. Are you certain of these things? Being certain is the opposite of being open. When I ask myself why six million Jew s perished or why equall y innoc ent masses perished in Rwanda, Cam bodia, or Stalin ist Russia, m y mo tive is first to re lease m y own sense of anguish. As long as I am overco me by angu ish or righteous anger or horror , my ability to choose has been shut down. What I should be free to choose is purifica tion, a return to innocenc e made pos sibl e by the shock of what happens when innocenc e isn’ t nurtured. You and I are respon sible for our part icip ation in the elements of evil even though we don ’t act out those elements on a mass scale. Bel ieving in them keeps our part icip ation going. So it’ s our dut y to stop beli eving in “harmless” anger , jealous y, and judg men t of others. Is there som e mystical reason why an innocen t person beco mes the target of evil? Of course not. People who talk about the karma of victims as if som e hidden fate is bringing down a rain of destru ction are speaking from ignorance. When an entir e society engages in mass evil, outer chaos refl ects inner turmoi l. The shadow has erupted on a mass scale. When this happens, innoc ent victims are caugh t in the storm , not because they have"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"some hidden karm a but because th e stor m is so overwhel ming tha t it engulfs ever yone. I don’ t view the relation of good and evil as a struggle of absolutes; the mechanis m that I’ve been describing, in which shadow ener gies build up hidden power by depriv ing a person of free choi ce, is too convin cing to me. I can see in myself that dark ener gies are at work, and being aware is the first step to illum inating the darkness. Awareness can rem ake any impu lse. Therefore, I don’ t accep t that evil people exist, only people who have not faced their shadows. There is alwa ys time to do that, and our souls are constan tly opening new ways to bring in the l ight. As long as tha t’s true, evil will never be funda mental to hu man nature. CHAN GING YO UR REALITY TO ACCO MMO DA TE THE EIGHTH SECRET The eighth secret is about the mind’s “dark ener gy,” to borrow a phrase from physics. The shadow exists out of sight. To find it, you have to be dedica ted to a journe y of descent. Think of this journe y as going back to retriev e parts of your life that have been abandon ed because you felt so asham ed or guilt y about them. The anger that erupts from the shado w is attach ed to past even ts that were never resolved. Now those events are over and gone, but their em otional residue isn’ t. Sha me, guilt, and fear cannot be accessed by think ing. The shadow isn’t a region of thoughts and words. Even when you have a flash of memory and recal l such emotions, you are using a part of the higher brain— the cortex —that canno t touch the shadow . The journe y of descen t begins only when you find the doorwa y to the lower brain, where experienc e is sorted out not accord ing to reason but accord ing to in tense fee lings. There is an ongoing drama inside your lower brain (iden tified with the limbic system, which processes emotions, and the repti lian brain, which reac ts in terms of raw thre at and surviva l). In this drama, many issues that would be interpret ed reasonabl y by the higher brain—get ting stuck in traf fic, losing out on a business deal, being passed over at work, having a girl turn you down for a date—trigg er irra tiona l responses. Without reali zing it, ever yday events are causing y our lower brain to draw the following conclusions: I am in danger . I mi ght be kill ed. I mus t go on the atta ck. I am so hurt, I wil l never recover . These people deserve to die. The y put m e in agon y. I don’ t deserve to exist. Ever ything is hopeless—I’ m lost in the dark forever . I’m cursed. Nobod y lov es me . To communic ate these fee lings on the page, I’ve had to verbal ize them, but in rea lity, the most appropriat e wa y to view them is as ener gy—s trong, impulsive forces that have an impetus all their own. Rest assured, no matter how free you feel from these shadow ener gies, they exist inside you. If they didn’ t, you would be in a stat e of tota l freedom , joy, and unboundedness. You would be in unit y, the stat e of innocen ce regain ed when the hidden ener gy of the shadow has been purified. Toda y you can begin to learn how to feel your way into the shadow . Shadow ener gies make themselv es known whenev er"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":" You can’ t talk about y our feel ings. You feel out of contro l. You feel a flash of pani c or dread. You want to feel strongl y, but y our m ind goes blank. You find y ourself breaking down in t ears for no reason. You have an irrat ional dislike for s omeon e. A reasonab le ar gumen t turns into warfare. You att ack so meone without provocation. There are count less other ways that the shadow gets entang led in ever yday situat ions, but these are among the mos t common. What they have in common is that a boundar y is crossed—a con trolled situat ion turns unexpect edly anxious or causes unexpect ed anger or dread. The next time you exper ience this, watch and see if you feel guilt y or asham ed of y ourself afterward; if so, then y ou have touched, however briefl y, on the shadow . An eruption of irrat ional feel ings isn’ t the same as releasing them. Venting is not purif icat ion. So don’ t mis take an outburst for ca tharsis. Shadow ener gy is purifi ed through the following steps: • The nega tive feeling com es up (ange r, grief, anxiet y, hostili ty, resent ment, self-pit y, hopelessness). • You ask to release it. • You exper ienc e the feeling and follow where it wants to go. • The fee ling l eaves through breath, sound, or bodil y sen sations. • You have a sense of rele ase afterward, coupled with an understand ing of what the feel ing m ean t. It’s the last step that tells the tale: When a shadow ener gy truly leaves, there is no resistanc e anymore, and you see som ething you didn’ t see before. Insight and release go togethe r. The journe y of descent consists of encounter ing your shadow many, many times. Emotions as intense as shame and guilt give themse lves up only a bit at a time— and you wouldn’ t want more. Be patient with yourself, and no matter how little you think you’ve rele ased, sa y to y ourself, “That’ s all th e ener gy tha t was willing to be l et go righ t now .” You don’ t have to wai t for full- blown erupt ions from the shadow . Set aside a little time for a “shadow meditation, ” in which you give yourself perm ission to feel whatev er wants to come up. Then you can begin the process of asking it to release. Exercise #2: W riting as a T rigger Another useful trigg er for getting at shadow ener gies is auto matic writing : Take a piec e of paper , and start writing the sentenc e “I am real ly feel ing  right now .” Fill in the blank with any feel ing that comes up— preferabl y a negat ive feeling that you had to keep to yourself that day— and keep writing. Don ’t stop— writ e as"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"fast as y ou can, put ting down an y words that want to strea m out of y ou. Other sentenc es that you can use to begin this exer cise m ight be: “What I should have said was  .” “I can’ t wait to tell someone tha t I  .” “Nobod y can stop m e from saying the truth about  .” “Nobod y wants to hear m e say this, but  .” Through these triggers, you are giving yourself permission to express yourself, but the more import ant aim is to get at a forbidden feel ing. That ’s why the words don ’t matter. Once you access the feeling, the real work of release can begin. You need to go on and feel it com pletely, ask for release, and keep going until you get a new bit of self- understanding. It may take prac tice before any real deep rele ase comes to you, but step by step the walls of resistanc e will com e down. The shadow is subtl y invo lved in ever yday life. It is never so hidden that you cannot bring it to light. Secret #9 YO U LIVE IN MUL TIDIMEN SION S LAST WE EK I MET TWO PEO PLE who could start a spiritual feud if they weren’ t so gentl e. The first was a woman with a conscien ce. Having reali zed a fortune in the clothing business, she knew that much of the finer y we put on our backs is made under sicken ing conditions in the Third World, where children work sixteen-hour days for pennies. Having seen these condi tions firsthand, the wom an bec ame a dedic ated activ ist. “We have to wipe out slave labo r,” she told me with passion in her voic e. “I can’ t understand why ever yone isn’ t outraged by what’s going on.” I could tell that she really wanted to know why I wasn’t outr aged. Her eyes, with the intense, feverish gaze, were fixed on me. “You of all people, ” they said. Not that I needed remind ing. When you live a life publi cly associa ted with spiritua lity, people want to know why their brand of spiritua lity isn’ t the one you embrac e. In this case, the woman with a conscien ce though t that the highest form of spiritua lity was human itar ianis m; to her way of think ing you aren’ t real ly spiritua l unles s you help the poor and fight injustic e and inequ ality. A few days later, I met her oppo site in a man who earns his living perfor ming healing at a distanc e. He was born in South Amer ica and found out, through mysterious exper iences as a child, that he could see into the subtle world of auras and ener gy fields. For a long time nothing came of this gift; he was in the impor t-export business until he was over fort y. Then one day he fell ill and found himse lf going to a heal er who cured him without laying on hands—si mpl y by moving his ener gy psychically. From that moment on, the man beca me passiona te about doing the sam e kind of work. And he, too, wanted to kno w why I wasn’ t following his version of s piritua lity. “Changes are about to happen on the astral plane,” he said in a low , reserved tone. “Scienc e has been in power on the material plane, but there ’s going to be a turnaround in 2012—I ’ve been told this by my spiri t guides. From that year on, scien ce will decl ine, destro yed by its own excesses. Then spirit will return to th e plane t.” Instead of a passiona te human itar ianis m, this man advocated deta chm ent and withdrawing from the material world. Like the first woman, he couldn’ t understand wh y I didn’ t catch on—i t was obvious to him that trying to"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"change the world b y confront ing it wa s hopel ess. Strangel y enough, I agreed with both of them. What they represen ted was a secre t: Each of us lives in multidimensions. We can choose where to focu s our attent ion, and wherever that focus goes, a new real ity opens up. Even though they disagreed with each other , both of these people were trying to solve the same proble m, which is how to be spiritu al despite the demands of material ism . And the answers they found are both viable, without either one being the answer . When I speak of other dim ensions, I’m referring to dom ains of consciousness. Consciousness is the maker of reali ty—w e’ve been talk ing about that for some time here—but maker really means “chooser .” The one real ity alread y pos sesses ever y possible dimension; no one needs to make new ones, or could if they wanted to. But through our attention we bring these dim ensions to life: We populate them, add new meaning, and pain t unique pictures. Let me name these do mains first. THE IN VISIBLE DOM AINS How Awareness Unfolds fr om the Source Pur e being: The domain of the Absolute, pure awareness before it acquires any quali ties at all. The stat e before creat ion. This is not actua lly a separate dom ain since it perm eates ever ything. Conditioned bliss: The dom ain of awareness as it begins to beco me conscious of its own poten tial. Love: The mo tivating force in creation. Kno wingness: The dom ain of inner int elligence. Myt h and archet ypes: The colle ctiv e patterns of socie ty. This is the domain of gods and goddesse s, heroes and heroines, m ale and fem ale ener gy. Intuition: The dom ain where the m ind understands the subtle m echani cs of life. Imagination: The do main of crea tive invent ion. Rea son: The dom ain of logic, science, and ma thematics. Emotion: The do main of fee lings. Physical bod y: The do main of sensation and the five senses. Which of these real ms is trul y spiritua l? The y all inter connec t, yet you can observe quite often that people camp out in one real m or another , and having found their speci al place, the y also find spirit th ere. The wom an with a consci ence found her place in emotions and the physical bod y— it was the physical struggle of day-to-da y povert y that moved her heart. But, of course, one can’ t exclud e love from her set of motives; perhaps she also intu itiv ely knew that this kind of hum anitarian work was the path of grea test growth for herself. The man who hea led fro m a distanc e found his plac e in the real m of intu ition. This is where the subtle ener gies play. His brand of spiri tual ity called for manipu lating the invisible forces that hold the physical world togethe r. One can’ t exc lude love from his set of motives, and there’ s also the realm of myth and arch etype to be considered since he ca lled on angels and spiri t guides to do his w ork. A skepti c might argue that these real ms sim ply don’ t exist. That ’s a hard argumen t to settle because if something doesn ’t exist for you, it might as well not exist. This might be the moment to look at a simp le exa mpl e."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":" A car is found run into a snowbank after a winter storm . The driver is unconscious at the wheel. People stop to see what ’s wrong, and they ask each other , “How did this happen?” One points to the tire tracks in the snow: “The car veered off course—that ’s how this happened. ” Another observer points to the steer ing whee l, which is wrench ed to one side: “The car’s steering mechan ism was fault y—that’s how this happened.” A third observer smells the driver ’s brea th: “He was drunk—that ’s how this happen ed.” Finall y, a neurolog ist happens to stop by with a portab le MRI machine, and he points to the drive r’s brain scan: “His motor cortex exhibi ts abnor malities —that ’s ho w th is happened.” Ever y answer depends ent irel y upon the kind of evid ence used. The same question was asked at dif feren t levels of reali ty, and at each leve l only one kind of answer made sense. The neurologist isn’ t the enem y of the car mechan ic; he ju st th inks that his o wn answer is deeper and ther efore m ore true. When people argue that there is no scient ific proof that the universe is conscious, my immediate response is, “I am conscious, and am I not an activit y of the universe?” The brain, which opera tes on electro magnet ic impulses, is as much an activ ity of the universe as are the electro magneti c storms in the atmosphere or on a distant star . Therefor e, science is one form of elec tromagn etis m that spends its time stud ying another form. I like the remark that a physicist once made to me: “Science should never be con sidered the ene my of spiritual ity because science is its greatest ally. Scienc e is God expl aining God through a hum an nervous system. Isn’ t spiritua lity the sa me thing?” A philosopher might argue that real ity isn’ t trul y known unti l you includ e all layers of interpre tation. In that sense, the theor y of one real ity doe sn’t fight aga inst materia lism —it expands it. The driver who ran into the snowbank could have had many levels of motiva tion: Ma ybe he was depressed and drove off the road on purpo se (em otions). Ma ybe he was thinking about a poe m he wanted to write and his attention wandered (im agination). Ma ybe he saw in his mind’s eye that an oncom ing car was about to swerve into his lane (intui tion). To get to a new level of explana tion, you have to transc end the level you are on, to go beyond it. If you can acknowledge that going beyond is something you do ever y day, there is no grea t reason to use materialism as a club to beat spiritua lity over the head. The materia l world can be your base leve l of exper ience or not. The other levels are avai labl e by transcend ing, or going beyond your base leve l, as you are doing this second when your brain turns che mistry into thoughts. So the real question is what dom ain you wish to live in. To me, the ideal life is lived on all levels of consciousness. Your atten tion is not bounded or narrow; you open yourself to the whole of awareness. You have an opportuni ty to lead such a life, but by focusing on one or two leve ls only, you’ve caused the others to atroph y. The y have been squeezed out of your awareness, and thus your ability to transcend is much dim inished. (On the most mund ane level it’s often a matter of finding the time. I rarel y meet scient ists who have given consciousness a second thought—the y are too wrapped up in lab work. Like the rest of us, their plates are full, and if the world could have a profoundl y different basis from what they learned as a pre-m ed or in quantu m physics, the typical scient ist will look into it tom orrow .) Each dim ension of your existen ce has its own purpose, offering a level of fulfill ment that is not avai labl e anywher e else (these are the “flavors of creation”). In compl etely expanded awareness, ever y dimension is accessibl e.

How did all these leve ls com e about ? As a fact of existen ce: Pure being conc eived them, project ed them from itself, and then enter ed them. This is the cos mic circui t board, and your own nervous system is wired into it. By paying attent ion to any dim ension of life, you send a current of consciousnes s into it. If you pay no attention, the circu it is closed for that dimension. Although we are using word s like doors, circuitry, and levels, they fall short of reali ty, which vibrates with ever y impulse. You are having an effect in ever y dimension, even when you haven’ t sent your atten tion to explore and understand what’ s there. Som eone who has full y explored a dim ension is said in Sanskrit to have attain ed Vidya, a word that liter ally means “knowledge” but implies much more— mas tery over a set of natural laws.

The minute you step inside you take in ever ything at a glance, but it requir es training to master ever y detail. In the end you emer ge as a changed person, with com pletely altered perc eptions.

Phy sical bod y: When this door is closed, life is all mental. The person feels that his or her bod y is inert, a dead weight to drag around. The bod y exists as a necessar y life support system, noth ing more. There is no “juice ” to moving and acting in the world. As you can see, there is no single state of Avidya but many. Tradi tional ly in India, the distinc tion wasn’t so subtle and people were typed as either being in ignoran ce or being enligh tened. Unless you were in unit y, so the thinking went, you were in utter ignor ance. (The rough equivalen t in the West would be that you were either lost or redee med.) Thus, the number of those in Vidya was minuscul e, while the num bers in Avidya were enorm ous. But trad ition overlook ed the mechan ics of awareness. We are multid imension al crea tures, and ther efore a person can attain Vidya in one area but not anothe r. Picasso was a superb artist (imag inat ion) but a terr ible husband (love); Mozar t a divine creator of music (imag inat ion and love) but weak physically; Linco ln a master of m yth and arche type but devastat ed emotion ally. In y our own life these same imbalanc es occu r. As long as we are working to mov e fro m Avidya to Vidya, we are lead ing a spiri tual life. CHAN GING YO UR REALITY TO ACCO MMO DA TE THE NINT H SECRET The reason Christ, Buddha, Socrates, or any other spiri tual teacher speaks to us personal ly is that limited consciousness does give way to sudden, clear glimpses of a real ity beyond. Your mind wants to transcend. Narro w attention is like a single light that shines on only one object. It exclud es ever ything outside its bea m; the equiv alen t in the mind is rejection. But what if you renounc ed the entire process of rejection? If you did so, you would find yourself paying attention to ever ything equa lly. Rejection is a habit. Without it, you can partic ipat e in l ife as it comes to you. Take each dom ain of awareness and write down how you keep yourself from enter ing it. In this way you beco me aware of what you are doing to limit your consciousness, and by catching yourse lf in time, each of these ingra ined ref lexes can begin to change.

Because all we can see of death is that once you die you aren’ t here anymore, this crea tes deep fear . There has never been a time when peop le weren’ t desperate to know w hat lies “on the oth er side of lif e.” But what if there is no “other side”? Perhaps death is only rela tive, not a total change. After all, each of us is dying ever y day, and the moment known as death is reall y just an extension of this proces s. St. Paul spoke of dying unto dea th, by which he meant hav ing such strong faith in the afterl ife and the salvat ion prom ised by Christ that death lost its power to generat e fear. Yet dying unto death is also a natura l process that has been going on in cells for bill ions of years. Life is intimately entwin ed with death, as you can observe ever y time a skin cell is sloughed off. This process of exfoli ation is the sam e as a tree dropping its leav es (the Latin word for “leaf ” is folio ), and biologists tend to think of death as a me ans for lif e to regenerat e. This view brings little com fort, however , when you face being the leaf falling off the tree to make roo m for next spring’ s growth. Rath er than discus sing death in impersona l terms, I’d like to focus on your death, the supposed end of the you who is alive at this moment and wants to rem ain so. The personal prospect of death is the issue no one likes to confron t, yet if I can sho w you what the real ity of your death is, all this aversion and fear can be conquered, after which you can pa y mor e at tent ion to both life and death. Onl y by facing death can you deve lop real passion for being alive. Passion isn’ t frantic ; it isn’t driven by fear . Yet right now , at an unconscious level, mos t people feel they are snatching life from the jaw s of dea th, frant ic with the kno wledg e that their time on earth is so brief. When you see yourse lf as part of eterni ty, however , this fearful snatching of crumbs from the table vanishes, and in its place you receive the abundan ce of life that we hear so mu ch talk abou t but tha t so few people seem to posses s. Here’ s a sim ple question : When you are a grandparent, you will no longer be a bab y, a teenage r, or a young adult. So when it comes time to go to heaven, which of these peop le is going to sho w up? Most people look tota lly baffled when they’re asked this question. It’s not a frivolous one. The person you are toda y isn’ t the"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"sam e person you were when you were ten years old. Certain ly your bod y has changed com pletely from that of the ten- year-old. None of the molecules in your cells is the sam e, and neither is your mind. You certa inly don ’t think l ike a child. In essenc e, the ten-y ear-old you once were is dead. From a ten- year-old’ s perspectiv e, the two-y ear-old you once were is also dead. The reason tha t life see ms continuous is tha t you have memories and desires tha t tie you to the past, but these too are ever shifting. Just as your bod y comes and goes, so does the mind with its fleet ing thoughts and emotions. When you are aware of being yourself without being attach ed to any part icul ar age, you’ve found the mysterious observer within who doesn ’t com e and go. Onl y witnessing awaren ess qualif ies as that observer— it rem ains the same while ever ything else changes. The witness or observer of experien ce is the self to whom all experienc es are happen ing. It would be futile to hold on to who you are at this moment in terms of bod y and mind. (People are baffled by which self they are going to take to heav en because either they imagine an ideal self going there or a self they have attach ed to their imaginations. At som e level we all know that there was never an age that felt idea l, howeve r.) Life needs to be fresh. It needs to renew itself. If you could bea t death and remain just who you are—or who you were at the time of life you consider th e best— you’d succeed onl y in mu mmifying yourself. You are dying at every moment so that you can ke ep creating yourself. We have alre ady establ ished that you are not in the world ; the world is in you. This, the main tenet of the one reali ty, also means tha t you are not in your bod y; your bod y is in you. You are not in your mind; your mind is in you. There is no place in the brain where a person can be found. Your brain consum es not one molecu le of glucose to maintain your sense of self, despite the millions of synaptic bursts that sustain all the things that self is doing in th e world. So when we say that the soul leaves a person’ s bod y at the moment of death, it would be more corre ct to say that the bod y leaves the soul. The bod y is alre ady coming and going; now it leaves without com ing back. The soul can’ t leave bec ause it has nowhere to go. This radi cal propo sition needs a bit of discussion bec ause, if you aren’ t going anywher e when you die, you must be ther e alre ady. This is one of those paradoxes from quantu m physics w hose understand ing depends upon knowing where th ings com e from in the first pla ce. Som etimes I ask people a simple question such as, “What did you eat for dinner last night?” When they say “chick en salad” or “steak,” I then ask, “Where was that memory before I asked you?” As we’ve alre ady seen, there’ s no picture of a chick en salad or a steak imprinted in your brain—nor any taste or smell of food. When you bring a memory to mind, you are actua lizing an even t. Synaptic firings produce the memor y, replet e with visuals, taste, and smel l if you want them. Before you actu alize it, a memory is not local, meaning it has no locat ion; it is part of a field of potent ial, or ener gy, or intelligenc e. Tha t is, you have the potent ial for memory, which is infin itely vaster than a single memory but nowhere in sight. This field extends invisibl y in all direct ions; the hidden dimensions we’ve been discus sing can all be expl ained as different fields embedd ed in one infin ite field, which is being i tself. You are the field. We all make a mistak e when we identif y with the events that com e and go in the field. These are isola ted moments— sing le blips as the field momentaril y gets actu aliz ed. The underl ying real ity is pure poten tial, which is also called the soul. I know how abstra ct this sounds, and so did the anc ient sages of India. Looking at creat ion, which is fi lled with objects of the senses, the y cam e up with a speci al ter m, Akasha, to fit the soul. The word Akasha litera lly means “space,” but the larger conc ept is of soul space, the field of awaren ess. When you die, you don’ t go anywhere because you are alre ady in the dimension of Akasha, which is ever ywher e. (In quantu m physics, the tiniest subato mic partic le is ever ywher e in space time before it gets locali zed as a partic le. Its nonlocal existen ce is ju st as real but invisibl e.) Imagine a house with four wal ls and a roof. If the hou se burn s down, the walls and roof col lapse. But the space inside isn’ t affected. You can hire an arch itec t to design a new house, and after you build it, the space inside still hasn ’t been affected. By building a hou se you are only dividing unbounded spac e into inside and outside. This"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"division is an illusion. The ancient sages said that your bod y is like that house. It’s built at birth and burns down when you die, y et the Aka sha, or s oul spac e, re mains unchanged ; it rem ains unbounded. According to these ancient sages, the cause of all suffering, according to the first klesha, is not knowing who you are. If y ou are the unbounded field, then death is not at all what we’ve feared. The pu rpose of death is to imagine yourself into a new form with a new loca tion in space and time. In other words, you imagin e yourself into this particul ar lifetime, and after dea th you will dip back into the unkno wn to imagine your next form . I don’ t consider this a mystical conclusion (in part because I’ve had discus sions with physicists who support this pos sibi lity, given all they know about the nonlocal ity of ener gy and parti cles), but it’s not my intention to convert you to a belief in reinc arnation. We’re just following one reali ty to its hidden source. Right now you are bringing up new thoughts by actual izing your potent ial; it seems only reasonabl e tha t the sam e process produced who y ou are now. I own a TV set with a remote control, and when I push a button I can chang e from CNN to MTV to PBS. Until I pres s the remot e, those progra ms don ’t exist on the screen; it’s as if the y don’ t exist at al l. Yet I know that each program , com plete and inta ct, is in the air as elec tromagn etic vibr ations waiting to be select ed. In the same wa y, you exist in Akasha before y our bod y and mind pick up the signal and express it in the three- dim ensiona l world. Your soul is like the multiple channels avai labl e on TV; your karma (or actions) picks the progra m. Without believ ing in either one, you still can apprec iate the aston ishing transition from a potent ial hanging around in spac e—as TV programs do—to a full-blown even t in the three- dim ensiona l world. What, then, will it be like when you die? It might be like changing chann els. Imag inat ion will continue to do what it has alwa ys been doing—popping new images up on the screen. Some tradit ions believe that there’ s a com plex process of reliv ing karma when you die so that a person can learn what this life time was about and prepare to make a new soul bargain for the next lifet ime. The moment of dea th is describ ed as having your life flash before you, not at lightn ing speed as experien ced by peop le when they’re drowning, but slowly and with full understand ing of ever y choice one has m ade since bir th. If you are condi tioned to think in terms of heaven and hell, going to one or the other will be your experienc e. (Rem ember that the Christian concept ion of these places isn’ t the sam e as the Isla mic version or the thousands of Lokas in Tibetan Buddhism, which makes room for a multitud e of worlds after death.) The creat ive machin ery of consciousness will produce the experien ce of that other place, while to som eone who has led the sam e life under no such beli ef system, these images might appear to be a blissful dream or a reliving of colle ctiv e fantasi es (like a fair y tale), or the unspooling of the mes from childhood. But if you go to another world after death, that world will be in you as much as this one is. Does that mean heaven and hell are not real? Look out the windo w at a tree. It has no reality except as a specifi c spacet ime event being actuali zed out of the infinite potentia l of the field. Therefore, it’s only fair to say that heaven and hell are ju st as real as tha t tre e—and ju st as unreal. The ab solute break betwe en life and dea th is an il lusion. What bothers people abou t losing the bod y is that it seems like a terrib le break or interrup tion. This interrup tion is imagined as going into the void; it is total personal extinct ion. Yet that perspec tive, which arouses huge fears, is limited to the ego. The ego craves cont inuit y; it wants toda y to feel like an extension of yesterda y. Without that thre ad to cling to, the journe y day to day would feel disconnec ted, or so the ego fears. But how trau matized are you by having a new image com e to mind, or a new desire? You dip into the field of infini te possibil ities for any new thought, returning with a specifi c imag e out of the trillions that could pos sibl y exist. At that moment, you aren’ t the person you were a second ago. So, you are clinging to an illusion of continu ity. Give it up this moment and you will fulfil l St. Paul ’s dictu m to die unto dea th. You will real ize that you have been discontinuous all along, constant ly changing, constant ly dipping into the ocean of possibi lities to bring forth an ything new . Death can be viewed as a total illusion because you are dead alread y. When you think of who you are in terms"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"of I, me, and mine, you are referring to your past, a time that is dead and gone. Its memories are reli cs of a time passed by. The ego keeps itself intact by repea ting what it alread y knows. Yet life is actual ly unknown, as it has to be if you are ever to conce ive of new thoughts, desires, and experi ences. By choosing to repeat the past, you are keep ing lif e fro m renewing itself. Do you remember the first time you tasted ice crea m? If not, look at a very young child encounter ing an ice crea m cone. The look on the child’ s face te lls y ou tha t she is lost in pure deligh t. But the second ic e crea m cone, although a child may beg and plead for it, is sligh tly less wonderful than the first. Each repe tition pales by degrees because, when you return to what you alre ady know , it can’ t be exper ienced for the first time. Toda y, as much as you may like ice crea m, the exper ience of eating it has becom e a habit. The sensation of taste hasn’t changed, but you have. The bargain you made with your ego, to keep I, me, and mine going on the same habitua l tra cks, wa s a bad bar gain— you have chosen the oppo site of l ife, which is death. Technica lly speaking, even the tree outside your window is an image from the past. The instant you see it and process it in your brain, the tree has alread y mov ed on at the quantu m lev el, flowing with the vibrating fabric of the universe. To be full y alive you have to injec t yourself into the nonlocal dom ain where new experien ces are born. If you drop the pretense of being in the world, you will reali ze that you’ve alwa ys lived from the discontinuous, nonloca l place called the soul. When you die you will enter the sam e unknown, and in that moment you will have a good chan ce of fee ling that you were never m ore alive. Wh y wait? You can be as alive as you want to be through a process kno wn as surrender . This is the next step in conquering death. So far in this chapt er the line between life and death has beco me so blurr y that it has almost disappeared. Surrender is the act of erasing the line entir ely. When you can see yourself as the total cycle of death within life and life with in death, you have surrendered— the mystic’s most powerful tool against materialism . At the threshold of the one real ity, the mystic gives up all need for boundaries and plunges directl y into ex istence. The circ le closes, and the mystic exper ienc es him self as the one rea lity.

If all these steps of surrender are present, then a great Rembrandt or Monet will evoke love because the artist is sim ply there in all his naked hu mani ty. In the presenc e of such hum anity, surrender isn’t difficul t. People themselv es are more difficul t. Yet surrender ing to someon e else follows the sa me steps we j ust listed. Perhaps the next time you sit down to dinner with your family you might dec ide to concentr ate on just one step of surrender , such as paying full attention or being nonjudgm enta l. Pick the step that see ms easiest to approach or, bett er yet, the one that you kno w you’ve been leaving out. Mo st of us have left out hum ility when we relat e to our families. What does it mean to be humb le with a child, for exa mpl e? It means regarding the child’s opinion as equal to your own. At the leve l of awareness, it is equa l; your advan tage of years as the parent at the table doesn’ t discoun t that fact. We all had to be children, and what we thought back then had all the weight and importan ce of life at any age, perhaps more so. The secre t of surrender is that you do it inside, without trying to please anyone else. As much as it disturbs us, even tual ly we all find ourselves in the presenc e of som eone who is very old, frail, and dying. The same steps of surrender are possibl e in that situat ion. If you follow them, the beaut y of a dying person is just as eviden t as the beaut y of a Rem brandt. Death inspir es a cert ain wonder that can be reached when you go beyond the knee- jerk react ion of fear. I recen tly felt this sense of wonder when I came across a phenom enon in biolog y that helps support the whole notion that dea th is compl etely wedded to life. It turns out that our bodies have found th e ke y to surrender alread y. The pheno menon is called apoptosis. This strange word, which was com pletel y new to me, takes one on a deepl y mystical journe y; and having returned, I find my perc eptions of life and death have changed. Punching apoptosis into an Intern et search engine gave me 357,000 entries, and the very first defined the word in bibl ical terms: “For ever y cell there is a time to liv e and a time to die. ” Apoptosis is program med cell dea th, and although we don’ t realize it, each of us has been dying ever y day, right on schedul e, in order to remain alive. Cells die because they want to. The cell carefu lly reverses the birth process: It shrinks, it destro ys its basic prote ins, and then it goes on to dism antl e its own DN A. Bubbles appe ar on the surface membran e as the cell opens its porta ls to the outside world and expe ls ever y vital che mical, to final ly be swallowed up by the bod y’s white cells exa ctly as they would devour an invading microbe. When the process is com plete, the cel l has dissolved and leaves no tra ce behind. When you read this graphi c account of a cell sacrif icing itse lf so methodi cally, you can’ t help being touched. Yet the mystical part is still to com e. Apoptosis isn’ t a way to get rid of sick or old cells, as you might suppose. The process gave us birth. As embryos in the womb, each of us passed through primitive stages of develop men t when we had tadpol e tails, fishlike gills, webbing between our fingers, and most surprisingl y, too many brain cells. Apoptosis took care of these unwanted vestig es—in the case of the brain, a newborn bab y forms proper neural connec tions by remov ing the excess brain tissue that we were all born with. (It came as a surprise when neurologists discover ed that our brains cont ain the most cells at birth, a num ber which gets whittled down by the millions so that higher intelligenc e can forge its deli cate web of conne ctions. It was long thought that killing off brain ce lls was a patholog ical process as soci ated with aging. Now the whole issue mus t be reconsid ered.) Apoptosis doesn’ t end in the wom b, howeve r. Our bodies continue to thrive on death. The immune cells that engulf and consum e invad ing bact eria would turn on the bod y’s own tissues if they didn’ t induce dea th in each other and then turn on themse lves with the same poison s used against invaders. Whenev er any cell dete cts that its DNA is dam aged or defect ive, it know s that the bod y will suffer if this defect is passed on. Fortunate ly, ever y cell carr ies a poison gene known as p53 that can be ac tivat ed to ma ke i tself die. These few facts bare ly scratch the surface. Anato mists long ago knew that skin cells die ever y few days; that retina l cells, red blood cells, and stom ach cells also are progra mmed with spec ific short life spans so that their tissues can be quickly repl enished. Each dies for its own unique reason. Skin cells have to be sloughed off so that our skin rem ains supple, while stomach cells die as part of the potent chem ical com bustion that digests food."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":" Death canno t be our ene my if we have depend ed upon it from the wom b. Con sider the following iron y. As it turns out, the bod y is capab le of taking a vacat ion from dea th by producing cells that decid e to live forever . These cells don’ t trigger p53 when they dete ct defec ts in their own DNA. And by refusing to issue their own death warrants, these cells divid e relen tlessl y and invasivel y. Cancer , the most feared of diseases, is the bod y’s vacat ion from death, while progra mmed death is its ticket to life. This is the paradox of life and dea th confronted head on. The m ystical notion of d ying ever y day turns out to be the bod y’s m ost concrete fact. What this means is that we are exquisite ly sensit ive to the balanc e of positiv e and nega tive forces, and when the balance is tipped, death is the natura l response. Nietzsch e once rem arked that hum ans are the only crea tures who mus t be encouraged to stay alive. He couldn’ t have known that this is literall y true. Cells receive posit ive signals that tell the m to sta y alive— che micals called growth factors. If these positive signals are withdrawn, the cell loses its will to live. Lik e the Mafia’ s kiss of dea th, the cell can also be sent messeng ers that bind to its outer receptors to signa l that death has arrived—th ese che mical messengers are actua lly known as “dea th activ ators.” Months after writing this paragraph I met a Harvard Medic al School profes sor who had discovered an amazing fact. Ther e is a substance that causes cancer cells to activat e new blood vessels so that they can get food. Medical resear ch has focused on finding out how to block this unknown substance so that malign ant growths can be deprived of nutr ients and thus killed. The professor discovered that the exac t opposite substance causes toxe mia in pregnant women, a potent ially fata l disorder in which the blood vessels are “unhapp y” that they are under going norm al progra mmed cell dea th. “You realize what this means?” he said with deep awe. “The bod y can trigg er che micals in a ba lancing act between l ife and death, and yet scien ce has tot ally ignored who is doing the balanc ing. Doesn’ t the whole secret of health lie in that part of ourselves, not in the che micals being used ?” The fact that consciousness could be the missing ingredien t, the X factor behind the scenes, came to him as a revela tion. The mystics have pree mpted scienc e here because one reads in many mystical trad itions that ever y person dies at exact ly the right time and kno ws in advanc e when that time is. But I would like to exa mine more deepl y the concept of dying ever y day. To die ever y day is a choi ce ever yone overlooks. I want to see myself as the same person from day to day in order to preserve my sense of iden tity. I want to see myself as inhabi ting the sam e bod y ever y day because it is disturbing to think that m y bod y is constantl y deserting me . Yet it mus t, if I am not to be a living mummy. Following the complex timetab le of apop tosis, I am given a new bod y via the mech anism of dea th. This process happens subtl y enough that it passes without notice. No one sees a two-y ear-old turn ing in her bod y for a new one at age thre e. Ever y day she has the same bod y, and yet she doesn ’t. Onl y the constant process of renewal— a gift of dea th—enabl es her to keep pace with each stage of develop ment. The wonder is that one feels l ike the sam e person in the m idst of such endless shape-shifting. Unlike with cell death, I can observe my ideas being born and dying. To support the passage from child ish thought to adult thought, the mind has to die ever y day. My cherished ideas die and never reappear; my most intense experienc es are consu med by their own passions; my answer to the quest ion “W ho am I?” totally changes fro m age two to thre e, thre e to four , and s o on throughou t lif e. We understand death when we drop the illusion that life must be continuous. All of nature obe ys one rhythm— the universe is dying at the speed of light yet it still manages along the way to create this plane t and the life forms inhab iting it. Our bodies are dying at many different speeds at once, beginn ing with the photon, ascending through che mical dissolution, cell death, tissue regenera tion, and finall y the death of the whole organism . What are we so afraid of? Apoptosis rescues us from fea r, I think. The death of a single cell makes no differenc e to th e bod y. What counts is not the act but the plan—an overar ching design that brings the balan ce of posit ive and negativ e signals that ever y cell responds to. The plan is beyond time because it dates to the very construction of time. The plan is beyond space bec ause it is ever ywhere in the bod y and yet nowhere— ever y cell as it dies takes the plan with it, and y et the plan surviv es. In the one reali ty, you don’ t settl e an argumen t by pick ing sides—both sides of any argumen t are equall y true."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"So I have no trouble conced ing that what happens after dea th is invisib le to the eye and cannot be proved as a material even t. I conced e without question that we norm ally don ’t remember our past lives and can live very well withou t that knowledge.

The case against life after death looks strong only if you ignore ever ything discovered about cells, photons, molecu les, thoughts, and the whole bod y. Ever y level of existenc e is born and dies on its own timetabl e, fro m less than a million th of a second to the probable reb irth of a new universe billions of years fro m now . The hope that lies beyond death com es from the pro mise of renewal. If you passiona tely identif y with life itself instead of with the passing parad e of forms and pheno mena, dea th takes its rightfu l plac e as the agent of renewal. In one of his poe ms, Tagore asks him self, “What will you give / When death knocks at your door?” His answer displa ys the untroubl ed jo y of so meone who has risen above the fear surrounding dea th: The fulln ess of my life— The sweet wine of autumn days and su mmer nights, My little hoard glean ed through the years, And hour s rich with living. That will be my gif t When death knocks at my door . CHAN GING YO UR REALITY TO ACCO MMO DA TE THE TENTH SECRET The tenth secret says that life and death are naturall y compatib le. You can make this secret personal by shedd ing the image of yourse lf that belongs to the past—a kind of exfoli ation of your self- image. The exerc ise is very simple : Sit with your eyes closed and see yourself as an infant. Use the best bab y picture you can rem ember, or if you don ’t recal l such an i mage, create one. Make sure the bab y is awake and alert. Catch its atten tion and ask it to look into your eyes. When you’ve made contac t, just gaze for a moment until you both feel settl ed and conne cted to each other . Now invi te the bab y to join you and slowl y watch the imag e fade into the center of your chest. You can visual ize a field of light that absorb s the imag e if y ou want, or j ust a war m feeling in y our heart. Now see yourself as a toddle r. Again, make contact and once you have, ask that version of you to join you. Proceed in this way through any past self you wish to bring to mind—if you have part icular ly vivid memories of a cert ain age, linger there, but ult imately you want to see ever y image fade and disappear . Continue up to your present age, and then go on to see yourself in stages older than you are now . End up with two final images: one of you as a very old person but in good hea lth, and one of you on your deathb ed. In each case m ake conta ct, and then le t the image be absorbed in to y ou. When the image of yourself dying is gone, sit quiet ly and feel what rem ains. No one can actua lly imag ine his or her own dea th because, even if you go to the extent—which may be too gruesom e for many people—of seeing yourse lf as a corpse being lowered into the grave and deco mposing to its elemen ts, the witn ess will rem ain. Visualiz ing yourse lf as a corpse is an ancien t Tantr ic exercise fro m India, and I have led group s through it. Alm ost ever yone gets the point, which has nothing to do with gruesom eness: When you see ever y earthly vestige of yourself vanish, you real ize you will never succeed in extingu ishing yourself. The presence of the witness, w ho is the ulti mate survivor , points the wa y beyond the dance of life and death. Exercise #2: Dying Consciously"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":" Like ever y exper ience, dying is som ething you crea te as much as something that is happening to you. In many Eastern cultures, there is a practic e called “conscious death, ” in which the person part icipa tes activel y in shap ing the dying process. Using prayer, ritu als, meditation, and assistance from the living, the dying person shifts the bal ance from “this experienc e is happen ing to m e” to “I am cre ating this experi ence.” In the West, we don’ t have a tradi tion of conscious death. In fact, we leave dying people alon e in impersonal hospitals where the routine is cold, frightening, and dehu man izing. There is much to change on that front. What you can do personall y at this momen t is to bring your awaren ess to the dying process, ridding it of excessive fear and anxiet y. Think of som eone close to you who is elderly and close to dying. See yourself in the roo m with the person— you can imagine the roo m if you don ’t have actu al knowledge of where the person is. Put yourse lf inside the mind and bod y of the person. See yourse lf in detai l; feel the bed, see the light coming in through the window , and surround y ourself with the faces of fa mily and attend ing doctors and nur ses, if there are an y. Now begin to assist th e person in the shift from passive ly facing death to act ivel y cre ating the exper ience. Hear yourse lf talk ing in a norm al voice; there ’s no need for sole mnity. Be comfort ing and reassuring, but focus prim arily on shift ing the person’ s awaren ess from “this is happen ing to me” to “I am doing this.” Here are the main the mes to talk about (I’ve put the m in the second person, as if confiding in a close friend): I think y ou’ve had a beaut iful life. Let’ s talk about the best things y ou remember. You can be proud of having turned out to be a good person. You have created a lot of love and respect. Where would y ou like to go from here? Tell m e how y ou feel abou t what’ s happen ing. Ho w would y ou chang e it if y ou could? If y ou have an y regrets, tel l me about th em. I’ll help you let go of th em. You have no mor e need for s orrow . I’ll help y ou let go of an y that y ou still fee l. You deserve to be at peace. You have run y our rac e well, and now that it’s finished, I’ll help you hom e. You won ’t believ e this, but I env y you. You are about to see what’ s behind the curt ain. Is th ere an ything y ou want for y our journe y? You can, of cour se, bring the sam e themes to the bedside of someone who is trul y dying. But having an imaginar y conversa tion is a good way to reach down into yourse lf. The proces s shouldn’ t be a once-over - light ly. Each topi c could last an hour . To be really engaged, you’ll need to feel that you are giving yourself ample attent ion. This exer cise should bring up very mixed feel ings, since we all harbor fear and sorrow at the prospec t of dea th. If you have someon e in your life who died before you were able to bid them a compl ete farewell, imagine talking to the person abou t the themes I just listed. The dom ain where life and death merge is alwa ys here with us, and by paying at tent ion to i t you connec t yourself to a precious aspec t of awareness. D ying in full awareness is com pletely natura l if y ou have lived in full awareness."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Secret #11 THE U NIVERSE THIN KS THR OUG H YOU IRECENTL Y HAD A SMALL ENC OUNTER with destin y—so small that I could have ignored it entirel y. A man came to visit me who had devo ted his entire life to spiritu ality. He told me abou t his many visits to India and his devotion to its ways. He wore amul ets of the kind you can buy at temples and holy sites; he knew many sacred chan ts, or Bha jans; he had been blessed by many holy men in his travels. Some had given him mantras as a gift. A mantra can be as short as a syllable or as long as a sentenc e, but it’s basical ly a sound. In what way can a sound be a gift? To som eone steeped in the Indian tradi tion, the gift isn’ t the mantra itself but the effect it’s meant to bring, such as wealth or a good marriage. Ther e are thousands of mantras and thousands of possibl e results the y bring. When I asked him what he did for a living, the man waved his hand and said, “Oh, a little healing, a little psychic stuf f. You know , mind- reading. I don ’t pay much atten tion to it.” His careless attitude intrigu ed me, and I asked if he could show me an exam ple. He shrugged. “Think of somebod y and write down a question you want to ask them.” The only person on my mind that day was my wife, who had been visi ting family in New Delhi for a whil e. I remind ed myself that I should call to ask her when she was planning to return—we hadn’ t set a fixed date since some of the family members were elderl y, and m y wife’ s sta y depended on ho w well the y were doing. I wrote this down and looked at my visitor . He closed his eyes and began to chant a long mantr a. After a minute he said, “Tuesda y. You’re thinking about y our wife, and you want to know when s he’s com ing hom e.” He had got it righ t, and after he left and I was able to phone my wife, he got the day of her return righ t, too. I congratul ated him , but he smiled and waved his hand with the same care less gesture that said, “It’ s nothing. I barel y pay attention to it.” An hour later , when I was alon e, I began to think about these psychic even ts, which are no longer a novel ty, given how the media play up paranor mal pheno mena. Specific ally, I wondered about free will and determ inism . This man said he could read minds, but my wife’ s return on Tuesda y wasn ’t on my mind. It was an event that could have fallen on any day of the week; I had even suppo sed that she might continue to sta y indefini tely if circu mstances dicta ted. The question of free will versu s deter minis m is huge, of course. In the one real ity, ever y pair of oppo sites is ulti mately an illusion. We’ve alread y blurred the division betwe en good and evil and life and death. Is free will going to turn out to be the sa me as deter minism? A lot seem s to ride on the answer . FREE WILL = Independenc e Self-deter mination Choice Control over events Future is open DETERMINI SM = Dependence on an outside will Self deter mined by fate"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":" No con trol over events Choices m ade for y ou Future is closed These phrases sketch in the common understand ing of what’ s at stake. Ever ything in the free-will colu mn sounds attra ctive. We all want to be indep endent ; we want to make our own decisions; we want to wake up with hope that the future is open and full of endless possibil ities. On the other hand, nothing seems attract ive in the deter mination colu mn. If your choic es have been made for you, if your self is tied to a plan writ ten before you were born, then the future cannot be open. Emotional ly at least, the prospect of free will has alread y won the argum ent. And at a certa in level nobod y has to delve any deepe r. If you and I are marion ettes opera ted by an invisib le puppeteer— call him God, fate, or karm a—th en the strings he’s pulling are also invisib le. We have no proof that we aren’ t making free choices, exc ept for the occasion al spook y moments of the kind I began with, and mind- readers aren’ t going to chang e how we fundam entally behave. There is a reason to delve deeper , however , and it cent ers on the word Vasana. In Sanskrit, a Vasana is an unconscious cause. It’s the software of the psyche, the driving force that makes you do som ething when you think you’re doing it spontan eousl y. As such, Vasana is very disturbing. Imagin e a robot whose ever y action is driven by a software program inside. From the robot’ s point of view , it doesn ’t matter that the program exists— until som ething goes wrong. The illusion of not being a robot collapses if the software breaks down bec ause then, if the robot wants to do som ething but can’ t, we kno w the reason wh y. Vasana is determin ism that feels like free will. I’m remind ed of my friend Jean, whom I’ve known for almost twent y years. Jean considers himself very spiritua l and went so far in the earl y nineties as to walk way from his job with a new spaper in Denver to live in an ashra m in western Mas sachuse tts. But he found the atmosphere choking. “The y’re all crypto Hindu s,” he compl ained. “The y don’ t do anything but pray and chan t and meditate. ” So Jean decid ed to move on with his life. He’ s fallen in love with a couple of women but has never married. He doesn’ t like the notion of settling down and tends to move to a new state ever y four years or so. (He once told me that he counted up and discovered th at he’ s lived in fort y dif feren t houses since he was born.) One day Jean called me with a stor y. He was on a date with a wom an who had taken a sudden interest in Sufism, and while they were driving home, she told Jean that according to her Sufi teache r, ever yone has a prevail ing char acter istic. “You me an the thing that is mos t pro minen t about the m, like being extrov erted or introvert ed?” he asked. “No, not pro minen t,” she said. “Your prevail ing chara cter istic is hidden. You act on it without seeing that you’re act ing on it. ” The minute he heard this, Jean beca me exci ted. “I looked out the car windo w, and it hit me,” he said. “I sit on the fenc e. I am only comfort able if I can have both sides of a situation without com mitting to either .” All at once a great many piec es fell into place. Jean could see why he went into an ashra m but didn’ t feel like he was one of the group. He saw wh y he fell in love with wom en but alwa ys saw their faults. Much m ore cam e to light. Jean compl ains about his fam ily yet never misses a Christ mas with them. He considers himse lf an exper t on ever y sub ject he’s studi ed—there have been many—but he doesn’ t earn his living pursuing any of them. He is indeed an invet erate fenc e-sitt er. And as his date suggested, Jean had no idea that his Vasana, for that’s what we’re talk ing about, ma de him ent er into one situat ion aft er another without ever fall ing of f the fence. “Just think,” he said with obvious surprise, “the thing that ’s the m ost me is the thing I never saw .” If unconscious tenden cies kept working in the dark, they wouldn’ t be a proble m. The gene tic software in a penguin or wildeb eest guid es it to act without any knowledge that it is behaving much like ever y other penguin"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"or wildeb eest. But hum an beings, unique among all living creatures, want to break down Vasana. It’s not good enough to be a pawn who thinks he’s a king. We crave the assurance of absolu te freedo m and its result—a tota lly open future. Is this reasonabl e? Is it even possible? In his classic text, the Yoga Sutras, the sage Patanjali infor ms us that ther e are three types of Vasana. The kind that drives pleasan t behavior he calls white Vasana; the kind that drives unpleasant behavior he calls dark Vasana; the kind that mixes the two he calls mixed Vasana. I would say Jean had mixed Vasana—h e liked fence- sitting but he missed the reward of lasting love for another person, a driving aspira tion, or a shared vision that would bond him with a commun ity. He displa yed the positives and negat ives of som eone who must keep ever y option open. The goal of the spiritu al aspirant is to wear down Vasana so that clar ity can be achiev ed. In clari ty you know that you are not a puppet— you have rele ased yourself from the unconscious drives that once fooled y ou into think ing that you were act ing spontaneousl y. The secret here is tha t the state of release isn ’t free will. Free will is the opposit e of deter minis m, and in th e one reali ty, opposit es mus t ultimately mer ge into one. In the case of life versus death, we saw that they merged because both are need ed to renew the flow of experi ence. Free will and deter minis m don ’t me rge l ike tha t. The y merge onl y when a cosm ic argum ent is settled once and for all. Here is the ar gument in its si mplest form . There are two claims to ultimate reali ty. One claim com es from the physical world, where events have defini te causes and effects. The other claim comes from absolute Being, which has no cause. Onl y one claiman t can be right bec ause there ’s no such thing as two ul timate reali ties. So which is i t? If the physical world is the ultimate real ity, then you have no choi ce but to play out the game of Vasana. Ever y tendenc y has a cause in a prior tend enc y, and as soon as you wear out one, you will be crea ting ano ther to replac e it. You can’ t be a finished product. There is alwa ys something waiting to be fixed, attended to, adjusted, polished, cleaned up, or read y to fall apar t. (People who can’ t face this fact turn into perfec tionists, constan tly chasing the chimera of a flawless existenc e. Although they don’ t realize it, they are trying to defeat the law of Vasana, which dicta tes that no cause can disappear ; it can only transform itse lf into a new cause.) The physical world is also called the dom ain of karma, which has its own cosm ic side. Karma, as we kno w, means “action,” and the question to ask of action is this: Did it have a beginning? Does it ever end ? Ever y person who was ever born found him self thrown into a world of action that was alread y fully operat ional. There is no hint that a first action got things started, and no way to tell if a last action might bring ever ything to a halt. The universe is a given, and despite theories about the Big Bang, the possibil ity of other universes, or even infini te univ erses, means tha t the chain of first events cou ld extend forever . The anci ent sages didn’ t bother with telescopes because they saw , in a flash of insight, tha t the mind is ruled by cause and effect and therefore it doesn’ t have the power to look beyond karm a. The thought I have right now emerged fro m the thought I had a second ago. The thought I had a second ago emer ged from a thought I had the second before that—and on and on. Big Bang or not, my mind is a prisoner of karma because thinking is all it can do. There is one altern ative, the sages argued. Your mind can be. This is how the second claimant got into court. The ulti mate reality cou ld be Being itself. Being doesn’ t act; therefor e, it is never touch ed by karma. If Being is the ulti mate reali ty, the gam e of Vasana is over . Instead of worr ying about cause and effect, which is the origin of all tendenc ies, one can sim ply say thereisnocauseande ffect. I said that Vasana gave us a reason to delve deeper into free will. Now we can see why. The person who is content to remain a puppet is no different fro m the rebe l who scream s that he mus t rem ain free at all costs. Both are subject to karma; their opinions make no difference to the matter. But if you can ident ify with a stat e that has no Vasanas, free will and determin ism merge; they beco me mere instruc tions in the manual of karm ic software. In other word s, both are tools to be used by Being rather than end s in themselv es. Kar ma, it turns out, loses the ar gumen t about being th e ult imate rea lity. How can I say that the argum ent is settled? I could say it’s settled by authorit y bec ause the spiritual record holds count less sages and saints who test ify that Being is the ulti mate ground of existence. But since we aren’ t relying on authorit y here, the proof has to come from exper ienc e. I experi ence that I am alive, which seems to"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"help the case for karma, since being alive consists of one action after anothe r. But I canno t be alive if the whole universe isn’ t alive. This conclusion would see m absurd without building up to it. But we have co me far enough to reali ze that the real absurdit y is to be alive in a dead universe. No one before modern times felt that he or she was stranded on a speck of rock and water with nothing but a black void to look out at. I find that imag e, which underlies the superstit ion of scienc e, horrif ying and untrue. My bod y and the universe are composed of the sam e molecu les, and no matter how hard I try, I can’ t manag e to bel ieve tha t a hydrogen ato m is al ive inside me but dead the instan t it leaves my lungs. My bod y and the universe com e from the sam e source, obe y the same rhythms, flash with the sam e stor ms of elec tromagn etic activi ty. My bod y can’ t afford to argue over who creat ed the universe. Ever y cell would disappear the second it stopped creat ing itself. So it must be that the universe is living and brea thing through me. I a m an expression of ever ything in existenc e. At any given momen t, the bubbling subato mic activ ity that keeps the universe going is in flux ; ever y partic le wink s in and out of existenc e thousands of times per second. In that interval, I also wink in and out, travel ing from existence to annih ilation and back again billions of times a day. The universe came up with this lightn ing- fast rhythm so that it cou ld pau se in between and decid e what to crea te next. The sam e is true of me. Even though my mind works too slowl y to see the difference, I’m not the sam e person after I return from my bill ion journe ys into the void. Ever y single process in my cells has been rethought, reexa mined, reor gani zed. Creat ion happens b y infini tesi mal degre es, and the overall result is e ternal genesis. In a living universe, we do not have to answer any questions abou t who the creator is. At various times, relig ions have named a single god, multiple god s and goddes ses, an invisible life force, a cos mic mind, and in the curren t religion of physics, a blind game of chanc e. Choose any or all of these because what’ s far more crucia l about genesis is y ou. Can y ou see y ourself as the point around which ever ything is now revolv ing? Look around and try to view your whole situat ion. From the viewpoint of a limited self, you cannot be the center of the cosm os. But that’s because you are looking at karm a. Your atten tion is going to bits and pieces of your situa tion—a curren t relat ionship, events at work, finances, perhaps tossing in a vague concern with som e polit ical crisis or the state of the stock m arket. No m atter how m any of these ingredien ts y ou try to co mpr ehend, you aren’ t seeing your whole situa tion. Fro m the perspect ive of wholeness, the universe is think ing about you. Its thoughts are invisible, but they eventua lly manifest as tendenc ies—the by now familiar Vasanas—and sometimes your attention feels the larger design at work because ever y life has inescap able turning points, opportunit ies, epiphan ies, and break throughs. To you, a thought is an image or idea floating through your mind. To the universe—and here we mean the universal intelligence that perm eates the swar m of galaxies, black holes, and interst ellar dust—a thought is a step in evolu tion. It’s a creat ive act. To truly live at the cent er of the one real ity, evolu tion mus t beco me of prim ary interest to you. The noncriti cal events in your life alread y run themselves. Think of your bod y, which operates with two separate types of nervous system. The involuntar y nervous system is auto matic—it regulat es the ever yday funct ions of the bod y without intervent ion from you. When som eone goes into a coma, this nervous system continu es more or less nor mally, keeping heartbea t, blood pressure, hor mones, elec trol ytes, and a hundred other functions going in perfec t coordin ation. The other nervous system is called volunt ary because it relates to will, or volition. The volunt ary nervous system carri es out desires. That is its onl y purpo se, and without it, life would run exac tly as it does for som eone in a co ma, without any motion forward, frozen in a waking dea th. The universe reflec ts the same division. On one level, natural forces need no assistanc e from us to keep ever ything regula ted so that life can be sustain ed. Eco logy is self-bal ancing. Plants and animals exist in harm ony withou t knowing that they do. One cou ld imag ine a world in which noth ing expands beyond basic existenc e, where inste ad crea tures are reduced to eating, breath ing, and sleep ing. Such a world doesn’ t exist, howeve r. Even one-ce lled amoeb as swim in a particul ar direct ion, hunt for food, mov e toward light, and seek temper atures th ey prefer . Desire is buil t into the sche me of lif e. So it’s not that incred ible to look for the second half of the universe’ s nervous system, the half that revolves"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"around desire. When your brain carries out a desire, the universe is carr ying it out at the sam e time. Ther e is no difference between “I want to have a child” and “The univ erse wants to have a child.” The embr yo that star ts to grow in the womb relies on billions of years of intelligenc e, memor y, crea tivi ty, and evolution. The indiv idual seam lessl y flow s into the cos mos when we are talking about fetuses in the womb. Wh y should this merging stop ther e? The fact that you experien ce your desire as individu al doesn’ t nega te the universe from acting through y ou, just as th e fact that you consider y our chi ldren to be y ours doesn ’t negate the fac t tha t the y are also the chi ldren of a vast gene pool. That gene pool has no other parent than the universe. At this momen t, you are seamlessl y flowing with the cos mos. There is no difference between your brea thing and the breathing of the rain forest, between your bloodstr eam and the world’ s rivers, between your bones and the cha lk cliffs of Dover . Ever y shift in the ecos ystem has affected you at the level of your genes. The univ erse rem embers its evolu tion by leaving a record written in DN A. This means that your genes are the focal point for ever ything happening in the world. The y are your line of communic ation with natur e as a whole, not just with your mo ther and fathe r. Set aside what you have read about DNA as a string of sugar s and amino acids strung in a double helix. That model tells us what DNA looks like, but it says almost nothing about what is actual ly going on in the dynamics of life, just as the wiring diagra m of a television tells us noth ing about what’s playing on the screen. What ’s playing through your DN A at this moment is the evolu tion of the universe. The next desire you have will be recorded in memory, and either the universe will move forward or it won’ t. We tend to think of evolu tion as a straight- line march from prim itive organisms to higher ones. A better image would be of a bubble expanding to take in mo re and mo re of l ife’s poten tial. • As you acc ess more intelligence, you are evolv ing. On the other hand, if you constrict your mind to what you alread y know or can predic t, your evolu tion wil l slow do wn. • As you access more creativity, you are evolving.

On the other hand, if you continue to use a frac tion of your consciousness, y our evolution will slow down. The universe has a stake in which choices you decide to make, for the overwhel ming evidence is that it favor s evolut ion over standing still. In Sanskrit, the evolu tionar y force is call ed Dharma, from a root word that means “to uphold.” Withou t you, Dharm a would be confin ed to three dimensions. Even though you spend almost no time think ing about your relat ionship to a zebra, a coconut tree, or blue- green algae, each is your intimate in the evolut ionar y schem e. Hum an beings extended the evolu tionar y sche me when life reached a certain limit in physicali ty—after all, in physical terms, the earth depends on blue-green algae and plankton more than on hum ans. The universe wanted to have a new perspec tive, and for this had to createcreators like itself. I once asked a physicist if ever yone in his com munity accep ted by now that real ity was nonloca l. He conced ed that they did. “Isn’t nonlocal ity the sam e as omniscienc e?” I said. “There ’s no distance in time, no dist ance in spac e.

It provides us with food, air, water , and a great deal of scener y to exp lore. All of that com es from the auto matic side of cosmic intelligenc e. It cont inues on its own, but the side that wants to play is plugged into evolut ion, and Dharma is its way of telling us how the game works. If you look carefull y at the crit ical turning points in y our lif e, y ou’ll see how closel y you were paying at tention to the evolut ionar y game. BEIN G IN THE DH ARMA • You were ready to move forwar d. The experienc e of y our old reali ty was w orn out and read y for chang e. • You were ready to pay att ention. When the opportunit y arrived, y ou not iced it and took the nec essar y leap. • The environment supported you. When you mov ed forward, events fell into plac e to ensure that you didn’ t backslide. • You felt more expanded and fr ee in y our new plac e. • You saw y ourself as in some wa y a new person. This set of circu mstanc es, both inner and outer , is what Dhar ma provides. Which is to say that when you feel read y to mov e forward, real ity shifts to show you how . And when you aren’ t read y to mov e forward? Then there is the backup system of Vasana, which moves you forward by repea ting those tendenc ies that are embedded in you from the past. When you find yourself stuck and unable to make any progress at all, the following c ircu mstan ces usuall y appl y: 1. You aren’t ready to move. The exper ience of an old reality still fascina tes you. You keep enjoying your habitua l way of life, or else, if there is more pain than enjoyment, you are addic ted to the pain for some reason not y et reveal ed. 2. You aren’t paying attention. Your mind is caught up in distract ions. This is especi ally true if there is too much externa l stim ulation. Unless you feel aler t inside, you won’ t be able to pick up the hints and clues being sent from the one real ity. 3. The environment won’t support you. When you try moving forward, circu mst ances push you back. This kind of thwarting means that there is more to learn, or that the timing isn’t yet right. It also can be true that at a deep level you don’ t see yourself moving forward; your conscious desire is in confli ct with deeper doubt and uncerta inty. 4. You feel threatened by the expansion you would have to make, preferring the safet y of a limited self-i mage. Man y peopl e cling to a contract ed state, beli eving that it protects them. In fact, the grea test protec tion you could ask for comes from evolu tion, which solves problem s by expansion and forward movemen t. But you mus t own this knowledge com pletely; if any part of you wants to hang back in a constrict ed stat e, that ’s usua lly enough to block the road ahe ad. 5. You keep seeing yourself as the old person who adapt ed to an old situat ion. This is often an unconscious choice. People identif y with their past and try to use old perc eptions to understand what is happening. Since percept ion is ever ything, seeing yourse lf as too weak, limited, undeserving, or lacking will block any step forward. The full impl ication is th at Dhar ma needs y ou to col labora te. The upholding force is as mu ch in you as it is “out"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"there” in the universe or the real m of the soul. The single best way to align with the Dharm a is to assume that it is listening. Give the universe roo m to respond to you. Start up a rela tionship with it as with another person. I have been a doting grandfa ther for two years now , and I’m astonished that my granddaughter Tara has no proble m talking to trees, rocks, the ocean, or the sky. She takes for granted that there is sub jectivi ty ever ywhere. “See those dragons ?” she’ll say, pointing to an empt y space in the middle of the living roo m, naming a blue dragon here and a red one there. I ask Tara if she is afraid of the dragons, but she assures me tha t the y’ve alwa ys been friendl y. Childr en inhabit imaginar y worlds, not for the sake of pure fantas y but to test their crea tive instin cts. Tara is a creator in training, and if deprived of her rela tionship to trees, rocks, and dragons, she would be cut off from a power that needs to grow . At her age Tara’ s life is all playtime, and in the role of grandfather I try to immerse her in as much love and pleasure as possible. Her Vasana is going to be white if I can help it. But I also know that the grea t chal lenge for her will be to go beyond ever y tenden cy, good or bad. She will have to remain alert to stay in the Dhar ma, and for those of us who grew up to find that life is a serious business with few time- outs for pla y, the Dharm a awaits our return to sanit y. CHAN GING YO UR REALITY TO ACCO MMO DA TE THE EL EVENTH SECRET The eleventh secret is abou t escaping the bondage of cause and effect. The universe is alive, and imbued with subject ivit y. Cause and effect are just the machin ery it uses to carr y out what it wants to do. And what it wants to do is to live and breathe through you. To find out the truth of this, you need to relat e to the universe as if it were aliv e. Otherwise, how will you ever know that it is? Toda y, begin to adopt the following habi ts: Talk to the universe. Listen for its repl y. Be on int imate ter ms with Nature. See the life in ever ything. Carr y yourself lik e a ch ild of the universe. The first step, talking to the universe, is the mos t impor tant. It doesn’ t imply that you go around muttering to the stars or that you begin an imag inar y cosmic conversa tion. The habit of looking at the world “out there ” as disconnect ed from you is entrenched ; we all share a cultural bias that reserves life only for plan ts and animals, and that plac es intel ligen ce exc lusivel y in the brain. You can begin to break down this belief by acknowledging any hint that the inner and outer worlds are connect ed. Both have the same source; both are organi zed by the sam e deep inte lligen ce; both respond to ea ch othe r. When I say that you can talk to the universe, I mean you can connec t to it. If you feel depressed by a gray and rain y day, for exa mple, see the inner and outer grayness as the sam e phenom enon with objective and sub ject ive sides. If you are driving home from work and your gaze is caugh t by a glowing sun set, consider that Nature wanted to catch your atten tion, not that you and the sunset are having just an accid enta l encounte r. On some inti mate leve l, your existen ce m eshes with the universe, not b y chan ce but by intent ion. When you see the life that exists ever ywhere, acknowledg e what you’re seeing. At first, it may seem pecul iar to do this, but you are a co-cre ator , and you have the righ t to appre ciate the patt erns of connect ion that you’v e made. Carr ying yourself like a child of the universe isn’t a game of cosm ic pretend. At the level of the field, you exist ever ywher e in space time, a scien tific fact that we are carr ying a step further by saying that this moment in space time has a spec ial purpose in your world. It is your world, and by responding to it that wa y, you"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"will beg in to not ice that i t responds back: On so me days ever ything goes right.

Onl y you will kno w, but you won’ t if you don’ t first begin to attune yourse lf to the feeling. The closest para llel I can draw to this kind of priv ileged relationship is that betwe en lovers, in which ordinar y moments are suffused with a presenc e or specia lness that wouldn’ t be felt by an outsider . Som ething tota lly compelling draws your atten tion when you are in love ; once experien ced, it is not easi ly forgotten. You feel as if you are inside your beloved and your beloved is inside you. The merging of yourself with som ething vaster than y ourself is a blending of two s ubjectiv ities. It’ s been called the relat ionship of “I and thou,” or the sense of being as a wave on the infin ite ocean of Being. Don’ t let names and concepts distrac t you. There ’s no defined way for you to relate to the universe. Just relate in your own way. A little child like my granddaugh ter finds her way in talk ing to trees and invisible dragons.

Secret #12 THERE IS N O TIME BUT NOW THERE HAVE BEEN MO MENTS when my whole life made sense. I knew exa ctly who I was. The peopl e in my life were all there for a reason. Cle arly, and without a shred of doubt, I knew that the reason was love, so for that mo ment I could laugh at the preposterous not ion tha t I had ene mies or tha t I was a stranger in this world. Perfec tion has a mysterious way of slipping in and out of time. Few people, I imag ine, haven’ t felt the kind of moment I just describ ed, but I’ve never met a single person who could hold on to it. But people desperatel y want to, and often this hunger motivates their spiritu al life. In the Buddhist tradi tion, there are a wealth of exercises devo ted to mindfulness, a sta te of awareness in which you can be conscious of perfect moments. Let ’s hope they all beco me perfect. But to be aware, you must first catch yourself being unaware, which is difficu lt; after all, being unaware can be defin ed as not knowing tha t you aren’ t aware. I had a hard time with this slipp eriness until som eone told me, “It’ s like being happ y. When you’re happ y, you’re just happ y. You don’ t have to think about it. But then a moment comes when you say out loud, ‘I reall y feel happ y right now ,’ and it starts to disappea r. In fact, you can break the spell simpl y by thinking the words ‘I’m happ y right now’ to y ourse lf.” That one exa mpl e expla ined to me what it means to be mindful: You catch the present moment withou t word s or thought. Few things are easi er to describe and harder to do. The crux of the matter is time. Time is as slipper y as that blessed moment before you say “I’m happ y right now .” Was that moment reall y fleeting or is it"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"eterna l? Most of us take for granted that time flies, meaning that it passes too quick ly. But in the mindful state, time doesn ’t reall y pass at all. There is only a single instant of time that keeps renewing itself over and over with infini te varie ty. The secre t about time, then, is that it exists only as we usuall y think of it. Past, present, and future are only mental boxes for things we want to keep close or far from us, and b y saying that “tim e flies,” we conspire to prevent rea lity from coming too close. Is ti me a m yth we are using for our own conveni ence? Books are writ ten extol ling the virtues of living in the present momen t. There is good reason for this because the mind’s burdens come from the past. By itself, memory is weightless, and time should be, too. What people call “the now” is actua lly the disappear ance of time as a psycholog ical obstac le. When the obstacle is rem oved, you are no longer burdened by the past or the future— you’ve found the mindful state (and happin ess, too—the kind that needs neither words nor thoughts). What makes time a psycholog ical burden is ourselves—we have convinced ourselves that experi ences are built up over ti me. I’m older than y ou, I know what I’ m ta lking about. I’ve been around the block a few ti mes. Listen to the voice of exper ienc e. Pay atten tion to y our elders. These formulas make a virtue out of experi ence accu mul ated not with insigh t or aler tness but simpl y by hanging around. Mostl y they are futile expressions, howeve r. We all know at som e level that carr ying around a heav y suitc ase of ti me is what ma kes people gra y. To live in the present moment means dropping the suit case, not carr ying it with you. But how is this done ? In the one reali ty, the onl y time on th e clock is now . The trick to dropping the past is to find out how to l ive now as if it were forever . Photons mov e at Planck time, which matches the speed of light, while galaxies evolv e over bill ions of years. So if time is a river , it mus t be a very deep one and broad enough to conta in the least speck of time and the infini ty of ti melessness. This impl ies that “now” is more com plex than it looks. Are you in the now when you are most active and ener gized, or when you are most still? Take a look at a river. On the surfac e, the current is fast and restless. At the middle depths, the flow slows down, until one reaches the botto m, where the silt is only slightl y stirred before you touch bedrock, where the motion of water no longer has any effect. The mind is cap able of partic ipat ing at ever y lev el of th e rive r. You can run with the fastest curren t, which m ost people tr y to do in th eir ever yday lives. Their version of now is whatever has to be done rightnow . For them, the presen t moment contains constant dra ma. Time equals action, just as it does on the surface of the rive r. When they becom e exhausted from the race (or feel that they are losing it) people in a hurr y may final ly slow down, only to be surprised at how hard it actual ly is to go from running to walking. But if you decide, “Oka y, I’ll just keep going,” life brings new proble ms, such as obses sions, circular thinking, and so-call ed racing depression. In a sense, these are all disorders of ti me. Tagore has a wonderful phrase for this: “We’re too poor to be late.” In other words, we race through life as if we can’ t afford to throw awa y a single minute. In the same poe m, Tagore gives a perfe ct descrip tion of what you find after all the rushing around gets where it wants to go: And when the frantic race was over"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":" I could see the finish line Bursting with fear lest I be too lat e Only to find at the last minute That yet there is time. Tagore is refle cting on what it means to race through your life as if you haven’ t time to spare, only to find at the end that you alwa ys had etern ity. But our minds have a hard enough time adjusting to a slower pace when they are so condition ed to misusing time. An obses sive- com pulsiv e person, for exa mple, is typically pani cked by the clock. There is bare ly enough time to clean the hou se twice before company com es, barel y enough time to lin e up fort y pairs of s hoes in the closet and stil l make dinne r. Where did ti me go wrong ? Without being able to locat e the source of obse ssion, psycholog ists have discovered that low self-estee m is acco mpanied by negativ e words like lazy, dull, stupid, ugly, loser, worthless, and failure that get repe ated several hundred times per hour. This rapid-fir e repeti tion is both a symptom of mental suffering and a futile attempt to find a cure. The same word keeps coming back over and over because the person despera tely wants it to go awa y and y et has not discovered how to expunge it. Circular thinking is rela ted to obsession, but with more step s invo lved. Instead of chewing over a single notion like “the hou se isn’ t clean enough” or “I have to be perfe ct,” the person is impr isoned in false logic. An exa mpl e would be someone who feels unlovab le. No matter how much people expres s love for them, the circul ar think ers do not feel lovabl e because inside their minds they are saying, “I want to get love, and this person is saying he loves me, but I can’ t feel it, which mus t mean I am unlov able, and the only way I can fix that is to get love.” Circular logic afflicts those who never beco me successful enough, never feel safe enough, never feel wanted enough. The init ial premise that drives them to act (“I’m a failur e,” “I’m in danger ,” “I’m in need”) doe sn’t change bec ause ever y resul t from the outside, wheth er good or bad, reinfor ces the original idea. These exa mples bring us to the “paradox of now”: The faster you run in place, the further you are from the present m oment. Rac ing depres sion gives us a very clear picture of the paradox because depressed peopl e do feel inert, trapped in a frozen dead moment without any feel ing except hopel essness. For them, time is stand ing still, and yet their minds race with shredded ideas and emotions. This flurr y of mental activi ty doesn ’t seem like what should be going on in the head of someon e who can’ t get out of bed in the morning. But in this case, the mental flurr y is disconnect ed fro m ac tion. A depressed person thinks of coun tless things but acts on none of the m. When these problem s aren’ t present, the mind slows down by diving deepe r. People who take time out for themselv es are seeking the calm of solitude, where externa l dem ands are fewer . In its natura l state, the mind stop s reacting once external stim ulation goes awa y. This is like escaping the waves in the rive r’s shallows to find a depth where the current slows down. The present moment becom es a kind of lazy circul ar edd y. Your thoughts keep mov ing, but the y aren’ t so insist ent tha t the y push y ou for ward. Final ly, there are a few peop le who enjo y stillness more than activi ty, and they dive as deep as they can to find where the water stop s running, a point so still and deep that one isn’ t touched by the surface waves at all. Having found this stable cen ter, they experi ence themse lves to the maximum and the outside world to the minimum. One way or another , we’ve all experienc ed these different versions of the present moment, from an exhausting race to motion less calm. But what about the now that is right before you, this now ? In the one real ity, this now has no duration—re lative terms like fast and slow, past and future, don’ t appl y. The present moment includes faster than the fastest and slower than the slowest. Only when you include the whole river are you living in the one real ity, and then you’re living in a stat e of awareness tha t is ever fre sh and changel ess."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":" So ho w do y ou get there? To answer that, we have to look into relationships. When you meet som eone you kno w well—le t’s say your best friend—what happens ? The two of you perhaps meet at a restauran t to catch up, and y our talk is full of old, fam iliar things, which feels reassuring. But you also want to say something new , or the rela tionship would be static and boring. You kno w each other extre mely well alre ady, which is part of being best friends, yet at the sam e time you aren’ t totally predi ctabl e to one anoth er—the future will unfold new events, some happ y, some sad. Ten y ears from now one of y ou could be dead or divorc ed or turned into a stranger . This intersec tion of the new and the old, the known and the unknown, is the essence of all rela tionships, includ ing the ones you have with time, the universe, and yourse lf. Ulti mately, you are having only a single relat ionship. As you evolve, so doe s the universe, and the intersect ion of the two of you is time. There is only one relat ionship because there is only one real ity. It’s been a while since I referr ed to the four paths of Yoga, but each one is actua lly a flavor of rel ationship : • The path of knowledge (Gyana Yoga) has a flavor of mystery. You sense the inexp licab ility of life. You experien ce the wonder inside ever y experi ence. • The path of devotion (Bhakti Yoga) has the flavor of love. You experi ence the sweetness inside ever y experien ce. • The path of action (Karm a Yoga) has the flavor of selflessness. You experi ence the conne ctedness of ever y experien ce. • The path of meditation and inner silen ce (Raj Yoga) has the flavor of stillness. You experi ence the being inside ever y experien ce. Time exists so that you can experien ce these flavors as deepl y as pos sibl e. On the path of devotion, if you can experien ce even a glimmer of love, it’s possible to experi ence a little more love. When you experien ce that little more, then the next degree of intensi ty is pos sible. Thus, love engenders love unti l you reach the point of saturation, when you totally merge into divine love. This is what the mystics mean when they say that they plunge in to the ocean of love to drown the mse lves. Time unfolds the degrees of experienc e until you reach the ocean. Pick any quali ty that holds char m for you, and if you follow it far enough, with commitment and passion, you will merge with the absolute. For at the end of the path, each qualit y disappe ars, swallowed up by Being. Time isn’ t an arrow or a clock or a river; it’s actua lly a fluctua tion in the flavors of Being. Theore tically, nature could have been organi zed without a progres sion from less to more. You could experien ce love or mystery or self lessnes s at random . However , reali ty wasn’ t set up that way, at least not as experien ced through a human nervous system. We exper ienc e life as evolving. Relat ionships grow from the first hint of attrac tion to deep intimacy. (Love at first sight takes the sam e journe y but in a ma tter of m inutes inste ad of weeks and m onths.) Your relat ionship to the universe follows the same course—if you let it. Time is meant to be the vehic le for evo lution, but if you misuse time, it becom es a source of fear and anxie ty.

Nothing has gone wrong with the clocks in the house of someone who loses five hours’ sleep worrying about the possibili ty of dying from cance r. The misuse of time is only a symptom for misp laced attent ion. You can’ t have a relationship with som eone you don’ t pay attention to, and in your rela tionship to the universe, atten tion is paid here and now , or not at all. In fact, there is no univ erse excep t the one you perceiv e right now . So to relat e to the universe, you must focus on what lies in front of you. As one spiritu al teacher said, “The wholeness of creat ion is needed to bring about the present m oment.” If you take this to hear t, your attention will shift. Righ t now, ever y situat ion you are in is a mixture of past, present, and future. Imag ine yourself appl ying for a job. As you offer yourse lf to the scrutin y of a stranger , trying to handle the stress and make a good impr ession, you aren’ t actual ly in the now . “Will I get this job?” “How do I look ?” “W ere my reco mmendat ions good enough ?” “What ’s th is gu y thinking, anyway?” It see ms as if you can’ t help tumbling in the mix of past, present, and future. But the now can’ t be a mixture of old and new . It m ust be clear and open; otherwise, ther e is no unfolding of y ourself, which is the reason ti me exists. The present moment is real ly an opening, so it has no durat ion— you are in the now when time ceases to exist. Perhaps the best way to gain such an experienc e is to realize that the word present is link ed to the word presence. When the present moment beco mes filled with a presence that is all- absorbing, com pletely at peace, and tota lly satisf ying, y ou are in the now. Presence isn’ t an experienc e. Presenc e is felt whenever awaren ess is open enough. The situation at hand doesn ’t have to bear any respon sibility. Paradoxica lly, som eone can be in intense pain, only to find that in the middle of his suffering, the mind—un able to toler ate the bod y’s tormen t—suddenl y decides to abandon it. This is particu larl y true of psycholog ical pain—soldi ers caught in the terror of batt le report a moment of libera tion when intense stre ss is repla ced b y a rush of ecst atic rele ase. Ecst asy chang es ever ything. The bod y is no longer heav y and slow; the mind stop s experi encing its background mus ic of sadness and fear. Ther e is a dropping awa y of personali ty, replac ed by the sweetness of necta r. This sweetness can linger a long time in the hear t—som e peopl e say it can be tasted like hone y in the mouth—but when it leaves, you kno w beyond doubt that you have lost the now . In the mind’s scrapbook, you can insert a picture of perfe ct bliss, and that becom es like the first taste of ice crea m, an unat tainab le goa l you keep running after , onl y to find that ecstas y remains out of reach. The secret of ecstas y is that you have to throw it awa y once you’ve found it. Only by walking awa y can you experien ce the present moment again, the plac e where presenc e lives. Awarenes s is in the now when it kno ws itself. If we take awa y the vocabu lary of sweetness and bliss and nectar , the qual ity that is missing in most people’ s lives, the biggest thing that keeps them from being present, is sobrie ty. You have to be sober before you can be ecstati c. This isn’ t a paradox. What you’re hunting for—call it presenc e, the now, or ecst asy—is tota lly out of reach.

Listen to what y ou’re ac tual ly saying. Watch how y ou react. Rem ove yourself from the detai ls. Follow the rise and fall of ener gy. Quest ion y our ego. Im merse yourself in a spiri tual milieu. These instruct ions could com e dire ctly from a ghost hunt er’s handbook, or the hunter of unicorns. The present moment is more elusive than eith er, but if you want to get ther e passionate ly enough, sobriet y is the program you need to set up. Not payi ng attention: The first step is neither mystical nor extraord inar y. When you observe that you’re not paying attention, don’ t indulge your wandering. Com e back to where you are. Almost instant ly you’ll discover why you wandered awa y. You were either bored, anxious, insecur e, worr ying about something else, or antic ipat ing a futur e event. Don ’t evade any of those feel ings. The y are ingrained habits of awareness, habi ts you have trained yourself to follow auto matically. When you catch yourse lf drift ing awa y from what’s right in front of y ou, you begin to take back the now . Listening to what you’re saying: Having returned from your distra ction, listen to the words you’re saying, or the ones in your head. Rela tionships are driven forward with words. If you listen to yourself, you will know how you are relating to the universe righ t now. Don ’t be thrown off by the fact that there is another person in front of you. Whoev er you are talking to, including yourself, stands in for real ity itself. If you are complain ing about a lazy wai ter, you are compl aining about the universe. If you are sho wing off to someone you want to impress, you are trying to impress the universe. There is only one rela tionship. Listen to how it’s going at this moment. Watch your reaction: Ever y rela tionship is two-wa y, so whatever you are saying, the universe is responding. Watch your reac tion. Are you defensiv e? Are you acc epting and moving forward ? Do you feel safe or unsafe ? Again, don ’t be distrac ted by the person you are relating to. You are tuning in to the universe’ s respon se, closing the circ le tha t embr aces observer and observed. Remove yoursel f from the details: Before sobri ety, you had to find a way to adapt to the lone liness that comes from the absence of reality. Real ity is wholen ess. It is all- embrac ing. You dive in and there is nothing else. In the absence of wholen ess you still crave a sim ilar embrace, so you try to find it in fragm ents, bits and pieces. In other words, you tried to lose yourself in the details, as if sheer chaos and raucousness could saturate you to the point of fulf illment. Now you know that this strateg y didn’ t work, so back out of it. Remove yourse lf from the detai ls. For get the messin ess. Take care of it as efficientl y as pos sibl e, but don’ t take it seriousl y; don ’t make it import ant to who y ou are. Follo w the rise and fall of energy: Once the detai ls are out of the way, you still need something to follow ."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Your attention wants to go som ewhere, so take it to the heart of exper ience. The hear t of experi ence is the universe’ s brea thing rhythm as it pour s forth new situations, a rise and fall of ener gy.

You may exper ience these swings emotion ally at first, but try not to. This is a much more profound rh ythm.

Your ego has its own “right” way of doing things, and when you break that pattern, it will let you know of its displeasure. Change is fright ening, but more than that, it is threa tening to the ego. This fright is just a tactic to pull you back into line. You can’ t fight your ego’ s react ions because that will only deepen your involve ment with it. But you can question it, which means questioning yourself from a calm distan ce. “Wh y am I doing this?” “Isn’t this a knee-jerk reflex?” “How far have I gotten in the past acting like this ?” “Haven’ t I proved to myself that this doesn ’t work?” You must keep asking these stubborn questions over and over , with the inten t not of break ing down y our ego but of loosening its reflex ive hold over y our behavio r.

It wants you to think that life is lived in separation bec ause, with that beli ef, it can rationa lize grabbing as much for I, me, and mine as it can. In much the sam e way, the ego tries to grab spiritua lity as if it were a prized new possession. To counter that tendenc y, which will lead only to more isolat ion, immerse yourself in another world. I’m referring to the world where people consciousl y pursue experien ces of presence, where there ’s a common vision of transfor ming dual ity into unit y. You can find such an environ ment in the grea t spiritu al texts. As someon e who found untold hope and consolat ion in such writings, I can’ t urge you more strongl y to turn to them. But there is a living world to meet as well. Immerse yourse lf in a spiritu al contex t, according to how you define spirit. Expe ct to be disappoint ed when you get there, too, because it’s inev itab le that you will meet the mos t frustrat ion a mong people struggl ing with th eir i mperfec tions. The fer ment you me et is y our own. Once you commit yourself to being sober , there is nothing more to do. Presence will appe ar on its own, and when it does, your awareness canno t help but be in the now . A moment in the now causes an interna l change felt in ever y cell. Your nervous system is being taught a way of processing real ity that isn’ t old or new , known or unknown. You rise to a new leve l of being in which presence matters for itse lf alone, and it matters absolutel y. Ever y other experien ce is relativ e and ther efore can be rejected, forgotten, discount ed, put out of mind. Presence is the touch of real ity itself, which cannot be rejected or lost. Each encounter makes you a little more rea l. Evid ence of this com es in many ways, the most immediate of which has to do with time itself. When the only time on the clock is now , the following becom es y our ac tual experien ce: 1. The past and the future exist only in imagina tion. Ever ything you did before has no reality. Ever ything you will do af terward has no real ity. Only the th ing y ou are doing now is real. 2. The bod y you once call ed yourself is not who you are anymore. The mind you once called yourself is not who you are anymore. You step out of them easil y, without effort. Both are temporar y patterns that the universe took for an instant before m oving on. 3. Your actual self manifests at this moment as thoughts, emotions, and sensat ions passing acros s the screen of awareness. You recogni ze them as the meeting point between change and timelessnes s.

The best use of time is to reconnec t to your being. The misuse of time com es down to the oppo site: moving awa y from your being. There is alwa ys enough time to evolve because you and the universe are unfolding togeth er. How can you prove that to yourse lf? One wa y is through a San skri t pract ice call ed Sankalpa. Any intention or thought that you put y our will behind is a Sankalp a. Includ ed in the term is the whole idea of means: Having made a wish or had a thought you want to com e true, how do you actual ly get results ? The answer depends a great dea l on your relat ionship to time (the root word kalpa means “ti me”). • If timelessness is part of your being, the wish will com e true spontaneousl y without delay. You have the power to pla y with ti me as y ou would an y other part of y our world. • If timelessness has a tentative relat ionship to your being, som e wishes will come true spontan eousl y, others won’t. There will be dela ys and an uneas y sense that you might not get what you want. Your abili ty to play with time is shak y but deve loping. • If timelessness has no relationship to your being, it will take work and deter mination to get what you want. You have no power over ti me. Instead of pla ying with it, you are sub ject to its inexorab le m arch. Fro m these three broad categories one can project thre e different belief systems. Consider which one best applies to y ou. 1. I am pressed for time. Ther e aren’ t enough hours in the day to acco mplish ever ything I want. Other people make a lot of dem ands on m y time, and it’ s all I can do to keep ever ything in bal ance. Wha t I’ve got ten in life I’ve earned through hard work and det erm ination. As far as I kno w, this is the road to success. 2. I consider myself pretty lucky. I’ve gotten to do a lot of the things I’ve alwa ys wanted to do. Although my life is bus y, I find a way to make enough time for m yself. Ever y once in a while things just fall into place on their own. Deep down, I expe ct m y wishes to com e tru e, but I a m oka y if the y don’ t. 3. I believe that the universe brings you whatever you need. Cert ainl y that’s true in my life. I’m amazed to find that my ever y thought brings some response. If I don’ t get what I want, I real ize that something inside me is blocking it. I spend ti me working on m y inner awaren ess far mo re than struggling with outside forces. These are just snapshots of Sankalp a, but most peopl e fall into one of these categori es. The y represent, aga in in a very gener al way, three stages of personal evolut ion. It’s useful to know that they exist, for many peop le would find it hard to beli eve that ther e is any reali ty other than the first one, in which hard work and deter mination are the onl y keys to gett ing what y ou want."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":" Once you gain even a hint that wishe s can come true withou t so much struggle, you can resolve to move to a new stage of growth.

Secret #13 YO U ARE TRUL Y FREE WHEN YOU ARE NOT A PERSO N SEVERA L YEAR S AGO IN A SM ALL VILLAGE outside New Delhi, I was sitting in a smal l, stuf fy room with a very old man and a young priest. The priest sat on the floor swaying back and forth as he reci ted words inked on bark sheets that looked anc ient. I listened, having no idea what the priest was inton ing. He was from the far south and his langu age, Tamil, was fore ign to m e. But I knew he was tel ling me the stor y of m y life, past and future. I w ondered how I got roped into this and began to squirm . It had taken strong persuasion from an old friend to get me to the smal l roo m. “It’s not just Jyotish, it’s much more amazing, ” he coax ed. Indian astrolog y is called Jyotish, and it goes back thousands of years. Visiting your fam ily astrologer is com mon practi ce ever ywher e in Indi a, where peopl e plan weddings, births, and even routine business transa ctions around their astrologi cal char ts (Indira Gandhi was a famous exa mpl e of som eone who followed Jyotish), but modern times have led to a fading awa y of tradi tion. I had chronic ally avoid ed any brushes with Jyotish, being a child of m odern India and lat er a working doctor in the West. But my friend prevai led, and I had to admit that I was curious about what was going to happen. The young priest, dressed in a w rapped skirt with bare chest and hair shin y with coconut oil—both ma rks of a southerner— didn’ t draw up my birth chart. Ever y chart he needed had alread y been drawn up hundreds of years ago. In other word s, someon e sitting under a palm tree many generations ago had taken a strip of bark, kno wn as a Nadi, and inscribed my life on it. These Nadis are scat tered all over Indi a, and it’s pure chanc e to run across one that applies to you. My friend had spent severa l years tracking down just one for him self; the priest produced a whole sheaf for me, much to my friend ’s am azed deligh t. You have to co me for the reading, he insisted."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":" Now the old man sitting acros s the tabl e was interpre ting in Hindi what the priest was chanting. Bec ause of overlapping birth times and the vagar ies of the calend ar when we are speaking of centur ies, Nadis can overl ap, and the first few sheets didn’ t app ly to me. But by the third shee t or so, the young priest with the sing-s ong voice was read ing facts that were startling ly precise: my birth date, my paren ts’ names, my own name and my wife’ s, the numb er of children we have and where they live now , the day and hour of my fathe r’s recent dea th, his exact nam e, and m y mother’s. At first there seemed to be a glit ch: The Nadi gave the wrong first nam e for my mother, calling her Such inta, when in fact her name is Pushpa. This mistake bother ed me, so I took a break and went to a phone to ask her about it. My mother told me, with grea t surprise, that in fact her birth name was Suchin ta, but since it rhymed with the word for “sad” in Hindi, an uncle suggested that it be changed when she was three years old. I hung up the phone, wondering what this whole experien ce meant, for the young priest had also read out that a rela tive would interven e to change my mother ’s name. No one in our family had ever mentioned this incid ent, so the young priest wasn’ t indulg ing in so me kind of m ind- reading. For the benefi t of skepti cs, the young priest had passed nearl y his whole life in a templ e in South India and did not speak Engl ish or Hindi. Neither he nor the old man knew who I was. Anyway, in this school of Jyotish, the astrologer doesn’ t take down your birth time and cast a personal chart which he then interpr ets. Instead, a person walks into a Nadi reader ’s house, the read er takes a thumbprin t, and based on that, the matching charts are locat ed (alwa ys keep ing in mind that the Nadis may be lost or scatter ed to the wind s). The astro loger reads out only what som eone else has written down perhaps a thousand years ago. Here’ s ano ther twist to the mystery: Nadis don ’t have to cover ever yone who will ever live, only those individua ls who will one day show up at an astrologer ’s door to ask for a read ing! In rapt fascinat ion I sat through an hour of mor e arcane infor mation about a past life I had spent in a South Indian temple, and how my transgres sions in that lifetime led to painful proble ms in this one, and (after a moment’s hesita tion while the reader asked if I real ly wanted to know) the day of my own dea th. The date falls reassuringl y far in the futur e, although even more reassuring was the Nadi’ s prom ise that my wife and children would lead long lives full of love and acco mplish ment. I walked awa y from the old man and the young priest into the blinding hot Delhi sun shine, almost dizz y from wonder ing how my life would chang e with this new kno wledge. It wasn’t the deta ils of the reading that mattered. I have forgotten nearl y all of them , and I rarel y think of the inciden t exc ept when my eye falls on one of the pol ished bark sheets, now fra med and kept in a pla ce of honor in our hom e. The young priest handed it to me with a shy smi le before we parted. The one fact that turned out to have a deep impac t was the day of my death. As soon as I heard it, I felt both a profound sense of pea ce and a new sobriet y that has been subtly changing my priorit ies ever since. Reflec ting on ever ything now , I wish ther e was another name for astrolog y, like “nonloc al cogni tion.” Som eone who lived cen turies ago knew me better than I kno w myself. He saw me as a pattern in the universe playing itself out, linked to earlier patterns layer upon layer. I felt that with that piece of bark I rece ived firsthand proof tha t I a m not restri cted to the bod y, mind, or exper iences I call “me.” If you live at the center of one reality, you begin to witness patterns com ing and going. At first, these patterns continue to feel personal. You creat e the patterns, and that brings a sense of attach men t. But artists are fam ous for not collect ing their own works; it is the act of creation itself that brings satisfact ion. Once completed, the paint ing holds no mor e life; the juice has been squee zed out of it. The same holds true for the patterns we creat e. Exper ience loses its juice when y ou know that you creat ed it. The notion of detach ment, which crops up in ever y Eastern spiritu al tradi tion, troubles many people, who equate it with being passive and disinter ested. But what’s real ly implied is the same detach ment any crea tor has once the work is done. Having crea ted an experienc e and then lived it out, one finds that detach ment comes natural ly. It doesn ’t happen all at once, howeve r. For a long time we rem ain fascinated by the play of dualit y with its constan tly warring opposites. Yet eventua lly one is read y to under go the experienc e call ed metanoia— Greek for having a change of heart."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Because the word cropped up so many times in the New Testament, it took on a more spiritua l mean ing. It signified chang ing your mind about leading a sinful life, then it gain ed the connotat ion of repent ance, and final ly it expanded to mean eterna l salvat ion. Yet if you step outside the walls of theolog y, metanoia is very close to what we’ve been calling transfor mation. You shift your sense of self from local to nonloca l. Instead of call ing any experienc e “mine,” you see that ever y pattern in the universe is temporar y. The universe keeps shuffling its basic ma terial into new shapes, and for a ti me you have called one of those shapes “m e.” Metanoia is the secre t behind Nadi reading, I think. A long-ago seer looked inside himself and picked a rippl e of consciousness that had the nam e Deepak attached to it. He wrote the name down along with other deta ils that rippled out into spac etime. This implies a leve l of awareness that I should be able to reach inside myself. If I could see myself as a ripple in the field of ligh t ( Jyotish is San skri t for “light”), I would find the freedo m that cannot be attained by rem aining who I am inside my accepted boundaries. If my parents’ names were known before my birth, and if my fath er’s time of dea th could be reckon ed generat ions before he was born, these precondit ions are c losed of f to change. True freedom occurs only in nonloca l awareness. The ability to shift from local to nonloc al awareness is for me the meaning of rede mpt ion or salva tion. You go to tha t plac e where the soul lives withou t having to die first. Rather than argue the metaph ysics of this again, let me reduce the issue of nonloca lity to som ething ever yone is pursuing: happin ess. To tr y to be happ y is intensel y personal, and therefore it’s som ething we give over to the ego, whose sole goa l is to make “me” happ y. If it turns out that happiness lies outside “me,” in the dom ain of nonlocal awaren ess, that would be a convin cing argum ent for me tano ia. Happiness is a com plex thing for hum an beings. We find it hard to experien ce happin ess without being rem inded of the things that could shatt er it. Som e of these things stick to us from our past as trau matic wounds; others are pro ject ions into th e future as w orries and antic ipat ions of disaster . It’s no one’ s faul t that happin ess is elusiv e. The play of opposites is a cos mic drama, and our minds have been condit ioned to fit into it. Happiness, as ever yone know s, is too good to last. And this is true, as long as you define it as “my” happiness; by doing so you have alre ady tied yourself to a wheel that mus t spin to the other side. Metanoia, or nonlocal awareness, solves this proble m by transcend ing it because there is no other way. The elements making up your life are confli cting. Even if you could manipula te ever y element so that it consistentl y led to happiness, there is the subtl e proble m of i mag ined suf fering. Therapists spend years detaching people from all the things they imagine might go wrong with their lives, things tha t have nothing to do with actua l cir cum stanc es. This rem inds me of an exper ience that occurred to a medical coll eague when I was in train ing years ago. He had an anxious pati ent who came in ever y few months for a complete physical, terrifi ed by the prospect of contrac ting canc er. The X-rays were alwa ys nega tive, but she cont inued to com e back, each time as worried as before. Finall y after many years, her X-ra y did inde ed confir m that she had a malignan cy. With a triu mph ant look she cried, “See, I to ld y ou so!” Im agin ed suf fering is as real as an y other kind, and som etimes th ey merge. The fact that anyone would cling to unhappiness as fierce ly as others cling to happiness is baffling until you look more closel y at loca l awareness. Loc al awaren ess is caugh t on the border between the ego and the universe. This is an anxious place. On the one hand, the ego operates as if it were in control. You naviga te through the world on the unspoken assum ption that you are impor tant and that getting what you want matters. But the universe is vast and the forces of nature impersonal. The ego’ s sense of contro l and self- import ance seem like a total illusion when you consider that human beings are bare ly a speck on the cos mic canvas. Ther e is no securit y for the indiv idual who senses deep down tha t he or she is pret ending to be at the cent er of crea tion —the ph ysical evid ence of y our unim portan ce is too overwhelm ing. But is escape reall y possible? In its own dom ain, the ego says no. Your personal ity is a karmic patt ern fierce ly holding on to itse lf. However , when you deta ch yourself from local awareness, you stop playing the ego’ s gam e —m eaning that you step outside the whole proble m of making “me” happ y. The individua l can’ t be crushed by"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"the universe if there is no indiv idual. As long as you attach your identi ty to even one smal l part of your ego- personalit y, ever ything else com es along. It’s like walking into a theat er and hear ing an actor say the words “To be or not to be.” Instant ly you know the char acte r, his histor y, and his tragi c fate. Actors can throw off one role and put on another without having to do more than make a quick mental adjust ment. Rem embering to be Ham let inste ad of Macbeth isn’ t done one word at a time. You simpl y call the right char acter up. Moreover , when you chang e one char acter for another , you find yourself in a new plac e— Scotland instead of D enmark, a witch ’s ca mp beside the road instead of a castl e by the North Sea. One way to give up local awareness is to real ize that you alre ady have. When you go home for Thanksgiving, you probabl y find yourself fall ing auto matically into the role of the child you once were. At work, you play a different role than when you go on vac ation. Our minds are so good at storing tota lly confli cting roles that even small children know how to switch smoo thly from one to the other . When cand id cameras are set up to catch three- year-olds at play withou t adults around, paren ts are often shocked by the transform ations they see before their eyes: The sweet, obedient, conci liator y child they knew at hom e can turn into a raging bull y. Some child psycho logists go so far as to claim that upbringing plays only a minor part in who we grow up to be. Two children raised under the same roof with the sam e parenta l atten tion can be so different outside the hom e as to be unrecogni zable as siblings. But it would be more correc t to say that growing children learn many roles sim ultaneousl y, and the role learned at hom e is onl y one of ma ny—nor should we expec t it to be otherwise. If you can see this in yourself, then nonlo cal awareness is only a step awa y. All you need to real ize is that all your roles exist simul taneousl y. Just like an actor , you keep your personas in a plac e beyond space and time. Macbeth and Ham let are simultaneousl y found inside an acto r’s memor y. It takes hours to play them out on the stage, but their real home isn’ t a place where hours pass. In awareness, the whole role exists silent ly but is com plete in ever y det ail. Lik ewise, you store your overl apping roles in a place that is more hom e to you than the stage where you play out the dram as. If you try to sort out these overlapping roles, you’ll find none of them is you. You are the one who pushes the me ntal button to enabl e the role to spring to life. From your vast reper toire, you select situat ions that play out personal karma, each ingredien t seamlessl y fitting into plac e to provide the illusion of being an individu al ego. The real you is deta ched from any role, any scener y, any dram a. In spiri tual terms, detach men t isn’ t an end unto itse lf—it develops into a kind of mastery. When you have this mas tery, you can shift into nonloca l awareness anytime you want. This is what the Shiva Sutras mean by using memory without allowing memory to use you. You exer cise deta chm ent by stepping outside your memorized persona, and then the karma atta ched to any role no longer sticks. If you try to change your karma one piece at a time, you may ach ieve limited resul ts, but the improved mod el of y ourself will not be an y more free than the unim proved one. If there is reall y a secret to happiness, it can be found only at the source of happin ess, which has the following charac terist ics: THE S OURCE OF H APPI NESS IS . . . Nonlo cal Detached Im personal Universal Be yond change Made of essence"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":" This list breaks down metanoi a into its componen t parts. Metanoia original ly meant a change of hear t, and I think th e sam e ele men ts appl y: Nonlocal: Before you can have a change of heart, you must step outside yourself to get a larger perspectiv e. The ego tries to narrow ever y issue down to “What will I get out of this?” When you refra me the question as “What will we get out of this ?” or “What will ever yone get out of this ?” your heart will immediately feel less confined and constric ted. Detached: If you have a stake in a particu lar outco me, you can’ t afford a chang e of hear t. The boundari es are drawn; ever yone has chosen a side to be on. The ego insists that keep ing your eye on the priz e— meaning the result it wants—is all-important. But in deta chmen t, you real ize that many outco mes could be benefi cial to you. You work toward the outco me you believe is right, yet you rem ain deta ched enough to shift when your heart tells y ou that you should. Impersonal: Situa tions seem to happen to people, but in reality they unfold from deeper karmic causes. The universe unfolds to itself, bringing to bear ever y cause that needs to be included. Don’t take this process personall y. The working out of cause and effect is etern al. You are part of this rising and falling that never ends, and only by riding the wave can you ensure that the waves don’ t drown you. The ego takes ever ything personall y, leaving no roo m for higher guidance or purpose. If you can, realize that a cosm ic plan is unfolding and apprec iate the incredib ly woven tapestr y for w hat it is, a design of unpara lleled m arvel. Unive rsal: One time, when I was trying hard to understand the Buddhist concept of ego death (a concep t that seem ed at the time very cold and heartless), someone eased my mind by saying, “It’s not that you destro y who you are. You just expand the sense of ‘I’ from your little ego to the cos mic ego.” Tha t’s a big propo sition, but what I liked abou t this version is that nothing gets exclud ed. You start seeing ever y situa tion as belonging in our world, and even though that sense of inclusion may start out sma ll— my family, my house, my neighborhood— it can grow natural ly. The very fact that the ego finds it absurd to say my world, my galax y, my universe implies that there is a shift at hand that it can’ t make on its own. The key idea is to keep in mind that awaren ess is universal, however confined your ego ma kes y ou fee l at any given mo ment. Beyond change: The happin ess you are used to comes and goes. Instead of thinking of this as a well that runs dry, imagine the atm osphere. There ’s alwa ys hum idity in the atmosphere, and som etimes it releases itself as rain. The days when it doesn’ t rain haven’ t made the hum idity go awa y; it’s alwa ys present in the air, waiting to precipi tate as condit ions chang e. You can take the sam e attitude toward happiness, which is alwa ys presen t in awareness without hav ing to prec ipit ate ever y moment—i t sho ws itse lf as condit ions change. People are different in their baselin e of emotion, and some experien ce more cheerfu lness, opti mis m, and cont entment than others. This varie ty expresses the diversi ty of creation. You can’ t expect the desert and the rain forest to behave the sam e. Yet these alter ations in personal makeup are superfi cial. The same unchanging happiness can be accessed in ever yone’s awareness. Know that this is true, and don’ t use the ups and downs of your personal happiness as a reason for not journe ying to the source. Essence: Happiness is not a unique thing. It is one flavor of essence among many. One time, a disciple com plained to his teach er that all the time spent on spiritu al work hadn’ t made him happ y. “Your job right now isn’ t to be happ y,” the teacher swiftl y repli ed. “Your job is to beco me real.” Essence is real, and when you capture it, happiness follows because all the quali ties of essence follow . Trying to be happ y as an end in itself is limited; you will be fortunat e just to meet your ego’ s requir ements for a happ y life. If instead you devote yourse lf to a total shift in awaren ess, happiness arrives as a gif t freel y bestowed b y consciousness.

One of the most common sights in India, or anywher e else in the East, used to be saffron-robed monks in meditation before dawn. Man y other people (my grandm other and mother among them) rise at the sam e earl y hour and go to the temple to pray. The point of this practi ce is th at the y are m eeting the day before it begins. To meet the day before it begins means that you are present when it is born. You open yourse lf to a possibili ty. Because there are not yet any events, the infant day is open, fresh, and new . It could turn into anything. The meditating monks and the people at prayer want to add their influence of consciousness at that critica l moment, like being present for the beginn ing of a bab y’s life. Toda y you can do the sam e thing. Wake up as earl y as you usual ly do—idea lly you would perform this exercise at first light in a seat ed position, but you can do it lying in bed before you get up—and let your mind look forward to the day ahead. At first you will probabl y not ice the residue of habit. You will see yourself going through your usual routine at work, the ever yday duties surrounding your family and other obligat ions. Then you are likely to experien ce residues from yesterd ay: the project you haven’ t finished, the deadlin e com ing up, an unre solv ed disagree men t. Next you will likely experien ce the return of worries, whatever is hanging over your head at the m oment. Let all this move in and out of awareness as it wants to. Have the inten tion that you want this tangle of images and word s to clea r. Your ego is going to take care of all these habi tual issue s anyway. Keep looking at the day ahead, which is not a thing of images or though ts since it is just being born. Get a feel ing for it; try to meet it with y our being. After a few moments you’ ll noti ce that your mind is less incl ined to jump out of bed. You will drift in and out of a fuzz y awareness—this means you have dived a bit deep er than the surfac e layer of mental restlessnes s. (Don’ t let yourself fall asleep again, however . When drow siness arises, return to your inten tion of meeting the day.) At this point you’ll find that, instead of images, your mind sett les into a rhythm of feelings. Th is stat e is more difficul t to describe than imag es or voices. It’s like a sense of how things are going to be, or a sensation of being read y for whatever will come. Don’ t look for anything dramatic. I’m not talking about premon itions and portents. You are having a simple experien ce: Your being is meeting the day at the level of incubat ion, where events are seeds getting read y to sprout. Your only purpo se is to be ther e. You don’ t need to change anything ; you don’ t have to atta ch yourself to judg men ts or opinions about what you think should unfold toda y. When you me et the day, you add the influenc e of y our awareness in silence. And what good is that? The effect occurs on a subtle level.

Secret #14 THE MEA NING O F LIFE IS EVER YTHING HAVE WE COME CLO SER to answering the ulti mate quest ion, “What is the meaning of life?” Imagine for a moment that som eone came up with an answer . Direc tly or indirec tly, most of the tradit ional answers have cros sed ever yone’s path ; the me aning of life usuall y com es down to a higher purpose, s uch as: To glor ify God To glor ify God’ s creat ion To lov e and be loved To be true to oneself As with many other spiritua l questions, I find it difficult to imagine how these answer s cou ld be test ed. If someone holds down a good job, supports his or her fam ily, pays taxes, and obe ys the law , is that an exa mpl e of glorif ying God or of being true to oneself? In times of great crisis, such as war , doe s the mean ing of life change? Perhaps it is al l one can do to sta y alive and be reasonabl y happ y in a crisis. One way to test the answer to the question “What is the meaning of life?” would be to write it down, seal it in an envelope, and mail it to a thousand people picked at random . If the answer is righ t, anyone who opens the envelope would read what is writt en and sa y, “Yes, y ou’re right. That ’s the meaning of l ife.” A breath less y oung bride would agre e on her wedding day. A paral yzed old man would agree on his deathb ed. People who war bitt erly over differences in polit ics and religion would agree, and so would those who enjo y a marri age of the mind. This might seem like an impossible test, however , since there might be absolu tely no answer that would satisf y ever yone. But what if the piec e of paper is blank, or if it said, “The meaning of life is ever ything”? In the one reali ty, these aren’ t trick answers but very close to each other in reading the truth. The blank piece of paper indica tes tha t life is pure poten tial unti l som eone shapes it into something. The mean ing of pure pot entia l is tha t life is infini tely open. Sim ilarly, to say that the mean ing of life is ever ything indica tes that life leaves nothing and no one out. “Ever ything” is ju st another wa y to em brac e the infini te range of pos sibi lities. Life refuses to be pinned down. Whatever meaning you want the univ erse to refl ect, it provides. In mediev al Europe, people wanted the universe to refle ct their intense belief in the Hol y Trinit y; at that sam e period in"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"histor y, people in India wanted the universe to refle ct the cosm ic danc e of Shiva and his consort Shakti. Wherever Isla m held swa y, the universe was expect ed to reflect the will of Allah. Right now , agnostics expec t the universe to refl ect their own spiritu al confusion and doubt; therefore, the cos mos seems to be a rando m explosion that began with the Big Bang. Man y religious people accep t this reali ty, except on Sunda y, when the universe feeb ly refle cts the possibi lity of a divine make r. If you try to pin the universe down to one refle ction, you pin your own life down at the sam e time. Rea lity is like a two-wa y mirror that sho ws you yourse lf as well as what lies on the other side. This mutual effect is mandat ed because the univ erse doesn’ t pos sess one set of facts. You the observer bring your version of reality into be ing. Let me offer an exa mple of how the two-w ay mirror work s in the fie ld of m edicin e. It seems completely baffling that the hum an bod y can be heal ed in so many ways. If you take almost any disease like canc er, ther e is a typical histor y that the illness usuall y follows. Breast can cer, for exam ple, has a kno wn surviva l rate from the time of the first dete cted anom aly in the breast cells. Women who contrac t the disease will fall somewher e on the bell curve of survival. As one oncologist told me years ago, can cer is a num bers gam e. A statist ical range will tell you at what age the disease is most like ly to occur . The respon se of tum ors to different modes of radiat ion and che mother apy is constant ly being docum ented. With these facts in hand, medicine proceeds to find a defin itive cure, and if the defin itive cure hasn’ t been found yet, science will keep working unti l it is. Outside the stat istica l norm , however , strange things are happen ing. In my own medical exper ience, I have met the fol lowing pati ents: • A young woman who told me that her mother , living on a farm in remot e Vermont, deve loped a large tum or in her breast but dec ided that she was too busy to get it treat ed. She survived more than a decade withou t medical atten tion. • A wom an who felt a lump in her breast and decid ed to visual ize it awa y. She saw hordes of white cells descending like snow to engulf the lump. After she perform ed this visualiz ation for six months the lum p was gone. • A wom an with a massive tumor che cked out of the hospita l a day before surgery bec ause she didn’ t want to approach her condit ion out of fear and panic. She returned months later only when she felt confid ent of her surviv al. The operation succeeded and she did survive. Ever y doctor has encounter ed the oppo site side of the spectru m, women who die very quick ly after rece iving new s of a sma ll numb er of malignant cells in the ir breast. (In some cases, the cells are anom alous, meaning that they might be harm less, yet in a few wom en these ano malies quick ly turn into tumors. This phenom enon was tagged long ago as “dying from the diagnosis.”) I am not making reco mmendat ions about how to approach cancer , only observing that the disease often seems to reflect the beliefs brought to it by the patient. A now- fam ous stud y by David Siege l at Stanford took a group of wom en who had late-stage breast canc er and divid ed them into two groups. One group was given the best medical care, which by that point was very little. The other group sat down once a week and shared their feelings about having the disease. This alone produced a rem arkab le resul t. After two years, all the long- term survivors belong ed to the second group, and the overal l surviv al in that group was half again as long as in the group that didn’ t discu ss their feel ings. In essenc e, the women who confronted their e motions were able to shift the reflec tion in the m irro r. The human bod y runs on dual con trols. If you heal it from the outside by material means, it will respond. If"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"you hea l it from the inside by sub jective means, it will also respond. How can it be that talk ing about your feelings can have as much effect as a powerful can cer drug (or even more)? The answer is that consciousness alwa ys takes these two roads. It unfolds object ivel y as the visible universe and sub ject ivel y as events inside the mind. Both are the same consciousnes s. The same intelligence has put on two masks, different iating into the world “out ther e” and the one “in here.” So the wisps of feeling that arise in a cancer patien t communica te with the bod y much like the m olecul es of a drug. This phenom enon isn’ t rem arkab le anymore— all of mind-bod y medicine is based on the discover y of messenger molecules that begin in the brain as thoughts, beli efs, wishes, fears, and desires. The break through will come when medicine stops giving all the credit to molecul es. When Mozart wanted to compose a new symphon y, his inten tion called up the necessar y brain func tion. It would be absurd to say that Mozart’ s brain wanted to write a symphon y first and produced messenger molecules to inform him of the fact. Awareness alwa ys comes first, and its projections, both ob jective and sub ject ive, follow . This brings us to a new princip le that is cruc ially impor tant, call ed “simultaneous interdep endent co- arising.” Simultaneous because one thing doesn’ t cause anoth er. Interdependen t because each aspect is coordinat ed with ever y othe r. Co-arising bec ause ever y separa te par t co mes from the sa me source. When Mozart wanted to compose a symphon y, ever ything associa ted with his creat ion happened sim ultaneousl y: the idea, the notes, the sound in his head, the necessar y brain activit y, the signals to his hands as they wrote the music down. All these ingredien ts were organized into one experien ce, and they arose togethe r. It would be false to say that one caused the other . If one element should fall out of plac e, the whole project would collapse. Should Mozart get depressed, his emotional state will block the music. Should he get physicall y exhausted, fatigue will block the mus ic. One can think of a hundred ways that disorder could disrupt the picture: Mozart could have had marital proble ms, a stroke or heart attack, a sudden ar tistic block, or the nois y distrac tion of a two-y ear-old in the house. Creation is kept from anar chy by simultaneous co- arising. The cos mos matches the hum an mind far too closel y to ignore. It’s as if the univ erse were putt ing on its mind- boggling show of galaxi es exploding from nothingn ess only to tease us. It makes no sense that a process spann ing billions of light years and expand ing with unbeliev able speed to generate trillions of stars should climax with the appearanc e of human DN A. Wh y did the universe need us to look on in wonder? Perhaps it’s because real ity just work s that way: The unfolding cosm ic drama exists simul taneousl y with the human brain, an instru men t so finel y attun ed that it can delve into any leve l of nature. We are the ulti mate audienc e. Nothing gets past us, no m atter how m inuscu le or vast. Now an extr aordinar y answer is beginning to dawn: Maybe we are putting on the whole show ourselves. The meaning of life is ever ything because we dem and noth ing less than the universe as our pla yground. Quantu m physics long ago conc eded that the observer is the deciding factor in ever y observat ion. An electron has no fixed position in spac e until som eone looks for it, and then the electron pops up precisel y where it was looked for. Until that moment, it only exists as a wave propaga ting ever ywher e through space. That wave could collapse into a part icle anywhere. Ev ery single atom in the universe has a minute probabil ity of be ing located as far awa y as pos sible or as near as po ssible. The universe run s on a switch with onl y two posit ions, on and of f. “On” is the ma terial world with all its even ts and objects. “Off” is pure possibili ty, the changing room where part icles go when no one is looking. The “on” position can be controll ed only by extern al means. Once you ligh t it up, the physical universe behaves by a set of rules. But if you catch it in the “off” position, the universe can be changed without regard for time and space. Nothing is heav y and immov able in the “off” position because ther e are no objects. Nothing is close or far awa y. Nothing is trapped in the past, present, or future. The “off” position is pure poten tial. There, your bod y is a set of possibili ties waiting to happen, and presen t, too, are all those pos sibilities that have alread y happened and those that might happen. In the “off” position, ever ything in creat ion collapses down to a point, and miracu lousl y, you live at that point; it is y our source."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":" “On” and “o ff” don ’t give quit e an ac curate pictur e, however . Just as ther e are ma ny degrees of ph ysical rea lity, there are many degrees of nonph ysical real ity. Your bod y is a solid object, a swirl of atoms, a storm of suba tom ic parti cles, and a ghost of ener gy, all at the sa me time. These sta tes are si multaneous, but each operates according to differen t rules. In physics, this jumb led set of rules is called a “tangled hierar chy.” The word hierarchy indi cates that the levels are stacked in a certa in order . Your bod y is in no danger of flying apart into rando m ato ms because, in the hier arch y of things, solid objects stay in place, but in truth you are a cloud of elec trons and a probabi lity wave and ever ything in between. That is the “on” position. In the “off” position, the same tangl e continu es but is totally out of sight. The invisibl e dom ain is divided in strange ways. At one level, events are all mer ged. Beginnings and endings meet; nothing happens without affect ing ever ything else. But at another level, som e events are more import ant than others; some can be contro lled while others may floa t around with only the weakest kind of causa tion. By analog y, look inside your mind: Some thoughts demand to be acted on while others are passing whim s; some follow stric t logic while others obe y very loose associa tions. Even ts in the universe are exact ly the sam e mixed bag of potent ial events. If y ou want to, y ou can div e deep into the “off” position and start bringing up the events you want. You have to be prepar ed to meet the tang led hierarch y head on, however , because ever y event you might want to chang e is en meshed in ever y other even t. Stil l, ther e are certain condit ions that rem ain the same. DIVIN G INT O P URE POTENTIAL How to Navigate the Field of Every thing 1. The deep er y ou go, the mor e power is avai labl e to chang e things. 2. Reali ty flows from more subtle reg ions to m ore gro ss ones. 3. The easi est wa y to chang e an ything is to first go to the subtl est leve l of it, which is awareness. 4. Still silence is the beginning of creativ ity. Once an event starts to vibrate, it has alread y begun to enter the visible world. 5. Creation proceeds b y quantu m leaps. 6. The beginn ing of an even t is si mul taneousl y its ending.

Since possibil ities are infin ite, evolution never ends. 10. The universe corresponds to the nervou s system that is looking at it. Exploring these condi tions is the way you crea te the mean ing of your own life. Let me com press these ten points into a sketch, leaving you to fill it in: The entire universe since the Big Bang behaves the way it does in order to confor m to the human nervous system. If we could experienc e the cosm os any other way, it would be a different cos mos. The universe is ligh tless to a blind cave fish, which has evolved to exc lude anything visual. The universe has no sound to an amoeba, no taste to a tree, no smel l to a snail. Each creatur e selects its own range of m anifesta tion ac cording to its range of potenti al. The universe is forced to respec t your boundari es. Just as no litera l vision of beaut y can affect a blind cave fish and no sweetness of perfum e entic es a snail, any aspect of life that lies outside your boundaries will not hold meaning for you. You are like a hunter -gatherer searching the forest for food. Unless a plant is edibl e, you pass it by, and thus a forest full of exoti c flora would be empt y to you. The force of evolu tion is infinite, but it can work only with what the observer brings to it. A mind closed off to love, for exam ple, will look out on a loveless world and be immune to any eviden ce of love, while an open mind will look out on that sam e world and find inf inite expressions of love. If our boundaries told the whole stor y, evolut ion could never break through them. This is where quantu m leaps com e in. Ever y observer creat es a version of reality that is bound up in cert ain meanings and ener gies. As long"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"as those mean ings seem valid, the ener gies hold the picture togethe r. But when the observer wants to see something new , meaning coll apses, ener gies combine in a new way, and the world takes a quantu m leap. The leap occurs on the visib le plan e when the switch is “on,” but it was prepared in the invisible dom ain when the switch is “o ff.” Here’ s an exa mple: Our abili ty to read came into being when prehistor ic man develop ed a cerebral cortex, yet no one in the prehistori c world needed to read. If evolution is as rando m as many genet icists argue it is, the abil ity to read should have disappeared a m illion years ago, since its usefulness for s urviva l was zero. But this trait survived for the creature who was emer ging. Consciousness kno ws what is to com e, and it builds into ever y parti cle of creat ion the potenti al not just for one unfolding future but for any future. Nature doesn’ t have to predict what is going to happen on ever y level. It just opens avenues of growth, and then a given creatur e—in this case us— mak es the leap when the time feels right. As long as potenti al is alive, the future can evolve by choice. On severa l occasions, a sharp-e yed person spots a flaw in what I’ve been saying. “You’re contrad icting yourse lf. On the one hand, you clai m that cause and effect go on eternal ly. Now you’re saying that the end is alread y present at the beginning. Whi ch is it?” Well, i t’s both. Tha t doesn’ t see m like a ver y satisf ying ans wer— it cer tain ly makes s harp- eyed cri tics frown. But the universe is using cause and ef fect to get somewher e. When i t wants to take a quantu m leap, cause and effect get molded to the purpose. (Actuall y, you experi ence this ever y second. When you see the color red in your mind’s eye, your brain cells are emitting signals in a precise way. But y ou didn’ t order the m to do that ; the y fell into l ine auto matically with your thought.) In the tangl ed hierarch y, an amoeb a, a snail, a gal axy, a bl ack hole, and a quark are equal ly valid expressions of life. Prehistoric people were as immersed in their real ity as we are in ours, equall y fascina ted by it, and equa lly privil eged to watch real ity unfold. Evolut ion gives each creature exact ly the world that fits its ability to perceiv e. But there is som ething above all else that needs to evolve: the gap. If you aren’ t read y yet to accept that the meaning of life is ever ything, find your own meaning in closing the gap. Fetch the world back from the brink of disaster; steer the future off a collision course with chaos. Dharma, the upholding force in Nature, will support any thought, fee ling, or ac tion that closes the gap because the universe is set up to fuse the observer and the observed. Because you are self-aware, your fate is unity. It has been buil t into your brain as surel y as the abil ity to read was built into the brain of Cro-Magnon man. As the gap closes, modern people will find themse lves merging with higher and lower for ms of lif e. All generat ions of hum anity, fro m the first hom inid to whatever com es aft er us, wil l be seen as one. And then what? I im agine we will take the pic ture of f the wall, de taching ourselves fro m any fixed image. To live from the level of pure existenc e, without the need to be bound by any event in the physical world, is the end of this journe y and the beginn ing of one never before seen. This will be the arriv al of unit y and the fina l stroke of freedo m. CHAN GING YO UR REALITY TO ACCO MMO DA TE THE FO UR TEENTH SECRET The fourteenth secre t is about total understanding. Understanding is not the sam e as think ing. Understand ing is a skill developed in awareness. It’s what you’ve made out of your potent ial. A bab y turns into a toddler by developing the skill of walking, for exa mpl e. This skill represen ts a quantu m leap in the bab y’s awaren ess that reaches into ever y corner of existence : Brain patt erns change ; new sensations arise in the bod y; uncoordinat ed movemen ts beco me coordina ted; the eyes learn to view the world from an upright, forward-m oving perspectiv e; new objects in the environ ment com e within reach ; and from the threshold of the first step, the bab y enters a world of unexplored possibil ities that might culminate in climbing Mount Everest or running a marathon. So it’s not one skil l we are talk ing about but a true quantum leap that leaves no part of the bab y’s reali ty untouch ed. The differen ce between a toddler and a marathon runner is that the leve l of understand ing has deepen ed, not just on one front but for the whole person. Whenev er you perfor m an action, you are actu ally expressing a level of understand ing. In a race, two runners can be com pared in such areas as mental discipl ine, endurance, coordinat ion, time manage ment, balan cing obliga tions and relationships, and so on. When you see how far-"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"reaching awareness real ly is, y ou begin to grasp that nothing is l eft out. Understanding changes the whol e pictur e of reality. Being able to affect your whole reality at once is the essenc e of “simultaneous interdependen t co-arising.” There is no limit to how far your influence can reach but to find that out you must engage life with passion. When you do anything with passion, you express ever y aspect of who you are. Passion releases all the ener gy you posses s. At that momen t you put yourself on the line, for if you throw ever ything you have into a pursuit, your defects and weaknesse s are also exposed. Passion brings up ever ything. This inescapab le fact discourag es m any peopl e, who dislike the nega tive parts of th emselves so m uch, or are so inti midated by them, that they hold their passion in check in the beli ef that life will be made safer . Perhaps it will, but at the sam e time they are greatl y limiting their understand ing of what life can bring. In general terms, there are three leve ls of com mitmen t you can express: 1. Going into a situation onl y far enough to m eet the first rea l obstacl e 2. Going into a situation far enough to conquer som e obstacles 3. Going into a situation to conquer all obstacles Using this model, think about something you passionat ely wanted to do well, whether it’s painting, mounta ineering, writ ing, raising a child, or exc elling in your profes sion. Honestl y asses s where you are in that endeavor . Level 1: “I’m not satisfied with what I’ve acco mplished. Things didn’ t go the way I wanted the m to. Others did a lot better than I have manag ed to. I lost my enthusiasm and got discourag ed. I still keep doing what I have to, but m ostl y I’m skating on the surface. I feel I have mos tly failed. ” Leve l 2: “I’m fair ly satisfied with my acco mplishm ent. I’m not alwa ys at my best but I keep up with the pack. I am count ed on as som eone who knows what they’re doing. I’ve overco me a lot to get to be this good. I feel mos tly like a succ ess.” Leve l 3: “I master ed what I set out to do. People look up to me and consider me the old pro. I know the ins and outs of this whole thing, and I feel deep satisfac tion about that. I rarel y have to think anymore about what’s involved. My intuit ion carri es me along. This area of m y life is a m ajor passion.” Each level of com mitmen t refl ects the understanding you are will ing to achieve. If you didn’ t know human nature, you might suppo se that a single activi ty like pain ting, mounta ineer ing, or writing could be trea ted separate ly, but the whole person is affected because the whole person is being expres sed. (This is why it’s said that you get to kno w yourself on the mount ain or in front of the blank canvas.) Even if you pick a very narrow skill, like running a marathon or cooking, your whole sense of self shifts when you succeed with passion as oppo sed to fail ing or back ing of f. The will ingness to reach inside ever y part of yourself opens the door to total understanding. You place your entire ident ity on the line, not just an isolat ed part. This may sound daunt ing, but actual ly it’s the most natural way to approach any situat ion. When you hold som e part of y ourself in reserve you den y it exposure to lif e; y ou repress its ener gy and keep it from understanding what it needs to know . Imag ine a bab y who wants to walk but has these reservat ions: 1. I don’ t want to look bad. 2. I don’ t want to fa ll down. 3. I don’ t want an yone else to watch me fail. 4. I don’ t want to l ive with the burden of failure."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"5. I don’ t want to expend all my ener gy. 6. I don’ t want an y pain. 7. I want to get things over with as fast as pos sibl e. For a bab y these reserva tions seem absurd. If any of them appli ed, learn ing to walk would never happen, or it would happen tentativel y. The chanc e for mastery could never present itself. Yet as adults we resort to these reservations all the time. We den y ourselves mastery as a result. No one can chang e the fact that all the negativ es of a situation express themselv es the minute the situa tion arises, along with all the positives. There is no escaping the int ernal decisions we’ve m ade. Everyth ing you’ve decided about yourself is in play at this moment. Fortunate ly, these individua l dec isions can be reexa min ed and chang ed. Since all the nega tives are right in front of you, you don’ t have to go searching for them. What peopl e experi ence as obstacles in life are reflec tions of a dec ision to shut out understanding. If you shut out too much understanding, you beco me a vict im, subject to forces that bewilder and overwhel m you. These forces aren’ t blind fat e or m isfortun e; the y are holes in y our awaren ess, the plac es w here you haven’ t been able to look. Toda y, try to look at one of the dec isions that has kept you from total ly engaging in life, which may be included in the list just above. I don’t want to look bad: This decision involves self- image. “Looking good” means preserv ing an image, but images are just frozen pictur es. The y give the most superfi cial impr ession of who you are. Mo st people find it too hard to get past self-i mage. The y fashion a certain look, a certa in way of acting, a cert ain leve l of style, taste, lifest yle, and status that gets assembled into who they think they are. Their self-i mage is appl ied to ever y new situation with only one pos sibl e outco me: The y look either good or bad. Long ago such peopl e decid ed that the y would never look bad if the y could help i t. This decision can be coun tered only by your willingn ess to forget how you look. I’m sure you’ve seen slow- motion films of Olympic runners crossing the finish line, drenched in sweat, their faces distorted with effort, expending ever y last ounce of the mselves. In the ir passion to win they haven’ t the slight est care about how the y look. This gives a clue to your own situation : If you are reall y focused on the proces s at hand, you won’ t consider y our appe arance. Toda y, take the following ideas and follow the m through unti l you understand how th ey appl y to y ou: • Winning doesn ’t have to look good. The two have nothing to do with each other . • Being passionat e about something looks good from the inside, which is where it rea lly counts. • Looking good fro m the inside isn’ t an i mage. It ’s a feel ing of satisfac tion. • You won’ t be sat isfied as long as image is on y our mind. I don’t want to fall down: This decision revolv es around failure, which in turn revolv es around judg men t. In the field of paint ing, ever y mas terpie ce is prec eded by a sketch. Som etimes these sketches amount to a few rough scribbl es; sometimes they requir e years and dozens of tries. Did the paint er fail when he made a sketch? No, bec ause it takes stages of deve lopmen t to mas ter a skill. If you judge your earl y efforts to be failures, you are putt ing y ourself at odds with a natur al proces s."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":" People who are afraid to fall down usuall y were ridicu led or hum iliated in the past. This is one area where parents pass on negat ive judgm ents with terribl e effect—fail ing is som ething you inher it from someone who discouraged you. Fear gets attached to failur e by connec ting it to sense of self. “Falling down means I’m worth less.” Next to looking bad, the second most crippling mental reserva tion is fear of fall ing down and feeling like a worthless person. Toda y, face yourself honestl y and confront how much of this fear is inside you. The degre e to which you judge yourse lf is the degree to which you need to hea l. Most people say they hate to fail, but behind the word hate can be a wide range of emotions, from devastat ing collapse of the self to mild anno yance at not doing your best. You can sense w here you belong on the scale. Give y ourself a rating: • I feel devasta ted when I fail. I can’ t shake the feeling for days, and when I look back at my biggest failings I relive how intense th e hu miliation was. • I feel bad enough when I fail that I usuall y walk awa y. It takes a lot for me to get back on the horse, but eventua lly I will. It’ s a ma tter of pride and self-respec t. • I take failure in stride because it’s more impor tant to acco mplish what I want to do. I learn from my failures. There’ s something posit ive in ever y setback. If y ou can l earn fro m your mis takes y ou haven’ t fail ed. • I don’ t think in terms of winning and losing. I stay centered and watch how I perfor m in any situation. Each respon se shows me a new aspec t of myself. I want to understand ever ything, and from that perspec tive each experien ce is l ike turning a new page in the book of evolution. Having asses sed where you stand, develop a progra m for change tha t is suitab le to that stage. First, people at this level are oversensit ive to setbacks and tak e the m so personall y that the y keep reopening old wounds. If this is you, go back to the basics. Find something very minor to acco mplish, such as making an omelet or jogging around the block. Set aside time to do this activi ty, and as you are engaged in it, feel what it’s like to succeed. Be like a good parent and praise yourself. If things go a bit wrong, tell yourself that it’s all right. You need to reform at how y ou fee l about setting a goal and reaching it. Inside you there is a discouraging voice that you notice too quick ly and give too much credenc e to. Slowl y develop a connect ion to the voic e of encourag ement. That is also inside you but has been drowned out by the voice of criti cism . Graduall y incr ease the chal lenges you are able to face. Go from making an omelet for yourse lf to making one for someon e else. Feel what it’s like to be praised. Absorb the fact that you deserve this praise. Don’ t co mpar e yourself to anyone else— you are where y ou are and nowhere else. Keep reinforc ing y our succ esse s. At least once ever y day, do som ething that looks like a success in your eyes and that earns you praise from either yourself or someon e else. Be sure that the external praise is sincere. It will take time, but you will notice after a while that the voice of encour age men t inside you is beginning to grow . You will learn to rely on it, and you will co me to understand tha t it is right about you. Second, people at this level feel bad enough about fall ing down that they often walk awa y from new chall enges, yet they don’ t feel so bad that they are devasta ted. If this is you, you need more motivation bec ause"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"you are on the cusp of wanting to win but are reluctan t to risk failure. You could tip one way or the othe r. To increase your motivation, you can join a team or find a coach. Team spirit will help you override the discouraging voices inside you. A coach will keep you focused so that walking awa y is not an option. Pick a level of activit y that won’t overtax your self-confiden ce. It’s more import ant to interna lize the elements of succ ess than to conquer a big challeng e. A team doesn’ t have to mean sports—find any group that has esprit de corps. It could be a jazz band, a volunteer group, or a poli tical part y. Ext ernal support will help you over your interna l hurdles. You will come to understand that those hurdles aren’ t moun tains; they can be whitt led down into s mall peaks of achieve ment. Third, peopl e at this leve l are mor e encourag ed by success than discouraged by failure. The y have positiv e motivation in good suppl y. If this is you, you may succeed for a long time but eventu ally find that external rewards are no longer satisf ying. You need to set a com pletel y internal goa l for yourself in order to grow . Among the most valuabl e internal goals are learning to be more inti mate, learn ing to serve others without reward, and learning about the depths of spiritu ality. Aim to gain more understanding of yourse lf without any outside acco mplish men t. Over time, the distinc tion between success and failure will begin to soften. You will start to see that ever ything you’v e ever done has been about the unfold ing of yourself to yourself. The grea test satisfact ions in lif e co me about when th at unfold ing is the onl y thing you need. Fourth, people at this level have conquer ed failur e. The y enjoy ever y twist and turn in life, being satisfied with experien ce of ever y kind. If this is you, aim to deepen your mas tery. Your rem aining obstacles are subtle and belong at the leve l of ego. You still bel ieve tha t an isola ted self is having these exper iences. Aim for detach ment and expansion beyond this li mited self. For y ou, the deepest spiri tual texts and a personal co mmitment to one of the four paths will bring great sat isfaction. I don’t want any one else to watch me fail: This decision revolves around shame. Sham e is the internal ized fear of the opin ion of others. Their disapproval beco mes your sham e. The cliché that peopl e from the East cannot bear to “lose face” refers to sham e, which can be a powerful social force. The answer to sha me isn’ t to beco me sha meless in your behavior . Man y people try that solut ion as teen agers, hoping that their intense self- consciousness can be overco me by externa l acts of bravado, like joyriding or dres sing outl andishl y. If you easil y feel asha med, y ou’ve m ade an in ternal decision that needs to be chang ed. First, real ize that what others think about you is often depend ent on whether your actions are good or bad in their eyes. Social judg men t is inescap able, and we are all affected by it. However , others will try to shame you through word s, tone of voice, and behavior . Stand aside from your own situation and watch how this works. Read a tablo id or watch a celebr ity gossip show . Be aware of the constant strea m of insinuation and judg men t. Get comfor tabl e with the fact that such treat ment of others exists. You aren’ t here to change it, only to beco me aware of ho w it work s. Second, withdraw from shaming others. This behavior is a disguise for you. You think that if you gos sip, tear people down, try to look super ior, or in any other way go on the attack, you will find protect ion from your own vulnerabi lity. In real ity, all you are doing is immersing yourse lf in the cultur e of sham e. Step awa y; you can’ t afford to be th ere an y longer . Third, find ways to earn praise that makes you feel like a good person. This is different from praise for what you acco mplish. You no doubt can do many things tha t would get somebod y else to say you did a good job. But what you lack is praise that hea ls your sense of shame. That can come only when emotions are at stake. You need to feel th e warm th of s omeon e else’ s gratitud e; y ou need to see ad mirat ion for y ou in somebod y’s eyes. I’d suggest service to the poor , the elder ly, or the sick. Devote som e time in a volun teer progra m to help the need y in any way that you defin e that term. Until you reconnect on the basis of love, with no hint of personal crit icis m, you won’t be able to separate yourse lf fro m fee lings of sham e. Idon’twanttolive witht heburdenof failur e: This decision revolves around guilt. Guilt is the intern al knowledge of wrongdoing. As such, it has its place as a health y reminder from your consci ence. But when guil t gets atta ched to the wrong thing, it can be destruct ive and unhealth y. Guilty people suffer most from the inab ility to tell thoughts from deeds. The y are burdened by things that are pure ly mental rather than actions in the world. Som etimes this is called “sinning in your hear t.” Whatever name you give to it, guil t makes you feel like a"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"failure because of y our horrible past. Guilty peop le don’ t want to face new chall enges for fear that when they fail, they will feel more guilty, adding to the burden of the past. To them this sounds reasonabl e, but in actua lity, guilt itself is extre mely unreasonable. As with sha me, you can break guilt down into its irration al co mponents: • Guilt doesn’ t ac curat ely measur e good and bad. It can m ake y ou suf fer for triv ial reason s. • Guilt is a blanket that tries to cover ever ything. It makes you feel guil ty about people and things that have no bearing on y our guilt y actions exc ept that th ey happen to be in th e vicin ity. • Guilt makes you feel overl y responsible. You believe you caused bad things to happen that in truth had nothing to do with y ou. • Guilt is prejudiced. It finds y ou wrong all the t ime without an y chance of reprieve. When you understand these four things you can begin to appl y them to yourself. Don ’t try to force guilt to go awa y. Have your guilt y reaction, let it be what it is, but then ask yourself: “Did I reall y do something bad?” “Would I conde mn someone else who did the sa me thing?” “ Did I do the best I could under the c ircu mstan ces?” These questions help you get a more objective sense of good and bad. If you find yourse lf in doubt, seek the opinion of a nonguilt y, nonconde mning person. “Who did I actual ly hurt ?” Be spec ific ; don ’t let guilt be a blanket. You may find that you’ve never real ly hurt anyone. If you still think you have, go to the person and ask how he or she feels. Discuss your actions. Try to reach the point where you can ask forgiven ess. When it is given, accep t it as genuine. Write the forgiveness down as a mental note. Whenever your guilt y voice accuses you again, hold up the piece of paper that proves you’ve been forgiven, saying, “See? It doesn’ t matter how you try and make me feel. The person I actual ly harm ed doesn ’t care an ymore.” “Am I reall y responsible here? What part did I real ly play? Were my actions a smal l part of the situa tion or a big part ?” You can be respon sibl e only for the actions you took or failed to take. Be spec ific. Deta il those actions to yourse lf; don ’t exaggerat e the m and don’ t fall for the irrat ional notion that just by being ther e you are tota lly responsible. Man y fam ily situat ions immerse us in a gener al sense of shared guilt, but if you are spec ific and narro w your responsibi lity to what you actual ly said and did, not what others around you said and did, you can dif fuse the guilt trip of being responsible for ever ything. “What good things have I done to aton e for the bad ones ? When will I have done enough to let go? Am I read y to forgive myself?” All bad actions have their limit, after which you are forgiven and repri eved from guilt. But as we’ve seen, the inner voice of guilt is prejudiced— you are guilty the momen t you step into the courtroo m and will rem ain so forever . Take any guilty action and write down the day you will be forgiven. Do ever ything you can to atone for your bad action, and when the day of release arrives, take your pardon and walk awa y. No heinous action deserves conde mna tion forever; don’ t buy into the prejudic e that would hold you responsible for even y our m ost venial sin s year after year. I don’t want to expend all my energ y: This decision revolv es around a beli ef that ener gy, like the money in your bank accoun t, is limited. Some peopl e who don’ t want to spend much ener gy avoid new chal lenges out of"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"lazin ess, but that is mos tly a disguise for deeper issues. It’s certa inly true that ener gy is limited, but if you have ever com mitted yourself passionate ly to anything, you’v e found that the more ener gy you devote to it, the mor e you have. Passion replen ishes itself. What drains ener gy, strangel y enough, is the act of holding back. The m ore you conserve y our ener gy, the m ore narrow beco me the chann els through which it can flow . People who are afraid to love, for exam ple, wind up constrict ing love’ s expression. The y feel tight in the heart rather than expanded; loving words stick in their throats; they find it awkward to make even small loving gestures. Tightness develops fear of expansion, and thus the snake keeps eating its own tail: The less ener gy you spend, the less you have to spend. Here are a few steps that can cause the channe ls of ener gy to expand: • Learn to give. When you feel most like hoarding, turn to som eone in need and offer som e of what you possess in abundanc e. This doesn’ t have to be mone y or good s. You can give time and attent ion, which actual ly will do m uch m ore to open y our channe ls of ener gy than giving away cash. • Be generous. This means generous in praise and apprecia tion even more than generous with your mone y. Most people hunger for praise and get much less than they deserve. Be the first to notice when someon e has done well. Apprecia te from a full heart and not just with formul aic words. Praise in detai l, showing the other person that you actua lly paid attention to what he or s he acco mpl ished. Meet the person with your gaze and sta y connect ed as y ou praise. • Follow your passion. Som e area in your life makes you want to spend all your ener gy there. For m ost peopl e, there’ s a built- in inhibi tion about going too far, however , so they don ’t really spend themselves even in those areas. Be willing to go the limit, and then go a bit further . If you like to hike, set your sights on a moun tain and conquer it. If you like to write, start and finish a book. The point is not to force yourself but to prove how much ener gy is real ly ther e. Ener gy is the carri er of awareness; it allow s awaren ess to com e out into the world. By devoting mo re ener gy to an y endeavor you incre ase the reward of understanding that wil l co me to y ou. I don’t want any pain: This decision revolves around several issues, all having to do with psychologic al rather than physical pain. The first issue is suffering in the past. People who have suffered without being able to find healing have a grea t aversion to any new possibil ity of pain. Another issue is weaknes s. If pain has defea ted someone in the past, the prospect of mor e pain brings up fear of getting even weaker . Finall y, there is the issue of vulnerabi lity. Pain makes us feel exposed and more prone to further pain than if we remained invu lnerabl e. All these issues run deep, and it’s rare to find anyone who is immun e to them . As alwa ys, ther e are degrees of sensitivi ty here. Pain is neutra l in the cos mic design. In the material world, pain motiva tes us negativ ely whil e pleasure motivates us positive ly. Learning to be free means tha t your act ions don’ t depend on throwing either switch. No chall enge is grea ter, given that all of us are deepl y attached to the cycle of pleasure and pain. Onl y by reaching the state of witnessing can you observe how uncom fortab le you feel when either pleasure or pain drives you onward. I want to get things over with as fast as possible: This decision revolv es around impatien ce. When your mind is restless and disor ganiz ed, you can’ t help but be impa tien t. You lack the atten tion span need ed for taking time and being patien t. People who hold back because they can’ t pay enough atten tion are also deprived of new chall enges.

Secret #15 EVER YTHIN G IS PURE ESSENCE AT LAST, EVER Y LAYER OF THE ONI ON has been pee led awa y. We come face to face with the indescribab le, th e secret at the core of l ife. Yet words have al most reached their limit. What do you have when you find yourself facing the indescribab le? You can only try with inad equat e word s to describe it. The mind can’ t help itself. Used to putt ing ever ything into a thought, it cannot grasp something beyond thought. We each draw a world of line, form, and color using invisible ink. Our instru ment is no more than a speck of consciousness, like a pencil point mov ing across a blank piece of paper . Yet ever ything pours out of that single point. Could anything be more mysterious and at the sam e time more miraculous ? A point infini tely smal ler than a pencil point draws the shape of the universe. That poin t is made of essence, or the purest form of Being. Essence is the ultimate mystery because it manag es to do three things at once: It conce ives ever ything in existence. It turns what i t has i mag ined in to real ity. It enters that reali ty and keeps i t alive."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":" Right now y ou are also perform ing these thre e act ivit ies. Before any-thing happens to y ou it is conceiv ed in th e imagination— that is, in the state where wisps of images and desires are born. These images then unfold into expressed objects and events. Whi le that happens you enter the event sub jective ly, which means you absorb it into your nervous system. The sim plest way to describe this thre e-part act of creation is to say that you imag ine a pictur e, then you paint it and finall y step inside. All that is requ ired to find the essence of life is to step outside the picture and see yourself. You won’t see a person or even a soul, just a speck of awareness—the point that is produc ing the most lovel y, appal ling, mundane, holy, astonishing, ordinar y, and marvelous pictures. But even in using these word s, I have fallen into the temptation of trying to describe the indescribab le. Let me throw ever y image awa y and say the simp lest things that are true: I exist, I am aware, I crea te. These are the three quali ties of essence that perm eate the universe. With ever y unreal aspect of yourself stripped away, only essence rem ains. Once you realiz e that essence is the real you, the golden door opens. Essenc e is precious because it is the stuf f from which the soul is made. If you could keep holding on to essenc e while stepping back into the picture you create, you would be living from the level of the soul at ever y mo ment. But a huge difficul ty arises that keeps the golden door shut: Nothing isn’t essenc e. When you reduce the one reali ty to its essence, ever y quali ty disappears. Now a tree, a horse, a cloud, and a human being are the sam e. Physical dimensions also disappear . The time elapsed between any two events is now zero ; the spac e between any two objects is zero. L ight and dark no longer exist. Co mpl ete fullness and utt er e mpt iness are the sam e. In other word s, at the very moment you think you have the secret to ever ything, you look down to find that your hands are empty. This is a part icular ly disturbing outco me for those who trave l the spiritual path to find God. Unless you define God as essence, he will vanish also. But in India, there is a strong tradit ion that puts essenc e far above a personal god. One of the great est modern spiritua l teachers, Nisar gadatt a Maharaj, made no concessions on this point. He declar ed himse lf—and all other people—to be pure essence. As a result, he met with a good dea l of cont entious opposit ion. Here’ s a t ypical interch ange fro m a skeptic al visi tor to Maharaj: Q: Did God crea te the earth for y ou? A: God is m y devotee and did a ll th is for me . Q: Is there no god apart from you? A: How can there be? “ I am” is the root, God is the tree. Whom am I to worship, and what for? Q: Are y ou the devotee or the object of devotion? A: Neithe r. I a m devotion itself. You can feel the baffled frustra tion in the questione r’s voice, and who can blame him? The path to unit y is so different from what is taugh t in organ ized religion that it bends the mind. Maharaj used to regularl y announce that we were not crea ted for God, God was created for us. By which he meant that essence, being invisibl e, had to crea te an almigh ty projection to be worshipped. B y itself, essence has no qualit ies; ther e is nothing to hold on to. Essenc e does a vanishing act because i t’s not an ything y ou can feel or think about. Since being al ive consists of feeling and think ing, how is essence going to be of any use? At the most superfic ial level, essenc e is not useful because differenc es still hold your attention. Let’s say that you want to be happ y rath er than unhapp y, rich"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"rather than poor , good rath er than evil. None of these distin ctions matters to your essenc e. Essence works with only three things: It exists, it creat es, it is a ware. A life without differenc es sounds compl etely unliv able, and yet there is a docum ent that talks about essenc e in a matter-of-fact way, suggesting that somebod y has figured out how to live from this leve l. The docu ment, kno wn as the Yoga Vashistha, has m any strange things to offer. Yoga we know m eans “unit y,” and Vashistha is the nam e of the author; therefor e, in San skrit the title means “Vashistha’ s version of unity.” No one has offered proof that a person by this name ever lived—th e text itself is many centur ies old—but Vashistha’ s version of unit y stands as a unique work. I believe it is the furthest stretch the human nervou s system has ever taken toward being aware of existen ce i tself. Som e typical observa tions b y Vashistha quickl y give y ou the flavor of his vi ewpoint on l ife: In the infini te consciousness universes com e and go like parti cles of dust in a bea m of sunlight that shines through a hole in the roof. Death is ever keeping a watch over our life. All objects are experi enced in the subject and nowhere else. Whole worlds arise and fall like ripples in the ocean. Vashistha ’s teaching has a reputat ion for being one of the most difficult, abstrac t texts in the spiritua l canon, and therefore not for beg inners. I read him much more simpl y as the voice of essenc e. Even from a handful of sayings, some genera l themes emerge clear ly. Vashisth a considers the universe to be imper manent and fleeting. He observes that death is inescapab ly linked to life. He uses subject ive awareness as the true measure of what’s real, com pared to which the ma terial world is like a puf f of air . As you keep reading, these themes get elabora ted hundreds of times over with such total convic tion that the reader becom es mesmerized. The senten ces sound arcane, sometimes inconce ivabl e, but then that is the poin t— this is lif e co mpressed in to ideas as den se as dia monds: Whatever the m ind thinks of, th at alon e it sees. What peopl e ca ll fat e or divin e will is nothing oth er than action from the past act ing upon itse lf. Even as m otion is inher ent in air, ma nifesta tion is inherent in consciousness. As you pore over his word s, it’s easy to fall into a kind of trance in which the visible world blows away like a feathe r. The effect isn’ t to inspir e or uplif t: Vashistha offers absolut ely no consola tion. Nothing matters to him except essenc e, and therefore he is the ultimate teacher on the subject of getting real. Get ting real is the goal of this book, too, and therefore I’ve tried to disti ll Vashistha’ s advi ce on how to liv e if you are tota lly serious about waking up fro m unrea lity. He describes four condi tions tha t must exist if y ou want to find rea lity: Content ment"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":" Inquir y Self-awareness Strength Four ordinar y, somewha t innocuous words. What did he mean by them, this sage who knew essence perhaps better than anyone who ever liv ed? Content ment: This is the qual ity of restfuln ess in the mind. Som eone who is cont ent exists without doubt and fear . Doubt is a constant rem inder that there is no answer to the mystery of life, or that all answers will turn out to be untrustworth y. Fear is a constan t reminder that you can be hurt. As long as either of these beli efs exists in your mind, rest ing easy in yourself is impossible. So con tent ment must be won on the level where doubt and fear have been defe ated. Inquir y: To get real, you have to question the unreal over and over unti l it disappears. This process is a kind of peeling awa y. You look at som ething that seems reliabl e and trustworth y, and if it betr ays your trust, you say, “No, this isn’ t it,” and throw it awa y. The next thing that asks for your trust also gets exa mined, and if it proves unreliab le, you peel it awa y as well. Layer by layer, you keep inquir ing until you reach something that is com pletely trustworth y, and that thing m ust be real. Self-Awarenes s: This qualit y tells you where to conduc t your inquir y—no t outside in the material world, but in yourse lf. Turning inward doesn’ t happen as a single step. For ever y chall enge there are alwa ys two solut ions— inner and outer . Onl y by working through ever y reason to look outward are you left with why you should look inward. Strength: Because you are look ing inward, no one from the outside can help you. This implies a kind of isolat ion and solitud e that only the strong can accept. Streng th is not a given; it’s not that the strong are born different from the weak. Your inner strength grows from experi ence. The first stages of look ing inward give you a hint that you can get real, and with that bit of added strength you move forward. You grow in resolv e and certa inty. You test what you find out until it feels secure. Step by step you discover that strength is built from experien ce. The journe y itself m akes y ou strong. Vashistha has almost nothing else to say about ever yday matters. No one has to start living a certain way or stop living a certain way in order to get real. Vashistha’ s viewpoint is tota lly accep ting: He is cont ent to allow life to unfold. “For only as long as one invests any object with reali ty,” he says, “that bondage lasts; once that notion goes, with it goes bondage.” In other words, unrea lity has to melt awa y on its own. Until it does, y ou can be rich or poor , happ y or sad, cert ain or plagu ed with doubt, as y our karm a dicta tes. Vashistha fee ls inf init e toleranc e because “the unrea l has no ex istence and the real wil l never stop exist ing.” He feels infin itely serene because “con sciousnes s is omnipr esent, pure, tranquil, omnipot ent.” Yet it’s not for these deep thoughts that I hold Vashisth a to be unique. His speci al gift lies in jabs of truth that are as sharp as salt on the tongue : “The universe is one long drea m. The ego- sense, along with the fanc y that ther e are other peopl e, is as unreal as an ything in a drea m.” When I see Vashistha in my mind’s eye, I envision a picnic where ever yone has fallen asleep under the shade of an old spreading beech tree, done in by too much food and pleasure and play. Onl y one person is sitting up, awake and alert, wait ing for the others to end their nap. Everyone else is asleep. There is no escap ing that jab of truth. Vashistha know s he is alone, but he isn’ t a pessi mis t. His solitar y watch hasn’ t calloused over his love for other people. Essence is love. Not the love of passing emot ion or the love that gets attach ed to one person but the sheer love of being here. By com parison, the emotional kind of love is confin ed, doubtful, full of fear , and driven b y drea ms that never get full y realiz ed. In pure essence, Vashisth a kne w that he had found the secre t of universa l happiness. That secre t has three parts: freedo m from all limitation, complet e knowledge of creat ion, and immorta lity. Vashistha found all three. Tha t such a condit ion is possible proves the existen ce of love, since noth ing more could be wished for. Until the"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"moment when these three things are achi eved, ever y other awaken ing is false ; the whole universe exists in the drea m state, th e pursuit of a cosm ic de lusion. This delusion has now been presen ted to you in full. It consists of separation, frag men tation, the loss of wholeness. Ther e m ust be a final “No!” tha t refuses to part icipa te in the de lusion, and Vashistha has said it, loud and clea r. He is often the one teacher I reach for when I imagine that I am in troubl e. Reading his words, I can feel myself rising to his leve l, not fully and not perm anen tly, but with enough validi ty that I come awa y feel ing reassured. There are times when I want CNN to stop running endless crises in the crawl spac e at the botto m of the te levision screen and start running th ese word s inste ad so that people can be re minded abou t what’ s rea l: Whatever is in the mind is l ike a city in the c louds. The e mer gence of this world is no m ore than thoughts com ing in to m anifestat ion. From the inf init e consciousness we have crea ted each other in our i magina tion. As long as ther e is “you” and an “I,” there is no liber ation. Dear ones, we are all cos mic consciousnes s assuming indiv idual form. It’s nearl y impossible perhaps to tak e these noble senti ments in to the rough and tu mbl e of ever yday life, but the basic thing that Vashistha wants us to do is to live from essence—and that is workab le. The teacher I mentioned before, Nisargad atta Maharaj, lived such a life. As a young man he was raised on a farm to walk behind a pair of oxen pull ing a plow . But spiritua lity intrigued him and he made his way to a guru who gave him one piece of advice : “You are the unborn and und ying ‘I am.’ Rem ember that, and if your mind wanders from this truth, bring it back.” The young Maharaj went awa y, need ing no more visits to gurus, and found his essenc e with that sim ple teach ing. The most exa lted state of awareness com es down to realizing how com monpl ace it actual ly is to live a cosmic life. We do it all the time. One only has to listen to how matter-of-fac tly Vashistha looks around and sees infini ty in ever y direc tion. His is the teach ing to keep by your bed when you want to do something other than fall asleep: To a suffering person, a night is an epoch. To a reve ler, a night passe s like a moment. In a drea m, a moment is no differen t from an epoch. But to the sage, whose consciousness has overcom e all limitations, ther e is no day or night. As one turns awa y from the notion of “I” and “the w orld, ” one finds lib erat ion. CHAN GING YO UR REALITY TO ACCO MMO DA TE THE FIFTEENTH SECRET The fifteen th lesson is about unit y. As a young man, I was driven to reach as far as I could, but over time I began to grasp that unity is not an achiev ement one can set for oneself in the way one can set winning a gam e or finding the perfect wife or rising to the top of a profession. Unity is more like music. Bach might visit a kinder gart en class and inspir e the children with hope that they can all be like him. In real ity, few children will ever grow up with Bach ’s genius for musi c. But they don ’t have to. Mu sic is a glorious pursuit on its own, com paring yourse lf to no one. Ever y moment of musi c making brings delight on its own, not just as a step up the m oun tain toward the high est peak. Spiri tuali ty can bring delight at ever y moment—or at least ever y day—if it is pursued with the four things in mind th at Vashisth a taught. Let ’s review the m aga in, this t ime as the y might be app lied to our own lives. Content ment: Look for a moment of conten tmen t ever y day. You have a right to it because, in the cos mic"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"design, you are safe and cared for. Be cont ent not with your lot in life but with being here in the flow of life. The glori es of creat ion are in your very cells; you are made of the same mindstuf f as the angels, the stars, and God hi mself. Inquir y: Don’ t let a day go by withou t asking who you are. Understand ing is a skill, and like all skills it must be coaxed into existence. To understand who you are means returning again and again to the question, Who am I? Each time you return you are allowing a new ingred ient to enter your awareness. Ever y day is filled with the potent ial for expanding your awaren ess, and although each new addit ion may seem tiny, overal l the accu mulation will be great. It may take thousands of days to know who you are; it takes only one day to quit asking. Don ’t let toda y be that da y. Self-a wareness: Never forget that you are not in the world; the world is in you. Whatever you need to kno w about existenc e will arise nowhere outside yourself. When anything happens to you, take the experi ence inward. Creat ion is set up to bring you constant hints and clues about your role as a co-creato r. Be aware of them; absorb the m. Your soul is m etaboli zing experienc e as surel y as y our bod y is m etabol izing food. Strength: No one will ever be able to say that walking the spiritua l path is the easiest thing in the world—or the hardest. The birth of the new is too intimately tied to the death of the old. Joy comes on the heels of sorrow , as it must if birth and death are merged. Don’ t expect one or the other toda y. Use your strength to meet whatever is com ing your way. Be as com mitted and passionate about spiri tual ity as you can be. Strength is the foundation for pas sion, and y ou were designed to survive and thr ive no m atter how life unfolds. Be strong toda y in tha t knowledge. Epilogu e SECO ND BIR TH AT A CER TAIN POI NT life has no more secrets to reveal. You live as if there is one reality, and in return it repa ys you richl y. The fear born of duali ty is gone, repl aced by an unshakable content ment. Awareness has beco me full y aware of itself. When we reach this stage of freedom , life starts over , which is why enligh tenment is rightl y call ed a second birth. Growing up in India, I never met an enlight ened person. My family was deep ly religious, parti cular ly on my mother’s side. But when I was born the whole countr y was caugh t up in the turmoi l of a politi cal birth, as the English dec amped overnight and left us to suffer our birth pangs alon e. These were terrible times : Riot ing and wholesale killing raged unche cked, as rel igious into leranc e led to viol ence throughout North India. When Mahat ma Gandhi was assa ssina ted by a religious fana tic on Januar y 30, 1948, the killer claimed another vict im. A thread. The tradi tiona l costum e of the Brahm in caste inc luded a double thread worn over the shoulder . There were many evils in the caste system, but in my mind the double thread symbolized a deep truth—that enligh tenmen t was possibl e. Until modern times, ever yone in India knew that the double thread was the prom ise of a second birth. It stood for a lega cy going back before memory began. Toda y, enligh tenment is no longer the goal of life, not even in India. The most that any teacher can do is to open the door again; he can answer three quest ions in the age-old wa y: • Who am I? You are th e tota lity of the universe act ing through a hum an nervous s ystem. • Where did I come fr om? You ca me fro m a source that wa s never born and will never die. • Why am I he re? To crea te th e world in ever y mo ment."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":" To gain this knowledge for oneself is like being pushed through the birth can al again. You may utter a cry of surprise—and perhaps of shock and pain—at find ing yourself in an unknown world. Once you accep t this second birth, you cont inue to have thoughts and feelings, but now they are soft impu lses aga inst a background of silent awareness, faint ripples tha t rise and fall without disturbing the oce an of being. I can’ t help feel ing that enligh tenment was never India’ s prize to posses s—or any culture’ s. The second birth com es from looking at life as it alread y is, seeing it from the still point inside. To the degree that anyone does that, they are enlighten ed. The universe goes to the still point in order to creat e time and space. You go ther e to fetch a word or the memory of a face or the scent of a rose. At this very moment, the world is blossom ing into its infin ite variet y before fal ling silent in am azemen t at the m iracle it has j ust achi eved.
