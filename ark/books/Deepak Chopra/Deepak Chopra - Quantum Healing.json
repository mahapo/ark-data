The new edition has come about, after aH, only because more and more people are eager to discover the principIes that underlie physical reality and that create our everyday environmenr~in particular the \"environ­ menr\" of our own bodies. Quantum Healing provides an historical over­ view of how these principIes have come to be understood by both Westem science and by Ayurveda, the ancienr life science of India. Per­ haps even more important, the book looks forward ro offer a glimpse of how insights from each of these traditions can come together to bendit everyone's well-being. I'm proud that earlier editions of Quantum Healing have helped ro create awareness of mind-body medicine, and I'm very pleased that this new edition is now available in response ro the growing interest in mind-body perspectives on human health. Prom a personal standpoint, the new edition provides an opportunity to show how my own views have evolved in a number of areas. Change is a defining characteristic of the universe, which, needless ro say, includes people, ideas, and books. What has not changed~indeed, 1 am more firm in this than ever before-is my belief that consciousness creates reality . . . that expectation decisively influences outcome . . . and that awareness, attenrion, and intention should be as much a part of health care as drugs, radiaríon, and surgery. There are heartening signs that Western medicine, after years of resis­ tance, is beginning to accept and incorporate these ideas. In my view this change is coming about because many people are no longer comfort­ able with a purely materialist interpretation of health and illness. Pa­ tients are influencing their physicians ro become more familiar with mind-body concepts, and physicians in tum are seeing the benefits that these approaches can bring to their patienrs. 1 believe this is one of the most remarkable and positive developments in contemporary medicine. 1 am confidenr that you, as a reader of this book, will find a great deal of illuminating information. But information is only one aspect of Quan­ tum Healing. My greater hope ís that you will also find inspiration~to look with wonder at the universe that is around you and withín you, and ro realize that you are central to its creatíon, perhaps more so than you ever dreamed."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"A Personal Introduction \"1 have a Chinese patient who is in the terminal stages of cancer in the nasal cavity. His face has been affected, and he is in pain most of the time. But he is also a doctor. 1 think he should hear this.\" 1 nodded from the other side of the desk. lt was a late October day in Tokyo in 1987. 1 was paying a visit to a Japanese cancer specialist who might help me in testing a new theory. It had to do with one of medi­ cine's great mysteries, the healing process. At that stage 1 had not yet hit upon the name \"quantum healing,\" but that was what we had been discussing for more than an hour. The two of us got up and headed toward the wards. As we walked, 1 caught glimpses of perfectly tended Zen gardens that the hospital had installed outside. Nearby, the children were asleep in their ward, so we walked quietly for a momento At the private rooms, the Japanese doctor stopped, found the right door, and let me go in first. \"Dr. Liang,\" he said, \"do you have a few minutes?\" The room was in shadow. A man in his mid-forties, abour my age, was lying in bed. He turned his head wearily as we walked in. The three of us had several things in common-we were all from the East and had left home ro train in advanced Western medicine. Between us we had practiced Out specializations for fifty years. Bur the man in the bed was the only one who would be dead in a month. A Taiwanese cardiologist, he had been diagnosed with nasopharyngeal cancer less than ayear before. Now large bandages came up almost to his eyes. It was a 1"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"QUANTUM HEALING difficult moment, meeting him. As 1 said hello, 1 didn't lower my gaze, but Dr. Liang lowered his. \"We've come to talk a little,\" the Japanese doctor murmured. \"Are you too tired?\" The man in the bed made a polite gesture, and we pulled up chairs. 1 began to sketch in the main ideas 1 had already told my host. In essence, 1 believed that healing is not primarily a physical process but a mental one. When we saw a bone fracture mend or a malignant tumor regress, we were conditioned as doctors to look at the physical mechanism first and foremost. But the physical mechanism is like a screen. Behind it, 1 said, is something much more abstract, a form of know-how that cannot be seen or touched. And yet that know-how, 1 was convinced, is a powerful force that has not really come under our control. Despite all our efforts to coax the healing process when it falters, medicine cannot explain it. Healing is alive, complex, and holistic. We deal with it on our own limited terms, and it seems to obey our limits. Yet, when something strange happens, as when an advanced cancer suddenly and mysteriously vanishes, medical theory is baffled. Our limits then seem very artificial. In my own practice, several cancer patients have recovered completely after being pronounced incurable and given only a few months to live. 1 didn't think they were miracles; 1 thought they were proof that the mind can go deep enough to change the very patterns that design the body. It can wipe mistakes off the blueprint, so to speak, and destroy any disease-cancer, diabetes, coronary heart disease-that has disturbed the designo The physical basis of science is very solid and, in the eyes of every doctor, extremely convincing. On the other hand, the healing power of the mind is considered dubious. Yet 1 was determined to show that this healing power was a science in its own right. In the months leading up to that day in Tokyo, 1 had devoted myself to studying Ayurveda, the traditional Indian science of life, which originated more than four thou­ sand years ago. Although many Ayurvedic principIes and techniques had 2"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"A PERSONAL INTRODUCTION been aH but forgotten over the centuries, I was convínced they would become an important part of the medicine of the future. Yes, it would come. Indian thought has always been grounded on the conviction that Satya, the truth, alone triumphs. Growing up in India, as I did, does not guarantee that you will learn much about this ancient science. My grandmother used to rub turmeric on our insect bites when I was a child, and she warned us never to eat sour fruit with milk. That was Ayurveda in my house. In general, Ayurveda has been eclipsed by Western scientific medicine, crowded out of its own birthplace by progress. Outside the related cultures of India, Tibet, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, Ayurveda is aH but unknown, although it has lefr a lasting mark. The popular systems of Eastern medicine thar have planted a few roots in the West, such as Chinese acupuncture, were founded on Ayurvedic principIes thousands of years ago. Over the centuries, the original knowledge of Ayurveda has been scattered. Indians who Uve according to traditional values, mostly in the countryside, still tend to follow Ayurvedic practices, but they have sub­ jected them to many different interpretations. Most of these are very partial, even one-eyed. Everyvaidya, or Ayurvedic physician, cites the ancient masters of Ayurveda, such as Charaka and Sushruta, as his au­ thority, but that does not mean that what he prescribes will be the same as the vaidya in the next village. Many Ayurvedic techniques have disappeared outright, and unfortu­ nately these are the very ones that might contribute most to modern medicine. The ancient doctors of India were also great sages, and their cardinal belief was that the body is created out of consciousness. A great yogi or swami would have believed the same thing. Therefore, theirs was a medicine of consciousness, and their way of treating disease pierced the body's matter and went deeper, into the core of mind. When you look at Ayurveda's anatomical charts, you don't see the familiar organs pictured in Grais Anatomy; rather, you find astonishing diagrams of where the mind is flowing as it creates the body. This flow is 3"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"QUANTUM HEALING what Ayurveda treats. Or rather, did treat until this priceless knowledge IJ'-\\..a.u.,-, obscured over time. Until recently, even 1 had assumed that Ayurveda was folk medicine, because all 1 saw of ir were the herbs, diets, exercises, and the incredibly intricate rules for daily life that are just \"in the air\" when one lives in India. But now my interest had come to center on the \"lost\" Ayurveda, and on its ability to cure patients through nonmaterial means. Now that I had beco me familiar with those means, I wanted ro teH people how they worked. That was why I wanted to talk ro interested physicians, such as my contact in Tokyo. Now I was repeating this to aman who was dying in a hospital bed a thousand miles away from home, and who knows how far away from his spiritual ancestry. My words trailed away in the guiet of the shadowy room. Ir was obvious that Dr. Liang was very tired now. He hadn't spoken, but as we got up to leave, he touched my armo \"Let us hope that you are right,\" he said. \"Thank you.\" As we walked back through the wards, I looked again at the tiny Zen gardens outside the windows. Tucked in alcoves not much bigger than a hospital room, each one was a model of devoted care. The clipped yew trees, cut so precisely, looked beautiful in the warm October light. We walked out to the parking lot, and at my car the Japanese doctor and I shook hands warmly. I told him 1 would start testing my new tech­ nigues in America tirst, but 1 would keep him informed every step of the way. Every doctor must make an inner journey, taking his understanding beyond the limits of the physical body and into the heart of a deeper reality. His responsibility is to solve the riddle of life and death.

The most recent began last year when a 32-year-old Indian woman came to see me in my office outside Boston. She sat quietly facing me in a blue silk sari. To keep her composure, she clasped her hands tightly in her lap. Her name was Chitra, she said, and together with her husband, Raman, she ran a neighborhood import store in New York City. A few months earlier, Chitra had noticed a small lump in her left breast that was sensitive to the touch. She underwent surgery to remove it, bur uofortunately the surgeon found that the lump was malignant. When he explored further, he detected that the cancer had spread to her lungs. After removing the diseased breast and a large portio n of tissue around it, Chitra's doctor gave her initial doses of radiation and then placed her 00 intensive chemotherapy. This is standard procedure for treating breast cancer and saves many lives. But the lung cancer was 9"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"QUANTUM HEALING going to be much harder ro treat; it was obvious ro everyone that Chitra was in a very precarious position. Examining her, 1 noticed that she was very anxious. When 1 tried ro reassure her, she surprised me with a touching statement: \"1 don't mind for myself lf 1 have to die, but my husband wi11 be so lonely without me. Sometimes 1 pretend to be asleep and then sit up all night, just thinking about him. 1 know Raman loves me, but after I'm gone, he will start American girls. 1 can't bear ro lose him ro an American girL\" She stopped and looked at me with suffering in her eyes. \"1 know 1 shouldn't say that, but 1 think you understand.\" You do not get used to the sorrow that cancer creates, but 1 felt a deeper sorrow from knowing that time was Chitra's enemy. Por the moment, she sti11 looked healthy. She had even managed ro hide disease from her relatÍves, dreading havíng ro be watched as she wasted away. We both knew it was goíng ro be very bad for her. No one can say that he knows a cure for advanced breast cancer. Conventional therapy had províded all that it could for Chitra. Given that her cancer had already spread to another organ, the statistics said that her chance of surviving for five years was less than 10 percent, even with the most intensive routine of chemotherapy that couId be safely administered. 1 asked her ro start a new coutse of treatments, as prescribed by Ayurveda. Like me, Chitra had grown up in rndia, but had little idea of Ayurveda. Her grandparents' generation was the last to \"believe\" in it, 1 would imagine; roday, every progresslve rndian living in a big city would prefer Western medicine ifhe could afford it. To explain ro Chítra why 1 wanted her seemingly to turn her back on progress, 1 rold her that her cancer was not just a physical disease but a holistic one. Her whole body knew she had cancer and was sufferíng from it; a tissue sample taken from her Iungs would show that malignant cells had mígrated there, while a sample from her liver would be negative. Yet, her liver had the same blood coursing through it, and therefore it plcked up the 10 -----_ ................ _----_..................... ---_ ............... __ .. _----- ---.-----_._­"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"AFTER THE MIRACLE signals of disease that were coming from the lungs. This in turn affected its own functions. Similarly, when she feIr pain in her chest or had to sit down owing to shortness of breath, signals were racing throughout her body, going to and from her brain. Sensing the pain, her brain had to respond to it. The fatigue she was feeling, along with her depression and anxiety, was a brain response that had physical consequences. So ir was wrong to think of her cancer as just an isolated tumor that needed to be destroyed. She had a holistíc disease and for that she needed holistic medicine. The word hol¡stic, which tends to offend orthodox doctors, simply means an approach that includes the mind and body together. I believe Ayurveda does this better than any alternative, although it may not be very apparent on the surface. In fact, many well-publicized mind-body techniques such as hypnosis and biofeedback are far more flashy than Ayurveda. If Chitra had gotten sick at home in Bombay, her grand­ mother might have fixed her sorne special meals, brought home medici­ nal herbs in a brown paper sack from the Ayurvedic pharmacy, and insisted that she stay in bed. Various purgatives and oil massages might be prescríbed to clean the body of toxins generated by the cancer. If there was a spiritual tradition in the family, she would have begun to meditate. In essence, I was going to have her do these same things, with a few additions. There is as yet no scientific reason why any of this should work, except that ir does. Ayurveda has hit on something deep in nature. Its knowledge is rooted not in technology but in wisdom, which I would define as a reliable understanding of the human organism gath­ ered over many centuries. \"1 want you to go to a special clinic outside Boston for a week or two,\" 1 told Chitra. \"Sorne things that will happen to you there will seem highly unusual. You are used to the idea of a hospital as a place with respirators, IV tubes, transfusions, and chemotherapy. By that stan­ dard, what we will do for you at this clinic will seem like nothing. Basically, 1 want to get your body into a deep, deep state of rest.\" Chitra was a trusting person; she agreed ro go. In part, of course, she 11"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"QUANTUM HEALING had no alternative. Modern medicine had done all it could, using the strategy of physical assault on her cancer. The initial advantage of as­ saulting a disease is that you hope to wipe it out physically as soon as possible. The tremendous disadvantage is that the whole body is dam­ aged in the assault on one of its parts. In the case of chemotherapy, is the very real danger that the immune system wiU become so weakened that the door is opened for other cancers to develop in the future. How­ ever, untreated breast cancer is considered deadly, and today's medicine is good at wiping it out over the short runo In aclimate of opinion ruled by fear, people prefer to run the risks of the cure rather than the disease. I referred Chitra to the clinic where I work, in Lancaster, Massachu­ setts. She stayed for a week and received treatments; she also an outpatient program to use at home that included a change of diet, some Ayurvedic herbs, a specific daily routine including simple yoga exercises, and instruction in meditatíon. These measures look on the surface, but underneath they all aimed at bringing her day-to-day exís­ tence to a settled, restful state, building a foundatíon for healing. In Ayurveda, a level of total, deep relaxation is the most important precon­ dition for curing any disorder. The underIying concept is that the body knows how to maintain balance unless thrown off by disease; therefore, if one wants to restore the body's own healing ability, everything should be done to bring it back into balance. It is a very simple norion that has profound consequences. Chitra was also given two special mental tech­ niques rhat went directly to the root of her cancer. (1 will say more about these later.) Chitra followed program faithfully and came back ro see me every six weeks. She al so continued the course of chemotherapy set up by her doctor at home in New York. When we talked about that I said, \"If I could confidently put you on nothing but Ayurveda, I would-the dete­ rioration in your physical state would then be much less. But you came to me a very sick woman, and we know that (he chemotherapy works as 12"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"AFTER THE MIRACLE an outside approach. Let's combine the outer and the inner and hope that they add up to a real cure.\" For almost ayear 1 fo11owed Chitra's progress. She always listened with a trusting attitude, yet as she returned for each visit, it was clear that she was not improving. Her lung X rays were sti11 bad, her short­ ness of breath grew worse, and she began ro look weaker and more dejected as the disease advanced. Her voice took on a note of panie. Finally the day carne when Chitra did not show up for her appointment. I waited out the week and then called her home. The news was not good. Chitra's husband, Raman, told me that she had suddenly developed a high fever and had to be hospitalized over the weekend. For sorne rime her lungs had been seeping fluid into the pleural cavity that surrounds them, and her doctor suspected that an infection had set in. Given her grim prognosis, there was no guarantee that Chitra would ever leave the hospital. Then a very curious thing happened. After a day or two on antibiotics, Chitra's fever went from 104 degrees F. back down ro normal, which puzzled her attending physician. It is very unusual for a high-grade fever to reverse itself so rapidly if the underlying cause is an infection in a terminally i11 patient. Couid there be another cause besides infection? He decided to take chesi: X rays, and the next day Raman called me sounding both exhilarated and confused. \"She doesn't have cancer anymore!\" Raman toid me jubilantly over the telephone. \"What do you mean?\" I asked, taken aback. \"They can't find any cancer cells at all-nothing.\" He was almost unable to contain himself. \"Chitra's oncologist at first was sure that they had X-rayed the wrong patient and wanred to take sorne more pictures, but now he's convinced.\" Overjoyed, relieved, and unable ro explain this sudden stroke of salva­ tion, Raman regarded his wife's recovery as a miracle. When 1 called China in her hospital room, she kept crying into the phone, \"You did ir, Deepak,\" whiie 1 kept insisting, \"No, no, Chitra, you did it.\" 1 had never 13 ----~~ --~------ ~~~~~~--- .. ----- .."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"QUANTUM HEALING anticipated thar such a rapid cure would result from her treatments, either conventional or Ayurvedic. In retrospect, I see that her hígh fever was a kínd of bum-off from the dyíng cancer, a process known as rumor necrosis. But the exact mechanism involved has no explanarion. If there is such a thing as a miraculous cure, this was one, I was certain. Within a few weeks, however, our mutual jubilatíon began to change. Chitra's \"miracle\" wasn't holding. It eroded first within herself: instead of being able to truSt in her inexplicable recovery, she became conflicted, morbídly afraíd that the cancer would return. She called to ask me if she should resume chemotherapy. \"It's been two months since the cancer dísappeared,\" 1 said. \"Does your doctor find any new cancer ceUs?\" \"No,\" Chitra admitted, \"but he thinks thar the chemotherapy cured me and that I should continue with ir.\" I began to feel frustrated. I knew, as did her attending physician, that the particular chemotherapy Chitra had received was not known to pro­ duce sudden, total recoveries of rhis kind, certainly not in advanced cases where the cancer had begun to spread to other sites in the body. Also, it was becoming obvious thar she was being worn down past endurance. The chemotherapy had caused almost constant nausea, and her hair had faUen out in frightening amounts, adding to the shame she felt follow­ ing her breast surgery. All of this compromised the Ayurvedic treat­ ments we were trying. If even higher doses of chemotherapy were given, she would become more depressed, more prone ro infections, and weaker in every way. Yet, at the same time, I did not have a strong enough reason to tell her not to procecd. What if she suffered a relapse in six months and died? \"Go ahead with your chemotherapy,\" I advised, \"but stick with our program, too, okay?\" She For several months more, Chitra remained free of disease, bur she also remained disrurbed and mystified. It seemed that Chitra's cancer was"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"AFTER THE M1RACLE easier to defeat than the sinister doubt that was creeping back into her life, defying her to be well. Chitra's agonizing dilemma is the real starting point of this book. For her to be well again, she needed an explanaríon. What had happened to her? Was her cure a miracle, as she rhought at first, or only a remporary stay of execution, as she carne ro dread? By going deeper inro rhe mínd­ body connection, 1 believe an answer can be found. Research on spontaneous cures of cancer, conducted in both the Unired Sta res and Japan, has shown that just before rhe cure appears, almost every patient experiences a dramatic shift in awareness. He knows thar he will be healed, and he feels rhar rhe force responsíble is insíde himself but not límired to him-ir exrends beyond his personal boundaries, rhroughout all of nature. Suddenly he feels, \"1 am not limited ro my body. All rhar exists around me is part of myself.\" At that moment, such patients apparently jump ro a new level of consciousness rhar prohibits the exisrence of cancer. Then the cancer cells either disappear, lirerally overnight in sorne cases, or at the very least stabilize wirhout damaging the body any further. This leap in consciousness seems to be rhe key. Ir does not have to come in a flash, however. Chitra was cultivaring it deliberately, rhrough her Ayurvedic techniques. Therefore, her ability ro stay ar a higher leve! of awareness was srrikingly correlated with her condition. Somehow she could motívate rhe absence of cancer, but jusr as easily she could rerurn ro it. (I think of this as being líke a violín string whose pitch varies as you slide your finger up and down ir.) The word that comes ro mind when a scientíst thinks of such sudden changes is qttantmn. The word denores a discrete jump from one level of functioníng to a hígher level­ the quantum leap. Quantum is also a technical term, once known only to physicists bur now growing in popular usage.

Borh definitions-rhe discrere jump ro a higher level and rhe irreduc­ ible level of a force-appear ro apply ro certain cases like Chitra's. 1 would like ro introduce rhe term quantum healing to describe whar happened to her. Although the term is new, the process itself is not. There have always been patients who do not follow rhe normal course of healíng. A tiny minoriry, for example, do nor wasre away from cancer; orhers have rumors that grow much more slowly rhan what rhe staristics for their diseases predict. Many cures rhat share mysrerious origins-faith healing, spontaneous remissions, and the effecrive use of placebos, or \"dummy dtugs\"-also poinr toward a quantum leap. Why?

The reason why not everyone manages to take the healing process as far as it can go is that we differ drastically in our ability to mobilize it. We can see this in the way that different people react to disease. A minute fraction, far less than 1 percent, of al! the patients who contract an incurable disease manage to cure themselves. A larger fraction, but still under 5 percent, live much longer than average-this is confirmed in the 2 percent of AIDS patients who have survíved longer than eight years, while the vast majority do not survive beyond two. These findings are not restricted to incurable diseases. Studies have generally shown that only 20 percent of patients with serious but treatable disorders recover with excellent results. That leaves nearly 80 percent who either do not recover or only partially recover. Why is unsuccessful healing so far out of proportion? What marks a survivor as opposed to a non­ survivor? Apparently the successful patients have learned to motivate their own healing, and the most successful have gone much furrher than that. They have found the secret of quantum healing. They are the geniuses of the mínd-body connectíon. Modern medicine cannot even begin to duplicate I their cures, because no cure that relies on drugs or sutgery is so precisely timed, so beautifully coordinated, so benign and free of side effects, so i effortless as theirs. Their ability springs from a level so deep that you cannot go any deeper. If we knew what their brains were doing to motivate their bodies, we would have the basic unit of the healing process in our hands. * * * 17"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"QUANTUM HEALING As yet, medicine has not taken the quantum leap, and the word quantum has no clínical applícation. Because quantum physics works with ultra­ high-speed accelerators, you may think that quantum healing uses radio­ ¡sotopes or X rays. But thar is the opposite of what it means. Quantum healing moves away from external, high-technology methods toward the deepest core of the mind-body system. This core is where healing begins. To go there and learn to prom ore the healing response, you must past all the gros ser levels of rhe body-cells, tissues, organs, and systems -and arrive at the junction point between mind and matter, point where consciousness actually starts to have an effect.

Classic studies going back ro rhe end of \\XTorld War II showed that parients left the Yale Medical School hospital sicker rhan the day they arrived.

A miracle cure, then, simply throws into high relief the need to reexamine sorne of medicine's basic concepts. Our current logic of heal­ ing can be impressive, or at least good enough, as when we apply peni­ cillin to cure an infection, but nature's logic can be awe-inspiring. Many physicians have stood in wonder witnessing such cures as Chitra's with­ out having a due how ro explain them; the standard rerm for them is spontcmeoltS remiHion, a convenient tag that says little more than that the patient recovered by himself. Spontaneous remissions are quite rare­ one study in 1985 estimated that they occur once in every twenty thou­ sand diagnosed cancer cases; sorne specialists believe they are much rarer (fewer than ten per million), but no one knows for sure. Recently 1 spent an evening with a leading oncologist, or cancer specialist, from the Midwest, a doctor who treats thousands of patients every year. 1 asked him if he knew of any spontaneous remissions. He shrugged and said, \"1 feel uncomfortable with that termo 1 have seen tumors completely regress. It's very rare, but it happens.\" Did these regressions sometimes happen rotally by themselves? He admitted that they occasionally did. He thoughr for a moment and mentioned that certain kinds of melanoma-an extremely lethal skin cancer rhat bUs very quickly-are known to disappear by themselves. He couldn't explain why this happened. \"1 don't stop to rhink about 20"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"THE BODY HAS A MIND OF ITS OWN rhese rare incidents,\" he said. \"Trearing cancer is a marrer of srarisrics­ we go wirh rhe numbers.

They can occur without the presence of any therapy, or they can accompany conventional cancer treatment. The myriad alterna­ tives approaches to cancer available in the United States today may each have distinct merits, but no one has proven that they promote spontane­ ous remissions any better than standard radiation and chemotherapy, nor are they apparently any worse. How advanced the cancer is seems not to matter, either. Both tiny tumors and extremely large masses of malig­ nancy can disappear, virtually overnight. Because of their rarity and because they happen as if by chance, spontaneous remissions have so far taught us very little either about the cause of cancer or about how an \"impossible\" cure is achieved. It seems reasonable to suppose that the body is fighting cancer all the time and winning a huge majority of the battles. Many kinds of cancer can be induced, either in test tubes or in laboratory animals, using toxic substances (carcinogens), fatty diets, radiation, high doses of stress, and viruses, among other things. Since we are subjected to all of these at a furious rate, they must be causing damage inside uso DNA is known to break down under these extreme conditions; usually, however, it knows how to repair itself or to detect the damaged material and discard it. This means that early cancers are probably being detected and com­ batted in the body on a regular basis. If you take this process and step it up in intensity, you have the \"miracle\" of a spontaneous remission. It is no miracle at all, in fact, but a natural process that has yet to be ex­ plained, just as curing pneumonia with penicillin would be a miracle if you could not explain it through the germ theory of disease. The point is that the mechanism behind miracle cures is not mystical or random­ and it deserves to be investigated. In ordinary practice, once the miracle is over, the doctor goes back to his routine, including his routine concepts. Even these, however, the stock­ in-trade of medical school, have buckled. To give just one example: Since its inception as a field of rational scientific study, medicine has accepted the degeneration of brain function in elderly people as a natural occur­ 22"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"THE BODY HAS A MIND OF ITS OWN rence. This deterioratíon was thoroughly documented with \"hard\" find­ ings-as we age, our braíns shrínk, grow lighter, and lose millions of neurons every year. We have our full complement of neurons by age 2, and by age 30, the number starts to decline. The los5 of any single brain cell is permanent, since neurons do not regenerate. On the basis of this well-known fact, brain decline seemed to be scientifically valid; sadly but inevítably, ro grow old must lead ro memory loss, decreased reason­ ing ability, impaired intelligence, and related symproms. These time-honored assumptions, however, have now been shown ro be wrong. Careful study of healthy elderIy people-as opposed ro the sick, hospitalized ones whom medicine habituaUy studied-has revealed that 80 percent of healthy Americans, barring psychological distress (such as loneliness, depression, or lack of outside stimulation), suffer no significant memory loss as they age. The ability ro retain new informa­ tion can decline, which is why old people forget phone numbers, names, and the reason for walkíng into a room; but the ability ro remember past events, called long-term memory, actually improves. (One authority on aging quotes Cícero, who declared, 'Tve never heard of an old man who forgot where his money was hidden.\") In tests where 70-year-olds were matched with 20-year-olds, the older people performed better than the younger in this area of memory. After they practiced the other kind of memory-called short-term memory­ for a few minutes every day, the older group could almost match the younger subjects, who were at their prime of mental functioning. Perhaps the \"prime of Efe\" should be extended. The secret, as with almost every other \"natural\" decline in old age, depends on habits of mind, not the circuitry in the nervous system. As long as a person stays mentally active, he will remain as intelligent as in youth and middle age. People will sti11 lose over one billion neurons throughout their lifetime, at an average rate of 18 million per year, but this 10ss is com­ pensated for by another sttucture, the branchlike filaments called den­ drites, which connect the nerve cells ro one another. A nerve cell tends ro be highly individual in shape, but typically it"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"QUANTUM HEALING has a bulbous central section from which thin arms radiate, like an ocropus. These arms, or axons, end in a swirl of tiny filaments that looked treelike to the early anatomists, so they named them dendrites after the Greek word for \"tree.\" Dendrites, which can vary in number from less than a dozen ro more than a thousand per ceH, serve as contact points, allowing the neuron ro send signals to its neighbors. By growing new dendrites, a neuron can open new channels of communication in every direction, like a switchboard sprouting extra lines. It is not known how a thought is actually formed among brain cells or how the bewilderingly vast number of connections interrelate-millions of dendrítes come together at major junction points in the body, such as the solar plexus, not ro mentíon the billions upon billions in the brain itself. But experiments have shown that new dendrites can be grown throughout life, up to advanced old age. The current view is that this new growth easíly provídes us with the physical stmcture for unimpaired brain function. In a healthy brain, senility is not physically normal. A rich multiplication of dendrites might even lie behind grow­ ing wise in old age, a time when more and more of Efe is seen in totality-in other words, more interconnected, just as the nerve ceUs are more interconnected through their new dendrites. This example iIlustrates how radically wrong medicine can be if it insists that matter is superior to mind. To say that a nerve ceH creates thoughts may be tme, but it is just as tme to say that thinking creates nerve ceUs. In the case of the new dendrites, it is the habit of thinking, remembering, and being mentally active that creates the new tissue. Nor is this an isolated finding. Curiously enough, as soon as the concept of the \"new old age\" was permissible in the eyes of doctors, our views of many forms of degeneration began to alter. As long as you exercise, for example, your body's musculature will not wither, and your strength will be unimpaired for Efe, although there wiU be a slow decline in stamina.

Whereas medical school reaches rhar germ A causes disease B and is treated by drug C, narure seems ro feel thar rhis is only one opdon among many. The mental approach to rrearing cancer, for instance, would have been ridiculed a decade ago. But people do seem able to participare in rheir cancer treatment, and even ro control the course of the disease, by using thoughts. In 1971, Dr. O. Cad Simonton, a radiol­ ogist at the University of Texas, met a 61-year-old man with throat cancer. The disease was very far progressed; rhe parient could hardly swallow, and his weight had dropped to 98 pounds. Not only was the prognosis extremely poor-the doctors gave him a 5 percent chance of surviving five years after treatment-but the patient was already so weak that it seemed unlikely he would respond well to radiation, which is the standard therapy for this condition. In despera­ rion, but also curious ro try a psychological approach, Dr. Simonton suggested thar the man enhance his radiatíon therapy rhrough the use of visualizatíon. He was taughr ro visualíze his cancer as vividly as possible. Then, using any menral picture thar appealed ro him, he was asked to visualize his immune system as the white blood cells successfully at­ tacked the cancer cells and swept them out of the body, leaving only healthy cells behind. The man said he envisioned his immune cells as a blizzard of white 25"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"QUANTUM HEALING particles, covering the tumor like snow burying a black rock. Dr. Simon­ ton had him go home and repeat this visualization at intervals through­ out the day. The man agreed, and soon his tumor seemed to be shrinking. In a few weeks it was definitely smaller, and his response to radiation was almost free of side effects; after two months, the tumor was gone. Naturally, Dr. Simonton was surprised and baffled, though elated that the psychological approach had been so powerful. How does a thought defeat a cancer cel1? The mechanism was totally unknown-in fact, given the fiendish complexity of the immune system and the nervous system, both of which were obviously involved here, the mechanism might be unknowable. For his part, the patient accepted his cure with­ out undue surprise. He told Dr. Simonton that arthritis in his legs kept him fram going stream-fishing as much as he liked. Now that the cancer was gone, why not try visualizing the arthritis away too? Within a few more weeks, that is exactly what happened. The man remained free of both cancer and arthritis for a follow-up period of six years. This now-famous case is a landmark in mind-body medicine, but unfortunately it is not the whole story. Dr. Simonton's visualization therapy (it has branched out into a broad mind-body program) does not reliably cure cancer. One of my patients used it with success to cure herself of breast cancer, I believe, although she practiced the technique on her own and not under a doctor's scrutiny. Long-term statistical studies, however, dispute whether such sporadic results are any better than those of conventional treatment. At present, conventional therapy has a big edge. If a woman with breast cancer, for example, detects the tumor while it is still very small and localized, the chances of curing her (a \"cure\" means surviving at least three years without a recurrence of the disease) are currently better than 90 percent. In comparison, the number of spontaneous remissions, at the most generous estimate, would be well below 1/10 of 1 percent.

Although patients may long for such approaches, most doctors still fear and distrust them. But even if Dr. Simonton's patient were one of a kind, he is enough to rock our conception of how the body cures itself, for here is nature finding a way to combat death that no doctor had ever tried-and he re also is the dark possibility that what the doctor usually tries is not helping nature but stifling it. Curious and adventuraus doctors have flocked to experiment with mind-body innovations over the last decade, from biofeedback and hyp­ notism to visualizations and behavior modification. The results across the board have been amorphous and hard to interpreto Psychologist Mi­ chael Lerner spent three years conducting an in-depth study of forty clinics offering alternative approaches to cancer, whose methods ranged from herbs and macrabiotics to visualizatíon of positive mental images. He found that these \"complementary cancer centers\" were sought out by patíents who were generally well educated and prosperous, that the doc­ tors running the clinics were also seríous and well intentioned, but that nothing close to a cute for cancer had been discovered anywhere he visited. When he interviewed the patients, a faídy large proportíon (40 per­ cent) thought that they had experienced at least a temporary improve­ ment in the quality of their lives. Another 40 percent reported that they experienced actual medical improvements in their condition, lasting fram a few days to a number of years. About 10 percent fell at the extreme ends of the spectrum, one group saying that they got nothing fram the treatment and the other that they were now partially or wholly recovered from their disease. Generally, the record of alternative ap­ proaches is that they give a measure of comfort and relief to patients, but disappointingly, the remission rates are not radically different from those of standard therapy.

Ir seems utterly self-evident thar sick people and healthy people enjoy different states of mind, but the causal connection ís stíll elusive. In 1985 a major study of breast cancer conducted at the Universiry of Pennsylvania failed to find any correlarion between the mental attitude of patients and their chances of surviving their disease beyond two years. In an editorial accompanying the study, which ap­ peared in the prestigious New England Journal 01 Medicine, the whole concept of emotions affecting cancer was denounced. \"Our belief in disease as a direct reflection of mental states,\" the editorial declared, \"is largely folklore.\" In response, letters deluged the journal, most of them from physicians who heatedly disagreed with the editorial's conclusion. Ir certainly seems unreasonable to discount mental attitudes as a factor in illness, much less as folklore. Every practicing physician knows that the patienr's wiU to recover plays a vital part in his treatment. Wedded as they are to \"hard\" medicine, most doctors nonetheless cannot condone the idea that atti­ tude, belief, and emotions do not play their parro Hippocrates stated at the dawn of Western medicine thar Ha patienr who is mortally sick might yet recover from belief in the goodness of his physician.\" Numer­ ous modern studies have corraborated this, by showing that people who trust their doctor and surrender themselves to his care are likelier to recover than those who approach medicine with distrust, fear, and antag­ OnIsm. In the wake of the editorial, tempers flared and lines of allegiance were drawn, while the issues became even more confused. Three separate studies of breast-cancer survival rates from the mid-1980s carne up with three enrirely different results. In one, the women who displayed srrong positive attitudes tended ro outlive those who were negative, and it did not matter if their diseases were more advanced-positive emotions, it seemed, helped them recover fram a late-stage, metastasized cancer, while patients with negative emotions died from small tumors that had been diagnosed relatively earIy. A second study, however, found that any strong attitude, if expressed 28"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"THE BOOY HAS A MINO OF ITS OWN rather than held back, helped in survival of this very deadly disease. While the first finding bolsters common sense-the idea thar positivíry is berter rhan negativiry-the second does much the same from anorher angle, the idea being rhat it is betrer to fight than to give up. Publicity was given to a so-called cancer personality, who botdes up emotions and somehow converrs repression into malignanr cells. The opposire would be rhe \"srrong will to live\" type, who can be eíther positíve or negative. All of this follows a certain logic, except for rhe study that appeared in the New England Jotirnal 01 Medicirze to begín with, seconded by sup­ porting studies, which found no correlation between any emotional par­ tern and surviving breast cancer beyond two years. Even as it grew in populariry, becoming one of the most welcome innovarions sínce the Salk vaccine, rhe concepr of mínd-body medicine was shaken. Now, a familiar pattern has emerged, in which rhe public ís informed of sorne elating breakthrough, followed by disappointing clínical results rhar are generally known only in resrricred medical circles. A classic example was the division of hearr-attack paríents, more than rhree-quarrers of them middle-aged males, inro high-risk Type A per­ sonalities and low-risk Type B's. The Type A personalíty was supposed to be a hard-driving, compulsive worker, constantly racing deadlines and churning his sysrem wíth srress hormones, as opposed to the relaxed, roleranr, more balanced Type B. Type A suffered from \"the disease of being in a hurry\"; therefore, it seemed logical that his hearr would eventually rebel, leading ro a coronary. Unforrunarely, controlled studies have indicared that rhis widely ac­ cepred division is nor so neat. Ir turns out that mosr peopIe have sorne Type A in them and sorne Type B, and rhat tolerance for stress varies widely, with certain groups stating that they thrive on it. Finally, a 1988 srudy found rhar if aman acrually has a hearr attack, Type A's survive berter than Type B's. Their drive to succeed apparently rurns into a benefir once rhe coronary strikes.

This is not a philosophical question but a practical one. If a patient comes in with cancer, is his mental state judged by how he feels on the day of the diagnosis, long before, or long afterward? Dr. Lawrence LeShan, author of the pioneering studies from the 1950s correlating emotions to cancer, went back into the childhoods of cancer patients to find the black seed that poisoned their psychology, and he theorized that it lay dormant in the subconscious for years before inducing their disease. In my own praetiee, I saw a lung-cancer patient who had lived com­ fortably with a coin-sized lesion in his lungs for years. He did not even suspeet that it was cancerous, and since he was in his sixties, the les ion was growing quite slowly. However, as soon as I told him that the les ion was consistent with a diagnosis of lung caneer, he beeame terribly agitated. Within a month he started ro cough up blood; within three, he was dead. If his state of mind contributed to this untoward haste, it apparendy acted quickly. This patient could live with his tumor, but he couldn't live with the diagnosis. Even more basic is this question: Is the \"mind\" that a doctor is interested in the patient's overall personality, his subconscious, his atti­ tudes, his deepest beliefs, or something not yet undersrood and defined by psychology? Ir may be that the relevant aspect of the mind involved in getting sick or getting well is not even specifically human. An Ohio University study of in the 1970s was conducted by feeding quite toxic, high-cholesterol diets to rabbits in order to block their arteries, duplicating the that such a diet has on human arteries. Consistent results began to appear in all the rabbit groups except for one, which strangely displayed 60 percent fewer symptoms. Nothing in the rabbits' physiology could account for their high toler­ ance ro the diet, until it was discovered by aecident that the student who was in charge of feeding these particular rabbits liked ro fondle and pet them. He would hold eaeh rabbit lovingly for a few minutes before feeding it; astonishingly, this alone seemed ro enable the animals to 30"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"THE BODY HAS A MIND OF ITS OWN overcome the toxic dieto Repeat experiments, in which one group of rabbits was treated neutrally while the others were loved, carne up with similar results.

There is even a possibiliry, many doctors would contend, rhat the mind ís a fiction, medically speaking. When we think thar ir is sick, what is really sick is the brain. By rhis logic, the classical mental disor­ ders--depression, schizophrenia, and psychosis-are actually brain dis­ orders. This logic has obvious inadequacies: ir is like saying that car wrecks should be blamed on automobiles. But the brain, being a physi­ cal organ that can be weíghed and dissected, makes medicine feel more secure than does the mind, which has proved impossible to define after many centuries of introspection and analysis. Doctors are quite happy not to be called upon as philosophers. The ability of today's psychotropic, or mind-influencing, drugs to relieve the major symptoms of mental illness, such as depression, manía, anxiety, and hallucinations, is much greater than any treatment available in the past. Chemical psychiatry is likely to vie with its exact opposite, mind-body medicine, as the medical revolution of our time.

This hypothesis was further simplified in 1984 when a psychiatrist at the University of Iowa, Dr. Rafiq Wazirí, reviewed what was known abour rhe brain chemistry of schízophrenics and narrowed the defect down ro an even smaller molecule called serine, a common amino acid found in most protein foods. Serine is thought ro be an early link in rhe manufacture of dopamine. Unable to merabolize serine correctly, the brains of schizophrenics apparently overproduce dopamine ro offset the lack-the exact process is still unknown. Could ir be thar full-blown schizophrenia, considered the most bizarre and complex of mental disor­ ders, depends on how well you digest your food? Earlier findings at M.I.T. have already shown that the brain's basic chemistry is so variable that it can be modified by a single meal. Dr. Waziri bolstered support for his theory by taking a group of long­ ter m schizophrenics and them a dietary supplement of glycine, a chemical that serine is supposed ro build as part of the dopamine mecha­ nism. Perhaps the extra glycine would bypass the serine UI.Jl'-'-C, Waziri reasoned, and bring dopamine back into balance. In the trial group, a few schizophrenics responded quite dramatically-they were able ro stop their medications without having any psychotic episodes. For the first time in years, their thinking was free from both their disease and the mind-numbing drugs used ro treat it. A dietary approach to mental illness would be far more benign than current therapies. The possibility of finding more dietary links is also tantalizing. At least one best-seIling diet book has jumped the gun by listing \"happy foods\" and \"sad foods,\" on the theory that the amino acids in these foods go directly ro the brain and are made into chemicals that produce either positive or negative moods. Milk, chicken, bananas, and leafy greens are among the happy foods, because they stimulate dopamine and two other \"positive\" brain chemicals. Sugary and fatty foods, on the other hand, are typically sad foods, because they stimulate acetylcholine, a \"negative\" chemical.

In the current armosphere of ambiguous findings, rhe two opposite positions-rrear rhe body through rhe mind, treat the mind through the body-are equally up in the airo None of rhe confusion has been adequately clarified, and as a result, the subjective world of rhe mind remains a treacherous force, capricious in its ability to heal, equally capricious in its abílity to bring íllness. Many doctors, because of their materialÍstic bias, would be thrilled to conclude that chemicals must be the answer to aH our mental and physi­ cal mysteries. I don't think they can be. In my specialty of endocrinology, sorne of the first chemicals that affect the mind, the endocrine hormones, were discovered. Evety day 1 see patients who display mental symptoms that are traceable to defects in their hormonal balance-the distorted think­ ing of a diabetic going into a low-blood-sugar reactíon, the mood shifts of the menstrual cycle, and even a characteristic depression that is the earliest warning sign of certain cancers (a tumor in the pancreas, for example, may be too small to detect, yet it wiU release cortisol and other \"stress hormones\" into the bloodstream, causing the patient to feel de­ pressed).

What controls this constant flux? We cannot leave the mind out of the mind-body connection altogether. To say that the body heals itself using only chemicals is like saying that a car shifts gears using only the transmission. Clearly it takes a driver who knows what he is doing. Although medicine has spent several centuties trying to hold on to the idea that the body runs itself alone, like a self-motivated machine, there must be a driver here, too. Otherwise, out body's chemistry would be a jumble of floating molecules instead of the incredibly ordered and pre­ cise machinery that it so obviously is. In a more na'ive age, the driver was thought to be a tiny man, called the homunculus, who sat in the heart and performed all the gear shifts needed to run the body. The homunculus went out in the Renaissance, when anatomists began for the first time to dissect cadavers and verify what was inside them. The homunculus wasn't found inside the heart (neither was the soul), but that left a huge, glaring gap between the mind and the body. Many scientists since have tried to fill the gap with the brain, saying that the brain's function is to order and control all other functions in the physiology; but this answer begs the question, because the brain is just another machine. The driver still needs to be there. 1 will argue that he is, but he has become something much more abstract than the homunculus or even the brain-he is built into the intelligent power that motivates us to live, move, and think. Can that be proved? The next step for us is to work out way deeper into the body's inner intelligence, to try to find out what motivates it. The territory of mind-body medicine has no givens and no inflexible rules, which is all to the good. For decades, medicine has known that much disease has a psychosomatic component, yet dealing with that component has been like trying to harness the wind.

At any one time, the number of activities being coordinated in our bodies is literally infinite. Like the Earth's ecosystems, our physiology appears to operate in separate compartmems that in fact are invisibly connected: we eat, breathe, talk, think, digest our food, fight off infections, purify our blood of toxins, renew our cells, discard wastes, vote for Republicans, and much more besides. Each of these activities weaves its way into the fabríc of the whole. (Our ecology is more planet­ like than most peop1e realize. Creatures roam our surface, as unmindful of our hugeness as we are of their minuteness. Colonies of mites, for example, spend thejr emite Efe cycle in our eyelashes.) Within the body's vast array, the functions of any single cell-such as one of the 15 billion neurons in the brain-fill a good-sized medical text. The vo1umes devoted to any one system of the body, such as the immune system or the nervous system, take up several shelves in a medical library. The healing mechanism resides somewhere in this overall comp1exity, but it is elusive. There is no one organ of healing. How does the body know what ro do when ir is damaged, then? Medicine has no simple answer. Any one of the processes involved in healing a superficial cut­ the clotting of the blood, for example-is incredibly comp1ex, so much so rhat if the mechanism fails, as it does with hemophi1iacs, advanced scientific medicine is at a 10ss to duplicate the impaired function.

Ir can never share the knowledge that everyone else was born with. The body, we must admit, has a mind of its own. Once we understand this mysterious aspect of our basic nature, then the miraculous nature of curing cancer should disappear.

Perhaps the difference is small and exists only in our heads. lf you are peeling potatoes and cut your finger with a slip of che knife, the cut heals by itself, and obviously you are not wonder-struck, because the process of healing-the clotting of the blood to close the wound, the formation of a scab, and the regeneration of new skin and blood vessels-seems altogether normal. Yet, we should be aware that this feeling of normalcy is not the same as knowing what healíng is or how to control it. It is sobering to consider how much of the knowledge in medical books pertains not to life but to death. By performing autopsies on cadavers, examining tissue sUdes under a microscope, and analyzing blood, urine, and other isolated by-products of che body, the majority of medical knowledge has been obtained. True, patients are examined when they are alive, and tests can be run on many isolated funcrions in their bodies. But the knowledge so acquired is rudimentary compared to the volumes of super-sophisticated data devoted to death. The poet Wordsworth wrote this memorably terse Une: \"We murder ro dissect.\" No truer statement has ever been made about the limitations of medical research.

It would almost be fairer to call the drug an inert ingredient. The reason for this lies at the level of our cells. The outer membrane of each ceH, or the ceH wall, is outfitted with numerous sites called receptors.

The diuretic cannot help it lf too much salt is taken where water is still needed. Since potassium is close to sodium in its atomic strucmre, the diuretic also causes it to be depleted, leading to weakness, fatigue, and leg cramps.

Cancer is wild, ami-social behavior, whereby a single cell reproduces itself without check, heeding no signals from anywhere except, appar­ ently, its own dememed DNA. Why this occurs, no one knows. It is a good bet that the body itself knows how to reverse process, but for sorne reason, equally unknown to science, it doesn't always succeed. It 1S only a matter of time, once the process begins, before the cancer cells overwhelm a vital organ, crowd out its normal cells, and cause death. When the final crisis comes, the cancer cells perish with the rest of the body, doomed by their ungoverned appetite for self-expansion. Medicine has so far not figured out a way to send a message ro the cancer cells in time ro ward off the tragic fate chey have created. The chemicals a physícian might use against cancer are not at all effective on the level of imelligence. Cancer 1S endowed with mad genius, while drugs are simple-minded. So the oncologist resorts to a much cruder assault, a form of poisoning. The ami-cancer drug that is administered is gene rally toxic ro the emire body, but because cancer cells are growing at a much faster mte than normal cells, they ingest more of the poison and die off first. The whole strategy is a calculated risk.

Then the cancer may be defeated, adding years of useful life to the patiem's existence. Ironically, the therapy may fail because it strips the body of the very imelligence that usually guards it from disease. Many anti-cancer drugs are extremely damaging to the body's immune system; they direcdy suppress the bone marrow, which manufactures our white cells, with devastating effect on the white-cell coum in the blood.

It has been estimated that a typical cancer patient may have 10 billion cancer cells. lf his chemotherapy i8 99.99 percent effective, there would stiU be 1 miUion survívors, more than enough ro start over again. Cancer cells are not created egual; sorne are hardier than others and therefore more difficult ro kili. Ir may be that destroying the weaker cells acts as a kind of Darwinian selection, leaving the fittest ro survive. In that case, chemotherapy would actually promote a more virulent disease than it cured. (Likewise, the persistent staphylococcus infections that patients come down with in hospitals are often highly resistant to antibiotics, because only the most vicious bacteria can live in the sterile environment of operating rooms and withstand the continual bombard­ ment of penicillin injections.) One can easily conceive of a strain of \"super cancer\" that might arise trom one or two malignant cells that had the strongest resistance to treatment. In any case, the early promise that chemotherapy would wipe out cancer in our generation, widely believed in the 1950s, has sobered. Now a few cancers at a time are defeated, such as lymphocytic leukemia in children and sorne bnds of Hodgkin's lymphoma, while other major bUers, such as lung and brain cancers, are virtually unrouchable through chemotherapy.

But the bias has a huge blind spot in it. Despite the overwhelming superiority of the body's know-how, which scientists freely acknowledge, a minute amount of time and money is spent trying to grasp the living body as a whole, and for very good reason. The Greek philosopher Hera­ clitus made the famous remark, \"You cannot step into the same river twice,\" because the river is constantly being changed by new water rushing in. The same holds rrue for the body. Al! of us are much more like a river than anything frozen in time and space. If you could see your body as it really is, you would never see it the same way twÍce. Ninety-eight percent of the atoms in your body were nor rhere ayear ago. The skeleron thar seems so solid was nor there rhree months ago. The configurarion of rhe bone cells remains somewhat con­ stant, but atoms of al! kinds pass freely back and forth rhrough the cel! wa11s, and by that means you acquire a new skeleton every three months. The skin is new every month. You have a new stomach lining every four days, wirh rhe actual surface cells that contact food being renewed every five minutes. The cells in the liver turn over very slowly, but new atoms sti11 flow rhrough them, líke water in a river course, making a new liver every six weeks. Even within the brain, whose cells are not replaced once they die, rhe content of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and so on is totally different taday from ayear ago.

Cerrain atoms-carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and nirrogen-pass through rhe body very quickly, being an essential part of rhe things we use up the fastest-food, air, and water. If it were up to only these four elements, we would be creating new bodies for ourselves literally every"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"SCULPTURE OR THE RIVER? month. However, the pace of renewal is slowed by other elements that do not flow through us very rapidly. The calcium bound into our bones can take a whole year to replace itself-some aurhorities extend the time to several years. Iron, the component that makes red blood cells red, is held on to quite tenaciously, being lost mainly through the sloughing of dead skin cells or the actual loss of blood. Even though the rates of change may differ, change is always there. What 1 am caUing \"intelligence\" takes on the role of guiding this change so that we do not collapse into a heap of bricks. That is one of the most obvious facts about the physiology, bur intelligence is so changeable, so quick on the move-in other words, so alive-that medi­ cal textbooks devote almost no space to it at aU. To get an idea of how limited our current knowledge is, consider the structure of a neuron. The neurons that compose the brain and central nervous system \"taIk\" to one another across gaps caUed synapses. These gaps separate the tiny branchlike fiIaments, the dendrites, that grow at the ends of each nerve cell. Everyone possesses billions of these ceUs, divided between the brain and the central nervous system, and as we saw, each one is capable of growing dozens or even hundreds of dendrires (the total estimated at 100 million míllion), meaning that at any one time, the possible combinations of signals jumping across the synapses of the brain exceed the number of atoms in the known universe. The signals also communicate with one another at lightning speed. To read this sentence, your brain takes a few l\"l:{illíseconds to arrange a precise pattern of millions of signals, only to dissolve them instandy, never to be repeated again in exactly the same way. In medical sehool, we were taught a simple model of how neurons communicate: an electrical charge forms on one side of the synapse, and when the charge is large enough, it jumps like a spark across the gap ro deliver a signal to another nerve cell. Assuming thar this is the correct mechanism (in reality it isn't), the description we learned in our neurol­ ogy textbook in 1966 rold us next to nothing about how neurons act in real life; the book model makes sense only for a single nerve cell, iso­ 45"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"QUANTUM HEALING lated, stopped in time, and stripped of contexto In truth, the action taking place at the gaps in the nervous system is like that of a cosmic computer reduced to a microcosmic scale. This awesome computer oper­ ates continuously, handles hundreds of programs at a time, deals in multiple billions of \"bytes\" of information every second, and, most mi­ raculously of aH, knows how to run itself. It is not really our medical training that was at fault here. How can any textbook possibly describe rhis whole process? To think is to form patteros inside ourselves that are just as complex, fleeting, and rich in theÍr diversity as ís reality ítself. Thínking is the mirror of the world, and nothing less. Science simply does not have rhe tools to look at such a phenomenon, which is at once ínfinite and alive. The living body will not stop to be studíed, certainly not as a whole.

In 1986, a shock was delivered that could rurn the whole field of braÍn research on its head: a Mexican neuro-surgeon, Dr. Ignacio Madrazo, successfully implanted healthy new cells into the brain of a patient with Parkinson's disease. Not only did the transplant take, which previously was considered impossible, but the patient showed an amazing 85 percent return to normal functíoning. Before the surgery, the patient, a Mexican farmer in his late thirtíes, had been rendered virtually helpless by his disease. Parkinson's strikes about 1 percent of people over age 50. It begins with muscle tremors, rigidity of the limbs, or a tendency to move very slowly. The immediate cause of these symptoms is a deficiency of dopamine, the same brain chem1Cal that leads to schizophrenia when it is in oversupply. Por reasons not yet known, the nerve cells that produce dopamine, 10­ cated in a part of the brain stem called the substantia nigra, begin to die, creatíng the deficiency.

By analogy, the brain damage associated with Alzheimer's disease, which also 1n­ volves memory loss, may be treatable in the same way. The Swedish experíment also implies an advance over the brain-tissue graft, because it did not use live tissues or require surgery. One after another, the basic tenets of brain physiology are having to be reconsidered and drastically modified. The breakthroughs continue to be revolutionary: another Swedish team has shown that nerve ceUs can implanted onto the retina of the eye, whose surface is just an extension and spreading out of the optic nerve. After they are implanted, che cells begin to grow new branches, confirmíng that regeneratíon in the brain is possible and normal.

Critics of Madrazo's procedure have noted that the recovery time of his patients, which begins within a few weeks after che brain cells are implanted, is far too fast for the new tissue to \"take.\" It may be that the brain is repairing itself tocally on its own, releasing chemicals in response to the sutgical wound rather chan from the new cells (rather like an oyster releasing mother-of-pearl in response to a bit of grit under its shell). Perhaps these findings are telling us not so much to perform more transplant surgery but rather to look for new abilities in the brain as a living, dynamic organ. For all that it has been giorified by modern medicine, the brain has been the most frozen part of the frozen sculpture modei of the body, since it alone couid not repair itself. On the face of it, this is a suspicíous claim. AH the cells in your body, whether a hair follicle, a neuron, or a heart ceH, grew out of one double strand of DNA at the moment of conception. Everything you can do-think, speak, run, play the violin, or rule a country-builds on a capacity programmed into that one original molecule. Therefore, to say that a neuton cannot heal itself is the same as saying rhar irs DNA has been crippled. Is rhis a reasonable assumption? Certainly the DNA has decided to become a brain cell instead of a heart cell, and thar involves expressing certain parts of its porential while suppressing others. But rhis is totally different from saying that any ability in the DNA has been losr. Nothing is lost in DNA.

Proof of this exists in [he proce­ dure called cloning: theoretically, one can take a ceH from the inside of your cheek and, given the right condirions, produce an ideotical copy of you, or a million ídentical copies. The genius of nature is rhat she did not setde for a million ideotical clones; indeed, only the lowest organ­ Ísms consist of identical cells, and most of them are single-celled, like the amoeba. Yet, the distinctíon between an amoeba and a human being breaks down at the level of DNA, in this sense: aH of the amoeba is cootained in its litde packet of DNA, and aH of you is contained in yours. So it should not be so surprising that a neuron actually can (under circumstances we do not quite understand) decide ro drop its rule about not repairing Ítself and suddenly begin to do jUSt that. Its DNA ís not crippled. The ttuth of the matter is that the brain is too complex to be turned ioto a model, and science by definirion works with models. Models are useful, but without exception they have blind spots built ioto them. To see braín function, or any function in the body, without a model, you would have ro see it as a very abstract and seemingly cootradicrory thing, as non-change being preserved in the midst of dynamic change. As non-change, the body is solid and stable, like a frozen sculpture. As change, it is mobile and flowing, like a river. In the scientific worldview inherited from Newron, it has been almost impossible to hold both aspects together in one's mind at the same time. 1 remember a physicist remarking that for Newton, nature was like a billiard game. What he meaot was that classical physics studies a collection of sol id objects-the billiard balls-moving along straight lines propelled by fixed laws of motion. The game is ro predict their paths, speed, momen­ mm, and so on, like an English gentleman at his evening game of snooker. To make these calculations, however, you have to stop the game and draw a model of it, complete with formulas for the proper angles, trajectories, and so on.

The physical roures are certainly visible-the central nervous system runs down the spinaI coIumn, branching out on either side at each vertebra in the backbone; these major nerves then branch into millions of tinier pathways that commu­ nicate to every region of the body. The early anatomists saw the major nerves in the sixteenth century, but the nervous system kept a secreto Who were the runners that took the messages to and from the brain? Many people still think that the nerves work eIectrically, like a tele­ graph system, because until fifteen years ago, that is what medicaI texts contended. However, in the 1970s, a series of important discoveries began, centering on a new class of minute chemicals called neurotrans­ mitters. As their name implies, these chemicals transmit nerve impulses; they act in our bodies as \"communicator molecules,\" whereby the neu­ rons of the brain can talk to the rest of the body. Neurotransmitters are the runners that race to and from the brain, telling every organ inside us of our emotions, desires, memories, intu­ itions, and dreams. None of these events are confined to the brain alone. Likewise, none of them are stricdy mental, since they can be coded into chemical messages. Neurotransmitters touch the life of every cell. Wher­ ever a thought wants to go, these chemicals must go too, and without them, no thoughts can existo To think is to practice brain chemistry, promoting a cascade of responses throughour the body. We have already seen that intelligence, as know-how, pervades the physiology-now it has acquired a material basis. That gives away the plot of this chapter, but with none of the drama. In truth, no other recent event in biomedicine has been as revolutionary as these discoveries. The arrival of neurotransmitters on the scene makes the ínteraction of mind and matter far more mobíle and flowing than 54"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"MESSENGERS PROM INNER SPACE ever befare-far closer to the model of the river. They also help 611 the gap that apparendy separates mind and body, one of the deepest myster­ les that man has faced since he began to consider what he is. At 6rst, around 1973, it seemed that only two neurotransmitters were needed, one to activate a distant ceH, such as a muscle, and the other to slow down the actlvity. Two brain chemicals, acetylcholine and norepi­ nephrine, do just that; they are the \"go\" and \"slow down\" signals of the nervous system. They were considered revolurionary at the time, because they proved that the impulse sent from one nerve cell to the next was not electrical but chemical in nature. All at once, the accepted notion of tlny sparks jumping from neuron to neuron was rendered obsolete. Bur the new chemical model at 6rst continued to preserve the basic theory that only two signals were necessary. Man-made computers operate us­ ing just this kind of binary switch, and apparendy so did the brain. Then, as molecular biologists around the world began to investigate more deeply, numerous new neurotransmitters cropped up, each with a different molecular structure and apparently a different message to de­ liver. Structural1y, many of them were related, being built up as pep­ tides, complex chains of amino acids of the same bnd as those which appear in the proteins that make up every cell, includíng brain cells. A great many riddles began to be solved, directly or indirectly, as these discoveries emerged. If you take a sleeping cat, remove a tiny portion of its spinal fluid, and inject it ioto a cat that is awake, the second cat will immediately fall asleep. This is because a cat's brain purs its body to sleep chemically, with its own internal sleeping potion. In order for the animal to wake up again, the opposite chemical, a wake-up signal, must be injected ioto the spinal column. In humans, where the same chemical mechanisms operate, the body is awakened in the morning not by a rude internal alarm but by a series of timed signals, at 6rst mild, then progressively stronger, that lift us from deep sleep by stages. The whole process involves a gradual transition, in four or 6ve waves, from the biochemistry of sleep to the biochemistry of 55"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"QUANTUM HEALING wakefulness. rf rhis process is interrupred, you do nor come as fully awake as you should-rhe biochemisrry of rwo disrincr phases has been mixed.

All camels exhibit an unusual tolerance for high levels of pain-they can calmly chew on thorns while at the same time being beaten with a stick by an irate camel driver. Curious re­ searchers examined camels' brain cells and found that they produce large quantities of a specific biochemical that, if injected into other animals, causes them to ignore pain, too. Sleep and pain tolerance, it 1S now known, thus depend on precise chemical messengers produced in the brain. One by one, various other functions that were once \"all in your head\" have been connected to specific neurotransmirters. Schizophrenics suffer­ ing acutely from hallucinations and psychotic thoughts often improve dramatically if put on a kidney dialysis machine, which filters impurities from the blood. As we saw, brain researchers have established thar a neurotransmirter called dopamine exists in abnormally high levels in the brains of schizophrenics. Current chemical treatment of rhe disorder entails using psycho-active drugs rhat suppress dopamine; perhaps rhe dialysis machine is actually removing it, or a related by-product, from the bloodstream. By the mid-1980s, barely ten years after the original breakthrough, more than fifty such neurotransmitters and neurapeptides were known. All fifty can be manufactured on one side of the synapses between our neurons, and once they cross the synapses, all fifty can be received by the receptor sites on the other side. This implies an incredible flexibility to communicate from ceH to cell. The individual neuran was now seen to be a producer of messages that did not just say \"yes\" or \"no,\" as a computer does. The brain's vocabulary is far larger, encompassing thou­ 56"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"MESSENGERS FROM INNER SPACE sands of combinarions of separare signals, with no end in s1ght, Slllce new neurotransmitters continue to be discovered at a fast rate. What kind of messages do nerve cells exchange with one another? The answer is tantalizing, for certain segments of our chemical vocabulary seem ro be juSt as specific as ordinary speech, while others are highly ambiguous. Our tolerance for pain, like the camel's, depends on the class of biochemicals discovered in che 1970s called endorphins and en­ kephalins, which act as the body's natural painkillers. The word en­ dorphin means \"internal morphine,\" and enkephalin means \"inside the brain.\" And that is their story: chey are like a version of morphine produced by the brain itself. This hitherto unknown ability to make internal oplates proved very exciting. It was already suspected thar rhe body must be able to regulate the sensation of pain. Although insistent, pain does not always register on our awareness. Strong emotions, for example, can override pain slg­ nals from the body, as when a mother rushes to save her child from a burning house or a wounded soldier fights on, ignoring the pain of his injuries. Under more ordinary circumstances, all of us to sorne extent can take our attention away from a minor pain-we don't notice a sore throat, for instance, if we are talking to someone with intense interest. Despite this common experience of having rhe pain threshold rise and fall, no mechanism had ever accounted for ir. Now medicine could ex­ plain it by using these internal painkillers, the endorphins and en­ kephalins, which every neuron in the body is able to produce at will. Very quickly the general public was told that the brain produces narcot­ ics up to two hundred times stronger than anything you can buy on the street, with rhe added boon that our own painkillers seemed ro be nonaddictive. Perhaps in the future a physician would anesthetize his patients by stimulating sorne region in their brains, giving Western medicine a scientific form of Chinese acupuncture. Morphine and endorphins both block pain by filling a certain receptor on the neuron and preventing other chemicals that carry the message of pain from coming in. Withour these chemicals, there can be no sensation 57"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"QUANTUM HEALING of pain, no matter how much physical provocaríon is present. Using this model, a molecule of endorphin is like a specinc word, the word pain­ killet\". One can imagine that whenever the wordpain comes ro the brain's attendon, it has the opdon of sending painkiller back as its answer. Unfortunately, this simple picture was clouded over by later research. It was found that levels of endorphins in the body do not correspond on a one-to-one basis with how much pain is being felt. This can be proved with placebos, or dummy drugs. Patients who are in pain can often be relieved by receiving a placebo, usually a coated sugar pill, which they are told is a powerful painkiller. Not everyone will respond to this, but generally between 30 percent and 60 percent will report that their pain went away. This result, called the placebo effect, has been ooted for centuries, but it is highly unpredictable. The doctor cannot teH in advaoce which patients will benent or to what extent. Why should a totally inert sugar pill relieve pain io the flrst place, even the stabbiog pain of pepríc ulcers or traumatic surgery? En­ dorphins, it was now discovered, must hold the aoswer. A drug called naloxone acts as a chemical antagooist to morphine, meaning that it has the ability to knock morphine molecules out of a receptor site. When naloxone is administered on top of a painkiller, the sensation of pain instantly floods back. As it turns out, the same thing will happen with the placebo. The patients whose pain went away from the sugar pill reported that it returned again after they too k naloxone. This implied that eodorphios aod morphioe must basically be the same drug, the difference being that one is manufactured by the body and the other by the opium poppy. But once again, it was only a certaio percentage of patieots who showed this result. Naloxone made the pain return in fu11 for certain patients; for others, the placebo still worked totally; and for still others, ooly a little of the pain carne back. Researchers found them­ selves in a state of renewed confusion, where they remaio today. Eo­ dorphins are certainly internal painkillers, but uncoveriog new molecules was not the whole answer. 58"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"MESSENGERS PROM INNER SPACE Pain studies have now shown that morphine is not chemically identi­ cal to endorphins, thar endorphins interact in a more complex way rhan narcotíc drugs, and rhat any form of treatment for pain relief-mor­ phine, endorphins, acupuncture, or hypnosis-is highly variable in its effectiveness. It was also discovered that endorphins cannot be made into satisfactory pharmaceuricals: our internal painkillers are just as addictive as heroin if given by injection. Soon, the same frustrating complications that scientists ran up against with the endorphins and enkephalins spread to all the other neuro­ transmitters. It turns our that a neuron does not simply catch a signal from a neighboring nerve cel! and pass it along untouched to the next synapse. That is only one of its choices. Although no one can describe exactly how neurons receive their chemical messages or how they trans­ port them down their own axons, or trunks, it 1S known that the process must be very flexible. The nerve cell can change the message en route, turning the chemical ir received at point A into a different one at point B. The receptor sites on rhe ends of nerve ceIls can also modify them­ selves to receive different types of messages; the sending station on the other side of the synapse is equaHy versatile. Por our purposes, this confusion is actually a highly encouraging state of affairs, because it proves that the body cannot be understood without the missing ingredient of intelligence. The physical makeup of en­ dorphins, or any other neurochemical, is nor nearIy as important as their know-how-how they choose their sites, what triggers them ro act, how they \"talk\" to the rest of the body in precise coordination, and so on. Even in the midst of a genuine chemical revolurion, mind is superior to matter. In fact, ir now appears that the molecular structure of any neuro­ transmitter is completely secondary to the brain's ability to employ it. It came as a tremendous surprise to ceH biologists that, as far as molecules gO, neurotransmitters are nothing special. All of the protein in our bodies is built up from chains of twenty basic amino acids, and these chains can be further arranged into longer strands called peptides. 59"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"QUANTUM HEALING Neuropeptides have their own signature, making them distínct from the other peptide chains in the body, but the same factory, our DNA, makes aH of them. DNA is the source for aH the proteíns that repair cells, buíld new ones, replace missing or defective pieces of the genetic code, heal cuts and bruises, and so forth. Without bothering ro invent a new class of chemicals, the DNA has figured out another use for its familiar raw materials, the amines, amino acids, and peptides. Once again, it is just the ability to make these different products that is crucial. There is nothing special about the molecules themselves, even though their discovery by a molecular biolo­ gist may be special to science. Where does the ability to make the neurotransmitters come from, then? Perhaps we should look ro the contribution made by the mínd. After aH, it is not really the adrenaline molecule that makes a mother rush into a burníng building to save her child or an endorphin molecule that protects her from feeling the flames. Love makes her rush in, and singIe-minded determinatíon protects her from pain. It juSt happens that these attributes of her mind have found a chemical pathway that the braín can follow to talk to the body. Now we have arrived at the heart of the matrero Mind by any defini­ tíon is nonmaterial, yet it has devised a way to work in partnership with these complicated communicator molecules. Their association is so close, as we have seen, that mind cannot be projected into the body without such chemicals. Yet these chemicals are not mind. Or are they? The whole paradoxical situation was wittily summarized several years ago when the eminent English neurologist and Nobel Prize winner Sir John Eccles was asked to address a conference of parapsychologists, who were discussing the usual topics of ESP, telepathy, and psychokinesis­ the ability to move physical objects with the mind. If you want to see real psychokinesis, he told his audience, then consider the feats of mind­ over-matter performed in the brain. It ís quite astonishíng that with every thought, the mind manages to move the atoms of hydrogen, car­ bon, oxygen, and the other particles in the brain's cells. It would appear 60"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"MESSENGERS FROM INNER SPACE rhar nothing is furrher aparr than an insubstantial thought and the solid gray matter of the brain. The whole trick is somehow done withour any apparent link. The mystery of mind-over-matter has not been expIaíned by biology, which prefers ro push on to more and more complicated chemical struc­ tures operating at finer and finer levels of the physiology. Ir is sti11 obvíous that no one is ever going ro find a particle, however minute, that nature has labeled \"inte11igence.\" This is aH the more apparent when we realize rhar all the matter in our bodies, large or sma11, has been de­ signed with intelligence as a built-in feature. DNA itseIf, alrhough acknowledged as rhe chemical mastermind of the body, is made up of essentially the same ,basic building blocks as the neurotransmitters it manufactures and regulates. DNA is like a brick facrory that is also made out of bricks. (The great Hungarian mathematician John von Neu­ mann, besides being a founder of the modern computer, was interested in robots of aH rypes. He once invented, on paper, a truly íngenious machine, a robot thar could build robots identical ro itseIf-in other words, a self-reproducing machi ne. Our DNA has accomplished the same thing on a grand scale, since the human body is nothing more than variants of DNA built by DNA.) You may find it easy ro think of DNA, wirh bíllions of genetic bits, as an intelligent molecule; certainly it must be smarter than a simple molecule like sugar. How smart can sugar be? But DNA is really just srrings of sugar, amines, and other simple components. If these are nor \"smart\" to begin with, then DNA couldn't become smart just by putting more of them together. Following this line of reasoning, why isn't the carbon or hydrogen atom in the sugar also smart? Perhaps it is. As we shall see, if inteHigence is present in the body, it has to come from somewhere, and that somewhere may be everywhere. lf we follow the next step of che neurotransmitter story, we find our­ selves faced with another quantum leap in complications, but surpris­ ingly, the relaríon between mind and matter acrually begins to clear up. 61"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"QUANTCM HEALING The areas of rhe brain thar mediare our emorions-rhe amygdala and the hypothalamus, which is also known as \"rhe brain's brain\"-were both found to be particularly rich in all rhe subsrances in the neurotransmir­ rer group.

At rhis poinr rhere was seill a rather well­ defined division between chemicals rhat jumped rhe between brain cells and those that rraveled from the brain down the bloodstream.

Jusr when science thought it could isolare brain chemicals and catego­ rize rheir sites, the body cropped up wirh its own complication. Re­ searchers at rhe Narional Institute of Mental Healrh found receprors in equal abundance at oeher sires outside the brain. Searting in the early 1980s, receprors for neurotransmitters and neuropeptides were discov­ ered on cells in rhe immune system called monocyres. \"Braín\" receprors on white cells in the blood?-it would be hard ro exaggerate the signifi­ canee of this discovery. In the pasr, it was thought rhar the central nervous syscem alone relayed messages ro the body, rarher like a compli­ cated telephone system connecting the brain ro all the organs it wanted ro \"talk\" to. In this scheme, the neurons function like telephone lines conveying the brain's signals-that is theÍr unique function, shared by no other system in the physiology. Now ir was seen thar rhe brain does not just send impulses traveling in straight Enes down rhe axons, or rrunks, of the neurons; it freely circulates intelligence throughour rhe body's entire inner space. Unlike the neurons, which are fixed in place along rhe nervous system, the monocytes of the immune system travel through the bloodsrream, giv­ ing them access ro every other ceH in the body. Outfitted with a vocabulary to mirror the nervous system's in its complexity, the immune 62"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"MESSENGERS FROM INNER SPACE system apparently sends and receives messages that are just as díverse. In fact, if being happy, sad, thoughtful, excited, and so on all require the production of neuropeptides and neurotransmitters in our brain cells, then the immune cells must also be happy, sad, thoughtful, excited­ indeed, they must be able to express the fuH range of \"words\" that neurons do. Monocytes can be thought of in effect as circulating neu­ rons. With this one discovery, the concept of the intelligent ceH took on full-f1edged reality. One kind of localized intelligence was already well known, that possessed by the DNA in every cell. Since Watson and Crick mapped the structure of DNA in the early 1950s, investigation had proved that this remarkable, almost infinitely complex molecule encoded aH the information necessary to create and sustain human life. But the intelligence of genes was seen prímarily as fixed, because DNA itself is the stablest chemical in the body, and thanks to that stability, each of us is able to inherit genetic traits from our parents-blue eyes, curly hair, facial patterns, et cetera-and preserve them intact to pass on to our children. The know-how carried by the neurotransmitters and neuropeptides represented something else altogether: the winged, f1eeting, sentient in­ telligence of the mind. The wonder is that these \"ínteHígent\" chemícals are not only made by the brain, whose tunction is to thínk, bur by the immune system, whose prímary role is to protect us from disease. From the standpoint of a brain chemist, this sudden expansion of messenger molecules adds a new order of complexity to his work. Bur for us, the discovery of \"f1oating\" intelligence confirms the model of the body as a river. We needed a material basis for claiming that íntelligence f10ws all through us, and now we have it. Anyone can see that his mind is fi11ed with a bewildering f100d of impressions that are far too amorphous to pin down. To describe it, psychology is reduced to equally amorphous terms like the famous phrase stream 01 consciolisness. Today, as if to fi11 that stream with water you can actually see and touch, brain researchers have found cascades of 63"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"QUANTCM HEALING brain chemicals. But unlike a stream, these cascades have no banks; they flow anywhere and everywhere. They never cease this flow, either, for the smallest fraction of a second. A brain scientist in effect stops time to examine a cascade' s components. The chemicals he wants to find are extremely minute-it took three hundred thousand sheep brains to yield a single milligram of the molecule the brain uses to stimulate the thy­ roid. Nor are the ceH receptors easy to grasp. They constandy dance on the sutface of the cell walls and change their shape to receive new messages; any one cell may contain hundreds or even thousands of sites, only one or two of which can be analyzed at a time. Science learned more about brain chemistry in the last fifteen years than it knew in all of previous history, but we are aH still like foreigners trying to learn En­ glish from scraps of paper found in the street. No one has yet been able to grasp how the cascade of chemicals exactly patterns itself to do all the things a mind can do. Memory, recollection, dreaming, and all the other everyday activities of the mind remain a profound mystery as far as their physical mechanics is concerned. But now we know that the mind and body are like parallel universes. Any­ thíng that happens in the mental universe must leave tracks in the physical one. Recently brain researchers have found a way to photograph a thought's tracks in 3-D, like a hologram. The procedure, known as (positron-emission tomography), is done by injecting the bloodstream with glucose whose carbon molecules have been tagged with radioiso­ topes. Glucose is the brain's sole food, which ir uses much faster than do ordinary tissues. Therefore, when the injected glucose reaches the brain, its marker molecules of carbon can be picked out as the brain uses them, and thus pictured in three dimensions on a monitor, much the same way a CAT scan is produced. Watching these marker molecules shift around while the brain thinks, scientists saw that each distinct event in the universe of mind-such as a sensation of pain or a strong memory­ triggers a new chemical pattern in the brain, not just at a si te but 64"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"MESSENGERS FROM INNER SPACE at several. The image looks different for every thought, and if one could extend the portrait to be full-Iength, there is no doubt that the whole body changes at the same time, thanks to the cascades of neurotransmÍt­ ters and related messenger molecules. As you see it right now, your body is the physical picture, in 3-D, of what you are thinking. This remarkable fact escapes our notice for sev­ eral reasons. One is that the physical outline of the body does not change drasticaHy with every thought. Even so, the whole body quite obviously projects thoughts. \\'X7e literally read other people's minds from the con­ stant play of their facial expressions; withour marking ir, we also register the thousandfold gestures of body language as a sign of their moods and intentions toward us. Films made by sleep laboratories disclose that we change position dozens of times during the night, obeying commands from the brain that we are unconscious of. Secondly, we don't see our bodies as projected thoughts because many physical changes that thinking causes are unnoticeable. They involve minute alterations of ceH chemistry, body temperature, electrical charge, blood pressure, and so on, which do nor register on our focus of atten­ tion. You can be assured, however, that the body is fluid enough to mirror any mental event. Nothing can move without moving the whole. The latest discoveries in neurobiology build an even stronger case for the parallel universes of mind and body. When researchers looked further, beyond the nervous system and the immune system, they began to dis­ cover the same neuropeptides and receptors for them in other organs, such as the intestines, kidneys, stomach, and heart. There 1S every expec­ tation of finding them elsewhere, too. This means that your kidneys can \"think,\" in the sense that they can produce the identical neuropeptides found in the brain. Their receptor sires are not simply sticky patches. They are questions waiting for answers, framed in the language of the chemical universe. It is very likely that if we had the whole dictionary and not just our few scraps, we would find that every ceH speaks as fluently as we do. 65"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"QUANTUM HEALING Inside us, the questions and answers go on forever. Just by ir sel f, a single gland like the thyroid has so much to say to the brain, to Íts fellow endocrine glands, and through them to all the body, that its cascade of conversation influences dozens of vital functions, such as growth, metabolic rate, and much more. How fast you think, how tall you are, and the dimensions of your eyes, for example, all depend in part on advice from the thyroid. We can safely condude, then, that mind is not confined to the brain by sorne neat division set up for our own convenience. Mind is projected everywhere in inner space. One of the most forward-looking and accomplished researchers in the field of brain chemistry, Dr. Candace Pert, director of the brain bio­ chemistry division at the National Institute of Mental Health, has pointed out that ir is quite arbirrary to say that a biochemicallike DNA or a neurotransmitter belongs to the body rather than the mind. DNA is almost as much sheer knowledge as it is matter. Dr. Pert refers to the entire mind-body system as a \"network of information,\" shifting the emphasis away from the gross level of matter toward the subtler level of knowledge. Is there really any reason to keep mind and body apart at all? In her own writings, Pert prefers to use one term for both-bodymind. If this word sticks, it will dearly indicate that a wall has come crashing down. Pert does not have all of medical science behind her yet, but that may change very quickly. It is becoming dearer every day that the mind and body are amazingly alike. Insulin, a hormone always identified with the pancreas, is now known to be produced by the brain also, just as brain chemicals like transferon and CCK are produced by the stomach. This shows that our neat division of the body into nervous system, endocrine system, digestive system, and so on is only partially right and may soon be outmoded. Ir has now been absolutely proved that the same neurochemicals influence the whole bodymind.

Sorne drugs have a bewilder­ ing number of side effects. lf 1 consult my Phy.rician'.r De.rk Re/erence, which comprehensively Iists the medicarions that a doctor can prescribe, 1 can find page after page under the listing for corticosteroids. The most familiar corticosteroid (or juSt steroid) is corrisone, but the whole family is widely prescribed to treat burns, allergies, arthritis, postoperative ín­ flammation, and dozens of other condítions. If you didn't know about receptor sites, steroids would appear highly peculiar. Let us say that 1 prescribe steroids to a woman who is suffering from a difficult case of arthriris. The steroids would bring down the inflammation in her joints dramaricaUy, but then a host of strange rhings mighr happen. She could begin to complain of being farigued and depressed. Abnormal fatty deposits might begin ro show under her skin, and her blood vessels could become so brittle that she would develop large bruises that are very slow to heal. Whar could link these entirely divergent symproms? The answer líes ar rhe level of rhe receprors. Corricosteroids replace sorne of the secretions of the adrenal cortex, a yellowish pad on the top of the adrenal glands. At the same time, they suppress the other adrenal hormones, as well as secrerions from the pituitary gland, which is 10­ cated in rhe brain. As soon as ir 1S given, the steroid rushes in and floods all the receptors throughout the body that are \"listening\" for a certain message. When a receptor beco mes filled, what foUows is not a simple acrion. The ceU can interpret the adrenal \"message\" in many ways, depending on how long the 5ite stays filled. In this case, the receptor stays filled indefinitely. (The fact thar other messages are not being received is important, as i5 the los5 of innumerable connections with the other endocrine glands.) The ceU can exhibit extreme reacrions from filling one receptor. By analogy, look at a moth hanging under the eaves on a summer night. In 67"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"QUANTUM HEALING a male moth, the fuzzy antennae on its head are actually receptor sites that have extended outside the body. As the sun sets, the moth waits for a signal from a female moth in his vicinity, who is emitting a special molecule called a pheromone. Moths are tiny creatures, and the number of pheromones they can send through the air is infinitesimal compared to the total volume of air and its immense freight of pollen, dust, water, and other pheromones being secreted by animals of every kind, inelud­ ing mano One would hardly suspect that two moths can communicate over any sizable distance. But when a single pheromone molecule lands on the male's antenna, his behavior is transformed. He swiftly homes in on the female, begins an elaborate courtship ritual in the air, and proceeds with the act of mating. Biologically speaking, the only thing that causes this compli­ cated behavior is one molecule. When I give steroids to an arthritis patient, trillions of molecules and receptor sites are involved. That is why the blood vessels, skin, brain, fat cells, and so on all exhibit their differeot responses. If I go ro my desk reference, the long-term consequences of staying on steroids inelude diabetes, osteoporosis, suppression of the immune system (making a person more susceptible to infections and cancer), peptic ulcers, internal bleeding, elevated cholesterol, and much more. One might even inelude death among these side effects, because taking steroids for a long period causes the adrenal cortex ro shrivel (a:n example of how an organ will atrophy if not used). If tne steroid is withdrawn too quickly, the adrenal gland does not have time ro regenerate. The patieot is left with inade­ quate defenses against stress, which adrenal hormones help to buffer. He can go ro the dentist ro have a wisdom tooth extracted, a stress that is usually well within the normallimits, but deprived of adrenal hormones, he can go ioto shock. A tooth extraction could even kill him. Take all of these details rogether, and what you see is that steroids can cause literally anything to happen. They may be the immediate cause or just the first domino-the distinction makes little difference to the pa­ tient. To her, there is no difference between the osteoporosis caused by 68"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"MESSENGERS PROM INNER SPACE steroids and the \"real thing.\" The same holds for depression, diabetes, or death. A single messenger has caused them aH. In truth there is no such thing as a single messenger-each one is a strand in the body's web of intelligence. Touch one strand, and the whole web trembles. 1 realize that this makes drugs look much more dangerous than we had thought, even in an era that is obsessed with cataloging medical disasters. We are used to a more limited idea of what a side effect touch of the bitter with the sweet, like the thorn that comes with the rose or the hangover with the botde of wine. Instead, a side effect balloons out into anything the body can think of. Generally we are protected from serious harm because the body reacts along certain nar­ row lines. A patient who takes an aspirin might experience bleeding in his stomach lining but not a heart attack. However, every ceH in che body has a wide latitude for action-it is a conscious being who under­ stands the world around it. The side effects in my desk reference are just the ones that have been observed so faro I recently read a srory of an internist who was baffled when one of his patients, a man in his late seventies, suddenly began ro act paranoid. The man was obsessed by the idea that robbers were going to break into his house, and he bought a gun to keep under his pillow. One night he terrified his wife by leaping out of bed at three in the morning, running downstairs with his pistol, and searching wildly for the intruders he thought were behind every chair. Knowing that he was hallucinating dangerously, the wife rushed him to the internist. The patient had no prior history of mental illness and was on no medications other than digitalis, which he took to stabilize his heart rhyrhm. Considering the patient's age, a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease seemed imminent. However, the internist consulted a neurologist ro read the patient's CAT sean. Nothing abnormal appeared on it, but the neurologist said, \"1 bet this man is hallucinating from the digitalis.\" In thirty years of practice, the internist, who 1S also a professor of medicine in New York City, had never seen this side effect, although he had heard of it, barely. He reduced the digitalis, and within ten days the patient returned ro 69 --_ ...... - --_ .. ."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"--- ----------------- QUANTUM HEALING normal. It seems quite freakish that a highly specific heart medication should lead to insanity. If this patient had hallucinated a few decades ago, when the desk reference did not list such a bizarre side effect, no doctor would have believed it; today, the internist believed it only after an extensive battery of tests ruled out everything else. What this case teaches is that you can never tell what the body is thinking, or where. It is entirely possible that the man's heart went insane, in the sen se that it toppled the first domino and triggered the onset of his paranoia. The brain and the heart share many of the same receptor sites; more important, they share the same DNA, which implies that a heart cell can behave like a brain cell, a liver cell, or any other kind of cell. After open-heart surgery, patients sorne times have psychotic breaks and begin hallucinating. Flat on their backs, groggy from depri­ vation of oxygen to the brain, and locked into the blank sterility of an intensive care unit, they suddenly think that little green men are march­ ing up and down the sheets-such is the accepted explanation for their episodes. Could ir be that in fact it is the heart that is hallucinating here? Simply the trauma of the surgery could make the heart think that reality has run wild, and that is what ir tells the brain. The discovery of neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, and messenger mole­ cules of all kinds has vastly extended our concept of intelligence. But if every cell has an endless number of messages ir can send and receive, ir is also clear that only a small fraction are activated at one time. Who or what controls the messages? That turns out to be an explosive question. In a chemistry lab, reactions will run automatically as soon as the experi­ ment starts; ir is just a matter of mixing one, chemical with another. Yet, someone has to take the chemicals off the shelf to begin wirh. Medicine has tradirionally preferred to ignore this fact as it applies to the human body. Now we see that wirh thousands of chemicals on its shelf, a cell has not only to choose sorne, mix them together, and analyze the results. It has to make the chemicals in the first place, finding 70"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"MESSENGERS FROM INNER SPACE thousands of ways to create new molecules out of basically a handful of elements-carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. To do that requires a mind. So, by following the story of neuropeptides, we have ultimately arrived at a dramatic shift in worldview. For the first time in the history of science, mind has a visible scaffold to stand upon. Before this, science declared that we are physícal machines that have somehow learned to think. Now it dawns that we are thoughts that have learned to create a physical machine. 71 "},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"5 Ghosts of Memory Recendy a young woman in her late twenties, a part-time model, carne to my office in Boston. After years of hiding the fact that she had an eating disorder, her family had finally persuaded her to seek treatment. Since adolescence she had been obsessed with her figure, and over time this concern had become more and more abnormal until ir blossomed into a double sickness, anorexia nervosa and bulimia. Looking at this attractive, bright woman, who to all appearances was normal, 1 was not lulled into thinking that her problem was easy. De­ spite extensive research and publicity in recent years, both anorexia and bulimia remain highly puzzling. Why should young women, many of them well educated and from high-income backgrounds, nurture an uncontrollable obsession with diet and weight? Anorexics develop afear of food and a horror at the act of eating. Confined to a rigidly ritualized pattern of behavior that leads them to voluntary starvation, they will deny that they are too thin, even to the point of death. The companion disease, bulimia, can be separate from anorexia or can 73"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"QUANTUM HEALING coexist with it, as in this woman's case. In bulimia, the horror of food takes a weird tum in the form of bingeing. The secret food binges that a bulimic goes on are often enormous-anywhere from 2,000 to 50,000 calories at a sitting (2,000 calories is enough food to sustain a vigorous 150-pound person for a day). This huge amount of food is then vomíted back up, causing tremendous stress on the digestive system and the body as a whole. This particular woman's disorder had advanced to the point where she was vomiting every day in order to maintain the normal but still low weight needed for her work. The very sight of a dessert, she told me, caused her to break out in a cold sweat and sent her heart racing. She was extremely intelligent and listened closely when 1 said that at the root of her disorder was a mistake in her self-image. Because our 1S obsessed with the ideal of thinness, many women try to Uve up tO an inner image of their bodies that is símply not ríght for theír physical makeup. In her case, however, the image was not saying, \"1 have to be (hin.\" Ir was saying, \"1 can never be (hin enough.\" To explain this paradoxical illness, one has to drop the distinction between mind and body and think of one system, the \"bodymind.\" This is because an eating disorder is a holistic disease, the ctuel opposite of holistic health. In anorexics, the distorted idea, \"1 must be thinner,\" takes over the bodymind like a malevolent and elusive phantom. Even after long hospitalization and exhaustive psychiatric treatment, rhe pa­ tient rarely eats like a normal persono A normal person would have to sttuggle to srarve himself--once rhe body went a certain point of deprivarion, its hunger signals would take precedence over everything else in the bodymind, until the desire for food became overpowering. For someone wirh anorexia, the same rhing happens but in reverse-the compulsion to avoid earing ís all bur irresistible. As 1 was talking abour this, the young woman looked at me sorrow­ fully and whispered, \"So there really are such things as ghosts, aren't there?\" 1 was startled, and after a moment I answered, \"It's true, but this"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"GHOSTS OF MEMORY ghost can be exorcised.\" What we were talking about is a ghost of memory, a memory picked up and stored in the body. Memory sounds very abstract, while food is very concrete. But the memory is far more real in this case. Whether a person is compulsively too thin or too fat does not depend primarily on how much food he takes in. This is true for conditions that are less bizarre than anorexia. For centuries, obesity has been seen as a flaw in character, which religious ages caUed the sin of gluttony. The implication was that if fat people were just srrong enough and used a lirde self-discipline, they could be as thin as the rest of us simply by earing less. Now it is generally recognized thar for the chronically obese, diets do not solve the problem (jusr as, at the opposite extreme, filling an an­ orexic with food does not solve that problem), because the brain of a fat person is actually sending out overpowering signals for too much food. How these messages are triggered and how to turn them around are open guestions. Unless sorne degree of control is gained at a very deep level, obese people can spend their whole lives forcing themselves to diet, a self-defeating tactic that only makes the mental distortion worse. The loss of 10 pounds is registered in their brains as a famine, and the next time food is offered, the brain will not stop until 15 pounds is put back on, adding an extra 5 as a safety margin against the next famine. Obese people have been known to gain weight on diets where no extra calories are offered beyond the bare minimum to sustain basal metabolismo The reason for this is that the brain can acrually alter the merabolism in such a way that the calories are stored as fat instead of being burned up as fue!' No one knows why the intellect is so powerless to change these distor­ tions in self-image. The ghost gets stronger the more you fight it. Al­ though anorexics will persistendy deny that they have a problem, once the doctor pierces this defense, it is clear that a profound split in the bodymind is involved, with one part of the system struggling to main­ tain rationality while another sends up wildly irrational impulses. 1 once spent an hout counseling another anorexic woman in her thir­"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"QUANTUM HEALING who weighed less than 80 pounds, had given birth at that weight, and was going into rapid physical dedine (10 percent of anorexics die from deliberate starvation or from causes related ro malnutrition). Her case was made particularly bizarre by the fact that she loved nothing better than going home to cook for her large ltalian fami1y, do1ing out pasta and olíve oí1 to a dozen brothers, sisters, cousíns, aunts, and undes. Our conversatíon had been rather eerily reasonable untíl she suddenly snapped at me, \"Do you really think you can talk me out of this? I already understand the whole thing perfectly, you know, and it hasn't done me a damn bit of good. Leave me alone. This 1S how I have to eat.\" She glared at me with unconcealed hosti1ity. \"Tell me,\" she de­ manded, \"how many people do you cure of smoking by talking to them? They know what nicotine does and the danger of 1ung cancer and all that. It doesn't do them any good ro talk, and you won't do me any good, ei ther.\" I sat back, feeling the cold blasts of despair and the hot blasts of hatred in what she had said. How horrible to have to líve with both, in a weird, poisonous tangle. \"The real question isn't whether I can help you, is it?\" I pointed out after she calmed down. \"It's whether you can help yourself.\" She started to soften just a little, and I added gently, \"You know, you're not hurting me by not eating. You're not hurting anyone real at aH, but someone who is an image. It is all inside you, and that is the part that is so tough, both for you as a person and for me as your doctor.\" This story does not have an immediate happy ending. Certainly my patient was right about the futility of talking about her disease. She remains a very hostile, confused person, and my best hope is that joining a peer group with other anorexics and bulimics will help. To get her to exorcíse the ghost of memory, she will have to reach the level where the ghost lives. Untíl the ghost is gone, patients like her do not that they have a disease-they are their disease. I mean this quite literally. What happens to you when you see a snake and jump out of its way? The frightened thought, Look out, a snake! 76"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"GHOSTS OF MEMORY comes to mind at exactly the same instant as adrenaline makes you jump. Usually the thought and the action are so closely tied together that the conscÍous thought doesn't even have time to say íts words-you just see the snake and you jump. So there is no space where you can drive in a wedge between the two. In the case of an anorexíc, the mere sight of food sets up a wave of revulsion. Perhaps the sight and smell of a fresh loaf of bread sends the thought, Ugh, 1 can't eat this, while at the same time the stomach turns, the salivary glands dry up, and the whole diges­ tíve tract ís alerted not to function. Naturally, this 1S a twisted reaction, but the thought and the reaction come packaged together, and there 1S no place to drive in a wedge between them. What is at work he re is something we can calI an \"im­ pulse of intelligence,\" which means a thought and a molecule tied to­ gether, like a two-sided coin. Once the impulse starts to rise, there is no turning it back. The thought is the moIecule; the molecule is the thought. At the time it takes place, an impulse of intelligence consti­ tutes the patient's whole inner reality. When an anorexic is repelled by food, her reaction is all there is (at least for that instant)--she is her disease at the momento The same holds true for the obese person trying to resist food, the smoker trying to resist another cigarette, and so on. You cannot change a thought after you have had it-the entire inner struggle of such patients is totaHy futile. But there is another component to an impulse of intelligence besides the thought and the molecule. The third component is silence; this is the unseen component. Like aH of us, the anorexic must fetch thoughts from the region that lies deeper than thought, and it is there that a cute might be found. The anorexic's dreaded realizatíon, 1 am my disease, may be tme, but it is not the final truth. If the anorexic could transcend her compulsions, looking on them without involvement, her disease would end. Becoming a silent witness would be enough to disentangle her from the ghost. Archimedes said that if he had a lever long enough and a place to stand on, he could move the Earth-presumably, he would have to stand in outer space.

No one has a spare nervous system hanging in the closet in case his primary one gets strange ideas. Sadly but inevitably, there is no place outside to stand on. Without realizing it, we count very heavily on the fact that our thoughts will trigger the right chemicals in our bodies; the mind and its messen­ ger molecules are automatically and perfectly matched. But this process can break down, and then the resulting confusion is like running two programs on the same computer-when the input is scrambled, it is no wonder that the printout, your body, becomes garbled. For example, one of the most ambiguous drugs ever devised is Valium. Valium belongs to a class of chemicals called benzodiazepines, which are used as both tranquilizers and sleeping pills. These substances were greeted in their day as revolutionary. Their predecessors, the barbitu­ rates, had many notorious drawbacks: they were highly addictive; they induced poor-quality sleep because they blocked REM, or dream sleep; and overdoses could prove fatal. Valium and its relatives, on the other hand, produced better sleep with less hangover, were much harder to overdose on, and at first seemed nonaddictive. At the height of its im­ mense popularity, Valium was said to account for one-quarter of all new prescriptions written in America. Now it is known that Valium is itself addictive, that it produces sleep irregularities of its own (interfering with the third and fourth stages of deep, dreamless sleep), and that serious withdrawal symptoms occur after prolonged use. rf you look at the level of the receptors on the cell wall, none of this is surprising, because Valium acts by outcompeting the body's own neurochemicals and taking over their receptor sites. This kind of interference would perhaps be advantageous if Valium competed only with the neuropeptides responsible for causing the feelings of anxi­ ety (called octadecaneuropeptides). But the calming effect of the drug does not come by itself; Valium confuses the nervous system as a whole. Moreover, it was recently discovered that the monocytes of the immune system also are attracted to Valium. So when a doctor gives what he 78"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"GHOSTS OF MEMORY thinks is a sleeping pi11 or a tranquilizer, he is affecting the immune system at the same time, adding more confusion at the level of the receptors. No one knows if this has caused any harm, largely because the finding about the immune system is too new. In alllikelihood, we will discover that nature has already provided our bodies with an exact internal ana­ logue to Valium, which means that we are clumsily reproducing some­ thing that already exists in neady perfect formo lf I ask myself whether 1 like the idea of plugging the same chemical into my immune ceIls every day, in the indiscriminate fashion that Valium was doled out to millions of patients, primarily women, for thirty years, the answer is obvious. The immune ce11s have a reason for each receptor; they use them to think, act, perceive, and respond in precise ways. A person uses the same two eyes to view the whole world; a ceH, however, has a different eye for each thing it needs to see. In other words, a constantly filled receptor renders the cell blind to one specific thing. At a time when the incidence of many cancers, such as breast cancer, is sti11 rising, sending unknown messages into the immune system seems very risky. Currently there is a \"chemical revolution\" under way in the treatment of mental disease, and it seems as miraculous as Valium did thirty years Doctors now widely give theír mental patients mínd-alteríng, or psychotropic, drugs to clear up the overt symptoms of their sickness, maínly depression, manía, and hallucínations. The symptoms are often relieved, sometimes quite dramatically and suddenly, although many patients cannot tolerate the mental numbness and fatigue that are com­ mon side effects (not that the side dIects are simple: certain antidepres­ sants can make the patíent's depression worse for the first few weeks, or swíng it in the opposite direction until it rurns into wild mania). Critics of drug therapies call them \"chemical lobotomies\" and charge that they strip the patient of his human dignity.

Sti11, the success ín this field implies that drugs will be used to cure schizophrenia and depression altogether, if not today, then in the future. A \"cured\" schizophrenic does not yet exist through chemical means. This is because there is more to being normal than not having ha11ucina­ tions. Once you suppress a sehizophrenie's bizarre visions or the strange voiees he hears in his head, you do not find a normal person faeing you, but a sheU. Altering the ehemieal level of dopamine, even if it eould be done a hundred times better than it is done today, will nor lead to a cure. The reason is contained in the lesson learned from the neuro­ transmitters themselves: for every ehemieal breakthrough, there 1s also a chemical barrier. The good news about neurotransmitters is that they are material. A thought, whether sane or mad, is hard to grasp because ir is so intangi­ ble; it is not something you can touch or feel. The neurotransmitters, however, are certainly tangible, although they are extremely tiny and often short-lived. Ir is the neurotransmitter's role to match up wirh a thought. To do thar, its molecules must be just as flexible as thoughts, just as fleeting, elusive, changeable, and faint.

A cell wall can be as barren of lily pads as a pon? in winter, or as crammed as one in full flower in June. The only thing constant about a receptor is its unpredictability, Re­ searchers recently discovered, for example, that a neurotransmitter called imipramine is produced abnormally in the brains of depressed people. While looking for the distribution of imipramine receptors, they were startled to find them not juSt on the brain cells but on skin cells. Why should the skin create receptors for a \"mental molecule\"? What did these ski n receptors have to do with depression? One plausible answer is that a depressed person is depressed every­ where-he has asad brain, sad skin, sad liver, and so on. (Likewise, researchers have examined patients who complain of feeling jittery all the time and discovered abnormally high levels of two chemicals, epi­ nephrine and norepinephrine, in their brains and adrenal glands. How­ ever, high concentratíons were then found in their bIood platelets, meaning that they had \"jittery bIood cells,\" too.) Ir has been frustrating for doctors to realize how complex the whole business 1S becoming. Hopes for a quick cure of schizophrenia, depres­ sion, alcoholism, drug addiction, and other disorders were dashed in the mid-1970s, just a few years after the original endorphins had been iso­ lated in 1973. Now the chemical barrier 1S stronger than ever, as the true flexíbility of the messenger molecules 1S being divined. Thinking about this problem, 1 have to ask myself a deeper question: Can a drug really exorc1se the ghost of memory? My medical experience says no-I have seen too many depressed patients who were \"cured\" by drugs and yet who sti11 radiate a feeling of hollow sickness. Instead of trusting drugs, one needs to find out how the patient's sick memory got into his chemical system to begin with. For it 1S absolutely cIear that the nonmaterial memory is there. It may be taking a ride on a molecule, but its life does not depend on that. following case serves as an example.

U nlike most soldiers, Walter had no reason to quit when he got home. Eventu­ ally the police caught him, and by order of the court he carne under my care at the V.A. hospital for his addiction. Our main focus was simply to detoxify Walter. In the normal course of things, he would have passed through the revolving door and back out onto the street. But while he was staying in the hospital 1 began visiting with him. It was clear that he was an exceptional persono Despite his desperation, he did not seem eaten up by inner violence, and he was courageously willing to fight his habito Walter made friends with me. He also made quick progress medically, and ayear after detox he was still holding a steady job and talking eagerly about the normal life he longed for and loved. Then a strange incident occurred. One day Walter's car broke down, forcing him to take the subway to work, which he hadn't done in several months. He got on the train to Dorchester, an old, clattery line with screeching rails. He hated the noise and couldn't manage to ignore it. The fan was broken, and it was July. Within a few minutes of being shut up in the hot, stifling compartment, he found the train intolerable. He went from feeling uneasy to agitated to extremely agitated, and by the time he got off he was in a completely wild, irrational state. Nothing he could do would make his agitation go away. By the time 1 saw him, two days later, Walter was completely hooked on heroin again, and this time he had hardly any will to recover. What happened to this man? A chemical explanation for the train incident is not sufficient. 1 keep thinking of him wearing his pinstriped business suit, confidently outfitted for a new life, but then having to step onto the same train that he had ridden when he was troubled and ad­ dicted.

Where did the cravíng híde out for ayear before it returned? In sorne way that medicine is jusr beginníng ro unravel, a cell's memory is able to outlive the ceU írself. Ar any point in the bodymind, two things come together-a bit of informatíon and a bít of matter. Of the two, the information has a longer life span than the solid matter it is matched wíth. As the atoms of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen swirl through our DNA, líke birds of passage that alight only ro migrate on, the bit of matter changes, yet there is always a structure waiting for the next atoms. In fact, DNA never budges so much as a thousandth of a millimeter in its precise structure, because the genomes-the bits of information in DNA -remember where everything goes, all 3 bi11ion of them. This fact makes us realize that memory must be more permanent than matter. What is a ceU, then? It 1S a memory that has built sorne matter around itself, forming a specific pattern. Your body is just the place your mem­ ory calls home. This conclus10n is difficult to argue with, in light of all that we now know about forms of chemical intelligence, but medicine srubbornly resists these implications. For instance, it is gene rally believed that peo­ pIe who are addicted to alcohol, cigarettes, or drugs have a \"chemical addiction,\" meaning that their ceUs are hooked on nicotine, alcohol, heroin, et cetera. But if you look at the leve! of the body's chemistry, you find that heroin or nicotine fits into the same receptors on the ceH walls that everyone has. An addict does not have receptors rhat exhibit abnor­ mal cravings. By analogy, a fat man's stomach lining isn't addicted to food-it just accepts what is given to it. The truth seems ro be that the cell's memory for the addictive substance is what is hooked, and it keeps creating distorted cells that reflect its weakness. In other words, an addiction is a distorted memory. It is just our material bias that keeps looking ro the cell. (These pernicious memories may be inherited, since addiction runs in families, but even if there is a specific \"addiction gene,\" one is forced to consider the nonmaterial conditions that caused the DNA to express 83"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"QUANTUM HEALlNG the gene.

There was an intermission in this particular show, and when he waIked into the lobby he was seized by an almost uncontrolla­ ble urge to smoke. \"You see, when l was a in Bogotá,\" he told me, \"we used to smoke in the lobby between movies. All l did was step back into that scene, and the urge to smoke carne back in a flash. 1 found myself in front of the cigarette machine fumbling for change, and only by clutch­ ing myself inside and repeating, 'rhis is crazy, you're a cardiologist,' was 1 abIe to resist.\" Even so, he had to rush out of the theater and now wonders ruefuIly how the movie ended.

Think back to the stress reactíon where a car backfires and adrenaline is released into your bloodstream. We noted that as pan of the overa11 reacríon, the stomach and intestines stop digesting food. As long as the stress reactíon is temporary, this is a compIetely normal and correct thing for the body to do, and it happens automatically. However, if you choose to stay in an environment where there is constant stress, the time must come when your body wanrs ro returo to digesting food. Then a conflict w111 arise, because the stress reaction will still be saying \"no\" to the stomach while another part of the brain (probably the hypothalamus) is saying \"yes.\" The resulting tutmoil des 84 -.- --~---- ---.------- ______ .w.w ••• _. ___ ..................... ___ _ "},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"GHOSTS OF MEMORY the stomaeh in knots and ehurns up the intestines.

It is known, however, that a key step is taken when the immune system secretes certain anti-cancer agents called interleukins, a class of proteins that resemble hormones. Our immune cells produce in­ terleukins in many situations-cuts, bruises, infections, internal tissue damage, and allergies all call them forth. (The name \"interleukin\" was chosen because researchers originally discovered that these chemicals send signals between leukocytes, or white cells.) As they naturally occur, interleukins exist in minute quantity; there­ fore, they are prohibitively expensive to duplicate commercially. Despite this obstacle, researchers have recently extracted large amounts of inter­ leukin-2 (IL-2) and transfused it into about 450 patients with advanced skin and kidney cancers (the current price runs as high as $80,000 for a single course of treatment). Sorne patients, from 5 percent to 10 percent, have had dramatic regressions of their tumors via this therapy, at the cost of severe side effects, which have killed several people. The question of the IL-2's long-term influence on the rest of the body remains unan­ swered. Despite their drawbacks, interleukins are on the verge of becoming the next promising cancer cure, as interferon, a close chemical relation, was the cure of the 1970s. Already, teams of genetic engineers are racing to figure out how to manufacture interleukins on a marketable scale. With a sinking feeling, one senses that another false hope is being born. Why is the promise never fulfilled? Medicine knows hundreds of facts about interleukins, such as that \"the alpha and beta strains of interleu­ kin-1 are only 26 percent homologous at the amino-acid level of their genes\"; or that both bind to receptors \"with high affinity in the 10-10 molar range.\" When one penetrates the jargon, these are not insignifi­ cant facts. Yet they say literally nothing about interleukin's intelligence, which is the salient point. If interleukins \"know\" when and where to fight cancer, then it is not their molecules that should interest us, but some­ thing invisible-the cell's ability to recognize that a cancerous memory 86"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"GHOSTS OF MEMORY is present and needs to be eradicated. This cannot be injected into the body. The body's war against cancer pits intelligence against intelli­ gence.

In the deepest sense, that 1S why 1 have no faith in the \"magic bullet\" approach. Penicillin was an effectlve bullet because one's aim did not have to be at all accurate; once an antibiotic is in the bloodstream, it automatically attacks the cell walls of bacteria and destroys them.

I can give him radiation and call it a therapy, but in 95 percent of the cases it is litde more than a short reprieve-perhaps he and I go through with it just to fend off the despair of having no treatment at all. Other common cancers, such as melanomas, belong in this category. We desperately need a medicine without bullets. If you look at in­ terleukins free of a material bias, their most important attributes are invisible. Interleukins are being produced by the immune cell's DNA in exact dosages, combinations, and timing, all of which are more impor­ tant than the molecule itself. A white cell engulfing an invader, such as a bacterium or cancer cell, looks deceptively simple under the microscope, like a drop of amber surrounding a tiy. In actuality, there is no more intricate process in the human body. An interleukin arrives on the scene at a precisely deter­ mined point in a most exacting maneuver. We may call this the \"hunt for cancer,\" but much of the immune process is highly abstracto It is conducted almost entirely by the exchange of information. Hitting the target is one of the more minor parts of the campaign. Before a macrophage, or immune cell, ever secretes any anti-cancer agent, the immune system goes through many other steps. It must first detect that a problem exists and identify it exacdy; a cancer cell is not a virus, and neither one is a bacterium. Using a class of message carriers called helper T -cells, the body notifies the rest of the immune system to become activated and starts to produce natural killer cells. To make sure that the killers do not destroy the wrong thing, the body hangs a chem­ ical nametag on the macrophages inscribed with the enemy's identity, which they can show to other cells they meet. This is just the barest outline of the immune system's initial sequence of action, which has many branches, overlappings, and unexplained convolutions. Having just fathomed the full intricacy of the immune system in the last five years, researchers like to compare it to the brain in complexity. Like the brain, the immune system has a phenomenal capacity for ab­ 88"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"GHOSTS OF MEMORY sorbing new information, learning and memorizing the identity of any new disease organism, and sorting out billions of bits of knowledge. We could just as easily say that the brain and the immune system are not like each other-they are each other, because they operate within the same chemical network. The only difference between an immune ceH and a brain is that their DNA has selected to emphasize certain aspects of Íts total knowl­ edge and suppress others. Interleukin comes very close in structure ro being a neuropeptide (the research !iterature calls it a \"hormonelíke poiypeptide\"). This means that when our emotions joín up with mole­ cules, like riders on a horse, the mounts they choose are almost identical to interleukin. For aH intents and purposes, to feel happy and to fight cancer are much the same thing at the molecular level. We couid call both of them healing messages. It is f-alse even to divide cells into senders and receivers of such messages; for although certain immune cells secrete interleukins as part of their specific role, virtual1y every ceH in the body can receive them, implying an ability to produce them as well. Perhaps this \"silent\" ability is activated in spontaneous remis­ SlOns.

The same thing happens everywhere in nature, except that we do not call it thinking. When you get to the level of atoms, the landscape is not one of solid objects moving around each other like partners in a dance, following predictable steps. Subatomic particles are separated by huge gaps, making every atom more than 99.999 percent empty space. This holds true for hydrogen atoms in the air and carbon atoms in the wood that tables are made of, as well as all the \"solid\" atoms in our cells. Therefore, everything solid, including our bodies, is proportionately as void as inter-galactic space. How could such vast reaches of emptiness, dotted at faraway intervals by specks of matter, turn into human beings? To answer that question requires a quantum perspective. By understanding the quantum, we enter into a vaster reality, spanning from quarks to galaxies. At the same time, the behavior of quantum reality turns out to be very intimate to us -indeed, the faintest shadow-line separates the human body from the cosmic body. In his monumental project to make all of physics follow a few consistent, rational laws, Isaac Newton explained narure's workings in terms of solid bodies, straight-line motion, and fixed constants that ruled all physical events. This is the model of nature as a complex billiard game, with Newton as the master player. Because matter and energy stayed within set rules, there was no need to theorize about a hidden world; everything happened aboveboard.

Whenever any mental event needs to find a physical counterpart, it works through the quantum mechanical human body. That is the secret of how the two universes of mind and matter associate with each other without mistakes. No matter how different they appear, mind and body are both soaked through with intelligence. Science tends ro be skeptical in the face of any claim that intelLigence is at work in nature (this is a strange historical anomaly, since every generation before us has accepted without question sorne kind of universal order). However, if there is nothing outside ordinary reality ro hold things and events together, then one is led to a set of impossibilities. We can see this in the law of gravity. Common sense says that two objects separated by empty space should have no connection with each other; in the jargon of physics, they occupy their own \"local reality.\" But the Earth revolves around the sun, held in its orbit by gravity, even though the two bodies are separated by a void of 93 million miles. 103 ------ .... - ----­"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"QUANTUM HEALING When he discovered this violatíon of local reality, Newton was shocked and refused to speculate on how it happens. Since then, local realíty has taken one beating after another. Light, radio waves, lasers, and all other electromagnetic forces travel through empty space; matter and anti­ matter seem ro exist in coordinated universes that have no physical contact; subatomÍc particles have spins that are matched to one another, and it doesn't matter how far apart in time and space the particles are­ spins can be matched at opposite ends of the universe. What this implies is that the commonsense idea of local reality is true only at a certain level. The whole of realíty, as explained by quanrum physics, líes deeper. A famous mathematical formula, known as Bell's theorem (after its author, the Irish physícist John Bell), holds that the reality of the universe must be nonlocal; in other words, all objects and events in the cosmos are inter-connected with one another and respond to one another's changes of state. Bell's theorem was formulated in 1964, but decades earlier, the great English astronomer Sir Arthur Eddington had anticipated inter-connectedness by saying, \"When the electro n vi­ brates, the universe shakes.\" Physicísts now inter-connectedness as a ruling principIe, along with many forms of symmetry that extend across the universe-for example, it is theorized that every black hole may be matched up somewhere with a corresponding \"white hole,\" though none has actually been observed. What kind of explanation would satisfy Bell' s requirement for a to­ tally inter-connected, nonlocal reality? It would have to be a quantum explanatíon, because if gravity is present everywhere at the same time, if black holes know what white holes are doing, and if a change of spin in one particle causes an equal but opposite change instantly in its partner somewhere in outer space, it is obvious that the information going from one place to the other is traveling faster than the speed of light. This is not permitted in ordinary reality, either by Newton or Einstein. Contemporary theorists such as British physidst, David Bohm, who has worked extensively with the implications of Bell's theorem, have had ro suppose that there is an \"invisible field\" that holds all of reality 104"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"THE QUANTUM MECHANICAL HUMAN BODY togerher, a field rhat possesses rhe property of knowing what is happen­ ing everywhere at once.

Wirhout going deeper inro these speculations, you can see thar rhe invisible field sounds very much like the underlying intelligence in DNA, and both behave very much like rhe mind. The mind has the properry of holding all our ideas in place, in a silent reservoir so ro speak, where they are precisely organized into concepts and categories. Without calling it \"thinking,\" we may be watching nature think rhrough many different channels, of which our minds are one of rhe most privileged, because the mind can create its quantum reality and experience ir at rhe same time.

Eddington once flatly stated his belief as a physicist that \"the stuff of the world is mind-stuff.\" So the quantum mechanical body, as a formation of intelligence, has a plausible place in nonlocal reality. The beauty of such a simple picture is that intelligence is simple; the complications arise when one tries to track down the incredibly complex machinery of the mind-body sysrem. The brain-wave patterns of a psy­ chotic and a poet look the same on a roll of EEG paper as it comes off I . \t the electroencephalograph, no matter how sophisticated the analysis. Thinking about the thousands of hours it would rake to scientifically describe the chemical consequences of one cell's daíly life, a neuroscien­ tist friend of mine remarked, \"You have to conclude that nature is intelligent because it's too complícated to be called anything else.\" He could just as easily have said \"too simple.\" A human brain that changes its thoughts into rhousands of chemicals every second is, after all, not so much complicated as inconceivable. In ancient India, it was supposed that intelligence existed everywhere; it was called Brahman, from rhe Sanskrir word for \"big,\" and was just like an invisible field.

Sir Arthur Eddington once affirmed that there were two reaLities that had to be known on their own terms, one of whích was trivial, the other all-important. The trivial one was the mechanistic reality investigated by science; the all-important one was rhe human reality of ordinary experience. In the scientific reality, Eddington said, Earth is a speck of matter whirling around a mediocre star, both of them cast adríft among billions of more important steUar objects.

The vast difference in scale between medicine and quantum physics safely kept the two sciences on separate ground until 1987, when a French immunologist, Jacques Benveniste, performed an expetiment that is outrageous to all nonquantum views of the world. On the sutface, the experiment began innocuously. DI. Benveniste took a common an­ tibody called IgE (standing for immunoglobulin E type) and exposed it to cettain white cells in the bIood called basophils. It is well known what happens when these two interact-the IgE antibody clamps on firmly to specific receptor sites and waits. What it is waiting for is an invading molecuIe floating by in the bloodstream that needs ro be de­ fended against. In this case, the invader ís not a germ but an antígen, a substance that causes allergies. If you are alletgic to bee sting, the molecules of bee venom would not be in yout body more than a few seconds before they triggered the IgE antibody. It in turn would set off a complex chain reaction in the ceH 112"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"NOWHERE AND EVERYWHERE that throws the body's allergic response into high gear; the basophil would releas e a chemical caUed histamine, which causes the swelling, redness, itching, and shortness of breath typieal of an allergy attaek. The mystery in allergies is that the antigens, the offending substanees enter­ ing the body, are generally harmless~-wool, pollen, dust-and yet the immune system treats them like the deadliest enemy. To find their cause, allergies have been thoroughly studied at the molecular level, and one of the results is a firm grasp of IgE. This sets the stage for Dr. Benveniste's dramatie experimento He took some human blood setum full of white eells and IgE and mixed it with a solution prepared from goat's blood thar was eertain to trigger the re­ lease of histamine. This second solution contained an anti-IgE antibody, which represents bee venom, pollen, or other antígeno When the IgE and the anti-IgE hit, the reaetíon in the test tube went off exaetly as it would in a person with abad allergy, and large amounts of histamine were produced. Benveniste then diluted the anti-IgE tenfold and added it again-still the same reaetion. He kept on diluting, time after time, and as before, about half of the IgE (40 to 60 pereent) continued to react. This was extremely surprising, beeause he was well past the Emit where the solu­ tion should be ehemieally active. He decided to dilme the anti-IgE even more, making it a hundred times weaker each time, until he knew that there was no anti-IgE at aH. His last dilution contained 1 part antíbody to 10 120 parts water; if written out, this number would be expressed as 10 followed by 120 zeroes. Using a constant called Avogadro's number, he eonfirmed mathematically that it was impossible for the water to contain a single moleeule of antibody. When he added this \"solution,\" whieh was now just distilled water, the histamine reaetion was set off with the same power as before. (The classic Humphrey Bogart movie, Yo Have and Have Not, contains the quirky Ene, \"Have you ever been stung by a dead bee?\" In this case, the bee is also invisible.)

His results were reluctantly published in the June 1988 issue of the prestigious British journal Nature. Its editors frankly declared their repugnance at the result, stating quite rightly that \"there is no physical basis\" for it. Ti1e human white cells were acting as if the anti-IgE was attacking them from everywhere when in fact it was no­ where. Medicine is reluctant to walk through the quantum door, even though this experiment clearly opens it. * It was widely held that Benveniste was lending credence to the methods of homeopathy, a medical system in­ vented two hundred years ago by a German physician, Samuel Hahne­ mann, and still popular throughout Europe. The term homeopathy comes from two Greek roots that mean \"similar suffering\"; this points to the fundamental homeopathic principIe that \"like treats like.\" Homeopathy approaches all diseases using Benveniste's method: tiny amounts of an­ tagonistic substances are taken by the patient to build up immunity or to drive out a disease if it is already presento When conventional medicine administers a smallpox vaccine, it ap­ pears that homeopathic logic is at work-the dead virus in the vaccine stimulates anti-smallpox antibodies in the body.

Unlike vaccination, however, homeopathy is based on symptoms rarher rhan on the actual organisms that cause a disease.

Ground-up Nux vomica seeds, for example, which conrain strychnine, would be given to counreract chronic fatigue and irritabilíty, because they produce these symptoms themselves. Benveniste's experimenr in fact did not endorse homeopathic iogic as a whole bur only a corner of it, by showing that the body can react ro a microdose of a foreign substance.

This is not a huge mystery--every molecule in your own body is wrapped up, as we saw, with a bit of invisible intelligence. Memory 1S not a term used by physicists, and yet it 1S easy to find it in the quantum world-particles that are separated by immense distances of space-time know what one another are doing. When an electron jumps into a new orbit on the outside of an atom, the anti-electron (or positron) paired with it must react, no matter where it líves in the cosmos. In fact, the entire universe is knitted together by this kind of memory network. To a physicist, the only puzzle in Benveniste's experiment is that no one has ever believed that quantum events take place at the level of molecules. A photon sits on the quantum threshold, where faint, random vibrations are the rule. Sorne of these vibrations die off into nothingness; others wake up and enter material reality as marter or energy. Because tbe pboton is almost nothing to begin with, it can wink in and out of existence. A molecule like IgE, however, is tremendously more substan­ tial than these íluctuating vibrations. If it weren't, molecules might jump in and out of existence without warning-along witb tbings made out of molecules, like blue wbales and skyscrapers. Since tbis does not bappen, it bas not been deemed necessary to invest molecules with mem­ ory. To understand bow sucb memory works, one has to know more about the quantum level of nature. Its peculiarity, setting it aside from all otber states of matter and energy, is its emptiness. We have already seen tbat at its beart, an atom is almost totally empty, being proportionately 119"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"QUANTUM HEALING as void as inter-galactic space. The same must hold true for us, since obviously we are made of atoms. That means we are made out of a void; more than anything else, it is Out raw material. Instead of seeing the space among the stars as bleak, cold, and lifeless, one should look through a physícist's eyes and see it packed with unseen energy waiting to coalesce into atoms. cubic centimeter of space teems with energy, nearly infinite amounts of it, although much of this energy is in \"virtual\" form, meaning that it is locked up and plays no active part in material reality. (A wonderfulline from an ancient Indian Upanishad declares, \"The power penettating the universe is much more than what shines through.\" In terms of quanrum objects, most of which are locked up in virrual form, this is true literally.) Out senses are not prepared to see emptiness as the womb of reality, being tuned in to a grosser leve! of narure populated with Howers, rocks, trees, and Out families. Ir is said thar the human eye can distinguish 2 million shades of color, each of which occupies a narrow band of light energy, but our optical mechanism nevertheless doesn't register these energy vibrations as vibrations. Much less do we register a chunk of solid marble as vibrations, although at botrom that ís what it is, just the same as color. As light shifts from color to color, each small gradation exerts an enormous inHuence. Visible light, for example, gives the world shape and definitíon as perceived by out eyes. If you shift down just slightly to the infrared band, the human eye would feel warm fram the líght but be blind; if you shift up to X rays, the eye would be destroyed. Every quantum gradaríon is slíght, but it implies a completely new reality at the grasser level of molecu1es and living things. The spectrum of 1ight is like a long, continuous string, vibrating slower at one spot and faster at another. We make our home on a tiny part of the spectrum, but it takes the entire length for us to existo Beginning at zero vibration, shakes of the string are responsible for the light, heat, magnetism, and countless other discrete energy forms thar fill rhe universe. It is just a on the ladder of creation from empty space to inter-galactic dust ro a sun 120"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"NOWHERE AND EVERY\\JVHERE and finally the living Earth. What this shows is thar emptiness, the point of zero vibration, is not a void bur the starting point for every­ thing that exists. And this starting point is always in contact with every other point-there are no breaks in continuity. The reason for discussing the subatomic void is that we experience the void every time we think. Just as in the universe at large, something material-the neuropeptide-springs out of nowhere. In this case it is not the atoms of the neuropeptide that are created, because the necessary hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, and so forth are already present in the glucose that the brain uses as fue!. What is created our of nowhere is the config­ uration of the neuropeptide, but that is magical enough. At the very instant that you think, \"1 am happy,\" a chemical messen­ ger translates YOur emotion, which has no soIid existence whatever in the material world, into a bit of matter so perfectly attuned to your desire that literally every cell in your body Iearns of your happiness and joins in. The facr rhar you can insrantly ralk to 50 rrillion cells in rheir own language is jusr as inexplicable as rhe momenr when nature creared rhe first photon our of empty space. These brain chemicals are so small rhar ir has taken scÍence several centuries to identify them. Yet if we look at the messenger molecules as being the finest material expression of intelligence the brain can pro­ duce, we have to admit that rhey are srill not quite fine enough to build a secure bridge between mind and body. In facr, nothing could be fine enough, because one shore we want to bridge, mind, is not small in any physical sense-to think that a thought has a size is absurdo Mind is not \"hanging our\" in space taking up room, even the infinitesimal room needed for an electron. The obvious nonsense of putting mind into a box was one of the chief reasons why science separated mind and matter to begin with, since aH matter can fit into a box. Portunately, quantum physics comes to the bridge builder's rescue. It was born to explore these nonsensical-seeming regions on the fringes of space-time. Quantum physics has taken responsibility for measuring things that are as small as possible. The atom, although very small, was found 121"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"QUANTUM HEALING around 1900 to have a nucleus, and when that was sliced apart, its smallest unit seemed to be the proton, until further atom-smashing revealed, at the edge of material existence, still finer particles called quarks. Beyond the quark, however, the smashing seems to stop. One would think that there has to be something material out there that the quark is built from. Strangely enough, this does not seem to be true. In ancient Greece, the philosopher Democritus first proposed that the material world was composed of minute, invisible particles, which he named atoms, from the Greek word for \"not divisible.\" When Plato heard of this theory (which of course could not be tested experimentally), he offered an objection that uncannily predicts quantum physics. If we think of an atom as a thing, Plato argued, then it must take up sorne space; therefore, ir can be cut in half to occupy a smaller space. Anything that can be cut in half is not the smallest constituent of the material world. By this impeccable reasoning, Plato demolished all solid particles as contenders for nature's basic building block, not just the atom, but the proton, electron, and quark. All of these can be cut in half, even if we can't actually do it, without end. Whatever it is that builds the world, it must be something so tiny that it occupies no space. Plato contended that the world was born out of invisible, perfect forms, similar to geo­ metric shapes. In its turn, modern physics has turned to somewhat more tangible alternatives, such as invisible matter called \"virtual\" particles, as well as to energy fields. Einstein's famous equation E = mc 2 proved that energy could be transformed into matter, and this allowed physics to go beyond the barrier that is \"smaller than small.\" No one can confidently say what builds a quark, but it is certainly not a piece of matter in solid form-the quark is already outside the Emit of anything that one can \"see\" or \"touch,\" even using scientific instru­ ments to extend out senses; its building block may well be merely a vibration that has the potential to turn into matter. Therefore, it is smaller than small. To a physicist, all size stops at a specific number, 10- 33 cubic centimeters, an inconceivable fraction that can be written 122 - - --- -----------------~----"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"NOWHERE AND EVERYWHERE out as 1/10 followed by zeros; this is known as Planck's limit, a kind of absolute zero for space, just as there is an absolute zero for temperatute. Once thís barrier is reached, however, what líes beyond? Here physical science stands mute. But it is fascinating ro discover that all the found­ ers of quantum physics were basically Platonists. That is, they believed that the world of things is a shadowy projection of a vaster, invisible reality that is nonmaterial. Sorne, like Einstein, stood in awe at the orderliness of nature without ascribing intelligence to it. Others, like Eddington, flatly declared that the raw material of the whole universe is \"mind-stuff.\" Eddingron defends his position with a logical argument as elegant as Plato's. Our picture of the world, he points out, is basically a formaríon of brain impulses. This is formed in turn out of impulses traveling up and down the nerves. These in turn come from vibrations of energy at the ends of the nerves. At the basis of the energy is emptiness, the quantum void. Which part is real? The answer is none, because every step along the way, from energy vibrations ro nerve impulses to brain formation, is just acode. No matter where you look, the visible universe is fundamentally a set of signals. Yet these signals aH hold rogether, turning totally meaning­ less vibrations into full-blown experiences that have human meaning. The love between man and wife can be broken down ioto raw physical data, but to do that is to lose its reality. Therefore, Eddington says, all these codes must stand for something more real, something beyond our senses. At the same time, this something is very intimate ro us, for all of us can read the code, turning random quantum vibrations ioto an or­ derly reality. A good image for this would be a pianist playing a Chopin etude. Where is the music? You can find it at many levels-in the vibrating strings, the trip of the hammers, the fingers striking the keys, the black marks on the paper, or the nerve impulses produced in the player's brain. But aH of these are just codes; the reality of music is the shimmering, beauríful, invisible form that haunts our memories without ever being present in the physical world. 123 ---------_. ---------_ ..... __ ._­"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"QUANTUM HEALING * * * To be like the quantum, the body does not have to banish its molecules ro another dimension; it has only to learn to re-form them into new chemical patterns.

Recently 1 saw a patient, an elderly woman, who was suffering from dull chest pains; they had previously been diagnosed as angina pectoris, one of the most common symptoms of advanced heart disease. Between January and May of that year, she had recorded sixty attacks of angina, which were relieved by taking a nitro­ glycerine tablet. 1 instructed her in the \"primordial sound technique\" for heart disease, and she left to practice it on her own. In July, about two months my patient wrote me a letter stating that her attacks had stopped on the day she received the technique and have never recurred. She feels comfortable in activity now-most angina sufferers are extremely anxious about exerting themselves, even slightly. On her own she has discontinued the use of her medicaríon, and she recently enrolled as a full-time college student. She was very proud to write this last piece of news, since she is 88 years old. 124"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"NOWHERE AND EVERYWHERE In my own mind, I explain this result by saying that the mind-body connectíon ís coming under control. I would also say that the Ayurvedic technigue is not magical; it is only imitating nature.

One is spasm of the coronary arteries, the blood vessels that feed oxygen to the heart. If these go into spasm and sgueeze shut, then the oxygen­ deprived heart muscle screams out in pain. My patient must have had this kind of angina, a skeptic would sayo The other kind is caused by fatty blockages in the coronary arreries and couldn't possibly be cured by a mental technique. I would have to answer that both examples involve memory. The fatty blockages are not as substantial as they appear. If you perform a heart-bypass graft and replace the old clogged arteries with open ones, the new replacements will often clog up in a matter of months. This is beca use the vessel has changed bur the ghost of memory has not-it still wants ro load fatty plague into that artery. On the reverse side, many bypass patients don't feel the return of rheir agonizing, frightening chest pain, even with clogged arteries, because they are sure that their surgery cured them. Surgeons have even experi­ mented with placebo operations, doing nothing more than openíng the chest and closing ir again-a good percentage of those patients felt relief from their angina.

A young Israeli named Aaron, 24 years old, called me at my office and said, \"1 feel perfectly healthy, but my doctor has given me ninety days to live. He took some tests which showed that 1 have an incurable blood disorder-that was exactly twenty-three days ago.\" Barely managing to suppress his emotions, he told me a story that had taken several strange turns. His diagnosis had come about entirely by accidento Because of an old soccer injury, he had a deviated septum, which made it difficult for him to breathe. He visited a surgeon in Chicago who could repair his nose-Aaron had moved to the United States several years earlier to attend business school-and the surgeon asked him to have a routine blood test. When the results came back from the lab, the doctor was very dis­ turbed. They showed that Aaron was severely anemic: his hemoglobin count had fallen from a normal of 14 to 6 (a count of 12 would be 127"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"QUANTUM HEALING considered borderline anemic); hemoglobin is the chemical component of the blood that carries oxygen throughout the body. His hematocrit had plummeted to 16; this means that when his blood was spun in a centrifuge to separate the red blood cells from the plasma, the red cells occupied only 16 percent of the total volume. In normal blood, this should be doser ro 40 percent. Aaton was immediately referred to a blood specialist, a hematologist, who asked him a standard series of questions. \"Have you been feeling short of breath lately?\" \"No,\" Aaron answered. \"Do you wake up in the middle of the night feeling suffocated?\" \"No.\" \"Have your ankles been swelling up?\" \"No.\" The hematologist looked at him very hard. \"look,\" he said, \"you're pretty tired all the time, aren't you?\" Aaton shook his head. \"That's amazing!\" the doctor exelaimed. \"With your hemoglobin counts, you should be in congestive heart failure by now.\" Aaron was shocked. looking at the blood tests, however, his doctor had a right to be amazed. In severe anemia, the heart has to work much harder than normal to supply enough oxygen ro the rest of the body. This, combined with its own oxygen deprivation, causes the heart mus­ ele to swell, leading to congestive heart failure. The patient begins ro wake up at night feeling that he is suffocating to death, and eventually that is what happens. Mystified, the hematologist too k a sample of Aaron's bone martow. The body typically contains only 9 ounces of bone marrow, but that is enough to manufacture our total supply of red blood corpuscles, at arate of 200 billlon new cells per day. Under examination, Aaron's marrow showed no signs of the red-cell precursors that should have been The hematologist now knew that at the root of Aaron' s condition was a shutdown of the bone marrow (called aplastlc anemia), but he could not 128"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"SILENT WITNESS determine any cause for it. Even without symptoms, Aaron was very sick. \"No one knows for sure how long a red blood cell lives,\" the doctor said. \"The accepted figure is one hundred rwenty days, but it couid be as short as a month.

He could be given a blood transfusion to raise his red-cell count, but rhe sudden incursion of anorher person's blood would further dampen his bone marrow functlon; moreover, when the marrow detected that rhe blood count was up again, ir might interpret that as a sign to roH back even further. Because he felt no symptoms, Aaron hesitated to undergo the trans­ planto The hematologist gave him two weeks ro decide. He also said that it was his legal duty ro advise the young man to settle his affairs as quickly as possible. (Aaron was not exactly treated with compassion at any step of the way. At one point, he divulged ro his doctor that his older sister had died suddenly and tragically in law school. The cause of death, though vague, was thought to be arare blood disorder, perhaps inherited. On hearing this, the hematologist enthusiastically asked Aaron to try to find out precisely what his sister had died of, since together he and she would make an excellent artide for the journals. When Aaron later recounted this incident, 1 found myself growing ex­ tremely angry.) \\Vithin a day of his diagnosis, Aaron began to feel short of breath and found himself unable ro sleep. sought in desperation for a way to cure himself. Almost by chance he rook up meditation and heard about our Ayurvedic dinic.

The first was the frightening diagnosis itself, which had thrown him into a panic. In such a condition, it is difficult to see how the bodymind could begin to find a route toward healing. In addition, Aaron seemed a tense and driven persono He had worked four jobs at a time while he was in school, pushing himself to the limit in order to buy a car and keep ahead of school debts. The pressure of school itself was enormous. He routinely took huge doses of vitamins, plus an anti-ulcer medication to soothe his chronic stomach pain. A few months earlier he'd had tendonitis from playing tennis too hard and had taken an anti-inflammatory agem to bring down the swelling-such drugs are known to suppress bone mar­ row function. 1 asked hím to díscontinue all medication. He stayed two weeks at the elinic and for the first time lived in an environment free of \"normal\" stress. He continued to meditate, ate a simple vegetarian diet suited to his particular body and received a course of massage treatments that Ayurveda prescribes to purify the physiology. 1 also instructed him in the primordial sound technique suitable for his condition. One night a nurse caught him walking down the hall with wet hair, and he sheepishly confessed that he had sneaked off the property to go swimming. When 1 heard this, 1 was very happy -another patient with Aaron's blood count could easily have been on oxygen and blood transfusions. The signs were more than encouraging. On the day he left, 1 asked Aaron not to have any more bIood tests for at least two weeks. A blood sample drawn at Lancaster had disclosed that his supply of immarure red blood cells, called reticulocytes, was four times higher than when he entered. Since these are the cells that later mature imo red corpuseles, 1 felt that his condition had turned around. As 1 write, Aaron has just outlived his original prognosis. He is still severely anemic, but on the other hand he has not gone into the serious 130"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"SILENT WITNESS decline expected of someone whose blood count is heading toward zero. In fact, his anemia has slightly improved. In my mind, Aaron stands on the dividing Ene between two kinds of medicine. The first is standard scientific medicine, whose methods are deeply ingraíned in me, but which 1 can no longer trust absolutely. It is not that standard medicine has failed. Aaron's docrors expertly tracked down his disease at every level of the body, from tissues ro cells to molecules-in Aaron' s case, the tissue was bone marrow, the cells were red bIood corpuscles, and the molecule was hemoglobin. To a doctor trained in conventional medicine, this is the end of the route, a route that has taken two centuries of painstakingly rational investigation to find. Once you know what is wrong with a person's very molecules, what else can be known? This Iogic is impeccable science, but it is dangerously divorced from the ordinary input of life. By \"ordinary input\" 1 mean what a person eats and how he sleeps, the thoughts that go through his head, and all the sights, smells, sounds, and textures that enter through his senses. You can say that the body is made out of molecules, but with egual justice you could say that it is made out of experiences. That definition matches our own self-image, which is not scientific but fluid, changeable, and alive. Out of ordinary experiences, the second medicine, which is guan­ tum, takes its origino We might casually think that everyday life is roo commonplace and simple for science to bother with. In truth, it is far too complexo Al­ though a molecule of hemoglobin ís structured out of 10,000 separate atoms, it can be isolated and mapped-a feat that has led ro several Nobel prizes. However, ro trace what hemoglobin ís doing when you take in a single breath would be impossible, because each red blood ceH contains 280 million molecules of hemoglobin, each of which picks up 8 atoms of oxygen. Considering that the lungs expose about one guart of blood ro the air per breath, containing 5 trillion red cells, the total 131"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"--- --------------------- -------- QUANTUM HEALING number of chemical exchanges is astronomical. The whole process quickly disintegrates into a swirling chaos of activity. When you open the human body during surgery, what confronts you is not the well-defined map of textbook anatomy, with the nerves in blue, blood vessels in red, and a green liver neatly set apart from a yellow gallbladder. Instead, an uneducated eye sees a jumble of tissue that is mostly undifferentiated-almost all of it is pink and moist; one organ slides imperceptibly into another. The great wonder is that scientific medicine has learned as much as it has about this pulsating chaos. But in return for its knowledge, science has paid a high price by having to abando n ordinary experience. A breath of air, after all, is not chaos, except to a molecular biologist. Breathing is the basic rhythm of life, upon which all other rhythms are based. Eric Cassell, a professor of physiology at Cornell, astutely points out that when a doctor asks his patient questions, he is not trying to find out what is wrong with him; he is trying to find out what symptoms he might have that match a known, classified disease. This is a subtle but very important distinction. Ir reminds us that the whole system of or­ gans, tissues, and so on was set up intellectually to make the body easier to classify. There must be other views that are truer to nature, in that they rely on ordinary experience, defying nature's disorderly exterior in order to understand its real meaning. Chaos is just an appearance, a mask, and with a different eye it meta­ morphoses into pure order. Until its code was cracked, a honeybee's dance looked like chaos, a random display of twitches and turns. Now we see it as a precise set of directions leading the other bees in the hive to a source of nectar. This does not mean that the dance changed from chaos to order, only that its appearance changed in our eyes. Similarly, if you take a few blood pressure readings from a heart patient, it is unlikely that they will form any pattern, but if you monitor him constantly, a definite wave pattern emerges, with peaks and valleys that occur over the space of one or two days. This fact, which was only recently uncovered, has allowed cardiologists to detect hypertension in patients who have 132"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"SILENT WITNESS deceptively normal pressure in a doctor' s office because their peaks occur only at night. Clearly some kind of tidal swing is at work, but no one yet knows its significance. The mask of chaos is too freshly broken. The two medicines do not have to be antagonists, but for the moment they clearly face in opposite directions. To a hematologist, it is largely irrelevant if Aaron is tense, driven, full of dubious substances, and pan­ icked at the thought of dying. To an Ayurvedic doctor, these are primary inputs to his sickness-they have entered on the quantum level, where he turns into the person he 1s. The hematologist is not being heartless; he may care very deeply about Aaron, but he cannot prove a connection between bone marrow dysfunction and working four jobs at a time. That is the limit where the Newtonian notion of cause and effect, the basis of standard scÍent1fic medicine, breaks down. You cannot possibly ask enough questions to find out what really makes a patient sick. In Aaron's case, 1 would want ro know how he felt about his sister's death, what he eats for breakfast, who his friends are, how he feels when he loses at tennis-in 1 want to know every relevant experience. This is virrually impossible. So many influences press in on us every day that the idea of causation disappears. 1 would think it absurd to dissecr a poet's brain to find the cause of his sonnets; his correx undeniably had to exhibit specific brain-wave parteros ro pro­ duce a sonnet, but they have evaporated and been carried to a realm hidden by rime. Ir begins to seem just as absutd to claim that an isolated physical cause líes behind Aaron's bone marrow dysfunction. His life is swept along by time, too, and what I want to find has evaporated. I know this sounds shocking, because without a cause, how can we find a cure? But all physical causes are pardal at best. lf you try to give someone a cold, for example, it takes more rhan a virus. Experimenters have incubated cold viruses, placed them directly on the mucous lining of the nose, and found that their subjecrs came down with colds only 12 percent of the time. These odds could not be increased by exposing the subjects ro cold drafts, putring their feet in ice water to give them chills, or anything else rhar was purely physicaL Ordinary experience, a com­ 133"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"QUANTUM HEALING plex play of inner and outer forces, defies the rules of causation that work for billiard balls. Conventional medicine airead y recognizes that ordinary experience can playa complex role in disease. For example, statistics show that single people and widows living alone are more likely to get cancer than people who are married. Their loneliness is called a risk factor-one could just as truly call it a carcinogen. Then why isn't curing loneliness a cure for cancer? It may well be, but in a different kind of medicine than we now practice. An Ayurvedic physician is more interested in the patient he sees befo re him than in his disease. He recognizes that what makes up the person is experience-sorrows, joys, fleeting seconds of trauma, long hours of nothing special at all. The minutes of life silently accumulate, and like grains of sand deposited by a river, the minutes can eventually pile up into a hidden formation that crops aboye the surface as a disease. The process of accumulation is impossible to see or to stop. 1 may sit in a traffic jam and think, \"Well, nothing is happening to me now,\" but in fact 1 am taking in, or ingesting, the world around me. My body is metabolizing everything 1 see, hear, smell, and touch and turning it into me, just as surely as it ingests my orange juice. The input that is turning into me is constant, and by my participa­ tion 1 shape it into final formo Science will not be able to measure this process, because it cannot put my senses or my emotions on a scale. How much loneliness does it take to turn into cancer? This is a meaningless question. The carcinogen is invisible. 1 remember one night when 1 stood in the emergency room of a suburban hospital after attending to an overflow of patients. A late commuter train had crashed, and with one other doctor 1 had to work in a near frenzy seeing dozens of passengers who might be in shock, bandaging their wounds, calming their nerves, setting bones, and performing minor surgeries. Our job seemed endless, but after five hours it was done, and we felt like heroes. Then the ambulance radio carne on again, and the driver said, \"We're coming in with a two-month-old infant, female, who is unconscious.

Ir affects seemingly normal bables, there is no known cause, and even the fastest emergency treatment is usual1y of no avail.

The body's know-how seems to be the result of a complexity of parts, broken down according ro functions-digestion, respirarion, merabolism, and so on. Although this division of labor is real enough, intelligence remains ev­ erywhere the same despite ir, just as a drop of sea water shares the saltiness of the whole ocean. Sea water gives us a perfect example, in fact. The fluid in rhe body tastes as salty as the ocean and is equally rich in magnesium, gold, and other trace elements. Life began in the sea, and we are alive outside it only because we carry an internal ocean around wirh uso When you are thirsty and take a drink of water, you are actually rebalancing the fluid chemistry everywhere in your inner ocean. The fee1ing of being thirsty 1S stimulated by rhe hyporhalamus, a of the brain about the size of a finger joint, which in tum is connected by both nerves and chemical messengers to the kidneys. The kidneys constantly monitor rhe body's need for water by \"listening in\" ro signals from the blood. The signals are chemical, as wirh the neuro­ peptides, bur in this case the molecules involved are salrs, proteins, and blood sugar, as well as specific messengers. blood in turn is picking up these signals from every cell in the body, each of which is constantly monitoring its own need for water. In other words, when you want a drink of water, you are nor just obeying an impulse from your brain­ you are listening to a request from every cell in your body. If you drink one small glass of water, you will replace only 1/400 of your total bodily fluid, yet that will satisfy rhe precise needs of 50 trillion different cells. Such exact monitoring is ofren artributed ro the kidneys alone, but as we have just seen, kidneys never make decisions alone; they work in constant consultaríon with the quantum mechanical body -rhe whole field of intelligence. The evenness of intelligence is nor apparent from the physical of the cells; it coexists with the body's extreme specialization. The neuron, which is outfitted on its ceH wall with a million sodium-potassium pumps, is not at aH like a hearr ceH or sromach ce1l. Yet, the integrity of the message \"time for sorne water\" is constant everywhere. 136"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"SILENT WITNESS In physics, a field 1S what propagates an inftuence over a large, or even infinite, expanse of space. A magnet creates a magnetic field around itself; small magnets have a weak field that extends a few inches, while the Earth's magnetic poles are powerful enough to cover the entire globe. Anything that falls within a field feels its effect; that is why the magnetic needle of a compass automatically aligns itself with the Earth's magnetic polarity. Sitting in the body's field of intelligence, each ceH is aligned with the brain, which stands as the north magnetic pole. A is a small outcropping in the field, while the brain is a huge one. But the ceH, when ir \"talks\" to the rest of the body, is not inferior to brain in the guality of what it says. Like the brain, ir must correlate its message with trillions of others; it must participate in thou­ sands of chemical exchanges every second; and most important of aH, its DNA is the egual of any neuron's. Therefore, the smallest impulse of intelligence is as intelligent as the largest. In fact, it is meaningless tú speak of important pieces of intelligence or insignificant ones. We need only to remember chain that builds dopamine; the inability to rum the humble protein into the egually humble metabolite called glycine leads to a minutely higher level of dopamine, with the cata­ strophic ourcome of schizophrenia, overwhelming the entire mind. Every ceH 1S a little sentient being. Sitting in the liver or heart or kidney, it \"knows\" everything you know, but in its own fashion. We are of course used to the idea that we are smarter than our kidneys. The very concept of a \"building block\" implies that the brick is simpler than the building.

It is like a house whose bricks are constantly being replaced, or a sculpture that at the same time is a river. The obstacle confroming medicine so far is that one side of our flowing and changing-has been sacrificed for the sake of the other-the stable and fixed. Now, havíng looked at the quamum level, perhaps we can package both into one unit that captures our real double impulse of intelligence. An impulse of imelligence is the smallest unit that preserves itself ímact (non-change) while undergoing transformatíon (change). If impulses of intelligence did not have this one general property, then they could not be the basic building block of the body; either sorne purely mental impulse or sorne purely physical particle would have that distinction. But neither of these can survive change. The molecules forming your brain on the day that you firsr thought rhe word rose are not there anymore, and yet the concept is. At the same time, you do nor have ro think the word rose all the time to retain it; you can think literally millions of other thoughts without ever referring ro this word. The next time you want it back, there it is, without confusion. It has retained its integrity through thick and thin because the impulse of imelligence contains mínd, marter, and the silence that glues them rogether. The physical structure of the body mirrors intelligence and gives it a projected form, but intelligence is not trapped inside this framework of flesh and bones. A startling confirmaríon of rhis facr appears in the brain. Karl Lashley, a pioneer in neurophysiology, tried to discover where memory was located in the brain by performing a simple experíment with lab rars. He raught them to run a maze, a skill that is remembered and stored in their brains, just as we acquire skills. Then he systemati­ cally removed a small amount of cerebral tissue. Lashley supposed that if the rats still remembered how ro run the maze (as measured by theír speed and accuracy), then rhe brain's memory cemer must still be imact. Líttle by little, he took out more braín marter, but the rats, curíously enough, srill remembered how to run the maze. Finally, more than 90 percent of the entire cortex was gone, leaving only a speck of brain 138"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"SILENT WITNESS tissue, and still the rats remembered the maze, with a slight faH-off in accuracy and speed. This experiment, among others, suggested a revolu­ tionary idea, that every ceH of the braín must srore the whole braín whíle at the same time storing íts own specífic task. Thís is exactly what we have found: every impulse of intelligence is equally intelligent, opening up endless possible projections of mind into body. John Lorber, a British neurologist, specialized in examining patients who were hydrocephalic-in place of cerebral tissue, their brain cavities were filled with fluid. Generally, this condition, popularly called \"water on the brain,\" can be quite dangerous and lead ro serious mental impair­ mento However, one of Lorber's patients was a gifted college student, major­ ing in mathematics, whose IQ was measured near 130. Referred to Lor­ ber by his family doctor, who thought his patient had an enlarged head, the student was given a brain scan, which revealed that his cortex was only 1 millimeter thick, compared ro the usual 4.5 centimeters. In other words, fluid had replaced about 98 percent of the neurons needed for thinking, remembering, and aH the other higher functions centered in the cerebral cortex. With 2 percent of a normal cortex, this man was in the same position as Lashley's rats, physiologically, and yet infinitely more capable-he was in fact normal or aboye average in al! respects. We are being driven closer and closer to the silent field of intelligence as out fundamental reality. But once again, there is the problem that a silent mind seems ro contain nothing at aH. If we go back nearly a hundred years, a similar dilemma was very much in the airo A new scíence called psychology was trying to be born, but it was having a hard time because to qualify as a scíence, psychology needed an object ro study. Ir was obvious that every person had a psyche, but no one had ever seen ot touched one. The most basic questions about the psyche had remained unsettled for centuries. Was it the soul, the mind, the person­ ality, or aH three? No one was going ro be able to set up the first experiment in psychology until these matters were settled. 139"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"QUANTUM HEALING The turning point ca me when William James, a brilliant philosopher at Harvard who also held a medical degree, asserted that psychology did indeed have a proper object to study. Or rather, thousands of objects­ all the thoughts, emotions, desires, and impressions that swirled through the mind. James called these the \"stream of consciousness.\" lf there was a mental essence or soul, as pre-psychologists back to Plato had affirmed, then science could not find it. James did not say that such an invisible essence did nor exist, but he saw no way ro experiment upon it scientifi­ cally. James defended rhe stream of consciousness on purely pragmatic grounds, reasoning that nothing in the mind could be considered tangi­ ble except the objects (rhoughts) that passed through it. lf one is always thinking or dreaming-no one knows what he does menta11y in deep, nondream sleep-then the reality of the mind must be simply a continu­ ous flow of thoughts and dreams. James was a very astute observer; he had to be when you consider that he basically founded the field of psychology on the data he saw in his own head (as Freud did, extending the data into the field of dreams and unconscious motives). But James missed a tiny aspect of the mind that might have seemed completely trivial. The stream of consciousness is not made up solely of objects floating downriver; in between every thought there is a fleeting of silence. Ir may be very tíny and all but unnoticeable, but the gap is always there and absolutely necessary. Without it, we would be thinking líke this: \"IlikethislunchanddessertbutifIeattoomuchohthereisSidlneed­ towhereismywallet ... \" and so on. The sílent gap between thoughts, being intangible, sti11 plays no part ín modern psychology, whích is oriented completely ro the mind's contents or the brain's mechanícs. The gap turns out to be the central player, however, if you are interested in what lies beyond thought. Every fractíon of a second we are permitted a glímpse into another world, one that is inside us and yet obscurely out of A verse from an ancient Indian Upanishad describes this beauti­ ful1y: \"A man is like two doves sitting in a cherry tree.

The fascinating thing about intelligence 1S that it is like a one-way arrow: you can use intelligence ro shape a molecule, but if you look at the molecule, you cannot rake rhe intelligence back out of it. When the poet Keats wrote his beautiful sonnet \"To Sleep,\" he began with the haunting line, \"O soft embalmer of the still mídnight.\" If he had been hooked up ro an EEG while he was writíng, the readout of brain waves would have formed a unique pattern, yer no amount of examinaríon of those brain waves could ever yield a line of poetry. In the same way, aH of Out molecules are hirched up with a bit of intelligence, which influences everything they do, but you cannot see it by Jooking ar them. DNA provides a good example. Sitting in the nucleus of each ceH, DNA is constantly bathed in a swirl of free-floating organic molecules, the basic building blocks of the material body. Whenever ir wants to be active, DNA atrracts these chemicals and uses them to form new DNA. This is an essential part of cell division-one double strand of DNA must divide in half, splirring right down the middle like a zipper, and rhen each half turns into new, complete DNA by attracting the appropriate molecules to itself. The bath of swirling, aimless source molecules surrounding DNA provides it with \"letters\" to combine-there are juSt four of them, labeled A, e, and G, for adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine. DNA spins these four letters out into an infinite variety of combinations, sorne of which are short (it takes three letters to code a basic amino acid), others of which are very long, like the poly-peptide chains that can be seen streaming away ftom DNA like tendrils. The DNA knows exactly what information to pick out and how it all goes together for each thing it wants to \"say\" chemically. Besides build­ ing itself, DNA knows how to build RNA, or ribonucleic acid, which is its nearly identical twin and active counterpart. RNA's míssion is to travel away from the DNA in order to produce the proteins, more than 2 1"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"QUANTUM HEALING million in number, that acrua11y build and repair the body. RNA is like active knowledge, in comparison to DNA's silent inte11igence. DNA does not work just from rote memory. It can invent new chemi­ cals at will (such as a new antibody after you catch a strain of Bu you have never been exposed to before). Exactly how this is accomplished is not known, although molecular biologists have found the spacers that separate different genetic words, or genomes. It is also we11 established that only 1 percent of the genetic material in DNA is used for its complicated coding, self-repair, and manufacture of RNA, leaving 99 percent doing nothing that science can account foro This puzzling silence has stimulated a great deal of curiosity, espe­ cia11y among people who believe that humans do not use their fu11 inte11igence. William James ventured to guess that we use only 5 per­ cent of our intelligence-he meant mental capacity-with an Einstein utilizing up to 15 percent or 20 percent. How this percentage translates into usable DNA is unknown, but we can venture to say that DNA is keeping a large vocabulary in silent storage-one geneticist has calcu­ lated that the number of molecular \"words\" produced in a single cell, if translated into English, would fi11 a thousand-volume library. And that is the product of just the active 1 percent we have managed to under­ stand. Thanks tO the discovery of recombinant DNA (pieces of gene tic material that can be shuffled in and out of sequence on the DNA strands), the potential vocabulary may be infinitely larger than we sus­ pect; already the combinations of \"letters\" encoded on DNA are suffi­ cient tO create every life form on Earth, from bacteria and molds tO all plants, insects, mammals, and people. One might suppose that the more complex the organism, the greater its share of DNA, but in fact a lily contains about a hundred times more DNA than a human being. Counting genes does not give very much of a meaningful picrure: the difference between man's DNA and that of chimpanzees or gorillas is about 1.1 percent. This seems like a surpris­ ingly small divergence, and a highly suspicious one. Can aH the sttuc­ tural differences between a jungle primate and Horno sapiens, as well as 142"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"SILENT WITNESS our vastly superior brains, be packed into such a dny fractional differ­ ence?

The issue is somewhat blunted when you realize, once again, that a gene count is not very significant-two different kinds of fmit fIies (DrosophilaJ are much more closely related than man and chim­ panzees, yet their DNA differs by considerably more. Another way ro show that our inner silence is alive and intelligent is to compare it to a machine's. When a computer approaches a problem, ir uses electrical impulses that must be separated from one another by gaps, forming a complex series of coded data out of 1 and O. This enables the computer ro handle any problem that can be broken down into informatíon, since all information can be coded into 1 and O, just as any message in English can be broken down into the dots and dashes of Morse codeo The human brain also takes advantage of mechanically coded infotmation, but the gaps in between are not just empty; they are the pivots that allow the mind ro swing any way ir wants. In other words, a computer has finite gaps made of emptiness; we have infinite gaps full of intelligence. We can pull anyrhing out of the gap. Mozart pulled whole sympho­ nles at a time, not just note by note, but-as he recounted the experi­ ence-wíth every orchestral Une already composed and orchestrated. Mathematics, like music, has many such mysteries. A woman in India named Shakuntala Devi multiplied two 13-digit numbers together in her head, arriving at the 23-digit answer in 26 seconds.

If you teH a computer ro add 2 plus 2, it comes up with eíther a right or a wrong answer. If you ask a 5-year-old boy to do the same, he may come up with an arithmetical answer, but he just as well might say, \"I wan t sorne vanilla cream.\" We can assume that he 1S bored; perhaps he is too tlred for an arithmetic lesson.

What this all amounts to, in my mind, is a vindication of how com­ plex ordinary experience really is, and how far away from life a scientific model is when it tries to describe it. The old view that the brain is a computer, stable in time and space, localized into various functions, and restricted in its flexibility, is unjustified. A Nobel Prize-winning neuro­ scientist, Dr. Gerald Edelman, has pointed out that the brain is much more like a process than a thing, and this process is continually evolving. It is true, for example, that memory depends on two small pie ces of \"hardware\" on either si de of the brain called the hippocampus; if both sites become damaged (through loss of blood flow or disease), the ability to recollect is destroyed. Yet, within this physical limitation, each person's brain is unique, both in structure and contento No two people have the same neuronal connections, and each person is constantly growing new ones from the moment of birth onward, giving rise to all the memories that make you and me totally different. (A connection does not have to be physical; the flashing signals in the brain are constantly making patterns and re­ forming them into new patterns.) Edelman holds that no one literally repeats a memory. When you recollect a familiar face, something will be different about it, if not the face itself, then the context that caused you to remember, which may be sad now instead of happy. Memory is a creative act, then. It creates new images and new brain at the same time. Edelman theorizes that every experience one has in life changes the brain's anatomy. Therefore, it is not wholly true to say that the hippocampus is the seat of memory, for any one memory-the first day you saw a field of daffodils-shifts and shimmers across your entire cortex, touching other memories here and there, passing into new interpretations, and having to be re-created every time you need to recollect it. Unlike any computer, we remember, re­ consider, and change our minds. The universe was created once, but we re-create ourselves with every thought. 144"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"SILENT WITNESS * * * Everyrhing, in shorr, depends upon how well you can build in silence.

About half of the women diagnosed with breast cancer have localized tumors confined to the breast. The standard treatment has been either to remove the breast or to remove the lump and radiate the sÍte to kill any remaining cancer cells. In both cases, when there is no further follow-up treatment, 70 percent of patients do not have a recurrence in the next With sorne sort of chemotherapy, ranging from mild to quite heavy, proportion of long-term survivors can be raised tú 90 percent. This woman had decided to defy odds that were very much in the patient's favor-and yet she would not be the first to ignore doctors and survive. When she lay on the examining table and I saw the tumor, I under­ stood why her previous doctors had been shocked-it distended a large portion of her breast. 1 controlled my auromatic reaction, and I hope no showed in my eyes. 1 sat down and held her hand, thinking. \"Look,\" I said softly, \"1 don't believe you are in danger here. You have said that you don'r feel any danger, and that is good enough for me. But this tumor is a nuisance. You are denying yourself a more beautiful life by having to look after this. Why not go to a surgeon and have the nuisance removed?\" Apparently this struck her as an entirely new angle. She readily that there was no advantage to keeping the tumor, and I referred her to a sympathetic surgeon. One of her parting comments stays with me. \"1 don't identify myself with this tumor,\" she said serenely, \"1 know I am much more than it. Ir will come and go like the rest of me, but inside, 1 am not real1y touched by it.\" When she left the office, she looked extremely happy. I felt that this woman had reason on her side.

When a doctor looks at a patient and says, \"You have breast cancer, but you're going to well,\" what is he really saying? The answer is by no means certain. At one extreme, his reassuring words, if they are believable, may be enough to make the difference in the patient's case. At the other extreme, if he actually thinks the patient is doomed, some­ thing in his voice will give that message, and from it a destructive confusion may set in.

With placebo, you give a dummy drug and the patient responds because the doctor has toId him that the drug will work. With nocebo, you a viable drug, but the patient doesn't respond, because the doctor has signaled that the drug Isn't going to work. If you take a completely materialistic view, there seems no difference between the surgery this woman refused before and the one she agreed to now. Yet, now she identifies surgery with healing, whereas before it was violence. If a patient regards any treatment as violence, then his body will be flooded with negative emotions and the chemicals associated with them. It is well documented thar in aclimate of negativity, the ability to heal is greatly reduced--depressed people not only lower their immune response, for example, but even weaken their DNA's ability to repair itself. So my patient had reasonable cause, I think, to wait until her emotions told her to go ahead. This case reminds me (hat there are always two centers of action within people, the head and the heart. Medical statistics appeal to the head, but the heart keeps its own counsel. In recent years, alternative medicine has won much of its appeal on the basis of bringing back the heart, using love and caring to heal.

The heart can be very fraíl; it can be hardened by suffering, or just by life. Books on holistíc healing like to say that peopIe \"need\" their sickness. Mainstream psychiatry points its own when it says that chronic diseases can stand symbolically for self-punishment, re­ venge, or a deep feeling of worthlessness. I wiU not argue these insights, except to suggest that they may be harmful ro the healing process rather than helpful. It is hard enough for any of us to face up ro our emotional fallibility even at the best of times. Can we really expected to reform when we are ill? The deeper íssue is that anything can function as a nocebo, just as anythíng can function as a placebo. Ir is not the dummy drug, the docror's bedside manner, or the antiseptíc smell of a hospital that does harm or good; it is the patíent's interpretatíon of it. Therefore, the real war is not between the head and the heart. Something deeper, in the reaIm of silence, creates our view of reality.

Within a day her bone pain returned. She called me, feeling panicky, and 1 asked if she could return to Boston immediately. She did, and fortunately after another week her bone pain again receded. Without intending to harm his patient-I am sure he wanted to be realistic in his appraisal-this woman's doctor made a cruel mistake. He assumed that what is \"in your head\" is not real, or at least very inferior to the reality of cancer. Being trained in scientific methods, he knew the predictable outcomes of various kinds of malignancy, and when he saw an unexpected result, he tried to push it back into the range of the predictable. Doctors push patients into predictable results all the time, because medical-school training is focused entirely on the horizontal aX1s. Making the links of cause and effect tighter and tighter is the whole motivation behind medical research. Our great-grandfathers vaguely knew that germs existed; we can anatomize thousands of specific viruses and bacteria, down to the tiniest amino-acid groups and beyond.

Certain of these, such as nausea, headaches, and skin irrita­ tion, would be uncomfottable; others, such as the weakening of his immune system, could be deadly, since he would become prone to con­ tracting other types of cancer in the future. There was also the definite possibility that he would be prey ro anxiety and depression, which could be lasting. Even with maximum treatment ro shrink the tumor, the prognosis for full recovery was not good, but it was better than nothing. The patient could not accept this reasoning (although it is statistically quite sound). He moved to California and joined a meditation group; he practiced a whole series of diets, mental techniques, exercises, and visu­ alizations. He encouraged in himself a totally positive attitude toward his condition. Thousands of cancer patients, as a tule from the educated groups, turn to such measures, which conventional medicine looks on as trying to buy false hopeo In this case, however, the man began to feel better, and within six months his symptoms were almost eompletely gone.

Then it was discovered (by hypnotizing postoper­ ative patients) that in fact the \"unconscious\" mind heard every word that was uttered during the procedure. When the surgeons said aloud that a condition was more serious than they had thought or had little chance of cure, the patients tended ro play out those gloomy predictions by not recovering. As a result of these findings, which validate the idea of nocebo, it is now standard practice not to make negative remarks during surgery. The more positive the surgeon's expressed opinions, in fact, the more positive the outcome for the patient.

The psychologist Abraham Mas­ low, who was a pioneer in studying the posítive aspects of the human personality, gave a classic description of the experíence of the self: \"These moments were of pure, positive happiness, when all doubts, al1 fears, aH inhibiríons, aH tensions, aH weaknesses, were left behind. Now self-consciousness was lost. AH separateness and distance from the world dísappeared. . . .\" Although such experiences are rare~Maslow termed them \"peak ex­ periences\" for that reason~they have a curative power that goes far beyond their brief duration, which may be a few days or just a few hours. Maslow records that two of his patients, one a long-term depressive who had often considered suicide, the other a person who suffered from severe anxíety attacks, were both immediately and permanently cured spontaneously fallíng into such experiences (for each it happened only once). Maslow also talks about the reconciliaríon with life that people have realized through these moments: \"They felt one with the world, fused with it, really belonging to it instead of being outside looking in. (Qne subject said, for ínstance, '1 felt like a member of a family, not like an orphan.')\" Any sudden revelatíon of a reality carríes enormous power with it~one taste alone can make life undeniably worthwhile.

It is life power in Íts purest formo Maslow's understanding stopped short at the critical moment-he was never able actually to give anyone a peak experience-yet he was fascinated by these events that transcend normal life.

Finding the silent gap that flashes in between out thoughts seems rela­ tively easy, but because it flashes by, a tiny gap is not a doorway. The quantum body is not separate from us-ir ís us-yet we are not experi­ encing it right now. Sitting here, we are thinking, reading, talking, breathing, digesting, and so on, all of which happens aboye the lineo Here is an analogy that brings the quantum mechanical body into focus: Take a bar magnet and place a piece of paper over it. Next, sprinkle iron filings on the paper and jostle it slightly. What will emerge is a pattern of curving lines, one inside the other, that arch from the magnet's nortb ro south pole and back again.

If you didn't know that there was a magnet, you would swear that the iron was alive, because it seems ro move by itself. But it is really the hidden field that is generating these lifelike appearances. There you have a true picture of how the bodymind acrually relates ro the field of intelligence. The two remain separated, but the division is invisible and has no thickness whatever. It is just a gap. The only way one knows that the quantum level even exists is that images and patterns keep cropping up everywhere in the body. Mysterious furrows mn across the surface of the brain; beautiful swirls, exactly like the center of a sunflower, show up in molecules of DNA; the inside of the femur con­ tains marvelous webs of bone tissue, like the intricate supports of a cantilever bridge. Wherever you look, there is no chaos, and that is the strongest proof of all that there really is a hidden physiology. Intelligence turns chaos into patterns. There is incredible chaos implied in the idea of having ro process billions of chemical messages every minute, yet in reality, the complexity of the mind-body system is misleading: what emerges from our brains are coherent images, just as a coherent newspaper phorograph emerges from thousands of scattered dots. The matter in our bodies never disintegrates into a shapeless, mindless pile-until the moment of death. In answer ro the obvious question, \"Where is this quantum me­ chanical body, anyway?\" one can now confidently answer that it lies in a gap that unfortunately is rather difficult to picture, since it is silent, has no thickness, and exists everywhere.

From a certain perspective, the whole idea that we are outcroppings from an invisible, infinite field seems ridiculous.

We trust our finite everyday experiences, which are good enough for driving a car, earning a living, and going to the beach, but they are not quite convincing enough compared to the overwhelming experience of the infinite. That experience, repeated throughout the centuries, causes sorne people to suspect that reality is very different, and far vaster, than what the mind, the body, and society generally accept. Einstein himself experienced this reality. He has testified to moments when \"one feels free from one's own identification with human limita­ tion\": \"At such moments one imagines that one stands on sorne spot of a small planet gazing in amazement at the cold and yet profoundly mov­ ing beauty of the eternal, the unfathomable.

The daily scene is like an archaeological dig whose layers are hopelessly mixed up, or better yet, where the layers have jumped out of the ground and come to life. Every dig has to have a bottom layer, though. In this case, it is the sadhus. India's holy men date from at least three thousand years before the birth of Christ. Their words have been recorded and passed on in the original Sanskrit, which lays good daim to being man's first language. Their tradirional home is still the Himalayas, where they go to sir in samadhi, or deep meditation, for days or weeks at a time. Por them, life is totally dedicated to inner silence. Very occasionally, the thought might enter their heads that they should go on a pilgrimage. Picking up their begging bowls, they then set off to the south, trusting to nature to provide them with the necessary food and shelter. In modern times, they can usually board any train or bus without a ticket. As a child what I knew of sadhus carne from one of my undes, my father's older brother, who traveled all over the country selling sports equipment. We called him Bara Unde, or \"big unde,\" a name that set him apart from our lesser relations. He inevitably arrived at our door with field hockey sticks (India traditionally used to beat the rest of the world in this minor sport), soccer balls, or badminton shuttles as presents. Naturally, we couldn't wait to see him. Bara Unde was hugely affable and gregarious. He spun fabulous tales about the wonders he met on his way. The most vivid happened in Calcutta. Bara Unde was pushing his way through the crowds when he almost stumbled over an old sadhu sitting near the curb. Absentmind­ edly, my unde reached into his pocket, found two annas (about two cents), and put them in the sadhu's bowl. The sadhu shot him a glance and said, \"Make a wish for anything you want.\" Taken aback, my unde blurted, \"1 want sorne burfi.\" Burfi is an Indian candy, like fudge, that is usually made from almonds or coconut. Very calmly the sadhu reached his right hand into the air, materialized two pieces of fresh burfi, and gave them to Bara Unde. Astounded, he stood transfixed for a few seconds, just enough time for the sadhu to rise and 164"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"IN THE RISHI'S WORLD melt like a shadow into the crowd. My unde never saw him again. In a way, he got a fair exchange, since his two annas would have bought him two pieces of burfi from a sweetmeat vendor on the street. But every time he told the story, my unde would shake his head and mourn, \"1 am sti11 thinking of all the things 1 could have wished for.\" As a boy, I firmly believed Bara Uncle's story, but in contemporary India, people are more likely to see a sadhu and skeptically wonder if he is real. Starríng in the 1920s, scientists from Europe and America began to visit India to observe the various swamis, yogis, and sadhus of every description. Some had attained remarkable degrees of control over their bodies-they could apparently stop breathing for minutes at a time or bring their heartbeats down almost to zero. A typical procedure would consist of taking one of those \"saints,\" as holy men are commonly called in India, and burying him in a box six feet underground. This was supposedly a scÍentific experiment, but of a very crude son. After a few days, when the box was unearthed, you either had a result or you didn't. The desired result would be that the saint was sti11 alive. Almost aH the physiological studies from the early days are very shallow in their ap­ proach, and many reflect this weird combinaríon of science and side­ show. A sadhu's control over his body, however, is sti11 physical and misses the point of his existence. Such people are out to break through the mask of physical appearances; in our terms, they want to leave the world \"above the line\" to find out what líes beneath. Indian life, in fact, has traditionally been arranged to make this quest possible. After a man has been educated, raised a family, and enjoyed the rewards of material existence, he is expected to take sanyasa-that is, he renounces the householder life, takes up the begging bowl, and goes off in search of something else. If you say that he is searching for God, for truth, for reality, or for himself, all of these would not be quite right, because the essence of the quest is that the goal is unknown. He is setting off into another world that cannot be tracked from this one. To use our terms again, he is setting out across the gap. 165"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"QUANTUM HEALING 1 grew up to put on a Western-style suit and step around saints on the sidewalk, but as 1 looked deeper into the issues of mind-body medicine, 1 kept returning to India's ancient traditions. The second part of this book centers on what 1 have found. The known world of our senses, of atoms and molecules, does not just break off abruptly; it shades imper­ ceptibly into a different reality. At sorne point, however, one reality flips into another. Time and space acquire a different meaning; the neat divi­ sions between inner and outer reality disappear. We find ourselves in a world that has never been explored as well as in India. In his purest form, the sadhu is an investigator into the transcendental reality lying beyond the gap-that is the tradition he upholds, one of the longest and wisest on our planet. To understand his findings will take us on a new road, away from physics, but still on much the same track, in search of ourselves. In the West, befo re the advent of the theory of relativi ty, there was no question that time, space, matter, and energy occupied separate com­ partments of reality. Our senses detect a tree as entirely different from a beam of light or a spark of electricity; we may feel that time is a more mysterious entity, capable of slowing down, speeding up, or even stand­ ing still, but we would never say, \"1 like New York better than Mon­ day.\" It seems self-evident that time and space, matter and energy, are opposite pairs, for the simple reason that none can be turned into the others. The normal world of the senses can be diagrammed in our famil­ iar manner: Time/Space/Matter/Energy -«====== Gap ~==== ? After Einstein published the equation E=mc 2 , this simple, common­ sense view had to change, for it was now possible (as the atomic bomb 166"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"IN THE RISHI'S WORLD proved) for matter tú be transformed into huge amounts of energy. The general theory of relativity did the same thing for the separation be­ tween time and space. Now physics dea1s in a fused entity called space­ time, which can be bent to fit certain circumstances (whenever an object travels near the speed of 1ight, for example). After proving that namre was much less compartmentalized than science had previously thought, relativity opened another, even more smprising possibility. Einstein sug­ gested that one underlying fie1d exists as the background for all transfor­ ma!Íons of space-tíme and mass-energy. This implies a level of natme that is totally fused; ín other words, there is a regíon of space-time­ matter-energy. Einstein was intuitively convinced of this possibility-the ultimate demolition of the world of the senses-at a time when no one else had the vision ro consider it seriously. Beginning in the 1920s, he spent the last thírty years of his Efe, isolated from the other physicists of his generation and largely ignored, trying to compute the mathematics for a \"unified field theory.\" His theory would uní te aU the basic forces in creation and thereby explain the universe as a whole. Instead of four compartments, there would be one. \"To unite,\" in the sense that physicists use the word, means to prove that two things that appear to be totally different can transform into each other at a deeper level of natme. The photon and the light wave are classic examples of this: they appear to be entirely different, yet at an infinitesimal level of natme, caUed the Planck scale, which is more than a billion billion times smaller than the smallest atom, the photon and the light wave can be united. No one has yet solved the mathematics for a unified field. That would be as much as solving the entire hidden zone we have labeled wíth a ? (A new theory, however, called the superstring may have cracked the problem at last, thirty years after Einstein's death.) In the face of a problem that rational thought cannot solve, sdence necessarily stops, but other routes may be open. Thousands of years ago, the andent rishis, or seers, of India al so contemplated this question of whether natme ís ultimately unified. A rishi is like a sadhu in that his 167"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"----------------- --------------- QUANTUM HEALING life is devoted to silence and the inner life, but rishis lived much further in the past-they were responsible for writing the most ancient texts of Veda, or revealed truth, such as Rig Veda, which may predate the Egyp­ tian pyramids by several thousand years. If you ask a modern Indian what the Veda is, he will point to the books that contain the rishis' words, but in truth Veda is the content of the rishis' consciousness, which is alive. A rishi has seen deep enough into the nature of things that even God sits at his feet to learn-the les son can be found in the Yoga Vasishtha, in which the young Lord Rama, adivine incarnation, begs the sage Vasishtha for instruction. I am not emphasizing the spiritual value of the rishi and his knowl­ edge here. Until very recently in human history, all cultures freely blended religion, psychology, philosophy, and art into one homogeneous whole. But individual strands can be pulled out; in this case, I am interested in what the rishis had to say about the fundamental nature of reality (in the Yoga Vasishtha, God also showed a lively interest in this subject). The rishis were just as capable as we are of dividing nature up into space, time, matter, and energy, but they turned their backs on such an approach, which so totally dominates our way of seeing and thinking about the world. They chose instead to solve the problem in the most practical way imaginable. They decided to cross the gap and actually enter the ? zone, where thinking cannot go. They used a simple twist in their awareness, but one that has profound consequences-it was like turning the objec­ tive world inside out. To do that, the rishis had to analyze nature in an unexpected way, which can be represented by another diagram: WakinglSleepinglDreaming ~==== Gap ~==== ? 168 \" "},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"IN RISHI'S WORLD This díagram is just as valid as the one on page 166, but it looks on the world from a purely subjective viewpoint. Rather than seeing time, space, matter, and energy \"out there,\" the rishis observed that reality begins \"in here,\" with Out conscious awareness. At any particular time, they reasoned, a person must be in one of three states of subjective awareness-wakíng, sleeping, or dreaming. What perceives in these states constitutes his reality. The ancients assumed that reality was rhus different in different states of consciousness-a tiger in the dream state is not a in the wabng state. It obeys entirely different laws, and similarly, the laws of the sleep state, although not known ro the con­ scious mind, must be distinct from those of the waking and dreaming states. The rishi8 looked closer and detected between each of these states a gap that acts like a pivot as one reality turns into another. Por example, just before falling asleep, the mind gradually leaves the waking state, withdrawing the senses, shutting out the waking world, but at the junction point before the mind actually falls asleep, a brief gap i5 opened, identical ro the one that flashes by between each thought: it i5 like a litde window into the field that is beyond either wakefulness or sleep. This realization opened the possibility for leaving behind the usual boundaries of the five senses by diving through the gap. Considering that the West is supposed to be practical and the East mystical, it is fascinating to find that rishis were much more avid for direct experience than any quantum physicist. Their subjective approach was called Yoga, the Sanskrit word for \"union.\" (The various exercises taught in yoga classes belong to just one of its branches, called Harha Yoga; we will looking at Yoga's most powerful approach, which is mental.) Because both are looking for an underlying layer of unity in nature, one can immediately see the resemblance between Yoga and Einstein's quest for a unified field theory. major difference between the two is that the rishis, not being theoretical, declared that the unified field exists in the real world-it is an experience and not merely a mental construct. 169"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"QUANTUM HEALING From the rishis' subjective viewpoint, the only thing that the unified field could be is another state of consciousness. They called ir simply tttriya, or the fourth, ro denote that i t was not part of the three states of waking, sleeping, and dreaming. They al so referred ro it as para, or beyond, meaning that it transcended ordinary experience. But how could a fourth state even exist? The answer was twofold. First, the seers said that the fourth state exists everywhere but is hidden by the other three states as if by a screen. (Sorne ancient texts declare that the fourth state has been mixed into the other three like milk into water, and finding ir is as difficult as separating milk from water.) Second, they said that the fourth state can be directly experienced only after the mind has tran­ scended its normal activity, which requires the special technique of med­ itation. The word rishi irself stands for a person who has learned to enter the fourth state at will and observe what is there. This ability is not \"think­ ing\" as we use the term-the whole phenomenon is an immediate expe­ rience, like recognizing the fragrance of lilacs or the sound of a friend's voice. It is immediate, nonverbal, and, unlike a flower's fragrance, rotally transforming. As they sat in meditation, deeply absorbed in their own subjective awareness, the rishis explored turiya the way we would look at the Grand Canyon. As individuals, these seers have names, but going into the transcendent blurred the edges of what we consider personal identity. Vasishtha, for example, is not just the name of one of the greatest of the ancient rishis; it stands for an integral part of Veda­ transcendental knowledge-which the man Vasishtha first cognized; ro truly know that part of Veda, one would have to be in \"Vasishtha con­ sciousness.\" In short, these sages observed existence in its purest formo For all intents and purposes, there was no way for the West to systemati­ cally test the existence of the fourth state.

When he was into the second day of his historie solo flight across the Atlantic, Lindbergh found that he had passed the limits of physical exhaustion. Fearing that he would lose control of his craft, he skirted disaster by fitfully dozing off and hoping that he remained on course. Then, as Lindbergh recounts in his autobiography, a remarkable change of awareness took place: Over and over on the second of my flight, 1 would return tO mental alertness sufficiendy to realize that 1 had been flying while 1 was neither asleep nor awake. My eyes had open. 1 had responded to my insttuments' indications and he Id generally ro compass course, but 1 had lost sense of circumstance and time. During immeasurable periods, 1 seemed to extend outside my plane and body, índependent of worldly values, appreciative of beauty, form, and color without depending upon myeyes.

Veda represents an 1mmense expanSlOn of the human mind. The best way to describe it is that Veda is the total content of the cosmic com­ puter. All the input of nature is channeled into it, and out of it flows all natural phenomena. The control over this computer is located in the human brain, whose billions of neural connections give it enough com­ plexity to mirror the complexity of the universe. The brain is not important as an object, the rishis contend. It is important because our own subjectivity shines through it; when our brains show us the world, they are really showing us ourselves. By anal­ ogy, when an image falls upon a mirror, a blending takes place. The mirror is the reflection; the reflection is the mirror. In the same way, the only reality we can know anything about is the one that is being mir­ rored in the brain-everything that exists is therefore inside our subjec­ tivity. A physicist would not normally agree with this, since he cherishes the objective method and looks on subjectivity as virtually his enemy. A physicist says, \"This is a proton,\" not, \"This is my feeling for what a proton is.\" Actually, Veda is not devoid of objective knowledge-it gave rise to its own sciences of botany, physiology, astronomy, medicine, et cetera-but the rishis did not feel that objectivity was the most reliable way to know things, particularly once you investigate deeper than na­ ture's surface. The truth, they said, is that subjectivity can be either narrow or expanded. Nature is like a radio bando When you pay atten­ tion to an isolated object-a rock, a star, or an entire galaxy-you select one channel on the bando The rest obviously has to be excluded-but only for that level of consciousness. It may be that other levels of consciousness receive more bands, or more than one band at a time. Right now, physicists estimate that our senses choose less than one-billionth of the energy waves and particles that surround uso We live in an \"energy soup\" incredibly larger than the 172 \" "},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"IN THE RISHI'S WORLD world we see. The visible universe itself is now thought to be but a minuscule version of the original creation, the residue of a much reality that collapsed somewhere before time began, reducing its original ten dimensions to our four. (1 apologize for using the phrase \"before time began,\" which is a blatant paradox, but there is no way to state verbally how pre-Big Bang events occurred.) Also, it appears that at the moment of creation our universe was filled with a billion times more energy than we now observe with radio telescopes; the remainder was reabsorbed into the same hidden field where the other six dimensions went. The rishis dedared that through expanded consciousness, even this inconceivable lost reality could be made available to uso Theoretical physics agrees rhar rhe lost dimensions and invisible energy fields have nor actually gone anywhere; they have only sunk back to \"sleep\" in rhe primordial field. Similarly, the transcendentallevel of awareness is avail­ able everywhere; you need nor go anywhere special to find it. It only needs to wake up. \\XTilliam James expressed this idea in a famous pas­ sage: Our normal waking consciousness, rarional consciousness as we call ir, is but one special type of consciousness, whilst all around parted from it by the flimsiest of screens, there líe poremial forms of consciousness endrely differem, We may go through life without suspecring their exis­ tence; but apply rhe requisite stimulus, and ar a touch they are rhere in aH their completeness. If so much more reality is nearby, why can't we touch it? Researchers found a due to the answer, curiously enough, by experimenting with newborn kittens. Kitrens are born with their eyes shut and their optíc nerves undeveloped. When they open their eyes, the mechanism for sight matures at the same time; these two events always go hand in hand. However, it was found in the mid-1970s that if you blindfold a kitten during the two or three days when it first apens its eyes, the 173"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"QUANTUM HEALING animal will be blind for life. During this brief but critical period, the experience of seeíng actually shapes the ínter-neuronal connections in the brain that make sight possible. This was an important finding, for biologists continue to disagree over whether genetics or experience is more important in behavior. This is the old question of whether a trait is innate or acquired. Does a robín learn to sing from its mother, or will ir if raised in isolation? The experíment with the blind kittens showed that both \"nature\" and \"nur­ ture\" are essential; the kitten's brain is programmed for sight, yet ít requires seeing for the programming ro unfold properly. There is a deeper implication ro aH this, however. Our own brains could be limited in just this way. Many things \"out there\" don't for us, not because they are unreal, but because \"in here\" we have not shaped the brain to perceive them. We are like radios that appear to have all the channels when actually they are stuck on three-waking, sleeping, and dreaming. Because your brain is the only radio you have, you can never know whether the fourth state exists unless your nervous system is prepared for ir. It is entirely possible that we are literally bathed and surrounded by the transcendent and yet have not tuned it in. The Veda gives a supporting analogy: thoughts are like ocean waves. Rising and fallíng, they see only their own motion. They say, \"1 am a wave,\" but the greater tmth, whích they do not see, \"1 am ocean.\" There is no separatíon between the two, whatever the wave might sup­ pose. When a wave settles down, then it instantly recognizes that its source in ocean-infinite, silent, and unchanging-was always there. The same holds tme for the mind. When it is thinking, it is all activity; when it stops thinking, it returns ro its source in Gnly then, when the mind rouches pure awareness, will the real srorehouse of Veda be located. The experience of Veda therefore is not ancient or even particularly Indian. It is universal and can be had at any moment by any persono The whole trick is not ro move horizontally, which is how the stream of consciousness normally moves, but ro sink vertically.

If this argument is right, then the nature of the mind and the mind­ body connection have to be reconsidered. The point that Archimedes was looking place to stand on and move the world-actually exists. Ir is inside us, covered up by the fascinating but misleading moving-picture show of the waking state. This may explain why mind-body medicine has proved so inconsis­ tent. We casually assume that a person who survíves cancer or can cure himself of a fatal disease operates with the same mental machinery as anyone else, but this is not tme: mental processes can be deep or shallow. To go deep means to contact the hidden blueprint of intelligence and change it-only then can visualization of nghting cancer, for example, be strong enough ro defeat the disease. But most people cannot do that; their thought power is too weak ro trigger the appropriate mechanisms. The practical question is whether meditation is strong enough ro radi­ cally improve our thought power. Several studies conducted by scientists have shown that meditation may in fact induce profound change, far beyond the simple relaxation that most people use it for in the West, even beyond the medical applications of relieving stress, reducing blood préssure, and so on. The first Western scientist ro make any major breakthrough with the fourth state was an American physiologist, Robert Keith \\1(1allace, who proved that it existed. In 1967, Wallace was a doctoral student at VeLA, where he began his Ph.D. research on the physiological changes that take place during Transcendental Meditation (a form of mantra meditaríon). Vsing the methods of modern biomedical research, he com­ piled data from meditators over a period of several years. Without caus­ ing any discomfort, he wired them up to measure their brain waves, blood pressure, heart rate, and other indices of physical change. Wallace soon began to build a considerable body of unique results. 175"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"QUANTUM HEALING First, he discovered that something real was indeed happening to the body in meditation. Within a few minutes of beginning their practice, his subjects a state of deep relaxation, marked by slower breath­ ing and hearrbear, by rhe appearance of alpha waves in their EEGs (electroencephalograms), and decreased oxygen consumption detected in the breath. This last measure was particularly important because ir showed thar the body's metabolic rate, tied to the total consumption of fuel in the ceUs, had dropped-physiologists refer to rhis metabolic reduction as a \"hypometabolic\" state. Meditators achieved their deepest relaxation quickly. Ir takes four to six hours after falling asleep to the period where oxygen consump­ tion falls to its lowest levels, while meditators took only a few minutes. Moreover, in sleep the drop is usually less than 16 percent, whereas meditators achieved relative reductions that momentarily dipped almost twice as low. Wallace was impressed by figures because such a deep state of relaxation had never been before. What this showed was that the subjective feelings reported during meditation-inner silence, peacefulness, and relaxation-had a real physical basis. It was also very important that these subjects had nor fallen or gone into a trance. They were fully awake inside, even feeling a sense of heightened aware­ ness. Wallace concluded therefore that meditation was a state of \"hy­ pometabolic wakefulness.\" Since his measurements were different from any seen in waking, dreaming, or sleeping, he concluded that he had verified an entirely new state of consciousness-the fourth state. Certain of the meditators had exhibited physical that went far beyond the average. As with the yogis measured in India and the Hima­ layas, their breathing seemed to Stop for long stretches. At the subjective level, these deeper states were experienced as absolute inner a feeling of vast expansion, and a profound knowingness. The mind was emptied of aH specific thoughts bur left wÍrh the clear awareness of \"1 know everything.\" No one couId explain these experiences, U,\"'\"aL'''''­ entific instruments are too crude to analyze or even detect them. To anyone versed in the Vedic líterature, however, it was obvious that 176 l"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"IN THE RISHI'S WORLD these subjects were experiencing transcendental awareness of a deep sort. The Yoga Vasishtha, one of the greatest sources on direct experience of the transcendent, says of the fourth state, \"When there is effortless sus­ pension of breath, that is the supreme state. It is the Self. It is pure, infinite consciousness. He who reaches this does not grieve.\" It would be hard ro find a description of what the physiologists were seeing. Wallace looked at physical measurements made with meditators in Japan and found comparable results; what was astonishing, however, was that hís American subjects, most of them young, posthippie, and new ro meditatíon, were achievíng the same scores as Zen adepts who had prac­ ticed meditatíng for ten years. Seen in a different light, what Wallace did was to legitímize the mind-body connectíon. Ir is now accepted fact that one's body spontane­ ously responds ro one's state of awareness, just as the rishis said. The paradox is that we have ro learn to dive inside at all. Meditation teaches us to control a process that ís constandy influencing us every day, whether we realize it or noto Recently I saw a Boston woman in her síxties who for several years had been suffering from a slow degeneratíon of the heart muscle called cardiomyopathy. There are various kinds of cardíomyopathy; hers was considered idiopathic, meaning that no cause could be found for it. Her main symprom at the tíme of diagnosis was shortness of breath whenever she exerted herself.-she was experiencing heart failure from the enlarge­ ment of her heart. Medicine can do litde or nothing for this disease, which greatly worried her, but when she had last seen her cardiologist two months earlier, he had suggested that she go into the hospital for an angiogram. The purpose of an angiogram is ro determine if the coronary the vessels sending oxygen to the heart, are blocked. The cardiologist was reasoning that if there was any blockage, sorne of her problem might be due to arterial disease, which is treatable. Apprehensively she C'U'-'I.JL­ went the test. The angiographer, who was also a physician, carne ro her room afterward."},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"QUANTUM HEALING \"1 have good news,\" he said. \"Your vessels are don't have coronary artery disease. As far as I'm concerned, there is no need for surgery.\" As he was leavíng, he turned to her and remarked, \"lf your condition gets any worse, the only thíng that really can be done is ro have a heart transplant.\" The woman had never been rold this before, and within a few days she began to have shortness of breath not just on exertion but whenever she lay down. Unable ro sleep and getting more and more anxious, she returned ro her cardiologist, who could find no reason for the worsening of her symproms. Finally he confronted her one day, and she told him she was afraid of havíng a heart transplant. He assured her thar her fears were groundless-her conditíon was by no means advanced enough for such a drasric procedure. From that day on, her new symproms disap­ peared. Once again we see that subjective reabry and objective reality are tightly bound rogether. When the mind shit1:s, the body cannor help but follow. Objective reality looks obviously more fixed than our subjective moods, fleeting desires, and swings of emorion.

The important point is that everything you think and do is deter­ 178"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"IN THE RISHI'S WORLD mined by this poínt-you cannot thínk yourself to a higher or lower level of consciousness. This helps explain why meditation is not simply another kind of thinking or introspectíon, a mistake Wesrerners tend to make. It is actually a way to slide ro a new pitch. The process of tran­ scending, or \"going beyond,\" de raches the mind from its fixed level and allows it to exist, if only for a moment, without any level at aH. It simply experiences silence, devoid of thoughts, emotions, drives, wishes, fears, or anything at all. Afterward, when the mind returns to its usual pitch (leve! of consciousness), it has acguired a little freedom to move. From a medical standpoint, a disease may represent a place on the violin string that is out of tune. Yet, for sorne reason, the mind-body system cannot find a way to let go, to slide to a healthier pitch. If that is so, then meditaríon may be a powerful therapeutic tool, allowing the body to unstuck from the disease. Meditatíon researchers caught on to this potential in the 1960s when they discovered that many coHege-age meditators who used alcohol, cigarettes, and recreational dtugs spontaneously guit their habit within a few months of beginning to meditate. We can caH this getting unstuck from an old leve! consciousness that needed the dtug; in terms of neutopeptides, it may be that the meditation freed up certain receptor si tes by offering molecules that were more satisfying than alcohol, nicotine, or marijuana. By 1978, Robert Keith \\Vallace had spent more than a decade validating separate mind-body effects on meditators. He decided to follow a new lead and investigate a more complex, holistic area, human aging. The aging process has traditionally been accepted without guestion as an inevitable aspect of normallife, and variations in ir have been considered largely individual. Sorne people Uve longer than others owing to privi­ leged genes, a strong immune system, or good luck, but there is no antí-aging factor that can be applied to everyone. If rhere were, then 70­ year-olds would be more uniformly healthy in their bodily functions, just as most 20-year-olds are. However, there is no scientific proof thar aging is normal-ir is just 179"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"QUANTUM HEALING something we all happen to do. So many stresses are involved in \"nor­ mal\" living rhar physiology might be considered under abnormal pressure aH noise, pollution, negative emotions, im­ proper diet, smoking, alcohol, and so on.

Wallace set out to measure a group of adult meditarors for what is called biological Biological age shows how well a person's body is functioning compared to the norms of the whole population. Ir gives a truer meaSure of how the process is progressing than does chrono­ logical or calendar age, because any two people who are both 55 years old by the calendar will generally very different bodies. InitiaHy, all that Wallace needed ro test were rather simple variables: blood pressure, acuteness of hearing, and near-point vision (the abiEty to see objects close-up). AH three steadily deteriorate as the body biologically ages and therefore serve as conveníent markers. Wallace discovered that the meditarors, as a group, were significantly younger bíologically than their chronological age. The difference be­ tween the two was not small, either-the female subject who scored the best was fully twenty years younger than her chronological age. Strik­ ingly, how much younger a person tested was closely correlated ro how long he had kept up his meditation practice. Wallace found a dividing Ene between those who had meditated fewer than five years and those who had meditated five years or more. The first group five years younger biologically, while the second averaged twelve years younger. A backup study conducted in England later calculated that year of regular meditation takes off roughly one year of aging. Another finding that particularly impressed Wallace's team was that their oIder subjects showed as good results as much younger people. A typical 60-year-old meditating five years or more would have the physiology of a 41'\\_\\1\"\" oId. Another important point raised by this remarkable study 1S that the 180 ..

To the rishis, the whole world has been built up, layer by layer, out of sheer abstraetion. Because you wíllingly give yourself over to ir, a J ohn Wayne western seems real, even though you know it is just beams of light bouncing off a fiat white surface. A dream eonsists entirely of neurologi­ cal impulses firing in your brain, but as long as you are in it, you are convinced by its reality. (Everyone is familiar wíth that faint, dísap­ 184 lA"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"BIRTH OF A DISEASE pointing moment that comes when the dream stops being convincing. Instead of flying through the air, you begin ro sense that \"it is only a dream,\" and after a brief struggle, the waking world comes back.) In the same way, the reality you accept in the waking state is known ro you only from impulses firing in your brain. When you touch a flower, the act of rouching brings rogether the force and marter fields in your hand with the force and matter fields in the flower. All of these fields are highly abstract, yet touch does not seem abstract ro you. You are convinced by it. The rishis placed a huge emphasis on how much we all convince ourselves. A famous parable for this was given by Shankara, the greatest philosophical mind in the Vedic tradition: Aman is walking down the road in the evening and sees a large snake coiled in the dust. He runs away terrified and stirs up everyone with his cries of \"Snake, snake!\" The people of his village are also terrified; the women and children don't want ro go outside because of the snake, and normallife begins ro be overshadowed by everyone's apprehension. Then a brave person resolves to look at this snake. He asks the first man ro take hím tO it, and when they get there, what they find is not a snake but a rope coiled in the middle of the road. All out fears, Shankara said, have been built up from just such a delusion. In fact, nothing real can be separated from what we tell ourselves is real. This line of reasoning is not specifically Indian-it can be easily adapted ro a modern frame ofreference. Think of what happens when two bar magnets come rogether with their norrh poles facing each other. The magnetic field repels them aparto If these were thinking magnets, they would something solid in between themselves. They would create touch out of an abstraction, jUSt as we all do. The reason why, when you rouch it, an object feels soft, hard, ragged, smooth, et cetera, is that such an interpretatíon is made in your brain. Essentially, the five senses are just rools. Touch is really the brain reach­ íng out into the world, usíng specialized nerve cells ro register certain 185 ------------_ ........... _­"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"QUANTUM HEALING information-a very narrow band, we must remember, which is entirely different from what a snake \"touches\" when its rongue flicks the air. Similarly, the nerve endings coating the retina of YOut eye are also extensions of the brain. Structurally, the retina is just a pool of nerve endings fanning out like the frayed end of a rope, the rope being the optic nerve, which gathers a million separate nerve fibers into one bun­ dled cord. Even though they are located deeper inside you than the nerve endings under YOut skin, the eye's sensory cells are also \"rouching\" the outside world. There is no intrinsic difference between the field of light contacted by yout eye and the energy field you touch with YOut the real distinction between seeing and touching is made in the brain. And so it goes for every other sense: hearing, smelling, and tasting involve specialized cells that send impulses directly to the brain for interpretatíon, and without that interpretation nothing could exisr. All things in existence are tied ro Out senses, and our senses are tíed ro our brains. The commonsense notion that \"this chair is hard ro (he rouch\" is not true, until you restate it as \"this chair is hard because my brain made it that way.\" (The chair is not hard at all to a cosmic ray, which zips through it like air. A neutrino zips through the whole Earth with egual ease.) Using this insight, the rishis went even further. They noticed that you do not have to touch an object physically to know how it feels. Answer this guestion: Which is softer, a starched linen napkín or a rose petal? You can easily compare the two in your mind, using an image of touch, without having ro go out and find a real napkin and a real rose.

A disease is not the molecular contact of sorne outside organism with the molecules of your body.

The eminent neurologist Sir John Eccles stated this quite clearly when he wrote, \"1 want you to realize that there is no color in the natural world and no sounds-nothing of this kind; no textures, no patterns, no beauty, no scent ... \" In short, nothing is so important about the universe as your participation in ir. 188 \" "},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"BIRTH OF A DISEASE The rishis' subjective approach found an enormously useful outlet in Ayurveda.

Ir comes from two Sanskrit roots, AyuJ, or \"Efe,\" and Vedc¿, which means either \"knowledge\" or \"science.\" The literal meaning, then, is \"science of life.\") Patients are curious to know what kinds of treatments are specífically Ayurvedic-are there new piUs to try, exercises, diets, or more arcane Eastern thetapies? 1 say yes to all of these, but then with sorne embar­ rassment 1 have to add that 1 spend much of my time just talking, trying to get people not to be so convinced by their disease. In Ayurveda, this is the first and most important step in healing. As long as the patient is convinced by his symptams, he is caught up in a reality whete \"beíng sick\" is the dominant input. The teason why meditatíon is so important in Ayurveda is that it leads the mind to a zone\" that is not touched by disease. Until you know that such a place exists, your disease will seem to be taking over completely. This is the principal delusion that needs to be shatteted. It is undeniable that we all create scenatios and then become con­ vínced by them, down to OUt very cells. A young girl from Bostan who went to college in Vermont was brought in to see me recently by her parents. They had become quite distraught when she showed up in the middle of spring term with sharp chest pains. These had set in while she was tecovering from a cold and over a period of a week became alarm­ ingly severe. One night the girl had abad attack-she began to experi­ ence shortness of breath, palpitations, and dizziness, eventually growing so frightened that her parents rushed her to the nearest emergency room. By the time they got there, whole family was in a state of near panie. The ER doctor listened to the girl's heart, detected that she had a slight heart mutmur, and decided to run an EKG, or electrocardiogram. The EKG read-out showed occasional ectopic beats, meaning extra beats 189"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"QUANTUM HEALING that were outside the heart rhythm. then used ultrasound to perform a more sophisticated test, called an echo-cardiogram, from which he discerned an actual heart defecto \"She has mitral valve prolapse,\" he informed the family. This meant that when one of her heatt valves closed, it ballooned inward, toward the chamber of the heatt. \"1 want her to spend the night here in the inten­ sive ca re unit,\" he continued, and within an hour the girl was taken upstaírs, hooked to an intravenous drip of morphine for her pain, and supplied with extra oxygen through small tubes taped to her nose. Around her were heart-attack and stroke victims, sorne of them obvi­ ously dying. She found the whole highly distressing and began to hallucinate from the morphine as drifted off to sleep. The next morning, a careful examinatíon of her tests led the doctors tO diagnose that her pain was probably due not only to the mitral valve prolapse but to pericarditis, an inflammation of the pericardium, the covering around the heart. She was released on anti-inflammatory agents for this, as well as beta blockers ro slow her heart rateo The pain in her chest subsided; however, she found it impossible ro tolerate the beta blockers-besides affecting the heart, these drugs attach to recep­ tors in the brain, causing drowsiness and mental disorientation. Her medications were changed, only ro bring on new side effects and expand her constellation of symptoms. The new prescriptions were meant to dilate her blood vessels, but this lowered her blood pressure too much, causing her to feel dizzy and nauseated; at times she would faint without warning. She managed to tolerate these side effects, largely because she wanted to stay in school at any cost. Every time she tried to cut back on her medication, even slightly, the original chest pain re­ turned in full force, accompanied by her other symptoms. She carne home for summer vacation and horrified her parents by clutching her chest one evening at dinner. She started to hyperventilate so severely that her mother went scurrying ro find a paper bag for her to breathe into. Within a few minutes, she felt violent heart palpitations, began to 190"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"BIRTH OF A DISEASE vomit, and eventuaHy passed out. Her parents sat up with her aH that night and many nights to come. Since there was nothing more that her doctors could do, the family cast about for other approaches. They hit upon a news story about Ayurveda, and one July day all three, mother, father, and daughter, carne to the Lancaster clinic. I took a very detailed medical history from the girl, looked at her EKGs, and found myself quite surprised. \"Your pain isn't from your heart,\" 1 toId her, and to prove ir 1 pressed firmly on her sternum, the bone in the middle of the chest that covers the heart. She flinched. \"You're sti11 tender because what you originally had was an inflammation there, where the rib cartilage and the sternum meet. It is a condition called costo-chondritis, which can sorne times set in after a cold or other viral infection.\" She and her parents looked startled, but 1 went on, taking apart the puzzle piece by piece. On the night they had rushed her to the ER, her high anxiety caused her to exhibit the occasional ectopic, or extra, heart­ beats. Her maln diagnosis, mitral valve prolapse, may occut in as many as 10 percent of young women with slendet builds like hers. The reason for this is not known, nor is there condusive evidence for why it should cause any pain, although in some patients it does. Similarly, the heart mutmur that comes with it does not seem to be dangerous. Her pericar­ ditis was a misreading of her EKG-the violence of her attack had probably made the ER doctor overanxious to find something wrong. The remaining symptoms-nausea, vomiting, heart palpitations, dizziness, fainting, shortness of breath, and hyperventilarion-were brought on either by the medications or directly by her. \"1 have tried to go back to the moment when your condition was born,\" 1 said, \"ta show you how it built itself up, step by step. In ltS present form, your disease is a reflex. It is being kept alive by your own expectations. \" At this point the girl's parents looked quite offended. 1 knew the anxiety they feh sitting up all night, worrying that she might be in real danger.

The era of mind-body medicine has made this an extremely sore point. Life was simpler when a without a germ was considered \"all in your head.\" The germs have been pushed back, but instead of leaving us free of disease, this has made disease far more enigmatic.

She listened and thanked me, then 1 heard nothing more for two weeks. Perhaps 1 had touched too many nerves. 1 had been making her disease more and more personal, when what the family desperately hoped for was thar it was impersonal. Conventional medicine goes out of its way ro put diseases into neat, classifiable boxes just so that rhe personal element is eliminated. 1 had noticed while interviewing her thar this girl placed a huge importance on her diagnosis. She would preface each episode by saying, \"When 1 get my mitral valve pro­ lapse ... \" It was as if these words explained everything. They were like a net that drew together aH her symptOms and held rhem tight. When 1 mentioned this, she looked very thoughtful. She had invested so much in the words mitral Mlve prolapse that they had acquired a kind of magic for her. It was essential ro break the speH of this magic, which can be uncanníly powerful. 1 was wrong if 1 thoughr she hadn't taken out session ro heart. Out of curiosity 1 phoned the family to see how she was doing. The news was very good: she was off all medications and her attacks were now limited to occasional bouts of chest pain. Her parents would sometimes see her sitting with her eyes closed. When they asked what she was doing, she said, \"1 just watch the pain until it goes away.\" The accompanying symptoms-dizziness, vomiting, fainting, et cetera-have disappeared. In psychology there are certain extreme feelings-such as loathing, dread, horror, and awe-that many people cannot face. When these people grow horrified or struck with awe, they could swear that theír emotion comes from outside themselves. In cases of paranoia, rhe person might even think that \"they\" are broadcasting such feelings into him through sorne kind of magic. (\"They\" can be Martians, communists, or next-door neighbors.) Freud called these our \"uncanny\" emotions and spent many years observing them in neurotic and psychotic patients. Bur uncanniness is always present, 1 think.

Then the twin thought arises, \"ls this happening to me, or am 1 doing it to myself?\" lt doesn't really matter if the end result is a disease or just a sense of extreme discomfort. The important thing is to keep the patient from getting twisted up in his doubts-that way lies total paral­ ySlS. Medicine has already paid a very high price for not dealing adeguately wirh the personal nature of disease. Por one thing, we have aroused guilt without being able to assuage it. People are horrifled at the idea that they are to blame for their diseases. Doctors don't think they are sroking this guilt. Perhaps ir was born out of being told over and over that no one is to blame. But if you say that living right will help prevent a heart attack or cancer, don't you have to accept that living wrong will help bring on the same diseases? The whole issue of blame and responsibility is painful to untangle. When 1 had my private practice in endocrinology, 1 would see obese patients whose weight put them at high risk for becoming diabetic. 1 would warn them about the danger of continuing ro eat too much; at the same time, 1 knew 1 was feeding their guilt, which would only lead to more eating. lf a patient was a chain-smoker, 1 would be very flrm and say, \"My God, you know you have to guit smoking-think of the risks you are running.\" Many of these patients were ex-servicemen 1 saw at the V.A. hospital in Boston. After listening to me, they could go to the PX upstairs, where government-subsidized cigarettes were being sold at a steep discount. (1 bought mine there, too, having become a smoker during my night shifts as an intern.) In fact, no disease points up the paradoxes of blame and responsibility better than lung cancer. The public is well aware that this is almost exclusively a smoker's illness. That puts the responsibility sguarely on the patient, but then a second thought enters. Aren't these people ad­ dicted to nicotine?

This means that one is not dealing with a rational situation. Sigmund Freud attempted for many years to stop smoking after being informed by his doctor that twenty cigars a day-Freud's normal rarion -was bad for his heart. He sropped once for seven weeks, but his heart went into palpitations worse than before. He became intolerably de­ pressed and was forced back to his cigars. When he didn't smoke, Freud told his biographer, \"the torture was beyond human power to bear.\" 1 have witnessed advanced Iung cancer patients waiting for radiation who walk around a corner ro smoke a cigarette-this implies that prevention may be impossible, because it would have to start before the first ciga­ rene gets smoked. In every dísease, not just Iung cancer, the patients are often too hooked, too guiIty, or simply too convinced to be helped. There is no denying the deeply irrational streak in mano At the V.A. hospital we rook in every variety of alcoholic, including the dilapidated, malnour­ ished ones that were routinely swept in off the streets by the police. One of the most frequent conditions in advanced alcoholism is pancreatitis, or inflammation of the pancreas. Everyone brought in with pancreatitis had to be treated with great care. They could not eat or digest food, because calling on the pancreas only made it more inflamed and ex­ tremely painful. Patients would vomit if they tried ro eat even one bite.

Their first drink carne ten minutes after their cure. Com­ passion for these people has irs limirs. Anyone could be forgiven for saying, \"If you want to smoke and drink, if you don't exercise and insist on eating cholesterol, then too bad for you.\" Undeniably people do say such things, or at least think them. But the essence of compassion lies in recognizing how hard ir is to be good. To forgive someone is to let him be free, even if he abuses that freedom beyond exasperation. There is a story in India about the sadhu and the scorpion: Aman is walking down the road when he spots a sadhu kneeling beside a dirch. He approaches and sees that the sadhu is watching a scorpion. The scorpion wants to cross the ditch, but when he gets into the muddy water, he begins to drown. The sadhu carefully reaches down to pull him out of the water, but as soon as he touches it, the scorpion stings him. The scorpion goes into the water again, again ir begins to drown, and when the sadhu lifts ir out, he receives another sting. The man sees this happen three times. Finally he blurts, \"Why don't you stop allowing yourself to be stung?\" The sadhu replies, \"There is nothing I can do. It is the scorpion's nature to sting, but it is my nature to save.\" The reason that society has set up the institution of medicine is to ensure that our instinct to save one another never dies. Ir is the same instinct that sees no blame in another person's weakness; it freely takes responsibility for troubles that are not its own. If I ever walked into a hospital and detected there that the spark of compassion had gone out, I could wrire the end of medicine-darkness will have won. Modern medicine is still dominated by the notion that disease is caused by objective agents. A sophisticated analysis shows that this is only partly true. A disease cannot take hold without a host who accepts it, hence the current attempts to understand our immune system. Histori­ cally, both Greek medicine and Ayurveda were founded on the idea that the host is all-important. The Greeks believed that there was a fluid called physis that flowed in, out, and through all of life. The flow of 196"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"BIRTH OF A DISEASE physis tied the organs inside the body with the world outside, and as long as the two were in balance, the body would be healthy. (This prem1se 1S still reflected in our use of the word physics to explain the outer world and the related physiology ro explain the inner.) In Ayurveda, it takes the balance of three elements, called doshas, to maintain health. The point 1S nor wherher physis or doshas exist, but that one's own state of balance determines wherher one 1S sick or well. Medicine is coming back to this norion, rhe oldest in all the healing arts, but 1 notice that an impersonal air still hangs over everything. We are setting up a concrete thing called the immune system and pinning our hopes onto it. The original idea, as voiced by the Greeks and by Ayutveda, was much more organic. A patient was not a collection of host cells but someone who ate, drank, thought, and acted. If a doctor wanted ro change someone's doshas or his physis, he changed his habits. In this way, he right ro the root of the patient's participatíon ín the world. There are dozens of medical systems in the world, many of them deeply in conflict with one another. How can they cure people and yet disagree so completely? What is poi son to me is cure ro a homeopath. 1 think the answer is that all medicine works by helping a patient live through his disease, moment by moment, until the balance swings away from sickness toward cure. 1 cannot be more specific, because the process does not happen in books but in living persons. People have drunk grape juice and recovered from cancer. If you can successfully restore balance ro the bodymind, then rhe patient's 1mmune system will respondo The immune cells do not judge whether the doctor believes in conventional medicine, homeopathy, or Ayurveda. Insofar as it can change our partici­ pation in disease, every system 1S capable of working. 1 think Ayurveda wiU rise ro prominence, however, because it recognizes the need ro cure patients by curing their reality first. More and more 1 fee! the importance of the patíent's personal reality. A míddle-aged doctor, a radiolog1st, carne ro see me after he was diag­ nosed with leukemia. He was extreme!y sophisticated in h1S knowledge of the disease, an unpredictable form called chronic myelogenous leuke­ 197"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"QUANTUM HEALING mía, meaning that it affected the white blood ceUs called myelocytes. As yet he felt nothing beyond sorne fatigue during the day, but the mortal­ ity statístics, which he also knew well, were grim. They said that the average survival was thirty-six ro forty-four months. On the other hand, because the disease is unpredictable, he could much longer. Before coming to me, he had consulted the leading cancer institute in New York City. They had made extensive tests on his blood and offered him a choice of half a dozen experimental dtug protocols. No single accepted treatment for his leukemia exists; none of the experimental ones carne with any promises that his Efe expectancy would be length­ ened. Upon ref1ection, he had rejected treatment and began to read up voraciously on spontaneous remissions, including something 1 had writ­ ten. He had sought me out for that reason. As we talked, 1 saw that one particular detail was a huge stumbling block for him. \"1 want to believe 1 will recover from this,\" he told me, \"but some­ thing really worries me. 1 read about a lot of remissions from cancer, but 1 didn't tun across any spontaneous remissions from leukemia.\" One could see how his medical mind was working. The variety of leukemia he has is linked to a genetic component, called the Philadel­ phia chromosome. He had tested positive for this chromosome, and being a physician, that was the end of the srory-he was genetically marked for doom. The only chance for Ayurveda would be if it promoted a miracle. But he couldn't find any reports of leukemia in the UH'LHC;:' journals. \"Look,\" 1 said, \"you are obsessed with the statistics on this disease. Don't think about them-what you want ro do is beat the statistics, don't you?\" \"1 know, 1 know,\" he said abstractedly, \"but 1 can't find a single spontaneous remission in whole literature. 1 could be the of course, but . . .\" His voice trailed off. 1 had a brainstorm. \"Why don't you tell yourself you have sorne other 198 ,. "},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"BIRTH OF A D1SEASE cancer,\" 1 suggested. \"Then at least you would have hope for a remis­ sion.\" His face brightened, and he leaped at my suggestion. Then 1 had more good news for him. 1 had just stumbled across a review artide that connected childhood leukemia and stress. This man had a totally differ­ ent disease, but he also led an incredibly stressful life. His wife was divorcing him, his medical partners had filed a lawsuit against him, his children, now grown, did not speak to him anymore, and he had to support two houses and three Mercedeses. It was in the midst of his rancorous divorce that his diagnosis had been made, quite by accident, and now his wife insisted on staying with him. The reason she gave was her fear of being left alone after he died. \"1 just read that stress is linked to childhood leukemia,\" I offered. He beamed when he heard this, because the scientist in him made a causal link between stress, the activation of \"stress hormones\" like cortisol, and finally a suppression of the immune system. Maybe that was happening to him. No one had actually shown a link between stress and his dísease, but now he had one more straw to grasp. He went away and continued to do well. The next time he carne in, he asked me if he should go for a blood test. Leukemia causes a disastrous elevatíon in the number of white blood cells; a lower count would prove ro him that he was really getting better. \"If the counts are bad,\" I reasoned, \"then you will get depressed and put more stress on yourself. lf they are good, then you will be getting better anyway. Why not postpone the bIood test until you feel sorne symptoms?\" He agreed to this and went away again. The last time I saw him was last week. He rold me that believing has cancer instead of leukemia was working out well. \"You know,\" I said, \"why bother to caH it cancer? You could teH yourself that you have a chronic disease that has no name. If it doesn't have a name, then you won't have ro worry about any statistics.

One of the most famous concerns a youth named Svetaketu, who was sent away from home to study Veda.

The universe, like huge banyan, springs from a that contains nothing. Without a metaphor like the seed and rhe tree, out minds cannot even grasp what such a nothingness is, since ir is smaller than small and earlier than the Big Bang. The deeper mystery of the tale is that Svetaketu himself is com­ posed of rhis same all-pervading, unimaginable essence.

Like all physicists, he adhered to the objective method and scrupulously excluded his own consciousness from his theo­ ríes. His search for a unified field thar would embrace aH of time and space was a strictly mathematical enterprise. To the rishis, this is the very artitude that makes physics incomplete. We are not onlookers peering into the unified field, rhey said-we are the unified field. Every person is an infinite being, unlimited by time and space. To reach beyond the physical body, we extend the influence of intelligence. As you sit in your chair, every thought you are thinking creates a wave in the unified field. Ir ripples through all the layers of ego, intellect, mind, senses, and matter, spreading out in wider and wider circles. You are like a light radiating not photons but consciousness. As they radiate, your thoughts have an effect on everything in nature. Physics already recognizes this fact for sources of physical energy: any light, whether a star or a candle, sends its waves throughout the quan­ tum field of electromagnetism, going as far as infinity in all directions. The rishis took this principIe and made it human. Their nervous systems actually registered the distant effect that a thought produces; this was as real for them as seeing light 1S for USo But we are bounded in our awareness; being confined to the waking state keeps us from perceiving the subtle changes we are producing everywhere. Yet these changes are always presento For thousands of years, the rishis declared that man lives, breathes, and moves in the cosmic body. lf this is so, then nature is as alive as we are; the whole distinction between \"in here\" and \"our there\" is a false one, as if the heart cells disregarded the ski n cells because they were not on the insíde. Knowing this, the rishís became extremely powerful índividuals, bur not ín the ordinary sense. Where most men are interested in material power, the rishis were interested in the power of awareness. To them, the materiallevel of the world was quite crude. The real power in nature bes closer to the source, and the ultimate power must líe right at the source.

He was in the habit of doing this long before he achieved any degree of fame and position. He was placing clocks around the universe, he once recalled, before could afford ro buy a real one for his house. To the rishis, it would seem peculiar that we portion out our intelli­ gence into so many small, isolated fields of knowledge. Our social con dí­ tioning forbids the cosmic perspective, not by condemning it but by providing so much distracting busy-work. lf you are caught up in bricks and mortar, it is difficult to learn architecture. A field like medicine is now so incredibly complicated that if you say, \"This patient can be treated through the fiow of intelligence,\" sheer momentum would be against you as much as disbelief. The unbounded state is not frequently seen in our society, while its opposite is absolutely epidemic. Psychiatrísts see patients every day who are crippled by boundaries, people who have programmed guilt, anxiety, and unnameable insecurities into themselves. Those who have acquired phobias are extreme examples of this, since their deadly fear is out of all proportion ro any actual danger. lf you take an agoraphobe-someone who fears open spaces--out for a drive, he will show intense anxiety. lf you stop in an open field and ask him ro step out of car, he will be as paralyzed as a normal person who is asked ro jump off a clíff. Try to force him and he will struggle for his Efe, literally. The keenest anguish of a phobic is knowing that he has created his own condition, but his will is not enough ro break the pattern he has programmed into his physiology. (One agoraphobe in England grew so miserable and ashamed of his phobia that he decided ro end his life. The method he chose was ro drive two miles in his car, an action he was sure 204 ..

He had accidentally hit upon rhe therapy called \"flooding,\" which psychiarrists sometimes use ro wrench far-gone phobics out of unreality.) Boundaries created in silence are the mosr confining. People who have never heard of Veda generally know the word Maya, or íllusíon-ín Sanskrít, it literally means \"that which is not.\" Maya is greatly misun­ derstood-rhe rishis did nor caH the world Maya to say rhar it does not exist, like sorne mirage. Maya is the illusion of boundaries, the crearíon of a mind that has lost the cosmic perspectíve. Ir comes from seeíng a míHion things \"out there\" and missing one thing, the invisible field that is the origin of the uníverse. Reading the great ríshis, it is no wonder thar they considered Maya a poor substirute for rhe cosmíc perspective. The Yoga Vasishtha said, \"In the infinite consciousness, in every atom of ir, universes come and go, like particles of dust in a beam of sunlight shining through a hole in the roof.\" Quantum reality leaps from Vasishtha's pages, because he found the perspective which showed him, \"In every atom, there are worlds within worlds.\" Demolishing one's own boundaries does not make the relative world vanish; it adds another dimension of reality to it-reality becomes unbounded. When the walls are down, the world can expando And that, according to the rishis, makes all the difference between a world that could be a heaven and one that becomes a helL The mechanism behind phobias can be used in exactly the opposite way, ro take down a wall rather than build one. We could just as easily, and far more happily, talk about people who overcome fears that are sup­ po sed ro be normal.

The more we dwell on this, the more remarkable the implications are. The smell of camphor did not do anything to cause the change in immune cells: the mice could have smelled roses or listened ro a Mozart quartet. What actually happened inside them was the crearÍon of an impulse of intelligence, a totally fluid entity that coordinates a piece of the nonmateríal world wíth a píece of the material world. The andent rishis undersrood this very well. A verse from the Veda says, \"What you see, you become.\" In other words, just the experience of perceiving the world makes you what you are. This is a quite literal statement. Children growing up in homes where there is inadequate love can show a variety of symproms-they may be unhappy, neurotic, schizophrenic, sickly, 'angry, or any number of other responses. But one of the strangest is a condition called psychosocial dwarfism. Such children do not grow up; they induce in themselves a deficiency of growth hormone from the pituitary, and as a result, they remain small and undeveloped in their physiques. Ignoring the biological dock, the onset of puberty can be delayed; so can the acquisition of mental skills associated with older children, which is not directly controlled by the pituitary. It is not a dysfunction of the pituitary that 1S ae fault, for when these children are placed in loving surroundings, their condition can spontaneously reverse, and they quickly catch up with their peers in size. Growing up is a buile-in, genetically programmed outcome of being born-yet these children defy it simply because they feel unloved. Even if a doctor injects them with growth hormone, many refuse to grow. A study with adult male victims of heart attacks showed that the most significant factor in their recovery-meaning whether they lived or died -was not anything to do with diet, exercise, smoking, or a will to live. The men who lived felt that their wives loved them, while those who felt unloved tended not ro sutvive; no other correlation the researchers could find was as strong. Por years I have been haunted by the memory of one of my first 208"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"\"WHAT YOU SEE, YOU BECOME\" patíents, an Jndían víHager named Laxman Govindass. J was still a medi­ cal student in New Delhi, confined tO the drudgery of working up physicals on the patients whom the hospital staff doctors were too busy to see. The hospital in question was a teaching hospital attached to my school, the AH-India Medical Institute, and the academic doctors there had scant interest in a broken-down alcoholic like Laxman Govindass. was a peasant farmer whose drinking had gotren out of hand ro the point where his family deserred him. One son had bundled him off ro the door of our hospital and lefr him there with the words, \"Here's where you will probably die.\" Like all villagers consigned to us, Mr. Govindass was very apprehensive and totally out of his elemento The interos rook good enough care of his cirrhosis of the liver, but without spending any time ro become acquainted with him personally. 1 got ro know him only because as a student 1 had most of the day free; 1 made a habit of following the orderly who brought around the evening curry so that 1 could chat with the patients. 1 struck up a rapport with Mr. Govindass, sitting by his bed and exchanging an occasional word; mostly we just looked out the window rogether. Day by day he wasted away a little more, and nobody gave him longer than a week or two at most, including me. In a short while it was time for me to rotate from the city to a village dispensary sixty miles away, so 1 carne in to wish him good-bye. To keep up a good front, 1 told him that 1 would be back to see him in thirty days. In reply, he looked at me very seriously and said, \"Now that you are leaving,I have nothing more ro live for-I will die.\" Without thinking, 1 blutted, \"Don't be silly. You can't die until 1 come back to see you again.\" Since Mr. Govindass was extremely emaciated-he weighed less than eighty pounds-his doctors were surprised that he was even alive. 1 left for my posting in the country and in a Httle while had no more thoughts about him. A month later, on my return to New Delhi, 1 was walking down the hospital corridor and saw the name Laxman Govindass on one of the doors. 1 rushed in, feeling strangely apprehen­ sive, and there he was, curled on his bed outside the sheet s in a fetal 209"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"QUANTUM HEALING posmon. was nothing of him but skin and bones, but when I gendy touched him, h~ turned his huge eyes toward me. \"You have come back,\" he Ijluttered. \"You said I could not die without you again-now 1 see you.\"· Then he closed his eyes and died. 1 recounted this incident, one of the most important in my life, once before; at that time, r felt twO emotions-a lingering guílt that 1 had sentenced this man to so much protracted suffering and a deep respect for the mind-body connectÍon that had him alive. Now I realize that 1 was seeing the truth of unboundedness, the ability of our impulses of intelligence to do what they want, despite all the rules that might have to be broken. The impulse that 1 shared with Laxman Govindass was love. Though it arose in a wasted body, his love had the power that love always has-it new life. It pierced through the Maya of his body and defied death to claim him. On the delicacy of thar impulse, a gostamer thread as strong as steel, a new medicine could be founded. I The possibility that each person is an infinire beíng ís becoming more real now. Gifted with total flexibility in our nervous systems, we all have the choice to buíld boundaríes or tear them down. Every person is con­ tinual1y manufacturing an infinite array of thoughts, memories, desires, objects, and so on. These impulses, rippling through the ocean of con­ sciousness, become your reality. If you knew how to control the creatíon of impulses of intelligence, you would able not only to grow new dendrites bur anything else. \"\\\"\\7hat you see, you become\" is a truth that shapes the whole physiol­ ogy, including the braín. This was brought home by an ingenious exper­ iment devised by psychologists Joseph Hube! and David Weise!, agaín involving newborn kittens. Three batches of kittens were placed in care­ ful1y controlled environments as they were opening their eyes. The first was a white box painted with horizontal black stripes; the second was a white box painted with vertical black sttipes; the third box was simply left white. After being exposed to these conditions during the critical few days 210"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"\"WHAT YOU SEE, YOU BECOME\" when sight develops, the kittens' brains conformed ro them for life. The animals raised in a world with horizontal stripes could not correctly see anythíng vertical-they would run into chair legs, whose verticality had litrle or no reality for them. The batch from the vertical-stripe box had exactly the opposite problem, being unable to perceive horizontal lines. The kittens from all-white surroundings had a larger disorientation and could not relate ro any objects correctly. These animals beca me what they saw, because the neurons responsible for sight were now rigidly programmed. In the case of humans, too, the brain sacrifices sorne of its unbounded awareness every time it perceives the world through boundaries. Without the ability to transcend, this parríal blindness is inescapable. For each of the senses, not just sight, impressions are constantly being laid down on our neurons. Although we customarily call the heavier impressions \"stress,\" in fact all impres­ sions create sorne limitation. To illustrate: researchers at M.I.T. in the early 1980s were probing ioto how human hearing works. Hearing appears ro be passive, but actually every person listens ro the world quite selectively and puts his own interpretaríon on the raw data that come ioto his ears. (A trained musician hears pitch and harmony, for instance, where someone w~o is rone-deaf hears noise.) One experiment involved having people listen to short, simple rhythms (1-2-3 and 1-2-3 and 1-2-3), then training them to hear the rhythm in a differenr way (1, 3-and-1, 2, 3-and-1, 2). After they started ro hear the rhythms differently, the subjects reported that the sounds seemed livelier and fresher. Clearly, the experíment had taught people ro slightly alter their invisible boundaries. However, the really interesting result was that when they went home, these people found that colors looked brighter, music sounded happier, the taste of food was suddenly more delicious, and everyone around them appeared lovable. Just the slightest opening of awareness caused a reality shift. Medita­ tíon, because it opens more channels of awareness and opens them ro a deeper level, causes a bigger shifi:. The change does not depart far from 211"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"QUANTUM HEALII\\G the normal way we use our awareness. Building boundaries wiU sti11 be a fact of tife. The twist the rishis gave was to this activity with freedom, raising it to a level that transcends the petty thoughts and desires of the isolated ego. Ordinarily, the ego has no choice but to spend Efe desperately erecting one boundary after another. It does this for the same reason as medieval cides erected walls-for protection. The ego frnds the world a dangerous, hostile place, because everything that exists is separate from \"1.\" This 1S the cond1tion known as dualíty, and it 1S a great source of fear-the Veda calls it the only source of fear. As we Iook \"out there,\" we see every kind of potential threat, all the trauma and pain that life can inflict. The ego's 10gicaI defense 1S to wall itself in with the friendIier things-family, pleasures, happy memories, familiar pIaces and activities. The rishis did not propose tearing down these defensive boundaries, aIthough many people believe that was their intendon. In both East and West, the idea that Indian sages condemned the \"illusion of life\" has taken root, and yet, Vedic reaEty was not based on such an absurdity. DuaIity does exist, and because of its existence the recognition of a higher unity is made meaningful. Two polar opposites fuse into a whole principIe puts the siIent and active frelds of life into proper per­ specdve.

The ancient texts expIain this as Purnarn adah, purnam idam-\"This 1S full, that 1S full.\" The highest goal of existence, then, is to achieve \"two hundred per­ cent of tife.\" The human nervous system can accompIish this because it is flexible enough to appreciate both the diversity of life, which is infr­ nite but full of boundaries, and the unifred state, whích is equally infr­ nite, but completely unbounded. Just from a logical standpoint, no other possibility could existo No one was given a cosmic computer and told, \"Remember, you can use only half of it.\" No one gave us any limitations on the parterns of intelligence we can make, change, bIend, expand, and inhabit.

Ir says rhat we can bypass the limíted, bounded choices that we are used ro making and go directly ro the solution of any problem. The basis for this assertion is thar nature has already structured the solution in our consciousness. The problems are in the field of diversity, while the solutions are in the field of uníty. Going straight ro the field of unity automatically hits upon the solution, which the mind-body system then carríes out-that was the rishis' shortcut. Robert Keíth Wallace's studies on aging are an excellent example of how the shortcut works. The current scientific wisdom holds that aging is a complicated, poorly understood area. Geronrology, the study of old age, has become a specíalization only since the 1950s, when the map­ ping of DNA made it possible ro consider that there might be special genes for aging (none have appeared so far, although certain aging mech­ anisms are known to be genetically coded in lower animals). Now that gerontology is in high gear, it is swamped with conflicting theories and huge data banks amassed from research projecrs rhat will decades ro finish. This íntensive research effort has not made people age more slowly. The major advance in the field has been ro document thar healthy people do not have ro deteriorare automatically as they grow older, a point that has been made for centuries without data banks. Gerontology has had some valuable medical applications, such as the recognition that many senile symproms once thought permanent are reversible. They are not signs of braín decay but the by-product of poor nutrition, isolation, dehydration, and other factors in the person's environment. Otherwise, gerontology proceeds bit by bit, forging tiny links in theories that are conjectural to begin wíth. As for getting the American people ro eat better, sensibly, and practice disease prevention, the whole field is in agreement with the rest of medicine. Wallace's research, however, proceeded on the assumption that people do not age by bits and pieces but as whole human beings. Therefore, aging contains a large element of choice. If old people can retaín cheir 213"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"QUANTUM HEALING mental faculties by continually using them, then the practice of medita­ ríon, which opens the awareness completely, should do even more. Wal­ lace's basic finding, as mentioned earlier, was that long-term meditators did decrease their biological age by five to twelve years. (High levels of a líttle-undersrood hormone called DHEA [dehydroepiandrosterone} were also found; it has been speculated that DHEA somehow helps to retard agíng and perhaps inhibit the onset and growth of cancer.) This research suggests that aging is controlled by consciousness. Op­ erating at the usual·level of superficial, confused thinking, we speed up the aging process in our cells, bur as we move to the silent region of the transcendent, mental activity srops, and apparently cell activity follows accordingly. If this is rrue, then aging can be programmed from differ­ ent levels of awareness. If we program ourselves ro deteriorate, which was the rule in earlier generations, then that becomes the reality. Pro­ gramming of this kind is not a matter of simply thinking or believing. Positive attitudes, mental alertness, the will ro survive, and other psy­ chological traits can ease old age; they certainly help crack rhe rigid social condítioning that old people are often trapped by. But actually changing the aging process itself is another, far deeper matter. Officially, gerontology recognizes no means tO reverse or retard the aging process-a rather stringent position, when you consider that aging has not even been adequately defined. The rishis would counter by say­ ing that science has failed to reach the level of awareness where aging can be defeated. In 1980, a young Harvard psychologist, Charles Alexan­ der, went into three old-age homes outside Bosron and taught about sixty residents, all at least 80 years old, sorne mind-body techniques. Three were used: a mainstream relaxation technique (rhe kind used in typical stress-management programs), Transcendental Meditation, and a ser of creative word games performed every day to keep the mind sharp. Each person learned only one technique, and rhe groúps were allowed to use them without supervision. When the three groups were tested on follow-up, the meditators scored highest on measures of improved learn­ ing abilíty, low blood pressure, and mental health-all of which should 214 ~~~----~------- ~ ~-_ .. _-- ------ ---_ ......... ~ "},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"\"WHAT YOU YOU BECOME\" decline with age. The people also reported thar they felt happier and not as old as before. But the real1y striking resule did not come ro light until three years later. When Alexander returned to the old-age homes, about one-third of the residents had died since he left, including 24 percent of the participants who had not leB;!hed meditation. Aw.ong the meditative group, however, the death tate wa,s zero. ¡ These people had now lived ro a¡:ü,average age of~4, one of the rarest and loveliest instances where science has p,erforme9 an expenment that immediately conferred the gift of life. Although lirriited in scope, this is one of the most hopeful results in the whole aging field and a vicrory for the rishis' shortcut. It says that expanding your awareness is enough ro extend your life. What will be the life span of meditarors who began in \" their twenties instead of their eighties? Time will tel!. The assumption that smothers life is ro feel that you are a prisoner in your body. The human body seems to work in a mechanical fashion. One of the best srudied of its mechanisms is the homeostatic feedback loop, a self-regulating device like that used in thermostats.· A thermostat is given a set point, such as 70 degrees F., which is like the set point of body temperature. The appararus is, sensitive ro a temperature 1 extending a few degrees too high or loo low. By turning the heat or air conditioning on or off, it maintainí' a nearly even temperature. The know-how in a thermostat is quite limited; tou could caH it an intelli­ gent switch, but it has only one i~ea on its: mind, whereas the body's feedback loops manage to balance bot just b6dy temperatute but blood pressu~e, .water levels'i~ the cells, flucose metabolis~, oxygen and car­ bon dlOxIde concentratlOns, and 0111 and on,: not leavlOg out the thou­ sands of separate chemicals ptoduced with exquisite precision i everywhere in th~ physiology. ¡ Since the the'rmostat always retu~ns ro its norm and so does the body, isn't this a kind of hard-wiring tijat cannot be denied, that in lS necessary to Out existence? The gre~test of nineteenth-century physiolo­ gists, Claude Bernard, made the fatilous statement, \"Free life is the fixity 2;15"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"QUANTUM HEALING of our interior milieu\"-in other words, the ability of our thermostats to hold their position makes us free. Brilliant as this insight was, a drastíe mistake has crept in with it. When a thermostat senses that the room is 65 degrees or 75 instead of 70, those variations are mistakes; only 70 degrees is right. In us, on the other hand, many settings can be right; normal is just the point we return to most of the time. If you ran a marathon withour your blood pressure, heart rate, glucose metabolism, and sweat production rising drastically aboye \"normal,\" you would col­ lapse. \"Normal\" is just the zone we like to live in. It is not a rule but a preference. The Tarahumara Indians, perhaps because they descend from ancient runners who carried messages across the Andes to the Incan empire, have adjusted to a \"normal\" that is different from ours, more suited to their way of life. In defiance of a meager diet, what they wanted to do-to run fifty miles a day-was more important than mere bodily norms. Their bodies adapted to intelligence, no questions asked, and not the other way around. Thanks to the habit of following one style of living, it may be difficult to adapt instantly when the mind desires a change-obese people should not jump from their armchairs to join marathons-but the power of adaptation can never be totalIy sacrificed. For all out internal \"hard-wiring\" and thousands of homeostatic mecha­ nisms, we can change Out skills, forget them, acquire new ones, and so on. That is the ultimate glory of being a human being, and it cannot be attained wi thout total freedom. The West clearly has mixed feelings about the whole idea of higher consciousness, compounded of longing, bafflement, and distaste. 1 travel at least two days a week, year round, talking about Ayurveda to many kinds of audiences, both medical and nonmedical, and very quickly 1 learned how sensitive a chord I was striking. A CBC interviewer in Canada introduced himself to me by demanding, \"Can you give me five reasons why you are not a fraud?\" A more congenial interviewer in Los Angeles leaned toward me with mystical anticipation and said, \"Tell me, 216"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"\"WHAT YOU SEE, YOU BECOME\" Doctor, have you been here-before?\" 1 was so startled 1 blurted, \"We're aH here aH the time.\" Since the 1960s, the proliferaríon of casual knowledge abollt the East has been a blessing and a curse, for although many people have picked up a few catch phrases like nirvana, Atman, and dharma, and almost everyone can let the word kamza pass by in conversation without blink­ íng an eye, the actual sense of these words has been garbled. 1 have tried to show that Vedic knowledge is systematic and sound; that it is as far­ reaching as our most advanced science; and that many of the things we most desíre for ourselves, such as freedom from disease and an unimpaired old age, can be approached through this great body of un­ derstanding about human exístence. But 1 would betray the rishis' knowledge if 1 díd not present its final expansion, which has no clearly defined precedent in the West-or at best is confined to religious doctrine. The rishis were after a state of total awareness. For them, this was not philosophy or religion but a natural form of human awareness. The fourth state, it turns out, is not an end point but a doorway. And what is on the other side? The only complete answer would have to come from the thousands and thousands of pages of Vedic texts, which function as the encyclopedia of experiences the rishis recorded. The simplest answer is to say that what each rishi en­ countered was the Self. An extremely accurate depiction of meeting the Self was given by a meditator from Connecticut: One of rhe most regular experíences ín my meditaríon is of expanded awareness, of no longer being conflned to rhe inside of my head, but being as inf1nite or more inf1nire rhan rhe universe.

Everyone will have to respond to this in his own terrns. I hope that we have laid enough sol id groundwork so that the account can appear in its tme light, not as a self-delusion but as an actual encounter with the silent field of intelligence. Earlier, we noted that the body in its real nature is non-change mixed with change. The reaSOn why that is so is that all of nature exhibits these two paradoxical yet complementary states. As awareness expands, the huge scope of change and the equally huge scope of non-change dawn on the mind. An ancient Chinese poem by Hsu Hsu says: The urst wave 1S receding The second wave promptly arrives So many layers of time So many lives. Can we grant this beautiful openness of perception, at once serene and all-encompassing, to an ordinary person from Connecticut? I think we have to, for the same biochemistry that sustains such an experience is available ro anyone, regardless of time. Our DNA has remembered all the things that have ever happened to human beings. It would be ridicu­ lous to suppose that only Chinese or lndian DNA can trigger higher states of consciousness; it would be impoverished to claim that they are not real.

As 1 watched, the clouds lifted all at once. 1 was absolutely in awe. What 1 had taken for mountains were only foothills! Beyond them, like ancient gods, rose the true Himalayas, unbelievably mighty and majestic. We could hardly speak, so much power and beauty was concentrated in that breathtaking scene. The sense of having a small, isolated self disap­ peared, and in its place was the delicious sensation of flowing out into everything 1 beheld. 1 felt a sense of complete fullness contained in my own silence. Fittingly, the tallest peak befo re us was Annapurna, whose name means \"fullness of life.\" Standing there on the lake, 1 saw direcdy into the reality where time really is timeless. The same power that reared these mountains was flow­ ing through me. If 1 wanted to find the source of time and space, 1 only needed to place my fingers over my heart.

By comparison, their ordi­ nary view was fiat and distorted; they had been accepting a dingy image for the real thing. To experience bliss every hour of the day would be a sign of complete enlightenment, but even a brief encounter is significant -it permits you to actually feel waves of consciousness as they well up from the field of silence, cross the gap, and are infused into every cell. This is the body's own awakening. In Ayurveda, bliss is the basis for three extremely powerful healing techniqúes. The first is meditation, which we have already discussed.

The second healing technique is called primordial sound. To explain how such healing works, let me rake an example from hypnosis. One of the mosr surprising findings of hypnosis research is that subjects can make their hands warm or cold, raise rashes on their skin, and even form blisters in a marter of a few minutes afrer the hypnoric suggesrion is inrroduced.

The bliss technique and primordial sound faH into this category. Con­ sciousness is nothing but awareness. You can be aware that your hand is hot, which is passive awareness, but as rhe hypnosis research shows, you can also make your hand hot, which is active awareness, or attention. When you \"pay attention\" to something, you shift from passive to active awareness. Attention exerts far more control than people ordinarily real­ ize. That is because we are victims of passive awareness. A person in pain is aware of the pain but not rhat he can make ir increase, diminish, appear, or disappear. Yet all this is true. (People can walk on fire, for example, because they can control their level of pain; more remarkably, they can control whether their feet actually get burned-that too is under the control of attention.) In Ayurveda, each and every symptom of disease, from a minor neck pain to a full-blown cancer, 1S under the control of attention. However, 223"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"QUANTUM HEALING between us and the symptom lie barriers-the veils called Maya-that prevent us from exercising our attention in a therapeutic way. All mind­ body medicine attempts to remove these obstacles so that healing can take place. Outside Ayurveda, the word Maya is not used, but any term that amounts to the same thing is applicable. 1 have used other phrases, such as \"barriers in silence,\" \"the ghost of memory,\" and \"the mask of matter.\" In the current environment, where mind-body medicine is just proving itself and has to beware of stepping on the toes of science, techniques for breaking through Maya are still rather rudimentary. For­ tunately, nature has set up things so that mind-body approaches of all kinds will work. Laughter can defeat a fatal disease; so can drinking a glass of grape juice every day, if you believe strongly enough in it. It would be much better, however, to have a science of awareness. Ayurveda supplies just that. It would also be helpful to have a theory that supplies this science with a firm grounding in philosophy; the Vedic knowledge supplies that. When 1 teach people Ayurvedic healing tech­ niques, 1 am not inducting them into a Vedic world, or into sorne mystery. 1 am trying to let them realize that their own awareness creates, controls, and turns into their bodies. This is a fact, not just a Vedic view of things. When the body is in pain, a distorted area of awareness is crying out to the rest of awareness for help. Our natural instinct is to bring the help. The way we mobilize the platelets and clotting factors in the blood to heal a cut is nothing more than awareness bringing in help. A bruise heals because intelligence goes to work on it. 1 think that much has become abundantly clear by now. Sorne people are fortunate in being such natural creatures that when they get cancer, they do not block the innate urge to get well. No doubt there are thousands of such people in the world who have not come under scrutiny. Rather than being branded miraculous by religion or science, they stand as the mure, inglorious Miltons of the healing pro­ cess. Ayurveda extends their ability to everyone.

Today, three years later, she is stíll alive and on the sutface appears perfectly normal. Her X rays reveal that the tumor has nor shrunk, but its growth, if any, has been slight. This implies that Laura is still in considerable danger, but in her own mind, her present state is a great victory. 225"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"QUANTUM HEALING Although her eaneer is st~ll pr~~ent, ir has not followe~ what d~flors eaH the natural hlsrory of the Dr. YUJIro Ikeml,tOne of Japan's leading experts in psyehosomatic medicine, has survhed sixty-nine patíents whom he considers to have had spontaneous regres­ sions of eaneer. lt ís not neeessary for the cancer ceUs ro disappear entirely, Dr. Ikemi notes-he looks for other signs, such as that the tumor 1S growing abnormally slowly, the patient has not wasted away, and the malignancy has not spread ro other parts of the body. These signs are enough to indicate a spontaneous regression in Ikemi's view, and Laura hts them all. Laura was already meditatíng when 1 hrst saw her. In 1987 she went through two weeks of inpatient Ayurvedic treatment and was taught primordial sound and the bliss technique, both of which can be used during meditation. us say that the mínd has settled down in medita­ tion and is experiencing irself as silence.

At times they induced a throbbing feeling, heat, or even pain; most of the time, however, she wouId sit down with pain in that area and the technique would cause it ro go away.

Bliss is both objective and subjective. You can feel ir as a sensation, but it also effects measurable change-it can alter the heart rate, blood pressure, hormone secretions, or anything else for that matter. This is what allows bliss ro be useful medically. The patient is using the Ayurvedic techniques \"in his head,\" but the bliss being experienced is re-creating his body at the same time. What is happening is that the body is receiving a signal from its own blueprint, not a material blue­ print but the one that exists in consciousness. Because the blueprint is invisible, it has to find a way to cross over into material existence. To do that, nature employs bliss-it is a vibra­ tion that bridges mind and matter, allowing each bit of the body ro be paired with a bit of intelligence: ·Mind Body (ONA) \"'\" Bliss This diagram shows the mind-body connection as being like a radio broadcast: mind is sending out impulses of intelligence, DNA receives them, and bliss is the carrier signal. On paper, these three elements have ro be separated, but in reality they are completely fused. The message, the messenger, and the receiver are one. Of course, we have looked at the mind-body connection dozens of times before, but we didn't have the \"glue\" that keeps mind and body from flying in separate directions­ bliss. DNA now takes on special importance. A single neuro-peptide, or any 228"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"BODY OF BLISS other messenger molecule, carries only a tiny bit of the signal that mind is sending. Adrenaline, for example, is correlated to fear. This seems to imply that each thought activates one molecule, but that would be like saying that 101.5 on an FM radio receives only one songo In fact, the body can receive an infinite variety of signals, thanks to DNA. We are used to thinkíng of DNA as an unchanging blueprint, albeit \"the blueprint of life.\" DNA is nowhere near so static. 1 was sitting quietly two days ago when 1 had a glimpse of DNA in my mind's eye. 1 saw DNA speeded up so that one human lifetime, from the moment of inception to the moment of death, fit into the space of a few minutes. What 1 saw wasn't a chemical but a process of incredible richness and dynamism. Everything in life pours out of DNA-flesh, bones, blood, heart, and nervous system; a baby's first word and a toddler's first step; the maturing of reason in the brain's cortex; the play of emotions, thoughts, and desires that flicker like summer lightning through every celI. AH of this is DNA. To caH it a blueprint is ro take the husk and miss the fruit. Imagine yourself going to a Mercedes dealer, paying thirty thousand dollars, and having him hand over a car's blueprint instead of a caro Now imagine the blueprint actuaHy turning into the car -not onIy that, but starting itseIf, driving down the road, and replacing its own spare parts. Then the blueprint would be equal to DNA. (It would also another quite amazing talent: any part-the carburetor, the tires, even a chip of paint on the door-would have ro know how to tutn into a whole car.) Whatever it is that makes DNA so dynamic is nor visible in its material makeup; molecules themselves are passive participants in time. They can change, as oxygen and hydrogen change when they combine ro form water, but DNA actively shapes the course of time. This is su eh an important feature that 1 need to explain it at length; otherwise, the real miracle of DNA will be lost on uso In the past few years, researchers have been intrigued by one particu­ lar gene, called the per in the DNA of a fruit fly. As part of their inherited behavior, fruit sing in the evening to can their mates. 229"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"QUANTUM HEALING Normally, they repeat their call quite rhythmically, once every 60 sec­ onds. Ronald Konopka, a research professor at Clarkson University, first linked the rhythm of the fmit fiy's song ro the per (for \"periodic\") gene. He also found that the rhythm could change. When the per gene mu­ tates, it produces faster or slower intervals between calls: one fiy sings every 40 seconds, another every 80 seconds. What is so fascinating about this díscovery is that each kind of fiy times its existence tO a different length of day. The normal, 60-second fiy follows a 24-hour day; the faster, 40-second fiy a shorter day of 18 ro 20 hours; and the slower, 80-second fiy a long day of 28 ro 30 hours. The conventional interpretation is that the per establishes the in- sed s daily rhythm. A similar effect is seen in us; if confined ro a cave where he cannot see the sun and is not allowed ro look at a dock, aman wiU sleep and wake up on a regular cyde, not of hours but generally of 25 hours-this seems to be the daily, or circadian, rhythm that Out DNA has built into uSo Similarly, the fmit fiy does not care when the sun rises or sets; when its song changes, the day changes. That means that its sense of time comes from within, activated by the per gene. This is a far more stunning condusion than the conventional one. The conventional one says that DNA is controlling a rhythm inside the ceH, but 1 am saying that it controls time itself. The per is the link between time \"out there\" and DNA \"in here\"; it lite rally creates time as the fmit fiy knows it. In physics, Einstein demonstrated that there is no fixed yardstick for time in the relative world; a space traveler would think that the dock on his spaceship is ticking normally, just as it does on Earth. But if he attained a velocity near the speed of light, the dock would in be going slower than Earth-bound docks. This would not be an illusion; every biological process, índuding how fast the space traveler would also slow down. Aren't these fmit fiies the insect equivalent of Einstein's space travelers? They are experíencing time as either slow or fast, not from traveling near the speed of light but simply [rom their own internal signals. 230"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"BODY OF BLISS A fast-singing fruit fiy would have no way of knowing that it is living in \"fast time\" (assuming that it is isolated from the other kinds of fiies). lt emits the same number of calls per \"day\" as either the normal or the slow singers, without realizing that its day (18 to 20 hours) is entirely determined inside itself. But what is the per gene actually doing? Another ínvestigator, Michael Young of Rockefeller University, joined Konopka and discovered that the per gene works by coding cer­ tain proteins in the ceH that regulate rhythm. It is these proteins, com­ ing and going in cycles, that make the day seem long or short ro the fiy. Similar genes and coded proteins have also been found in mice, chickens, and human beings. This brings us remarkably close to seeing how the DNA is creating aH of reality. It i5 manlpulating the molecules into rhythms, or vibrations, that we decode ínto time. Other vibrations are decoded ínto light, sound, texrure, smells, et cetera. Sir Arthur Edding­ ton calls all of these \"fancies of the mind,\" for essentially none of our sensory input is anything but a signal transmitted ro us via DNA­ pure, abstract vibrations that we turn lnto \"real\" events in time and space. If a gene can regulate time, then it is only a step away from regulating space, too. There is nothing ro time and space, from a subjec­ tive point of view, except one's own participation in it. Like the fruit fiy, we measure an hour by the dock, and the dock is in us. Here we come to a fork in the road. Biologists realize that if the proteins in a ceH regulate the cell's rhythms, then something must regulate them. What is it? One road leads to a materialistic explanatíon. Narurally, this is the one science prefers. Some biologists believe that the cell walllets chemicals through only at a certain rate, and this rate is OUt yardstick for time, Out molecular clock. Others say that the dock i5 actually a chemical code imprinted on the DNA, which is read in se­ quence ftom the moment of conception until death. Neither explanatíon has been worked Out in satisfacrory detaíL If the rishis are right, they never will be-no an5wer exists on the level of molecules alone.

That is where we really live, and the miracle of DNA is that it can turn so many totally abstract messages into life itself. If you go walking through the woods on a warm autumn day, feeling the fallen oak leaves under your feet, smelling the ripe, dank earth, and watching the October light as it plays in the branches overhead, you are experiencing the world through your DNA. Ir imposes a definite selec­ tion on things. You are not smelling the argon and xenon gases in the air or seeing the sun's ultraviolet emissions. You can walk through leaves but not through the wood of the trees. The incredible complexity of green moss registers on your mind as a patch of fuzz; and of the pollen, spores, bacteria, viruses, and other mierobes that fill the air by che hundreds in every cubie centimeter, you register nothing. The reason for , this special focus resides in you.

As its strings vibrate, different pitches, chords, seguences of notes, and timbres are produced. you were an alíen who did not know what music is, you would find each of these things completely different from one another-the note e might be like a hydrogen arom, while E-fiat was a phoron. Only by opening the box and seeing that indeed every sound carne from one violín would you be convinced that they had a unified source. In the same way, nature's fundamental field 1S constantly vibrating and producing variations upon the same \"notes,\" but our senses are set up so that they tum this sameness into differences. We perceive iron as a solid note, hydrogen as a gaseous note, gravity as a heavy note, and so on. Only by exposing the superstrings would the underlying unity be evident. They are exposed not by opening the box but by mathematical formulas that show that all forms of matter and energy fit the super­ string model-as so far they aH do. Therefore, guantum physics now has its first good candidate for a unified field theory, justifying Einstein's faith in the order of the cosmos. Amazingly enough, the Vedic rishis also perceived that the cosmos was pervaded by strings. These strings were called sutras, from which surgeons the word suture. In Sanskrit, surra can mean a stitch (or suture), bur al so a thread or a verbal phrase.

Like notes played on the unseen violin, the fundamental leve! of the whole world, according to the Vedic rishis, is made of sounds.

Once you open your mind ro the possibility, it 1S no more surprísing that stars, galaxies, and human beings can be created from Om than from a superstring. Both are abstract. Going back ro the hidden vioEn, Kaku wrote, \"The tones created by the vibrating string, such as e or B-fiat, are not in themselves any more fundamental than any other notes. What is fundamental, however, is fact that a single concept, vibrat­ ing strings, can explain the laws of harmony\"--or in the case of universe, the laws of nature. Om can be pictured as a straight line whose pitch rises into infinity, like the most super of superstrings. It is no accident that the syllable Om sounds the English \"hum\"; when the rishis tuned in ro the sound of the universe, they actually heard it as a cosmic hum. If you were enlightened, you would be able to hear the vibration that is your own signature; for instance, you could \"hear\" your DNA as a specific frequency vibrating in your awareness. Likewise, each neuropeptide would grow our of a sound, as would every other chemical.

When a virus comes near the cell wall, ir melts through, penetraring as if without resistance; it is next ushered directly to the cell's nucleus, where the DNA obligingly shuts down normal operations and begins to manufacture the proteins for making new VHuses. A cold or Hu virus is content to let DNA build proteins for it, but a retrovirus like HIV goes one better by blending into the DNA's own chemical strands, masking itself as the host's genetic material. There it sleeps until the day, which may come years later, when the DNA is triggered to fight another disease. Then the retrovirus awakens and be­ gins to replicate ítself by the millions, using the host cell as an incubator and eventually resulting in the host cell's death. The ceH bursts open, loosing a horde of lethal viruses into the bloodstream. Every step of the cycle is so mysterious and complicated that the AIDS virus has quickly earned a reputation for being the most complex disease organism ever discovered. No drug is capable of treating it; AZT, which helps post­ pone the active phase, is riddled with major side effects, making it impossible for sorne patients to take the drug. This is not to deny Western medicine its own approach. When a life­ threatening disease arises, it is necessary ro take drastíc measures-on this point there is no disagreement. But 1 believe thar viewing disease as a distortion of intelligence might represent a move toward a deeper level of understanding, and therefore of treatment. Both cancer and AIDS seem to be cases where the proper sequence of sutras must be unraveling at the deepest level. In other words, they are failures of intelligence, like \"black holes\" where bliss gets disrorted out 239"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"QUANTUM HEALING of its normal pattern. What makes both diseases so intractable is that the dísrortion runs so deep-it is locked inside the DNA's own struc­ rure. This causes the cell's self-repair mechanism either to break down or turn against itself. In the case of cancer, DNA actually seems to want ro commit suicide by ignoring its knowledge of proper cel! division. In both diseases the distortion apparently penetrates as far as the very force fields that hold DNA together. (Cell physics is a complex field, but it is believed that a ceU senses and interacts with viruses in the first place by detecting their chemical and electromagnetic resonances; such signals are interpreted by the DNA and presumably can also fool it.) From the perspective of the sutras, or Vedic sounds, there must be a disrortion in the proper sequence of intelligence as it unfolds into the relative world. \"Hearing\" the virus in its vicinity, the DNA mistakes it for a friendly or compatible sound, like the ancient Greek sailors who heard the siren's song and were luted ro their destruction. This is a believable explanation once one realizes that DNA, which the virus is exploitíng, is itseIf a bundle of vibrations. If this explanatíon is valid, then the remedy is to reshape the im­ proper sequence of sounds, using Ayurveda's primordial sound (known as Shruti in the Sanskrit texts, from the verb that means \"ro hear\"). These sounds are basically líke pottery molds-by placing the mold back over the distorted sequence, one guides the disrupted DNA back into lineo This treatment is subtle and gentle in its effects, but sorne preliminary results have been quite dramatie. Once the sequence of sound is restored, the tremendous structural rigidity of the DNA should again protect it from furure disruptions. In the near future Ayurveda will bIossom, 1 believe, and help us ro create a new medicine, one of knowledge and compassion. At its best, current medicine already contains these ingredients-the medical sys­ tem is in trouble, but its woes are transcended by caring individuals. They will be the first to see that Ayurveda is not in conflict with their work as doctors; it can only help the process of recovery and bring healing under our control. 240"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"14 The End of the War If asked for an exact deflnitíon of quantum healing, I would say this: quantum healing is the ability of one mode of consciousness (the mínd) ro spontaneously cortect the mistakes in another mode of consciousness (the body).

In other words, the DNA has decided to stage for its own benefit a drama in which every part is played by itself.

Nothing that happens to DNA is lost; it all stays within the self­ enclosed system. Once the flu virus is defeated, the DNA record s the encouoter by producing new antibodies and specialized \"memory ceHs\" that float around in the lymph system and bloodstream for years after­ ward, adding to the immense storehouse of informatíon that DNA has been accumulating since life began. This is how DNA makes you a pI ayer on the world scene. If I look out my window, I can see a multílane highway with cars rushing by. Oecasionally a jet flies over, sending a floek of birds twit­ tering ioto the sky. Gulls circle overhead, thirty miles inland from the sea, and in the air is the distinct smell of the ocean, rieh with marine life. AH of this speetacle, including me, is the play of DNA. It has been projeeted from a molecule whose responsibility is to unfold new life without ever eompromising life as a whole. Someone once estimated that all the separate DNA of every person who has ever lived would fit comfortably in a teaspoon, and yet if the tighdy wound DNA in even a single eell nucleus of YOut body were uncoiled and the pieces laid end ro end, they would streteh out to five feet.

The Veda says that the universe's intelligence extends \"from smaller than the smallest to larger than the largest,\" and DNA is the physieal proof of it. Therefore, it must be wrong to think that conflict is the norm. In general, a state of peace exists between your DNA and the other DNA \"out there.\" For every time that you actually have to fight off a disease by getting sick, there are dozens, if not hundreds, of times when your body has warded off sickness without any overt symptom.

The war, it seems, was started by us, and it is taking its toll in a frighteningly ordinary way. All of this is what I wish I could have expressed to Chitra, the young woman with breast cancer whose story opened this book. She was forru­ nate enough to receive a cure that seemed miraculous, but as I was writing these chapters, her case became very different. The cancer ce lIs had been defeated but not their memory. Because Chitra remained ex­ tremely anxious about having her cancer recur, she and 1 agreed that conventional therapy should continue. At the same time, she promised to keep up her meditation and the bliss technique 1 had taught her. I heard nothing for a month, then she called with bad news: her docrors had detected a dozen small shadows in her CAT sean that they inter­ preted as brain cancer. In a state of extreme fear, she began an intensive course of radiation, this time accompanied by experimental chemother­ apy. Weakened by the earlier bout with breast cancer, Chitra endured severe side effects, including depression. She sropped meditating and no longer rerurned for Ayurvedic treatment. Her platelet count dropped severely-platelets are blood cells critical in the clotting process-which meant that it was too dangerous to continue the chemotherapy. Chitra's doctors determined that her bone marrow was producing antibodies that attacked her own platelets (probably in reactíon to the many transfusions she had received). They considered abone marrow transplant, but tríed first ro exchange the blood plasma. During the procedure, she had a seizure and soon developed severe anemia and various infections. At this point Chitra's case was turning into a mounting disaster. She refused a blood transfusion, being horrified at the thought of getting 247"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"QUANTUM HEALING AIDS. Because of her agitation, she had to be placed on an intravenous drip of morphine and Valium. Her awareness became duller and duller, and she slipped into a coma, probably induced by shock, followed by the onset of pneumonia. The doctors informed her husband that she would probably not recover, and a day later, without regaining consciousness, Chitra died. She was the victim not of her cancer but of her treatment, and 1 cannot help but think death from cancer would perhaps have been more humane. The passing of this beautifully innocent and devoted young woman came as a great blow. Although 1 had no consolation to offer, 1 immedi­ ately called Raman, her husband, who was completely shattered. For months we had both watched Chitra pass into the light of life and back into the shadow of death, sharing extremes of joy and despalr. Sincere efforts had been made ro save her, yet I cannot expel the bitter taste that comes from knowing, as all doctors know, the barbarity of our current approach to cancer. Every day, a physician in practice sees patients who have undergone some devastating cancer treatment that has been declared a success be­ cause the cancer cells are now gone, disregarding the weakening of the entire body, the looming danger of recurrent cancer caused by the treat­ ment itself, and the state of lasting fear and depression that so often comes with the cure. To live in constant fear, even without cancer in your body, is not a good state of health.

To say that a patient's awareness is responsible for his cancer is very troublesome to many people-and so ir should be. Ayurveda as 1 view it does nor agree that there is a so-called cancer personaliry, nor does it accept that superficial emotions, styles of behavior, and attitudes cause cancer. Sorne researchers are convinced thar patients who react with helplessness and depression ro their cancer are more líkely to die from the disease rhan those patients who have a strong component in their personalities called \"the will ro Uve.\" This seems unarguable, but is it any help?

Recently 1 was on aplane and hap­ pened to sit beside a very lively woman in her sixries.

Her family had lived in Maine for genera­ 249"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"QUANTUM HEALING tions and had become quite prosperous. Since my head was full of aH the issues involved in cancer treatment, we began to talk about them. The old lady lifted her chino \"1 don't believe any of these doctors know what they're talking about,\" she declared. \"My mother was diag­ nosed with breast cancer in 1947. She went and had the lump removed and then came home to look after her fout children. My father begged her to return to Boston for a mastectomy, but she said she was too busy for it, and she was too busy to be sick, too. She went on perfectly normally like that. After a while my father won out, and she did go back for the mastectomy, but there wasn't any radiation or chemotherapy back then.\" \"What happened to her?\" 1 asked. \"Nothing happened,\" the woman answered. \"She lived twelve more years, until she was over seventy, when she contracted pneumonia. The whole family gathered around her bed, she told us goodbye, and three days Iater she died.\" Listening to this story, 1 suddenly saw, with a combination of wonder and sadness, what it was about-the paradox of being normal. It is absolutely normal to be too busy to be sick, for that is exactly the kind of awareness that the immune system thrives on.

It knows why a mother who has lost a child can die of grief, because the immune system has died of grief first. It knows every moment a cancer patient spends in the light of life or the shadow of death, because it turns those moments into the body's physical reality. Cancer, or any other disease, is nothing more than the sequence of fleetíng moments, each with its own emotions, its own mind-body chemistry. In other words, the diseased ceUs are but one ingredient out of countless others; the others are just more intangible.

A cancer patient has a whole life behind him, populated by thoughts, actions, and emotions that no other person shares exactly.

It does not matter if one is caught in the throes of eicher despair or huge self-confidence. Either one could be a phantom. Ayurveda therefore pays much less attention to surface emotions than does current mind-body medicine.

The fo11owing case study is the most complete success to date of treating cancer with these techniques. The parient is a woman in her late thirries named Eleanor.

Chemotherapy was causing multíple side 1 didn't rea11y mean ro quit chemo, but 1 had consistently bad blood counts, and that meant that the chemo temporarily had to stop. 1 immediately started feeling better and realized that 1 wanted no more chemo, even at the risk of dying. In December 1 visited Lancaster agaín. My time there was wonderful; some special herbs had come in for me, and 1 was gíven a primordial sound techníque tú use at home. At the end of December, another bone scan showed no change. This confirmed my belief thar chemo was super­ ficial. 1 continued my techniques, and when I returned in March, rhree months larer, rhe bone scan showed thar a11 but one tiny pocket was gone. The radiologist smiled and said he didn'r know how this could have happened without chemo. He hugged me, and when I lefr, he said, \"This wiU make history.\" My family doctor caBed the radiologist for a fu11 interpretation of the scans; he got off the phone and told me that I was almost completely recovered. As 1 got the news, 1 couldn't stop the tears from wellíng up. I won­ dered how I could have ever doubted this result. Touched by lave and nature's perfecrion, 1 had one quiet, soft desire, ro go sit again against the earrh, surrounded by peace in a celebraríon of spríng fiowers, and to enjoy aU rhar has happened and aH thar I amo In closing, I have ro add rhar 1 am realisríc; I understand rhe rypícal Wesrern approach to this evento 1 also know rhat there are great possibili­ ríes here. AH rhe rrurhs of my experience somehow add up ro one trurh, but when 1 rhink I've grasped ir, ir slips away. Ir leaves me feeling humble and rather silly for rrying ro rake apart rhe wholeness. But 1 am very, very peaceful and comfortable, having been assured again and agaín rhar rhe wholeness i5 perfection. 255"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"QUANTUM REALING Eleanor has come a very long way. Last year she was 1n the worst category for surviving her disease; now many authorities like Dr. Ikemi would consider her case a spontaneous regression. Rer general health is good; there is no sign of the body wasting away. Eight months after undergoing the last chemotherapy, her bone cancer has dwindled until there is only one small shadow on her X rays, and this has not definítely proven ro be cancerous. Rer blood chemísrry, whích became abnormal as the result of active disease, has now returned to the normal range-rhis is much stronger proof than the X rays that Eleanor is getting well. 1 have no fear for her now, even if she had ro begin her batde again. Eleanor is beyond battles-she radiares the peacefulness she writes about, and spending time with her makes me happy and secure, all the more because 1 understand how rare her is. Prom the despair of disease she has discovered joyo Ar the moment when the memory of health returned, it brought her enough power to lasr a liferime. 256 "},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"Bibliography Rather than providing an extensive bibliography, 1 felt that readers would appreciate a short list of highly readable books on the major subjects 1 refer to in this book: physics, mind-body medicine, and Veda. 1 enthusiastícally recommend the following eleven books, all of which entered into my own education on these fascinating subjects.
