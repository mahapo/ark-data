Highly recommended!”—DR. RUDOLPH E. TANZI, Professor of Neurology, Harvard Medical School; andbestselling coauthor of The Healing Self, Super Brain, and Super Genes“Metahuman is a brilliant vision of human potential and how we can move beyondthe limitations, concepts, and stories created by the mind. If we wake up anddrop our usual habits of considering ourselves as finite, localized beings, thepotential exists in each one of us to be one with our very true nature, orquoting Huxley, to be one with the Mind at Large.”—DR. MENAS C. KAFATOS, New York Times bestselling author and Fletcher JonesEndowed Professor of Computational Physics, Chapman University“Deepak Chopra’s wonderful book Metahuman points the way for all of us torealize our full potential by showing us how to shed the constraints that holdus back from a life filled with love and self-worth. I applaud how he roots hisrecommendations in the latest research. As always, Dr. Chopra has written a bookfilled with insight, an indispensable aid for anyone striving to have a happyand fulfilled existence.”—LEONARD MLODINOW, bestselling author of Elastic: Unlocking Your Brain’s Abilityto Embrace Change“This book distills decades of personal practice and breadth of study, and boilsit all down to this: we are more than we think, more even than the universeitself, because the universe is only one expression of the fundamental,grounding, metahuman source that emanates, nurtures, and transcends us all. Thebook reads as though an old, wise friend, away traveling for years, collectingadventures and stories, comes home.”—NEIL THEISE, M.D., Professor of Pathology, New York University School ofMedicine“Metahuman is a powerful wake-up call! Brilliantly merging scientific andholistic insights, Deepak Chopra allows us to go beyond illusory mentalconstructs to witness reality without limits. Only then can we reach our fullpotential!”—DR. LARS BUTTLER, cofounder and CEO of the Artificial Intelligence Foundation“Deepak Chopra reveals a fresh way of approaching special states ofconsciousness and gives us new insights into ancient ideas in the contemplativetraditions. Highly recommended.”—BERNARD J. BAARS, PH.D., former Senior Fellow in Theoretical Neurobiology, theNeurosciences Institute, San Diego, California“In Metahuman, Deepak Chopra exposes us to a new and exciting reality, where weare all infinitely free to create the lives we yearn for. There is no betterguide to lead us to this phenomenal way of being.”—BRUCE VAUGHN, CEO, Dreamscape Immersive; and former Chief Creative Executive atWalt Disney Imagineering“For over thirty years, Deepak Chopra has been educating us on the extraordinarypotential of the human being, focusing initially on our capacity for exceptionalphysical and mental health, and then for spiritual wellbeing. Metahuman takes usbeyond health and wellbeing—and all such concepts of the mind—to a life based onour very own nature and that of the universe: existence itself.”—PAUL J. MILLS, PH.D., Professor and Chief, Family Medicine and Public Health;Director, Center of Excellence for Research and Training in Integrative Health,University of California, San Diego“Reading Metahuman is not just about waking up, it is to wake up. It is the GPSfor realizing your full potential. You need it, I need it, and we all need it ifwe are to live on this planet without destroying it and ourselves. The key is inus—it is us. And Deepak Chopra tells us how to reach it.”—ERVIN LASZLO, author of Science and the Akashic Field and Reconnecting to theSource“Deepak Chopra and I have had our differences on a few scientific issues, butthe one thing that I’ve always admired about him is how he applies the methodsand findings of science to social progress, especially to help people improvetheir lives. We all want to lead happy and meaningful lives, but how? Metahumanis Deepak’s answer to this deepest of all personal questions. I learnedsomething new in every chapter toward this important end. You will beenlightened by the research and wisdom he brings together.”—MICHAEL SHERMER, publisher of Skeptic magazine; Presidential Fellow, ChapmanUniversity; and author of Heavens on Earth“In public health, we look for ways to make the healthy choice the easy choice.Metahuman does this by mapping a direct path to a state of focused awareness andto self-regulation mechanisms, based on growing evidence from mindfulnessresearch at Brown. This has the power to help those suffering from stress lowertheir blood pressure as well as reduce their risk for anxiety, depression—evenloneliness.”—BESS H. MARCUS, PH.D., Dean, Brown University School of Public Health“Drawing upon examples ranging from medical science to parable, Deepak Chopraillustrates how, like virtual reality technologies, the human mind paints alayer of imagination atop of the physical world.”—D. FOX HARRELL, PH.D., Professor, Digital Media and Artificial Intelligence;and Director, MIT Center for Advanced Virtuality, Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology“Reflecting on neuroscience, physics, cosmology, and anthropology—everythingfrom the molecular-level sensitivity of our senses to an octopus’semotions—Deepak Chopra explains how the world of our experience is an innerconstruct and not the thing in itself. In so doing, he offers a path throughmodern life, guiding us to put suffering in perspective and perhaps gain somecontrol over it.”—GEORGE MUSSER, author of Spooky Action at a Distance and The Complete Idiot’sGuide to String Theory“It takes courage to bridge the gap between hard-core ‘western’ science andeastern esoteric quasi-mystical traditions. There is no one better equipped toconstruct such a bridge than the erudite Deepak Chopra, who transmits the‘wisdom of the east’ to his audience. The result is this highly readable bookthat will stimulate readers’ curiosity about human existence and the nature ofreality.”—V. S. RAMACHANDRAN, Professor of Neuroscience, University of California, SanDiego“This book contains the quintessence of Deepak Chopra’s teachings. Everythingcomes forth from a conscious source; our own consciousness can link us back toit, if only we cease to separate ourselves from it. Chopra’s argument is fluent,scientifically well-informed, and persuasive, as well as eminently practical,with detailed instructions. How refreshing!”—RUPERT SHELDRAKE, PH.D., biologist and author of Ways to Go Beyond and Why TheyWork“Metahuman is a reflective deconstruction of the everyday experience of reality,away from the physical and toward the mental and metaphysical. Here DeepakChopra aptly explores the evolution of consciousness and charts a path forhumans to become liberated and limitless.”—MICHELLE A. WILLIAMS, SC.D., Dean of Faculty, Harvard T. H. Chan School ofPublic Health“In Metahuman, Deepak Chopra gives us a beatifically written understanding ofhis views on consciousness, the universe, the body, and the mind. This book is atremendous resource—not only for providing a direct path to attain true realitybut, importantly, for enabling a healthier, more wholesome life.”—RALPH SNYDERMAN, M.D., Chancellor Emeritus, Duke University; and Director, DukeCenter for Personalized Health Care“This book is a manual for living as nature intended us to, and it can’t be readsoon enough. Deepak Chopra’s clarity and gentleness, and his ability to reachpeople—despite the maelstrom of nonsense and confusion we find ourselvesimmersed in today—probably make him one of the most important people alive.”—BERNARDO KASTRUP, PH.D., author of The Idea of the World“Deepak Chopra’s prose is a work of art, an inspired vision of the life of themind and what it means to be human and beyond. Science will continue to explorethe true origins of consciousness, but until we have definitive answers, thisbook provides practical tools for increasing human well-being. Evenreductionists like myself will find much to enjoy in Deepak’s latestcontribution to the philosophy of mind.”—HEATHER BERLIN, PH.D., M.P.H., Assistant Clinical Professor, Department ofPsychiatry, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai“Integrating recent discoveries in neuroscience, endocrinology, and psychology,Deepak Chopra demonstrates in concrete terms how reductionistic andphysicalistic constraints on human nature are simply incorrect and seriouslylimit those who hold them. This book is a page-turner.”—ALLAN LESLIE COMBS, PH.D., Professor of Consciousness Studies, CaliforniaInstitute of Integral Studies“Deepak Chopra’s Metahuman is a deep dive into educating or familiarizing itsreaders with a fundamental understanding of self, consciousness, enlightenment,and metareality, in the same way Stephen Hawkins’s A Brief History of Timeattempted to teach the layman about the mysteries of the origins of the physicalquantum universe. A must-read.”—DR. KENNETH P. GREEN, D.M.D., B.S., Commander, US Navy (retired); Senior VicePresident, Brain Mapping Foundation; Vice President, Strategic Initiatives forGovernment and Nonprofit Partnerships; and Member of the Board of Directors,Society for Brain Mapping and Therapeutics“In Metahuman, Deepak Chopra provides us with a step-by-step guide for how wecan once again reimagine the reality of the world we live in, a reality notbound by the beliefs and understandings we have about the material and physicalworld, but by the boundlessness of our purpose and energy.”—ROBERT LOCASCIO, founder and CEO, LivePerson“What sets Deepak Chopra’s new book apart and makes it particularly valuable andimportant is that it takes modern life and secular culture as its point ofdeparture, rather than being situated in the context of the spiritual wisdomtradition of some ancient and distant culture. Metahuman does not shy away fromwhat those approaches offer but, importantly, is also not bound by theirperspectives and approaches. This book, Dr. Chopra’s gentle and insightfulguidance, is a great blessing for its readers.”—EDWIN L. TURNER, Professor, Department of Astrophysical Sciences, PrincetonUniversity“This book is another masterpiece from the renowned endocrinologist DeepakChopra. It is an invitation to self-discovery, self-awareness, andself-improvement. A must-read for those who seek to be better humans, live muchmore fulfilling lives, and impact others.”—BABAK KATEB, M.D., Chairman of the Board and CEO, Society for Brain Mapping andTherapeutics"},{"pageContent":"Book Title, Metahuman, Subtitle, Unleashing Your Infinite Potential, Author,Deepak Chopra, MD, Imprint, Harmony [../images/9781524762988_title_page.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"Copyright © 2019 by Deepak ChopraAll rights reserved.Published in the United States by Harmony Books, an imprint of Random House, adivision of Penguin Random House LLC, New York.harmonybooks.com [http://harmonybooks.com]Harmony Books is a registered trademark, and the Circle colophon is a trademarkof Penguin Random House LLC.Library of Congress Cataloging-in-Publication DataNames: Chopra, Deepak, author.Title: Metahuman: unleashing your infinite potential / by Deepak Chopra.Description: New York: Harmony, [2019] | Includes bibliographical references andindex. |Identifiers: LCCN 2019004165 (print) | LCCN 2019006154 (ebook) |ISBN 9781524762988 (e-book) | ISBN 9780307338334 (hardcover: alk. paper)Subjects: LCSH: Mind and body. | Spiritual life. | Self-realization.Classification: LCC BF161 (ebook) | LCC BF161 .C458 2019 (print) | DDC204/.4—dc23LC record available at https://lccn.loc.gov/ 2019004165[https://lccn.loc.gov/2019004165]ISBN 9780307338334Ebook ISBN 9781524762988International Edition ISBN 9780593136096Cover design by Pete Garceauv5.4ep"},{"pageContent":"CONTENTSCover [Chop_9781524762988_epub3_cvi_r1.xhtml]Title Page [Chop_9781524762988_epub3_tp_r1.xhtml]Copyright [Chop_9781524762988_epub3_cop_r1.xhtml]A Personal Preface: Going Beyond [Chop_9781524762988_epub3_c001_r1.xhtml]Overview: Metahuman Is the Choice of a Lifetime[Chop_9781524762988_epub3_c002_r1.xhtml]PART ONE [Chop_9781524762988_epub3_p001_r1.xhtml]THE SECRETS OF METAREALITY [Chop_9781524762988_epub3_p001_r1.xhtml]1: We Are Entangled in an Illusion [Chop_9781524762988_epub3_c003_r1.xhtml]2: “I” Is the Creator of Illusion [Chop_9781524762988_epub3_c004_r1.xhtml]3: Human Potential Is Infinite [Chop_9781524762988_epub3_c005_r1.xhtml]4: Metareality Offers Absolute Freedom [Chop_9781524762988_epub3_c006_r1.xhtml]5: Mind, Body, Brain, and Universe Are Modified Consciousness[Chop_9781524762988_epub3_c007_r1.xhtml]6: Existence and Consciousness Are the Same[Chop_9781524762988_epub3_c008_r1.xhtml]PART TWO [Chop_9781524762988_epub3_p002_r1.xhtml]WAKING UP [Chop_9781524762988_epub3_p002_r1.xhtml]7: Putting Experience First [Chop_9781524762988_epub3_c009_r1.xhtml]8: Going Beyond All Stories [Chop_9781524762988_epub3_c010_r1.xhtml]9: The Direct Path [Chop_9781524762988_epub3_c011_r1.xhtml]PART THREE [Chop_9781524762988_epub3_p003_r1.xhtml]BEING METAHUMAN [Chop_9781524762988_epub3_p003_r1.xhtml]10: Freeing Your Body [Chop_9781524762988_epub3_c012_r1.xhtml]11: Recovering the Whole Mind [Chop_9781524762988_epub3_c013_r1.xhtml]12: Choiceless Awareness [Chop_9781524762988_epub3_c014_r1.xhtml]13: One Life [Chop_9781524762988_epub3_c015_r1.xhtml]A MONTH OF AWAKENING:31 METAHUMAN LESSONS [Chop_9781524762988_epub3_p004_r1.xhtml]A Final Word [Chop_9781524762988_epub3_epl_r1.xhtml]Acknowledgments [Chop_9781524762988_epub3_ack_r1.xhtml]About the Author [Chop_9781524762988_epub3_ata_r1.xhtml]"},{"pageContent":"A PERSONAL PREFACE GOING BEYONDThis book is an invitation to find out who you really are, beginning with twosimple questions. In moments when you feel very happy, do you also watchyourself being happy? When you happen to get angry, is some part of you totallyfree of anger? If you answer “yes” to both questions, you can stop reading. Youhave arrived. You have gone beyond everyday awareness, and this going beyond iswhat it takes to know who you really are. Self-knowledge will unfold for youevery day. In time—or perhaps at this very moment—you will see yourself livingin the light. Like the great Bengali poet Rabindranath Tagore, you can say,“That I exist is a perpetual surprise.”It would be fascinating to meet you, because your existence no doubt is quiteunusual—you might even assume that you are unique. You look around and see thatthe vast majority of people are simply happy when they are happy, and angry whenthey are angry. But not you. You see beyond.When I began writing books thirty years ago, there was no question that beinghappy and getting angry were normal, without the added element of watchingyourself. A word like mindfulness wasn’t in the air; meditation was stillconsidered dubious by the average person, and the whole question of higherconsciousness was viewed with hard-eyed skepticism. I was a young Boston doctorwith a growing family, and my days were consumed with work, servicing a largepatient roster and traveling every day between two or more hospitals.When I was happy about a patient with a thyroid condition getting well, did Iwatch myself being happy? Absolutely not. If the wrong prescription was filledby a careless pharmacist, was a part of me not at all upset, standing by like asilent witness? No. In common with everyone else I knew, I was happy or angrywithout any mystery about it. But coming from India, I could reach back into mychildhood for clues about a different state of being. According to an ancientUpanishad, the human mind is like two birds sitting on a branch. One of thebirds is eating the fruit of the tree while the other lovingly looks on.Since I went for some years to a school run by an order of Catholic brothers,there were other clues from a different source, such as Jesus telling hisdisciples to be “in the world but not of it.” If you Google that phrase, you’llfind a wealth of confusion about what it actually means, but the kernel of theteaching is that there is a difference between buying into worldly life and notbuying into it. When you don’t buy into it, Jesus teaches, you are somehow withGod.I wish I could say that these clues about higher consciousness transfixed me andshaped my life. They didn’t. I stored them in the back of my mind, never callingupon them in my busy, stress-filled life. There was no budding awareness of theTruth with a capital T, which is that I, and everyone else in the world, embodythe mystery of existence. This is the reason, ultimately, why Tagore foundhimself perpetually surprised. Once you wake up to reality, you face the mysteryof existence intimately and personally: there could be no mystery without you.In a sentence or two I’ve taken some giant leaps, I know. There’s a yawning gulfbetween the things a person must do in a day—beginning with waking up, gettingdressed, going to work, and so on—and the mystery of existence. A society basedon reason and science looks with skepticism on any such notion as being in theworld but not of it, or Truth with a capital T. We live together in a realitythat obeys the rule of “What you see is what you get.” The physical worldconfronts us; we come to grips with its many challenges; and, as the rationalmind probes the dark unknown, what emerges are new facts and data, not a senseof wonder that we even exist.What first coaxed me into facing the mystery of life—and the mystery of myselfas a human being—was medicine. I practiced endocrinology, a specialty thatfascinated me because hormones are unique chemicals. They can make you sluggishand dull if you have a thyroid deficiency; they can make you run away or fightwhen confronted by a threat. A burst of adrenaline is responsible for a commonreaction to a street magician levitating before our very eyes as onlookers jumpback or run away.We are so used to accepting that these behaviors are chemically induced thatalmost everyone connects adolescent behavior with “raging hormones.” Even whensexual drive is tamed somewhat, it is never truly tamed, just as falling in loveis never rational. If I had been satisfied to accept this commonsense connectionbetween hormones and the effects they cause, there would be no more story.But there is a fly in the ointment, and it disrupts things far beyondhormones—it potentially overturns reality itself. There is a brain hormonecalled oxytocin that has gained the popular name of the “love hormone,” becausethe presence of higher levels of this hormone in the brain makes a person moreaffectionate and trusting. But this one molecule secreted by the pituitary glandis much more complex than that. Higher levels are secreted in the mother duringbirth and breastfeeding, promoting a close bond with the baby. If you pet yourdog for a while, oxytocin goes up in both you and your dog. Oxytocin makespeople love their national flag more, while being indifferent to the flags ofother countries. During sexual activity, oxytocin rises in women, making thembond with their sexual partners emotionally, but the effect doesn’t seem tohappen in men.Something strange must be going on, and yet these complex findings don’t shakethe faith of most endocrinologists. I was different. What bothered me was thatoxytocin doesn’t actually do anything it is credited with doing unless the mindgoes along with it. A woman won’t have more affection for a sexual partner ifshe is coerced, frightened, angry, or simply distracted by something moreimportant. Your oxytocin won’t go up if you pet a dog you dislike. You won’tlove your country’s flag if you are forced to salute it by an authoritarianregime.I came to see the explosive effect of the mind-body connection. It was as if weare two creatures, one a robot that can be programmed by chemicals, the other afree agent who thinks, considers, and decides. These two creatures are seeminglyincompatible. They have no right to exist together, and yet they do, asreflected in the setup of our nervous system. One part operates automatically,enabling life to go on without your thinking about it. You don’t have to thinkto keep breathing or have your heart beat. But you can consciously take control,and the voluntary nervous system allows you to alter your breathing and even,with a little practice, slow down your heart rate.Suddenly, we are on the verge of a mystery, because something must decidewhether to take action, or not. That something cannot be the brain, because thebrain is indifferent about whether it employs either side of the central nervoussystem. On the involuntary side, the brain increases your heart rate if you runa marathon, but it was you who decided to run the marathon in the first place.So who is this “you”?That niggling question is what disrupts reality. At any given moment you—thatis, the self—decide which nervous system to call upon; therefore, you cannot bethe creation of either one. When you see this simple fact, you are on the roadto self-awareness. You can be happy and watch yourself being happy at the sametime; you start to experience yourself completely without anger, even as you aredisplaying anger.The reason for this shift is simple: you have gone beyond the mechanical side oflife. You have awakened to who you really are, the user of the brain but not thebrain, the traveler in a body but not the body, the thinker of thoughts who isfar, far more than any thought. As I will show in the following pages, your trueself is beyond time and space. When you identify with your true self, you havefulfilled the dictum to be in the world but not of it. The Greek word meta means“beyond,” so I’m using it to describe the reality that lies beyond “What you seeis what you get.” When you occupy metareality, you are metahuman.In fits and starts, everyone is already there. Metareality is the source of allcreativity, because without going beyond the old and conventional, there wouldbe no new thoughts, artworks, books, or scientific discoveries. No matter howmany thoughts you’ve had in your life, there are infinitely more you can think;no matter how many sentences writers have written, there are infinitely more towrite. Words and thoughts are not stored in the brain like information in acomputer, to be juggled around mechanically when another thought is needed.Shakespeare wasn’t simply juggling his Elizabethan vocabulary—he employed wordsin a creative way. Van Gogh didn’t simply combine the standard colors in thespectrum; he used color as a new way of seeing the world around him.Going beyond is how a person decides if life is meaningful enough. When you wantmore than your life is giving you, it’s not your brain that craves more meaning,nor is it the everyday person going about the routine business of life. Theself, viewing things from a higher perspective, is deciding the matter. The selfalso decides whom to love, what is truth, whether to trust, and so on. If amother judges that a cranky three-year-old needs a nap, she has gone beyond asimple assessment of what the child is doing and saying. Cranky children say allkinds of things, and if mothers bought into them, they’d be no better thanchildren.If going beyond has proven so indispensable, why aren’t we metahuman already?There is no reason to keep repeating the same trite, tired opinions, follow thesame outworn social conventions, and surrender to conformist thinking. All posetraps that we fall into, and the result is more of the same strife, wars,domestic violence, racial prejudice, and gender inequality that we have beenprey to throughout history. We choose to be our own prisoners. This paradox,playing the part of inmate and jailer at the same time, has caused untoldsuffering for humanity.To bring the whole sorry mess to an end involves one thing: shifting from humanto metahuman. Both states exist here and now. There is nowhere to go to reachmetareality. Like the two birds in the tree, you are feasting on life while alsolooking on. But the looking-on part is being ignored, suppressed, overlooked,and undervalued. The transformation that makes you metahuman is known in theworld’s spiritual traditions as “waking up.” Once someone rises to the state ofmetahuman, it seems as if the old everyday self was a sleepwalker, barelyconscious of life’s infinite possibilities.To be awake is to embrace full self-awareness. Lots of other metaphors come tomind. Metahuman is like tuning in to the whole radio band instead of one narrowchannel. It’s like a string vibrating to a higher note. It’s like seeing a worldin a grain of sand. But like is a limiting word. The real thing is indescribableand must be experienced firsthand, just as sight is indescribable to someoneborn blind and yet revelatory if that person gains sight.Editors encourage writers to coax readers, using a big promise of something,new, fresh, and different. Waking up is as old as being human. It’s impossibleto promise something like waking up, which is indescribable in the first place.Looking back on my previous works, I feel that I was inhibited by how peculiarand mysterious it is to wake up. This time, however, I’ve taken a deep breathand gone for broke. I’m trusting that the reader isn’t someone born blind towhom sight is completely unknowable. With a modicum of trust, we can all beshown that we are already metahuman and that metareality is here and now.I don’t know who will be persuaded and who won’t. In the end, the mystery ofbeing human obeys only itself. But one thing I do have faith in. If in readingthis book you connect with what it means to wake up, you will realize the truthin much less time than the thirty years I look back on. The faster thatmetahuman dawns in our lives, the better."},{"pageContent":"OVERVIEW METAHUMAN IS THE CHOICE OF A LIFETIMEThere are many things people do to improve their lives. You might say thatdeveloped societies live in a golden age, as far as standard of living goes. Ithas become realistic to look forward to decades of good health, to eat organicwhole foods available around the corner, not to mention having things that wereonce out of reach for the average person, such as owning your own home andretiring in relative security.It is strange, then, that millions of people strive to improve their liveswithout improving their personal reality. The two are intimately entwined, andif you don’t improve your reality, there’s something shaky and unreliable aboutimproving your life. Reality isn’t simply the world “out there”—it is verypersonal. Two commuters going to the same job might look at the world entirelydifferently, one feeling anxious about job security and the prospect of beingfired, the other placidly content and optimistic. Giving birth could be the samephysical event, without any medical complications, for two new mothers, but onemight suffer from postpartum depression while the other is filled with maternaljoy.Personal reality defines us. It consists of all the things we believe in, theemotions we feel, our unique set of memories, and a lifetime of experiences andrelationships. Nothing is more decisive in how a person’s life turns out. So itis peculiar—one might say profoundly mysterious—that we build our lives on adeep lack of knowledge about who we really are. Delve into any basic issue abouthuman existence, and behind the façade of expert opinion lies a blankness whereunderstanding should be.We have no idea why humans are designed to both love and hate, preach peace andpractice violence, swing between happiness and despair, and lead lives governedby confidence one moment and self-doubt the next. Right now you are acting outin your own fashion all these contradictions. You are a mystery to yourself,because everyone is a mystery to themselves. What keeps people moving forward isthe routine of everyday life and the hope that nothing goes horribly wrong.I’m not devaluing the things most people live for—family, work, andrelationships. But, to be blunt, we don’t manage even the most important thingswith any confidence that we know what we’re doing. It’s no wonder that we spendso much time working to improve our lives and so little working to improve ourreality. Reality is too confusing. We are better off ignoring the deep water andremaining where it is safe in the shallows.A handful of people, however, have ventured into deeper waters, and in everyculture they bring back reports that are alien and inspiring at the same time.It’s inspiring to love your enemies, but who really does? Being told that divinelove is infinite doesn’t make it so in your reality. Eternal peace vies with theprospect of crime, war, and violence in every age. A handful of people arecherished as saints, with a good chance they will be labeled as mad instead, orsimply dismissed as too good for this world.Yet one thing is beyond doubt—personal reality is where the whole game isplayed. It contains all the potential that humans have fulfilled, but also allthe limitations that hold us back. A New York psychologist named Abraham Maslow,who died in 1970, continues to be famous today because he swam against the tide.Where the typical career in psychology consisted of examining the ills anddefects of the psyche, Maslow felt that human nature went far beyond everydayexperience. His core idea, which has now blossomed far beyond anything he couldhave imagined, is that humans are designed for extraordinary heights ofexperience, and, more than that, we should be creating these experiences ineveryday life. It was as if the only cars that were on the road were junky rustheaps, and someone announced that you could trade in your clunker for a Mercedesor Jaguar.If the only cars you see are junk heaps and the Mercedes and Jaguars exist faracross the ocean, your reality won’t change. But Maslow, drawing on centuries ofspiritual aspirations, insisted that the peak experiences in life are part ofour design, that we need and crave them. The key was to go beyond the everyday.The notion of going beyond became the motivation for this book.To discover who you really are, you must go beyond who you think you are. Tofind peace, you must go beyond fear. To experience unconditional love, you mustgo beyond conditional love, the kind that comes and goes. I even thought for atime that this book should simply be titled Beyond. Instead I chose Metahuman,using the Greek word meta, which I noted earlier means “beyond.” My thesis isthat becoming metahuman is a major shift of identity that anyone can make. Beingdesigned for peak experiences raises the question of whether we have a choice.Often the most illuminating moments in life descend as if from another, higherplane by themselves. How do we know they aren’t accidental?At a recent conference on science and consciousness, a young woman introducedherself, telling me that she was writing her graduate thesis on communicatingwith birds. I asked her how talking to birds was possible, and she replied thatit was easier to show me than to tell me. We went outside. It was a bright day,and we sat quietly on a bench. She looked up at some birds sitting in a treenearby, and one of them flew down and landed unafraid in her lap.How did she do it? Feeling no need for words, she gave me a look that said,“See? It’s very simple.” My old Catholic schoolteachers would have pointed toSt. Francis of Assisi, who is often portrayed beatifically with birds flutteringto him. From the Indian tradition, I thought of a quality in consciousness knownas ahimsa, which means “harmlessness,” the empathy extended to all livingthings.In either case, it wasn’t a matter of talking to the birds or knowing theirlanguage—the whole thing had taken place silently. It was a perfect example ofgoing beyond—in this case, going beyond my own expectations. What the youngwoman did, she explained later, was to have mental clarity and insert anintention for the bird to come to her. In other words, it all happened inconsciousness.So few people have such experiences that it only magnifies the need to show howmuch choice we really have to go beyond. My strong feeling is that we have muchmore control over life than we currently realize.To me, metahuman is the choice of a lifetime. Peak experiences are only thebeginning, a glimpse at what is possible.The term peak experience has become popular enough that most people have ageneral sense of what it means. The term describes moments when limitations dropaway and life-changing insights come our way or a superb performance happenseffortlessly. The quarterback in NFL football who approaches age forty withmultiple Super Bowl wins, the musical prodigy who debuts in a Mozart pianoconcerto at age eight, the mathematical whiz who can multiply two eighteen-digitnumbers in a matter of seconds—we don’t have to search far to find stories ofpeak performance like these that hint at enormously expanded human potential.But these accomplishments, astonishing as they are, occupy a specific niche.When fame and fortune are lavished on the exceptional few, we miss a muchgreater possibility that applies to the many.Reality is much more malleable than anyone supposes. Most of the limitationsthat you feel are imposed on you personally are actually self-imposed. Notknowing who you really are keeps you stuck in secondhand beliefs, nursing oldwounds, following outworn conditioning, and suffering a sense of self-doubt andself-judgment. No one’s life is free of these limitations. The ordinary world,and our ordinary lives in the world, are not sufficient to reveal who we reallyare—quite the opposite. The ordinary world has deceived us, and this deceptionruns so deep that we have molded ourselves to conform to it. In law, taintedevidence is known as the “fruit of the poisonous tree.” It’s not an exaggerationto say that as good as life can get, there is still a taint stemming from thedeceptions we mistake for reality. Nothing, however beautiful and good, hascompletely escaped this taint. Going beyond is the only way to escape it.A metahuman is someone whose personality is based on higher values; not justpeak experiences, but love and self-worth. After finishing this book I wasdelighted to find that Maslow had actually used the term metahuman in exactlythis way. (He didn’t associate it with comic book superheroes, and neither do I.While fantasy metahumans are persecuted as freaks and threats to society, thisis a connotation to be avoided completely.)It’s all well and good to consider certain experiences so exalted that they seemdivine, which is where Maslow placed metahuman. It was an important step todeclare that aspiring to reach God or eternal peace and love is just as real asdriving in a nail. But I will argue that becoming metahuman is an urgentnecessity. It is the only way out of the illusions that play out in our lives asinner suffering, confusion, and conflict.THE FANTASY OF EVERYDAY LIFEEveryone would agree that it is better to live in reality than in fantasy. So itwill come as a shock that you have been living in a fantasy all your life. It’san all-embracing illusion you bought into from earliest childhood. Even the mostpractical, hardheaded person is immersed in fantasy all the time. I don’t meanflights of fancy or erotic fantasies or dreams of getting rich overnight.Nothing you perceive is as it seems. Everything is an illusion from the groundup.Take out your smartphone and look at any photo you’ve saved on it. The image isseveral inches across, whether the photo is of the Grand Canyon, a mouse, or amicrobe. Your eyes are about as far apart as the screen of a smartphone, but youperceive the Grand Canyon, a mouse, and a microbe as hugely different in size.How do we automatically adjust the size of what appears on a smartphone? No oneknows, and this becomes even more puzzling when you consider that the retina atthe back of the eye is curved and the image projected on it is upside down. Whydoesn’t the world look as distorted as in a funhouse mirror?You could shrug your shoulders and ascribe the whole mystery to the brain, whichmassages the raw data reaching the eye and gives us a realistic picture of theworld. But this only deepens the illusion. When we say that our eyes respond to“visible light,” we conveniently skip over the fact that the elementaryparticles of light—photons—are invisible. A photon has no radiance, luster,color, or any other characteristic we associate with light. Like a Geigercounter that clicks madly in the presence of high levels of radioactivity andemits only a few clicks at low levels, the retina “clicks” madly when millionsof photons trigger the rods and cones that line it and clicks faintly when lightlevels are low (which we call darkness).Either way, everything you think you see has been processed inside your brain,in a specific region known as the visual cortex, which is totally dark. Aflashbulb blinding you in the eye is just as black in the brain as the faintestglimmer of stars at night. Nor do the signals reaching the visual cortex formpictures, much less 3-D images. The picture you take to be a snapshot of theworld was fabricated by your mind.In the same fashion, the other four senses are just “clicks” on the surface ofother kinds of cells. There is no explanation for why the nerve endings in yournose should turn the bombardment of molecules floating around into the scent ofa rose or the stink of a garbage dump. The entire three-dimensional world isbased on a magic trick no one can explain, but it is certainly not a truepicture of reality. The whole thing is mind-made.A neuroscientist would stop and correct me, claiming that the world we perceiveis brain-made instead. A few simple examples disprove this contention, however.As far as your brain is concerned, the letters on this page are black specks, nodifferent from specks you might scatter randomly with flecks of ink off a brush.Before you learned to read the alphabet, letters were only meaningless specks,while after you learned to read they became meaningful. Yet you had the samebrain from three years old onward, as far as processing information goes. Themind learns to read, not the brain. Likewise, anything you see around you—an elmtree, a Belgian chocolate bar, a church, or a cemetery—acquires meaning becauseyour mind gives it meaning.Another example: When children who were born blind are given sight throughmedical means, they are baffled by things we take for granted. A cow in thedistance looks the same size to them as a cat close up. Stairs look painted onthe wall; their own shadow is a mysterious black patch that insists on followingthem around. What such children have missed—and need to catch up with—is thelearning curve by which we all learned to shape ordinary reality. (Sodiscomfiting is the visible world that newly sighted children and adults oftenprefer to sit in the dark to regain a sense of comfort.)The learning curve is necessary to make your way in the world, but you haveadapted yourself in strange and unexpected ways. Take perspective. If you arelying in bed and someone touches your shoulder to wake you up, you don’t see theperson having a very wide body with a small head on top. But take a photo from aposition lying in bed and reality is revealed. The person’s torso, being levelwith your eyes, is unnaturally wide, while the head, being farther away, isunnaturally small. Likewise, when you are talking to someone right next to you,his nose is swollen out of proportion, and if you compare it to a photo, hiseyes might be bigger than the hand resting in his lap.We automatically block out how things really look in perspective, and through anact of mind we adjust the data. The data reaching your eye reports that the roomyou are sitting in has walls that converge closer together at the far end, butyou know that the room is square, so you adjust the data accordingly. You knowthat a nose is smaller than a hand, requiring a similar adjustment.What causes real shock is that everything you perceive is adjusted. Floatingmolecules in the garden are adjusted into fragrances. Vibrating airwaves areadjusted into sounds you recognize and identify. There is no escaping that welive in a mind-made world. This is both the glory and the peril of being human.Walking the streets of London two hundred years ago, the visionary poet WilliamBlake lamented over what he saw:> [I] mark in every face I meet> > Marks of weakness, marks of woe.> > In every cry of every man,> > In every infant’s cry of fear,> > In every voice: in every ban,> > The mind-forged manacles I hearIt’s a woeful picture, still being repeated today. Humans have wandered intoevery kind of suffering and hardship out of a deep-seated belief that we aredestined to lead such an existence. There is no alternative until you acceptthat what the mind has made, it can unmake.WELCOME TO THE HOUSE OF ILLUSIONSWhile participating in the everyday world, it isn’t possible to see beyond theillusion. Going beyond is needed, which is why the shift to metahuman is needed.The only way an illusion can be all-encompassing is if everything about it isdeceptive, fooling us about the big things and the little things alike. That’sthe case here. The human mind has constructed everything to suit itself from theground up. In a sense, this book was written simply to convince you that yourpersonal reality is totally mind-made, and not just by your mind alone. Havingspent a lifetime adapting to the artificial reality you inherited as a child,you have to undertake a journey to discover the difference between reality andillusion.To anyone who accepts the physical world “out there” as totally real, the notionof a mind-made world seems absurd. It’s one thing to be struck by an idea, butquite another to be struck by lightning. The difference is so obvious that you’ddistrust anyone who told you that the two events were the same.But some of the greatest minds have said just that. This is where the realfascination begins. Max Planck, a brilliant German physicist, was a major figurein the quantum revolution; in fact, he coined the term quantum mechanics. In a1931 interview with the Observer newspaper in London, Planck said, “I regardconsciousness as fundamental. I regard matter as derivative from consciousness.We cannot get behind consciousness. Everything that we talk about, everythingthat we regard as existing, postulates consciousness.”In other words, consciousness is fundamental. If that’s true, then rosesblooming in an English garden spring from the same source as a painting of arose. That source is awareness, meaning your awareness. Without consciousness,nothing can be proven to exist. Simply by being conscious, you participate inthe mind-made world and help create it every day. The beauty of thisunderstanding is that if creation springs from consciousness, we can reshapereality from its source.Planck was not alone in his reinterpretation of reality, away from the physicaltoward the mental. The whole drift of the quantum revolution was to dismantlethe commonsense view that the world is first and foremost material, solid, andtangible. Another brilliant quantum pioneer, the German physicist WernerHeisenberg, said, “What we observe is not nature itself, but nature exposed toour method of questioning.”The implications of this statement are astonishing. Gaze out your window, andyou might see a tree, a cloud, a swath of grass, or the sky. Plug any of thosewords into Heisenberg’s sentence in place of the word nature. You see a treebecause you ask to see a tree. You see a mountain, a cloud, the sky for the samereason. As an observer, everything outside your window comes into being throughthe questions you are asking. You might not be aware of asking questions, butthat’s only because they were asked so early on. When toddlers spy their firsttree, they test to see what it is, basically asking, “Is this hard or soft?Rough or smooth? Tall or short? What are those green things on the branches? Whydo they ripple in the breeze?” In this way, by applying human consciousness toeverything in the universe, we get answers that fit human consciousness. But wedon’t get reality. Physics dismantles every quality of a tree—its hardness,height, shape, and color—by revealing that all objects are actually invisibleripples in the quantum field.If this discussion seems too abstract, it can be brought very close to home.Your body is being created in consciousness right this minute; otherwise, itcouldn’t exist. Again, Heisenberg can be credited with getting there early: “Theatoms or elementary particles themselves are not real; they form a world ofpotentialities or possibilities.” But in the commonsense world, where the bodyis our shelter, life support system, and personal vehicle for getting around,defending it becomes necessary. It’s too disturbing to think of our body as amental illusion.THE ANTI-ROBOT ARGUMENTShifting away from the false assumption that the world is solid and physicalruns counter to a trend I find increasingly disturbing. Science persistentlytries to prove that human beings are machines, and where this was once just ametaphor for how the body works in all its complex parts, man-as-machine isbeing taken more and more literally. We are told that the complexity of humanemotions can be reduced to rising and falling levels of brain hormones. Brainareas that light up on an fMRI scan supposedly indicate the causation ormechanism behind a person feeling depressed or being prone to criminal behaviorand much else. Besides being brain puppets, we are supposed to believe that ourgenes program us in powerful ways, to the point that “bad” genes doom a personto a host of problems, from schizophrenia to Alzheimer’s. Those examples ofpredisposition are then extended to behaviors and traits like being prone toanxiety and depression.Metahuman has many implications, but one of the strongest is to rebuff thenotion that human beings are primarily mechanisms. Even though science has awealth of findings about both genes and the brain, that doesn’t make that notionany more valid. The general public isn’t aware, for example, that only 5 percentof disease-related genetic mutations will definitely cause a particular illness.The other 95 percent of genes raise or lower a person’s risk factors and, incomplex ways, interact with other genes.The public is still stuck on a misconception that a single gene, like theso-called “gay gene” or the “selfishness gene,” exists and creates anirresistible predisposition. This misconception was obliterated when the humangenome was mapped. The current picture of DNA is almost the opposite of thepublic’s misguided image. DNA isn’t fixed; it is fluid and dynamic, constantlyinteracting with the outside world and with your inner thoughts and feelings.The notion that your genes run your life is ingrained, even among educatedpeople, so it is eye-opening to review a recent experiment published in theDecember 10, 2018, issue of Nature: Human Behavior. Researchers in thepsychology department of Stanford University took two groups of participants andtested them for two genes, one associated with higher risk of becoming obese,the other with higher risk of performing badly in physical exercise.First I’ll focus on the obesity gene. The participants ate a meal and afterwardwere asked how full they felt; in addition, their blood was tested for levels ofleptin, the hormone associated with feeling full after a meal. The results wereabout the same for people genetically prone to obesity and those who weren’t.The next week the same group returned and ate the same meal, but with adifference. Half the group was told, completely randomly, that they had the genethat protects someone from risk for obesity while the other group was told theyhad the higher-risk version of the gene.To the surprise of researchers, there was an immediate and dramatic effect.Simply by being told that they had the protective gene, subjects showed a bloodlevel of leptin two and a half times higher than before. The group who were toldthey didn’t have the protective gene didn’t change from their earlier results.What this indicates is that simply being told about a genetic benefit causedpeople to exhibit the physiology associated with that gene. What theparticipants believed to be true overrode their actual genetic predisposition,because in some cases the people who thought they were genetically protectedactually weren’t.The same dramatic results occurred in the exercise experiment. People who weretold that they had a gene that produced poor results from exercise displayed thecardiovascular and respiratory signs that such a gene is supposed to produce.Even though they didn’t have the at-risk gene, merely by being told they didreduced their lung capacity and made them too exhausted to continue running on atreadmill.In short, the body conforms to mind-made reality. If your physiology producesgenetic effects simply by hearing that you have a certain gene, the myth ofgenes controlling our lives is seriously challenged. It’s not that geneticprogramming is irrelevant (for the full picture, refer to the book Super Genes,which I cowrote with Harvard geneticist Rudy Tanzi), but the reality is ascomplex as human life itself. Genes are among the host of causes and influencesthat affect us. How strongly they affect any given person is impossible topredict, and in every area of behavior and health there is wide latitude forpersonal choice.Given an either/or choice, see yourself as a free agent capable of consciouschange, rather than a robotic machine run by genes and brain cells. Life israrely as simple as either/or, which is true here as well. But despite thepublic image fostered by popular science articles, it’s not true that a humanbeing is a biological puppet. Far closer to the truth is the view that we areconscious agents whose potential for creativity and change is unlimited. Webecome metahuman by making the life-altering choice to be metahumans.AT THE METAHUMAN CROSSROADSI don’t expect you to accept this conclusion—not yet, anyway. The overallpicture needs to be sketched before you make up your mind. Without realizing it,we are all embedded in a preformed reality that we began to adapt to in infancy.Everything you perceive at this moment through the five senses—the solid wallsof your room, the faint movement of air in your lungs, the brightness of thelight streaming in through the window or emitted by a lamp—is a simulation, aconstruct that engulfs you in a virtual reality.On the one hand, we are set up—brain, body, and mind—to conform to virtualreality, the result of a collective hoodwinking that has taken many thousands ofyears to create. This makes things very tricky. A prisoner has an incentive todig a tunnel to the outside world, because he knows that there’s something lyingbeyond the prison walls. The virtual reality you now experience offers nothingon the other side that you can touch, taste, feel, hear, or smell. But somethingdoes lie outside virtual reality, which I’ll term metareality. Metareality isthe workshop where consciousness creates everything. It is our source andorigin, a field of pure creative potential. Metareality is not perceived by thefive senses, because it has no shape or location. Yet it is totally accessible,and it offers our only means to escape simulated reality.Once you realize that you are engulfed in a simulation, it dawns on you howinfinite the creative power of humans really is. We fashioned our world usingnot bricks and mortar but one invisible material: consciousness. In a scientificage, this assertion seems incredible, if not absurd. From inside the simulation,creation can be viewed like a movie of the universe unfolding from the big bangonward, along a time line that has taken 13.7 billion years. How can thismind-boggling arena, bounded by time, space, matter, and energy, be essentiallyfake?To find out, it will take a personal sense of curiosity and a touch ofadventurousness to go beyond conventional wisdom. Consciousness is present inevery second of our lives, yet conventional wisdom takes it for granted. Thisisn’t like missing the forest for the trees. It’s like living in the forestwithout seeing any trees at all.Take the enormously popular book Homo Deus, whose overarching theme is theinvention of the future. The author, Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari, wantsto offer a new and better starting point for the future. Age-old burdens fromthe past once seemed inescapable, Harari writes:> The same three problems preoccupied the people of twentieth-century China, of> medieval India and of ancient Egypt. Famine, plague and war were always at the> top of the list….Many thinkers and prophets concluded that famine, plague and> war must be an integral part of God’s cosmic plan or of our imperfect nature.In a burst of optimism rare among futurists, Harari goes on to write that theseproblems are essentially solved, even though they persist in pockets around theglobe: “[A]t the dawn of the third millennium, humanity wakes up to an amazingrealisation….[I]n the last few decades we have managed to rein in famine, plagueand war.” Eagerly his readers want to accept Harari’s vision that “on the cosmicscale of history humankind can lift its eyes up and start looking towards newhorizons.”And what are these horizons? In Homo Deus, Harari takes the reader on a journeythrough all the existing problems and a roster of possible solutions thatfuturists love to explore. Only on page 409 does he arrive at consciousness, andthen he touts a future dominated by “techno-religions”—in other words, ourevolution is leading toward artificial intelligence and supercomputers thatupgrade the raw material of the human brain. Faced with a stupendousintelligence that towers over us, what can we do but worship it?Harari’s vision winds up in the wrong place because it started in the wrongplace. Consciousness belongs on page 1, and the future that evolvedconsciousness can lead to is where humanity should be heading. Every future thathas unfolded throughout history has been based on a direction taken by the mind.Artificial intelligence, after all, is just another notch on the belt of humanintelligence; therefore, predicting that we will be surpassed by a Frankensteinrace of supercomputers is very premature. We need to know our full capacitybefore taking bets on any future. Until metareality becomes a common experience,being human has not reached its full creative capacity. Settling for a betterdream isn’t good enough—an upgraded illusion is still an illusion.IN YOUR LIFETHE METAHUMAN SURVEYThe best evidence we have for going beyond is that everyday people are alreadyexperiencing metareality. One measure of this is a twenty-question surveydeveloped by John Astin and David Butlein, which goes by the awkwardly academictitle of Nondual Embodiment Thematic Inventory (NETI). On a scale from 20 to100, NETI assesses how people rank themselves on qualities long consideredspiritual, psychological, or moral. They include metahuman traits we alreadyvalue highly because they are so meaningful, as well as other traits that makelife easier to cope with, such as the following:CompassionResiliencePropensity to surrenderInterest in truthLack of defensivenessCapacity to tolerate cognitive dissonance (i.e., having inconsistent thoughts,beliefs, or attitudes)Tolerance for emotional discomfortGratitudeLow anxiety levelAuthenticityHumilityThese traits describe human nature liberated from secondhand social norms andconditioning. When you possess these qualities, you are free to reach themetahuman state of awareness.Take a moment to participate personally. Here’s the NETI questionnaire that wasused to assess what are often called “nondual experiences,” meaning a heightenedstate of consciousness. You will give yourself a total score from 20 to 100, andwe’ll proceed from there.NETI QUESTIONNAIRE*1 To download, go to http://prhlink.com/9781524762988a002[http://prhlink.com/9781524762988a002]INSTRUCTIONS: PLEASE INDICATE HOW OFTEN THE FOLLOWING THINGS OCCUR FOR YOU.CIRCLE ONLY ONE ANSWER (NOTE: SCORES ARE REVERSED FOR QUESTIONS 4, 8, 14, AND16):1.

If you experience metahuman awareness all the time, your score will be100. Either one would be extremely rare. The average scores are as follows forthree specific groups drawn from the therapeutic community:Psychology graduate students: 52Psychotherapists: 71Psychotherapists self-reporting as being established in nondual (i.e.,metahuman) awareness: 81.6What does this say about people in everyday life? Most important, can we alldevelop higher consciousness here and now? To find out, a research team that Iwas part of conducted a study on short-term awakening. We got 69 volunteers whowere healthy adults, ranging in age from 32 to 86 (the average age was just over59). There were two requirements: that they would largely abstain from alcoholfor a week (one drink per day was allowed) and that they had not been on ameditation or yoga retreat within the past twelve months.The participants were divided randomly into two groups at the Chopra Center inCarlsbad, California, which offers a spa setting. One group was told to spendthe next six days relaxing and enjoying the spa experience. The other groupunderwent an Ayurveda-based mind-body program aimed at improving overallwell-being. This included a special diet (primarily vegetarian but also gearedto specific body types), massage, meditation, and instructions in leading anAyurvedic lifestyle. The approach is far-reaching in that it covers emotionaland spiritual well-being. We already recognized from years of offering theprogram, known as Perfect Health, that participants would report afterward thatthey felt healthier, less stressed, more relaxed, and generally happier.The specific angle in this new study was to compare the two groups on how theyanswered the NETI questionnaire before and after the six days were up. Themind-body group showed a significant improvement in their scores, compared withthe control group, and the results were sustained on reevaluation one monthlater.*2In the Chopra Center study, participants started out with above-average scores,averaging 62, which is 10 points higher than the typical psychology gradstudent. After being divided into the two groups, the group that went throughthe Perfect Health regimen had a mean score of 74 (higher than the averagepsychotherapist), while the group that went through six days of relaxation in aspa setting improved only marginally, with an average score of 68. Whenevaluated a month later, there was a small increase among the Perfect Healthgroup, from 74 to 76, while the score for the relaxation group remained flat.Your score is meant to give you a rough idea of where you stand, with the caveatthat this was just one small study. It is striking and hopeful to find that aweeklong focus on mind and body increases these experiences, and the road aheadis open to anyone who wants to develop even better training programs.I’m not suggesting that the Perfect Health approach based on Ayurveda is thelast word for reaching higher consciousness. It’s the overall implications thatmatter the most. Metahuman experiences are everywhere, but people differ in howoften they have them. Some people are well established in these experiences,which have occurred frequently over the course of a lifetime. Such people maytake for granted an experience like feeling blissful energy in their bodies. Thesame experience would astound someone else if it came out of the blue and wastotally new.The range of consciousness is far greater than a questionnaire can measure,obviously. Still, an enormous question is posed: Why live in limitation whenexpanded awareness offers such great rewards, such as the sense of peace andunderstanding that come when you know who you really are and the unlimitedcreative potential that you were designed to fulfill?*1 Developed by John Astin and David A. Butlein.*2 Complete research details were published in a peer-reviewed article in theJournal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine in December 2017. Thecoauthors come from a range of institutions, from the University ofCalifornia–Davis, Harvard Medical School, Duke University, and the Chopra Centerfor Wellbeing. Very quickly the article became widely cited. Its lengthy titleis “Change in Sense of Nondual Awareness and Spiritual Awakening in Response toa Multidimensional Well-Being Program.”"},{"pageContent":"Part One The Secrets of Metareality[../images/Chop_9781524762988_epub3_007_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"1 WE ARE ENTANGLED IN AN ILLUSIONSomewhere in prehistory Homo sapiens crossed over into virtual reality, when amind-made simulation became essential in our evolutionary path. The exact erawill never be known, or the reason, if any, why one species should acquire suchpowers and know that it had them. No other creature consciously shapes itsfuture. No other species tells stories and convinces itself that they are true.There are many mysteries in our past. Somehow, following whatever tortuous path,we managed to make our simulation so convincing that we got lost in it.Although this simulation is very convincing, on a daily basis it breaks down.There are times when life goes out of kilter and the world doesn’t seem real andsubstantial anymore. Such experiences occur regularly, either to ourselves or toother people. For example, when there’s a sudden death in the family or acatastrophe like a tornado or the house burning down, we may go into shock. Witha blank stare we reveal how dislocated our existence suddenly feels, sayingthings like “This can’t be happening. It’s unreal” or “Nothing matters anymore.”Normally, this dissociated state will pass, and in time reality feels realagain. But some people never return—after a psychotic break, for example, apercentage of mental patients become chronically schizophrenic and havehallucinations, seeing images or hearing voices for the rest of their lives. Butthe feeling of “This can’t be happening; it’s like a dream” doesn’t have to betriggered by shock. Countless people engage in personal fantasies of fame,wealth, or some other dream that feels totally real to them and drives them alltheir lives. When someone is suddenly ecstatically happy, for whatever reason,everything can seem surreal, too.However, the physical world “out there” feels real and substantial a lot morethan 99 percent of the time, which is proof enough, one would think, that wearen’t under some kind of spell. But we are. Ironically, there’s now technologythat forces a person to confront what is real and what isn’t. When you don avirtual reality (VR) headset, powered by artificial intelligence, the simulationyou are plunged into is like a wraparound, three-dimensional movie of suchvividness that it overwhelms the senses and causes a dislocation from what wedeem as everyday reality. You might find yourself precariously perched on asteel construction girder in midair with the city street many stories below.Your brain, fooled by the visual image, triggers the stress response just as ifyou were really teetering on the girder. You will feel yourself going offbalance in a panic, even though in the room where you are actually standing,your feet are firmly on the ground and you are in no danger of plunging to yourdeath.The VR illusion is created by visual images, and the same holds true in everydaylife. What you see, you believe in. Such trust is misplaced, as everygrade-schooler learns when told that the sun doesn’t actually rise in the eastand set in the west. Yet when quantum physics tells us that matter isn’t what itappears to be, we continue to cling to the sensations of weight and solidity ofhard physical objects as if they were indisputable. Would a bullet be lessdangerous if you saw through the illusion? No. The bullet and the entirephysical world remain intact but with the realization that they are the endpoint of a process that begins in consciousness.Once you grasp this and fully absorb it, your personal reality becomes much moremalleable, because you can go to the source and be part of the creative process.Getting untangled from the virtual-reality simulation isn’t easy. Our personalexperience would have to change drastically, but the beauty of it is that wehave the potential for change where before we had none or very little. While youcannot turn bullets into cotton balls, to accept that all of reality “out there”is beyond your ability to change isn’t true.The ground rules of everyday life are much looser than we imagine. Even when aperson feels completely immersed in the simulation, there is an escape route.And not just one, but many. This only makes sense. Metareality is more real thanany virtual simulation. We should regard glimpses into it as evidence that wecan inhabit the meta state all the time. Instead, the entanglements of virtualreality have turned the picture wrong side up. As you read the meta experiencesbelow, you will be tempted to see them as anomalous, freakish, or untrustworthy.Getting real is a process that begins by confronting your misplaced trust inillusions every day.“SOMETHING HAPPENED”Let’s consider one of the most basic aspects of virtual reality. Hardly anyonewould question that being inside the body is normal, natural, and a trueexperience. But this certainty runs counter to the phenomenon of out-of-bodyexperiences (OBEs), which have been documented in every culture for centuries.The most widely publicized out-of-body experience is “going into the light,” asreported by patients who have clinically died during emergency medicalprocedures, especially from heart attacks.*It turns out that expecting to go into the light when we die is misleading,because what happens in near-death experiences is much more individual thananyone thought. The largest study of near-death experiences, which examined2,060 patients who died under emergency or intensive care, arrived at theconclusion that death isn’t a single event—it is a process. There isn’t simplyone final or definitive event. During this process, there are ways to reversedeath. In cases where medical professionals were successful at getting theheart, lungs, and brain to come back to normal functioning, about 40 percent ofthose who died and came back remember that “something happened” when they wereflatlined.This part of the study, which was titled AWARE and was led by Britishintensive-care doctor Sam Parnia, seems irrefutable. But very quickly thedetails of “something happened” become controversial. We have to dive into a fewdetails to see what the issues are. Out of the 2,060 patients who died (thestudy went from 2008 to 2012 and included 33 researchers in 15 hospitals), 104were resuscitated. The first point to note is that all had actually died. Theywere not “near death.” Their hearts and lungs had stopped functioning, andwithin 20 to 30 seconds their brains showed no activity. The decomposition ofcells throughout the body actually takes several hours to commence afterward.During the interval between dying and being brought back is when 39 percentreported the memory of being conscious even though their brains had stopped.Dr. Parnia believes that this is probably just a fraction of those who had suchexperiences; the rest had their memories erased either by brain inflammation,which occurs for 72 hours after a person is brought back from death, or becauseof drugs that are administered as part of resuscitation, which also cause memoryloss. Of the 101 patients who completed the questionnaire about their experienceduring death, only 9 percent had an experience compatible with the typical“going into the light” model. The majority of memories were vague and unfocused,sometimes pleasant but sometimes not.Only 2 percent of those who came back, which means 2 people out of 101, had theexperience of full awareness or out-of-body experiences such as looking downfrom above their bodies watching and listening to the medical team as it wasworking to revive them. Only one person could accurately narrate what had beenhappening in the room in such detail that it corresponded to timed events. Sowhat does this one person tell us about dying?It depends. Skeptics shrug off all such experiences as purely physical, claimingthat if we had finer measurements of brain activity, at a very subtle level we’ddiscover that the brain hadn’t actually died. Dr. Parnia accepts that this mightbe true. His main focus is on how to achieve better results at resuscitationthat might bring back a normal person with no organ damage, particularly braindamage after clinical death. But Dr. Parnia’s personal conclusion is that aperson can be fully conscious without brain function, as this one patient was.He points to the basic disagreement, thousands of years ago, between Aristotleand Plato. Aristotle contended that consciousness was a physical phenomenon,Plato that it was nonphysical, residing in a soul that transcends the body.The AWARE study didn’t confirm either side. Unsurprisingly, skeptics andbelievers didn’t change their position, or their prejudices. One can say thatit’s a significant step to turn death into a process that can be reversed. It’salso significant that awareness during death covers a wide range of experiences,not a one-size-fits-all of going into the light. What I’d like to underscore isthat even when you die, you fashion the experience personally. Dr. Parnia foundthat people’s spiritual interpretation of their death experience coincided withtheir own faith. They interpreted the light as being Christ, if they wereChristians, which was different for Hindus and totally nonspiritual foratheists.What happens when we die, then, is open to interpretation. The only consensusamong those who came back was that death is a comfortable process, not to befeared. Having directly experienced that their fear of death was groundless,these people discovered a different perspective on life. Many if not mostconcluded that they should lead more selfless lives in service to others.I think it is useful that the AWARE study validated that “something happens,”but why are we trying to settle the issue of consciousness at the most extrememoment when life and death hang in the balance? It’s like trying to validategravity by asking survivors of a plane crash about their experience of fallingfrom the sky.It is the normal, everyday experience of consciousness that needs to beexplained, not the extreme states. I’ve debated or conversed with manyneuroscientists, and none has been able to answer the simplest questions aboutconsciousness. These include the following:What is a thought?How does the electrochemical activity in a neuron turn into words, sights, andsounds in our heads?Why is a person’s next thought totally unpredictable?If someone has a vocabulary of 30,000 words, does this mean that a clump ofbrain cells knows 30,000 words? If so, in what way are the words being stored?For the word cat, is there a place inside a brain cell that holds the lettersc-a-t?No one can adequately answer any of these questions.THE SELF-MODELAn experience as otherworldly as “going into the light” might be a red herring.It turns out that being “inside” your body is a malleable state; you can enterand leave your body almost at will.In a fascinating account in The New Yorker, titled “As Real As It Gets” byJoshua Rothman (April 2, 2018), the issue of living inside the body isconfronted with unusual clarity. At nineteen Thomas Metzinger, a Germanuniversity student, fell asleep on a meditation retreat and woke up feeling anitch in his back. According to Rothman:> He tried to scratch it, but couldn’t—his arm seemed paralyzed. He tried to> force the arm to move, and, somehow, this shifted him up and out of his body,> so that he seemed to be floating above himself….He heard someone else> breathing, and, in a panic, looked around for an intruder. Only much later did> he realize that the breathing had been his.This uncanny experience soon ended but left a lasting impression. As ithappened, Metzinger became a prominent philosopher of mind, and he set outassiduously to explain OBEs, which are estimated to occur in 8–15 percent of thepopulation, generally at night or after surgery. As real as his own experiencefelt—it was followed on occasion by other, similar experiences—Metzingerdiscovered its limitations. He couldn’t flick the light switch, for example, orfly out the window to visit his girlfriend.A surprising explanation began to dawn on Metzinger. He discovered the work ofthe psychologist Philip Johnson-Laird and his theory of “mental models.” Insteadof logically assessing the world, Johnson-Laird held, we apply a mental pictureand shift from one mental model to another, depending on the situation. “If youwant to know whether a rug will go with your sofa,” Rothman explains, “you don’tdeduce the answer—you imagine it, by moving furniture around on a mentalstage set.”Metzinger began to wonder if what we call reality isn’t merely a stage setarranged and colored in by the mind. This was a key insight, and confirmationcame by chance when he was contacted by a Swiss neuroscientist, Olaf Blanke, whohad artificially induced OBEs in his patients. Working with aforty-three-year-old woman with epilepsy, Blanke had stimulated a specific areaof her brain with mild electrical current, “and she had the experience offloating upward and looking down at her own body.” This illusion had manyvariations that could be deliberately brought on. Rothman’s New Yorker articleexplains:> Stimulating another location in the brain created the impression of a> doppelgänger standing across the room; stimulating a third created the “sense> of a presence”—the feeling that someone was hovering nearby, just out of> sight.Metzinger found this research hard to interpret, because he was committed as aphilosopher to tracing experience back to the mind, rather than taking the usualscientific approach that all mental events are the products of physical activityin the brain. But he eventually reached a conclusion consistent with the notionof “mental models.” Something like a radical breakthrough occurred. Rothmancontinues:> It isn’t just that we live inside a model of the external world, Metzinger> wrote. We also live inside models of our own bodies, minds, and selves. These> “self-models” don’t always reflect reality, and they can be adjusted in> illogical ways. They can, for example, portray a self that exists outside the> body—an O.B.E.This is a fruitful way to explain why living “inside” the body feels soconvincing—we need it for stability and safety, to feel grounded inside ourpersonal shelter. There are other ways to induce an OBE, such as using the drugketamine, which has mind-altering properties. VR simulation is perhaps the mosteffective, however. For example, with a specific VR setup, Metzinger saw his ownbody standing in front of him with its back to him (this was done by placing acamera behind him and transmitting the image to the VR headset). If someonescratched Metzinger’s back, he felt the sensation happening to the body he sawin front of him—an eerie, distorting feeling. By remaining “inside” your body,you can avert such disorientation.But, at the same time, you are trapped behind the skin of your protective suit.It’s not that an OBE is better than the normal way of inhabiting our bodies, butthat we have seemingly lost the ability to shift from one mental model toanother. This ability can never be entirely lost, however. In a variety ofways—dreaming, fantasizing, denial, willful blindness, and more—we turn ourbacks on the simulation we have agreed to accept most of the time.Virtual reality in any guise—drug-induced, electrically stimulated, or caused byhappenstance—creates images. The fact that the images come in 3-D, as created bythe brain or by VR equipment, doesn’t make them real. Your personal self-modelhas been painstakingly constructed out of images from the past stored in yourmemory. These artifacts of old experiences feel like “you.” It’s not hard torevisit the times in your life when you made major additions to your self-model.For instance, I can see myself in medical school, on the airplane from India toAmerica, sweating out my first days in a New Jersey hospital as I felt thepressure of the workload, a foreign environment, and the guarded acceptance ofAmerican-born doctors. These images pass through the mind as if they werehappening all over again—but they aren’t.Self-models are shared at some levels but not others. There’s enormous room forpersonal variations. You and I can spend a day together seeing the same sights,eating the same food, interacting with the same people. A shared self-modelwould bind us. The Pacific Ocean, a bowl of rice pilaf, and the friends we meetwould be part of experiences we share. But your self-model will absorb andreject, interpret and forget, hold on to and let go of the day in an entirelyunique way. I may love the ragas improvised by a great Indian sitar player,while you experience the music’s microtones as so much garbled noise. If ourspouses join us at the table, you and I will be attached to different peoplewith different relationship histories. And so it goes, moment by moment, as theself-model processes every life experience according to its own designs.WHEN THE ILLUSION CRUMBLESWhat VR technology reveals is that the self-model isn’t limited to onedimension, the visual. We also believe in what we hear, touch, taste, and smell.In effect, you and I were born to mesh perfectly with a wraparound simulation ofreality. But there’s a hidden ability in the human mind that we cannot overlook.This is the ability to disconnect, to stop identifying with the illusion.Pulling a rabbit out of a hat amazes children because they believe what theysee. Once you discover that a hat can have a false bottom, the trick doesn’tchange, but how you relate to it does. There is no illusion for the magician whohas performed the hat-and-rabbit trick hundreds of times. He might feelimpatient and bored, wanting to get the whole act over with so that he can eathis dinner. Once an illusion loses its fascination, it loses everything.The opposite is true, however, when it comes to dismantling the self-model, thewraparound stage set that each of us inhabits. Once you see through thisillusion, life suddenly becomes more fascinating. Such is the testimony ofpeople who had the illusion crumble around them, usually without any warning oreffort on their part. I recently met someone to whom this happened. Nowsixty-eight, Lorin Roche was a broke eighteen-year-old college student at theend of the sixties who agreed to participate in a research project on thephysiological effects of meditation. But as recounted on Roche’s website, whenhe arrived at the lab, he was told that “[h]e was a control subject, andreceived no instructions whatsoever—they paid him to just sit in a totally dark,soundproofed room in the lab for two hours a day for several weeks, and measurehis brain waves. With no instructions, and never having heard of meditation,Lorin just attended to the total silence and darkness, and spontaneously entereda state of intense alertness.”This was a startling and unexpected experience, which he found very absorbingwhile it lasted. A few months later, someone handed Lorin a book of 112meditations based on ancient Sanskrit sutras (sayings or teachings) from India.He was delighted to find that he had spontaneously had some of the experiencesdescribed in these centuries-old texts. For a Western adolescent to have apredilection for meditation is as remarkable as having innate musical talent,but Roche went further. He attended a festival of Bhakti devotees in Joshua TreeNational Park in the California desert. In India, Bhakti is the most popularform of worship, consisting of love, faith, and devotion as the path toenlightenment. The most common daily practice is chanting, which Roche was thereto participate in.But the heat was oppressive, and his energy was starting to wane. As hedescribes the experience, “What sounds good right now is to go jump in a nearbycool salt-water pool. As I get out of hearing range of the festival, I realizethe chanting is still going on inside me. And although it is quieter, thisinternal soundtrack feels powerful. Somehow my atoms are dancing and singing thehymns of praise to the Goddess and the God, Devi and Shiva….It’s the Bollywoodof the atoms.”Today Roche continues to dance in praise of the Goddess and the God, and he haswritten a translation of the 112 Shiva sutras that is considered among the mostecstatic. Here are some samples, all based on merging the ancient text with hisown personal experiences. Shiva is singing to Devi:> Rivers of power flowing everywhere.> > Fields of magnetism relating everything.> > This is your origin. This is your lineage.> > The current of creation is right here,> > Coursing through subtle channels,> > Animating this very form.> > Follow the gentle touch of life,> > Soft as the footprint of an ant,> > As tiny sensations open to vastness.I had an encounter with Lorin Roche while writing this book, and he radiated theblissful state that is the goal of Bhakti—his translation of the sutras istitled The Radiance Sutras. I bought a copy to read on an airplane, and itspersonal authenticity surpasses any other version I know. The “dance of atoms”is real for him:> Power sings as it flows,> > Electrifies the organs of sensing,> > Becomes liquid light,> > Nourishes your entire being.> > Celebrate the boundary> > Where streams join the sea,> > Where body meets infinity.A skeptic would argue that this was such a subjective experience that it has nobearing on reality. The atoms that dance are in Lorin Roche’s imagination, notin a physics lab. The physical world doesn’t feel like a simulation; it feelstotally real, and when we see something fantastic in our imagination, like aflying dragon, we don’t run away to escape the fire it breathes.But this argument misses the point. Everything is mind-made, including fire’sheat and its destructive ability. This only shows how complete the illusion is.Fire-breathing dragons are imaginary and a forest fire isn’t; as part of thesimulation, the physical world operates the way it operates. Fire is hot, ice iscold. Trees burn down, water freezes. The key is identification—once youidentify with the simulation, you are embedded in it. You are part of the wholesetup, playing a passive role. If your involvement changes, so does yourexperience. You have a more flexible role to play. Take something as basic aspain. There is no objective way to measure pain. People experience it verydifferently, and unpredictably.In a typical pain experiment, participants place their hands in ice water andare asked to rate the pain on a scale of 1 to 10 where 10 is excruciating. Eventhough the temperature of the water is the same for everyone, one person willrate the pain a 5 (moderate) and another an 8 or 9 (severe to excruciating). Onthe flip side, if you visit a restaurant kitchen where the pastry chefs boilsugar syrup for candy or frosting, you will observe that many of them can diptheir fingers to test whether the syrup has started to thicken, which occurs atwell over 212°F. (Women, by the way, seem to have a higher pain threshold thanmen.)This result isn’t very surprising, but few of us realize that we are actuallycreating the pain we feel as physically created. As part of the stress response,a rush of adrenaline can block pain, which is why soldiers report that beingshot wasn’t painful under battlefield conditions, and the same occurs if aperson goes into shock. But the total cessation of pain can also occur out ofthe blue, and with it arrives a dramatic shift in consciousness.People who have had this experience typically report a “snap” when the mindcreates its own altered state spontaneously. In the 2017 book Stealing Fire,authors Steven Kotler and Jamie Wheal give the striking example of Mikey Siegel,an MIT-trained engineer who had become burned out with his lucrative job inrobotics and artificial intelligence. He wanted more fulfillment, and Siegelbegan his search by hiking in South American jungles and then visiting ashramsin India, eventually deciding to take up meditation.On a ten-day meditation retreat, Siegel found himself participating in a focusexercise where the object was to sit still and experience sensations in the bodywithout judging them:> But Siegel was overwhelmed by sensations. After a week of cross-legged> meditation, his back ached, his neck throbbed, and his thighs were numb. “It> was an all-consuming pain,” he explains, “and all I was doing was judging.”Moments of extreme experiences, whether pleasant or painful, somehow break thebonds of the conditioned mind, which is trapped in the habit of acceptingphysical limitations at face value. Suddenly there is access to an ecstaticstate, free of conditioning, as was the case for Siegel:> Something inside shifted. The part of his brain that had been judging suddenly> turned off. “It felt like freedom,” [Siegel] explains….“It was the most clear,> present, and aware I had ever been. And if I could be in extreme pain and> still remain peaceful and clear, then I thought maybe other people could do> this, too. In that instant, everything I believed about human potential> shifted.”Siegel wasn’t merely astonished; he didn’t let go of this experience, but ratherchose to follow up on it. He fervently embarked on the project of “engineeringenlightenment,” using meditation as one tool among many. For example, we canaccess calmness by slowing down our heart rate using a wearable biofeedbackdevice. We’ll get to the whole topic of interfacing the mind with devices thatenhance awareness, but there are some basic points to be made here. Pain hasbeen known to suddenly give way to a detached nonjudgmental state, known as“witnessing.” In India, for centuries, sadhus and yogis have undergone tapas, orphysical austerity, as a path to awakening. The stereotype of the bearded yogisitting in a remote Himalayan cave reflects one kind of tapas.Putting stress on the body is found in disciplined Zen Buddhist meditations,where monks get up before dawn, consume green tea and a handful of rice, andthen sit in meditation for hours with head and spine erect. As with Siegel,there will predictably be a “snap” moment, when the mind pops out of itsidentification with pain and the struggle to stop it. But many people are stuckin various ways, and even years of enduring extreme discomfort may not lead tothe desired result.Cessation of pain is powerful evidence that the mind can free itself fromsensations that everyone considers a natural aspect of life. But we mustn’t missthe wider implications, which carry us to the farthest reaches of reality.Trapped in the self-model, which clings to us more tightly than our skin, we cansurrender to it or investigate it. The investigation may be intellectual, theway quantum physics operates. It may use imagination to tease us out of our setways. When Alice goes down the rabbit hole to Wonderland, the everyday world isreshaped by nonsense, which Alice, being a proper English miss, is impatientwith. As Alice watches the Red Queen play croquet using flamingos as mallets orthe Cheshire Cat disappear into thin air until nothing remains but his smile,her sensible protests aren’t the reader’s. We are delighted that Wonderlandisn’t the everyday world.Why do we long for wonder? Because we’ve been there in real life. Wonder existedlong before the self-model took over. As one researcher into the mind-alteringeffects of LSD has concluded, babies don’t need psychedelics because they are“tripping all the time.” Babies take a while to get with the program, so tospeak. They are wide-eyed and delighted with a world that doesn’t have to makesense yet. To learn that fire is hot and winter is freezing, a young child mustconform to everyday reality. Growing up means learning the rules of the road.But once you learn them, the road turns out to be narrow, and crossing thecenter line spells disaster. Deviate from the norm and you might just go mad.Metahuman holds out a third way that is neither as shapeless as the innocence ofbabies nor as rigid as social conformity. We can live in both realities, in astate William Blake called “organized innocence.” Wonder can infuse the everydayworld without dissolving it into a trippy puddle. (The famous Indian spiritualteacher J. Krishnamurti, who had a sardonic sense of humor, liked to say thatbeing timeless and eternal, which is part of waking up, doesn’t mean that youmiss the afternoon train.) The world of the five senses is the organized part.We don’t inhabit a chaotic hallucination. The all-enveloping setup that we areentangled in appears to be complete. It covers everything we can see, hear,touch, taste, and smell.Metareality is the innocent part, where awe and wonder infuse the mind. It’s nota mindless state, but it does go beyond rational thought. No less than AlbertEinstein confirmed this personally:> I sometimes ask myself how it came about that I was the one to develop the> theory of relativity. The reason, I think, is that a normal adult never stops> to think about problems of space and time. These are things which he has> thought about as a child. But my intellectual development was retarded, as a> result of which I began to wonder about space and time only when I had already> grown up.Einstein never lost his sense of wonder and imbued it with a deeply spiritualquality. “My sense of God is my sense of wonder about the universe,” he oncesaid. But it isn’t necessary, as I’ve underscored several times, to couchmetareality in spiritual terms. “Going beyond” is an aspect of consciousness,and it is accessible to everyone.If you ask people how interested they are in investigating reality, not manywill respond enthusiastically. But there’s a gripping story behind how we gotentangled in an illusion. Even more gripping is the possibility of writing a newending to the story, which has us escaping into the domain of wonder, discovery,ecstasy, and freedom.IN YOUR LIFECHANGING YOUR BODY EXPERIENCEYou are living in an interpreted world, and your body is part of theinterpretation. Change the interpretation, and you will experience your body ina new way. When you look at exercise not as a chore, for example, but as a wayof increasing your focus and energy, you have created a new interpretation. Nowthe burn of your muscles on the StairMaster and the windedness you feel afterrunning a mile are positive things, not reasons for distress.It takes a more basic shift of interpretation to stop seeing your body as athing, an object suspended in time and space. Is this a mere interpretation?Yes. When you look in a mirror, what do you see? We are conditioned to see asolid, stable physical object with defined boundaries—in that regard, you couldbe seeing a life-sized mannequin in the mirror. We already know, from discussingthe quantum revolution, that matter only appears solid. When you touch yourforearm with your other hand—go ahead and do this if you like—it seems as if twosolid objects are coming into contact.In reality, you are experiencing two electromagnetic fields coming into contactwith each other, which gives the impression of solidity. For example, twomagnets with opposite poles facing each other create a repellent force. If themagnets are powerful enough, a point will come when you cannot push themtogether until they touch. The repelling force will keep them apart. Therefore,from the magnets’ perspective, the air between them feels solid.The other four senses besides touch also collaborate in the interpreted body.Since photons have no color, the fact that you can see your body ascolorful—brown hair, blue eyes, olive skin—is an optical illusion. So are thedefined outlines of the body. You do not stop at the barrier of your skin. Youtravel in a vaguely shaped aura of moisture and exhaled air, trailing behind youa constant stream of microbes and old skin cells that are being shed (by oneestimate, the dust bunnies that accumulate in a house are 50 percent dead skincells). You are also emitting heat and a very mild electrical charge. Theseemanations have no boundary at all, since they are part of universal fields thatextend to infinity.Nor can you say that you are looking at “my” body, because a questionimmediately arises: Which body do you mean? Your cells are constantly beingexchanged, like bricks flying in and out of a building. The body you see in themirror isn’t the same as it was when you were an infant, or even what it wasyesterday and will be tomorrow. Besides the death of old cells and the birth ofnew ones, atoms and molecules fly in and out by the trillions every hour as yourbody is nurtured and excretes waste.The fact is that your body coheres and looks stable, like a building being heldtogether, not by bricks and mortar, but by its blueprint. In your case, theblueprint leaves a physical footprint as DNA, which serves as the template forall life forms. But, once again, the physicality of DNA is an illusion, a mask.The chemical compounds that constitute DNA are phosphates and sugars, and it isonly the arrangement of them that determines the difference between a banana andthe monkey eating it, or between you and a sea snail. These arrangements arenothing but pure information. Therefore, your body is an information construct,and your bloodstream, teeming with thousands of different chemical messagesflowing from cell to cell, is an information superhighway.Having gotten this far, we have dematerialized your body, and yet there’sanother step to go. What is information? It, too, is a construct. Until thehuman mind named the construct, information had no formal existence, and somehave argued that an information universe could be a kind of quantum soup,swirling, combining, and recombining at every second with lightning speed. Thissoup can be coded any way you wish. A physicist could code it in terms of forcefields like gravity and electromagnetism. But these fields are unified and mergeinto the ground state of everything that exists, vanishing from the visibleuniverse into a formless vacuum.A computer engineer could code the information a different way, as the 0s and 1sof digital programming, but this arrangement of information is only viable fortangible information, like the letters on this page, which you may be readingdigitally right now. The mathematics of anything in the visible universe can becalculated. Your DNA is coded by the mathematics of four base pairs (thymine,adenine, guanine, and cytosine) in a sequence with three billion separate unitsof information. Which brings us full circle, because the base pairs aren’t solidmatter, either. Even mathematics cannot get at what they are. A mathematicallanguage of 0s and 1s is useful for computer technology, but the immaterialaspects of life—intelligence, creativity, emotions, hopes, fears, and so on—haveno mathematical coding. Before Einstein formulated E = mc2, it existed as purecreative potential—a thought not yet thought—and being as yet uncreated, it hadno existence in the physical world or the information world or even themathematical world.THE HUMBLING OF DNAThe notion that life can be explained by understanding the human genome hasprevailed for decades, but in fact your DNA turns out to be a bit player in thelarger scheme. The failure of DNA to explain how life emerged is startling,although the general public hasn’t heard about this very much. This is a perfectexample of how materialistic explanations always fall short, so it’s worthtelling the story in some detail.The accepted story, which everyone learned at school, is that DNA contains the“code of life,” a master blueprint that jumps into action the instant an egg isfertilized in the mother’s womb. From that point on, a human being develops froma single cell to 30 trillion cells as the blueprint unfolds. As powerful as the“code of life” story is, behind the scenes a growing number of geneticists don’tbuy into it; in fact, they think we’ve gotten a lot about genes wrong. Invarious ways the “code of life” has huge holes in it that are growing biggerevery day. This is outlined in an online article in the journal Nautilus titled“It’s the End of the Gene as We Know It.” The author, Ken Richardson, is anexpert in human development, and he gives us a remarkable view of how cellswork, which depends much more on invisible ingredients like intelligence andcreativity than on molecules, even one as complex as human DNA.Richardson’s argument goes as follows: DNA’s purpose is to produce the proteinsthat are the basic building blocks of a cell. But DNA alone does not account forthe many ways that cells, tissues, and organs use these proteins. The notionthat DNA contains the blueprint for the body is basically dead in the water.Recent research has shown that cells are dynamic systems that change theirmakeup “on the hoof,” as Richardson puts it, a process of self-regulation thatbegins almost the moment a sperm fertilizes an ovum.As soon as that one cell forms into a minuscule ball of identical cells,Richardson writes, “[they] are already talking to each other with storms ofchemical signals. Through the statistical patterns within the storms,instructions are, again, created de novo [i.e., from scratch].” It turns outthat totally independent of DNA, a cell is controlling all kinds of informationcontained in amino acids, fats, vitamins, minerals, enzymes, various kinds ofnucleic acids (RNA)—a whole factory of ingredients necessary to keep the cellgoing is not predetermined by our genes at all. This self-regulation impliestremendous intelligence.In the newly emerging view, the cell controls DNA just as much as DNA controlsthe cell. The situation has been like this from the beginning of life on Earth.DNA, it seems, emerged at a late stage of cellular evolution. In their earlieststages, billions of years ago, cells had no DNA but were self-enclosed vats ofmolecular soup. This soup somehow began to regulate itself, giving risegradually over time to permanent structures that were needed on a regular basis,such as proteins, enzymes, and probably RNA, which makes proteins. Theinformation for these structures was then coded as DNA, which serves as a kindof passive database. Richardson notes something else that puts DNA in itsrightful place: “More startling has been the realization that less than5 percent of the genome is used to make proteins at all. Most produce a vastrange of different factors (RNAs) regulating, through the network, how the othergenes are used.”As validation of this new understanding, it is now known that cells can altertheir own DNA—this has emerged in the new field of epigenetics, which exploreshow everyday experience leaves chemical “markers” on a gene, altering how itfunctions. Far from robotically following a fixed blueprint, the life of a cellis highly dynamic and flexible, responding to changing conditions on amicroscopic scale. If this wasn’t so, we couldn’t respond to life on amacroscopic scale.Being human means that we think and act creatively, using our intelligence todevise new ways of meeting all kinds of challenges. DNA didn’t discover fire orinvent the personal computer. The fact that DNA is responsible for themanufacture of proteins is important, but it’s seriously mistaken to expand itsrole to life as a whole. Richardson is particularly worried that wildlyexaggerated assumptions about DNA could lead to social policy that echoes theracism that fueled the eugenic movement decades ago, most notoriously with theNazi ideology of a master race. As a case in point, Nobel laureate James Watson,who co-discovered the structure of DNA in 1953, was recently stripped of all hishonors at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, where he spent much of his scientificcareer, after he continually expressed his bigoted opinion that black people andwomen are less intelligent than others based on their genetics.With the blueprint of life crumbling before our eyes, what next? At present thenew story in genetics is stuck on two factors, information and complexity. Thenotion is that primal “molecular soup” found ways for atoms and molecules toform complicated structures through information exchange and the statisticalpossibilities that arise when zillions of molecules start churning around. Butis that feasible? Can the human brain, for example, be the end product ofswirling soup to which more and more “stuff” is added? As someone wittily putit, the notion that complexity is enough to explain the brain is like sayingthat if you add enough cards to the deck, they will start playing poker.Because science is tied into a materialist explanation for everything, it has anenormous blind spot. A cell biologist cannot make the leap to invisible traitsevery cell displays beyond its chemical structures, namely, intelligence andcreativity. Logical analysis has been science’s most powerful tool, and it’s nosmall accomplishment to replace myth, superstition, and popular opinion withrational facts. Is it really possible, though, that a sudden creative leap comesabout because someone followed the rules of logic? The obvious answer is no,and, as proof, we can offer the amazing imaginative leaps made by the quantumpioneers who uncovered the absolutely illogical quantum domain. More recently,the existence of dark matter and energy revealed another domain, even morepeculiar and illogical than the quantum world, which doesn’t even interact withordinary matter and energy. Your body isn’t a machine governed by logic, whichis why any attempt to turn it into a kind of super-complicated machine is boundto fail. Too much of the information being sent throughout the body, affectingall thirty trillion cells, is generated by emotions, hopes, fears, beliefs,mistakes, and imagination—all the most important things that give richness tohuman existence.Matter and energy behave very peculiarly at the quantum level, to the point thatsolid physical objects are undermined. Every phenomenon in the universe can bereduced to ripples in the quantum field as it interacts with the gravity fieldor the more arcane quark field. On the surface of life, solid objects are justslow-moving ripples compared with, say, photons traveling at the speed of light.Physics can back and fill by pointing out that the human body, like all solidobjects, remains intact despite all the quantum funny business. But your body isintact due to yet another field, the electron field.This reassurance only holds true, however, as long as the information in DNA isintact—with physical death, electromagnetism hasn’t changed, nor have the atomsand molecules that constitute your body. But the process of decay breaks downthe invisible bonds of life. Cells lose the real glue that makes life possible,which isn’t electromagnetism. No one can say with logical certainty why thehuman body doesn’t fly apart into a cloud of atoms that the next breeze willblow away.It’s easy to have your head start to spin when you realize that your body, atbest, is a constant stream of ever-shifting information, but we mustn’t lean onthis as a crutch for keeping the physical world intact. Information, remember,is a human concept, like any other model. To say that we are intact because ofinformation has its limits. It’s not as if 0s and 1s are sticky. They don’t glomon to one another. The way that 0s and 1s get glued together is through humaninterpretation. We know that information exists because we invented the concept.So where did we get this ability to glue the world together and give it meaning?The answer will be persuasive only if we can apply it to our bodies. How did weacquire the ability to hold our bodies together? That ability must lie outsidethe body, because we can’t say that our bodies told us how to live and be andthink. We can’t even claim that our brains told us how to live and be and think.The brain is another physical object, and it would be circular logic to say thata physical object created itself. (In the field of artificial intelligence, thisis like saying that there was a robot that invented robots.)No matter what angle you take, the body vanishes into the realm of concept,mind, and intangible agencies that are its true creator. But concepts, mind, andimmaterial agencies must have a source. Before you can paint the Mona Lisa,there has to be the concept of art. What gave rise to art that isn’t artalready? What gave rise to concepts that isn’t a concept already? The onlypossible answer, as this book argues from many perspectives, is consciousness.There is no other building block that viably explains all the mysteries we’vejust touched on, from creativity to hold cells together, to how inanimate atomsand molecules somehow arranged themselves into living creatures.There is much more to say, yet if you look at your reflection in the mirror, youcan already see that it is only a solid, stable “thing” with defined edgesbecause you interpret it that way. My aim isn’t to plunge you into a state ofconfusion over your body, however. My aim is to free you from allinterpretations that force limitation upon you. Being human can only be definedas limitless. When we impose limitations, we diminish being human. That’s thetruth of metareality, a truth we can inch toward step by step until it becomes aliving reality for as many people as possible, including you and me.* The near-death experience is discussed in detail in my book Life After Death,giving evidence offered by skeptics as well as researchers who support thevalidity of “going into the light.”"},{"pageContent":"2 “I” IS THE CREATOR OF ILLUSIONWhen you see your reflection in the mirror, the fact that you recognize yourselfcomes naturally and seems too basic even to comment on—yet this small act ofself-awareness turns out to have tremendous significance. The self you havelearned to recognize in the mirror is constantly reinforcing all kinds oflimitations that do not need to exist. When William Blake spoke of “mind-forgedmanacles,” he could just as well have said “ego-forged” instead.It’s impossible to remember a time when you didn’t look in the mirror and seeyourself. But there are steps in childhood development that gave you your firstinkling of “I,” your sense of self. Mirrors hold no interest for very younginfants, for example, and, surprisingly enough, walking and talking precede thetime, around eighteen months, when a young child recognizes that he is seeinghis own body in a mirror. After that, it becomes a favorite toy. (The fewanimals that can see themselves in a mirror also become fascinated with theirown image once they catch on.)At the very least, we need to realize that no one lives in the same reality.Everyone’s version is personal. A hundred people viewing a glorious sunset inHawaii are actually seeing a hundred different sunsets. For a person who’sfeeling depressed, there might be no beauty, much less glory, in any sunset.Since “I” is central to every person’s version of reality, it’s a key element inthe simulation we accept as real, and until we can know ourselves beyond “I,”the illusions of virtual reality will keep us in its grip.Illusion is a loaded word. Society disapproves of someone who is under theillusion that nobody else in the world really matters; we call this an inflatedego or solipsism. But the illusion that love conquers all, which everyonebelieves if they happen to become deeply infatuated, is an illusion we’d alllike to believe in all the time—falling out of love, which replaces illusionwith reality, is quite painful. A mix of pleasure and pain characterizes “I.” Onthe pleasurable side, discovering their identity makes little childrenexultantly happy. The “terrible twos” reflect a rampant display of egotism,where the child asserts, “This is me! Pay attention. I am here!”The terrible twos are notorious for being a maddening time for parents, becausethe naked assertion of ego is obnoxious. More important, it’s unrealistic. Youcan’t survive in society if you run around demanding that the world payattention to you all the time, or even most of the time. Adult life is acompromise between getting what you want and going along with social norms,between an all-consuming “I” as the center of the universe and a muted “I”that’s a small cog in the vast machinery of society. The balance isn’t easy tolive with, and countless people fall into the trap of feeling insignificant,while a few are allowed to aggressively impose themselves on the rest.Psychologists spend their careers mending people’s damaged sense of self, but onthe road to metahuman, we must ask a more radical question: Why should “I” existin the first place? It delivers a life of unpredictable pleasure and pain. Itisolates us from the world and limits what we feel, think, say, and do. Howoften are we held back from doing something impulsive because we automaticallythink, “I’m not the kind of person who does X”? That X can be anything frompulling a practical joke to bragging about how much money you earn to runningoff and joining the circus. Every limitation imposed by “I” is actuallypointless. It serves only to uphold old conditioning from the past.When we see that “I” is a mental construct—and a very shaky one at that—itbecomes open to change. We might decide to do without it entirely once “I” nolonger serves its purpose. “I” exists to convince you that you are a creature ofvirtual reality, and that going beyond the simulation isn’t possible, any morethan a portrait can jump out of its frame. The reason we find ourselveshopelessly entangled in an illusion is that we are totally wrapped up in “I” andeverything it stands for.There’s a lot of dismantling to do before “I” stops ruling a person’s life. Fromour first memories of having a self, “I” has been our closest companion, and itspends every waking moment glomming on to desirable experiences and kicking awayundesirable ones. “I” doesn’t want to give up its power, and for good reason.Having one special person love you and only you makes life worthwhile. When “I”fades away, who is there to love and be loved? But there’s much more at stake.Everything a person thinks, feels, says, and does is in service to making “I”stronger, happier, and better. Becoming metahuman cannot succeed unless itoffers something more fulfilling than anything “I” holds out to us.THE EGO’S AGENDAAt first glance, the ego looks indispensable. How can we abandon something weneed to survive? “I” is the reason you feel like you and no one else. You gazeat the world through a pair of eyes no one else possesses. A mother spotting herchild as he comes out of school to be taken home receives the same visualinformation as every other parent waiting in the parking lot, but she literallysees a unique child, her own. Uniqueness is precious, but it comes with a price.Almost none of us is comfortable being totally on our own, and the prospect ofbecoming an outcast is very real if you insist on being yourself. The poetWilliam Wordsworth rhapsodizes, “I wandered lonely as a cloud / That floats onhigh o’er vales and hills,” but very few of us view lonely as a positive. Whensomebody is so selfless that they surrender all personal needs, they’resometimes called saintly. It’s more likely, though, they they’ll be labeledantisocial or mad—it’s hard to believe that someone can be normal and yettotally free of the ego and its need for pleasure and approval. Many spiritualmovements denigrate the ego as a burden, a curse, or a hidden enemy of higherconsciousness.Ironically, calling the ego your enemy is an ego judgment. Calling the ego yourfriend is also an ego judgment. Therefore, to say, “I want to be without ego” isself-contradictory; the ego is saying that, and it certainly doesn’t want tocommit suicide. Your very words cannot get you to a place outside the illusionyou are entangled in. You can’t pluck out the ego like removing an inflamedappendix. If you think you can, you only sink deeper into the illusion byfooling yourself that you are selfless. “I” is a tiny thing, a single letter.But what you have built around it—what everyone has built around it—is like acoral reef made up of minuscule cells hardened over with a massive shell.If this description sounds extreme, consider how you process raw experience.Experiences are interpreted and become part of how you personally accept orreject reality. We don’t witness how this occurs because most experiences seemtoo insignificant to matter. For example, you might taste a vindaloo curry in anIndian restaurant, find it blazing hot, decide you don’t like it, and neverorder it from a restaurant menu again. Someone else, raised in the Indian stateof Goa, where vindaloo is a staple dish, barely registers the heat of thechilies that go into the recipes and instead has nostalgic memories about hismother’s vindaloo.The two experiences, as raw data entering the brain through the sense of taste,appear to be identical. But they aren’t—experience always passes throughsomeone’s personal interpretation. “I” is having every experience, not the fivesenses or the brain. Reducing experience to raw data is totally misleading, asif the eardrum determined which music you like, or brain cells decided that aRembrandt painting was a masterpiece. “I” makes all such decisions, and, as itdoes, every experience makes the power of “I” stronger.Experiences, by nature, are fleeting and momentary. As soon as I finish saying“thank you” or take a bite of chocolate or kiss my grandchild, the experiencehas vanished. Based on this undeniable fact, you have two options. You canaccept how fleeting every experience is, or you can hold on to it. When youchoose the first option, life is a flow of fresh experiences, like a streamconstantly renewed at the source. You are not haunted by bad memories or filledwith anxiety about what might happen next. If you pick the second option, youaccumulate a storehouse of habits, conditioning, likes and dislikes, and acatalog of things you never want to repeat again. The second option is thefoundation of the ego, which holds on tightly to reinforce “I” and its sense ofsecurity. The loss is very great, however, because experiences won’t stopoccurring just because you want them to, and by holding on, you shut out theflow of life.What drives us to hold on instead of letting go? A simple fact of life: “I” hasan agenda. The illusions created by the mind are not random. “I” is in charge ofyour self-interest, and its agenda serves one demand—“More for me.” We shouldn’tbe surprised when “More for me” becomes insatiable, as billionaires crave moremoney and despots more power. The average person cannot relate to suchextremism. But the need for more is powerful in everyone, because everyone hasneeds and desires that want to be fulfilled. We all need security and a sense ofsafety. To need love makes us human. Needing to explore the world is anunstoppable urge in a toddler careening around the house and getting intoeverything.But look deeper, and it becomes clear that “I” is based on need. It ties you toa program of constantly finding new needs that never end, which is the oppositeof fulfillment. Fulfillment is the state of needing nothing because you areenough in yourself. Consumer society promotes neediness as normal—there isalways something new to buy that will at last put a satisfied smile on yourface. Thus, a normal life is actually a life of lack desperately and constantlytrying to fill a black hole that will never be filled. When you are needy,fulfillment is unattainable.Here a very important insight dawns. “I” doesn’t have an agenda. “I” is theagenda. The ego comes with built-in demands, no matter how hard we struggleeither to deny these demands or to fulfill them. Neediness is a state ofawareness, and “I” will never loosen its grip until we find a higher state ofawareness.A MYSTERIOUS BIRTH“I” creates obstacles that keep metareality shut out, as if by a thick wall,even though the wall is invisible. It’s important, in our journey ofself-awareness, to understand why human beings chose to isolate themselves inthis particular way. Was there a time when “I” was weak or didn’t exist? Eventhough ego is now an ingrained part of the human psyche, it has a history. Ithas left clues in physical form, like a trail of footprints in the forest madeby an invisible creature. For example, one sign that you are an individual “I”is that you answer to your name. The first name is lost in prehistory, but thefirst written name belongs to an Egyptian pharaoh, Iry-Hor (the Mouth of Horus)from 3200 BCE.Once you begin to investigate, other clues about the evolution of self-awarenessemerge. Much earlier than written names came the ability to recognize ourreflection. We have no way to re-create what our remote ancestors experienced,naturally. Did prehistoric humans gaze into dark pools of water and recognizetheir reflection? The speculation is that they did, but the event cannot bedated. But the invention of mirrors came along very recently, measured inevolutionary time. Polished stones used as mirrors date to 6000 BCE in what isnow modern-day Turkey, and as ancient civilizations emerged in Egypt, SouthAmerica, and China, whatever could hold a polished surface, from obsidian andcopper to bronze and silver, was employed for this purpose.Are we the only creatures who can see themselves in a mirror? A pet parakeetwill play with its image in a mirror because (we assume) it sees anotherparakeet there. Dogs and cats typically show no interest in mirrors. But, oddlyenough, self-recognition evolved in creatures that have no reason to possessthis ability. Chimpanzees, gorillas, and other great apes do see themselves in amirror. How do we know if a creature actually sees itself in a reflection? Themost telling test is actually quite simple: put a pink hat on the animal’s head.When the animal looks in the mirror and sees the pink hat, does it touch the haton its head or the hat in the mirror? If it touches the hat on its head, itpasses the test of “That’s me I see.”Yet great apes don’t have mirrors in their native habitat, so there seems to beno evolutionary reason for this ability. Likewise, we don’t know why three othercreatures—magpies, elephants, and dolphins—can recognize themselves in a mirror.Magpies use their reflections to preen themselves more, while elephants, oncethey understand how a mirror works, engage in novel new behaviors. For example,they spend an inordinate amount of time examining the inside of their mouths, anarea of the body they couldn’t see without the aid of a mirror. (If this topicfascinates you, go to a YouTube video that shows Asian elephants and how theybehave when confronted with a mirror: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EjukzL-bJc [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EjukzL-bJc].)Mirrors aren’t the only way we recognize ourselves. The oldest artifacts thathint at self-awareness are sculptures that depict humanoid forms. What makesthem so astonishing, according to the most recent archeology, is that suchobjects predate the rise of Homo sapiens. A simplified time line will help us toget our bearings:14 million years agoFirst great apes appear2.5 million years agoThe genus Homo evolves1.9 million years agoHominids evolve into Homo erectus200,000 years agoHomo sapiens appears10,000 years agoEnd of the last Ice AgeBy the time Homo sapiens was becoming a distinct species, around 200,000 yearsago, our closest ancestor, Homo erectus, had long discovered fire andtoolmaking. Nor did hominids wait for our species in order to develop a sense ofself-awareness. In extremely ancient ruins have been found crude humanoidfigures fashioned by Homo erectus. They are astonishingly old. The first to bediscovered was the Venus of Berekhat Ram, a basalt artifact unearthed in 1981 bya team of archeologists from Hebrew University on a dig in the Golan Heightsnear Syria in Israel.The Venus of Berekhat Ram consists of two round shapes, the bigger onesuggesting a body, the smaller one a head. Three incisions can be seen, two oneither side of the “body” standing for arms, one encircling the “head” withoutstanding for any facial feature. Despite the name Venus, this object is soprimitive that at first some experts believed it was an accidental formationmade by natural erosion. The debate over whether these are intentional marksetched by an artist was settled when a closely related figure, the Venus ofTan-Tan, was later discovered in Morocco. The two sculptures resemble each otherso closely that they could have been created by the same hand.Dating the Israeli find was exciting but difficult to pinpoint. The Venus ofBerekhat Ram was sandwiched between two layers of volcanic deposits, one fromaround 230,000 years BCE, the other from 700,000 years BCE. The sculpture wasmade sometime in that vast expanse of time. To the modern eye, the Venus ofTan-Tan from the same Lower Stone Age looks more convincingly human, since ithas a torso, head, and legs. The fact that a mind predating not just Homosapiens but Neanderthals felt the urge to depict its form artistically is a signof self-awareness woven into the very fabric of our existence. The sculptor issaying, “This is what I and my kind look like.” As far back as anyone can tell,there were never humans without self-awareness.“I” hasn’t just survived since prehistory: it metastasized. All around us we seeevidence of malignant selfishness. The grotesque excesses of greed in ourpresent Gilded Age is a symptom of “I” run amok, and we’ve seen how recklessnessin the financial sector can bring about disasters in the global economy withoutthe moneyed culprits bothering to care—or stopping in their pursuit of even morewealth. If it weren’t for the ego’s drive to defeat other egos, to make itselfimportant by denigrating anyone who is different, there would be no need forus-versus-them thinking and the endless conflicts this has created, from familysquabbles to civil wars, religious crusades, and the global atomic threat. Canwe account for this metastasis and come up with a cure?If you lived through the Cold War and the threat of nuclear devastation, youhave seen how “I,” having formed an enemy, will carry enmity to the brink ofmass destruction. Even if the nuclear shadow somehow vanished, nations wouldcontinue to perfect new, more deadly means of mechanized death. It would benefithumankind to reduce the amount of damage we do to ourselves that is directlytraceable to our habit of viewing the world from the ego’s perspective, giventhe needless fear and suffering it has brought.CHOOSING TO BE SEPARATENo one catches pneumonia or even the common cold voluntarily, but when it comesto “I”—whose ill effects reach into every corner of life, we have chosen to beseparate—this is a species trait. We have evolved to feel superior to everyother life form. On the one hand, this gave us a major evolutionary advantage.Consider how we relate to the environment. Every other creature adapts to theenvironment and merges with it. Over billions of years, evolution has createdexquisite mechanisms for adapting to the most inhospitable reaches on theplanet. The interior of Antarctica, for example, contains a specific kind ofmountain known as a “nunatak,” a peak that crops up from the thick surroundingice cap. A more desolate environment would be hard to imagine, with nothing butice fields in all directions, subzero cold, howling winds, and seemingly nofoothold for plants or animals.Yet there are records of a white seabird known as the snow petrel (Pagodromanivea) nesting in nunataks as much as 60 miles inland from the coast, to whichthey must return to skim the water for food. When mating season arrives, snowpetrels find exposed rock crevices for their nests made of small pebbles, and amating couple nurtures a single egg in a frozen wilderness for forty to fiftydays before it hatches. Evolution placed the snow petrel in this situation, buthumans have a choice about where and how to live.These choices weren’t dictated by our physical limitations. Humans haveencroached on the planet’s farthest reaches much more than our hominid ancestorscould physically endure. It is our force of will, an inner drive that isdetermined to bring Nature under control, that impelled us to inhabit all butthe most lifeless environments in terms of extreme heat and cold, scarce foodsupplies, long periods of the year without the sun, high altitude, and so on.When we were still in our naked state, extreme physical hardship did push us tothe edge of survival, nearly extinguishing Homo sapiens almost as soon as ourspecies appeared. It took awareness to overcome the physical odds against us. Asdetailed in a 2016 Scientific American article, titled “When the Sea SavedHumanity,” human survival was touch and go, and most of our ancestors didn’tmake it. The article’s author, Curtis W. Marean, is an archeologist from ArizonaState University, whose team discovered the evidence for this evolutionarycrisis. Marean writes:> At some point between 195,000 and 123,000 years ago, the population size of> Homo sapiens plummeted, thanks to cold, dry climate conditions that left much> of our ancestors’ African homeland uninhabitable. Everyone alive today is> descended from a group of people from a single region who survived this> catastrophe. The southern coast of Africa would have been one of the few spots> where humans could survive during this climate crisis because it harbors an> abundance of shellfish and edible plants.At caves along a section of the South African coast, known as Pinnacle Point,archeologists have found abundant mollusk shells and occasionally remains ofseals and whales, indicating that almost fifty thousand years before previouslyexplored sites, early humans had learned to harvest the sea for food while theharshness of an Ice Age climate caused almost everyone else to succumb. Tools inthe caves suggest that these survivors had high cognitive abilities—Marean makesa strong if controversial case for mental faculties that were totally necessaryfor survival, such as calculating tidal rise and fall by the moon. Only at lowtide, he says, could the inland cave dwellers trek to the sea and undertake thehazardous venture of harvesting mussels and other mollusks against the poundingsurf.Trapped in the direst distress, our ancestors had no avenue of physical rescueor escape. How did they find the means to rescue themselves?EDITING REALITYThe answer is not physical. Fascinating as these archeological discoveries are,it wasn’t harsh external pressure that forced our ancestors to adapt. It took agreat reality shift “in here.” We became a consciousness-based species, usingthe mind to outwit Nature’s challenges. One of the most important factors in theexpansion of human consciousness was that our brains became too big, efficient,and complex for their own good. A kind of brain overload fueled our desperateneed to whittle it down so that daily life would be manageable. If the rush andhubbub of a modern city seem like overload, that’s nothing compared to themental crisis our remote ancestors faced.The problem wasn’t that the human brain simply grew and couldn’t stop. Theproblem was that instinct, which guides how other creatures behave, began todwindle in us. A honeybee seeks only flowers; it instinctually stings anintruder; only the queen bee lays eggs. Human beings have a choice in all threebehaviors. We explore Nature for all manner of food. We fight or keep the peacein different circumstances. We mate according to extremely complex behaviorpatterns. Having been freed from instinct, the choices that face us areliterally infinite. The brain cannot be infinitely large, however. So how canthe human mind fit infinite choice within a finite physiology?This wasn’t a dilemma faced only by our remote ancestors. Every newborn babycomes into a world where too much information is constantly bombarding thehigher brain, a flood of raw data that could never be processed in its totality.Think of searching for your car in a crowded parking lot. To find it, you don’tvisually take in the pavement, sky, people, and every vehicle, still or moving,in your field of vision. Instead, you have a mental image of your car, and, withfocused attention, you edit out everything that’s irrelevant to one task,finding a specific vehicle.This points to another reason we develop an ego. People identify with what theycan do. A car mechanic is different from a concert violinist. A sentence thatbegins with “I am X” can end with all kinds of behaviors, traits, talents, andpreferences. By the same token, a sentence that begins with “I am not Y” canalso end in many ways. As it turns out, the list of things that we choose not tobe is much longer than that of the things we choose to be. If you are aChristian, that’s a single choice that excludes all other religions—at presentcount, there are 4,200 faiths in the world that a person with one faith doesn’thave to think about except in passing. As we exclude countless choices withouteven thinking about them, we are editing reality according to the dictates ofthe individual “I.”This ability to edit raw reality was already present in animals that hunt for aspecific prey, for example, but there was no conscious choosing involved. Whenpenguins and other seabirds that nest in huge colonies come back to shore withtheir crops full of food, they somehow find the one specific fledgling thatbelongs to them in the overwhelming din of noise created by thousands of chicks.The arctic fox can detect the movement of mice underneath several feet of snowin the winter and pounce precisely on its prey. Monarch butterflies can followan exact migration pattern to and from one locale in Mexico where they breed.There’s an enormous mystery about how humans developed focused attention, notfor specific types of food and locales, but as a trait we can turn on and off.The things you’re interested in fascinate you and hold your attention, while thethings you have no interest in escape your notice. The appeal of detectivenovels lies in how cleverly a Sherlock Holmes notices the tiniest, seeminglyirrelevant clue. (Holmes, we are told, was an expert in cigar ash and what kindof tobacco each ash represented, but he didn’t know that the Earth revolvesaround the Sun because that bit of knowledge was useless in the art of crimedetection.)Even though we cannot solve this mystery of paying attention versus tuning out,there’s no doubt that “I” is in charge of both. My wife and children andgrandchildren are objects of deep personal interest to me (the kind of interestwe label as “love”) while they are total strangers to nearly seven billion otherpeople on the planet. Once attention is focused, emotion follows. Growing up, myson Gotham loved the Boston Celtics basketball team and hated the Los AngelesLakers. This became part of who he was, an either/or decision that he identifiedwith.Either/or is the most basic editing tool our minds possess, and it begins with“me or not me.” Ego separates each person from every other person thoughcountless decisions about “me or not me.” Many such decisions have no realpurpose except to reinforce the ego. (It’s not as if Celtics fans are better,smarter, or more well-off than Lakers fans. Yet when Gotham found himself movingto Los Angeles, and his work put him in close contact with the Lakers, it was awrenching change. Turning “not me” into “me” can be very hard. Imagine, forexample, that you had to spend a year working for a political party you’vedisliked all your life.)As the ego metastasized over time, the “other” acquired differences became thebasis of social suspicion and disapproval. Before my children were born, I was anewly arrived immigrant working at a hospital in New Jersey during the doctorshortage caused by the Vietnam War in the 1970s. Every day going to work, I knewin the back of my mind that the American-born doctors in the emergency roomlooked upon me as their inferior because I had come from India.If we stand back and consider the whole picture, “I” edits reality too much andfor selfish reasons. We deliberately close ourselves off from new possibilitiesto suit old, fixed preferences. Everyone’s past is a chaotic collection ofchoices about what they like and dislike, how they feel emotionally, and thememories they carry around as baggage, not to mention their fixed beliefs,family history, and every life-altering experience since birth.You weren’t shaped by what happened to you since birth. You were shaped by whatyou thought about those happenings. The ego and every response it has ever hadis a vast mental construct—the metastasis of “I”—that grew from the seeds of egoin our remote ancestors. Our ability to edit reality is responsible foreverything a human being can decide to pay attention to, and since we payattention to billions of things, reality in its unedited state must be vastlylarger. Human achievements represent a tiny fraction of what reality has tooffer—the horizon spreading before us is unlimited.DECIDING TO LET GOWe’ve been covering what might be called the natural history of “I,” and it hastold us many important things about how the virtual reality we accept as real isactually mind-made. In the human mind, reality is constructed so thatThe available information isn’t overwhelming and chaotic.We feel free to accept or reject any aspect of reality we choose.We seek to repeat the most familiar, safe, and agreeable experiences.We avoid the most threatening, strange, and disagreeable experiences.The ultimate judge of what’s real is the ego, which is highly personal andselective about how we interpret the world.I’m not here to declare that the ego is your enemy, which would be just anotherego judgment. From a neutral standpoint, the ego is limiting. Having chosen totravel through life with “I” as your most intimate companion, you have silentlyagreed to filter, censor, and judge your experiences. That’s the primary use ofconsciousness in most people’s lives, and it’s like using a powerful computerjust for emails. To limit your personal reality shuts you off from the infinitepotential that is the greatest gift of consciousness.At some point “I” edits out too much reality or misses the important things thatcould expand love, compassion, creativity, and evolution. We spend too muchmental energy focusing on things that are damaging and self-defeating. If you’veattended a Thanksgiving gathering where the same tired, vexing family issues arehauled out year after year, you know how stubbornly “I” can cling to petty,irksome things. For creatures trapped by physical evolution, there’s no escape.Cheetahs are the fastest runners on Earth, but their amazing speed has made themsmaller and weaker than other predators. The most vulnerable stage in their lifecycle is at birth, when the cheetah mother is limited in her ability to protecther young. It is estimated that 90 percent of newborn cheetahs do not survive.Added to this is the speed of the gazelles that the cheetah chases as its prey.The gazelle and the cheetah are so closely matched that adult cheetahs oftenfail in pursuit of food and therefore live on the brink of starvation. Trappedby their specific evolutionary adaptation, cheetahs can’t turn to the otherfoods that are all around them—termites or grass or mice—to fend off starvation.Homo sapiens faces the opposite predicament. Our minds open up the field ofinfinite possibilities. Having the ability to bend Nature to our will, we makedeliberate choices that seem beneficial to our survival, but decisions haveunforeseen consequences. Defending themselves with weapons advanced the rise ofearly humans, and a weapon as sophisticated as the bow and arrow appeared asearly as 45,000 BCE. Then weaponry couldn’t be stopped, making the catastropheof the nuclear arms race inevitable. Or was it? Freedom of thought is ournatural state; being trapped by the past isn’t. We are still in that state ofliberation, should we choose to take advantage of it. The pivotal issue is themetastasis of “I,” which has taken free will too far in the service of anger,fear, greed, blind selfishness, and all the rest.Once we see this, we can understand how personal relationships get sabotaged.Two people fall in love and get married. After the honeymoon, they must relateto each other in all kinds of ways—doing household chores, making money,scheduling time for things to do together or apart—and “I” does its job ofmanaging one situation after another. But if you are having a fight over familyfinances, your ego brings up anger, the need to win, and the stubborn desire tobe right. If the argument gets heated enough, grievances over older wranglescome bubbling up to the surface. Unless you are careful, a trivial disagreementgets bitterly personal. What has been lost in the heat of the moment is theunderlying love that sparked the relationship in the first place. That’s thelarger reality, which “I” single-mindedly excludes so that it can win a smalland usually pointless argument.Two people occupy a small dot on the map. Now expand the territory on a globalscale. The human race is ravaging the planet because seven billion people,acting on the advice of “I,” prefer local experience over solving a globalproblem. Wars break out and populations incur death and destruction on a massivescale because the larger territory—maintaining amicable peace—is sabotaged bythe anger generated by every “I” choosing to follow its irrational, angry,hostile agenda.The bottom line is that “I” firmly believes it can manage reality, and yet humanhistory is littered with its abject failures. Even the basic assumption that “I”is in contact with reality is false. At this moment you have no actualexperience of the quantum field, from which everything in creation springs. Youhave no experience of the atoms and molecules that constitute your body, nor ofthe operation of your cells, nor of the brain itself. It seems strange that thehuman brain has no idea of its very existence. Viewing a brain under thesurgeon’s knife or while dissecting a body in medical school is merely thesecondhand observation of a mushy gray thing with grooves running across itsouter surface. Nothing observable hints that this mushy stuff processesconsciousness.At bottom, “I” polices our experience to make sure that life remains local andnot infinite. Infinity is the ego’s enemy, because infinity is the whole map,not just dots and pins stuck in it here and there. To let go of “I” is toembrace infinity. Only by being comfortable with our infinite potential can wediscover that reality doesn’t need editing. Wholeness is where we belong. Oncewe begin to chop wholeness into bits and pieces, the ego takes over to manageeach one, bit by bit, and, whether we realize it or not, it depletes usphysically and mentally. So we need to investigate whether infinity is a livableenvironment. If it is, then letting go of the ego can be justified. And nomatter what “I” has done to improve life, we may begin to realize that living inwholeness is better."},{"pageContent":"3 HUMAN POTENTIAL IS INFINITEHuman potential is infinite because consciousness has no boundaries. Being humanmeans that anything can happen. For the moment let’s explore the inner world ofpossibilities. There are ways in which outer reality is much more malleablethrough consciousness than anyone supposes. Since consciousness is thefoundation of reality, we shouldn’t set down any absolute limits. In order tofly, human beings didn’t sprout wings, but we did find a path to achieve what weenvisioned. Keep in mind that a path will always be open, no matter howfar-fetched our aspirations.In the inner domain of consciousness, the possibilities for new thoughts,insights, and discoveries is already unlimited. This alone makes it important tosee Homo sapiens as a consciousness-based species. Infinite possibilities arepart of our makeup. But something inside us resists believing in infinity as ahuman quality. Edited reality feels more comfortable. There are extraordinaryevents, however, that prove, quite literally, the reality of the notion“Anything can happen.” Sudden leaps in consciousness are occurring all around usif we only take the time to look. But “Anything can happen” could describe atotally random universe filled with quantum noise. In quantum theory, everythingbubbles up in “quantum foam” before form and structure begin to appear, ratherlike formless cake batter until the cake is baked and acquires a solid shape.Because quantum particles wink in and out of existence, according to the laws ofprobability, there is an infinitesimal chance that a physical object—a leaf, achair, or a sperm whale—could suddenly appear out of the blue. Physics exists totell us exactly how nearly impossible such an event actually is.You might think that these matters are so abstract that they have nothing to dowith you personally. When quantum physics asserts that the chance of yourdriveway being blocked by a giant squid is very, very tiny, you aren’t learninganything new. We participate in the world “out there” the way society taught usto. But this is a radically short-sighted view of reality. Our participation inthe world actually begins at the quantum level. For all practical purposes, thisis where mind and matter meet. Both exist as possibilities, ready to emerge intomanifestation but still invisible.Therefore, mind and matter are more malleable there, just as soft clay is moremalleable than a china plate or figurine after it has been shaped, fired, andglazed. Being human, we can consciously return to the quantum level, whichexpands our participation infinitely compared with what we can do once creationhas hardened into place. Not only is creation softer, so to speak, but mind andmatter haven’t separated yet. When they do, a rock won’t instantly become a rockwhile a thought goes another way and instantly becomes a thought. Mind andmatter first emerge exactly alike, as invisible ripples in the quantum field.These ripples will form patterns as they run into ripples from the gravityfield, the quark field, the electron field, and a few others. Interferencepatterns, which are like the rippled imprint of waves left on a sandy beach, getset up, and only then do recognizable objects such as quarks and electrons beginto appear.Physics has done a brilliant job tracing creation back this far. It has donevery little, however, to trace the mind back to its source—we’ll have a lot moreto say about that. But the upshot is that the average person assumes that mindand matter are naturally separate. That’s how the illusion confuses us. Thinkingabout an apple is very different from holding a physical apple. Yet at a deeperlevel the thought and the apple were once the same. They begin as possibilitiesin the domain that physics calls virtual reality. The mystery revolves aroundhow two things that are so unalike could have come from the same seed.To take advantage of infinite potential, you must accept that reality isopen-ended, capable of taking subtle, invisible impulses and turning them intomind and matter. This open-endedness I’m calling metareality, because it liesbeyond mind and matter; metareality is where the entire universe and everythingin it, including all mental activity, is in an embryonic state.I won’t pretend that metareality is easy to embrace when you first learn aboutits existence. How secure can you feel about your life if it is totallyopen-ended? Not very—everyone prefers things to be more settled and orderly thanthat. But when you think about it, a painter contemplating a blank canvas or awriter looking at a blank sheet of paper relies on “Anything can happen” as thebest and highest creative state. When you approach infinite potential asinfinite creative possibilities, there’s an opening to the kind of freedom “I”cannot experience within boundaries.We are so conditioned to say “my” body and “my” mind that we automaticallybelieve they are doing the acting and thinking we experience. But in metarealityconsciousness is doing the acting and thinking. We could—and should—shift intothat perspective for one simple reason. The brain cannot make the leap intohigher consciousness; only consciousness can. A violin string can’t invent newforms of music, but the musical mind can use the violin as its instrument ofphysical expression. In the same way, the bodymind—an understanding that thebody and mind are a single unit—is the physical expression of consciousness.In music there are more possible combinations of notes than atoms in theuniverse, and yet we are comfortable with such vast possibilities. In chess, weplay without anxiety in the face of 400 possible positions after each player hasmade one move, which explodes to over 288 billion after four moves. In everydayways, like playing games, we take infinity for granted. It’s all around us. Evenif you had a limited vocabulary of two thousand words, which is what a typicalfive-year-old has, that’s enough to create an endless string of wordcombinations, not to mention that nothing stops you from giving a common wordmultiple new meanings. (Pet, for example, is already a verb, a noun, and anadjective, as in “I pet my pet cat, who is the only pet I have”—and anyone isfree to assign new meanings to the word. Pet could substitute for coddled,luxurious, endearing, and the like. It already has those connotations. Newmeanings can be invented out of the blue, the way hip and cool have wanderedaway from their literal meanings.)Since we are so used to infinity in these simple guises, we can expand ourcomfort zone to be comfortable with infinity as a personal trait.SUDDEN GENIUS“Anything can happen” is essential to being human. A leap of awareness canhappen unexpectedly, as in the amazing phenomenon known as sudden genius, a termcoined by Darold Treffert, a physician in Wisconsin who has become an expert in“exceptional brain performance.” He defines sudden genius as a “spontaneousepiphany-like moment where the rules and intricacies of music, art, ormathematics, for example, are experienced and revealed, producing almostinstantaneous giftedness.”Of the fourteen cases Treffert has studied to date, a striking example is atwenty-eight-year-old Israeli-born man he calls “K.A.” As a performer, K.A.could casually pick out popular tunes on the piano one note at a time. One dayhe was in a shopping mall that had a piano on display. To quote his account ofthe next moment, “I suddenly realized what the major scale and minor scale were,what their chords were and where to put my fingers in order to play certainparts of the scale.” Without prior knowledge or ability, K.A. suddenly just knewhow musical harmony worked. He verified this by searching for music theory onthe internet, and, to his amazement, “[m]ost of what they had to teach I alreadyknew.” He was left baffled by how he could know a subject he had never studied.Such a phenomenon strongly supports a central feature of metareality—that humanbeings are already connected to infinite possibilities.We are kept from our hidden potential for all kinds of reasons—we’ve just seenhow the ego edits and limits reality, for instance. Even when we are confrontedby evidence to the contrary, the power of limitation prompts us to greet it withskepticism or overlook it entirely. The very fact that Treffert could get hisobservations on sudden genius published in Scientific American (July 25, 2018)is owed to a larger mystery, known as savant syndrome, which has awell-established history in medical and psychological practice.Savant syndrome also deals with extraordinary abilities that defy explanation.There were already two different forms of this condition that Treffert is alsoan expert on. In “congenital savant syndrome,” the extraordinary ability appearsearly in life. There are children who can tell you the day of the week that anydate, past or future, falls on—so-called calendar savants—and others who canmentally generate prime numbers with the speed and accuracy of a computer. (Aprime number is a numeral that is divisible only by 1 and itself. The sequencebegins easily with 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11. But soon it becomes much harder to knowthe next number in the sequence without a calculator to help. For instance,7,727 and 7,741 are both prime numbers, but none of the numbers in between themare.)The other form is “acquired savant syndrome,” where an ordinary person suddenlyhas astonishing abilities after a head injury, stroke, or other central nervoussystem incident. To these two versions Treffert has added “sudden savantsyndrome” as a third type, as in K.A.’s story. None can be scientificallyexplained. In the congenital form, the child is often on the spectrum of autismor mental retardation. (In his celebrated 1985 book, The Man Who Mistook HisWife for a Hat, the neurologist Oliver Sacks recounts stories of “other-brained”people, including incidents of people with right-brain injury and autisticchildren who have extraordinary mathematical abilities.)Savant syndrome had a somewhat alien reputation when it was confined to autismand brain injuries, but once sudden genius occurred in seemingly normal people,it came much closer to home. Treffert titled his article “Brain Gain: A PersonCan Instantly Blossom into a Savant—and No One Knows Why.” To a science-mindedreader, brain is the most significant word in the title, because the standardexplanation for all mental phenomena in our day is brain-centered. But it’s notreasonable to say that a brain suddenly learned how music theory works withoutany external input, education, or training. (It’s rather like saying that thebrain knows all the cities in the world without ever having seen a map.) Peoplewho acquire sudden artistic ability typically become obsessed with painting andcan hardly pull themselves away to do anything else. This is reminiscent ofPicasso, who was obsessed with painting from early childhood, but it would behard to imagine that people who had little or no interest in art becamefascinated with making paintings overnight because their brain told them to.For most people, art, music, and math are not critical aspects of life, and withonly fourteen cases of sudden genius on record, so far at least, this strangephenomenon seems fairly exotic. But it turns out that sudden genius is yetanother clue to the mystery of what it means to be human, and the clue has to dowith infinity itself.RELATING TO INFINITYIf someone has little or no interest in music and suddenly knows music theorywithout studying it, where did the knowledge come from? It wasn’t sent through ateacher or textbook, which is the normal way of gaining knowledge. Somehow itwas downloaded, we might say, from a source “out there” somewhere. But where?Music is a human creation—there are no chords or sonatas or symphonies inNature. Nor is there an invisible library “out there,” where all the informationabout music is stored. Besides, even if such a library existed, who would besending people a download when they didn’t want one?We want to keep away from the head-spinning department, and metareality can feelbewildering. Metareality is the storage place for everything that has ever beenthought and ever will be thought. Because infinity is boundless, metarealityalso contains every possible thought. Only recently have scholars of ancientGreece been able to decode the scraps of manuscripts that contain written music,and, with painstaking effort and guesswork, enabled the music to actually beplayed on reed pipes and drums exactly as Socrates might have heard streetmusicians as he wandered around Athens in the fourth century BCE.To bring back ancient music is an act of re-creation. The mind is trying toremember what it never forgot, which sounds strange. That’s not the same asretrieving information. To grasp what’s really at stake, an image from everydaylife might help: the cloud.Anyone who accesses the internet has probably heard, if only vaguely, of thecloud, a place in cyberspace where the world’s sum of information is held. Thecloud has a capacity multiple times larger than the world’s largest libraries.Every email is saved there, every online photo, every transaction at Amazon orsearch on Google. As universal as the cloud has become, few realize that it hasa physical location.Huge data centers have been erected to store all the information that was oncestored on home and business computers. When you snap a photo of anything—asunset, the Grand Canyon, a newborn baby—then crop it, improve the color, andsend it to someone’s smartphone, the image doesn’t actually go from you to theother person without passing first through the cloud. Massive data centers inLoudon County, Virginia, each millions of square feet in size, house the actualcloud.Accessing the cloud is instantaneous in cyberspace, but getting into one ofthese data centers is an arduous process. The core where thousands of powerfulcomputers are located is protected by layers of security. A worker must passthrough a retinal scanner that identifies the person (it even can tell that theperson is alive, not someone contriving to use someone else’s eyeball), thenthrough a “mantrap,” a room where the entry door must lock before the exit doorwill open, then through a squad of armed guards, and all along the way ninedifferent passwords must be presented.The fact that cyberspace is an actual place stands in stark contrast toconsciousness. You don’t go to a destination “out there” to remember the tune toFrank Sinatra’s “Strangers in the Night,” which comes complete with the sound ofhis voice and an image of his face. Metareality stores the whole experience, andwe re-create it whenever we want to. Neuroscience says that we retrieve it fromthe brain, but the phenomenon of sudden genius casts shadows on thatexplanation, since people can retrieve knowledge they never had in the firstplace.To go a step further, being human is creative, so we use consciousness to inventand discover new things. This isn’t the same as re-creating ancient Greek music.But figuring out why some people are creative proves very difficult. Like thecloud, metareality has security measures in place. For a Leonardo da Vinci or aLudwig van Beethoven, the riches of creation open easily and copiously. Theseartists are consumed by the creative act. At the other extreme, some people arecompletely shut off from artistic creativity. Creative geniuses, it seems, arehacking into metareality. They relate to its infinite potential far beyond whatwe allow ourselves to do normally.Efforts have been made to make creativity a skill, which sounds promising atfirst. It motivates a far-seeing company like Google or Apple to identify andharness the most creative minds. Let’s go back to the book Stealing Firementioned above. In it Steven Kotler and Jamie Wheal go inside the making of“talent traps” across Silicon Valley. These enterprises, along with therevolution in social media via Facebook and Twitter, got their start throughinnovation, and it’s only natural that, with billions of dollars at theirdisposal, Silicon Valley wants to spur ever more creative ideas—in a high-techenvironment, survival depends on it.These corporations would love to monetize the zone, but “aha” moments are justthat, temporary flashes of insight. Sustaining insight and making innovation away of life comprise the challenge. Stealing Fire describes how Google hascreated a work environment where one important element of creativity—flow—isengineered in ingenious ways.The underlying notion is simple: if you want the mind to flow, make theworkplace flow. Google takes this idea seriously and constantly tweaks itsworkplace so that it feels continuous with life outside work. There are bicyclesfor getting from one part of the campus to another, Wi-Fi on company buses,high-quality organic food, and a loose structure that allows ideas to movefreely, rather than the traditional rigid hierarchy that seals management offfrom workers.But these amenities have had limited success, because flow by itself doesn’tdefine creativity. Kotler and Wheal focus on “altered states,” as they termthem, in which normal habits of mind drop away entirely. Whether induced by LSDor a total immersion tank, by meditation or sacred rituals, one can experienceecstasis, a word derived from Latin roots that mean “outside” and “to stand.” Anecstatic state puts the person outside and beyond the mind’s normal sense ofself. In ecstasy we feel free, unbounded, blissful—and creative. Stealing Fireis essentially about how Silicon Valley seeks to monetize ecstasy.Google encourages meditation for all its workers, for example, which givesaccess to a quieter, more expansive state of awareness. But despite knowingabout the zone, flow, ecstasy, meditation, and witnessing awareness, it turnsout that creativity is elusive. In 2013, searching for the means to solve“wicked” problems, a diverse group of bright minds met for the HackingCreativity project, “the largest meta-analysis of creativity ever conducted.”The guiding idea was that if creativity could be understood, anything would bepossible.To this end more than thirty thousand research papers on creativity wereanalyzed and hundreds of experts were interviewed, “from break dancers andcircus performers to poets and rock stars.” By 2016, two conclusions werereached.First, creativity is essential for solving complex problems—the kinds we oftenface in a fast-paced world. Second, we have very little success in trainingpeople to be more creative. And there’s a pretty simple explanation for thisfailure: we’re trying to train a skill, but what we should be training is astate of mind.Metareality, it turns out, is impossible to hack. Hacking is an intrusion, thecyber equivalent of breaking and entering. Creative people don’t break andenter. What they do is much closer to evolution; something new is coming tolight and taking physical form as a painting or a piece of music. To evolve iscreative—the giraffe’s long neck, the chameleon’s ability to change color, andour own prize possession physically, the opposable thumb and forefinger, are theresult of Nature’s creativity. Working from the field of infinite possibilities,evolution proceeds one step at a time to create a whole creature, the same wayyou and I re-create the whole experience of hearing Sinatra sing “Strangers inthe Night.”Every life form relates to metareality through evolution, tapping into itscreative potential in an orderly, progressive way. The oddest creatures, as theylook to us, aren’t an assemblage of spare parts haphazardly cobbled together.They are expressions of a delicate adaptation that finds a perfect niche foritself apart from thousands of other life forms living in the same environment.Every morning when it wakes up, the giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla) ofCentral and South America is hungry for ants. It is superbly adapted by physicalevolution to seek out its insect prey buried deep underground. The giantanteater’s front paws are equipped with four-inch-long, talon-like claws forripping into an ant or termite colony. It has a two-foot-long, sticky tonguethat it uses to slither around and ensnare the ants, which are then slurped backinto its mouth.One marvels at how specific these adaptations are. Even the giant anteater’sjaws have been reduced to miniature size, since anything larger would be uselessfor burrowing into the narrow passages of anthills and termite colonies. But, atthe same time, no human being would ever choose to be trapped at such anevolutionary dead end. To survive, the giant anteater must consume up to thirtythousand ants a day, and because its diet supplies so little nutrition, theanimal doesn’t have enough energy to do more than sleep for sixteen hours a day.The beloved giant panda is also at a dead end. Although it is a true bear, andone of the earliest to evolve, the panda is badly served by having the wrongintestinal tract, which, unlike other bears’ digestive systems, can only digestbamboo leaves. Why did the giant panda lose, or never gain, a typical bear’sability to eat almost anything? “Why” doesn’t count in evolution. An adaptationoccurs, and either it contributes to a species’ survival or it doesn’t.Homo sapiens has eluded every dead end, including those that other primates raninto. Our nearest relations among living species are the chimpanzee and thegorilla, but we did not descend from them or any other ape, contrary to popularopinion. The last common ancestor between humans and chimpanzees lived aroundthirteen million years ago, according to the best current estimate, leading to agenetic split. One branch of the split evolved into chimps, gorillas,orangutans, and their relations, while the other branch led to our hominidancestors.A chimp is a modern species, and so are we. (Interestingly, the geneticevolution of chimps was two or three times more complex than ours, the result oftwo factors: first, chimps pass on twice as many random mutations from parent tooffspring as human parents do—on average a human baby inherits around seventynew mutations from its parents. Second, there is something in genetics referredto as a “bottleneck,” where not enough new genes are available. Fewer genes leadto fewer mutations, causing a species to remain closed off from new traits.According to genetic analyses, over millions of years chimps ran into threebottlenecks that squeezed their gene pool, while humans ran into only onebottleneck while migrating out of Africa 200,000 years ago. Once out of thebottleneck, our species expanded explosively to cover the globe.)The great reality shift poses a profound mystery that cannot be unraveled byexamining our genes. Even with twice the mutation rate as Homo sapiens,chimpanzees have not gained self-awareness. That’s not the same as lackingintelligence. Primate studies increasingly show that chimpanzees are much closerto human intelligence than was previously thought. According to primatologistFrans de Waal, the idea that only humans can make tools is now “an unsustainableposition. Then we also got the apes-have-no-theory-of-mind claims, which nowhave been seriously weakened. The culture claims, the idea that only humans aregreat at cooperation, and so on—none of [them] really holds up.”Theory of mind is a term from philosophy and psychology about knowing someoneelse’s mental state without being told. A shorthand definition is“mind-reading.” Many dog lovers would swear that their pet knows when the owneris happy, sad, or angry. But proving that any animal understands that it has amind remains controversial. It is fascinating to consider that our commonancestor thirteen million years ago had the hidden potential for traits thatflowered in chimps along one branch of the divide and in humans on the other.But chimps didn’t experience the great reality shift that gave Homo sapiensself-awareness. There are limits to what a chimp can learn and understand. Forexample, if you place a peanut under a yellow cup and no peanut under a red cup,a chimp will quickly learn the difference and always pick the yellow cup. But ifyou present a chimp with two weights and give him a reward if he picks up theone that weighs less, he won’t make the connection and will keep picking up thetwo weights at random. Likewise, if one chimp teaches herself how to unlatch acomplicated box to get at some food, another chimp cannot learn how to solve theproblem simply by watching the first chimp.These differences between us and our closest relatives go only so far. Chimpsand gorillas have a much wider range of possibilities open to them than a giantanteater. But they aren’t remotely close to us in accessing infinitepossibilities. The great reality shift transcends genetics, and no matter howmuch we see ourselves when observing other primates, they don’t see themselvesin us, because they simply can’t. Some evolutionary dead ends lead to lives ascomplex as the ones led by higher primates, but they are dead ends nevertheless.The miracle of being human is that we evolved in multiple dimensions. Everythingabout us—behavior, abstract thinking, curiosity, individual personalities,social networks—exploded beyond any precedents, as if life on Earth rushed intounknown levels of aspiration. A master of three-dimensional chess would bedumbfounded to lay eyes on our game board, which has numerous levels and addsnew ones all the time. But this master wouldn’t be able to see our setup,because it exists and evolves in consciousness. This is such an important pointthat we need to go into it more deeply.AWARENESS IN MULTIPLE DIMENSIONSInfinity can stay in one dimension, or it can exist in several dimensions atonce. You might think of a number like two-thirds spinning out a single stringof digits—0.6666666—to infinity, like a mathematical silkworm spinning anendless thread. That’s an example of infinity occupying one dimension. But flow,like creativity, is a state of awareness that covers multiple dimensions. Aperson is “in the flow” when everything seems to go right, obstacles melt away,and answers come effortlessly. Each aspect occupies its own dimension, yetsomehow they get coordinated when flow is experienced. There is a sense ofcalmness and also the experience of happiness, sometimes to the point ofecstasy. If the flow is powerful enough, it can be all-consuming, giving theimpression that the creative ideas are coming of their own accord, using us as avehicle, the way a playwright uses actors to mouth his words.Flow feels desirable but quite mysterious, since it comes and goes, and somepeople never experience it. The mystery is solved when you realize that flow isthe unobstructed access to metareality. In it we are experiencing wholeness.Puddles don’t flow, but the ocean does. Only wholeness can orchestrate a stateof awareness that embraces multiple dimensions. Our hominid ancestorsundoubtedly became multidimensional long, long ago. There was a mass awakeningthat left its traces in the first known cave paintings. These were only madepossible by a seismic shift in consciousness. The accepted date by scientistsfor the first paintings of animals on cave walls has been moving back furtherand further. The record was long held by Europe, first in a complex of caves inLascaux, France (about 17,000 years ago), then by separate caves in France andRomania (30,000–32,000 years ago), representing a huge leap back in time. Nowthe current record is held by a cave system in Indonesia on the South SulawesiPeninsula, still in use by the native people. Radiocarbon analysis has dated theIndonesian paintings at between 35,000 and 42,000 years ago.Gazing at photos of these prehistoric artifacts (easily found online) is a formof time travel, not physical but mental. At the oldest French site, theChauvet-Pont-d’Arc Cave, which is on a limestone cliff above an ancientriverbed, now dry, the paintings are nothing less than art. Discovered in 1994and soon named a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, the Chauvet Cave features verylarge, very well-preserved animal figures by the hundreds, depicting thirteenspecies. In other Ice Age paintings, the chief subjects are herbivores, likehorses and cattle, but the Chauvet artists added predators, like the cave lion,the panther, the bear, and the hyena.The circumstances behind the art were arduous. The cave walls are deep inside,far from outside light, which means that the painters worked in the dark by thelight of flickering torches. As the light bobbed back and forth, the paintersstill had such a sure hand that the major curves of each specific animal—horns,back, head, and legs—were done in a single stroke, the way an accomplisheddraftsman would do them today. The walls were apparently cleaned and smoothed togive a suitable pale area, a bare canvas, before the actual painting began. Twowoolly rhinoceroses are pictured butting heads, reflecting a desire by theoriginal artist to portray scenes, and many animals are shown in motion, notlike a child’s stick-figure drawings.As you could imagine, the desire to paint a picture isn’t simple and never hasbeen. Are these paintings mystical, ritualistic, or magical? The mental state ofthe artists cannot be conclusively determined. There is beauty in how theanimals were drawn, or are we simply imposing “beauty” from our own familiarconcepts? Whatever cave painters had in mind, it went viral, so to speak. Thesame images are repeated by cultures thousands of miles apart.A smaller mystery within the larger one is why the cave painters didn’t depictthemselves. At Chauvet thirty thousand years ago, the painters portrayed no fullhuman figures and only one partial figure (the lower half of a female body, withprominent sexual organs), but there are numerous outlines of human handsimprinted on the wall. These were done by blowing red ochre pigment aroundsomeone’s hand as it was pressed against the stone. Outlines of hands alsoappear in the Indonesian caves thousands of years earlier, then in Argentinabetween nine thousand and thirteen thousand years ago, and in petroglyphs of theAnasazi, or ancient ones, of the Southwest of the United States. These scatteredhandprints lead to no definite conclusion. Perhaps they mark tribal allegiances,or simply the message I was here.The explosion of sophisticated art, on a global scale, testifies to a hiddenpotential coming to life as an awakening in consciousness, vibrant andfull-blown. Art must be considered evolutionary in Homo sapiens, because it haspersisted as a dominant trait of our species in every society without dying out.Yet it seems unlikely that art somehow provided a survival value. Cave paintingtestifies to prehistoric humans’ caring for something beyond physical needs, andthis something emerged directly from their consciousness.To me the Chauvet cave paintings clearly drew on the whole mind. A prehistoricPicasso didn’t step up to the blank canvas of a limestone wall and let fly hisgenius. Homo sapiens evolved much more holistically. At the very least, thedesire to create art involves the following attributes we can all identify with,even if we aren’t artists:CuriosityIntelligencePurposeMotivationDiligenceEye-hand coordinationLearning a skill setThese mental traits have to exist in order to build the Taj Mahal, invent theinternal combustion engine, or paint a woolly rhinoceros on a cave wall. And thewhole collection of traits has to come together into a single intention.Figuring out how this happens may be impossible scientifically. There is no wayto gather evidence when what you are looking for is invisible. Even so, thecapacity to use the whole mind convinces me that our remote ancestors containedthe seeds of metahuman. Being able to access the whole mind destroys the myththat our ancestors were primitive. Their potential was already infinite. A BRAIN TEASEROnce Homo sapiens found a path to whole mind, the experience became embedded inhuman evolution. If we examine ourselves closely, it is clear that we arewhole-mind creatures. Let’s test this proposition with a simple chore likedriving to the grocery store to buy a child’s birthday cake. Behind thesimplicity of the task is a complex of mental activities we take for granted.The ingredients in the mix include the following:Knowing the concept of “birthday cake” and matching the words to a physicalobject.Wanting to do something nice for your child.Putting the cake on your to-do list.Knowing how to drive.Remembering the route to the grocery store.Giving priority to this task over other demands on your time.Selecting one cake out of many, using judgment about which one your child willlike the best.These things span emotion, intention, visual recognition, memory, motorcoordination, and stored skills—for one small errand! Neuroscience can locateand isolate where some of these mental activities are represented in the brain,but how they mesh into a unified outcome—shopping for a birthday cake—cannot beexplained. The process of getting billions of brain cells to fire in sync makesherding cats look simple. It’s more like wrangling every cat in the world.Even less can anyone explain how the brain shifts gears without any visibletransition from A to B. One incredibly complicated pattern of brain activityspontaneously shifts to another. Unlike a car, there’s no transmission orgearshift. Imagine that you are reading a novel and forget that there’s a roastin the oven. Absorbed in The Lord of the Rings or Jane Eyre, you suddenly noticethe acrid smell of smoke in the air. Instantly, this simple sensation of smellcauses you to leap into action, and the book is forgotten. Carbon moleculesstimulating receptors for detecting odor throw your brain into a new pattern ofcoordinated action. Relaxation turns to stress in an instant.To say that your brain noticed the burning roast doesn’t explain your reaction.Your brain processed the raw data of smoke particles entering the nasal passage,but it takes a person to notice the smell and give it significance. The samesmell, when applied to charring a steak on the grill in summer, provokes noalarm, even though the physical process taking place in the nose and brain isidentical. Electrochemical activity buzzing around the cortex forms one patternfor the house burning down and another for a barbecue. That’s all aneuroscientist has to work with, and it’s not nearly enough.Even if neuroscience could map every minute area of brain activity, down to thesmallest detail—as is currently being attempted by the National Institutes ofHealth through the federally funded Brain Initiative—consciousness would beundetectable. If the brain is a red herring in regard to a whiff of smoke, itmay be a red herring in lots of other ways as well. Two would-be poets could bewriting a sonnet, causing specific brain activity to light up on an fMRI scan,but nobody would be able to pick out which writer is Shakespeare and which aduffer. Einstein’s brain was autopsied after death to determine if the world’sgreatest genius, as he was popularly tagged, had an unusual brain; he didn’t. OnYouTube, you can find numerous videos of child prodigies playing the piano atthe age of three or four when, according to normal brain development, such acomplex display of muscle coordination shouldn’t be possible. Attaining skill atpiano playing ordinarily takes years or decades to achieve.Having escaped the constraints of physical evolution, Homo sapiens stopped beingpuppets of the brain. Despite every finding revealed by neuroscience—many ofthem fascinating and important—the bottom line is that you rule your brain, notthe other way around. The path to metahuman is a path of self-awareness aboutthis very thing. You can control who you are, even if you think you can’t. Thetrail of clues has led us far along the path. Now we are ready to undertake areality shift even more radical than the mass awakening of our remote ancestors.In the next reality shift, we will define ourselves as beings endowed withinfinite possibilities. Metareality becomes home when everyone agrees that webelong there."},{"pageContent":"4 METAREALITY OFFERS ABSOLUTE FREEDOMFreedom is the opposite of feeling trapped. We’ve created virtual reality onsuch a huge scale that people can go about their lives not feeling trapped. But,in truth, the whole setup is a trap. Hamlet was trapped in a dilemma overmurdering the man who murdered his father. Indecision would lead him either tomurder or to suicide—eventually it leads him to both—and at one point Hamletspeaks to his friends Rosencrantz and Guildenstern with all the symptoms ofclinical depression:> I have…lost all my mirth, forgone all custom of exercises, and indeed it goes> so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the earth, seems to me> a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy, the air—look you, this brave> o’er-hanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted with golden fire—why, it> appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapors.No actual person burdened by depression speaks so beautifully, no doubt, butHamlet still harbors the great optimism about human potential that fueled theRenaissance. Immediately he adds:> What a piece of work is a man! How noble in reason, how infinite in faculty!> In form and moving how express and admirable! In action how like an angel, in> apprehension how like a god! The beauty of the world! The paragon of animals!Four hundred years later, we are the same species, but optimism has become astruggle. Looking around, would you agree with Shakespeare’s praise of humanbeings as “The beauty of the world! The paragon of animals!”? I’ve been arguingthat Homo sapiens is the only species on Earth that is multidimensional. Thisseems like the greatest possible gift any life form could receive. It gave ourminds an open ticket to imagine anything we want. It saved us from theevolutionary dead end that befell the giant anteater, the panda, and every othercreature that is trapped by physical evolution. It is easy to become intoxicatedby the prospect of our own boundless potential.So it is strange but true that human beings don’t accept this gift of unlimitedpotential. We are starkly divided—one side of human nature craving freedom, theother side deeply fearing it. By freedom I mean much more than not being inprison or under the thumb of the powerful. Freedom is boundless awareness, thevery definition of metahuman. When anything is possible, we are most ourselves.When only some things are possible, we are all too human.Freedom has no fixed rules. It is without walls, and any thought is permissible.No matter how good your life is, you are not living in freedom, unfortunately.You were born into a reality hemmed in by rules, walls, and thoughts you are notsupposed to think. In these pages we have been dealing in forbidden thoughts,the kind that undermine virtual reality and expose its illusions. Why? To builda new reality based on freedom. The ultimate forbidden thought is “None of thisis real.” It wipes the slate clean of all illusions. What makes such a thoughtforbidden isn’t that the police will knock on your door and punish you forbreaking the law. No one will even know it if you opt out of virtual reality.What makes it forbidden to think “None of this is real” is something personal:the fear of what comes next. Absolute freedom is terrifying. It expands theunknown as far as the eye can see. That’s the main reason that human historyisn’t about absolute freedom; it is about testing the next boundary, and thenmoving beyond it to test a new boundary. From the perspective of metareality,Homo sapiens has never needed to respect so many boundaries. A history of “thoushalt not” has unfolded with so much fear behind it, and such powerfulenforcement of the rules, that our evolution has had to struggle every step ofthe way.The root cause of living inside boundaries is the divided self. We have definedhuman nature simultaneously as something to celebrate and something to fear.Getting beyond the divided self is crucial, because, like every part of virtualreality, the divided self has no validity other than what we give it. The warbetween good and evil, light and darkness, creation and destruction, is a mentalconstruct. It was born out of our deep confusion over who we are. When a specieshas an open ticket in terms of its future evolution, the destination printed onthe ticket is Everywhere. Homo sapiens still holds this open ticket in hand, butwe plot the course of history by ups and downs, progress and setbacks, tyrantsand liberators, war and peace. Every day we force reality to fit the model ofthe divided self.Testing boundaries is a stage of development. Every child tests the rules laiddown by his parents and grows up with an inner map of dos and don’ts that, forthe most part, lasts for life. But it would be far better if our inner mapshowed us how to use our ticket to Everywhere. Fortunately, metareality getscloser the more we realize who we are. It has been getting closer for tens ofthousands of years. To see the invisible evolution of consciousness requires usto look at our species with new eyes.THE ICEMAN’S TALEAlthough we have no exact date for it, human beings couldn’t explore multipledimensions until they became aware that this was possible. Prehistoric humansmade that breakthrough and, like the other invisible things in our past, we canread the minds of our remote ancestors by investigating a handful of physicalclues. What these clues reveal is fascinating. While warring between thedarkness and the light inside us, we were also expanding into freedom.Limitation pulled us one way, freedom the other. This tug-of-war will take someexplaining.In 1991 some hikers chanced upon a natural mummy preserved in glacial ice at analtitude of approximately 10,000 feet on the side of an Alp on theAustrian-Italian border. Named Ötzi by anthropologists (after the mountains hewas discovered in) and “the Iceman” in the popular press, this male from3500 BCE is a frozen snapshot of life in Europe during the Chalcolithic Period,also known as the Copper Age—chalcolithic is derived from the Greek word forcopper. By this time prehistoric humans had discovered how to smelt copper ore,but had yet to mix it with tin to form bronze, a harder metal.If you were hiking the South Tyrol Mountains and met the Iceman two hours beforehis death, you’d have seen a thin, almost malnourished male about five feet, twoinches in height, perhaps on a hunting trip, sitting on a rock and having ameal. He was carrying bread made of wheat and barley; there were also fruits androots in his supplies, and the dried meat of chamois, red deer, and ibex. If hesmiled at you, Ötzi would have shown teeth riddled with cavities, probablybecause his diet was high in carbohydrates.The mummified Ötzi’s exposed skin displays numerous tattoos, sixty-one in all,mostly horizontal lines and crosses, primarily running up and down the spine andbehind the knees. According to the anthropologists who studied his remains, hehad been sick three times in the previous six months before he died. For aforty-five-year-old, Ötzi was in bad shape by modern standards, already showingwear and tear in the knees and ankles, and osteoporosis of the spine. (Thetattoos, made from powdered black soot, might have been some form of ancientmedical treatment. There’s an ancestral tradition in every culture of tattooingto relieve pain, and the Iceman’s tattoos are clustered around the joints andlower back, where he would certainly have suffered from chronic pain.) Unlikeothers who settled in agricultural communities, this man took long walks all hislife, which adds to the speculation that he was perhaps a shepherd or a hunter.No other early European has been studied as thoroughly as the Iceman, down tothe contents of his stomach, the minerals in his hair (showing traces of copperand arsenic), and the exact composition of his DNA. His genes reveal that he hadbrown eyes and dark hair, along with a predisposition to heart disease. But mymind goes to the invisible inner journey that Homo sapiens had taken by theCopper Age, strongly hinted at in the physical findings.There had been many awakenings in consciousness to make Ötzi possible. We haveto imagine what these awakenings were like. Agriculture, sewing, the tanning ofhides, the discovery that rocks could be heated until they oozed with puremetal—these are titanic leaps in awareness. The Iceman’s brain was outfitted toperform extremely sophisticated tasks.Keeping thoughts in consecutive order, each leading to its own conclusion, isn’ta modern trait. A highly organized mind made it possible for the Iceman tonavigate a surprisingly complicated existence. We can infer this, for example,from his elaborate costume: shoes, a hat, a belt, leggings, and a loincloth, allfabricated from different leathers. His cape was of woven grass, pointing theway to the intricate weaving that lay ahead as cultures evolved.The Iceman feels very far away from us and yet very close at the same time.However, as members of Homo sapiens, we inhabit the same species ofconsciousness as Ötzi. Some of the strongest evidence of our kinship across thecenturies is tragic. On the day of his death, the Iceman was heavily armed withan ax, fashioned out of 99 percent pure copper, and a flint knife, both craftedwith wooden handles. Over his shoulder was slung a longbow and a quiver filledwith fourteen arrows. Clearly, he met adversaries similarly armed, because anarrowhead had pierced his cloak at the shoulder and lodged itself. The arrowshaft was broken off, probably in an unsuccessful attempt to remove thearrowhead. There was DNA on the body from three other individuals: his friends,his enemies, perhaps someone he killed before he himself was slain?Ötzi was found facedown, suggesting that someone else placed him that way whiletrying to pull the arrow out of his back. But Ötzi quickly bled to death and wascovered by ice from an ice storm almost immediately afterward. It’s not hard toimagine a link from him to familiar emotional states in modern life: tribalwarfare and loyalty, angry attacks and defense, the desire to save a fallencomrade. The war between light and darkness had already become endemic in humansociety.THE LOST SOURCEThe Iceman wasn’t the first person to die by violence. Skeletons of females fromfourteen thousand years ago in Mexico display broken bones and other wounds,indicating that they had suffered physical injuries consistent with abuse,rather than accidents. Somewhere between metareality and human reality, badthings happen. For millennia, the blame has been ascribed to sin or humanfailing in general. I’m ascribing it to the divided self, where peace andviolence were given separate compartments. Projected outward, they becameinstitutions of war—armies, weapons makers, armorers—and institutions ofpeace—law courts, codes of justice, religions that depicted a God of mercy.Societies learned to live with the contradiction. Rome saw itself as the greatharbinger of peace in the world and, yet, in conquering the territories ofmodern-day Spain, Britain, and Germany, Julius Caesar led campaigns ofunspeakable barbarity. In one village he ordered the hands of every adult malecut off; all told, his conquest of Gaul took as many as two million lives. TheRomans celebrated Caesar (offering him the title of emperor before he wasassassinated in the Senate), but a popular saying exposes a deeper truth: Homohomini lupus, “Man is wolf to man.” We have not seemingly evolved past thisbrutal wisdom, since the United States is both a global peacekeeper and theworld’s largest arms dealer.Being trapped in the divided self isn’t the whole story, however. If we examinethe Iceman with new eyes, from the perspective of consciousness, we recognizethat something immense was happening in human history. Anthropologists refer tothe “cognitive explosion” or “intelligence explosion” that hurtled Stone Agehumans forward. One cannot deny the evidence offered by the complexity of theIceman’s tools, weapons, diet, and clothing. It took new and ingenious thinkingfor early humans to arrive at such sophisticated mental activity.To explain the cognitive explosion, various arguments point to the higher brainand genetics, or milestones like the discovery of fire, which brought earlyhumans closer together, making collective thinking possible. As usual,scientists rely on the physical evidence. However, I think the real story liesin the expansion of awareness, which occurred before the physical evidenceappeared. Consider what kind of awareness it took to make the first bow andarrow. Given nothing but a forest and a single sharp stone blade, could youinvent the bow and arrow?A startling series of YouTube videos, titled “Primitive Technology,” shows howit might be done. A single barefoot man in shorts cuts down a small tree byhacking at it with a chunky rock, sharpened on one side into a blade. He splitsthe wood using the same blade until he has a three-foot-long piece that hetapers at each end until it is limber—this is the bow, which gets notched atboth ends to hold the string. The string comes from peeled green bark from asapling. Allowing the sapling bark to dry and twisting it twice, the string isattached to the bow. For arrows, the man uses a thin sapling, and by peelingaway the bark and scraping down the wood, he fashions a long, thin shaft.At this point our primitive craftsman needs feathers to make the arrow flystraight; these are the only artifacts not related to a single stone blade.Using the back feathers of a chicken, the craftsman narrows them down, thensmooths the edges with the tip of a stick heated red hot in a fire. Havingassembled bow and arrow (along with a quiver made of bark to carry the arrows),the craftsman proved the viability of his weapon by firing an arrow into asix-inch tree ten yards away with deadly accuracy.It’s hard to describe how astonishing this process seems when first viewed, but,on reflection, a modern craftsman duplicating the efforts of a hunter over fortythousand years ago is cheating. He already knows what a bow and arrow look likeand what they’re for. The first maker of a bow and arrow worked with pureingenuity and a sense of discovery. What did it take to invent the first bow andarrow? It took expanded awareness, and, in particular, it took some features ofawareness possessed only by Homo sapiens, as follows: The bow-and-arrow makerhad to conceive of what he wanted to do and then figure out how to do it. He nodoubt experimented and tested various options, just as Thomas Edison testeddifferent substances for the filament of the electric light bulb before he hitupon tungsten. Moreover, as he began to craft his weapon, the bow-and-arrowmaker had to focus his attention and keep his mind on what he was doing. Ifdistracted, he had to remember his task and return to it.Each of these mental faculties—attention, intention, focus, curiosity,diligence—are not thoughts. They are the foundation of thoughts, like invisiblebrick and mortar. Without them, nothing can be fabricated (an alternative namefor our species is Homo faber, man the maker). Learning what consciousness wascapable of lies at the heart of human evolution. The multiple dimensions we grewinto are dimensions in awareness, which aren’t the same as physical dimensionsin space.This is the right place to specify the difference between consciousness andmind. It needn’t be abstract. Mind is the activity of thought. Consciousness isthe field of pure awareness. In an analogy from ancient India, consciousness isthe ocean, mind is the waves that play across the ocean’s surface. Once yougrasp the difference, a radical insight dawns. Mind only came about becauseconsciousness started to move within itself. The field of pure awareness beganto vibrate, and from those vibrations, consciousness acquired the familiarmental attainments that it took to make a bow and arrow (and everything else inthe field of technology for the next forty millennia).Eventually, human beings got lost in the complexity, bewildered and yetfascinated by everything the mind can do. That includes the darker side, for wehave inherited the mind’s capacity to make us violent, afraid, depressed, sad,and conflicted—all the traits of the divided self. Living with the divided selfhas been the source of profound sorrow and sometimes a deep wish to start allover again. There’s a reason that every culture has a myth about a golden age ora lost Garden of Eden. We are disappointed in how we turned out, and the tug ofnostalgia leads us back to a pristine time when we were more innocent andbetter.If we drop the mythic trappings, however, what humans lost was the connection toour source—or pure consciousness. But we have a path back to Eden that isn’tmythical. Somewhere in the evolution of the human mind, at a time unreachablefrom the present, Homo sapiens became self-aware. Was this a momentous shift ora gradual development? No one knows. Early humans started to go beyond everydaythinking, which is largely utilitarian, devoted to the busyness of daily dutiesand demands. Going beyond became solidified, we might say, in God, a superhumanfashioned in our own image. At other times, however, going beyond meantcontemplating the nature of awareness. We can call this the awareness of beingaware. We thereby gained access to our source. Only when you know that you areconscious can you begin to explore where consciousness comes from.SAVED—AND CURSED—BY REASONThroughout history, this search for consciousness has been haphazard andhazardous at the same time. Being human encompasses a culture of nonviolence inBuddhism and early Christianity, but also warrior cultures like the Mongols andthe Vikings. Traits we take for granted, like romantic love, didn’t exist inmany early societies in the Mediterranean Basin, including the Greeks and theEgyptians; chivalry toward women was unknown outside noble circles until therise of courtly knighthood in the Middle Ages. Children were not consideredexemplars of innocence as a matter of course—in medieval Christian doctrine, sinarrived at birth, and under English common law a child was treated as a father’sproperty, or chattel. Human dignity itself was betrayed by the practice ofslavery.What this dismal history indicates, if we look for a common denominator, is thatthe human mind knew itself in fragments, which accumulated into shared storiesbuilt up over time. For example, the first life account of the Buddha, who livedin the sixth century BCE, wasn’t written until around four hundred years afterhis death, and it was very brief, being included in an account of thetwenty-five Buddhas who preceded Gautama Buddha. The first true biography was anepic poem, dating to the second century BCE, written by a monk calledAshvaghosha, under the title of Buddhacarita (Act of the Buddha).Understandably, myths and miracles are interspersed with facts that may bereliable accounts—the important thing was to amass from many fragments a saintlylife suitable for worship and veneration. Likewise, the New Testament comes frommany sources—principally, it is thought, the various early churches scatteredthroughout the Roman Empire—and very big differences crop up between the fourGospels.All the stories that became woven into civilization were created collectively,even when it is traditional to refer to a single author like Homer or a Gospelwriter. The original texts always underwent alterations later. Some storiesbecame inspiring. Others became part of a people’s identity or their way ofworship. Against these positive effects, every story has severely limited ourinfinite potential. Metareality has no story because it is outside time andtherefore outside history. Unlike the mind, which leaves a trail of eventsbehind it that historians can study, consciousness has no beginning or end.At present the dominant story, collectively speaking, is scientific, and oneaspect of the mind is given credit for advancing human evolution: rationalthought. If we pity our forebears for their difficulty in getting pastsuperstition and myth, the future may pity us for glorifying the rational mindand neglecting the whole mind.In his 2018 book, Enlightenment Now, the widely read Harvard psychologist StevenPinker takes 450 pages to fully extol the triumph of reason in recent culturalhistory. Pinker makes “the case for reason, science, humanism, and progress”(the book’s subtitle), much as it would have been made in France during theeighteenth-century Age of Enlightenment. In fact, he looks to that period as theturning point in Western civilization.For the vast majority of people in the West, Pinker is preaching to the choirwhen he characterizes enlightenment as secular, free-thinking, rational, anddedicated to progress. I know this in my role as an MD trained in scientificmedicine. Rationality has few greater triumphs, and the rise of modern medicinewas part of a much larger campaign to wipe out the scourge of ignorantsuperstition.As a prime example, no one in the fourteenth century had a rational explanationfor the horrors of the Black Death, which killed perhaps a third of Europe’spopulation, around twenty million people, between 1347 and 1352. Supernaturalexplanations became widespread, and there was a rash of persecutions of Jews andwitches. Three centuries later, you would think society would have learned itslessons and realized how superstitious they had been. No such luck. When WilliamHarvey in the seventeenth century scientifically confirmed that the heart pumpedblood to every part of the body and back again, many still believed in witches.It is estimated that more were executed in the century after Shakespeare’s deathin 1616 than in the previous century.Harvey himself visited women suspected of witchcraft and became a prominent andskeptical opponent of such superstitious thinking. In one of these visits, hetook a toad, which one woman thought was her familiar sent by the Devil, anddissected it before her eyes to prove that nothing supernatural existed in thecreature.Pinker praises the rise of enlightened reason with fervor and confidence:> What is enlightenment? In a 1784 essay with that question as its title,> Immanuel Kant answered that it consists of “humankind’s emergence from its> self-incurred immaturity,” its “lazy and cowardly” submission to “dogmas and> formulas” of religious or political authority. Enlightenment’s motto, he> proclaimed, is “Dare to understand!”This is such a widely accepted view of enlightenment that there’s little that’sdaring about it. A secular, scientific culture not only takes pride inrationality, it worships rationality with a faith as absolute as the religiousdogmas Kant wanted humanity to escape. What would be daring is to find a way toescape the unfounded exaltation of reason. For rationality has wreaked as muchhavoc as unreason—medieval monks, wedded to the “lazy and cowardly” dogmas ofCatholicism, as Pinker describes them, didn’t drop the atomic bomb, inventchemical warfare and biological weapons, or despoil the environment to the pointof humanity’s self-destruction.Reason has certainly created many good things, but in Pandora’s box there wasdiabolical creativity, too. When freedom of thought became widespread, there wasnothing to stop diabolical creativity from devising newer means of mechanizeddeath, which has proceeded apace since the Roman catapult and the crossbow inthe Middle Ages. Reason hasn’t been able to curb its own creations, pursued inevery case with the backing of rational explanations for why horrific weaponswere necessary to develop.Bypassing this fatal flaw, Pinker’s optimism paints a picture of progress onmany fronts. The core of Enlightenment Now is a set of seventy-five chartsillustrating the advance of humankind up to this moment in history, counteringthe popular notion that the world is falling apart. The range of topicsillustrated by these charts covers everything from the tone of the news peopleread, life expectancy, and child mortality to malnourishment and famine deaths;from Gross World Product and global income distribution to American leisure timeand the cost of jet travel.It’s an impressive summing up of what rationality and progress have achieved.But Pinker’s overview leaves consciousness for very late in the game. The wordis barely present in the book, and the main references, beginning on page 425,are skeptical and debunking. He raises the issue of the “hard problem,” a phrasecoined by philosopher David Chalmers, which poses the riddle of why human beingshave subjectivity—in other words, the world “in here.”True to his faith in reason, logic, and science, Pinker says that what goes onin the subjective domain (i.e., thoughts, sensations, images, and emotions),along with the behavior we exhibit based on subjective events, are “obviousDarwinian adaptations. With advances in evolutionary psychology more and more ofour conscious experiences are being explained in this way, including ourintellectual obsessions, moral emotions, and aesthetic reactions.”In other words, the mind can be logically explained—or explained away—by thesame Darwinian drive that shaped every living creature: survival of the fittest.The possibility that Homo sapiens is a consciousness-based species isn’t touchedon, and one imagines Pinker would laugh it away. He isn’t someone I want tosingle out for special criticism—Pinker’s argument is part of a much largertrend in science—but saying that humankind feels the difference between rightand wrong (a moral emotion), craves the truth (an intellectual obsession), andloves beauty (an aesthetic reaction) because those things were survival traitsis seriously misguided. By refusing even to take consciousness seriously, Pinkerreturns us to being higher mammals who happened to become conscious in order toget an advantage in finding food and gaining mating rights.Some pure Darwinians stop there, but Pinker realizes that consciousness needs aslightly more credible explanation, because the hard problem doesn’t ask howhumans became conscious; it asks what consciousness is. Again not singlingPinker out for blame, he joins many other “apostles of scientism,” as one of hiscritics called them, by saying two things: (1) Consciousness is probably anillusion created by complex brain activity, and (2) the whole issue is basicallyirrelevant.*To hold that the entire subjective world is an illusion shows how blind thedogma of rationality has become. Citing the philosopher Daniel Dennett, one ofthe strongest consciousness deniers, Pinker is impressed by Dennett’s view that“there is no hard problem of consciousness: it is a confusion arising from thebad habit of a homunculus seated in a theater inside the skull. This is thedisembodied experiencer.” The word homunculus means a small human being, and ithas various meanings in science and philosophy. Supporters of the view thatconsciousness is an illusion like to say that people mistakenly believe there isa “little me,” or an individual self, inside us. Dennett dismisses the self asan illusory artifact of the whirling, teeming brain. Pinker can’t bring himselfto go that far, but many neuroscientists do. In a sense they must, because ifthe brain creates the mind, then the notion of the self can’t be anything butanother product of brain activity. If every self is a delusion, then why shouldwe believe a scientist (i.e., a self) when he tries to debunk the self? Wouldn’twe be taking the word of an illusion? The whole argument is hopelesslyillogical.BEHIND THE MASKMany people consider science a liberating force, and it is. But it has alsoserved to block the way to the absolute freedom that metahuman holds out.Claiming that consciousness is an illusion or irrelevant or just Darwinianevolution at work in the brain shows how far working scientists of integrity andintelligence are willing to go to adopt the role of deniers. The deepest ironyis that quantum physics, which peered behind the mask of the physical world acentury ago, gave rise to generations of physicists who feel that consciousnessisn’t worth bothering about.There have been moments of going back to the future, though. The eminentRussian-American physicist Andrej Linde made important contributions to“inflation theory,” which deals with the first stages of the infant universewhen it was smaller than the period at the end of a sentence. Later on, hebecame an early supporter of the “multiverse,” which posits that there areinnumerable other universes beyond ours—the current estimate runs to 10500different universes, or 10 followed by 500 zeroes.In a 1998 paper titled, with characteristically sweeping ambition, “Universe,Life, Consciousness,” Linde not so subtly sabotages the accepted worldview ofmodern physics. “According to standard materialistic doctrine,” he asserts,“consciousness…plays a secondary, subservient role, being considered just afunction of matter and a tool for the description of the truly existing materialworld.”One envisions heads nodding in the audience as Linde says this, with no hint ofthe contrarian thinking that is to come. He continues:> But let us remember that our knowledge of the world begins not with matter but> with perceptions. I know for sure that my pain exists, my “green” exists, and> my “sweet” exists. I do not need any proof of their existence, because these> events are a part of me; everything else is a theory.This last statement, “everything else is a theory,” indicates that somethingstrange is afoot, and the radical nature of that something begins to build.Linde notes that in the scientific model, perceptions are subject to the laws ofNature, like everything else in the universe:> This model of [a] material world obeying laws of physics is so successful that> soon we forget about our starting point and say that matter is the only> reality, and perceptions are only helpful for its description….But in fact we> are substituting [the] reality of our feelings by a successfully working> theory of an independently existing material world.Linde’s audience was probably squirming by this point, because he had spottedthat the world “out there” is a substitute for perceptions, which rightfullyshould be considered the starting point for any model of reality. After all, ashe declares, science isn’t needed to prove that green is green and sweet issweet. It can’t offer such proof; only subjective experience validates the mostbasic perceptions.Only perception, without a doubt, is real. In other words, Linde was turning thetables on a worldview that puts matter first and consciousness second. He goeson, “And the [materialistic] theory is so successful that we almost never thinkabout its limitations until we must address some really deep issues, which donot fit into our model of reality.”Linde’s version of a deep issue would focus on the precise nature of howcreation came about in terms of big bangs, other universes, subatomic particles,and so on. But when he speculates that consciousness is unavoidable in reachingan answer—a realization the quantum pioneers had reached long ago—this is likelyto be a bridge too far. Science today is at its most materialistic, thanks tothe surging success of technology. Linde breaks ranks, but he still remainslocked in the technicalities of a professional physicist. Yet he has joinedStephen Hawking and others in realizing that science, however advanced, does notdescribe reality. Linde goes even further. To quote from an online article,“Consciousness and the New Paradigm,” by Adrian David Nelson,> Linde…has urged his colleagues to remain open-minded toward a fundamental> place for consciousness in quantum mechanics. “Avoiding the concept of> consciousness in quantum cosmology,” he warns, “may lead to an artificial> narrowing of our outlook.”If you unpack Linde’s seemingly mild warning, he’s implying that the universecannot exist without consciousness. Nelson goes on,> Linde is also one of several respected physicists who’ve pointed out that the> quantum wave function of the entire universe could not evolve in time without> the introduction of a relative observer.In a word, the universe since the big bang could not have expanded, leading inone small corner to life on Earth, without someone to see it happen (the“relative observer”). So who is this mystery observer? The religious will sayGod, but in scientific terms there are only two possibilities: an infinitecosmic consciousness or we humans. In fact, both possibilities merge into one.The universe exists only as humans experience it, and our ability to experienceit comes from infinite or cosmic consciousness. This merging occurs because thesource of consciousness, cosmic and individual, is within us.I’ve taken this time to venture into some very abstract concepts. Rationalityhas built a world of its own. In advanced societies the average person cannotenter this world without extensive specialized training. But there is a humanside to all of this. A worldview that leaves the average person out in the coldmakes for a very lonely existence. The newest iPhone isn’t a hug. Einsteinhumanized the isolation of modern life in one of his most powerful quotes. Ahuman being, Einstein said,> experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the> rest, a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind> of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for> a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this> prison…That’s one scientist’s cry for something to unify us, bring comfort, and end thedelusion of lonely isolation. In this book I am only expanding on the samedesire. Virtual reality stands for every mind-made limitation that needs to beundone. As long as we believe in virtual reality, metareality lies beyond ourgrasp. Everything must be done in the name of freedom, which rescues reality andourselves at the same time.* For an extended discussion of the hard problem, see You Are the Universe,coauthored by me and the widely published physicist Menas Kafatos."},{"pageContent":"5 MIND, BODY, BRAIN, AND UNIVERSE ARE MODIFIED CONSCIOUSNESSThe title of this chapter encompasses a new creation story. It begins bypositing that a new story is needed. The old story has sunk in deeply.Schoolchildren have heard of the big bang, which was conceived of in theirgrandparents’ day—the British astronomer Fred Hoyle coined the term in 1949,while the concept of an expanding universe that began with a bang goes back tothe Belgian astronomer Georges Lemaître in 1931. Strange as it seems, the wholequantum revolution basically had no creation story. Einstein and the otherfamous names in his generation accepted that the universe is, was, and alwayshad been.Behind the workings of genius devoted to the radical notions of generalrelativity and the quantum, the “steady state” universe, as it was known, hadn’tadvanced since the days of the ancient Greeks. The Book of Genesis, if viewed acertain way, had one up on modern physics—Genesis and the world’s other creationmyths were based on the belief that everything in the cosmos had to have abeginning. The big bang allowed physics to fall into line with that commonsenseidea, and the current estimate of a universe 13.8 billion years old could beverified, in place of biblical time (which Sir Isaac Newton, a devoutfundamentalist Christian, spent years trying to calculate, so that he wouldestablish a scientific date for the Garden of Eden).A universe that began with a bang satisfied the commonsense mind, but it’s awobbly story once you ask where the big bang came from. An enormous problemblocks the way to finding an answer: logic breaks down when you ask whatpreceded time and space, since nothing can come “before” time or “outside”space. The inability to talk about a domain outside time and space, whichnonetheless made the decision to create time and space, forced physics toretreat into arcane mathematics that doesn’t depend on being able to formpictures or logical statements in the mind. As sci-fi fans know, if you go backin time and kill your grandfather before he got married, suddenly logiccollapses in that instance, too. You cannot be alive (as a result of yourgrandfather having children) and dead (as a result of your grandfather nothaving children) at the same time.A new creation story must get around this enormous, messy collapse of logic.Either it must describe a rock-solid ground zero when creation began, as Genesisdoes, or it must substitute something that doesn’t need a beginning. The secondpath is the one I’ve been taking by grounding the universe in consciousness. Ofall the candidates for an eternal something that has no beginning or end,consciousness is the most viable. In the new creation story, there are no godsor God, no wind-up universe running like a finely tuned watch, and no birthpangs in the big bang. Without them, there isn’t even a story in the usualsense. There is only consciousness doing its thing while Homo sapiens generatescreation stories that attempt to grasp what is ungraspable, to conceive of whatis inconceivable. If God created the world, who created God? If the big banggave rise to time and space, this implies a state of no-time and no-space, whichis ungraspable. You can’t logically ask what happened before time began, since“before” only has meaning within the framework of time. Creation wouldn’t existif we had to explain it with common sense first.But there is a way to get there. Two people can disagree about everything in theworld. One can dislike what the other likes. One can believe in God and theother be a confirmed atheist. But even if person A dedicated his life tocontradicting everything person B said, even if he could get inside person B’smind and contradict every thought he had, on one thing the two antagonists wouldhave to agree: They are conscious beings. If intelligent life from another solarsystem made contact with Earth, no matter what the creatures looked likephysically—mutant humans, walking squid, amoeba-like blobs—they would have to beconscious, too.The deepest mystery about alien intelligence won’t be the technology it hasdeveloped. No doubt an interstellar spaceship or teleportation device or timemachine will be mind-bending in scientific terms. There’s a good chance thatEarthlings could learn amazing things from alien technology. But the deepestmystery will remain unsolved. We will never know what it is like to be them,because their species of consciousness will be impenetrable. Little green aliensmight feel physical pain from touching water; they might inform us that photonsare delicious or that gravity is having a bad day.Even those strange statements assume a lot. Little green aliens might notpossess any of our five senses. As long as they are conscious beings, thereality they inhabit can take any form, because consciousness takes any formalready. The most common butterfly on Earth is the painted lady, whose wings arebrightly patched with orange and whose genealogy is delightfully poetic: thepainted lady belongs to the group of Cynthia butterflies, a subgenus of Vanessabutterflies, which are part of the family Nymphalidae. If these names evoke akind of ethereal mythology, populated by fairy folk, the painted lady’s senseorgans are as mind-bending as any alien’s.Painted ladies can taste the leaf they are standing on with the tips of theirlegs. They smell the air through their antennae and view the world through eyesthat possess thirty thousand lenses. They hear with their wings. Looking fromthe outside, we’d say that evolution has created a reality for the painted ladythat we barely comprehend. If you want to believe in aliens among us, believe inbutterflies. As with visiting aliens, we’ll never experience theirconsciousness.But life is impossible without consciousness, which is another thing in favor ofthe new creation story. Fritjof Capra is an Austrian-born American physicist whogained fame with his 1975 book, The Tao of Physics. It was a landmark in the“new physics” because Capra connected science to ancient wisdom traditions likeTaoism. Evidence from the subjective world, long considered useless in science,suddenly became relevant.Capra has connected life and mind far beyond what biologists currentlyunderstand. A biologist would call the painted lady butterfly mindless. To thecontrary, Capra asserts, “The interactions of a living organism—plant, animal orhuman—with its environment are cognitive interactions. Thus life and cognitionare inseparably connected.” In everyday language, there cannot be life withoutmind. The painted lady’s sense organs are strange from the human standpoint, butit is a conscious creature. There is no other alternative explanation. Capragoes on to say as much: “The process of cognition—or, if you wish, of mind—isimmanent in matter at all levels of life. For the first time, we have ascientific theory that unifies mind, matter, and life.”This sounds exactly like a metahuman declaration. It is human to believe thatonly Homo sapiens is conscious, with a small proviso added to include higherprimates like gorillas and chimpanzees (maybe). It is metahuman to be aware thatconsciousness is universal. If this insight doesn’t cause mental overload, thatmeans its implications haven’t fully sunk in. Consciousness can be described inthree words: everything, always, and everywhere. On their own, each word ismentally unmanageable. If children took seriously that Santa Claus iseverywhere, watching each boy and girl in the world to see if they were naughtyor nice, the idea would be as thorny as a medieval theologian trying to graspGod keeping tabs on every sinner in the world, down to each person’s secretthoughts.There are reassuring ways to get around the dilemma and any possible anxiety.For every idea a human being has ever had, there are infinite ideas yet to come.When I realize this, I feel optimistic—vistas of unlimited creativity open up inmy mind’s eye. But I know I am only using an image; I am not looking at thereality of consciousness directly. There’s a haunting passage in T. S. Eliot’spoem “Burnt Norton” in which a bird summons us to run through a garden gate into“our first world,” only to have the bird warn us back: “Go, go, go, said thebird: human kind / Cannot bear very much reality.”It’s a sweeping and gloomy notion that humans cannot endure a full blast ofreality, as if some kind of overload would blow our fuses. I don’t agree. Ourfirst world isn’t the Garden of Eden, although that’s the metaphor Eliot isusing. Our first world is pure consciousness, which we can call “pure” becauseit doesn’t contain anything. The open space between thoughts doesn’t containanything, either, except the potential for the next thought and the next and thenext. Apparently, a kind of nothing, the gap between thoughts in reality is the“stuff” that a thought is made of. The mind is the play of consciousness once itstarts making things.I’d consider alien life forms to be superior beings only if they comprehended“everything, always, and everywhere.” Short of that, we cannot enter metarealityourselves. The play of consciousness is behind all of creation. I think of thisas “Genesis now,” the constant appearance of newness in every dimension—mind,body, brain, and universe—that gives us the experience of being human.“Everything, always, and everywhere” is the real story of creation. It alonetells us who we are and why we are here. Beyond the narratives provided by anystoryteller, whether they are the rabbis of 1000 BCE compiling the Hebrew Bible,the mythologizers of Homer’s Greece, or modern theorists of a gazillion possibleuniverses, something is making creation happen. This something is here and now.It has no story in the conventional sense. It is content, like a choreographerstanding offstage, to invisibly invent what the dancing universe is doing.THE ULTIMATE FAIL-SAFEConsciousness isn’t playing with the universe. Consciousness is the universe. Itplays at turning into a helium atom or a galaxy. It plays at turning into abrain cell or a heartbeat. Shape-shifting never ceases. When you feel happy orsad, you are experiencing two contrasting modes of consciousness. But since youare also consciousness, and so is your brain, there can be only one conclusion.Creation is consciousness experiencing itself. Like making all the gold jewelryin the world, the forms in creation change, but the gold—the essential “stuff”of creation—remains the same. In humanity’s search for Truth with a capital T,this truth alone qualifies.Is Truth with a capital T exciting, fascinating, or merely mind-boggling? Whenpeople get wind of consciousness, their worldview isn’t shattered. They don’tsit down in amazement as Truth washes over them. In fact, the average personshows complete indifference (in my experience) and dismisses such thoughts fromhis mind. The opportunity to access metareality doesn’t strike people asanything urgent or necessary. I’ve reflected on why this is, and it comes downto a series of fail-safe mechanisms. A fail-safe keeps disasters from shutting asystem down or making the unthinkable happen, as in the accidental launch ofballistic missiles armed with nuclear warheads. There are strong fail-safes toprevent such a catastrophe.In the case of the human mind, the fail-safe protects virtual reality from beingdismantled. Strangely, the mind must be protected from its own infinitepotential. Imagine that you are an art student, and on the first day of classthe instructor outfits your skull with electrodes that will fill your brain withevery painting that has ever existed or ever will. You reluctantly comply, andsuddenly the full reality of art pours into your cranium, from the earliest cavepaintings on, covering thousands of years. Such an experience would beunbearable, in all likelihood, but it would also be useless. You can’t teachbudding artists by showing them every piece of art. It’s like asking for a glassof water and being made to swallow the Great Lakes. In other words, the slowunfolding of the mind in time is a fail-safe. In linear sequence, event A isfollowed by B, which is followed by C.This linear process is not real, however; it is a mechanism installed in humanconsciousness. One can argue as to whether our ancient ancestors installed itearly in prehistory or it was installed by the force of evolution. But there’sno doubt that we consider this mental fail-safe necessary for survival. Onepiece of evidence is how hard it was to convince ordinary people that time isrelative. Even though the concept dates back to Einstein’s theory of specialrelativity in 1905, the notion of time deviating from a straight line in a fixedway seemed unfathomable. As late as twenty or thirty years later, it seemed likea kind of special magic. The British philosopher Bertrand Russell, who wrote asmall book titled The ABC of Relativity in 1925, announced publicly, withtypical lack of modesty, that he was one of only three people in the world whounderstood what relativity was.Einstein’s revolutionary theory didn’t alter everyday life; relativity could beset aside in its own exotic cage. (But there are practical applications. Forexample, the GPS satellites that orbit the Earth have to take relativisticeffects into account. If they didn’t, the GPS in your car would be off by afraction of a second and thus give you an inaccurate location for where youare.)Once you accept the human construct of time unfolding in a straight line, itnaturally follows that there is cause and effect. The big bang led to thecreation of planet Earth after around 10 billion years, which in turn led to thecreation of DNA, then human beings, then civilization, then New York City, thenthe birth of a new baby in a New York hospital at some hour this morning. Thereverse cannot be true—the birth of a baby in New York City cannot lead to thebig bang. That would defy cause and effect.This fail-safe is so convincing that we cannot easily accept its artificiality.But relativity wasn’t the last or the only glitch. Modern physics has devisedmathematical models of the universe in which everything happens simultaneouslyat the subtlest level of creation, where time dissolves into the timeless andthe entire cosmos is a single subatomic particle. But such models are exotic,even in quantum physics, which is quite exotic to begin with. Nobody expectssuch notions to rise to the surface of everyday life. Without our fail-safes, webecome very anxious.We are all quite comfortable with the illusions we have protected with fail-safemechanisms. We see the universe as a theater of space and time in which objectsand people bounce around. Our bodies are objects. Our minds are the product ofan amazing thinking machine called the brain, another object. Marvin Minsky ofMIT, one of the fathers of artificial intelligence, defined human beings as“nothing but meat machines that carry a computer in their head”—a mercilessexpression of what most people assume to be true.But there are also personal fail-safes that each of us constructed on our own.These personal fail-safes have been dubbed “the things that must be so.” Somepeople must be in charge; others must win; still others must never start anargument. Is there a rational reason behind “what must be so”? No—thesepsychological mechanisms exist as forms of self-defense. They give us a sense ofsecurity, and even a seemingly small incident can trigger a major alarm. InLove’s Executioner, a 1989 book by Stanford psychiatry professor Irvin Yalom,the author describes a middle-aged woman he calls Elva who had been the victimof a purse snatching outside a restaurant. The crime was random, and while shelost $300, there was nothing else in the purse that couldn’t be replaced. Mostpeople would feel the shock of such an assault and then move on. But Elvacouldn’t: “Along with her purse and her three hundred dollars, an illusion wassnatched away from Elva—the illusion of specialness.”Having lived a life of relative privilege, Elva assumed that she was immune fromthis kind of disruption—she kept repeating, “I never thought it would happen tome.” But it had, and the loss of illusion exacted a terrible price:> The robbery changed everything. Gone was the coziness, the softness in her> life; gone was the safety. Her home had always beckoned her with its cushions,> gardens, comforters, and deep carpets. Now she saw locks, doors, burglar> alarms, and telephones.Elva was constantly anxious, and time didn’t make her feel that her life wasreturning to normal. As Yalom explains it, “Her world view was fractured…She hadlost her belief in benevolence, in her personal invulnerability. She feltstripped, ordinary, unprotected.”Being the victim of a crime shatters personal boundaries, because the crime is apersonal invasion. Here, Elva couldn’t repair her boundaries. She went into anexistential tailspin, haunted by the ultimate threat: death. It wasn’t a fearshe had ever confronted, and yet death had touched her intimately when herhusband died. It was a loss she had never really come to grips with, and itbecame the key issue that Yalom worked with her on in therapy.Elva turned out to be an extraordinary patient, and in time “she moved from aposition of forsakenness to one of trust,” a change Yalom considers not justtransformative but redemptive. Elva, who once thought she had created theperfect story, learned how to be aware of death without fearing it.It’s futile to believe that you can create a perfect story, which is mostpeople’s notion of a perfect life. Stories are always intruded upon by unwelcomeevents. And stories become tangled webs even when they seem to be working outwell, because unconscious forces—anxiety, depression, anger, jealousy,loneliness—can erupt at any time. Although Yalom doesn’t use the term fail-safe,one can see that Elva’s sense of being safe and protected was a psychologicalfail-safe. It had served her well for a long time, until she discovered howflimsy and unreliable it actually was.All of us have created our own version of personal fail-safes. As with mostmental constructs, we often don’t realize what we have done, and sometimes themechanism seems to be so unconscious that it is totally out of our control.Phobias are a good example. People who are afraid of spiders will not physicallybe able to touch even a small, harmless one. If they reach out and attempt totouch one, fear will arise, growing more extreme as the hand gets closer. Thenext stage is violent trembling, a cold sweat, signs of panic, and the feelingof being about to faint.Phobias offer perverse evidence about the creativity of consciousness, becauseanxiety can focus on anything. At the website The Phobia List, you can find acatalog in alphabetical order of the phobias specified in the psychiatricliterature. A total number isn’t given—new references are constantly beingadded—but under the letter A alone there are sixty-five entries, includingaulophobia (fear of flutes). Not every letter is this full; under G, forexample, there are only nineteen phobias listed, including seemingly silly ones,like geniophobia (fear of chins) and quite serious ones like genophobia, a fearof sex. No consensus exists for why phobias appear, although psychiatricallythey are categorized as a form of anxiety disorder, the common element beingexcessive fear. Besides specific phobias, there are social phobias that involvesituations where the person is afraid of what other people think, and a wholeclass of agoraphobias, where people grow panicky because they feel they are in asituation they cannot escape.People suffering from phobias did not necessarily have a bad experience with theobject they fear—they generally haven’t—but they will go to great lengths toavoid the object once the phobia has emerged. Phobias seem strange to anyone notsuffering from one, in part because avoiding the feared object or situation canlead to odd behavior, as with agoraphobes, whose fear of open spaces preventsthem from leaving the house for years at a time. It is also strange thatfear—which puts mind and body on high alert and is an effective protection whenactual danger arises—turns counterproductive in phobias. Being on high alertbecause you hear a flute or see a chin has no survival value whatsoever.Yet the normal fail-safes that we hardly notice have a breaking point, and whenit is reached, severe dislocation occurs. Going into shock, for example, rendersthe victim of an auto accident, fire, or crime utterly helpless. The dazed lookand inability to make decisions that are symptoms of shock could be seen as theopposite of fight-or-flight. In fight-or-flight, a flow of stress hormones isreleased, and under their influence, the lower brain is totally in charge—asoldier running from battle in a panic cannot consciously will himself not toflee until the burst of adrenaline subsides and the higher brain can once moremake conscious decisions. (We can see the same response in a trivial situation,like being shown an illusion by a street magician. When he guesses the rightcard or pulls a quarter from behind someone’s ear, it is quite common for theperson to jump back or turn away in alarm—the lower brain is reacting to thetrick as if it were a threat.) Shock is involuntary and would seem to have noself-protection value.Gathered together, these various fail-safes are essential to the self-model, theview of reality that tells you what is real for you. No doubt personal realityhas its quirks, and no two people inhabit the same self-model. But,collectively, we share virtual reality, with its universally accepted featuresof time, space, matter, and energy. These features are so ingrained that we feel“at home” as long as space, time, matter, and energy don’t go haywire. Butknowing that these are mental constructs isn’t about reality going haywire. It’sabout acquiring self-awareness, which alone can tell us what is really going on.BUYING IN, OPTING OUTNo single individual created the human experience of space, time, matter, andenergy—they were created in our collective consciousness, which goes back as faras the emergence of Homo sapiens and certainly before that. We cannot follow atrail of footprints that will retrace the steps that gave humans self-awareness,which is our species’s unique feature. Our genes contain the evidence of everylife form, including bacteria, that contributed to our physical makeup, butthere are no physical traces to tell us how our ancestors experienced theirlives.Our species’s most important inheritance is invisible. We connect with thislegacy in early childhood, absorbing the whole virtual-reality setup. Once ayoung child learns that time exists, the rules of time soon follow, and thenthere is no turning back. To give an analogy, once you learn to read at age sixor seven, you cannot return to the state of illiteracy. Letters on a page cannotturn back into meaningless black marks. Likewise, once you and your brain haveadapted to the rules of time, it would seem impossible to live as if time didn’texist. A day, an hour, a minute, a second—this dissection of life into bits oftime is what T. S. Eliot lamented in another poem, “The Love Song of J. AlfredPrufrock.” Time has become Prufrock’s psychological enemy.> For I have known them all already, known them all:> > Have known the evenings, mornings, afternoons,> > I have measured out my life with coffee spoons.Making a habit of dividing life into units of time doesn’t mean that human timeis more real than another version. We have no idea of how other species ofconsciousness experience time and space. Does the lumbering Galapagos tortoisefeel it is moving slowly or the jackrabbit that it is bounding fast over awestern prairie? We might speculate that animals live in the present moment,reacting to the instincts that tell them that now is the time to eat or sleep orhunt. But “present moment” doesn’t exist for a creature that has no concept oftime.Nature gives us biorhythms that are imprinted in our genes, like the circadian(daily) rhythm for waking and sleeping. But that doesn’t answer the riddle ofhow time exists in the first place. There is timing that is precisely tuned overthousands of miles of ocean, in a way no one can explain. For example, a smallsandpiper known as the red knot (Calidris canutus rufa) migrates every year fromTierra del Fuego, at the southern tip of South America, to its breeding groundsin the Canadian Arctic. In a lifetime the red knot flies an estimated 240,000miles, longer than the distance from the Earth to the Moon.Why birds cross from one hemisphere to another to mate seems inexplicable, butthe red knot embodies a specific mystery all its own. Needing food along itsimmense journey, the bird stops off in May on the beaches of Delaware Bay,timing its arrival with a primordial event. Between the full moons of May andJune, hordes of horseshoe crabs emerge from ocean shallows to lay their eggs. Afemale lays between 60,000 and 120,000 eggs in one spawning. Dating back450 million years, or 200 million years before dinosaurs, horseshoe crabs looklike hard, rounded turtle shells with spiky tails (they are not actually crabsbut are closely related to spiders and scorpions).Within two weeks the eggs will hatch, so the opening for the red knots to feaston them is very brief. Yet every year, the stirring to migrate is felt 9,300miles away near the Antarctic. The full moon in May can fall on any of themonth’s thirty-one days, and the red knot must start its journey from Tierra delFuego in February. How did Nature synchronize the Moon, the mating cycle of aliving fossil in the sea, and a tiny bird that has the longest migratory path onearth? In the red knot’s case, the timing is somehow rooted in its DNA, and itcomes with sweeping physiological changes. Prior to migrating, the bird’s wingmuscles expand while its leg muscles shrink. Because horseshoe crab eggs aresoft and easily digested, the red knot’s stomach shrinks prior to taking off.Its crop, which has grit in it to grind up the hard food that the bird eats inwinter, also shrinks.In other words, the red knot’s DNA knows in advance every detail of the future.Since their Arctic breeding ground is bare, exposed tundra with no food source,the birds double their weight by adding fat during the Delaware feeding frenzyon horseshoe crab eggs, which lasts from ten to fourteen days. If any element inthis synchronized cycle falters, survival is threatened. (Unfortunately, thishas happened. Red knots are endangered for various reasons, a major one beingthe drastic decline in horseshoe crabs as coastal waters are damaged.)Human beings are not tied to instinct when it comes to time, although our DNAsomehow knows how to time puberty and menstrual cycles, for example. Cells areprogrammed to die at a certain time, a process known as apoptosis. A typicalcell can only divide around fifty times before dying (the so-called Hayflicklimit), and the process can be scientifically measured in the laboratory. But atbottom it is totally mysterious. Cells are chemical factories enclosed in asoft, permeable membrane. Chemical reactions happen instantly when two moleculesmeet; there is no hesitation, delay, postponement, or going back. How, then,does a collection of chemical reactions, each tied to the present instant,acquire the ability to time future events? The question is so basic that almostno one asks it.Imagine a game of pool, with the balls representing atoms and molecules set tocollide inside a heart or liver cell. After you break the pack with your firstshot, the rest is mechanical. When pool balls collide, they must bounce off eachother instantly, and where they travel next is determined by Newton’s laws ofmotion. As one of Newton’s laws dictates, once a ball is hit or collides withanother ball, it must travel in a straight line until something stops it.Nothing abnormal seems to happen as the game unfolds. Yet when you return to thepool room the next day at noon, the balls have already arranged themselves in apack, ready for the first hit. Such behavior would be remarkable enough in poolballs, but your DNA anticipates countless events, controlling the timed releaseof hormones, for example, anticipating the need to refresh the chemical triggersthat fire in a brain cell with every thought, and organizing hundreds ofsynchronized biorhythms with absolute precision unless we interfere (by stayingup all night, for example, or taking hormone supplements).We cannot enter into the experience of time that other species have. But sincetime is so variable and malleable, we can say that it is constructed differentlyby the DNA of each living thing. Therefore, it takes no leap of imagination tosay that time is a construct to begin with. Since DNA consists of atoms thatinteract instantly, something outside the atom must be doing all this precisiontiming and synchronization. The only viable candidate is consciousness. Afterall, you cannot manipulate time unless you know that time exists.LIVING IN A CREATIVE UNIVERSEIf time is a construct, the same is true for the other things we consideressential to the universe. Our experience of matter and energy is quitespecies-specific. Does a termite steadily gnawing its way through a house’swooden frame experience the wood as hard? Does a mole confined underground forits entire lifetime in a tunnel barely wide enough to crawl through experiencespace as tight?For our species of consciousness, time, space, matter, and energy are malleableexperiences, tied to our creativity. That is, they can expand and contract invarious ways, as Einstein explained with a quip: “Put your hand on a hot stovefor a minute, and it seems like an hour. Sit with a pretty girl for an hour, andit seems like a minute. That’s relativity.” But he was actually sidestepping thecore issue of time: Is it relative just because humans say so? Sitting in adentist’s chair dislocates time for people who fear the experience; they cannotsay how much time has passed, except that every minute was unpleasant. Thisdoesn’t alter the hands on the clock in the dentist’s office, so which version,the personal experience or the mechanical device, is real?It will seem bizarre, but human experience is what makes time real, not clocks.To get at how we create the experience of time—along with space, matter, andenergy—you must opt out of accepting that these are fixed things. The currenttheory of the universe helps us out here, because after Einstein proved thatmatter can turn into energy (E = mc2), the door was opened for othertransformations. A later physicist, the American Richard Feynman, could evenshow mathematically how an electron’s position can be expressed as movingbackward in time. This is like being asked where you live, and you answer, “Ilive at 63 Maple Street, although sometimes I live in last February. Take yourpick.” Our stable notion of cause and effect has been dismantled by experimentsin “reverse causation,” where an event in the future affects what is happeningnow.The ultimate transformation, however, occurs when the field of virtual particlesmorphs into physical particles. This is commonly known as “something fromnothing.” Virtual particles are invisible and have no location in time andspace, but they are totally necessary for the physical universe. It’s likereversing ghost stories, where the ghost comes first and the living personsecond. If you look at your hand and begin to reduce it to finer and finerlevels of physicality, it quickly becomes a shivering web of molecules. Thesemolecules are not as solid as your hand, and at the next level down, you arriveat a congregation of atoms that are barely physical, being over 99.9999 percentempty space. This is the last level at which physical existence clings by athread. At the level of subatomic particles, there is a winking in and out ofexistence as quarks, gluons, and other exotica of the quantum domain shift frombeing virtual to being intact in our physical universe. Going from nothing tosomething is happening in your hand and in every other physical object all thetime.So the pivotal issue isn’t that solid physicality is an illusion. No one candispute this—we couldn’t exist without buying into the psychological securityblanket that the world won’t vanish tomorrow in a puff of subatomic mist. Thepivotal issue is whether consciousness, and particularly human consciousness, isthe creative force behind “something from nothing.”Being human unfolds in time and space. Your birth certificate attests to thedate of your birth and the town you were born in. No one’s birth certificatesays, Date of Birth: Eternity; Place of Birth: Everywhere. The commonsenseassumption is that time and space simply exist “out there” as part of thenatural world. To evolve to metahuman, however, we need to stop thinking ofcreation in fixed terms. Reality must be rebuilt to account for the roleconsciousness plays. There are only two levels of reality. One level isunbounded pure consciousness, which is a field of potential. The other level isconsciousness in its excited state (to borrow a phrase from particle physics),which we call the universe.All excited states vibrate with energy. Matter is vibrating with physicalenergy, the mind with mental energy. The body is an excited state; so is thebrain, being part of the body, and so is the mind as thinking goes on. Even whena rock looks like a rock and a neuron like a neuron, which makes them seemtotally dissimilar, both are excited modes of consciousness.This is practical knowledge. When you know, for example, that time is just anexcited state of consciousness, you see why time is so malleable. It has nochoice but to be as fluid and flexible as the mind. We manipulate time toconform to our human needs. Some time frames are long, like the life of theuniverse, while some are short, like the milliseconds it takes for a signal tojump from one nerve cell to the next. These time frames can be extremely stable:hydrogen atoms are likely to exist until the death of the universe, while athought is stable only for its duration, which is transient and evanescent. Thefact that mental activity flies by so fast can lead to a mistake. We mightsuppose that consciousness is on a time schedule—it isn’t. Consciousness can befast or slow, large or small, random or predictable, and so on.Being the source of “something from nothing,” consciousness isn’t bound by itsown creation, just as a person with a vocabulary of thirty thousand words isn’ttied down to thirty thousand thoughts. Combining and re-forming all the time,consciousness dictates to itself whether to be as tiny as a quark or as immenseas the universe. This fact helps dispel one of the most obstinate objections toconsciousness-based reality. We don’t see our minds create trees, mountains,planets, and stars. The scale is wrong, skeptics will say. When you are afraidand your heart starts to pound, a mental event—your fear—sets chemicals inmotion in your body. The scale is molecular, meaning very small. Moving amountain with your mind, however, cannot happen, because it is too large.This objection is invalid, however, because consciousness doesn’t respect limitsof scale. Imagine that you wake up from a nightmare, and you tell a friend thata hundred men with guns were chasing you down the street. What if your friendreplied, “I’d buy it if one man were chasing you down the street, but a hundredis too many to be believable.” Such a comment would show ignorance about howdreams work. Dreams are not bounded by big and small. A mouse chasing you downthe street during a nightmare is the same as the Red Army invading your town. Ina dream a blade of grass can tremble, followed by a planet exploding.We accept these anomalies in dreams because we are used to waking up andreturning to the physical world and its constraints. Consciousness is set up sothat some things are free to move around just by thinking, like brain chemicalsthat move around in sync with our thoughts, while other things aren’t movable bythinking. That’s the setup in a human universe. We don’t know the limits of thesetup until we test them. One has to ponder if Jesus had a similar understandingin mind when he declared to his disciples, “Truly I say to you, whoever says tothis mountain, ‘Be taken up and cast into the sea,’ and does not doubt in hisheart, but believes that what he says is going to happen, it will be grantedhim” (Mark 11:23).Whether you accept those words as gospel or metaphor, literal truth or a vividteaching example, the notion of moving mountains with your mind soundssupernatural, therefore irrelevant to everyday life. The problem isn’t thatsupernatural = impossible. The problem is that, so far, science cannot explainwhat we call “natural.” Leaving consciousness out of standard scientificexplanations dooms them to failure. The mind cannot be explained by jugglingbrain chemicals around, and when science declares that there is no otherexplanation, we are no longer in the realm of credibility—we are in the realm of“things that must be so.”Once virtual reality has been dismantled, however, there is no going back. Youcannot see through an illusion and believe in it at the same time. A magiciancan’t sit in the audience and be fooled by his own tricks. However, that’sexactly what we do. We place our faith in the physical world while knowing fullwell that it is illusory.Instead of passively accepting the commonsense world, metareality gives us analternative—seeing everything in the universe as shifting modes ofconsciousness. A tree, for example, is tailor-made to fit our human response toit. Any quality of a tree can be taken out of its assigned slot and reassignedto fit a different, nonhuman framework. The tree’s color doesn’t exist forsomeone with complete color-blindness. The solidity of a tree doesn’t exist fora neutrino, a subatomic particle that can whiz through the Earth as if passingthrough outer space. The weight of the tree doesn’t exist if you transfer it tothe International Space Station. The life span of a tree vanishes when viewedfrom the life span of the protons in the nucleus of every molecule, which takebillions of years to decay.Everything acquires its “realness” from the mode of consciousness applied to it.In sleep the entire physical world disappears and no longer exists for you. Itstill exists collectively, held in place by the rules of virtual reality. But insleep you opt out of virtual reality by experiencing a different world, whichisn’t the blank unconsciousness most people assume sleep to be. It is possibleto experience deep sleep as pure awareness without excitations—indeed, that’show centuries of swamis, yogis, and other versions of metahuman experience it.The Buddhist concept of Nirvana is closer to deep sleep than to the ordinarywaking state, because Nirvana reconnects a person with pure awareness.Dreaming is a mode of consciousness in which mental excitations are subtle. Thisis yet another world, one where the rules of virtual reality don’t apply. Indreams, objects magically defy the ordinary laws of physics—a locomotive canfly, the Empire State Building can vanish in a puff of smoke. There is no reasonto demote those two modes of consciousness, sleeping and dreaming, to aninferior position compared with being awake. If we can look at the world as alucid dream, why consider the dreams you experience at night as any less real orunreal?People blindly follow the assumption that hard physical things are more realthan subtle things like thoughts, imagination, and dreams. But your subtleimpulses determine how your personal reality operates. I’ve given oneexample—phobias—where a person who can lift hundred-pound weights at the gym maybe unable to lift a spider in his hand; fear freezes up his muscles. It doesn’tmatter how light the feared object is. But we also need positive examples of howa person’s subtle intentions can alter personal reality.Think back to our earlier example of using VR apparatus to simulate theexperience of standing on a skyscraper girder high in the air (this page[Chop_9781524762988_epub3_c003_r1.xhtml#page_36]). A person standing safely onthe ground, thanks to the VR illusion, feels giddy and weak, and experiences apowerful threat of falling. This indicates that our sense of balance can beconsciously manipulated in various ways. Tightrope walkers have separated theirsense of balance from any feeling of threat or danger. To someone standing onthe ground looking up, the danger looks real enough (your heart can pound simplyfrom watching a risky circus act without experiencing it firsthand).In the accepted model of evolution, all the traits we inherited have survivalvalue. Our ancestors needed a sense of balance for obvious reasons when huntingand fighting other creatures in the wild. But we go beyond survival all the timeand toy with our evolutionary inheritance simply because we want to. Tightropewalking has no survival value, and since it poses considerable danger unless youare highly trained, it has negative survival value.Babies are afraid of falling from a very early age, and they can’t learn to walkwithout testing the precarious state between falling down and staying on theirfeet. Clearly fear of falling loses out in the end. Tightrope walkers go a stepfurther by consciously overriding evolution when they disconnect fear of fallingfrom sense of balance. This ability to override evolution is actually a higherevolutionary trait.The power of consciousness allows daredevils to hang glide or free-climbvertical rock faces using any rationale that comes to mind—thrill seeking, adrive to accomplish the impossible, competitive rivalry, or simply no reason atall—oblivious to their life-or-death situation. Such freedom is absent increatures hemmed in by physical evolution. Only Homo sapiens turns extremerisk-taking into fun. We choose our own motives, and personal reality moves withour intentions. It would be horrifying to find yourself in a dark alley facingan assailant armed with a knife, but someone with appendicitis, blocked coronaryarteries, or a tumor willingly undergoes the controlled violence presented byknife-wielding surgeons. Once consciousness interprets a situation in a specificway, the reality of the situation fits whatever consciousness has decided.The virtual reality that surrounds us permanently is a construct that fits somany motives, intentions, decisions, and interpretations that we’ve lost trackof them all.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This chapter has dived into deep water, and some issues get complex. But thepurpose of the chapter is simple—to close the gap between illusion and reality.No one’s body is going to vaporize. The commonsense world will be there to greetyou when you wake up tomorrow morning. Yet everything is entangled in illusion,making the commonsense world unstable at its core. By testing the very limits oftime, space, matter, and energy, we are testing our own creative power. Moving amountain with your mind is nothing next to moving the whole world, which is ourultimate goal."},{"pageContent":"6 EXISTENCE AND CONSCIOUSNESS ARE THE SAMEI have strong memories, growing up in India, of attending schools taught byCatholic missionaries. The Old Testament wasn’t light reading—I came awayremembering sin, wars, laws, lamentations, and plagues. But there’s a verse veryearly on, after the seven days of creation, in which God “was walking in theGarden in the cool of the day” (Genesis 3:8). God was still on good terms withAdam and Eve, and, in my imagination, the moment was perfect for a casualconversation. None occurs. Adam and Eve aren’t actually there at first, havinghidden from God out of shame for their nakedness. But in my imaginaryconversation, they would ask a crucial question: “Why did you do it? Why did youcreate the world?”In reply, God would say, somewhat sheepishly, “There wasn’t any reason. I justhad to. I couldn’t help myself.”Modern cosmology has come up with no better answer. The universe isself-creating. It exists just because it has to exist. Everything since the bigbang has unfolded of its own accord, driven by natural forces. We almost didn’tmake it. Physicists have calculated that the balance of creation and destructionwas extremely delicate in the beginning. Destruction came within a hairbreadthof winning out, because all but the tiniest fraction of primal mass and energycollapsed within itself, returning to the vacuum state, as it is known. Aslittle as one part in a billion escaped the jaws of destruction—a metaphor forgravity, the force that caused the collapse of everything else—but one billionthof creation was enough to enable trillions of stars and galaxies to be formed.(This didn’t happen quickly, though. It took 800 million years for the oldeststar to coalesce from interstellar dust.)A self-creating universe is our version, with many bells and whistles attached,of the eighteenth-century notion of God as a cosmic clockmaker who wound up theearly universe, set it going, and departed to let it operate mechanically. Butself-creation is a sticky business. Who or what got the process going? Thecreator’s creator wasn’t a problem for the ancient Jewish rabbis—they acceptedGod on faith as always existing. Finding a similar nonfaith agent has proved allbut impossible.I’m arguing in this book that consciousness is the only viable self-creator,turning itself into mind, body, brain, and universe. That’s a radical departurefrom physical explanations of the cosmos. As in the Book of Genesis,consciousness creates because it has to. It only needs to exist in order tostart the ball rolling. (Where did existence come from? We don’t have to worryabout that, because if nonexistence existed, it wouldn’t be nonexistence.)Just because it exists, pure consciousness generates reality as we know it. Theancient Indian scriptures speak of myriad worlds spinning into creation likemotes of dust dancing in a sunbeam. But in the same sunbeam we see myriadthoughts, feelings, sensations, and images, too, the entire content of the humanmind. Faced with staggering overload, our minds have to generate a livable worldto inhabit—a human world—and the virtual reality that we created was inevitable.But simply reducing the teeming multiplicity of raw reality wasn’t enough. Thehuman world contains meaning. Where did it come from? It was always there, as aprimary trait of metareality. Pure consciousness created a universe filled withmeaning. Everything we can say about being human—our joy, love, vitality,intelligence, and infinite potential—needed no creator. Those qualities camewith existence, right off the bat. Without wheels, a car isn’t a car. Withouthumanity, the cosmos isn’t a cosmos we could ever relate to, or even inhabit.The universe was created for us because there is no other alternative. Creationcannot be whole unless we are whole. Once this secret is revealed, metahuman canfree itself from self-doubt, confusion, and sorrow. They are the stepchildren ofillusion.A SPECIAL CREATIONPure consciousness cannot be interviewed, like talking to God, even in animaginary conversation. But the notion of self-creation has always been viable.We can accept without question that Homo sapiens created its own version ofreality. We are still at it, with no signs of stopping. It makes no sense toclaim that our remotest ancestors somehow learned to be creative. Creativity isintrinsic to us, like breathing.Somehow we picked up a lot of old habits that consciousness had gotten used to.All life forms are wrapped up in self-creation, but they are content to let itroll over them. The ancestor of all mammals was a shrew-like creature namedJuramaia that lived in tree ferns around freshwater lakes 160 million years ago.The discovery of this creature in China in 2011 pushed the ancestry of all“true” mammals back by 35 million years. (A true mammal species is one in whichthe fetus is nurtured by a placenta in the womb. This accounts for 95 percent ofall mammals, the other portion being marsupials like possums and kangaroos thatgive birth to tiny babies that finish their maturation inside the mother’spouch.)Juramaia didn’t know that it would be anything but a shrew, and you’d think,looking at its five-inch skeleton, that only modern shrews would descend fromit, not all true mammals. No trace of dogs, cats, bats, elephants, or whales isvisible. It took a lot of inference to suggest that Juramaia had a placenta,since no soft tissues are preserved in fossils. Yet guesswork isn’t needed whenit comes to knowing that a placenta was the key. Once it appeared, a uniquefeature never seen before, a door was opened. What rushed through it wasn’tJuramaia, which eventually became extinct, but self-creation. An unstoppablehabit took a leap forward. From then on, true mammals could be small, big, ormammoth. They could swim, walk, crawl, burrow, or fly. Nothing was fixed orpermanent—except a placenta. Nature took a creative leap without precedent, withbarely a hint in all past life forms that this new kind of birth was possible.This brings up a second misconception, that evolution is all about progress.Creativity doesn’t need to progress; it is already complete. Every life form isa complete creative act. In the case of Juramaia, a tiny shrew-like creaturewasn’t better than what came before. Marsupials could have ruled the Earth—theybecame the only indigenous mammals in Australia. Much earlier, eggs evolved, andthey kept on hatching, just as they did during the reign of the dinosaurs. Livebirth wasn’t better—today some sharks lay eggs while others give birth to liveyoung. There is no straight-line progression from early life forms to us.Billion-year-old microbes, one-celled animals, and blue-green algae continue toexist because their adaptation to the Earth was perfect in its own way. Withoutthe unstoppable urge to create, there was no reason for primitive life to leaveits very secure comfort zone.Self-creation is a strong clue that consciousness needs nothing outside itselfto keep expanding endlessly. In time, Homo sapiens rushed through another door,the one that opened to self-awareness. We can do anything with our potentialthat we want to, but no matter how civilization changes, it is impossible to behuman without being aware. The only question is the degree of awareness wechoose to embrace. Metahuman is closer than we imagine, being just a higherdegree of awareness.Awareness and existence are uncreated. That’s the simplest formulation of thetruth. Being uncreated means they simply are. Without having to give a reason,needing no creation story, the primal setup for being human is that we are here.We exist because consciousness exists. Of all the secrets of metareality, thisone takes the longest to sink in. At first glance, existence is a non-issue.Nobody in a college debating society like the Oxford Union will argue the casefor nonexistence. There would be no debating societies if we didn’t exist—thepoint seems silly, even childish. But if being here is enough to bring abouteverything in creation through a conscious process, that is big news.Existence and consciousness cannot be separated. They don’t just belongtogether, like heat and fire or water and wetness. They are the same thing.Descartes famously declared Cogito ergo sum, “I think, therefore I am.” It’smore accurate to say the reverse: I am, therefore I think.Either way, however, seeking a cause-and-effect relationship is chop logic. Toexist and to think are the same thing. One doesn’t cause the other. Failing tosee this fact has led to many misconceptions. For example, if you insist thatthe mind needs a cause, you are stuck giving it a creation story. If you are amodern secular person, you are soon trapped in the mistake of believing that thebrain created the mind. To a developmental psychologist, there is no doubt thatthe brain creates the mind, and neuroscience concurs. As creation stories go,this one is bolstered by physiology, but childhood development also offersenough evidence to blow the story apart.THE EXPANDING BRAINIf we look at the last stages of the fetus’s life in the womb, the brain is themain focus of development, the last organ to acquire its final configuration—butthat won’t happen yet. At the moment of birth, the infant brain is explodingwith untapped growth potential. The biggest part of the human brain is thecerebrum, responsible for thinking and other higher functions, and evolution hasgiven babies a huge cerebrum to begin with, one reason that a newborn’s head isso large, at the limits of what can pass though the birth canal. In a normalfetus carried to term, the last trimester sees the brain roughly tripling inweight, from 3.5 ounces at the end of the second trimester to 10.6 ounces atbirth.In a sense, all babies are born prematurely, entering a “fourth trimester” theday they are born, because the brain keeps up its accelerated growth outside thewomb. In the first three months of life, a newborn’s brain grows by as much as1 percent a day, expanding by 64 percent in the first ninety days, after whichthe growth rate shrinks to an average of 0.4 percent a day. During therapid-growth phase, 60 percent of the energy consumed by a baby is used by thebrain. The large-scale or macro view shows that a newborn already has all thebrain cells needed for a lifetime—in fact, too many. A newborn’s brain cellsnumber around twice what an adult has, even though the newborn brain weighs halfas much. As it grows to full size, which takes three years, the baby brain thinsout its weaker connections (a process technically known as “synaptic pruning”).It’s like sorting through an attic filled to the rafters with things you needand junk you can do without.Here we begin to see the mystery of uniqueness, because synaptic pruning isdifferent for each baby. The brain somehow disposes of what will not be neededfor that one individual. A musical prodigy who needs phenomenal motor skills toplay the piano at a virtuoso level may not need advanced mathematical ability orarticulate language skills. A sculptor with a highly developed ability toenvision objects in three-dimensional space may wind up without the relationshipskills to find the right spouse. The combinations are endless, and, to matchthem, the brain’s quadrillion synaptic connections are just enough. Yet clearlya brain cell has no foreknowledge that it will be needed or not needed,according to events far in the future. Synaptic pruning isn’t random. It onlymakes sense that a higher perspective that is beyond time must be managing theprocess.For example, a study by researchers at the University of Washington found thatspecific areas of the brain that control the physical aspects of speech (Broca’sarea and the cerebellum) are activated in seven-month-olds in advance oflearning to speak. This is evidence of looking ahead to the future and throwingthe necessary brain switches in advance. A seven-month-old baby doesn’t knowthat she will one day speak, but Homo sapiens does, because we are a species ofconsciousness. Our species communicates through the spoken word, and just aboutevery baby has inherited that ability.This is different from inheriting the physical need to exchange baby teeth foradult teeth, which is linked to the growth of the jaw, or the need to go throughpuberty, which makes it possible to pass on our genes through sexualreproduction. Speech is a mental acquisition, a prime tool for knowing whatsomeone else is thinking.If understanding the brain would allow us to understand the mind, we’d be farahead of the game. Yet the notion that “brain creates mind” has always been afallacy. For a cell to know anything, it cannot get that knowledge from atomsand molecules. Atoms and molecules don’t know that speech will be necessary.Only consciousness affords a valid explanation, because consciousness is theknowing element in every cell, every life form, and every person.Because we live in the golden age of neuroscience, you would think that somedaythere would be a user’s manual for the mind. But that day will never come. Ourview is blocked by the mistake of equating mind and brain. Even the fact thatthe brain contains a quadrillion connections is meaningless in terms of mind,just as measuring every frequency of visible light would be meaningless toexplain how Leonardo da Vinci painted the Mona Lisa. Life would be meaninglessif the brain were in charge, because the brain itself is meaningless. Themystique that surrounds it, ascribing thoughts, feelings, and sensations toclumps of neurons, has no basis. If a neuroscientist went around saying, “Thatquarterback is out of his brain” or “I’d like to buy a house, but I just can’tmake up my brain,” no one would deny that mind is the word intended.It’s very difficult, however, to pry neuroscientists from their belief that“brain creates mind.” In the emergency room, an EEG reveals when the victim of afatal car accident is brain-dead, at which point there is no mind left. Isn’t itobvious that the mind lived there, beneath the hard shell of the skull? Not atall. Imagine that you had never seen a player piano and knew nothing about howone works. You walk into a music room, and a piano is playing “The Blue DanubeWaltz” by itself. You can see the keys going up and down, the hammers strikingthe strings.How would you know if there was an invisible pianist performing this magicalact? There’s no way to tell. On the other hand, it seems irrational to jump tothe conclusion that the piano is playing itself. The instrument’s rawmaterials—wood, steel, felt, and ivory—can be studied down to the atomic level.Nowhere will you find a talent for music. Yet in neuroscience and everyday life,we say that the brain, which is also a physical instrument, thinks, feels, sees,and does everything else that happens in the mind. We make this assumptionwithout the slightest proof that the raw materials inside a cell—basicallyhydrogen, oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen—can love or hate Brussels sprouts, enjoyViennese waltzes, fall in love, and so on. The fact that the brain is constantlybuzzing with activity doesn’t tell us that a mind is at work or why each mind isunique at any given moment.Finding the source of the mind is easy once you put consciousness first. It’snot hard to do this. We naturally rely on the mind because our existence is tiedto it. We use our minds in lots of ways that do not light up on a brain scan andthat require no discernible brain activity. Can you recognize your spouse’s facein a crowd? Yes, instantly, but you don’t go through a process that requiresbrain activity. Your brain doesn’t flip through a mental Rolodex until you finda stored image of the right face and pick it out, the way the witness to a crimeis asked to flip through mug shots at the police station. Recognition happens inthe mind without burning calories in the brain, and unless the brain is burningcalories, it’s not at work.In the same way, you choose words without thumbing through a dictionary storedin the brain. And once you learn the streets of a new town, you can negotiatethem without consulting a map—on paper or in your brain. Learned things aresimply there. The opposite is also true. If someone asks you the meaning ofhydrocephalus or ratatouille, and you don’t know the word, you don’t need tocomb through your vocabulary for missing words—you immediately know that youdon’t know. But a high-speed computer has to consult its stored memory before itsays, “Does not compute.”Some years ago I met a math prodigy, now retired from being a professor, who hadstarted publishing in leading mathematics journals at the age of twelve andsubsequently attended Princeton at sixteen. He finished his coursework for adoctorate at Harvard while still an undergraduate. As remarkable as prodigiesare, one comment in an interview with this math genius stuck in my mind. Whenasked how his thinking process was different from other people’s, he said thathe didn’t think in order to solve a math problem—he posed the problem tohimself, allowed it to incubate, and waited for the right answer to pop out.He had developed such absolute confidence early on and still continues to relyon it. Should we consider genius exceptional, totally divorced from the norm?Not at all. To some degree everyone has experienced the power of intuition,which can be defined as the mind jumping to a conclusion without having to thinkthrough all the individual steps along the way. When people say intuitivethings, like “I knew the man I was going to marry when I first set eyes on him”or “I knew I’d fly jets from the time I was five,” they didn’t arrive at thiscertainty by thinking it through. In all kinds of activities, the mind relies onthe knowing element that is innate in consciousness. This fact must be graspedbefore we can venture into the metahuman possibility of using our fullpotential. The door is slammed shut if “brain creates mind,” because what makesus human—love, compassion, creativity, insight, and imagination—is beyond thebrain.We can bolster the case by returning to the infant brain yet again. At birth abrain scan will indicate that a newborn’s brain is highly active, but no onewould claim that a newborn is thinking, not in the way adults put words togetherin their head. When an infant cries, it is inarticulately saying it is hungry,tired, afraid, needs changing, and so on. The mother picks one of thepossibilities and acts accordingly once she pinpoints what her baby wants. Wedon’t assume that the baby knows anything beyond its raw discomfort.At some point, thinking begins, and an infant’s life becomes mind-based.Thinking in words and forming ideas begin to emerge. But even if you werepresent at the exact instant a baby uttered her first word and even if you couldmap this moment as an event on a brain scan, the birth of language isn’t in thebrain. Somehow, purely in consciousness, a thought arises, connected to ameaning.At first the use of words is like a parrot repeating what it hears. Goo goomeans nothing. Mama is probably a parroted word coaxed out by the baby’s mother.But then an invisible, silent aha occurs. Mama is the concept that attaches to aperson, and only one person in the whole world. Then there’s an acceleration ofspeech, and by their second birthday, infants enter what experts call a “meaningexplosion.” (This is also apparently the point at which chimpanzee DNA, although98 percent identical to human DNA, stops short. Homo sapiens is unique in havingbillions of new neural connections developing in the first two years of life.) Atypical two-year-old knows around a hundred words; at two and a half, vocabularyhas grown to around three hundred words.Meanwhile, a change occurs that is far more significant than acquiring avocabulary: toddlers start saying things they have never heard before, formingnew sentences on their own. No one taught us how to do this, and yet the mostadvanced computer is miles behind the average three- or four-year-old. Acomputer can be programmed to invent an infinite number of sentences never saidbefore, but it doesn’t know what it’s doing. The process is totally mechanical—alaptop saying “I love you” doesn’t really mean it.Meaning can’t explode out of the meaningless, just as sentences that make sensecannot emerge simply by tossing alphabet soup in the air. Consciousness unfoldsas mind, body, and brain, each process governed by meaning and purpose. (Apopular motivational slogan in recent years is “the purpose-driven life,” whichinspires people who feel confused, adrift, and without purpose. Yet we cannothelp but be purpose-driven from birth—otherwise, we’d be mindless.) We may notbe able to articulate the meaning of life, but we are certain that there ismeaning, and we are designed to reach for more.Consciousness is a meaning field. We know this despite ourselves. In oneexperiment, participants were told that they would be taking a hearing test,which required them to listen to recordings of sentences being said in a verylow voice. Even with good hearing it was hard to make out exactly what was beinguttered, but the participants were told to make the best guess they could.What they didn’t know was that each was listening to a sequence of nonsensesyllables, a possibility that occurred to no one. No matter how low andunintelligible the voice, the participants heard—or guessed they heard—sentencesthat made sense. Yet even before language arose, animals made sense of theirsurroundings, learning to recognize edible food, potential threats, a desirablemate, and their own young. We might call this recognition instinctive, but itdoesn’t change the fact that meaning was inescapable. Even a one-celled amoebaengulfing a smaller one-celled creature is distinguishing food from nonfood.Nothing, not even the force of evolution, created meaning out of chaos—it is agiven in the universe.The mind field has the capacity to turn into a minefield, depending on what kindof mind a child develops. The people who hide from their own inner world, whodutifully shape their lives according to social norms, do it in order to avoidtrouble. But hiding out from the mind’s dark side doesn’t defuse the threat. Atragic view of life hangs over us after the unthinkable carnage of the twentiethcentury, when an estimated 100 million people died as a result of war andgenocide.The cognitive explosion that anthropologists surmise occurred in prehistory, aleap that revealed the world of self-awareness, repeats itself with every baby’scognitive explosion as the baby learns to think and speak. The infant brainadapts to the worldview imposed on it. Infinite potential gets reduced in waysfar too limiting and self-defeating. The British writer Aldous Huxley took asimilar view decades ago. He wrote extensively against the use of the brain as a“reducing valve” that narrowed down the mind. Here’s one of Huxley’s mostforceful statements on the matter:> Each one of us is potentially Mind at Large. But in so far as we are animals,> our business is at all costs to survive. To make biological survival possible,> Mind at Large has to be funneled through the reducing valve of the brain and> nervous system. What comes out at the other end is a measly trickle of the> kind of consciousness which will help us to stay alive on the surface of this> particular planet.Using other words, Huxley is contrasting the unbounded field of consciousnesswith the tightly bound perspective the everyday mind takes. His central point,that the “reducing valve” of the brain was necessary for our survival, hasgained modern support from various proponents of evolutionary psychology. They,too, view the narrowing of mind as a necessity for survival. But I’ve beenarguing that consciousness never loses its infinite potential, no matter what ishappening to us inside virtual reality. Placing the blame for our flawedexistence on the brain points in the wrong direction. The brain is another modeof consciousness. Its potential isn’t inherently limited. Let’s go deeper intowhy this is so, because, for practical purposes, accessing metareality won’t bepossible unless the brain can break free from its narrowness and take us there.MIND AT LARGE AND PSYCHEDELICSThe first requirement is to open up the brain’s reducing valve, which has beenhappening through a surprising avenue. A new wave of medical interest surroundsthe potential value of psychedelic drugs, spurred by a thorough, sensible reviewof a once-taboo subject by Michael Pollan in his first-person account, How toChange Your Mind. For hallucinogens to resurface was a “Come out, come out,wherever you are” proposition. LSD, magic mushrooms, and mescaline had their dayin the sixties and emerged from that time badly tarnished. Leaving aside variousantidrug laws largely prompted by fear, a medical researcher who looked intopsychedelics typically faced the risk of censure, perhaps career-ending censure.At the very least, such research wasn’t taken very seriously and was quicklybrushed aside.The general view of psychedelics has been, up until recently, that they arepotentially unsafe and medically useless. That is all changing. What has changedthis conventional wisdom is deeper knowledge and better understanding of thebrain. In particular, the area of the brain that seems to cause themind-altering effect of LSD and company is the so-called default mode network(DMN), a collection of regions in the higher brain that organizes and regulatesa wide range of cerebral activity. The DMN filters out the flood of informationthat bombards us every day, selecting and controlling our response to the world.It is the physiological location for the editing of reality we’ve beendiscussing in this book. A troubling implication of the DMN is that our brainsevolved physically to become Huxley’s reducing valve. LSD jolts the DMNtemporarily, but once the trip is over, we go back to the brain’s status quo.Undoubtedly, the DMN serves a totally necessary function. Instead of feelingoverwhelmed by a barrage of chaotic stimuli, a stable brain helps us approachlife with a balance of judgment, experience, and self-interest. The DMN has beencalled the “me” network, because it functions in the brain the way the egofunctions in psychology, tamping down irrational impulses and keeping them incheck while organizing a balanced adult self.The DMN doesn’t develop until around age five, coinciding with the time whenchildren become proud of “not being a baby.” This entails many things—notthrowing tantrums and crying over each little discomfort; showing more courage,independence, and self-possession; wanting to be useful by helping out; anddefending their own tastes and inclinations. A great deal of innerself-regulation is required for such a complex shift in behavior, and the DMNhandles the majority of that.But this shift isn’t altogether good and positive. From Huxley’s perspective,Mind at Large is being reduced for the sake of crude animal survival. From amedical standpoint it is conjectured that the DMN, although totally necessary sothat we aren’t tripping all the time in a whirling blur of sights and sounds,has a downside. Over time its automatic (i.e., default) responses becomeingrained and rigid. On the one hand, this may account for the stubbornnarrow-mindedness associated with growing old, while on the other there may be atie-in to disorders like anxiety, depression, and addiction. These becomeingrained responses that won’t be dislodged until the DMN stops controlling themso tightly.One of the most searching accounts of personal transformation on psychedelics isTrip, the 2018 memoir of the American writer Tao Lin, born of Taiwanese parentsin Florida in 1983. Lin had long been afflicted with despondency. As he puts it:> Life still seemed bleak to me, as it had in evolving ways since I was thirteen> or fourteen. I was chronically not fascinated by existence, which…did not feel> wonderful or profound but tedious and uncomfortable and troubling.Isolated, leading a hermit-like life whose solitude was aggravated by what Lincalls his addiction to the internet and his smartphone, he came to psychedelicsby bingeing for thirty hours on the YouTube soliloquies of Terence McKenna, apassionate advocate of tripping who died in 2000. Lin was attracted by themessage that psychedelics could increase his imagination and bring him closer toNature.Lin has a complex story to tell—during one trip he sees himself being fired outof a cannon into the Milky Way—and he ponders “all kinds of issues about what isreality, what is language, what is the self, what is three-dimensional space andtime.” This echoes what people report from near-death and out-of-bodyexperiences. In all these cases, the self-model stops being the defaultviewpoint on reality, or, in neurological terms, the DMN.By releasing the hold of the DMN, psychedelics allow an opening for alteringbrain function among people with mood disorders and the like. The DMN was onlydiscovered in 2001 by researcher Michael Richie using advanced fMRI scans. Forthe first time, researchers could see the interconnected parts of the DMN lightup when a person was asked, for example, to choose adjectives that describedhimself. To a neuroscientist, the increased blood flow to the DMN thataccompanies this task shows, in effect, that the self is a brain function—yourDMN knows who you are because it created your default responses when you thinkabout yourself.The increase and decrease of blood flow is a useful indicator in brain research,as are patterns of electrical activity, but these are still not a measure of themind, only its physical mirror. Psychedelics change the pattern of blood flow inunusual ways. Pollan cites a study in which nineteen subjects suffering fromdepression improved after taking psilocybin, the active ingredient in “magicmushrooms,” after being resistant to conventional drug therapy. The researchersfound that blood flow to the amygdala (the brain’s emotional center) decreased,but this doesn’t explain why the subjects also reported profound mysticalexperiences.Many are skeptical about such findings. One problem is that there’s no way togive a placebo to a control group that would simulate the real drug’shallucinogenic effects. (No one actually knows why our bodies evolved to havereceptors for psychedelics, given how rarely they must have been encountered byour remote ancestors.) But the main research on psychedelics seems to indicatethat these substances reduce DMN activity, shutting it down temporarily. Intandem with this shutting down, the person taking the drug feels his egodissolve, together with the normal experience of mind, body, and world. Thisunderscores the point that mind, body, brain, and world are highly malleable inhuman perception. We are entangled in the process of holding them intact everywaking moment, and psychedelics abruptly and radically loosen our grip.For Pollan, the experience was a revelation. He came to recognize “thetenuousness and relativity of my own default consciousness.” His thorough,objective investigation, which involved taking a gamut of mind-altering drugsbut also delving into every nook and cranny of medical research, led him to hopethat their use would extend to normal healthy people (although he retained asensible fear of bad trips). He wanted the psychedelic journey to be consideredmore than a “drug experience.” In his view, the first step should be obtainingthe guidance of someone who could explain the meaning of a trip after it wasover, if it had a meaning (not everyone agrees that it does).-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Where does that leave us? No one really knows, and respected scientific journalsroutinely turn down research papers on psychedelics. Pollan’s book should beread to get the complete story about the future promise of these substances.Particularly intriguing is the use of “micro-dosing,” in which tiny amounts of apsychedelic are taken on an everyday basis, enough to loosen the grip of the DMNbut not altering normal thinking. The hope is that, instead of altering the mindin a drastic, trippy way, micro-dosing will permit self-awareness to observe andreflect upon new possibilities that a person cannot access under normalconditions.There’s no doubt, from a meta viewpoint, that psychedelics weaken or dissolvethe mental constructs that keep virtual reality intact. Some people feel thattripping has tapped into Mind at Large. This sounded highly desirable to Huxley,who was an early champion of guided psychedelic trips into expandedconsciousness; this was his ultimate goal. To become respectable, psychedelicshad to get past their hippie image, however, and brain scans proved to be thekey. But the respectability lent by brain scans also contains a flaw.To a neuroscientist, the DMN is like the adult in the room, a brain region thatkeeps our wilder, more primitive impulses at bay. Thus a specialized group ofcells has taken over the exact function that Freud assigned to the ego. It istypical of our age that psychiatry is highly dependent on pharmaceuticals tocombat anxiety and depression, replacing years of expensive, time-consuming talktherapy. As psychiatry has become a matter of shifting around molecules in thebrain, so has everything else about the mind. But the notion that “brain createsmind” is just as fallacious here as elsewhere.The fallacy crops up glaringly in the DMN, because if it indeed controls thebalancing act that is the adult mind, who gave it such ability? How did it learnabout the benefits of adulthood in the first place? The first answer that comesto mind is that the DMN arose as a survival mechanism, but there’s no proof ofthis—it’s just a blanket generalization from the stock-in-trade of Darwinians.Countless people function well in society without bothering to grow into matureadults.Researchers treat the DMN as if it were a conscious agent with flexibleintentions and good judgment. Attributing such qualities to brain cells is aform of magical thinking. Clumps of chemicals don’t understand how life works;only consciousness does.After trying a number of different drugs, Michael Pollan had his most profoundexperience without them. He was shown how to go into a trance state simplythrough breathing rapidly and listening to rhythmic drumming. His reaction:“Where in the world has that been all my life?” It was in Mind at Large.All drugs have side effects, some of them unpredictable, but the pitfalls ofpsychedelics are unique. If you go inside and mess around with a piano’sstrings, music starts to come out sounding distorted. To go into the mostsensitive areas of the higher brain incurs a similar risk, but my point isn’t tosound alarms grounded in fear and suspicion—quite the opposite. Mind at Largecontains the full range of human potential, and it can be accessed naturallythrough yoga, meditation, and various contemplative practices. These practicesalso bring beneficial brain changes, accomplishing this through the most naturalof mechanisms: the mind learning to know itself.The time for psychedelics to come out of the shadows is now, giving us abalanced picture of what is at stake and also at risk. The sudden feeling thatwe can fly turns out to be a fatal delusion if we test it by jumping off a highbuilding, as has happened more than once. The insights that dawn during a tripoften turn out to be unintelligible on returning to a normal waking state. Thebigger picture goes beyond psychedelics. Pollan encourages “neural diversity” inthe epilogue to his book. But, for me, the mind-altering effect of LSD bearsfruit only if it leads to self-awareness. A drug can show you what lies beyondthe limited mind; only self-awareness allows you to inhabit Mind at Largepermanently.The opposite of self-awareness is the mechanistic view that a human being is abrain puppet, a subordinate of neural activity. Insofar as psychedelics havemedical uses, we should cheer them on. But Huxley’s insight that Mind at Largeis the real issue still holds true.What separates us from Mind at Large—or metareality—is the thinnest of veils. Ittakes only the merest thought. I found this out recently when I was doing thetree pose with a yoga instructor. The tree pose requires delicate balance on onefoot, and I’ve gotten better at it, but suddenly that morning I began to wobble.Immediately the instructor said, “What were you thinking about?” It was theright question to ask, because I had lost my clear, open state of mind as aresult of a distracting thought (about the medical benefits of psychedelics, asit happens). It takes a clear, open state of mind, uncluttered by randomthoughts, to do a lot more in life than holding a yoga pose. Such clarity iswhat Mind at Large feels like. It is what freedom feels like. It is the door tometahuman.In Part Two, we’ll make everything personal by showing how each person canexperience the shift to Mind at Large. A collective awakening is made possibleonly when individuals wake up—and nothing is more urgent. As a bridge, let meunderscore how extraordinary waking up is, and how unpredictable.Waking up makes us more human and more real at the same time, because we are thespecies of consciousness destined—and designed—to know our source completely. Ifa single vision can unite the human race, this is it."},{"pageContent":"Part Two Waking Up [../images/Chop_9781524762988_epub3_009_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"7 PUTTING EXPERIENCE FIRSTThe punch line to an old joke has gotten embedded in popular culture. As I firstheard it, the joke involves a lost city slicker stopping his car on a countrylane to ask a farmer how to get to a certain town. The farmer scratches his headwith a bewildered look and says, “Sorry, mister, but you can’t get there fromhere.”Why does the joke make us laugh? The humor is rooted in the fact that you canget anywhere on the map from anywhere else. But if the city slicker had askedthe farmer how to get to metareality, he’d have gotten the same answer, onlythis time it wouldn’t be funny—at least not to me.You cannot get to metareality by clinging to virtual reality. The reason forthis has been expressed in various ways ever since Homo sapiens realized thatthere is a dimension of life beyond the everyday. Being stuck in virtual realityis like being under a hypnotic spell, and we can’t break the spell as long as ithas us in its grip—there is no hypnotist standing by who can snap his fingersand break the spell for us. Or we are like dreamers captivated by the dream’sillusions, and we cannot wake up as long as the dream lasts—there is no onestanding beside the bed to shake us awake.Spells, dreams, enchantments, illusions, wizardry and witchcraft, mischievousgods—every culture has invented versions of the same idea that reality isdeceptive. “You can’t get there from here” as long as you are entangled in acomplete, all-enveloping trick of the mind. Figuring out how to wake up,therefore, has been a mysterious business. Up until now.Life proceeds by knowledge and experience, and Part One was all about theknowledge of metareality. So where will the experience come from? Why didn’t wedelve into it first? It’s easy to be impatient (the male sex, in particular, isnotorious for not reading the manual or asking for directions when lost), but inthis case knowledge and experience can’t be separated. You can’t jump into thedeep end of the pool and figure out how to swim. Consciousness must be reframedfrom the ground up; perceptions must shift; interpretations have to beabandoned. Nothing can remain quite the same in the leap from human tometahuman.As all-encompassing as virtual reality is, a loophole exists, which is nothingmore than experience itself. What is an experience? Sailing the Atlantic in aone-man boat is very different from climbing the Alps, commuting to work, orbaking an apple pie, so the face of experience is constantly changing. But atbottom every experience is the same thing—a conscious event. If you make themistake of rooting your experiences in the physical world, you cannot wake upfrom the spell/dream/illusion, because the physical world is thespell/dream/illusion.EXPERIENCING THE WORLDThe only way to break the spell is to reverse the normal explanation of howthings work. By this I mean putting the experience first. The normal explanationis to put things first, which makes common sense. Didn’t the stars exist beforewe came along to gaze at them in the night sky? Without the Earth, which existedin a primordial state before life began, we wouldn’t be here. Or so common sensedictates.Reversing the explanation makes just as much sense, however. Let’s say it ismorning, and you’re reading with a cup of coffee beside you. A “cup of coffee”can mean a physical object fixed, for the moment, in time and space. I’ve put“cup of coffee” in quotation marks because you are actually relating to aso-called object. In reality, you are experiencing a fusion of sensations. Youreyes see color, light, and shade, which you perceive as the cup. Your nosedetects the coffee’s aroma, your hand feels the warmth of the coffee in the cup,your tongue its taste.Take away all these experiences and what happens? There is no cup of coffee.This is a simple, logical conclusion, but if you want to reinforce thespell/dream/illusion, this conclusion is outrageous. A cup of coffee is simplythere, standing in space-time as a physical thing. We’ll leave aside the quantumexplanation that dissolves physical things, including the entire universe, intoinvisible virtual states. Our goal is different here. The reason for making acup of coffee vanish isn’t to prove that it was never there. The reason is toput experience first. What we call a tree, a cloud, a mountain, a star, or a cupof coffee exists only as an experience. Once you accept this fact, the path tometahuman is free and clear.It does little good, however, to shrug your shoulders and say, “All right, Iaccept.” The words are hollow unless there is an “aha,” and you get the point.Experience is how we know anything. If there is a reality beyond humanawareness, by definition we will never know it. Much news has been made incontemporary physics by “dark” matter and energy (which Menas Kafatos and Idiscuss at length in You Are the Universe). What makes some energy and matterdark, if some theories are right, is that they exist outside the boundaries ofthe physical universe. In the dark domain, there may be “stuff” that isn’tatomic in origin, doesn’t emit photons and electrons, and perhaps has norelationship to our version of space and time.Let’s say that all these conjectures are true (there is a chance they aren’t,but we won’t go into the technical reasons for that here). Wouldn’t dark matterand energy, being totally alien to human experience, having nothing in commonwith the “stuff” that constitutes the human brain, qualify as real butimpossible to experience? For that matter, no one can experience the big bang,because it preceded atoms and molecules. No one can dive into a black hole toexperience it, since the extreme gravity in and around a black holedisintegrates matter and tears all ordinary “stuff” apart, including time andspace.For anyone who accepts the universe as it appears, putting experience firstsounds nonsensical—but it isn’t. Dark matter and energy are known throughexperience, as are the big bang, black holes, and all the other exotica ofphysics. In all these cases, the experience is indirect, formulated inmathematical equations, the collection of traces of fleeting subatomicparticles, and the data received by radio telescopes and the like. But no matterhow indirect, it is still an experience. Someone has to see something, if only asheet of paper filled with numbers. Someone has to hear another scientisttalking or read her words. The fact that even the most exotic science isoccurring as conscious experience is undeniable. It levels the playing fieldwith everyday experience, because a first-grader learning his ABCs is having thesame experience as a physicist reading a journal article on quantum gravity.As a specific species of consciousness, Homo sapiens constructed its version ofreality from everyday experiences and built everything up from there. Wehumanized virtual reality according to our experiences. A hot rock in the desertsun that a lizard finds comfortable burns our skin. The darkest midnightfrightens us but makes bats feel right at home, just as shivering heights areperfect nesting places for eagles and the ocean is breathable to fish.But we are not fated to be imprisoned in our experiences. We shape and mold themwith extraordinary freedom. The body looks like a fixed object, but we canstarve it or fatten it up, build its muscles or let them go to flab. Thequestion is just how malleable the whole “thingness” of things really is. Ithink of it as a kind of thawing process. When ice jams break up in spring, theydon’t thaw immediately. There is a transition from a frozen river to a flowingone. The same is true of how we experience the physical world. Instead of beingone big, frozen block, it is reducible to the tiniest experiences, like a rockcliff reduced over time by the pounding sea to fine grains of sand. The fivesenses are exquisitely attuned to fleeting, transient events. I had kept in theback of my mind a small but impressive finding, that the human retina can detecta single photon of light, but recently this isolated piece of data was expandedin quite a startling way.THE QUANTUM BECOMES HUMANWithout achieving widespread popular attention through mass media, research hasverified that at least four of the five senses are actually capable ofexperiencing the quantum domain directly, without the use of sophisticatedscientific instruments. The basic findings, which come from leading universitylaboratories, can be briefly summarized.SIGHT: The human eye, as just mentioned, can detect a single photon. This is thesmallest unit of light in the universe, and our ability to detect a photon hasinspired researchers to explore whether they can probe the quantum world withthe naked eye.HEARING: The inner ear is so sensitive that it can detect vibrations less thanthe diameter of an atom. It can distinguish sounds that are only ten millionthsof a second apart.SMELL: It was previously estimated that the human olfactory system could detectten thousand distinct smells, but the latest research suggests that smell is aquantum sense that can distinguish a trillion different inputs.TOUCH: We can detect tactile sensations down to one billionth of a meter.TASTE: This sense hasn’t been traced to the quantum level, but it is alreadyknown that the human tongue detects the five tastes (sweet, salty, sour, bitter,and umami, or savory) at the molecular level. Taste requires smell todistinguish at a finer level, so even taste, when combined with smell, isinvolved in quantum detection.Why did evolution give us this micro-sensitivity? To answer this question, youhave to appreciate the enormous leap that the new research has taken.Previously, the five senses were thought to operate on the molecular level, liketaste. To tell the difference between salty and sweet, for example, thereceptors in your taste buds are designed to latch on to the specific moleculeof each. Physically, the accepted view has been that we interact with the worldthrough a myriad of similar receptors on the outer membrane of cells. Thesereceptors have been described as keyholes into which very specific molecules(the keys) fit. To smell a rose, for example, molecules of its scent driftthrough the air and fit into the receptors of olfactory cells in the nose.Because this process occurs at the molecular level, even primitive organisms arephysically micro-sensitive.The most ancient sense is touch, which evolved in single-celled organisms thatrespond to being touched, like the amoeba, as well as some plants; the Venusflytrap closes its jawlike leaves on its prey when an insect touches thesensitive hairs that line the leaf. But despite being the oldest sense, touch isnot yet fully understood. Cameras and listening devices can duplicate thesensitivity of our eyes and ears, but we can tell the difference between wood,metal, and glass by touching them, beyond what engineers can do artificially.The fact that our fingers are sensitive down to a single molecule was onlyrecently proved by experimenters at the University of California–San Diego.They took fifteen people and gave them three silicon wafers to touch, askingthem which of the three felt different from the other two. The wafers wereidentical except for the top layer, which was a single molecule thick. Onesurface had an oxidized top layer that was mostly oxygen, the other was coatedwith a Teflon-like substance. Participants were able to pick out the differentwafer 71 percent of the time.Yet even molecules are massive compared with quanta, and the eye’s sensitivityto a quantum of light led scientists to consider the other four senses. It nowseems that the entire body is a quantum detector. At first sight this seemsremarkable—it certainly expands human perception far beyond previous estimates.At a deeper level, however, these findings indicate how we design and controlthe constructs of virtual reality. Through the body’s quantum detectors, we areseamlessly woven into the universe at the finest level. No longer simplyreceiving raw data from the world “out there,” our bodies participate at thecrux where mind and matter mingle.Getting down to the nub of how we physically see, hear, touch, taste, and smellsays nothing about what the five senses are for. Earlier on (this page[Chop_9781524762988_epub3_c002_r1.xhtml#page_14]), I compared the retina’sresponse to light with a Geiger counter clicking every time it is bombarded withbeta particles and gamma rays. But a Geiger counter doesn’t experience the worldas we do. The sensitivity of our quantum detectors indicates how finelycalibrated our experiences actually are. Previously, the fact that we arefine-tuned to the molecular level led to remarkable feats of perception beforethe recent quantum discoveries.Professional noses in the perfume industry go far beyond the ordinary sense ofsmell, being able to distinguish dozens of different rose scents, for example,but the experts don’t necessarily have super-refined olfactory nerves or more ofthem than the rest of us. They’ve trained their awareness of aromas. The sameholds true for professional wine tasters in the area of taste and marksmen inthe area of sight. These people may start out with more acute senses than theaverage person, but a wine taster or a marksman doesn’t need an overabundance ofcell receptors. With a normal range of receptors, wine tasters sharpen theirperceptivity, which is mental.So-called supertasters have thirty taste buds in a specified area of the tongue,compared with average tasters who have between fifteen and thirty taste buds inthe same area, while so-called nontasters (a better term would be dull tasters)have fewer than fifteen. Average tasters can improve their discernment of wineby using their noses more, paying closer attention, and slowing down to savorthe taste. It is certainly relevant that between the ages of forty and sixty westart to lose taste buds, and the remaining ones shrink. But that’s not enoughto explain why older people often lose interest in eating. There may be ageneral loss of interest in life, or feeling alone and unwanted. The simple factthat some babies are born without a sense of taste but grow up to have healthyappetites points to the mental component that dominates our sensory existence.The data derived from measurements of how the eye, ear, or tongue works saynothing about our actual experience: how a sunset looks, how music sounds, andhow chocolate tastes. Science is about measuring life in all its quantities,large and small. Experience is about life in all its qualities, which cannot becounted. The question “How many units of beauty did you experience today?” isnonsensical. Beauty is experienced subjectively, which no one disputes. Butevery perception is also experienced subjectively, which is where the huge gapoccurs that I mentioned above. There is a total mismatch between a measurementof wavelengths of light and the qualities of light, particularly colors.Color is created in consciousness by crossing the gap between quantity andquality. In this crossing, a magic trick takes place by which quantum vibrationsare transformed into not just colors but everything delivered by the fivesenses. It would be convenient if the new research explained how that trick isdone, but it doesn’t. Pinpointing the five senses down to the quantum level islike having a dog’s sense of hearing, which extends far above human hearing. Ifyou suddenly woke up and heard the world as a dog does, this wouldn’t explainmusic or speech or anything else about hearing as an experience. The ear doesn’thear; the mind does.But at least we have an important clue about the magic trick that turns quantumevents into human experiences. By taking perception down to the quantum level,we can say—or at least strongly suppose—that we live at the very level wherenature transforms virtual reality into the solid physical world. Here I’m usingvirtual in a specific way. In physics there is a halfway house where particlesare invisible and have no fixed location.This halfway house was needed because of the famous uncertainty principle, whichsays that particles are actually the collapse of energy waves. Waves extendinfinitely in all directions; particles exist in one place in time and space. Avirtual particle bridges the two states. It hasn’t quite yet assumed the shapeof a particle, but it isn’t a wave extending in every direction, either.It is very important to know, as we now do, that human experience doesn’t haveto wait for the physical world to appear; we are able to perceive the birth ofparticles, physically speaking. I’m being quite literal here. For decades the“collapse of the wave” function has been hotly debated in physics. The mainpoint of controversy is that standard quantum theory holds that it takes anobserver to cause the collapse. This point rankles some physicists and bafflesalmost everyone else. It is taken for granted in daily life that observingsomething is a passive act. “Look but don’t touch,” we tell our children. Yet atthe quantum level, looking is as good as touching. A particle stops beinguncertain when an observer is present. The wave function collapses and, voilà, aparticle can be detected.I hope this abbreviated explanation makes sense; going into the details leads toa tangle of complications. Suffice it to say that researchers are seriouslyconsidering whether this mysterious effect on the quantum, known as the“observer effect,” can be explained through quantum detection. If our eyes arephysically interacting with quanta, this helps us to understand that observationwas never passive. We have been participating at the place where virtual realitygets an opportunity to create physical reality.HOW THE MIND GIVES THINGS THEIR THINGNESSThe new findings don’t explain the magic trick that occurs in the gap betweenquantity—things to be measured and counted—and qualities, the sights, sounds,tastes, textures, and smells that we experience as human beings. Humanizing thequantum is exciting, but human beings don’t experience the world through amicroscopic level of differences, even though we theoretically could. Instead,we lump experiences together according to useful concepts like color. Red isred, not every different vibration in the wavelengths of light between 630 and700 nanometers (a nanometer is one billionth of a meter).Likewise, sweet is sweet, not the molecular interaction between sugar moleculesand receptors on the tongue. We are so used to the clumping process that wedon’t catch ourselves doing anything. But we are constantly taking transientexperiences, cramming them into prearranged slots, turning discontinuity intocontinuity, and making solid what is actually fluid.The technical term for what’s happening is reification—giving immaterialexperiences “thingness.” So convincing is this transformation that rocks seemsolid and heavy when, in fact, your mind reified them—you have created solidityand heaviness in your own awareness. This constitutes another outrageousconclusion to anyone who is out to reinforce and reaffirm thespell/dream/illusion. But you cannot thaw out the “thingness” of the physicalworld unless you break down the process that created it. I’m hesitant to use anykind of jargon, but we need to delve into how reification works.The dictionary definition of reify is “to make something more concrete or real.”The mental image of money gets reified into a dollar bill, which you can fold upand stick in your wallet. “Parenting” gets reified when you decide to have ababy you can hold in your arms. What’s earthshaking is that virtual reality owesits existence entirely to reification.The web of connections that entangles everything in the spell/dream/illusionwith everything else comes down to the mind, because connections are mind-made.No object is actually a physical thing, pure and simple. “Object” and “thing”and “physical” are strands of a mental web.People find it relatively easy to accept that a piece of paper currency is thereified form of a concept (money), but they balk when they are told that thesame is true of body, brain, and universe. The key is to reverse the wholeprocess of reification, bringing physical objects closer to reality. As you nowview them, the bones in your arm are solid and fixed; it’s hard to accept thatthey are fluid and malleable. But all physical objects are actually processes inmotion. Bones are no exception; they constantly exchange a stream of oxygen andcalcium at the molecular level. Each bone cell is an activity of life in motion.If you wear shoes that are ill-fitting, your leg bones will gradually bend toconform to your lopsided gait.The fact that a process is slow or fast doesn’t make a difference to the basicreality that things are processes. Broken bones heal more slowly than a cutfinger, but the very fact that healing occurs testifies to the body being aprocess. Bone cancer is much feared because it is so painful, but in theirnormal healthy state, nerves connect your bones to the brain and then to theoutside world. By clumping together all the fleeting sensations you are havingright now, you seem to have a body that is fixed, but in reality your body todayisn’t the body you had as a newborn, toddler, or adolescent; it isn’t even thebody you had yesterday or five minutes ago.It’s surprisingly easy, then, to reverse the habit of thinking that reifies thebody, turning a myriad of interconnected processes into a thing. This reversalhelps to get us back to where creation originates, in consciousness alone. Whenyou master the reversal, you can undo anything in virtual reality by tracing itback to the mind’s creative genius. This is what it means to thaw out“thingness”: objects are reduced to a level of consciousness where we can beginto experience the creative process. As you come closer to pure consciousness,the thawing process become easier and faster. As “thingness” stops being sostubborn, experience is transformed into something fluid, flexible, andmalleable. The reality of the “true self” is critical, because, as things stand,everyone has a self filled with contradictions. The self you have beenidentifying with keeps you in the spell/dream/illusion. The true self takes youfrom illusion to reality.THREE VERSIONS OF THE SELFThe true self lies hidden behind layers of disguise. The layers are so thickthat no one can confidently define what the self actually is. “Self” is aconvenient fiction, lumping together a jumble of beliefs, experiences, oldconditioning, and secondhand opinions. This is a greater problem than you’dimagine. For almost everyone, there is a wide gap between “being yourself” and“knowing yourself.” The first is considered desirable. When you are able to beyourself, you feel natural and relaxed, without pretense or defenses. Knowingyourself is a different matter. A century after Freud discovered thesubconscious mind, it has been identified with the dark side of human nature. Werepress our urges of anger, anxiety, envy, insecurity, and even violence. Ofcourse you cannot get along with other people if you say everything you think oract on your every impulse.But there’s more to it. When the inner world is identified with the dark side,people don’t want to look there. They dislike and fear what they find, or mightfind. We identify with the ego-personality, which presents the self we want theworld to see, and we ignore the opportunity to explore what a deeper self mightbe. In time, countless people actually believe that their ego-personality istheir real self. Yet there are two more selves we all possess, and they arenothing to fear. In fact, they are the richest sources of human fulfillment.The first is the unconscious self. Even though we routinely shove negativeemotions and impulses out of sight in the subconscious, the whole story is muchmore positive. The unconscious self is creative and sensitive. When you walkinto a room where two people have been arguing or someone was crying, yousilently sense it “in the air.” Actually, you are sensing it through yourunconscious self. At the level below everyday awareness, you constantly perceiveyour surroundings. You also have the power of intuition in your unconsciousself. You gain “aha” moments when the unconscious self reveals something to youthat your conscious mind didn’t realize.As you grow to maturity, you begin to value what is rooted in the unconscious.You feel confident, self-reliant, and sure of what you know. You know how to docertain things—cooking, driving, balancing your checkbook, finding a goodrestaurant. But at a deeper level you have a settled feeling that is hard toexplain. Paying attention to all of your life experiences, your unconscious selfdistills the essence of your life into the experience of inner fulfillment,which over time becomes a natural part of who you are. You know yourself as aset of values, purposes, and achievements. There are countless people who do notarrive at this stage, and they don’t know the experience of inner fulfillment.Nor can it be imparted, because so much happens out of sight in the unconscious.T. S. Eliot comes to mind once again. In 1925 he wrote “The Hollow Men,” a poemthat high schoolers used to love to recite, because adolescence is marked byhidden fears. The first verse begins:> We are the hollow men> > We are the stuffed men> > Leaning together> > Headpiece filled with straw. Alas!> > Our dried voices, when> > We whisper together> > Are quiet and meaningless> > As wind in dry grass.Writing in 1925, Eliot is exploring one of our deepest fears, that life can turnmeaningless, haunted by death and nothingness—the ultimate hollowness. In timesof great peril and horror, as in the two world wars of the twentieth century,the dread of losing all meaning feels very real. Yet the unconscious self,drawing on reserves of infinite meaning, re-creates the world in a new image,one that is livable despite all terror and horror in the past.There is yet another self, however, and it is even more valuable—call it the“true self.” This is a level of awareness very close to our source in pureconsciousness. Pure consciousness is silent and still. It has the potential formental activity before any activity arises. I identify it with the simplest ofall experiences, the pure “I am” of existence. This is the simplest of allexperiences because it requires no thought. You know that you exist; that’s all.As the still silence of “I am” starts to vibrate into thoughts, images,feelings, and sensations, the first stirrings are very faint and subtle. Theyare highly fluid and malleable, which is why desires and intentions that comefrom our deepest source are not distorted by all the cruder desires of the ego.“I want peace” is a subtler, finer desire than “I want a Porsche.”At the level of the true self, all desire for change reaches its goal, becauseonly here is “I am” enough to bring total fulfillment. No external gratificationcompares with this. It seems strange on the face of it that the mind at itssubtlest level should be more fulfilled than the mind at more superficiallevels. Chasing worldly desires is what life is all about to the vast majorityof people. Being still and quiet, by the same token, feels very uncomfortablefor many. “There’s nothing to do,” we complain. Yet stillness can unlock newrealities. The key is that pure consciousness contains infinite resources ofcreativity, bliss, intelligence, love, and awareness. By living close to thesource, you have access to this infinite potential that allows you to be agenuine co-creator of reality.I’ve put these three selves—the ego-personality, the unconscious self, and thetrue self—into separate categories only for the purpose of description. In dailylife we call on all three. As awareness rises from its source, any impulse hasan unconscious component and eventually an ego component. A common example isfriendship that turns to romantic love. Two friends interact largely on an egolevel, meaning that they present their social persona to each other. But asfriendship deepens, the unconscious reveals itself more intimately, andsometimes, if the two people feel safe enough, the true core of friendship,which is love, reveals itself. That seems to be the final goal, but at the levelof the true self, no other person is needed. “I am” already has the quality oflove, trembling on the edge of pure consciousness.What this comes down to is that the self you identify with is simply the selfyou are aware of. There is no fixed self, just as there is no fixed body.Fighting for your place in line at the post office calls up the ego-personality.Feeling tenderness toward a baby calls up the unconscious personality. Feelingthat you matter in the great scheme of things calls up the true self.At a certain point, the true self dominates the scene, and when this changeoccurs, the world changes as well. The world feels hard, fixed, stubborn, andinflexible if you are all those things. The ego-personality finds it easier toresist than to accept, to hold on rather than to let go. So being hard, fixed,stubborn, and inflexible isn’t rare, and seeing the world the same way isn’trare, either. If someone explores more deeply and begins to identify with theunconscious self, then the world seems beautiful, fresh, renewed, and filledwith light. This, too, is a reflection of the person’s state of awareness. Lookat the glowing light in French impressionist paintings and you’ll see where sucha state of awareness leads painters.Yet you must go deeper to see the world in complete purity. This state, knowngenerally as “enlightenment,” represents direct contact with metareality. Sinceour daily life is dominated by the ego’s desires, needs, and demands, it isn’tpossible to conceive of what it feels like to experience metareality as aconstant state. Let me give a striking example in the thinking and teaching ofKrishna Menon, born in 1883 in the South Indian state of Kerala. Althoughobscure most of his life—Menon died in 1959—he has come to be regarded asextremely important among seekers who want to investigate the experience ofenlightenment (as opposed to the veneration of gurus and spiritual teachers,which has a major religious component).The uncompromising nature of his awareness can be gleaned by reading the answersthat Krishna Menon, later known to his followers as Sri Atmananda, gave whenquestions were posed to him. Time and again he took every subject back to oneessential question: What is reality? Here are some succinct examples:On pleasure and pain. I feel pleasure at one moment and pain at another. But Iam changeless all along. Thus my pleasure and pain are not part of my realnature.How are physical objects related to thoughts? The question arises on theassumption that objects exist independent of thoughts. That is never the case.Without thought, there is no object.Should we follow a personal God? I say no, because a personal God is nothing buta concept. Truth is beyond all concepts.Such unshakable certainty feels liberating and audacious at the same time. Butit’s clear that Menon was not speaking merely to draw attention to himself; hewas speaking from the perspective of the true self, once the ego-personality andthe fragmented mind it creates have been abandoned. This is made evident inanother question and answer.Q: Is reality indivisible?A: Reality is only one and cannot be affected by quality or degree in any way.Reality is purely subjective. I am the only subject, and all the rest areobjects. Diversity can be diversity only through me, the “One.”You have to reach the end of this answer to discover that far from being anexpression of solipsism (“I am the only subject, and all the rest are objects”),Menon’s viewpoint reflects his sense of wholeness (the One). This way ofspeaking echoes an Indian tradition going back thousands of years, known asAdvaita, which in Sanskrit means “not-two.” One could also call it theperspective of the whole mind, because the primary purpose of Advaita (andmetahuman) is to get people to identify with consciousness as a whole, insteadof its fragmented products.I’ve come to the point where I hesitate to adopt spiritual language, preferringto see the inner journey as an escape from illusion to reality. The questionstill lingers: If Menon, along with others who are called enlightened, are soexceptional, do they stand too far outside the norm? I say no. The process ofwaking up is natural; anyone can do it. The proof of this is right before oureyes. Every day we follow the guidance of the ego-personality, the unconsciousself, and the true self in a kind of jumble. But the very fact that the trueself is speaking to us in moments of love, joy, creativity, and renewal, even ifonly in fits and starts, indicates that we are in touch with metareality.Knowing that the connection exists, the whole process of waking up can beexplored in an organized way. How this is done is the subject of the nextchapter in our journey."},{"pageContent":"8 GOING BEYOND ALL STORIESIf metareality is “everywhere, always, and everything,” a startling factfollows. There is no story we can tell about it. All the elements of a story—abeginning, a plot, various characters, and an ending—have no bearing. Yeteverything else in the world is organized around these elements. You are acharacter in your own story, which had birth as its beginning, death as itsending, and all kinds of plot twists and incidental characters along the way.The prospect of giving up your story is all but unthinkable—yet it is totallynecessary in order to experience metareality. We even have to give up mystical,religious, and spiritual stories, too, because they turn pure consciousness intosomething it isn’t, whether that something is the Old Testament God or Nirvanaor a pantheon of gods and goddesses. I appreciate that these have been a guidinglight for centuries. Isolated messengers have always existed to point to anotherworld, bringing inspiring stories with them.In his depictions of the Madonna and Child, Leonardo da Vinci followed thetraditional story that St. John as a boy was a childhood companion of Jesus.Leonardo (and other Renaissance painters) show him enigmatically pointing upwardwith one finger, a smile playing beatifically across his face. Heaven—can’t yousee it? Just there, the smile says.Those who wake up see the transcendent world directly. The time frame ofeternity becomes natural and is felt as a seamless flow. The Buddha once said(in a translation by Sogyal Rinpoche), “This existence of ours is as transientas autumn clouds. To watch the birth and death of beings is like looking at themovements of a dance. A lifetime is like a flash of lightning in the sky,rushing by like a torrent down a steep mountain.”In every spiritual tradition, such messages have beckoned believers to atranscendent world, but all have failed to convince the average person thatgoing beyond should be the focus of daily life. At no point in history didwaking up go viral. Somewhere in the evolution of consciousness, Homo sapienscame to a fork in the road. Collectively, we could have identified with the trueself or else we could have identified with “I,” the ego-personality. Obviously,we took the second road. Metareality didn’t abandon us; we abandoned it.This made all the difference in how we see ourselves. The true self is connectedto its source in pure consciousness. The ego-personality has its source only inthe stories it imagines and believes in. Modern people have jettisonedmythology, and many are rejecting organized religion. But at every level, ourlives are still shaped by stories invented by human imagination. The other road,which led to the true self, gained a reputation for being mystical (i.e.,detached from real life), and once this happened, only a motley crew of saints,sages, poets, artists, and seers followed that path.Finding metareality is an impossible task until you question your own story. Youmust take the challenge personally, because becoming metahuman is real only ifit is real for you. If you are fully aware of what is happening to you here andnow, you have gone beyond all stories. The habit of constantly adding to yourstory is just that, a habit. By itself, the present moment has no story—it justis. Why do we embellish it with our story? Because the present moment isn’tfulfilling by itself until it gets enriched by the true self. A computer isuseless until you plug it in, and although we use our minds for everythingalready, much time is lost in fantasy, distractions, avoidance, denial,procrastination, self-judgment, and on and on. Every story contains theseundesirable elements. Staying connected to the true self at every moment bringsthe fullness of life into our awareness.Metahuman could be called a new story, another fiction added to the shelf, but Ithink that would be a misnomer. The element of fiction is taken out when youwake up. As part of the spell/dream/illusion, our personal stories can’t dowithout the fictional element. Virtual reality is a fiction to begin with.Anything based on it participates in unreality. We might pity our ancestors fortheir attachment to myths, superstition, and unproven religious beliefs. But ifwe are immersed in a better story, it’s still a story. Future generations won’tbuy into it any more than we buy into Zeus, witches, and the heart as the seatof intelligence rather than the brain (a persistent belief in ancient Greek andRoman medicine).This chapter is about a turning point where we stop telling ourselves stories,no longer needing them to defend us against harsh reality or to make sense outof a chaotic world. In metareality you go beyond danger and disorder. The trueself gives you an unshakable stance in reality, at which point your life findspurpose and meaning from the source instead of from a cobbled-together fiction.CLINGING TO STORIESHumans are proud to be storytellers, and our story has a gaping hole because norecord was left from the oldest times, before writing emerged. Can we imagine somany lost stories? Around 45,000 years ago, people we’d recognize as modern Homosapiens started to migrate northward from Africa. All were hunter-gatherers.Many generations before farming, mining for metals, and fixed dwellings heraldedthe rise of civilization, life 45,000 years ago was already too complex to dowithout stories. In the human mind, fire had to come from somewhere, rain had tobe unpredictable for a reason, and things we now take for granted, like a chickhatching out of an egg, posed a deep mystery. Mythology arose not as fantasy butas the best way to explain Nature, given the life people were leading. Ascribingmeaning to anything and everything is the thread that binds us to earliesthumans. Stories explain how life works and thus fulfill a need that is woveninto the fabric of being human.We still live by stories, and whatever disrupts our personal story is usuallyrejected out of hand or fought against vigorously. (Witness the guiltiest sexualabusers coming to light through the #MeToo movement, abusers who flatly deny anywrongdoing.) We’ve already discussed how the ego creates the illusion of beingseparate and alone. “I” needs a good story to feel safe, important, sociallyacceptable, and worthy. Seeking to feel secure, people want to belong tosomething larger than themselves—a tribe, a religion, a race, a nation—but to beaccepted by any of these groups, you first must accept their story. Withoutthinking about the freedom they are surrendering, people adopt a secondhand,sealed-off story. You know instantly who is “us” and who is “them.” Yet nomatter how convincing the story, you will always be “them” to people embedded inanother story. The security to be found in something larger than yourself breaksdown when “they” turn into a threat, even an enemy of your very survival.Stories grow out of such basic needs that going beyond any story feelsimpossible. A story consists of anything the human mind can imagine, which leadsto infinite choices. But we can simplify the matter. Stories are aboutattachment. We think to ourselves, “I am X,” and then we cling to X as part ofour identity.X can be the larger group (tribe, race, nation, religion) mentioned above. “I amAmerican” has enormous power over people, as does “I am French” or “I am Jewish”or “I am white.” But in seeing this, which most people do, we are onlyscratching the surface. Any version of “I am X” can lead to clinging andattachment. “I am a Patriots fan” or “I am upper middle class” createspassionate attachments. At the same time, stories become more potent by whatthey exclude. For every “I am X,” there are many possibilities of “I am not Y.”If you are American, you are not every other nationality, of which there arehundreds. If you are Catholic, you exclude all other faiths, and so on.What’s wrong with this? If stories were held lightly, the way we experience TheHobbit or The Great Gatsby, being diverted for a while before moving on, vexingproblems wouldn’t arise. It’s not the story that is responsible; it’s ourattachment to it. Attachment falsifies experience by freezing it in place. Theweight of the past becomes a burden. The present moment is lost in the clutterof memory, belief, and old conditioning. How many older people crave to be youngagain? How many regrets do we harbor that we refuse to let go of? Theseattachments exist in everyone’s life, leaving aside the misery and violencecreated by an us-versus-them mentality.Prying someone loose from a cherished story lies at the heart of one of the mostpopular best sellers in the 1980s, M. Scott Peck’s The Road Less Traveled. Thebook begins with a gripping sentence: “Life is difficult.” Immediately, Peckexpands on what he means: “This is a great truth, one of the greatest truths. Itis a great truth because once we truly see this truth, we transcend it…[and] thefact that life is difficult no longer matters.”In other words, we are hearing the call to go beyond. But Peck, who was apsychiatrist, knew that just because a truth is great doesn’t mean people canface it—quite the opposite. In his view, after years of treating patients intherapy, the biggest obstacle to getting better his patients faced was theirrefusal to take responsibility. Why? “We cannot solve life’s problems except bysolving them,” Peck writes. Yet this fact “is seemingly beyond the comprehensionof much of the human race….Many, so many, seek to avoid the pain of theirproblems by saying to themselves: ‘This problem was caused by other people, orby social circumstances beyond my control, and therefore it is up to otherpeople to solve this problem for me.’ ”Peck gives vivid examples to illustrate his point, such as the case of a womanwho had just tried to slash her wrists. She was an army wife on the Pacificisland of Okinawa, where the younger Peck was an army psychiatrist.In the emergency room he asked the woman, who had managed to inflict onlysuperficial cuts on herself, why she wanted to commit suicide. She said it allcame down to living “on this dumb island.” Not satisfied with her answer, Peckbegan a dialogue that would be comical if the woman weren’t so miserable andunhappy. The back-and-forth between him and his patient can be summarized asfollows:PECK: Why do you find being on Okinawa so painful?PATIENT: I have no friends, and I’m alone all the time.PECK: Why don’t you have any friends?PATIENT: I live off base in the village, and nobody speaks English.PECK: Why don’t you drive to the American base to find some friends?PATIENT: My husband needs the car to drive to work.PECK: You could drive him to work.PATIENT: It’s a stick shift. I only know how to drive an automatic.PECK: You could learn to drive a stick shift.PATIENT: Are you crazy? Not on these roads.What made the scene tragic and comical at the same time is that the woman,despite her absurd stubbornness, was in genuine pain; she was crying during mostof their conversation. We all believe in our story, almost at any cost. From atherapist’s perspective this woman was skirting any hope of getting better byexhibiting all the classic signs of denial. Who among us hasn’t shut our eyeswhen a situation was simply too hard to face? Life would be much easier if ourproblems had cut-and-dried solutions, but they don’t.Denial is only one element in the big picture, which is that we live by stories.Denial comes down to ignoring anything that disrupts your story or contradictsit. Even the healthiest person psychologically ignores an enormous part ofreality. If we see, once and for all, that being attached to stories is what wewant to overcome, we recognize that there are people who have done just that.Their inner world isn’t cluttered with the baggage of the past. They don’tdefend “I am X” as if their survival depended on it. Rather, they liveeffortlessly in the present. The real issue isn’t whether such people exist; thereal issue is why we have ignored them for so long.THE AWAKENEDStates of awareness long considered mystical in the West—if not bogus—exist allaround us, affecting ordinary people who almost always keep their experiencesprivate. A few years ago I became acquainted with Dr. Jeffery Martin, a PhDsocial researcher who had conducted groundbreaking research into higherconsciousness. What made his studies revolutionary is a single basic discovery:many more people are awake than anyone ever supposed.Martin gave them a voice. After gaining his doctorate at Harvard’s School ofEducation, he started publishing his findings, which indicated the prevalence ofenlightenment as a natural state of awareness, one that many people have alreadyaccessed. Martin’s research began with him posting an online query asking forresponses from people who thought they were enlightened.To his surprise, he got more than 2,500 replies, and from this pool Martinintensively interviewed around 50 subjects. At first it was hard to find acommon language. Feeling that you are enlightened is personal, and it also setsyou apart from normal society. Martin’s subjects were sensitized by beingoutsiders, often being stigmatized in adolescence for being different. They alsoknew on the inside that they weren’t normal according to the social standardsaround them. For many, revealing their unusual mental state had led to suchthings as being sent to a psychiatrist, put on medication, or even beingcommitted to a mental hospital.However, very early on, Martin realized that as different as each of hissubjects was, their experiences fell on a continuum. There wasn’t a singleenlightened state, but rather a sliding scale. To find some common ground, andto fit the accepted model of what doctoral research in psychology must looklike, he dropped the loaded term enlightenment, and in its place adopted thecumbersome tag persistent non-symbolic experience. When someone begins to havesuch experiences, “[t]here is a shift in what it feels like to be you,” Martinnotes. “You move away from an individual sense of self, which is considerednormal, to something else.”Defining what that “something else” is wasn’t easy, because these people camefrom different backgrounds and were influenced by diverse cultural factors.However, Martin was able to identify specific areas that seemed to stand out asmarkers of higher consciousness.Typically these people said they had lost a sense of being a separate self—theyhad no lingering notion of personal identity. Putting himself in his subjects’shoes, Martin comments, “I would be saying, ‘There’s no Jeffery here talking toyou.’ That’s literally what they would say to me.”Another common experience was a dramatic reduction in thinking. “In fact,”Martin says, “they would often report having no thoughts.” This wasn’t literallytrue, as Martin discovered when he did further research, but as a self-report,having no thoughts at all is startling. Another common experience was a sense ofunity, oneness, and wholeness. This state of completeness, Martin says, led to atremendous sense of personal freedom. “There’s a loss of fear that comes withthis, a loss of identification with a personal story.” Many felt that theirbodies were no longer bounded by the skin but extended beyond the physical body.So now we have an objective profile of shifting into higher consciousness ineveryday life, the state of metahuman. Personal awakening isn’t rare, andaccording to those who have actually experienced it, their awakening led to awide range of possibilities. The implications for human nature are intriguing,beginning with what it feels like not to defend “I, me, and mine.” The source ofso much anger, fear, greed, and jealousy is rooted in the insecurity of the egoand its endless demands.Putting ourselves in their shoes, these awakened people don’t keep a runningstory in their heads about what’s happening to “me.” When they think aboutthemselves, “me” fades away as soon as they notice it. The same is true fortheir emotions, which are fewer and more spontaneous. When anger arises, itfades almost immediately. Emotions were still positive and negative but rarely,if ever, were they extreme. Martin’s subjects could be irritated when somethingbad happened at work, yet they didn’t carry the residue of stress around withthem afterward, and it would never build into angry frustration. They felt asense of inner peace that could be interrupted, but quite soon it would return.In a word, these people were very good at letting go.To bring order to his findings, Martin divided the awakened state into several“locations” as separate stages of awakening, according to their intensity. Hissubjects regarded waking up as a definite shift, which for some occurred asrecently as six months previously, for others as long as forty years before.Once they arrived in Location 1, as Martin calls the opening stage of awakening,people usually kept progressing and rarely slipped back or jumped ahead. Inother words, they were experiencing personal evolution, and the process showedno prospect of stopping. As Martin described their attitude, they “agreed thattheir initial transition was just the beginning of a process that seemed to beable to unfold, and deepen, endlessly—a never-ending adventure.” Everythinghappened internally, and for many the shift wasn’t something they would defineas spiritual. It was just the way they experienced themselves.“If you sat in a roomful of people and a small percentage belong to this alteredsense of self,” says Martin, “you wouldn’t be able to spot them. To all outerappearances they are just like you and me.”So who exactly are these people? At the outset, before Martin’s research beganto expand to many universities and countries, his typical subject was a whitemale from the United States or Europe. Martin was disappointed to find thatwomen, for unknown reasons, were not eager to volunteer as enlightened or todiscuss their experiences of “waking up.” Religious backgrounds were diverse,spanning Eastern and Western faiths, yet most of the subjects had done some kindof spiritual practice—they wanted to be in a higher state of consciousness.Curiously, around 14 percent had done nothing of this kind. They hadspontaneously popped into higher consciousness or, more typically, drifted intoit.Martin’s research base has expanded to more than a thousand subjects, whichmeans we must ask ourselves if “normal” awareness isn’t a fixed state at all buta spectrum, with consciousness evolving much further than anyone has previouslypredicted. At the very least, higher consciousness has become much less exotic.It’s no longer the province of sadhus and yogis in the Himalayas.When we communicated by email and later met in person, I accepted why Martin,for academic reasons, had to remain value-neutral. But waking up has forcenturies been associated with bliss, for example, or communication with higherbeings like angels, or feeling a divine presence. Was all of that absent whenmodern people woke up? Martin assured me that “outside” phenomena were present,but he felt constrained not to mention them in his doctoral thesis. He foundthat the spiritual dimension of some of his subjects had also opened up. Some ofthe people he tested reported the kind of open, clear, silent awarenessassociated with Buddhism. Still others, however, had no idea what to make oftheir state of awareness.In later reports Martin notes that a small number of his subjects hadexperiences that defy normal explanations. A small number “experience a deepbliss sensation all through their body, including during moments that wouldotherwise be physically painful. For some this seems to bring pain tolerancesthat appear infinite. A few of [them] have reported experiences that should haveinvolved horrific amounts of pain, but only resulted in bliss. Others whoexperience ongoing bliss find that they can reach its limits. They report athreshold, unique to each individual, above which pain is experienced.”It turns out, as his researches deepened, that Martin discovered more and moreuniqueness among these people. Beyond Location 4 a few progressed as far asLocation 9, for example. In that location, Martin notes, people would “saysomething like ‘it feels like it is just the universe looking out these eyes.’ ”But generally speaking, all of his subjects were amazed at the amount ofwell-being they were experiencing, and this grew as they moved further along thespectrum. Paradoxically, in Location 4, all emotion fell away, even love, whichMartin associates with a larger shift—the self that was built up through acontinuous story (he calls this the Narrative-Self) falls away, along withsocially defined emotions. After Location 4, emotions begin to return in adifferent form, based on the foundation of continuous well-being. Yet evenbefore this return, his subjects reported that they didn’t miss the experienceof emotions, because in freedom they had found the highest state of well-being.TEACHING PEOPLE TO WAKE UPMartin had made what he considered “the fundamental discovery that these werepsychological states that had been identified and adopted for thousands of yearsby many cultures and belief systems.” In the present climate, whereconsciousness is an exploding growth field, the real issue isn’t skepticism. Inone survey, one-third of American adults believe in things widely consideredfringe or New Age, from reincarnation and the paranormal to medical applicationslong opposed by mainstream medicine. (According to various sources, betweenone-third and 38 percent of American adults use alternative medicine. Thisincludes the 30 million, for example, who visit chiropractors every year.)Martin was not unique in saying that higher consciousness wasn’t “inherentlyspiritual or religious, or limited to any given culture or population.” Givenhis academic and technical bent, he decided to put his data to work. He siftedout the techniques that his subjects considered the most powerful in gettingthem to arrive at higher consciousness, and he organized these into afifteen-week Finders course. What’s fascinating is that the students would beordinary people who, for whatever reason, were attracted to take the course.Three participants gathered at the website Reality Sandwich to report on theirexperience: Catherine, a business and leadership consultant from Paris; Paul,the co-owner and manager of a garden center in Wales; and Rebekah, a semiretiredphotographer from Texas.Each had different reasons for taking the course. Paul described a period ofpersonal difficulties. “I’d become disconnected, disillusioned, mostly due tophysical and material matters. I had a very spiritual upbringing, but I seemedto have lost the plot altogether.” His general state was “not quite suicidal,but about as low as I could possibly be.”Catherine had heard about Martin’s research and was intrigued by the possibilityof higher states of consciousness. It particularly interested her that thesestates could be specially described—“It’s not just nirvana all day long. Myobjective was to go through the experience and to reach higher states ofwell-being and quiet.”Rebekah had no prior expectations. “[I] did not know what to expect, just opento whatever.” But she had heard about Martin’s research projects, and said, “Itrusted the science in them.” She also knew what she wanted out of the course.“My goal was spiritual evolution. How can I raise my consciousness to a higherlevel?”The methods presented to them were highly intensive, amounting to two to threehours a day, which they were expected to keep up when they went back to theireveryday lives. The instruction consisted of a weekly video about what theparticipants would be doing for the following week. Before the next video, asCatherine describes it, “[y]ou do a summary of the week. How do you feel? Whathas happened to you? How many times a day did you do the different activities?”There was meditation and also group discussion. Some exercises came straightfrom standard therapy, such as writing down and forgiving people from your pastwho had wronged you.At the core of the course, however, was Martin’s eight-year research into peoplewho considered themselves enlightened. He gave each a questionnaire about whichpractices they found most useful in their journey, leading to a wealth of data.“We looked at all of that, and only a handful of things rose to the top. Some ofthem were across all traditions, like, for instance, a mantra-based meditationpractice.” Other techniques were more specific. For example, says Martin, headopted a “direct awareness–type method. This involves placing your attention onawareness itself. Now that sounds simple, but as I’m sure all of these folkswill tell you, it’s rather tricky.”From students’ feedback, he quickly learned that some practices worked betterthan others for each person. He also mixed in techniques: “It’s not all ancientpractices. We also include some of the gold standard exercises from positivepsychology.” In a general way, the course had two aims, to increase well-beingas quickly as possible and to deepen awareness. The success that resulted soundsremarkable: “More than 70 percent of participants who completed the coursereport having persistent forms of an ‘awakening’ experience, and 100 percent saythat they are happier than they were when the course began, even those who ratedthemselves as ‘very unhappy’ at the start of the course.”Paul, the near-suicidal manager of a garden center, offers personal testimony tothat: “It was the dropping away of sloth; that was the biggest single thing thatI noticed. The chatter was going, the general day-to-day worries and anxietieswere dropping away at a terrific rate. That was what resonated for me initially.The lack of fear, of worry, of anxiety. That was the biggest impact for meinitially.”So do we have a final answer—has metahuman become accessible through a cocktailof psychotherapy, group sharing, self-help, meditation, and a program aspersonalized as a fitness regimen at the gym? There’s no cut-and-dried answer.Too many people find too many paths to waking up. Martin’s research is only oneversion of a trend to make the mind a kind of techie project, and although heclaims that 70 percent of participants who experienced some form of awakeningcontinued to have the experience, only time will tell. An intensive lifestylechange that includes hours of practice a day will attract only the dedicatedfew.The mystery of awakening includes the 14 percent in Martin’s surveys who awokespontaneously. One day, without warning, they found themselves fully self-awareor they eased into that state over time but without effort. We’ve alreadytouched on a similar phenomenon in sudden genius syndrome (see this page[Chop_9781524762988_epub3_c005_r1.xhtml#page_80]), and there are rare caseswhere people discover suddenly that they have total recall of everything thathas happened in their life (a phenomenon known as “superior autobiographicalmemory”). Such people can get together and chat about things like “What was thebest Tuesday in your life?” or recall the theme song to a TV series that airedonly a few times in the seventies.In all these cases, a person’s awareness doesn’t accept imposed limitations asnormal. Under hypnosis, ordinary people can uncover detailed memories they can’totherwise retrieve, such as knowing the number of rosebushes in a garden fromchildhood or how many stairs led to the basement in their parents’ home. Is itnormal to remember or forget? Both, of course. Unfiltered raw data bombards usin waves too overwhelming to absorb, so we selectively forget and remember. Thepoint of waking up is to remove some barriers created by memory and otherbarriers created by forgetting. Happiness is blocked if you keep remembering andrehashing old hurts, but just as effectively if you forget how happy you oncewere—it’s a matter of perspective. You can even say that virtual reality makesus forget to remember who we really are.At its most universal, enlightenment is simply expanded self-awareness. We gobeyond stories, beyond fixed boundaries, beyond the rickety construct of “I,”and, in doing so, awareness effortlessly expands. It expands naturally, of itsown accord, because stories, boundaries, and limitations were artificial tobegin with."},{"pageContent":"9 THE DIRECT PATHThe guides of humanity who urge us to undergo radical change use many tactics,including the religious promise of eternal peace and unbounded happiness, eitherhere or in the afterlife. The carrots lure us on, but there’s also the stick—thepersistence of present suffering and fear of more suffering to come. The stickdoesn’t work in getting people to change, because even the ultimate threat,unending suffering in hellfire and brimstone, can’t compete with the urges ofdesire and the reckless behavior that follows. The carrot isn’t much better. Whyshould we believe in divine rewards? Anyone can see that virtue very often isnot rewarded while sin is. Soldiers are told that God is on their side, whichgives divine vindication for going to war. But, at the same time, urgingsoldiers to wipe out the enemy contradicts the teaching that God forbidskilling.When God is used to justify killing and condemn it at the same time, we arealmost too deep in the spell/dream/illusion to be rescued. Every religion hastried to make the rewards of salvation, redemption, enlightenment, waking up, orwhatever you want to call it more extravagant. Consider the Parable of theBurning House, which appears in an ancient Buddhist scripture, the Lotus Sutra.A rich man’s house is on fire and, to his dismay, his children refuse to leave.They are so absorbed in playing with their toys that they ignore the flames allaround them. Frantically, the rich man gropes for a solution, and one occurs tohim. He tells his children that waiting outside the house are even better toys.Their fondest wish was for a pretty goat-drawn cart, and one is right outsidethe door. Enticed by their father’s promise, the children run out of the burninghouse, and what they find isn’t an ordinary goat-drawn cart, which would havemade them happy, but a far more splendid reward, a jewel-encrusted cart pulledby two snow-white bullocks.This carrot, like the promise of a heavenly feast prepared by God with Christsitting at the head of the table, demonstrates how far religions will go to winadherents. But, for many, these inflated promises have lost their power toinspire devotion. I don’t think modern secular people are less faithful—they’vesimply shifted their faith from religion to science. The spell/dream/illusionkeeps changing. In prosperous societies, most people live in an upgradedillusion filled with the wonders of technology. Why should they give that up? Insheer exasperation, the great Persian poet Rumi looks at humanity and pleads,“Why do you stay in prison when the door is wide open!” The honest answer isthat we like it here. It took enormous creativity to devise the current state ofour collective dream. But the key isn’t wealth and comfort. At a very deeplevel, humans agreed to a life of high drama. The drama is driven by the warringopposites of pain and pleasure, desire and repulsion, good and evil, light anddarkness, us versus them, my God against your God, and so on.There’s no sign that the drama will ever end. The direst threats, like globalclimate change, only exacerbate it. As for new carrots, I doubt that waking upcan compete with going to Heaven or finding a jewel-encrusted cart. There has tobe a way to reach metahuman that isn’t either carrot or stick. Such a way doesexist; it’s known as the “direct path.” It offers no punishment and no reward.What else is there? Wholeness. This answer doesn’t seem very enticing at first.We’re too used to the system of rewards and punishments meted out by the war ofopposites. But wholeness is healing—it overcomes the wounds of separation andthe divided self. Wholeness is unshakable and eternal. It is the only thing thatno one and nothing can take away from you, not even death.I don’t want to make these things seem like another set of rewards. The directpath isn’t a sneaky tactic for dressing up Heaven in a new costume. Reality iswhole already, needing no human beings to validate it. Wholeness is totallyreal. The direct path exists to show the way to the same reality. If itsucceeds, the outcome will be unpredictable. Reality is confronted here and now,in the midst of constant change. The here and now can’t be pictured ordescribed. But by ending the war of opposites, wholeness erases a falsereality—no reward we can possibly imagine compares with this.The direct path, also known as the direct method, aims to shift a person’s senseof self. Instead of “I am X,” which forces us to identify with bits and piecesof experience, we become content with “I am.” This is more than a semantictwist. “I am” means that you identify with existence, and because existencecontains the infinite potential of consciousness, so do you. The shift to “I am”involves every aspect of life, and this poses a potential problem. Which aspectshould we confront first—the body, the mind, the brain, psychology,relationships, beliefs, or habits and old conditioning? It’s not clear that anyof these should be given top priority, or confronted at all.The direct path doesn’t ask us to think about our problems intellectually or toanalyze the prospects for inner change. In fact, the direct path bypasses allordinary ways of seeing and thinking about ourselves. These are what got us intotrouble to begin with. Ordinary ways of seeing and thinking are totally adaptedto virtual reality. A different way must be found.In my experience, direct is a tricky word. It implies something that happensimmediately, but going to college for four years is the direct way to get abachelor’s degree, and four years isn’t immediate. Direct also implies somethingeasy, efficient, without obstacles. This applies, for example, when a package isdelivered directly to your house. You don’t have to go to the trouble andexpense of driving to the manufacturer to get whatever is inside the package.But a Sherpa leading a trek to the top of Mt. Everest is exactly theopposite—the path might be direct, but it is arduous and full of obstacles.The origins of the direct path can be traced back to Vedic India and ancientGreece, where the issue of waking up was fully discussed. Many answers and manyways to reach the goal were devised. A detailed survey of all these paths wouldlead to more confusion than ever, because disagreements among the variousapproaches abound. There have been dreams of shortcuts, such as accepting Christas the Son of God, a single decision that redeems all sins and opens the door toHeaven. That’s as direct as it gets. On the other hand, a lifetime can be spentby a Tibetan Buddhist monk or a devout Hindu renouncing the world for a forestashram or a mountain cave. This choice presents the prospect of a long,difficult inward journey.In this book I’ve been describing the simplest and most powerful (I believe)version of a shortcut, which is to exchange illusion for reality. I definedirect as easy, efficient, and natural. There is no need for anything arduousand filled with obstacles. I insist on a path that is painless, because I’veseen too much of the opposite. Some people spend years in frustration anddisappointment struggling to reach some spiritual goal that remains just out ofreach. What baffles people is that the whole spiritual project gets tangled upin misguided ideas and doomed expectations. Let me list the pitfalls one is mostlikely to encounter: 1. Mistaking the goal for some kind of self-improvement, shedding your old imperfect self for a shiny new one. 2. Assuming that you already know what the goal is. 3. Hoping that higher consciousness will solve all your problems. 4. Struggling and striving to get somewhere fast. 5. Following a cut-and-dried method, usually a method backed by some famous spiritual authority. 6. Hoping to be looked upon with respect, reverence, or devotion as a higher being. 7. Being tossed around by the ups and downs of momentary successes and failures.I doubt that anyone who has honestly undertaken an inner journey is immune tosome or all of these pitfalls. There is an enormous gap between where you findyourself today (totally dependent on the active mind) and the reality you needto unveil. It’s not waking up that is painful but the pitfalls. They are createdby the ego-personality, which thinks, mistakenly, that it deserves its share ofthe goodies that are about to fall from the sky.If you focus on your experience here and now, the ego is irrelevant, and manydistractions can be avoided. Think about parenting. Parents go through all kindsof troubles, worries, everyday crises, and arguments with their children, butwithout a doubt they know they love them. On the direct path you constantlyreinforce your purpose, which keeps the distractions at bay. The ancient Vedasdeclare that everyone is defined by their deepest desires. Desire leads tothoughts, thoughts to words and actions, actions to the fulfillment of desire.So in a very basic way, desire is all you need. If your deepest desire is towake up, to escape the illusion, to unveil reality, and in the end to know whoyou really are, the message gets through. Your deepest desire activates a levelof awareness that will get you to the goal.Strange as it sounds, the direct path is valid only if it leads to the placewhere you already are. Each of us is already a conscious, creative being We arealready in the state of wholeness, despite our allegiance to mental constructsthat impose all kinds of limitations on us. The only change that’s needed is ashift of identity, and yet no change is more earthshaking. Once you realize thatyou are whole, the transformation from human to metahuman has occurred.NATURE’S HIDDEN MESSAGEWhat makes us whole already is that Nature is whole, and we are part of Nature.Such reasoning is totally sound, but it is hard for many people to accept.Modern physics holds that the universe operates as a whole, each subatomicparticle woven into the cosmic fabric. But the method of science is to subdivideNature into smaller and smaller increments, and as the investigation arrives atfiner levels of existence, wholeness is lost from view. This is more than atechnical glitch. A crucial question is at stake. Does the whole control theparts, or is it the reverse—there is no whole except for an accumulation ofparts? A new car is a whole thing; we see it as one image and refer to it withone word. But just as easily we can see a car the way a garage mechanic does, asa collection of parts: carburetor, driveshaft, transmission, and so on. Withlittle or no effort, your mind can shift from one viewpoint to the other.The same holds true for how you see yourself. In the mirror you appear as awhole thing, a body; you refer to yourself by one word, your name. But if yousuddenly feel acute pain in the region of your appendix, you rush to thedoctor—a kind of garage mechanic for tissues and organs—and you become acollection of parts. You have the option to see yourself as whole or as acollection of parts.When we come right down to it, what is wholeness, anyway? It’s hard to imagine amore baffling question. But without an answer, living in wholeness isimpossible. Fortunately, Nature presents some inescapable clues, going back tothe first appearance of life on Earth. Life began 3.8 billion years ago when RNAappeared and had the ability to divide and replicate itself; a billion yearslater, cells with outer membranes appeared on the scene; jump ahead anotherbillion years or more and single-celled organisms evolved into multicelledorganisms.The leap to multicelled organisms wasn’t due to physical necessity—it was acreative breakthrough, and an astounding one. For almost three billion years,single-celled organisms were thriving, mutating into new species on an endlessconveyor belt (which is still running at mid-ocean, where millions, perhapsbillions, of undiscovered single-celled creatures ride on its surface). Lifeforms restricted to single cells, or even more primitive bacteria and viruses,vastly outnumber, by far more than 100 to 1, multicelled life forms. DNA hadachieved the ability to fend off environmental hazards and laughed at death. Thetrillions of amoebas, blue-green algae, and simple fungi populating the Earthtoday are clones of one ancestor—it died as a physical object but is nearlyimmortal as a package of knowledge inside DNA.With such a successful enterprise showing no signs of waning, there was noreason to risk multicelled life, except for one: the sheer exuberance ofcreativity. The basic challenge of creating multicelled life was how toreproduce a complex organism whose moving parts aren’t the same. The task waslike handing someone the handlebars of a racing bike and asking for the wholebike to be built from it, with the added challenge that no one had ever seen awhole bike before. In your body, two stem cells might sit in suspended animationfor months or years, mixed in with fully formed cells. When a stem cell istriggered into activity, it specifically turns into a blood, brain, liver, orskin cell, not a generic human cell. The last generic cells in human developmentdisappeared in the womb by the fifth week of pregnancy, when a ball of genericcells (the zygote) proceeded to the stage of the embryo.The early embryo doesn’t look anything like a mini–human body, but its blobbypink appearance is deceptive. As the zygote emerged from a single fertilizedegg, and then went from two cells to four, eight, sixteen, and so on, DNA wasbiding its time. With precise timing, new instructions were sent out thataltered the destiny of the embryo, pushing it closer to human form. Each newcell was given its own separate identity, through a bewilderingly complex set ofchemical signals that is even more remarkable than DNA alone. We are far frombeing able to explain how a cell understands what to do, but we know the generaloutline. In the coming weeks of embryonic development not only will a brain cellbecome different from a liver cell, but each brain cell travels to a specificlocation, hooks up with similar cells that have made the same journey, andundertakes a joint enterprise: creating a brain. The same for each liver cell.This process, known as “cell differentiation,” has been minutely studied. It’sfascinating to observe so-called neuronal migration as nascent brain cells,starting from their birthplace, are provided with slick pathways to slide alongso that each reaches the region of the brain that needs to develop into vision,the fight-or-flight response, emotions, higher thought, and so on. (I’m giving asimplified picture, since neuronal migration is multistaged and extremelycomplex.) To all appearances, a cell is a squishy bag of water and solublechemicals, but it is actually the repository of every bit of knowledgepertaining to the history of life on Earth.Creation looks like a process unfolding step by step, bit by bit, but behindthis appearance, one reality creates, governs, and controls everything. Dividinglife into its component parts—the physical bits and pieces—is totallyartificial. Whether we go back three billion years or to the moment you wereconceived in your mother’s womb, the same hidden message is present. The wholeis contained in the parts. Without the whole, the parts are meaningless.SELF-REGULATION: THE GLUE OF EXISTENCEIf the whole creates, governs, and controls the parts, can we observe ithappening? Science doesn’t deny that the universe operates as a whole, butscientists maintain their insistence that physical forces glue everythingtogether. As with everything else in virtual reality, a story has been made upto satisfy the belief that the universe must be physical. The glue that reallyholds creation together isn’t physical at all. It consists of self-regulation,or the ability of every system to remain intact inside its own fenced-in world.Self-regulation is why brain cells know that they aren’t supposed to be liver orheart cells. Self-regulation is why your body doesn’t fly apart into a cloud ofhydrogen, carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen atoms. Self-regulation has no physicalproperties—it isn’t matter or energy—because it is a quality of wholenessitself. To show the exquisite delicacy of this invisible glue, consider how therise in temperature of ocean water by only a few degrees in recent decades ledto the destruction of coral reefs around the world. (There are other reasons aswell, including water pollution, predators, and disease.) The phenomenon isknown as a “marine heat wave”; such waves began to assault Australia’s GreatBarrier Reef in 1998 and 2002, but created only limited damage.When water temperatures suddenly rise, a reef undergoes self-destruction through“coral bleaching”—the corals, which symbiotically depend on algae inside them tosurvive, become stressed and expel the algae, which also had given the reefstheir bright colors. When the algae leave, the coral becomes bleached white anddies. The sudden death of huge portions of the Great Barrier Reef occurred overnine months in 2016, when a marine heat wave affected three-quarters of theworld’s reefs (such heat waves had begun to intensify starting in 2014). “Welost 30 percent of the corals in the nine-month period between March andNovember 2016,” said a spokesman for the study group that monitors the reef.More marine heat waves came in 2017, affecting all parts of the Great BarrierReef, including central sections that had managed to withstand previousdestruction. The fastest-growing corals can replenish themselves in ten tofifteen years, but marine heat waves of destructive force are returning onaverage every six years.This has all been driven by our failure to keep ocean temperatures from rising2°C since preindustrial times, or roughly two hundred years. A minute change intemperature you could barely register by putting your hand in warm water wasenough to tip the balance of a complex system of self-regulation that goes back535 million years. But the lesson reaches much deeper. A coral reef is amegasystem that encloses smaller systems: all manner of fish and other marinecreatures, single-celled organisms lower down on the food chain, the cells thatare the basis of life, and DNA itself. Each system has its own rules ofself-regulation. They build up their own boundaries for survival. Yet whenviewed from the megasystem, encompassing the entire reef community, wholenessdominates over separation.We can bring this lesson home in our own bodies. When you cuddle a baby, itswarm, smooth skin feels nice, but it’s also the sign of a potential threat ifthat warmth starts to drop off. Starting at normal body temperature, which isbetween 97.7°F and 99.5°F, we start to feel chilly around 97°F, and hypothermiastarts to set in under 95°F, the same slight variance that threatens coral.If a person’s core body temperature drops to 90°F, a medical emergency isdeclared, and severe symptoms like delirium and hallucinations set in. Below88°F, the body becomes comatose. Irregular heartbeat threatens death, whichalmost certainly occurs below 75°–79°F. At any given time, while healthy, we arebarely 20 degrees from dying—less than the temperature swing during a summer dayin the Rockies. How do we remain in check? The basic question was probablyanswered during the age of the dinosaurs. Current speculation is that, unlikereptiles, dinosaurs were warm-blooded.This again was a creative leap with no pressing physical necessity. Cold-bloodedcreatures had existed for over a billion years as both single-cell andmulticelled organisms. They breathed, ate food, expelled waste, reproduced, andsurvived the harshness of environmental assaults. This all happened, andcontinues to happen, without a key ingredient: converting some of the energycontained in food into heat, enough heat to keep the body’s internal temperatureconstantly high enough for survival, even when the outside temperature fell toolow.Self-regulation is found at every level of Nature, beginning with the atom,which keeps itself intact without either running down like a wind-up toy orflying apart into its smaller parts (electrons, protons, and neutrons). This isenough to prove that self-regulation is how wholeness operates without needingmatter or energy as its glue. Moreover, in a complex system like the human body,each cell knows that it must live for the whole, not for itself alone. Cellsthat opt to be selfish and multiply unchecked are cancerous, and the reward fortheir rampant division is death for them and the body. Normal, healthy cells doeverything—eat, expel waste, reproduce, heal, and die—with the survival of thebody as their main goal, not individual survival.THE SENSE OF SELFThis discussion about self-regulation gives us a toehold on how wholeness works.I’ve been insisting that everything in creation is actually a mode ofconsciousness. A cell is one mode of consciousness, bringing with it all thequalities of consciousness, including knowing. It is literally true that a braincell knows it is a brain cell. Self-regulation isn’t a mechanical process. Itgrows out of a sense of self. As a person, you have a sense of self thatencompasses hundreds of self-regulating systems, just as a coral reef does. Youare the wholeness that the parts need to exist. We can call this a “top-downtheory,” because there can be no self-regulation without the entire universehaving a sense of self from the very beginning. The whole creates, controls, andgoverns every event.The opposite is a bottom-up theory, the mainstream scientific view that theparts came together to assemble the whole. But self-regulation was neverphysically created. It is part of how consciousness operates. But we’ve onlygotten halfway in our investigations. The discussion up to now is more thanenough to prove that you are a wonder of self-regulation, as far as the bodygoes. But waking up is about the mind, and, as everyone knows, our thoughts canbe wild to the point of madness; in any event, the next thought anyone has istotally unpredictable. You might think of us as unruly passengers, riding aperfectly assembled vehicle through life, with the body operating as a wholewhile the mind roams recklessly from one thought, feeling, sensation, andemotion to the next.The direct path is based on reality being one thing, a wholeness we can live indaily life. It seems far-fetched to believe that we live with a whole mind.Everyone’s mind seems like a junk pile of miscellaneous impulses tossed in aheap, from which we struggle to extract reasonable, socially acceptablebehavior. This disparity between an exquisitely regulated body and a recklesslyunregulated mind hasn’t gone unnoticed by neuroscience and has created abaffling mystery. Thoughts, according to neuroscience, are created by braincells. Brian cells operate by fixed laws of electromagnetism that leave nowiggle room. Electrical impulses and chemical reactions are without free will.They behave the same in a brain cell as they would in a flashlight battery orhousehold current. How, then, did this fixed, deterministic setup lead tofreedom of thought?One answer, which seems peculiar but is widely held, notes that we don’t havefreedom of thought. We only think we do (which would constitute a free thought,but let it pass). The churning of brain activity is so complex, the theory goes,that we cannot find out where any particular thought comes from. But since itmust come from brain activity, a thought is just as predetermined as theelectrochemical reactions that produce it. This hypothesis neatly skips over thetotal unpredictability of our thoughts and feelings. If you don’t have anall-seeing eye that can peer into the firing of 100 billion brain cells, ofcourse your thoughts will seem unpredictable. Only a supercomputer could processsuch a mountain of information, and if computer technology continues to expandat an exponential rate, such an all-seeing eye will soon exist.In this view, artificial intelligence (AI) is superior to the human brain, notonly because it processes more information but because it is free of glitcheslike depression, anxiety, low IQ, wayward emotions, and forgetfulness. We mustnever sell technology short, or so the thinking goes. Anticipating the rise ofAI to godlike status, Anthony Levandowski, known in Silicon Valley for hiscontribution to driverless cars and as a pioneering visionary in AI, gainedmedia attention in 2017 by founding the first AI church, which he named the Wayof the Future. Levandowski is searching for adherents, and foresees an AIgodhead as not ridiculous but inevitable.As he told an interviewer from Wired magazine, “It’s not a god in the sense thatit makes lightning or causes hurricanes. But if there is something a billiontimes smarter than the smartest human, what else are you going to call it?” Whatsaves the Way of the Future from being a lampoon is the enormous impact that AIis going to have everywhere. The Wired interviewer writes, “Levandowski believesthat a change is coming—a change that will transform every aspect of humanexistence, disrupting employment, leisure, religion, the economy, and possiblydecide our very survival as a species.”Everyone is free to worry about a hollow, dehumanized AI future, populated byfalse gods, but other doomsday scenarios might befall us first. A supercomputerwith global reach almost certainly will be weaponized (or will weaponize itself)into a super-hacker, capable of doing immense harm, from disabling securitydefenses to wrecking the banking system. Such attacks, unfortunately, are underway every day already.Be that as it may, the artificial in AI keeps computers from being alive andconscious—increased speed, memory, and complexity only improve the imitation ofthought. The imitation isn’t thought itself. A computer will never have a senseof self, which is a primary trait of consciousness. After all, it was our senseof self that led to computers in the first place. “I can think” is part of beingself-aware. Once you say to yourself, “I can think,” you have a reason to builda machine that imitates thought.The sense of self tells you that you are you. It tells you that you are alive,thinking, feeling, wishing, dreaming, and so on. No physical process createdyour sense of self. You possess it as a built-in trait. Imagine that you aresitting in the dark at a movie that totally captivates you. Your eyes are gluedto a chase scene, perhaps; your ears are overwhelmed by gunfire, screechingtires, and police sirens. At that moment, you don’t feel the weight of your bodyor the sensation of the seat you’re occupying. You don’t sense your breathing;the temperature in the theater isn’t something you’re likely to notice.Engrossed in the movie, you’ve surrendered to its spell. But with your body andyour surroundings out of mind, and probably with no thoughts running throughyour mind, are you so captivated that you disappear? No.You are present no matter how exciting a movie becomes, and the same is true ofthe everyday movie you walk through like a lucid dream. You can subtracteverything from your experience except your sense of self. In a typical day, theexperiences you notice are a tiny fraction of the sensory input you receive. Youwill remember a few things or nothing, but surely not everything. Mostexperiences flicker past and vanish, escaping all notice. But you cannot abandonthe sense of self. Putting it out of mind doesn’t alter, distort, or destroy it.Like a cork bobbing to the surface, it will always return.Unexpectedly, we are plopped back onto the direct path. Your sense of self isthe thing that makes you whole already. Everything that exists “out there” or“in here” is glued together by your sense of self, because it is the commondenominator in every experience. Once you see this, you can identify with yoursense of self, and then the direct path has reached its goal.PASSING THE “SO WHAT?” TESTAs intriguing as this discussion has been, “so what?” Why should you and I go tothe trouble of following the direct path? Looking at their lives, most peoplefeel happy, more or less, with the choices they’ve already made. Or so they tellpollsters, who find decade after decade that more than 70 percent of responders,when asked the simple question “Are you happy?” say yes. News stories appearnaming the happiest countries in the world—the latest candidate is Denmark—andcorrespondingly there are unhappy countries, which turn out to be those that arevery poor, afflicted with war and strife, and where people must struggle toacquire the basic necessities of life.The direct path and everything else we’ve been discussing—waking up,enlightenment, wholeness, the true self, metareality—confronts the “So what?”test. We make choices based on whether they matter enough in our lives. Thisisn’t a trustworthy measure of what is actually beneficial, however. Cosmeticsand fashion matter enough to millions of people, just as fantasy football andadding more guns to their collection matter enough to millions of others. “Sowhat?” is highly personal and unpredictable, but it is also ruthless. Untilsomething matters enough, we won’t change our accustomed way of life.Here’s my answer to “So what?” as it applies to the direct path. In a very realway, becoming metahuman is about eliminating everything that is unnecessary forour species. Such a process is already under way by bits and pieces. The modernworld has eradicated—or is in the process of eradicating—many things that Homosapiens can do without. It would have seemed impossible once to do withoutreligion, judging by how a belief in God or the gods lay at the heart of everyancient culture. But there are millions of people who have adopted a secularworldview, placed their faith in science, and live without a sense of loss inthe absence of religion.We can argue forever over whether religion is good or bad for society, and overevery other thing that is in flux. From the viewpoint of metahuman, however,stripping away all the things that Homo sapiens doesn’t need anymore isessential. The illusion is getting thinner, so to speak. Mental constructs likewar and poverty are no longer considered facts of life humanity must accept. Whynot get rid of the whole illusion, then? Why not do it simply, completely, andwith the least discomfort possible?Once you eliminate everything that isn’t real, what’s left must be real. Thedirect path accords with this notion. It holds that only one thing is real ifeverything unreal is taken away: the sense of self. Every life has its ownpriorities. One person’s suffering may be rooted in poverty, while anotherperson’s suffering is rooted in sickness, a bad relationship, or lonely old age.Nothing is more tangled and chaotic than virtual reality. The process ofdismantling every cause of suffering is too complex to figure out in advance.The only realistic answer is to allow the illusion to dissolve as effortlesslyas it developed in the first place. This is what the direct path is all about;this is what sets it apart from every other scheme for the improvement of humanexistence.It seems too good to be true that mind-forged manacles will simply drop away oftheir own accord. But that’s exactly what Rumi meant when he declared that thejail cell is open. Since we are already free, there is no effort needed to getfree. You are free once you base your life on one thing, your sense of self.But as things stand, the sense of self is almost totally overlooked. WoodyAllen’s 1983 movie, Zelig, depicted its title character as a kind of historicalphantom. Even though he was totally insignificant, Leonard Zelig was a humanchameleon. He had the ability to melt into his surroundings completely. Themovie takes place in the 1920s and 1930s, and the novelist F. Scott Fitzgeraldis the first to notice Zelig’s amazing transformations. At a Great Gatsby–likeparty, Zelig is in the living room talking in a refined Boston accent andupholding Republican values, while later in the kitchen he comes off as a commonman with Democratic ideas.Somehow Zelig is everybody and nobody, everywhere and nowhere. That’s a parablefor the sense of self. It is present in every experience but melts invisiblyinto the background—until you start paying attention to it. Then the sense ofself, unlikely as this seems, takes center stage.The first step is to begin to notice your sense of self. Imagine a debatingsociety where one side is defending a controversial position on the Middle Eastconflict, abortion rights, or racism. See yourself standing up and delivering aneloquent argument on one side. Let’s say you vehemently oppose racism, believein a two-state solution for the Palestinians, and support a woman’s right tohave an abortion.Now put yourself on the opposing side and make exactly the contrary argument foreach issue. It might help if the contrary position is outrageous—you might seeyourself defending the necessity to ban all abortions or supporting theterrorists who deny the right of Israel to exist. Even though you willexperience resistance in abandoning the side you actually believe in, debatersdo it all the time. They shift perspective from pro to con at the drop of a hat.This ability to shift perspectives is beyond any set of beliefs. We can put onany coat we want to wear. Yet whether you speak up for ideas you love or ideasyou hate, you are always present. Your sense of self is independent of anythingyou think or say.Next example: Take any common object in your house and touch it. Is it you whotouched it? Anyone will automatically say yes. Look at the same object. Is ityou who sees it? Yes again. There is no time in the history of humankind whenthe answer would be different. What keeps changing is our mental model of whatit means to touch and see an object. In prehistory, before language arose, therewas no explanation for seeing and touching. In an age of faith, when dead flesh,the body, was animated by the soul, it was God who made sensation possible.Today, the experience of seeing and touching is ascribed to the central nervoussystem and the activity of the brain in receiving sensory data from the world“out there.”Yet if you don’t bother with any of these explanations, there is only the selfhaving an experience. You can modify this exercise in other ways. In medicalschool, students are taught that bodily sensations reach the brain through aspidery web of afferent nerves running everywhere. If you touch your hand orlift your arm, the signals from afferent nerves are responsible for feeling theexperience. Every signal is like an Inca runner dashing from a remote region tothe Andes to the emperor in the royal city of Cuzco. The information fromafferent nerves is constantly flowing, so why don’t we feel every limb’s weight,position, warmth, and the like all the time? Sit in your chair and let yourattention roam from the top of your head to your nose, then to your heart, thento the tips of your toes.If I ask, “Who is roaming from one sensation to another?” you will surelyanswer, “I am.” The self selects whatever it wants to pay attention to.Therefore, the self is not bound by the activity of the nervous system. It ispresent no matter which nerve cells are firing.One final example: If you close your eyes and see the color blue, thisexperience is happening in your awareness. If you open your eyes and gaze at theblue sky, where is the blueness? It is still in your awareness. The experienceof blue “in here” and blue “out there” occurs in the same place. When you handlean object or smell it or hear it, you can remember those sensations. Did thesensations travel from the outside world to your inside world? We assume theydid. Sitting around a warm campfire and watching its flickering flames isdifferent from remembering the warmth and the flickering flames. But bothexperiences happen in awareness. Hearing a bang in your head and hearing a carbackfire on the street are two different experiences, but they share theundeniable fact that both occur in awareness.If awareness is present both inside and outside, it is independent of space.Likewise, the campfire you sat beside might have been in childhood, while thememory of it is now. Since awareness was registering the campfire both then andnow, it is independent of time. Once you see that awareness isn’t bound by timeand space, then you—the real you that is pure consciousness—must not be bound bytime and space. Wherever your awareness goes, your sense of self is present; thetwo are fused. The self is present in everything, but we don’t notice thisbecause, like Zelig, the self knows how to melt perfectly into every situation.I think most people, with a little reflection, can accept that they have a senseof self following them everywhere like an invisible shadow. But to fully passthe “So what?” test, the sense of self can’t simply be a bystander. Part ofWoody Allen’s conceit was that, if you look closely, Zelig appears in photos ofmomentous events like a presidential inauguration—but this didn’t make himimportant. Similarly, sensing yourself in every experience doesn’t put it centerstage. The direct path brings the sense of self to light. What’s needed next isto discover the enormous difference this modest attainment actually makes.The leap from human to metahuman, the shift from virtual reality to the “real”reality, is all contained in the simple act of noticing the self. Not the ego,which wants to hog the limelight and claim that it and it alone is the self. Theego-personality can’t help but contain the sense of self—every experiencecontains it. But the ego blocks our view. It is tied to virtual reality andkeeps luring our attention everywhere but the sense of self.As we’ll see in Part Three, once you rid yourself of all the things you don’tactually need, your ego can be discarded, too, but not your sense of self. Asthe unnecessary burdens and rubbish of the spell/dream/illusion are tossed out,the sense of self doesn’t hog the limelight. Being the only thing about you thatis timeless and eternal, it doesn’t have to do anything. It simply is, a beaconof pure awareness that shines constantly in every second of your existence.Ironically, everything else in your life has a much harder time passing the “Sowhat?” test."},{"pageContent":"Part Three Being Metahuman [../images/Chop_9781524762988_epub3_011_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"10 FREEING YOUR BODYAs we saw, consciousness is everywhere, always, and everything. If that’s true,then you are everywhere, always, and everything. But in your daily life, even ifyou were totally convinced about this, you are guided in the opposite direction.You’ve endured a lifetime of training and conditioning telling you that you area solitary person sitting by yourself in a room. Instead of always, your lifespan is very limited, bookended by two events—birth and death. Instead ofeverything, you are a bundle of very specific things, beginning with your name,gender, marital status, work, and so on.The virtual reality we want to dismantle is made up of many moving parts thatoccupy their own compartments. One part is the body, another the mind, theworld, and other people. These parts were set up so that life can be managed onepiece at a time. You go to college for your mind, to the gym for your body, on adate to establish a relationship, to work to bring home money.From a metahuman standpoint, any division of life into bits and pieces onlysupports the illusion. Wholeness is wholeness, not a collection of parts. To putit another way, life happens all at once, here and now. The reason we cling tovirtual reality is that the prospect of “all at once, here and now” is toooverwhelming.After pondering how to bring this truth home in a way that’s practical andrelatable, I concluded that the direct path should start with the body, not themind. My reasoning is that the body is what holds most people back. Theyexperience themselves encased in a body. They accept the reality of birth,sickness, aging, and death. They seek physical pleasure and shrink from physicalpain. As long as these are the preconditions of your daily life, you can’t bemetahuman. Your body won’t accept it. A liver, heart, or skin cell can’t scream,“Are you crazy?” But it does seem crazy to abandon the body as a physicalobject—this act of craziness makes your body the perfect place to start. If youcan get past the body as a package of flesh and bone, transforming it into amode of consciousness, everything else naturally falls into place.THE ANATOMY OF AWARENESSIf we have trapped ourselves inside an illusion, the body must be part andparcel of that—and it is. Your body is your story in physical form. As yourstory grew over the years, the things you thought, said, and did required a hugearray of brain activity. Learning to walk was a triumph of balance, eyesight,and motor coordination, but once you as a little child put together this complexpuzzle, your brain remembered everything you learned and stored it for life, soyou can move on to something new. Your brain has stored a host of skills, fromspeaking and writing to riding a bike, doing arithmetic, and dancing the waltz.These mental attainments are embodied in you physically.But as soon as this is pointed out, we risk falling back into dividing “mental”from “physical,” which sends us straight back into the illusion. As babies learnto walk, they are under no such illusion. As they totter, fall, get up again,and keep on trying, the experience fits the holistic description given above:the whole thing happens all at once, here and now. The same is true of any skillyou can name—learning it wasn’t mental and/or physical. It was happening in onlyone dimension: awareness.There are so many ways that we put mind and body in opposition that going intoall of them would be impossible. The direct path doesn’t even require the smallamount of discussion we’ve just passed through. Instead, it experiences the bodyin awareness. Once you do that, the division between mental and physical returnsto the authenticity of a baby learning to walk. You return to the self as theagent of the whole experience, fusing thought and action. In this case, anyaction is returned to wholeness, which is where it occurs.To begin, just be open to the idea that your body isn’t a physical object inwhich you reside. Such a viewpoint is just a habit of thinking, even though astubborn one. I will guide you through an exercise that will give you the directexperience of living, not in a physical body, but in awareness. (This exerciseand the ones that follow are much easier to do if someone reads them aloud toyou. If you can find a partner who will join you, switching the roles of readerand participant, all the better.)EXERCISE: THE BODY IN AWARENESSThis first exercise involves the following steps:STEP 1: Being aware of your body.STEP 2: Being aware of some bodily processes.STEP 3: Being aware of the body as inner space.STEP 4: Expanding inner space beyond the skin.STEP 5: Resting in wholeness.Each step is a natural progression from the one before, and each step is asimple, direct experience. You don’t have to memorize the instructions, just gothrough the exercise as an experience.STEP 1: BEING AWARE OF YOUR BODY.Sit quietly with your eyes closed. Let bodily sensations be your focus ofattention, so that you can feel your body. There’s no need to try to stop yourthoughts; they are irrelevant. It doesn’t matter what sensations you happen tofeel. Just be with your body.STEP 2: BEING AWARE OF SOME BODILY PROCESSES.Be aware of your breath as it goes in and out. Slow your breath down a bit, thenmake it go a bit faster. Move your attention to the center of your chest and beaware of your heartbeat. Take some easy, deep breaths and sense your heartbeatslowing down as you relax. See if you can feel your pulse elsewhere—many peoplecan feel it in their fingertips or forehead or inside their ears, for example.STEP 3: BEING AWARE OF THE BODY AS INNER SPACE.Now move your attention to the inside of your body. Feel your head as emptyspace, and start going down your body to the chest, stomach, abdomen, legs, andfeet, pausing at each place to experience your internal organs as a space inwhich your awareness freely moves. If you want, you can also experience yourbreath as the expansion and relaxation of the space in your chest, yourheartbeat as a constant pulsation in the space of the chest.STEP 4: EXPANDING INNER SPACE BEYOND THE SKIN.Once you have felt the inside of your body as empty space in which bodilyprocesses are taking place, run your attention across your skin. Roam over thesensations in your head, feeling the outlines of face, scalp, and ears. Movedownward, letting your awareness go to every other place—throat, arms, hands,feet—as sensations reach you.Now lift your awareness slightly above your skin and gently let it expand beyondthe contours of your body. Some people can do this easily, but others need toconjure up an image—you can see your inner space suffused with light and watchthe light expand until it fills the room. Or you can visualize inner spacearound your heart as a sphere, a round balloon that expands a bit more everytime you inhale, watching it get bigger and bigger until it takes up the entireroom.STEP 5: RESTING IN WHOLENESS.Once you have gone through the previous steps, rest quietly for a minute or two.Let the experience of the body be here now.What this exercise has done is multifold. You have freed yourself from beingtrapped inside a thing, substituting the experience of your body as processesand sensations. Since your experience was conscious, these processes andsensations moved to where they actually occur, in your awareness. Then youopened yourself to experience your body as inner space—in Sanskrit this space iscalled Chit Akash, or mind space. Since everything in life happens in mindspace, you expanded the space until there was no boundary between “in here” and“out there.”You may be surprised that you’ve accomplished all these things, and since theexperience was likely to be unusual, you will easily pop back into the habit offeeling that your body is a physical object you reside in, like a mouse hidingin the walls of a house or a rabbit in its burrow. Yet, at the very least, younow can see that there is an alternative to the old habit. To free yourself fromyour body, the old habit won’t serve you.To break down the old habit—a process I call “thawing,” as discussed before—taketime once or twice a day to repeat this exercise. Once you become used to it,the whole thing runs naturally and smoothly. We’re all practical-minded, so whatgood is the exercise in daily life? * You can do it when you feel stressed. * You can do it to relieve tightness in your body or other unpleasant and painful sensations. * It also works to help relieve worried, anxious thoughts. * You can center yourself with this exercise whenever you feel distracted and scattered.Various practices in yoga and Zen Buddhism bring the body under control throughsheer focused awareness. When you felt your heartbeat and breathing, forexample, you took the first step to controlling both processes at once throughthe vagus nerve, one of the ten cranial nerves that extend from the brain to therest of the central nervous system.The vagus nerve is a wanderer, tracing its course like the trunk line of anold-fashioned telephone system from brain to neck, down into the chest, past theheart, and extending into the abdomen. It is the longest cranial nerve, and itsfibers both send and receive sensory information. Most of the sensations youexperienced in the exercise you just did were channeled through the vagus nerve.You can take advantage of this knowledge in a practical way through “vagalbreathing,” which consists of inhaling to the count of four, holding the breathto the count of two, and exhaling to the count of four. This simple rhythm of4-2-4 is easy for a normal healthy adult, and no one should try to force it tothe point of gasping or feeling uncomfortable. To the great surprise of medicalresearchers, vagal breathing is the best way to reduce stress, particularly theimmediate signs of ragged breath, increased heart rate, and muscle tension.It turns out that chronic, low-level stress is more important and more pervasivethan acute stress. In modern life, being in a state of chronic low-level stressis so common as to be accepted as normal. But your body doesn’t experience it asnormal at all; the earliest beginnings of heart disease, hypertension, sleep anddigestive disorders, and probably some cancers can be traced to chronic stress.It is no accident that the location of these disorders parallels the course ofthe vagus nerve, which serves to communicate stress to the heart, stomach,digestive tract, and then the rest of the body as the nervous system branchesout. Vagal breathing brings the state of the body back into balance and relievestension. So even if you haven’t come to the realization that everything physicaland mental happens in consciousness—meaning that our body happens inconsciousness—here is an unmistakable clue.We accept that a skill like walking and riding a bike is permanent once it hasbeen learned. But, at a more basic level, the biorhythms that sustain thebodymind as a whole were learned and absorbed millions of years ago by ourhominid ancestors. Modern life pushes us to unlearn them, as witnessed by thehuge number of people with digestive and sleep disorders. Both of thosefunctions are controlled through built-in biorhythms. Once your body hasforgotten how to express a biorhythm, the effect is like one trumpet or violinplaying a different piece of music from the rest of the orchestra—the wholesymphony is ruined.Vagal breathing may wind up being very useful beyond its ability to normalizeheart rate, lower blood pressure, and make breathing more regular. It’s a goodpractice to use in bed just before you fall asleep. Mild to moderate insomniacan often be eased or totally healed. General stress is eased, includingstressful thoughts and a racing mind, which countless people experience whenthey try to go to sleep.I’ve gone into a little detail (the whole topic is covered in depth in TheHealing Self, which I coauthored with Rudy Tanzi) to make the point that aphysical map of the nervous system, the operation of the vagus nerve,consciously intervening in its operation, and sensing the results directly areall one thing. The direct path leads us back to that one thing, which will, intime, completely end the state of separation and allow us to rest in wholeness,which is reality.YOUR BODY, YOUR STORYOnce you begin to experience your body in awareness, transformation starts tooccur. You are moving out of the separation between mind and body towardwholeness. You need to be whole to be who you truly are. The direct path isexperiential. It’s not theoretical, nor is it therapy or a spiritual journey.As you experience your body in awareness, you have taken time out from yourstory. This seems like a modest thing, a moment or two spent in doing nothingbut being here. Yet there’s no other way to dismantle your story that is thisdirect. Millions of people benefit from therapy and walking the spiritual path.But eventually we must all face the fact that everything we do, even in the nameof healing and spirituality, is taking place inside our story. As a result, wecan get glimpses of wholeness—these are often quite beautiful and uplifting—yetthey do not carry us to metareality as our home.At the moment you are your story—it can’t be helped—and this keeps you trappedin separation. The word separation may not come to mind; you might not evenconsider it a problem. To illustrate, consider the following sentences, whichall of us have said or heard:I hate my body.You’re only as old as you think you are.Youth is wasted on the young.I used to have a perfect figure.The statements express different sentiments, but each reflects the separation ofmind and body. “I hate my body” comes from someone who feels trapped inphysicality. The person is bemoaning what she has done to her body, or what herbody has done to her. The state of separation is obvious. “I” is playing thepart of the victim, and “body” is the culprit.“You are only as old as you think you are” is much more optimistic, assertingthat the mind can overcome the deterioration of aging. Yet, as we all know, thisis in part wishful thinking. Aging is an inexorable process. It is much betterto have a positive attitude toward it than a negative one—society is benefitingfrom the “new old age,” which envisions every stage of life as vigorous,productive, and healthy. But a thought or a belief isn’t the same as a state ofawareness. “You’re only as old as you think you are” cannot substitute for thetrue self. When established in your sense of self as a permanent state, agingholds no threat because you identify with the timeless (we will go into what thetimeless state means in the next section). A good attitude toward the agingprocess still leaves you trapped in your story.Oscar Wilde’s quip “Youth is wasted on the young” puts a witty face on a sadwish that many people have: If only I could go back in time, I’d live my life somuch better. Regret over the past is mingled into everyone’s story, and thebasis for this regret (and its opposite, which is nostalgia) is that the passageof time has power over us. “I used to have a perfect figure” states this moredirectly by connecting the passing of the years with a loss of physicalattractiveness, while implying that “a perfect figure” is the same as self-worthand sexual desirability.These examples of how the mind feels separate and different from the body couldbe expanded endlessly. The body is subject to all manner of judgment, and yetthe underlying process, whether you love your body or hate it, hasn’t beenexamined closely. This underlying process is the inescapable way your body hasabsorbed every detail of your life story and now mirrors it. To be trapped inyour story and trapped in your body are the same thing. Your brain has beenshaped every minute since you were born, and it has communicated everything youexperience to the body’s fifty trillion cells, which in turn pass the messageson to your DNA.Wholeness, then, isn’t just a mental shift. It’s a revolution in the bodymindthat undoes the past, beginning in the brain but reaching out to liberate everycell and influencing the genetic activity in each cell. To see how thisrevolution occurs, let me go to the heart of every story, which is time.HOW TO BE TIMELESSThere was a period in infancy when your experience was original and authentic.You were too young to interpret the world on your own. All your development wasoccupied with the basics of walking, talking, exploring the world, and so on.Let’s call this the prestory period of life. William Blake divided one group ofpoems into “songs of innocence” and “songs of experience,” which were anonbiblical narrative of the Fall from Grace. Like the romantics who were tofollow, and who idolized him, Blake believed that the Fall didn’t occur to Adamand Eve; rather, it happened to children as they lost their innocence. The Fallwas a repeated experience generation after generation.What Blake saw in innocence was a fresh, simple, lyrical, and joyous perspectiveon the world. The tone is set in one of the most famous songs of innocence, “TheLamb,” where you can read infant for lamb:> Little Lamb who made thee> > Dost thou know who made thee> > Gave thee life & bid thee feed,> > By the stream & o’er the mead;> > Gave thee clothing of delight,> > Softest clothing wooly bright;> > Gave thee such a tender voice,> > Making all the vales rejoice.In contrast to this vision of a childhood Eden, the songs of experience arebitter and dark, reflecting the hardship Blake knew firsthand and saw all aroundhim in eighteenth-century London. One famous poem, “A Poison Tree,” reimaginesthe tale of original sin as the dark side of human nature, in verse that couldbe a nursery rhyme:> I was angry with my friend:> > I told my wrath, my wrath did end.> > I was angry with my foe:> > I told it not, my wrath did grow.> > --------------------------------------------------------------------------------> > And I watered it in fears,> > Night & morning with my tears:> > And I sunned it with smiles,> > And with soft deceitful wiles.> > --------------------------------------------------------------------------------> > And it grew both day and night,> > Till it bore an apple bright.> > And my foe beheld it shine,> > And he knew that it was mine.> > --------------------------------------------------------------------------------> > And into my garden stole,> > When the night had veiled the pole;> > In the morning glad I see,> > My foe outstretched beneath the tree.Even without the benefit of Blake’s vision, we have all experienced thetransformation from innocence to experience. All it took was time. Nothing elsewas necessary as we learned the standard interpretation of the world everyonearound us accepted. A baby is never bored. He looks on the world with wonder.The hours don’t hang heavy; deadlines don’t make a baby rush through his days.He has no hunger for distraction so that he can escape from himself.Being a visionary, Blake saw the possibility of liberation from the fallenstate, which he called “organized innocence.” It’s a brilliant phrase, becauseit implies that a person’s experience can be as original, authentic, anduntainted as a baby’s while retaining the organized mind, a mind we must have toperform higher functions as adults (which includes taking care of babies).Returning to innocence means embracing values like love and creativity, whichbecome more valued as we reach maturity. Yet the years of maturity make it moreand more difficult to journey back to innocence. For all the countless peoplewho yearn for what it felt like to first fall in love, few find a way back.The culprit isn’t experience, because experience can still be joyful andauthentic at any time of life. The culprit is hidden in the texture of ourlives—it is time. I said above that becoming embedded in the interpreted world(i.e., the spell/dream/illusion) only needed time, nothing else. By the sametoken, escaping the grip of time is the only way out. Far from being a mysticalnotion, you can be timeless right this minute—in fact, that’s the only way.For most people, the two words timeless and eternal seem roughly the same. Forreligious believers in the Christian and Muslim traditions, Heaven is eternal, aplace where time goes on forever. For the nonreligious, time ends with physicaldeath. In both cases, however, ordinary clock time has ceased. But there areproblems with all these concepts, and if we go deeply into the subject, time isvery different from what we casually accept.Physics has had a lot to say about time, thanks to Einstein’s revolutionaryconcept that time isn’t constant but varies according to the situation at hand.Traveling near the speed of light or drawing near the massive gravitational pullof a black hole will have a drastic impact on how time passes. But let’s setrelativity aside for a moment to consider how time works in human terms, hereand now. Each of us normally experiences three states of time: time ticking onthe clock when we are awake, time as part of the illusion of having a dream, andthe absence of time when we’re asleep but not dreaming. This tells us that timeis tied to our state of consciousness.We take it for granted that one kind of time—the one measured by clocks—is realtime, but that’s not true. All three relationships with time—waking, dreaming,and sleeping—are knowable only as personal experiences. Time doesn’t existoutside human awareness. There is no absolute clock time “out there” in theuniverse. Many cosmologists would argue that time, as we know it in our wakingstate, entered the universe only at the big bang. What came before the big bangis probably inconceivable, because “before the big bang” has no meaning if timewere born at the instant the cosmos was born. If you go to the finest level ofNature, to the vacuum state from which the quantum field emerged, the qualitiesof everyday existence, such as sight, sound, taste, touch, and smell, no longerexist, and there is also a vanishing point where three-dimensionality vanishes,along with time itself.What lies beyond the quantum horizon is purely a matter of conjecture. Theprecreated state of the universe can be modeled almost any way you choose, asbeing multidimensional, infinitely dimensional, or nondimensional. So it must beaccepted that time came out of the timeless and not just at the big bang.Everything in the physical universe winks in and out of existence at a rapidrate of excitation here and now. The timeless is with us at every second of ourlives.Yet something looks fishy in that sentence, because the timeless can’t bemeasured using a clock, so it makes no sense to say that the timeless is with us“at every second.” Instead, the timeless is with us, period. This world istimeless. There is no need to wait for death or Heaven to prove that eternity isreal.Once you acknowledge that the timeless is with us, a question naturally arises:How is the timeless related to clock time? The answer is that the two aren’trelated. The timeless is absolute, and since it can’t be measured by clocks, ithas no relative existence. How strange. The timeless is with us, yet we can’trelate to it. So of what good is the timeless?To answer this question, we have to back up a bit. Clock time has no privilegedposition in reality. There is no reason why it should be elevated above dreamtime or the absence of time in dreamless sleep. Clock time is just a quality ofdaily life, like other qualities we know as colors, tastes, smells, and so on.Without human beings to experience these qualities, they don’t exist. Photons,the particles of light, have no brightness without our perception of brightness;photons are invisible and colorless. Likewise, time is an artifact of humanexperience. Outside our perception, we cannot know anything about time. Thisseems to contradict the cornerstone of science, which holds that “of course”there was a physical universe before human life evolved on Earth, which meansthat “of course” there was time as well, billions of years of time.Here we come to a fork in the road, because either you accept that time, asregistered by the human brain, is real on its own or you argue that, beingdependent on the human brain, time is created in consciousness. The secondposition is by far the stronger one, even though fewer people believe it. In ourawareness we constantly convert the timeless into the experience of time—thereis no getting around this. Since such a transformation cannot happen “in” time,something else must be going on. To get a handle on this “something else,” let’slook at the present moment, the now, the immediate present.All experience happens in the now. Even to remember the past or anticipate thefuture is a present-moment event. Brain cells, which physically process theconversion of the timeless into time, function only in the present. They have noother choice, since the electrical signals and chemical reactions that run braincells occur only here and now. If the present moment is the only real time wecan know in the waking state, why is it so elusive? You can use a clock asfine-tuned as an atomic clock to predict when the next second, millisecond, ortrillionth of a second will arrive, but that’s not the same as predicting thenow. The present moment, as an experience, is totally unpredictable. If it couldbe predicted, you’d know your next thought in advance, which is impossible.As we touched on already, the present moment is always elusive because theinstant you register it as either a sensation, an image, a feeling, or athought, it’s gone. So let’s boil these insights down. The now, the place wherewe all live, can be described as: * the junction point where the timeless is converted into time * the only “real” time we know in the waking state * a totally unpredictable phenomenon * a totally elusive phenomenonNow, if all these characteristics are being correctly described, it turns outthat we have been fooling ourselves to believe that time is a simple matter oftick-tock on the clock. In some mysterious way, each of us occupies a timelessdomain, and to produce a four-dimensional world for the purpose of living in it,we mentally construct it. That is, we create the world in consciousness firstand foremost. Reality, including ordinary clock time, is constructed inconsciousness as well.We must not fall into the trap of saying that the mind creates reality. The mindis a vehicle for active thinking experience, and, like time and space, it has tohave a source beyond something as transient and elusive as thoughts. If wetrusted our minds, we’d equate going to sleep with death. In sleep the consciousmind gives up the world of solid physical objects and clock time. Yet when wewake up in the morning, there is a return of solid objects and clock time. Theywere held in waiting, so to speak, by consciousness, even during the eight hoursa day that the thinking mind was out of commission.If the direct path aims to take us beyond the illusion we accept as real, itmust deliver the experience of being timeless. In its fullest state, thetimeless experience is simple, natural, and effortless—it is the sense of self,which quietly lies inside every other experience. We are only partially there.The exercise in this chapter, which allows you to experience your body inawareness, thaws out one aspect of the illusion. The present discussion of beingtimeless thaws out another aspect. In both cases, as physicality and clock timestart to lose their grip, you realize that there is another way to live: beingmetahuman.When you start being metahuman, you exist at the timeless source of the self.It’s a huge step to know that the timeless is with us, beyond any belief inbirth and death, age and decay. Things appear and disappear in our dreams whenwe’re sleeping. Yet we don’t mourn them, because we know that dreams are anillusion. What matters isn’t the things that appear and disappear, only that youdon’t mistake the dream for reality.Discovering that the same is true about our waking dream sets us free from thefear of death. Metahuman is about more than this. Liberated from illusion, wecan be free of all fear. In the end, waking up leads to absolute freedom. Wedon’t just lead our everyday lives. We navigate the field of infinitepossibilities."},{"pageContent":"11 RECOVERING THE WHOLE MINDImagine that you’ve gone to a cabin in the woods that sits by a small lake. Thesun wakes you up very early, and when you walk down to the lake in the palelight of dawn, it is perfectly still. The surface is mirror-like andundisturbed. You have the urge to pick up a pebble and toss it into the lake.The pebble lands with a plop, ripples spread out across the water, and, as thering of ripples widens, they fade away until nothing remains but the stillsurface of the lake. It has returned to what it was before you came along todisturb it.In this modest experience is reflected the whole story of the human mind. Allthat’s needed is to see the scene in reverse, like running a film backward. Thesurface of the lake is perfectly still. A faint ring of ripples disturbs thewater, at first in a way that’s barely discernible. The ripples grow bigger andthe ring starts to shrink. All at once a pebble pops out of the water and fliesinto your hand.This is how the human mind looks from the perspective of metareality. There ispure consciousness, still and undisturbed. Faint activity begins to stir, sofaint that you have to be quiet and very alert to notice it. But thisactivity—call it a vibration in consciousness—becomes more urgent untilsomething fully formed pops into existence: a sensation, image, feeling, orthought.In daily life a myriad of mental events pop into existence, and they are soconstant and compelling we never experience the still surface of the lake, whichis pure consciousness. The direct path aims to recover this experience, becausea still, undisturbed state of awareness is whole mind. Whole mind contains theinfinite potential that is unique to Homo sapiens. As with so many things inmetareality, whole mind is already here and now. You have to have a lake beforeyou can throw a pebble into it, and you have to have a lake for the pebble topop out of it, too. Both processes occur in the cosmos as every subatomicparticle emerges from the quantum vacuum and fades back into it. Likewise, yourthoughts arise from silence, poise in midair only as long as it takes to benoticed, and then fade back where they came from.If whole mind is already here and now, why do we need to recover it? The answeroffered in this book is that metareality lies beyond the illusions of virtualreality, which bamboozles us by seeming to be real. Whole mind is indisputablyreal, as the direct path aims to prove. But I feel that something more isneeded. If mental activity were exactly like pebbles popping out of a lake, eachthought would naturally die away, and the mind would effortlessly return to itsundisturbed state. In other words, there would be no interruptions, no clingingor blurring or storms to whip the lake up.Unfortunately, our minds are not smoothly connected to pure consciousness. Ourminds are a confused, chaotic jumble, vividly described in some Easterntraditions as a monkey. Every thought joins the storm of other thoughts withoutreturning to a still, undisturbed state. To be human is to ride the storm. Onceyou learned as a small child to speak and put thoughts into words, your mind wasoff and running. Fueled by the agenda of the ego, “I” started the endless taskof accepting A and rejecting B. Even two- or three-year-olds want what theywant: toys to call “mine,” attention from their mother, their favorite foods,stories they want to hear over and over again. Rejection is a vital part of theego’s agenda as well. A two- or three-year-old throws some toys on the floor,rejects hugs and kisses, refuses to eat certain foods, and so on.There is a famous cartoon by Carl Rose and E. B. White showing a mother andchild at the dinner table. The caption goes:MOTHER: “It’s broccoli, dear.”DAUGHTER: “I say it’s spinach and I say the hell with it.”If kids spoke in adult voices, that’s exactly how they’d talk!From the perspective of metahuman, none of the ego’s agenda is a necessity. Whygo to the trouble of constructing a self when you already are the self? The onlyreal necessity is to be here now and allow life to unfold.But because our thoughts don’t fade away into pure, quiet calmness, an obstaclearises. Thoughts interfere with our ability to be here now. Every thoughtgenerates a new thought, every sensation a new sensation. This endless mentalactivity is so distracting that we cannot see our source or touch it or senseits presence. Getting rid of mental interference has become hard work. The yearsspent in Zen Buddhist monasteries or sitting in lotus pose in a Himalayan caveare images in popular culture that represent just how arduous it is to quiet themind. The direct path cuts through the hard work in a simple way, as illustratedin the following exercise.EXERCISE: EYES OPEN, NO THOUGHTSThis exercise is reserved for the moment you wake up in the morning. When youopen your eyes and before you get out of bed, your mind begins its day. You arepreset to jump into your customary routine. You start to think about what youhave to do that day, and very soon you have rebooted your personal story—yourmind is trained to run automatically, like a computer whose software is readyfor instructions the minute the machine is turned on.Yet there is a small interval before your story reboots. For a few seconds youare awake but not yet engaged with the world. At this moment there is nointervening thought to block pure awareness. You can expand these few secondsinto a conscious experience. Here’s how.Go to bed with the intention that you are going to take the following steps theinstant you wake up the next morning:Step 1: When you first are aware of waking up, open your eyes.Step 2: Stare at the ceiling without focusing on anything in particular.Step 3: Try to keep your eyes open. Focus on this and nothing else.What this exercise does is to set a trap for undisturbed awareness. Each step isimportant in the sequence. As you go to bed the night before, you set anintention; this puts the exercise at the top of your mental agenda in themorning. Opening your eyes and staring at the ceiling distracts you fromstarting to think. Focusing your attention on keeping your eyes open is the realsecret, however. Your brain wakes up in the morning in waves, alternating sleepand wakefulness. As these waves increase, there is steadily more wakefulnessthan sleepiness, and thus you wake up, still feeling a bit sleepy.By focusing your attention on keeping your eyes open, your brain has no choicebut to block thinking. The effort to stay awake occupies it entirely. (You canaccomplish the same thing by visually seeing a blue dot in your mind’s eye andkeeping your attention on it.)Once the steps of this exercise are mastered, you will be in a state of “eyesopen, no thoughts.” As you lie there, simply notice what this state feels like.Very few people have actually been awake without thinking for more than a fewseconds. With practice, you can sustain this exercise for up to a minute. It’s asignificant thing to be still, quiet, calm, and alert with no ego to defend orstory to construct. The more you are aware of how significant the experienceactually is, the more insight you will have into your true self. The exerciseisn’t an end unto itself, merely a starting point.There are variants of getting to the same state of “eyes open, no thoughts.” Inmeditation, for example, the mind settles down into a rested quiet state, andwhen you open your eyes at the end of the meditation, this mental relaxationpersists. Here the mind is coordinating a brain response, the natural tendencyto return to pure consciousness if given a chance. The purpose of a mantra, ifyou practice mantra meditation, is to give the mind a sound without meaning tooccupy it, which helps you stop focusing on what your thoughts are trying totell you. As the mantra returns to the mind, it becomes subtler and fainter,allowing an easy slide into quiet mind. At first, when you are coming out ofmeditation, “eyes open, no thoughts” is brief, because we are so used to jumpingback into our story. But over time there is an expansion, and “eyes open, nothoughts” turns into a steady state around the clock.At that point, a person is considered fully awake. In the morning exercise justpresented, “eyes open, no thoughts” is blank. But the experience of being fullyawake isn’t. Mental activity arises—pebbles pop out of the lake—while theundisturbed state remains. Silence and activity are experienced as one thing:awareness moving within itself. The experience of “eyes open, no thoughts” ismodest at first, yet it opens the way to transform how we use our minds.I’ve made the point that most people don’t abandon their stories, no matter howmuch pain and suffering those stories are causing, because their naturalinstinct is to cling to those stories. If you aren’t a battered wife who refusesto leave her husband, a closeted gay man afraid to come out, an opioid addictunable to end her habit—or any other person stuck in deep pain—you can’t grasphow horrible the consequences of clinging can be. Stories can turn into ahopeless state, and that state challenges the best that medicine andpsychotherapy can do to help.Since we all cling to our stories, can the direct path really offer a way out?Let’s agree that you and I and everyone else are stuck in our story. Stuck isconvenient shorthand for old conditioning that keeps us from creating thechanges we want in our lives. It’s possible to learn a lot from the various waysto get unstuck that have failed. Consider the New Testament, where Jesus ofNazareth appears as one of the most compelling spiritual figures in recordedhistory. The story of the Son of God who preaches peace to the world and iscrucified for it constitutes a drama that has transfixed the West for twomillennia.It is striking, however, that what the New Testament teaches is often impossibleto achieve. “Love thy neighbor as thyself” clearly runs counter to how humannature operates (and would have been a fatal teaching to follow in the face ofNazism, at a time when many Jews had neighbors who joined the Nazi Party, or inBosnia where mixed Muslim and Christian neighborhoods became battlegrounds basedon religion). “Turn the other cheek” seems masochistic, except to a deeplyconfirmed Christian, asking for bullies to victimize the helpless even more thanthey already do. But this isn’t a criticism aimed at one faith—all spiritualtraditions have foundered on the same obstacle. Human nature is in love with itsown self-created drama, and the more stark the contrast between good and evil,the more we cling to our story. If the human race is waiting for the day wheneither good or evil is triumphant, the only predictable outcome is that thedrama is designed to last an eternity.Most people are clinging to drama at a much milder level, naturally. Except forthose times when unconscious forces erupt and a whole nation, or the world atlarge, is dragged to the edge of catastrophe—sometimes plunging over into theabyss—daily life is stuck in mundane wants and desires, duties and demands. Likebeing drowned in the bathtub or being drowned at sea, the result is the same.Yet, someone doesn’t have to experience misery to experience being inseparation. Your quality of life may be good or bad—a life generally bringsboth—the situation comes down to the same nitty-gritty: stuck is stuck. Thedrama is self-perpetuating. Even our desire to escape the spell/dream/illusionbecomes part of the story. A passing experience like “eyes open, no thoughts” orthe peaceful relaxation of meditation is like a peashooter against a tank. Themomentum of our collective drama has proved unstoppable.If whole mind didn’t exist, nobody could have invented it. We’re all too stuckto see beyond the story we’re tangled up in. But whole mind does exist;therefore, it must have a way of revealing itself. It is said of Lord Shiva inthe Vedas that he has as many ways to show himself as to disguise himself. Thisis worth knowing. For every impulse of love, there is an impulse of fear. Forevery moment of clarity, there is a moment of confusion. The trick is not tofavor the love and clarity over the fear and confusion, because the pendulumwill inevitably swing back again.The trick is to call upon the source of love and clarity, gradually come closerto it, and finally make it your own. (The New Testament had a better chance ofbeing practical if Jesus had taught “Try to love your neighbor as yourself” and“See if turning the other cheek helps break the cycle of retaliation.”) The onlyhope for escaping the traps of the conditioned mind is to use its better natureas a thread, following it day by day until your story fades away. Then, livingin wholeness becomes natural.A DESIRE TO REMOVE DESIREThe endless cycle of good and evil, pleasure and pain, happiness and misery islike a bonfire that fuels itself. Yet just as the mind is riotously active onthe surface and quiet in its depths, so is life. The drama is everything, butonly at its own level. When you have a modest experience like “eyes open, nothoughts,” the interference of mental activity ceases temporarily. What replacesit is more than quietude. By itself, a silent mind is no better, as far asnegotiating the demands of daily life, than a car would be if the engine dies.There has to be something attractive within the experience of silence.This something exists in the form of a faint presence, which we’ve alreadyencountered as the sense of self. We are most natural, relaxed, free, andpresent when the sense of self is upon us. Sustaining this feeling of presenceeludes us, however. I think it’s fair to say that the glimpses of the true selfthat generate experiences of love, joy, peace, safety, and self-worth are theonly thing that has brought light into the condition of being human. There is anatural desire to expand upon such experiences. In return, the true self has thepower of attraction (known in Sanskrit as Swarupa, the pull of the Self).Being silent and largely unnoticed, the sense of self cannot get us unstuck byitself. If you have practiced mantra meditation, mindfulness practices, orone-pointed awareness, which are all valuable techniques for bringing the senseof self to the fore, you know how stubbornly your mind returns to business asusual. You can train yourself with effort to display any spiritualattribute—loving-kindness, forgiveness, steady attention to God—but the sense ofself cannot be trained. It simply is. Effort is not only useless but damaging.This concept was voiced by the venerable spiritual teacher J. Krishnamurti, whenhe said, “Can you discipline your mind to be free?” There’s the rub. No matterhow well we train our minds, including all kinds of spiritual training, freedomis a state where discipline is totally foreign.I had that in the back of my mind when I said that the direct path must be easy,efficient, and spontaneous. If you want to be here now, which is the state ofmetahuman, you first have to stop trying. Meditation gives the experience of nottrying, which surprises almost everyone when they first begin to meditate. Thesense of self is brought into our awareness, and its presence can, in fact, bequite strong. It can turn into a state of ecstasy, a love affair with theDivine, as in this passionate outcry from Rumi:> Oh God, I have discovered love!> > How marvelous, how good, how beautiful it is!…> > I offer my salutation> > To the spirit of passion that aroused and excited this whole universe> > And all it contains.The usual experience of presence is pleasant and far short of passionate. We geta clue from Rumi, however, when he points to the power of desire. In his case,desire is an intoxication with divine love. Everyone has desires, and it is dueto the force of desire that we wake up every morning with a will to see what theday is going to bring. If the day brings moments of awakening, then desire hasserved us in getting unstuck.Since the sense of self simply is, you can’t desire it directly. That would belike saying, “I wish I existed.” What happens instead is that you trick desireinto going where you want to go. (You spiritually hack into materialism, as afriend put it.) In Buddhism this comes under the heading of “Use a thorn toremove a thorn, then throw both thorns away.” That teaching is famous and hasaroused much commentary. It sounds simple enough to remove a splinter from yourfinger by pricking it out with a needle. The mental equivalent runs intodifficulties. Since we are going to use desire to go beyond desire, thesedifficulties need a little explaining.Originally, the Buddha seems to refer to thorns as deep pain that cannot behealed. One of the deepest sources of pain is fear of violence, which Buddhaspeaks of with personal candor. “Fear is born from arming oneself. Just see howmany people fight! I’ll tell you about the dreadful fear that caused me to shakeall over. Seeing creatures thrashing like fish in shallow water, so hostile toone another! Seeing this, I became afraid” (Sutta Nipata).We lean forward to hear what Buddha’s escape from fear was, which conjures upthe image of the thorn. He goes on, “Seeing people locked in conflict, I becamecompletely distraught. But then I discerned a thorn, difficult to see, lodgeddeep in the heart. It is only when pierced by this thorn that one runs wildly inall directions. So if the thorn is taken out, one no longer runs but settlesdown.”In pure form, experiencing the thorn of pain in the heart spurs a person to findinner peace. The teaching is beautiful, but, like the New Testament teachings,it contradicts human nature. When people are locked in conflict, they aremotivated to ramp up the conflict, ignoring the pain in their hearts, or, morelikely, taking it to be a message that they must fight on. (To the credit ofBuddhist cultures in Asia, the teaching of peace has brought fewer bloodyconflicts over time, a record other faiths might envy. The Buddhist violenceagainst Muslims in Burma proves that no religion is immune to violence,however.)“A thorn to remove a thorn” can be used more psychologically as a tactic forhealing. The goal is to substitute negative, self-defeating thoughts withpositive, self-enhancing ones. Under the name of cognitive therapy, thisapproach relies on rationality to overcome emotion. For example, a patient mightcomplain that nothing ever works out, that no matter how hard she tries,everything ends in defeat and disappointment. There’s obviously a strongemotional charge behind defeatist thinking. When this becomes a habit, the firstthought that comes to mind in a challenging situation is automatically “Nothingis going to work out. I know it.”The usual result is that, indeed, nothing good happens. There could hardly be amore perfect example of a self-fulfilling prophecy. A cognitive therapist woulduse a new thought to remove the old one (the thorn that removes the thorn) bypointing out that good things have happened to the patient. Life hasn’t been astring of endless defeats. Therefore, the rational course is to think, “Thissituation may turn out well or badly. No one knows, so I have a chance to do mybest to get a good outcome.” It’s not easy to replace pessimism with optimism,since emotions lie deeper than reason, and telling yourself that something goodmight happen gives pessimism all the opening it needs. With practice andguidance, habitual negativity can be softened, but human nature hasn’t been madepeaceful and fulfilled by the use of reason.Finally, there is the second part of the teaching to contend with. “Use a thornto remove a thorn, then throw both thorns away.” In the process of getting overan illness, you take medicine as long as it’s needed, then you throw the pillsaway. But the same thing is more mysterious when it comes to the mind. If youuse positive thoughts, for example, to replace negative thoughts, you still windup as a positive thinker, just as embedded in your story as someone who isgloomy. It’s better to live in sunshine than in shade, no doubt. Escaping theillusion is another matter.Throwing both thorns away means that the whole scenario of pain and pleasure,good and evil, light and darkness, is discarded. This is taken to be Buddha’sessential message. The diagnosis is accurate, and the picture of beinghealed—living beyond the grip of the drama—is inspiring. The challenge presentedto the direct path is how to make inspiration a living reality.CLEARING THE WAY FOR THE SELFThe answer, as I conceive it, is to use desire as the thorn, because we all haveexperienced its double nature. Desire demands to be fulfilled. If the desire isstrong enough, as in passionate sexual attraction, it is enough to drive peoplemad. The thorn causes pain, because it is never enough to have one moment offulfillment—the next desire arrives with a new demand to be fulfilled. What’sthe other thorn, the one that will end the pain? Fulfillment itself. Moralistswho preach against desire, who call it the work of the Devil or, in Freudianterms, the work of the id, see with only one eye. Desire is as beautiful as itis treacherous. Sexual attraction leads to lasting, loving relationships and notjust sexual assault.I don’t think anyone would deny this truism, and we can draw on it by using thethorn of desire to remove the thorn of desire. But desire for what? If spiritualtraditions have held out the desire for love, peace, divine grace, forgiveness,and a ticket to Heaven or Nirvana, only to fall short in the end, what is left?The only answer I can think of is the desire to be real. The sense of selfultimately has that to offer, and that alone. There is no stick or carrot, onlythe promise that you can be here now, which is how you can experience realityfree of all illusion.In practical terms, the mind can’t learn what it is to be real all at once. Thedirect path is still a path—it takes time. Life offers every imaginable reasonto quit the path. Desire lures us to turn our interest elsewhere—the old storyis very insistent. But you can cultivate an interest in getting real. It’s notnecessarily harder than cultivating an interest in wine or stamp collecting orRussian novels. All that’s needed is curiosity and the flicker of desire(referred to in the Indian tradition as the spark that burns down the forest;one urge to escape the illusion will destroy the whole illusion eventually).The direct path is unique because we are not taught by love, peace, compassion,or any other desirable quality our lives can bring. We are taught by existenceitself. Only knowing what lies at the heart of existence will work. Contrary toHamlet, “To be, or not to be” isn’t the question. “To be” is the question, allby itself. If you ask it every day, your true self will hear and then presentfascinating, ever-changing answers. Engaged in finding out what it means to behere, you transform your mind from its old conditioning into a vehicle that canreach the beyond. The conditioned mind has firmly decided what it means toexist, which is how we became stuck in the first place.To get ourselves unstuck, once and for all, the direct path runs into apractical problem, which has been described in ancient Indian texts as“separating water from milk.” In other words, everyday reality mixes the realand the unreal so they are inseparable. This is obvious when you look at thebrain, which presents virtual reality only because the “real” reality makes usconscious in the first place. The worst movie ever made is projected on thescreen with the same projector as a classic film masterpiece. Many versions ofthe direct path teach that we are like children watching shadow puppets on thewall. We believe in these images so completely that the truth escapes us—shadowscan’t exist without the light that makes them visible. Virtual reality onlyexists thanks to metareality.To separate light from shadow sounds easy enough, and the direct path proves it.All you need to do is bring the sense of self to your attention. As a practicalmatter, nothing is easier or more natural. At any moment in the day, simply shutyour eyes, take a few deep breaths to bring on a state of relaxation, and centeryour attention on your heart (or on your breath). It sounds strange, given theelaborate complexity of religion, that the entire spiritual journey is onlythis: relax and be aware of yourself.By doing this, you subtly allow the “pull of the self” to become a realexperience. If your intention is more serious, learning to meditate or making acommitment to yoga intensifies the experience of sensing the self—the mantrasand yoga poses (asanas) were devised to give a different flavor or coloration ofthe self. We are already outfitted for this process. As children grow up, forexample, they learn to identify the gradations of emotion. Hostility, outrage,irritation, and hate. Once you connect those labels with an inner feeling, itcomes naturally to say, “I’m not angry, just frustrated” or “Don’t go nearhim—he’s a hater.”Gradations in consciousness can also be felt, but they don’t have labels.When you experience the sense of self as directed above, you go beyond thethoughts and feelings that can be labeled. None of them, even the most lovingthought and spiritual feeling, is the basis of reality. Only the sense of selfis irreducible. You cannot go beyond it or turn it into something more basic.Mental activity vanishes into a kind of nothingness—silent mind. According tothe direct path, this is the source of everything “in here” and “out there.” Buthere’s the tricky part. Is “everything” practical? If someone showed you a blankpiece of paper and said, “Here is every book” or a blank canvas and said, “Hereis every painting,” such a statement would not help you write a book or paint apainting. What you want is to write one book, not every book, paint one paintingand not every painting.Likewise, it seems unhelpful to say that metareality is “always, everything, andeverywhere.” We are attuned to specifics. For better or worse, we live our livesat this moment, in this location. It may seem hopelessly vague to tell someoneas I’ve been saying to “Be here now.” Where else are we, on Mars? But a lifebased on specifics is misguided, because the spell/dream/illusion containsthousands of specific things, so many that you cannot deal with them all orescape their grip. As a child in India, I heard simple versions of what it meansto wake up to reality. In one tale, a fish is frantic with thirst, rushingaround to find a drink of water. Even at four years old a child laughs at thesilly fish who doesn’t know it is surrounded by water. Only when you grow updoes the seriousness of the paradox set in.Once you have the experience of sensing yourself, which is available to each ofus in our calmer moments, you can use inner silence to transform your world, oneday at a time. This is done by looking at your mistaken notions about realityand rejecting them. Like a physicist sorting through all the objects in thesubatomic world that aren’t the irreducible building blocks of the universe, youexamine your bedrock beliefs and sort them out on the way to arriving at yourtrue source.This task is made easy by two invaluable qualities of mind—insight andintuition. They are reliable guides when rational thought falls short. They arereliable even when emotions fall short. When people speak of “aha” moments,insight and intuition have cut through a tangled problem and gone directly tothe truth. At such moments, when the light suddenly dawns, we exclaim, “I knewit, I just knew it was this way.” The beauty of an insight is that it isself-justifying. You just know.The sense of self is quiet and so subtle that few people bother to notice it,but within the self are things we just know. The direct path asks us to ferretout these bits of knowledge, so that they can be appreciated. The befuddled heroin a romantic comedy typically quarrels with the lady in his life until heknows—as she knew all along—that he loves her. We’ve seen this plot a hundredtimes, but it still delights us because insight, the moment of “Now I get it,”brings clarity, and delight often follows.Having insights about a relationship or a tough mathematical problem or the nextchapter in a book you’re writing is quite specific. Asking for insight into howlife works is as nonspecific as it gets. The direct path comes to our aid bysimplifying the mistaken beliefs we must see past in order to wake up. In fact,there are only a small handful to consider:MISTAKEN BELIEF: I am separate and alone.REALITY: The separate self is just a mental construct.MISTAKEN BELIEF: This is my body.REALITY: The body is part of the play of consciousness, which is universal, notpersonal.MISTAKEN BELIEF: The physical world is the basis of reality.REALITY: The physical world is one appearance that the play of consciousnesstakes.MISTAKEN BELIEF: My life is bounded by time and space.REALITY: Everyone lives in the eternal now, which is boundless.At this point in the book, none of these mistakes comes as a surprise. Now weonly need to get over them, which leads to a sorting-out procedure, as follows:At any moment when you have an experience worth noticing, pause and say toyourself, “This is the play of consciousness.” So that the statement sinks in,it is best to have a sense of self along with it. But that part isn’t necessary.Nobody can separate milk from water (even a centrifuge only separates out thesolids from the liquid), so they must be allowed to separate themselves.This is a simple, effortless process, but one that requires patience. Byreminding yourself that any experience is the play of consciousness, you bringreality to mind. You don’t argue with yourself (or anyone else); you don’t tryto be good or wise or better than other people. You neither surrender norstrive. Instead, you sit for a moment at the intersection of awareness andreality, in a moment of reflection. The experience at hand is life at thismoment, in this place. By consciously reminding yourself of what is actuallytrue, you allow the “pull of the self” to bring you home.Because we couldn’t stand to be wrenched out of the conditioned mind all atonce, the play of consciousness doesn’t insist on anything. Life moves on like ariver between its banks. When you say, “This is the play of consciousness,” youaren’t stopping the river or trying to steer it. You are sitting on the bankappreciating how the river flows. I hesitate to mention that this stance isknown as witnessing, because once they hear the word, many people try to witnessor get frustrated because they aren’t witnessing when they want to. Isympathize. It sounds tempting to witness with calm detachment the death of aloved one, rather than being plunged into grief.The river follows its own course no matter how we might wish it to movedifferently—it one day moves into grief, sorrow, pain, and suffering—the wholelot. Then it keeps moving. That’s not simply sorrow, it’s the inexorable flowthat brings us to freedom. We only have to allow it, rather than strugglingagainst it. Even struggle is just another aspect of the river, a small eddy thathas no significance in the river reaching the sea. Allowing is one of the keywords in descriptions of the direct path, but it is another word I hesitate tomention. People will wind up trying to allow, getting frustrated that theyaren’t allowing when they want to, and so on.In pure form, the direct path is just experiencing the sense of self and lettingit do its work without interference. Yet there is another stage, where silenceand flow and the experience of “be here now” is over and done with. They aren’tthe goal, only a platform for launching the next stage. With the next stage, youno longer witness the flow—you are the flow. The play of consciousness and theself merge into one. Krishnamurti called this merging “the first and lastfreedom,” a beautiful phrase. To make it more than beautiful, you have toexperience it—let’s start.We will overturn the cosmos and everything in it."},{"pageContent":"12 CHOICELESS AWARENESSHomo sapiens is the only species that must try to be happy. Among all themysteries that surround being human, this is one of the most intractable. Forcenturies our struggle against the enemies of happiness—violence, anxiety,despair, hopelessness, and depression—has been the price we pay for beingconscious. We suppose, but do not know with any certainty, that other creaturesdon’t experience these states. When it can no longer run with the pack, an oldwolf lies down to die, defeated by age and the raw elements of Nature. A humanbeing at any age can be warm, secure, and physically healthy, yet on the insidehas given up on life.Trying to be happy looks harder the more deeply you investigate human nature.Sigmund Freud, who devoted a lifetime to investigating what makes people tick,ended his days in London in 1939 as a refugee after Hitler brought Austria underGerman rule in 1938. As early as 1933, when Hitler first came to power, Freud’swritings were banned, and as a Jew he was personally at risk.To a disciple in England he wrote bitterly, “What progress we are making. In theMiddle Ages they would have burned me. Now, they are content with burning mybooks.” Insisting on staying in Vienna, Freud was finally persuaded to flee inthe spring of 1938 when the Gestapo arrested and interrogated his daughter Anna.After paying an extortionate “flight” tax by which the Nazis ruthlessly strippedJews of their money and property, the founder of psychoanalysis left for Englandin a state of pessimistic gloom, wondering as fear and terror blossomed like apoisonous flower if it was asking too much simply to prevent humans fromcommitting murder.Psychoanalysis has largely faded from the scene, replaced by drug therapies formental disorders. No pill for happiness is in the medicine cabinet, however. Intimes of relative peace, people content themselves with a kind of happiness thatskims the surface, finding love and pleasure when they come along and doingtheir best not to get trapped in the bad stuff.Attempting to reshape human nature by probing what makes us tick hasn’tsucceeded. The direct path is about something different, sorting out what isn’tessential in our lives. Pain and suffering are not essential. They are part ofthe drama we’ve constructed—a very stubborn part—but the drama can be leftbehind. There is a level of consciousness that transcends pain and suffering.The great insight of the direct path is that everything depends on your level ofconsciousness because everything is a level of consciousness. Metareality liesright next to everyday reality, being only a level of consciousness away.(Christian theology teaches that Heaven is where the soul finds eternal bliss,but long ago theologians abandoned the notion that Heaven is a physical place,despite the images carried around in our heads of angels sitting on cloudsplaying harps or of lambs gamboling through green meadows—that’s one of the mostcommon descriptions given when people come back from a near-death experience,claiming to have seen Heaven. The Catholic Encyclopedia defines Heaven as astate of being attained through grace. State of being and state of consciousnessseem synonymous to me.)So far we’ve taken the direct path through two realms of awareness, the body andthe active mind. You might suppose that the journey has nowhere else to go. Whatmore is there to life beyond the physical and the mental? There actually issomething deeper, a department of existence that makes things turn out the waythey do—good or bad, successful or a flop, a dream fulfilled or a dream denied.Here we discover that everything happens for a reason, but the reason is verydifferent from the stories we tell ourselves. Pure consciousness organizes everyevent, including every possible event. It sees and knows all. From thisviewpoint, everything happens for a reason because there is only one thing.Yet the parts of life we work so hard to get right—job, family, relationships,morality, religion, law, politics—are not expressions of one thing. They arecompartmentalized constructs. What happens in one can be alien or even anathemain another. It is against the law to take a life, but political leaders can winmass popularity by starting a war and taking an enormous number of lives. Natureignores compartments at every level. A cell thrives as one thing, not acollection of parts. It eats, breathes, manufactures proteins and enzymes,divides, and expresses the knowledge compressed into DNA’s double helix. To acell, these are not compartments described in a medical textbook—parts don’tmatter. What matters is the life of the cell, which is one thing.Can we get human life back to one thing, and, if we can, will it solve theproblem of pain and suffering? The direct path affirms that this is possible.The one thing, as it applies to human beings, is pure consciousness, but givingit a label takes us further away from one thing, not closer. The great mysteryof pure consciousness is that it has nothing that can be formulated, turned intoa good way to exist, and trusted to bring happiness.For example, in the Indian tradition pure consciousness is eternal, conscious,and blissful (Sat Chit Ananda in Sanskrit). This formulation led someone tothink, “Aha, bliss is the key. What is happiness but bliss?” On that basis,“Follow your bliss” became a widely popular phrase. When put into practice, ithad the advantage of pointing people inward, telling them that how they feelabout their lives is more important than external rewards. Yet “Follow yourbliss” is useless if you can’t find your bliss in the first place, or if atragedy or natural disaster has struck. It is worse than useless if, like Freud,you find yourself the target of unstoppable, malignant persecution.The direct path doesn’t rely on any formulations or fixed ideas about how tolive. Confronted by the mystery of being human, it says, “Let the mystery solveitself. You are here to watch this happen. In that role, you are the livingexpression of the mystery.” This is the closest anyone has ever come to livingthe one thing the way a cell lives one thing, which is itself. When distilled toits essence, the direct path asks you and me to dedicate our lives to theknowledge that we, in ourselves, are the mystery of life as it unfolds.Beautiful words, but what do we do when we get out of bed tomorrow morning? Theactions and thoughts that occupy our days aren’t at issue. Tomorrow morning youwill get out of bed and do what you want to do or have to do. Following youaround with a video camera might detect nothing special about your everydayexistence; it could seem like a typical existence followed by someone who hasnever heard of the direct path.Yet on the inside the thing you have dedicated your life to will be verydifferent. In every culture where people have seriously investigated one thing(a philosophy technically known as “monism”), the same dedication was present.Whether it arose in ancient India, Persia, Greece, or China, monism directed themind away from the countless details of life toward one thing. That’s what thischapter is about. Despite the allure of diversity, the infinite variety ofthings held out by the physical universe, the mystery offers no solution there.When you reduce life to what is truly essential, diversity drops away and unityincreases. Your consciousness starts to reshape itself around one thing. Wakingup is one thing; enlightenment is one thing; allowing the mystery of existenceto unfold through you is one thing. These descriptions are limited, however.What we’re really after is the experience of one thing. Once this is attained,everything else follows, not just the end of suffering, but access to theinfinite potential that wants to express itself through us.This is the state I’ll call “choiceless awareness.” It is the very opposite ofstruggle. Instead of always doing, you practice the art of not-doing. Instead oftrying to decide if X will make you happier than Y, you let the choice happen onits own. When we hear about the advantage of letting go, living in the now, andallowing life to flow, these possibilities become real in the state ofchoiceless awareness.Choiceless awareness is the final stage of waking up. It brings you to a placewhere the next thing you want to do is the best thing for you. In such a state,pain and suffering end because they bear no relationship to the life you areconsciously living. The mystical Indian poet Kabir saw the situation clearly:> I asked my heart,> > Where are you bound?> > There’s no traveler ahead of you> > Or even a road.> > How can you get there,> > And where will you stay?The road, in Kabir’s imagery, is about the stages of leaving, going along, andarriving, which is how we all live. We start an action, either a small one likegetting orange juice out of the fridge, or a large one like getting married orfinding a job. The action begins, goes along, and ends. Kabir sees that theheart—his word for the soul—cannot find fulfillment this way. He sees anotherway instead:> Be strong, O my heart,> > Put your fancy away,> > And stand where you are> > In yourself.Let’s see if we can manage to do just that.THE ART OF NOT-DOINGChoiceless awareness sounds alien in the modern world, where life is viewed asnothing but choices, and happiness is thought to be reached by making good onesinstead of bad ones. It’s hard to realize that the best choices make themselves.The rationale behind not-doing is simple: one thing has nothing to do but beitself. Therefore, we have nothing to do but be ourselves. This is the essenceof not-doing.It’s not a new idea. In the Taoist teaching of ancient China not-doing is Wuwei. The concept arose as far back as five to seven centuries BCE. In Buddhismthe teaching is found in a sutra like the following: “Happiness can be accesseddirectly in meditation by abstaining from conscious mental activity.” InChristianity, the leap of faith that originated with the Danish philosopherSøren Kierkegaard was his attempt to carry out the central concept in the Sermonon the Mount, that all things can be left to Providence. In a leap of faith, abeliever lets God take over, the ultimate experiment in trust.The absence of struggle is common to all teachings of not-doing, but the passageof centuries hasn’t made it less mysterious. Not-doing makes no sense to thelogical mind. Of course we have lots of stuff to do—we barely find enough hoursin the day to accomplish them. But what did you do today to produce new redblood corpuscles, the lining of your stomach, and the outer layer of your skin?These are parts of your anatomy that must be constantly replenished becauseblood, stomach, and skin cells have a life span of only a few weeks or months.For that matter, what will you do today to exchange oxygen for carbon dioxide inyour lungs, without which life is extinguished in a matter of minutes? Alreadythe vast proportion of your physical life takes care of itself. Existence isdivided between things we do and things that take care of themselves. Therefore,some part of you is already living without making choices. To begin to see thevalue of choiceless awareness, stop assigning so much importance to youreveryday choices, which are mostly governed by habit. In the long run, habitskeep you from finding renewal. Even worse, while entangled in virtual reality,you may fall prey to the feeling that life is incredibly unfair. You can besmart, gifted in all kinds of ways, ambitious, and celebrated for yourachievements, yet there’s no guarantee that you won’t suffer the fate of Mozart.In the late summer of 1791 Mozart went to Prague, where one of his operas wasthe centerpiece of festivities for the Austrian emperor. He began to feel illbut returned to Vienna and tended to the premiere of The Magic Flute, one of hisgreatest masterpieces, on September 30.By then his health had taken an alarming turn—he experienced swelling, vomiting,and severe pain. His wife and doctor did their best to nurse him back to healthas Mozart’s mind turned to writing a new commission for a requiem, which henever finished. Occupying himself with his musical genius was in vain, and anhour after midnight on December 5, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, the most precious ofmusical minds, died of still-unknown causes at the age of thirty-five. Therewere heartrending scenes toward the end of his life of him sitting up in bed tosing ditties from The Magic Flute with friends. Few who love classical musicconsider Mozart’s death anything but a great loss.I don’t bring up this sad story, which reached many nondevotees of classicalmusic through the 1984 movie Amadeus, to mourn a death or to speculate aboutwhat modern medicine could have done to save Mozart’s life. (Nearly twentycauses of death have been conjectured, including rheumatic fever, kidneyfailure, and blood poisoning. Most of them are infections curable today withantibiotics.) I merely want to point out that the greatest among us is stillcontrolled by unseen causes. The drama we cling to simply does what it does, onits own terms. The spell/dream/illusion mysteriously generates unpredictableevents that cannot be fathomed.How do we get beyond the sense that we are helpless before random chance orinvisible Fate? Without a doubt there are moments when hidden links arerevealed. The notion of synchronicity has become popular for describing aspecial kind of coincidence. You think of a person’s name, and a few minuteslater that person calls. You want to read a certain book, and, without beingtold, a friend brings you the book. Synchronicity is defined as a meaningfulcoincidence, setting it apart from random coincidences that have no meaning,like seeing the same make of car as yours show up beside you at a stoplight.Metareality has a way of sending us messages now and then that contradict ourfixed views. Synchronicity is one kind of message. It says, “Your world isdisorganized, but reality isn’t.” In a fleeting glimpse, we see that a higherintelligence can organize events so that meaning pops up unexpectedly. Moreover,a synchronous experience defies our limited conception of cause and effect.Instead of A causing B, the two are invisibly meshed. If you think of a word andthe next minute someone on TV says that word, you didn’t create the coincidence.But something did.You can feel your physical body and listen to your thoughts, but the somethingthat organizes all events cannot be sensed. Yet it is here and now. Thefollowing exercise will show you what I mean.EXERCISE: I’M STILL HEREWherever you are now, look around the room and take an inventory of what itcontains. Notice the furniture, knickknacks, books, even the windows and theview outside.Now close your eyes and see the room mentally. Begin to remove its contents.(You can open your eyes to refresh your memory if you need to.) See thefurniture go poof! And no longer exist. Strip the room of the knickknacks andbooks, then the windows and the view outside. You will be left standing in anempty box. If you have a mental image of your body standing in the room, send itaway, too.In one final stroke, remove the ceiling, walls, and floor. You will be standingin a space with no objects. It’s hard to have an image of nothing, so youprobably see white light or blackness. Notice, after removing everything, thatyou are still here.Now reverse the process. Bring back the floor, walls, and ceiling. Reinstate thefurniture, knickknacks, and books. Replace the window and the view outside.Notice that you are still here. Nothing about the room, whether full or empty,changed you.To prove that you are still here, try to get rid of yourself. See yourselfstanding in the room when it is full or the space left behind when the room hasdisappeared. In either state, can you remove yourself? No. “I’m still here” isuntouchable, because you are the one thing.This exercise helps remind you of your true status. If you find yourself in abusy place, full of distractions or stress, take an inventory of everything yousee. Close your eyes and empty the place until there are no objects, people, orroom. As you arrive at nothing but emptiness, you are still here. This gives youa feeling of blissful self-sufficiency. To know that you are imperishable, rightthis moment, is the ultimate validation that you are here now.You have discovered your being. After that, everything you say, do, or think isa passing shadow. Simply by being, you have mastered the art of not-doing. Thenext stage is to let one thing show you what it is capable of.PRACTICAL IMMORTALITYWhen you see yourself as the unmoving point around which everything moves, youare in a special state of awareness. We can call this the state of practicalimmortality. Countless people already live such a life if they are part of areligion that believes in a personal God. Believing that God is watching andjudging them, devout believers are basing their lives on an immortal being. Theultimate reward from such a being is going to Heaven, where the believer gets tojoin in immortality.In societies dominated by traditional religion, rules of morality tend to berigid and narrow. Dogmatic religions nail a set of rules to the wall saying, “Ifyou want to know what God wants, obey these rules.” The rules can be as basic asthe Ten Commandments and the Golden Rule or as complex as the hundreds of dailyinstructions that pertain to the life of an orthodox Brahmin in Hinduism. Butliving by the rules depends on believing that there was a line of communicationbetween God and whoever delivers the rules here on Earth. Religions tend toagree about what constitutes a devout life (i.e., trying to please God and obeythe rules), but they disagree on which messenger to trust.The direct path doesn’t propose that kind of practical immortality. There arezero rules or even injunctions. Instead, there is a path that arrives at wakingup. Once you are on the path, you must communicate with immortality yourself, asbest you can. Moses, Jesus, and Buddha aren’t going to help you (although,because there are no rules, if you want to follow a religion, the choice isyours). To begin to communicate with immortality, the first step is to believethat you can, which isn’t easy.For our entire lives, all of us have been taught how to live in the state ofpractical mortality. Everything is gauged according to how it fits in betweenbirth and death. People who squeeze the most pleasure out of life, master manyskills, work hard and play hard, travel to many places, amass money andpossessions—they are the winners in the scheme of practical mortality. At itsmost basic, however, everyone lives in the shadow of mortality. You see this inour worship of youth, our obsession with fending off aging, our fear that ourbodies might get injured. Protecting the body lies at the heart of gettingrich—money offers a surrogate form of invulnerability. The rich and powerfulcome close to being invulnerable to life’s hardships. (Yet nothing is moreuntrue than the saying, “It’s better to die rich than poor.” Finality isfinality, no matter how much money you amass and throw around.)In this context, how can you believe that you can communicate with immortality,much less turn it into a way of life? All you actually need is the insight thatyou are doing it already. Wholeness—the one thing we’ve been talking about—isimmortal. It communicates with mortal life by emerging into the physical worldas time, space, matter, and energy. Physics has no problem with that assertion.The precreated state or quantum vacuum is not bound by time or space. Itcontains no matter and energy but only the potential for matter and energy.The direct path translates this basic fact into something profoundly human. Whenyou do the exercise in this chapter of emptying a room until you are left with ablank slate, you set the stage for filling the room up again with anything youwant. As a symbol of human creativity, the exercise is simple, but when you lookaround you, the entire world has been constructed the same way. Colors,textures, tastes, smells, and the like are all symbols for a quality humanbeings desired to have in virtual reality.We keep at this project, taking a possibility, plucking it out of its state ofpotential, and then making it real. We embrace dogs for their humantraits—loyalty, friendliness, obedience, and so on—while in return, through asort of bleed-through or osmosis, the primal Siberian wolf from which alldomesticated dogs are descended has been given an evolutionary makeover. Humansconsciously selected the traits we consider desirable and excluded those wedon’t wish to see. Adorable eyes are a very desirable trait, and a goldenLabrador puppy as young as eight weeks instinctively gazes into its owner’seyes, forming a bond that we instantly recognize. (Wolves, on the other hand,retain a feral glare with no connection to humans.) The dog is a human creationin the flesh as well as in our creative imagination.Hybridizing dogs and cats, like manipulating the genes of corn and wheat toresist pests, is physical manipulation, but the force behind it, imagination,isn’t. Using our imagination is one way you and I and everyone else are livingthe mystery. No one created imagination, just as no one created creativity. Noone created evolution, either. When you get closer to the source, whereconsciousness in all its diversity begins to narrow down to one thing, it isevident that being human depends on contacting the immortal domain constantly,not just every day but every second.Diversity is a blinding spectacle. Seven billion people with the capacity to seemillions of colors, write countless melodies, speak infinite combinations ofwords, and pursue endless dreams and obsessions—this whole panorama isdiversity. Being human cannot be confined to any set of rules, whether handeddown by divine authority or created by human lawgivers and enforcers.What makes us human is invisible and impossible to codify. To be human, you mustknow how to pay attention. You must understand what it means to remembersomething, hold it in your mind, and return to it whenever you need to. You mustbe able to carry through with an intention. These things are so basic that webarely notice them, but too often the basic instructions have gone awry.The average mind is restless, unable to stay still for more than a brief moment.The average mind is shallow, unable to reach beneath the surface of unendingmental activity.The average mind is without purpose, unable to bring its intentions to fruitionin a meaningful way.These three problems are interlinked, and they bring about the struggle thatmost people know all too well. If it were natural for the human mind to berestless, shallow, and without purpose, it would be useless to speak ofmetahuman as anything but an empty ideal. But, in reality, the mind by nature isrestful. It is capable of going deeply into its own awareness, and it can find ahigher purpose. Practical immortality brings this truth to light, telling uswhat is normal and natural in our mental life.When you are in contact with one thing, other basic things become clear. Youcannot be human without the ability to make symbols and recognize what theymean. A red stop sign is a symbol that tells cars to halt at an intersection.Red has zero connection to stop until human beings assign it that meaning. Theword tree symbolizes a class of tall plants with wooden trunks, but theconnection is totally arbitrary. Arbre will do in French; Baum in German. Yethaving created a symbol, we can become imprisoned by it, the way that flags trappeople into nationalism, money into greed, and religious rituals into dogmatism.The freedom to create symbols without being ruled by them is part of practicalimmortality. The Sufis say that everything in the world is symbolic, which seemstrue to me. Virtual reality is a three-dimensional symbol of how Homo sapienswants the world to be. The things we say in words are symbols of deeper thingsthat are beyond words or even thoughts. If you try to unravel everything impliedby the word love, for example, the thread of meaning will lead in everydirection. “I love X” can be assigned to all desires, all wants and wishes. Thenthe opposite of love, whether it is hate or fear, becomes symbolic of theundesirable.As part of going beyond your story, it is necessary to stop falling prey to thelure of symbols. You begin to see that they are like counterfeit money. Love canbe the word used to justify domestic violence, obsessive jealousy, stalking, orattacking someone else who desires the same person you desire. The sameslipperiness afflicts a word like peace, which can be used by a country thatsells weapons of mass destruction in the name of keeping peace among nations orappeasing tyrants to prevent them from murdering their own people.The ultimate rationale for practical immortality is the same as the rationalefor not-doing. You let wholeness unfold on its own. You stop forcing,struggling, and interfering. It’s unfortunate that the teachings of not-doing,whether in Buddhism, Taoism, or Christianity, have acquired the reputation ofbeing mystical. If people simply stopped forcing, which isn’t mystical in theslightest, daily life would improve immensely. If we stopped doing a lot ofthings we know are bad for us, not-doing would become a way of life everyonewould want to follow.Why don’t we? Because everything involved in practical immortality—payingattention, using your intention to get somewhere, fulfilling a purpose, droppingyour story, ending the tyranny of symbols—depends on a state of consciousnessyou have to arrive at. Virtual reality is all about stories and symbols.Metareality isn’t. That’s why a path is needed to get from one state ofconsciousness to a different one. What choiceless awareness teaches us is thatthe path isn’t about what you think, say, or do. You unfold your potential,which isn’t a matter of thinking, saying, or doing. It happens on its own.The truth is that no one has to worry about communicating with the immortal,because the immortal is constantly communicating with us. It won’t let us go,ever. A message from metareality enters our awareness, and it sticks. Themessage can be anything once it is translated into daily life. Look around you.No one invented attention, intention, love, intelligence, creativity, andevolution. Yet these things are here, now and forever. They never let go, nomatter how much we misuse them. One thing has us always in mind, which is why wehave it in mind. Neither side has a choice."},{"pageContent":"13 ONE LIFEWhen we are whole, the world will become whole. That would be an amazing change,because, as things stand, we are divided and so is the world. This state ofaffairs goes beyond the never-ending conflicts that make the news. There’s adeep fracture at the very core of being human. We call ourselves mammals, andyet most people believe they have a soul. We set ourselves apart from Nature,exploiting it without considering the consequences. As caretakers of the planet,we are also its worst threat.A shift is already being sparked in collective consciousness, however. One ofthe most heartening signs of this is seemingly trivial, an online video about agrateful octopus, now seen by almost twelve million viewers. It begins on abeach in Portugal with a man, Pei Yan Heng, strolling along the sand. He spots asmall octopus stranded out of the water. Pei takes out his smartphone to filmthe creature. Presumably tossed onshore by a large wave, the octopus looksshriveled and near death. In a kind gesture Pei gathers the octopus into aplastic cup, carries it back to the sea, and releases it.The octopus immediately begins to revive. Its eight arms spread out (expertstell us that tentacle isn’t the proper term), and it changes to a healthiercolor. Typically, an octopus is shy and scuttles away from any approachingthreat, a necessary tactic for such a baggy, soft-bodied animal. But instead offleeing, the saved octopus approaches Pei’s boots and places two arms on them,resting for several seconds before moving away without haste. Soon the “gratefuloctopus” entered popular culture when the video went viral. You might supposethat this was an example of human sentimentality, but then, there is no proofthat the rescued octopus wasn’t grateful. Is there any way to tell?The conventional answer is no. This can be a hard no or a soft no. The hard noholds that only human beings are conscious. The soft no holds that humans arethe only fully conscious creatures. This leaves a little wiggle room forbig-brained mammals, like porpoises, elephants, and the great apes. The soft nohas held firm for a long time. But once you understand that consciousness is thesource of creation, the road to yes—an octopus can feel gratitude—is opened.From the perspective of metahuman, nothing is alien, however. There is only onereality, governed by one consciousness. There is only one life, too, despite ourdistinctions between smart chimpanzees, stupid lizards, and totally unconsciousbacteria. An urgent need at this moment when the Earth is in peril is to evolveto metahuman for the sake of all living things.ONE LIFE, AND ONE LIFE ONLYIn a January 2014 article in Scientific American, the highly regardedneuroscientist Christoph Koch made inroads against the “no” position by askingif consciousness is universal. He is very persuasive when he points out thatanimal intelligence isn’t primitive. Not only that, it isn’t correlated withbrain size or even possessing a complex nervous system. “Bees can fly severalkilometers and return to their hive, a remarkable navigational performance,”Koch points out (not only remarkable, I would add, but something human beingslost in the woods are incapable of). “And a scent blown into the hive cantrigger a return to the site where the bees previously encountered this odor.”Koch links this trait, called “associative memory,” with the famous moment inFrench literature centered on a cookie known as a madeleine. The massiveseven-volume novel À la recherche du temps perdu (In Search of Lost Time), byMarcel Proust, begins with a flood of memory occasioned when the narrator dips amadeleine in a cup of tea, a gesture from his childhood. This experience ofassociative memory Koch also ascribes to bees, a lowly form of insect life. Butwe can find a wealth of other examples. Staying just with bees, Koch points outthe following:> [They] are capable of recognizing specific faces from photographs, can> communicate the location and quality of food sources to their sisters via the> waggle dance, and can navigate complex mazes with the help of cues they store> in short-term memory (for instance, “after arriving at a fork, take the exit> marked by the color at the entrance”).The upshot, Koch says, is that consciousness cannot be walled off in arbitraryways just because a life form looks biologically too simple to be conscious.With arms wide open, he declares, “All species—bees, octopuses, ravens, crows,magpies, parrots, tuna, mice, whales, dogs, cats and monkeys—are capable ofsophisticated, learned, nonstereotyped behaviors.” This gets us a long way from“no,” only human beings are conscious, to “yes,” consciousness is universal.The grateful octopus was acting out a human gesture. To see this isn’tsentimentality or fantasy. Koch believes that if we weren’t so prejudiced, we’dsee that animals behave constantly in ways that would be called conscious if thesame activity were displayed by a person. A dog’s look of love toward hismaster, his distress if his owner is absent, and the grief he feels if his ownerdies are conscious traits being expressed through another life form. Yet ourprejudice is hard to overcome because it serves our selfishness. Homo sapienshas ancient hunting stock in it. We kill and eat a great many animals, and itsalves our conscience to see them as lower life forms, deprived of mind, will,and freedom of choice.Everything that makes other life forms alien in our eyes is arbitrary. Nocreature looks more alien than an octopus. Among the three hundred octopusspecies, which first appeared at least 295 million years ago according to theoldest fossils, the largest types resemble the smallest in having two eyes,eight arms, and a beak centered where the arms meet. Blown up to a large scale,as in the giant Pacific octopus, which can reach a weight of up to six hundredpounds with an arm span between fourteen and thirty feet, those eight arms andsnapping beak seem monstrous. But like Tyrannosaurus rex or a great white shark,the giant Pacific octopus isn’t a monster in its own eyes. In the play ofconsciousness, the octopus occupies the same cosmic status as Homo sapiens. Itis alive and aware of itself and its surroundings.There’s abundant evidence to support this claim. In her 2015 book, The Soul ofan Octopus, naturalist Sy Montgomery closes the gap between people and mollusksin startling ways. In a section that begins, “Octopuses realize that humans areindividuals, too,” she relates how distinctly an octopus can make friends andenemies. In the mildest example, one keeper at the Seattle Aquarium was assignedto feed the octopuses while another touched them with a bristly stick. Within aweek, at first sight of the two people, most of the octopuses drifted toward thefeeder.But their ability to relate to specific humans grows much more mysterious. Avolunteer at the New England Aquarium earned the dislike of a particular octopusnamed Truman for no apparent reason. Whenever she came close to the tank, Trumanwould use its siphon (a funnel on the side of an octopus’s head that propels itthrough the water) to spray a blast of cold seawater at her. The volunteer wentaway to college but returned months later for a visit. Truman, who hadn’tsquirted anyone in her absence, immediately soaked her with a blast from hissiphon at first glance.Montgomery relates in depth the idiosyncratic behavior of octopuses in captivitynamed Athena, Octavia, Kali, and others, making them almost as individual aspeople. Her argument for their similarity to humans is ultimately physical.After all, she writes, we share the same neurons and neurotransmitters. But eventhough octopuses have unusually complex nervous systems for an invertebrate,their anatomy doesn’t resemble the human nervous system. The majority of octopusneurons are located in their eight arms, not in their brains. Each arm canindependently move, touch, and taste (the suckers that line each arm arelocations for the sense of taste) without needing to refer to the brain.Anatomy cannot explain how octopuses recognize people and remember their faces.Disliking a bright light at night that disturbed its sleep, one octopus aimed ajet of water at it and burned it out through short-circuiting. Dissecting anoctopus’s nervous system doesn’t explain how such a tactic was devised (in thewild octopuses don’t squirt water above the surface of the seas). It would seemto be an act of creative intelligence.My contention is that existence is consciousness; therefore, no animal abilityis astonishing (except in our one-eyed view), because every life form expressestraits that belong to pure consciousness. These traits wake up, as it were,emerging into the physical world according to each creature’s evolutionarystory. The grateful octopus wasn’t being like a human. We could say with equaljustice that when we are grateful, we are being octopus-like. Both views areone-eyed.This book has been making the case for waking up, but being awake isn’t theend—ahead lies cosmic consciousness. I am using the term the way others usesupreme enlightenment (known in Sanskrit as Paramatma). If metahuman is theawakened state, think of it as crossing a threshold. There is a vast newterritory to explore beyond.COSMIC CONSCIOUSNESSCosmic consciousness doesn’t give a little bit of itself to an amoeba, more tobees, still more to octopuses, and finally the grand prize to Homo sapiens. In ahologram, a fragment of a laser image can be used to project the wholeimage—with only Mona Lisa’s smile, the entire painting can be projected.Hologram technology can even simulate a statue or a living person in 3-D from alaser image in two dimensions. Cosmic consciousness does this on a hugescale—the entire universe—using merely the possibility of a cosmos. Therefore,it’s not quite true that something is created out of nothing. The physicaluniverse sprang from a conception in cosmic consciousness that unfolded inmaterial form. Pure consciousness is not nothing.This capacity has been inherited by human beings. If I say, “Imagine the EiffelTower” or “See the Statue of Liberty in your mind’s eye,” it only takes the nameof those monuments for you to see them in totality. A name doesn’t have threedimensions; in fact, it has no dimensions, being just a verbal tag for aconcept. The Statue of Liberty is the concept of freedom transformed into a workof art. But liberty can also produce completely different manifestations, suchas revolutionary wars or an antiwar movement. Concepts are constantly shapingand reshaping events, civilizations, and the human world in general.You are living in a world that consists of ideas blown into three dimensions. Asusual, the great minds got there before us. More than two thousand years agoPlato argued that everything in the world originated in abstract universalideas, which he called “forms.” Leap ahead two millennia, and here is WernerHeisenberg: “I think that modern physics has definitely decided in favor ofPlato. In fact the smallest units of matter are not physical objects in theordinary sense; they are forms, ideas which can be expressed unambiguously onlyin mathematical language.”If the elementary building blocks of matter and energy are conceptual, then theuniverse itself is bubbling up from a set of ideas or forms, too. Thisparticular set of ideas that became our home universe could have othervariations, some of which would be inconceivable to the human mind. One featureof the multiverse, if it actually exists, is that billions of other universesmay be operating on totally different laws of Nature from ours. A law of Natureis simply a mathematical model, and mathematical models are concepts.Let me interject a personal note here. When I first encountered the quantum,which led to a book, Quantum Healing, I was thrilled that physics was in accordwith profound insights from India. Maya, the Sanskrit word usually translated as“illusion,” refers to virtual reality, and the doctrine of Maya holds that theillusion is merely a concept. The parallels went even deeper. Heisenberg heldthat Nature exhibits a phenomenon according to the questions we ask of it—inother words, the qualities of time, space, matter, and energy are extracted fromthe quantum field by the observer. In ancient India, Maya originates through theparticipation of humans seeking confirmation of our inner beliefs. In both casesNature is showing us what we want to see.I was thrilled by the prospect that the inward path of the ancients and theoutward path of modern science had arrived at the same reality. So it came as ashock to discover that contemporary physics has largely turned its back on theinspired quantum pioneers. As a professor at Cal Tech told me, “My graduatestudents know more about physics than Einstein ever did.” This advance intechnical knowledge has been tremendous, but does it justify throwing out whatthe quantum pioneers understood about reality?Einstein at least recognized the danger when he remarked, “So many peopletoday—and even professional scientists—seem to me like someone who has seenthousands of trees but has never seen a forest.” To correct thisshort-sightedness, Einstein advocated that scientists acquire a broad outlookfrom philosophy, which he considered the mark of “a real seeker after truth.” Inthe twenty-first century, alas, fewer forests are being seen today than ever asevery science becomes more specialized and fragmented. You can spend an entirecareer in physics focusing on a single concept like eternal inflation or asingle elementary particle, like the Higgs boson.Cosmic consciousness sounds like something very far away from how we use ourminds in day-to-day life. In reality, however, each person’s mind is projectingcosmic consciousness all the time. Your mind is a fragment of cosmicconsciousness, yet, as in a hologram, a fragment is enough to project the whole.The following exercise will help bring this insight home.EXERCISE: SURFING THE UNIVERSEClose your eyes and imagine that you are standing on a beach, watching the surfroll in. When you have this image firmly in your mind’s eye, start transformingthe waves in various ways. See them become bigger, swelling into the monsterwaves that world-class surfers ride. See them shrink to small chop. Make thewaves turn different colors—red or purple or neon orange. Place yourself on topof the waves, balancing without a surfboard as you ride to shore. If you wish,you can invent your own transformations. Perhaps a mermaid emerges from thewaves, singing her siren song. You get the idea.When you made these creative changes to the surf, reflect on what was happening.You didn’t thumb through a catalog of possibilities. You were free instead tolet your imagination roam. Two people doing this exercise would come up withdifferent creative choices. The possibilities are unlimited and not bound by anyrules. Nothing stops you from turning the Pacific Ocean into pink Jell-O. Itmakes no sense to claim that these creative possibilities are stored in theatoms and molecules of your brain cells. You made conscious choices withoutprecedent, building a unique chain of creative thoughts.But even if all seven billion people on the planet performed this exercise, theywould be doing only one thing—transforming possibility into reality. This onething is occurring all the time, and it is enough to create the universe. In thespring of 1940, one of the most far-seeing physicists in modern times, JohnWheeler, telephoned another far-seeing physicist, Richard Feynman.“Feynman,” Wheeler exclaimed, “I know why all electrons have the same charge andthe same mass.”“Why?”“Because, they are all the same electron!”This startling notion, which became known as the One-Electron Universe, sankinto Feynman’s imagination, although, as he recalls, he didn’t take it seriouslyenough at first. When we look at the physical world, a huge number of electronsexist—trillions send electrical charges through your household current everysecond. Each electron traces a path in time and space, known as a “world line.”Wheeler proposed that a single electron could zigzag all over the place,creating a tangle of world lines. It’s a fascinating alternative to manyelectrons creating many world lines. Now let’s translate this into human terms.Instead of many electrons, substitute many observers, each with his own eyes. Onplanet Earth there would be over seven billion observers. However, thosebillions of observers express the ability to observe, which is one thing. Soit’s entirely plausible that we inhabit a “one-observer universe.” It’s likesaying “All humans draw breath” without having to count how many humans arebreathing. Such is the perspective of cosmic consciousness. I didn’t choose theimage of waves pounding the shore by accident. The ancient Indian seers pointedto the sea and said, “Each wave is an outcropping of the ocean without beingdifferent from the ocean. Do not be fooled by your individual ego. You are anoutcropping of cosmic consciousness without being different from it.”Homo sapiens is the only creature that can choose which perspective to take. Wecan be separate waves of one ocean. The only difference between a one-electronuniverse and a many-electron universe is our perspective. Both are as real as wedecide they are. Or, to put it more strongly, both are only as real as we decidethey are. Standing at the pivot of making this choice, we stand at the pivot ofcreation. Only one thing is happening: possibility is becoming reality. JohnWheeler was also responsible for saying that we live in a participatoryuniverse. I’m only expanding on the same idea. A participatory universe offersinfinite choices; the one thing you can’t choose is not to participate.Once you are in the game, how you play it is entirely open to you. Humans canlook upon creation and explain it any way we choose. Why are there cold viruses,elephants, sequoias, and mice in the world? Some may say God created them onpurpose, while others believe that they emerged from the quantum vacuum throughrandom processes that took billions of years to come to fruition. The mostradical explanation is that Homo sapiens added everything we desired to ourvirtual reality. Each explanation is simply a different story. Beyond stories,cosmic consciousness is creating from within itself. Stories are postcreation;cosmic consciousness is precreation.THE CAUSELESS CAUSEOur role as creators of reality imposes a heavy burden if we view it from thelimitations of human nature. For many centuries the whole thing could be left toGod. The medieval mind, for example, made God the origin of everything in Heavenand on Earth—Thomas Aquinas, the greatest of medieval theologians, presented Godas the “first mover” (primum mobile in Latin). God alone had the knowledge tocreate the universe.Because perfection is a divine attribute, God must have set creation in perfectmotion, while in the fallen world everything that is in motion, even a beatingheart and surging ocean waves, is an imperfect representation of God’s work.When Adam and Eve fell, so did Nature. The first humans were driven out of aperfect natural world into an imperfect one. The Garden of Eden gave way to ahostile wilderness.In the Divine Comedy, which stands as the most complete reflection of medievalcosmology in literature, Dante reached for a visual image of divine perfectionthat his readers could grasp. As the website Danteworlds describes it, “In thePrimum Mobile (‘first mover’)—the swiftest, outermost sphere that imparts motionto the other spheres—Dante sees nine fiery rings whirling about a central pointof intense light.”These nine fiery rings are angelic orders, because in Dante’s religiousworldview there had to be perfected beings assigned to keep creation going.Otherwise, God would have to be engineering everything, an impossibility when hewas the Unmoving Mover by definition. (He is archaic and not correct in Hebrew,but I’m resorting to the masculine for convenience, since he/she/it iscumbersome.) When referring to God, the medieval Christian mind couldn’tviolate—or escape—divine perfection.That obsession survives today, but in a different guise. With no perfectcreation to dream about, we are left with our own imperfections. We feel asbewildered and confused as the biblical Adam and Eve. We feel guilty aboutdespoiling the planet and yet cannot help ourselves, even as Nature crumblesbefore our eyes.This book has proposed that creation unfolds from pure consciousness. There isno divine artist with a picture in mind. There is just creation evolving withoutend. The process has no one story line; it embraces all story lines. It has nomorality. Tragedy is as fascinating to the human imagination as comedy, which iswhy we keep creating both. (Shakespeare presented the whole panorama to hisaudience standing in the pit of the Globe Theatre, and Hollywood keeps the showgoing.)The evolution of consciousness is the only explanation for creation that holdseverything together. It has the advantage of no boundaries. The miraculousstands on the same level playing field as the mundane. At this point I am goingto go out on a limb. If you go to YouTube and enter three search words, Lourdeslevitating Host, you can watch a filmed miracle that occurred in Lourdes,France. As one informed online commentator explains it:> In 1999, during a Mass celebrated by Cardinal Billé, then archbishop of Lyon,> the Host began to levitate just above the paten [the plate used for Eucharist]> from the moment of the epiclesis until the elevation. The prodigy was filmed> for broadcast and a clip of it is making its way around the internet. At the> time, the French bishops decided to keep it quiet. Recently, it was brought to> the attention of a cardinal in the Curia, who took it upon himself to verify> the origin of the clip and ask the current archbishop of Lyon for the position> of the French bishops on the matter. This cardinal in turn passed it on to the> Holy Father. He is concerned that certain bishops were too quick to put the> lid on what seems to be an authentic sign.The existing video is blurry, but it shows what the commentator describes.During this Mass a large Host was used, about the size of a dinner plate. Thelevitation, which lasts several minutes, ends with the elevation of the Host,when the archbishop lifts it up to display to the congregation. The levitation,if that is what we are seeing, raises the Host only an inch or two into the air.I don’t know who is in a position to rule the footage real or a clever digitalhoax, but for me the issue isn’t about miracles. It is about what human beingsare willing to allow into the acceptable picture of reality. To date, millionsof people have seen the video of the levitating Host, and their responses coverthe spectrum. Most people I know are momentarily impressed; others question theblurry images. A few get a strange expression on their faces, as if they wereHoratio and Hamlet had just said, “There are more things in heaven and earth,Horatio, / Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.”You could say that Hamlet is accusing his friend of not dreaming deeply enough.Miracles are similar reminders. The levitating Host may be explained away oneday—after all, antigravity exists in theoretical physics. It might be exposed asa fraud or simply sink into the morass of forgotten experience. Even so,something important happened. A bit of strangeness was allowed to enter ourcollective dream. It takes only a spark to burn down a forest. You never knowwhich strange bit will dispel our collective dream.The time for waking up never grows short. Waking up takes you beyond the boundsof time. Yet it’s hard not to feel the pressure of disaster the closer itapproaches. There is such a thing as a storm so powerful it occurs only onceevery five hundred years, but by the reckoning of meteorologists, twenty-sixsuch storms have occurred in the past decade. If we are going to make cosmicconsciousness matter, we cannot wear rose-colored glasses. Those storms, and thehuman misery they generated, were allowed into virtual reality. Many things haveentered virtual reality to make life nightmarish.The average person isn’t prepared to accept responsibility for thespell/dream/illusion we are entangled in. The accumulation of greenhouse gasescan be explained as divine retribution, or as the outcome of a series of veryunfortunate events, or as human imperfection screwing up one more thing.Self-destruction is part of our nature, but self-creation is infinitely morepowerful. By waking up, metahumans can make right what humans have done wrong.Waking up happens only one person at a time. Reality isn’t a numbers game. It’sa one-player universe, and you and I are enough to move creation itself."},{"pageContent":"A Month of Awakening : 31 Metahuman Lessons[../images/Chop_9781524762988_epub3_013_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"One purpose of this book is to demystify the process of waking up. The directpath is meant to be effortless and natural. The only uncertainty is time—peoplewho want to achieve higher consciousness all begin at a different place, andthis makes a difference. I’ve found in my own experience that desire is apowerful incentive no matter where you start from. If you really want to learnsomething—a new language, French cooking, rock climbing—the process becomesenjoyable. The better you get at learning, the more enjoyable it is.Unlike those things, however, waking up isn’t a skill. There’s no set of rulesor guidelines. Even finding a teacher is fraught with missteps. How does ateacher prove that he’s awake? But every culture that believes in higherconsciousness has, over time, developed a setting for this special kind oflearning, such as an Indian ashram or a Zen Buddhist monastery.These settings fit into the context of each culture. If you don’t happen tobelong to the culture, however, and you’re viewing these settings from theoutside, ashrams and monasteries look alien and exotic. Yet there’s no proofthat a special setting is mandatory. After all, the process of waking up isabout self-awareness. No one can teach you to be self-aware. No one needs to.Consciousness already includes self-awareness. I’ve been arguing in this bookthat existence is consciousness. In other words, you were born with the tools tobecome more self-aware. It’s just a matter of applying them.In the process of waking up, no special lifestyle is required. You live asyou’re living now, by being aware of the world “out there” and the world “inhere.” The only thing new is that you relate to both worlds using newassumptions. You assume that the “real” reality isn’t the same as virtualreality. You assume that you are whole at the level of the true self. You assumethat the true self offers a better way to live, a more conscious way but alsomore creative, open, relaxed, accepting, and free.Assumptions aren’t the same as truth or facts. They need to be tested, which isthe purpose of this section. You are asked to experiment on yourself, spendingtime every day for a month to find out if the direct path works. It’s afortunate time to seek higher consciousness. Stripped of religious trappings andthe fog of mystery, consciousness has entered a new phase as a full-fledgedresearch topic, studied by psychologists, psychotherapists, biologists,philosophers, neuroscientists, and even physicists.This explosion of interest makes for a better setting, in fact, than traditionalashrams and monasteries. You can be fully engaged in everyday life while placingyour deeper attention on waking up. It’s a little odd that someone must learn towake up, but that’s the result of living so long with the conditioned mind.Convinced that the spell/dream/illusion is real, our minds conform to it. Wakingup happens by dismantling the conditioning that keeps us trapped in mentalconstructs. When those constructs begin to fade away, waking up is the state wearrive at.Arriving there is unpredictable and totally personal. It’s best to set out withan open mind and no expectations. Just adopt the attitude that waking up isreal; other people have done it for many centuries, and the only requirement isself-awareness.A DAILY PLANThe lessons in this section are set up to be as flexible as possible. Firstthere’s an axiom or insight for the day. It is followed by a brief explanation,and then an exercise. Read the axiom and explanation at least once, althoughseveral times throughout the day is better, so that your attention is drawn backto the theme of the day. The exercise should be done as often as it takes foryou to feel that it really sank in—one to three times separated throughout yourday should do it. Finally, space has been left for you to journal about yourexperience. Even better would be to keep a separate journal devoted to wakingup.Is a month enough time to completely wake up? I sincerely doubt it, but somepeople have been known to open their eyes one morning, look around, and knowwith certainty that they have awakened. Others gradually change inside and slipinto higher consciousness almost without noticing that the change has takenplace—it became second nature over the years. In all likelihood you will get themost out of repeating these lessons, going back when you feel the desire toreengage with the learning process. There are degrees of being awake, just asthere are skill levels in learning a new language, French cooking, or rockclimbing. Reinforcing your awakened state is part of the process.The lessons get longer as the month goes on, not because they are harder butbecause there is more to see. Every lesson is equally easy.Be open, fluid, and flexible about getting there. The beauty of the direct pathis that each lesson along the way has its own achievements, its own “aha”moments, and its own pleasures. In that spirit, let the waking up begin."},{"pageContent":"To download, go to http://prhlink.com/9781524762988a001[http://prhlink.com/9781524762988a001]DAY 1 THE EVERYDAY EXPERIENCE OF REALITY STARTS WITH PERCEPTIONS—SOUNDS, COLORS,SHAPES, TEXTURES, TASTES, AND SMELLS.Waking up is supposed to be effortless. But it’s important to know where tostart. There is no better place to begin than where you are right this moment.In fact, we will wind up in trouble if we pretend that there is any otherstarting point. You are experiencing your life as it is, a flow of experiencesthat begins with the five senses.FOR TODAYGet in touch with the basics. Sit for a moment and be with your simplestexperience of light, warmth, the smells wafting your way, the taste of food.Relax into the experience. Just observe. The more you are able to relax, themore effortless waking up will be. Relaxing into the moment is the key. In arelaxed state your mental activity calms down, and observing your directexperience happens naturally.YOUR EXPERIENCE: "},{"pageContent":"DAY 2 THE RANGE OF HUMAN PERCEPTION IS A NARROW BANDWIDTH OF RAW SENSATIONS.The five senses are our window on reality, but the opening is a slit, not apicture window. “Seeing is believing” usually only applies to a small fractionof the raw data bombarding the eye every second. The same is true for the otherfour senses. They conspire to deliver a narrow bandwidth of reality. To expandthe bandwidth to increase our perception, is one reason for waking up.FOR TODAYGet in touch with how narrow your sense of reality actually is. Cup your handsover your ears and notice how muffled the world is. Put on sunglasses and noticehow dim the world becomes. Turn off the lights at night and cautiously, withsmall steps, try to navigate a room in your house you are very familiar with.When you take your hands away from your ears, remove your sunglasses, and turnon the lights, your awareness of everything around you expands. Waking upexpands reality even more.YOUR EXPERIENCE: "},{"pageContent":"DAY 3 ALL BIOLOGICAL ORGANISMS HAVE THEIR OWN UNIQUE BANDWIDTH OF SENSORY EXPERIENCE.Experience defines us all, and since we are tuned in to only one bandwidth ofreality—call it the Me Channel—our identity is also narrow. Other living thingsare tuned in to different bandwidths, giving them an existence we can barelyimagine. But humans can change the channel at will. Reality is only as narrow asour awareness. When you wake up, you are tuned in to the entire bandwidth. Thenreality is unlimited.FOR TODAYTake a moment to listen to the birds singing. Each bird is telling its story.Birdsong communicates information from parent to chick, announces the limits ofterritory, attracts a mate, signals danger, and identifies which species thebird belongs to. Notice that you do not understand a single thing on BirdChannel. If it is winter or you hear no birds, consider a dog sniffing the air.A dog’s nose can tell it who has walked by, what was on that person’s shoes, andwhen the incident occurred. Notice that your nose gathers none of theinformation that comes across Dog Channel.YOUR EXPERIENCE: "},{"pageContent":"DAY 4 OUR PHYSICAL BODY IS ALSO A PERCEPTUAL EXPERIENCE.The Me Channel tells you that you have a body. The body you see and feel, thesensations that come through the nervous system, the locations of pleasure andpain—these signals are constantly broadcast on the Me Channel. The body is not athing; it is a confederation of perceptions. Your mind unites these fragmentedperceptions into a coherent image in time and space. If your mind didn’t dothat, the Me Channel would just be transmitting noise.FOR TODAYTake a moment to perceive your body directly. Close your eyes and sit quietly.Let your attention roam from sensation to sensation. Lift your arm and feel itsweight. Rub your fingers together and feel their softness and the texture of theskin. Hear your breath and your heartbeat. It doesn’t matter how many signalsyou pick up, or whether your body feels nice to you or not nice. You havecontacted the real body you have. The experience of the body is the body.Everything else is mental interference. When you wake up, you will accept andenjoy the experience of the body for itself, which is blissful.YOUR EXPERIENCE: "},{"pageContent":"DAY 5 BY ITSELF EACH PERCEPTUAL EXPERIENCE IS A UNIQUE, EVANESCENT, UNGRASPABLE,MOMENTARY SENSATION. OUR SENSES TAKE SNAPSHOTS OF REALITY.Life gives us a constant flow of perceptions that we live by. The five sensesare the pipeline through which everything flows. But it’s not like a continuousflow of water from a faucet. Sensations are much more like rain, which falls onedrop at a time. We make sense of life using fleeting thoughts and sensations. Weignore how evanescent every perception really is—each sensation starts to fadeas soon as it is noticed. Every thought has already vanished by the time itregisters. By waking up, we stop ignoring what is actually happening all thetime. The need to turn fleeting sensations into a running movie or story fadesaway.FOR TODAYPut a grain of salt or sugar on your tongue. Notice how the taste starts todiminish after the first strong taste sensation. Pay attention to how yoursalivary glands quickly reacted and how your throat wanted to swallow. This putsyou in touch with how brief and temporary experience is. But here’s the realpoint. Try to taste what was on your tongue before you placed the salt or sugaron it. You can’t. That taste, which you probably didn’t make note of when itoccurred, has fled forever. Fleeting perceptions are the texture of life.YOUR EXPERIENCE: "},{"pageContent":"DAY 6 THE ONLY CONSTANT IN EVERY SNAPSHOT OF PERCEPTION IS THE PRESENCE OF BEING ANDAWARENESS.Snapshots don’t take themselves—there has to be a photographer behind thecamera. No matter how many thousands of photos a professional photographertakes, he is the constant behind the lens. His job is to look, arrange thesetting, place the lights, focus, and decide if the image satisfies him. You dothe same with reality. Your senses deliver snapshots of raw data, which changein endless ways. The only constant is you, seeing, arranging, turning randombursts of perception into something you can relate to. Most of this happensautomatically, but when you wake up, you see what you’re doing. Then you havemuch more freedom to create.FOR TODAYGet back in touch with the basic units of experience. Sit for a moment and bewith your simplest experience of light, warmth, the smells wafting your way, thetaste in your mouth. Relax into the experience. Notice each sensationspontaneously, wherever your attention wanders. The more you are able to relax,the more effortless waking up will be.

The human brain works by thefiring of neurons. Each firing is a burst of energy, followed by a pause, thenthe next burst. The bursts slice reality into bits of information from the fivesenses. When a train races past you, you are not seeing it in motion. You areseeing bursts of information in your brain that give the illusion of motion.Likewise, you don’t hear continuous sounds.The continuity of your life is a necessary illusion. We have to see the world inmotion so that we can live in motion, not frozen bits of sensation. Right nowyou are experiencing pictures and stories created in your mind through the samepiecing-together process. When you wake up, these pictures and stories will beseen for what they are: artificial constructs of the mind. You will live fromthe “real” reality that is beyond pictures and stories—consciousness itself.FOR TODAYSit in front of a moving image on your TV or computer—this can be anything, frompeople walking around to a news or sports event. Focus on something movingacross the screen from left to right. In reality there is no person movingacross the screen; not a single photon of light is moving across the screen.Instead, bursts of color are happening, each one totally stationary. Bystringing these bursts in a sequence, the illusion of motion is created. Nownotice how hard it is to see the actual process taking place before your veryeyes. Your mind must see motion because, since you were born, the world has beena series of pictures in motion—this is how conditioned you are to accept anillusion as reality.YOUR EXPERIENCE: "},{"pageContent":"DAY 8 THE PHYSICAL BODY AND THE APPEARANCE OF THE PHYSICAL WORLD ARE CREATED IN THEMIND AS CONSTRUCTS FROM SENSATIONS THAT ARE INTERMITTENT AND EPHEMERAL.In daily life we do not investigate how the mind creates a three-dimensionalworld out of random, meaningless bits of sensation. Starting with the simpleworld a baby experiences, everything gets more and more complicated. A newborncannot focus on its hand, which looks like a pink blob floating in the air. Intime the blob becomes a hand attached to the body; it acquires a name; itdevelops many skills. Medicine studies it down to every tissue and cell.This buildup of knowledge occurs in the mind and is created by the mind. A nakedhand has no story to tell; it has no developed skills. Everything a hand canbecome when it belongs to a skilled painter, sculptor, circus performer, chef,or welder is mind-made. The same goes for the whole body and the physical world.We construct virtual reality so that we can have the pictures and stories thatare necessary for being human.FOR TODAYTake a sheet of ordinary 8½ × 11-inch paper and poke a pinhole in the center. Ifyou hold the paper close to your eye, you can see the whole room through thepinhole—this is your mental picture of the room. Now hold the paper one or twoinches from your eye, until you see only parts of familiar objects—just piecesof lamps, chairs, windows, and so on. Try to walk around the room seeing onlythese bits and pieces. It is quite difficult. Deprived of the picture your mindmakes, the room is a disconnected jumble of fragmented images. Reflect on howyou have used the mind to construct the familiar three-dimensional world youaccept at face value.YOUR EXPERIENCE: "},{"pageContent":"DAY 9 THE APPEARANCE OF THE BODY AND THE WORLD ARE ACTIVITIES IN CONSCIOUSNESS—VERBS,NOT NOUNS—CONSTANTLY AND RAPIDLY CHANGING.When you enter a room, go to work, or take a stroll outdoors, the objects yousee appear to be fixed and stable—but they aren’t. Your brain is constantlyfiring to keep the illusion of stability going. Your five senses cooperate byturning photons into pictures and air vibrations into recognizable sounds. Inother words, you are constantly making the world. An ever-changing, endlessprocess is taking place in your awareness. Therefore, the outer world is anever-changing, endless process wearing the disguise of fixed, stable objects. Bywaking up, you see past the mask of matter, reconnecting with the creativeprocess that makes the world.FOR TODAYLook at a photo of a friend, family member, or celebrity. Now turn it upsidedown. Notice that you cannot recognize the face anymore. A hitch has occurred inyour brain, which is conditioned to recognize faces only right side up. Therewas a process to recognizing a face; the face itself is meaningless. Or imagineplacing a photo on a turntable and setting it spinning (you can try this on alazy Susan or a record player). Notice that you cannot make sense of the photowhile it is revolving. The moving world has no reality until the mind constructsit into a human world. Constant change acquires the illusion of stability andnonchange.YOUR EXPERIENCE: "},{"pageContent":"DAY 10 THE MENTAL CONSTRUCT OF THE BODY AND THE WORLD IS THE PRODUCT OF CENTURIES OFCONDITIONING.In daily life we accept the world as a given. Trees, mountains, clouds, and skyare simply there. But these are merely the scenery of virtual reality.Everything in the world beyond raw sensory data is rooted in mythology, history,religion, philosophy, culture, economics, and language. Raw sensation isoverlaid with this complex conditioning. As a result, the body and the world weperceive have been interpreted in advance. They exist as extensions of the humandrama. By waking up, you step out of the drama to be who you really are. You seethat virtual reality is a kind of hand-me-down, which you no longer have tosettle for.FOR TODAYHere is a simple exercise in perception. Contemplate the letter A. When you seteyes on it, you saw a simple sign made with three short strokes of a pen. Butthose strokes have no inherent meaning, as you can instantly determine byturning A on its side or upside down. The meaning of A is embedded in it. It isan ancient meaning, going back to the Phoenician alphabet. Mixed in is theHebrew letter aleph, which stands for the beginning, creation, and God. A issynonymous with one, which connotes individuality and the start of arithmetic. Ais a desirable grade in school, and if you earn enough As, you are likely to bewell-educated and end up prosperous.If a single letter of the alphabet carries so much history and so manyimplications, imagine how complex the fabric of the human world is. We inherit awealth of meanings that hold the world together but also become a burden. (Thinkof all the trouble caused by another letter of the alphabet, I.)YOUR EXPERIENCE: "},{"pageContent":"DAY 11 THE MIND ITSELF IS NOTHING OTHER THAN CONDITIONED AWARENESS.Each of us was born into an interpreted world. Previous generations spent theirlives giving everything a human meaning. Every newborn grows up by learning theropes, and once you can navigate the world—walking, talking, making lifechoices, forming relationships—you find your place in virtual reality. At somepoint you would like to have your own unique experiences. “I want to be me” is apowerful incentive.But the only way to have an experience is to use the mind, and everyone’s mindis totally conditioned. It had no choice. By learning the ropes, each of ussacrificed “I want to be me” in the name of “I want to fit in.” More than socialpressure was at work. The rules of virtual reality require us to accept a sharedset of pictures, stories, beliefs, and habits. By waking up, you get to beyourself beyond the rules. The “real” reality is always new and original.FOR TODAYToday the challenge is to have a thought that is totally your own. Such athought cannot echo anything you’ve heard someone else say or anything you’veread in a book. It can’t be couched in a familiar phrase. It must not grow outof memory, because then you would only be repeating the past. Faced with thissimple challenge, you can see how tightly the conditioned mind holds you in itsgrip. There are well-tried escape routes, like imagination and fantasy, whichget around the rules by not matching reality. There is another escape route,waking up, which allows you to be here now. In the eternal now the conditionedmind has no place.YOUR EXPERIENCE: "},{"pageContent":"DAY 12 VIRTUAL REALITY IS A WEB OF RELATIONSHIPS.The physical world is all about relationships.

There is nothing in the world that can be seen without being embedded inrelationships spreading out in all directions. This web of relationships is theinvisible net that holds everything together. Tangled inside the web, we createendless stories in an ongoing movie.But how do you get out of the web? Humans dream of a realm like Heaven thatallows the relative world to drop away forever. Heaven may be a dream, but aworld beyond isn’t. By waking up, you find yourself in that world, which isconsciousness itself. Beyond all created things lies the womb of creation.FOR TODAYLet your gaze roam the room and pick any object at random.

For humans, however, we created virtual reality and thenstepped into it. The purpose of virtual reality was to allow us a double role,as both the authors of our own stories and the actors who play them out. The tworoles are mind-created, and keeping them separate is confusing. When troublearises, people ask themselves, “Did I do this to myself?” without being able toanswer.Entangled in virtual reality, we find it easier to simply go along and pretendwe play only one role, the actor. Yet the role of author is far more important.Unfortunately, how to be an author has been largely forgotten. Life is tooconfusing already. By waking up, you clearly see your role in the creativeprocess. You are no longer helpless or a victim, any more than Romeo and Julietare victims of Shakespeare. They came to life in their author’s awareness, asyou come to life every day in yours.FOR TODAYPut yourself back at the creative center of things. The next time you order foodor ask to see something in a store, frame the situation this way: I had thethought that put this situation in motion. I put the thought into words. Thewords caused another person to undertake a new action. That action promptsanother action by the cooks in the kitchen (or the manufacturer who made thegoods in a store), who are earning a living to create their own stories, and thesum total of these stories is human history. Therefore, at every moment, mythoughts are at the creative center of history.This is more than a new way to frame a commonplace activity.

To a devout believer, the one thing is God’screation. To most scientists, the one thing is the physical universe. But theseare conditioned responses. Believers cannot consult God to confirm their belief,and scientists cannot confirm where time, space, matter, and energy come from.What if you look at the world directly, without a conditioned response? Youwould see that the one thing is awareness constantly modifying itself. Body,mind, and world are experiences in consciousness. This alone can be verified.Experience is the touchstone of reality. When you wake up, it becomes the onlytouchstone you need. You join the play of consciousness and revel in it.FOR TODAYThe play of consciousness embraces all of creation. Today you can join the gameas an enjoyable experience. Take a moment to do something that makes youhappy—it could be lunch with a friend, appreciating the trees and sky, watchingchildren on the playground. If your enjoyment comes from eating ice cream atmidnight, that’s perfectly fine. Whatever you are doing, relax into yourenjoyment and notice it. Enjoyment is the easiest way to be here now.

It unfolds as one reality. Knowing this, youhave firm ground to stand on—your own awareness. The conditioned mind corruptsand distorts awareness. It colors your perceptions, forcing you to accept thedivision between the inner and outer worlds. Waking up clarifies the truth. Allworlds are experienced in consciousness. There is no need to prove the existenceof the physical world or not to prove it. You are here now, and that is enough.FOR TODAYIt’s not difficult to merge the inner and outer worlds into one. Find a photo ofyourself; it can be your driver’s license or a snapshot. Holding the photo inyour hand, look at yourself in the mirror. Then look at yourself in the photo,and finally, see yourself in your mind’s eye. As you moved from seeing yourphysical body reflected in a mirror, captured on film, and inside your mind,each was an experience in consciousness.

Some dreams are vague, barely morevivid than having a fleeting memory when you are awake. At the opposite extremeare so-called lucid dreams. When you’re having a lucid dream, you have no cluethat it is a dream. You are fully immersed in it and, when you wake up, it’shard to acknowledge that the dream wasn’t real. Likewise, virtual reality is afull-immersion experience. There are few clues to suggest that you are not fullyawake.For that reason, glimpses of clarity, moments of joy, creative insights, and theexperience of meditation are precious. They suggest that you are immersed in avivid, lucid dream. Waking up will come as a surprise—for many people, it’s ashock to realize that they’ve been asleep all their lives. Every passing momentwas like experiencing the vivid now. Once awake, however, now becomes a windowinto pure consciousness. It doesn’t matter what fills the now. What matters isthat you are fully awake to it.FOR TODAYMoments when you see through the spell/dream/illusion often happenspontaneously—they come upon you by surprise. There’s no set way to bring aboutsuch glimpses; the closest you can come is through meditation. Still, you canprepare the ground today for the seed of metareality experience. At any time,take a look around, smile to yourself, and say, “Imagine, this is all a dream,and I am the dreamer.” The smile is important. It’s like anticipating Christmasas a child.

Such an existence is mechanical and routine.Breaking out of virtual reality, now has to become a state of awareness, not aslice of bread. When you wake up, now is a presence; it is the unbrokenexperience of being here.Experiencing this presence, you witness how the stream of consciousness deliversa sequence of fleeting sensations and perceptions. Dividing this stream ofactivity into seconds, minutes, and hours is a mental construct only. When youare awake, you pay more attention to the presence of awareness than to thefleeting events taking place in the mind.FOR TODAYMental activity is very clingy. You have a stake in the thoughts, sensations,images, and feelings that pass through your mind. But you don’t have to have astake in those thoughts, sensations, images, and feelings. Imagine that you aresitting on a commuter train looking out the window. As the scenery rushes by,you don’t see it by picking out each building, tree, car, or person. It’s alljust the passing scenery. If you happen to notice something that stands out, itpasses just as quickly as the things you don’t notice. Now instead of windows,substitute your eyes. You are sitting behind them watching the passing scenery.When you adopt this position, which is known as “witnessing,” you approximatefor a moment what the permanent state of being awake is like.YOUR EXPERIENCE: "},{"pageContent":"DAY 18 CLOCK TIME SLICES UP THE TIMELESS, GIVING IT BEGINNINGS AND ENDINGS. AS ARESULT, THERE IS BIRTH, AGING, AND DEATH.All of virtual reality, from the atom to the human body to the universe, is atimeless process frozen in time. If you say, “I was born in 1961” or “Themeeting starts promptly at three” or “The big bang occurred 13.8 billion yearsago,” you are doing the same thing—freezing a constant fluid process into abeginning, which automatically brings a middle and an end. Beginning, middle,and end are mental constructs. What is the middle of blue? What was the lastthing that happened before time began? When you wake up, being here iscontinuous—actually, it has always been continuous, until beginning, middle, andend were invented. It will come as a great relief to ditch those concepts. Notonly will you find that you are living in the now, but birth, aging, and deathwill become irrelevant.FOR TODAYTo step out of clock time into the timeless, take a moment and look at a color,say the blue of the sky. Try to see beyond the blue. Really try. You will noticethat it is futile to try to think your way there. Mental activity is irrelevant.Nor does it matter if you actually see beyond the blue. By stopping your mindfrom interfering, you escaped clock time, so the only place you can be istimeless. Similarly, try to imagine a time when you didn’t exist. This will alsostop the thinking mind from interfering. You will experience no time when youdidn’t exist. Is there a better definition of eternity?YOUR EXPERIENCE: "},{"pageContent":"DAY 19 REALITY IS THE ENDLESS ACTIVITY OF AWARENESS MODIFYING ITSELF.If someone walked up to you and said, “I want to be here now. Where’s ithappening?” you’d be puzzled. “Now” isn’t a place on the map. Brain connectionscan be mapped in their precise locations, but there is no top, bottom, back, orfront to awareness. The now is continuous because awareness is continuous. Onlyin virtual reality are limitations like beginnings and endings or birth anddeath imposed. When experienced directly, reality flows like a river. But youhave to imagine it as a river that flows in a circle, without starting in themountains and running to the sea.When you are awake, even to describe awareness as a flow is too limiting.Awareness doesn’t need to be active. As it happens, activity is everywhere.Outside of meditation or unexpected moments of silence, the mind is constantlyparticipating in the rise and fall of consciousness as it modifies itself.Beyond the constant buzz of activity, consciousness is silent, pure, unbounded,not needing to do anything. Upon waking up, you identify with pureconsciousness, enjoying the calmness and security it brings.FOR TODAYSilent awareness is always with you, waiting to be noticed. Sit in a quiet placeand say to yourself, “I am _______,” filling in the blank with your full name.With a brief pause between them, say the following things to yourself: “I am[first name],” then “I am,” then “Am,” and finally no thought. Without labels toidentify with, the mind is quiet. As you experience this state, even for amoment, you have found your real identity. The ego emerges from mental activity;your true self emerges from silent awareness.YOUR EXPERIENCE: "},{"pageContent":"DAY 20 TIME IS ONLY ONE KIND OF LIMITATION. SO ARE SPACE, MATTER, AND ENERGY. AWARENESSITSELF IS WITHOUT ANY LIMITATION.Waking up is clearer today than in the past, when the process was considered somysterious that it seemed totally paradoxical. As one ancient metaphor put it,wanting to wake up is like being a thirsty fish. The fish is thirsty onlybecause it doesn’t realize that it is surrounded by the ocean. Likewise, aperson seeking to wake up doesn’t realize that all limitations of the mind arethe result of not knowing that the infinite ocean of consciousness is everywhereat every moment.Limitation begins in the mind but is mirrored by time, space, matter, andenergy. This mirroring effect holds good whether you are asleep or awake. Thedifference is that when you wake up, the physical universe is seen for what itreally is, the play of consciousness. Consciousness has no form or boundaries.Being beyond labels and thoughts, it is inconceivable. It is also who you reallyare.FOR TODAYHold up your hand and start moving it into various positions, each signifying ameaningful gesture. Act out the part of a police officer directing traffic, ateacher pointing to the blackboard, a lover caressing the beloved’s cheek, achef whipping up an omelet—whatever strikes your fancy. Reflect on how your handcarried out whatever your imagination wanted it to. Mind and matter weredifferent appearances of the same consciousness. Likewise, your personal realityconsists of mind acting to coordinate time, space, matter, and energy. Theyexpress the same unlimited possibilities as human imagination.YOUR EXPERIENCE: "},{"pageContent":"DAY 21 VIRTUAL REALITY AROSE FROM THE HUMAN NEED TO LIVE IN LIMITATION. THIS NEED BEGANTHE PROCESS THAT CREATED THE CONDITIONED MIND.Limitation is part of virtual reality, and it seems totally convincing andnecessary. You cannot fly like a bird; you can’t be rich by wishing it were so;if you are hit by a car, you will be seriously injured or killed. I’ve said thatthe conditioned mind edits reality so that it serves human needs. The infinitebecomes finite. We are hemmed in by harsh realities. There is actually nothingwrong with editing the infinite into the finite—after all, you can’t thinkinfinite thoughts all at once, even though you have the capacity to haveinfinite thoughts.The problem is that we’ve forgotten that this editing was done by us. Virtualreality isn’t a given; it was manufactured. The setup is finite, and just as youcan’t think infinite thoughts all at once, humans can’t physically do everythingat once, say everything at once, or desire everything at once. The setup ofvirtual reality suits the self we think we have—and must have.When you wake up, the picture is reversed. You realize that virtual reality is aconstruct. Only consciousness is a given. Only consciousness cannot be created.By waking up, you free yourself from the conditioned mind, the limited self, andthe mind-forged limitations of virtual reality. In freedom you still cannot fly,become rich by wishing it were so, or avoid being injured if a car hits you. Onthe other hand, it’s a bad bet to declare that anything is impossible. Waking uptakes you over a threshold. What awaits on the other side is a vast newterritory of possibilities.FOR TODAYSit for a moment and start to think of things that you’d like to do or be thatare impossible. You might like to be fabulously wealthy or incredibly attractiveor young again—the sky’s the limit. As each thing comes to mind, pause and sayto yourself, “Why not? Why is this impossible?” Wait for a reply and let itunfold, telling you all the reasons you can’t have or be what you want.Now ask yourself, “Who says I can’t?” There is no good answer to this question.Things are impossible not because anybody says so. They are impossible becausethe whole setup of virtual reality says so. All limitations are built intovirtual reality. When anyone says that something is impossible, she is onlyupholding virtual reality. Who says you have to follow suit? Nobody, includingyourself. When this realization sinks in, you begin to glimpse how free youreally are.YOUR EXPERIENCE: "},{"pageContent":"DAY 22 WHEN INFINITE AWARENESS IS EDITED, FORM AND PHENOMENA APPEAR (I.E., THINGS WECAN SEE, HEAR, TOUCH, TASTE, SMELL, AND THINK ABOUT).For the purposes of everyday life, infinity needed to be edited. Everyone agreesabout that, but we forget that there was no rulebook or set of guidelines forediting reality. The only rules are self-imposed. Pure consciousness unfoldedinto the physical universe, imposing time, space, matter, and energy upon itscreation. But pure consciousness didn’t believe it had to do things this way.Billions of other universes with different setups have been proposed by modernphysics.Knowing that rules are self-imposed was never in doubt at the level of pureconsciousness. We inherited this certainty. Art and culture express thecertainty that the human mind can construct any setup while also accepting thesetup of the physical universe. This makes it seem that life has twocompartments—the mental, which is unlimited, and the physical, which is limited.But that’s a mistake. A house isn’t separate from the desire to build a houseand the knowledge of how it is done. Mental and physical are aspects of onething: creative intelligence at play. When you wake up, you will see howcreative intelligence works, and with fascinated curiosity you will become aco-creator of reality.FOR TODAYTo become aware of how creative intelligence unfolds, start with a small object.Whether it is a nail, an earring, or the keys to your car, these things areideas that took physical shape. Now consider something larger, like the EmpireState Building or the Golden Gate Bridge. They too are ideas that took physicalshape. Does it matter that an earring is tiny and the Golden Gate Bridgeimmense? No. Creative intelligence isn’t large or small. Nor is it hard or soft,here but not there, visible or invisible. The ability to create is entirelyself-contained, respecting no limitations of forms and shapes. Creativity needsonly itself. Without creative intelligence, forms, shapes, and events couldn’tarise.Now see yourself in the mirror and say to yourself, “I am infinite creativitythat has taken on a form.” Stop identifying with the form and start identifyingwith the creativity. This is how you wake up.YOUR EXPERIENCE: "},{"pageContent":"DAY 23 EVERY FORM AND PHENOMENON IS ACTUALLY ONE THING: THE MODIFICATION OF THEFORMLESS, THE INFINITE REDUCED TO THE FINITE, PURE AWARENESS GIVEN A BEGINNING,A MIDDLE, AND AN END.The world rewards big thinkers and gives them a place in history. By comparisonwith an Albert Einstein or a Leonardo da Vinci, everyone feels like a littlethinker. But a big thinker isn’t necessarily the biggest thinker. The biggestthinker sees that reality is one thing, creation one process. That’s the wholepicture in one view, which becomes your reality when you wake up.The whole picture becomes clear when the mind stops constantly blurring yourview with interfering thoughts, sensations, images, and feelings. They representthe back-and-forth between you and the outside world. When you wake up, theinterference patterns fall away. You accept as a natural fact that infinite,formless pure consciousness is the source of all things. What makes thisrealization natural is that you see yourself as an expression of one thing, nota jumble of mental and physical activity.FOR TODAYIf you see an object in the outside world, you view it from the outside.Wholeness—the one thing—has no outside. It also has no inside. Therefore, youcan’t view it. Because you are it, you can’t even relate to wholeness in variousways, like accepting it or rejecting it, participating one day and taking timeout the next. When you wake up, you know that you are the one thing. Yet evennow you can stop relating to it in false ways.Today, practice having no attitude toward your mind. Let thoughts arise andfall, and when you are tempted to have an attitude toward what is going on,don’t. Don’t say that one thought is good and another bad. Don’t assign labelslike SMART, DUMB, POSITIVE, or NEGATIVE. The mind is none of those things. It isthe flow of activity from the absolute. To label the mind is like saying thatwholeness is bad, good, positive, negative, and so on. Clearly, wholeness isbeyond all labels. So is your awareness. By not judging your thoughts, you beginto adopt the open, nonjudgmental state of being awake.YOUR EXPERIENCE: "},{"pageContent":"DAY 24 ONLY AWARENESS IS REAL. EVEN AS IT PLAYS THE ROLE OF OBSERVER AND OBSERVED, EVENAS IT CREATES WORLDS “OUT THERE” AND “IN HERE,” ITS OWN NATURE IS UNCHANGING.Awareness exists. Everything else is a passing experience. These two sentenceshave been said and resaid for centuries. This fact shows, at the very least,that human beings looked at reality and found it mysterious. How did changeemerge from nonchange? How did One become Many? The mystery was formulated incountless different ways. Asking “What came before time began?,” as moderncosmology does, is merely a variant on the medieval question “What existedbefore God?”The answer is contained in the question. What came first has been here forever.Change is just a mask worn by nonchange. Once human beings saw the mystery, wesaw our own nature. We are creator and created, One and Many, changingexperience and unchanging awareness. None of this has to be proved or tested.Whether you accept your true nature or not has no bearing on your true nature.It continues to be. On waking up, you see your true nature clearly, and then anew life begins.FOR TODAYTaking a moment or two, let your mind roam across some things you can recallfrom your past—memories of early childhood, your parents, birthdays, school,your first kiss, some things that are sad, and so on. It doesn’t matter what youchoose to see. Now reflect on the one thing they all have in common. You werethere. You are the nonchange in the midst of change. Now you know your truenature.

IT DOESN’T EXIST IN AWARENESSITSELF.When you suffer and feel unhappy, anxious, depressed, or hopeless, yoursuffering feels totally real. You are experiencing something that is a given,feels like a given, rooted in physical pain and mental anguish. But virtualreality, our collective spell/dream/illusion, is a construct. Suffering isembedded in the construct, which is why it feels inevitable. Beliefs aboutsuffering, whether they originate in the doctrine of sin or karma or modernmedical theories, reinforce virtual reality.Waking up doesn’t guarantee that there will never again be physical pain or saddays. The conditioned mind is stubborn, and our body has been bombardedconstantly by signals from the conditioned mind. Shadows of conditioningcontinue to fall (always remembering that the shadows can be light as well asheavy). On waking up, you abandon your allegiance to the conditioned mind, and,from that moment, it begins to fade and lose its grip. You see that freedom fromsuffering is possible and natural. Suffering doesn’t exist in awareness itself,which is your true nature.FOR TODAYWhen people suffer—for example, when they feel depressed or are diagnosed with alife-threatening illness—there’s a temptation to blame themselves. “Did I dothis to myself?” is a question posed out of guilt, and guilt is quick to blame.The best answer is that your suffering is part of virtual reality. You acceptedvirtual reality, which makes your participation in pain and sufferinginevitable. Not that you are doomed; some people escape serious suffering. Butyour participation is a sealed deal, no matter who you are or what happens toyou, unless you make a change.To end suffering, break the deal. When you wake up, the whole contract isannulled. Today you can prepare the way by not buying into pain and suffering assomething fated and inevitable. Think back on some experiences you consider assuffering—they’d include instances of grief, loss, sickness, betrayal, failure,humiliation, and so on. Now sit quietly, go inward, and be with yourself thisminute. You are the same awareness that went through suffering but also notsuffering, that experienced pain but also pleasure, that lost but also gained.For every opposite, you have experienced both poles. Therefore, you are noteither one.You are the unchanging awareness that witnesses change, the screen upon whichevery experience plays without being an experience. This insight holds theentire secret of bringing suffering to an end.YOUR EXPERIENCE: "},{"pageContent":"DAY 26 SUFFERING CONTINUES BECAUSE WE CLING TO MEMORY AND GRASP AT EXPERIENCE. IT IS ANILLUSION TO BELIEVE THAT THE NOW CAN BE GRASPED OR THAT REALITY CAN BE CLUNG TO.Truth feels cold when there’s nothing you can do about it. People feel the truththat life brings suffering, and they hate feeling helpless in the face of thistruth. The result is great inner conflict. On the one hand, we pretend to acceptthat life brings suffering. On the other hand, we struggle to escape the feelingof helplessness. Modern medicine ends part of the confusion and struggle. Asdiseases are conquered, human beings feel more powerful and suffering is pushedaside—for the moment.Suffering in the form of mental anguish has not been alleviated, nor has thefear of disease and aging, or the dread of death. Upgrading virtual reality isthe story of modern technological civilization. (Just as the discovery of newmeans of mechanized death is a downgrade of virtual reality.) Suffering retainsits grip because we want to cling to good experiences and the memory of betterdays. As long as youth, health, and happiness are rooted in time, with goodtimes being preferable to bad times, there is no escape from suffering. Clingingto virtual reality means that suffering is part of the construct.When you wake up, you don’t try to cling or grasp. You don’t store up goodmemories and push down bad ones. There is only being here now. In the now thereis nothing to hold and grasp, nothing to cling to. By no longer clinging, youhave cut off your connection to virtual reality. Then suffering no longer clingsto you.FOR TODAYWhen somebody tells you to let go and stop holding on, does that advice reallyhelp? The most stubborn resentments, affronts, hurts, and anger are holding onto you, not the other way around. No one wakes up after a bitter divorce, losinga job, or being betrayed by a friend, thinking, “Now I’ve got something I reallywant to hold on to.” Instead, the anger and resentment come back of their ownaccord, and they last as long as they decide to last, not as long you want themto last.What you are actually clinging to isn’t bad memories, negative emotions, oldgrudges, and hurt feelings. You are holding on to virtual reality. By waking up,you let go of your allegiance to it, and then the bad stuff stops clinging toyou. Think about something that makes you really angry or resentful. When youhave it in mind, let go. You won’t be able to, not when it is still clinging toyou. In reality, you are where you are. This place is filled with bad thingsthat once happened, hurts and resentments that are in various stages: clingingtightly, starting to let go, or almost faded to nothing. Virtual reality is setup so that, wherever you are, experience clings like barnacles to a ship’s hull.Seeing this gives you a sense of detachment, which is a sign that you are wakingup.YOUR EXPERIENCE: "},{"pageContent":"DAY 27 SUFFERING COMES TO AN END WHEN WE NO LONGER FEAR IMPERMANENCE. AS LONG AS WEHAVE A STAKE IN THE ILLUSION, WE WILL SUFFER.Children are eager to explore the world, and they love how everything ischanging. But at the same time a child wants the security and safety of home.This balance becomes harder to maintain as an adult. Change becomes threateningwhen there’s no one at home to promise safety and security. One way to holdanxiety at bay is to pretend that “I,” the ego-personality, is stable andreliable. “I” has a stake in the world, something to maintain. The ego buildsitself up by every kind of clinging—to pleasure, fantasy, wishful thinking,outworn conditioning, old memories, and false beliefs.All those things are impermanent, so it doesn’t work to build a self with themas a foundation. Fear of change departs only when you base your life on the trueself. As you wake up, the transition from ego to true self happens naturally.FOR TODAYThe best way to feel safe is when you take safety for granted without worryingabout it. Consider the commercials you see on television for life insurance,pharmaceuticals, retirement homes, and burglar alarms. They offer reassurance byfirst bringing up the fear that you are not secure and safe. The tactic worksbecause we don’t really take our personal security for granted—we push anxietyout of sight instead.To feel how real, unshakable security feels, stop reading for a second. Thenstart reading again, and stop again. In the pause between reading these words,you took for granted that you know how to read. There’s no underlying anxietyabout this—you know it for certain—and the same is true for dozens of things youknow how to do. This is how it feels when you are truly secure without hidingfrom underlying anxiety. When you wake up, you will take for granted that youhave always existed and always will. On that basis, you are again like a child,free to explore the world and safe from fear because you are at home always,inside yourself.YOUR EXPERIENCE: "},{"pageContent":"DAY 28 FREEDOM IS THE NATURAL STATE OF EXISTENCE, KNOWING THAT WE ARE AWARE HERE ANDNOW.Virtual reality isn’t reliable when it comes to lasting happiness, security,fulfillment, love, and other things we cherish. Some people enjoy very few ofthose things, and even when we get more than our fair share, we fear possibleloss. It is a bad deal to rely on what is unreliable. You wouldn’t take a jobfrom an employer who says that he will toss a coin every day to determine if youstay or get fired. But we cling to virtual reality with no guarantees thatthings will work out. This is a form of bondage—the worst form, since the widelyheld belief is that there’s no alternative.Real freedom isn’t something you struggle to achieve, hope for, and feelunlikely to win. Freedom is our natural state if we don’t imprison ourselves. Onwaking up, you no longer feel bound to virtual reality. Mental constructs losetheir grip and eventually fade away entirely. Being here now is the same astotal freedom, because the now is gone before anything can lay claim to you. Youexist and you are aware—that’s enough to set you free.FOR TODAYAll of us have our own version of what it feels like to be free and itsopposite, what it feels like to be trapped, hemmed in, and suffocated. Yet theseconcepts disguise the reality, which is that our sense of freedom is alwaysbound up with its opposite. Retirement frees us from the demands of work; havingthe children go off to college frees us from having them under our roof. But ourfreedom is constrained by having a job and becoming a parent in the first place.True freedom isn’t bound up with its opposite. To prove this to yourself, thinkfor a moment and describe what you were doing at 7:37 last Tuesday evening. Whatthoughts were in your head? What words did you say? Even if something memorablesticks with you from last Tuesday, it takes an effort to recall it. You are freefrom 7:37 last Tuesday evening because there is no attachment to it. A moment ofnow has fled and gone. The moment when you started to read this lesson has fledand gone. Your relationship to the now is to experience it, extract what it hasto give, and move on.

We call this progress, and it is—of a sort. The ideas weturn into reality have an agenda and a past. They crop up in a context thataccepts or rejects them. The conditioned mind has no choice but to respond toall kinds of external limitations. Once a wish, hope, or dream manages to turninto reality, we cling to what we have created. We ignore the inevitable ruin ofall things—one day the things we’ve built will be relics like the Parthenon orthe Egyptian pyramids.Creation that is lasting must be built upon the timeless. That’s not possiblewith physical things, and since physical objects represent ideas, even ideascannot truly last in the face of the ravages of time. In the timeless, whatlasts isn’t an idea or a thing but creativity itself. The “stuff” of creation isour own awareness and its infinite capacity to create. By waking up, you createon the basis of being a creator, not on the ideas and things that surround you.You are beyond things and ideas, a conscious being of timeless dimension.FOR TODAYTimeless is a concept that feels very far removed from daily life, but it comescloser when you realize what time is. Time is the process of creation anddestruction. Therefore, if you don’t identify with creation and destruction, youstand in the timeless.

Butcounting noses isn’t how waking up works. If you want to know if human beingscan swim, you only need to find one example. Likewise, one awakened person tellsyou that waking up is possible, and, even more, that everyone is part of theprocess. Waking up isn’t learned; it is not acquired behavior. It is a statethat all of us already exist in. The only thing that happens when you wake up isthat you realize who you really are. Humanity is already free—we wouldn’t behere as conscious beings if that weren’t true. Only the stories we tellourselves block our view of our true nature.This interference pattern, like a fuzzy television picture, doesn’t affectreality. The broadcaster is still sending a clear picture, even if our receiverisn’t picking it up. When you wake up, the signal and the receiver are bothclear and in tune with each other.

In relation to the infinite potential that is our truenature, we feel limited in everyday life. So which is it? Are we actuallylimited, or do we not know that we are unlimited? The answer isn’t given bylooking at conditions on the ground. The richest, smartest, most gifted, andhappiest person can wind up leading a very limited life. The answer is onlyavailable in your own awareness.Sit for a moment and try to think of a forbidden thought. It could be somethingyou have refused to consider for any kind of reason—it is too shameful,outrageous, antisocial, demeaning, or anything else forbidden. The instant sucha thought occurs to you, it is no longer forbidden. In fact, no thought has everbeen truly forbidden. You cannot limit thought, and since thoughts spring upfrom silent awareness, you cannot limit the possibility that any thought will beborn. Because your entire life—and the life of humanity—is based onconsciousness, you too are unlimited. You can stop buying into all the storiesabout birth, death, and everything in between. Knowing that you are unlimitedmeans that no story can limit your possibilities.YOUR EXPERIENCE: "},{"pageContent":"DAY 31 YOU CAN ENJOY THE MOVIE WHILE KNOWING AT THE SAME TIME THAT YOU CREATED THEMOVIE. THAT IS THE AWAKENED STATE.The everyday world operates by opposites. There is a positive and a negativepole to every experience. To navigate through life, people try to grasp thepositive pole, but this effort never frees them from the specter that thenegative will also have its day. The ultimate polarity is attachment anddetachment. Spiritual seekers learn that detachment is positive, because beingattached (i.e., stuck, clinging, buying into the illusion) leads to pain andsuffering.In a land where it always rains, it’s hard to stop using the word wet. In aworld ruled by opposites, it’s hard to stop using a word like detachment. But inthe larger picture there is neither attachment nor detachment. Each depends onthe other; therefore, each leads to the other. Bad breakups show how hard it isto detach from something (or someone) you were deeply attached to. But we haveto relate; that’s what the relative world is all about.In the awakened state, things change. You know that you created the movie, soyou can enjoy it without buying into it. This doesn’t mean that you detachyourself. Directors love the movies they make. But they also don’t keepreminding themselves that they created the movie as they watch it. They take forgranted that they are its creator. Likewise, when you are awake you know thatyou created the movie you are living, but you don’t dwell on it. You are toobusy being immersed in the now. Being a creator sits at the back of yourawareness, and this behind-the-scenes knowledge is enough.FOR TODAYRight now there are things you’re attached to and things you aren’t attached to.If you are a parent with a young child, for example, you allow your child acertain amount of freedom while also stepping in when needed. This alternationbetween standing back and getting involved is the day-to-day business of being aparent. Yet in the back of your mind you know that you are a parent; this isyour status, and you don’t need to bring it to the fore all the time.Now consider how you parent yourself. In the same fashion, you let yourself gosome of the time, while at other times you step in to monitor your behavior. Itis impossible to let yourself go all the time and equally impossible to reinyourself in all the time. Yet no matter which mode you are in, in the back ofyour mind is your sense of self. Sit quietly for a moment and experience yoursense of self. Hasn’t it always been there, through thick and thin? Your senseof self sits at the back of your mind at all times, not needing to be brought tothe fore.When you wake up, the sense of self looms large at first. You experience withastonishment that everything emerges from your sense of self—all thoughts,words, actions, the outside and inside world. Such a realization can’t dawnwithout bringing a sense of wonder and awe. But in time the sense of self,having realized how infinite it is, retreats once more to the back of your mind.Two people can buy popcorn at the movies, with only one of them a wealthy man.Both eat the same bag of popcorn and pay the same price for it.

In the comingdecade, the brain’s trillions of connections will be mapped through a huge,concerted, scientific effort.So it must be shocking to hear me say in this book that anything you can count,measure, calculate, and reduce to data is part of an all-encompassing illusion.Perhaps even more shocking is my argument that whatever you can perceive,imagine, or think about in words inhabits the same illusion. I am not an enemyof the illusion. I believe that people have a right to upgrade it all they like,and I feel sorrow for people whose portion of the illusion is so degraded thatthey suffer.But only waking up allows for the unity of one life to be experienced directly.Otherwise, the world will always be a clash of opposites, founded on thecertainty that humans are capable of the best and the worst. What makes uscapable of listening to our demons one day and blessing the angels the next dayisn’t really human nature, though. It is the state of separation we keepreinforcing, generation after generation.I don’t foresee Homo sapiens taking a collective leap in its evolution, but Iknow it can. Our evolution shifted from the physical to the mental domain tensof thousands of years ago, even when early humans were naked and vulnerable,leading an existence as fraught with threats as any animal caught up in thecontest of predator and prey. It’s a total mystery how we acquiredself-awareness. Once we did, or our hominid ancestors did, the mind was poisedto triumph in every aspect of life. But the active mind isn’t the same asconsciousness. A thought, feeling, or sensation is like a wave that rises andfalls; consciousness is the ocean.This analogy goes back thousands of years in India, and I can’t remember as achild when I first heard it. The words felt like a cliché, however, the way that“Love thy neighbor” or “To be, or not to be, / That is the question” feels likea cliché. Repetition leaches meaning away, even from the most profound sayings.I pondered this obstacle and decided that the direct path has to bring a smallawakening every day; waking up shouldn’t be held out as the ultimate reward atthe end of the spiritual path. In my own life I aim at three kinds ofexperiences. If one of them happens today, I’ve achieved a small awakening. Iftwo or all three happen, the small awakening becomes magnified. Here are thethree experiences:I see reality more clearly.I feel less entangled in habit, memory, outworn beliefs, and old conditioning.I stop clinging to expectations and external rewards.How would these experiences apply in your life?YOU SEE REALITY MORE CLEARLYThis is the experience of perceiving with fresh eyes. You give up old ways ofinterpreting the world around you and your own life. Interpretation is builtinto perception. It is unavoidable that you give names to everything, haveopinions, draw on past experiences, and render judgments about whatever ishappening. The world has been interpreted for you since you were an infant, andyet you have control over this now that you are an adult. The world doesn’t haveto change. If you perceive freshness and renewal, if you wake up with a sense ofoptimism and feel open to the unknown, then every day is a world. You don’t haveto try to live in the present moment—you won’t be able to escape the presentmoment. It will draw you in without resistance, because there is everything togain and nothing to lose when a person lives here and now, rather than repeatingthe past and anticipating the future.YOU FEEL LESS ENTANGLED IN HABIT, MEMORY, OUTWORN BELIEFS, AND OLD CONDITIONINGThis is the feeling of getting unstuck. Virtual reality would be perfectlyacceptable if people felt free to alter it according to their own desires. But agreat deal of life is beyond our control, which leads to a feeling of beingtrapped, confined, limited, and even suffocated. I lump these feelings into thephrase “getting stuck.” By getting unstuck you disentangle yourself from thecomplicated web woven by the ego-personality. This web has become sticky throughthe process of identification. Anytime you say “I am X,” you are further awayfrom being able to say “I am.” As we saw, X can be anything: your name, job,marital status, race, religion, nationality. These and much more become yourpersonal story. “I am” is beyond all stories.YOU STOP CLINGING TO EXPECTATIONS AND EXTERNAL REWARDSThis is the experience of becoming your true self. The ego-personality isconstantly on the lookout for external rewards to validate its worth. If you askpeople, “Which would you rather be—happy simply to exist or rich?” their answeris obvious. The need for external rewards, not just money but status, the rightneighborhood, a new car, social approval, and more, fuels our dependence onthem. Over time the ego-personality has become a dominant force, even whensomeone considers himself unambitious or spiritual—the front pew in church feelsbetter than the last row. But the ego is a false guide, because the totalfulfillment it promises is always over the horizon. Living on expectation goeshand in hand with needing external rewards—there is always a mythical jolt ofpleasure or triumph or wealth, the big score that will make life worthwhile onceand for all. To cut the strings, you need to feel that the absence of externalrewards isn’t painful, because it is offset by inner rewards. The greatest ofthese is the freedom to be yourself.As a result of these three experiences, waking up becomes your life, little bylittle, and then, almost without knowing it, you are participating in the onelife, which is real, radiant, and whole.Because everyone can have small awakenings, the future of our species doesn’thave to be a grand project marked by the great upheavals of war and peace,revolution and backsliding, achieving greatness and losing it again, or playingthe roles of oppressor and oppressed. One person at a time can awaken toreality. It will be enough. The mystery of being human has been hidden from eachof us, which may be why it remains so tantalizing. We have never stopped being aself-created species. If we can create a world of glorious highs without beingfully awake, imagine what we could do with our eyes wide open."},{"pageContent":"ACKNOWLEDGMENTS[../images/Chop_9781524762988_epub3_014_r1.jpg]I feel gratitude every time a new book is finished for the generous andproductive relationship I have with my publisher.
