Happiness is the goal ofevery other goal. Most people are under the impression that happiness comes frombecoming successful, accumulating wealth, being healthy, and having goodrelationships. There is certainly enormous social pressure to believe that theseaccomplishments are the same as achieving happiness. However, this is a mistake.Success, wealth, good health, and nurturing relationships are byproducts ofhappiness, not the cause.When you are happy, you are more likely to make choices that lead to all thesethings. The reverse isn’t true. Everyone has observed people who are deeplyunhappy even after they have attained incredible wealth and success. Good healthcan be taken for granted and abused. And even the happiest family can find itshappiness ruined by a sudden crisis. Unhappy people are not successful, and noamount of money and achievement will change the equation.So let’s shift our gaze beyond external indications to inner happiness, which weall want to attain and yet which remains elusive. In the last few yearspsychologists and brain researchers have undertaken the first serious researchon happiness. Previously, the field of psychology was almost entirely focused ontreating unhappiness, much the way internal medicine is based on treatingdisease. But just as interest in wellness and prevention has dramatically risenin recent years, so has interest in happiness.Surprisingly, one of the most controversial topics in this new field of positivepsychology is whether human beings are actually meant to be happy. Perhaps weare all pursuing an illusion, a fantasy fueled by occasional moments ofhappiness that can never turn into a permanent state. Or perhaps some people aregenetically predisposed to be happy, and they will be the lucky few who escapewhat the rest of us experience, which is a kind of low-level contentment atbest. Some experts contend that happiness occurs by chance, an emotionalsurprise that quickly comes and goes, like a surprise birthday party, leaving nopermanent change once the event is over.Leading researchers in the new field of positive psychology, in particularprofessors Sonja Lyubomirsky, Ed Diener, and Martin Seligman, came up with whatthey call the happiness formula. These researchers found three specific factorsthat could be quantified in a simple equation:H = S + C + VORHAPPINESS = SET POINT + CONDITIONS OF LIVING + VOLUNTARY ACTIVITIESSince this is one of the leading theories of happiness, we’ll explore it beforeshowing that there is a better way to reach the goal. Although it helps pointthe way, the happiness formula doesn’t go deep enough to uncover the real secretof happiness.The first factor, S, is the brain’s set point, which determines how naturallyhappy you are. Unhappy people have a brain mechanism that interprets situationsas problems. Happy people, on the other hand, have a brain mechanism thatinterprets the very same situations as opportunities. So the “glass half full,glass half empty” phenomenon is rooted in the brain, and is “set” in a way thatdoesn’t vary much over time. According to the researchers, a person’s set pointis responsible for something like 40 percent of the experience of happiness.Apparently, this set point is partly genetic. If your parents were unhappy, youhave a higher likelihood of being unhappy as well. But there are also childhoodinfluences to take into account.Children’s brains have neurons that mirror the brains of adults in theirsurroundings. These so-called mirror neurons are responsible for the waychildren learn new behaviors, so the theory goes. As they develop, youngchildren don’t have to imitate their parents in order to learn something new;they only have to observe them, and certain brain cells will fire in a way thatmirrors the activity. For example, a baby being weaned from breast-feedingwatches how her parents eat. As they reach for food and put it into theirmouths, certain areas of their brains light up. Simply watching this activityleads the same areas to light up in the infant’s brain. In this way the newlyforming infant brain learns a new behavior without ever having to go throughtrial and error alone.This model has already been tested in monkeys and theoretically extended tohumans. It provides a physical explanation for something as mysterious asempathy, the ability to feel what someone else is feeling. Some people have thisability; others don’t. A few saintly individuals have so much empathy that theycan hardly bear it when someone else is suffering. Research with MRIs and CATscans suggests that brain function plays a major role in empathy. A child’sneurons mirror the emotions of adults around him, leading the child to actuallyfeel what his parents feel. So if a youngster is surrounded by unhappy adults,his nervous system will be programmed for unhappiness, even before he has anycause for unhappiness himself.Why doesn’t every child learn empathy? Because brain development is wildlycomplex and never the same for two babies. When we were infants, all kinds ofbrain functions were being programmed at the same time, and for some of us,empathy was only assigned a minor role. This is a troubling inequality, and itextends to happiness. When you see the brain has a set point for happiness,traceable either to genetics or childhood influences, it’s all too easy toconclude that nothing can be done about it. However, this would be a mistake,because neither the brain nor your genes are fixed structures; instead, they arein process every minute of your life, constantly changing and evolving. You arestill being influenced at the genetic level by new experiences. Every choice youmake sends chemical signals coursing through your brain, including the choice tobe happy, and each signal helps to shape the brain from year to year.In the overall picture, research has shown that the brain’s set point can bechanged by the following:Drugs that act as mood elevators, which work only in the short term and haveside effects.Cognitive therapy, which changes the brain by helping us change our limitingbeliefs. We all tell ourselves stories in our heads that provoke unhappiness.Repeating the same negative belief over and over (“I am a victim,” “I amunloved,” “Life isn’t fair, something’s wrong with me,” etc.) creates neuralpathways that reinforce negativity by turning it into a habitual way ofthinking. Such beliefs can be replaced with others that are not simply morepositive, but are a better match with reality (I may have been a victim in thepast but I don’t have to remain that way; I can find love if I choose betterplaces to look for it, etc.). In treating patients whose lives are dominated bynegative beliefs, psychologists have found that altering really fundamentalbeliefs can be as effective in changing brain chemistry as prescribing drugs.Meditation, which alters the brain in many positive ways. The physical effectsof sitting quietly and going inward are amazingly extensive. It took a long timeto unravel the puzzle. Researchers had to work against the Western assumptionthat meditation was mystical or at best a kind of religious practice. Now werealize that it activates the prefrontal cortex—the seat of higher thinking—andstimulates the release of neurotransmitters, including dopamine, serotonin,oxytocin, and brain opiates. Each of these naturally occurring brain chemicalshas been linked to different aspects of happiness. Dopamine is anantidepressant; serotonin is associated with increased self-esteem; oxytocin isnow believed to be the pleasure hormone (its levels also elevate during sexualarousal); opiates are the body’s painkillers, which also provide theexhilaration associated with runner’s high. It should be obvious, then, thatmeditation, by creating higher levels of these neurotransmitters, is a moreeffective way of changing the brain’s set point for happiness. No single drugcan simultaneously choreograph the coordinated release of all these chemicals.The second factor in the happiness formula is C, or conditions of living.Because we all want to improve our quality of life, we take it for granted thatmoving from bad conditions to good ones will make us happier. But apparentlythis factor accounts for only 7 to 12 percent of the total happiness experience.If you win the lottery, for example, at first you will be ecstatically happy.But by the end of one year you will have returned to your baseline level ofhappiness or unhappiness. After five years almost all lottery winners reportthat the experience has actually made their lives worse. Experts on stress havecoined the term “eustress,” to describe the stress caused by intenselypleasurable experiences. We all think we’d like to experience this, yet the bodycannot tell the difference between eustress and distress. Either one can triggerthe stress reaction. If you don’t adapt well to stress, good experiences can bejust as taxing as bad ones to your heart, endocrine system, and other vitalorgans and systems.Much like happy events, tragic circumstances, such as a death in the family, abitter divorce, or a catastrophe such as becoming totally paralyzed after aspinal injury, do not significantly influence a person’s level of happiness inthe long term. People have a remarkable ability to adapt to outer circumstances.As Darwin said, the most important factor in survival is neither intelligencenor strength but adaptability. Emotional resilience, the ability to bounce backafter something bad happens, is also one of the strongest indicators for whowill live to be one hundred. Bad things happen to everyone, but being able toadapt afterward is a valuable trait that we come by naturally. Our remarkableability to adapt explains why living conditions score so low as indicators ofoverall happiness.Almost 50 percent of the happiness formula depends on the third factor, V, orvoluntary activities—the things we choose to do every day. What kind of choicemakes us happy? One kind is based on personal pleasure, but surprisingly,researchers did not find that these were the most significant. Increasing yourpersonal pleasure by eating a good meal, drinking champagne, having sex, goingto a movie, and so on will bring a temporary kind of happiness, for a few hoursor at most a day or two. Instant gratification is followed by rapid fall-off.Another kind of choice promotes creative expression or the happiness of anotherperson. In both cases a deeper level of the self is being accessed. According toresearchers, making other people happy proves to be a fast track to happiness,and its effect is long lasting. Turning to creative expression to make yourselfhappy can also generate positive results that last a lifetime.This, in a nutshell, is what current research tells us. However, knowing thehappiness formula doesn’t guarantee true or lasting happiness. Only the thirdfactor, V, reaches into the inner life of a person, opening the door to the onlyplace where I believe we can truly find the secret of happiness. Let’s see whatlies beyond the door. What we find will also answer the most important question:Are humans capable of being truly, lastingly happy?Eastern wisdom traditions point out that life inevitably contains suffering,which comes in many forms, including accidents, misfortune, aging, illness, anddeath. This implies that the pessimists are right when they claim that lastinghappiness is an illusion. Human beings in particular suffer as the result ofmemory and imagination. We carry inside us the wounds of the past and imaginethat the future will bring more pain. Other creatures are not burdened by worryover old age, decrepitude, and death. They don’t hold on to the past, nursinggrievances and resentment.Animals do have memory. If you kick a dog, it will remember the experience andmay snarl at you if it encounters you ten years later. But unlike a human being,a kicked dog won’t plan for ten years how to get even. Our capacity to suffermakes us seek a way out. Therefore, for millions of people, today is plannedaround escaping yesterday’s pain and avoiding pain tomorrow.Instead of trying to escape suffering, Eastern wisdom traditions set aboutdiagnosing suffering the way a physician diagnoses disease. In the Vedic andBuddhist traditions of ancient India, five main causes were linked to sufferingand the unhappiness it causes. 1. Not knowing your true identity 2. Clinging to the idea of permanence in a world that is inherently impermanent 3. Fear of change 4. Identifying with the socially induced hallucination called the ego 5. Fear of deathLife has changed tremendously over the centuries, but these sources of sufferinghave not, so until we solve them, even the most powerful drugs, the most lovingupbringing, and the most selfless efforts to make others happy won’t reallywork. The happiness formula doesn’t address the real ills of human existence,which we all experience. To be alive is to fear change, cling to the ego and itsfalse promises, and fear the arrival of death. We ponder in confusion the mostsimple, basic question: Who am I?Fortunately, it isn’t necessary to wrestle with five causes of suffering. Theyare all contained in the first: ignorance of your true identity. Once youexperience who you really are, all suffering will come to an end. This is, ofcourse, a huge promise, but it has endured for at least three thousand years,waiting for each new generation to discover it. Every discovery is new anddepends on the individual. By nature we are all interested in ourselves. If youtake that interest and go deep inside, you can each find the place where yourtrue self resides, and then the secret of happiness will unfold.Your true identity lies in a core consciousness beyond the mind, intellect, andego. When you look beyond your limited self—the “I” that struggles to findpeace, love, and fulfillment in life—you are on the path to your true identity.We are all connected to the source of creation. Ancient sages have left us abeautiful image for this: a shrine in the heart that hides a small candle whoseflame is eternal. When you have found that flame, you have found enlightenment,and then the darkness of doubt, anger, fear, and ignorance are dispelled.Who you are transcends space, time, and cause-and-effect. Your coreconsciousness is immortal. If you know yourself at this level, you will neversuffer again. Many people equate enlightenment with detachment, a remote stateof isolation that seems frightening, because they assume that the comforts ofeveryday life must be sacrificed. If forced to choose between enlightenment andpersonal pleasure, they will always choose the latter. But knowing your trueidentity doesn’t isolate you or detach you from the fulfillment of everydaylife. On the contrary, this is where you discover the wellspring of allfulfillment.At the source we discover a connection that binds us all. The real you istranspersonal, meaning that it extends beyond the boundaries of your personalself. Transpersonal doesn’t mean “impersonal,” however, which is another thingpeople fear when they think of enlightenment. Once again, the opposite is true.As an inspiring Indian spiritual teacher once put it, “My love radiates likelight from a bonfire. It is focused on none and denied to none.” If you valuelove, peace, and fulfillment, finding your true identity expands those thingsmanyfold.Fortunately, knowing your real self is not difficult. It’s what nature intendedfor us. Once you find the path, one step follows the next without stress andstrain. A small grain of trust is needed at the beginning. In Western societyfew of us are raised to believe that the only permanent cure for unhappiness isenlightenment, but you can experience the truth of this yourself. Even the earlysteps on the path remove some suffering, often dramatically.From where you sit at this moment, reading this page, enlightenment may soundlike a daunting and remote prospect, but in the following pages I will provideseven keys to guide you on your journey. Since what works best is always simple,natural, and effortless, let me offer you a single idea that is tremendouslypowerful.In the world of constant change, there is something that doesn’t change.This simple thought describes the goal of all seeking. If you focus on yourbreath, you can feel it rise and fall. If you focus on your thoughts, you canobserve them come and go as well. Every function in your body ebbs and flows,and in fact, the whole world works the same way.Where does this waxing and waning come from? Where is the nonchange that makeschange possible? It must exist. Without the calm ocean, you couldn’t have waves.Without a quiet mind, you couldn’t have thoughts. Without a so-called groundstate, a domain of infinite potential for matter and energy, physics tells usthat there could be no universe.Observing that all change is based on nonchange is tremendously important. Itpoints up that your existence, which is enmeshed in change, must be rooted in adeeper state of being that never changes. You have a source, the ground state.Think of anything you can observe—a tree, a sunset, the moon at night, or adistant star. You, the observer, and the thing you observe will one day passaway. Both are caught up in impermanence. But the underlying ground statedoesn’t come and go; it remains the same.Enlightenment simply consists of finding a way to reach this ground state.Having found it, you naturally identify with it. You are able to say, “This isthe true me.” That’s all there is to enlightenment, which means the secret tohappiness is in your hands. The seven keys to happiness could also be called theseven keys to enlightenment. They consist of simple, everyday things to considerand do. No drastic change in lifestyle is required. You don’t have to tellanyone else that you are on the path to enlightenment. But others will observethat you are becoming happier and more fulfilled.The process that leads to enlightenment is gradual and requires patience, butfortunately the very act of seeking it yields fruit right here and now. Any stepyou take toward your core consciousness—your ground state, your trueself—obliterates some causes of unhappiness in your life. At the same time, theinnate happiness that is your birthright will blossom. Thus you are on a twofoldpath: to eliminate darkness and to bring on the light."},{"pageContent":"[images/Chop_9780307589729_epub_001_r1.jpg]BE AWAREOF YOUR BODYYour body and the universe are a single field of energy, information, andconsciousness. The body is your connection to the cosmic computer, which isorganizing an infinity of events simultaneously. By listening to your body andresponding to it with awareness, you tap into the field of infinite possibility,where the natural experience is peace, harmony, and joy. There is but one temple in the universe … and that is the human body.—Thomas Carlyle Your first and most reliable guide to happiness is your body. The body isdesigned to support the mind, and working together they create the state knownas happiness. When you’re deciding whether or not to act, ask your body, “How doyou feel about this?” If your body sends back a signal of physical or emotionaldistress, reconsider the action. If your body sends a signal of comfort andeagerness, proceed. Together, mind and body form a single field. It isartificial to separate them as we usually do. Every experience has a physicalcomponent. If you’re hungry, the mind and stomach are hungry together. If youhave an incredible spiritual experience, your heart and liver cells share in it.You cannot have a single thought, sensation, or feeling without your bodyresponding.The first key to happiness tells us that by being aware of your body, you areconnecting to the underlying field of infinite possibilities. Why do mind, body,and spirit feel separate when they are not? Because of lack of awareness.Awareness has tremendous power. It tunes into every cell. It regulates thebody’s countless interactions. Awareness is the invisible, silent agent thatlets your body know what your mind is thinking, and at the same time it sendsfeedback from the body so that the mind feels supported and understood. Ideally,when you experience being loved, your mind will grasp that you are loved, yourcells will be nourished by that love, and your soul will rejoice that you havereached deep enough to find the source of love. Every good thing in lifesaturates your whole being.When mind, body, and spirit are in harmony, happiness is the natural result.Signs of the absence of harmony, on the other hand, are discomfort, pain,depression, anxiety, and illness in general. Unhappiness is a form of feedback.It signals that disharmony has entered the field somewhere—either in mind, body,or spirit. Awareness has become disconnected. Only when we look at the situationin this holistic way can we link health, wholeness, and holiness, for all threeshare the same root word, and all three share the same state of harmony ordisharmony. You may have heard the saying “The issues are in the tissues.” Thisrefers to the fact that psychological issues such as anger, depression,neurosis, hostility, and free-floating anxiety are not simply psychological.They have a correlate in the brain, and through the central nervous system thebrain makes every cell and tissue in your body aware that you have an issue.The entire field quivers at the slightest twinge of pain or pleasure. In otherwords, the field is aware. When you consciously pay attention to what your bodyis telling you, this awareness is tremendously increased. Awareness isn’t thesame as having a thought. A mother is aware of how her child feels withouthaving to think “A is bothering him” or “B has gone wrong.” Awareness isintuitive. All you have to do is pay attention, and awareness grants you accessto every corner of the infinite field. This is like being plugged into thecosmic computer, because when the field organizes the smallest thing increation, it organizes the whole.The opposite is also true. When you withdraw awareness, disruptions occur onmany levels at the same time. Feedback loops no longer operate as they shouldbetween mind and body. The flow of energy and nourishment needed by every cellbegins to diminish. By not paying attention to your body, you are putting it inthe same predicament as a neglected child. How can a child be expected todevelop normally if the parents pay no attention, if they ignore its cries forhelp, and remain indifferent to whether their child is happy or unhappy? Thesame question applies to the body, and it leads to the same answer. The bodydoesn’t stop developing around age twenty, an arbitrary time we call maturity.Constant change is always taking place, all the way down to the level of genes.Change is never neutral. Either it leads to growth, development, and evolutionor it leads in the opposite direction, toward decline, decay, and disorder. Thedifference depends on how you pay attention, because attention is yourconnection to the field of infinite possibilities.The field has certain qualities or attributes that support mind, body, andspirit. There are three qualities that contribute to happiness mostsignificantly. Intelligence is the first. When you listen to your body, youeavesdrop on the mind of the universe. This involves many tasks at once. A humanbody can think thoughts, play a piano, secrete hormones, regulate skintemperature, kill germs, remove toxins, and make a baby all at the same time.That is a miraculous display of intelligence. This intelligence also allows youto make choices that lead to fulfillment.Fulfillment seems mysterious to many people, but we can break it down into itssimplest parts. Fulfillment is the result of right thought, right feelings, andright action. Each area involves the body. We don’t have to create artificialboundaries between a liver cell that makes a right choice and the mind making aright choice. Intelligence embraces both. If it makes a mistake at the chemicalor genetic level, the cell dies or becomes malignant. The mind discriminatesright from wrong at a different level, the level of ethics and morals. Theemotions have their own level, discriminating between nourishing and toxicfeelings, or between loving and harmful relationships. When you are consciouslyaware of your body and what it is telling you, the quality of intelligence isamplified. Its reach is infinite. While the human body performs countlessphysical processes, it tracks the movement of stars and planets, because yourbiological rhythms are actually the symphony of the whole universe. That’s whywe call it the universe—“one verse,” “one song.”The second attribute of the field is creativity. Creativity keeps the flow oflife fresh and new. It prevents inertia; it dispels habit. Much of the time thebody seems stuck in routine. One breath is the same as another, one heartbeatrepeats the action that came before. Simply to process food and air, your cellsmust endlessly repeat the same chemical processes with tremendous accuracy; noimprovisation is allowed. But miraculously, the body also has completeflexibility to adapt to new situations. When you decide to do something new—havea baby, run a marathon, or climb a mountain—billions of cells adapt to yourintention. This flexibility isn’t mechanical. It’s not like your caraccelerating because you push down on the gas pedal. Rather, your body adaptscreatively.You can observe this in how creatively you can think and speak. No two thoughtsare required to be exactly alike; no two sentences demand exactly the samewords. The brain displays a pattern of neural activity to match any thought orsentence, even if that thought or sentence has never before appeared in thehistory of the universe. The ancient Vedic wisdom tradition in India identifiedcreativity with Ananda, or bliss. Bliss is usually described as intense joy, butcells have their own bliss in the form of vitality, flow, and infinite dynamism.To be most alive is to be in bliss. When you are in that state, everything feelspossible. Your body is no longer a burden; you feel light as air. Nothing is oldor stale. Instead, your creative potential is ignited. Creativity depends on theconstant ability of life to refresh itself, and that ability is founded onbliss. You don’t have to force yourself to be blissful—you couldn’t if youtried—but only to be aware. Bliss is innate in awareness, which by its nature islively, alert, effervescent, and joyful. The absence of those things can becorrected simply by accessing deeper awareness.The third attribute of the field is power. Although cells operate on amicroscopic level, they contain the power to survive, thrive, and evolve in anenvironment that erodes entire mountain ranges and dries up vast ancient seas.Power doesn’t mean aggression. The power you don’t see or feel is the greatestpower of all. It organizes a thousand billion cells into one smoothly operatingorganism. It defends against every virus and germ that could harm the body, andmonitors outbreaks of cancer inside the body itself.Once again, it is entirely artificial to put boundaries around this quality ofthe field. Mind, body, and spirit express power in their own ways. The mindexpresses power as attention and intention, turning wisps of thought intooutward achievement. The body expresses power through physical strength andendurance, but also by organizing infinite processes into a coherent whole.Spirit expresses power by turning pure potential into reality. In the Indiantradition, spiritual power, called Shakti, is the most fundamental. When youpossess Shakti, you can turn the invisible into the visible. Whatever youimagine manifests as reality. There are no obstacles between your desire and itsfulfillment.Shakti isn’t mystical. It’s an innate quality of awareness, without whichinvisible molecules of oxygen would drift randomly through the atmosphere. Applyawareness, and those same molecules carry life to every cell in the body. Goingeven deeper, Shakti allows you to cocreate the universe. You are not a passiveobserver in the cosmos. The entire universe is expressing itself through you atthis very minute. It knows itself through you as awareness folds back on itself.Like a transformer that steps down the massive voltage running throughhigh-tension power lines, your body steps down the energy of the universe tohuman scale. But it remains the same power. The infinitesimal electric chargeemitted by a single brain cell is exactly the same as the firestorm ofelectromagnetism in an entire galaxy. This power is channeled through awareness,which means that when you become aware of anything, inside or outside yourself,you are increasing your share of power in the universe.I want you to see that this one simple act—being aware of your body—unleashesintelligence, creativity, and power. Being aware isn’t trivial, and it isn’toptional, either. Once you withdraw your awareness by being distracted,depressed, restless, unhappy, or anxious, the flow of intelligence, creativity,and power is broken off. Most of the “natural” decay and disease seen in old ageis actually the unnatural outcome of decreased awareness, which is felt by everycell and damages every cell.One of the most basic ways to be aware is by grounding yourself in the body.There is no mystery to this. Simply tune in to the feelings in your bodywhenever you’ve been distracted. Let’s say you’re driving a car and somebodycuts you off. Your normal reaction is to be agitated or angry; when you feelthis way, you lose the calm, relaxed focus that connects you to the field. Sotry this: instead of being disrupted by this disruption, just go within and feelthe sensations of your body. Take a deep breath, since that is an easy way tocome back to body awareness.Keep your attention on these distracting sensations until they disappear. Whatyou’ve done is break the chain of stimulus-response by creating a gap, aninterval of nonreaction. This stops the reaction from fueling itself. It remindsthe body of its natural state of harmonious, coordinated self-regulation. Andthat grounds you. Harmonious self-regulation is the body’s ground state. Stresspulls you into another state, of heightened biological responses that trigger aflow of hormones, increase heart rate, stimulate hyper-vigilance of the senses,and many other linked reactions. But these are all temporary; they are emergencymeasures only. If you allow the stress reaction to become a habit, however,disharmony enters the field. The normal state of relaxed awareness tries tocoexist with the agitated state of the stress response, but the two don’t mix;they aren’t meant to exist at the same time.Anytime you’re feeling distracted, overwhelmed, stressed, or overshadowed,there’s a tendency to escape. Denial is a form of escape. Distracting yourselfthrough overwork is an escape. Altering your mind with drugs and alcohol is anescape. What they all have in common is absence of awareness. You numb ordistract yourself under the false belief that being too aware will only increaseyour pain. In reality the opposite is true. Awareness heals, because awarenessis truly whole, and healing is fundamentally a return to wholeness.Science is just beginning to understand the phenomenon of healing. Over millionsof years our bodies evolved to regulate thousands of microscopic processessimultaneously. Disease occurs when the body forgets how to self-regulateitself. Healing occurs when the body remembers how to self-regulate itself.You can be exposed to pneumococcus bacteria, for example, but exposure aloneisn’t enough to create infection. You don’t contract pneumonia if your bodyknows how to make the appropriate antibody, and that ability ultimately comesdown to awareness. Your immune system recognizes an invader, identifies it, andcalls for the appropriate intervention. These are all conscious acts. Healingtherefore cannot be understood unless the mind is as fully conscious as thebody. In medicine we have isolated the nervous system, the endocrine system, thecardiovascular system, but we ignore the healing system. It’s invisible, itincludes every part of the body, it responds to the ghostly wisp of thought andfeeling. Yet nothing is more intelligent, creative, and powerful than thehealing system, the one thing we keep ignoring.Healing should be as constant as breathing, not an isolated process for fendingoff illness. Healing should mean constant communication with the field. We’vecovered the most important step: becoming aware of the sensations in your body.The other thing you can do is begin to become aware of the field that invisiblyunifies everything. How is that done? Ordinarily you focus on things, people,and events—all kinds of outward stimuli. Instead, try looking at the spacesbetween things. If you’re looking at another person, shift your attention to thespace between the two of you. The field exists where we think there isnothing—in the space between thoughts, the space between objects, the spacebetween breaths, the space between movements. It’s all the same space, but whatwe call nothing is lack of awareness. If you are aware, space is full, rich,dynamic. It’s the field of pure potential, the unknown region from which thenext moment and everything in it will emerge.Space is always still. So when you bring your attention to space, you still themind. At the same time your body can begin to release the stored-up frustration,tension, and residues of past stress. In this state of deep relaxation, healingbecomes most active. Your body needs to release the energy that is stuck tooutworn emotions, memories, and traumas. Ideally, you wouldn’t identify withthese negative influences; you wouldn’t hold on to them and add more energy tothem. But we all do. We keep the body from relaxing by constantly puttingexcessive demands, both conscious and unconscious, upon it.If you don’t think your body is operating under the burden of such demands, youcan prove this quite easily. Just relax, sit quietly, and tell your body that itcan do anything it wants. One of the following is likely to happen: deep sighs,drowsiness, a rush of memory, unexpected physical sensations (usually discomfortor tightness), spontaneous emotion, perhaps tears, and a sense of relief. Theseare all signals from your body that it needs space to heal and refresh itself.If your body is actually in a natural state that is self-healing withoutresistance, the experiment will produce the opposite effect. If you sit stilland tell your body to do whatever it wants, one or more of the following willresult: a sense of deep stillness and peace; faint effervescence; lightness;bubbling joy, however faint; and a sense of wonder at the unknown that ispeering through the mask of material existence.In other words, when your body is in a natural state, you are experiencinghappiness. When you’re happy at this effortless level, you regain the memory ofwho you really are. Your consciousness is fulfilled, because in every cell thereis a state of knowingness, joy, and the certainty of immortality. In India wecall this Sat Chit Ananda, or eternal bliss consciousness. In this state ofbeing, your body heals itself simply by knowing itself. What does it know? Thatthe greatest attributes of the divine—omniscience, omnipotence, andomnipresence—are actually the most basic stuff of life.

My body is myconnection to the universe’s infinite supply of energy. If I am feeling lack ofenergy in any way, it means that I am resisting the flow of this infinitesupply. I will ask my body what it needs and will follow its advice. The idealstate is to experience such lightness that I do not feel bounded by my body. Itand the universe are one.2. Before I act on any emotion, I will consult my heart. My heart is a reliableguide when I put my trust in it. It helps me experience empathy, compassion, andlove. The heart is the seat of emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligenceallows me to get in touch with my deepest self. It nurtures all relationships byreminding me to see myself in the other.3. Lightness of being in my body will be my indicator of happiness. If I feelheavy or dull in my body, I will pay special attention, because these feelingsare signs that I am suffering from inertia and the force of habit rather thanexperiencing the potential in every moment for freshness and new life. The bestway to replenish my body is to give it what it needs most, whether it’s sleep,rest, life-giving nourishment, the joy of movement, or communion with Nature."},{"pageContent":"[images/Chop_9780307589729_epub_002_r1.jpg]FIND TRUESELF-ESTEEMTrue self-esteem is not the same thing as improving your self-image. Self-imageresults from what other people think of you. The true self lies beyond images.It can be found at a level of existence that is independent of the good and badopinions of others. It is fearless. It has infinite worth. When you shift youridentity from your self-image to your true self, you will find happiness that noone can take away from you. You yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe, deserve your love andaffection.—BuddhaDo not wish to be anything but what you are, and try to be that perfectly.—St. Francis de Sales Happiness is natural to life because it is part of the self. When you knowyourself, you access happiness at its source. But most people confuse themselveswith their self-image. Our self-image is created when we identify with externalthings. These can be people, events, and situations as well as physical objects.People seek money, for instance, in the belief that the more they have, thehappier they’ll be. Even though we’ve all heard that money can’t buy happiness,the pursuit of money hasn’t ended, because we identify so strongly with how muchmoney we earn, how good our job is, and what kinds of things we own. Money,status, possessions, and the opinions of others have a powerful influence on whowe think we are.One side of the coin is that we crave approval because it bolsters ourself-image. The other side is that we fear disapproval because it diminishes ourself-image. All of this is known as object-referral, which means that youidentify with objects outside yourself. The opposite of object-referral isself-referral, which means you identify with your true being, entirely an innerexperience. True being has five qualities, none of which is created by externalthings, events, or other people. 1. Your true being is connected to all that exists. 2. It has no limitations. 3. It has infinite creativity. 4. It is fearless, and willing to step into the unknown. 5. Intention from the level of being is powerful and can orchestrate synchronicity (a perfect meshing of outside circumstances to bring about your intention).Shifting your sense of identity to your true being frees you to create a life ofabundance, joy, and fulfillment. Being tied to external things leaves youstranded on a superficial level of existence. You don’t have to live there. At adeeper level of existence you can manifest your deepest desires. Once you allowit to, your true being can create the situations, circumstances, andrelationships in your life.When you aren’t manifesting your deepest desires, the root cause is that youhave mistaken who you really are. Object-referral pulls us out of true identityinto false identity. In India this state is known as avidya, or absence of trueknowledge. An ancient saying compares avidya to a millionaire walking thestreets like a beggar because he’s forgotten he has untold wealth in the bank.When you don’t remember who you really are, you have no choice but to fall backupon your ego. Object-referral creates an ego identity from all the events andcircumstances of your past, starting the day you were born. If you look closely,the ego is actually quite insecure. It is addicted to approval, control,security, and power. There’s nothing wrong with any of these things. The problemis becoming addicted to them to the point that without approval, control,security, and power, you feel lost and afraid. As with any addiction, at firstthere’s a sense of pleasure when the ego is in charge: “I’m in control; othersgive in to what I want.” “I’m secure because no one challenges me.” “I’mpowerful because others feel inferior in my presence.” The ego tries toconstruct all these situations, and it can achieve them, at least partially. Yetvery soon the pleasure goes away, eroded by gnawing doubt and fear. Those wecontrol and have power over might turn the tables, and then look what happens.If you want to know how strongly you identify with your ego as opposed to yourtrue being, there’s no mystery about it. The ego has the opposite qualities fromthe five we described before. 1. The ego feels isolated and alone. Therefore it needs outside validation in order to belong and have worth. 2. The ego feels limited and bounded. Without power and control over others, it fears that its helplessness will be exposed. 3. The ego prefers routine and habit over creativity. It finds security in making today the same as the day before. 4. The ego fears the unknown more than anything else. This is because it sees the unknown as a place of darkness and emptiness. 5. The ego struggles to get what it wants. It assumes that without struggle, its needs would never be fulfilled; this reflects a deep sense of inner lack.As you can see, the central theme of the ego is insecurity. Living your lifefrom the ego puts you at the mercy of every stranger on the street. A moment offlattery creates happiness; a sarcastic comment, and you are wounded. So how dowe shift to our true being? Many people try to make such a shift by fightingagainst the ego, but this is a trap. This is the ultimate melodrama of the ego,to constantly struggle and never reach real fulfillment, peace, and happiness.In any case, the ego will resist the shift you want to make, because it sensesits own destruction in your search to find your true being.This fear is totally unfounded. True being achieves everything the egowants—peace, fulfillment, joy, a sense of complete security—because all of thosequalities reside in being. You don’t have to struggle to find them. So the realproblem is that the path your ego has set you on was the wrong path to beginwith. The ego becomes depressed when it can’t get what it wants; it feels like afailure. What it fails to realize is that you don’t fail when what you wantedwas unattainable to begin with.The ego was never on the right path. Object-referral will never lead to securityand safety, fulfillment and satisfaction. So the real question is how to coaxthe ego out of its misguided ways while at the same time ending this lifelonghabit of identifying with external objects.First, notice what you are doing. Remember, awareness is the key to change.Almost everyone goes around trying to earn the approval of others, repeating apattern that goes back to infancy, when we felt we had to earn our parents’love. Without it, we would feel totally lost; we even thought we’d die—and wemight have. But now we are adults. Notice how easily you are still wounded bysmall slights, how deeply unhappy you still feel when someone you love doesn’tpay enough attention to you or seems to move away. Become aware of thesehabitual feelings. The memory of being wounded in the past makes you place undueimportance on what a stranger thinks of you. A child’s emotional neediness makesit hard to accept that someone you love may simply need some space now and then.Once you open the door to awareness, don’t fight against the fear and insecurityyou have released. Awareness has healing power if you simply look and allow. Apainful slight comes your way; you feel wounded. Be with that feeling and itwill dissipate. Your ego wants you to remember the past out of a mistaken beliefthat you must keep defending yourself over and over. Remembering what hurt usbefore, we direct our energies toward making certain that an old hurt will notrepeat itself. But trying to impose the past on the present will never wipe outthe threat of being hurt.To correct this mistake, just ask yourself, “Do I recognize this feeling ofbeing wounded? Is it old or new?” If you are being honest, you will immediatelysee that it’s a very old feeling. The past is reaching out to grab you. Now askthe next question: “How much good has it ever done me to remember my old hurts?”Again, if you are honest, you will see that it has done you no good whatever. Ifrecalling old hurts prevented you from being hurt here and now, you wouldn’tfeel so bad. You wouldn’t be so vulnerable to external disapproval. If your egowas on the right path, it wouldn’t have this toxic storehouse of old pain.Using simple awareness you can defuse old hurts by no longer clinging to thebelief that they are doing you some good. The ego has many subtle ways ofpersuading you that you must repeat today all the tactics that didn’t workyesterday. Instead of playing its game, just witness what is going on. You willfind it challenging to see through the whole game, because it has its positiveside. Your past also contains moments of joy, success, love, and fulfillment.Dredging up those positive experiences, the ego whispers, “See? You’re on theright track. I will bring you more of the same. Trust me.”By bringing up insecurity from the past but mixing it with memories offulfillment, the ego convinces you of an illusion: that one day your self-imagewill be ideal. You will look in the mirror and see only the good things thatcreated your self-image and none of the bad. Ironically, by pursuing an ideal,you wind up losing your true self, which is ideal to begin with.Instead of trying to live up to your ideal self-image, surrender to thesimplicity and innocence of being. Once you know who you really are, being isenough. There is no need for struggle. Your true self is the self of theuniverse. What more can you want? When you have creativity, feel fearless, canstep into the unknown, and have the power of intention, everything has beengiven to you.Awareness requires practice and patience. It takes time for the fruit to ripenbefore it falls. But as the process deepens, you will notice more ease,lightheartedness, joy, and synchronicity in your life. These are signs that youare connected to your true being.Remember, the ego has been shaping your sense of self for many years. It hasbecome second nature. Even after people accept the vision of a true self, theygo around fighting against their bad habits, adopting regimens and disciplinesthat are supposed to bring self-actualization. But consider what it means to beself-actualized. A self-actualized person is somebody who needs no approval andis free of both criticism and flattery, someone who feels neither superior toanyone nor inferior to anyone, someone who experiences what it’s like to actfearlessly because they are detached from the influence of situations,circumstances, events, and relationships. We can’t build those qualities fromthe materials the ego supplies. Everything your true self stands for isindependent of the image the ego has so carefully assembled to feel good aboutitself.It helps to keep in mind what is real and what is illusory:Abundance is real. Lack is an illusion.Being good is real. Trying to be good is an illusion.Surrender is real. Holding on is an illusion.This moment is real. The past is an illusion.You are real. Who you think you are is an illusion.Self-referral allows you to see—and to accept—reality. By turning outsideyourself, you are only reinforcing unreality. And unreality, unfortunately, iswhat our culture is selling. Whenever you find yourself trying to impresssomebody else, stop for a moment. Consider what’s going on. Ask yourself, “Whydoes this person care if I am better or worse than he is? Because we are bothbuying into the same external references. He needs me as much as I need him.”Notice how much effort you are spending to impress people who will then turnaround and try to impress someone else. The cycle never ends, because it’s basedon mutual insecurity.When you make the shift to self-referral, however, this self-defeating behaviorends. You alone are the judge of your worth, and your goal is to discoverinfinite worth in yourself, no matter what anyone else thinks. There is greatfreedom in this realization. I remember reading about a great Russian pianistwhose talent awed everyone, even his rivals. He had learned almost every pieceof classical music and had total recall. His technique was superhuman.Fiendishly difficult passages were child’s play to him. Yet when he came tovisit friends, he made no demands for respect and admiration. He never drewattention to himself. When it was time to go to bed, he was satisfied to curl upin a blanket underneath the piano in the living room.You can imagine how his friends regarded him. They had even more awe and respectfor the great man than if he had demanded it, or thought he deserved it. Ininnocence and simplicity there is natural greatness. You can’t create thisquality. Your being radiates it, and only by discovering your being can youradiate the beauty and truth that are natural to life. [images/Chop_9780307589729_epub_L02_r1.jpg]TO ACTIVATE THE Second KeyIN EVERYDAY LIFE, I PROMISE MYSELFTO DO THE FOLLOWING:1. I will observe myself in difficult situations without judgment. I will simplywitness myself until I no longer feel pressured and distressed. Because the egois a very constricted version of my true self, it creates a sensation oftightness and contraction in the body. This is usually felt in the chest, heart,stomach, solar plexus, shoulders, neck, or back. Whenever my ego self is tryingto dominate a situation, I will feel discomfort in one of these places. At sucha moment, it is enough to be aware that my ego is creating the sensation. Byobserving what the ego is doing, I can separate from a false sense of self.2. I will question my motivation in the choices I make. The ego’s motivation isalways rooted in its addiction to power, control, security, and approval. Thetrue self is always motivated by love. Today I will begin to shift to my trueself by being aware of my motivations and noticing how much is love and how muchis ego.3. I will recapitulate my day when I go to bed at night, observing every eventof the day as a neutral observer. I will do this for five minutes, letting thewhole day unspool like a movie in my mind. As I watch I will ask to become awareof where I was acting out of ego and where I was acting from my true self."},{"pageContent":"[images/Chop_9780307589729_epub_003_r1.jpg]DETOXIFYYOUR LIFEYour natural state is one of joy, peace, and spontaneous fulfillment. When youare not experiencing this state, some contamination is present in body or mind.Contamination can be the result of toxic emotions, habits, and relationships, aswell as toxic substances. All of these are rooted first in the mind as theresult of conditioning. Therefore, the solution to toxicity in your life lies atthe level where the mind has lost its natural state. Such conditioning beginsvery early in life. The first symptoms are toxic emotions like anger, anxiety,guilt, and shame. As one grows, this is followed by poor self-esteem, toxicrelationships, and lifestyle imbalances. In order to detoxify your life, youneed to learn how to reverse this entire range of conditioning. Who shall ascend to the hill of the Lord? Or who shall stand in his holy place?He who has clean hands and a pure heart.—Psalm 24 The roots of unhappiness are often invisible. This is especially true of theconditioning that creates toxicity in a person’s life. The most powerfulconditioning exists at a subtle level of the mind. It begins in the first yearof a child’s life, as the infant brain learns how to think, feel, and behavefrom influences in the home. Conditioning becomes a dominant feature in all ofus by the time we’re toddlers.This is when we set lifelong patterns into our brains. Even today you arereplaying scenarios you learned when you were two or three. Consider a smallchild out with his mother. He sees a giant lollipop and wants one. What does hedo? The most common pattern is the following: First he is nice, asking in acajoling voice if Mommy will buy him a lollipop. If this tactic doesn’t work, hetries the opposite, acting nasty. He whines and cries and makes a scene. If thisdoesn’t work, the next step is to become stubborn and indifferent. He refuses topay attention to his mother, who wants him to stop being unhappy and difficult.This is a subtler approach than nice or nasty. If stubbornness fails, the lastscenario is to play the victim—poor me, no one loves me enough to buy me alollipop. When the mother finally gives in, her child becomes conditioned,thinking he’s discovered something that “works.”Simple as this emotional cycle might sound, millions of adults continue to actit out, using the same belief that their tactics “work” to get them what theywant. The problem with this conditioning is that by manipulating others, younever really get what you want, which is greater love, peace, and joy. Becauseconditioning trains the brain into a false sense of happiness, you are actuallymanipulating yourself. You become the kind of person who doesn’t know how to beanything other than nice, nasty, stubborn, or a victim.Conditioning is the subtlest form of toxicity. You cannot reach true happinesswithout escaping your mental conditioning. In our society there’s a wave ofinterest in leading a life that’s more natural, free of toxic substances.Purification of every type can be beneficial. But the secret to detoxifying yourbody lies more in the mind than anywhere else. There are seven steps to riddingyourself of a toxin at the subtle level:Step 1. Take responsibility for your present response.Step 2. Witness what you are feeling.Step 3. Label your feeling.Step 4. Express what you feel.Step 5. Share what you feel.Step 6. Release the toxic feeling through ritual.Step 7. Celebrate the release and move on.These seven steps apply whether you are trying to change a toxic emotion, habit,craving, or relationship, because your past conditioning lies at the heart ofall of them.Take responsibility. First, give up blame and guilt. Escaping your unhappinesstoday means finding a creative way to alter your own conditioned response, whichis rooted in yesterday. When you don’t take responsibility, you are putting yourfate into someone else’s hands. If you blame someone else, you are waiting forthat person to change so that you can feel better. How long does that take? Youcould be waiting for the rest of your life. It’s difficult enough to changeyourself. Release the need to change anyone else.Witness your feeling. Conditioning trains you to feel the same way over and overevery time you meet the same situation. This is frustrating because as soon asthe old response rises, you become tangled in it. What you need is a clearplace, the place of witnessing. Witnessing means that you are present with youremotion but not being used by it. The best way to witness is to locate where thefeeling is in your body. Toxic emotions are usually located in one of the subtlecenters known in Sanskrit as the chakras. Anger is felt in the gut, nervousnessin the stomach, fear in the heart, frustration in the throat, sexual tension inthe genital area. There’s no need to get complicated here, however. When askedwhat kind of toxic feeling they have, most people come up with fear and anger.When you have those feelings, don’t get involved in “what” they are saying.Instead, feel “where” in our body they are saying it. Locating a feeling in yourbody bypasses the inner mental chatter that keeps such feelings alive.Label your feeling. Whatever sensation you find in your body, give it a name.Use very simple words: fear, anger, hostility, frustration, shame, guilt,jealousy. Don’t use judgmental words like betrayed, disappointed, and hurt—anyword that implies blaming someone else. Naming your feeling is a way ofrecognizing what you are dealing with. Because you are being simple—andtruthful—you aren’t falling for the long, complicated story that we are alltempted to rehash when we get upset. Every story is about one thing, the past.Your sensations and emotions are in the present.Express the feeling. Any emotion becomes more toxic when you bottle it up.Expressing it leads to release, which is purifying to body and mind. This stepisn’t about expressing how much you hate or blame someone else, but since younaturally want to tell your side, first express your feeling from your point ofview by writing it down. Then express it from the other person’s point of view,which is more difficult. Then write down your position from a third-partyperspective, as if you were covering it for the New York Times. When you gothrough all three perspectives, the conflict, anger, or fear you are feelingbegins to lose its energy. You have expanded your awareness. Expansion allowstrapped energy to flow; contraction keeps the energy bottled up to fester. Thisis a useful rule, because everyone’s first reaction is to contract into a singlepoint of view, their own.Share your feeling. Now expand beyond your private perspective, allowing othersto participate. Share your feeling with someone you trust. Share the wholeprocess you have been going through, including all three points of view. Don’tjust gripe or make the case for your own point of view. Your aim is to get atrue reflection, which the right listener can provide.Let go through ritual. Devise your own ceremony that symbolically purifies yourlife of this particular toxin. You are invoking the age-old power of symbols,part of every culture. Having gone through this process, you will find that youno longer need to hold on. You would rather be the person who is free of thistoxic feeling. Come up with a ritual that you will remember and that issignificant for you personally—throwing a note in the river, giving your burdento the Virgin Mary, tossing your grievance into the sea wrapped around arock—whatever ritual allows you to say, “From this moment on I’m free.” You cando this privately, but many people want witnesses to validate their release andhelp them to remember its significance.Celebrate and move on. Now it’s time to honor your release through shared joyand gratitude. You will be celebrating an ending and a beginning. The occasiondoesn’t have to be boisterous or showy. You are giving a gift to yourself. Thisis symbolic in its importance, because in celebration you validate that youdeserve to be free and happy. Then move on.Not everyone is comfortable with all seven steps. Try them out anyway, becauseconditioning has a habit of saying, “You don’t need to change. You’re okay theway you are.” But if you are feeling discouraged, depressed, and anxious, thatvoice is lying. However familiar it sounds, it’s the voice of defeat; it isworking against your happiness.These seven steps allow you to establish new patterns for coping in a new way.Don’t rush through them or be tempted to skip ahead. Let each step have its ownintegrity. That is the only way to escape the past, which is by filling in thepresent with new behavior. The time may come when you don’t have to go throughall seven steps because you’ve become skilled at recognizing your feelings,witnessing them, and then moving the toxic energy that glues them in place.Eventually you may find that you can automatically see your situation fromseveral points of view. For now, though, be dedicated to every step of innerpurification.Once you start to feel emotionally free because you are no longer holding on,you have opened the space to detoxify your life in general. You will find thatyou want simplicity in your life, because happiness is simple. Before, it waseasy to become entangled in superfluous things at every level—too manyactivities, possessions, buried feelings, and decisions that never get made.When you’re ready, however, everything superfluous can be released. Here’s abasic checklist. 1. Declutter your surroundings. 2. If you buy something, give something away. 3. Spend money to help the environment, returning a fraction of Nature’s gifts to you. 4. Do something that’s not for profit. 5. Be generous. 6. Be lavish in your giving, particularly with intangibles. 7. Nourish your body instead of defiling it.Life is either complicated and getting more complicated, or it’s simple andgetting simpler. The main thing is to move from the first state to the second.Emotional conditioning is where it begins, always. Therefore, every time youescape your old conditioning, even in tiny ways that may not seem thatsignificant, you are forming more efficient neural networks in your brain. Inplain language, you are becoming clearheaded. Instead of feeling undecidedbetween A or B, you are teaching your brain to feel the world directly. This newway of feeling has limitless possibilities. That’s the difference between beingconditioned and being unconditioned—in the latter state you give yourself somuch more of life’s infinite potential. In the end, there is only one toxin.It’s whatever robs you of your true self. Your true self breathes in completefreedom of choice. Every day it grows toward untold possibilities. When youfinally become free of all conditioning, you will be true and purified at thesame time. [images/Chop_9780307589729_epub_L02_r1.jpg]TO ACTIVATE THE Third keyIN EVERYDAY LIFE, I PROMISE MYSELFTO DO THE FOLLOWING:1. I will pay attention to the seven-step process whenever a toxic emotion comesup. This begins by taking responsibility for my own responses and not blamingothers. Any response that makes me unhappy is mine to change. I will find thepower to change by escaping my old conditioning, which keeps me unhappy. This isthe most potent way to detoxify.2. Before I put anything in my body, I will ask if it is nourishing me or not.Nourishment can come in the form of pure food but also pure emotions and allhealing influences. I will not force any habit to change. If I am addinganything toxic to my life—whether in the form of substances, emotions, orrelationships—I will not fight against my impulses. Instead, I will discoverchange at the root cause, which is emotional conditioning.3. I will take a step to simplify my life. Whenever I see that anything hasbecome too complicated, I see that it is leading only to more complications. Myaim is to be free of the superfluous things that weigh me down. First comessimplicity of spirit, which has nothing to do with externals and everything todo with the happiness that accompanies my true self."},{"pageContent":"[images/Chop_9780307589729_epub_004_r1.jpg]GIVE UPBEING RIGHTAn enormous amount of energy becomes available once you give up the need to beright. Being right implies that someone else must be wrong. All relationshipsare damaged by a confrontation between right and wrong. The result is greatsuffering and conflict in the world. To give up the need to be right doesn’tmean that you don’t have a point of view. But you can give up your need todefend your point of view. In a state of defenselessness, we find invincibility,because there is no longer anything to attack. We are all a single consciousnesswith unique ways of experiencing the world. Wholeness is a state of profoundpeace and happiness. If you never assume importance, you never lose it.—Tao Te ChingHe who accepts Nature’s flow is all-cherishing.—Tao Te Ching Most people are trapped trying to impose their viewpoint on the world. Theycarry around beliefs about what is right and wrong, and they hold on to thesebeliefs for years. “I am right” brings comfort, but not true happiness. Thepeople you feel wronged by will never apologize and make your wounds andgrievances go away. The people you judge against will remain isolated from you.No one has ever been made happy by proving that they are right. The only resultis conflict and confrontation, because the need to be right always makes someoneelse wrong.There is no such thing as one and only one correct perspective. Right iswhatever conforms to your perception. You see the world as you are. Others seethe world as they are, too. This insight is tremendously liberating because,first of all, it makes you unique. Ultimately it makes you a cocreator with God.For as your consciousness expands, so does reality. Tremendous hidden potentialis revealed.The opposite happens if you insist upon being right. Because others willdisagree, your need to be right will generate antagonism and rejection. As weare all too sadly aware, if the need to be right is rigid and fierce enough,wars ensue, often in the name of God. If the world is a mirror of who you are,it is always reflecting a point of view. Objectivity is an illusion of the ego,created to bolster its insistence that what it sees is right. It’s tragic thatpeople sacrifice the real goal of life, which is increasing joy and happiness,for the cold comfort of judging others and feeling superior to them. If you seethe world with judgment instead of love, that’s the world you will inhabit.Conflicts arise as a result of not understanding that there are as many pointsof view as there are people. Our unique points of view are a gift. We live in auniverse reflecting who we are, which we should cherish and celebrate. Instead,we rush to defend our tiny piece of it. Consider how relationships develop. Weget along well with someone else who agrees with our point of view. We feel anintimate connection; we feel validated in their presence. Then the spell isbroken: it turns out that the other person has many opinions and beliefs withwhich we don’t agree at all. At this point, the war between right and wrongstarts, and the road to unhappiness unspools before us.The very fact that you are in an intimate relationship makes it even morepainful to find areas of disagreement. At the subtle emotional level you feelabandoned. The beautiful sense of merging with someone you love is shattered. Atthis point love is compromised, as both people experience the return of the ego,which says, “I am right. My way of doing things is the only way. If you reallyloved me, you’d give in.” But in reality love hasn’t failed. It was just blockedby the need to be right, to cling to your own viewpoint instead of surrenderingto what love would do. To the ego, however, surrender is defeat and disgrace.If you are mindful of this fact, then every time the urge to be right surfacesin your awareness, look at your circumstances in context. Is it possible thatsomeone else’s viewpoint is as valid as yours? Since the equality of viewpointsis a given, now it becomes possible to let go of the win-lose scenario. Askyourself, “What do I really want out of the situation, to be right or to behappy?” Can you see that the two are not the same? When you give in to your needto be right, you are turning your back on love, communion, and ultimately unity.Unity is the realization that at the deepest level everyone shares the sameconsciousness, which is the source of all love and joy.The more you accept this, the less need you will have to be judgmental. As yourexperience of not needing to be right deepens, the mind becomes quieter. Youstart to feel more empathy, and your perception widens. A knowingness arisesthat encloses both you and the person who disagrees with you. As you relax andbecome less defensive, you lose your obsession with definitions, labels,descriptions, evaluations, analysis, and judgment. These are all part of theego’s battery of defenses. They work tremendously well in starting arguments andwars; they work miserably in bringing about peace.When the need to be right fades, we no longer have so many grievances andresentments, which are the fallout of making someone else wrong. It takes aperception of wrong to create victims. But aren’t there real victims in theworld, people who have received terrible injustice and ill treatment? Theinjustice is very real and undeniable. But the label of “victim” is somethingelse—it’s a psychological wound. A person scarred by it cannot help butconstruct a story that every new experience reinforces: “I am hurt by life, mysituation is weak and wounded. I resent those who have power over me. Mygrievance has become who I am.” In the end, to be a victim is actually a form ofself-judgment. In the name of having been wounded, you wound yourself every dayby assuming the victim’s role.Going beyond resentment detaches you from anger and hostility. Anger closes thedoor to the realm of spirit. As much as you feel justified in harboring yourgrievances, at a deeper level you have tied yourself to the one who injured you.That connection becomes so important that it obscures the connection to spirit,your higher self, and your soul. People frequently use spirituality to justifytheir moral outrage at the world’s inhumanity, which falls so horribly short ofthe ideal. While it is easy to have empathy for this perspective, it’s alsoimportant to recognize that even moral outrage is rage. Since consciousness is afield that embraces everyone, the result is that even more anger, resentment,and hostility are being added to the field.Outrage tends to become an excuse for inaction. The people who actually combatthe world’s injustice are not consumed by anger. They are clearheaded,self-possessed, and certain as to where their values lie. They can distinguishbetween what is past and gone, about which nothing can be done, and what ispresent and therefore correctable. Einstein famously said, “No problem can besolved at the level of consciousness in which it was conceived.” This is worthremembering whenever you are tempted to rationalize your anger as righteous.Righteousness never solved anything. It just fuels more anger; it provokesdeeper antagonism. Above all, it defies Einstein’s rule: The level of thesolution is always different from the level of the problem.To get beyond the level of the problem, you must see yourself clearly. Manypeople don’t even know when they are defending their need to be right. The signsare not always anger and resentment. But righteous behavior always has onecommon denominator: the refusal to surrender. Only surrender brings freedom fromjudgment. When you are dominated by your ego, surrender feels like total defeat.The ego thrives under the following conditions:You get what you want.Others agree to follow your agenda.There is a sense of self-control.Right and wrong are clearly demarcated.Nobody crosses the line between right and wrong.You name the conditions of loving someone else and being loved in return.Anyone who agrees with you is showing that he/she loves you.Someone who obeys you feels safe. Someone you must obey feels unsafe.Ironically, these conditions for making your ego happy turn out to make who youreally are very unhappy. There is no joy in being in charge, no love incontrolling others, no expansion in defending the line between right and wrong.So seductive is the ego’s story, however, that countless people pursue happinessin the ways described. And they may even achieve perfect self-discipline andpower over others, but in so doing they will sacrifice their true selves.To find your true self, you must surrender to it, and the best way to do that isto surrender to another person. This doesn’t mean that one ego gives in toanother ego. That would indeed spell defeat. Instead, you share with the otherperson the truth about yourself.You want love without limitations.You want to feel safe.You want to express yourself creatively.You want to expand in joy.You want to be free.You highest wish is for unity in a state of perfect peace.When you can share these deep desires with another, what happens? The same thingthat has always been happening. The world will reflect your level ofconsciousness. In this case, the reflection comes from one other person—the onewho shares your truth. When you say to your beloved, “You are my world,” you arebeing quite literal.But this is only the first stage of surrender. It isn’t possible for two peopleto want the same thing every minute of the day. Both want different things; bothhave different points of view. To carry surrender beyond being merely an ideal,it must be made practical. Many people want to have a spiritual relationship,only to founder on the many obstacles that arise in everyday life—issues overmoney, career, family, and ambitions, for instance. There is no need to suppressthese issues, or to settle for compromises that don’t fully satisfy eitherparty. If you cannot fulfill yourself, you can’t possibly fulfill another.The secret isn’t to surrender to another person, or even to each other. Yousurrender to the path. It is a path you share. Your commitment is not to whatyou want or to what your partner wants. Individual desire is secondary. Youcommit to wherever the path is taking you. In this way you give up yourego-centered perspective. Your focus shifts to the space between you and the oneyou love. This is the gap between ego and spirit. Whenever you are tempted toobey your ego, you go to this shared space and ask the following:Which choice is more loving?What will bring peace between us?How awake am I?What kind of energy am I creating?Am I acting out of trust or distrust?Do I feel what my partner is feeling?Can I give without expecting anything in return?These questions don’t have automatic answers. They serve instead to wake you upspiritually. They attune you to a process that is more than “me” and “you.” Thespace you share with someone else allows you to look beyond ego. The advantageof doing this isn’t obvious at first. Your old conditioning will say, “What’swrong with getting what I want? Why should I consider someone else before me? Ihave a right to expect good things for myself.”What your ego cannot see is something precious that is hidden in every spiritualrelationship: mystery. This mystery is born of love; it calls to you from aplace of peace and joy that the ego can never reach with all its struggles,demands, and needs. Simply by entering the space between you and someone youlove, you open yourself to the mystery. When two people fall in love, theexistence of the mystery is obvious; it all but blinds them. They feel mergedand perfected in their state of rapture. Nothing can ever go wrong. The wholeworld exists in the other person. But when romance fades, this certainty fadeswith it. So it takes commitment to keep alive those first glimpses of afulfillment that lies beyond yourself, yet is nothing but yourself.When you commit to the path, you also surrender to it. Every day you ask, “Whatcan love do? Show me. I am ready.” The answers will surprise you. Love can solveproblems, heal wounds, settle disputes, and bring unexpected answers. Here wearen’t talking about personal love, the feeling contained inside a singleperson. This is a love beyond the personal that watches and knows everything.When you give yourself to it, everyday differences mean very little: money,ambition, career, family concerns all fall into place. An invisible powerreconciles opposites; it creates harmony of its own accord.To experience such a state, you cannot work for it or try to control it. Youallow yourself to be in a state of openness. You witness what is going on; youhang loose; you obey when the right impulse takes hold. This is how life islived spontaneously. Whatever happens next is the right thing. Whatever you needat the deepest level is automatically given. It is possible to exist in such astate, although few people do. In fact, it is the most natural way to live. Butif you judge your life, if you hold on to being right, if you insist on settingboundaries, then the mystery cannot reach you. Living in harmony with themystery takes time. Surrender, like everything else, is a process, not a leap.Despite ups and downs, the path always goes forward, and every step is a step oflove. Ultimately that is the reason for relationships, to be able to look intosomeone else’s eyes and share the knowledge that the power of love has blessedyou both.

When this happens, I will observethe impulse and let it go. In witnessing this behavior, I begin mytransformation. Every reminder will reinforce my goal in life, which is to behappy, not to be right.2. I will refrain from qualifying things as right and wrong, good and bad. Iwill find freedom in a wider perspective that leads to creative solutions ratherthan judgments and accusations. My happiness lies in the calm stillness thatlies beyond all labels.3. When I am tempted to see myself as a victim, I will remember that I am thecreator of the circumstances I see. I will ask myself, “What am I doing in astate of consciousness where I am creating this?” Just by asking this question,I will shift from being a victim to being a creator."},{"pageContent":"[images/Chop_9780307589729_epub_005_r1.jpg]FOCUS ONTHE PRESENTIf you focus on the present, your life will be constantly renewed. The presentmoment is the only time that is eternal. It never dies, nor can it be forgotten.Therefore, happiness in the present can never be taken away from you. It willfree you from the snare of time, which brings about suffering through thought,evaluation, and analysis. Being fully in the present, you experience thetimeless. In the timeless you find your true self. There will never be any more perfection than there is now.—from “Song of Myself,” Walt Whitman Although we have all heard that we should live in the present and not in thepast, there is a deeper spiritual lesson to be found in those words. Before athought arises in your mind, you are in a timeless state. After a thought hasserved its purpose, whether it brings up a desire or the memory of a past event,you return to that state of timelessness. There, you don’t need a reason to behappy. You just are.Happiness based on reasons is actually another form of misery. Whatever thereason for your happiness—a good relationship, a pleasurable situation, ormaterial possessions—it can be taken away from you at any moment. Therefore,your happiness is fragile and dependent on externals. Happiness without reasonsis real happiness. It is frequently referred to as bliss. This is a happinessthat can never be taken away.You don’t need to seek bliss, nor do you need to feel nostalgic once you’veexperienced it. Bliss is available in the now. So what is the now? We can callit present-moment awareness, which is a good phrase, because it reminds us thatbliss cannot be found by remembering the past or anticipating the future. Thepresent has no time span. The instant you try to measure the present moment, itdisappears. So the now is ever renewing. It is timeless because time cannot stopit. The now can never grow old or die.Time is a mysterious phenomenon, but we know that it is subjective, and we useit to measure experience. Consider the following sentences:I was having a good time and the hours flew by.I was bored and time dragged.I was on a tight deadline and time was running out.The beauty of the mountains was so breathtaking that time stood still.Each of these experiences of time is personal. The whole problem of time is thatwe always make it personal. Whether you regret something in your past or worryabout something in the future, you are creating changes in your body. In otherwords, you are spending much of your life metabolizing time. Every experience inyour life has been metabolized in your physical body and influences yourbiological clock. In fact, biological aging, with all its consequences ofinfirmity, suffering, and unhappiness, is nothing other than the metabolism oftime. Even the momentary recall of a past trauma makes you suffer all overagain. Good experiences are also the metabolism of time, but they don’t put wearand tear on the body.The wisdom traditions of the world put enormous attention on solving the problemof time because bliss, the kind of happiness that needs no reasons, can onlyhappen in the present moment. If your life is trapped in the passage of time,your body will also be trapped. But if you can escape the clutches of time, yourbody will be transformed by the experience of bliss.Here is the solution that the wisdom traditions arrived at.Time, they said, is the movement of consciousness, or put simply, the movementof thought. The real you, which lies beyond thought, can only be found in thenow. Your true self, existing in the eternal now, is neither an observer nor anobject of observation. As soon as a thought arises in your mind, however, anobserver appears, along with the object of observation. Thus we find that eachperson exists in two realities. First, the silent state of being that is notcaptured by time; this is the home of bliss. Second, the relative world full ofexperience; the mind lives in this world by constantly acting as the observerfocused on an object of observation.When you put your focus on the present, you are aligning yourself with the firstreality and its potential for happiness that can never be taken away. But if youfocus on the second reality, with its constant change of scenery, your mind willbe captivated by time. Time will then bring about all the negative effects wehave already mentioned.When you focus on the present moment, you don’t give up the relative world. Youwill still participate in everyday life, but with a difference. You will nolonger identify with change. The ups and downs of fortune will not shake youfrom your true self. Ordinarily, we are so caught up in the changing scene thatwe don’t notice that we’ve slipped out of the present moment.It’s important to recognize that all unhappiness exists in time. Another way tounderstand this is that time is born when your true self has been sacrificed foryour self-image. We’ve already touched on self-image and its false promises.Time, being the movement of thought, uses your self-image or ego as yourinternal reference point. If you look closely at what is happening in your mind,what do you see?You are constantly evaluating every experience.You are comparing yourself to something that seems better or worse.You are rejecting some things and choosing others.You are building up a story.None of these activities is actually necessary. They merely accumulate reasonsto be happy or unhappy. One way to do that is to compare your situation withsomeone else’s. But as you build your story and look around to see if it isbetter or worse than your neighbor’s, what’s happening? You’ve moved away fromthe natural state of happiness that exists in the now. Experience is. You don’thave to use it to build up a story. The ego loves melodrama, so it seizes uponevery experience to construct a never-ending tale about how your life is going.The tale can be good or bad, dramatic or boring, self-centered or relativelyselfless. But what if you had no story? Your life would be much simpler and morenatural. You would have no self-image to defend. You would have no fear oftomorrow because with nothing at stake about how your story is going, you couldaccept any experience and let it go. In that state, both freedom and blissreside.One of my favorite sayings is that being here is enough. When people hear this,particularly successful people whose lives are full of projects andaccomplishments, they look confused. To them, “being here” sounds passive andempty. Yet think about it. As they pursue lives that are so full of activity andgoals, most people are not fulfilling their being. Quite the opposite. They arerunning away from a deep-seated fear that life is empty unless you constantlyfill it up.One time I saw a great spiritual teacher being confronted by a person in deepdistress. This person faced the prospect of losing all his money and his job. Hefelt desperate, and he wanted to hear what a wise man would tell him. After herecited his tale of woe, the great teacher replied with a simple answer: “Soulsdon’t break. They bounce.”Fear has been lying to us, as is so often the case. If you could allow your mindto stop participating in the endless pursuit of goals, time would stop. Youwould experience your being. At that moment, you would realize that “being here”is your rock, your foundation. The quality of being leads to the quality ofconsciousness. The quality of your consciousness determines the quality of yourlife. We all owe our existence to the fact that existence isn’t empty.The ego drives you to identify with the changing world. It keeps your focus oneverything but your being. Think of all the things you have a stake in—home,family, career, money, possessions, status, religion, politics, and worldaffairs. They are all ego creations. They are housed in the complex edifice oftime. When you break through the barrier of the ego, you also break through thebarrier of time.The eternal now is the junction point between the unmanifest, invisible world ofspirit and the manifest, visible world that you accept as real. Few people knowthat they live in both of these realities. Still less do they know that theunmanifest, invisible world is their primary reality. Compared to it, thevisible world is a playhouse of shadows. So when you focus on the presentmoment, you are actually looking through a window to the unbounded timelessreality from which the entire universe arises and to which it subsides.The outer world arises in every moment of now. Its next birth is never the sameas the one that came before. Constant change is the rule; constanttransformation upholds every process, including the process of life. So yourtrue self can be defined as a still point surrounded by transformation. If youallow yourself to be absorbed in this still point, you will be changeless in themidst of change.You need to learn to separate the moment from the situation. They aren’t thesame. The situation surrounds the present moment. It can be unpleasant andpainful or the opposite. But the situation, whatever it is, arises and subsides.It will pass. The eternal now, which is always present, will remain. People talkabout having so much pain that it is inescapable. But all such pain is born ofthought, and is therefore changeable. I have seen patients with severe chronicpain, and when a few of them were able to separate their situation from thepresent moment, all but miraculously their pain disappeared. They hadtranscended a pain born in time. This taught me that even the most extremesituations can be transcended.In order to transcend your situation, you must cultivate a new style ofawareness, where you have your attention on what is, and you see the fullness inevery moment. Most people are not actually focusing on what is. They areovershadowing the experience of what is with what could be or what was. The pastand future dominate their attention. When you embrace what is with your wholeattention, you will be immersed in the fullness of the now.So how do we cultivate this new form of attention? Primarily throughmindfulness. Mindfulness means “paying attention,” but in a special way thatyour mind isn’t used to. At any given moment your mind is paying attention tothings that have nothing to do with the present moment. The list ofpossibilities is long.Your mind may be feeling distracted and stressed.It may be daydreaming, engaging in fantasy.It may be worrying.It may be reliving old memories.It may be making future plans.It may be planning ways to take control of the situation.It may be defending its cherished beliefs.It is almost certainly telling you a very familiar story.What’s useful about this list is that it tells you in simple terms whatmindfulness is not. Instead of struggling to be mindful, it’s easier to stopdoing the opposite. When you notice that your mind is engaging in any activitythat pulls you out of the present moment, simply stop. Don’t evaluate oranalyze. Don’t accuse yourself of something wrong. By simply observing what’sgoing on and letting it come to a stop, you have entered the domain ofmindfulness.Many people have never experienced their minds at rest. Reading through the listabove, they would say, “But that’s what my mind is for. That’s who I am.” No,you do not exist to support the activity of the mind. The mind exists to supportyou. One of the best ways it can do so is by allowing you to experience reality,not the fluctuating reality of the material world but the changeless realityuntouched by time.Other people are able to experience a few moments of restfulness in their minds,perhaps by focusing or meditating on their breath, or on a mantra, but almostimmediately the old restless mind activity returns. What then? Move into themode of simple attention. There are many areas of life to be mindful of besidesthe buzzing activity of the mind. You can be mindful of your emotions, yourbreath, or the sensations in your body. You can be aware of the sounds in yoursurroundings. The way you move your body—sitting, walking, eating, or any otheractivity—can be the object of your mindfulness.It’s important not to try or use effort. Anything you draw your attention towill bring you into the present moment, giving you the experience of presence.When you are in the proximity of a holy person, for example, you experiencedivinity that is actually rooted in something much simpler: it comes from beingpresent. Being present is enough to bestow calm and a subtle feeling of safety,love, and joy. We often miss this experience in our own lives, because as soonas we have a thought or sensation, we start to evaluate and analyze it. When wedo so the present disappears, and takes presence with it.Being present and experiencing presence are the same, and neither one requireseffort. You cannot work to be present. You just are. If you practicemindfulness, this quality of joyful presence will begin to be with you all thetime. If you find yourself getting distracted, just noticing that you aredistracted will bring you back to the present. The kind of mindfulness I amtalking about has nothing to do with emptiness, or checking out. It doesn’trequire concentration or intensity. It is the most relaxed and natural statebecause nothing is more relaxed than your self. You can slip into it simply bynoticing each distracting activity and letting it go. “Easy come, easy go”actually has a deep spiritual meaning. What comes and goes isn’t the real you.The real you is the bliss that exists beyond time. [images/Chop_9780307589729_epub_L02_r1.jpg]TO ACTIVATE THE Fifth keyIN EVERYDAY LIFE, I PROMISE MYSELFTO DO THE FOLLOWING:1. I will embrace what is, and not impose upon it what was or what could be.What is brings me into the present moment. It sheds worry and anticipation. Byfocusing only on what is before me, I am in a new mind-set that is far morerelaxed and accepting. I am allowing my own being to be present. In this way Iexperience the fullness of divine presence.2. I will catch myself whenever I am distracted. I am not the restless activityof the mind. I am not the story my mind is constantly telling me. I am not mymemories, or my dreams of the future. I am the point of stillness, now andevermore. As soon as I stop being distracted, I am being mindful. Now I can payattention to the present moment and the fullness it contains.3. I will separate the present moment from the present situation. Everysituation rises and subsides. Things change, but I remain. If a stressfulsituation continues, I will find a quiet place to gather myself. If that isn’tpossible, I promise to walk away at the first opportunity. This is the practicalvalue of mindfulness. It reminds me that my primary aim in life is to be presentwith my true self. Only then can I appreciate what is."},{"pageContent":"[images/Chop_9780307589729_epub_006_r1.jpg]SEE THE WORLDIN YOURSELFWhen you see the world in yourself, there are no more outward obstacles tohappiness. The inner and outer worlds are mirrors of each other. They changeaccording to your level of consciousness. If you are vibrating at the level offear, your inner world of thoughts and emotions and your outer world of eventsand relationships will reflect that. Similarly, if your consciousness vibratesat the level of love, then love will be present in both your inner and outerworlds. A flow of happiness and abundance will manifest when you have reachedthe deepest level of yourself. In oneself lies the whole world, and if you know how to look and learn, the dooris there and the key is in your hand.—J. KrishnamurtiI am the light that makes experience possible. I am the reality which is hiddenin all beings.—Yoga Vasishtha Know that the outer world reflects your inner reality. It has no other option.As we saw, you live in two domains at the same time, and the unmanifest,invisible domain is primary. Whatever occurs at the deepest level of theunmanifest must come into being as an outer event, situation, challenge, crisis,or opportunity. The unmanifest is where the script of your life is written.If that is so, naturally you would want to write a script that includeshappiness, joy, and love. So why is it so rare for life to bring us thosethings? Without understanding deeper levels of consciousness, you will not beable to take advantage of them. Several conditions must be accepted by you astrue:Consciousness exists everywhere.It is infinitely flexible.Reality changes in different states of consciousness.We are used to thinking that the opposite of these statements is true. We limitconsciousness to the brain, we assume that a person’s level of awareness isfixed, and we believe that reality is essentially the same for everyone. Theirony is that the universe, being a conscious entity, reflects those verybeliefs. To truly unite your inner and outer worlds, a shift is needed in yourbelief system.Your true identity is neither the inner nor the outer world. You are the creatorof both. The same source that creates thoughts, feelings, memories, emotions,and all subjective experience simultaneously creates the objective world thatmatches your subjective state. If you don’t like what is happening around you,don’t try to “fix it.” That would be like polishing the mirror hoping to changethe reflection you see in it. In order to change what you see, there has to be anew message coming from the source.Our current belief system, which insists that something must be tangible andconcrete to be real, traps consciousness inside the brain. This is far toolimiting. There is a ground state beyond space and time that conceives, governs,and creates all the events that occur in space-time. Imagine that before youhave a thought or before an event takes place in the world, it begins as a seedin the ground state. The seed vibrates to life, moving from the subtlest levelof nature to the grossest level, where the five senses can detect it. Quantumphysics completely agrees with this idea. It even accepts that thoughts “inhere” must come from the ground state, just like electrons and photons “outthere.” The difference is that the world’s wisdom traditions link the two. Theygive primary value to awareness while physics gives primary value to inertmatter, although this is beginning to change.Suppose you don’t like a situation in your life. You perceive that there is anoutside circumstance or relationship that is at fault. Merely turning topositive thinking isn’t going to make a difference. You can think as positivelyas you like about your troubles, but this is a superficial mood; it doesn’t goto the source. In fact, to artificially manipulate your thoughts, even in apositive direction, can increase stress and worsen the situation. The solutionis to change both inner and outer reality simultaneously. Consciousnesspermeates everything. It functions to create change at four fundamental levels:being, feeling, thinking, and doing.The highest level of consciousness is pure being. We see this in the innocenceof a child; there is spontaneity, wonder, joy, and playfulness. When you areestablished at this level of consciousness, your thoughts and actions willreflect these qualities. Pure being has no qualities we can label, but thatdoesn’t mean it is empty. In the stillness and silence of being, you contact theground state that physicists talk about. The poet William Blake called this thestate of organized innocence, which means that innocence has gained the power toorganize all of life. If you live from the level of pure being, in practice youhave mastered creation. The laws of Nature come to your aid whenever you call onthem using the power of intention.Since consciousness transcends personal identity, living from the level of purebeing arouses the deepest values of life. Eastern wisdom traditions list four ofthese values that are most harmonious to human existence. These constitute thehighest level of feeling: 1. Loving kindness 2. Compassion 3. Joy at the success of others 4. Equanimity, peaceWe might call these qualities of the heart, which exist on the feeling levelwhen a person achieves the highest level of thought. Thought gains its integrityfrom feelings. In your mind you can think all kinds of charitable, kind,peaceful thoughts, but your whole being isn’t really behind them. They exist asempty ideas so the outer world can still bring you severely unlovingreflections. But if your thoughts are based on genuine feelings that spring fromyour deepest being, then the outcome of this process—the actions you take in theworld—will bring fulfillment.When people complain that life is unfair, what they are really saying is thatthere is a mismatch between inner events (hopes, wishes, expectations,ambitions, goals) and the response of the outer world. In our society weconstantly reinforce the idea that we should follow our dreams, but what aboutthe millions of people whose dreams have faded? In some way the chain that leadsfrom being to feeling to thinking and then to doing has been broken.Restoring the sequence isn’t difficult, but you must move things in the rightdirection. Pure being leads to the highest level of feeling, and the highestlevel of feeling creates the highest level of thinking and doing. Now we see thesolution to being a loving person in an unloving world. You don’t struggle to beloving; you don’t oppose those who are unloving. Instead, you establish yourselfin pure being, which is loving by nature, and then inner and outer realitycannot help but reflect who you are.This picture of reality streaming from one source creates a radicaltransformation at every level. Take thinking. As we saw, most of the time themind is occupied with distractions, unable to focus on the present moment.Habits of worrying, fretting, planning, and dwelling in fantasy are byproductsof disconnection from pure being. The highest level of thinking is a constantflow of creativity from the source that is accompanied by feelings of joy andcompassion. The final result is doing. No one has to be told what it’s like toact out of conflict, stress, anxiety, indecision, and doubt. We know that all ofthese are mental obstacles to right action. The highest level of doing iscompletely clear. Since it comes from a level beyond personality, such actionreaches beyond personal benefit. It benefits everything around you, beginningwith your family and extending to the entire world. If you want to helphumanity, the surest way is to act while you’re established in pure being.It’s important to realize that the mechanics of consciousness aren’t theoreticalor abstract. In daily life you can readily observe that when you move away fromyour core experience of happiness, both the outer world and the inner world arein a disturbed state. This is a signal that you have disconnected yourself fromyour true self. Before you react by trying to manipulate either your thoughts orthe situation, step back and reconnect to being. You know how to be mindful. Itinvolves taking your attention away from the situation and going back to theself. Is this a cure-all for every bad circumstance in life? No, but the reasonswhy mindfulness might fall short tell us a great deal:If mindfulness is superficial, it has less influence; your mind must be able toreach a deeper level.Inner resistance, past traumas, and rigid beliefs block the flow ofconsciousness. When consciousness is blocked, it loses its power.Almost all the work done on the spiritual path consists of two things: clearingaway obstacles, and reaching a deeper level of awareness. In these ways you opena connection to your true self and you remove the ego’s resistance. Yet even atthe beginning of the path, being mindful of your role as the witness is veryeffective. When you achieve this state, you are grounded, alert, flexible, andready to act from the highest level. Shifting to the witness is a subtle action.It requires that you “just stop.”If that feels too difficult—as it does to many people, because they have nevertaken time to simply be with themselves—then just move to observing your breath.If you observe your breath without manipulating it, it will start to slow down.The breath leads the body. It is the subtlest physical response, mirroring themovement of consciousness. You cannot hide your true feelings and reactions fromyour breathing. As you continue to observe your breath, you will feel calm andcentered. Your thoughts will settle down, and the external stress will not seemso threatening. You are actually changing your vibration at the level of being.With a little experience of what it is like to be still, you will be able toaccess the highest level of feeling. This can be done by recalling an experienceof love. Let yourself be immersed in what it was like to be in love or feeldeeply loved. Once you have a clear connection to this feeling, ask for guidancefrom your deepest awareness. It will respond either with a creative insight or ameaningful understanding. Quite often this connection arises in the form of acoincidence or unexpected turn of events. Why is that? Because we are so used tofollowing the biased guidance of the ego, whose agenda includes payback,ambition, insecurity, and self-importance, that the true self must communicatethrough surprising or unexpected events. But no matter what route they take,messages from your deepest awareness are being sent all the time.Now you can take action from the highest level, knowing that the consequences ofyour action benefit everyone in the situation. The benefit may be obvious orsubtle, immediate or delayed. It isn’t up to you to manipulate things soeveryone comes away happy. Your obligation is only to execute the sequentialunfolding of consciousness at its highest levels: being, feeling, thinking, anddoing. The New Testament uses an enigmatic phrase for this: being in the worldbut not of it. Now we have clarified what these words mean. You rendereverything around you—people, circumstances, situations and theirstresses—almost irrelevant. You still participate in that world, but you arerooted in the deeper reality from which it springs. Living from your sourceunites the inner and outer world. It transcends both and gives your thoughts theforce of Nature itself. [images/Chop_9780307589729_epub_L02_r1.jpg]TO ACTIVATE THE Sixth KeyIN EVERYDAY LIFE, I PROMISE MYSELFTO DO THE FOLLOWING:1. I will learn to step into the domain of being. Today I will be mindful; Iwill meditate; I will repair the connection to my true self. Only byexperiencing pure being can I find a solid foundation for everything I feel,think, and do.2. No matter how uncomfortable or unpleasant an experience may be today, I willmeet it with highest consciousness. I will connect with my being, find thehighest feeling of love within myself, and let my deepest consciousness deliverthe action I should take.3. When I find myself reacting with anger or opposition to any person orcircumstance, I will realize that I am only struggling with myself. Putting upresistance is a response created by old hurts. When I relinquish this anger, Iwill be healing myself and cooperating with the flow of the universe."},{"pageContent":"[images/Chop_9780307589729_epub_007_r1.jpg]LIVE FORENLIGHTENMENTTo seek enlightenment is to seek your true self. Enlightenment is the most awarestate of existence and also the most natural, because it is where you came from.Your home is a place of profound love, peace, and joy. When you return there,you will experience yourself as one with God. At that moment you will realizethat your desire for happiness was only the beginning. Your deepest desire wasfor the freedom that comes with complete awakening. I look into your eyes and see the whole universe—born and not yet born.—RumiA human being is a creature who has received the order to become God.—St. Basil Being fulfilled means going beyond everyday experience. At a deeper level humanbeings have always longed for ecstasy, a feeling of euphoria, joy, peace, andlove. Addiction to drugs and alcohol is evidence of our society’s starvation andlonging for real ecstasy. Everyday happiness gives us only a taste, leavingbehind a hunger for more. Happiness, then, is the beginning of a journey thatreaches for higher fulfillment.Many people have accidentally experienced the most intense happiness, oftencalled a peak experience. These experiences may have occurred in intimatemoments in Nature, in dance and music, in play, or in lovemaking. What sets apeak experience apart is not its intensity but its meaning—it feels as if a muchgreater, freer, more expansive reality has been revealed. Everyone who has had apeak experience tries to recapture it. Most are disappointed, because a momentof higher awareness isn’t the same as attaining higher awareness. What is neededis a path to transformation guided by a vision of the possibilities that thefirst taste inspires.In the world’s wisdom traditions, the search for ecstasy is completely natural.Ecstasy is your original energy state. To return to it is to return home andmake it your permanent abode. There are many names for this goal: redemption,salvation, transcendence, and enlightenment. There are as many paths as thereare faiths and spiritual teachers. But in the end a single truth is beingespoused: The human soul longs to return to the place where ecstasy abides.There, union can be found with the mystery of God.Is it possible to expand your consciousness until it merges with God’sconsciousness? The answer offered by wisdom traditions is yes, but for theindividual, the only proof lies in experiencing that union. A life decision isrequired. Flashes of intense happiness, even a moment of ecstasy, can happenspontaneously—the clouds clear and suddenly you see the sun. But seekingenlightenment implies a shift that you make of your own free will. Instead ofpursuing happiness, you pursue bliss. The problem for most people is that such ashift seems extreme, alien, and perhaps threatening. This is understandable. Aswisdom traditions declined, a false belief sprang up about enlightenment. Itbecame identified with renunciation, sacrifice, poverty, and solitude.None of that is true. How could discovering your true self possibly be a form ofsacrifice? But your ego benefits from this misperception by making you feel thatthere is no other self but the one it has shown you. It is up to you to discoverthe truth. When you become mindful, you begin to witness what is happening inand around you. The witness sees what the ego tries to hide, that daily life isnot fulfilling when your deepest desire has been blocked.In the previous chapters we explored different ways to make the necessary shift.Now let’s look farther ahead on the journey. You can gain a glimpse ofenlightenment with a simple exercise. Close your eyes and imagine a beautifulsunset over the ocean. See the colors as vividly as possible; catch the shiningglint of the sun off the water. Now open your eyes. Did you see the sunset? Thatpicture was not in your brain. If we looked inside your brain, we would findelectrochemical reactions coursing through synaptic networks. There are noimages inside the brain that match what our eyes see. There isn’t the slightestglimmer of light inside the visual cortex. But when you close your eyes andimagine a sunset, you don’t experience electrochemical reactions. Where, then,is the picture of the sunset you saw? It exists not in your brain but inconsciousness. The same holds true if you try to imagine anything with your fivesenses—the smell of a rose, the sound of a newborn baby crying, the soft textureof velvet, or a full-blown kiss on the lips. There are no sights or sounds ortastes or smells in your brain, only a dark silence flickering with faintelectrical impulses and chemical exchanges. Every sensation exists inconsciousness alone.Now extend this awareness to your body. You experience your body as a series ofsensations—the weight of your limbs, the in and out of your breathing, thethumping rhythm of your heart when you run. But, once again, none of thesesensations can be found in your brain, even with advanced imaging like CAT scansand functional MRIs. Only electrochemical signals register on these scans.Therefore, your body also exists in your consciousness. There is nowhere else toexperience it.Look at the world around you. Everything about its color, sound, taste, andsmell seems totally real, but where is this world located? If you pick up a rocklying in the sun, your past conditioning leads you to say, “If this rock feelsheavy and warm, it’s real.” But if your body, which also feels heavy and warm,exists only in consciousness, so does a rock. Anything you can possiblyexperience, extending out to the farthest reaches of the cosmos, exists in yourconsciousness. To find your home, you must find where this consciousnessresides.Now ask the ultimate question: Where do you exist? If the world cannot be foundinside your brain, the same is even more true for you, because no MRI has everfound a part of the brain that lights up when you experience yourself. Yet youknow you have a self. To find it, you must think outside the brain, in factoutside time and space. You are pure consciousness, which has no location intime and space. Think of how television works. When you watch TV, you can locatethe screen in your living room. That picture only exists because of signals fromthe transmitter. Those signals are everywhere. Amazing as it may seem, eventhough you can locate your body in time and space, your consciousness iseverywhere, which means that you are, too. The only reason your brain lights upis because consciousness causes it to.Beginning with a simple exercise, like imagining a sunset over the ocean, wearrive at an astounding truth: You are holding the world together simply byobserving it. The witness turns a formless swirl of photons into everything wesee, hear, touch, taste, and smell. You don’t have to do anything to accomplishthis. Subtle intention is enough. You want to see a sunset, and you do. There’sno need to instruct the brain how to build the image out of electrochemicalimpulses. Likewise, if you want to walk down the street, you don’t have toinstruct your muscles how to fire and your cardiovascular system how to bringblood to the muscles. Simply by having a wordless intention, all the rightconnections are made.You hold the world together at a very subtle level, the source of creation knownas God. Together, you and God produce reality, and neither of you has tostruggle to do it. To be enlightened is to be attuned to this simple fact. Asthe upholder of creation, your role is to be, nothing else. In that realizationlife becomes effortless. All stress, strain, worry, anxiety, and uncertaintydrop away. The secret of unbounded bliss has been revealed.Now you know your goal and the path that will take you there. How can you tellwhen you are making progress on the path? By referring every day to thefollowing indicators: 1. Your life flows with effortless spontaneity. 2. Love is becoming the motivating factor in your life. 3. You are discovering hidden sources of creativity and imagination. 4. You are accepting higher guidance into your life. 5. Your choices benefit you and all those around you.Yet we could reduce all these indications to one: You are expanding theexperience of happiness wherever you go.As a boy in India I was given very simple lessons about spirituality. One ofthem was that enlightenment is like running back into the arms of your mother.Every child can relate to that sensation. It still holds true when you are anadult, contemplating what the spiritual path means. The journey is a progressiveexpansion from ordinary waking consciousness, with all its fear and isolation,to soul consciousness, which is safe, warm, and welcoming.Having run into the arms of your soul, you are home. You no longer identify withego boundaries. You find that you are not in the world; the world is in you.Everything to be said about consciousness comes down to this. Because thejourney never ends, there is more to gain. Simply by being aware of your trueself, you will progress naturally and easily to cosmic consciousness, which isthe same as being fully awake twenty-four hours a day even when your body andbrain are sleeping. Next you will expand to divine consciousness, or Godconsciousness, in which everything is made of light. Divine presence emanatesfrom every object, every experience, and every thought. (This stage is sometimesknown as wearing golden spectacles, because a radiant light fills yourawareness.)Finally, you will arrive at unity consciousness, where all divisions andseparations end. Every moment is part of eternity. Every experience is sharedwith the cosmos. Unity consciousness was described by William Blake when hewrote, “To see a world in a grain of sand, And a heaven in a wild flower, Holdinfinity in the palm of your hand, And eternity in an hour.”With all of this stretching before you, consider where you are today. If you areserious about following your path, the possibility for happiness is infinitelyexpanded. You will be heading for nothing less than enlightenment. You shouldn’tthink of enlightenment as it is often portrayed, as a mystical state. In realityconsciousness expands naturally. The state of bliss is your birthright. When youattain higher consciousness in any form, through devotion, compassion, service,or knowledge of the self, you will be on the same journey that we have beentaking since the first page of this book—and the first day of our lives. Ifconsciousness is your true home, so is enlightenment your true destination. [images/Chop_9780307589729_epub_L02_r1.jpg]TO ACTIVATE THE Seventh KeyIN EVERYDAY LIFE, I PROMISE MYSELFTO DO THE FOLLOWING:1. I will remember that ecstasy is my primordial energy state. It is my source.I can return to it anytime I want. What is needed is a shift in attention awayfrom my ego’s desires to the deeper desire in me, which is to find my true self.2. I will see my thoughts, my body, and my surroundings as a single process.This process occurs in consciousness. There are no divisions in reality. Feelingseparate, helpless, or alone is an indication that I have lost contact with theprocess. When I am part of the flow of life, all things are different aspects ofone thing: the unfolding of myself.3. I will keep alive my vision of life, a journey from waking consciousness tosoul consciousness, where full awareness can never be lost. From that point,real life begins, for my path will take me to cosmic consciousness, divineconsciousness, and finally to unity consciousness. Whenever I am distracted bythe outside world and its constant demands, I will remember my vision and keepto my path. Enlightenment is my destination. When I arrive, I will be home atlast."},{"pageContent":"HAPPINESS WILL HEAL THE WORLDAn old way of being happy has brought the world to the brink of peril. A new wayof being happy can save it. These are drastic statements, but if they are true,a profound change can occur, and its effect will only be positive. All theproblems we see around us are the result of individuals making choices. Nomatter how huge a challenge may be, from global warming to nuclear arms, fromAIDS to overpopulation, the seed of the problem was a decision to act in acertain way. When the decision was being made, the person making it tried tocreate more happiness or to avoid unhappiness. The question is how to makechoices that lead to happiness without leading to unforeseen disaster.That cannot be done when happiness is defined the old way, even though the oldway felt safe. Owning a car and driving it to work makes most people happierthan walking. Having a child makes married couples happy. Raking leaves in thefall and burning them in a pile was the mark of a responsible citizen in yearspast. Yet in the long run these simple actions resulted in global problems.Happiness can be blamed even for self-destructive behavior. During the Cold Warthe buildup of nuclear arms began as a way to keep us safe, for example, yetvery soon the United States and the Soviet Union had achieved mutually assureddestruction—that is, pushing a button to launch the first missile would set offa chain of events that would annihilate both nations.Even before global warming and the arms race, people made choices every day inpursuit of happiness that didn’t actually lead to happiness. The old way ofbeing happy carried certain beliefs and conditions that ensured unhappy results:Each person is alone and must struggle to fulfill his desires.The basic state of Nature is one of lack. There are not enough of the goodthings in life to go around.The environment is hostile and therefore to survive means a life of struggle.It is desirable to accumulate material goods without end. Rich equals fulfilled.If you don’t look after yourself, no one will.Making yourself happy today is more important than thinking about tomorrow.Countless people pursue happiness without questioning these beliefs, but therewill be no happiness for the world until we break their spell. Let me relate amoment in my own life that helped me to break it. I had taken my six-year-oldgranddaughter to the beach and watched her as she waded in the shallow water.She came to me to be dried off, and as I leaned over her, I smelled the saltysmell of the sea in her hair. When I took her home, she said good-bye and Ikissed her on the cheek, which still tasted salty from her splashing in the sea.Suddenly I realized, “Here is the oneness of life.” The salt in the sea is thesame salt that runs through every living thing. Simply smelling the sea brings acloud of salt molecules into your body, and when you kiss someone on the cheek,the sense of taste brings more molecules from their body to yours. Nothing goesunshared. When you smell cigarette smoke from someone, you are inhalingparticles of polluted air that were in someone’s lungs. Every moment we inhaleviruses that incubated in someone else’s cells—these harmful microorganismsrepresent a worldwide circulation of DNA from one life form to another. In thepoem “Song of Myself,” Walt Whitman said, “Every atom belonging to you as wellbelongs to me.”You are inescapably woven into the web of life. Think of a tree in tropicalAfrica, a squirrel in Siberia, a camel in Saudi Arabia, a Chinese peasantharvesting rice, or a taxi driver zooming through the smog-filled streets ofCalcutta. You have raw material inside your tissues that was circulating inthose bodies less than twenty days ago. Your body is not your own. It never was.The mathematics of radioactive decay reveals that each of us has at least amillion atoms in our bodies that were once in the body of Christ, Buddha,Genghis Khan, or any other historical figure. In just the last three weeks aquadrillion atoms (10 followed by 15 zeros) have passed through your body thatwere previously circulating through every living species on this planet.This sharing extends to subtler levels of existence, too. Each thoughtcirculates around the planet thanks to the Internet, entering other nervoussystems and being absorbed by them. Communications devices run on electricity,so once again we are part of one energy field and one information field.Likewise, our emotions are not confined to us. Anxiety over the economicmeltdown enters every house in the world, producing shared responses amongbillions of people. When you feel your blood pressure rise, your heart race, andyour skin grow cold, the same anxious reactions are affecting everyone whoshares your extended emotions.I’ve articulated this insight many times in many ways, but at that moment,watching my granddaughter get out of the car and run back into the house, theimpact was undeniable. It was instantly clear that I couldn’t possibly hope tobe happy in isolation, much less hope to be enlightened. I can take refuge inthe illusion that “I” am separate, that “I” can compete against “you” to getwhat I want, with one of us winning while the other loses out. But this refugeis the most dangerous place anyone could live. The sense of separation causes usto make choices that come back to haunt us. All because salt molecules aredrifting from the sea to a human body, and then another and another, withoutend.I try to remind myself often of a quote from the English physicist andastronomer Sir James Jeans: “In the deeper reality … we may all be members ofone body.” This is the first principle of the new happiness outlined in thisbook. It breaks the spell of separation; it makes possible the healing of theworld at a time of great insecurity and crisis.The second principle is that we all exist inside one another, because the air,food, and water that we take in and expel are in constant circulation.The third principle is that this constant circulation is one process. Nature isbehaving as a whole, leaving not a single atom outside the tapestry.If these principles are true, a shift in awareness is the only way thathappiness today can be attained without unhappiness coming along in the future.Currently, the happiness that people experience depends on someone else beingunhappy (through poverty, exploitation, war, crime, and class division), or elseon blinding ourselves to how insecure today’s happiness actually is whentomorrow brings a change.[images/Chop_9780307589729_epub_L03_r1.jpg]We all have a global stake in creating happiness that is true and enduring. Formany, the phrase “happiness will heal the world” sounds too far-fetched andwishful. And it’s true that a nice feeling or a sense of personal contentmentdoesn’t heal the world, far from it. But at a basic level, happy people wouldn’tchoose to develop chemical weapons, start terrorist movements, commit acts oftorture, and start wars. If even a small group of people found their true selvesand thereby attained the happiness that can never be taken away, they would liveat a deep level of awareness. From that level, the influence radiated out intotheir surroundings would be profound.They would add an element to the world’s consciousness best described as“coherence.” (In an age of faith, we might call this saintliness, purity, or thepeace that passes understanding.) This is everyone’s ground state, becausecoherence is natural; no cell in your body could remain alive for three secondsif life wasn’t systematic, organized, balanced, and interconnected. At the levelof awareness, to be coherent in yourself means that you are:At peaceNonviolentAwake and awareFearlessWithout conflict and illusionsResilientIndependent, free of outside influencesThese shouldn’t be rare qualities. But they are when people grow unhappy, andtheir incoherence radiates out into the surroundings. Individual incoherenceadvances a state of chaos, confusion, and conflict. From that state, which allof us have known in our personal lives, the unhappy problems of the world followas naturally as night follows day. When asked how to prevent war, J.Krishnamurti uttered something profound. He said, “Change yourself. Your ownanger and violence are the cause of all wars.” The world has let incoherencespread like a pandemic. Now we must test whether coherence can have the oppositeeffect, bringing an end to chaos, conflict, and confusion on a global scale.It was always true that we were dependent on one another for our emotional andphysical well-being. A harsh word from someone else can cause physical havoc inyour body. A loving word can turn havoc into harmony. Emotions such as love,compassion, empathy, and joy bring the body back to a state of balance known ashomeostasis: self-repair mechanisms are triggered; a biological healing responseis the result. If you are in such a state of well-being and I am around you, Iwill be affected in the same way. My physiology will mirror yours.The underlying truth seems undeniable: My happiness can heal someone else justthe way it heals me. The most important contribution I can make to the healingof our planet is therefore to be happy. By spreading that happiness wherever Igo, I create a healing response. It’s crucial to realize that this doesn’trequire doing anything special—you don’t have to focus on acts of lovingkindness, although if they are spontaneous expressions of your happiness, that’swonderful. It is not by saying or doing that we create the most profound changearound us. As Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, “Who you are is shouting so loudlythat I can’t hear what you’re saying.” The more intense your state of happiness,the greater its healing effect.The healing influence of happiness travels literally at the speed of light. Likea single inspiring thought that goes on the Internet and reaches millions ofpeople in a matter of hours, one person’s happiness is unbounded. It multipliesexponentially like a benign infection, creating greater order in place ofdisorder, greater unity in place of separation. So rather than clinging to alimited identity, see yourself on a world scale. If you are on the path to unityconsciousness, it’s a small step to imagine happiness on a world scale, as partof humanity’s extended body, mind, and spirit. A matrix binds us together thatis beyond any energy field or information field. It’s a spiritual field. This isthe manifestation of what religions call the mind of God.Now the vision is complete. As the ancient philosopher Plotinus said, “Ourconcern is not merely to be sinless, but to be God.” The happiest existenceanyone can imagine is to live in the mind of God, a mind made fully human, whichwas God’s intention all along. Everything we fear in the world and want tochange can be transformed through happiness, the simplest desire we have, andalso the most profound."},{"pageContent":"ACKNOWLEDGMENTSMy deep appreciation goes to the dedicated people who made this book possible.At the Chopra Center, Carolyn, Felicia, and Lindsay support me through theirtireless work.
