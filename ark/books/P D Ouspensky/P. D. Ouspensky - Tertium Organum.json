The basic unit of our pe rception is a sensation. A sensation is an elementary change in the state of our inne r li fe, pr oduc ed, or so it appe ars t o us, either by some ch ange in the state of the oute r w orld in re latio n to our i nne r life , or by a change in our inner life in relation to the outer world.

It is sufficient to define a sensation as an elem entary change in the sta te of the inner life, i.e . as the e lement, o r the ba sic unit of this c hange. Expe riencing a sensa tion, we a ssu me it t o be, so to s peak, a reflection of some kind of change in the e xternal wo rld.
