I began to read 'ExperimentalMysticism', and realized suddenly that this was the single most importantchapter in all Ouspensky's work, and that what he was saying fitted closely withmy own conclusions on the 'relationality' of consciousness, as outlined in thefinal chapter of my Beyond the Occult, which I had just finished. Oddly enough,I had read 'Experimental Mysticism' before - the chapter was heavily marked inpencil - yet, until that day, had never grasped its full significance. Iduplicated it, took it with me to America, and used it as the basis of a numberof lectures from New York to Los Angeles. On my return home I hastened to addsections on Ouspensky and 'Experimental Mysticism' to Beyond the Occult.All this led me back to Tertium Organum, and to the recognition that even if hehad never met Gurdjieff, Ouspensky would have been one of the most interestingthinkers of the twentieth century. This had, in fact, been the thesis of a bookcalled Ouspensky: The Unsung Genius by J.H. Reyner. I had felt, at the time,that Reyner was pitching Ouspensky's claims too high; now I found myself feelingthat, if anything, he had pitched them too low. Hence my own attempt in thisbook to stake Ouspensky's claim as an individual thinker and man of genius."},{"pageContent":"ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSI WISH to thank Messrs Routledge and Kegan Paul for their permission to quotefrom the works of Ouspensky.

It was not entirelySlavic melancholy. He told J.G. Bennett in a letter that nothing could be foundby intellectual processes, and that 'there is only one hope: that we should findthe way to work with the higher emotional centre'. To this he added the sadcomment: 'And we do not know how this is to be done.'The disappointment may also have been due to a sense of creative unfulfilment.At the age of 20, he had made his reputation with a book called The FourthDimension. By the time he reached his mid-thirties - in 1913 - Ouspensky was oneof the most promising young intellectuals in Russia, a fine novelist and writerof short stories, and the author of a brilliant and profound volume ofphilosophy called Tertium Organum. In fact when it was published in Americaafter the First World War, it made him famous. His third book, A New Model OfThe Universe, was even finer, and guarantees him a place as one of the mostimportant thinkers of the twentieth century. Ouspensky should have gone on tohave become as well-known in the West as contemporaries like Berdyaev,Merejkovsky and Bunin. Instead, he descended into a self-chosen obscurity,preferring to regard himself as a teacher of 'the Work', the 'System' of hisgreat contemporary George Ivanovich Gurdjieff. The latter achieved aconsiderable degree of celebrity in America during the 1930s. And Ouspensky, asfar as he was known at all, was regarded simply as Gurdjieff's chief disciple -although, in fact, they had gone their separate ways soon after the First WorldWar, and Ouspensky even forbade his pupils to mention Gurdjieff's name.Ouspensky must have known that he was one of the most remarkable minds of thecentury - that he was no more a 'disciple' of Gurdjieff than, say, Coleridge wasa disciple of Wordsworth, or Pushkin of Byron. No doubt he would have dismissedthe whole question as an absurdity - fame, after all, is little more than adelusion - yet there is something in all of us that wishes to leave behind aname for posterity. And Ouspensky virtually renounced his own name and fame tobecome an anonymous teacher. Even those who revered him regarded him as amouthpiece of Gurdjieff's ideas.When he returned to England from New York in 1947, his former pupil KennethWalker was shocked by the change in him: '. . . he appeared to me to be a manwho had lost all of his former enthusiasm and drive.' What was even moreshocking was that Ouspensky had apparently lost faith in the System to which hehad devoted his whole life. 'There is no System,' he replied in answer to aquestion. And so the sick man dragged himself on without faith for another ninemonths. His disciple Rodney Collin wrote: 'In Ouspensky's last months one sawhow he accepted being old, sick, ugly, helpless, in pain, misunderstood . . .'And when, after a final talk to a small group of disciples, he died at dawn on 2October, 1947, at the age of 69, Rodney Collin locked himself in Ouspensky'sroom for a week without food.What had gone wrong? In fact, had anything gone wrong, or had Ouspensky broughthis life's work to a kind of genuine fulfilment? To answer that question, wemust go back to the beginning . . .Pyotr Demianovich Ouspensky was born in Moscow on 5 March, 1878, the son of anofficer in the Survey Service and a talented artist. Since in Russia one waseither a peasant or a gentleman, Ouspensky was emphatically a gentleman. As hismaternal grandparents were also members of the 'intelligentsia,' he grew upamong writers, artists and thinkers.In a more stable society, he would undoubtedly have gone on to become one of themost important philosophers of his time andended as a 'grand old man' whose namewould have ranked with contemporaries like Bertrand Russell, Bernard Shaw andThomas Mann.Unfortunately, Holy Russia was one of the most unstable societies in the world.At the time of Ouspensky's birth, liberals were clamouring for a constitution.Organizations with titles like 'Land and Liberty' and 'The Will of the People'talked openly about revolution, and were persecuted by the police. Just afterOuspensky's third birthday, Tsar Alexander II was blown up by a bomb made ofnitro-glycerine enclosed in glass. His successor, Alexander III, made a bizarreand heroic attempt to prevent Russia from advancing into the twentieth centuryby inaugurating a regime of repression, but died of exhaustion after a mere 13years' rule. His successor, Nicholas II, 'the last of the Tsars', did his bestto give the liberals the constitution they wanted, but it was too late: Russiawas already living in the shadow of the immense tragedy that would engulf Europeand wipe out the Tsar's own family. In 1918, the year the Tsar and Tsarina weremurdered at Ekaterinburg, Ouspensky set out on the journey that would take himinto exile. The years of security were over and, at the age of 39, he had tostart all over again.Under the circumstances, it is not surprising that the young Ouspensky came toshare the 'spirit of the age,' and became imbued with a feverish romanticism;before he was seven, he was reading Turgenev's Sportsman's Sketches andLermontov's Hero of Our Time, the latter a Byronic work by a poet who was killedin a duel at the age of 26. Both had been regarded as revolutionary works at thetime of their publication and had earned their authors a period in prison.Ouspensky's later description of memories of childhood - some dating from theage of two - indicate that, like the young Proust, he experienced life with analmost hallucinatory intensity. He spoke of the river near a town calledZvenigorod, with its smell of tar, its old monastery, and its hills covered withforests, and recalled the illuminations at the coronation of Tsar Alexander III,when he was three. Yet he also experienced a curious sense of the fundamentalunreality of this world around him. He later told his pupils how, at the age ofsix, he had visited a place near Moscow (perhaps Zvenigorod) and thought that itwas not as he remembered it from four years earlier. Then he realized that hehad not been there before, and that his 'memory' of it must have been a dream.He also told Kenneth Walker about the occasion when his mother took him to hisfirst school. In a long corridor, when his mother admitted she was lost,Ouspensky told her that there was a passage further down, and that at the end ofit there were two steps, and a window through which they would see theheadmaster's garden, with lilies growing in it. The door of the headmaster'sstudy was nearby. He proved to be correct, although he had never been in thebuilding before. This sense of the mystery and ambiguity of time continued tohaunt his childhood; between the ages of six and eleven, he kept havingexperiences of dÃ©jÃ  vu - 'I have been here before.' He and his young sister - towhom he was very close - shared an ability to foretell the immediate future:they would sit at the nursery window and predict - accurately - what wouldhappen in the street. They never spoke to the adults about this, convinced thatthey wouldn't understand anyway.Nevertheless, Ouspensky was fortunate in his parents. Through his mother he cameto love poetry and the visual arts. But his father was also a keen amateurmathematician, who was fascinated by the then-fashionable subject of the fourthdimension, and by the age of 12, Ouspensky was as interested in science as inliterature and art. The Latin master who caught him reading a physics textbookin class confiscated it, and his fellow pupils murmured mockingly that Ouspenskyread physics. From the autobiographical novel The Strange Life of Ivan Osokin -started when he was in his mid-twenties - we gather that he had a particulardislike of this master, a German, and that he was generally a rebellious pupil.Osokin is, in fact, our main source of information about Ouspensky's childhoodand teens. It is a novel about 'Eternal Recurrence,' in which the hero, on theverge of committing suicide because he has lost the girl he loves, goes to see amagician, who offers to allow him to live the past few years over again. But itmakes no difference; he makes all the same mistakes, loses the girl again, andonce more goes to see the magician, to ask to be allowed to live his life overagain . . .How can we be sure that Osokin is autobiographical? Because Ouspensky admittedthat the girl, Zinaida, was a real person, and we know that certain other eventsin the novel also happened to him - for example, that he was expelled fromschool for a silly practical joke, that his mother died within two years of hisexpulsion, and that he went to Paris. His portrait of the rebellious youngOsokin is also close to what Ouspensky tells us about himself elsewhere. LikeOsokin, Ouspensky was a boarder at the Second Moscow Gymnasium; like Osokin, hefound the place stifling and squalid. 'I often want to smash my head against thewall from sheer boredom.' His neglect of his studies led the headmaster to orderhim to stay behind after school one day. Osokin finds that the caretaker hasforgotten to lock him in. He walks along the corridor, adorns a bust of JuliusCaesar with a pair of blue spectacles, and writes on the wall underneath it'Welcome your Excellency' - his Excellency being a school inspector who wasexpected later in the day. The next day he is expelled.Ouspensky's own expulsion - at the age of 16 - seems to have done him no harm.He enrolled as a 'free listener' at Moscow University, and completed hiseducation by reading. He was an excellent linguist, who had already learnedEnglish (although he never learned to speak it without a strong Russian accent),and in the 18 months after leaving school learned Italian well enough to readDante. But a deep distaste for Latin and Greek prevented him from going on totake a degree. In the year he left school he discovered Nietzsche, and wasdeeply struck by his concept of Eternal Recurrence. This, Ouspenskyconcluded,was what he had experienced in childhood - the moods of 'I have beenhere before.'A year later, his mother died. Perhaps to recover from the shock, Ouspenskybegan to travel - to Paris and to remote parts of Russia. In Osokin, hedescribes a visit to an uncle who lives on his country estate, and a love affairwith his uncle's ward Tanechka (a diminutive of Tania). The girl is two yearsOsokin's senior. They flirt, kiss and go for long walks in the woods. He iscovered with embarrassment when she calls him and he finds her standing naked ina stream. After that she spends the night in his room - it seems clear that sheis the one who does the seducing. Osokin's uncle finds out and sends him back toMoscow to become a student at the military academy. As far as we know, Ouspenskywas never at a military academy - but information about his early years is sosparse that he may well have been. What we do know is that he attended parties,drank too much vodka and was known to every policeman in Moscow because, farfrom being quarrelsome when drunk, he tried to act as peacemaker. 'One night',he told Carl Bechhofer Roberts, 'I remember I got home with the left sleeve ofmy overcoat missing. How I lost it, and where, I have never discovered.' Apartfrom such glimpses, we have virtually no idea of what Ouspensky did during the10 years between his expulsion from school and 1905, when his affair withZinaida came to an end and he tried to exorcise his misery by writing IvanOsokin (originally entitled 'The Wheel of Fortune') as a kind of film outline.This was also the year of the abortive revolution, when troops fired uponpeaceable crowds who had marched to the Winter Palace to present a petition tothe Tsar. In the past 20 years, Russia had become increasingly ungovernable, andthe new Tsar, Nicholas II, was a vacillator who changed his mind every day orso. He could not decide whether to establish a military dictatorship or to givethe liberals the constitution they wanted. Finally, he gave a constitution withone hand and took it back with the other: that is, he allowed the people toelect a parliament (called the Duma), but still kept his own government, whichheld all the real power. He was determined to remain an absolute ruler, butlacked all the necessary qualities. He was a weakling and a dreamer, whopreferred to spend his days in his summer palace with his family rather thangetting on with the business of running the country and trying to avert therevolution prophesied by the anarchists and Marxists.Ouspensky's beloved younger sister (we do not even have a record of her name)was also a dreamer and, like so many idealistic students, she joined therevolutionary movement. She was among those arrested in 1905 and thrown intoprison. Her arrest must have been a tragedy for Ouspensky, who would haverecalled clearly the fate of another idealistic student, Marie Vietroff, who hadbeen confined in the Peter and Paul fortress in 1896 because a forbidden bookhad been found in her room, and who had committed suicide by burning herself todeath after months of ill treatment, including rape. When, in 1908, Ouspensky'ssister died in prison, it must have confirmed his feeling that life is basicallyfutile and tragic.The truth is that Ouspensky, like the Tsar, was basically an ineffectual dreamerand a weakling. This is something that his later disciples would have found hardto imagine, for they knew him as a hard, stern man who was impatient of all talkof mysticism, and whose squarely-built figure seemed to reflect his pragmaticdisposition. But we only have to consider the facts to see that this is not atrue picture. After being expelled from school - which he hated with the ardourof a romantic who regards boredom as an affront to his dignity - he failed tokeep his promise to take a degree and spent his legacy wandering ineffectuallyfrom place to place, vaguely seeking for something he could not define. He laterclaimed that he was 'never such a fool' as Osokin, but this is hard to believe.In fact, what Osokin reveals is a dangerously romantic young man who isimmensely susceptible to women - Tanechka, Anna, Loulou, Valerie, Zinaida - andwho seems to believe that if only he could find the right one all his problemswould disappear . . .Most young Russians in Ouspensky's position would have found a job in the civilservice - which required very little effort - and devoted themselves to thestruggle for achievement in other spheres. Ouspensky merely seems to have wastedhis legacy (Osokin gambles it away), so that by 1905, when he was 27, he had tostart making a living by journalism. In A New Model of the Universe, he offersus a glimpse of himself in 1906 or 1907, sitting in the editorial office of theMoscow newspaper The Morning, trying to read foreign newspapers in French,German, English and Italian in order to write an article on the forthcomingHague Conference:Phrases, phrases, sympathetic, critical, ironical, blatant, pompous, lying, and,worst of all, utterly automatic phrases . . . But what can I say? It is all sotedious. Diplomats and all kinds of statesmen will gather together and talk,papers will approve or disapprove, sympathise or not sympathise. Then everythingwill be as it was, or even worse.And so he pushes aside the newspapers and opens a drawer of his desk 'crammedwith books with titles like The Occult World, Life after Death, Atlantis andLemuria, Dogme et Rituel de la Haute Magie, Le Temple de Satan and the like . .. I open one of the books, feeling that my article will not be written today . ..'This is fundamentally the nostalgic romanticism of the 1890s, of Dowson andVerlaine drinking themselves to death on absinthe, of W.B. Yeats daydreaming offairyland because he detests the real world. It is also the attitude ofGoncharov's Oblomov, unable to arouse himself to get out of bed, and of Gogol'slandowner Manilov, whose fantasies of fame and fortune 'grew so lively thateventually he could not even follow them himself'. Amusingly enough, Ouspenskycompares the Hague peacemakers to Gogol's Manilov - a classic example of the potcalling the kettle black.Ouspensky goes on to meditate that he would like to print his true thoughtsabout the Hague Conference, but knows that they would only land him in jail. Andeven if they got into print, nobody would read them. 'What is the use ofattempting to expose lies when people like them and live by them? It is theirown affair; but I am tired of lying . . .' And so he turns back to his books onmagic and Atlantis . . . All of which makes it very clear that even in his latetwenties, Ouspensky was still a rather ineffectual romantic who blamed the worldfor his own shortcomings.We know little of these years except that Ouspensky attended meetings of theTheosophical Society and travelled widely as a journalist. In his introductionto a translation of Ouspensky's Talks with a Devil, J.G. Bennett writes:Little is known of this period of his life, and I can report only the episodes Iheard from him in the course of conversations. He was a successful journalistworking on the leading Russian papers, but more often as a free lance. Hetravelled in Europe and the United States writing articles for St Petersburgpapers between 1908 and 1912.(St Petersburg may here be a slip for Moscow.)It was in 1912 that Ouspensky achieved his ambition to go to India with an opencommission to write articles for three Russian newspapers. He proceeded viaLondon, and there made an acquaintance who later proved to be extremely valuable- A.R. Orage, a charismatic socialist who was the editor of one of the mostwidely read magazines of the period, The New Age. Promising Orage to send himsome contributions, Ouspensky then travelled on to Egypt, where he was deeplyfascinated by the Sphinx, then to India, where he met some of the outstandingyogis of his time, including Aurobindo. He was not impressed by any of them. Heexplained afterwards that he was looking for 'real knowledge' and had found onlyholy men who may have achieved liberation for themselves but could not transmittheir methods to others. He also spent some time at Adhyar inMadras, theheadquarters of the Theosophical Society, of which he had been a member since1906. In later years he liked to tell the story of the 'caste system' at Adhyar.On the ground floor were all the hangers-on and undistinguished visitors. Thesecond floor was reserved for well-wishers who gave their money and support tothe society. The top floor, with a large open roof, was the home of the esotericgroup, the real initiates of Theosophy. Ouspensky recalled with relish that hewas at once admitted to the esoteric group in spite of his no longer being amember of the Theosophical Society and his open criticism of their founder,Helena Blavatsky. He asserted that he found nothing at Adhyar that made him wishto stay. According to J.G. Bennett:He went on to Ceylon, which he found more congenial, and he met several of themore famous bhikkus, and satisfied himself that the old techniques of Buddhismwere still being used in Ceylon. But once again he felt no urge to cut himselfoff from the West and become a monk. He wrote later that he was not interestedin a way that would isolate him from the Western world, which held the key tothe future of mankind. This did not mean that he doubted the existence of'schools', as he called them, in India and Ceylon, but that these schools nolonger had the significance that they used to have in the past. He also addedthat he found that most of these schools relied upon religious and devotionaltechniques that he was convinced were insufficient for penetrating into theessential reality for which he was seeking.No doubt full records of this period of Ouspensky's life exist in the variousnewspapers he wrote for and will one day be published by some diligentresearcher. Yet, while they would provide us with facts, they could hardly helpus to a deeper understanding than Ouspensky himself provides in Osokin and theslightly later Talks with a Devil. The latter consists of two stories, the firstof which, 'The Inventor', utilizes Ouspensky's American experience. The inventoris an American called Hugh B., who finds himself working in a factory, at a jobthat bores him. One day, as he is copying a design for a new machine, herealizes that it could be improved by a simple change. The designer becomesindignant at the suggestion and shouts at him. But the manager begins to seethat Hugh is correct, and makes him senior draughtsman. Hugh is stilldissatisfied because he is still underpaid for his inventions. He marries, buthe and his wife are soon at loggerheads. All his attempts to achieve recognitionas an inventor come to nothing. One day, like Ivan Osokin, he decides to commitsuicide . . .But at this point, fate intervenes to change his life. As he is buying arevolver with which to end his life, he has an idea for an automatic revolverthat will fire like a machine gun. By the time he gets back home, his wife hasleft him, but he is so obsessed by his new invention that he takes it in hisstride. (At this point, the devil who is recounting the story to Ouspensky hasto admit that he cannot even begin to understand how a man can becomeenthusiastic about a mere invention . . . )The prototype revolver is made, but no one seems to be interested. When one dayHugh encounters another inventor whose life has been a total failure, he almostloses courage. But eventually he meets a friend who is about to sell hisfactory, and the two go into partnership. At last, the new revolver ismanufactured - but it sells so badly that Hugh is tempted to dispose of hispatent for 1,000 dollars . . .At this point, though, fate again takes a hand. In Paris, a famous singer ismurdered by her lesbian lover with one of Hugh's revolvers. A book about thecase becomes a bestseller and Hugh's factory is suddenly inundated with orders.Every time there is a murder or political catastrophe involving the newrepeating pistol, they receive still more orders. Soon Hugh is a millionaire andis reunited with his wife . . .So far, the story seems to be as deeply pessimistic as Osokin: despair leads tothe decision to commit suicide; fate intervenes and brings success, but thesuccess involves death and misery, and the death and misery bring still moresuccess until the inventor feels that life has become meaningless. But at thispoint, we become aware that Ouspensky is no longer a pessimist trapped in theidea of Eternal Recurrence. As Hugh stands on the bridge of his yacht on theAmazon, gazing at the stars, he is suddenly imbued with a passion for astronomy.He spends the rest of the cruise reading books about the stars and, when hereturns home, builds an observatory. 'Now he worked for the sake of knowledgealone, creative work, winning over and extorting from nature her closest secrets. . .' Hugh has slipped out of the grip of the devil, whose aim is to confinehuman beings to the narrowness of the material world. And when his wife decidesto devote herself to healing the blind, the devil takes his leave, protestingthat he is revolted by her sentimentality.In a footnote in Talks with a Devil, Ouspensky acknowledges that he hasunconsciously plagiarized an idea from Dostoevsky's scene with the Devil in TheBrothers Karamazov. In fact, Talks with a Devil is altogether closer to thethird act of Shaw's Man and Superman, the dream episode called 'Don Juan inHell'. Shaw's Devil is also a materialist, who has designed Hell as a placewhere human beings can relax and enjoy themselves. He believes that the aim oflife is happiness, good fellowship and artistic enjoyment. Understandably,religious people strike him as cranks; so do philosophers and scientists and allhuman beings driven by an obscure craving to evolve. Shaw argues that thepurpose of the 'Life Force' is to create Intelligence, a brain through whichLife can become conscious of its own purposes, so that it can pursue thesepurposes in the full light of consciousness. Nothing can satisfy the highesttype of human being except to help life in its struggle to evolve.In the second of the Talks with a Devil, the story called 'The BenevolentDevil', Ouspensky develops ideas that are strikingly similar to Shaw's. Hedescribes a visit to the caves of Ellora, in Northeast Bombay state, which isfollowed by a dream in which he meets the Devil (now spelt with a capital D) inthe temple of Kailas, and they resume the conversation that was broken off inthe previous story.The Devil begins by explaining that, as far as he is concerned, 'this' world isthe only reality, and there is nothing beyond it. 'The kingdom of matter iseternal.' Then he explains that there are two kinds of human beings: one, thedescendants of animals, who live entirely on the material plane, and 'whoselives consist of harbouring grudges and trying to get out of difficulties byburdening others with them', and two, the descendants of Adam and Eve, whosuffer from 'religious mania', and believe in absurd ideals. He goes on toexplain how he seduced Adam and Eve into materialism by giving them largequantities of a delicious fruit which they liked so much that they began to eatit three times a day. They became so obsessed by this fruit that they forgot alltheir 'imaginary ideals'. Then they began to quarrel, and when Eve left Adam, hefound himself three wives from a nearby tribe, while Eve took a lover. And sothe Fall began . . .Unfortunately, the descendants of Adam and Eve have never lost their vision ofthe imaginary ideal and it takes a whole army of devils to prevent them frombacksliding into virtue.The Devil now tells the story of a young man called Leslie White, to whomOuspensky has introduced a Sinhalese yogi. After a long talk with the yogi,Leslie decides to forgo his dinner - he is not really hungry anyway - and tospend the evening reading some books that have arrived that morning. Watchedanxiously by his personal little demon, Leslie settles down in an armchair witha weak whisky and soda. As soon as he becomes absorbed in the world of thebooks, the demon loses sight of him; Leslie seems to vanish into thin air. This,Ouspensky realizes, is because 'his whole being was immersed in the world ofideas, and material reality did not exist for him'.So that is the secret, I thought. To get away from reality means to get awayfrom the devil, to become invisible to him. This . . . signifies, in reverse,that people of dull reality, practical, workaday people, in general all ordinarysober people, belong absolutely and completely to the devil . . . To be frank, Iwas delighted by this discovery.Love, it seems, is another way in which the demon can 'lose' his prey, for whena person is romantically in love, the feeling surrounds him like a wall, and hebecomes invisible . . .The demon servant now begins trying to seduce Leslie back to laziness andself-indulgence. To dull his senses, he puts him out an unusually large andtasty breakfast. Leslie is unable to resist it and his sense of latentpossibilities collapses . . .Later that day he goes to tea at the house of Lady Gerald, and there he sees,for the second time, a girl called Margaret, to whom he is powerfully attracted.She obviously feels the same. He begins to tell her about the old yogi and sheunderstands him.Leslie suddenly understood that if he could take the two steps which separatedhim from Margaret and then take her by the waist and lead her right down to thesea, walk with her along the waters edge, feel it roll under their feet, furtherand further on, until the stars began to shine, somewhere where there were nopeople, but only the two of them, then straight away everything that the oldIndian had spoken about would become a complete reality.But the moment passes - and as it does so, Leslie has an overwhelming sense thatthis has all happened before, and that he has lost Margaret before in the sameway.On his way home, he daydreams about her, and again the demon feels he is losinghim. So he sends someone to invite him to dinner, and then makes sure that heovereats. (The demon can even turn himself into particularly delicious-lookingdishes.) Finally, although tempted to stay awake and think out his problems,Leslie has a whisky and soda, and falls asleep. The demon looks utterlyexhausted.'You see,' said the Devil, 'that is what our life is like. Is that notself-sacrifice? Think of it: the poor little devil must keep watch over everystep he takes, not leaving him even for one moment. He allows himself to beeaten up, works himself into such a state, and there is still the risk of losinghim because of his various silly fantasies . . .'And it seems that Leslie is, in fact, lost to his demon. The words of the yogihave awakened him, and he goes into a Buddhist monastery and begins to practisefasting and meditation. 'But,' says the Devil, 'I have not lost him yet. I stillhave one trick up my sleeve. The stake is on nobility . . .'Ouspensky learns what he means when he sees Leslie again in London, two monthsafter the outbreak of the First World War. He is marching alongside his platoon,on his way to fight. The stake is on nobility . . .' War, in which thedescendants of Adam and Eve fight one another and believe it is all for the sakeof the highest ideals, is the Devil's ultimate seduction . . . This time theDevil has won.Together with Ivan Osokin, these two Talks with a Devil afford a fundamentalinsight into Ouspensky's vision of human existence. It is at once romantic andpessimistic. The world is divided into black and white: the children of Adam andthe descendants of the beasts, who belong to the Devil. Daydreaming enables usto escape from the Devil. So does falling in love. But the Devil usually has anextra trick up his sleeve, and man's chances of evolving are very slim indeed.It never seems to strike Ouspensky that daydreaming, and the kind of lassitudeand pessimism that can spring from it, are as harmful in their way as theDevil's materialism. They encourage man to sit on the sidelines and sneer at thepeacemakers while escaping into a world of romantic imaginings. They encouragehim to believe that the answer lies in finding an ideal woman, or in finding aTeacher who can initiate him into the Great Secret. In short, they encourage himto look everywhere for the answer but inside himself . . .Yet all this is not entirely fair to Ouspensky. For by 1914 - when he was on theeve of meeting his long-awaited Teacher - he had already taken some major stepstowards solving the problems that tormented Ivan Osokin. In fact, in somerespects he had even gone further than his Teacher."},{"pageContent":"TwoTHE ROMANTIC REALISTOuspensky sailed from London, and arrived back in a St Petersburg whose name hadbeen changed to Petrograd (because in the frenzy of World War One patriotism, StPetersburg sounded too German).Back in his newspaper office in Moscow, he saw a notice for a ballet called TheStruggle of the Magicians, which declared that the action took place in Indiaand would give a complete picture of Oriental magic. Ouspensky published it inhis column, with the sarcastic comment that it would contain everything thatcannot be found in the real India. After that, he went to Petrograd, where hedelivered two highly successful lectures about his travels in the East, both ofwhich attracted audiences of more than a thousand.It was when he repeated the same lectures in Moscow that two new acquaintances -a musician and a sculptor - told him about a teacher called Gurdjieff, aCaucasian Greek who was also the author of the ballet about India. It seemedthat Gurdjieff possessed remarkable hypnotic powers. Ouspensky was sceptical:'People invent miracles for themselves, and invent exactly what is expected fromthem.' Nevertheless, he eventually agreed to meet Gurdjieff.We arrived in a small cafÃ© in a noisy though not central street. I saw a man ofan oriental type, no longer young, with a black moustache and piercing eyes, whoastonished me first of all because he seemed to be . . . completely out ofkeeping with the place and its atmosphere . . . this man, with the face of anIndian rajah or an Arab sheik, whom I at once seemed to see in a white burnooseor a gilded turban . . . produced the . . . impression of a man poorlydisguised.Gurdjieff spoke with a strong Caucasian accent, which would have sounded ratherprovincial to Ouspensky.And what did Gurdjieff see? Ouspensky was a man of medium height, with closelycropped hair, a prim mouth, and eyes that peered short-sightedly through thickpince-nez glasses. Another disciple of Gurdjieff, the musician Thomas deHartmann, described him as 'simple, courteous, approachable and intelligent'. Inlater years he struck people as unapproachable and cold; in March 1915, he wouldstill have been a great deal like the romantic young student who got drunk onvodka and tried to make peace with everybody. But he was also a well-knownwriter and journalist, whose lectures had attracted widespread attention; so henow had the confidence not to succumb to the charisma of this man with thepiercing eyes, but to regard him with a certain scepticism. And althoughGurdjieff spoke knowledgeably about yoga, Ouspensky's scepticism seemed to bejustified when Gurdjieff declined to name some of the eminent professors whom heclaimed were interested in his work. It increased when Gurdjieff took him to aflat to meet his pupils. He had spoken of the enormous expense of the apartmentshe had taken for his 'Work', but this place was obviously the kind of flat thatschoolteachers were given free. One of the pupils read aloud from a manuscriptin which someone described a meeting with Gurdjieff; it struck Ouspensky asobscure and lacking in literary skill. When Gurdjieff asked him if it could bepublished in a newspaper, Ouspensky suspected that this oriental gentleman wassimply trying to make use of him. As he left the place - in company with one ofthe pupils - Ouspensky was tempted to make fun of Gurdjieff, but allowed cautionto prevail.In fact, as he discovered later, Gurdjieff made a habit of trying to presenthimself in the worst possible light when he first met potential pupils. If theyassumed he was a charlatan, it proved they lacked penetration. Ouspensky was notput off; he accepted subsequent suggestions to meet Gurdjieff in noisy cafÃ©s,and was not even discouraged when Gurdjieff suggested that he should pay 1,000roubles a year. But when Gurdjieff hinted that he was willing to acceptOuspensky as a pupil, Ouspensky explained that he would be unable to give anyundertaking to keep Gurdjieff's teachings secret. Gurdjieff apparently accededto this. 'There are no conditions of any kind . . . Our starting point is thatman does not know himself, that he is not.' He went on to state the principlethat Ouspensky was to emphasize for the rest of his life: that man has no single'I', but dozens of 'I's', replacing one another with the bewildering rapidity ofa game of musical chairs. And at a later meeting, he stated his basic principle:that human beings are basically machines, and that our belief that we possessfree will is an illusion. Man could develop some degree of free will, but itwould cost an immense effort. Moreover, his starting point would need to be therecognition that he is basically a machine, a kind of robot, merely reacting tostimuli like a penny-in-the-slot machine.Ouspensky was deeply impressed. All this was very close to his own feelingsabout human beings, the feelings he had expressed in Osokin and 'The Inventor'.But in 'The Inventor', he had made the assumption that his hero could escapefrom 'the trap' by turning his attention to higher intellectual pursuits. IfGurdjieff was correct, that would do him no good whatsoever; an intellectual isas 'robotic' as a peasant.'Take yourself,' said Gurdjieff. 'If you understood everything you had writtenin your own book, what is it called?' - he made something impossible out of thewords 'Tertium Organum' - 'I should come and bow down to you and beg you toteach me. But you do not understand either what you read or what you write.'It was a disturbing picture - even more disturbing than Ouspensky's own pictureof man as a plaything of demons, or a helpless puppet in the grip of EternalRecurrence. Yet apparently Gurdjieff was certain that there was an escape fromthe trap. Man could be galvanized out of his condition of 'sleep' into somethinglike waking consciousness. It was this assurance that led Ouspensky to decide toaccept Gurdjieff as his teacher.This was, of course, inevitable. Ouspensky had spent so many years looking forsomeone to tell him 'The Answer', how to achieve 'higher states' of awareness,how to hold on to the mystical glimpses of sheer affirmation, that if he haddecided to ignore Gurdjieff's offer, he would have spent the rest of his lifewondering what he had missed. Yet with the wisdom of hindsight, we can see thathis decision involved certain disadvantages that would continue to haunt him forthe rest of his life. Gurdjieff was right when he said that if Ouspensky hadunderstood everything he had written in Tertium Organum, he would have been agreat teacher. In spite of the pessimism of Osokin and Talks with a Devil,Ouspensky had come very close indeed to finding his own answer. There was abasic sense in which he did not need Gurdjieff. In order to understand this, weneed to look more closely at Tertium Organum (subtitled 'A Key to the Enigmas ofthe World'), which had been published in 1912.Let us begin by looking at an experience that dated from 1908:It was in the sea of Marmora, on a rainy day of winter, the far-off high androcky shores were of a pronounced violet colour of every shade, including themost tender, fading into grey and blending with the grey sky. The sea was thecolour of lead mixed with silver. I remember all these colours. The steamer wasgoing north. I remained at the rail, looking at the waves. The white crest ofwaves were running towards us. A wave would run at the ship, raised as ifdesiring to hurl its crest upon it, rushing up with a howl. The steamer heeled,shuddered and slowly straightened back; then from afar a new wave came running,I watched this play of waves with the ship, and felt them draw me to themselves.It was not at all that desire to jump down which one feels in mountains butsomething infinitely more subtle. The waves were drawing my soul to themselves.And suddenly I felt that it went to them. It lasted an instant, perhaps lessthan an instant, but I entered into the waves, and with them rushed with a howlat the ship. And in that instant I became all. The waves - they were myself; thefar violet mountains, the wind, the clouds hurrying from the north, the greatsteamship, heeling and rushing irresistibly forward - all were myself. I sensedthe enormous heavy body - my body - all its motions, shudderings, waverings andvibrations, fire, pressure of steam and weight of engines were inside me, theunmerciful and unyielding propelling screw which pushed and pushed me forward,never for a moment releasing me, the rudder which determined all my motion - allthis was myself: also two sailors . . . and the black snake of smoke coming inclouds out of the funnel . . . all.It was an instant of unusual freedom, joy and expansion. A second - and thespell of the charm disappeared. It passed like a dream when one tries toremember it. But the sensation was so powerful, so bright and so unusual that Iwas afraid to move and waited for it to recur. But it did not return, and amoment later I could not say that it had been - could not say whether it was areality or merely the thought that, looking at the waves, it might be so.Two years later, the yellowish waves of the Finnish gulf and a green sky gave mea taste of the same sensation, but this time it was dissipated almost before itappeared.Now what has happened to Ouspensky is very clear. The sheer exhilaration of thewaves has momentarily lifted his consciousness into an orgasmic sensation ofsheer power, enormous health and strength. Our senses normally seem to extendscarcely beyond our bodies; objects seen around us are dim and slightly unreal.But a sudden great effort of will, or a reflection of the external forces ofnature, can strengthen the 'intentionality' of perception so that our gaze seemsto be a spear thrown from behind the eyes. In such moments, our usual vapid,feeble sense of our own identity vanishes for a moment in a sense of sheer joy.Hence the feeling of 'oneness'. It could be compared to the sensation one mightexperience if, in a crowd cheering with happiness, one flung one's arms around atotal stranger and felt as much love as for one's brother or sister.This is basically the 'secret' Ouspensky was looking for. Since he waspersonally so withdrawn and shy, it must have seemed beyond his grasp. But thesensation his experience left behind was obviously that our senses act asjailers, preventing us from grasping the reality that lies around us.This leads us to the starting point of Tertium Organum, a chapter called (ratherunpromisingly) 'Subjective and Objective'. What, Ouspensky asks, do we reallyknow about that world 'outside' us? If he could feel that he had become thewaves and the ship, how can the usual distinction between subject and object beas 'real' as it seems?According to Bishop Berkeley, such a distinction is quite unreal. Our senses arenot 'windows'; they are interpreters, and they translate the information thatbombards them into terms we can understand. Energy of 16 millionths of an inchstrikes our eyes, and our eyes translate it into redness. Energy of 32millionths of an inch strikes us, and we translate it into violet. Energy of ahigher wavelength - ultra-violet, for example - is invisible to us because oursenses feel that it is of no use to us. So we do not live in a real world, butin an interpreted world. That tree is 'out there', but for all practicalpurposes it is inside my head. Berkeley argues that we have no proof of theexistence of a world 'out there'; it might all be a delusion, like a film showprojected on my eyeballs.Kant did his best to rescue philosophy from this uncomfortable position. We donot create the real world, he says, but our senses establish the conditions forthe world we see. They are rather like a nightclub doorkeeper who will only letin people who are respectably dressed. And their criterion for respectability,says Kant, is that things have to be dressed in space and time. Nakedness is notallowed.But this means that you and I can never know what the clients look like withouttheir clothes on. We can never know the 'things in themselves', as they werebefore they had to put on dinner jackets and long dresses. So, at any rate, saidKant. And Ouspensky is willing to accept his views on the matter.But in the last decades of the nineteenth century, a writer called C.H. Hintoncaused a sensation by extending Kant's idea in a most fascinating manner. Verywell, says Hinton, our senses act like doorkeepers who force the clientele todress in a respectable manner. But in that case, it is our senses that make therule that our world has three dimensions - length, breadth and height. Whyshould it not relax its standards, and permit a world with four dimensions -length, breadth, height, and another dimension at right angles to these?Why make such a supposition in the first place? It seems to have come about as aresult of some of the puzzles of the new 'science' of psychical research, whichbegan to come into being in the 1860s. The 'occult revival' began in 1848, withloud banging and rapping noises in the house of a New York farmer named Fox.These later turned into classic 'poltergeist' phenomena, with objects flyingthrough the air. Soon hundreds of 'mediums' were causing even more spectaculareffects - trumpets played themselves as they floated in space, tables rose fromthe ground, flowers materialized out of the air, and ghostly hands stroked thefaces of the 'sitters' at seances. Moreover, poltergeists seemed to have theability to cause solid objects to fly through walls. The solution, many'Spiritualists' came to believe, was a fourth dimension. If spirits inhabited auniverse with an extra dimension, then a poltergeist would not actually bethrowing an object through a wall, but 'over' it, into the fourth dimension -just as a giant could step over a wall that would be an insurmountable obstacleto a beetle.A Professor Johann Carl Friederich Zollner, of the University of Leipzig, seemsto have originated this theory that spirits inhabit a four-dimensional world,and he decided to test it by asking a 'medium' if he could get the spirits totie a knot in a piece of string whose two ends had been joined together in acircle (and also sealed with sealing wax). The experiment took place in 1877,with an American medium called Henry Slade, and Slade - or the spirits - tiedthe knot in the string at his first attempt. One of the witnesses to theexperiment was Zollner's fellow professor Gustav Fechner, who had written anessay on 'Why Space Has Four Dimensions' as early as 1846. Unfortunately, Sladehad been tried and convicted of cheating in London in the previous year -Professor Ray Lankester had snatched a slate before the 'spirits' had time towrite on it, and found that it was already written on. Slade insisted that hehad heard the squeak of the slate pencil moments before Lankester snatched theslate.Alas, in later life, Slade was often caught cheating, which would seem todispose of him as a witness for the fourth dimension. But this assumption may betoo hasty. The Society for Psychical Research, formed in 1882, reached theconclusion that although mediums do cheat, the evidence for the reality ofspiritualistic phenomena - including poltergeists - is overwhelming. Theirexperience also confirmed that many 'genuine' mediums sometimes resorted tocheating. Slade was later caught cheating before the Seybert Committee inPhiladelphia, and he acknowledged to them that Zollner had watched him closelyonly for the first three or four sittings, then allowed him to do as he liked.But since the knotted string was produced at the first sitting, it seemspossible that it was genuine.To Ouspensky, it seemed obvious that the idea of the fourth dimension is one ofthe most important that human beings can contemplate. When we are tired, ourminds simply accept the material world around us without question; everything ismerely 'itself'. But as soon as we experience the sense of happiness andexcitement that often comes on spring mornings, or setting out on holiday, theworld is seen to be full of infinite possibilities, and nothing is merely'itself': everything seems to stand for something that is more than itself, justas the words on this page stand for something more than themselves. Hintonhimself grasped this notion in an essay called 'Many Dimensions', where hespeaks of errand boys reading 'penny dreadfuls', and how they could be spendingtheir time more fruitfully 'communing with space' (which for Hinton meant tryingto think three-dimensionally). Then he goes on to say:And yet, looking at the same printed papers, being curious and looking deeperand deeper into them with a microscope, I have seen that in splodgy ink strokeand dull fibrous texture, each part was definite, exact, absolutely so far andno farther, punctiliously correct; and deeper and deeper lying a wealth of form,a rich variety and amplitude of shapes, that in a moment leapt higher than mywildest dreams could conceive.What Hinton means is that the paper contains all the mysteries of space itself.But he might have gone farther, and recognized that even the silliest pennydreadful, explored to its depths, would reveal unknown vistas of the humanimagination.This is the aspect of the fourth dimension that fascinates Ouspensky. And heexpands it in some of the most remarkable and profound pages of Tertium Organum.Chapter 14 begins:It seems to us that we see something and understand something. But in realityall that proceeds around us we sense only very confusedly, just as a snailsenses confusedly the sunlight, the darkness and the rain.Here we note immediately the quality that makes Ouspensky such a good writer:his clarity. He has an enviable ability to say exactly and precisely what hemeans. But this image of the snail does more than that: it conveys in a fewwords Ouspensky's feeling that we are surrounded by a vast, unknown universe,and that our assumptions and presuppositions cut us off from this world ofreality. We may, in fact, reject Kant, and his notion that space and time aremerely the clothes that the nightclub doorman forces the customers to wear; wemay even assume that that pillar box really is red, and not that our eyes merelyinterpret its wavelength as redness. But we may nevertheless accept Ouspensky'scentral point: that our perception is 'prejudiced', and we often see only whatwe expect to see.Ouspensky goes on to tell a story that makes the same point. He describes how heand a friend were crossing the River Neva in St Petersburg:We had been talking, but both fell silent as we approached the [Peter and Paul]fortress, gazing up at its walls and making probably the same reflection. 'Rightthere are also factory chimneys', said A. Behind the walls of the fortressindeed appeared some brick chimneys blackened by smoke.On his saying this, I too sensed the difference between the chimneys and theprison walls with unusual clearness and like an electric shock. I realised thedifference between the very bricks themselves . . .Later in conversation with A, I recalled this episode, and he told me that notonly then, butalways, he sensed these differences and was deeply convinced oftheir reality.Ouspensky goes on to say that the wood of a gallows, a crucifix and the mast ofa ship is, in fact, a quite different material in each case. Chemical analysiscould not detect it; but then, chemical analysis cannot detect the differencebetween twins, who are nevertheless quite different personalities.They are only the shadows of real things, the substance of which is contained intheir function. The shadow of a sailor, of a hangman and of an ascetic may bequite similar - it is impossible to distinguish them by their shadows, just asit is impossible to find any difference between the wood of a mast, of a gallowsand of a cross by chemical analysis.This realization is an extension of his insight on the Sea of Marmora. In thatcase, sheer exaltation had somehow amplified the strength of his senses - justas hunger amplifies a man's appetite so he appreciates his food far more. Andthis appreciation amounts to a sharper perception of the difference betweenroast beef and new potatoes and spring cabbage.Our problem is to maintain this recognition of 'difference' even when our sensesare tired. If we enter a room in total darkness, we do not assume that all thefurniture has disappeared merely because we cannot see it. We know it is there.We need to impress this conviction of 'difference' upon our minds so deeply thatwe know it is there even when we cannot see it. What good would that do? Itwould prevent us from falling into the negativity that devastates our energy andsense of purpose - and which also happens to be the chief problem of all humanbeings. On a spring morning, when we can see endless 'difference' around us, andour minds are bubbling with optimism, it seems incredible that human beings canso forget this vision that they collapse into defeat, even into suicide. YetOuspensky himself clearly came close to suicide when he lost his Zinaida. Sothis question of difference is not merely an abstract philosophical issue; it isa matter of life and deathIt is this sense of urgency and excitement that makes Tertium Organum such arefreshing book. Ouspensky is on to something important - in fact, to the mostimportant question, and he knows it. He senses that the experience on the Sea ofMarmora, or walking towards the Peter and Paul fortress, could lead to a new wayof living, a new kind of freedom. He is like a migratory bird that can smell itshome. For more than 10,000 years, increasing knowledge has given man increasingpower over his environment; but it has not, apparently, given him increasingpower over himself. Yet Ouspensky has glimpsed the answer. Perception is like aspear thrown towards an object. But our innate pessimism and laziness prevent usfrom putting any force behind the throw. Our negativity means that we allowourselves to 'leak' energy. Yet the mere recognition of what is wrong shouldenable us to put it right, to maintain an inner level of drive and optimism thatwould simply prevent us from being susceptible to such leaks.Ouspensky asks:First of all, what is the new knowledge? The new knowledge is direct knowledgeby an inner sense. I feel my own pain directly; the new knowledge can give methe power to sense, as mine, the pain of another man.What Ouspensky can feel, intuitively, is that if he can get rid of his tendencyto negativity and self-doubt, his Russian melancholy, he can be a quitedifferent kind of person. When we are asleep, or very tired, we lose evenintuitive knowledge of ourselves; consciousness 'blurs'. When we are awake, wesuddenly 'know' ourselves. If we were 10 times as awake - if our senses were farmore highly energized - would we not 'know' other people with equal certainty?Our senses could be compared to flat batteries. How do we 'charge' them? Bysheer 'concentrated attention', which has the same 'recharging' effect on thesenses that driving a car has on the car battery. (Example: as you are readingthis book, stop 'merely reading'. Concentrate your full attention; clench yourfists, use the muscles of your face and forehead to focus your energies: but goon reading. Even a minute of this kind of effort will bring a curious sense ofpower and meaning, for your intellect is ceasing to work in vacuo, and isentering into active combination with your vital energies.) This is what theyogi strives for as he sits cross-legged, concentrating attention 'at the rootof the eyebrows'. Unfortunately, Ouspensky's Western-style romanticism inclinedhim to discount this aspect of Eastern religion.Tertium Organum ends with a chapter about mysticism, dealing with the phenomenonthat R.M. Bucke called 'cosmic consciousness'. This, Ouspensky recognizes, iswhat the human race is evolving towards. He quotes the mystic Edward Carpenter:Men will not worry about death or a future, about the kingdom of heaven, aboutwhat may come with and after the cessation of life of the present body. Eachsoul will feel and know itself to be immortal, will feel and know that theentire universe with all its good and all its beauty is for it and belongs to itforever. The world peopled by men possessing cosmic consciousness will be as farremoved from the world of today as this is from the world before the advent ofself-consciousness.This is a fundamentally Nietzschean view; it springs out of Zarathustra'srecognition that the most basic answer lies in 'great health' - which, in turn,depends on stopping ourselves from leaking.This is why Gurdjieff told Ouspensky that if he understood everything in his ownbook, he would be a great teacher.Ouspensky's problem was that he had not yet grasped everything in his own book.He had, without knowing it, solved the basic problem of Ivan Osokin: theweakness, the self-pity, the Tchaikovskian melancholy. The basic solution lay inrecognizing that they were analogous to the snail's perception of the sunlight,the darkness and the rain. Once the snail has learned that the limits of itsshell are not the limits of the universe, it has also taken the most importantstep towards perceiving that universe as it really is, rather than as astifling, trivial, petty, personal illusion.These insights had thrown Ouspensky's mind into a ferment. He saw threadsstretching out from his central idea to all kinds of apparently contradictorynotions: Nietzsche's Superman, the message of the New Testament, yoga, thesymbolism of the Tarot, dreams and hypnosis, the ideas of Einstein, EternalRecurrence, mysticism, the importance of sex in the evolutionary scheme . . .The next task was to begin to get this explosion of insights and connectionsdown on paper. And so, even before setting out for his trip to Egypt, India andCeylon, he had started to write the book that would become A New Model of theUniverse, a work that would contain the most important essay he ever wrote: thechapter called 'Experimental Mysticism'. He was still engaged upon this bookwhen he met Gurdjieff.Now we can begin to see why, in a certain sense, the meeting with Gurdjieff wasOuspensky's greatest personal disaster. He had already found his own answer,even if he did not know that he knew it. All he had to do was to pursue it, tothink about it repeatedly until he had plumbed it to its depths. And at thispoint he met the man whose philosophy hurled him back into the pessimism of 10years earlier. For Gurdjieff, man is a machine, a helpless puppet in the handsof fate. Eight years later, a young English doctor named Kenneth Walker wouldattend a talk by Ouspensky in a dreary room in Kensington, and would recordOuspensky's first words: that man likes to believe that he possesses a real andpermanent 'I', whereas in fact he possesses dozens of 'I's', all struggling forpossession; he is virtually a 'multiple personality'.A man also prides himself on being self-conscious, where as even a short courseof self-study will reveal the fact that one is very rarely aware of oneself, andthen only fora few fleeting moments. Man believes that he has will, that he can'do', but this is also untrue. Everything happens in us in the same way thatchanges in the weather happen. Just as it rains, it snows, it clears up and isfine, so also, within us, it likes or it does not like, it is pleased or it isdistressed. We are machines set in motion by external influences, by impressionsreaching us from the outside world.There is a simple objection to this: it is untrue. That is to say, it carries anaccurate observation to a point at which it becomes untrue. The real trouble isthat we allow our intellect and senses to operate in vacuo, and not inassociation with our vital forces, our sense of 'urgency'.Now if Ouspensky had been as pessimistic as he sounds, he would not have beengiving a lecture. His whole point - and Gurdjieff's - is that recognition ofman's lack of freedom is the first step towards achieving some kind of freedom.Man must do this by struggle, by 'work on himself', by self-observation. Theproblem for Ouspensky's listeners, as Walker and a dozen others have made clear,is that his gloomy outlook communicated itself to his audience, producing theopposite effect to that he would have produced if he had spent the eveningtalking to them about the ideas of Tertium Organum. Walker notes that the room,with its uncomfortable chairs, reminded him of the Presbyterian churches of hisScottish childhood, and of the congregation awaiting the arrival of the minister- who would tell them they were all damned. This, in effect, is what Ouspenskywas doing. This is what Gurdjieff did to Ouspensky.The objection to Ouspensky's view can be stated simply. The basic problem forhuman beings is to break through to higher levels of energy, to what WilliamJames called - in an important essay - 'Vital Reserves'. James started from therecognition that there are certain days on which we feel more alive than onothers. Much of the time, 'most of us feel as if a sort of cloud weighed upon us. . . Compared to what we ought to be we are only half awake.' James recognizedthat we are, at least, half awake, not fast asleep:In some persons this sense of being cut off from their rightful resources isextreme, and we then get the formidable neurasthenic and psychasthenicconditions, with life grown into one tissue of impossibilities, that so manymedical books describe.Stating the thing broadly, the human individual thus lives usually far withinhis limits; he possesses powers of various sorts which he habitually fails touse. He energises below his maximum, and he behaves below his optimum. Inelementary faculty, in coordination, in power of inhibition and control, inevery conceivable way, his life is contracted like the field of vision of anhysteric subject - but with less excuse, for the poor hysteric is diseased,while in the rest of us, it is only an inveterate habit - the habit ofinferiority to our full self - that is bad.He goes on to ask how unusual men manage to escape these limitations, andanswers - exactly as Gurdjieff answered:Either some unusual stimulus fills them with emotional excitement, or someunusual idea of necessity induces them to make an extra effort of will.Excitements, ideas, and efforts, in a word, are what carry them over the dam.He goes on to make an observation that was also the basis of Gurdjieff's 'Work':In these 'hyperaesthetic' conditions which chronic invalidism so often brings inits train, the dam has changed its normal place. The slightest functionalexercise gives a distress which the patient yields to and stops. In such casesof 'habit-neurosis' a new range of power often comes in consequence of the'bullying-treatment,' of efforts which the doctor obliges the patient, muchagainst his will, to make. First comes the very extremity of distress, thenfollows unexpected relief.Gurdjieff's basic method was to combat 'habit-neurosis' through a version of the'bullying treatment' - by forcing his followers to make efforts that brought'the very extremity of distress', followed by a sudden sense of freedom, as if astrait-jacket had been loosened.William James had arrived at these conclusions through unpleasant personalexperience. In The Varieties of Religious Experience, he describes how, at theage of 28, he fell into a state of general pessimism about his prospects:I went one evening into a dressing-room in the twilight to procure some articlethat was there; when suddenly there fell upon me without any warning, just as ifit came out of the darkness, a horrible fear of my own existence. Simultaneouslythere arose in my mind the image of an epileptic patient whom I had seen in theasylum, a black-haired youth with greenish skin, entirely idiotic, who used tosit all day on one of the benches, or rather shelves against the wall, with hisknees drawn up under his chin, and the coarse grey undershirt, which was hisonly garment, drawn over them inclosing his entire figure. He sat there like asort of sculptured Egyptian cat or Peruvian mummy, moving nothing but his blackeyes and looking absolutely non-human. This image and my fear entered into aspecies of combination with each other. That shape am I, I felt, potentially.Nothing that I possess can defend me against that fate, if the hour shouldstrike for me as it struck for him. There was such a horror of him, and such aperception of my own merely momentary discrepancy from him, that it was as ifsomething hitherto solid within my breast gave way entirely, and I became a massof quivering fear. After this the universe was changed for me altogether. Iawoke morning after morning with a horrible dread at the pit of my stomach, andwith a general sense of the insecurity of life that I never knew before, andthat I have never felt since. It was like a revelation; and although theimmediate feelings passed away, the experience has made me sympathetic with themorbid feelings of others ever since. It gradually faded, but for months I wasunable to go into the dark alone.In general I dreaded to be left alone. I remember wondering how other peoplecould live, how I myself had ever lived, so unconscious of that pit ofinsecurity beneath the surface of life. My mother in particular, a very cheerfulperson, seemed to me a perfect paradox in her unconsciousness of danger, whichyou may well believe I was very careful not to disturb by revealing my own stateof mind.James's problem was that he had, like the neurasthenic patients, fallen into astate of gloom in which life had 'grown into one tissue of impossibilities', anendless series of hurdles that he lacked the strength to tackle. This sense ofhelplessness, of will-lessness, had sapped his 'vital reserves' until, so tospeak, his inner-resistance gave way - plunging him into a state in whichnothing seemed worth the effort - hence the sudden identification with thegreen-faced patient.He describes how he succeeded in emerging very slowly from this slough ofdespond when he came upon a definition of free will by the French philosopherCharles Renouvier: 'the sustaining of a thought because I choose to when I mighthave other thoughts'. Renouvier had commented that we may feel that all ouractions are mechanical, an automatic response to stimuli, until we consider thefact that we can think one thing rather than another. I can decide what tothink; I can switch my train of thought from one track to another, and back atwill to the first track. I can summon up images of rain, of snow, of Julysunshine, of autumn gales, all merely by willing it.The moment James saw that Renouvier was correct, he began to emerge from hishopeless gloom, and he struggled his way back to the state of intense creativeactivity in which he wrote his classic Principles of Psychology.It is clear that this intellectual conviction that he possessed free will madeall the difference between sickness and health. If he had continued to believehimself a machine, he would have continued to be undermined by misery andself-doubt. It follows that if James had met Gurdjieff at that fateful point inhis life, and accepted his view that we possess virtually no free will, he mightnever have made a complete recovery from his neurasthenia.So it becomes possibleto see what went wrong for Ouspensky after his meeting with Gurdjieff. When hehad finished Tertium Organum in 1911, he had an excited sense of being on theverge of discovering the answer. It was obviously very close, and something todo with maintaining a high level of excitement and 'eagerness'. His friend whocould see 'difference' all the time was obviously near to it.And at this crucial point, Gurdjieff explained to him that the first thing hemust understand was that he could do nothing, plunging him back into somethinglike William James's state of inner paralysis. Ouspensky must have known thiswas nonsense. By pursuing his goal in his own way, he had achieved a great deal.What he needed now was to maintain that high level of drive and optimism thathad inspired Tertium Organum, and that was now inspiring A New Model of theUniverse. But Gurdjieff was an impressive teacher. He seemed to know all theanswers.To begin with, there was self-remembering. This was an exercise that involvedlooking at an object, and making an effort to be aware of yourself looking atit. Anyone can see how difficult this is. Close your eyes and become aware ofyourself. Now open them and look at your watch. Instantly, you cease to be awareof yourself and become aware of your watch. 'You' disappear. With a considerableeffort you can reawaken awareness of yourself as you look at your watch, but ifyou are not careful, you then 'forget' your watch and become aware only ofyourself. (On the other hand, if you concentrate your attention while readingthis book, you will note that you become aware of yourself as well as of thebook.)Ouspensky recognized that all moments of happiness are moments ofself-remembering. What happened on the Sea of Marmora was a flash ofself-remembering. What happened when he sensed the difference between thefactory chimneys and the prison walls was self-remembering. We often experienceself-remembering when setting out on a journey. But if we think about this for amoment we see the reason why. Because we feel relaxed, and we are lookingforward to what is to come, we experience a feeling of eager expectation, thefeeling that the world is a fascinating and delightful place. The same thinghappens if we experience sudden relief when we had been expecting somethingunpleasant to happen - like a man being reprieved from a firing squad. Theanswer lies in that surge of optimism.The American psychologist Abraham Maslow made the same discovery when he studiedhealthy people, and discovered that all healthy people had frequent 'peakexperiences', experiences of sudden overwhelming happiness. Such people weregood 'copers'; they tackled problems in an almost competitive spirit enjoyingthe sensation of overcoming them. Maslow also discovered that when he talked tohis students about peak experiences, they began recalling their own past peakexperiences - many of which they had half forgotten - and they began having peakexperiences all the time. Talking about peak experiences made them feel happyand optimistic, and this feeling was the major step towards having another peakexperience. This is a matter to which we shall return in the final chapter.Maslow's 'copers', then, were in a sense the opposite of the young and romanticOuspensky, with his feeling that life is a trap. They were fundamentally'realistic', and expected to solve problems with enough effort. The same'realism' is also to be found - unexpectedly - in the young Albert Camus afterhe had escaped a 'death sentence' by tuberculosis. Although Camus had concludedthat life is meaningless - he called it 'absurd' - he nevertheless found himselfexperiencing an 'intensity of physical joy' which even produced a kind ofpleasure in 'the absurd'. In an essay in a volume called Nuptials (Noces) hedescribed standing on the beach at Djemila, in Algeria, and experiencing a senseof living reality. Thinking about death, he reflects:I do not want to believe that death opens out onto another life. For me it is aclosed door . . . All the [religious] solutions which are offered to me try totake away from man the weight of his own life. And, watching the heavy flight ofthe great birds in the sky at Djemila, it is exactly a certain weight in my lifethat I ask for and that I receive . . .This is again a description of self-remembering, and Camus makes the importantpoint that it involves a sense of 'the weight of his own life', like a burdenthat he is glad to shoulder, a sense of the real. Or it might be compared to astrong and healthy horse that enjoys pulling a cart, enjoys the feeling of theharness pressing into its chest and shoulders as it exerts its strength.Nietzsche said that happiness is the feeling that obstacles are being overcome,and this is again the secret of the peak experience.Of equal interest in this context is the way that human beings lose their 'senseof the real'. We can see that when William James began to experience anxietyabout his future, and a consequent feeling of depression, it was precisely this'weight of his own life' that he had lost. The harness was hanging looselyaround him, producing a sense of purposelessness. Nietzsche experienced the samething in his teens, particularly after reading Schopenhauer and being convincedthat life is 'absurd'. Simone de Beauvoir writes:I look at myself in a mirror, tell myself my own story, I can never grasp myselfas an entire object. I experience in myself the emptiness that is myself, I feelthat I am not.Thinking too much and having too little purpose usually produces this sense ofemptiness, particularly in the young."},{"pageContent":"ThreeTHE MASTERGeorge Ivanovich Gurdjieff was born on 28 December, 1877, so he was thereforeless than a year older than Ouspensky.[1] He was born in Alexandropol, a Turkishtown which had recently fallen to the Russians in the Russo-Turkish war.Gurdjieff's father was Greek, his mother Armenian. His father was a carpenterwho was also a 'bard' able to recite thousands of verses from memory. WhenGurdjieff saw in a magazine some verses from recently discovered tablets of theEpic of Gilgamesh - the world's earliest literature - he was impressed that theywere exactly as his father recited them; the oral tradition had remainedaccurate over 4,000 years. This led Gurdjieff to the speculation that otherkinds of ancient knowledge might have survived just as long, and inspired him toembark upon the same quest as Ouspensky.Unlike Ouspensky, Gurdjieff spent his childhood surrounded by 'miracles'. Hewitnessed a paralytic crawl to the tomb of a saint and walk away cured. He waspresent when a drought ended suddenly as a procession carrying a miracle-workingicon prayed for rain. He was present at a sÃ©ance when a table rapped out answersto questions with one of its legs. A half-witted fortune-teller accuratelyforetold that he would have an accident with a firearm. He saw a Yezidi boyunable to break out of a circle that children had drawn around him, and in lateryears, it took Gurdjieff and an equally strong friend to drag a Yezidi woman outof such a circle. These were all mysteries to which Gurdjieff's highly activeintelligence demanded an answer.Gurdjieff had a highly developed practical inclination; he could mend almostanything, and at one point made a living weaving carpets. But his earliestinclination was to become a priest. He was always deeply religious; the word'God' came easily to his lips. (Ouspensky, on the other hand, discouraged hisstudents from thinking or talking about religion.) In spite of this, he wascheerfully amoral where money was concerned. As a young man he helped to surveythe proposed route of a railway, and approached the leading men in town orvillages through which the railway was scheduled to pass, offering to 'fix' astation there - for a price.As a teenager, Gurdjieff set out with a friend called Pogossian looking for thesecrets of the 'Sarmoung Brotherhood' which supposedly dated from 2500 bc. Hewent to Smyrna, then to Egypt, Jerusalem and India. In the book in which hedescribes these adventures, Meetings with Remarkable Men, he claims to havespent three months in a monastery in the Himalayas, where - he hinted - he haddiscovered some of the 'secret knowledge' he was looking for.At some point Gurdjieff learned about hypnosis from a teacher called Ekim Bey,and seems to have become a professional hypnotist, even hiring a hall inTashkent to put on a 'magical' show. But he did not accept that hypnotism wasmerely 'suggestion'. He believed that it depends upon accumulating andconcentrating a certain 'life force'. In later life, as we shall see, he oftendemonstrated this hypnotic or 'magical' ability.Gurdjieff differed from Ouspensky in another basic respect: his attitude to sexwas totally unromantic. He boasted to Bennett about the number of hisillegitimate children, and spoke of women 'in terms that would have bettersuited a fanatical Muslim polygamist'. To begin with, Ouspensky seems to havebeen unaware of this aspect of Gurdjieff; when he found out, it seems to havebeen one of the factors that led to the break that lasted the rest of his life.(Gurdjieff's deliberately 'unreasonable' demands were another.)In 1909, in Tashkent, Gurdjieff embarked on his career as a 'teacher', with aheavy emphasis on 'occultism'. Interest in Spiritualism, Theosophy and RudolfSteiner's Anthroposophy was intense, and Gurdjieff was soon regarded as a masterof the occult - although he admits frankly that his reputation was largely theresult of his 'skill in producing tricks'. He also became a highly successfulbusinessman, running stores, restaurants and cinemas, and trading in cattle. By1914, he was ready to realize his ambition of launching an 'institute' in Russia- he chose Russia because it was 'peaceful, rich and quiet'. The 1914 war was tobring these plans to nothing.This, then, was the man Ouspensky met in March 1915: a hypnotist and 'magician'a Casanova (although he was now married to one of the Tsarina'sladies-in-waiting), something of a charlatan, yet basically a man who hadacquired a profound knowledge of human nature.There was one fundamental difference between Gurdjieff and Ouspensky. Gurdjieff,as we have seen, had learned some of the basic tricks of building up hisvitality, and of using this vital power to gain influence over others. Forexample, everyone who met him commented on the penetration of his gaze. He was aman without self-doubt. Ouspensky was an intellectual and a romantic who hadlooked for his solutions in books: books about the fourth dimension, aboutEinstein, about yoga, about mysticism and cosmic consciousness, about theKabbala and the Tarot and psychology. He felt that the question of freedom mustbe approached scientifically - that is, intellectually. He was fascinated byGurdjieff because Gurdjieff seemed to be offering a comprehensive system,something his intellect could get its teeth into. Like all intellectuals, he wasinclined to underestimate the importance of the body and the emotions.In Moscow, Gurdjieff fascinated Ouspensky by the sheer range of his knowledge.When they talked about art, Gurdjieff explained that most of what we call art ismere fantasy and subjectivity. But, he said, there is such a thing as 'objectiveart', which is a kind of mathematics. There are objective works of art - likethe Sphinx - which can be read like books, 'not only with the mind, but with theemotions, if they are sufficiently developed'. He went on to describe a statuewhich he had come across in Central Asia, in the desert at the foot of the HinduKush.At first it produced upon us simply the impression of being a curiosity. Butafter a while we began to feel that this figure contained many things, a big,complete and complex system of cosmology. And slowly, step by step, we began todecipher this system. It was in the body of the figure, in its legs, in itsarms, in its head, in its eyes, in its ears, everywhere. In the whole statuethere was nothing accidental, nothing without meaning. And gradually weunderstood the aim of the people who built this statue. We began to feel theirthoughts, their feelings. Some of us thought that we saw their faces, heardtheir voices. At all events, we grasped the meaning of what they wanted toconvey to us across thousands of years, and not only the meaning, but all thefeelings and the emotions connected with it as well. That indeed was art!As he travelled back to Petrograd from Moscow on the train, Ouspensky askedhimself: is it possible that Gurdjieff actually knew what had to be known inorder to proceed from words or ideas to deeds, to 'facts'? And although he couldnot answer the question positively, he 'had an inner conviction that somethinghad already changed for me and that now everything would go differently'.For readers of Tertium Organum and A New Model of the Universe, the absurdity isthat - as Gurdjieff himself admitted - Ouspensky already 'knew' an enormousamount - perhaps almost as much as Gurdjieff could teach him. This is nowheremore apparent than in the chapter of A New Model of the Universe called'Experimental Mysticism'.Here, Ouspensky describes how, in 1910, he began a series of experiments whoseaim was to explore 'mystical' consciousness. He does not explain how he wentabout it, but a reference to William James's Varieties of Religious Experiencesuggests that he simply used nitrous oxide, 'laughing gas', diluted heavily withair. James had already noted that nitrous oxide can produce a state when 'depthbeyond depth of truth seemed revealed to the inhaler. This truth fades out,however, or escapes at the moment of coming to.'Ouspensky also found himself frustrated by a similar problem:A change in the state of consciousness as a result of my experiments began totake place very soon, much more quickly and easily than I thought. But the chiefdifficulty was that the new state of consciousness which was obtained gave atonce so much that was new and unexpected, and these new and unexpectedexperiences came upon me and flashed by so quickly, that I could not find words,could not find forms of speech, could not find concepts, which would enable meto remember what had occurred even for myself, still less to convey it to anyoneelse.One of his central insights was that:All that we half-consciously construct with regard to the unknown is completelyand utterly wrong. The unknown is unlike anything that we can suppose about it.The complete unexpectedness of everything that is met with in these experiences,from great to small, makes the description of them difficult. First of all,everything is unified, everything is linked together, everything is explained bysomething else and in its turn explains another thing. There is nothingseparate, that is, nothing that can be named or described separately. In orderto describe the first impressions, the first sensations, it is necessary todescribe all at once. The new world with which one comes into contact has nosides, so that it is impossible to describe first one side and then the other.All of it is visible at every point; but how in fact to describe anything inthese conditions - that question I could not answer.William James had arrived at the same conclusions in an essay called 'ASuggestion About Mysticism': that states of mystical intuition may only be verysudden and very great extensions of the ordinary 'field of consciousness'. Inother words, the mystic simply 'sees further', as if he has suddenly become abird and can see into the distance. Naturally, he could not possibly describeall he sees at once; in fact, without a great deal of training, he would find itvery difficult to describe anything at all, just as most of us would find itimpossible to start putting into words the view from an aeroplane.James went on to mention three 'mystical glimpses' that he had experienced, andgoes on:In each of the three like cases, the experience broke in abruptly upon aperfectly commonplace situation and lasted perhaps less than two minutes. In oneinstance I was engaged in conversation, but I doubt whether the interlocutornoticed my abstraction. What happened each time was that I seemed all at once tobe reminded of a past experience; and this reminiscence, ere I could conceive orname it distinctly, developed into something further that belonged with it, thisin turn into something further still, and so on, until the process faded out,leaving me amazed at the sudden vision of increasing ranges of distant fact ofwhich I would give no articulate account. The mode of consciousness wasperceptual, not conceptual - the field expanding so fast that there seemed notime for conception or identification to get in its work. There was a stronglyexciting sense that my knowledge of past (or present?) reality was enlargingpulse by pulse, but so rapidly that my intellectual processes could not keep upthe pace. The content was thus entirely lost to retrospection - it sank into thelimbo into which dreams vanish as we gradually awake. The feeling - I won't callit belief - that I had had a sudden opening, had seen through a window, as itwere, distant realities that incomprehensibly belonged with my own life, was sostrong that I cannot shake it off today.This also makes us aware of Ouspensky's problem as a 'teacher' as well as alearner. The 'vision' expanded 'pulse by pulse' so that his intellect could notkeep pace with it. So, clearly, Ouspensky's intellectual approach to the problemof a wider reality would never work; it would be like trying to cross theAtlantic in a rowing boat.In these 'mystical' states, as on the Sea of Marmora, Ouspensky found that therelation between the 'objective' and the 'subjective' ceased to apply:Here I saw that the objective and the subjective could change places. The onecould become the other. It is very difficult to express this. The habitualmistrust of the subjective disappeared; every thought, every feeling, everyimage, was immediately objectified in real, substantial form which differed inno way from the forms of objective phenomena; and at the same time objectivephenomena somehow disappeared, lost all reality, appeared entirely subjective,fictitious, invented, having no real existence.Ouspensky compares this world to 'a world of very complicated mathematicalrelations':. . . this means a world in which everything is connected, in which nothingexists separately and in which at the same time the relations between thingshave a real existence apart from the things themselves; or possibly, 'things' donot exist and only 'relations' exist.Another writer on mystical experience, R.H. Ward, described (in A Drug-Taker'sNotes) how, under dental gas,I passed, after the first few inhalations . . . directly into a state ofconsciousness already far more complete than the fullest degree of ordinarywaking consciousness [my italics], and that I then passed progressively upwards. . . into finer and finer degrees of this heightened awareness . . . This senseof upward movement continued until it seemed to me that I was rapidly passingthrough what I afterwards told myself was a 'region of ideas.'This is clearly Ouspensky's region of mathematical relations.To speak of relations as 'real' sounds paradoxical (after all, relations canchange from moment to moment), but a little reflection can make the meaningclearer. In fact, we are so accustomed to things being 'connected' that we takeit for granted. When I utter a sentence my 'meaning' is present in my headbefore I begin it, but I recognize that I can only express this meaning in time,by uttering words. I take the 'connectedness' of the words for granted - unlessI am feeling very tired, and I 'forget what I was going to say'. In such amoment we catch a glimpse of the consciousness of James's idiot, staring blanklyat the world, 'seeing' everything yet unable to make the connections which wouldgive it meaning. Meaning is 'connectedness', but not connectedness in time.This, in turn, makes us aware that there is something very unsatisfactory anddull about our 'normal' perception. It 'sticks', like someone trying to plodover a very muddy field in heavy gumboots. We take this 'sticking' for granteduntil we are in moods of happiness and excitement, when we have the 'bird's eyeview' in which we see things related to one another, and realize that our normalperception, in which they are separated from one another like the steps of theman in gumboots, like words in a sentence, is quite misleading.To put it another way, what Ouspensky and James and Ward experienced was a briefglimpse of what 'normality' should be like ('far more complete than the fullestdegree of ordinary consciousness') and that our present 'normality' is quiteabnormal - or rather, sub-normal.So, in effect, Ouspensky was in a state of intense excitement, in whichconsciousness seemed to be flowing faster. Normally, it is as slow and as solidas a glacier; in mystical states, the ice melts and it flows like a river.This also becomes clear from Ouspensky's remark that he found it impossible tocomplete a sentence, because between every word, so many ideas occurred to himthat he was unable to catch up. He began a sentence: 'I said yesterday . . .'No sooner had I pronounced the word 'I' than a number of ideas began to turn inmy head about the meaning of the word, in a philosophical, in a psychologicaland in every other sense. This was all so important, so new and profound, thatwhen I pronounced the word 'said', I could not understand in the least what Imeant by it. Tearing myself away with difficulty from the first cycle ofthoughts about 'I', I passed to the idea 'said', and immediately found in it aninfinite content. The idea of speech, the possibility of expressing thoughts inwords, the past tense of the verb, each of these ideas produced an explosion ofthoughts, conjectures, comparisons and associations. Thus, when I pronounced theword 'yesterday' I was already quite unable to understand why I had said it. Butit in its turn immediately dragged me into the depths of the problems of time,of past, present and future, and before me such possibilities of approach tothese problems began to open up that my breath was taken away.Again, this is all quite logical. When consciousness is 'unfrozen' it ceases tobe 'serial', like the words in a sentence, and becomes 'simultaneous' - that is,turns into a bird's eye view. It is obviously very similar to the state called'inspiration', in which an author or musician has to write at top speed to keepup with his insights.This image makes us aware that human beings are trapped in time, carried alongby it as if on a river. Meanings flash past, like advertisement billboards onthe bank, but it is hard to read them. Yet every time we become 'absorbed',every time we pay total attention to some meaning, we cause time to slow down.This is one of the most interesting things about the human condition: that wepossess this power to 'slow time down'. It implies that, if we wanted to, wecould somehow bring time to a halt and be in the presence of meaning. Ordinarymen take it for granted that they are the slaves of time, and that, like anever-rolling stream, it will carry them into oblivion. Philosophers and mysticsglimpse this possibility that time is not an absolute; if we could learn to useour powers correctly, we could control it.Ouspensky had practical experience of the 'non-absoluteness' of space and time.He describes how, after half an hour of intense discipline, 'I could quiteclearly see the faces of people at a distance at which normally one would havedifficulty in distinguishing one figure from another.' Space had 'telescoped'.On another occasion, he recalled his intention of making a trip to Moscow whenhe was in the midst of his 'experiments':Suddenly, without any warning, I received the comment that I should not go toMoscow at Easter. Why? In answer to this I saw how, starting from the day of theexperiment. . . events began to develop in a definite order and sequence.Nothing new happened. But the causes, which I could see quite well and whichwere there on the day of my experiment, were evolving, and having come to theresults which unavoidably followed from them, they formed just before Easter awhole series of difficulties which in the end prevented me from going to Moscow.The fact in itself . . . had a merely curious character, but the interestingside of it was that I saw what looked like a possibility of calculating thefuture - the whole future was contained in the present. I saw all that hadhappened before Easter resulted directly from what had already existed twomonths earlier.Ouspensky's insight is a direct contradiction of modern 'Chaos Theory', whichasserts that, because of the basic mathematical laws of 'chaos' no physicalprocess (the weather, for example) is predictable for more than a day or twoahead.In mystical states, the normal sense of time, which is 'serial', also vanishes -or rather, Ouspensky says, 'Together with it or within it there appeared as itwere another feeling of time, and two moments or ordinary time, like two wordsof my sentence, could be separated by long periods of another time.' In otherwords, moments of 'serial time' were separated by flashes of 'bird's eye time',extending 'crosswise' like another dimension.We can begin to see why mystics find it so difficult to express what they see.It is not that mystical consciousness is contradictory or illogical. It issimply that 'ordinary consciousness' is based on a set of false suppositionsabout the absoluteness of time, and that the initial problem is to explain whysomething that seems 'common sense' and self-evident is full of misconceptionsand errors. At one point in his experiments, Ouspensky tried hard to summarizehis new insights so he could recall them later, and wrote a sentence on a sheetof paper. When he read what he had written the next day, it was: 'Think in othercategories.' In other words, these insights involved a totally differentapproach to what we call reality, a recognition that most of our premises arewrong.Another long passage that describes this sense of immense richness andmultiplicity has even wider implications. Ouspensky describes sitting on asettee and looking at a copper ash-tray. Again, it aroused 'a whirlwind ofthoughts and images' - where did copper come from, how had it been discovered,how had people learned to work it, how is a modern ash-tray made . . . ? Hetried to express this 'whirlwind' of thoughts on paper, and read the next day:'One could go mad from one ashtray.'But what fascinated him in retrospect was the feeling that 'the ash-tray wasalive', 'that it thought, understood and told me all about itself'. 'Everythingis alive,' I said to myself . . . 'there is nothing dead, it is only we who aredead.'(Another Gurdjieff disciple, C. Daly King, had experienced a similar vision on aNew Jersey railway platform: the bricks of the station 'appeared to betremendously alive . . . seething almost joyously inside and [giving] thedistinct impression that . . . they were living and actively liking if. People,on the other hand, looked dead, really dead'.[1])This led Ouspensky to the recognition that:Everything was living, everything was conscious of itself. Everything spoke tome and could speak to everything. Particularly interesting were the houses andother buildings that I passed, especially the old houses. They were livingthings, full of thoughts, feelings, moods and memories. The people who lived inthem were their thoughts, feelings, moods.(It is interesting to note that Ouspensky later achieved this same sense of the'personality' of houses from doing Gurdjieff's self-remembering exercises. Itshould also be clear that Gurdjieff was describing the same sensation when hespoke of the statue at the foot of the Hindu Kush, and gradually began tounderstand the thoughts and feelings of those who made it until he felt that thestatue was able to 'speak' to him.) Ouspensky goes on:I remember once being struck by an ordinary cab-horse in the Nevsky, by itshead, its face. It expressed the whole being of the horse. Looking at thehorse's face I understood all that could be understood about a horse. All thetraits of horse nature, all of which a horse is capable, all of which it isincapable, all that it can do, all that it cannot do; all this was expressed inthe lines and features of the horse's face. A dog once gave me a similarsensation. At the same time the horse and the dog were not simply horse and dog;they were 'atoms', conscious, living 'atoms' of great beings - 'the great horse'and 'the great dog.' I understood then that we are also atoms of a 'greatbeing', 'the great man.' A glass is an atom of a 'great glass.' A fork is anatom of a 'great fork'.In other words, Ouspensky was seeing Plato's world of ideas as a reality, apoint also made by R.H. Ward: '. . . it seems to me very interesting that oneshould thus, in a dentist's chair and the twentieth century, receive practicalconfirmation of the theories of Plato.' All this was experienced in 'anexceedingly intense emotional state':My attitude towards this new knowledge was in no way indifferent; I either lovedit or was horrified by it, strove towards it or was amazed by it; and it wasthese very emotions, with a thousand others, which gave me the possibility ofunderstanding the nature of the new world I came to know.It is important to note that Ouspensky felt that his method of obtaining theseinsights - through laughing gas - was the wrong way. He says that he felt thatthere was 'somebody who watched me all the time and often tried to persuade meto stop my experiments, not to attempt to go along this path, which was wrongand unlawful from the point of view of certain principles which I at that timefelt and understood only dimly'. The basic principle is, in fact, self-evident.There is no point whatever in having thousands of insights if you cannot hang onto them in some way.J.G. Bennett was to describe a similar experience in the forest at Fontainebleauin 1923, when a tremendous bout of 'super-effort' raised him into the'exceedingly intense emotional stats' in which he was able to evoke feelings atwill:[1]. . . I said to myself: 'I will be astonished.' Instantly I was overwhelmed withamazement . . . Then the thought of fear came to me. At once I was shaking withterror. Unnamed horrors menaced me on every side. I thought of 'joy', and I feltmy heart would burst from rapture. The word 'love' came to me, and I waspervaded with such fine shades of tenderness and compassion that I saw that Ihad not the remotest idea of the depth and the range of love. Love waseverywhere and in everything. It was infinitely adaptable to every shade ofneed. After a time, it became too much for me, it seemed that if I plunged anymore deeply into the mysteries of love, I would cease to exist. [My italics.] Iwanted to be free from this power to feel whatever I chose, and at once it leftme.Bennett goes on to quote Blake's lines:Grown old in love, from seven to seven times sevenI oft have wished for hell for change from heaven,and adds:I realised that for Blake this was no mere trick of words, but the expression ofa real experience. I knew that the world I had entered was one where there is noloneliness, because all who enter into that Eternal Source meet there asbrothers.Bennett's vision of the infinite varieties of love leaves no doubt that he hadentered the same state of 'unfrozen' consciousness as Ouspensky - with a senseof the infinite 'connectedness' of everything - and that he had soon had enoughof it. What is the good of being shown the answer if it promptly escapes us, dueto our inability to capture it in words and concepts? Our job, as Ouspensky wellknew, is to capture 'visions' in words and concepts, so they become permanentlyavailable to all men. The main business of writers is to trap 'meanings' inwords - as if someone had invented a camera to take photographs of theadvertisement signs as they flash past us - so that other men can examine themat leisure. The main point of this exercise is to fill us with courage andcertainty, so we no longer have any doubt about our purpose and direction.Now in fact, it had precisely the opposite effect on Ouspensky:The experiments almost always ended in sleep. During this sleep I passed intothe usual state and awoke in the ordinary world, in the world in which we awakeevery morning. But this world contained something extraordinarily oppressive, itwas incredibly empty, colourless and lifeless. It was as though everything in itwas wooden, as if it was an enormous wooden machine with creaking wooden wheels,wooden thoughts, wooden moods, wooden sensations; everything was terribly slow,scarcely moved, or moved with a melancholy wooden creaking. Everything was dead,soulless, feelingless.They were terrible, these moments of awakening in an unreal world after a realone, in a dead world after a living, in a limited world, cut into small pieces,after an infinite and entire world.But it was Ouspensky's innate romanticism that made this attitude inevitable. Hecould see no advantage in 'frozen' (or as he calls it, 'wooden') consciousness.This is again why Ouspensky felt that it was somehow wrong for him to experimentwith nitrous oxide. He was not yet ready for a glimpse of an 'infinite andentire world', and it only filled him with a longing for a 'land of lostcontent'. He failed to realize that a world 'cut into small pieces' is far moreeasily recorded than an 'infinite and entire world'. So he was unable to graspthe meaning of his extraordinary glimpse of the answer to all his questions.Yet on one level at least, that meaning should have been clear. A 'bird's eyeview' raises us above the materiality of everyday life, and enables us to see itfrom a distance. This is what happens when we study history or philosophy orbecome absorbed in a work of art. They also enable us to contemplate our worldwith a new sense of 'connectedness'. And it is the intellect that enables us totake this 'bird's eye view'. In a sense, therefore, the author of TertiumOrganum and A New Model of the Universe was already on the right path before hemet Gurdjieff, and his later distrust of the 'way of intellect', of 'mereideas', was unjustified.This is something that becomes very clear as we read the rest of A New Model ofthe Universe. The chapter on Experimental Mysticism is followed by a chaptercalled 'In Search of the Miraculous',[1] in which we can sense that Ouspenskywas gradually coming closer to his 'answer'. It is a series of descriptions ofvarious places: Notre Dame, the Pyramids, the Sphinx, the Buddha with sapphireeyes in a temple near Colombo, the Taj Mahal, all of which Ouspensky regards asforms of 'objective art' that can speak directly to human beings. Gurdjieffmight have dismissed these descriptions as mere 'poetry'. But because Ouspenskyis a poet, they convey more than his intellectual speculations. He felt that theBuddha with the sapphire eyes was communicating to him:All the gloom that rose from the depths of my soul seemed to clear up. It was asif the Buddha's face communicated its calm to me. Everything that up to now hadtroubled me and appeared so serious and important, now became small,insignificant, unworthy of notice . . .Ouspensky was beginning to recognize that his problem was that he had neveroutgrown the pessimistic romanticism that pervades Ivan Osokin.Unfortunately, there is a sense in which his chance to outgrow it ended when hemet Gurdjieff. Ouspensky's interpretation of Gurdjieff s teaching was that manpossesses very little freedom - so little that even highly directed effortsseldom achieve their purpose. 'Man can do nothing: he is a machine controlled byexternal influences, not by his own will, which is an illusion,' Ouspensky toldBennett a few years later.There is one basic objection to this, an objection that might be regarded as thecentral point of this book: if it was true, then how is it that Ouspensky wasable to achieve so much before he met Gurdjieff?Clearly, what Ouspensky needed when he returned to Russia in 1914 was to followhis own creative path, to try to pursue the implications of his vision on theSea of Marmora, to try to grasp the significance of the 'difference' he hadsensed as he looked at the Peter and Paul fortress; above all, to understand ofthe 'connectivity' of his nitrous oxide visions. A New Model of the Universe isstill full of that spirit of eagerness and enthusiasm that infuses TertiumOrganum. This applies particularly to the remarkable chapter on the superman. Itis full of statements that seem a flat contradiction of his view that will is anillusion:We have indeed no grounds whatever for denying the possibility of a real, livingsuperman in the past, or in the present, or in the future. At the same time, wemust recognise in our inner world the presence of seeds of something higher thanthat by which we ordinarily live, and we must recognise the possibility of thesprouting of these seeds and their manifestation in forms at presentincomprehensible to us.A few paragraphs later, he expresses an insight that came from his mysticalexperiences:An intellectual approach to the idea of superman is possible only after a verylong and persistent training of the mind. Ability to think is the firstnecessary stage of the initiation . . . What does it mean to be able to think?It means to be able to think differently from the way in which we are accustomedto think, that is to say, to conceive the world in new categories. We havesimplified our conception of the world too much, we have become accustomed topicture it to ourselves as too uniform, and we must learn anew to understand itscomplexity.All this is practically a contradiction of his 'Gurdjieffian approach'. 'We havesimplified our conception of the world too much.' Why? Because we see itrobotically or mechanically, so we have as little idea of reality as a snail hasof the sun, the darkness and the rain. We must learn to 'think in differentcategories', to grasp the difference between things which our 'mechanicalness'irons out. Ouspensky is not telling us that free will is an illusion, that wehave so many 'I's' that thinking is virtually a waste of time - an attitude thatalready plants the seeds of doubt that undermines the 'peak experience', themood of eager expectancy, which is the starting point of achievement. He istelling us that, behind the rather gloomy facade of everyday reality, there areendless reasons for optimism.This becomes even clearer in the final chapter of A New Model of the Universe,entitled 'Sex and Evolution'. Here Ouspensky distinguishes between what he calls'infra-sex', the low form of sexual consciousness in which sex is both 'dirty'and comic, and what he calls 'normal' sex, which is altogether closer to D.H.Lawrence's vision of sex as a transformative force. What Ouspensky hasrecognized is that sexual desire, a man's response to a woman and vice versa, isone of the best examples of the consciousness of 'difference' and that thisdifference is real, not illusory. A man who sees something of the 'eternalfeminine' in a woman is seeing her more truly than a man who merely sees her asan instrument of his own pleasure, or a biological organism for continuing thespecies. Finally there is 'supra-sex', in which we sense that sex is a glimpseof a new consciousness, a higher reality:Mystical sensations undoubtedly and incontestably have a taste of sex . . . Ofall we know in life, only in love is there a taste of the mystical, a taste ofecstasy. Nothing else in our life brings us so near to the limit of humanpossibilities, beyond which begins the unknown.Here again, we have that sense of 'new worlds' which makes Tertium Organum soexciting.All this must be qualified by admitting that it would be inaccurate to say thatOuspensky entirely lost this sense of poetry and excitement when he came underthe influence of Gurdjieff. In fact, to begin with, he obviously found Gurdjieffs ideas the most exciting he had so far encountered. Yet as we study hisexposition of these ideas in In Search of the Miraculous, we can also begin tosee how the original excitement turned into something much more down to earth,'scientific', and how this scientific approach slowly gave way to the pessimismof his comment that 'there is only one hope - that we should find the way tofind the way to work with the higher emotional centre. And we do not know howthis is to be done.'Yet when we turn from A New Model of the Universe to Ouspensky's account of hismeeting with Gurdjieff in In Search of the Miraculous, it is possible tounderstand that original excitement. At one of their earnest meetings, Ouspenskyasked Gurdjieff about his ballet The Struggle of the Magicians. This is, infact, a pleasant little love story about a wealthy man who tries to seduce thepupil of a white magician by enlisting the help of a black magician; the whitemagician foils his plans, but the rich man finally becomes his disciple, and theballet ends with the suggestion that love will triumph in the end. Gurdjieffexplained that the most important part of the ballet was its dances, then wenton to compare them to the movements of an orrery - a device simulating themovements of the planets. In the same way, he explained, in 'sacred dances', themovements are intended to remind those who understand them of certain hiddenlaws of nature. Such mysterious hints were guaranteed to fascinate Ouspensky. Itwas the same when Gurdjieff began to talk about what he called 'the ray ofcreation' - the sun, the planets and the moon - and to explain that they areliving beings, and that the moon is a planet in the process of birth, which mayevolve to the same level as the earth. Gurdjieff was later to explain that theuniverse has seven levels of reality, and that the moon is the lowest of these;those who live on that level are subject to 96 laws. Man, who lives on the earthlevel, is subject to 48 laws. And so on up the 'ray of creation: the planets,the sun, the galaxy, the totality of worlds, the absolute, each being subject tohalf as many laws as the previous level, until we reach the absolute, which issubject only to its own law . . .' All this seemed to Ouspensky to reveal thatGurdjieff was the repository of the kind of secret knowledge that he had spenthis life searching for.Even so, much of what Gurdjieff had to say only reinforced Ouspensky's romanticpessimism. For example, when they sat in a noisy cafÃ© speaking about the war(Gurdjieff deliberately chose such places to force Ouspensky to make 'extraeffort'), Gurdjieff explained that war was the result of planetary influences.When two planets approached too closely to one another, the result was a kind oftension, such as the tension one might feel when passing too close to someone ona narrow pavement. Ouspensky asked: 'Then is there absolutely nothing that canbe done?', and Gurdjieff replied gloomily:'Absolutely nothing.'Not all Gurdjieff's pronouncements were quite so negative. He explained, forexample, that man is in prison, and that it is possible to dig a tunnel tofreedom - but that one man alone can do nothing. The tunnel can only becompleted by a group working together:Furthermore, no one can escape from prison without the help of those who haveescaped before. Only they can say in what way escape is possible, or can sendtools, files or whatever may be necessary. But one prisoner alone cannot findthese people or get into touch with them. An organisation is necessary. Nothingcan be achieved without an organisation.For a loner like Ouspensky, such a notion was a violation of his deepestinstinct: the feeling that a man can find his own salvation, but not that ofothers. At the very end of his life he was to return to this belief.On another occasion, Gurdjieff told his pupils the grim little parable of themagician and the sheep. A magician gets tired of the wanderings of his sheep,who were aware that they were due to be slaughtered and skinned. So hehypnotizes them and tells them that they are immortal and no harm can come tothem. He also tells them that he is a good master who loves his flock. Finally,he suggests that they are not sheep at all; some he convinces that they arelions, others eagles, others men, others even magicians . . . And so the sheepstayed quietly at home until it was time for them to be slaughtered . . . This,explained Gurdjieff, 'is a very good illustration of man's position.'As he absorbed such notions, Ouspensky must have felt that all the insights andglimpses of Tertium Organum and A New Model of the Universe were illusory, andit says a great deal for his stubborn self-belief that he still went on tocomplete and publish A New Model of the Universe.The real problem, of course, was that Gurdjieff and Ouspensky were completelydifferent types. Ouspensky was the intellectual romantic; Gurdjieff was the manof action. There is a sense in which Ouspensky was totally unsuited to puttingGurdjieff's method into practice. Gurdjieff's fundamental insight was the sameas William James's: that it is 'some unusual idea of necessity' that inducespeople to make the extra efforts of will that 'carry them over the dam'. Most ofus are aware that we actually need physical experience to relax and expandconsciousness - experience such as travel, exercise, love-making, socializing,even eating and drinking. So Gurdjieff never lost sight of the importance ofphysical effort. He treated all his disciples as 'neurasthenics' who needed the'bullying treatment', or as people suffering from snakebite who need to beforced to walk up and down to keep them awake.Ouspensky, however, was simply not the type to appreciate the 'bullyingtreatment'. He had already glimpsed the mystical world of total 'connectivity',William James's 'distant horizons of fact'. His most powerful desire was toestablish contact with the higher centres, so he could continue to make foraysinto these unknown realms, and learn more of their geography. Gurdjieff was ableto teach him many interesting techniques - involving complex physical movements,strenuous exercise, and breathing exercises - but these failed to achieve theresults Ouspensky hoped for. Yet in abandoning his own work in favour ofGurdjieff's, he had also turned his back upon his own peculiar genius."},{"pageContent":"FourCREATING 'MAN NUMBER FOUR'Still it would be grossly unfair to Gurdjieff to imply that Ouspensky wasfascinated solely by his hints about hidden knowledge and 'sacred mysteries'.Ouspensky was 'hooked' because he was an intellectual, and Gurdjieff's ideasformed a powerful and consistent intellectual system. Let us, before we go anyfurther, look more closely at this system.Human beings, says Gurdjieff, 'grow up' to a certain point, and then stop. Up tothat point they are 'subsidized' by nature. But further growth can only bebrought about by immense personal effort. When one of Gurdjieff's later pupilswas asked to define the aim of 'the Work', she replied: 'To prevent your pastfrom becoming your future.'This notion is obviously common to all religious disciplines, whose aim is'spiritual growth'. So is the notion of strenuous effort to obtain this growth -saints flogging themselves with whips, yogis sleeping on beds of nails orsitting cross-legged in the same position for weeks at a time. Where Gurdjieffdiffers is in his far more pragmatic approach. In order to obtain a certainresult, he says, it is necessary to know precisely what you want to obtain.Saints and ascetics have so far recognized three ways: the way of the fakir, theway of the monk, and the way of the yogi. The way of the fakir is the way ofphysical control, the attempt to dominate the body by will-power. The way of themonk is the way of faith and religious emotion; by attempting to dominatefeelings. The way of the yogi is the way of the mind; aiming to gain totalcontrol of the mind. But there is a 'Fourth Way', which Gurdjieff calls the wayof the 'sly man' but which might equally well be translated as 'intelligentman'. This is the attempt to approach the problem of personal evolution throughintelligent understanding, and it combines all three previous ways. Ouspensky'sexperiments with nitrous oxide might be regarded as an example of the FourthWay: he was trying to take a short cut to a certain kind of knowledge, and hisattempt was partially successful.Closely connected with this notion of the four ways is Gurdjieff's assertion ofthe four aspects of man, which he compared to a carriage, a horse, a driver andthe owner of the carriage. The carriage is the physical body, the horse is thefeelings and desires, the driver is the mind, and the owner is the higher self -the part that Gurdjieff was trying to bring into being through the Work. Theenergies used by these four are in an ascending ladder of refinement, thephysical being the coarsest and the 'owner's' the highest. Our task is totransmute these various energies into higher levels.But the heart of Gurdjieff's 'System' lies in his distinction between 'essence'and 'personality'. Personality is the part of us that we develop to enable us tocope with the world - a kind of defence system. The underlying reality, theinner self - the part the Work is designed to develop - is our essence.Typically, Gurdjieff explained that one of the few men of essence he had met wasa Corsican brigand, who had developed it by spending days in the hot sun,peering down the sights of his rifle, waiting for travellers to rob.Personality encloses us like a shell. We like to believe that inside that shellis our 'true self', the 'real me'. In fact, says Guidjieff, we are full ofthousands of little 'I's. They could be compared to the crystalline fragmentsthat a windscreen shatters into when struck with a hammer. But every time wemake some tremendous effort, two of the crystals fuse together. If we could makeenough efforts, we would finally obtain one solid block of crystal. If thatcould happen, man would be virtually a god.Our aim, then, is to make the kind of effort that will create enough 'friction'to fuse two crystals together. These efforts Gurdjieff calls 'intentionalsuffering'. This does not mean flogging ourselves or seeking out misery, butsimply making efforts of will instead of drifting along in a robotic ormechanical state.Self-remembering is a form of 'intentional suffering'. It should be noted thatself-remembering does not necessarily entail the strenuous effort of looking atyour watch and trying to be aware of yourself looking at it. It merely meansmaintaining alertness. At the end of The Struggle of the Magicians, the whitemagician prays: 'Lord Creator, and all you, His Assistants, help us to be ableto remember ourselves at all times in order that we may avoid involuntaryactions, as only through them can evil manifest itself.' This clearly meansvigilance and alertness. Thomas de Hartmann tells how self-remembering oncesaved his life. Gurdjieff's words 'Remember yourself meant very little to him.But when he was acting as a dispatch rider, and a shell blew him off his horse,he refused to panic, but kept repeating: 'I remember myself.' Keeping his head,he caught his horse and rode off, while shells continued to fall around him. Itcan be seen that, in this case, self-remembering simply meant maintaining selfcontrol. (As an interesting footnote to all this, we may observe that when wesucceed in maintaining states of self-remembering, one odd consequence is oftenthe occurrence of what Jung called 'synchronicities' absurd 'coincidences' thatseem to be somehow designed to show us that we are on the right track.)According to Gurdjieff, our central problem is that we are so 'mechanical' thatwe slip into robotic states without even noticing. Emergencies or crises wake usup. If we could devise some form of 'alarm clock', this would solve the problem- which is undoubtedly why some people seem to cause themselves problems andcrises. Gurdjieff's solution was to form groups; then the members couldco-operate in keeping one another awake. In general, Gurdjieff's Work consistedin a series of disciplines designed to keep his pupils in a high state ofself-awareness.There is another aspect of the teaching that explains the deep impression itmade on the pupils: Gurdjieff's 'cosmology'. We have already touched upon thisin speaking of Gurdjieff s teaching on the 'planets' and the 'ray of creation'.Everything in the universe is subject to two laws: the Law of Three and the Lawof Seven. We are inclined to think in terms of two forces: positive andnegative, darkness and light. Gurdjieff insisted that there is always a third, aneutralizing or reconciling force (he later spoke of Holy Affirming, HolyDenying, and Holy Reconciling). In the Work, the first force is man's desire tochange, the second is his laziness and inertia, the third is the new knowledgethat can bring about the change. Even the Absolute is composed of three forces,which is why the next level down from it, called the totality of all worlds, issubject to three laws. If human beings live passively, making no attempt tocreate 'essence', when they die they collapse to the very lowest level - themoon - and become 'food for the moon', subject to 96 laws and almost incapableof freedom.The Law of Seven concerns the energies of the vibrations of the universe, and isobviously connected with the seven levels of the 'ray of creation' (moon, earth,planet, sun, solar system, totality of worlds and Absolute - these, of course,should not be regarded literally as the moon, the earth, and so on, but aslevels of being). Gurdjieff explained that the basic vibrations of the universecan be understood by studying the seven musical notes of the tonic scale. Thereare, he said, two 'weak points' in the scale, between mi and fa, and between tiand doh, and these are the two points where, in actuality, vibrations slow down.These breaks in the scale mean that when we set out to do something, we quiteunconsciously change direction at these two points - without even noticing it -and may even end by doing the opposite of what we set out to do. The solution isto apply 'reinforcements' at these two points, and so keep the energies movingin a straight line, so to speak. So, according to Gurdjieff, all attempts totransform oneself will be wasted without some knowledge of the Law of Seven.Gurdjieff also laid enormous emphasis on a figure he called the Enneagram: acircle with a triangle in it and each side of the triangle subdivided into twomore points. The Enneagram, he said, was a symbol of his whole cosmology,showing the basic laws of the universe. The nine vertices symbolize the sevennotes of the octave and the two 'breaks' (although in the Enneagram the breakbetween ti and doh does not seem to be in the right place).If man is to progress smoothly up the octave of evolution, he needs 'shocks' tohelp him over the breaks. It is the teacher's job, said Gurdjieff, to administersuch shocks, and this obviously explains why he gave his pupils such a hardtime.We can now at least begin to see why Gurdjieff's teaching left his pupils insuch a state of excitement. It all seemed to make practical sense, yet itoffered a method of 'salvation' that gave it a religious dimension. This is whyOuspensky, like the rest, felt that he had finally received the 'revelation' hehad been searching for all his life. Gurdjieff's System provided a practicalmethod of pursuing the aims that he had always explored in a vague anduncoordinated manner. It offered a way of turning his life into a continuouseffort to pursue the insights of his nitrous oxide experiences - a way that hecould now feel was entirely 'lawful'.But with the benefit of hindsight, we can see certain things that were notapparent to Ouspensky. The most important of these is that Gurdjieffdeliberately exaggerated problems to galvanize his pupils into maximum effort.So, for example, when Ouspensky asked about life after death, Gurdjieff repliedthat most people are so mechanical that there is nothing in them that cansurvive death. Only when a man has created some degree of 'essence' is theresomething that can 'survive'. The 'astral body' is not something everybodypossesses; it has to be created by strenuous effort and 'friction'. Yet atanother time, Gurdjieff told Ouspensky that objects belonging to a dead personcontain 'traces' of that person, which enable those still living to maintaincontact. And Bennett tells the strange story of how, after he had lost hismother, Gurdjieff had remarked: 'She is in need of help because she cannot findher way by herself. My own mother is already free and can help her.' He thentaught Bennett strenuous visualization exercises that finally - after agonizingeffort - succeeded in 'summoning' the presences of Gurdjieff's mother and hisown. Both stories seem to indicate an unqualified acceptance of life afterdeath.There was also exaggeration in Gurdjieff's assertion that most people aremachines who possess no freedom whatever. The title of the third volume of his'testament', All and Everything, is Life is Real Only Then, When 'I Am', and itis clear that we all experience the feeling that 'life is real' in all momentsof happiness and excitement. In other words, we all experience the 'I am'feeling a thousand times. It does not require strenuous effort. Gurdjieff isagain exaggerating to keep his pupils 'up to the mark'.Let us try to reformulate Gurdjieff's basic insights without the exaggeration.Human beings are largely machines. The heart is a pump, the brain is a computer,the joints are levers. And we have achieved our supremacy as the leading specieson earth because of the sheer complexity of our mechanism. We all possess a'robot' who does things for us. When I learn something new - to drive a car, tospeak a foreign language - I have to do it painfully and consciously, step bystep; then my 'robot' takes over and does it for me. The human robot has learnedto handle a complexity of experience that would drive any other animal tonervous breakdown.Our problem is that such complexity tends to be self-defeating - like owning alibrary so huge that even the catalogue is a library in itself.One might say that human beings are 50 per cent 'robot' and 50 per cent 'realperson'. When we are happy and excited, the proportion changes: we become 49 percent 'robot' and 51 per cent 'real'. These are the moods of 'holidayconsciousness' in which we feel happy and wide awake - the moods of 'I am'. Inour ordinary daily activities we are roughly 50/50. But as soon as we becometired, we become 51 per cent 'robot' and 49 per cent 'real person'.Human beings could be compared to motor cars whose batteries recharge as theydrive. If a car is left standing in a garage for months, its batteries get flat.Humans have an additional problem: when they do things 'mechanically', they alsofail to recharge their vital batteries. It is only when we are driven by a senseof purpose and optimism that we recharge our batteries. Abraham Maslow describeda case of a female patient who was so bored with her job in a factory that shebecame completely devitalized, even ceasing to menstruate. When Maslow learnedthat she had hoped to make a career in sociology, but had been forced to takethe factory job to support her family, he advised her to study sociology atnight school. As soon as she did this, the symptoms disappeared. Her sense ofpurpose was now recharging her batteries. The 'peak experience' could beregarded as a kind of spontaneous discharge of a highly charged battery, a sparkof sheer joy.Now in recognizing that our main problem is that we are too 'robotic', Gurdjieffcould see that the basic necessity is to instil into people a high level ofpurpose. The robot causes us to go 'slack' so that our response to life becomessluggish and dull. At best we experience the 50/50 state. At worst, we spendmost of our time in a 51 per cent robot-state. And this tends to cause boredomand discouragement, so that problems plunge us into depression - which could beregarded as 52 per cent robot. The more robotic we become, the harder it is toescape, for our low vitality prevents us from making the effort required. Suchstates are extremely dangerous, for we can fall into a condition of permanentpassivity, merely 'reacting' to life. In these states we become deeplyvulnerable, physically as well as emotionally. A California psychiatrist, Wilsonvan Dusen, has described how long-term mental patients can become totallypassive, staring at a television set all day, and continuing to stare even whenit is turned off. This is an excellent image of what is wrong with humanconsciousness. And long-term passivity can produce physical as well as mentalillness.This explains why Gurdjieff felt justified in 'exaggerating'. And if a personcan be galvanized into a sense of urgency, surely that is all that matters?But we have seen that one problem of exaggerating man's mechanicalness is thatit tends to produce a grim and negative state of mind. Gurdjieff told Ouspensky:'One need not . . . be afraid of efforts; the danger of dying from them is notall that great. It is much easier to die from inaction, from laziness, and fromthe fear of making efforts' But, as we shall see, Gurdjieff's critics haveaccused him of being a bully who drove some of his followers into illness, andeven - in one well-known case, the writer Katherine Mansfield - into death.A year after meeting Gurdjieff, Ouspensky began to feel that he was at lastbeginning to understand the Work. On first meeting the Moscow pupils, he feltthat they were artificial, as if playing a role; by the summer of 1916 he sawthat this was because they were maintaining a high level of self-observation.Gurdjieff, he noticed, also observed them closely, and placed them in newsituations where they would cease to behave formally - for example, taking themon excursions into the countryside or a trip up the Neva. Later on, in Paris, hewould organize large dinner parties for the same reason, and force everyone todrink toast after toast in vodka until they were all drunk. He explained toOuspensky: 'Later on you will see that everyone in the Work is given his ownindividual tasks corresponding to his type, and his chief feature or his chieffault, that is, something that will give him the opportunity of struggling moreintensively against his chief faults.'The task he gave Ouspensky was to act as a kind of propagandist, to lead hisacquaintances into conversations about the Work. When the whole group wasinstructed to talk to their acquaintances about the Work, the results made themaware of how difficult it is to communicate meaningfully, even with intelligentpeople. (Ouspensky was later to go to the opposite extreme and order hisfollowers not to discuss the Work with anyone outside it.)At other meetings, Gurdjieff tried the experiment of asking his pupils to talkabout themselves and their lives. This was also a failure; it turned into anexercise in anecdote that bored everybody. But Ouspensky realized somethinginteresting: that when he began to speak, there were many things that he had nointention of divulging.On another occasion, Ouspensky was in a gloomy mood and complained to Gurdjieffthat he felt they were getting nowhere. To cheer him up, Gurdjieff offered toanswer any question. Ouspensky asked about the truth of 'Eternal Recurrence',and Gurdjieff replied - perhaps predictably - that Eternal Recurrence is areality, but that work on oneself can nevertheless alter a man's possibilities.This was a view that Ouspensky incorporated into a revised version of IvanOsokin (the early version had ended on a totally pessimistic note).Ouspensky was galvanized to new efforts. He began short but intensive fastswithout worrying about their effect on his health, as well as practisingbreathing and concentration exercises. Gurdjieff invited a small group of hispupils to a house in Finland - not far from Petrograd - and was unusually harshand sarcastic, as if trying to provoke them. He certainly upset Ouspensky whenhe repeated in front of everyone something unflattering about one of theirnumber which Ouspensky had told him in the greatest confidence.Here we encounter the essence of the problem that finally caused the breakbetween the two men. Ouspensky was, of course, fully aware that Gurdjieff wasattempting to galvanize them into effort, like an experienced drill sergeant,and that a man who wishes to become a good soldier does not quarrel with thedrill sergeant. Yet he must also have been aware that he possessed his owngenius, and that he already knew a great deal even before he met Gurdjieff. Sohe felt that Gurdjieff was going too far in repeating a confidence. Was hecorrect? The question is of fundamental importance. Was Gurdjieffunderestimating Ouspensky's 'freedom'? If so, then Gurdjieff himself was capableof misjudgement, even of a kind of stupidity. Ouspensky himself later decidedthat the answer to that question was yes. Those who regard Ouspensky as a man ofgenius in his own right will agree.Almost as if to apologize for his 'bullying' treatment, Gurdjieff now allowedOuspensky an experience of his 'magical' powers. One evening in Finland,Gurdjieff called three of his pupils into a room, and proceeded to show themcertain postures and physical exercises. Gurdjieff always laid great emphasis onphysical movements as training for man's 'moving centre'. Anyone who wishes totry out their effect should make an attempt to pat himself on the head with onehand while rubbing his stomach with the other. Gurdjieff's 'movements' ofteninvolved doing something different with both hands, both feet, and the head. Onthis occasion, Ouspensky was impressed by the precision of Gurdjieff'smovements. After this, Gurdjieff began to discuss why they could not tell thestory of their lives:And with this the miracle began.I can say with complete assurance that Gurdjieff did not use any kind ofexternal methods, that is, he gave me no narcotics nor did he hypnotise me byany of the known methods.It all started with my beginning to hear his thoughts . . . Suddenly I noticedthat among the words which he was saying to us all there were 'thoughts' whichwere intended for me. I caught one of these thoughts and replied to it, byspeaking aloud in the ordinary way. Gurdjieff nodded at me and stopped speaking.There was a fairly long pause. He sat still saying nothing. After a while Iheard his voice inside me as it were in my chest, near the heart. He put adefinite question to me . . . I answered him in the affirmative. . . And he atonce put another still more definite question to me in the same way . . . Andagain I answered in the same way. Z and S [Zaharoff and Stoerneval] were visiblyastonished . . . This conversation . . . proceeded in this fashion for not lessthan half an hour.Back with the others, Gurdjieff made some remark about Ouspensky that droveOuspensky to walk out in the woods. Suddenly, he saw that Gurdjieff was right:. . . what I had considered to be firm and reliable inside myself . . . did notexist. But I had found something else. I knew that he would not believe me andthat he would laugh at me if I showed him this other thing. But for myself itwas indubitable, and what happened later showed that I was right.This is an interesting passage because it reveals something that Ouspenskyprefers not say openly: that Gurdjieff taunted him about his weakness and hisromanticism. This is something that Ouspensky takes care not to reveal in allhis work; yet it remains, as Gurdjieff would have said, his 'chief feature'.We can also see that, if Ouspensky was right in feeling that he had discoveredanother source of strength within himself, the implication must be thatGurdjieff himself was not infallible; his psychological insight was limited, andthere were things about Ouspensky that he discounted and failed to understand.Back in his own room, Gurdjieff again began to speak 'inside [Ouspensky's]chest', and they held a conversation while Gurdjieff was out on the veranda withothers. Ouspensky is again reticent, but it is clear that Gurdjieff was tryingto force him to make some promise, or to leave the Work. He gave Ouspensky amonth to make up his mind.The next morning, at breakfast, Gurdjieff again read Ouspensky's mind, andadvised him to stop thinking about a certain question. During the next few days,Ouspensky found himself in a strange emotional state, so that he remarked toGurdjieff: 'How can this be got rid of? I cannot bear it any more.' Gurdjieff'sreply was that this was what Ouspensky had been asking for. He was now awake.Ouspensky comments that he is not certain that this was entirely true.Back in Petrograd, Ouspensky not only continued to converse with Gurdjieff - whowas on the train going to Moscow - but to actually see him.At this time, he says, he also began seeing 'sleeping people'. As he walkedalong the street, he would see that people were actually asleep, surrounded bytheir dreams in the form of clouds. When this impression began to fade, he foundhe could renew it by efforts of self-remembering.All this convinced Ouspensky that 'paranormal' powers are a by-product of higherstates of awareness, and that therefore they cannot be studied 'objectively', asif in a laboratory. The mind needs to be 'awake' first.In fact, as we have seen, Ouspensky had already made the same discovery duringhis nitrous oxide experiments. He had 'heard voices' which were sometimes ableto reply accurately to his questions, and had also correctly foreseen theprecise events that would cause the trip to Moscow to be cancelled. Ouspenskyadds that this higher state of awareness also made him see, with great clarity,why violence is always bound to be counter-productive. This recognition, hesays, was not 'ethical', but practical.Soon after this, Gurdjieff announced to the group that they all had to make achoice: now they must decide whether they wanted to wake up, or remain asleep.'In future I shall work only with those who can be useful to me in attaining myaim.' Two people dropped out of the group. It seems clear that what Gurdjieffwas demanding of Ouspensky in Finland was total commitment - perhaps to devotehis life to spreading the idea of the Work. Ouspensky seems to have agreed.It may have been Gurdjieff's recognition of what was happening in Russia thatcaused him to make these demands. The war was going badly; troops were fightingwithout weapons and without proper clothing. In an offensive that ran out ofsteam, the Russians lost a million men. The army was demoralized. Many peoplebelieved the Tsarina - who was of German birth - wanted the Germans to win. Atthe end of 1916, the Tsar's eminence grise Rasputin was assassinated by PrinceFelix Yussupov; he had foretold that if he was killed by a member of thearistocracy, the Russian monarchy would come to an end. In March 1917, riots andstrikes broke out in Petrograd, and there was a general mutiny of troops. TheTsar abdicated, and a provisional government took control, while the royalfamily was placed under arrest. In April, Lenin arrived from Switzerland, sentby the Germans to undermine Russia. In July, the Bolsheviks made their firstattempt to seize power.In February, Gurdjieff had made his last visit to Petrograd; when he took hisleave of his followers at the station, Ouspensky felt that something unusual hadtaken place. On the platform, Gurdjieff had seemed 'an ordinary man, like anyoneelse'. Moments later, when he came to the window of the train, he seemed quitedifferent, 'a man of a quite different order . . . with a quite exceptionalimportance and dignity in every look and movement, as though he had suddenlybecome a ruling prince or statesman of some unknown kingdom . . .'It is possible of course, that Gurdjieff was 'acting' again; most people whoknew him felt that he wore a series of masks. But it seems more probable thatOuspensky and the others had witnessed a genuine transformation. This is whatGurdjieff had meant when he said, 'In future I shall only work with those whocan be useful in attaining my aim.' He did not state his aim, but it can havebeen only one thing: he was using his group, and the consciousness induced byteaching them, to raise himself into a higher state of intensity. Ouspenskylater observed that teaching other people had the effect of teaching himself. Itseems probable that what they witnessed at Petrograd station was the moment inwhich Gurdjieff achieved his 'transformation' to a more conscious level ofpower. A journalist who travelled in the same carriage as Gurdjieff wasconvinced that he was, at the very least, a millionaire oil magnate.And now, before we accompany Gurdjieff and Ouspensky on the flight that willtake them into exile, it is time to pause to look back over what had happenedsince their meeting two years earlier.It seems clear that when Gurdjieff left Tashkent and embarked on his career as ateacher in Moscow and St Petersburg, his teaching was still in an undevelopedform. He had almost certainly learnt his 'cosmology' - the 'ray of creation' -from monks or holy men in Central Asia or the Himalayas, and may have arrived athis conclusion that man is 'asleep' from painful personal experience. In theessay 'Glimpses of Truth' which Ouspensky had heard read aloud when he first metGurdjieff's Moscow pupils, the emphasis is all on the Law of Three and onGurdjieff's cosmology.There seems no doubt that Gurdjieff deliberately set out to 'catch' Ouspensky.He admitted that when Ouspensky left on his trip to India and Ceylon, heinstructed his pupils to carefully read his articles to determine what sort ofman he was. The detailed care with which he answered questions in their earlytalks reveals how far he was determined to interest Ouspensky - who was by thena well-known lecturer and author. Gurdjieff wanted to become known, and the bestway was to interest men who were already known - Thomas de Hartmann, who wasalready famous as a ballet composer, was another example.But for most of the two years after he met Ouspensky, Gurdjieff simply talked.He also planned to present his ballet The Struggle of the Magicians, which wasfull of 'sacred dances'. But he had not yet developed the 'exercises' andmethods that became the basic part of the Work after he left Russia. Ouspenskydescribes how they were introduced to the famous 'Stop!' exercise at Essentukiin 1917: Gurdjieff would shout 'Stop!' and everyone had to freeze, no matterwhat he was doing. (One man got his fingers severely blistered on a glass ofboiling tea.) Gurdjieff explained that this exercise was considered sacred in'schools' but it seems equally likely that he had just invented it. If not, whyhad he not mentioned it during the past seven years, since his teaching careerbegan? There can also be no doubt that his aim, in part at least, was to becomea famous teacher. With new pupils, he insisted on total secrecy - they were notallowed to discuss the Work with anyone who was not part of it. Yet whenOuspensky declined to make such a promise, Gurdjieff gave way. And in lateryears, when Ouspensky had written down his early experiences with Gurdjieff in'Fragments of an Unknown Teaching',[1] Gurdjieff read it and approved. He wasnot a charlatan, a man who wanted fame for its own sake. But he certainly didwant fame. So it is important to realize that, although Gurdjieff struck hisdisciples as a superbeing, he developed, like anyone else, by a slow learningprocess.The next three years were to see this learning process accelerated. As theRevolution began, Gurdjieff recognized that it would no longer be possible towork in Russia. He sent Ouspensky a postcard saying that he was going back home,to Alexandropol. Ouspensky and the Petrograd group had already decided to leave,so when Gurdjieff invited Ouspensky to join him, he took a train for theCaucasus. In Tiflis (now Tbilisi), the capital of Georgia, drunken soldiers heldmeetings on the platform all night, and three were shot - one for theft, thesecond because he was mistaken for the first, and the third because he wasmistaken for the second. In Alexandropol, Ouspensky met Gurdjieff's family, andsaw a photograph of Gurdjieff that revealed 'with undoubted accuracy what hisprofession had been at the time it was made' - he adds that, since this was hisown discovery, he will keep it to himself. The photograph was the one thatshowed Gurdjieff as a stage hypnotist. Ouspensky seems to have tried to keepthis aspect of Gurdjieff a secret, possibly because he believed Gurdjieff usedit for sexual purposes. (Gurdjieff was later to reveal his former profession inhis book Herald of Coming Good, published in 1933.)Ouspensky was impressed by Gurdjieff's filial respect for his father and mother- the father was over 80 - Gurdjieff listened to his father's conversation forhours on end, stimulating him with questions.After two weeks they decided to return to Petrograd. But at Tiflis they met ageneral who had been one of Gurdjieff's pupils and what he told Gurdjieff madethe latter change his mind about returning. He left Ouspensky to go on alone.But before that happened, an interesting conversation took place. When Ouspenskyasked how he could strengthen his 'I', Gurdjieff told him that he should alreadybe feeling his 'I' differently. Ouspensky had to admit that he felt exactly thesame as usual. But two years later he was to experience this sense of a'controlling ego', the 'owner' of the horse and carriage, and to know that hisyears with Gurdjieff had borne fruit after all. 'Man number four' had come intobeing.In Moscow and Petrograd, Ouspensky passed on to Gurdjieff's students the messagethat they should join him in the Caucasus. When he returned, Gurdjieff had movedto Essentuki - not far away - and finally a group of 12 foregathered there. Itincluded Ouspensky's wife and step-daughter, Thomas de Hartmann and his wifeOlga, and a pupil called Zaharoff.Here, during the next six weeks, Gurdjieff introduced them to the 'Stop!'exercise, and to the idea of 'super-effort' - deliberately pushing yourselffurther when tired. It seems to have been at this point in his career thatGurdjieff began to introduce the strenuous physical exercises that became such acentral part of his method. A typical one is described by Ouspensky: sitting onthe floor with knees bent and palms close together between the feet, the pupilhad to lift one leg and count up to ten, saying 'Om' instead of using numbers,then up to nine, then up to eight, and so on, down to one, then start repeatingit all backwards, meanwhile 'sensing' his right eye. Then he had to separate thethumb and 'sense' his left ear. And so on. When this exercise was mastered, thepupils had to add breathing exercises to it, and after that, still more'complications' were introduced. In addition to this, they were all made tofast. And in spite of physical weakness, they were made to run for miles in theheat, stand with extended arms, or mark time at the double. All these, Gurdjieffexplained, were merely 'preliminary' exercises.But it was during these exercises that Ouspensky had his one experience of'higher consciousness'. In a room alone, he began to mark time at the doublewhile performing breathing exercises. As he was pouring with sweat and his headwas spinning, 'suddenly something seemed to crack or move inside me and mybreathing went on evenly and properly at the rate I wanted it to.'I shut my eyes and continued to mark time, breathing easily and freely, andfeeling exactly as though strength was increasing in me and that I was gettinglighter and stronger. I thought that if I could continue to run in this way fora certain time I should get still more interesting results because waves of ajoyful trembling had already begun to go through my body which, as I knew fromprevious experiments, preceded what I called the opening of the innerconsciousness. But at this moment someone came into the room and I stopped.Ouspensky says that this taught him that an exercise can be transferred from themind to the 'moving centre'. This clearly has much in common with WilliamJames's 'second wind' and with Bennett's experience at Fontainebleau (see p.55),when the 'breakthrough' was again achieved by strenuous and agonizing physicaleffort.All at once, just as the pupils were beginning to feel that they were at lastachieving something significant, Gurdjieff shocked them all by announcing thathe was dropping the Work, and going to Tuapse, on the Black Sea coast. Ouspenskysays that this was the moment when his faith in Gurdjieff first began to waver.It all seemed so pointless. He went to Tuapse with Gurdjieff, then decided toreturn Petrograd. He stayed there until after the Bolshevik takeover, then,feeling that 'something sickly and clammy was drawing near', he left for theCaucasus again. Ouspensky was to hate Communism with a total and virulent hatredall his life.Meanwhile, Gurdjieff had decided to move a few miles down the coast, near toSochi. Typically, he decided to make this a test for his followers. In his bookOur Life with Mr Gurdjieff, Hartmann describes how Gurdjieff bought a cart, andtold them they were going to take a short cut to Sochi over the mountains. TheHartmanns were sent on ahead, and found the climb exhausting in the heat, withtheir city clothing (Olga was wearing high-heeled shoes). They stopped at an innfor tea, hoping to stay the night, but when Gurdjieff arrived, he decided thatthe night was so fine that they might as well continue. They stumbled onexhaustedly until two in the morning, when Gurdjieff announced they would make afire. It was raining, and they had to struggle through the undergrowth to finddry wood. Finally they made tea and most of them lay down to sleep on the hardstones. But Hartmann was told that he had to keep guard. He sat there untildawn, when Gurdjieff announced it was time to set off. Now Hartmann was told hecould lie on top of the luggage. In fact this was worse than walking, for if hedozed off, he fell off the luggage.Finally, at midday, they passed through a village, bought cooked lamb and beans,and Hartmann had a deep sleep. That night, again, they needed a fire becausethey could hear the howling of wolves and jackals, which might have killed thehorses. They took turns on guard. The next day at noon they found a desertedposthouse, and spent two days recovering. When they resumed their journey,Hartmann observed that he was no longer tired. The 'super-effort' had caused abreakthrough to a higher energy level, James's 'vital reserves.' Eventually,when they arrived at a pleasant little villa near Sochi, Hartmann felt he was inheaven. Nevertheless, he fell ill with typhoid and almost died; he attributedhis recovery to the fact that Gurdjieff sat by his bed and somehow 'infused'vitality.Ouspensky joined them there. So did a Petrograd disciple, Leonid Stoerneval. Hiswife had been deeply unwilling to leave Petrograd, but shortly after they left,the Bolsheviks took over. Hartmann had had a similar escape: the day after heleft Petrograd, soldiers had come to his home to arrest him.Again, Gurdjieff revealed the unpredictable part of his nature. For some reason,he turned against Zaharoff and virtually forced him to leave. Ouspensky wasupset; his faith in Gurdjieff the man - as distinguished from the System - wasbeginning to collapse.In February 1918, they moved to another village. The danger now was being cutoff by the Bolsheviks. Then Gurdjieff decided to go back to Essentuki. Workthere became harder still. They were ordered to fast and the men were separatedfrom the women. The 'movements' became more and more complicated and difficult.The aristocratic Hartmann was made to go to Kislovodsk to sell silk wound on tocards - until Gurdjieff relented. The women were ordered to give up theirjewellery, and Olga de Hartmann cried all night, but dutifully handed it over.Gurdjieff then gave it back to her. But another woman who handed over herjewellery, confident that she would receive it back, never saw it again.Gurdjieff seemed to be teaching in harshly practical parables.While in Essentuki, Gurdjieff's family arrived - nearly 30 of them. Turks hadinvaded Alexandropol, and his father had been killed. Gurdjieff was forced tolook after this crowd of starving relatives. It was as if fate was subjectinghim to the same 'testing' that he was inflicting on his pupils.Meanwhile, Ouspensky was now at last certain that he had to break withGurdjieff:I saw clearly that I had been mistaken about many things that I had ascribed toG, and that by staying with him now I should not be going in the same directionI went at the beginning.To try to explain his meaning, he says that if Gurdjieff had all the time beenleading him into the 'way of the monk', he would have left - not because he didnot respect the way of the monk, but because it was not his way. And neither, hefelt, was the way the Work was now developing.Ouspensky had at last recognized what, perhaps, he should have realized threeyears earlier. Yet he had undoubtedly received a great deal from Gurdjieff. Inany case, there was now no going back. All he could do was to move to anotherhouse and continue work on A New Model of the Universe, as if the meeting withGurdjieff had never happened."},{"pageContent":"FiveSUCCESSGurdjieff and his followers left Essentuki at the beginning of August 1918, andmade their way 100 miles southwest to the Black Sea. Gurdjieff had succeeded inescaping with his usual incredible effrontery. He had asked the Essentuki Sovietfor permission to mount an archaeological expedition to the mountains where, hesaid, he hoped to find gold. He would need large quantities of alcohol forwashing the gold. The Soviet provided the alcohol, together with the necessarytents and other equipment.Ouspensky, who had also meant to go south, was trapped when Cossacks cut therailway line. So he was forced to spend the autumn and winter in Essentuki. Hemanaged to get a job as a porter, then as a schoolteacher, and so was able tosupport a numerous 'family' - his wife, stepdaughter, and his stepdaughter's twochildren. He also started a school library with books that had been'requisitioned' from their owners. When the White army re-took the town he hadhurriedly to tear off the word 'Soviet' from the notice outside the EssentukiPublic Library.At the first opportunity, he finally made his way south, to Ekaterinodar (laterKrasnodar), an evil-smelling and ugly city that he loathed on sight. There hebegan to write a series of articles about his experiences of the Revolution,which he sent off to London. They appeared in The New Age, the magazine editedby the charismatic Orage, whose acquaintance Ouspensky had made on his way toIndia in 1912, and renewed on his way back to Russia in 1914. Ouspensky'scondemnation of the Bolsheviks was uncompromising; he talked of the'dictatorship of the criminal element'.When Ouspensky mentioned, in one of the letters, that he was 'only alive becausemy boots and my trousers and other articles of clothing . . . are still holdingtogether', Orage hastened to contact F.S. Pinder, the British governmentrepresentative in Ekaterinodar, who appointed Ouspensky to his staff, and seemsto have paid him from his own pocket.It was also while in Ekaterinodar that Ouspensky finally 'set up on his own'. Heformed a small group and began to lecture to them on Gurdjieff's ideas. It wasat this point that he suddenly became aware that now, at last, he was aware of a'new I'. 'Man number four' was beginning to form inside him, and he experienceda curious new confidence. And in fact, in a sense - although there were stilldifficulties to come - his troubles were basically over.But the Reds were winning the civil war. Denikin, the White general, was forcedto withdraw to Rostov-on-Don, and the British staff - and the Ouspensky family -went with him. In Rostov Ouspensky met once again Andrei Zaharoff, the manGurdjieff had driven away from Essentuki. Zaharoff had become totallydisillusioned, not only with Gurdjieff, but also with his ideas, and Ouspenskyfound it impossible to convince him that, no matter what they might both thinkof Gurdjieff as a person, the ideas were still valid. Carl Bechhofer Roberts, ajournalist connected with The New Age, spent two weeks with Ouspensky andZaharoff in their lodging - a draughty barn - drinking home-made vodka. (Hisexperiences are amusingly recorded in an appendix to Ouspensky's 1919 Lettersfrom Russia.) A month later, Roberts had escaped to Novorossisk, on the BlackSea, Ouspensky was back in Ekaterinodar, and Zaharoff had died of smallpox.Finally, with the aid of the British, Ouspensky and his family were evacuated toa refugee camp on Prinkipo Island, a suburb of Constantinople. There, onceagain, he encountered Gurdjieff.Gurdjieff's band of disciples was now greatly reduced. From Essentuki they hadtravelled to Maikop, escaped from there by the skin of their teeth as the Redsclosed in, and returned to Sochi. There, to everyone's astonishment, Gurdjieffannounced that the group would now break up. The likeliest reason is that theyhad run out of money. A small number remained, including Gurdjieff's wife, thede Hartmanns and the Stoernevals. When the Turks withdrew from Georgia - whichthey had been occupying - in late 1918, Gurdjieff decided to return to itscapital Tiflis. He arrived there in January 1919, and found it an unexpectedlypleasant place to resume his Work. It was full of artists and intellectuals whohad fled from the Bolsheviks, and was virtually a second St Petersburg. Olga deHartmann became a singer at the opera; her husband became a professor at theConservatoire. Gurdjieff resumed his teaching, and acquired himself two newdisciples, the painter Alexander de Salzmann and his wife Jeanne, a teacher ofJacques Dalcroze's system of dancing, called 'eurythmics'. Gurdjieff attendedsome of Jeanne de Salzmann's classes, and demonstrated some of his own'movements'. But he was undoubtedly as much influenced by eurythmics as was thatother contemporary guru Rudolf Steiner. Gurdjieff also organized a profitablecarpet business. It was in Tiflis that he decided to call his future institutethe Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man; he even drafted aprospectus, declaring (untruthfully) that it was already in operation in Bombay,Alexandria, Kabul, New York, Chicago, Stockholm, Moscow and Essentuki.Ouspensky, who received a copy, was not impressed. And Bechhofer Roberts, whocalled at the new institute, reported that Gurdjieff was getting tired of hisfollowers and was anxious to get to Europe. The newly independent Georgia waschaotic, and likely to be attacked by the Reds (as, in fact, it was in 1921).This is why, in May 1920, Gurdjieff and a group of about 30 followers started tomake their way to Constantinople; they arrived in June. They were all penniless- the carpets Gurdjieff had tried to take with him as working capital had beenseized en route by marauding soldiers - and were forced to start looking forways of making money in a city that was already crowded with poverty-strickenRussians. Gurdjieff arrived to find that Ouspensky had already started his owngroup. When his ex-Master arrived, the ever-loyal Ouspensky handed it over tohim. Although he had decided not to work with Gurdjieff again, the two remainedon friendly terms. Ouspensky then set up on his own at the White Russian Club inPera, the European quarter, and his talents as a lecturer soon brought him suchlarge audiences that he had to apply to an English lady for the loan of herdrawing-room. Her name was Winifred Beaumont, and her flat was shared by a youngEnglish Intelligence officer called John Godolphin Bennett. Bennett had beeninvalided out of the army after being blown up - he had had an 'out of the bodyexperience' in the hospital - and had gone one better than Ouspensky inconcluding that the answer to the riddles of the world lay in the concept of afifth dimension.Bennett and Mrs Beaumont were intrigued to hear the noisy shouts that came fromher drawing-room - they might have suspected a political meeting, but Ouspenskyhad given his word that politics would not be discussed, and they both felt hecould be trusted. When Bennett asked Ouspensky what they were talking about, andOuspensky replied, 'The transformation of man' Bennett was even more intrigued.In due course, and under separate auspices, he met Gurdjieff - whose name healready knew, since he had received notification from Indian Intelligence thatGurdjieff was a Russian agent.Inevitably, he was entranced. When he and Mrs Beaumont were invited to watch the'dances', they were deeply impressed by the 'Stop!' exercise - the more so asthe dancers were all rushing towards them at top speed when Gurdjieff shoutedthe order. But for some reason, Bennett made no attempt to become part of thegroup.Meanwhile, fate was arranging a pleasant surprise for Ouspensky. A young Russiannamed Nicholas Bessarabov had escaped from Russia after the Revolution, takingwith him a copy of Tertium Organum, which had deeply impressed him. In America,he approached the well-known architect Claude Bragdon, who was the author of abook on the fourth dimension, and who spoke Russian. Bragdon was equally excitedby Tertium Organum, and he and Bessarabov embarked on a translation. In 1920,Bragdon published the book himself (under the imprint Manas Press), and to hisdelight and astonishment, it sold 7,000 copies in its first year. He obtainedOuspensky's address from The New Age, and sent him some copies of the book,together with a cheque. It was probably the happiest day of Ouspensky's life. Helost no time in writing to Bragdon to ask him if he could help him to get toLondon or New York. Again, fate was working overtime on Ouspensky's behalf. AsBragdon was about to reply in the negative, he received a telegram from LadyRothermere, the wife of the British newspaper magnate, saying that she wasdeeply impressed by Tertium Organum and would like to meet its publisher. Theresult of the meeting was a cable for Â£100 to Ouspensky, and an invitation tocome to London with all expenses paid.Fortune was smiling on Ouspensky. Probably only one person in Constantinoplewould have been able to obtain him a visa, and that person happened to be headof British Intelligence there - John Bennett. It took three months, but byAugust, the Ouspenskys were ready to sail.They arrived to a fairy-tale reception. The beautiful Lady Rothermere, ablue-eyed blonde, threw a magnificent party for them, at which they ate withgold knives and forks from what looked like gold plates. The fairy-talecontinued; when Ouspensky gave his first lectures in Lady Rothermere's studio inSt John's Wood, they were attended by the cream of London's intelligentsia,including Orage, T.S. Eliot, Aldous Huxley, Gerald Heard, and a long list ofdoctors, psychologists, editors and other professional men. The British arenotoriously impervious to ideas, but Ouspensky's build-up had been impressive: amysterious foreign philosopher who had been forced to flee from the Bolsheviks,had endured immense hardships, and then, against all the odds, had made his wayto London to present his new message. It all made him an irresistibleattraction. And when the lectures turned out to be, in fact, startlingly new andstrange, the conquest was complete. Ouspensky became the intellectual flavour ofthe month.In retrospect, it is easy to understand why. The First World War had left behinda general feeling of nausea and disillusionment. Ezra Pound had written inMauberley:There died a myriad,And of the best among them,For an old bitch gone in the teeth,For a botched civilisation.It was the poem that, more than any other, inspired Eliot's Waste Land. This wasthe age of The Waste Land, of Ulysses, of Gertrude Stein's lost generation, ofHemingway's The Sun Also Rises and Scott Fitzgerald's tales of the jazz age.Orage himself had been virtually discovered by Shaw, who had financed The NewAge. But Shaw was now regarded as outdated. Orage considered himself rather as adisciple of Nietzsche - a 'revaluer of values'. Even before the war, he hadannounced himself an 'immoralist', one who rejected all the old values. In thishe was probably inspired more by the immensely successful novel Sanine byArtsybashev, in which the hero is the totally 'natural man', who believes thatall the old sexual and religious values are illusions, like the emperor'sclothes. Pre-war London had been obsessed by everything Russian, from the worksof Tolstoy and Dostoevsky to the Diaghilev ballet, and novels like Andreyev'sRed Laugh and Artsybashev's Breaking Point (in which virtually everyone commitssuicide) had brought the notion of total moral negation to London long beforeThe Waste Land.A young man named C.S. Nott, who was to become one of Gurdjieff's most faithfulfollowers, expressed the general malaise when he wrote:Although I had had a religious upbringing and . . . been a Sunday-school teacherand lay preacher . . . , organised religion now had no content for me, nor couldit give me a satisfying answer to the questions that arose in me as aconsequence of the disillusionment resulting from the war.Disillusionment had become the watchword:Unreal cityUnder the brown fog of a winter dawn . . .In this atmosphere of emptiness and boredom, everything seemed to bedisintegrating. In music, tonality was dissolving into the discords of SchÃ¶nbergand Stravinsky. In art, surrealism and Dadaism seemed to make a mockery of thetradition of centuries. In philosophy, the logical positivists announced thatall talk of metaphysics and values was meaningless. In psychology, Freud'ssexual theory reduced the unconscious mind to a basement full of decayingrubbish and religion to a communal lie.And now, into this scene of desolation, came a prophet from Holy Russia,announcing devastating truths that also seemed startlingly original. Here was acomplex system of ideas that satisfied the sceptical intellectuals, but whichalso asserted that salvation could be achieved by effort. None of his audiencehad ever heard anything remotely like it before. The most up-to-date of themwere interested in Freud, Jung and Adler, but this new doctrine seemed to sweepeverything before it like an autumn gale. After that first meeting, the stunnedOrage told Claude Bragdon that 'Mr Ouspensky is the first teacher I have evermet who has impressed me with the ever-increasing certainty that he knows andcan do.'Yet the first impression Ouspensky made on his audiences was far fromimpressive. One hostile commentator, John Carswell, has written: 'Ouspensky,though strikingly large and blond almost to the point of albinism, was in someways unimpressive' The writer David Garnett thought he looked rather likeWoodrow Wilson: 'The same lavish display of false teeth, the same baffled,unseeing eye, the same aura of high thinking and patent medicines.' Anothermember of his audience, Paul Selver, found Ouspensky 'quite monumentallyboorish. He was one of those exasperating Russians who doggedly refuse to creditany other Slav nation with artistic ability. He sneered when I expressed theview that there were several Czech or Serbian poets of outstanding greatness. Ihad read them and he had not, but he contemptuously dismissed my remark with asweeping gesture, as though consigning these unspeakable rhymesters to a garbageheap.'Roland Kenney, a socialist who became editor of the Daily Herald, wrote, 'Whensitting in reflection or repose, he hunched himself together and looked like adejected bird huddling up in a rainstorm.' But he put his finger on theessential when he added: 'He was obviously a man of a dominant if notdomineering type of character, with determination - or obstinacy - written overhis every feature.' And another writer, Rom Landau, who also became an Ouspenskydisciple, speaks of his 'strongly dictatorial manner'.Ouspensky probably did not have the slightest interest in contradicting Selver'sopinion of Czech and Serbian poets, and certainly no interest in exaltingRussians at their expense; he was simply not interested in what he considered tobe literary small-talk, or in questions he regarded as a waste of time. When onelady in his audience asked if the Buddha had reached the seventh level ofconsciousness, he replied, 'I don't know' without even looking up. He was thereto teach them something he had discovered, and he did not believe in wastingtime.What he had to say was, as we know, somewhat depressing: he informed hisaudiences that they had virtually no free will, that they were made up ofhundreds of little 'I's' and that they were actually asleep. Yet this sweepingand oversimplified doctrine - rather like a non-political Marxism - created aneffect of revelation. One member of his audience was a Jungian psychologistnamed Maurice Nicoll. He rushed home from his first Ouspensky lecture to tellhis wife, still recovering from having their first baby: 'You must come and hearOuspensky. He is the only man who has ever answered my questions.' Nicollappeared to be 'irradiated by an inner light', and did not even ask to see thebaby. As a result of his contact with Ouspensky, he broke with Jung, who hadhoped that Nicoll would be his chief exponent in London.It was Nicoll who talked to his friend Kenneth Walker, Hunterian Professor atthe Royal College of Surgeons, who had just written a children's book aboutNoah's Ark. Gurdjieff's ideas, he said, represented a kind of Noah's Ark in themodern flood of violence and unbelief. Walker, as we have seen, felt that theatmosphere at Ouspensky's lecture was a little like the Presbyterian churches ofhis childhood. But he was also impressed by the scientific precision ofOuspensky's mind, and the lack of the usual idealistic waffle about Spirit, Loveand so on. (One 'occultist', A.E. Waite, walked out, indignantly saying, 'MrOuspensky, there is no love in your system.') By now, Ouspensky's lectures hadmoved to 38 Warwick Gardens, Lady Rothermere having - inevitably - grown boredwith the Work.Gurdjieff, in the meantime, had failed to find the security he was looking for.He had left Constantinople for Germany, first for Berlin, then for Hellerau,near Dresden, where he hoped to take over the buildings left empty by theoriginal Jacques Dalcroze Institute. They were owned by a man called HaroldDohrn, and parts were already let out to a smaller version of the DalcrozeInstitute, to the Progressive schoolmaster A.S. Neill, and to another Germanheadmaster named Karl Baer. But Gurdjieff wanted the whole place, and seems tohave persuaded Dohrn to lease it to him. Neill and Baer naturally objected, andsince they had signed leases, they had a strong case. Dohrn changed his mind,and when, according to Neill, Gurdjieff took him to court, protested thatGurdjieff had hypnotized him into agreeing to let him lease the whole building.Gurdjieff apparently lost the case. His biographer James Webb thinks it highlyprobable that he did use his hypnotic powers, in spite of the fact that,according to Life is Real Only Then, When 'I Am', he had renounced them sometime before 1910 because they retarded his spiritual progress. This is not tosuggest that Gurdjieff stared into Dohrn's eyes like Svengali and ordered him togo to sleep. The 'telepathic' episode in Finland described by Ouspensky makes itdear that he knew how to build up a level of heightened vitality and to use itto establish some kind of direct influence over others.Gurdjieff acquired some of Dalcroze's best pupils, but he still had noinstitute. So, in 1922, he went to London and gave a talk to Ouspensky'sstudents. Ouspensky had never made any secret of the fact that the ideas werenot his own, but had originated with Gurdjieff. So there was considerableexcitement when it was learned that the Master himself was coming to see them.His first talk was on 13 February, 1922. Gurdjieff had now shaven his head, sothat he looked stranger and more Asiatic than ever. Ouspensky's English washeavily accented, but more or less accurate; Gurdjieff's was purely functional,and he spoke in a kind of shorthand. When one lady asked what it would be liketo be conscious in essence, he replied expressively: 'Everything more vivid.' Atthis first talk he emphasized the way we all become more 'mechanical' as we getolder, and how, consequently, tremendous effort is needed to generate newenergy.At a later lecture he spoke briefly about man's many 'I's' and inability togovern the emotions. Then, after speaking for barely five minutes, he began totake questions. This was, in fact, one of his favourite methods, for he believedthat mere talk may simply fail to penetrate, while individual questions revealedwhat his listeners really wanted to know. (Ouspensky came to adopt the samemethod.) On this occasion, he made the important comment that the chief cause ofour weakness is 'our inability to apply our will to all three of our centressimultaneously'. He gave an example of how the total will might be applied tothe moving centre - that a prisoner whose only chance of escape depended uponthrowing a note written on a ball of paper through a high and inaccessiblewindow would concentrate his whole being to make sure he succeeded. But the realproblem was to apply the same will to all three centres - physical, intellectualand emotional - at the same time.Orage, who was present, was even more deeply impressed with Gurdjieff than withOuspensky. In fact, he now saw that Ouspensky had intellectualized Gurdjieff'steaching, and therefore, in a sense, 'falsified' it.It was now Gurdjieff's ambition to open his institute in London. But he hadreckoned without his reputation as a Russian spy. He was interviewed by thesecurity services, and their verdict on him seems to have been unfavourable.(There is, in fact, some evidence that he had worked for the Russian SecretService in Tibet.) In spite of the testimony of a committee of doctors -including Nicoll and Walker - before the Home Secretary, Gurdjieff's applicationto move to London was refused. Even Lady Rothermere's influence failed to do himany good. So he packed his bags - undoubtedly to Ouspensky's relief - and leftfor Paris. There he quickly found an ideal site for the Institute for theHarmonious Development of Man near Fontainebleau; it was a chÃ¢teau called thePrieurÃ© des Basses Loges, some 40 miles from Paris. It had formerly been thehome of Madame de Maintenon, second wife of Louis XIV. Gurdjieff had no money,but Ouspensky raised it for him, with a large contribution from Lady Rothermere,so that he was able to lease the Priory for a year, with an option to buy. Hesent for his pupils - who were still waiting in Berlin - and flung himself intoviolent activity to make money. Selling carpets would probably be lessprofitable than in Russia, so Gurdjieff leased two restaurants, went into theoil business, and set up as a psychiatrist specializing in drug addiction andalcoholism. (He seems to have had considerable success in this field although,regrettably, we lack details.) Ouspensky came to Paris to offer help. While hewas away, rumours began to circulate among his London pupils about Gurdjieff'stendency to seduce his female students. With typical loyalty, Ouspensky wrote toOrage to ask him to squash these rumours.Orage himself had already decided to go and join Gurdjieff. After listening tothe Master's talks, he felt as if he had received a religious Call. He wasbecoming tired of being an editor - since pre-war days the circulation of TheNew Age had slumped - and of the London literary scene. When he called onOuspensky in the autumn of 1922 to ask his advice, Ouspensky, who had beenwatching Orage from the window of his flat, replied with typical brevity: 'I cansee you have already made up your mind, so why ask me?' And so began the exodusfrom London which would also include Nicoll and his fellow doctor James Young.John Bennett, back from Constantinople, would also become a regular weekendvisitor at the Priory.Orage must have wondered whether he had jumped out of the frying pan into thefire. In the seven years since he had met Ouspensky, Gurdjieff had ceased torely on verbal teaching to convey his message; he was looking for some form of'action'. Even in Petrograd he had recognized that the discipline required bydancing could help his students to unite the three centres. The deliberatehardships and privations - beyond the demands of the situation - that he hadimposed upon the disciples who followed him to the Caucasus had strengthened hisbelief in the efficacy of 'super-effort'. His discovery of Dalcroze's methodsuggested an extension of the Eastern dances he had presented in Tiflis in TheStruggle of the Magicians. So had the 'Stop!' exercise. So at last Gurdjieff hada system of physical exercises to offer, as well as a system of ideas. And thestarting point was super-effort.When Orage arrived at the Priory, he was first of all told not to smoke - which'almost killed him' - then handed a spade and told to dig. The day began around4 a.m. with a light breakfast of coffee and rolls. Then he was made to dig untilevening. Orage did not even have the consolation that it was useful work thatwould improve the Priory; sometimes Gurdjieff made his followers dig a ditch oneday and fill it in the next. Orage, although tall, was an overweight man, and hewas soon in such a state of exhaustion that he often found himself in tears.Then one day at the end of five months, 'in the depths of despair' and feelinghe could go on no longer, he decided to make one more extra effort. To hisastonishment, he suddenly began enjoying the digging. And Gurdjieff, who hadbeen observing him from a distance, suddenly said: 'Now Orage, I think you digenough - let us go and drink coffee.' For he had other plans for Orage thangrowing vegetables. His experience with Ouspensky had shown him the value of'intellectual' pupils. Orage was to be Ouspensky's replacement as his chiefpropagandist.On 13 December, 1923, Gurdjieff's followers gave the first public performance inthe West of the 'movements', at the Champs ElysÃ©es Theatre, and although reviewswere mixed, it made a considerable impact. Orage was not present; together withDr Stoerneval he was on his way to New York to further Gurdjieff's ambition toconquer the world.Meanwhile, back in Warwick Gardens, Ouspensky was teaching Gurdjieff's ideas inhis own way - intellectually. Inevitably, he laid enormous emphasis on thecosmology - the ray of creation, the Law of Three, the Law of Seven and theEnneagram. With his thick glasses and dry manner, he was not capable ofinspiring the same fascination and devotion as the Master in Paris, yet hisstudents gradually found that he was becoming an addiction. In Venture withIdeas, Kenneth Walker has recorded how, to begin with, he found Ouspenskyinteresting and original, but felt no compulsion to go to every meeting. Littleby little, as he tested Ouspensky's ideas about lack of self-awareness, he beganto feel an increasing compulsion to return; finally, he reached the stage whereOuspensky's lectures were the most important thing in his life. He wasparticularly impressed by his comments about 'wastage'. We all have a certainamount of energy to carry us through the day; but we waste so much in uselessactivities and negative emotions that we have no chance of having energy leftover for personal evolution. Walker discovered:The more I put into practice the psychological principles of the System, themore convinced I became of their value, I found, for example, that with theirhelp I was able to overcome certain difficulties in my professional life,difficulties resulting from negative imagination. I no longer lay awake atnight, as I formerly did, listening for the telephone to ring and for thenight-sister to tell me that the patient on whom I had operated had suddenlycollapsed. I ceased to wonder during the small hours of the morning whether itwould not have been better for me to have done this rather than that, for by nowI had fully realised the futility of such thoughts. And as the wastage of energythrough worry and identification lessened I found myself able to do more andwith steadily increasing efficiency.After publication of A New Model of the Universe in 1931, the number ofOuspensky's pupils began to increase. Soon there were so many that he had tohold two meetings a week. New faces continued to appear, but many of themdropped out almost immediately. One Spiritualist who asked Ouspensky his viewson life 'on the other side' was offended when Ouspensky replied that it was farmore important to study life on this side. Another man was upset becauseOuspensky brushed aside his attempt to translate the ideas of the System intoreligious terminology, and also failed to return. Ouspensky did not mind in theleast. In fact, he explained that one of the major principles of the Work was'artificially produced friction' and that this often involved irritatingeverybody. Gurdjieff himself constantly applied this method at the Priory, evento setting his pupils against one another.As for Ouspensky, his students noticed that he no longer went to see Gurdjieffin Paris. There had been a total break, no one knew why. Ouspensky's old friendMouraviev tells a story of how, when asked about this break, Ouspensky replied:'If someone close to you, your near relative, turned out to be a criminal, whatwould you do?' This sounds like more than an intellectual disagreement, and thelikelihood is that Ouspensky had received confirmation of the rumours aboutseduction that he had ordered Orage to suppress.When Ouspensky visited New York many years later, he was asked again about thebreak with Gurdjieff, and replied simply that when he had discovered that'Gurdjieff was wrong', he had to leave him. But since Ouspensky continued toteach a system that was basically Gurdjieff's, it is hard to understand what hemeant by the assertion that Gurdjieff was wrong.The obvious difference between Ouspensky's 'method' and Gurdjieff's is thatOuspensky's was much gentler: it did not consist of trying to bring people to apoint of 'second wind' by driving them to near exhaustion. Yet Ouspensky himselfcame to feel that more actual 'work' was required. In 1933, the group decided toacquire a house, and a suitable property was found at Hayes, on the Great WestRoad out of London. Here the assorted group of professional men and women didphysical work - gardening, woodwork, housework - but the aim was largelyself-observation. Walker has a delightful story of two of them being sent out tobeat carpets. His approach was simple - raise the carpet off the ground with onehand and beat it with the other. His companion wanted to suspend the carpet froma line, and spent a long time finding a suitable clothesline and stringing itbetween two trees. It proved to be too low and had to be raised. After a seriesof vicissitudes that sound like Three Men in a Boat, they finally started tobeat the carpet, and the rope snapped. It can be seen why Ouspensky's studentsseem to have enjoyed the process of getting to know themselves throughself-observation.Ouspensky explained that one of the main problems with civilized human beings istheir 'false personalities', the front they have built up to meet the world.'Madame Ouspensky', who seems to have been in many ways a stronger characterthan her husband, had an eagle eye for weakness, and a deadly gift for mimicry.Walker describes her imitations of 'Mr N.' arriving late for lunch and hoping noone had noticed, 'Miss D.' dusting a room as if applying powder to her nose, 'MrM.' grinding coffee beans with as much effort as he would put into raising aheavy bucket from a deep well. She also had a gift of words - most of them inRussian - and had no hesitation in making remarks like 'You are a warning to usall and quite useless' or describing someone's conversation as 'pouringemptiness into a void'. She likened the 'false personality' to a huge hot-airpie which the owner carried about on a tray in order to be admired, but whichhad to be treated very carefully, or its thin crust would be damaged.All this. Walker explains, developed in them the ability to laugh at themselvesand at one another, and made for a relaxed and happy atmosphere. MadameOuspensky differed from her husband in having a strong religious bent, and sospent much time arranging readings from world scriptures - the sayings of theBuddha, the Bhagavad Gita, texts of Taoism and Sufism, even the Church Fathers.And Ouspensky, who had always insisted that the Fourth Way should be regarded asa scientific method, seems to have accepted all this without protest. Accordingto his own doctrine of sleep and mechanicalness, religious readings should havebeen useless, a method of self-deception. The fact that he accepted them seemsto indicate that he acknowledged that the world's great religions havefundamentally the same aim as the Work. On the other hand, the mystery may beexplained simply by the fact that Madame Ouspensky had preferred to be at thePriory with Gurdjieff rather than in London with her husband, and thatGurdjieff's attitude to religion was quite unlike Ouspensky's. When Gurdjiefffinally sent her away, she came to England with the deepest reluctance, and sheand Ouspensky continued to live separately. (In The Harmonious Circle, JamesWebb records that Ouspensky had a mistress.)Within three years, Ouspensky's community had become so successful that theydecided they needed a larger place, and moved to a house at Virginia Water, nearAscot. But this had disadvantages; Lyne Place was so large that the atmosphereof intimacy was lost, and they felt they belonged to an institution. They alsosaw less of the Ouspenskys. But they moved a step further in the direction ofthe Priory by felling timber, building a sawmill, and farming on a larger scale.And after a few years, Ouspensky went still further in Gurdjieff's direction byintroducing training in 'the movements'. 'Head, body, arms and legs often movedin different rhythms and when it seemed natural to turn in a certain directionthe exercise often dictated that one should turn in the opposite direction,'according to Walker. He goes on:It was difficult at the end of a hard day's work in London to drive out sometwenty odd miles into the country in order to take part in these supremelydifficult exercises. At such times the flimsiest excuse seemed to provide avalid reason for not going. A whole conversation would start up inside me; thefog was getting thicker. . . next day would be a heavy day. . . But the strangething was that however fatigued I might be when I began Gurdjieff's difficultexercises I always drove back to London so full of energy that I had no desireto go to bed.But Ouspensky now recognized that the sheer success of his enterprise had becomehis main problem.'He could either cut down the size of the group and carry onmore intensive work with a smaller following, or else he could open the doorwider and allow more people to enter.' The latter course, which might seemself-defeating, was the one they chose. Instead of the Warwick Gardens flat(which they had kept on), they would find a larger house in London. One waseventually found in Hammersmith. But with the war approaching, the Ouspenskysapparently decided that they needed some innocent 'cover'. Why this should be sois not clear, and it seems likely that it was a hangover from the old days of'secrecy', when the notion that they were a secret society formed an additionalbond. (In fact, Ouspensky was under Home Office surveillance in the late '30s asa potential Russian agent, but was not even aware of it.) At all events, thegroup decided to call themselves the Historico-Psychological Society, and claimto be studying Eastern religions. They would even present public lectures on'appropriate subjects', and impart their real purpose only to members of theaudience who seemed suitable . . .While Ouspensky had been building up his own secure following in England,Gurdjieff's group had been through some strange vicissitudes. Throughout theinter-war years Gurdjieff's main problem was money. Ouspensky built up afollowing of well-off disciples who could afford to pay for their instruction;Gurdjieff had a large group of Russians who needed to be supported. He drovehimself so hard during the early days of the Priory that one night, driving backfrom Paris, he was unable to stay awake. He pulled his car into the side of theroad, and was awakened the next morning when a farm wagon tried to get past. Hisnight in the open led to a chill whose effects were long lasting.Then malicious gossip was caused by the death of the writer Katherine Mansfieldat the Priory in January 1924. She was rumoured to have been worked to death bythe demonic 'magician'. In fact, she had arrived there - in October 1923 -already dying of tuberculosis. Gurdjieff had the curious idea of placing her bedover a barn where she could smell the odour of cows, but it did no good; shedied after an evening of watching the Gurdjieff dances.By that time, Orage was in New York preparing the way for Gurdjieff's arrival.He disembarked towards the end of December, and was taken to a bookshop on 44thSt, whose part-owner promptly fell in love with him. A few days later, Oragegave his first lecture, explaining to his audience that Gurdjieff had been amember of a group called the Seekers after Truth, who had spent years searchingfor esoteric knowledge in the East, and had brought back its secrets to theWest. There was an element of truth in this, but it seems almost certain thatthe Seekers after Truth were a product of Gurdjieff's imagination.In early January 1924, Gurdjieff arrived, together with the Hartmanns and otherfollowers. A first performance of the sacred dances was given in a small hallwhose stage had been reconstructed by the group. It was free, and Gurdjieffhimself handed out tickets in the foyer, scrutinizing the faces of the peopleand ignoring some of them. In early February there was a performance at theNeighbourhood Playhouse; it lasted for four hours, and left the audience deeplyimpressed. In addition to the dances, Gurdjieff's pupils demonstrated certain'magic' tricks involving telepathy. A pupil in the audience would take someobject from a member of the audience, and 'transmit' it to someone on stage, whowould accurately describe it. The names of operas were also 'transmitted' andHartmann would then play extracts from them on the piano. 'Pictures' were'transmitted' to the artist de Salzmann, who drew them on large sheets of paper.Gurdjieff explained - through Orage - that some of these demonstrations were'tricks', some were 'half-tricks' and some were genuine psychical phenomena; buthe left it to the audience to guess which was which. One young man named StanleyNott confessed himself totally baffled. The writer Llewellyn Powys said that thepupils were like a hutchful of hypnotized rabbits, while another commentatordescribed Gurdjieff as looking like a riding master.But in the novelty-hungry America of the jazz age, this search for salvationthrough self-knowledge made only a temporary impact, and audiences declined. Atrip to Chicago - at the invitation of the Diaghilev choreographer Adolf Bolm -was a success, as was a final performance at Carnegie Hall. But financially, thetrip was not as successful as Gurdjieff had hoped.Then, in July 1924, it suddenly looked as if Gurdjieff's interesting career hadbeen prematurely terminated. He was driving back from Paris to the Priory whenhis car crashed into a tree; he was found lying on his back beside it. Doctorsdiagnosed serious concussion. (Ouspensky, who visited the Priory during thisperiod, believed that Gurdjieff was being punished by higher powers for histransgressions.) When Gurdjieff finally recovered, he announced that he haddecided to close down the Priory, and most of the Russians left. Gurdjieffhimself, apparently determined to transmit his ideas to posterity, began towrite the first series of All and Everything, Beelzebub's Tales to his Grandson,a work that became famed for its impenetrability and for the weirdness of itsneologisms.In The Harmonious Circle, James Webb makes the interesting suggestion thatGurdjieff arranged his own accident. He points out that Gurdjieff showed nooutward sign of having been in a car crash. He was found lying beside the carwith his head on a cushion. When brought back from the hospital, he wasunconscious for five days, yet his fist clenched violently when Madame deHartmann took his pulse. He is also reported to have told his attendants whereto massage him.The accident itself is a mystery. That day, Gurdjieff's car had been in thegarage for its steering column to be checked. It seems odd that the steeringcolumn should then have failed - although perhaps credible enough for anyonewith experience of garages. However, also that day, Gurdjieff's secretary Olgade Hartmann had been given power of attorney, and told to return to the Prioryby train, instead of - as usual - in Gurdjieff's car. She was irritated, sinceit was a hot day, and she would have preferred to travel in the open car. Shewas also puzzled when Gurdjieff cancelled an appointment at the last moment; hewas normally thoughtful when dealing with people outside the Work. At the timeof the crash, at about 4.30 in the afternoon, she was awakened from a doze byGurdjieff's voice calling her name. Since we know Gurdjieff possessed telepathicpowers, could this not also have been part of the plan?If Webb is correct, what could have been the purpose of such a deception? Theanswer may be that Gurdjieff was sick of being the 'circus master' and guru. Hispower to fascinate and arouse devotion made him the slave of his own disciples.He had already behaved in a similar manner in Russia when he had abruptlyannounced the dissolution of the group. Before the accident, he spent two days aweek in Paris, and he may often have wished it could have been more. After all,in London, Ouspensky lived quietly in his flat, and gave lectures once a week.In France, Gurdjieff spent most of his time in the midst of his disciples, ortrying to make money to support them.The accident certainly changed all that. Large numbers of followers left thePriory - particularly the Russians, who were the biggest drain on Gurdjieff'sresources. Olga de Hartmann took over the running of the place. Gurdjieff hadtold them: 'All my life I have lived for others. Now I will live for myself awhile.'How does Webb's theory explain the fact that Gurdjieff's hands were lacerated,and that many of his followers were shocked by the change in him? The obviouspossibility is that, in faking his accident, Gurdjieff failed to jump out of thecar quickly enough.What shocked the disciples was not so much that Gurdjieff had had an accident asthat, according to his own teaching, he should have been 'beyond' the law ofaccident. He possessed 'essence', and essence is subject to the laws of destiny,not accident.But whether Gurdjieff's car crash was accident, destiny or play-acting, itundoubtedly freed him from the trap that had closed around him. After 1924, thePriory was suddenly a quieter place."},{"pageContent":"Six'THERE IS NO SYSTEM'One of our main sources for Ouspensky's final years is Stanley Nott, the youngEnglishman who had been introduced to Gurdjieff's teaching through Orage. InJourney through this World: The Second Journal of a Pupil, Nott described avisit to Ouspensky in London in the spring of 1935. He had seen Ouspensky onlyonce before and, on that occasion had, like most people, found him rather coldand detached; now he was surprised to find him a warm and friendly man. ButMadame Ouspensky proved to be a dragon, and at one point Nott had toremonstrate: 'I didn't come here to be put through a catechism, but to have afriendly conversation.' Nott lent Ouspensky a copy of the typescript ofBeelzebub's Tales, about which he was obviously intensely curious. Nott regardedit as a kind of Bible. Ouspensky agreed to allow Nott to attend one of hisgroups - he told him that he now had more than 1,000 pupils - on condition thathe did not talk about Beelzebub. But after a few glasses of wine he began torelax and unburden himself on the subject of Gurdjieff:You know, when Gurdjieff started his Institute in Paris I did everything I couldfor him. I raised money for him and sent him pupils, many of them influentialpeople. When he bought the PrieurÃ© I went there myself and Madame stayed forsome time. But I found that he had changed from when I knew him in Russia. Hewas difficult in Essentuki and Constantinople but more so in Fontainebleau. Hisbehaviour had changed. He did many things that I did not like, but it wasn'twhat he did that upset me, it was the stupid way he did them. He came to Londonto my group and made things very unpleasant for me. After this I saw that I mustbreak with him . . .He went on to say that he was convinced that Gurdjieff had 'lost contact withthe source' after Essentuki, and that he had never recovered from his caraccident. Nott denied this, but could see that nothing he could say would alterOuspensky's opinion. 'I began to see traces of the inflexible mental attitudethat besets Russians . . . once they have adopted a mental attitude to a givensituation they will stick to it, whatever the cost.'According to Nott, the break had come after a visit from Gurdjieff toOuspensky's London group in 1922 (when Gurdjieff was accompanied by Pinder).Gurdjieff had told Ouspensky that he was too intellectual, and was working onthe wrong lines. If he wished to understand he must stop and start to work withGurdjieff again . . . Understandably, Ouspensky rejected this - after being inthe Work for seven years he must have felt that he understood it as well as heever would. In a sense he was right; and the point is underlined by the factthat he handed Nott the typescript of The Strange Life of Ivan Osokin, which hehad been revising. Ouspensky had already surrendered enough of his individualityto Gurdjieff.Nott, of course, had no doubt whatever that Gurdjieff's outbursts of rudenessand eccentricity were carefully calculated to bring enlightenment to his pupils,and the memoirs of some of these pupils - like Fritz Peters - make it clear hewas fundamentally correct. Yet, as we have seen, it is also clear that he failedto recognize that Ouspensky possessed his own kind of genius, and that he wasright to wish to go his own way. An Ouspensky who returned to Gurdjieff as adisciple would have been emasculated.At the first meeting Nott attended, Ouspensky arrived half an hour or so late,after an advanced pupil had already asked the audience for questions. ThenOuspensky answered the questions one by one. 'As the evening went on,' saysNott, 'Ibecame more and more impressed with the breadth and clarity of hismassive and powerful mind - so far as knowledge was concerned.' Nott continuedto feel, however, that Ouspensky was missing Gurdjieff's basic point.Nevertheless, as they shared glasses of red wine, Nott began to feel 'a realaffection' for Ouspensky. The problem, he saw, was that Ouspensky wanted to'come to an understanding' with Guidjieff - and that was impossible. You eitheraccepted Gurdjieff as a teacher or you didn't. The two attitudes - Ouspensky'sand Nott's - were incompatible. Ouspensky felt that knowledge was an objectivefact, like a mathematical table; a teacher might be useful as a catalyst, but inthe ultimate sense, no teacher is 'necessary'. He obviously felt that Nott'stendency to accept Gurdjieff as an infallible guru was a sign of a feebleintellect.Yet in spite of his success as a teacher, Ouspensky's dissatisfaction with hisown progress was plain. He told Nott one day that it was now necessary to get intouch with 'an esoteric school'. 'There must be schools, either in Europe or theNear East.' In effect, he was back at square one.Gurdjieff's comment, when Nott told him that he liked Ouspensky, was: 'Ouspenskyvery nice man to talk to and drink vodka with, but he is weak man.'Reflecting on this later, Nott concluded that Ouspensky's weakness lay in hisemotional centre. Intellectuals - like Shaw and Bertrand Russell - areparticularly prone to this: '. . . one expects them to be adult emotionally, andthey are not.'The point is underlined by Nott's story of Ouspensky's comment when Nott askedhim if he had read the typescript of Beelzebub: 'No, it sticks in my throat.'Beelzebub is, admittedly, an infuriatingly obscure book. Yet Ouspensky's failureto try to get to grips with it reveals that his remarkable intellect was hobbledby pride and touchiness.In spite of their disagreements, Gurdjieff continued to feel kindly towards theOuspensky's, and sent them parcels of delicacies every time Nott returned toLondon from the PrieurÃ©. One day, Madame Ouspensky asked Nott what he got fromGurdjieff. His answer is significant:Mr Gurdjieff says things to me about myself which hit me right in my feelings,in my essence, so that I can never forget them; and little by little the effectis to change something in me and give me more understanding of myself and otherpeople; at the same time it is accompanied by a realisation of how little Iactually do understand. Mr Ouspensky appeals to my mind and I'm never tired oflistening to him. But this doesn't change things in myself. I think I can saythat I get more for inner work from one lunch with Mr Gurdjieff than from a yearof Mr Ouspensky's groups.Oddly enough, Madame Ouspensky replied: 'Yes, I think I know what you mean.'Another story of Nott's makes the point even more powerfully. In the second halfof the 1930s he was depressed by the rise of the Nazis, and by setbacks in hispersonal life - including an accident in which his son lost a leg. He went tosee Gurdjieff in Paris, and after lunch, Gurdjieff asked him into hissitting-room. Then Gurdjieff sat at the harmonium and began to play, 'keepinghis eyes fixed on me with a look of deep compassion and power'.Little by little I became aware that he was conveying something to me boththrough the music - the combination of the notes - and by the telepathic meanswhich he understood so well. A change began to take place in me; I began tounderstand something, and a feeling of conscious hope and conscious faith beganto displace the dark hopeless depression.When he left, 'a healing of the psychic wounds had begun'.Back in London, Ouspensky was lecturing to crowded audiences in Hammersmith. ButMadame Ouspensky had become seriously ill. To Nott's astonishment, Ouspenskydecided that Gurdjieff was the only one who could do anything for her. And inspite of Ouspensky's comment that he felt Gurdjieff had now lost touch with the'source', Nott agreed to try to persuade Gurdjieff to come to England - MadameOuspensky being too ill to go to Paris.With typical generosity, Gurdjieff instantly agreed to come to London. But twodays before he was due to arrive, war broke out. Fortunately, Madame Ouspenskyseems to have made some kind of recovery without his help.As soon as the air raids began, it became difficult to carry on with meetings inLondon, and petrol rationing and the black-out made Virginia Water inaccessible.On 4 January, 1941, Madame Ouspensky sailed for America with a small group of'the faithful', and two weeks later, Ouspensky followed her. It had been almost21 years since he had received the letter from Claude Bragdon with the royaltycheque for Tertium Organum, and the two decades since then had been a period ofpeace and prosperity. Now, just as it began to look as if his work was enteringa new phase of success, he was once again being condemned to exile.The voyage took more than six weeks - the Georgic had to go far out of its wayto dodge U-boats - and they arrived in early March. Madame Ouspensky had taken ahouse at Rumson, on the coast of New Jersey. Stanley Nott, who had been inAmerica a year, was glad to see that she now looked much better, and was alsofriendlier and less forbidding. Nott soon went to have lunch with Ouspensky in aNew York hotel, and suggested that he should come and address the 'Orage group',of which he had become a member.Orage himself had been dead since November 1934. Unlike Ouspensky, he neverrenounced Gurdjieff: Gurdjieff renounced him. While Orage was on a trip toEngland in 1930, Gurdjieff had taken over his New York group and made themembers sign a letter in which they renounced Orage. Typically, Orage lost notime in signing it too. Exactly why Gurdjieff turned against Orage is unclear.He may have felt that, like Ouspensky, Orage was carrying the Work in the wrongdirection. Or he may simply have decided that everybody needed a 'shock'. Theshock seems to have done Orage no harm; he returned to England and devotedhimself to the curious ideas of Major Clifford Douglas on 'Social Credit' - asystem designed to replace money with a kind of barter. And in spite ofGurdjieff's prohibition, Orage's group continued to regard him with reverence.Ouspensky attended a meeting of the group at a house in Madison Avenue, and wasoddly unimpressive. 'No authority,' said one of Orage's pupils. They knewGurdjieff and felt that Ouspensky had neither Gurdjieff's fire nor Orage'swarmth and brilliance. The Ouspensky group that subsequently formed had onlyabout 50 members, and by the end of two years, only half a dozen remained. Onthe other hand, many of Ouspensky's former pupils from England decided to joinhim in America, and for this group, Ouspensky, not Gurdjieff, was the Master.Yet Nott, who saw something of Ouspensky in New York, felt that he had lost theold drive. Nott attributes this to the infirmities of age, but in fact Ouspenskywas only 63. The real problem was almost certainly that he had been uprootedonce too often. He was drinking too much - Nott says that he was imbibing strongconcoctions that required a stomach of iron - and obviously felt that he hadsimply not achieved the inner freedom he had set out to attain. By nature, hewas a gentle romantic, whose attempts to turn himself into a kind of scientificguru were an affront to his fundamental nature. He told Nott that his strongpotations were 'the only thing that relieves the boredom and depression thatcomes over me at times'.In fact, Ouspensky's alcoholism provides us with a vital clue. The immediateeffect of alcohol - particularly spirits - is 'uplift', an increase of 'innerpressure'. It is as if one has closed certain inner valves and ceased to 'leak'.'Depression' means, literally, low pressure. Now any form of purposeful activityhas the effect of closing the leaks and raising our inner pressure. For romanticintellectuals of Ouspensky's type, the best possible remedy for depression iscreative thinking or writing. But Ouspensky had ceased to do any originalthinking many years ago. Tertium Organum and A New Model of the Universe laydecades behind him. He had learned to achieve his 'intellectual feedback'through other people; he was at his best lecturing to an audience. It broughtout the 'iron man', the scientist, the psychologist. But when he was alone, hehad a sense of anticlimax. There was 'nothing to do'. These were the times whenhe enjoyed relaxing with friends like Nott, or his new disciple Rodney Collin(who had travelled over on the same boat), and reminiscing nostalgically aboutSt Petersburg. But if there was no one to talk to, he seems to have becomesubject to depression. It was at about this time - in 1942 - that he wrote toBennett that man's only hope is to work with the higher emotional centres, andadded gloomily: 'And we do not know how this is to be done.'Ouspensky had now turned his back completely on Gurdjieff. When Nott told himthat Gurdjieff might be moving to New York, he replied that in that case hewould go to California. Nott was asked to take an active part in Ouspensky's NewYork group, but felt unable to do so because he would not have been allowed tomention Gurdjieff or Beelzebub's Tales.In the autumn of 1942, the Ouspenskys acquired a new 'headquarters' - a vasthouse called Franklin Farms in Mendham, New Jersey. It had 300 acres of land,and when the Notts paid a visit, it struck them as a re-creation of Lyne Place -in fact, many of the people were the same. There was also something of the sameair of regimentation - pupils were not allowed to address one another by theirChristian names, and Nott was again forbidden to mention Gurdjieff. He and hiswife taught Gurdjieff's dances there, but he was not even allowed to reply toquestions about their creator. When, on 7 December, 1941, the Japanese bombedPearl Harbour and America entered the war, Ouspensky was probably relieved thatGurdjieff would not now be returning to torment him.At Franklin Farms, Madame Ouspensky became increasingly the dominant force;Ouspensky often sat apart, silently drinking wine. Madame had become moredespotic than ever, and the tap of her stick made the pupils look at one anothernervously. One of them compared her to Gurdjieff - but she seems to have lackedthe Master's kindness. Nott was one of the few who had the courage to stand upto her: before leaving Mendham to teach at a progressive school in Vermont, heshocked her by telling her that trying to teach 'the System' without mentioningGurdjieff was like trying to teach Christianity without mentioning Jesus Christ.Ouspensky's depression was making him increasingly bad tempered. When a newedition of A New Model of the Universe appeared with a blurb stating thatOuspensky was working in a group with Gurdjieff near London, he flew into a rageand proposed to call a press conference. Nott tried to persuade New York editorsto send representatives and discovered - not surprisingly - that no one wasremotely interested. And when Ouspensky heard that Bennett was teaching theSystem in England, he wrote him an angry letter pointing out that he had beensworn to secrecy. Visitors to Mendham heard Bennett described as a plagiaristand a thief.When Nott returned to Mendham after a year in Vermont, he found conditionsrelatively unchanged. Madame Ouspensky as bossy as ever, and as paranoid aboutGurdjieff. It was this that led to his decision to leave. He had been invited todinner by a couple he had known for years, pupils of Ouspensky. They began toask him about Beelzebub's Tales, and since they were dining at the couple'shome, Nott felt free to talk about it, telling them that it was 'the Bible ofthe Work'. When they asked where they could get hold of it, he referred them toMadame Ouspensky.The next day he was summoned by Madame, who accused him of breaking his promise.Nott replied that he had kept his promise not to discuss Gurdjieff at FranklinFarms, but when he was elsewhere he felt free to do as he liked. She describedthis as mere quibbling. Nott then pointed out firmly that she was teachingGurdjieff's System at Mendham. Madame Ouspensky became angry, and Nott ended bytelling her that her pupils were all stuck at the 'mi' level, and that if theywere to progress to 'fa', they would need a shock - the kind of shock that couldbe provided by Gurdjieff and his book. This was the end. Nott announced he wasleaving and they shook hands; he never saw her or Ouspensky again. In his secondJournal of a Pupil, Nott states his considered opinion that after Ouspensky cuthimself off from Gurdjieff, his work began to lose its value.He was probably right. Yet it is equally clear that Ouspensky could not haveremained with Gurdjieff. Gurdjieff needed disciples, and Ouspensky, for all hisweakness, was too big a man to be anyone's disciple forever. The dilemma wasinsoluble.What seems very clear is that Ouspensky had lost his mainspring. He felt he hadreached a dead end. He had caught his glimpses of freedom, of the higheremotional centres; now he felt stuck in everyday reality, too old for furthermental effort. Towards the end of the war, he seems to have thought constantlyabout returning to England. One reason was probably the increasing dominance ofMadame Ouspensky at Mendham. She was suffering from Parkinson's Disease, and itseems to have made her even more domineering. Nevertheless, Ouspensky was notignored - on the contrary, some of his pupils were inclined to worship him. Onewoman who fell on her knees before him was sternly told to get up at once andnever do it again. Even his habit of sitting silent as he boozed was interpretedas a teaching gambit. It must have struck him as ironic to be regarded with somuch reverence when he felt that he had lost all the answers. When hisstep-daughter asked him for advice on how to combat her depression, he couldonly snap: 'Pray, Lenotchka, pray!'In spite, however, of his indignation with Bennett, Ouspensky himself was nowthinking of publishing something about the Work - a series of lectures he hadgiven in England in the late 1930s. But he seems to have had difficulty findinga publisher, and the book, The Psychology of Man's Possible Evolution, was notissued until in 1950, after his death. During the war, Ouspensky was alsoengaged on the lengthy account of his years with Gurdjieff, 'Fragments of anUnknown Teaching', which, as already mentioned, was later published under thetitle In Search of the Miraculous.Towards the end of the war, two English followers, who had been in charge ofLyne Place, made their way to Mendham. James Webb quotes them as saying thatthey found Ouspensky disabled 'as if by a stroke', and that he was virtually aprisoner. He asked them to try and get the Hammersmith house back from the Navy(who had requisitioned it) and prepare it for his return.Yet by the end of the war Ouspensky's health was so poor that there seemed doubtwhether he would be able to cross the Atlantic. (He was suffering from a seriouskidney complaint, exacerbated by his heavy drinking.) But he finally arrived -without his wife - in January 1947, and was driven straight to Lyne Place.Kenneth Walker comments that they hardly recognized him; he was 'a man on whomDeath had already set its mark'. Ouspensky was deeply preoccupied, as if 'hismind was deeply engaged on some problem'. That problem, Walker thinks, wasprobably that of 'Eternal Recurrence', and the notion that he would have toreturn to live his life all over again - and try and do better next time.A few weeks later, on 24 February, 1947, the 'Historico-Psychological Society'met at the hall in Colet Gardens. Ouspensky's English follower Dr Francis Roleshad organized a large audience, but they were dismayed by Ouspensky's appearanceand manner. He was hobbling on a cane, and looked old, bent and sick; hisEnglish seemed less comprehensible than ever. He used a kind of privatesecretary called Miss Quinn - from Mendham - to take questions, but he seemedimpatient of most of them, and kept snapping: 'Be simpler' or 'Start from whatyou know.' When Kenneth Walker asked if he had abandoned the System, he shockedeveryone by answering: 'There is no System.'Walker gathered that Ouspensky had evolved some new plan for the Work in London,but could also see that he was too weak to carry it out. It seems possible thatit was based on his idea that everyone should spend time remembering his life indetail, to fix it in memory for the next incarnation.At the next two meetings, on 5 and 12 March, it became even clearer thatOuspensky had somehow lost his belief in the System. When people talked aboutbeing mechanical, he asked them who had told them so. He even dismissedself-remembering. When someone asked him how to find harmony, he replied: 'Thisis your question? This is my question now, and I have no answer.' He no longerbelieved in the possibility of change. To a lady who asked why he would not helpthem, he replied that he had no help to give.But, interestingly enough, he told his pupils that they must have astraightforward, everyday aim, and that only by working alone could one makeprogress. This was a flat contradiction of Gurdjieff's teaching that nothingcould be achieved by working alone. Was this a sign of Ouspensky'sdisillusionment, or was it, in fact, a new insight? There were three moremeetings, and at the last - on 18 June - Ouspensky again emphasized theimportance of the individual finding out what he or she wanted and then pursuingit. It was as if he recognized that 'enlightenment' should not be pursued forits own sake, but as a by-product of some other work. His own problem was thathe had pursued it for its own sake, and now had no 'work' to do.Clear evidence of his loss of direction and purpose is provided by the fact thathe decided to return to America - an obviously retrogressive step. Then, at thelast minute, when his pupils were all on board, ready to leave, he arrived inhis wheelchair and announced that he had changed his mind. He was now behavingwith the same lack of consideration of which he had accused Gurdjieff, althoughit is not clear whether this was intentional - to administer a 'shock' - ormerely the result of illness.Ouspensky spent much of his last months in England revisiting places associatedwith his past - evidently in an attempt to fix them in his mind for his nextexistence. On one occasion he decided not to get out of the car at Lyne, but satin it all night, surrounded by cats. (He believed that cats are the only animalsthat possess astral bodies and that this is why witches use them as familiars.)One lady stood by the car, her arm raised in solemn salute.But the end, after all, was not to be pathetic and anticlimactic. James Webb'sresearches into Ouspensky's last days reveal that his pupils were convinced thatsomething strange had happened. Ouspensky seemed to become telepathic, to suchan extent that people in attendance on him became worried, and asked him to usewords to communicate. Lyne seemed 'full of presences', and when one day apowerful presence seemed to manifest itself, Ouspensky asked: 'You notice?' Hispupils became convinced that he had achieved 'Cosmic Consciousness', and one ofthem described him as 'an angel'. Another witness said that 'what was going onwas God's business', apparently meaning that supernatural forces were nowintervening. Rodney Collin was to declare that he felt that a Christlike beingwas presiding over Ouspensky's death.Collin seems to have taken it upon himself to try to make Ouspensky 'dieconsciously', and to make sure that he did not 'go gentle into that good night'.Others state that Ouspensky needed no encouragement, and spent his last daysmaking 'super-efforts', even waking his pupils up in the middle of the night. Itwas, according to Collin, in his arms that Ouspensky finally died at dawn on 2October, 1947, after dressing himself and summoning the household for a 'finalbriefing'. Not long before his death he had repeated: 'I abandon the System.Start again for yourselves.' He was buried in Lyne churchyard.Collin retreated to the dressing-room next to Ouspensky's bedroom, and lockedhimself in for six days. When someone tried to climb up a ladder to look intothe room, the window opened and Collin pushed the ladder to the ground. Finally,Collin rang the bell that Ouspensky rang when he needed attention. He was foundsitting cross-legged on Ouspensky's bed, dirty and unshaven, and he asked hiswife Janet to bring him lime juice. He later told her - and his sister-in-law,Joyce Collin-Smith - that he had been in communication with Ouspensky during allthis period, and that the disclosures were so important that he was determinednot to be disturbed. The result of this communication led him to formulate atheory of 'four worlds', each on different vibrational rates, and to write abook called The Theory of Celestial Influence.[1] He was to die, undermysterious circumstances, on 3 May, 1956, after falling from a tower in Mexico.Now Ouspensky was dead, the faithful asked Madame Ouspensky what they were todo. To their amazement, she answered that they were to contact Gurdjieff inParis. Gurdjieff himself wrote to Lyne: 'You are sheep without a shepherd; cometo me.'This caused consternation. Ouspensky's pupils had long ago accepted hisassertion that Gurdjieff had lost his sense of direction after Essentuki andvirtually gone mad - or, at least, gone bad. Contact with American pupils musthave confirmed that impression: from the time Orage had formed his group there,Gurdjieff's demands for money had been unremitting; it looked as if he thoughtof his American disciples as sheep who were there to be fleeced In fact, heseemed to be doing his best to alienate his pupils - in the book Herald ofComing Good, he claimed he had founded his Institute for 'purely personal ends'.Pupils deserted in droves - which may have been what he wanted.The Priory had been sold in 1933, and Gurdjieff had retired to the Grand Hotelin Paris. From 1933 to mid-1935 he had lived in America, where he was hoping tore-establish an institute. But fate seemed against him. D.H. Lawrence'sex-disciple Mabel Dodge Luhan changed her mind about allowing him to set it upat Taos, in New Mexico. Then another disciple, Jean Toomer, tried to arrange ameeting with an American senator, but the senator's plane exploded in mid-air.Gurdjieff even tried to return to Russia, but was turned down by the Sovietauthorities. He returned to Paris - via Germany - in the late summer of 1935,and soon had another enthusiastic group around him. In 1936, he moved into 6 ruedes Colonels Renard, in the Russian quarter, north of the Etoile. At thisperiod, the old, formidable Gurdjieff, who had reminded an American critic of ariding master or a circus ringmaster, and whom de Salzmann had called a demon,gave way to a gentler and more kindly person. When the war came, Gurdjieffstayed on in Paris, and the occupying Germans seem to have regarded him as amild and harmless old man.[1]About half the Lyne group decided to follow Madame Ouspensky's advice, andexactly a year after Ouspensky's death, on 2 October, 1948, Kenneth Walker andhis wife Mary arrived in Paris. They arrived at a typically Parisian block offlats with half a dozen other people, including a member of the Lyne group.Gurdjieff's flat reminded Walker of a junk shop, with a remarkable mixture offurniture and a cozy haphazardness. 'Everything seemed to have happened byaccident, and nothing by design.' It smelt of Eastern spices. Together with alarge crowd, Walker and his wife entered a 'reading room' as oddly furnished asthe hall, and for an hour listened to a pupil reading from a typescript ofBeehebub. Then Gurdjieff slipped quietly into the room - a short, stout man witha sweeping - and greying - moustache and piercing eyes. When Walker looked moreclosely, he saw that the eyes were friendly. Gurdjieff reminded him of oldChinese paintings of 'the Rogue'. After another hour of reading, Gurdjieffspoke. Rubbing his stomach, he announced that 'le patron' required feeding. Theywere all invited to lunch.The huge crowd squeezed into the dining-room, where Gurdjieff was already seatedon a divan with one foot tucked under the opposite knee. He proceeded to make asalad for his guests, with cucumber, pickles, red peppers, onions and sourcream. Then glasses were filled with Armagnac or vodka, and a pupil who had beenappointed director proposed a toast. Walker (who was basically teetotal) had totake a great swig of vodka.Gurdjieff he found impressive, with his vast, clean-shaven head and olivecomplexion. He claimed to be over 80 (although he was, in fact, 71), and he madeWalker think of Haroun Al Raschid. Gurdjieff had been involved in anotherserious car accident earlier that year, but he showed no sign of it. The guestswent on to eat pigeons stewed in vine leaves, pilaff, wild strawberries withcream, avocados, Turkish delight and melons. Meanwhile they had to drink endlesstoasts until Walker found the room expanding and contracting. This wasGurdjieff's method of getting to know people quickly and discovering their'essence' - if they had any. When it was all over, he invited them all to dinnerthat evening. Outside, Walker asked Mary what she thought of Gurdjieff.'He's the most astonishing man I ever met. The chief impression he gave me wasof immense vigour and of concentrated strength. I had the feeling that he wasnot really a man but a magician.' The Walkers went back to the hotel to sleepoff the vodka. The evening meal was to be just as lavish, and would go on untilafter midnight.Walker reached the interesting conclusion that Gurdjieff was trying to 'loosenup' the London disciples. Too much conscious self-discipline had made them rigidand grim. After Ouspensky, Gurdjieff must have seemed a salutary shock. The moreWalker saw of Gurdjieff, the more he experienced a sense of freedom. Gurdjieffseemed to demonstrate by personal example that man's business is to be god-like.Beelzebub struck Walker as badly written. But no sooner had he reached theconclusion that Gurdjieff was an unskilled writer than Meetings with RemarkableMen forced him to revise his opinion. His attempts to resolve these - and other- contradictions led him to conclude that Gurdjieff intended to create conflictand confusion. It was his way of teaching.The lunches and dinners continued daily until Walker left. When he went to saygoodbye, Gurdjieff told him to henceforth regard this flat as his own home, andoffered to send him a regular supply of vodka to England. Walker was surprisedby the rush of affection he felt as he shook hands.That year Gurdjieff returned to America once more, and took over Ouspensky's NewYork group. There he made much the same kind of impact that he made on Walker inParis - it is described by Irmis B. Popoff in her book Gurdjieff - and gave thesame kind of vast and interminable meals.But when Walker saw Gurdjieff in Paris again the following spring, he could seethat his health was failing - undoubtedly under the burden of vast quantities ofrich food and strong liquor. His breathing was laboured and his lips had a bluetinge. Walker diagnosed fluid in the abdomen and advised an operation to get ridof it. Gurdjieff thanked him, but said he was awaiting the arrival of a new drugfrom America.Bennett, who now ran his own teaching group at Combe Springs in Surrey, alsospent much time with Gurdjieff in Paris. Gurdjieff's telepathic powers seemed tobe unimpaired, and one morning, in a cafe, he dictated to Bennett anadvertisement for the forthcoming edition of Beelzebub without opening hismouth. On Saturday 22 October, Bennett found him sitting in a cafÃ© looking illand tired, but Gurdjieff nevertheless made comments that indicated that heexpected to live for at least another five years.When the American doctor arrived four days later, however, he immediatelyordered Gurdjieff to be removed to the American Hospital. His blood pressure wasso high that it was impossible to inject serum. The liquid was finally drainedfrom his stomach, but it had been left too late. On 29 October, 1949, Gurdjieffdied. The autopsy revealed that he had been keeping himself alive by sheerwill-power and vitality; the state of his inner organs was so bad that he shouldhave died years earlier. Gurdjieff was an excellent advertisement for his ownbelief that a man lives by his powers of concentration."},{"pageContent":"SevenWHAT WENT WRONG?Clearly something went wrong - both for Ouspensky and Gurdjieff. Ouspensky drankhimself to death; Gurdjieff ate and drank himself to death. And althoughGurdjieff's end was less anticlimactic than Ouspensky's, photographs takenduring his last years confirm the impression of visitors who came to see himfrom England and America: that there was a touch of sadness about him.In the case of Ouspensky, the question of what went wrong is easier to answer.Mystical experiences like the one on the Sea of Marmora confirmed his feelingthat man could achieve a higher level of consciousness - that there is somethingessentially false about our everyday consciousness. As a man with training inscience and mathematics, he shared the feeling of his contemporaries that mancan rise 'on stepping stones of his dead selves to higher things'. Hisexperiments with nitrous oxide seemed to support this. They confirmed beyond alldoubt that 'higher consciousness' existed, and could, to some extent, besummoned at will. But Ouspensky's travels in the East were a disappointment; hefailed to find what he was looking for.Then he met Gurdjieff and became convinced that he was a man who 'knew'. Andwhat Gurdjieff had to teach struck Ouspensky as appallingly true. The so-called'individual' is not one self, but hundreds. His state of consciousness isactually a state of hypnotic sleep. He is virtually a machine. If he wishes toescape these limitations, it must be done by constant self-observation, byself-remembering, and by 'super-effort' or 'intentional suffering'.It sounds as if all this is an excellent foundation on which to build adeliberate assault on the bastions of higher consciousness. Then what wentwrong?In order to grasp this, we must glance briefly at the history of the quest for'higher consciousness' in the past two and a half centuries. From the point ofview of man's intellectual evolution, the invention of the novel in themid-eighteenth century is of inestimable importance. Samuel Richardson's Pamela(1740), a novel about the attempted seduction of a servant girl, taught men todaydream. Within a year or so, Europe had become 'a nation of readers'. Novelswere a magic carpet that carried you away into other people's lives. Vastnumbers of men and women - particularly women - who had accepted the boredom oftheir everyday lives and devoted their spare time to sewing cushion covers, nowplunged into the exciting worlds of Rousseau, Goethe, Horace Walpole, 'Monk'Lewis, Mrs Radcliffe - worlds of romance, adultery, seduction and rape.Goethe, whose novel The Sorrows of Young Werther (1771) had been immenselyinfluential (even causing an epidemic of suicides), was also aware of somethingthat earlier writers had scarcely noticed: the beauties of nature. Mountains andforests and lakes became part of the new 'romantic' consciousness. In England,Wordsworth and Coleridge - and then Byron and Shelley - followed his example.Wordsworth had been experiencing 'mystical' states since childhood. So hadWilliam Blake. It is in Blake that we can see most clearly the danger of thisnew romantic consciousness. In The Land of Dreams' the child asks his widowedfather:'Father, O Father! what do we here'In this land of unbelief and fear?'The Land of Dreams is better far,'Above the light of the Morning Star.'This rejection of the 'real world' and preference for the Land of Dreams is ahighly dangerous state of mind, which leads to defeat and despair. And this wasthe major problem for all those poets, novelists and musicians who wanted theirwork to reflect the 'higher reality' of the Land of Dreams. They found realitytoo much for them, and died in droves.By the end of the century - when Ouspensky was a young man - so many of these'Outsider' artists had died young or committed suicide or gone mad that itbecame part of the romantic mythology that if you were a 'sensitive plant' youwere virtually inviting an early death. Thomas Mann wrote novels in which deathand intellectuality are always linked together, while Hermann Hesse's heroes goin search of 'higher consciousness' only to end by recognizing that it is not tobe found in this 'land of unbelief and fear'.In spite of his scientific temperament, Ouspensky was cast in the mould of aHesse hero. He made the 'journey to the East' and returned empty-handed. Hetried 'experimental mysticism' with the aid of dental gas, but found himselfoverwhelmed by romantic agony as he had to return to this 'wooden world',grinding on like some creaking mill. Then Gurdjieff held out new hope. Sheereffort could keep at bay the moods of romantic despair or the 'triviality ofeverydayness'. Practising self-remembering, Ouspensky found that he could wanderaround St Petersburg at night and sense the history of the houses as if theywere living beings. He was able to induce moods of self-remembering in which heactually saw other people as sleepwalkers surrounded by their dreams. And on oneoccasion, he seemed on the point of breaking through to a new level of freedombefore someone walked into the room and interrupted him. Gurdjieff's ability tocommunicate with him telepathically demonstrated that Gurdjieff had achievedcertain 'magical' powers. This was also Ouspensky's aim.What was self-evident was that the human mind has the power to 'hold' far higherlevels of vital energy than are called upon in our everyday lives. If we couldactually reach a high enough level of vitality and optimism, it would be sopowerful that it would effect a kind of alchemical transformation of our innerbeing, a process of 'fusing'. But every time we begin to approach this level, we'leak' and allow the energy to escape. Ouspensky could see that if he couldlearn to close those inner 'valves' that permit the energy to leak away, hecould raise himself permanently to a higher level.But he needed peace and security. Instead, he was uprooted and forced to becomea wanderer in foreign lands. It was a traumatic experience for a gentleromantic. Fortunately, fate came to his rescue by making the West aware ofTertium Organum. He was welcomed in London; he became a celebrity. The storyshould now have had a happy ending. Unfortunately, Ouspensky's own temperamentwas the major obstacle to this. He had drunk deeply of the pessimistic aspectsof Gurdjieff s doctrine: human beings are hopelessly self-divided; they arehypnotized sheep waiting for the butcher's knife. There can be no doubt thatOuspensky would have been a happier man if, instead of meeting Gurdjieff, he hadmet Rudolf Steiner, the Austrian mystic. Steiner would have taught him that the'spirit world' lies inside us, and that we are all capable of 'access to higherworlds'. In fact, Gurdjieff had on Ouspensky much the same effect that thegloomy Schopenhauer had on Nietzsche: he gave his thinking an overwhelminglypessimistic tinge. In The Psychology of Man's Possible Evolution, the first bookin which Ouspensky tried to express what he had learned from Gurdjieff, all theemphasis is on human weakness and on man's inability to 'do'.Gurdjieff himself was slightly better off, but not much. He had, in fact, seenthe true solution to the problem that had killed off so many romantic Outsiders.The more we feel that the world is a 'land of unbelief and fear' or a 'dim vastvale of tears' or a 'misty dream' the more we are predisposed to run away fromit. And this attitude puts us into a state of 'negative feedback': that is, ournegative expectations cause us to 'leak', and the leakage confirms our pessimismby making it seem self-evident that life is a bore.Gurdjieff had discovered that willed effort can close our inner leaks and raiseour inner pressure. But in order to truly reverse the negative feedback process,a man would need to be driven by a certain optimism, a sense of what G.K.Chesterton called 'absurd good news'; in other words, he would need to feel thatsuch an effort is worthwhile. But here Gurdjieff's position was closer to thatof Ouspensky. He was basically concerned - one might say obsessed - by what iswrong with people. His notion of the organ Kundabuffer, implanted in humanbeings to make them see illusion as reality, was a form of the legend ofOriginal Sin. In his earliest piece of writing, Herald of Coming Good, hedefines his original purpose as an attempt to prevent in himself themanifestations of 'Tzvarnoharno', something caused by the evil actions of commonpeople, which leads to the destruction of those who would benefit humanity. AndBeelzebub's Tales to his Grandson is an attempt to make people see what is wrongwith them. The aim, according to Bennett, is to arouse feeling rather thanthought, to create inner conflict that will carry readers beyond theirintellectual processes.Stanley Nott was convinced that this was what was wrong with Ouspensky. Hewanted to turn Gurdjieff's teaching into an intellectual system. But Gurdjieffis saying - rather like Bergson - that intellect always misses the point, andthat real understanding involves somehow 'shaking the mind awake'.This is true - as far as it goes. But in trying to shake people out of oldhabits through inner conflict and 'intentional suffering', Gurdjieff was alsomissing the point.The basic point is fairly simple. In those positive moods that Wordsworthdescribes in the 'Intimations of Immortality' ode, moods when the earth seems'apparelled in celestial light', we experience an extremely clear and powerfulsense that the world is a wonderful and fascinating place, and that we should beextremely grateful to be alive. We can see that it is marvellously rich andcomplex. But in order to perceive this, we need to be in a state of bubblingvitality. And our main problem is that our vitality leaks away too easily,leaving us too tired to appreciate this fascinating complexity - just as it ishard to read philosophy when you are tired.Abraham Maslow tells a story of a marine who had been in the Pacific withoutseeing a woman, and, when he returned to base, saw a nurse and instantly had a'peak experience' - because he suddenly realized with tremendous force thatwomen are different from men. This is 'newness' (Browning captures it in hisphrase: 'How strange it seems, and new', and Ezra Pound meant the same thingwhen he called one of his books Make It New). Newness is the recognition ofdifference: that what you thought was 'the same' is not the same at all. What apoet sees on a spring morning is 'difference'. But as we grow tired - ordiscouraged - our senses smooth out the difference into sameness.In fact this is really the basic problem of human existence. Habit causes us to'silt up' like a river, until what was once narrow and fast becomes meanderingand slow. This is what Wordsworth means when he complains that 'shades of theprison house' begin to close on us as we get older. Wordsworth's early poems -for example, the sonnet on Westminster Bridge - are full of 'newness', while thelater poems are somehow 'tired'.But we have already noted Maslow's important discovery that when he talked tohis students about 'peak experiences', they began remembering peak experiencesthey had previously forgotten about. And as they began talking to one anotherabout peak experiences, they began having peak experiences all the time.The reason is obvious. The peak experience is a perception of difference. Youlook at some 'familiar' object and see it as new and strange. And you know thatthis perception is genuine, not some illusion. In fact, Ouspensky had graspedthis vital insight in the passage about the factory chimneys in Tertium Organum(see p.33).This is the 'spring morning' feeling. You see that everything is much strangerand more complex than your normal perception reveals. And you see that this isso. Like Maslow's marine, you are perceiving a real 'difference'. This is whypeople who have had peak experiences can go on repeating them: because it issimply a matter of reminding yourself of something you have already seen andwhich you know to be real. In this sense, it is like any other 'recognition'that suddenly dawns on you - for example, the recognition of the greatness ofsome composer or artist whom you had formerly found difficult orincomprehensible; or the recognition of how to solve a certain problem. Oncesuch a recognition 'dawns', it is easy to re-establish contact with it, becauseit is there, like some possession, waiting for you to return to it.Unfortunately, Ouspensky was not in a position to take advantage of this simple'law of consciousness', because his basic assumptions were negative. So all hisemphasis on self-remembering, self-observation, super-effort, was no moreeffective than his wife's altogether vaguer notions about the importance ofreligious insights. Whenever he felt tired, he was back to square one. And yearsof going back to square one finally convinced him that all his insights intohuman mechanicalness were useless, and that 'the System' had failed him.He had failed to grasp a simple truth. If you feel tired but optimistic, a shortrest will refresh you and re-charge your batteries. If you feel tired andpessimistic, even a sleep may leave you feeling as tired as ever.Again, consider what happens when something goes wrong, and you put it right.'Putting it right' has the effect of making you feel delighted that things are'back to normal', and that 'normality' is a highly desirable state. Yet whenthings are normal, and have been normal for a long time, we take normality forgranted; in fact, we may even find it boring. The act of 'putting somethingright' has the interesting effect of making you see 'normality' as delightful,in fact, it momentarily lifts you into a perception of 'newness', of'difference', and once again raises you to the perception that reality isinfinitely fascinating.To recognize this is to recognize that our 'normal' perception has a strongpessimistic component, a kind of 'free-floating anxiety', making us aware of thetruth of William James's observation that, for much of the time, we 'feel as ifa sort of cloud weighed upon us, keeping us below our highest notch in clearnessin discernment, sureness in reasoning, or firmness in deciding'.Now this observation occurs in the essay called 'The Energies of Man' which hasbeen discussed earlier in this book, and which makes clear the point thatGurdjieff and James are talking about the same thing: 'second wind' or 'vitalreserves'. It is also plain that we can break through to 'second wind' by adeliberate effort of will. James appears to be saying the same thing asGurdjieff: that we are diseased, and that the disease is called Original Sin (orKundabuffer). But there is an important difference. James recognizes that ournegativity is a kind of 'cloud' weighing upon us. James was an optimistic kindof person and, like G.K. Chesterton, he recognized that the basis of reality is'absurd good news'.What all this amounts to is the recognition that both Gurdjieff and Ouspenskywere inclined to make the same mistake: they over-emphasized the idea ofsuper-effort or intentional suffering. Beyond a certain point, super-efforttends to be counterproductive: it produces fatigue and pessimism.Consider what happens when you receive some good news, or some anticipatedcrisis evaporates. There is a sudden perception that the world is delightful.And this transfers itself to your subconscious mind, so that even an hour or solater, when you have forgotten about the crisis, you remain in a state ofbubbling vitality, as if a kind of 'underfloor lighting' had been switched on.If we could train ourselves to keep the underfloor lighting switched on, ourlives would become immensely satisfying and productive.The odd thing is that every time we experience 'absurd good news', we see thatit is an objective fact, and that consequently, there is no earthly reason why,with a little effort, it should not become a permanent state.Does this mean that no effort is necessary? Clearly not. Our real problem is ourinbuilt tendency to 'leak', to allow our inner pressure to sink unnoticed. InThe War Against Sleep I expressed the problem in the sentence: 'Human beings arelike grandfather clocks driven by watchsprings.' But the real trouble is lack ofinner pressure - leakage'.What prevents leakage? Focusing the attention. The Zen master Ikkyu was onceasked by a workman to write something on his slate; Ikkyu wrote the word'Attention.' The workman looked disappointed. 'Couldn't you write somethingelse?' Ikkyu wrote: 'Attention, attention.' The workman asked: 'What doesattention mean?', and Ikkyu replied: 'Attention means attention.'He could have replied: 'Attention means focusing your energies and closing yourleaks, so you are in a higher energy state.'Leakage keeps us in a constant state of low inner pressure. But in order to doanything well, you require high inner pressure.Some personal remarks on my own experience of 'the method' may clarify thepoint. I came upon Ouspensky's In Search of the Miraculous and Kenneth Walker'sVenture with Ideas in 1951, when I was 20. They filled me with excitement. Butat that time, I had already discovered the basic method for the control ofconsciousness. Like many teenagers, I had suffered a great deal from 'lifefailure', the feeling that life is meaningless and pointless, and that theefforts it demands of us are a waste of time. For a great deal of the time, myeveryday life seemed grey and dull. I craved 'satisfaction', a higher quality oflife, yet felt that this was a purely biological craving that did nothing toredeem life from meaninglessness. In fact, life seemed so meaningless that itseemed a waste of time even to kill myself. Eliot's Hollow Men seemed to me toexpress the basic truth about human existence. So did Auden's lines:Put the car away; when life failsWhat's the good of going to Wales?But in an essay of T.S. Eliot I came upon a reference to the Bhagavad Gita, andwhen I came upon a new translation of it - by Isherwood - in the local bookshop,I bought it.The Gita brought about a total change of attitude. To begin with, it persuadedme to sit cross-legged on the floor, focusing my attention. There were timeswhen I concentrated so hard that I went red in the face. But I suddenlydiscovered, to my astonishment, that the sense of futility and greyness hadvanished. The world suddenly became so interesting that I would often pause tolook at a privet leaf, or at a cracked windowsill.What had happened is obvious. Teenage depression had led to constant 'leakage'and negative feedback. Perception is 'intentional'; in order to perceiveanything, you have to throw your attention at it like a javelin. The strength ofmy throwing arm had become so enfeebled that the javelin was falling at my feet,instead of impaling its object. Reading poetry and listening to music hadalleviated the problem, but even if I achieved a state of total affirmation, ithad vanished by the following day. Sitting cross-legged and concentrating taughtme that it did not have to vanish.At this point, life suddenly became more complicated. I married and became afather, and that meant I had no time for sitting cross-legged. By the time Icame home from the factory, I was exhausted. So I ceased to 'meditate'.Fortunately, this was the period when I came upon Gurdjieff and Ouspensky. InSearch of the Miraculous was a tremendous mental stimulus. Reading it requiredless effort than concentrating, but it could restore that sense of high innerpressure, and restore my sense of purpose. And when, three years later, I wrotemy first book. The Outsider, it was inevitable that Gurdjieff and Ouspenskyshould figure prominently.I had no doubt then - and still have no doubt - that Gurdjieff was perhaps thegreatest man of the twentieth century. I became a friend of Kenneth Walker, andwhat he told me confirmed that impression. Yet I never felt that Walker himselfhad achieved any high degree of self-discipline. And I continued to feel this insubsequent years when I met followers of Gurdjieff and Ouspensky. Bennett struckme as altogether more disciplined, yet oddly narrow. And I found it totallyincomprehensible that he had turned from Gurdjieff to Pakh Subuh, and thenbecame a Catholic convert. That seemed to demonstrate once and for all that, inspite of having read Beelzebub a dozen times, he still had no idea of whatGurdjieff was talking about. In retrospect, I am inclined to wonder whether,like Ouspensky, Bennett felt that the System had failed him.Another Ouspensky disciple whom I came to like and admire - and who shall remainnameless - was not even sure of the difference between 'essence' and'personality'; he thought personality was the 'true self' and essence the 'falseself'.Clearly, then, Gurdjieff had not succeeded in stamping his genius on any of hisfollowers - with the exception of Ouspensky, who already possessed his owngenius.When I came to write The War Against Sleep - in 1979 - I tried hard to put myfinger on what had gone wrong, particularly in the last chapter, 'Gurdjieffversus Ouspensky?' I saw Ouspensky's problem as his pessimism, and his failureto grasp the 'absurd good news' experience. And I accurately characterizedGurdjieff's problem as his overemphasis on super-effort. Yet although it seemsto me that I have clearly stated 'what went wrong', I have not tried hard enoughto state how it could have been put right.Let me try again.'Peak experiences' involve the sense of 'difference' and 'newness'. Most seriousmodern literature seems to be based on what I have called the 'fallacy ofinsignificance', the feeling that intelligent people are bound to be weak andneurotic, and that, as Yeats said, 'We have not begun to live until we haveconceived of life as tragedy.' That, in short, 'you can't win'. The peakexperience is a sudden overwhelming certainty that you can win.In a book called Beyond the Occult, I have suggested that it is helpful todistinguish seven basis levels of human consciousness.If we regard deep sleep as Level 0, then Level 1 would be dreaming. Level 2 isthe level you experience when you wake up in the middle of the night from a deepsleep: a kind of passive, disoriented consciousness. We also experience thiswhen we are very tired, and we look at things without actually 'seeing' them.You could say there is no 'I' present.Level 3 is the level at which 'I' emerges, but at which you still feel low anddull. I spent much of my teens in Level 3. Shaw called it 'life failure', andCamus 'the absurd'; it is the feeling that reality is quite meaningless initself, and that we impose meanings on it.Level 4 is our normal, everyday consciousness. And in the lower end of Level 4,life still seems appallingly hard work. Emily Bronte captures it in the poemthat begins:Does the road wind uphill all the way?Right to the very end.But about halfway up Level 4, we begin to experience an odd sense of strengthand optimism, a feeling that obstacles can be overcome and that life can bedelightful after all. At the top end of 'everyday consciousness', we feel oddlycertain that 'you can win'.Maslow's 'peak experience' - that sudden bubbling feeling of total happiness -might be regarded as a kind of spark that leaps the gap between Levels 4 and 5.Level 5 is what I have called 'spring morning consciousness', the perception of'newness' and 'difference' the feeling that the world is infinitely fascinatingafter all.Such feelings seldom last long. But when they do, they constitute virtually anew level of consciousness - what J.B. Priestley calls 'magic'. A child onChristmas Day may experience 'magic'; so may a couple on honeymoon. According toYeats, it is the feeling Paris experienced in Helen's arms for the first time:'What were all the world's alarms?' - a feeling that there is no problem thatcannot be overcome.Level 7 is what I have called 'Faculty X' that curious ability we experience incertain moments to grasp the reality of other times and places. Proustexperienced it (and described it in Swann's Way) when he tasted a small cakedipped in herb tea and suddenly recalled, with tremendous clarity, his childhoodin a French village. Arnold Toynbee described the feeling many times in hisStudy of History. In Faculty X, we seem to transcend time. If human beings couldachieve Faculty X, their whole lives would become as accessible to them as thepast hour.There is, in fact, a Level 8; Ouspensky experienced it with nitrous oxide. Thisis 'mystical' consciousness in which we become aware that everything in theuniverse is connected together.If we ignore Level 8, and concentrate on the seven levels of ordinaryconsciousness, we see that our everyday consciousness. Level 4, is preciselyhalfway up the scale. Moreover, the level at which we begin to feel 'you canwin' is precisely halfway up Level 4, at 3Â½. Of course, we may regard the sevenlevels as completely arbitrary - for example, if we included the so-calledhypnogogic states on the verge of sleeping and waking, there could easily beeight levels - yet it is still of practical significance to consider Level 3Â½ asthe 'halfway mark'. For we see that the lower levels are the levels in which wefeel that life is futile and meaningless, or tragically difficult. When Sartresays: 'Man is a useless passion' he is merely stating the typical outlook ofLevel 3.Up to Level 3Â½, life is uphill work. But beyond that, it becomes immenselyexciting: the peak experience, spring morning consciousness, magicconsciousness, Faculty X, mystical consciousness . . . And if we become clearlyaware that what keeps us below Level 3Â½ is simply 'leakage' and the pessimismthat comes from negative feedback - the tendency to feel gloomy because we seelife as gloomy, so that disaster becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy - we canalso glimpse a magnificent possibility: that there is no good reason why a fewhuman beings should not 'close their inner valves', maintain a higher level ofinner pressure, and remain permanently above Level 3Â½. I have succeeded in doingit for days at a time, and only regret the number of years I have wasted becauseI was unaware that it could be done.Now interestingly enough, it is clear that Ouspensky finally becamedisillusioned with the System because he suddenly recognized this samepossibility. When, during his last period at Lyne, he told his pupils that theyshould have a straightforward, everyday aim, and that only by working alone canone make progress, he was recognizing that a life devoted to the System tends tobecome as narrow as a life devoted to daily attendance at church. As Walkerobserved, the London followers had become too rigid and grim. Maslow had alsorecognized that the people he called 'self-actualizers' have straightforward,everyday aims like other people, but they pour their heart and soul into theseeveryday aims. A self-actualizer does not have to be a Beethoven or aMichelangelo. It may be a man who takes enormous pleasure in putting ships inbottles or collecting stamps. Maslow cites a woman who was a marvellous motherand who, when she was too old to have more children, adopted children so shecould do 'what she was good at'. To do anything with this kind of enthusiasm andconviction recharges our vital batteries. Hermann Hesse makes his narratorremark, in Journey to the East, 'I, whose calling was only that of a violinistand storyteller, was responsible for the provision of music for our group, and Ithen discovered how a long time devoted to small details exalts us and increasesour strength' (my italics). It causes us to make contact with what GranvilleBarker calls 'the Secret Life', the wellsprings of vitality deep inside us. Aswe have seen, Maslow even cured a girl suffering from exhaustion and lifefailure by advising her to go to night school to study a subject that reallyinterested her. As soon as we do anything with enthusiasm, with conviction, withtotal attention, life takes on a 'real' quality. Our greatest human mistake isto feel that certain things do not deserve enthusiastic attention. We have tolearn that anything done with enthusiastic attention exalts us and increases ourstrength.Now in fact, it is relatively easy to recharge our vital batteries. Let mesuggest, for example, that if you have been sitting still for some time, readingthis book, you bend your arms and tense your shoulder muscles, or simply yawnand stretch. Note the way that this causes a feeling of pleasure to ripplethrough your muscles. Next, try shutting your eyes very tight as you do it, andtwisting up your face into a grimace. Again, you notice that odd 'ripple' ofenergy and pleasure. In fact, the face muscles play an important part in thecontrol of energy, and this is one of the easiest methods of summoning a minorpeak experience.There are other methods - for example, concentrating intently on a pen help upagainst the ceiling, making a tremendous effort, then relaxing until you becomeaware of the whole wall, then concentrating again . . .Gurdjieff once remarked that there is a vast reservoir of universal energy whichis accessible to us, and that with the right kind of effort, we can placeourselves in touch with this energy. Anton Mesmer also believed that there are'tides' of universal energy that sweep through our bodies, keeping us healthy.(Wilhelm Reich called it 'orgone energy'.) If we become 'blocked', we becomeunhealthy. But if you concentrate hard, using your face muscles, and bracingyour arms, you can experience a sensation of driving the energies down throughyour body. If you continue to do this for a quarter of an hour or so - forexample, on a train journey when you have nothing better to do - you begin toexperience a curiously 'wide-awake' feeling, and everything you look at seems'more interesting'.[1] It should be emphasized, in passing, that these exercisescan be quite unobtrusive, so that fellow passengers would not even notice.The most useful time of all, I have found, is the middle of the night, if Ihappen to be lying awake. It is important to recognize that our usual 'passive'consciousness is not a particularly desirable state, and that counting sheep isnot necessarily the best way to utilize the mind. I find that, in the middle ofthe night, five minutes of 'concentration exercises' begin to produce activepleasure, as I feel the energy being driven down through my body. Sometimes thepleasure is so great that I want to stay awake. But half an hour or so of'concentration' brings a pleasant tiredness, and I find that I then drift intosleep with a curious sense of happiness. Moreover, once I have achieved this oddsense of control over myself, it becomes possible to 'navigate' one's way intodreams - the phrase is obscure, but it is the best I can do - so that plunginginto sleep has a controlled quality, like diving into a pool; there areoccasions when the sensation is so pleasant that I enjoy drifting in and out ofsleep like someone being swept through the waves on a surfboard. I also observethat, after a night of this kind of sleep, I experience a high level of mentalenergy, and as I write, am aware that an act of sudden 'attention' can produce aflash of pure delight.This seems to me to be one of the basic secrets. This deliberate control ofenergy makes me aware that consciousness was never intended to be passive, andthat the solving of problems, which most of us regard as one of the morealarming aspects of life, can and should be a thoroughly enjoyable activity. Butwe are too passive. We fail to realize that when we experience a 'sinkingfeeling' of boredom or depression, this has nothing to do with external reality;it is a kind of confidence trick played on us by our 'robot'. It is due, quitesimply, to lack of inner pressure, lack of energy. The water has been allowed tosink too low in the well, and it takes a great many strokes on the pump to bringit to the surface. But the act of concentrating, of driving the energies throughthe body, brings these energies to the surface, and life is suddenly fascinatingand meaningful again.In short, we allow the robot to get away with far too much. That is the essenceof Gurdjieff's message.What seems absurd is that Ouspensky failed to grasp that he was applying hisremarkable will-power in the wrong direction. He was like a man trying to pushopen a door that opens the other way. 'Experimental Mysticism' is the fullestdescription of Level 8 on record. And Ouspensky's central recognition in thisstate is that everything in the universe is connected - which, in turn, isChesterton's 'absurd good news'. Our 'normal' consciousness divides things. Itis like a narrow flashlight beam that plays over objects in a darkened room, butcan never illuminate the room as a whole. This means that human beings sufferfrom a kind of permanent 'tunnel vision', a 'certain blindness'. The mostextreme form of this tunnel vision is when we are very tired and depressed (itmight be a good idea to substitute the word 'depressurized', for this makes thenature of the problem more obvious), and things around us look somehowmeaningless, 'merely themselves'. This is Level 3, what Sartre called 'nausea',and it makes an extraordinary impression of truth and authenticity. Yet it israther like believing that a picture gallery in the dark has no pictures in it.The moment our inner pressure carries us up to Level 3Â½, we become aware that wecan choose between these two views: 'nausea' and meaning.Our problem is that as soon as we allow ourselves to become 'depressurized' themeaning vanishes and 'nausea' seems to be the only reality. When childrenexperience such states, they are defenceless. Adults, fortunately, have a lineof defence: the intellect. Many Victorians had a remarkable grasp of thisinsight, and Matthew Arnold expressed it in a poem called 'Morality':We cannot kindle when we willThe fire which in the heart resides.The spirit bloweth and is still;In mystery our soul abides;But tasks in hours of insight willedCan be through hours of gloom fulfilled.Once a poet has actually seen this meaning he can, with a certain amount ofstubbornness and intellectual toughness, hang on to it. It could be compared tonavigating in a fog with a compass rather than by the stars.The man who stands the best chance of fighting his way back into the state ofinsight is the one who has the best memory for the stars. And a man who has seenthe stars a dozen times will obviously have a better memory for them than a manwho has only seen them once or twice. And a man who has seen them hundreds oftimes can never forget them or doubt their existence. This is why we attach suchimmense importance to these states of 'wider consciousness', and will purchasethem at high cost to our health, or even to our lives. The artist or poet whochooses poverty and 'outsiderism' to comfort and security is an example. So isthe monk and the yogi. So, unfortunately, is the alcoholic and drug addict andrapist.Ouspensky's repeated experience of Level 8 - described in 'ExperimentalMysticism' - should have provided him with a very good working knowledge of thestars. The recognition that 'everything is connected' is a recognition thatthere is an 'overall meaning', and that it should therefore be possible for manto achieve it. Ouspensky had an obscure sense that it was somehow wrong to usenitrous oxide to obtain this knowledge, and he was correct. You could say thathe had used a balloon to get to heaven when he should have been building aladder - a ladder of words and concepts - that others could have used after him.Moreover, he had not sufficiently strengthened his sense of reality to be ableto cope with the 'landing'. Instead of feeling that everyday reality containsall these hidden meanings, these immense vistas of 'connectedness', he couldonly groan with anguish, like a child who wants Christmas to go on forever. Thiswas the price that he paid for his 'short cut'.When Ouspensky discovered Gurdjieff, though, it seemed that now, at last, he hadhis 'ladder', a means of achieving higher states of consciousness throughordinary conscious effort. His certainty that he had stumbled upon a completelynew approach to the problem of higher consciousness was increased by some ofGurdjieff's odder and more paradoxical ideas - such as that knowledge is'material', and therefore cannot be shared out indefinitely, or that humanbeings are 'food of the moon'. After his 'short cut' with nitrous oxide, he nowwent to the opposite extreme, and became entrenched in a kind of gleefulpragmatism. His total refusal to countenance anything that sounded like'mysticism' has something in common with Marx's view that religion is the opiumof the people. In effect, Ouspensky had become a kind of 'spiritual Marxist'.This attitude certainly made an immense impact on his followers in London, andlater in America, producing the impression that he had the answer. In effect, heordered everyone to toe the party line or else . . . Yet this attitude was thereverse of what he had stood for in Tertium Organum and A New Model of theUniverse. It seems incredible that this 'Marxist' Ouspensky could have allowedhimself to publish the chapter on Notre Dame, the Pyramids and the Sphinx, whichsound as if they have been written by some disciple of Madame Blavatsky.Significantly, of course, Gurdjieff himself was anything but a 'spiritualMarxist'. His approach remained fundamentally religious. This was the basicreason why Ouspensky had to renounce him. Ouspensky felt that he had takenGurdjieff's System and discarded the nonsense. Religion and mysticism were trapsfor the woolly-minded. He had no time for such 'opium'.Yet by the time he went to America, it had become clear to Ouspensky that hisown 'Marxianized' version of the System was getting him nowhere. It left himtrapped in 'tunnel vision' and only strong alcohol could enable him to 'openup'. Gurdjieff never made the same mistake: he ate, drank, fornicated andprayed, and remained a well-rounded human being. If we are to believe Beelzebub,the only thing he lacked was that deep, Chestertonian conviction of 'absurd goodnews'.When Madame Ouspensky began to encourage the study of religious texts, Ouspenskyallowed her to do so, for he was now aware of the shortcomings of his ownapproach. Yet this was a total reversal of what he had believed when he came toEngland in 1921, when such dilution of the System would have been harshlytreated. And finally, as Nott has recorded, he felt like abandoning the Systemaltogether and going off once more in search of 'secret doctrines' and hiddenknowledge. His attempt to 'Marxianize' the System had left him intellectuallybankrupt.According to disciples who were with him in the last months of his life,Ouspensky achieved peace at the end. The 'tunnel vision' disappeared as deathapproached, and he probably felt that his attempt to intellectualize the Systemhad not been such a waste of time after all. At least it had produced amasterpiece, in his record of his years with Gurdjieff, a book in which all hisearly clarity, brilliance and honesty combined to produce the perfectintroduction to Gurdjieff's ideas. Without In Search of the Miraculous, 'the waragainst sleep' would certainly have made very little headway in the twentiethcentury, which has no time to get to grips with a work like Beelzebub's Tales.Half a century later, Ouspensky's book remains by far the best introduction toGurdjieff.It is a pity that Ouspensky never produced such an excellent introduction toOuspensky. Tertium Organum and A New Model of the Universe both strike us as anodd mixture of brilliance and confusion. But if he had never written anythingelse, they would make us aware that Ouspensky was a powerful and original mind,comparable to Soloviev, Rozanov, Berdyaev and other major Russian thinkers.Instead posterity will continue to regard him as another man's interpreter.Still, if the accounts of the serenity of his final days are accurate, it may bethat this is how he would have preferred to be remembered."},{"pageContent":"INDEXAdhyar 17-18All and Everything: Beelzebub's Tales to hisGrandson102,105,107,112,119,120,125,130,139,140Anthroposophy 45-6art 46-7,58Bennett, J.G. 9,17,18,55-6,69-70,81,87Bhagavad Gita129-30Blake, William 122Blavatsky, Helena 18Bragdon, Claude 87-8,90,109Bucke, R.M. 35Camus, Albert 42-3capturing insights 55-7Ceylon (Sri Lanka) 18chaos theory 53Collin, Rodney 10,111,116cosmic consciousness 35cosmology, Gurdjieff's 67-8,77Law of Seven 68Law of Three 68de Beauvoir, Simone 43dÃ©jÃ  vu 12Dostoevsky 20early years, Ouspensky's 10-15energy 134-5Enneagram 68-9essence 66,131Eternal Recurrence 13,19,26,73,114excitement 51ffExperimental Mysticism 47-9,136,138Four Aspects of Man 66-7Fourth Dimension 30-1Fourth Dimension, The9Fourth Way 65-6,99'Fragments of an Unknown Teaching' 78; see also In Search of the Miraculousfree will 59-60Goethe 122Gurdjieff, George Ivanovich 6,9-10,24-7,58and art 46-7background 44-6,car crash 102-4,cosmology 67-9,death 119-20,difference with Ouspensky 63,effect on Ouspensky 124-5,and freedom 58-9,intellectual system 65-83,London 1922 93-4,meeting with Ouspensky 24,41,46-64,72-83,138,mistakes 121-41,opinion of Ouspensky 107,Paris 1923 94,100-1,post Ouspensky's death 116-20,physical effort 95,as teacher 27,46-64,72-83,and sex 45,94,US trip 101-2and war 62Hartmann 81-2,86,101Herald of Coming Good ,117,125Hesse, Hermann 123higher consciousness 122-4Hinton, C.H. 29-30,31-2In Search of the Miraculous61,129,130,139India 17intentional suffering 66,128James, William 38-40,47,48-9,81,127-8Journey through this World: the Second Journeyof a Pupil105ff,112Jung 91Kant 29, 32Law of Seven 68Law of Three 68levels of consciousness 131-3livingness 54-5love 56, 61Madame Ouspensky 98-9,105,108-9,111,112,113,116-17,139Mansfield, Katherine 72,101Maslow, Abraham 42,71,125-6,134mathematical relations 50-1Meetings with Remarkable Men45,119Mesmer, Anton 135mother, Ouspensky's 14muscles 134-5mysticism 35,36Neill, A.S. 92New Age, The17,84New Model of the Universe, A12,16,36,47,60,63,83,97,112,138,140Nicoll, Maurice 91-2,95Nott, C.S. 89-90,105-20,125break with Ouspensky 112-13objectivity 29,49-50,58Orage, A.R. 17,84, 89,90,93,94-6,101,109-10,117Our Life with Mr Gurdjieff81Ouspensky,alcoholism 110-11,appearance 25,death 115-16,early years 10-15,emotional weakness 107,later years 105-20,London 1921 onwards 88-9,90-1,96-104,Madame Ouspensky 98-9,105,108,111,112,116-17meeting with Gurdjieff 24,41,46-64,72-83,138,mistakes 121-41,movement 99-100,parents 12-14,remeeting Gurdjieff 86-7,romanticism 11-12,split with Gurdjieff 81-3,97,111,System 97-8,114,vision 23,work 98Outsider, The130parents, Ouspensky's 12-14peak experiences 41,71,126,131perception 31-3,50-6personality 66pessimism 23Principles of Psychology40psychical research 30Psychology of Man's Possible Evolution113Renouvier, Charles 40robot, humans as 59-60,66-7,70-2,93,136romanticism 11-12,16-17,23,58-9,122-3Russia 10-12schooling, Ouspensky's 13self-remembering 41-2,67,121sex 36,60Shaw, G.B. 20,89,107sister, Ouspensky's 15Slade, Henry 30sleep 131spiritualism 30,45Steiner, Rudolf 45,86,124Strange Life of Ivan Osokin, The12-13system 114Talks with a Devil18-23Tertium Organum9,27-9,32,34,35-41,59,87,109,136,138,140Theosophical Society 17Theosophy 45-6time 52-3Tsars 11-12,14-15,76Varieties of Religious Experience, The39-40,47Ventures with Ideas96Walker, Kenneth 10,12,36-7,92,96,118-20,130-1War against Sleep, The128,131Ward, R.H. 50,55Waste Land, The89Winter Palace 14work, according to Gurdjieff 65-6,68-9,71-2,115; see also self-rememberingyoga 25Zarathustra 35Zinaida 13Zollner 30Zvenigorod 11-12"}]
