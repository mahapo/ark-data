I rem ember on e c onvers ation at that time, when I said, 'I f it w ere po ssibl e to acce pt as pr oven that co nscio usne ss ( or, as I sho uld cal l it no w, inte lligence ) can m anif est its elf apar t from the phy sical bo dy, m any other thing s co uld be pr oved.

I realized that manif estatio ns o f supe rnormal psy chology such as tho ught tr ansf erence, cl air voyance , the po ssibil ity of kno wing the futur e, o f looking back into the pas t, and s o on, hav e not be en pr oved.

I found s ome inte resting thing s in that w ay, but the results were very elusive; an d though se veral experime nts w ere su cce ssfu l, it was al mo st im possible to repeat the m."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"I cam e to tw o co ncl usions in the co urse of the se experiments : first, that w e do no t kno w enough abo ut o rdinar y ps ychology; w e canno t study supe rnormal ps ychology, becaus e we do no t kno w no rmal ps ychology.

So I be gan to look for the se schools. I travelled in E urope, E gypt, I ndia, Ce ylon, Turkey and the Near East; but it w as really later, when I had al ready finis hed the se travels , that I m et in R ussia during t he w ar a grou p of p eople w ho w ere s tudying a certain sy stem which came originally fro m East ern sch ools. T his sy stem began with the study of ps ychology, exactl y as I had r ealized it m ust be gin. Th e c hief idea of this system was that we do not use even a small p art of ou r powers and o ur forces. W e hav e in us , so to speak, a v ery big and v ery fine organiz atio n, o nly we do no t kno w ho w to us e it. I n this group the y employed ce rtain oriental m etapho rs, and the y to ld m e that w e hav e in us a l arge ho use full of be autif ul furnitur e, w ith a l ibrary and m any other rooms, but w e live in the bas ement and the kitche n and canno t get out of the m. If pe ople tell us abo ut w hat this ho use has ups tair s we do no t be lieve the m, o r we laugh at the m, o r we cal l it s upe rstitio n or fairy tal es or fables. This system can be div ided into study of the world, o n ce rtain ne w pr incipl es, and study of m an. T he study of the world and s tudy of m an incl ude in the mselves a kind of special languag e. W e try to us e ordinar y words, the same words as we us e in ordinar y co nversatio n, but w e attach a s lightl y dif ferent and m ore pr ecise m eaning to the m. Study of the world, s tudy of the univ erse, is bas ed o n the study of some fundam ental laws which ar e no t g enerally kno wn or recognized in s cience . The tw o chie f laws ar e the Law of Three and the Law of Seven, w hich w ill be explaine d l ater. Include d in this , and ne cessary from this po int o f view, is the pr incipl e of sca le —a principl e which do es no t enter into ordinar y scientif ic s tudy , o r enters very little. The study of m an is closely co nne cte d with the ide a of the evolutio n o f m an, but the evolutio n o f m an m ust be unde rstood in a s lightl y dif ferent w ay from the ordinar y. Ordinar ily the word evolutio n appl ied e ithe r to m an o r to any thing else pr esuppo ses a kind o f m echanical evolutio n; I m ean that ce rtain thing s, by ce rtain kno wn or unkno wn laws, tr ans form into other thing s, and the se other thing s trans form into still others, and so on. But f rom the po int o f v iew of this sy ste m the re is no such e volutio n at al l—I do no t speak in g eneral, but s pecifical ly of man. The evolutio n o f m an, if it occur s, can o nly be the result of kno wledge and e ffort; as long as m an kno ws only what he can kno w in the ordinar y way, the re is no evolutio n f or him and the re ne ver was any evolutio n f or him . Serious study be gins in this system with the study of ps ychology, that is to say with the study of oneself, be caus e ps ychology canno t be studie d,"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"as astronom y can, ou tside on eself . A m an has to study himself . When I was told that, I saw at on ce that we do not have a ny m ethods of s tudying ou rselves and a lrea dy have many wrong i deas about ou rselves . So I rea lized that we m ust get rid of w rong i deas about ou rselves and a t the s ame time find m ethods for s tudying ou rselves . Perhaps you r ealize ho w dif ficul t it is to de fine what is m eant by ps ychology?

You hav e to learn ce rtain m etho ds and pr incipl es and, acco rding to the se principl es and us ing the se m etho ds, you w ill try to see yourselves from a ne w po int o f view . If we be gin to study ourselves we first o f all co me up ag ains t o ne word which w e use m ore than any other and that is the word 'I'.

But in the co urse of study we shal l learn in w hat w ay the y dif fer. For instance, there is an en ormous difference in speed , but we shall s peak m ore about that later. Then the re ar e tw o other functio ns which no system of ordinar y psychology div ides and unde rstands in the right w ay—ins tinctiv e functio n and m oving functio n. Instinctive re fers t o the inner w ork of t he orga nism: dig estion o f food, be ating of the he art, br eathing —the se ar e ins tinctiv e functio ns.

Th ere is a ver y gr eat difference between the two functio ns, since the re is no thing inhe rent in m oving functio ns, and ins tinctiv e functio ns ar e all inhe rent.

But these a re on ly two ou t of four possible s tates. Th e third state of co nscio usness is very strange. If pe ople explain to us what the thir d s tate of conscio usness is, w e be gin to think that w e hav e it. T he thir d s tate can be cal led self - cons cious nes s, and m ost pe ople, if as ked, s ay, 'Certainl y we ar e co nscio us!'

It is a v ery im portant par t of self-study , but w e canno t be gin w ith the co ntr ol of emotions, be caus e we do no t unde rstand e nough abo ut emotio ns. I will explain: what w e can do from the very be ginning of observing the emotional functio n is to try to stop one par ticul ar m anif estatio n in o urselves. We must try to stop the m anif estatio n o f unpl easant e motions. F or m any pe ople this is one of the m ost dif ficul t thing s, be caus e unpl easant e motions ar e expressed s o quickl y and s o easily that y ou canno t catch the m. Y et unl ess you tr y you canno t really observe yourself, so from the very beginning, when ob servi ng em otions, you m ust try to stop the expression of unpl easant e motions. T his is the first step. In this system we cal l all the se unpl easant, v iolent o r de pressing emotio ns by the nam e of negative em otions . As I said, the first step is trying no t to exp ress the se ne gativ e emotio ns; the second s tep is the study of ne gativ e emotions the mselves, m aking lists of the m, finding the ir co nne ctio ns—b ecaus e some of the m ar e simple and s ome ar e compound— and tr ying to unde rstand that the y ar e quite us eless. It sounds strange, but it is very im portant to unde rstand that al l ne gativ e emotions ar e abs olutely us eless: the y do no t serve any us eful pur pose; the y do no t m ake us acquainte d w ith ne w thing s or br ing us nearer to new thing s; the y do no t g ive us energy; the y only waste energy and cr eate unpl easant il lusions. They can e ven de str oy phy sical he alth. Thirdly, af ter a ce rtain am ount o f study and o bservatio n w e m ay co me to the conclusion that we can get rid of n egative em otions, that they are n ot ob ligatory. Here the sy stem helps b ecau se it sh ows that in fact there is n o re al ce ntre fo r n egative emotions, but that the y be long to an ar tificial ce ntr e in us , w hich w e cr eate in chil dho od by im itating pe ople with ne gativ e emotio ns by whom we ar e surrounde d. People even teach children to exp ress negative em otions. Th en children lea rn still more by im itatio n; the y im itate older chil dren, o lder chil dren im itate grown-up people, and so at a very ea rly age they become profes sors of n egative em otions. It is a g reat liberatio n w hen we be gin to unde rstand that the re ar e no obligatory negativ e emotio ns. W e ar e bo rn witho ut the m, but f or some unkno wn reason we teach ourselves negative em otions. Q. To be free from ne gativ e emotio ns, m ust w e be abl e to sto p the m ar ising ? A.

Next come moving and ins tinctiv e functio ns which hav e an appr oximately equal speed which is enormously quicke r than inte llectual . The emotio nal functio n s hould be still quicke r, but g enerally works at abo ut the same speed as the ins tinctiv e functio n. S o m oving, ins tinctiv e"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"and e motional functio ns ar e very m uch quicke r than tho ught, and it is im possible to catch em otions by thought. W hen we are in an em otional state they succeed ea ch other so quickl y that w e hav e no tim e to think. But w e can g et an ide a of the dif ference in s peed by co mparing thinking functio ns with m oving functio ns.

In reality you canno t o bserve quick m ovements . So you s ee, as we ar e no w, real struggle with ne gativ e emotions is a que stion o f the future—n ot a ve ry fa r fu ture, but there are ma ny things w e need to know first and metho ds which w e m ust study .

Quite pr obabl y, be caus e m any ne gativ e emotio ns ar e learned by im itatio n. But some m ay be essential ly in o ur natur e, be caus e our natur e also has dif ferent incl inatio ns one way or ano ther way.

And if on e d oes not allow on eself fears, on e a llow s anger , and if on e d oes not allow ang er, one allows self-pity . Negativ e emotio ns ar e always bas ed o n some kind of p erm ission .

In the m ajor octav e this is shown by the m issing semi-tones; that is why we ar e to ld that it is a pictur e of a cosmic l aw; but this law has no thing to do with m usic. The reason why it is ne cessary to unde rstand the Law of Seven is that it pl ays a ver y important part in all even ts. If there w ere no Law of Seven ever ything in the world w ould g o to its final co ncl usion, but be caus e of this law everything de viate s. For ins tance , if rain began it w ould g o on witho ut stopping , if floods be gan the y would cover everything , if an e arthquake be gan it w ould g o on inde finite ly. But the y stop, because of t he L aw of Seven , because at every m issing semi-tone things deviate, they do no t g o by straight l ines. The Law of Seven al so explains why the re ar e no straight lines in natur e. E verything in o ur life and o ur m achine is also bas ed on this law.

Further, in connection with the question of good and evi l, we m ust try to unde rstand the relativ e po sitio ns of m orality and co nscie nce. W hat is m orality and w hat is conscie nce? W e can s ay first o f all that m orality is no t co nstant.

But in E urope no body would think that, in f act m ost pe ople would think a m an v ery im moral to kil l any body, even a r elativ e of somebody who had kil led his uncl e.

Try to think ho w you l ook at it y ourself, w hat y our attitude to tho se tw o ide as was before you m et this system. W e ar e all in the same po sitio n. W e want kno wledge, but we do not realize t hat there a re ob stacles in ou rselves that preven t us from acquiring this kno wledge. I will star t w ith m yself. Be fore I m et the sy ste m I read a g reat de al and m ade m any experiments . From the se experiments I got inte resting state s, unde rstood several laws, and I natur ally wante d a co ntinuatio n of the se state s. But I saw that f or this m ore knowledge was n ecessary . T hen I me t this sy stem. In the sy stem particular st ress w as laid on being. Acco rding to this system no m ore kno wledge is po ssible until one's being is chang ed. Soon af ter we he ard abo ut kno wledge and be ing our groups div ided into tw o camps. The fi rst camp thought that the w hole t hing w as change of b eing, that with change of b eing w e would get m ore from the k nowledge w e alrea dy have. The s econd camp (to w hich I believe I alone b elon ged) said that even in ou r present state of being we can g et m uch m ore kno wledge than w e hav e, that w e ar e no t so satur ated w ith kno wledge that w e canno t abs orb m ore.

The m ore you kno w yourself, the m ore you kno w your being . If you hav e ne ver learnt that y ou hav e be ing , the be ing of all pe ople will be the same to you. S omeone who has ne ver he ard o f self-remembering, if you as k him , will say that he can r emember him self. This is one be ing .

We unde rstand the dif ference of objects , but in o rdinar y thinking we do no t unde rstand the dif ference of be ing . W hat do we learn in this system? First that w e ar e not o ne, that w e hav e m any 'I's, that the re is no centr al 'I' in contr ol. This is the state of our be ing . The resul t is m echanical ness—w e ar e m achine s.

When I me t this sy stem, it sh owed me that ch ange of being was n ecessary , b ecau se we are not wh at we think ourselves to be. If we we re wh at we think we are—i f we had conscio usness, will, if we co uld 'do', the n only kno wledge would be ne cessary. But w e all think o f ourselves dif ferently from what w e ar e in r eality . And it is exactl y this dif ference be tween what w e ar e and w hat w e think w e ar e that sho ws w hat is l acking in ou r b eing. So t wo t hings are n ecessary: change of k nowledge a nd c hange of b eing. Q. But w e ar e co nstantl y chang ing! A. No, w e ar e in o ne room, running from one co rner to ano ther, no t chang ing. In one corner we think w e ar e one thing , in ano ther we think w e ar e dif ferent. W e canno t change j ust because we have gon e from on e c omer to another. W hat look s like change is chang e thr ough im itatio n, chang e of co nditio ns, likes and dis like s.

We ar e to ld in this system that m an has the po ssibil ity of living in f our state s of conscio usness but that as he is, he lives only in tw o. W e also kno w that o ur functio ns are div ided into four cate gories. So we study four cate gories of functio ns in tw o state s of co nsciousness. A t the same time we re alize that glimpses o f se lf-co nsci ousness happe n, and that w hat pr events us from hav ing m ore of the se glim pses is the fact that we do not remember ou rselves —t hat we are a sleep . The first thing ne cessary in a s erious study of oneself is to unde rstand that conscio usness has de grees. Y ou m ust remember that y ou do no t pas s from one state of conscio usne ss to ano ther, but that the y ar e adde d to one ano ther. This m eans that if you are in the s tate of sleep , when you awake, the s tate of relative c onsciousness or 'waking sleep' is ad ded to the state of sleep; if you become se lf-co nsci ous, this i s adde d to the state of 'waking sleep'; and if you acquir e the state of objectiv e consciousness, t his i s ad ded to the state of se lf-co nsci ousness. T here are no sh arp transitio ns f rom one state to ano ther state . W hy no t? Be cause each state co nsists o f different layers. As in sleep , you can be m ore asleep or les s asleep , so in the s tate in which w e ar e no w, you can be ne arer to self-consciousness or further from it. The second thing ne cessary in a s erious study of oneself is the study of functio ns by observing the m, learning to div ide the m in the right w ay, learning to recognize each one separ ately. E ach f unctio n has its own pr ofession, its own s pecial ity. T hey m ust be studie d separ ately and the ir dif ference s clearly unde rstood, remembering that the y ar e contr olled by dif ferent ce ntr es or m inds . It is very us eful to think abo ut o ur dif ferent functio ns or ce ntr es and r ealize that the y ar e quite inde pende nt. W e do no t realize that the re ar e four inde pende nt be ing s in us , four inde pende nt m inds . W e always try to reduce everything to one m ind.

T hen the re is the sentim ental or emotio nal m an, and the the oretical or inte llectual m an. I f we look at ourselves from this point of vi ew , it is ea sier to see w here w e m ake the c hief m istake about ou rselves , because we take ou rselves as on e, as always the s ame.

If w e want to be m ore co nscio us, w e m ust study what pr events us from rem emberi ng ou rselves . So w e have t o introduce a certain va luation of functio ns from the po int o f view of whether the y ar e us eful or har mful for self­ reme mb ering. So the re ar e tw o lines of study : study of the functio ns of our ce ntr es, and s tudy of unne cessary or har mful functio ns. Q. Is the m etho d of this study observatio n? A. One can f ind m any thing s in that w ay and it can pr epare the ground f or further study , but it is no t sufficie nt by its elf. By self-observatio n one canno t establ ish the most im portant div isions in oneself, div isions bo th ho rizontal and v ertical , for the re ar e many dif ferent div isions; one canno t kno w the dif ferent state s of co nscio usness and separ ate one's functio ns. One m ust kno w the chie f div isions, otherwise one will m ake mistake s and w ill no t kno w what o ne observes. Man is a v ery co mplicate d m achine ; he is r eally no t a m achine , but a big facto ry consisting of m any dif ferent m achine s all working at dif ferent speeds, with dif ferent fuels, in dif ferent co nditio ns. S o it is no t o nly a que stion o f observatio n but a que stio n of kno wledge, and m an canno t g et this kno wledge from him self, for natur e did no t make this kno wledge ins tinctiv e—it has to be acquir ed by the m ind.

So m an m ust learn, and he m ust learn f rom somebody who has learned be fore him . If you m ake a s erious effort to observe functio ns for yourself, you w ill realize that ordinar ily, w hate ver you do , w hate ver you think, w hate ver you f eel, you do no t remember yourself.

W e use this exp ression on ly in relation to ext rem e f orms of negative em otions, but in actual fact we always forget ourselves, and w ith the exceptio n o f very rare m oments we ne ver reme mb er ourse lves in time . Q. Is self-rem em bering the initial p rocess of this system ? A. It is the ce ntr e of the initial pr ocess, and it has to go on, it m ust enter into everything . A t first this sounds im probabl e, be caus e you m ay try to remember yourself, and the n you f ind that f or long pe riods of tim e it do es no t co me to your mind; the n ag ain y ou be gin to remember abo ut it.

T his div ision is very im portant to unde rstand, be caus e m any thing s that we sp eak abou t in ma n re fer to esse nce, while ot hers re fer to person ality. Q. If essence is what w e ar e bo rn with, can it be adde d to ? Can it incr ease? A. Yes, but it can be do ne only if pe rsonality be comes educate d and ce ases to pr ess upo n e ssence . Personality is to o he avy, to o strong; it s urrounds essence like a s hell, so nothing can r each it dir ectl y, everything has to pas s thr ough pe rsonality . Essence canno t g row in the se co nditio ns, but if pe rsonality be comes m ore trans parent, im pressions and e xternal inf luence s will pe netrate thr ough it and r each e ssence , and the n essence will be gin to grow. Q. So a stron g person ality preven ts impression s from rea ching on e's essence? A. Yes, but w hat do es a str ong pe rsonality m ean? It m eans a str ong inf luence of what is no t y our own, o f what y ou hav e acquir ed— other people's w ords, o ther p eople's v iews an d theories.

It de pends whether it is in s chool work or no t. I n ordinar y life we do no t even kno w abo ut the existence of tho se tw o pr incipl es.

All that I can say is that w hat y ou do to -day will m ake to -morrow, so to -morrow depends on what y ou do to -day. Y ou can chang e the futur e now— that is what m ust be unde rstood. In ordinar y life you canno t chang e any thing , but w hen you be gin to kno w more you hav e m ore po wer to chang e. Schools ar e no t al l the same.

T his br ing s us to the subje ct o f dif ferent w ays. But be fore speaking abo ut the ways it is ne cessary to realize that tho usands of years ago people cam e to the ide a that m an can chang e, that he can acquir e so mething he has not g ot. W hat he can acquir e was expressed dif ferently and appr oache d from dif ferent ang les, but the general ide a was always the same—t hat m an can de velop, that he can acquire something n ew. So there w ere formed three w ays corresponding to the div ision of m an into m an N o. 1, N o. 2 and N o. 3. The first w ay is the way of the Fakir . It is a l ong, dif ficul t and unce rtain w ay. A fakir works on the phy sical bo dy, o n co nque ring phy sical pain. The second w ay is the way of the Mo nk. T his way is shorter, m ore sure and m ore definite . It requir es ce rtain co nditio ns, but abo ve all it r equir es faith, f or if the re is no faith a m an canno t be a tr ue m onk. The third way is the w ay of t he Yogi , the w ay of k nowledge a nd consciousness. When we speak about the three w ays we speak about principles. In actual li fe they are seldom m et w ith in a pur e form, for the y ar e m ostly m ixed. But if you kno w the principl e, when you s tudy school pr actice s you can s epar ate which pr actice be longs to which way. W hen we speak of y ogi s we rea lly take on ly Jnana-Yoga and Raja-Yoga . Jnana-Yoga is the y oga of k nowledge, of a new way of t hinking. It teaches to think in dif ferent cate gories, not in the cate gories o f space and tim e and o f causal ity. A nd Raja- Yoga is work on being, on consciou sness. Altho ugh in m any respects the se ways ar e very efficie nt, the char acte ristic thing abo ut the m is that the first step is the m ost dif ficul t. F rom the very first m oment y ou hav e to give up e verything and do what y ou ar e to ld. If you ke ep one little thing , you cannot follow any of t hese w ays. So, although the three w ays are good in m any ot her respects, they are n ot sufficiently ela stic. For instance, they do not suit ou r present mode of life.

I f only the se thr ee traditio nal ways existed, the re would be nothing f or us, for we are too over -educated for these w ays. But there is a Fourth W ay which is a s pecial way, no t a co mbinatio n o f the other thr ee. It is dif ferent f rom others first o f all in that the re is no external giving up o f thing s, for all the work is inne r. A m an m ust be gin w ork in the same co nditio ns in w hich he finds him self when he meets it, be caus e the se co nditio ns ar e the be st for him .

In m any respe cts this way pr oves m ore dif ficul t than the others, for no thing is har der than to chang e oneself inte rnally witho ut chang ing externally. Then in the Fourth W ay the first pr incipl e is that m an m ust no t be lieve any thing ; he must learn; s o faith do es no t enter into the Fourth W ay. One must not believe what one hears or what o ne is adv ised, o ne m ust find pr oofs for everything . If one is co nvince d that s omething is true, the n one can be lieve it, but no t be fore. T his is a br ief outline of the d ifference between the f our ways. Q. W hy is it w rong to be lieve? A. People b elieve or disbelieve w hen they are too la zy to think.

O nly, in the case of co nscio usne ss the re is a ce rtain co nne ctio n between all c entres , for i n fu ll li ght not on ly on e b ut all c entres work differen tly. Real self-remembering requir es emotio n, but w e hav e no co ntr ol over the emotional centr e. So by a ce rtain unde rstanding we can m ake the inte llectual ce ntr e, o ver which w e hav e a ce rtain co ntr ol, work in the dar k as tho ugh it w ere light, and this will pr oduce self-remembering. S elf-remembering m eans a f orm of thinking or inte llectual work which co rresponds to aw ake ning , and in this way it induce s a m oment o f aw ake ning . Th en, when on e a wakes for a m oment, on e r ealizes that gen erally on e is asleep , that o ne is no t co nscio us, and ho w dang erous it is . T he m ore you put into it, the m ore you unde rstand it, the be tte r the result will be . If you r ealize what y ou l ose by no t remembering yourself and w hat y ou g ain by remembering yourself, you w ill hav e a greater incentive f or m aking ef forts to self-rem em ber. You will s ee t hat not remembering yourself is like finding yourself in an ae roplane , hig h abo ve the earth, and f ast asl eep.

W hat is m eant by putting one's tho ughts in a f orm in which the y would correspond to aw ake ning ? A. As I said, tho ughts ar e the only thing we can co ntr ol.

If you cannot remember yourself, try to revive t he ideas of the system in y our m ind. T he whole system, the study of m an and the univ erse, is all he lp to self-remembering .

Should we, each o f us, kno w what stands in o ur w ay? A. Yes, ce rtainl y everyone m ust kno w. It is generally co nne cte d with some form of n egativen ess, or la ziness, or fea r. Q. I still do no t see what it m eans to try and think as we would think if we we re m ore conscious. A. Try to im agine yourself co nscio us—that w ould be the right us e of im aginatio n.

You canno t w ork on co nscio usness its elf: you can m ake one or tw o spasmodic e fforts, but no pe rmane nt efforts. But y ou can m ake efforts on tho ughts, and in this way you can w ork on co nscio usness in a r oundabo ut w ay. This is the m ost im portant par t of the m etho d.

W hat is the rela tion of t hought to consciousness? A. It is v ery dif ficul t to answ er br iefly. Thought is a m echanical pr ocess, it can w ork without, or w ith very little c onsciousness.

Is it br ought abo ut by different qualities of thought? A. One has to do many thing s be sides thinking —o ne has to m ake efforts. It is no t o nly thinking . T he dif ference is o nly that at f irst w e can do very little. W e hav e to be gin from where we ar e. Then, if we co ntinue , self-remembering will gradual ly be come more emotio nal .

A nd w hether you can do any thing af ter you hav e seen it de pends on the size of the buf fer and o n m any other thing s. S ometim es it is ne cessary to take a ham mer and br eak it; and s ometim es it dis appe ars if you thr ow light o n it, f or buf fers do no t like light. W hen buf fers be gin to dis appe ar and be come less strong, co nscie nce be gins to m anif est its elf. In ordinar y life it is ke pt do wn by buf fers. Q. Co uld y ou e xplain a l ittle m ore what y ou m ean by buf fers? A. Buf fers ar e very dif ficul t to de scribe or de fine. A s I said, the y ar e a kind o f par titio ns in us that ke ep us from observing ourselves. You m ay hav e dif ferent emotional attitude s (they always refer to emotional attitude s) to wards the same thing in the m orning , at m idday , and in the evening , witho ut no ticing it. O r in a ce rtain s et of cir cum stance s you hav e one kind o f opinio ns and in o ther cir cum stance s ano ther kind o f opinio ns, and buf fers ar e walls that s tand be tween the m. G enerally each buf fer is based on some kind of w rong a ssumption about on eself, on e's capacities, on e's powers, incl inatio ns, kno wledge, be ing , co nscio usness and s o on. T hey dif fer from ordinar y wrong ide as be cause the y ar e pe rmane nt; in g iven cir cum stance s o ne always feels and s ees the same thing ; and y ou m ust unde rstand that in m an 1, 2 and 3 no thing must be pe rmane nt. T he only chance he has o f chang ing is that the re is no thing permane nt in him . Opinio ns, pr ejudice s, pr econceived ide as ar e no t buf fers yet, but when the y be come very firm, and al ways the sam e, and al ways hav e the sam e trick o f shutting t hings off from ou r sigh t, they become buffers . If peop le h ave s ome kind of constant wron g a ttitude, based on wron g i nform ation, wron g w ork of c entres , negative em otion, if they always use the s ame kind of exc use, they prepare b uffers.

F or ins tance , I kne w a m an w ho had a v ery inte resting buf fer. Every tim e he did s omething wrong, he said that he did it o n purpose, as an exp eriment. This is a very good exa mple of a buffer. Another m an h ad a buf fer that he was ne ver late; so, w ith this buf fer firmly establ ished he was always late but never notice d it, and if his atte ntio n w as dr aw n to it, he was always as tonis hed and s aid, ' How can I be late? I am ne ver late!' Q. W hen a buf fer has gone do wn, and y ou s ee something that s eems unbe arabl e, w hat is the n ext step? A. All the work is pr eparatio n f or that. I f one do es no t w ork but o nly thinks that o ne works and a buf fer sudde nly dis appe ars by some accide nt, o ne finds oneself in a v ery unpl easant s ituatio n, and o ne also sees that o ne only pr etende d to work.

Buffers are u seful in this respect; they help to keep us asleep ; for if ot her sides are n ot developed, if everything is no t br ought into a ce rtain bal ance , one would no t be abl e to bear on eself , as on e is. So it is not even advisable to destroy buffers before on e is ready . One m ust be ready first. W e can be ar ourselves only be caus e we do no t kno w ourselves. If we kne w ourselves as we ar e, it w ould be unbe arabl e. Q. Yet on e s ees on eself intellec tually without feeli ng s trongly. A. Intellectual self-study is only pr eparatio n; but w hen you tr y to remember yourself and no t to ide ntify, you be gin to feel emotional . Q. Do we all hav e buf fers? A. Yes. W e co uld no t live witho ut the m; w e would hav e to be since re all the tim e, and see ever ything all t he time. Q. W hat is the caus e of this inne r dis harmony which o ne us ual ly has ? A. This dis harmony is the no rmal state of m an N o. 1, 2 and 3. A sleeping m an canno t be har monious; if he were har monious the re would be no ince ntiv e for de velopm ent and the re would be no po ssibil ity. Q.

Yes, the system teache s us first to find the m. T hen, hav ing found the m, you m ay find m etho ds for getting rid o f the m. Y ou canno t be gin to work on the m be fore you kno w the m. Q. How can o ne find buf fers? A. One c annot find them unless on e ob serves on eself in the r ight way. You m ust look for co ntr adictio ns. Q.

Otherwise pe ople ne ver be lieve it; the y say, 'Anything but that! ' Q. Is say ing to oneself, 'I will do it to -morrow' a buf fer? A. It is not a buffer, but a very good m ethod of k eep ing t he b uffers goi ng well. Q. You s ay that o ne m ust look for inco nsistencie s. I do see m any of the se, but I put them down to different 'I's? A. Yes, that is quite right.

Y ou m ust try to br eak this ide ntificatio n. Q. Is to want and no t to want at the same tim e a buf fer? A. It is not a buffe r. A buf fer often take s the form of a s trong co nvictio n.

Th en the f eeli ng w e call c onscience is wrong? A. Not ne cessarily wrong, but it is no t the same thing . It can be attache d to quite trivial thing s which hav e no par ticul ar m oral value. Mo rality is always relativ e, co nscie nce is absolute. Conscience is a special p ositive em otion. In ou r present state w e have a ver y small trace of this emotion, s ufficie nt to hav e a g eneral feeling that s omething m ay be right and s omething else m ay be wrong, but ins ufficie nt to say de finite ly what is right and w hat is wrong.

S elf-development be gins with m agnetic ce ntr e, that is , a grou p of ' I's or p ersonality interes ted in c ertain t hings. W hen a m an m eet s a school, his m agnetic ce ntr e be gins to accum ulate pr actical and the oretical kno wledge and experience which co me from the study of be ing , and in this way it e ventual ly be comes Deputy Steward.

T hen he can f ind o ut w hich pe rsonality can work with him and w hich canno t. I f a pe rsonality is ag ains t y our aim and can har m it, or do es no t w ant it, o r do es no t kno w abo ut it, the n obviously it canno t w ork with the Deputy Stew ard. So they can be sorted ou t, but first on e m ust know them . Th en, when personalitie s ar e put in o rder and ar e groupe d r ound m agnetic ce ntr e—w hich m eans Deputy Steward— the y will pr oduce an e ffect o n essence jus t by the ir existence . Q.

Is the re a co nne ctio n be tween m agnetic ce ntr e and co nscio usness? A. Yes, but not a direct on e: t here a re s ever al d ifferent states between them . It is better to say that m agnetic ce ntr e is the ground f rom which pe rmane nt 'I' grows. Through several transfo rmat ions mag netic ce ntre become s p erman ent 'I' mu ch mu ch later.

All study co mes do wn to the study of this im aginar y pictur e and to separating ou rselves from it. So a t present you can call 'I' your va luation of t he s ystem . This is 'y ou'.

False p ersonality is always against the w ork for self-develop ment and spoils the work of all other pe rsonalitie s. It can ne ver be us eful. Q. W hat is the d ifference between real personalities and false p ersonality? A. You m ix tw o div isions which ar e quite dif ferent and o n a dif ferent scal e, so the y canno t be co mpared. P ersonalitie s (in the pl ural) ar e spoken of in r elatio n to essence , for I said that pe rsonality can be div ided into dif ferent pe rsonalitie s which co mpose it. The div ision into essence and pe rsonality is at pr esent m erely the oretical and is only useful as a pr incipl e, for it is dif ficul t to see it in o neself. W e do no t kno w our personalitie s, so we be gin to study from tw o ends . We study first that personality which is co nne cte d with the work and w hich has de veloped f rom the m agnetic ce ntr e; and the n we study false pe rsonality , o n quite a dif ferent scal e. False pe rsonality is oppo sed to 'you', it is your wrong ide a of yourself—e xactl y what y ou are not. This division is practical , for it is ne cessary to kno w de finite ly what y our false pe rsonality looks like. So you m ust no t co nfuse false pe rsonality with pe rsonalitie s, be caus e, al tho ugh the y are no t v ery real, pe rsonalitie s m ay be bas ed o n real incl inatio ns, real tas tes and l ikes, whereas false p ersonality is all f alse a nd m ay even pretend to like something t hat 'you' dislike or to dislike so me thing 'you' re ally like. W hen you sp eak ab out fal se personality , you take 'you' as existing and f alse pe rsonality as no t; w hen you s peak abo ut pe rsonalitie s, you l eave false pe rsonality out o f the co nversatio n and dis cuss dif ferent div isions of what y ou co nside r to be 'yourself'. False pe rsonality m ust no t be come jus t a w ord. E verybody who speaks abo ut it m ust hav e some pictur e of him self in the po wer of false pe rsonality .

But ' Ouspensky' I kno w and I can study him in al l his m anif estatio ns. S o I m ust be gin w ith ' Ouspensky'. 'I' is elusive and very small; it e xists only as a po tential ity; if it do es no t g row, false pe rsonality will co ntinue to co ntr ol everything . Many pe ople make the m istake of thinking that the y kno w which is which. T hey say 'this is I', w hen in r eality it is f alse pe rsonality . This is g enerally co nne cte d with o ur capacity to pl ay roles. I t is a v ery limited capacity ; we gen erally have a bout five or s ix roles , whether w e ob serve i t or n ot.

Man is div ided into four par ts: bo dy, soul, essence and pe rsonality . We hav e already spoken about essence and personality.

W hen activ e force pas ses thr ough any kind of matte r it is cal led Car bon. W hen pas sive force pas ses thr ough it, it is cal led O xygen.

In study ing this ne w languag e, you unde rstand the relatio n of t hings to on e a nother, because it binds every thing toget her— every thing w e know or must kno w or can be inte rested to kno w in the world. T he value of this languag e is that in us ing some term of it y ou e xplain no t o nly what this object is and w hat pl ace it occupie s in its im mediate surrounding s, but y ou al so show its pl ace in the whole univ erse. Taking the Ray of Cr eatio n as a succe ssio n of events, it can be regarded as an octav e. It is a de scending octav e in the sense of expans ion and dif ferentiatio n. T he first inte rval in this octav e is filled by the W ill of the Absolute. In order to fill the second inte rval, be tween pl ane ts and e arth, a spe cial instr ument w as co sm ical ly cr eated. T his ins trument is organic l ife on earth. O rganic l ife on earth pl ays a v ery im portant par t in the R ay of Creation, for it gu arantees the transmission of en ergies and m akes the grow th of t he R ay possible. The grow ing p oint of t he R ay is the m oon . The idea is that even tually the m oon will b ecome like the ea rth and the ea rth like the s un; then another moon will appe ar, and s o growth w ill co ntinue up to a ce rtain po int. But this is rathe r beyond us . Organic l ife is a so rt of r eceiving appar atus f or catching and tr ansm itting inf luence s comi ng fro m the planets o f the so lar sy stem. A t the same time as se rving as a me ans o f communicatio n be tween the earth and the pl ane ts, organic l ife feeds the m oon. Everything that lives serves the p urposes of the ea rth; ever ything that dies feed s the moon.

T he m oon balances organic l ife—a ll external m ovements ar e bal ance d by the m oon. W hat w ill happe n if this functio n o f the m oon dis appe ars? W ill it be be neficial to an indiv idual m an o r the oppo site ? We m ust r ealize that al l this r efers to be ing . W hat ar e the featur es of o ur be ing ? The chie f featur e of our be ing is that w e ar e m any. If we want to work on our be ing , m ake it co rrespond m ore to our aim , we m ust try to be come one. But this is a v ery far aim . What do es it m ean to be come one? The first ste p, w hich is stil l very far, is to cr eate a perm anent centre of gra vity. This is what creating m oon in on eself m eans. The m oon is a pe rmane nt ce ntr e of gravity which bal ance s our phy sical life, but in oursel ves we do no t hav e such a bal ance , so, w hen we cr eate this bal ance or ce ntr e of g ravity in ourselves we do not need the m oon .

W e hav e be en told abo ut m any featur es of this , but the y m ust be establ ished de finite ly by observation, and in or der to come nearer to the idea of creating m oon in on eself we must dis ting uish w hat is im portant and w hat is unim portant. T hen we m ust be gin to struggle ag ains t the featur es which pr event us be coming one. W e m ust struggle with im aginatio n, ne gativ e emotions and s elf-will. Be fore this struggle can be succe ssful, we m ust realize that the worst po ssible kind o f im aginatio n, f rom the po int o f view of obtaining a ce ntr e of gravity , is the be lief that o ne can do any thing by oneself. After that, w e m ust find the ne gativ e emotions which pr event us do ing what is suggested in conne ctio n w ith the system.

W hat is im portant to unde rstand is that the re is a kind o f secret in s chool-work, not in the sense of something actual ly hidde n, but s omething that has to be explaine d. The ide a is this.

If I work only on one li ne, or on two li nes, the d irec tion will c hange. If I work on three li nes, or t hree octav es, one line will he lp ano ther to pas s the inte rval by giving the ne cessary shock. I t is very im portant to unde rstand this . S chool-work us es m any co smic ide as, and thr ee lines of work is a s pecial ar rangement to safeguard the right dir ectio n o f the work and to mak e it su cce ssfu l. The first line is work on oneself: self-study , study of the system and tr ying to chang e at l east the m ost m echanical m anif estatio ns. T his is the m ost im portant l ine. The second l ine is work with o ther pe ople. O ne canno t w ork by oneself; a ce rtain frictio n, inco nvenience and dif ficul ty of working with o ther pe ople cr eates the necessary shocks.

Everything is take n f or grante d, and at the same tim e it is take n f rom an o rdinar y po int o f view. A s a r esult nothing chang es. Much de pends on pe rsonal attitude and pe rsonal work. A school for on e p erson is not a school for a nother. Q. How can o ne hav e the right attitude and v aluatio n? A. First o f all, be fore be ginning to study , o ne m ust de cide what o ne really wants to kno w. It is quite po ssible that w hat w e study he re will no t inte rest one, one m ay find that o ne do es no t ne ed it at al l. So one m ust tr y to find m ore or l ess w hat o ne wants, otherwise one m ay only waste one's tim e. T his is first. S econdl y, one m ust unde rstand certain f undam ental pr incipl es, o therwise one will fail to unde rstand m any other thing s; something will always stand in the way of one's unde rstanding . A very im portant pr incipl e is that a pe rson canno t study the system alone, and it is necessary to unde rstand w hy. There ar e m any reasons. The first reason is very simple and ob vious—on e c annot have a teacher a ll t o on eself. If on e fi nds someone w ho c an teach this system, he will no t spend his tim e on one person. And witho ut someone who can e xplain thing s and w ork with o ne, one can do no thing . Secondl y, if one works alone, or tries to , o ne canno t put so meone else in o ne's pl ace , and at a ce rtain m oment this be comes very ne cessary in o rder to pas s to the ne xt de gree of kno wledge and being . You w ill remember what I said abo ut the stair cas e in the first lectur e, in conne ctio n w ith the explanatio n o f the growth o f m agnetic ce ntr e and the work following? I said that a m an can r ise to the ne xt step of the stair cas e only by putting ano ther m an in his pl ace . T his m eans that o ne clim bs up this stair cas e which represents the dif ference in l evels be tween ordinar y life and w hat is cal led the W ay. The W ay does no t be gin o n the same level as ordinar y life, o ne has to go up hig her to reach it. This m eans that the level of our unde rstanding , o ur ordinar y m ind, e ven our ordinar y feeling s hav e to be chang ed. O nly, in thinking abo ut putting other pe ople in o ne's place , it is very im portant to avoid o ne dang erous m istake . Some pe ople ar e incl ine d to think that this m ust be the ir indiv idual work. T hey fail to unde rstand that this expression is a f ormulatio n o f a g eneral pr incipl e. It is chil dis h to think that it can be done by one pe rson trans mitting the se ide as to ano ther. First o f all it is ne cessary to unde rstand that pe ople canno t do it and, s econdl y, that it canno t be demande d of the m, because individual w ork can on ly refer t o on eself. Pu tting p eople i n on e's place is school- work, that is , the jo int e fforts of all the pe ople be longing to the school.

But no body has tho ught abo ut it in the right w ay.

That de pends on you, o n ho w you unde rstand it, w hat y ou f eel abo ut it, w hat y ou think y ou can do abo ut it. T here ar e no im posed o bligatio ns. O bligatio ns co me from work. The m ore on e d oes, the m ore ob ligations on e h as. If on e d oes nothing, nothing is as ked o f one. Mr Gurdjie ff explaine d this in the be ginning ; he said it was dang erous to do something in the work if you do no t w ant dif ficul t thing s to be as ked o f you. Q.

O n the second l ine the chie f dif ficul ty in the be ginning is working no t o n your own initiativ e; be caus e it de pends no t o n yourself, but o n ar rangements m ade in the work.

One of the m ost im portant thing s in e very kind o f school is the ide a of rules. If there a re n o rules , there is no school. Not even an imitation school c an exi st without rules. If it is an im itatio n s chool the re will be im itatio n rules, but the re m ust be some kind o f rules. One de finitio n of a s chool is that it is a ce rtain num ber of pe ople who acce pt and f ollow ce rtain r ules.

On e effort does not me an work; but a co nne cte d line of efforts, an uninte rrupte d line of efforts, only that becomes work. Q. If tw o pe ople he lp each o ther, will that be second l ine? A. No, as I hav e explaine d, in the second l ine the re is no initiativ e. But the re m ust be a certain pr eparatio n f or it: one m ust unde rstand the ne cessity of working with pe ople. When you be gin to unde rstand that it is phy sical ly im possible to work alone, that it is only be caus e of the se other pe ople that y ou y ourself can w ork, that w ill be unde rstanding , but it w ill no t be second l ine yet.

Is the re any par ticul ar line that w ill he lp one to escape from do ing unne cessary thing s? A. No par ticul ar line—a ll lines that ar e explaine d. Y ou m ust be abl e to see what is possible. You ar e given m any suggestions and o ne day you can do be tte r work on one line and ano ther day on ano ther line; the re is no special line for all day s, for all tim e. And there is se lf-re me mb ering, everything that was sa id abou t identification, conside ring , ne gativ e emotions, study of the system, m any thing s. Y ou ne ver kno w which w ill be m ore us eful at a g iven tim e; o ne m oment o ne he lps and ano ther m oment ano ther he lps. Q. Do es this sy stem involve se lf-su rre nder? A. Not in the us ual sense. In the Fourth W ay only a s pecial kind o f surrende r is necessar y, in ce rtain kinds o f w ork, in so me spe cial situatio ns. F or instance , as I hav e sai d, one mu st su rre nder o ne's d ecisions in questions co nnected with work in the school. T his is an e xam ple of po ssible dis cipl ine.

If you do no t see what y ou hav e to give up it m eans that it is no t the tim e to think abo ut it y et.

A. Emotio n do es no t m ean inte rference . Intellectual functio n can br ing you o nly to a certain s tage; further you hav e to travel on emotion. A bout self-consciousness, which is a hig her state of co nscio usne ss, no one can say that it is a de finite ly po ssibl e or easy experience, for it m eans chang e of be ing ; so it is dif ficul t to tell a mechanical man how he will feel and l ook at thing s when he be comes m ore co nscio us.

W hat I said abo ut no t tr ying to alter thing s referred to people in ordinar y conditio ns of li fe, without school, without discipline, without m ethods of t he w ork. I said t hen that in o rdinar y life pe ople canno t chang e any thing in the mselves, be caus e by chang ing one thing the y unco nsciously chang e ano ther.

That cr eates the big gest dif ficul ty. T he ne cessity for m aking efforts comes as a sho ck, as a ne w thing . Q. I canno t by effort reach a state that so metim es co mes accide ntal ly. A. You say it co mes accide ntal ly. If it is w hat I m ean, it co mes as a r esul t of your efforts, only it do es no t co me at the tim e.

The se cond is that thing s ar e co nne cte d; that the y only appe ar to be separ ated.

The bas is of this m etho d, and the chie f dif ference from ordinar y m etho ds, is the realizatio n of the relativ ity of m ind— the unde rstanding of the ty pe and kind o f m ind us ed and realizatio n that in o ne state of m ind thing s can be unde rstood in o ne way and in ano ther in ano ther way.

I remember long ag o Mr Gurdjieff said about this exp ression repeated two or three t imes in the N ew Testam ent, that in o rder to germinate and pr oduce a pl ant a se ed m ust die , that it w as not co mplete in r elatio n to m an. I n relatio n to m an it m ust be am plified. S peaking in general abo ut the work, abo ut its po ssibil itie s and abo ut the dir ectio n o f the work, Mr Gurdjie ff explaine d it to us like this . F irst w e m ust realize that we are asleep; secondl y we m ust aw ake . W hen we ar e aw ake we m ust die ; when we die we can be bo rn. T his is the pr ocess in de tail and the dir ectio n. I t is us eful to think abo ut it, us eful to unde rstand w hat s leep m eans , what to aw ake m eans , what to die m eans and w hat it would m ean to be bo rn. S uppo se we want to be bo rn. W e canno t be bo rn until we die , and w e canno t die until we aw ake . W e canno t aw ake until we realize that w e ar e asleep . So there a re d efinite steps. Q. W hat do es to die m ean in the sense in w hich y ou s peak? A. 'To die ' m eans to die , to dis appe ar, no t to be , no t to exist. I t is us eless to die in sleep, be caus e the n you canno t be bo rn. Y ou m ust aw ake first. I hav e be en as ked m any que stions, some of the m very naiv e, by dif ferent pe ople who hav e tried to unde rstand the Lord's Prayer and w ho cam e to m e as king m e to explain w hat o ne or ano ther phr ase in it m eans.

You m ust unde rstand first o f all that o rdinar y, pl ain w ords canno t explain any thing in r elatio n to the Lord's Prayer. S ome pr eparato ry unde rstanding is ne cessary, the n further unde rstanding m ay come, but o nly as a r esul t of e ffort and r ight attitude .

One of the first thing s which m ust be unde rstood and r emembered, be fore a s tudy of the L ord's Prayer is possible, is the d ifference between the r eligious language a nd system language. What is religion? Th is word is used ver y of ten; there a re p eople w ho u se it ever y day , but the y canno t de fine what is m eant by religion. In the system we hav e he ard that r eligion is dif ferent f or dif ferent pe ople, that the re is reli gion of m an No. 1, a reli gion of m an No. 2, a reli gion of m an No. 3 a nd s o on . But ho w can w e de fine the dif ference be tween the m? Be fore co ming to de finitio ns we must unde rstand f irst o f all that the m ost ne cessary element in al l religions kno wn to us is the ide a of G od—a G od w ith w hom we can stand in a pe rsonal relatio nship, to whom we can, as it w ere, spe ak, w hom we can be g for he lp, and in the po ssibil ity of whose he lp we can be lieve. An inse par able par t of r eligion is f aith in G od, that is, in a Higher Be ing , omnipo tent and o mnipr esent, w ho can he lp us in any thing we wish for or want to do . I do not speak from the p oint of vi ew of w hether this is right or w rong, possible or im possible. I simply say that f aith, that is be lief in G od and in his po wer to he lp us , is an es sential p art of reli gion. Prayer is also an ins epar able par t of any religion; but pr ayer can be very dif ferent. Prayer can be a pe titio n for he lp in any thing we m ay unde rtake , and al so, thr ough scho ol-work, pr ayer can be come he lp itse lf. It can be come an instr ument o f w ork which can be us ed for reviving ide as of the system, it can be us ed for self­ remembering and f or reminding us abo ut sleep and the ne cessity for aw ake ning . At the same tim e, the expressions of religious languag e canno t be trans late d exactl y into the s ystem language. First, because of the elem ent of faith in religion, and secondl y, be cause of the acce ptance in r eligion and r eligious languag e of f acts and asse rtions w hich in the sy ste m ar e regarded as il logical and inco nsiste nt. Nevertheless, it w ould be wrong to say that r eligion and the system ar e inco mpatibl e or co ntr adicto ry; only, w e m ust learn no t to m ix the tw o languag es. If we be gin to m ix the m, w e shall spoil any us eful co ncl usions that co uld be m ade on eithe r of the tw o lines. Re tur ning to the ide a of God, an ide a which is ins epar able from religion and reli gious language, we m ust first ask ou rselves how reli gions can b e divided i n a general or his torical way. They m ay be div ided into religions with o ne God and reli gions with m any god s. But even in this"},{"pageNumber":415,"pageContent":"division it m ust be remembered that there is a gr eat difference b etween the or dinary unde rstanding of m onothe ism and po lythe ism and the system unde rstanding of the same ideas. Although there a re c ertain differences between god s—a s, for instance, in Greek m ytho logy—i n the ordinar y unde rstanding of po lythe ism all gods ar e m ore or les s on the s ame level. From the s ystem point of vi ew , which includes the idea of dif ferent scal es and dif ferent laws on dif ferent l evels, o ne has quite a dif ferent unde rstanding of the inte rdepende nce of gods. If w e take the Absolute as G od, w e can se e that it has no relatio n to us. T he Absolute is G od f or g ods; it has r elatio n only to the ne xt world, that is, W orld 3. T he World 3 is God f or the ne xt world, that is , W orld 6, and al so for all the following worlds, but in a l esser and l esser de gree. Then the Galaxy, S un, P lane ts, Earth and Mo on ar e all gods, e ach incl uding in itse lf sm aller gods. T he Ray of Cr eatio n as a whole, take n as one triad, is also God: God the Holy, G od the Firm, G od the Immortal. So we m ay c hoose on wh ich level we wi sh to take our Go d if we wa nt to use the word 'G od' in the re ligious se nse, that is t o say , in the se nse of a G od having im mediate acce ss to our l ives.

W hen each indiv idual be ing in the hum an, anim al and v egetabl e king dom die s, the bo dy—o r what r emains of the body— goes to the Earth and be comes par t of the Earth, and the soul goes to the Mo on and becomes par t of the Mo on.

These tw o no tes m ay give rise to m any suppo sitio ns as to the possible pl ace of a G od o r gods hav ing some relatio n to us in the Ray of Cr eatio n.

O ur Fathe r which ar t in he aven hal lowed be Thy nam e 2. T hy king dom co me 3. T hy will be do ne on earth as it is in he aven. In the first pe titio n, ' Our Fathe r which ar t in he aven hal lowed be Thy nam e', the im mediate que stio n is , w ho is 'our Fathe r'? The ke y-word is 'heaven'. W hat do es 'in heaven' m ean? If we try to answer this question from the p oint of vi ew of the R ay of Cr eatio n we m ay be abl e to unde rstand s omething . W e live on the Earth, s o 'heaven' must m ean higher levels , that is, the P lanets, the S un or the G alaxy. Th e idea of 'heaven' pr esuppo ses ce rtain f orces, o r ce rtain m ind o r m inds on tho se hig her levels to which, in s ome way, the Lord's Prayer adv ises us to appe al; 'heaven' canno t refer to anything on the level of the E arth. But if we realize t hat the c osmic forces connected with the G alaxy, the S un or the P lanets are too b ig t o have a ny relation to us, then we can l ook for the pl ace of our 'Fathe r in he aven' in the do or si of t he la teral oc tave— or we can ag ain l eave it to hig her r egions. In the words which f ollow the re is no thing pe rsonal. 'Hallowed be Thy nam e' is the expression of a de sire for the de velopm ent o f the right attitude to wards God, and f or a bette r unde rstanding of the ide a of God o r Higher Mind, and this de sire for develop ment ob viously refers to the w hole of h umanity. The second pe titio n, 'Thy king dom co me', is the expression of a de sire for the grow th of es oteri cism. In A New Model of the U niver se I tried to explain that the king dom of he aven could only mean e sotericis m, that is to say, a ce rtain inne r par t of hum anity unde r par ticul ar laws. The thir d petitio n, 'Thy will be done on earth as it is in he aven', is the expression of a de sire for the trans itio n o f the Earth to a hig her level, unde r the dir ect w ill of Higher Mind.

'Supe rsubs tantial ' or 'spiritual ' as"},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"some pe ople say, m ay refer to hig her food, hig her hy drogens, hig her inf luence s or hig her kno wledge. The tw o following pe titio ns in this second par t, 'Forgive us our de bts as we forgive our de bto rs', and ' Lead us no t into temptatio n but de liver us from evil' ar e the m ost dif ficul t to unde rstand o r to explain. T hey ar e par ticul arly dif ficul t be cause the ir o rdinar y m eaning , as g enerally acce pte d, has nothing to do with the real m eaning . W hen pe ople think abo ut the words, 'forgive us our de bts as we forgive our de bto rs' in the ordinar y way, the y im mediate ly be gin to make logical and psy chological m istake s. F irst o f all, the y take for grante d that the y can forgive de bts , and that it de pends on the m whether the y will forgive or no t forgi ve; and secondly, they believe t hat it is eq ually good to forgi ve d ebts and to have the ir own de bts forgiven. T his is a f allacy and has no foundatio n whate ver. If the y think about them selves , if they study them selves , if they ob serve them selves , they will very soon see t hat they cannot for give any debts just as the y cannot do anything. In order to do and in o rder to for give one m ust f irst o f all be abl e to remember oneself , on e m ust be awake a nd on e m ust have will. As we are now, we have thousands of different wills, and even if on e of these w ills wants to forgive, there a re always m any others which do no t w ant to forgive and w hich w ill think that forgiveness is a w eakne ss, an inco nsistency or even a cr im e. And the strangest thing is that s ometim es it is really a cr im e to forgive. Here we co me to an inte resting point. We do not know whether it is good to forgi ve or n ot, whether it is good to forgi ve a lways, or whether in s ome cas es it is be tter to forgive and in s ome cas es be tter no t to forgive. If w e think m ore abo ut it, w e m ay co me to the co ncl usio n that e ven if we co uld forgive, pe rhaps it w ould be be tte r to wait until we kne w m ore, that is , until we kne w in w hich cas es it is be tter to forgive and in w hich cas es it is be tter no t to forgive. At this po int w e should remember what has be en said abo ut po sitiv e and ne gativ e attitude s and w e should realize that po sitiv e attitude s ar e no t al ways co rrect, ne gativ e attitude s ar e sometim es ne cessary for a r ight unde rstanding . S o, if 'forgiving' always means hav ing a po sitiv e attitude , the n forgiving m ay sometim es be quite wrong. We m ust unde rstand that to forgive indis criminate ly m ay be worse than no t to forgive at al l; and this unde rstanding m ay br ing us to the right v iew of our own positio n in r elatio n to our own de bts . Suppo se for a m oment that the re actual ly was some be nevolent and r athe r stupid de ity who co uld f orgive our de bts , and w ho would really forgive the m and w ipe the m out. I t would be the greatest m isfortune that co uld happe n to us . T here would be no ince ntiv e for us to work the n, and no reason to work. We co uld g o on do ing the same wrong thing s and hav ing the m all forgiven in the end. Such a po ssibil ity is quite co ntr ary to any ide a of"},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"the work. In the work we m ust kno w that no thing will be forgiven. O nly this kno wledge will give us a r eal ince ntiv e to work, and at l east pr event us from repeating the same things wh ich we already k now t o be wr ong. It is inte resting to look at s chools from this po int o f view and to co mpare schools with o rdinar y life. In life pe ople m ay expect f orgiveness, o r at l east ho pe for it. I n school n othing i s forgi ven. That is an es sential p art of a school s ystem , school m ethod and s chool organiz atio n. S chools exist pr ecisely for no t-forgiving , and be caus e of this fact on e c an h ope and exp ect to get something from a school. If things were forgi ven in s chools, the re would be no reason for the ir existence . The inner m eaning of ' Forgi ve u s ou r d ebts as we forgi ve ou r d ebtors ' actually refers to inf luence s, that is to say , inf luence s from hig her l evels. W e can attr act to ourselves hig her inf luence s only if we trans fer to other pe ople the inf luence s we receive or have r eceived. Th ere a re m any ot her m eanings of these w ords, but this is the be ginning of the way to unde rstand the m. The thir d pe titio n o f this second par t is: 'Lead us no t into temptatio n but de liver us from evil'. W hat is our greatest temptatio n? Mo st pr obabl y it is sleep: so the first w ords ar e unde rstandabl e—' help us to sleep less, o r he lp us to aw ake so metim es'. T he ne xt par t is m ore dif ficul t. It reads: 'But de liver us from evil'. Possibly it s hould be 'and deliver us from evi l'. Th ere a re many inte rpretatio ns of this 'but' , but no ne of the m is quite satisfacto ry as trans late d into ordinar y languag e, so I shall leave it f or the pr esent. The chie f que stion is , w hat do es 'evil' m ean? One po ssible inte rpretatio n is that in relatio n to the ordinar y temptatio n, w hich is only sleep, it m eans letting oneself fall asl eep ag ain w hen one had al ready be gun to aw ake . It m ay m ean g iving up the work when one has already unde rstood the ne cessity for working , giving up e fforts af ter one had be gun to m ake efforts and, as has already be en m entio ned, s tarting to do stupid o r even har mful thing s, such as going ag ains t school rules and jus tifying oneself for so doing . Many inte resting exam ples of thing s of this kind can be found in the actio ns of people who leave the work and par ticul arly in the ir explanatio ns of the ir do ing so.

W e do no t speak abo ut the pl ace , but abo ut recur rence. If you s ay that y ou remember that y ou l ived in Ro me, for ins tance , ho w can y ou f ind pr oof? It is impossible. So ea ch theor y can exi st on different planes.

Th is can happen with ever y theor y and sometimes in the p rocess it can even become its own o ppo site. But y ou m ust always remember that w e canno t pr ove any thing and canno t ins ist on any par ticul ar the ory. O nly, w e m ust unde rstand e ach the ory within its own l imits and its own cy cle and s ee what is po ssible and w hat is im possible from the po int o f view of this the ory. If you take a the ory and pr oceed to add o ne thing and to take aw ay ano ther, that w ould be wrong. In each the ory one m ust study what it incl ude s, and no thing m ust be omitte d. S o if we find a the ory that is phil osophical ly po ssible, we can l ook for co nditio ns in w hich it w ould ce ase to be a the ory and w ould be come a f act. Q.

T here ar e whole series of que stio ns and problems abo ut w hich al l we can do is to form the ories, w itho ut ever be ing really convince d that o ne the ory is be tte r than ano ther.

It is very simple, the re is no thing m ysterious. It is no t a puz zle, it is m erely a que stio n o f thinking . Try to think l ike this : take an o rdinar y school. A bo y goes to school and e very year be gins to learn the same thing .

Q. In the ide a of recur rence thing s happe n ag ain. But do schools ne cessarily appe ar in the same place s? Pe rhaps in my last re curre nce this sy stem never came to En gland? A. This is the dif ficul ty abo ut recur rence, be caus e when pe ople he ar abo ut it and be gin to think, the y think in the ordinar y formato ry, that is , logical way, or very often the y think quite illogi cally , or w orse. But even if they think logi cally , they have n ot en ough material, the y do no t kno w enough to think abo ut it.

W hen we think abo ut recur rence, w e think that e verything repeats, and this is e xactl y what spo ils our appr oach to it. T he first thing to unde rstand abo ut recur rence is that it is no t eternal . It sounds abs urd, but actual ly it is so, be caus e it is so dif ferent in dif ferent cas es. E ven if we take it the oretical ly, if we take pur ely pe ople in m echanical life, even the ir l ives change. On ly certain people, in quite frozen conditions of li fe, have t heir li ves repeating i n exa ctly the s ame way, m aybe f or a lon g time. In ot her cases, even in ord inary m echanical life, things change. If people a re n ot so definitely govern ed by cir cum stance s, like great m en w ho hav e to be great m en ag ain and no body can do any thing abo ut it, the re ar e variatio ns, but ag ain no t for ever. N ever think that anything is for ever. It is a very strange thing, but it seem s as though people w ho h ave no po ssibil itie s, eithe r owing to ce rtain co nditio ns, or to the ir own ins ufficie nt develop ment, or t o some pathologi cal state, can have t heir li ves rep eating w ithout any par ticul ar chang e, w hereas in the case of pe ople with the oretical po ssibil ity, the ir l ives can r each ce rtain po ints at w hich the y eithe r m eet with so me po ssibil ity of develop ment or t hey begin to go d own.

There ar e tw o thing s we m ust unde rstand abo ut this .

N othing can be chang ed, be cause such big caus es ar e m oving the se thing s that, al tho ugh the y hav e no t y et happe ned, the y can happe n o nly in o ne way.

Ce rtain thing s have to happe n to -morrow be caus e the ir caus es lie in l ast year or in te n o r tw enty years ag o. But if the caus e of ce rtain thing s that w ill happe n to -morrow lies in to -day, the n the y can happe n dif ferently to -morrow if something is do ne dif ferently to -day. S o it is a que stio n o f the natur e of the caus es and o f where the y ar e. You can l ook at it l ike this : suppo se you s ee thing s going on in e xactl y the same way for a l ong tim e—t hen y ou canno t expect a s udde n chang e witho ut some par ticul ar reason.

But if the tende ncy has be en going on in the same dir ectio n f or a l ong tim e it is dif ficul t to se e a po ssibil ity of chang e. T hat is the only way we can discuss it, f or we canno t kno w any thing de finite abo ut the se thing s. Y ou m ust remember one principl e in relatio n to this —t hing s ar e no t the same. If you s ay that s ome thing s can be chang ed and appl y it to everything , you w ill be wrong, be caus e thing s ar e ne ver in the same relatio nship to the po ssibil ity of chang e. Q. May the po ssibil ity of variatio n in pe ople's recur rences m ean that pe ople bo rn in one recur rence m ight no t be bo rn in the ne xt? A. This is po ssible only in s ome cas es, but w e canno t g o into de tail s of this kind. W hat I want y ou to unde rstand de finite ly is that as long as pe ople ar e quite m echanical , thing s can r epeat and r epeat al most inde finite ly. But if pe ople be come m ore co nscio us, or if the po ssibil ity of be coming co nscio us appe ars, the ir tim e be comes limited. T hey canno t expect an unl im ite d num ber of recur rence s if the y hav e already be gun to kno w something or to learn s omething . The m ore the y learn, the shorter be comes the ir tim e. People always forget that the re is o nly a v ery limited num ber o f chance s for every body, so if on e los es a possibility in on e li fe, then next life on e w ill los e it m ore easily. Th e c loser on e c omes to the p ossibility of change, the s maller the n umber of chance s be comes, and if one finds a chance and do es no t use it, o ne m ay lose it altogethe r. It is the sam e pr incipl e as that w hich appl ies to one life.

T hat m ust be unde rstood, and the same principl e can be appl ied to recur rence . Q. Is it that if we ar e co mpletely m echanical we m ust r ecur in e xactl y the sam e way, but if we ar e less m echanical , o ur recur rences ar e fewer? A. It is no t exactl y like that. A s I said, the re ar e m any dif ferent cate gories o f pe ople. Th ere a re p eople w hose li ves repeat automatically in exa ctly the s ame way. Other people m ay hav e dif ferent small chang es and m odif icatio ns, al l on the same level.

I still do no t unde rstand w hy tim e should be limited f or any one who has worked but not for one who has no t? A. For one who has no t be gun to aw ake , tim e is no t co unte d be caus e it do es no t exist. Everything repeats , always the same thing , ag ain and ag ain. Y ou can take it l ike this : kno wledge is limite d, but s ince such pe ople do no t take any kno wledge, for the m it is not limited. T hen, as I said, y ou can dr aw a co mpariso n with an o rdinar y scho ol: it is not possi ble always t o re mai n in the same class—o ne mu st either mak e progress o r go. Ce rtain de mands ar e m ade, and if pe ople do no t fulfil the se de mands the y may lose the possibil ity. S o if one has be gun to work, o ne m ust go on. S uppo se someone be gins to work and the n fails. This shows his inabil ity to work, and the n what is the m eaning of his existence ? Try to think abo ut it f rom this po int o f view. Q.

Th ere m ay be sleep with possi bility of aw akening, sleep with less p ossi bility of aw akening an d sleep witho ut any po ssibil ity of aw ake ning . Q.

If pe rsonality die s with us, w hat e ffect can atte mpts to weake n it hav e in fu ture re curre nce? A. Th ere is no need to be ver y dogm atic about it; when we speak about recur rence, w e spe ak o f 'so mething ' that r ecur s, and this 'so mething ' keeps in its elf trace s of all the cr eated te nde ncie s.

The ide a of recurrence need s two d imensions of time. Th e n eed of three d imensions of time comes only with the idea of work. But the s econd dimension of time is really ver y elem entary.
