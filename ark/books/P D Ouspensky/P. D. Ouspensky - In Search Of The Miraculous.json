Further, passing to the world of m olecul es, I first o f al l cam e face to face w ith the fact that the brevi ty of the exi stence of a m olec ule i s an almost unexpected idea.

S ome co mpariso n, so me anal ogy, is necessar y in order to unde rstand what this m eans . The dy ing ce lls of our organis m and the ir replace ment by others bring us near to this ide a.

If you l ook at a s tone, shut y our eyes, and im mediate ly open the m again, it will now not be the stone which you saw; in it no t a s ingle one of the m olecul es which y ou s aw the first time now remain. But even then you did not see t he m olec ules them selves , but only the ir trace s. I cam e ag ain to the New Model of the U niver se. This explaine d al so \"why we canno t see m olecul es,\" abo ut w hich I hav e writte n in Chapte r II o f the New Model of the U niver se. Further in the last co smos, that is , in the world o f the electron, I felt m yself from the very beginning in the w orld o f six dim ensions.
