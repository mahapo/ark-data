It canno t be denie d that, in g eneral, the se ide as ar e very far from m odern thought. But as the re is no sense in r eading m y bo ok witho ut hav ing some co nce ptio n of the m eaning of the se tw o ide as I will try he re to show ways of appr oach to the m. First o f al l bo th ide as ne ed the recognitio n o f the fact that hum an tho ught can work on very differen t levels . Th e idea of esotericism is chiefly the i dea of higher m ind. To s ee c learly w hat this means we m ust first o f all realise that o ur ordinar y m ind ( incl uding the m ind o f a genius ) is no t the hig hest po ssible order of hum an m ind. The hum an mind can rise to a level almost inconceivable f or us, and we can see t he r esults of the w ork of higher mind, tho se m ost acce ssibl e to us in the G ospe ls, and the n in Easte rn Scriptur es: in the U panis hads , in the Mahabhar ata; in w orks of ar t s uch as the G reat S phinx at Gizeh, and in o ther m emorials tho ugh the y ar e few in l iteratur e and ar t. T he tr ue valuatio n of the meaning of the se and s imilar m emorials and the realisatio n o f the dif ference be tween the m and o thers w hich hav e be en cr eated by ordinar y m an, o r even by a g enius , ne eds experience, kno wledge and a s pecial training of the m ind and pe rceptio n and, pe rhaps , special facul tie s no t po ssessed by everyone. In any cas e nothing can be pr oven. So that the first s tep to wards unde rstanding the ide a of esotericis m is the realisatio n of the existence of a hig her m ind, that is , a hum an mind, but o ne w hich dif fers from the ordinar y m ind as m uch as , let us say, the m ind o f an inte lligent and educate d grown up man dif fers from the m ind o f a chil d o f six. A genius is only a \" Wunde rkind \" . A m an o f hig her mind possesses a new knowledge w hich o rdinar y man., ho wever clever and inte lligent, canno t po ssess. This is esoter ic knowledge."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Whether pe ople of hig her m ind e xist no w and hav e existed always, or whether the y appe ar on earth o nly at l ong inte rvals, is im material. T he im portant po int is that the y exist and that w e can co me into co ntact w ith the ir ide as and, thr ough the se ideas, with es oteric knowledge. Th is is the es sence of the idea of es otericism. In order to unde rstand w hat I m ean by the \" ps ychological m etho d \" it is necessary to realise first that the ordinar y hum an m ind, the one w e kno w, can al so work on very d ifferen t levels , and then to find the rela tion of t he \" p sychologi cal method \" to the \" es oteric m ethod \". We can s ee dif ferent l evels of tho ught in ordinar y life. The most ordinar y mind, let us call i t the logical m ind, is sufficient for a ll t he s imple problem s of life. We can buil d a house with this m ind, o btain f ood, kno w that tw o and tw o m ake four, that the \" Volga falls into the Cas pian S ea \" and that \" ho rses eat o ats and hay \". So that in its proper place the logical m ind is quite right and quite us eful. But w hen the logical mind meets with pr oblems which ar e to o big , and w hen it do es no t stop be fore the m but s tarts out to solve the m, it ine vitabl y falls do wn, loses touch with reality and becomes in f act \" de fectiv e \".

T he m etho d us ed by this m ind, that is , the psychological m etho d, is first of al l a m etho d of dis ting uishing be tween dif ferent levels of thinking and o f realising the fact that pe rceptio ns chang e acco rding to the powers and pr opertie s of the pe rceiving appar atus . The ps ychological m ind can s ee the limitatio ns of the \" logical m ind \" and the abs urditie s of the \" de fectiv e m ind \" — it can unde rstand the reality of the existence of a hig her m ind and o f esoteric kno wledge, and see it in its manif estatio ns. T his is im possible for a m erely logical mind. If a m an o f logical m ind he ars abo ut e sotericis m he will at once want to kno w where the p eople a re w ho b elon g to the es oteric circle. who h as seen them , and when and how he can see the m him self. And if he he ars that f or him this is no t po ssible he will then say that it is all n onsense and that no es oteri c circle exi sts at all. Logi cally he will be quite right. But ps ychological ly it is cl ear that w ith s uch demands he will not g o far in his acquaintance with e sotericis m.

The fundam ental ide a which guide d Hinto n in the cr eatio n of this m etho d of exercise s is that the aw ake ning of \" hig her co nscio usne ss \" requir es the \" casting out of the se lf \" in the visual isatio n and co gnitio n o f the w orld, i.e . the accusto ming of oneself to kno w and co nce ive the w orld, no t from a pe rsonal po int of view (as we generally kno w and co nce ive it) , but as it is .

The first exercis e suggested by Hinto n co nsists in the study of a cube composed of 27 smaller cube s coloured dif ferently and be aring de finite nam es. A fter hav ing tho roughly learned the cube made up of smaller cube s, it has to be tur ned over and learned and m emorised in the reverse order. Then the po sitio n o f the smaller cube s has to be chang ed and m emorised in that o rder, and so on. A s a r esul t, acco rding to Hinto n, it is possible to cas t out in the cube studie d the co nce pts \" up and do wn \", \" right and left \", and so on, and to kno w it inde pende ntl y of the po sitio n with r egard to one another of the s maller c ubes composing i t, i.e. probably to vi sualise i t simul­ tane ously in dif ferent co mbinatio ns.

Casting out the se lf-elements in pe rcepts, acco rding to Hinto n's ide a, is the first step to wards the de velopm ent o f hig her co nscio usness and towards the cognitio n of the fourth dim ension. He says that if the re exists the capacity of vision in the fourth dim ension, that is , if w e ar e abl e to see objects of our w orld as if from the fourth dim ension, the n we shall s ee t hem , not as we see t hem in the or dinary way, but quite differently.

This is the first rule. In the c ours e of ex pans ion and cont rac tion molecules move along the lines which c onnec t them with the c ent re. Further, we see in o ur cube that the lines co nne cting the 26 points with the centr e are no t al l equal . The lines dr aw n to the centr e from the centr es of the corner cube s are longer than the lines dr aw n to the ce ntr e from the ce ntr es of the cube s lying in the middle of the s ides of the la rge c ube.

Th erefore the f irst aim of Hatha-Yoga is a healthy body. At the same tim e, H atha- Yoga pr epares the phy sical bo dy of m an to be ar al l the har dships co nne cte d with the functio ning in him of the hig her psychic forces; hig her conscio usness, w ill, inte nse emotio ns, e tc.

One of the fundam ental ide as of Y ogis regarding the bo dy is that in its natur al state the bo dy can by no m eans be take n as the ide al appar atus it is often tho ught to be. Many functio ns are only necessary to pr eserve the existence of the bo dy in various unf avourable conditio ns; and the re are functio ns w hich ar e the result of other, wron g, fu nction s.

This is the \" posture of Buddha \", so-cal led be caus e the sitting Buddha is us ual ly represented in this \" A sana \" .

W e usually rem ember on ly those dreams which w e hav e when ne ar to the po ssibil ity of aw ake ning . Dreams which we have in deep sleep , i.e. far from the p ossibility of awaking, w e do not remember at all. People who say the y do no t remember dr eams sleep very soundl y.

And, as a ce rtain par t of the inne r ins tinctiv e work of our organis m is be st pe rformed in de ep sleep and canno t be well c arried ou t when a m an is on ly half asleep , it is ob vious that the a bsence of deep sleep weakens the or ganism, preven ts it renewing its spent forces and eli minating t he used-up subs tance s, and so on. The organis m do es no t rest sufficie ntl y. A s a r esult it cannot produce s ufficiently good w ork, is soon er w orn ou t, m ore ea sily falls ill. In a word, deep sleep , that is, sleep w ithout dreams, is in all r espects m ore useful than sleep with dreams. And the exp erimenters w ho en courage p eople t o remember their dreams rende r the m a tr uly bad s ervice . The less a man remembers his dreams the more soundl y he sleeps and the be tte r it is for him .

A w eak, unhappy , cowardly man sees him self brave, strong, attaining e verything he de sires.

First of all, an exact definitio n of inf inity dis penses with the ne cessity for m ixing up phy sics with geometry, w hich is the favourite ide a of Einstein and the foundatio n of no n-Euclide an g eometry.

Th e difference between infinity in mathem atics and infinity in geom etry is quite clear a t the first gla nce. Mathem atics does not es tablish two i nfinities for on e f inite quantity . G eometry be gins with this . Let us take any finite line. W hat is inf inity for this line? We hav e two ans wers: a line co ntinue d into inf inity , o r the squar e, o f w hich the given line is a side. What is inf inity for a s quar e?
