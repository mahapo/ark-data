Ward, [1891], at sac red- texts.co m [p. vii] Pref ace THIS is no doubt a str ange book. An atte mpt to gathe r a meaning out of a few of the involv ed, crabbed, and mystica l quat rains of the great seer of Fra nce, the grea test perhaps that the world has ever seen, must of nec essity be strange. My trea tment, too, may possibly seem to man y no less strange than the sub ject- matter itse lf. I will speak special ly as to thi s latt er poi nt tow ards the clo se of the pref ace. In last December treat ing upon Nos tradam us in the Gentlema n's Magazine , I had occa sion to rema rk tha t ever y hone st man of awakened power s is a kind of pro phet, and has to do with the futur e, or eterni ty, as it is usual ly sty led. Since then I have come upon the sam e idea in the writ ings of Phil o Juda eus. He thin ks tha t the Scri ptures testi fy in some sort that eve ry goo d man is a prophet : \"For a pro phet says nothing of his own, but everythi ng tha t he says is stran ge, and prompt ed by some one els e; and it is not lawful for a wicked man to be an inte rprete r of God, as also no wic ked man can be pro perly said to be inspire d; but this state ment is only appro priate to the wise man alone, since he alo ne is a soun ding instrum ent of God's voice .\"-- PHILO, Heir of Divin e Thin gs, section 52, Bohn , ii. 146. Agai n, at page 30 of this book, it will be see n that I hav e desc ribed the faculty of anticip ating the future, a thin g so remarka bly develope d in Nostrad amus, as bein g, if once we admi t its existe nce in him, a perc eptive endow ment of the whole huma n race , that must be cla ssifie d as a sixth sense . I have sin ce fou nd, with no litt le del ight, that Colerid ge, in [p. viii] his \"Table Talk\" (ed. 1836, p. 19) , desi gnated such facult y as \"an inn er sen se,\" for, speak ing of ghost s and dreams , he says; 'It is imp ossibl e to say whe ther an inne r sens e does not really exist in the mind, seld om dev eloped , inde ed, but whic h may have a power of presenti ment. All the exte rnal senses have their corresp ondent s in the min d; the eye can see an object befo re it is dis tinctl y appr ehende d; why may there not be a corr espond ing power in the soul? The power of proph ecy might have bee n mere ly a spiritu al exc itatio n of this dorma nt fac ulty.\" [*1] [p. ix] In the mat ter of proph ecy, Photius says, in his \"Amp hiloch ia,\" that prophecy is by no means necessa rily connect ed wit h virt ue: for that Herod pre- announc ed, as it were , that the Gentile magi, Judae a, and the world were about to recog nize Christ for King, and so he desired to mak e away with him. In this way he play ed the part of prophet to the whol e huma n race . Caia phas, he thi nks, was not consc ious of what he said; in the mania of a desire to kil l, his lips prophe sied that it was right that one should die to save the whole world. \"Let his bloo d be upon us and upon our childr en,\" is a forebodi ng ins tinct of the same descri ption. In the coun cil of the Pharis ees (John xi. 48), it was prop hetic, \"If we let him alone, the Rom ans will come and take awa y our place and nation;\" and though they followe d out then"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"own counse l, thi s is just what hap pened. \"And see,\" he add s, \"th e ass in the Old Test ament could foreca st fut ure things.\" He was an heretic al wri ter, Photius , but he was evi dently not so far away, as the world is now, fro m beli eving that prop hetic endowm ent is a sen se wid ely distribu ted to human ity in gener al. These hint s alon e may furnis h us with food for usefu l medi tation . [p. x] Now, with all this a reader will very likely say, Supposin g we grant you the prop hetic as a sixth sense, to be hencef orth reckone d as a perma nent though gene rally latent endow ment of the race, what is the good of such a sen se, supp osing, with you, that your pro phet can nev er be unders tood till after the even t has taken place, and then only whe n some drudg ing interpre ter has untw isted his tortuo us lan guage and thrown it into the intelli gible vernac ular? Ther e are severa l ways of replying to this. First, are the re not thous ands of obje cts in the domain of nat ure that man has not yet disco vered the use of? Anat omists are still at a stand to tell us wha t is the use of the sple en. What natu ralist can say for what reason the noxious serpe nt is sent into the worl d? Why was the Georgium Sidus only discov ered by Hers chel in 1781 , inst ead of by Pyth agoras , a much gre ater man? Sensible men have commonly to content themse lves with simpl y asce rtaini ng the exist ence of a fact, and they have to res t all the whil e in total ignoran ce of why this fac t exis ts. Again, suppose you believe , as the majori ty do, in the Chri stian revela tion; how can you accoun t for the mult iplici ty of sects who read the Bible each in its own way? Can you accoun t for a divine revelat ion that rev eals one thi ng to one man and a cont rary thing to anot her? Obvious ly, then, there are many thing s that exist as facts, and yet no man living can assign the reason for the m. Wit h rega rd to any fact tha t can be asse rted, the first thing to estab lish is, Is it a fact? That once set tled, you may wait for the rest of it until you can get it. But again, and with special regard to Nostrada mus, you wil l see (and by refe rring to the ind ex you may find the vari ous places at whic h I treat of it) that he must have had the who le seq uence of vis ions passing clear ly bef ore his eyes , with some voca l utte rances occas ionall y acco mpanyi ng [p. xi] them , by which the nam es of men and plac es and thing s were annou nced to him. His meth od was to set this down in pro se nar ration , eith er dur ing the sitt ing or inst antly afterw ards. On ins pectio n, at cooler inter vals, and when he had desc ended from the hea t and ecstas y of fatidic al rap ture, he wou ld dis cern at once that the sequenc e must be broken and the names conce aled. If, as it stood in pros e, it had been und erstoo d by the wor ld, it would have fallen not as a prophecy but as a thunder bolt; not as a thi ng in book- form, but as an ear thquak e, tha t must have chang ed or shaken the face of Europ e, and so have int erfere d perp etuall y with its own realizat ion. Seei ng thi s, he follow ed the pract ice of the elder oracles of Delphi, Dodona , and the rest. He bro ke up the sequence , thre w the uttera nces into metre, mingled much lear ning linguis tic to darke n them , and obscur ed the names , of the gre at men intr oduced , unde r the impene trable mask of the anagr am. Thus reg arded, it is not a subj ect for wond er tha t he did thi s: it would have been akin to madnes s to have done anyth ing else. It now bec omes desirab le tha t I should furnish some clue to enab le a reader to arri ve rap idly at the pith of this book and its orac ular forecas ts, so that he may disc ern for hims elf in a few minut es, whether, or whether not, the top ics treated"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"of have for him a suff icient inter est to lead him on to make a thoroug h stud y of the book, or to declin e it altoget her. There is a huge pre judice in this our day that sets in str ongly with the mul titude again st any thing that endeavo urs to deal seri ously, or by mysti cal insight, with things occul t, spi ritual , or future. The reader , firs t of all, should glance over the lif e of Nostrad amus. It wil l be for him to deter mine whether my vindicat ion of his name from imp osture be adequate or not. [p. xii] [par agraph conti nues] Dr. Cobham Brewer is the most recent write r who aspers es him as a \"char latan\" (see his \"History of Germany, \" p. 164).

Phil os,\" Book I. chap. vii. p. 59, ed. 1727) that Apolloni us sai d bitt erly of the Jews that they were the most inept of barbaria ns, and neve r inve nted a singl e thin g usef ul to mankin d. Tha t they were what Bacon would call a people of \"no frui t.\" They tau ght nothing in the ir sch ools, says Burnet, of the circ le of the scie nces, \"ad encyclop aediae studi a,\" as we do now, but that no race in the world so abounds with prophe ts, and men endowe d with the celesti al spi rit, as \"the Jews .\" Thos e who care anythin g for the occult process es, that inc ite to proph etic utte rance, would now do well to read the chapt er on magic, comme ncing at <pa ge 67>. It gives a few hints as to the prac tices of ade pts, and of the Roman supe rstiti ons about tripods, alpha betic interr ogator ies, and so forth; and it beco mes tolerabl y clea r from all this, that Nostrada mus was skil led in all the know n meth ods of incan tation , astr al, pharmace utic, or ele ctrica l, and that he prac tised them in all their fulnes s, tho ugh with ret icent circum specti on, and very relu ctant and enigmati c avow al. The acco unt of the conspir ators agains t Vale ns (<pa ge 77> ) stro ngly resembl es the moder n tabl e-turn ing. But, as this chapte r is more curio us by far than nec essary , it may be passed over by all those who merely wish to appraise quick ly the value of Nostrada mus [p. xiii] as a figur e in history with claims to propheti c facu lty hanging on to it. From the Histori cal Fragment s, com mencin g at <page 81>, it will be see n that he clea rly prophesi ed the viole nt dea th of Henri II., to whom he dedicate s his \"Lum inary Epistl e.\" The hist orical conte xt is very interes ting, as sho wing not only the exact fulfilm ent of the forecas t of Nostrad amus; but, that another astr ologer , who was consulte d by the kin g, had forew arned him in almos t the same word s of the sam e dang er thr eateni ng, that he should die \"in due l.\" We see the king adher ing to the literal word duel, and out of court etiquet te fee ling the mani fest impossi bility of the prop hecy being fulfill ed.

The mass acre of St. Bart holome w's Day, at <page 94>, stands out in all its viv id hor ror, and as proc eeding from the very han ds of le roi farou che; but, compress ed int o four lines only . The coming of Henri IV. to the Fre nch throne is intr oduced with the very nam e of his family , Vend ome, figured in the anag ram Mendosus . Here we find als o (<pa ge 116> ) the execut ion of the Marshal de Biron; his nam e is actuall y give n as Robin, whic h yiel ds it letter for letter in ana gram. This, too, is conc erning a man not prob ably born when the [p. xiv] stan za was devis ed. The name of the mars hal is disgu ised, becaus e it would have mark ed him out too dis tinctl y when he came upo n the stage of pub lic life; but, the name of Lafin is given , the subord inate indivi dual who bet rayed Biron to the King. It occupie s page s to describ e this event , but with the ter seness , reap pearin g cons tantly , whic h is so rema rkable a fea ture in the style of Nos tradam us, he comp resses the whole event, and all that he has to say upo n it, into six lin es. The chapte r on Louis XIV. (<page 132>) teems with curiosit ies of the same insc rutabl e orde r; tho ugh less sta rtling than what we have alrea dy poi nted out, yet is it quite suffic ient to have made the reputati on of an ord inary man. We may now pass to Eng land (<page 146>), and the qua train relati ng to its seven gove rnment al cha nges, throug hout a perio d of two hun dred and nin ety years; this is as startli ng as anythi ng of the kind can well be. The next insta nce, that on the Stua rt Dyn asty (<page 149>), conve ying, as it does, the struggle betwe en Cha rles I. and Cro mwell, is simply miracul ous; and it should chall enge the att ention of a list ening world. This would seem to be the ine vitabl e resu lt, unless the lea rned of all ord ers and degr ees can, sin gly or combi ned, do away with the interpre tation put upon it. Lon ole is now for the first time pointe d to as bein g the anagra m of Old Noll, or Oli ver Cromwell . But before this transp ired, M. le Pellet ier had none the less applied the quatrai n to Charles and Cromwel l. If this fails to conv ince a read er tha t he is in the pre sence of a seer and work er of wonder s, I do not know what can bring recogni tion home to him. The single line (<page 152>)- - \"Sen at de Londre s mett ront a mort leur Roy.\" has , as present ing the exec ution of Cha rles I., mad e, in former [p. xv] but forgot ten days, the roun d of the wor ld, and from time to tim e has served to keep alive a sor t of dumb admissio n that there had once been a fatidic al div iner of note called Nostrad amus. Burns remark s, wha t we all kno w, tha t \"the passi on of pryi ng int o futu rity, makes a stri king part of the history of human nature.\" It does not look much lik e it, though , when such a prop hecy as this has been allowed to pass out of memory; so that few even of edu cated men could re-sylla ble it to you, or furnish you with any bette r crit icism on the man who pen ned it, than that he was an old French imposto r and astrol oger. They know ten time s as much about Moth er Shi pton, concer ning whom little or noth ing is authe ntic; whilst Nost radamu s's book has been probab ly in print for nearly three hundred and fifty year s."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"The next is a quatrain on Cromwell exclu sively (<pag e 156> ), \"mo re but cher than king ,\" as Nostra damus calls him; and he will be foun d to regard Napole on (<p age 206> ) in very much the same light. He gives England an asc endanc y of the sea s (<pa ge 159 >) for a str etch of more than three hundre d year s,-- a term which, I thin k, wil l be found to be on the point of exp iring now. Of cour se his quatr ains rela ting to Engl and are, on the whole, much inferior in interest to those relating to France. What stands colle cted under the hea ding of \"Eng land\" will, neve rthele ss, well rep ay per usal. The Battle of Dunb ar, for inst ance (<page 179>) is in its way as vivid , thou gh con veyed in but four lines of ver se, as Carly le's famo us acc ount of the engage ment which is give n in the Cro mwell Letter s. He prop hesies the death of Crom well (<page 184>) to fal l on the 3rd of Septembe r, seve n year s late r than the battle of Wor cester . It is true we gather this by impl icatio n, but with all the othe r wond ers duly wei ghed, a cand id rea der will admi t this to be the probabl e inte ntion [p. xvi] and true meaning here. The Fire of Londo n is given as fall ing out in 1666 (at <pag e 187> ). His name for the Frenc h Revo lution is Le Commu n Adve nement , whic h I render The Vulg ar Adv ent. This, right up to the ver y end, is the most astou nding part of all that has been recorded by Nostrada mus, or brou ght into int elligi bility by his comm entato rs. This pre face would run to far too grea t leng th wer e I to attem pt even to touch upon all of the poin ts of intere st, that we here find to be so stra ngely dealt with. Take merely the first stanza (<page 198>). Napol eonism is spok en of, almos t befo re it has been ann ounced , as proscri bed; and, to sprin g up agai n as it did in 184 8; and then to sin k fina lly seventy- three years after. At that passa ge (at <page 198>) the reader may see how, out of the mouth of Nap oleon hims elf, the exa ct ter m of seventy -three years prove s to be the correc t peri od. This has never been so much as hin ted before. If any thing be mir aculou s, in the accu racy of prev ision, I thi nk thi s may, --and with but lit tle supersti tion,- -be deem ed to be so. Ther e is a remar k to be made of some imp ortanc e, to my thi nking, becau se it esta blishe s the subtle analo gy tha t some times subsis ts in the relation betwe en thin gs, that are not general ly rec koned to hav e any connec tion one wit h the other. Now, the Vulgar Advent , of course, is signaliz ed by the usurpati on of govern ment by the peo ple; but is it not highl y sign ifican t that , out of the natur al fou ntain of speech, and with no parti cular or con scious inten tion accompa nying, the low prol etaria n rabb le, that bri ng it about in blo od, are spon taneou sly designat ed by them selves and others as the Rouge s? The abhor rent many, when they pla y the desp ot, don the colour red, and doff for ever, as they hop e, the royal purpl e. They may hope what the y plea se; but, whe n thei r vice s ripe n, the y must fall under the empire of one,-- [p. xvii] who is iro n-shod , swor d-girt , and rat- eaten as to the hear t,-- who will tramp le them into order. Call him Lonole, Olesta nt, or cleme nt Cae sar, which you wil l; a beas t from the abyss must arise to rule the bestial. This is the truly repr esenta tive man who emerg es at the epochs. Rousse au, the red- head, with the curs e of Iscario t upon him, may begin the seri es. A red philosop her first intr oduces his Pandemo nium as orde r; sec ondly, Les rouges rouges le rouge asso meront (<pag e 239> ); and third ly, the dest royer, the Napoleo n, or Apolly on, intr oduces and then crowns himself with his own hand . A red seri es in a red sequel so scaled, so shuts the same ."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"As we are upon analogi es, another curiou s one may here be noted.

Take next the arre st at Varenn es (<p age 215>), and then another mirac le of precis ion shines forth; for Saulce, the grocer's name in that little town, is preg iven (<page 217>). The Tuileri es are menti oned by name ,--a place where burnt a tile- kiln, when Nostrad amus was ind iting for us the prop hecy. Now refer to the Napol eonic rule (<page 250>). See Napoleo n horn in the west of Euro pe, and the way he could seduc e, in a lang uage not his own, is poi nted out to you; and, his name is to be a name that the Fates know (<p age 251>).

If the word \"scienc e\" mer ely means the stud y of nature, it has my adm iratio n as a pursu it. But if it mean s know ledge, I say it is an absolute misn omer. There is no true knowled ge out of wisdom, and all that is wisdom in man is compris ed in his venerati on of Deity. \"The fear of the Lord is the beginn ing of wisd om.\" It is evident , that what we cal l scie nce in this day, does not tend that way at all .

Anot her word abo ut Ato ms, and I must hav e done , or this will not be a prefac e, but a metaphys ical treatis e; and thoug h that may be grea tly wanted, this is not the plac e for it. Yet, as I have arrai gned science , it becomes advis able that I should furn ish to the compete nt rea der a spot or foot hold, where being placed , he may, if he will, command my meaning. In the Chal daic oracles there occur two curious line s; I quote them below that the re may be no equiv ocatio n poss ible. [*1] \"Now, thes e fabr icate indivi dual things (ta atoma, atoms), and sensibl e obje cts, and corp oreal things , and things class ed und er mat ter.\" The Neoplato nists said that idea s were an emanatio n of the div ine fire. Plato said ver y much the same thing of the human soul itself. An atom thu s beco mes a fiery indivi dualit y (ato mic); not, obse rve, what the nons ensica l chem ist of to- day call s it,- -when by his terre ne fire he has reac hed vapour,- -an infinite ly div isible atom, but a parti cle indi visibl e; tha t, hav ing traverse d all the forms, goes out at the oth er end of matt er; or back again in a chariot of fire to the idea it starte d from . The worl d's Opifex made it by fire, and the tradit ion of Elias is that it will be diss olved by fir e at last; but wha t, fri end, should it pro ve tha t it is ever y day doin g so always? A fie ry ide a bega n it, and in an idea of fire it ends . Also [p. xxi] man' s life is nothing but a leap through matte r from fire to fir e. The ordea l by fire was a type of thi s. The profes sional criti c and expert must, after this sketch , be left to himse lf to judg e of everyth ing here set down accord ing to the establi shed rules of art, and the intere sts multifar ious of the specia l lite rary organ he may write for and deri ve emo lument from. I exp ect but litt le rec ogniti on fro m such criti cism; yet, as it is often the res ult of a lif e devo ted to study and of wide learn ing, its indi fferen ce, or even its hostilit y, is likely to prove useful,- -wheth er by its faul t-find ing or in its disc overy of act ual error. Whateve r its sagaci ty may in this way show to be wrong, I hope to rec eive with equanimi ty and thank fulnes s, and to put rig ht sho uld a second editi on by asked for.

What remai ns to be sai d touc hing my meth od of treatm ent will pro bably have no"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"inte rest whateve r for such critic, nor yet for the general reade r. It purely , and I think solely, concer ns the thoug htful and capable reader .

Such a rea der I would only forewar n agai nst two prel iminar y obje ctions , that might at a hasty first glanc e tend to excite some prejudic e in his min d.

This is absolu te arr ogance [p. xxii] ever ywhere in the esti mation of the mult itude, learn ed and unlea rned. Reader , gent le and capab le, let me give you my view on these two points: could I mak e it also your view, how well rew arded should I be. As to epis odes: my own view of a book is this, that it sho uld furnish a stim ulus to thought if possible at every page; that not hing should enter into it for the sake of bookmaki ng; and that , so long as the subject of the book is clearly and cons ecutiv ely advanced , anyt hing else, that can vita lly be throw n in without inte rrupti on, is so much the more gained to the worl d in the stu dy of itself , or, in other words, in the study of man; thi s Pope has, I incl ine to think right ly, rule d to be his proper vocat ion here. Very clo se and conse cutive treat ment of a diff icult matter must always , when long contin ued, weigh down the spir its, and some what fatigue the attenti on of the reader. At suc h a time an intere sting epis ode happily introd uced will rally the spir its; and, by a mom entary diver sion, will renew the attenti on, enabling the reader to att ach himself again with vigour to the mai n thre ad. There are epis odes of cour se, as there are other things, good and bad. The epi sode that is dull in its elf and dist racts attent ion is bad; that whic h is in itse lf int eresti ng and relie ves fatigue, carry ing the mind back to the main subje ct ref reshed , is entirel y good . The episod es in the followin g page s the read er wil l judg e to be good or bad as they fall und er the rule given above or tran sgress it. The charge of arroganc y is a littl e more diffi cult to deal with, and also to rebu t. But even here I do not desp air of being exone rated by the capab le rea der, whom alone , on this point, it is requisi te to addres s. Man y year s ago I came upon a passage in Col eridge to the effe ct tha t he had alw ays pursued light, belie ving that it must lea d to truth, and truth to happi ness; but that, let it consumm ate in joy or not , foll ow [p. xxiii] it he woul d, for truth 's sak e.

I shut the book up, and said , So will I; and, with certain failu res, much inte rrupti on by necess ary duties, and innumera ble personal short coming s, so I have . The result has been an ever- increa sing solitud e, [*1 ] unti l at last no erem ite of the desert is mor e alon e than I for years have been.

But, anoth er thi ng the re is that helps to dimi nish Colerid ge in the general esti mation .

Tycho Brahe (1546), D'He rbelot (1625 ) the great Orient alist, and Bruce (1730) the Abyssini an trav eller, were all born on the same day of the mont h. Coi nciden ces such as these are, perha ps, not wort h much ; yet, do they int erest us les s than the rainfal l of a mont h, or the precise pressu re of the wind on Cleopa tra's needle ?--whi ch goe s by the name of Cleo patra becaus e Cleo patra had nothing whatev er to do wit h it. Robert Etie nne, the gre at pri nter, was also bor n in 1503. What would, however , more have affe cted the fam ily of Nostr adamus is the expu lsion of the Frenc h from Naple s on Octo ber 31, 1503 , afte r the famous battl es in April, fough t on two con secuti ve Frid ays with dis aster to the Frenc h; the battl es nam ely, of Semi nara and Ceri gnola. Many have said that the evil omen attachi ng to Friday dates from that peri od. If we had neve r hear d of Good Friday we also might have been of thei r opin ion. His father , like Milto n's, a notar y, was James Nostr adamus , a name whi ch is equi valent to de Notre Dame. [*1] [p. 4] [par agraph conti nues] Moreri calls his family \"une famille noble ;\" [*1 ] othe rs say that he was of Jewish descen t, but of a family that had been con verted to Chri stiani ty, and that he claimed to be of the tribe of Issachar , deri ving thence his gift of prop hecy, for they wer e \"men that had understa nding of the times , to know what Israel ought to do\" (I Chron. xii. 32); or, as in Esth er i. 13, \"the seve n wise men that knew the times .\" It is tru e that but few of the orthodox comm entato rs int erpret these passa ges as signi fying astrol ogical or propheti c fore cast; but that may be, neverth eless, the real meaning (vid. Poole' s \"Syn opsis\" ). How could Nostra damus be of Issach ar, as that was one of the los t trib es? would be a natural inquir y enou gh; and one could only answer it, as the wit did , in a case some what similar , that He could only res emble Issach ar in being a grea t, \"st rong ass\" (Gen. xlix. 14). His mother 's nam e was Renee de Sai nt Rem y. Her ances tors by the father 's and moth er's side were men skill ed in mathem atics and medicine : one was physicia n to Rene , or Renatus , titu lar King of Jerusa lem and Sici ly, and Coun t of Provenc e; whil st the other was physici an to John, Duke of Cala bria, who was the son of King Rene . Our author , in his Com mentar ies, says that a knowled ge of mathem atics had trad itiona lly descende d (de main en main ) to him fro m his early progen itors; and, in the Pre face to his \"Centu ries,\" he adds: \"Que la parole hered itaire de l'oc culte predic tion sera dans son estom ac int erclus e.\" It was his great -grand father [*2] who gave him , almo st as in spo rt, a first taste for the celestia l scie nces. After the death [p. 5] of this relative he was put to sch ool at Avign on, to study his humanit y cour ses,"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"and thence he went to the universi ty at Montpe llier, to acquire philos ophy and the theo ry of medici ne.

It is anci ent, and is said to have been founde d by Arabian phys icians when forced to fly from Spain --More ri say s in the yea r 1196 , by the disc iples of Ave rroes and Avicenna . Its inhabi tants are reputed to be witty and most polit e.

But a numbe r of kinglet s, suc h as the King of Aragon and the King of Maj orca, appear at differen t time s to have had seig norial right s in Montpel lier; and many chu rch councils have been held there.

She grow s so angr y that she can har dly even see that Young is a poet in any sense of the word. She might easily have found out that he was, by comp aring some of her own verses with his. Anot her point of inter est to us in regar d to Montpel lier is the revers al of public opin ion touching the climate of the plac e. Bro mpton, sixty or eighty years ago, was, from the mildness and salubri ty of its air, cou pled with its then semi- rural aspe ct, called \"the Montpell ier of Londo n.\" The anal ogy could never have bee n very rema rkable , as Brompto n is about on a level with the River Thame s, whe reas Mont pellie r's splendid prome nade of the Place de Pey ron is 168 feet above the sea- leve l, whi lst the whol e town runs up the hills ide, as its name express es. Still, the phrase testi fies to the opinio n then preva lent. Owing to the brigh tness of its atmo sphere and the bea uty of its suburbs , the town was lon g reco mmende d by British phys icians as a health -resor t to patient s suff ering from pulmona ry com plaint s; but the weathe r-vane of science has now reve rsed that opinion entire ly. Its clim ate is foun d to be chan geable , its sunshi ne is blazin g, its atmos phere is cha rged with dust that is imp alpabl e, all the while that it seems to be clear ; and its cold mist ral blasts do but porten d a spot mos t sing ularly hurtf ul to the lungs. The fash ion varies in loca lities , drug s, the ories, and treatme nt, and as a healt h reso rt for Engli sh peo ple the repu tation of Montpell ier has pass ed awa y; but the \"Eco le de Medeci ne\" still retains its ancient renown as the cent ral seminary of medi cal instruct ion in Franc e.

No soo ner had he done so than the rumour ran from mouth to mout h, at home and abr oad, that some thi ng mar vellou s and admi rable had appeared . One cannot see of what use they could be to the publ ic, as they could not possibl y be underst ood till the y were inter preted after the event and by it. In some of the quatrain s he says as much himsel f. He no dou bt pub lished them becau se he felt an inte nse longing so to do; and, whe n the mind of a man reac hes this sta ge of desire , it will not take him long to find some excelle nt reas on for carry ing out the impuls ion. Public good, the advancem ent of relig ion, the susten tation of faith, the psy cholog ical inferen ce as to the immor ality of the huma n soul , or any oth er goo d phra se, will ser ve a man as a suff icient reaso n for doin g what he wants to do. That man must be a great search er int o his own cons ciousn ess, if he cannot readil y assu me tha t the motive assig ned in such a case is the cau sa cau sativa of the act of put ting forth. More ri's account is not exac tly the same as that of our memoir. Moreri descr ibes him as bei ng inv ited to Lyon s in 1547, but as return ing very qui ckly to Salo n, only to find tha t his popula rity at the latter place had greatly abate d. The disa ppoint ment he expe rience d from this treatm ent made him withd raw a good deal from socie ty, and comm it him self the mor e to hard study. He tell s us that he had for a long time previo usly practis ed div inatio n; now he began to think himse lf to be directl y insp ired as to the fut ure. [p. 10] [par agraph conti nues] From this time, as the lights occurr ed to his mind, he began comm itting them to wri ting at the moment . He set the m down at first in plain pros e, if you can call enigm atical sente nces plain prose; at any rate, they were not writte n in verse. Gare nciere s' ver sion varies again. With him it is, that Nostrada mus found by expe rience that the perfect knowle dge of medic ine is unatt ainabl e with out the aid of astrolo gy, to which he now addi cted himself . It is an allurin g scie nce, and one towa rds the purs uit of which his natural geniu s stro ngly dispose d him, so that he made very rapid progre ss in it. His firs t publ icatio ns in this line consiste d of alma nacs, accord ing to the custom of the time, for profit and recreati on's sake; and in the se he so hap pily hit off the conjunc ture of even ts tha t both he and his publ icatio ns bec ame greatly sought after . It is some what curious that so few of thes e alma nacs appear to be now extant. One would have exp ected that documen ts of such inter est, once in type, would not perish entire ly fro m all househ olds and libr aries. It may, how ever, be tak en as a proo f of the mae lstrom of time tha t engu lfs everythi ng, so that by the perio d when poste rity grows interes ted in any even t, all its belated quest ioning s are presen ted with a univers al bla nk. The spir it of litera ry pir acy, too, seems to have been rife in those early days. The succ ess of his work soon bec ame a cause of dis credit to him, as it led ente rprisi ng pri nters and booksell ers to vend, under his name, almanac s dest itute of everyth ing that had const ituted the merit of his. When the work made its appea rance, it divided the public. Some called the prophet a simple visiona ry, or, in coarser phras e, a fool; others accuse d him of mag ic, and of bei ng in too close treaty with the Devi l to be hone st.

Char les IX. made a pro gress throug h the kingdo m in 1564, to quie t the cities that had mutini ed; and when he came to Proven ce, on arriv ing at Salon , Nove mber 17th, he asked first of all for Nostrada mus. Nostrad amus was in the suite of magis trates arou nd the king, so that he was presente d on the ins tant, upon which the kin g made him his Physicia n in Ordinar y, and honou red him with the title of Coun sellor . He comp lained rathe r bitt erly of the neglec t with which his follow- townsm en tre ated him. Cesar Nostr adamus repor ts thi s, say ing, \"Et de ce, me souvi ens fort [p. 15] bie n, car je fus de la part ie\" (Moreri) . On the ret urn journey he aga in inq uired for Nostra damus, and gave him two hundre d ecus . He was at this time over six ty, and with his hea lth fast bre aking under severe attac ks of gout. He die d with in abou t sixt een months of this perio d, and the salary and profits of Phy sician in Ordi nary must have gre atly comfort ed the old man in his latter days. He enjo yed now the further satisf action of being flocked to by learne d men, grand ees, and othe rs, who reso rted to him far and near , as to an oracle. \"As St. Jer ome remarks of Livy, so may we rem ark of him,\" says his biograph er, Jean Aim es, \"that those who came to Fran ce sou ght Nostrada mus as the only thing to be seen the re.\" The closin g scen e is now dra wing very near, and we find him much affli cted with his maladi es, notably arthri tic gout, as disti nguish ed fro m poda gra, which Dr. Cull en con siders as the seat of idiopath ic gou t.

This is the inte rpreta tion put upo n it by M. le Pell etier. As I unders tand Cesar Nost radamu s, the king did not send for him to Arles, but asked again for him on his majest y's return to Salo n; and I sho uld think the word \"amba ssade\" must refer to some private missio n the king had sen t him upon entirel y apar t from this, and for which he pai d him. Be this as it may , the fact that Nostrada mus assigns no date for his dea th, in this presag e, goe s to establi sh its authe nticit y, one would incl ine to say.

It is a touc h of prose more than of the Pyth on. On the whole, I shou ld inc line to take the verse for a genuine eman ation from the pen of Nostrada mus.

Now, judici al astr ology could give no help in [p. 28] such cases , sinc e to commenc e cast ing a nativi ty pre suppos es bir th. In his epistle to his son Cesar we shall see what he says of himsel f and the gifts he posse ssed; but even there he was oblige d to be some what obscure , to protect himse lf fro m the ridi cule of the world on the one side, and fro m the severi ties of the Church on the other. He tells his son to esc hew the stud y of the fut ure astrolog ically , to avoi d magi c, as prohib ited by the Church and Scriptu re, and that he himself had burn t some books that taught the art of prophe sying, altho ugh it is pretty evident that he had firs t read them throug h very caref ully himself . He relates that a migh ty fla me bur st for th fro m them to the dang er of his house, and thi s he inte rprete d to be the conseq uence of the ir fal sity. But yet he seems to have gone thro ugh a good many of the magical forms when he was about to devote the nig ht to prop hetica l stud ies. He hold s that inspi red Revelati on is \"a par ticipa tion of the Eter nal Divinity ,\" tho ugh he scarc ely lays cla im to being a prop het in this sense of the wor d; in fact, he den ies himself to be such a proph et. But, fai ling to clai m insp iratio n, and denou ncing the practice of astrolog y and the pursuit of magi c, one is left som ewhat in the dark as to what he real ly did profe ss to be the sour ce of fatidi cal utteranc e poss essed by him . That he had the gift in a marv ellous poten cy thi s book will show; and that he openly claim ed to posses s it his whole life proves. It is, in fact, from this I should desire to establis h that at least he was no imp ostor, for he only told others what he beg an by implic itly beli eving himsel f. As to his obscur ity, he hims elf admits it as a thing to be culti vated both in the time s he lived in and in tho se tha t were to follow. No one can truthfu lly deny that obscu rity and pro phecy seem to be almost interc hangea ble and conv ertibl e term s.

The re are those who will hold tha t prop hecies are usel ess, as they canno t gene rally be und erstoo d unti l they have been fulfill ed. It is obvious that many prophec ies are of such a nature as that, if they were clearly unde rstood previ ous to the event, they would prevent their own fulfilm ent, and so ceas e to have been pro phecie s. Wha t they foret old would never have occ urred. The phil osophy of history is sup posed to sho w that Provi dence shapes the course of huma n even ts how much soever human ity may seem at every instant to be follow ing out its own coll ective will. This theory is most in favour among st eru dite modern thin kers, who incline very little toward s acqu iescen ce in the old Chur ch doc trine of Predest inatio n. Yet inspi red prophecy is a collat eral proof of the same prin ciple as tha t whic h unde rlies the philosop hy of histor y. Bot h of them depend on the fin ger of God shaping --firs t shap ing chaos into thi ngs, and the n thin gs into their conti nuous course s. The shapi ng is not needed more at the first crea tion than it is at every succe ssive stage, wheth er for prese rvatio n or for prog ressio n. Aga in, the inte rest of unin spired proph ecy is for mortal man not much less vivid ; for, if we have interp reted Nostra damus rightl y, we find in him a man livi ng thr ee hun dred years ago tal king intelli gibly, if not clea rly, of thin gs that are happeni ng to- day. If ther e be a power in human nature,- -laten t in the gene rality , but in a few ale rt and quick ,--to link far cen turies toget her in anti cipato ry tho ught, I take it to be quite clear, that that one fact must revo lution ize the whol e sche me of human philos ophy as acce pted now, whether it rela tes to life, to death, or to futurit y. The fatid ical capacit y impl ies a spirit [p. 30] of immorta lity in man. With that once establis hed, we re- enter upon the doma in of fait h; we recogn ize that the earth is drossy and the body sin; we re- create the soul , and laugh at the fool (or the phil osophe r) who doubt s, den ies, and rid icules it. It giv es new groun d to teach the imm ortali ty of man; it lift s us above the dirt -doctr ine of gold; it renders poetry once again possib le to lips hallowe d with Apol lo's fire; it brin gs bac k a possibil ity of worsh ip upo n eart h, and , with that, pray er, praise, and peace. Bates, the silver- tongued , says well, that for man \"it is as natu ral to pray as to breath e.\" Gare nciere s is of opin ion that the writi ngs of our prophet were for a centur y allo wed to \"be in dark ness,\" but we have seen that in his own day Nost radamu s attr acted the notice of the learne d, of the nobility , and of the king himsel f. Gare nciere s says that the first book the y gave him at scho ol aft er the prime r was \"The Centu ries,\" so it was not neg lected then; and M. le Pelleti er rem arks that Nost radamu s's fame has now been before the wor ld for three hundr ed yea rs, with an alwa ys gro wing recepti on. Of cours e, as time wanes, and as fresh quatr ains become inte rprete d afte r acco mplish ment, the series must shine with an ever augment ing bril liancy and splendo ur. The king s of France have never been quite indiffer ent to the Oracle s, or at lea st to such of them as could be shown to refer to them indi vidual ly.

I hope, howeve r, whe n this book comes to be read by the compet ent few, it will be seen that there exists far mor e than a mer e name to be dealt with here ; that in Nostrada mus we have the greatest fatid ical seer, not div inely accr edited , that the world has eve r behe ld; that if accept ed as being endowe d with a rare and curio us for esight ,--aft er the sever est inquiry into what he has done has been institu ted by gramm arians , hist orians , and philos ophic critic s,-- it will next becom e nece ssary to try to look int o the causes , and so asc ertain how he oper ated.

When we come to enumer ate some few of the opin ions that have bee n expr essed on the writ ings and cha racter of Nostrada mus, it will be seen tha t a vast num ber of them cond emn him for charla tanry and impostur e, esp eciall y as we appr oach our own day. For now what is denomi nated scienc e acce pts nothing for true but what is ded ucible from the reason; it takes for gran ted that not hing can be known respec ting the futu re, beyond what cultivat ed pru dence can gather from a politi c acqu aintan ce with the past, coupled perha ps wit h a sagaciou s esti mate of the princi ples now at work , and the fruit they are likel y to engende r.

The ignoranc e of the Mid dle Ages is pointe dly contrast ed for us now wit h the wisdom and knowled ge of our own day. What, preju dice apart, does this mean, if briefly summed up in an aphorism ? Only this: that the wisdom of to- day gives us the Nihil ist of no faith, in plac e of the Ast rologe r of too muc h. We ought to reme mber in all this that our auth or had reach ed the matur e age of fift y-two before he printed one word of the work tha t we are spe nding time over. He tells us that for generat ions the fam ily of Nostr adamus had inherit ed and tran smitte d some share of the prop hetic gift (Garenc iere's Prefa ce, p. 16), that it came to him as a natural genius ; in which it seem s that his sons partiall y shar ed. He had cultiva ted it long for his priv ate pleasure , and the request in whic h his almana cs sto od see ms to have first led him to think he Might more larg ely utilize the faculty. He never appears to hav e made any large sum of money thro ugh it. He support ed him self and bro ught up his family by steady work in his prof ession al cal ling. On [p. 34] the very brink of publ icity, antic ipatin g mali gn inf luence s, he still hesita ted to take the final plunge; and, when he did take it, he was in his fifty- third year. Men seldom pass throug h life perfo rming all its duti es wit h cred it and decor um, earn a com petenc y, and at fifty- two ente r upon a car eer of conte mptibl e impo sture. No; this is not accord ing to human natur e. We must acquit him of impos ture. Mich el Nos tradam us was one of the most learned men of his day, the fri end of Jules Cesa r Scal iger. He kne w many moder n lang uages, and the Heb rew, Greek, and Latin. He had fol lowed medici ne fro m the age of twent y-two, took his Doctor's degre e at twen ty-six , fill ed a profess ional chair at Mon tpelli er, and late in life dev oted hims elf to judic ial astrolog y; in which, and in an intuiti ve for ecast beyond what that can bestow, he has dist anced by far all other competi tors in the same line. Let a read er tho roughl y acqu aint himself with all that is here set bef ore him as to Charles I. in Engla nd, and its bloody re- enactmen t in the Fre nch Revoluti on, lett ing all the rest stand aside; and, if he can ris e from the perusal , feel ing that there is any kind of impostur e disc overab le thr oughou t thos e stra nge and wond erful revela tions then he hims elf possesse s so miracul ous a form of judg ment, as to leav e me without a wor d furt her to advan ce upo n the subjec t. M. le Pell etier concei ves that the Commu n Adve nement , or l'avene ment au regn e des gens du commun, which I have rende red \"The Vul gar Advent,\" exten ding from the deat h of Louis XVI. to the reign of Anti christ , is the gra nd obj ect of Nost radamu s. It is to paint this lurid epopee that he devo tes three- quarters at leas t of his qua trains , acco rding to le Pellet ier. Myself, I thi nk thi s prop ortion to be over stated . But our prophet return s to it agai n and again, elabo rates the most minut e deta ils, and con centre s upon it as [p. 35] in a focus the brighte st ray s of his mys tical genius . Some think that Cathar ine de Medi ci was large ly inf luence d in her fir m and far- seeing policy by the couns els of Nost radamu s, who m she visite d expr essly at Sal on de Craux, in 1564, with her son, Char les IX. This may have been so, but it is a great quest ion whether Nostra damus, for all his visi ons, curious ly as they realize thems elves in tim e, cou ld adv ise the queen or any body else at all better than any oth er wis e man of ela borate cult ure could. His vis ions would come to him as vers es to a grea t poet , and when writ ten down and the afflatu s fled , he would drop back to the ordinary condi tion"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"of humanit y. He would drop back to the level of reas on and the discour se of scie nce, with nothing to spe cially disti nguish him from other men well place d to lear n such wisdo m and knowle dge as this world has to besto w upon them. To expect more of him is to expe ct wit h the common alty that if you met Mil ton in Bread Stre et he would addres s you in bla nk ver se, and stra in \"Go od mor ning\" into metre.

Nost radamu s is sometim es a pillar of fir e, but often er he is a pillar of clo ud.

As an accept ed vis ionary he is perha ps less swaye d by the ima ginati on tha n any man of at all kind red type tha t one can ment ion. With him word s are as oft en use d to veil as to unfold his mea ning. His cont empt for sim ple persons, the ignoran t, is very broadly marke d. Men of know ledge are to const itute his audience ; the heaven of prophecy is in his opinion a region unfit for chi ldren. He, clean contrar y to the exa mple set [p. 36] fort h in St. Mar k (x. 14), will suffer none such to approa ch him . [*1] He chiefly pred icts the evi l to come; what is good only figures in his page s inci dental ly, and at lon g inte rvals. But here it is to be observed that the staple of true prop hecy must always run par allel with that of histo ry; whilst, as to the latter, it has gro wn int o an axiom, \"Happy is the coun try that has no history. \" He fati gues while he fasc inates us amid the varie ty of his combinat ions; yet a deeper exam inatio n will often end in clot hing these riddlin g and vext allusio ns in a magi cal and floa ting investm ent that lif ts the m up into a calm sublimi ty. Stil l he is clea rly no proph et in the old and Hebrew sense of the word --like Isai ah, Daniel, David, John, --a man who neithe r resp ects his own perso n as regards its safety , nor the person of othe r men as reg ards their positio n. You canno t say of him: \"Scimus quia verax es, non enim respic is per sonam hominu m\" (St . Matt . xxii . 16), which is the test -touch all the wor ld ove r of a true prophe t. Le Pell etier' s summ ing- up is: c'est un arti ste en prono stics. There is a Pythic ring in all he writes and says; a sub- flavour , too, of cabalist ic lor e far gather ed from those ancie nt com promis ing books which he saw fit to burn. The outward signs of his pro cedure and methods are palpabl y magi cal, as set forth in the stanz as that open his first Century to the reade r. If we kno w that he professe d Chri stian orth odoxy, equal ly we know that he pract iced judicia l astr ology, and made unqu estion able use of the Pagan ritual of inca ntatio n. The se rit es, uncompre hended by all the erudi te in books who wrote about them, were by the divines and fathers of the ear ly Chu rch ignorant ly att ribute d to prestid igitat ion, Toledan [p. 37] art, and fraudul ent compact with the sab le fie nd. Perhaps they may tur n out to have been merely natur al exc itatio ns, empirica lly discover ed, tending to ena ble the subjec t of them more ful ly to reach a stat e of semi- consciou s ecst asy; to plac e the cerebr al lig ht in the current of lat ent light that per vades all space (if such an expr ession be permissi ble), and so elici t resu lts that are ordin arily unat tainab le by man. Bouys, who wrote in 1806, plain ly con siders him to have been a clairvoy ant. The ani mal magnetiz ers call him a cri siaque . Poss ibly all the se proc esses only served to pla ce him in a positi on fav ourabl e to clairvo yance; but on all thi s, res pected and gentle reader , cons truct your own opi nion. Let the man be to you prophe t, sor cerer, or clairvoy ant. Call him what you will, so you free him from the sti gma of impos tor.

The Greek myth about Branchu s, so far as I can see, is thi s, wit h sund ry for ms and vari ations . He was a youth of Mile tus. The rep uted son of Smicru s (Lem priere ), or Maca rcus Varro says, but beg otten by Apo llo.

His orac les at Didym a were infer ior to none but Delphi. The name Did ymean, doubl e or twai n, was from the double light of the sun and its reflec tion in the moonli ght.

The gloss of M. le Pel letier on the quat rain is as follows : that Nostr adamus , wand in hand, touches the branche s of the tri pod, like the prie sts of Branc hus (this I have tried to expunge) , and invoke s his famili ar spi rit, which appears to him in the vapour float ing above a basin of wat er, which he had consecr ated beforeh and acco rding to pre scribe d magi cal rites, and in which he dip s the fringe of his garm ent, and his feet. An involunt ary shiverin g (peu r) agi tates his hand whe n abou t to write from the dict ation (voix) of the spir it. The fati dical light shin es, and the angel is sea ted at his side.

The rod is a pen , in the mid dle of the branche s mean s his finger s, the water is the ink, and wetting limb and foot is [p. 73] cove ring the pap er all but the fou r marg ins. It is hardly unfair to say that this is both nonsensi cal and igno rant, althou gh not devoi d of ingenui ty. I think it will fit the cir cumsta nces far bet ter to take it, as I hav e done , that the wand was a fork ed lau rel branch that dipped forcibl y, lik e the winche l rod, when Nost radamu s held it over the water , that it strained , as the haz el-rod does, almo st to breaki ng, and that at this inv itatio n it is to be supp osed that the spir it app ears. The incantat ion being complete d and succes sful, the operator must be suppose d to set asi de the winch el, and assu me the pen, quakin g with a sol emn sens e of the spi ritual prese nce. This fear was , Gare nciere s says , to prevent the puff ing up of pride, as we read in Danie l, Joh n, and the 4th of Esdras .

Like the witch es' Sabb ath, these diaboli c meet ings were accompan ied by the lewdest rites , as will at once be seen by the followin g pass age from Pse llus, which I leav e untr anslat ed. It is from the Lati n tran slatio n of Psellus by Marsiliu s Fici nus, and wil l be found in his col lected works (ii. 884) in foli o ed. 1641. \"'Eu chetae et gnosci, ut dae monia toto concipi ant pectore, nefan da sac rifici a perp etrant Conve niunt die quo pass us est Salva tor, [*1] vespere, statu tur in locu m, una cum puellis sibi notis, et post qua edam sacra extinct is lum inibus , [*2] mist im coe unt, sive cum soro re, sive cum filia , sive cum qualibe t\" (Ps ellus as abov e, p. 894). \"The re is a furt her kind of vatici nation by a basin, by means of which rusti cs freq uently predi ct. just as there is a mode of predi cting by mea ns [p. 76] of the air and the lea ves of trees , so there is a kind of predic tive power in the basi n, kno wn and pract ised by the Assyri ans, which has a great similar ity to this inca rnatio n or couplin g of demons with matter.

When Lord Roc hepot was starting as ambassad or for Spai n, Ost e begg ed to accomp any him as secreta ry. Villeroy immed iately recom mended him, and he was engage d. In a few months ' time he mastered the languag e to such perf ection , and so tho roughl y acco mmodat ed him self to Span ish manners, that he migh t well pass for a true- born Spaniard . When Roche pot had got the treaty at Verv ins ratified , the King of Spai n gave him rich presents --a chain of jewel s, and six gold chains valued at a hundre d [p. 121] and fifty crowns apiec e--to distri bute amongst his suite, as he though t fit. Oste was so ful l of himself that he tho ught he ough t to have one of them, but his mast er tho ught otherwi se; on which , says Garen cieres , \"the Devil crept into his soul ,\" and , as he want ed mon ey to supply his debauch eries, he determin ed to betray the State secret s whic h pass ed thr ough his han ds. With this in vie w, he applie d to Don Fan chese, a Sec retary of State, and mad e his prop osals, but the dig nified Spani ard, for som e reas on or other, recei ved him cool ly. \"The Cat holic King was in good amity with the most Chris tian one, and requ ired to know no more tha n the French Ambas sador should commu nicate to him.\" Noth ing discoura ged, our tra itor hurries off to Don Ydiaqu es, another secret ary, and there meets with excelle nt rec eption . He was pre sented to the Duke of Lerma, to whom he betra yed the Alph abet of Ciph ers. He rece ived twelve hundre d crow ns upon the spot, and was promi sed the like amoun t as a yearl y pens ion. By his means the Spanis h Coun cil knew the conte nts of all French instru ctions as soon as the amba ssador himse lf. When La Rochep ot's mission ended , Oste got back into Vill eroy's servi ce, and so was abl e to maintai n corr espond ence with Spain. Tuxis was ambass ador from Spain in Paris , and after him Don Balt azar de Cani ga. With thes e men he est ablish ed a close intimac y, so that finally the Council in Spain got his letters before Des Barreau x at Madrid could receiv e thos e from Henri IV. Des Barrea ux tol d the King that he was always now forestal led. Oste had let a cert ain reprobat e Raff is int o his secret , and this fellow, who had bee n bani shed, in order to obta in a repriev e of sentenc e, bet rayed Oste to Des Barrea ux. When he got his pardon, he gav e up the nam e of Oste. Raffis came to Pari s to communi cate with Ville roy, and ord ers were [p. 122] give n to detain the two Span ish couriers that had reached the post-off ice.

On reachin g the post- office, he soon found he was betr ayed; and Descarde s, who was to watc h him, did not let him out of his sight until he brought him to Ville roy's. When there, he thought his man was safe, and went to announce his capture to Villeroy . Oste insta ntly ran down to the stab le, where his hors e stoo d, sti ll sad dled, and galloped away. A hue and cry was soon raise d. Ost e got a Span ish disguise at De Cunig a's, and mad e off post -haste for Luxembo urg. Postmas ters were forbidde n to let out horse s to any one; but at Meau x the postma ster had rec eived the order too late , for Oste was alre ady on horse back, but no soone r did he beg in to gallop than his horse fell unde r him. His look of disma y impr essed the postilli on who accom panied him, and he told his master on his retur n. The postm aster told the she riff, who came up with him at the secon d ferr y of la Fert e sous Jouar e; but he was alre ady on the boat, and threat ening the ferryman 's lif e, the man put him ashor e, in spite of the sher iff's comman ds, shouted to him from the bank.

The satanr y of Split Eagles gave out, that the Poles could not govern thems elves. But the fou rth article in Pet er the Great 's wil l show s that they were not to be allowed to gov ern themselv es.

The Marqui s de Bouille , in his \"Me moires ,\" ed. 1821, p. 8,--one of the few modern men who is entit led to be called a state sman,- -says of Eng land, that it is an empi re who se sup port all oth er nat ions stand in need of, and tha t its happin ess is inti mately bound up with tha t of the wor ld at large, but that if its thirst of gold shoul d dest roy its patr iotism ; or that bold dem agogue s and orator s shou ld get powe r to meddle with its fun dament al law s, it would soon become chaoti c and fall, leav ing nothing behind it but anot her great ghost of empir e peri shed, to gli mmer as an hist orical beaco n thro ugh the nigh t of time.

Perhaps did Cromwel l hims elf, or some of his conf ident advoca tes and minist ers, designe dly invent that cursed name; as it is like ly fro m what happ ened in the year 1651, when the Parl iament order ed the law- books to be tran slated out of Lati n into Engli sh, wherein the lawyers took a great deal of free dom by using the verbali a pass iva very fre quentl y, and almos t on all occa sions, accor ding to thei r own fancy and pleasure .

This in the context would have a great er app ropria teness than D. D. hims elf seems to be aware of, for the word it is con traste d with in the cont ext is les Saturn ins. This word in Nostra damus is con stantl y used for pagans, in cont radist inctio n to Albanin s, Chr istian s, rob ed in white albus.

I [p. 179] thin k that the sang du Juste furni shes thus much of certai nty as to the inte rpreta tion. It mus t rela te to one of two periods ; the death of Cha rles I. or Loui s XVI. Then it wou ld be that the Rev olutio nists, findi ng the Royal ists to be seek ing revenge, decla red against the Church, and plunged madly into a new order of things. The Menade would be mor e appr opriat e to that period than to the earlier one. Bad as they were in Eng land, there was more of lust, infide lity, and blood, corr uption , vice , and madnes s, in France . Mena de.

In the three signs, Aries , Taur us, Gemini, whic h have succe ssivel y form ed the Caput Zodia ci, none but Gemin i is of huma n figu re; that sig n must be intended by the word [p. 197] [par agraph conti nues] Bashar ion (especia lly as the word is not Bashari on at all, but Bastar nan); so tha t, til l the age of the world is six or sev en tho usand years old, i.e., till the Day of Judgmen t, thi s will last; and when the grea t day comes ther e will be found a direct desce ndant of tha t grea t king sitti ng on the English thro ne. He has tak en no notice of the Pemp otam and its durat ion of three hundr ed yea rs, as a sort of measur e of the sev en cha nges, and Nostrada mus nowhere says that the seve nth change shall endure to the end of time . Like almos t all interp reters , D. D. reads his own imagi nation into the prophecy . The reader who cares about such explanat ions as thes e will find a grea t deal more of the sam e sort in Garencie res' annotat ions upon this qua train.

He adds that if he were a great astrol oger himself he should work out exa ctly the who le cal culati on, and he thinks Aries should come to that pole in the year 184 5.

Her emulo us anta gonism to France made her so alert to defe nd her allie s that they could count upon her as a force of their own. The expenses conse quent upon this impruden t cour se led to funding, i.e. the National Debt; and that has led us int o an absurd meek ness, a drea d of war, and the peace barkin gs of the Quaker Bright; so that Engl and dares not fire a how itzer when Russia, contr ary to her most solemn pled ges, annexes Merv, Bokar a, and Khiva , and cannot find one word to say when Germ any has her foot on the throat of France. Blunde rs in extrav agant advoca cy, blun ders in pars imonio us neg lect of a principl e, do not diminish its importa nce; they only emphas ize it.

Tha t is to talk like a chronolo ger. The fir st cau se and the final are, in spiri tual matters , one. The life and death of man are reduced to two point s, and epita phs give eno ugh about most of the live s of mortal men when the y chro nicle the birth and deat h date s. \"Alo ne he return ed and was mitred. \" How, step by ste p, it all came abo ut fol lows nece ssaril y; and that is how Nostr adamus puts it to us.

I merely set it down to prove to the sceptic al, and thos e who inclin e to class Nostrad amus auth oritat ively amongs t impo stors whose jargon is not wort h the pains of inte rpreti ng, that the y may look at this and learn from it two facts: First, that befo re the event forec ast has happ ened, all the keys of interpre tation are want ing, the pro phecy looks like jargon, and is so for all pract ical purpose s; but that , seco ndly, once it has happen ed, or as we may say kis sed sunlight , the keys appe ar wit h it, the light and the unders tandin g awak en tog ether. There is light in pote nce or in posse now; but even then they will not unloc k secr ets, [p. 223] if the key s rema in in the hands of ignor ant or scien tific person s [or self- suff icient , whic h is nearly the same thi ng as scient ific], or in the hands of roma nce- readers and lazy dul lards. You will not unra vel \"the wor ds of the wise and thei r dark sayin gs\" by readi ng a quatrai n once throu gh. The inte rprete r must appr oach the wor k in a simpl e, unp rejudi ced manner; he mus t get light from history how he can ,--fro m memo irs, letters , book s,-- and lear n by the suc cess and fai lure of past commenta tors. He mus t be content to work ver y hard all the whi le, and with litt le enc ourage ment from others; and then at last he may so do someth ing, that even his neighbo urs may allo w his work to be,- -accor ding to the bent or wate rpent of the par ticula r mind of each,- -some a discov ery, some a revela tion. He him self may probab ly fee l that a sup reme patienc e has had more to do wit h brin ging the thin g to pass than any other facul ty tha t coul d easi ly be named. Thing s of the spir it mus t, of course , be spiritu ally discern ed, and all talk about faculti es when the individ ual soul is treate d of must sound a little parad oxical . To divide the unique and indivis ible unity of the soul into parts and piec es, betrays in the prop oser himself perha ps som e \"wan t of parts.\" But from the earl iest time until now, this has been the scien tific way of treat ing the huma n unde rstand ing; so let us conside r that it is right enoug h. The soul has almost always been cut int o thre e, and then left to wrig gle and wrig gle, and at last to join itsel f toge ther agai n, as best it can, like a worm in a garden . If this be accor ding to Aris totle, let all Sorbonne profe ss it for right.

Ther e is a copy now in the Bibliot heque Roya le, to which the authori ties give the date of 1558.

In opening this, Nostr adamus says he has long been in doub t as to whom he should devo te (co nsacre r) the se thr ee Cen turies , but at las t took coura ge to lay it at the feet of roya lty. Now, the edit ion of 1566 partic ularly state s that the prop hecies n'ont encor e jama is est e impr imees. One cannot read the Ded icator y Epis tle without feelin g sure it was writ ten for the eye of the King, and the refore at least as earl y as 1558, but pro bably earlie r by a year or two .

I was kind ly per mitted by Mr. Geor ge Sch arf, of the Nation al Por trait Galler y, to take the dimensi ons of this bust by meas uremen t, but pract ically they are not very usef ul, inasmuch as the head has a great abund ance of shor t curl y hair which of cour se in terra- cotta become s perf ectly solid, and thereby incre ases the circ umfere nce of the head by many inches . The circum ferenc e, hai r and all, at his brow is 28 2/8 inc hes. Nape of neck to fronta l bone , wher e it unites with nose 15 4/8 \" Brea dth from car to ear at level of the centra l hole of each ear as near as can be appr oximat ed 6 2/8 \" This last measur ement is, I believ e, cor rect, but it is a dimens ion that onl y a larg e forc eps could take wit h perf ect certaint y. It is so small, howev er, that I feel sure that the oth er two dimen sions must be very far from giving the tru e osse ous formatio n, so that several inche s will have to be allowe d off them for the hair . Agai n, the measu rement betwe en the tip of nose and back of head (9 5/8 inch es) would also req uire that deductio ns be made for a wad of hair at the back. This measu rement when reduce d, and coupl ed wit h the third measur ement given, indi cates an und ersize d skul l for a broa d-buil t man of fiv e feet eleve n in stat ure. As for the physi ognomy , the nose, though far from fine, is somew hat aquiline , and"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"the best of all the features of the face . The forehe ad is low, ill-for med, and mean . The mouth firm, cruel, decei tful. The jowl and chin sensua l and gross almost to brutali ty.

It is well perha ps to mentio n here a bus t that Grose in a letter to Granger in 1774 , call s \"a masterl y and spirit ed bus t of Oliver Cromwe ll by one Bannier. \" It was then in Mr. Gostli ng's collect ion. He says it is like that engravi ng giv en in Rapi n's \"History .\" I imagine it therefor e to be a fancy renderin g, and of very smal l hist oric value. The expert histo rians, and of cour se the gener al pub lic together with them, are perf ectly satisf ied with the Cromw ell presente d to them by Samue l Coop er. I conf ess that I think it a most lau ghable prese ntment , and of qui te imp ossibl e cred ence. I do not thi nk Pie rce's bust to be satisfa ctory, but I most certai nly cons ider that it is the only liken ess I have [p. 309] had the opportun ity of exami ning that conveys even a hint of wha t can be sup posed to be the real appeara nce of the man. There is but one way now remaini ng to settle this quest ion. It is very much to be reg retted that, with so muc h pret ence of a desi re for histo rical accura cy, we shoul d have allow ed two hundr ed and fifty years to elapse withou t maki ng the least attem pt to settle this questi on. We learn from Breval's \"Trav els\" that at the Old Pal ace at Flore nce there is a cast prese rved of Oliv er Cro mwell. The mould was obt ained from Cromwel l's face a few minute s afte r his deceas e, \"th rough the dexterou s mana gement of the Tusc an resi dent in Lond on.\" This, or a cast fro m it, ought immedi ately to be secure d for our Nation al Por trait Galler y. A copy of it would cost ver y litt le in either time, mone y, or troubl e to secure; and when secured three or fou r shou ld be cast in bron ze, and plac ed in differ ent museums so tha t one fire could not des troy all of them at once. I feel alm ost sure tha t it will be found to confirm the bust of Pierce ,, as being more like Cromwe ll tha n anyt hing else that we posses s. And furth er, as Pierc e's work is by no means a grand achiev ement in the sculp tor's art, I shoul d hope to find in the Flor ence cast characte ristic indic ations that are absent from Pierce's work . Gran deur of soul is incompat ible with such a face as Pierc e give s us. But I conf ess that I see no grande ur wha tever that could be expr essed by a man who se hist ory it that of Oli ver. His bas e succ ess the worl d may worshi p if it will . I desp ise success if it must be obta ined by Crom well's metho ds. I observ e that the grea t in history are always mean in fact ; and I well know that you mus t say to all the men who have been triump hant, let no probi ng mor alist come near you. Pit iable and contem ptible is the man who can envy the great in the greatn ess of their crim es. I do not expec t that the cast, if proc ured, will make the read ing any bett er for Cromw ell; but, if it should, I am quite ready to give him all the adva ntage of it. At present I hold that the face is villai nous, like the man .  \". . . ducitur unco, Spe ctandu s: gau dent omnes. Quae labra? Quis illi Vul tus erat?
