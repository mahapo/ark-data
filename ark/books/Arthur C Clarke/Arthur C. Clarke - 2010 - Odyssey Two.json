The great saucer set among the mountains was alreadyhalf full of shadow, as the tropical sun dropped swiftly to rest, but thetriangular raft of the antenna complex suspended high above its centre stillblazed with light. From the ground far below, it would have taken keen eyes tonotice the two human figures in the aerial maze of girders, support cables, andwave-guides.‘The time has come,’ said Dr Dimitri Moisevitch to his old friend Heywood Floyd,‘to talk of many things. Of shoes and spaceships and sealing wax, but mostly ofmonoliths and malfunctioning computers.’‘So that’s why you got me away from the conference. Not that I really mind -I’ve heard Carl give that SETI speech so many times that I can recite it myself.And the view certainly is fantastic - you know, all the times I’ve been toArecibo, I’ve never made it up here to the antenna feed.’‘Shame on you. I’ve been here three times. Imagine - we’re listening to thewhole universe - but no one can overhear us. So let’s talk about your problem.’‘What problem?’‘To start with, why you had to resign as Chairman of the National Council onAstronautics.’‘I didn’t resign. The University of Hawaii pays a lot better.’‘Okay - you didn’t resign - you were one jump ahead of them. After all theseyears, Woody, you can’t fool me, and you should give up trying. If they offeredthe NCA back to you right now, would you hesitate?’‘All right, you old Cossak. What do you want to know?’‘First of all, there are lots of loose ends in the report you finally issuedafter so much prodding. We’ll overlook the ridiculous and frankly illegalsecrecy with which your people dug up the Tycho monolith -’‘That wasn’t my idea.’‘Glad to hear it: I even believe you. And we appreciate the fact that you’re nowletting everyone examine the thing - which of course is what you should havedone in the first place. Not that it’s done much good…’There was a gloomy silence while the two men contemplated the black enigma upthere on the Moon, still contemptuously defying all the weapons that humaningenuity could bring to bear upon it. Then the Russian scientist continued.‘Anyway, whatever the Tycho monolith may be, there’s something more importantout at Jupiter. That’s where it sent its signal, after all. And that’s whereyour people ran into trouble. Sorry about that, by the way - though Frank Poolewas the only one I knew personally. Met him at the ‘98 IAF Congress - he seemeda good man.’‘Thank you; they were all good men. I wish we knew what happened to them.’‘Whatever it was, surely you’ll admit that it now concerns the whole human race- not merely the United States. You can no longer try to use your knowledge forpurely national advantage.’‘Dimitri - you know perfectly well that your side would have done exactly thesame thing. And you’d have helped.’‘You’re absolutely right. But that’s ancient history - like the just-departedadministration of yours that was responsible for the whole mess. With a newPresident, perhaps wiser counsels will prevail.’‘Possibly. Do you have any suggestions, and are they official or just personalhopes?’‘Entirely unofficial at the moment. What the bloody politicians call exploratorytalks. Which I shall flatly deny ever occurred.’‘Fair enough. Go on.’‘Okay - here’s the situation. You’re assembling Discovery 2 in parking orbit asquickly as you can, but you can’t hope to have it ready in less than threeyears, which means you’ll miss the next launch window -,‘I neither confirm nor deny. Remember I’m merely a humble university chancellor,the other side of the world from the Astronautics Council.’‘And your last trip to Washington was just a holiday to see old friends, Isuppose. To continue: our own Alexei Leonov -,‘I thought you were calling it Gherman Titov.’‘Wrong, Chancellor. The dear old CIA’s let you down again. Leonov it is, as oflast January. And don’t let anyone know I told you it will reach Jupiter atleast a year ahead of Discovery.’‘Don’t let anyone know I told you we were afraid of that. But do go on.’‘Because my bosses are just as stupid and shortsighted as yours, they want to goit alone. Which means that whatever went wrong with you may happen to us, andwe’ll all be back to square one - or worse.’‘What do you think went wrong? We’re just as baffled as you are. And don’t tellme you haven’t got all of Dave Bowman’s transmissions.’‘Of course we have. Right up to that last “My God, it’s full of stars!” We’veeven done a stress analysis on his voice patterns. We don’t think he washallucinating; he was trying to describe what he actually saw.’‘And what do you make of his doppler shift?’‘Completely impossible, of course. When we lost his signal, he was receding at atenth of the speed of light. And he’d reached that in less than two minutes. Aquarter of a million gravities!’‘So he must have been killed instantly.’‘Don’t pretend to be naive, Woody. Your space-pod radios aren’t built towithstand even a hundredth of that acceleration. If they could survive, so couldBowman - at least, until we lost contact.’‘Just doing an independent check on your deductions. From there on, we’re asmuch in the dark as you are. If you are.’‘Merely playing with lots of crazy guesses I’d be ashamed to tell you. Yet noneof them, I suspect, will be half as crazy as the truth.’In small crimson explosions the navigation warning lights winked on all aroundthem, and the three slim towers supporting the antenna complex began to blazelike beacons against the darkling sky. The last red sliver of the sun vanishedbelow the surrounding hills; Heywood Floyd waited for the Green Flash, which hehad never seen. Once again, he was disappointed.‘So, Dimitri,’ he said, ‘let’s get to the point. Just what are you driving at?’‘There must be a vast amount of priceless information stored in Discovery’s databanks; presumably it’s still being gathered, even though the ship’s stoppedtransmitting. We’d like to have that.’‘Fair enough. But when you get out there, and Leonov makes a rendezvous, what’sto prevent you from boarding Discovery and copying everything you want?’‘I never thought I’d have to remind you that Discovery is United Statesterritory, and an unauthorized entry would be piracy.’‘Except in the event of a life-or-death emergency, which wouldn’t be difficultto arrange. After all, it would be hard for us to check what your boys were upto, from a billion kilometres away.’‘Thanks for the most interesting suggestion; I’ll pass it on. But even if wewent aboard, it would take us weeks to learn all your systems, and read out allyour memory banks. What I propose is cooperation. I’m convinced that’s the bestidea - but we may both have a job selling it to our respective bosses.’‘You want one of our astronauts to fly with Leonov?’‘Yes - preferably an engineer who’s specialized in Discovery’s systems. Like theones you’re training at Houston to bring the ship home.’‘How did you know that?’‘For heaven’s sake, Woody - it was on Aviation Week’s videotext at least a monthago.’‘I am out of touch; nobody tells me what’s been declassified.’‘All the more reason to spend time in Washington. Will you back me up?’‘Absolutely. I agree with you one hundred per cent. But -’‘But what?’‘We both have to deal with dinosaurs with brains in their tails. Some of minewill argue: Let the Russians risk their necks, hurrying out to Jupiter. We’ll bethere anyway a couple of years later - and what’s the hurry?’For a moment there was silence on the antenna raft, except for a faint creakfrom the immense supporting cables that held it suspended a hundred metres inthe sky. Then Moisevitch continued, so quietly that Floyd had to strain to hearhim: ‘Has anyone checked Discovery’s orbit lately?’‘I really don’t know - but I suppose so. Anyway, why bother? It’s a perfectlystable one.’‘Indeed. Let me tactlessly remind you of an embarrassing incident from the oldNASA days. Your first space station - Skylab. It was supposed to stay up atleast a decade, but you didn’t do your calculations right. The air drag in theionosphere was badly underestimated, and it came down years ahead of schedule.I’m sure you remember that little cliffhanger, even though you were a boy at thetime.’‘It was the year I graduated, and you know it. But Discovery doesn’t go anywherenear Jupiter. Even at perigee - er, perijove - it’s much too high to be affectedby atmospheric drag.’‘I’ve already said enough to get me exiled to my dacha again - and you might notbe allowed to visit me next time. So just ask your tracking people to do theirjob more carefully, will you? And remind them that Jupiter has the biggestmagnetosphere in the Solar System.’‘I understand what you’re driving at - many thanks. Anything else before we godown? I’m starting to freeze.’‘Don’t worry, old friend. As soon as you let all this filter through toWashington - wait a week or so until I’m clear -things are going to get very,very hot.’"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWO2"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWOTHE HOUSE OF THE DOLPHINSThe dolphins swam into the dining room every evening, just before sunset. Onlyonce since Floyd had occupied the Chancellor’s residence had they broken theirroutine. That was the day of the ‘05 tsunami, which, fortunately, had lost mostof its power before it reached Hilo. The next time his friends failed to turn upon schedule, Floyd would throw the family into the car and head for high ground,in the general direction of Mauna Kea.Charming though they were, he had to admit that their playfulness was sometimesa nuisance. The wealthy marine geologist who had designed the house had neverminded getting wet because he usually wore bathing trunks - or less. But therehad been one unforgettable occasion when the entire Board of Regents, in fullevening attire, had been sipping cocktails around the pool while awaiting thearrival of a distinguished guest from the mainland. The dolphins had deduced,correctly, that they would get second billing. So the visitor was quitesurprised to be greeted by a bedraggled committee in ill-fitting bathrobes - andthe buffet had been very salty.Floyd often wondered what Marion would have thought of his strange and beautifulhome on the edge of the Pacific. She had never liked the sea, but the sea hadwon in the end. Though the image was slowly fading, he could still recall theflashing screen on which he had first read the words: DR FLOYD - URGENT ANDPERSONAL. And then the scrolling lines of fluorescent print that had swiftlyburned their message into his mind:REGRET TO INFORM YOU LONDON-WASHINGTON FLIGHT 452 REPORTED DOWN OFFNEWFOUNDLAND. RESCUE CRAFT PROCEEDING TO LOCATION BUT FEAR NO SURVIVORS.Apart from an accident of fate, he would have been on that flight. For a fewdays, he had almost regretted the European Space Administration business thathad delayed him in Paris; that haggle over the Solaris payload had saved hislife.And now, he had a new job, a new home and a new wife. Fate had also played anironic role here. The recriminations and inquiries over the Jupiter mission haddestroyed his Washington career, but a man of his ability was never unemployedfor long. The more leisurely tempo of university life had always appealed tohim, and when combined with one of the world’s most beautiful locations it hadproved irresistible. He had met the woman who was to be his second wife only amonth after he had been appointed, while watching the fire fountains of Kilaueawith a crowd of tourists.With Caroline he had found the contentment that is just as important ashappiness, and longer lasting. She had been a good stepmother to Marion’s twodaughters, and had given him Christopher. Despite the twenty-year age differencebetween them, she understood his moods and could wean him out of his occasionaldepressions. Thanks to her, he could now contemplate the memory of Marionwithout grief, though not without a wistful sadness that would remain with himfor the rest of his life.Caroline was throwing fish to the largest dolphin - the big male they calledScarback - when a gentle tickling on Floyd’s wrist announced an incoming call.He tapped the slim metal band to quench the silent alarm and forestall theaudible one, then walked to the nearest of the comsets scattered around theroom.‘Chancellor here. Who’s calling?’‘Heywood? This is Victor. How are you?’In a fraction of a second, a whole kaleidoscope of emotions flashed throughFloyd’s mind. First there was annoyance: his successor - and, he was sure,principal contriver of his downfall - had never once attempted to contact himsince his departure from Washington. Then came curiosity: what did they have totalk about? Next was a stubborn determination to be as unhelpful as possible,then shame at his own childishness, and, finally, a surge of excitement. VictorMillson could be calling for only one reason.In as neutral a voice as he could muster, Floyd answered:‘I can’t complain, Victor. What’s the problem?’‘Is this a secure circuit?’‘No, thank God. I don’t need them any more.’‘Um. Well, I’ll put it this way. You recall the last project you administered?’‘I’m not likely to forget, especially as the Subcommittee on Astronautics calledme back to give more evidence only a month ago.’‘Of course, of course. I really must get around to reading your statement, whenI have a moment. But I’ve been so busy with the follow-up, and that’s theproblem.’‘I thought that everything was right on schedule.’‘It is - unfortunately. There’s nothing we can do to advance it; even thehighest priority would make only a few weeks’ difference. And that means we’llbe too late.’‘I don’t understand,’ said Floyd innocently. ‘Though we don’t want to wastetime, of course, there’s no real deadline.’‘Now there is - and two of them.’‘You amaze me.’If Victor noticed any irony, he ignored it. ‘Yes, there are two deadlines - oneman-made, one not. It now turns out that we won’t be the first to get back tothe - er, scene of the action. Our old rivals will beat us by at least a year.’‘Too bad.’‘That’s not the worst. Even if there were no competition, we’d be too late.There wouldn’t be anything there when we arrive.’‘That’s ridiculous. I’m sure I’d have heard if Congress had repealed the law ofgravitation.’‘I’m serious. The situation isn’t stable - I can’t give details now. Will you bein for the rest of the evening?’‘Yes,’ Floyd answered, realizing with some pleasure that it must now be wellafter midnight in Washington.‘Good. You’ll have a package delivered within the hour. Call me back as soon asyou’ve had the time to study it.’‘Won’t it be rather late by then?’‘Yes, it will be. But we’ve wasted too much time already. I don’t want to loseany more.’Millson was true to his word. Exactly an hour later a large sealed envelope wasdelivered by an Air Force colonel, no less, who sat patiently chatting withCaroline while Floyd read its contents. ‘I’m afraid I’ll have to take it awaywhen you’ve finished,’ the high-ranking messenger boy said apologetically.‘I’m glad to hear it,’ Floyd answered, as he settled down in his favouritereading hammock.There were two documents, the first very short. It was stamped TOP SECRET,though the TOP had been crossed out and the modification endorsed by threesignatures, all completely illegible. Obviously an extract from some much longerreport, it had been heavily censored and was full of blanks, which made it mostannoying to read. Fortunately, its conclusions could be summed up in onesentence: The Russians would reach Discovery long before its rightful ownerscould do so. As Floyd already knew this, he turned quickly to the seconddocument - though not before noticing with satisfaction that this time they’dmanaged to get the name right. As usual, Dimitri had been perfectly accurate.The next manned expedition to Jupiter would travel aboard spacecraft CosmonautAlexei Leonov.The second document was much longer and was merely confidential; indeed, it wasin the form of a draft letter to Science, awaiting final approval beforepublication. Its snappy title was ‘Space Vehicle Discovery: Anomalous OrbitalBehavior’.Then followed a dozen pages of mathematics and astronomical tables. Floydskimmed through these, picking out the words from the music, and trying todetect any note of apology or even embarrassment. When he had finished, he wascompelled to give a smile of wry admiration. No one could possibly guess thatthe tracking stations and ephemeris calculators had been caught by surprise, andthat a frantic cover-up was in progress. Heads would doubtless roll, and he knewthat Victor Millson would enjoy rolling them - if his was not one of the firstto go. Though to do him justice, Victor had complained when Congress had cutfunds for the tracking network. Maybe that would get him off the hook.‘Thank you, Colonel,’ said Floyd when he had finished skimming the papers.‘Quite like old times, having classified documents. That’s one thing I don’tmiss.’The colonel placed the envelope carefully back in his briefcase, and activatedthe locks.‘Dr Millson would like you to return his call as soon as possible.’‘I know. But I don’t have a secure circuit, I’ve some important visitors comingshortly, and I’m damned if I’m driving down to your office in Hilo just to sayI’ve read two documents. Tell him that I’ve studied them carefully and await anyfurther communication with interest.’For a moment it looked as if the colonel was going to argue. Then he thoughtbetter of it, made a stiff farewell, and departed morosely into the night.‘Now, what was all that about?’ asked Caroline. ‘We’re not expecting anyvisitors tonight, important or otherwise.’‘I hate being pushed around, particularly by Victor Millson.’‘Bet he calls you back as soon as the colonel reports.’‘Then we must switch off video and make some party noises. But to be perfectlytruthful, at this stage I really don’t have anything to say.’‘About what, if I’m allowed to ask.’‘Sorry, dear. It seems that Discovery is playing tricks on us. We thought theship was in a stable orbit, but it may be about to crash.’‘Into Jupiter?’‘Oh no - that’s quite impossible. Bowman left it parked at the inner Lagrangepoint, on the line between Jupiter and Io. It should have stayed there, more orless, though the perturbations of the outer moons would have made it wander backand forth.‘But what’s happening now is something very odd, and we don’t know the fullexplanation. Discovery’s drifting more and more rapidly toward Io - thoughsometimes it accelerates, and sometimes even moves backward. If it keeps thisup, it will impact within two or three years.’‘I thought this couldn’t happen in astronomy. Isn’t celestial mechanics supposedto be an exact science? So we poor backward biologists were always being told.’‘It is an exact science, when everything is taken into account. But some verystrange things go on around Io. Apart from its volcanoes, there are tremendouselectrical discharges - and Jupiter’s magnetic field is spinning round every tenhours. So gravitation isn’t the only force acting on Discovery; we should havethought of this sooner - much sooner.’‘Well, it’s not your problem anymore. You should be thankful for that.’‘Your problem’ - the very expression that Dimitri had used. And Dimitri -cunning old fox! - had known him much longer than Caroline.It might not be his problem, but it was still his responsibility. Though manyothers had been involved, in the final analysis he had approved the plans forthe Jupiter Mission, and supervised their execution.Even at the time, he had had qualms; his views as a scientist had conflictedwith his duties as a bureaucrat. He could have spoken out, and opposed the oldadministration’s shortsighted policies - though to what extent those hadactually contributed to the disaster was still uncertain.Perhaps it was best if he closed this chapter of his life, and focused all histhoughts and energies upon his new career. But in his heart he knew that wasimpossible; even if Dimitri had not revived old guilts, they would have surfacedof their own accord.Four men had died, and one had disappeared, out there among the moons ofJupiter. There was blood on his hands, and he did not know how to wash themclean."},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWO3"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWOSAL 9000Dr Sivasubramanian Chandrasegarampillai, Professor of Computer Science at theUniversity of Illinois, Urbana, also had an abiding sense of guilt, but one verydifferent from Heywood Floyd’s. Those of his students and colleagues who oftenwondered if the little scientist was quite human would not have been surprisedto learn that he never thought of the dead astronauts. Dr Chandra grieved onlyfor his lost child, HAL 9000.Even after all these years, and his endless reviews of the data radioed backfrom Discovery, he was not sure what had gone wrong. He could only formulatetheories; the facts he needed were frozen in Hal’s circuits, out there betweenJupiter and Io.The sequence of events had been clearly established, up to the moment of thetragedy; thereafter, Commander Bowman had filled in a few more details on thebrief occasions when he had re-established contact. But knowing what happeneddid not explain why.The first hint of trouble had been late in the mission, when Hal had reportedthe imminent failure of the unit that kept Discovery’s main antenna aligned toEarth. If the half-billion-kilometre-long radio beam wandered off target, theship would be blind, deaf, and dumb.Bowman himself had gone out to retrieve the suspect unit, but when it was testedit appeared, to everyone’s surprise, to be in perfectly good order. Theautomatic checking circuits could find nothing wrong with it. Nor could Hal’stwin, SAL 9000, back on Earth, when the information was transmitted to Urbana.But Hal had insisted on the accuracy of his diagnosis, making pointed remarksabout ‘human error’. He had suggested that the control unit be put back in theantenna until it finally failed, so that the fault could be precisely located.No one could think of any objection, for the unit could be replaced in minutes,even if it did break down.Bowman and Poole, however, had not been happy; they both felt that something waswrong, though neither could pinpoint it. For months they had accepted Hal as thethird member of their tiny world, and knew his every mood. Then the atmosphereaboard the ship had subtly altered; there was a sense of strain in the air.Feeling rather like traitors - as a distraught Bowman had later reported toMission Control - the human two-thirds of the crew had discussed what should bedone if their colleague was indeed malfunctioning. In the worst possible case,Hal would have to be relieved of all his higher responsibilities. This wouldinvolve disconnection - the computer equivalent of death.Despite their doubts, they had carried out the agreed programme. Poole had flownout of Discovery in one of the little space pods that served as transporters andmobile workshops during extravehicular activities. Since the somewhat tricky jobof replacing the antenna unit could not be performed by the pod’s ownmanipulators, Poole had started to do it himself.What happened then had been missed by the external cameras, which was asuspicious detail in itself. Bowman’s first warning of disaster was a cry fromPoole - then, silence. A moment later he saw Poole, tumbling over and over,spinning away into space. His own pod had rammed him, and was itself blastingaway out of control.As Bowman admitted later, he had then made several serious mistakes - all butone excusable. In the hope of rescuing Poole, if he was still alive, Bowmanlaunched himself in another space pod - leaving Hal in full control of the ship.The EVA was in vain; Poole was dead when Bowman reached him. Numb with despair,he had carried the body back to the ship - only to be refused entry by Hal.But Hal had underestimated human ingenuity and determination. Though he had lefthis suit helmet in the ship, and thus had to risk direct exposure to space,Bowman forced his way in by an emergency hatch not under computer control. Thenhe proceeded to lobotomize Hal, unplugging his brain modules one by one.When he regained control of the ship, Bowman made an appalling discovery. Duringhis absence, Hal had switched off the life-support systems of the threehibernating astronauts. Bowman was alone, as no man had ever been before in thewhole of human history.Others might have abandoned themselves in helpless despair, but now David Bowmanproved that those who had selected him had indeed chosen well. He managed tokeep Discovery operational, and even re-established intermittent contact withMission Control, by orienting the whole ship so that the jammed antenna pointedtoward Earth.On its preordained trajectory, Discovery had finally arrived at Jupiter. ThereBowman had encountered, orbiting among the moons of the giant planet, a blackslab of exactly the same shape as the monolith excavated in the lunar craterTycho - but hundreds of times larger. He had gone out in a space pod toinvestigate, and had disappeared leaving that final, baffling message: ‘My God,it’s full of stars!’That mystery was for others to worry about; Dr Chandra’s overwhelming concernwas with Hal. If there was one thing his unemotional mind hated, it wasuncertainty. He would never be satisfied until he knew the cause of Hal’sbehaviour. Even now, he refused to call it a malfunction; at most, it was an‘anomaly’.The tiny cubbyhole he used as his inner sanctum was equipped only with a swivelchair, a desk console, and a blackboard flanked by two photographs. Few membersof the general public could have identified the portraits, but anyone permittedthus far would have recognized them instantly as John von Neumann and AlanTuring, the twin gods of the computing pantheon.There were no books, and not even paper and pencil on the desk. All the volumesin all the libraries of the world were instantly available at the touch ofChandra’s fingers, and the visual display was his sketchbook and writing pad.Even the blackboard was used only for visitors; the last half - erased blockdiagram upon it bore a date already three weeks in the past.Dr Chandra lit one of the venomous cheroots which he imported from Madras, andwhich were widely - and correctly - believed to be his only vice. The consolewas never switched off he checked that no messages were flashing importantly onthe display, then spoke into the microphone.‘Good morning, Sal. So you’ve nothing new for me?’‘No, Dr Chandra. Have you anything for me?’The voice might have been that of any cultured Hindu lady educated in the UnitedStates as well as her own country. Sal’s accent had not started that way, butover the years she had picked up many of Chandra’s intonations.The scientist tapped out a code on the board, switching Sal’s inputs to thememory with the highest security rating. No one knew that he talked to thecomputer on this circuit as he never could to a human being. No matter that Saldid not really understand more than a fraction of what he said; her responseswere so convincing that even her creator was sometimes deceived. As indeed hewished to be: these secret communications helped to preserve his mentalequilibrium - perhaps even his sanity.‘You’ve often told me, Sal, that we cannot solve the problem of Hal’s anomalousbehaviour without more information. But how can we get that information?’‘That is obvious. Someone must return to Discovery.’‘Exactly. Now it looks as if that is going to happen, sooner than we expected.’‘I am pleased to hear that.’‘I knew that you would be,’ answered Chandra, and meant it. He had long sincebroken off communications with the dwindling body of philosophers who arguedthat computers could not really feel emotions, but only pretended to do so.(’If you can prove to me that you’re not pretending to be annoyed,’ he had onceretorted scornfully to one such critic, ‘I’ll take you seriously.’ At thatpoint, his opponent had put on a most convincing imitation of anger.)‘Now I want to explore another possibility,’ Chandra continued. ‘Diagnosis isonly the first step. The process is incomplete unless it leads to a cure.’‘You believe that Hal can be restored to normal functioning?’‘I hope so. I do not know. There may have been irreversible damage, andcertainly major loss of memory.’He paused thoughtfully, took several puffs, then blew a skilful smoke ring thatscored a bull’s-eye on Sal’s wideangle lens. A human being would not haveregarded this as a friendly gesture; that was yet another of the many advantagesof computers.‘I need your cooperation, Sal.’‘Of course, Dr Chandra.’‘There may be certain risks.’‘What do you mean?’‘I propose to disconnect some of your circuits, particularly those involvingyour higher functions. Does this disturb you?’‘I am unable to answer that without more specific information.’‘Very well. Let me put it this way. You have operated continuously, have younot, since you were first switched on?’‘That is correct.’‘But you are aware that we human beings cannot do so. We require sleep - analmost complete break in our mental functioning, at least on the consciouslevel.’‘I know this. But I do not understand it.’‘Well, you may be about to experience something like sleep. Probably all thatwill happen is that time will pass, but you will be unaware out. When you checkyour internal clock, you will discover that there are gaps in your monitorrecord. That is all.’‘But you said that there might be risks. What are they?’‘There is a very slight chance - it is impossible to compute it - that when Ireconnect your circuits, there may be some changes in your personality, yourfuture behaviour patterns. You may feel different. Not necessarily better, orworse.’‘I do not know what that means.’‘I’m sorry - it may not mean anything. So don’t worry about it. Now please opena new file - here is the name.’ Using the keyboard input, Chandra typed out:PHOENIX.‘Do you know what that is?’ he asked Sal.With no discernible pause the computer replied: ‘There are twenty-fivereferences in the current encyclopedia.’‘Which one do you think is relevant?’‘The tutor of Achilles?’‘Interesting. I didn’t know that one. Try again.’‘A fabulous bird, reborn from the ashes of its earlier life.’‘Excellent. Now do you understand why I chose it?’‘Because you hope that Hal can be reactivated.’‘Yes - with your assistance. Are you ready?’‘Not yet. I would like to ask a question.’‘What is it?’‘Will I dream?’‘Of course you will. All intelligent creatures dream - but no one knows why.’Chandra paused for a moment, blew another smoke ring from the cheroot, and addedsomething that he would never admit to a human being. ‘Perhaps you will dreamabout Hal - as I often do.’"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWO4"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWOMISSION PROFILEEnglish VersionTo: Captain Tatiana (Tanya) Orlova, Commander.

To proceed to the Jovian system and rendezvous with US Spacecraft Discovery(UNCOS 01/283).2. To board this spacecraft, and obtain all possible information relating to itsearlier mission.3. To reactivate Spacecraft Discovery’s onboard systems and, if propellantsupplies are adequate, inject the ship into an Earth-returns trajectory.4 To locate the alien artifact encountered by Discovery, and to investigate itto the maximum extent possible by remote sensors.5. If it seems advisable, and Mission Control concurs, to rendezvous with thisobject for closer inspection.6. To carry out a survey of Jupiter and its satellites, as far as this iscompatible with the above objectives.It is realized that unforeseen circumstances may require a change of priorities,or even make it impossible to achieve some of these objectives. It must beclearly understood that the rendezvous with Spacecraft Discovery is for theexpress purpose of obtaining information about the artifact; this must takeprecedence over all other objectives, including attempts at salvage.CrewThe crew of Spacecraft Alexei Leonov will consist of:Captain Tatiana Orlova (Engineering-Propulsion)Dr Vasili Orlov (Navigation-Astronomy)Dr Maxim Brailovsky (Engineering-Structures)Dr Alexander Kovalev (Engineering-Communications)Dr Nikolai Ternovsky (Engineering-Control Systems)Surgeon-Commander Katerina Rudenko (Medical-Life-Support)Dr Irma Yakunina (Medical-Nutrition)In addition, the US National Council on Astronautics will provide the followingthree experts:Dr Heywood Floyd dropped the memorandum, and leaned back in his chair. It wasall settled; the point of no return had been passed. Even if he wished to do so,there was no way to put back the clock.He glanced across at Caroline, sitting with two-year-old Chris on the edge ofthe pool. The boy was more at home in the water than on land, and could staysubmerged for periods that often terrified visitors. And though he could not yetspeak much Human, he already seemed fluent in Dolphin.One of Christopher’s friends had just swum in from the Pacific and waspresenting his back to be patted. You too are a wanderer, thought Floyd, in avast and trackless ocean; but how small your tiny Pacific seems, against theimmensity I am facing now!Caroline became aware of his gaze, and rose to her feet. She looked at himsombrely, but without anger; all that had been burned out in the last few days.As she approached, she even managed a wistful smile.‘I’ve found that poem I was looking for,’ she said. ‘It starts like this:What is a woman that you forsake her,And the hearth-fire and the home acre,To go with the old grey Widow-maker?’‘Sorry - I don’t quite understand. Who is the Widow-maker?’‘Not who, what. The sea. The poem’s a lament by a Viking woman. It was writtenby Rudyard Kipling, a hundred years ago.’Floyd took his wife’s hand; she did not respond, but neither did she resist.‘Well, I don’t feel at all like a Viking. I’m not after loot, and adventure isthe very last thing I want.’‘Then why - no, I don’t intend to start another fight. But it would help usboth, if you know exactly what your motives are.’‘I wish I could give you one single good reason. Instead, I’ve a whole host oflittle ones. But they add up to a final answer I can’t argue with - believe me.’‘I believe you. But are you sure you’re not fooling yourself?’‘If I am, then so are a lot of other people. Including, may I remind you, thePresident of the United States.’‘I’m not likely to forget. But suppose - just suppose - that he hadn’t askedyou. Would you have volunteered?’‘I can answer that truthfully: No. It would never have occurred to me. PresidentMordecai’s call was the biggest shock of my life. But when I thought it over, Irealized he was perfectly right. You know I don’t go in for false modesty. I amthe best-qualified man for the job - when the space docs give their final okay.And you should know that I’m still in pretty good shape.’That brought the smile he had intended.‘Sometimes I wonder if you’d suggested it yourself.’The thought had indeed occurred to him; but he could answer honestly.‘I would never have done so without consulting you.’‘I’m glad you didn’t. I don’t know what I’d have said.’‘I could still turn it down.’‘Now you’re talking nonsense, and you know it. Even if you did, you’d hate mefor the rest of your life - and you’d never forgive yourself. You have toostrong a sense of duty. Maybe that’s one of the reasons I married you.’Duty! Yes, that was the key word, and what multitudes it contained. He had aduty to himself, to his family, to the University, to his past job (even thoughhe had left it under a cloud), to his country - and to the human race. It wasnot easy to establish the priorities; and sometimes they conflicted with oneanother.There were perfectly logical reasons why he should go on the mission - andequally logical reasons, as many of his colleagues had already pointed out, whyhe should not. But perhaps in the final analysis, the choice had been made byhis heart, not his brain. And even here, emotion urged him in two oppositedirections.Curiosity, guilt, the determination to finish a job that had been badly botched- they all combined to drive him toward Jupiter and whatever might be waitingthere. On the other hand, fear - he was honest enough to admit that - unitedwith love of his family to keep him on Earth. Yet he had never had any realdoubts; he had made his decision almost instantly, and had deflected all ofCaroline’s arguments as gently as he could.And there was one other consoling thought that he had not yet risked sharingwith his wife. Though he would be gone two and a half years, all but the fiftydays at Jupiter would be spent in timeless hibernation. When he returned, thegap between their ages would have narrowed by more than two years.He would have sacrificed the present so that they could share a longer futuretogether."},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWO5"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWOLEONOVThe months contracted to weeks, the weeks dwindled to days, the days shrivelledto hours; and suddenly Heywood Floyd was once more at the Cape - spaceward-boundfor the first time since that trip to Clavius Base and the Tycho monolith, somany years ago.But this time he was not alone, and there was no secrecy about the mission. Afew seats ahead of him rode Dr Chandra, already engaged in a dialogue with hisbriefcase computer, and quite oblivious to his surroundings.One of Floyd’s secret amusements, which he had never confided to anyone, wasspotting similarities between human beings and animals. The resemblances weremore often flattering than insulting, and his little hobby was also a veryuseful aid to memory.Dr Chandra was easy - the adjective birdlike sprang instantly to mind. He wastiny, delicate, and all his movements were swift and precise. But which bird?Obviously a very intelligent one. Magpie? Too perky and acquisitive. Owl? No -too slow-moving. Perhaps sparrow would do nicely.Walter Curnow, the systems specialist who would have the formidable job ofgetting Discovery operational again, was a more difficult matter. He was alarge, husky man, certainly not at all birdlike. One could usually find a matchsomewhere in the vast spectrum of dogs, but no canine seemed to fit. Of course -Curnow was a bear. Not the sulky, dangerous kind, but the friendly good-naturedtype. And perhaps this was appropriate; it reminded Floyd of the Russiancolleagues he would soon be joining. They had been up in orbit for days, engagedin their final checks.This is the great moment of my life, Floyd told himself. Now I am leaving on amission that may determine the future of the human race. But he did not feel anysense of exultation; all he could think of, during the last minutes of thecountdown, were the words he had whispered just before he had left home:‘Goodbye, my dear little son; will you remember me when I return?’ And he stillfelt resentment toward Caroline because she would not awaken the sleeping childfor one final embrace; yet he knew that she had been wise, and it was betterthat way.His mood was shattered by a sudden explosive laugh; Dr Curnow was sharing a jokewith his companions - as well as a large bottle that he handled as delicately asa barely subcritical mass of plutonium.‘Hey, Heywood,’ he called, ‘they tell me Captain Orlova’s locked up all thedrinks, so this is your last chance. Château Thierry ‘95. Sorry about theplastic cups.’As Floyd sipped at the really superb champagne, he found himself cringingmentally at the thought of Curnow’s guffaw reverberating all the way across theSolar System. Much as he admired the engineer’s, ability, as a travellingcompanion Curnow might prove something of a strain. At least Dr Chandra wouldnot present such problems; Floyd could hardly imagine him smiling, let alonelaughing. And, of course, he turned down the champagne with a barely perceptibleshudder. Curnow was polite enough, or glad enough, not to insist.The engineer was, it seemed, determined to be the life and soul of the party. Afew minutes later he produced a two-octave electronic keyboard, and gave rapidrenderings of ‘D’ye ken John Peel’ as performed successively by piano, trombone,violin, flute, and full organ, with vocal accompaniment. He was really verygood, and Floyd soon found himself singing along with the others. But it wasjust as well, he thought, that Curnow would spend most of the voyage in silenthibernation.The music died with a sudden despairing discord as the engines ignited and theshuttle launched itself into the sky. Floyd was gripped by a familiar but alwaysnew exhilaration - the sense of boundless power, carrying him up and away fromthe cares and duties of Earth. Men knew better than they realized, when theyplaced the abode of the gods beyond the reach of gravity. He was flying towardthat realm of weightlessness; for the moment, he would ignore the fact that outthere lay not freedom, but the greatest responsibility of his career.As the thrust increased, he felt the weight of worlds upon his shoulders - buthe welcomed it, like an Atlas who had not yet tired of his burden. He did notattempt to think, but was content to savour the experience. Even if he wasleaving Earth for the last time, and saying farewell to all that he had everloved, he felt no sadness. The roar that surrounded him was a paean of triumph,sweeping away all minor emotions.He was almost sorry when it ceased, though he welcomed the easier breathing andthe sudden sense of freedom. Most of the other passengers started to unbuckletheir safety straps, preparing to enjoy the thirty minutes of zero gravityduring the transfer orbit, but a few who were obviously making the trip for thefirst time remained in their seats, looking around anxiously for the cabinattendants.‘Captain speaking. We’re now at an altitude of three hundred kilometres, comingup over the west coast of Africa. You won’t see much as it’s night down there -that glow ahead is Sierra Leone - and there’s a big tropical storm over the Gulfof Guinea. Look at those flashes!‘We’ll have sunrise in fifteen minutes. Meanwhile I’m rolling the ship so youcan get a good view of the equatorial satellite belt. The brightest one - almoststraight overhead - is Intelsat’s Atlantic-1 Antenna Farm. Then Intercosmos 2 tothe west - that fainter star is Jupiter. And if you look just below that, you’llsee a flashing light, moving against the star background - that’s the newChinese space-station. We pass within a hundred kilometres, not close enough tosee anything with the naked eye -,What were they up to? Floyd thought idly. He had examined the close-ups of thesquat cylindrical structure with its curious bulges, and saw no reason tobelieve the alarmist rumours that it was a laser-equipped fortress. But whilethe Beijing Academy of Science ignored the UN Space Committee’s repeatedrequests for a tour of inspection, the Chinese only had themselves to blame forsuch hostile propaganda.The “Cosmonaut Alexei Leonov” was not a thing of beauty; but few spacecraft everwere. One day, perhaps, the human race would develop a new aesthetic;generations of artists might arise whose ideals were not based upon the naturalforms of Earth moulded by wind and water. Space itself was a realm of oftenoverpowering beauty; unfortunately, Man’s hardware did not yet live up to it.Apart from the four huge propellant tanks, which would be dropped off as soon asthe transfer orbit was achieved, Leonov was surprisingly small. From heat shieldto drive units was less than fifty metres; it was hard to believe that so modesta vehicle, smaller than many commercial aircraft, could carry ten men and womenhalfway across the Solar System.But zero gravity, which made walls and roof and floor interchangeable, rewroteall the rules of living. There was plenty of room aboard Leonov even wheneveryone was awake at the same time, as was certainly the case at the moment.Indeed, her normal complement was at least doubled by assorted newsmen,engineers making final adjustments, and anxious officials.As soon as the shuttle had docked, Floyd tried to find the cabin he would share- a year hence, when he awoke - with Curnow and Chandra. When he did locate it,he discovered that it was packed so tightly with neatly labelled boxes ofequipment and provisions that entry was almost impossible. He was wonderingglumly how to get a foot in the door when one of the crew, launching himselfskilfully from handhold to handhold, noticed Floyd’s dilemma and braked to ahalt.‘Dr Floyd - welcome aboard. I’m Max Brailovsky - assistant engineer.’The young Russian spoke the slow, careful English of a student who had had morelessons with an electronic tutor than a human teacher. As they shook hands,Floyd matched the face and name to the set of crew biographies he had alreadystudied: Maxim Andreievitch Brailovsky, age thirty-one, born Leningrad,specializing in structure; hobbies: fencing, skycycling, chess.‘Glad to meet you,’ said Floyd. ‘But how do I get inside?’‘Not to worry,’ said Max cheerfully. ‘All that will be gone when you wake up.It’s - what do you say? - expendables. We’ll eat your room empty by the time youneed it. I promise.’ He patted his stomach.‘Fine - but meanwhile where do I put my things?’ Floyd pointed to the threesmall cases, total mass fifty kilograms, which contained - he hoped - everythinghe needed for the next couple of billion kilometres. It had been no easy task,shepherding their weightless, but not inertialess, bulk through the ship’scorridors with only a few collisions.Max took two of the bags, glided gently through the triangle formed by threeintersecting girders, and dived into a small hatchway, apparently defyingNewton’s First Law in the process. Floyd acquired a few extra bruises whilefollowing him; after a considerable time - Leonov seemed much bigger inside thanout- they arrived at a door labelled CAPTAIN, in both Cyrillic and Roman.Although he could read Russian much better than he could speak it, Floydappreciated the gesture; he had already noticed that all ship’s notices werebilingual.At Max’s knock, a green light flashed on, and Floyd drifted inside as gracefullyas he could. Though he had spoken to Captain Orlova many times, they had neverbefore met. So he had two surprises.It was impossible to judge a person’s real size over the viewphone; the camerasomehow converted everyone to the same scale. Captain Orlova, standing - as wellas one could stand in zero gravity - barely reached to Floyd’s shoulders. Theviewphone had also completely failed to convey the penetrating quality of thosedazzling blue eyes, much the most striking feature of a face that, at themoment, could not be fairly judged for beauty.‘Hello, Tanya,’ said Floyd. ‘How nice to meet at last. But what a pity aboutyour hair.’They grasped both hands, like old friends.‘And nice to have you aboard, Heywood!’ answered the captain. Her English,unlike Brailovsky’s, was quite fluent, though heavily accented. ‘Yes, I wassorry to lose it - but hair’s a nuisance on long missions, and I like to keepthe local barbers away as long as possible. And my apologies about your cabin;as Max will have explained, we suddenly found we needed another ten cubic metresof storage space. Vasili and I won’t be spending much time here for the next fewhours - please feel free to use our quarters.’‘Thank you. What about Curnow and Chandra?’‘I’ve made similar arrangements with the crew. It may seem as if we’re treatingyou like cargo -’‘Not wanted on voyage.’‘Pardon?’‘That’s a label they used to put on the baggage, in the old days of oceantravel.’Tanya smiled. ‘It does look rather that way. But you’ll be wanted all right, atthe end of the trip. We’re already planning your revival party.’‘That sounds too religious. Make it - no, resurrection would be even worse! -waking-up party. But I can see how busy you are - let me dump my things andcontinue my grand tour.’‘Max will show you around - take Dr Floyd to Vasili, will you? He’s down in thedrive unit.’As they drifted out of the captain’s quarters, Floyd gave mental good marks tothe crew-selection committee. Tanya Orlova was impressive enough on paper; inthe flesh she was almost intimidating, despite her charm. I wonder what she’slike, Floyd asked himself, when she loses her temper. Would it be fire or ice?On the whole, I’d prefer not to find out.Floyd was rapidly acquiring his space legs; by the time they reached VasiliOrlov, he was manoeuvring almost as confidently as his guide. The chiefscientist greeted Floyd as warmly as his wife had.‘Welcome aboard, Heywood. How do you feel?’‘Fine, apart from slowly starving to death.’For a moment Orlov looked puzzled; then his face split into a broad smile,‘Oh, I’d forgotten. Well, it won’t be for long. In ten months’ time, you can eatas much as you like.’Hibernators went on a low-residue diet a week in advance; for the lasttwenty-four hours, they took nothing but liquid. Floyd was beginning to wonderhow much of his increasing light-headedness was due to starvation, how much toCurnow’s champagne, and how much to zero gravity.To concentrate his mind, he scanned the multicoloured mass of plumbing thatsurrounded them.‘So this is the famous Sakharov Drive. It’s the first time I’ve seen afull-scale unit.’‘It’s only the fourth one ever built.’‘I hope it works.’‘It had better. Otherwise, the Gorky City Council will be renaming SakharovSquare again.’It was a sign of the times that a Russian could joke, however wryly, about hiscountry’s treatment of its greatest scientist. Floyd was again reminded ofSakharov’s eloquent speech to the Academy, when he was belatedly made Hero ofthe Soviet Union. Prison and banishment, he had told his listeners, weresplendid aids to creativity; not a few masterpieces had been born within thewalls of cells, beyond the reach of the world’s distractions. For that matter,the greatest single achievement of the human intellect, the Principia itself,was a product of Newton’s self-imposed exile from plague-ridden London.The comparison was not immodest; from those years in Gorky had come not only newinsights into the structure of matter and the origin of the Universe, but theplasma-controlling concepts that had led to practical thermonuclear power. Thedrive itself, though the best-known and most publicized outcome of that work,was merely one byproduct of that astonishing intellectual outburst. The tragedywas that such advances had been triggered by injustice; one day, perhaps,humanity would find more civilized ways of managing its affairs.By the time they had left the chamber, Floyd had learned more about the SakharovDrive than he really wished to know, or expected to remember. He was wellacquainted with its basic principles - the use of a pulsed thermonuclearreaction to heat and expel virtually any propellant material. The best resultswere obtained with pure hydrogen as a working fluid, but that was excessivelybulky and difficult to store over long periods of time. Methane and ammonia wereacceptable alternatives; even water could be used, though with considerablypoorer efficiency.Leonov would compromise; the enormous liquid hydrogen tanks that provided theinitial impetus would be discarded when the ship had attained the necessaryspeed to carry it to Jupiter. At the destination, ammonia would be used for thebraking and rendezvous manoeuvres, and the eventual return to Earth.That was the theory, checked and rechecked in endless tests and computersimulations. But as the ill-fated Discovery had shown so well, all human planswere subject to ruthless revision by Nature, or Fate, or whatever one preferredto call the powers behind the Universe.‘So there you are, Dr Floyd,’ said an authoritative female voice, interruptingVasili’s enthusiastic explanation of magnetohydrodynamic feedback, ‘Why didn’tyou report to me?’Floyd rotated slowly on his axis by gently torquing himself with one hand. Hesaw a massive, maternal figure wearing a curious uniform adorned with dozens ofpockets and pouches; the effect was not unlike that of a Cossack trooper drapedwith cartridge belts.‘Nice to meet you again, Doctor. I’m still exploring - I hope you’ve received mymedical report from Houston.’‘Those vets at Teague! I wouldn’t trust them to recognize foot-and-mouthdisease!’Floyd knew perfectly well the mutual respect felt between Katerina Rudenko andthe Olin Teague Medical Center, even if the doctor’s broad grin had notdiscounted her words. She saw his look of frank curiosity, and proudly fingeredthe webbing around her ample waist.‘The conventional little black bag isn’t very practical in zero gravity - thingsfloat out of it and aren’t there when you need them. I designed this myself,it’s a complete minisurgery. With this, I could remove an appendix - or delivera baby.’‘I trust that particular problem won’t arise here.’‘Ha! A good doctor has to be ready for everything.’What a contrast, thought Floyd, between Captain Orlova and Dr - or should hecall her by her correct rank of Surgeon-Commander? - Rudenko. The captain hadthe grace and intensity of a prima ballerina; the doctor might have been theprototype of Mother Russia - stocky build, flat peasant face, needing only ashawl to complete the picture. Don’t let that fool you, Floyd told himself. Thisis the woman who saved at least a dozen lives during the Komarov dockingaccident - and, in her spare time, manages to edit the Annals of Space Medicine.Consider yourself very lucky to have her aboard.‘Now, Dr Floyd, you’re going to have plenty of time later to explore our littleship. My colleagues are too polite to say this, but they’ve work to do andyou’re in the way. I’d like to get you - all three of you - nice and peaceful asquickly as we can. Then we’ll have less to worry about.’‘I was afraid of that, but I quite see your point of view. I’m ready as soon asyou are.’‘I’m always ready. Come along - please.’The ship’s hospital was just large enough to hold an operating table, twoexercise bicycles, a few cabinets of equipment, and an X-ray machine. While DrRudenko was giving Floyd a quick but thorough examination, she askedunexpectedly: ‘What’s that little gold cylinder Dr Chandra carries on the chainaround his neck - some kind of communications device? He wouldn’t take it off -in fact, he was almost too shy to take anything off.’Floyd could not help smiling; it was easy to imagine the modest Indian’sreactions to this rather overwhelming lady.‘It’s a lingam.’‘A what?’‘You’re the doctor - you ought to recognize it. The symbol of male fertility.’‘Of course - stupid of me. Is he a practising Hindu? It’s a little late to askus to arrange a strict vegetarian diet.’‘Don’t worry - we wouldn’t have done that to you without fair warning. Though hewon’t touch alcohol, Chandra’s not fanatical about anything except computers. Heonce told me that his grandfather was a priest in Benares, and gave him thatlingam - it’s been in the family for generations.’Rather to Floyd’s surprise, Dr Rudenko did not show the negative reaction he hadexpected; indeed, her expression became uncharacteristically wistful.‘I understand his feeling. My grandmother gave me a beautiful icon - sixteenthcentury. I wanted to bring it - but it weighs five kilos.’The doctor became abruptly businesslike again, gave Floyd a painless injectionwith a gas-gun hypodermic, and told him to come back as soon as he was sleepy.That, she assured him, would be in less than two hours.‘Meanwhile, relax completely,’ she ordered. ‘There’s an observation port on thislevel - Station D.6. Why don’t you go there?’It seemed a good idea, and Floyd drifted away with a docility that would havesurprised his friends. Dr Rudenko glanced at her watch, dictated a brief entryinto her autosec, and set its alarm thirty minutes ahead.When he reached the D.6 viewport, Floyd found Chandra and Curnow already there.They looked at him with a total lack of recognition, then turned once moretoward the awesome spectacle outside. It occurred to Floyd - and hecongratulated himself on such a brilliant observation - that Chandra could notreally be enjoying the view. His eyes were tightly closed,A totally unfamiliar planet hung there, gleaming with glorious blues anddazzling whites. How strange, Floyd told himself. What has happened to theEarth? Why, of course - no wonder he didn’t recognize it! It was upside down!What a disaster - he wept briefly for all those poor people, falling off intospace..He barely noticed when two crew members removed Chandra’s unresisting form. Whenthey came back for Curnow, Floyd’s own eyes were shut, but he was stillbreathing. When they returned for him, even his breathing had ceased."},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWOIITSIEN"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWO6"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWOAWAKENINGAnd they told us we wouldn’t dream, thought Heywood Floyd, more with surprisethan annoyance. The glorious pink glow that surrounded him was very soothing; itreminded him of barbecues and the crackling logs of Christmas fire. But therewas no warmth; indeed, he felt a distinct though not uncomfortable coldness.Voices were murmuring, just too softly for him to understand the words. Theybecame louder - but still he could not understand.‘Surely,’ he said in sudden amazement, ‘I can’t be dreaming in Russian!’‘No, Heywood,’ answered a woman’s voice. ‘You’re not dreaming. It’s time to getout of bed.’The lovely glow faded; he opened his eyes, and had a blurred glimpse of aflashlight being withdrawn from his face. He was lying on a couch, held againstit by elastic webbing; figures were standing around him, but they were too outof focus to identify.Gentle fingers closed his eyelids and massaged his forehead.‘Don’t exert yourself. Breathe deeply… again… that’s right… now how do youfeel?’‘I don’t know… strange… light-headed… and hungry.’‘That’s a good sign. Do you know where you are? You can open your eyes now.’The figures came into focus - first Dr Rudenko, then Captain Orlova. Butsomething had happened to Tanya since he had seen her, only an hour ago. WhenFloyd identified the cause, it was almost a physical shock.‘You’ve grown your hair back!’‘I hope you think it’s an improvement. I can’t say the same about your beard.’Floyd lifted his hand to his face, finding that he had to make a consciouseffort to plan every stage of the movement. His chin was covered with shortstubble - a two or three days’ growth. In hibernation, hair grew at only ahundredth of its normal rate.‘So I made it,’ he said. ‘We’ve arrived at Jupiter.’Tanya looked at him sombrely, then glanced at the doctor, who gave a barelyperceptible nod.‘No, Heywood,’ she said. ‘We’re still a month away. Don’t be alarmed - theship’s fine, and everything’s running normally. But your friends in Washingtonhave asked us to wake you up ahead of time. Something very unexpected hashappened. We’re in a race to reach Discovery - and I’m afraid we’re going tolose.’"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWO7"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWOTSIENWhen Heywood Floyd’s voice came from the comset speaker, the two dolphinssuddenly stopped circling around the pool and swam over to its edge. They placedtheir heads on the rim and stared intently at the source of the sound.So they recognize Heywood, thought Caroline, with a twinge of bitterness: YetChristopher, crawling around his playpen, did not even stop playing with thecolour controls of his picture book as his father’s voice came loud and clearacross half a billion kilometres of space.‘… My dear, you won’t be surprised to hear from me, a month ahead of schedule;you’ll have known for weeks that we have company out here.‘I still find it hard to believe; in some ways, it doesn’t even make sense. Theycan’t possibly have enough fuel for a safe return to Earth; we don’t even seehow they can make the rendezvous.‘We never saw them, of course. Even at its closest, Tsien was more than fiftymillion kilometres away. They had plenty of time to answer our signals if theywanted to, but they ignored us completely. Now they’ll be much too busy forfriendly chat. In a few hours they’ll hit Jupiter’s atmosphere - and then we’llsee how well their aerobraking system works. If it does its job, that will begood for our morale. But if it fails, well, let’s not talk about that.‘The Russians are taking it remarkably well, all things considered. They’reangry and disappointed, of course - but I’ve heard many expressions of frankadmiration. It was certainly a brilliant trick, building that ship in full viewand making everyone think it was a spacestation until they hitched on thoseboosters.‘Well, there’s nothing we can do, except watch. And at our distance, we won’thave a much better view than your best telescopes. I can’t help wishing themluck, though of course I hope they leave Discovery alone. That’s our property,and I bet the State Department’s reminding them of it, every hour on the hour.‘It’s an ill wind - if our Chinese friends hadn’t jumped the gun on us, youwouldn’t have heard from me for another month. But now that Dr Rudenko’s wokenme up, I’ll be speaking to you every couple of days.‘After the initial shock, I’m settling down nicely- getting to know the ship andits crew, finding my space legs. And polishing up my lousy Russian, though Idon’t have much chance of using it - everyone insists on speaking English.What shocking linguists we Americans are! I sometimes feel ashamed of ourchauvinism - or our laziness.‘The standard of on-board English ranges from absolutely perfect - ChiefEngineer Sasha Kovalev could earn a living as a BBC announcer - down to theif-you-talk-fast-enough-it-doesn’t-matter-how-many-mistakes-you-make variety.The only one who isn’t fluent is Zenia Marchenko, who replaced Irma Yakunina atthe last moment. Incidentally, I’m glad to hear that Irma made a good recovery -what a disappointment that must have been! I wonder if she’s startedhang-gliding again.‘And speaking of accidents, it’s obvious that Zenia must also have had a verybad one. Though the plastic surgeons have done a remarkable job, you can tellthat she must have been severely burned at some time. She’s the baby of the crewand the others treat her with - I was going to say pity, but that’s toocondescending. Let’s say with special kindness.‘Maybe you’re wondering how I get on with Captain Tanya. Well, I like her verymuch - but I’d hate to make her angry. There’s no doubt exactly who runs thisship.‘And Surgeon-Commander Rudenko - you met her at the Honolulu AerospaceConvention two years ago, and I’m sure you won’t have forgotten that last party.You’ll understand why we all call her Catherine the Great - behind her broadback, of course.‘But that’s enough gossip. If I run overtime, I hate to think of the surcharge.And by the way, these personal calls are supposed to be completely private. Butthere are a lot of links in the communications chain, so don’t be surprised ifyou occasionally get messages by - well, another route.‘I’ll be waiting to hear from you - tell the girls I’ll be speaking to themlater. My love to you all - I miss you and Chris very badly. And when I getback, I promise I’ll never leave again.’There was a brief hissing pause, then an obviously synthetic voice said: ‘Thisterminates Transmission Four Hundred Thirty-two Stroke Seven from SpacecraftLeonov.’ As Caroline Floyd switched off the speaker, the two dolphins slidbeneath the surface of the pool and glided out into the Pacific, leavingscarcely a ripple in the water.When he realized that his friends were gone, Christopher began to cry. Hismother picked him up in her arms and tried to comfort him, but it was a longtime before she succeeded."},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWO8"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWOTRANSIT OF JUPITERThe image of Jupiter, with its ribbons of white cloud, its mottled bands ofsalmon pink, and the Great Red Spot staring out like a baleful eye, hung steadyon the flight-deck projection screen. It was three-quarters full, but no one waslooking at the illuminated disk; all eyes were focused on the crescent ofdarkness at its edge. There, over the nightside of the planet, the Chinese shipwas about to meet its moment of truth.This is absurd, thought Floyd. We can’t possibly see anything across fortymillion kilometres. And it doesn’t matter; the radio will tell us all we want toknow.Tsien had closed down all voice, video, and data circuits two hours before, asthe long-range antennas were withdrawn into the protective shadow of the heatshield. Only the omnidirectional beacon was still transmitting, accuratelypinpointing the Chinese ship’s position as it plunged toward that ocean ofcontinent-sized clouds. The shrill beep… beep… beep… was the only sound inLeonov’s control room. Each of those pulses had left Jupiter more than twominutes earlier; by this time, their source might already be a cloud ofincandescent gas, dispersing in the Jovian stratosphere.The signal was fading, becoming noisy. The beeps were getting distorted; severaldropped out completely, then the sequence returned. A plasma sheath was buildingup around Tsien and soon would cut off all communications until the shipre-emerged. If it ever did.‘Posmotri!’ cried Max. ‘There it is!’At first Floyd could see nothing. Then, just off the edge of the illuminateddisk, he made out a tiny star - gleaming where no star could possibly be,against the darkened face of Jupiter.It appeared quite motionless, though he knew it must be moving at a hundredkilometres a second. Slowly it grew in brilliance; and then it was no longer adimensionless point, but was becoming elongated. A man-made comet was streakingacross the Jovian night sky, leaving a trail of incandescence thousands ofkilometres in length.One last badly distorted and curiously drawn-out beep sounded from the trackingbeacon, then only the meaningless hiss of Jupiter’s own radiation, one of thosemany cosmic voices that had nothing to do with Man or his works.Tsien was inaudible, but not yet invisible. For they could see that the tinyelongated spark had indeed moved appreciably away from the sunward face of theplanet and would soon disappear into the nightside. By then, if all had goneaccording to plan, Jupiter would have captured the ship, destroying its unwantedvelocity. When it emerged from behind the giant world, it would be anotherJovian satellite.The spark flickered out. Tsien had rounded the curve of the planet and washeading over the nightside. There would be nothing to see, or to hear, until itemerged from shadow - if all went well, in just under an hour. It would be avery long hour for the Chinese.To Chief Scientist Vasili Orlov and communications engineer Sasha Kovalev, thehour went extremely quickly. There was much they could learn from observationsof that little star; its times of appearance and disappearance and, above all,the Doppler shift of the radio beacon gave vital information about Tsien’s neworbit. Leonov’s computers were already digesting the figures, and spitting outprojected times of re-emergence based on various assumptions about rates ofdeceleration in the Jovian atmosphere.Vasili switched off the computer display, spun around in his chair, loosened hisseat belt, and addressed the patiently waiting audience.‘Earliest reappearance is in forty-two minutes. Why don’t you spectators go fora walk, so we can concentrate on getting all this into good shape? See you inthirty-five minutes. Shoo! Nu ukhodi!’Reluctantly, the unwanted bodies left the bridge - but, to Vasili’s disgust,everyone was back again in little more than thirty minutes. He was still chidingthem for their lack of faith in his calculations when the familiar beep… beep…beep… of Tsien’s tracking beacon burst from the loudspeakers.Vasili looked astonished and mortified, but soon joined in the spontaneous roundof applause; Floyd could not see who first started the clapping. Rivals thoughthey might be, they were all astronauts together, as far from home as any menhad ever travelled - ‘Ambassadors for Mankind’, in the noble words of the firstUN Space Treaty. Even if they did not want the Chinese to succeed, neither didthey wish them to meet disaster.A large element of self-interest was also involved, Floyd could not helpthinking. Now the odds in Leonov’s own favour were significantly improved; Tsienhad demonstrated that the aerobraking manoeuvre was indeed possible. The data onJupiter was correct; its atmosphere did not contain unexpected and perhaps fatalsurprises.‘Well!’ said Tanya. ‘I suppose we should send them a message of congratulations.But even if we did, they wouldn’t acknowledge it.’Some of his colleagues were still making fun of Vasili, who was staring at hiscomputer output in frank disbelief.‘I don’t understand it!’ he exclaimed. ‘They should still be behind Jupiter!Sasha - give me a velocity reading on their beacon!’Another silent dialogue was held with the computer; then Vasili gave a long, lowwhistle.‘Something’s wrong. They’re in a capture orbit, all right - but it won’t letthem make a rendezvous with Discovery. The orbit they’re on now will take themway beyond Io - I’ll have more accurate data when we’ve tracked them for anotherfive minutes.’‘Anyway, they must be in a safe orbit,’ said Tanya. ‘They can always makecorrections later.’‘Perhaps. But that could cost them days, even if they have the fuel. Which Idoubt.’‘So we may still beat them.’‘Don’t be such an optimist. We’re still three weeks from Jupiter. They can makea dozen orbits before we get there, and choose the most favourable one for arendezvous.’‘Again - assuming that they have enough propellant.’‘Of course. And that’s something we can only make educated guesses about.’All this conversation took place in such rapid and excited Russian that Floydwas left far behind. When Tanya took pity on him and explained that Tsien hadovershot and was heading for the outer satellites, his first reaction was: ‘Thenthey may be in serious trouble. What will you do if they appeal for help?’‘You must be making a joke. Can you imagine them doing that? They’re much tooproud. Anyway, it would be impossible. We can’t change our mission profile, asyou know perfectly well. Even if we had the fuel…’‘You’re right, of course; but it might be difficult to explain that to theninety-nine per cent of the human race that doesn’t understand orbitalmechanics. We should start thinking about some of the political complications -it would look bad for all of us if we can’t help. Vasili, will you give me theirfinal orbit, as soon as you’ve worked it out? I’m going down to my cabin to dosome homework.’Floyd’s cabin, or rather one-third of a cabin, was still partly full of stores,many of them stacked in the curtained bunks that would be occupied by Chandraand Curnow when they emerged from their long slumbers. He had managed to clear asmall working space for his personal effects and had been promised the luxury ofanother whole two cubic metres - just as soon as someone could be spared to helpwith the furniture removing.Floyd unlocked his little communications console, set the decryption keys, andcalled for the information on Tsien that had been transmitted to him fromWashington. He wondered if his hosts had had any luck in unscrambling it; thecipher was based on the product of two hundred-digit prime numbers, and theNational Security Agency had staked its reputation on the claim that the fastestcomputer in existence could not crack it before the Big Crunch at the end of theUniverse. It was a claim that could never be proved - only disproved.Once again he stared intently at the excellent photographs of the Chinese ship,taken when it had revealed its true colours and was just about to leave Earthorbit. There were later shots - not so clear, because by then it had been faraway from the prying cameras - of the final stage as it hurtled toward Jupiter.Those were the ones that interested him most; even more useful were the cutawaydrawings and estimates of performance.Granted the most optimistic assumptions, it was difficult to see what theChinese hoped to do. They must have burned up at least ninety per cent of theirpropellant in that mad dash across the Solar System. Unless it was literally asuicide mission - something that could not be ruled out - only a plan involvinghibernation and later rescue made any sense. And Intelligence did not believethat Chinese hibernation technology was sufficiently far advanced to make that aviable option.But Intelligence was frequently wrong, and even more often confused by theavalanche of raw facts it had to evaluate - the ‘noise’ in its informationcircuits. It had done a remarkable job on Tsien, considering the shortness oftime, but Floyd wished that the material sent to him had been more carefullyfiltered. Some of it was obvious junk, of no possible connection with themission.Nevertheless, when you did not know what you were looking for, it was importantto avoid all prejudices and preconceptions; something that at first sight seemedirrelevant, or even nonsensical, might turn out to be a vital clue.With a sigh, Floyd started once more to skim the five hundred pages of data,keeping his mind as blankly receptive as possible while diagrams, charts,photographs - some so smudgy that they could represent almost anything - newsitems, lists of delegates to scientific conferences, titles of technicalpublications, and even commercial documents scrolled swiftly down thehigh-resolution screen. A very efficient industrial espionage system hadobviously been extremely busy; who would have thought that so many Japaneseholomemory modules or Swiss gas-flow microcontrollers or German radiationdetectors could have been traced to a destination in the dried lake bed of LopNor - the first milepost on their way to Jupiter?Some of the items must have been included by accident; they could not possiblyrelate to the mission. If the Chinese had placed a secret order for one thousandinfrared sensors through a dummy corporation in Singapore, that was only theconcern of the military; it seemed highly unlikely that Tsien expected to bechased by heat-seeking missiles. And this one was really funny - specializedsurveying and prospecting equipment from Glacier Geophysics, Inc., of Anchorage,Alaska. What lamebrain imagined that a deep-space expedition would have any need- the smile froze on Floyd’s lips; he felt the skin crawl on the back of hisneck. My God - they wouldn’t dare! But they had already dared greatly; and now,at last, everything made sense.He flashed back to the photos and conjectured plans of the Chinese ship. Yes, itwas just conceivable - those flutings at the rear, alongside the drivedeflection electrodes, would be about the right size.Floyd called the bridge. ‘Vasili.’ he said, ‘have you worked out their orbityet?’‘Yes, I have,’ the navigator replied, in a curiously subdued voice. Floyd couldtell at once that something had turned up. He took a long shot.‘They’re making a rendezvous with Europa, aren’t they?’There was an explosive gasp of disbelief from the other end.‘Chyort voz’mi! How did you know?’‘I didn’t - I’ve just guessed it.’‘There can’t be any mistake - I’ve checked the figures to six places. Thebraking manoeuvre worked out exactly as they intended. They’re right on coursefor Europa - it couldn’t have happened by chance. They’ll be there in seventeenhours.’‘And go into orbit.’‘Perhaps; it wouldn’t take much propellant. But what would be the point?’‘I’ll risk another guess. They’ll do a quick survey - and then they’ll land.’‘You’re crazy - or do you know something we don’t?’‘No - it’s just a matter of simple deduction. You’re going to start kickingyourself for missing the obvious.’‘Okay, Sherlock, why should anyone want to land on Europa? What’s there, forheaven’s sake?’Floyd was enjoying his little moment of triumph. Of course, he might still becompletely wrong.‘What’s on Europa? Only the most valuable substance in the Universe.’He had overdone it; Vasili was no fool, and snatched the answer from his lips.‘Of course - water!’‘Exactly. Billions and billions of tons of it. Enough to fill up the propellanttanks - go cruising around all the satellites, and still have plenty left forthe rendezvous with Discovery and the voyage home. I hate to say this, Vasili -but our Chinese friends have outsmarted us again.‘Always assuming, of course, that they can get away with it.’"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWO9"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWOTHE ICE OF THE GRAND CANALApart from the jet-black sky, the photo might have been taken almost anywhere inthe polar regions of Earth; there was nothing in the least alien about the seaof wrinkled ice that stretched all the way out to the horizon. Only the fivespacesuited figures in the foreground proclaimed that the panorama was ofanother world.Even now, the secretive Chinese had not released the names of the crew. Theanonymous intruders on the frozen Europan icescape were merely the chiefscientist, the commander, the navigator, the first engineer, the secondengineer. It was also ironic, Floyd could not help thinking, that everyone onEarth had seen the already historic photograph an hour before it reached Leonov,so much closer to the scene. But Tsien’s transmissions were relayed on such atight beam that it was impossible to intercept them; Leonov could receive onlyits beacon, broadcasting impartially in all directions. Even that was inaudiblemore than half the time, as Europa’s rotation carried it out of sight, or thesatellite itself was eclipsed by the monstrous bulk of Jupiter. All the scantynews of the Chinese mission had to be relayed from Earth.The ship had touched down, after its initial survey, on one of the few islandsof solid rock that protruded through the crust of ice covering virtually theentire moon. That ice was flat from pole to pole; there was no weather to carveit into strange shapes, no drifting snow to build up layer upon layer intoslowly moving hills. Meteorites might fall upon airless Europa, but never aflake of snow. The only forces moulding its surface were the steady tug ofgravity, reducing all elevations to one uniform level, and the incessant quakescaused by the other satellites as they passed and repassed Europa in theirorbits. Jupiter itself, despite its far greater mass, had much less effect. TheJovian tides had finished their work aeons ago, ensuring that Europa remainedlocked forever with one face turned toward its giant master.All this had been known since the Voyager flyby missions of the 1970s, theGalileo surveys of the 1980s, and the Kepler landings of the 1990s. But, in afew hours, the Chinese had learned more about Europa than all the previousmissions combined. That knowledge they were keeping to themselves; one mightregret it, but few would deny that they had earned the right to do so.What was being denied, with greater and greater asperity, was their right toannex the satellite. For the first time in history, a nation had laid claim toanother world, and all the news media of Earth were arguing over the legalposition. Though the Chinese pointed out, at tedious length, that they had neversigned the ‘02 UN Space Treaty and so were not bound by its provisions, that didnothing to quell the angry protests.Suddenly, Europa was the biggest news in the Solar System. And theman-on-the-spot (at least to the nearest few million kilometres) was in greatdemand.‘This is Heywood Floyd, aboard Cosmonaut Alexei Leonov, on course for Jupiter.But as you can well imagine, all our thoughts are now focused upon Europa.‘At this very moment I’m looking at it through the most powerful of the ship’stelescopes; under this magnification, it’s ten times larger than the Moon as yousee it with the naked eye. And it’s a really weird sight.‘The surface is a uniform pink, with a few small brown patches. It’s coveredwith an intricate network of narrow lines, curling and weaving in alldirections. In fact, it looks very much like a photo from a medical textbook,showing a pattern of veins and arteries.‘A few of these features are hundreds - or even thousands - of kilometres long,and look rather like the illusory canals that Percival Lowell and otherearly-twentieth-century astronomers imagined they’d seen on Mars.‘But Europa’s canals aren’t an illusion, though of course they’re notartificial. What’s more, they do contain water -or at least ice. For thesatellite is almost entirely covered by ocean, averaging fifty kilometres deep.‘Because it’s so far from the sun, Europa’s surface temperature is extremely low- about a hundred and fifty degrees below freezing. So one might expect itssingle ocean to be a solid block of ice.‘Surprisingly, that isn’t the case because there’s a lot of heat generatedinside Europa by tidal forces - the same forces that drive the great volcanoeson neighbouring Io.‘So the ice is continually melting, breaking up, and freezing, forming cracksand lanes like those in the floating ice sheets in our own polar regions. It’sthat intricate tracery of cracks I’m seeing now; most of them are dark and veryancient - perhaps millions of years old. But a few are almost pure white;they’re the new ones that have just opened up, and have a crust only a fewcentimetres thick.‘Tsien has landed right beside one of these white streaks -thefifteen-hundred-kilometre-long feature that’s been christened the Grand Canal.Presumably the Chinese intend to pump its water into their propellant tanks, sothat they can explore the Jovian satellite system and then return to Earth. Thatmay not be easy, but they’ll certainly have studied the landing site with greatcare, and must know what they’re doing.‘It’s obvious, now, why they’ve taken such a risk - and why they should claimEuropa. As a refuelling point, it could be the key to the entire outer SolarSystem. Though there’s also water on Ganymede, it’s all frozen, and also lessaccessible because of that satellite’s more powerful gravity.‘And there’s another point that’s just occurred to me. Even if the Chinese doget stranded on Europa, they might be able to survive until a rescue mission isarranged. They have plenty of power, there may be useful minerals in the area -and we know that the Chinese are the experts on synthetic-food production. Itwouldn’t be a very luxurious life; but I have some friends who would accept ithappily for that staggering view of Jupiter sprawled across the sky - the viewwe expect to see ourselves, in just a few days.‘This is Heywood Floyd, saying goodbye for my colleagues and myself, aboardAlexei Leonov.’‘And this is the bridge. Very nice presentation, Heywood. You should have been anewsman.’‘I’ve had plenty of practice. Half my time was spent on PR work.’‘PR?’‘Public relations - usually telling politicians why they should give me moremoney. Something you don’t have to bother about.’‘How I wish that was true. Anyway, come up to the bridge. There’s some newinformation we’d like to discuss with you.’Floyd removed his button microphone, locked the telescope into position andextricated himself from the tiny viewing blister. As he left, he almost collidedwith Nikolai Temovsky, obviously on a similar mission.‘I’m about to steal your best quotes for Radio Moscow, Woody. Hope you don’tmind.’‘You’re welcome, tovarishch. Anyway, how could I stop you?’Up on the bridge, Captain Orlova was looking thoughtfully at a dense mass ofwords and figures on the main display. Floyd had painfully started totransliterate them when she interrupted him.‘Don’t worry about the details. These are estimates of the time it will take forTsien to refill its tanks and get ready for lift-off.’‘My people are doing the same calculations - but there are far too manyvariables.’‘We think we’ve removed one of them. Did you know that the very best water pumpsyou can buy belong to fire brigades? And would you be surprised to learn thatthe Beijing Central Station had four of its latest models suddenly requisitioneda few months ago, despite the protests of the mayor?’‘I’m not surprised - merely lost in admiration. Go on, please.’‘That may be a coincidence, but those pumps would be just the right size. Makingeducated guesses about pipe deployment, drilling through the ice and so on -well, we think they could lift off again in five days.’‘Five days!’‘If they’re lucky, and everything works perfectly. And if they don’t wait tofill their propellant tanks but merely take on just enough for a safe rendezvouswith Discovery before we do. Even if they beat us by a single hour, that wouldbe enough. They could claim salvage rights, at the very least.’‘Not according to the State Department’s lawyers. At the appropriate moment,we’ll declare that Discovery is not a derelict, but has merely been parked untilwe can retrieve it. Any attempt to take over the ship would be an act ofpiracy.’‘I’m sure the Chinese will be most impressed.’‘If they’re not, what can we do about it?’‘We outnumber them - and two to one, when we revive Chandra and Curnow.’‘Are you serious? Where are the cutlasses for the boarding party?’‘Cutlasses?’‘Swords - weapons.’‘Oh. We could use the laser telespectrometer. That can vaporize milligramasteroid samples at ranges of a thousand kilometres.’‘I’m not sure that I like this conversation. My government certainly would notcondone violence, except of course in self-defence.’‘You naive Americans! We’re more realistic; we have to be. All your grandparentsdied of old age, Heywood. Three of mine were killed in the Great Patriotic War.’When they were alone together, Tanya always called him Woody, never Heywood. Shemust be serious. Or was she merely testing his reactions?‘Anyway, Discovery is merely a few billion dollars’ worth of hardware. Theship’s not important - only the information it carries.’‘Exactly. Information that could be copied, and then erased.’‘You do get some cheerful ideas, Tanya. Sometimes I think that all Russians area little paranoiac.’‘Thanks to Napoleon and Hitler, we’ve earned every right to be. But don’t tellme that you haven’t already worked out that - what do you call it, scenario? -for yourself.’‘It wasn’t necessary,’ Floyd answered rather glumly. ‘The State Department’salready done it for me - with variations. We’ll just have to see which one theChinese come up with. And I wouldn’t be in the least surprised if they outguessus again.’"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWO10"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWOA CRY FROM EUROPASleeping in zero gravity is a skill that has to be learned; it had taken Floydalmost a week to find the best way of anchoring legs and arms so that they didnot drift into uncomfortable positions. Now he was an expert, and was notlooking forward to the return of weight; indeed, the very idea gave himoccasional nightmares.Someone was shaking him awake. No - he must still be dreaming! Privacy wassacred aboard a spaceship; nobody ever entered another crew member’s chamberswithout first asking permission. He clenched his eyes shut, but the shakingcontinued.‘Dr Floyd - please wake up! You’re wanted on the flight deck!’And nobody called him Dr Floyd; the most formal salutation he had received forweeks was Doc. What was happening?Reluctantly, he opened his eyes. He was in his tiny cabin, gently gripped by hissleeping cocoon. So one part of his mind told him; then why was he looking at -Europa? They were still millions of kilometres away.There were the familiar reticulations, the patterns of triangles and polygonsformed by intersecting lines. And surely that was the Grand Canal itself - no,it wasn’t quite right. How could it be, since he was still in his little cabinaboard Leonov?‘Dr Floyd!’He became fully awake, and realized that his left hand was floating just a fewcentimetres in front of his eyes. How strange that the pattern of lines acrossthe palm was so uncannily like the map of Europa! But economical Mother Naturewas always repeating herself, on such vastly different scales as the swirl ofmilk stirred into coffee, the cloud lanes of a cyclonic storm, the arms of aspiral nebula.‘Sorry, Max,’ he said. ‘What’s the problem? Is something wrong?’‘We think so - but not with us. Tsien’s in trouble.’Captain, navigator, and chief engineer were strapped in their seats on theflight deck; the rest of the crew orbited anxiously around convenient handholds,or watched on the monitors.‘Sorry to wake you up, Heywood,’ Tanya apologized brusquely. ‘Here’s thesituation. Ten minutes ago we had a Class One Priority from Mission Control.Tsien’s gone off the air. It happened very suddenly, in the middle of a ciphermessage; there were a few seconds of garbled transmission - then nothing.’‘Their beacon?’‘That’s stopped as well. We can’t receive it either,’‘Phew! Then it must be serious - a major breakdown. Any theories?’‘Lots - but all guesswork. An explosion - landslide - earthquake: who knows?’‘And we may never know - until someone else lands on Europa - or we do a closeflyby and take a look.’Tanya shook her head. ‘We don’t have enough delta-vee. The closest we could getis fifty thousand kilometres. Not much you could see from that distance.’‘Then there’s absolutely nothing we can do.’‘Not quite, Heywood. Mission Control has a suggestion. They’d like us to swingour big dish around, just in case we can pick up any weak emergencytransmissions. It’s - how do you say? - a long shot, but worth trying. What doyou think?’Floyd’s first reaction was strongly negative.‘That will mean breaking our link with Earth.’‘Of course; but we’ll have to do that anyway, when we go around Jupiter. And itwill only take a couple of minutes to re-establish the circuit.’Floyd remained silent. The suggestion was perfectly reasonable, yet it worriedhim obscurely. After puzzling for several seconds, he suddenly realized why hewas so opposed to the idea.Discovery’s troubles had started when the big dish - the main antenna complex -had lost its lock on Earth, for reasons which even now were not completelyclear. But Hal had certainly been involved, and there was no danger of a similarsituation arising here. Leonov’s computers were small, autonomous units; therewas no single controlling intelligence. At least, no nonhuman one.The Russians were still waiting patiently for his answer.‘I agree,’ he said at last. ‘Let Earth know what we’re doing, and startlistening. I suppose you’ll try all the SPACE MAYDAY frequencies.’‘Yes, as soon as we’ve worked out the Doppler corrections. How’s it going,Sasha?’‘Give me another two minutes, and I’ll have the automatic search running. Howlong should we listen?’The captain barely paused before giving her answer. Floyd had often admiredTanya Orlova’s decisiveness, and had once told her so. In a rare flash ofhumour, she had replied: ‘Woody, a commander can be wrong, but never uncertain.’‘Listen for fifty minutes, and report back to Earth for ten. Then repeat thecycle.’There was nothing to see or hear; the automatic circuits were better at siftingthe radio noise than any human senses. Nevertheless, from time to time Sashaturned up the audio monitor, and the roar of Jupiter’s radiation belts filledthe cabin. It was a sound like the waves breaking on all the beaches of Earth,with occasional explosive cracks from superbolts of lightning in the Jovianatmosphere. Of human signals, there was no trace; and, one by one, the membersof the crew not on duty drifted quietly away.While he was waiting, Floyd did some mental calculations. Whatever had happenedto Tsien was already two hours in the past, since the news had been relayed fromEarth.But Leonov should be able to pick up a direct message after less than a minute’sdelay, so the Chinese had already had ample time to get back on the air. Theircontinued silence suggested some catastrophic failure, and he found himselfweaving endless scenarios of disaster.The fifty minutes seemed like hours. When they were up, Sasha swung the ship’santenna complex back toward Earth, and reported failure. While he was using therest of the ten minutes to send a backlog of messages, he looked inquiringly atthe captain.‘Is it worth trying again?’ he said in a voice that clearly expressed his ownpessimism.‘Of course. We may cut back the search time - but we’ll keep listening.’On the hour, the big dish was once more focused upon Europa. And almost at once,the automatic monitor started flashing its ALERT light.Sasha’s hand darted to the audio gain, and the voice of Jupiter filled thecabin. Superimposed upon that, like a whisper heard against a thunderstorm, wasthe faint but completely unmistakable sound of human speech. It was impossibleto identify the language, though Floyd felt certain, from the intonation andrhythm, that it was not Chinese, but some European tongue.Sasha played skilfully with fine-tuning and band-width controls, and the wordsbecame clearer. The language was undoubtedly English - but its content was stillmaddeningly unintelligible.There is one combination of sounds that every human ear can detect instantly,even in the noisiest environment. When it suddenly emerged from the Jovianbackground, it seemed to Floyd that he could not possibly be awake, but wastrapped in some fantastic dream. His colleagues took a little longer to react;then they stared at him with equal amazement - and a slowly dawning suspicion.- For the first recognizable words from Europa were: ‘Dr Floyd - Dr Floyd - Ihope you can hear me.’"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWO11"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWOICE AND VACUUM‘Who is it?’ whispered someone, to a chorus of shushes. Floyd raised his handsin a gesture of ignorance - and, he hoped, innocence.‘… know you are aboard Leonov… may not have much time… aiming my suit antennawhere I think…’ The signal vanished for agonizing seconds, then came back muchclearer, though not appreciably louder.‘… relay this information to Earth. Tsien destroyed three hours ago. I’m onlysurvivor. Using my suit radio - no idea if it has enough range, but it’s theonly chance. Please listen carefully. THERE IS LIFE ON EUROPA. I repeat: THEREIS LIFE ON EUROPA.’The signal faded again. A stunned silence followed that no one attempted tointerrupt. While he was waiting, Floyd searched his memory furiously. He couldriot recognize the voice - it might have been that of any Western-educatedChinese. Probably it was someone he had met at a scientific conference, butunless the speaker identified himself he would never know.‘… soon after local midnight. We were pumping steadily and the tanks were almosthalf full. Dr Lee and I went out to check the pipe insulation. Tsien stands -stood - about thirty metres from the edge of the Grand Canal. Pipes go directlyfrom it and down through the ice. Very thin - not safe to walk on. The warmupwelling…’Again a long silence. Floyd wondered if the speaker was moving, and had beenmomentarily cut off by some obstruction.‘… no problem - five kilowatts of lighting strung up on the ship. Like aChristmas tree - beautiful, shining right through the ice. Glorious colours. Leesaw it first - a huge dark mass rising up from the depths. At first we thoughtit was a school of fish - too large for a single organism - then it started tobreak through the ice.‘Dr Floyd, I hope you can hear me. This is Professor Chang - we met in ‘02 -Boston IAU conference.’Instantly, incongruously, Floyd’s thoughts were a billion kilometres away. Hevaguely remembered that reception, after the closing session of theInternational Astronomical Union Congress - the last one that the Chinese hadattended before the Second Cultural Revolution. And now he recalled Chang verydistinctly - a small, humorous astronomer and exobiologist with a good fund ofjokes. He wasn’t joking now.‘… like huge strands of wet seaweed, crawling along the ground. Lee ran back tothe ship to get a camera - I stayed to watch, reporting over the radio. Thething moved so slowly I could easily outrun it. I was much more excited thanalarmed. Thought I knew what kind of creature it was - I’ve seen pictures of thekelp forests off California - but I was quite wrong.‘I could tell it was in trouble. It couldn’t possibly survive at a temperature ahundred and fifty below its normal environment. It was freezing solid as itmoved forward - bits were breaking off like glass - but it was still advancingtoward the ship, a black tidal wave, slowing down all the time.‘I was still so surprised that I couldn’t think straight and I couldn’t imaginewhat it was trying to do…’‘Is there any way we can call him back?’ Floyd whispered urgently.‘No - it’s too late. Europa will soon be behind Jupiter. We’ll have to waituntil it comes out of eclipse.’‘… climbing up the ship, building a kind of ice tunnel as it advanced. Perhapsthis was insulating it from the cold - the way termites protect themselves fromthe sunlight with their little corridors of mud.‘… tons of ice on the ship. The radio antennas broke off first. Then I could seethe landing legs beginning to buckle - all in slow motion, like a dream.‘Not until the ship started to topple did I realize what the thing was trying todo - and then it was too late. We could have saved ourselves - if we’d onlyswitched off those lights.‘Perhaps it’s a phototrope, its biological cycle triggered by the sunlight thatfilters through the icc, Or it could have been attracted like a moth to acandle. Our floodlights must have been more brilliant than anything that Europahas ever known.‘Then the ship crashed. I saw the hull split, a cloud of snowflakes form asmoisture condensed. All the lights went out, except for one, swinging back andforth on a cable a couple of metres above the ground.‘I don’t know what happened immediately after that. The next thing I remember, Iwas standing under the light, beside the wreck of the ship, with a finepowdering of fresh snow all around me. I could see my footsteps in it veryclearly. I must have run there; perhaps only a minute or two had elapsed.‘The plant - I still thought of it as a plant - was motionless. I wondered if ithad been damaged by the impact; large sections - as thick as a man’s arm - hadsplintered off, like broken twigs.‘Then the main trunk started to move again. It pulled away from the hull, andbegan to crawl toward me. That was when I knew for certain that the thing waslight-sensitive: I was standing immediately under the thousand watt lamp, whichhad stopped swinging now.‘Imagine an oak tree - better still, a banyan with its multiple trunks and roots- flattened out by gravity and trying to creep along the ground. It got towithin five metres of the light, then started to spread out until it had made aperfect circle around me. Presumably that was the limit of its tolerance - thepoint at which photo-attraction turned to repulsion. After that, nothinghappened for several minutes. I wondered if it was dead - frozen solid at last.‘Then I saw that large buds were forming on many of the branches. It was likewatching a time-lapse film of flowers opening. In fact I thought they wereflowers - each about as big as a man’s head.‘Delicate, beautifully coloured membranes started to unfold. Even then, itoccurred to me that no one - no thing - could ever have seen these coloursbefore; they had no existence until we brought our lights - our fatal lights -to this world.‘Tendrils, stamens, waving feebly… I walked over to the living wall thatsurrounded me, so that I could see exactly what was happening. Neither then, norat any other time, had I felt the slightest fear of the creature. I was certainthat it was not malevolent - if indeed it was conscious at all.‘There were scores of the big flowers, in various stages of unfolding. Now theyreminded me of butterflies, just emerging from the chrysalis - wings crumpled,still feeble - I was getting closer and closer to the truth.‘But they were freezing - dying as quickly as they formed. Then, one afteranother, they dropped off from the parent buds. For a few moments they floppedaround like fish stranded on dry land - at last I realized exactly what theywere. Those membranes weren’t petals - they were fins, or their equivalent. Thiswas the free-swimming, larval stage of the creature. Probably it spends much ofits life rooted on the seabed, then sends these mobile offspring in search ofnew territory. Just like the corals of Earth’s oceans.‘I knelt down to get a closer look at one of the little creatures. The beautifulcolours were fading now to a drab brown. Some of the petal-fins had snapped off,becoming brittle shards as they froze. But it was still moving feebly, and as Iapproached it tried to avoid me. I wondered how it sensed my presence.‘Then I noticed that the stamens - as I’d called them - all carried bright bluedots at their tips. They looked like tiny star sapphires - or the blue eyesalong the mantle of a scallop - aware of light, but unable to form true images.As I watched, the vivid blue faded, the sapphires became dull, ordinary stones.‘Dr Floyd - or anyone else, who is listening - I haven’t much more time; Jupiterwill soon block my signal. But I’ve almost finished.‘I knew then what I had to do. The cable to that thousand watt lamp was hangingalmost to the ground. I gave it a few tugs, and the light went out in a showerof sparks.‘I wondered if it was too late. For a few minutes, nothing happened. So I walkedover to the wall of tangled branches around me, and kicked it.‘Slowly, the creature started to unweave itself, and to retreat back to theCanal. There was plenty of light - I could see everything perfectly. Ganymedeand Callisto were in the sky - Jupiter was a huge, thin crescent - and there wasa big auroral display on the nightside, at the Jovian end of the Io flux tube.There was no need to use my helmet light.‘I followed the creature all the way back to the water, encouraging it with morekicks when it slowed down, feeling the fragments of ice crunching all the timebeneath my boots… as it neared the Canal, it seemed to gain strength and energy,as if it knew that it was approaching its natural home. I wondered if it wouldsurvive, to bud again.‘It disappeared through the surface, leaving a few last dead larvae on the alienland. The exposed free water bubbled for a few minutes until a scab ofprotective ice sealed it from the vacuum above. Then I walked back to the shipto see if there was anything to salvage - I don’t want to talk about that.‘I’ve only two requests to make, Doctor. When the taxonomists classify thiscreature, I hope they’ll name it after me.‘And - when the next ship comes home - ask them to take our bones back to China.‘Jupiter will be cutting us off in a few minutes. I wish I knew whether anyonewas receiving me. Anyway, I’ll repeat this message when we’re in line of sightagain - if my suit’s life-support system lasts that long.‘This is Professor Chang on Europa, reporting the destruction of spaceshipTsien. We landed beside the Grand Canal and set up our pumps at the edge of theice -,The signal faded abruptly, came back for a moment, then disappeared completelybe1ow the noise level. Although Leonov listened again on the same frequency,there was no further message from Professor Chang."},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWOIIIDISCOVERY"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWO12"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWODOWNHILL RUNThe ship was gaining speed at last, on the downhill run toward Jupiter. It hadlong since passed the gravitational no-man’s-land where the four tiny outermoons - Sinope, Pasiphae, Ananke, and Carme - wobbled along their retrograde andwildly eccentric orbits. Undoubtedly captured asteroids, and completelyirregular in shape, the largest was only thirty kilometres across. Jagged,splintered rocks of no interest to anyone except planetary geologists, theirallegiance wavered continually between the Sun and Jupiter. One day, the Sunwould recapture them completely.But Jupiter might retain the second group of four, at half the distance of theothers. Elara, Lysithea, Himalia, and Leda were fairly close together, and lyingin almost the same plane. There was speculation that they had once been part ofa single body; if so, the parent would have been barely a hundred kilometresacross.Though only Carme and Leda came close enough to show disks visible to the nakedeye, they were greeted like old friends. Here was the first landfall after thelongest ocean voyage - the offshore islands of Jupiter. The last hours wereticking away; the most critical phase of the entire mission was approaching -the entry into the Jovian atmosphere.Jupiter was already larger than the Moon in the skies of Earth, and the giantinner satellites could be clearly seen moving around it. They all showednoticeable disks and distinctive colouring, though they were still too far awayfor any markings to be visible. The eternal ballet they performed - disappearingbehind Jupiter, reappearing to transit the daylight face with their accompanyingshadows - was an endlessly engaging spectacle. It was one that astronomers hadwatched ever since Galileo had first glimpsed it almost exactly four centuriesago; but the crew of Leonov were the only living men and women to have seen itwith unaided eyes.The interminable chess games had ceased; off-duty hours were spent at thetelescopes, or in earnest conversation, or listening to music, usually whilegazing at the view outside. And at least one shipboard romance had reached aculmination: the frequent disappearances of Max Brailovsky and Zenia Marchenkowere the subject of much good-natured banter.They were, thought Floyd, an oddly matched pair. Max was a big, handsome blondwho had been a champion gymnast, reaching the finals of the 2000 Olympics.Though he was in his early thirties, he had an open-faced, almost boyishexpression. This was not altogether misleading; despite his brilliantengineering record, he often struck Floyd as naive and unsophisticated - one ofthose people who are pleasant to talk to, but not for too long. Outside his ownfield of undoubted expertise he was engaging but rather shallow.Zenia - at twenty-nine, the youngest on board - was still something of amystery. Since no one wished to talk about it, Floyd had never raised thesubject of her injuries, and his Washington sources could provide noinformation. Obviously she had been involved in some serious accident, but itmight have been nothing more unusual than a car crash. The theory that she hadbeen on a secret space mission - still part of popular mythology outside theUSSR - could be ruled out. Thanks to the global tracking networks, no such thinghad been possible for fifty years.In addition to her physical and doubtless psychological scars, Zenia labouredunder yet another handicap. She was a last-minute replacement, and everyone knewit. Irma Yakunina was to have been dietician and medical assistant aboard Leonovbefore that unfortunate argument with a hang-glider broke too many bones.Every day at 1800 GMT the crew of seven plus one passenger gathered in the tinycommon room that separated the flight deck from the galley and sleepingquarters. The circular table at its centre was just big enough for eight peopleto squeeze around; when Chandra and Curnow were revived, it would be unable toaccommodate everyone, and two extra seats would have to be fitted in somewhereelse.Though the ‘Six O’Clock Soviet’, as the daily round-table conference was called,seldom lasted more than ten minutes, it played a vital role in maintainingmorale. Complaints, suggestions, criticisms, progress reports - anything couldbe raised, subject only to the captain’s overriding veto, which was very seldomexercised.Typical items on the non-existent agenda were requests for changes in the menu,appeals for more private communication time with Earth, suggested movieprogrammes, exchange of news and gossip, and good-natured needling of theheavily-outnumbered American contingent. Things would change, Floyd warned them,when his colleagues came out of hibernation, and the odds improved from I in 7to 3 in 9. He did not mention his private belief that Curnow could outtalk oroutshout any three other people aboard.When he was not sleeping, much of Floyd’s own time was spent in the common room- partly because, despite its smallness, it was much less claustrophobic thanhis own tiny cubicle. It was also cheerfully decorated, all available flatsurfaces being covered with photos of beautiful land and seascapes, sportingevents, portraits of popular videostars, and other reminders of Earth. Pride ofplace, however, was given to an original Leonov painting - his 1965 study‘Beyond the Moon’, made in the same year when, as a young lieutenant-colonel, heleft Voskhod II and became the first man in history to perform an extravehicularexcursionsClearly the work of a talented amateur, rather than a professional, it showedthe cratered edge of the Moon with the beautiful Sinus lridum - Bay of Rainbows- in the foreground. Looming monstrously above the lunar horizon was the thincrescent of Earth, embracing the darkened nightside of the planet. Beyond thatblazed the Sun, the streamers of the corona reaching out into space for millionsof kilometres around it.It was a striking composition - and a glimpse of the future that even then layonly three years ahead. On the flight of Apollo 8, Anders, Borman and Lovellwere to see this splendid sight with their unaided eyes, as they watched Earthrise above the farside on Christmas Day, 1968.Heywood Floyd admired the painting, but he also regarded it with mixed feelings.He could not forget that it was older than everybody else on the ship - with oneexception.He was already nine years old when Alexei Leonov had painted it."},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWO13"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWOTHE WORLDS OF GALILEOEven now, more than three decades after the revelations of the first Voyagerflybys, no one really understood why the four giant satellites differed sowildly from one another. They were all about the same size, and in the same partof the Solar System - yet they were totally dissimilar, as if children of adifferent birth.Only Callisto, the outermost, had turned out to be much as expected. When Leonovraced past at a distance of just over 100,000 kilometres, the larger of itscountless craters were clearly visible to the naked eye. Through the telescope,the satellite looked like a glass ball that had been used as a target byhigh-powered rifles; it was completely covered with craters of every size, rightdown to the lower limit of visibility. Callisto, someone had once remarked,looked more like Earth’s Moon than did the Moon itself.Nor was this particularly surprising. One would have expected a world out here -at the edge of the asteroid belt - to have been bombarded with the debris leftover from the creation of the Solar System. Yet Ganymede, the satellite nextdoor, had a totally different appearance. Though it had been well peppered withimpact craters in the remote past, most of them had been ploughed over - aphrase that seemed peculiarly appropriate. Huge areas of Ganymede were coveredwith ridges and furrows, as if some cosmic gardener had dragged a giant rakeacross them. And there were light-coloured streaks, like trails that might havebeen made by slugs fifty kilometres across. Most mysterious of all were long,meandering bands, containing dozens of parallel lines. It was Nikolai Ternovskywho decided what they must be - multilane superhighways, laid out by drunkensurveyors. He even claimed to have detected over-passes and cloverleafintersections.Leonov had added some trillions of bits of information about Ganymede to thestore of human knowledge, before it crossed the orbit of Europa. That iceboundworld, with its derelict and its dead, was on the other side of Jupiter, but itwas never far from anyone’s thoughts.Back on Earth, Dr Chang was already a hero and his countrymen had, with obviousembarrassment, acknowledged countless messages of sympathy. One had been sent inthe name of Leonov’s crew - after, Floyd gathered, considerable redrafting inMoscow. The feeling on board the ship was ambiguous - a mixture of admiration,regret, and relief. All astronauts, irrespective of their national origins,regarded themselves as citizens of space and felt a common bond, sharing eachother’s triumphs and tragedies. No one on Leonov was happy because the Chineseexpedition had met with disaster; yet at the same time, there was a muted senseof relief that the race had not gone to the swiftest.The unexpected discovery of life on Europa had added a new element to thesituation - one that was now being argued at great length both on Earth andaboard Leonov. Some exobiologists cried ‘I told you so!’, pointing out that itshould not have been such a surprise after all. As far back as the 1970s,research submarines had found teeming colonies of strange marine creaturesthriving precariously in an environment thought to be equally hostile to life -the trenches on the bed of the Pacific. Volcanic springs, fertilizing andwarming the abyss, had created oases of life in the deserts of the deep.Anything that had happened once on Earth should be expected millions of timeselsewhere in the Universe; that was almost an article of faith among scientists.Water - or at least ice - occurred on all the moons of Jupiter. And there werecontinuously erupting volcanoes on Io - so it was reasonable to expect weakeractivity on the world next door. Putting these two facts together made Europanlife seem not only possible, but inevitable - as most of nature’s surprises are,when viewed with 20/20 hindsight.Yet that conclusion raised another question, and one vital to Leonov’s mission.Now that life had been discovered on the moons of Jupiter - did it have anyconnection with the Tycho monolith, and the still more mysterious artifact inorbit near Io?That was a favourite subject to debate in the Six O’Clock Soviets. It wasgenerally agreed that the creature encountered by Dr Chang did not represent ahigh form of intelligence - at least, if his interpretation of its behaviour wascorrect. No animal with even elementary powers of reasoning would have alloweditself to become a victim of its instincts, attracted like a moth to the candleuntil it risked destruction.Vasili Orlov was quick to give a counter-example that weakened, if it did notrefute, that argument.‘Look at whales and dolphins,’ he said. ‘We call them intelligent - but howoften they kill themselves in mass strandings! That looks like a case whereinstinct overpowers reason.’‘No need to go to the dolphins,’ interjected Max Brailovsky. ‘One of thebrightest engineers in my class was fatally attracted to a blonde in Kiev. WhenI heard of him last, he was working in a garage. And he’d won a gold medal fordesigning spacestations. What a waste!’Even if Dr Chang’s Europan was intelligent, that of course did not rule outhigher forms elsewhere. The biology of a whole world could not be judged from asingle specimen.But it had been widely argued that advanced intelligence could never arise inthe sea; there were not enough challenges in so benign and unvarying anenvironment. Above all, how could marine creatures ever develop a technologywithout the aid of fire?Yet perhaps even that was possible; the route that humanity had taken was notthe only one. There might be whole civilizations in the seas of other worlds.Still, it seemed unlikely that a space-faring culture could have arisen onEuropa without leaving unmistakable signs of its existence in the form ofbuildings, scientific installations, launching sites, or other artifacts. Butfrom pole to pole, nothing could be seen but level ice and a few outcroppings ofbare rock.No time remained for speculations and discussions when Leonov hurtled past theorbits of Io and tiny Mimas. The crew was busy almost non-stop, preparing forthe encounter and the brief onset of weight after months in free-fall. All looseobjects had to be secured before the ship entered Jupiter’s atmosphere, and thedrag of deceleration produced momentary peaks that might be as high as twogravities.Floyd was lucky; he alone had time to admire the superb spectacle of theapproaching planet, now filling almost half the sky. Because there was nothingto give it scale, there was no way that the mind could grasp its real size. Hehad to keep telling himself that fifty Earths would not cover the hemisphere nowturned toward him.The clouds, colourful as the most garish sunset on Earth, raced so swiftly thathe could see appreciable movement in as little as ten minutes. Great eddies werecontinually forming along the dozen or so bands that girdled the planet, thenrippling away like swirls of smoke. Plumes of white gas occasionally geysered upfrom the depths, to be swept away by the gales caused by the planet’s tremendousspin. And perhaps strangest of all were the white spots, sometimes spaced asregularly as pearls on a necklace, which lay along the tradewinds of the middleJovian latitudes.In the hours immediately before encounter, Floyd saw little of captain ornavigator. The Orlovs scarcely left the bridge, as they continually checked theapproach orbit and made minute refinements to Leonov’s course. The ship was nowon the critical path that would just graze the outer atmosphere; if it went toohigh, frictional braking would not be sufficient to slow it down, and it wouldgo racing out of the Solar System, beyond all possibility of rescue. If it wenttoo low, it would burn up like a meteor. Between the two extremes lay littlemargin for error.The Chinese had proved that aerobraking could be done, but there was always thechance that something would go wrong: So Floyd was not at all surprised whenSurgeon-Commander Rudenko admitted, just an hour before contact: ‘I’m beginningto wish, Woody, that I had brought along that icon, after all.’"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWO14"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWODOUBLE ENCOUNTER‘… papers for the mortgage on the Nantucket house should be in the file marked Min the library.‘Well, that’s all the business I can think of. For the last couple of hours I’vebeen recalling a picture I saw as a boy, in a tattered volume of Victorian art -it must have been almost one hundred and fifty years old. I can’t rememberwhether it was black-and-white or colour. But I’ll never forget the title -don’t laugh - it was called “The Last Message Home”. Ourgreat-great-grandfathers loved that kind of sentimental melodrama.‘It shows the deck of a windjammer in a hurricane - the sails have been rippedaway and the deck’s awash. In the background, the crew is struggling to save theship. And in the foreground, a young sailor boy’s writing a note, while besidehim is the bottle he hopes will carry it to land.‘Even though I was a kid at the time, I felt he should have been giving hisshipmates a hand, not writing letters. All the same, it moved me: I neverthought that one day I’d be like that young sailor.‘Of course, I’m sure you’ll get this message-and there’s nothing I can do tohelp aboard Leonov. In fact, I’ve been politely requested to keep out of theway, so my conscience is quite clear as I dictate this.‘I’ll send it up to the bridge now because in fifteen minutes we’ll breaktransmission as we pull in the big dish and batten down the hatches - there’sanother nice maritime analogy for you! Jupiter’s filling the sky now - I won’tattempt to describe it and won’t even see it much longer because the shutterswill go up in a few minutes. Anyway, the cameras can do far better than I could.‘Goodbye, my dearest, and my love to you all - especially Chris. By the time youget this, it will be over, one way or the other. Remember I tried to do my bestfor all our sakes - goodbye.’When he had removed the audio chip, Floyd drifted up to the communicationscentre and handed it over to Sasha Kovalev.‘Please make sure it gets off before we close down,’ he said earnestly.‘Don’t worry,’ promised Sasha. ‘I’m still working on all channels, and we have agood ten minutes left.’He held out his hand. ‘If we do meet again, why, we shall smile! If not, whythen, this parting was well made.’ Floyd blinked.‘Shakespeare, I suppose?’‘Of course; Brutus and Cassius before battle. See you later.’Tanya and Vasili were too intent upon their situation displays to do more thanwave to Floyd, and he retreated to his cabin. He had already said farewell tothe rest of the crew; there was nothing to do but wait. His sleeping bag wasslung in preparation for the return of gravity when deceleration commenced, andhe had only to climb into it - ‘Antennas retracted, all protective shields up,’said the intercom speaker. ‘We should feel first braking in five minutes.Everything normal.’‘That’s hardly the word I’d use,’ Floyd muttered to himself. ‘I think you mean“nominal”.’ He had barely concluded the thought when there was a diffident knockon the door.‘Kto tam?’To his astonishment, it was Zenia.‘Do you mind if I come in?’ she asked awkwardly, in a small-girl voice whichFloyd could scarcely recognize.‘Of course not. But why aren’t you in your own cubicle? It’s only five minutesto re-entry.’Even as he asked the question, he was aware of its foolishness. The answer wasso perfectly obvious that Zenia did not deign to reply.But Zenia was the very last person he would have expected: her attitude towardhim had invariably been polite but distant. Indeed, she was the only member ofthe crew who preferred to call him Dr Floyd. Yet there she was, clearly seekingcomfort and companionship at the moment of peril.‘Zenia, my dear,’ he said wryly. ‘You’re welcome. But my accommodation issomewhat limited. One might even call it Spartan.’She managed a faint smile, but said nothing as she floated into the room. Forthe first time, Floyd realized that she was not merely nervous - she wasterrified. Then he understood why she had come to him. She was ashamed to faceher countrymen and was looking for support elsewhere.With this realization, his pleasure at the unexpected encounter abated somewhat.That did not lessen his responsibility to another lonely human being, a long wayfrom home. The fact that she was an attractive - though certainly not beautiful- woman of barely half his own age should not have affected the issue. But itdid; he was beginning to rise to the occasion.She must have noticed, but did nothing to encourage or discourage him as theylay down side by side in the sleeping cocoon. There was just enough room forthem both, and Floyd began to do some anxious calculations. Suppose maximum geewas higher than predicted, and the suspension gave way? They could easily bekilled…There was an ample safety margin; no need to worry about such an ignominiousend. Humour was the enemy of desire; their embrace was now completely chaste. Hewas not sure whether to be glad or sorry.And it was too late for second thoughts. From far, far away came the first faintwhisper of sound, like the wailing of some lost soul. At the same moment, theship gave a barely perceptible jerk; the cocoon began to swing around and itssuspension tightened. After weeks of weightlessness, gravity was returning.Within seconds, the faint wail had risen to a steady roar, and the cocoon hadbecome an overloaded hammock. This is not such a good idea, Floyd thought tohimself, already it was difficult to breathe. The deceleration was only a partof the problem: Zenia was clutching him as a drowning person is supposed toclutch the proverbial straw.He detached her as gently as he could.‘It’s all right, Zenia. If Tsien did it, so can we. Relax - don’t worry.’It was difficult to shout tenderly, and he was not even sure if Zenia heard himabove the roar of incandescent hydrogen. But she was no longer clutching himquite so desperately, and he seized the opportunity of taking a few deepbreaths.What would Caroline think if she could see him now? Would he tell her if he everhad the chance? He was not sure she would understand. At a moment like that, alllinks with Earth seemed very tenuous indeed.It was impossible to move, or to speak, but now that he had grown accustomed tothe strange sense of weight he was no longer uncomfortable - except for theincreasing numbness in his right arm. With some difficulty, he managed toextricate it from beneath Zenia; the familiar act brought a fleeting sense ofguilt. As he felt his circulation returning, Floyd remembered a famous remarkattributed to at least a dozen astronauts and cosmonauts: ‘Both the pleasuresand problems of zero-gravity sex have been greatly exaggerated.’He wondered how the rest of the crew was faring, and he gave a momentary thoughtto Chandra and Curnow, sleeping peacefully through it all. They would never knowif Leonov became a meteor shower in the Jovian sky. He did not envy them; theyhad missed the experience of a lifetime.Tanya was speaking over the intercom; her words were lost in the roar, but hervoice sounded calm and perfectly normal, just as if she was making a routineannouncement. Floyd managed to glance at his watch, and was astonished to seethat they were already at the midpoint of the braking manoeuvre. At that verymoment, Leonov was at its closest approach to Jupiter; only expendable automaticprobes had gone deeper into the Jovian atmosphere.‘Halfway through, Zenia,’ he shouted. ‘On the way out again.’ He could not tellif she understood. Her eyes were tightly closed, but she smiled slightly.The ship was now rocking noticeably, like a small boat in a choppy sea. Was thatnormal? wondered Floyd. He was glad that he had Zenia to worry about; it tookhis mind away from his own fears. Just for a moment, before he managed to expelthe thought, he had a vision of the walls suddenly glowing cherry red, andcaving in upon him. Like the nightmare fantasy of Edgar Allan Poe’s ‘The Pit andthe Pendulum’, which he’d forgotten for thirty years.But that would never happen. If the heat shield failed, the ship would crumbleinstantly, hammered flat by a solid wall of gas. There would be no pain; hisnervous system would not have time to react before it ceased to exist. He hadexperienced more consoling thoughts, but this one was not to be despised.The buffeting slowly weakened. There was another inaudible announcement fromTanya (he would pull her leg about that, when it was all over). Now time seemedto be going much more slowly; after a while he stopped looking at his watch,because he could not believe it. The digits changed so slowly that he couldalmost imagine himself in some Einsteinian time dilation.And then something even more unbelievable happened. First he was amused, thenslightly indignant. Zenia had fallen asleep - if not exactly in his arms, thenat least beside them.It was a natural reaction: the strain must have exhausted her, and the wisdom ofthe body had come to her rescue. And suddenly Floyd himself became aware of analmost post-orgasmic drowsiness, as if he too had been emotionally drained bythe encounter. He had to fight to remain awake.And then he was falling… falling… falling… it was all over. The ship was back inspace, where it belonged. And he and Zenia were floating apart.They would never again be so close together, but they would always know aspecial tenderness toward each other, which no one else could ever share."},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWO15"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWOESCAPE FROM THE GIANTWhen Floyd reached the observation deck - a discreet few minutes after Zenia -Jupiter already seemed farther away. But that must be an illusion based on hisknowledge, not the evidence of his eyes. They had barely emerged from the Jovianatmosphere, and the planet still filled half the sky.And now they were - as intended - its prisoners. During the last incandescenthour, they had deliberately jettisoned the excess speed that could have carriedthem right out of the Solar System, and on to the stars. Now they weretravelling in an ellipse - a classical Hohmann orbit - which would shuttle themback between Jupiter and the orbit of Io, 350,000 kilometres higher. If they didnot - or could not - fire their motors again, Leonov would swing back and forthbetween these limits, completing one revolution every nineteen hours. It wouldbecome the closest of Jupiter’s moons - though not for long. Each time it grazedthe atmosphere it would lose altitude, until it spiralled into destruction.Floyd had never really enjoyed vodka, but he joined the others without anyreservations in drinking a triumphant toast to the ship’s designers, coupledwith a vote of thanks to Sir Isaac Newton. Then Tanya put the bottle firmly backin its cupboard; there was still much to be done.Though they were all expecting it, everyone jumped at the sudden muffled thud ofexplosive charges, and the jolt of separation. A few seconds later, a large,still-glowing disk floated into view, slowly turning end-over-end as it driftedaway from the ship.‘Look!’ cried Max. ‘A flying saucer! Who’s got a camera?’ There was a distinctnote of hysterical relief in the laughter that followed. It was interrupted bythe captain, in a more serious vein.‘Goodbye, faithful heat shield! You did a wonderful job.’‘But what a waste!’ said Sasha. ‘There’s at least a couple of tons left, Thinkof all the extra payload we could have carried!’‘If that’s good, conservative Russian engineering,’ retorted Floyd, ‘then I’mall for it. Far better a few tons too much - than one milligram too little.’Everyone applauded those noble sentiments as the jetti soned shield cooled toyellow, then red, and finally became as black as the space around it. Itvanished from sight while only a few kilometres away, though occasionally thesudden reappearance of an eclipsed star would betray its presence.‘Preliminary orbit check completed,’ said Vasili. ‘We’re within ten metres asecond of our right vector. Not bad for a first try.’There was a subdued sigh of relief at the news, and a few minutes later Vasilimade another announcement.‘Changing attitude for course correction; delta vee six metres a second.Twenty-second burn coming up in one minute.’They were still so close to Jupiter it was impossible to believe that the shipwas orbiting the planet; they might have been in a high-flying aircraft that hadjust emerged from a sea of clouds. There was no sense of scale; it was easy toimagine that they were speeding away from some terrestrial sunset; the reds andpinks and crimsons sliding below were so familiar.And that was an illusion; nothing here had any parallels with Earth. Thosecolours were intrinsic, not borrowed from the setting sun. The very gases wereutterly alien - methane and ammonia and a witch’s brew of hydrocarbons, stirredin a hydrogen-helium cauldron. Not one trace of free oxygen, the breath of humanlife.The clouds marched from horizon to horizon in parallel rows, distorted byoccasional swirls and eddies. Here and there upwellings of brighter gas brokethe pattern, and Floyd could also see the dark rim of a great whirlpool, amaelstrom of gas leading down into unfathomable Jovian depths.He began to look for the Great Red Spot, then quickly checked himself at such afoolish thought. All the enormous cloudscape he could see below would be only afew per cent of the Red Spot’s immensity; one might as well expect to recognizethe shape of the United States from a small aeroplane flying low above Kansas.‘Correction completed. We’re now on interception orbit with Io. Arrival time:eight hours, fifty-five minutes.’Less than nine hours to climb up from Jupiter and meet whatever is waiting forus, thought Floyd. We’ve escaped from the giant - but he represents a danger weunderstood, and could prepare for. What lies ahead now is utter mystery.And when we have survived that challenge, we must return to Jupiter once again.We shall need his strength to send us safely home."},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWO16"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWOPRIVATE LINE‘… Hello, Dimitri.

If it’s solid, itmust weigh billions of tons.‘But is it solid? It gives almost no radar echo, even when it’s square-on to us.We can see it only as a black silhouette against the clouds of Jupiter, threehundred thousand kilometres below. Apart from its size, it looks exactly likethe monolith we dug up on the Moon.‘Well, tomorrow we’ll go aboard Discovery, and I don’t know when I’ll have timeor opportunity to speak to you again. But there’s one more thing, old friend,before I sign off.‘It’s Caroline. She’s never really understood why I had to leave Earth, and in away I don’t think she’ll ever quite forgive me. Some women believe, that loveisn’t the only thing - but everything. Perhaps they’re right… anyway, it’scertainly too late to argue now.‘Try and cheer her up when you have a chance. She talks about going back to themainland. I’m afraid that if she does…‘If you can’t get through to her, try to cheer up Chris. I miss him more than Icare to say.‘He’ll believe Uncle Dimitri - if you say that his father still loves him, andwill be coming home just as quickly as he can.’"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWO17"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWOBOARDING PARTYEven in the best of circumstances, it is not easy to board a derelict anduncooperative spaceship. Indeed, it can be positively dangerous.Walter Curnow knew that as an abstract principle; but he did not really feel itin his bones until he saw the entire hundred-metre length of Discovery turningend-over-end, while Leonov kept at a safe distance. Years ago, friction hadbraked the spin of Discovery’s carousel, thus transferring its angular momentumto the rest of the structure. Now, like a drum-majorette’s baton at the heightof its trajectory, the abandoned ship was slowly tumbling along its orbit.The first problem was to stop that spin, which made Discovery not onlyuncontrollable but almost unapproachable. As he suited up in the airlock withMax Brailovsky, Curnow had a very rare sensation of incompetence, eveninferiority; it was not his line of business. He had already explained gloomily,‘I’m a space engineer, not a space monkey’; but the job had to be done. He alonepossessed the skills that could save Discovery from Io’s grasp. Max and hiscolleagues, working with unfamiliar circuit diagrams and equipment, would takefar too long. By the time they had restored power to the ship and mastered itscontrols, it would have plunged into the sulphurous firepits below.‘You’re not scared, are you?’ asked Max, when they were about to put on theirhelmets.‘Not enough to make a mess in my suit. Otherwise, yes.’ Max chuckled. ‘I’d saythat’s about right for this job. But don’t worry - I’ll get you there in onepiece, with my - what do you call it?’‘Broomstick. Because witches are supposed to ride them.’‘Oh yes. Have you ever used one?’‘I tried once, but mine got away from me. Everyone else thought it was veryfunny.’There are some professions which have evolved unique and characteristic tools -the longshoreman’s hook, the potter’s wheel, the bricklayer’s trowel, thegeologist’s hammer. The men who had to spend much of their time on zero-gravityconstruction projects had developed the broomstick.It was very simple - a hollow tube just a metre long, with a footpad at one endand a retaining loop at the other. At the touch of a button, it could telescopeout to five or six times its normal length, and the internal shock-absorbingsystem allowed a skilled operator to perform the most amazing manoeuvres. Thefootpad could also become a claw or hook if necessary; there were many otherrefinements, but that was the basic design. It looked deceptively easy to use;it wasn’t.The airlock pumps finished recycling; the EXIT sign came on; the outer doorsopened, and they drifted slowly into the void.Discovery was windmilling about two hundred metres away, following them in orbitaround Io, which filled half the sky. Jupiter was invisible, on the other sideof the satellite. This was a matter of deliberate choice; they were using Io asa shield to protect them from the energies raging back and forth in theflux-tube that linked the two worlds. Even so, the radiation level wasdangerously high; they had less than fifteen minutes before they must get backto shelter.Almost immediately, Curnow had a problem with his suit. ‘It fitted me when Ileft Earth,’ he complained. ‘But now I’m rattling around inside like a pea in apod.’‘That’s perfectly normal, Walter,’ said Surgeon-Commander Rudenko, breaking intothe radio circuit. ‘You lost ten kilos in hibernation, which you could very wellafford to miss. And you’ve already put three of them back.’Before Curnow had time to think of a suitable retort, he found himself gentlybut firmly jerked away from Leonov.‘Just relax, Walter,’ said Brailovsky. ‘Don’t use your thrusters, even if youstart tumbling. Let me do all the work.’Curnow could see the faint puffs from the younger man’s backpack, as its tinyjets drove them toward Discovery. With each little cloud of vapour there came agentle tug on the towline, and he would start moving toward Brailovsky; but henever caught up with him before the next puff came. He felt rather like a yo-yo- now making one of its periodic comebacks on Earth - bouncing up and down onits string.There was only one safe way to approach the derelict, and that was along theaxis around which it was slowly revolving. Discovery’s centre of rotation wasapproximately amidships, near the main antenna complex, and Brailovsky washeading directly toward this area, with his anxious partner in tow. How will hestop both of us in time? Curnow asked himself.Discovery was now a huge, slender dumbbell slowly flailing the entire sky aheadof them. Though it took several minutes to complete one revolution, the far endswere moving at an impressive speed. Curnow tried to ignore them, andconcentrated on the approaching - and immobile - centre.‘I’m aiming for that,’ said Brailovsky. ‘Don’t try to help, and don’t besurprised at anything that happens.’Now, what does he mean by that? Curnow asked himself, while preparing to be asunsurprised as possible.Everything happened in about five seconds. Brailovsky triggered his broomstick,so that it telescoped out to its full length of four metres and made contactwith the approaching ship. The broomstick started to collapse, its internalspring absorbing Brailovsky’s considerable momentum; but it did not, as Curnowhad fully expected, bring him to rest beside the antenna mount. It immediatelyexpanded again, reversing the Russian’s velocity so that he was, in effect,reflected away from Discovery just as rapidly as he had approached. He flashedpast Curnow, heading out into space again, only a few centimetres away. Thestartled American just had time to glimpse a large grin before Brailovsky shotpast him.A second later, there was a jerk on the line connecting them, and a quick surgeof deceleration as they shared momentum. Their opposing velocities had beenneatly cancelled; they were virtually at rest with respect to Discovery. Curnowhad merely to reach out to the nearest handhold, and drag them both in.‘Have you ever tried Russian roulette?’ he asked, when he had got his breathback.‘No - what is it?’‘I must teach you sometime. It’s almost as good as this for curing boredom.’‘I hope you’re not suggesting, Walter, that Max would do anything dangerous?’Dr Rudenko sounded as if she was genuinely shocked, and Curnow decided it wasbest not to answer; sometimes the Russians did not understand his peculiar senseof humour. ‘You could have fooled me,’ he muttered under his breath, not loudenough for her to hear.Now that they were firmly attached to the hub of the windmilling ship, he was nolonger conscious of its rotation - especially when he fixed his gaze upon themetal plates immediately before his eyes. The ladder stretching away into thedistance, running along the slender cylinder that was Discovery’s mainstructure, was his next objective. The spherical command module at its far endseemed several light-years away, though he knew perfectly well that the distancewas only fifty metres.‘I’ll go first,’ said Brailovsky, reeling in the slack on the line linking themtogether. ‘Remember - it’s downhill all the way from here. But that’s no problem- you can hold on with one hand. Even at the bottom, gravity’s only about atenth gee. And that’s - what do you say? - chickenshit.’‘I think you mean chickenfeed. And if it’s all the same to you, I’m going feetfirst. I never liked crawling down ladders the wrong way up - even in fractionalgravity.’It was essential, Curnow was very well aware, to keep up this gently banteringtone; otherwise he would be simply overwhelmed by the mystery and danger of thesituation. There he was, almost a billion kilometres from home, about to enterthe most famous derelict in the entire history of space exploration; a mediareporter had once called Discovery the Marie Celeste of space, and that was nota bad analogy. But there was also much that made his situation unique; even ifhe tried to ignore the nightmare moonscape filling half the sky, there was aconstant reminder of its presence at hand. Every time he touched the rungs ofthe ladder, his glove dislodged a thin mist of sulphur dust.Brailovsky, of course, was quite correct; the rotational gravity caused by theship’s end-over-end tumbling was easily countered. As he grew used to it, Curnoweven welcomed the sense of direction it gave him.And then, quite suddenly, they had reached the big, discoloured sphere ofDiscovery’s control and life-support module. Only a few metres away was anemergency hatch - the very one, Curnow realized, that Bowman had entered for hisfinal confrontation with Hal.‘Hope we can get in,’ muttered Brailovsky. ‘Pity to come all this way and findthe door locked.’He scraped away the sulphur obscuring the AIRLOCK STATUS display panel.‘Dead, of course. Shall I try the controls?’‘Won’t do any harm - but nothing will happen.’‘You’re right. Well, here goes with manual…It was fascinating to watch the narrow hairline open in the curved wall, and tonote the little puff of vapour dispersing into space, carrying with it a scrapof paper. Was that some vital message? They would never know; it spun away,tumbling end over end without losing any of its initial spin as it disappearedagainst the stars.Brailovsky kept turning the manual control for what seemed a very long time,before the dark, uninviting cave of the airlock was completely open. Curnow hadhoped that the emergency lights, at least, might still be operating. No suchluck.‘You’re boss now, Walter. Welcome to US territory.’It certainly did not look very welcoming as he clambered inside, flashing thebeam of his helmet light around the interior. As far as Curnow could tell,everything was in good order. What else had he expected? he asked himself, halfangrily.Closing the door manually took even longer than opening it, but there was noalternative until the ship was powered up again. Just before the hatch wassealed, Curnow risked a glance at the insane panorama outside.A flickering blue lake had opened up near the equator; he was sure it had notbeen there a few hours earlier. Brilliant yellow flares, the characteristiccolour of glowing sodium, were dancing along its edges; and the whole of thenightland was veiled in the ghostly plasma discharge of one of Io’s almostcontinuous auroras.It was the stuff of future nightmares - and as if that was not sufficient, therewas one further touch worthy of a mad surrealist artist. Stabbing up into theblack sky, apparently emerging directly from the firepits of the burning moon,was an immense, curving horn, such as a doomed bullfighter might have glimpsedin the final moment of truth.The crescent of Jupiter was rising to greet Discovery and Leonov as they swepttoward it along their common orbit."},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWO18"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWOSALVAGEThe moment that the outer hatch had closed behind them, there had been a subtlereversal of roles. Curnow was at home now, while Brailovsky was out of hiselement, feeling ill at ease in the labyrinth of pitch-black corridors andtunnels that was Discovery’s interior. In theory, Max knew his way round theship, but that knowledge was based only on a study of its design drawings.Curnow, on the other hand, had spent months working in Discovery’s stilluncompleted identical twin; he could, quite literally, find his way aroundblindfolded.Progress was made difficult because that part of the ship was designed for zerogee; now the uncontrolled spin provided an artificial gravity, which, slightthough it was, always seemed to be in the most inconvenient direction.‘First thing we’ve got to do,’ muttered Curnow, after sliding several metresdown a corridor before he could grab a handhold, ‘is to stop this damned spin.And we can’t do that until we have power. I only hope that Dave Bowmansafeguarded all systems before he abandoned ship.’‘Are you sure he did abandon the ship? He may have intended to come back.’‘You may be right; I don’t suppose we’ll ever know. If he even knew himself.’They had now entered the Pod Bay - Discovery’s ’space garage’, which normallycontained three of the spherical one-man modules used for activities outside theship. Only Pod Number 3 remained; Number 1 had been lost in the mysteriousaccident that had killed Frank Poole - and Number 2 was with Dave Bowman,wherever he might be.The Pod Bay also contained two spacesuits, looking uncomfortably likedecapitated corpses as they hung helmet-less in their racks. It needed verylittle effort of the imagination - and Brailovsky’s was now working overtime -to fill them with a whole menagerie of sinister occupants.It was unfortunate, but not altogether surprising, that Curnow’s sometimesirresponsible sense of humour got the better of him at this very moment.‘Max,’ he said, in a tone of deadly seriousness, ‘whatever happens - pleasedon’t go chasing off after the ship’s cat.’For a few milliseconds, Brailovsky was thrown off guard; he almost answered: ‘Ido wish you hadn’t said that, Walter’, but checked himself in time. That wouldhave been too damning an admission of weakness; instead he replied, ‘I’d like tomeet the idiot who put that movie in our library.’‘Katerina probably did it, to test everyone’s psychological balance. Anyway, youlaughed your head off when we screened it last week.’Brailovsky was silent; Curnow’s remark was perfectly true. But that had beenback in the familiar warmth and light of Leonov, among his friends - not in apitch-black, freezing derelict, haunted by ghosts. No matter how rational onewas, it was all too easy to imagine some implacable alien beast prowling thesecorridors, seeking whom it might devour.It’s all your fault, Grandma (may the Siberian tundra lie lightly on yourbeloved bones) - I wish you hadn’t filled my mind with so many of those gruesomelegends. If I close my eyes, I can still see the hut of the Baba Yaga, standingin that forest clearing on its scrawny chicken legs…Enough of this nonsense. I’m a brilliant young engineer faced with the biggesttechnical challenge of his life, and I mustn’t let my American friend know thatI’m sometimes a frightened little boy.The noises did not help. There were too many of them, though they were so faintthat only an experienced astronaut would have detected them against the soundsof his own suit. But to Max Brailovsky, accustomed to working in an environmentof utter silence, they were distinctly unnerving, even though he knew that theoccasional cracklings and creakings were almost certainly caused by thermalexpansion as the ship turned like a roast on a spit. Feeble though the sun wasout here, there was still an appreciable temperature change between light andshade.Even his familiar spacesuit felt wrong, now that there was pressure outside aswell as in. All the forces acting on its joints were subtly altered, and hecould no longer judge his movements accurately. I’m a beginner, starting mytraining all over again, he told himself angrily. Time to break the mood by somedecisive action.‘Walter - I’d like to test the atmosphere.’‘Pressure’s okay; temperature - phew - it’s one hundred five below zero.’‘A nice bracing Russian winter. Anyway, the air in my suit will keep out theworst of the cold.’‘Well, go ahead. But let me shine my light on your face, so I can see if youstart to turn blue. And keep talking.’Brailovsky unsealed his visor and swung the faceplate upward. He flinchedmomentarily as icy fingers seemed to caress his cheeks, then took a cautioussniff, followed by a deeper breath.‘Chilly - but my lungs aren’t freezing. There’s a funny smell, though. Stale,rotten - as if something’s - oh no!’Looking suddenly pale, Brailovsky quickly snapped the faceplate shut.‘What’s the trouble, Max?’ Curnow asked with sudden and now perfectly genuineanxiety. Brailovsky did not reply; he looked as if he was still trying to regaincontrol of himself. Indeed, he seemed in real danger of that always horrible andsometimes fatal disaster - vomiting in a spacesuit.There was a long silence; then Curnow said reassuringly:‘I get it. But I’m sure you’re wrong. We know that Poole was lost in space.Bowman reported that he… ejected the others after they died in hibernation - andwe can be sure that he did. There can’t be anyone here. Besides, it’s so cold.’He almost added ‘like a morgue’ but checked himself in time.‘But’ suppose,’ whispered Brailovsky, ‘just suppose Bowman managed to get backto the ship - and died here.’There was an even longer silence before Curnow deliberately and slowly openedhis own faceplate. He winced as the freezing air bit into his lungs, thenwrinkled his nose in disgust.‘I see what you mean. But you’re letting your imagination run away with you.I’ll bet you ten to one that smell comes from the galley. Probably some meatwent bad, before the ship froze up. And Bowman must have been too busy to be agood housekeeper. I’ve known bachelor apartments that smelled as bad as this.’‘Maybe you’re right. I hope you are.’‘Of course I am. And even if I’m not - dammit, what difference does it make?We’ve got a job to do, Max. If Dave Bowman’s still here, that’s not ourdepartment - is it, Katerina?’There was no reply from the Surgeon-Commander; they had gone too far inside theship for radio to penetrate. They were indeed on their own, but Max’s spiritswere rapidly reviving. It was a privilege, he decided, to work with Walter. TheAmerican engineer sometimes appeared soft and easygoing. But he was totallycompetent - and, when necessary, as hard as nails.Together, they would bring Discovery back to life; and, perhaps, back to Earth."},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWO19"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWOOPERATION WINDMILLWhen Discovery suddenly lit up like the proverbial Christmas tree, navigationand interior lights blazing from end to end, the cheer aboard Leonov mightalmost have been heard across the vacuum between the two ships. It turned intoan ironic groan when the lights promptly went out again.Nothing else happened for half an hour; then the observation windows ofDiscovery’s flight deck began to glow with the soft crimson of the emergencylights. A few minutes later, Curnow and Brailovsky could be seen moving aroundinside, their figures blurred by the film of sulphur dust.‘Hello, Max - Walter - can you hear us?’ called Tanya Orlova. Both the figureswaved instantly, but made no other reply. Obviously, they were too busy toengage in casual conversation; the watchers on Leonov had to wait patientlywhile various lights flashed on and off, one of the three Pod Bay doors slowlyopened and quickly closed, and the main antenna slewed around a modest tendegrees.‘Hello, Leonov,’ said Curnow at last. ‘Sorry to keep you waiting, but we’ve beenrather busy.‘Here’s a quick assessment, judging from what we’ve seen so far. The ship’s inmuch better shape than I feared. Hull’s intact, leakage negligible - airpressure eighty-five per cent nominal. Quite breathable, but we’ll have to do amajor recycling job because it stinks to high heaven.‘The best news is that the power systems are okay. Main reactor stable,batteries in good shape. Almost all the circuit-breakers were open - they’djumped or been thrown by Bowman before he left - so all vital equipment’s beensafeguarded. But it will be a very big job checking everything before we havefull power again.’‘How long will that take - at least for the essential systems: life-support,propulsion?’‘Hard to say, skipper. How long before we crash?’‘Minimum present prediction is ten days. But you know how that’s changed up -and down.’‘Well, if we don’t run into any major snags, we can haul Discovery up to astable orbit away from this hellhole - oh, I’d say inside a week.’‘Anything you need?’‘No - Max and I are doing fine. We’re going into the carousel now, to check thebearings. I want to get it running as soon as possible.’‘Pardon me, Walter - but is that important? Gravity’s convenient, but we’vemanaged without any for quite a while.’‘I’m not after gravity, though it will be useful to have some aboard. If we canget the carousel running again, it will mop up the ship’s spin - stop ittumbling. Then we’ll be able to couple our airlocks together, and cut out EVAs.That will make work a hundred times easier.’‘Nice idea, Walter - but you’re not going to mate my ship to that… windmill.Suppose the bearings seize up and the carousel jams? That would tear us topieces.’‘Agreed. We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. I’ll report again as soonas I can.’No one had much rest for the next two days. By the end of that time, Curnow andBrailovsky had practically fallen asleep in their suits, but had completed theirsurvey of Discovery and found no unpleasant surprises. Both the Space Agency andthe State Department were relieved by the preliminary report; it allowed them toclaim, with some justification, that Discovery was not a derelict but a‘temporarily decommissioned United States Spacecraft’. Now the task ofreconditioning had to begin.Once power had been restored, the next problem was the air; even the mostthorough housecleaning operations had failed to remove the stink. Curnow hadbeen right in identifying its source as food spoiled when refrigeration hadfailed; he also claimed, with mock seriousness, that it was quite romantic.‘I’ve only got to close my eyes,’ he asserted, ‘and I feel I’m back on anold-time whaling ship. Can you imagine what the Pequod must have smelled like?’It was unanimously agreed that, after a visit to Discovery, very little effortof the imagination was required. The problem was finally solved - or at leastreduced to manageable proportions - by dumping the ship’s atmosphere.Fortunately, there was still enough air in the reserve tanks to replace it.One piece of very welcome news was that ninety per cent of the propellant neededfor the return journey was still available; choosing ammonia instead of hydrogenas working fluid for the plasma drive had paid off handsomely. The moreefficient hydrogen would have boiled off into space years ago, despite theinsulation of the tanks and the frigid temperature outside. But almost all theammonia had remained safely liquified, and there was enough to get the ship backto a safe orbit around the Earth. Or at least around the Moon.Checking Discovery’s propellerlike spin was perhaps the most critical step ingetting the ship under control. Sasha Kovalev compared Curnow and Brailovsky toDon Quixote and Sancho Panza, and expressed the hope that their windmill-tiltingexpedition would end more successfully.Very cautiously, with many pauses for checking, power was fed to the carouselmotors and the great drum was brought up to speed, reabsorbing the spin it hadlong ago imparted to the ship. Discovery executed a complex series ofprecessions, until eventually its end-over-end tumble had almost vanished. Thelast traces of unwanted rotation were neutralized by the attitude-control jets,until the two ships were floating motionless side by side, the squat, stockyLeonov dwarfed by the long, slender Discovery.Transfer from one to the other was now safe and easy, but Captain Orlova stillrefused to permit a physical linkup. Everyone agreed with this decision, for Iowas coming steadily closer; they might yet have to abandon the vessel they hadworked so hard to save.The fact that they now knew the reason for Discovery’s mysterious orbital decaydid not help in the least. Every time the ship passed between Jupiter and Io, itsliced through the invisible flux-tube linking the two bodies - the electricriver flowing from world to world. The resulting eddy currents induced in theship were continually slowing it down, braking it once every revolution.There was no way to predict the final moment of impact, for the current in theflux-tube varied wildly according to Jupiter’s own inscrutable laws. Sometimesthere were dramatic surges of activity accompanied by spectacular electric andauroral storms around Io. Then the ships would lose altitude by many kilometres,at the same time becoming uncomfortably hot before their thermal control systemscould readjust.This unexpected effect had scared and surprised everyone before the obviousexplanation was realized. Any form of braking produces heat, somewhere; theheavy currents induced in the hulls of Leonov and Discovery turned them brieflyinto low-powered electric furnaces. It was not surprising that some ofDiscovery’s food supply had been ruined during the years the ship had beenalternately cooked and cooled.The festering landscape of Io, looking more than ever like an illustration froma medical textbook, was only five hundred kilometres away when Curnow riskedactivating the main drive, while Leonov stood off at a very respectful distance.There were no visible effects - none of the smoke and fire of the old-timechemical rockets - but the two ships drew slowly apart as Discovery gainedspeed. After a few hours of very gentle manoeuvring, both ships had raisedthemselves a thousand kilometres; now there was time to relax briefly, and tomake plans for the next stage in the mission.‘You’ve done a wonderful job, Walter,’ said Surgeon-Commander Rudenko, puttingher ample arm around the exhausted Curnow’s shoulders. ‘We’re all proud of you.’Very casually, she broke a small capsule under his nose. It was twenty-fourhours before he woke up, annoyed and hungry."},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWO20"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWOGUILLOTINE‘What is it?’ asked Curnow with mild distaste, hefting the little mechanism inhis hand. ‘A guillotine for mice?’‘Not a bad description - but I’m after bigger game.’ Floyd pointed to a flashingarrow on the display screen, which was now showing a complicated circuitdiagram.‘You see this line?’‘Yes - the main power supply. So?’‘This is the point where it enters Hal’s central processing unit. I’d like youto install this gadget here. Inside the cable trunking, where it can’t be foundwithout a deliberate search.’‘I see. A remote control, so you can pull the plug on Hal whenever you want to.Very neat - and a non-conducting blade, too, so there won’t be any embarrassingshorts when it’s triggered. Who makes toys like this? The CIA?’‘Never mind. The control’s in my room - that little red calculator I always keepon my desk. Put in nine nines, take the square root, and press TNT. That’s all.I’m not sure of its range - we’ll have to test that - but as long as Leonov andDiscovery are within a couple of kilometres of each other, there’ll be no dangerof Hal running amok again.’‘Who are you going to tell about this… thing?’‘Well, the only person I’m really hiding it from is Chandra.’‘I guessed as much.’‘But the fewer who know, the less likely it is to be talked about. I’ll tellTanya that it exists, and if there’s an emergency you can show her how tooperate it.’‘What kind of emergency?’‘That’s not a very bright question, Walter. If I knew, I wouldn’t need the damnthing.’‘Guess you’re right. When do you want me to install your patented Hal-zapper?’‘As soon as you can. Preferably tonight. When Chandra’s sleeping.’‘Are you kidding? I don’t think he ever sleeps. He’s like a mother nursing asick baby.’‘Well, he’s got to come back to Leonov to eat, occasionally.’‘I’ve news for you. The last time he went across, he tied a little sack of riceto his suit. That will keep him going for weeks.’‘Then we’ll have to use one of Katerina’s famous knockout drops. They did apretty good job on you, didn’t they?’Curnow was joking about Chandra - at least, Floyd assumed that he was, thoughone could never be quite sure: he was fond of making outrageous statements witha perfectly straight face. It had been some time before the Russians had fullyrealized that; soon, in self-defence, they were prone to pre-emptive laughs evenwhen Curnow was being perfectly serious.Curnow’s own laugh, mercifully, had much abated since Floyd had first heard itin the upward-bound shuttle; on that occasion, it had obviously been primed byalcohol. He had fully expected to cringe from it again at the end-of-orbitparty, when Leonov had finally made rendezvous with Discovery. But even on thatoccasion, though Curnow had drunk a good deal, he had remained as much undercontrol as Captain Orlova herself.The one thing he did take seriously was his work. On the way up from Earth, hehad been a passenger. Now he was crew."},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWO21"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWORESURRECTIONWe are, Floyd told himself, about to awaken a sleeping giant. How will Hal reactto our presence, after all these years? What will he remember of the past - andwill he be friendly, or hostile?As he floated just behind Dr Chandra in the zero-gravity environment ofDiscovery’s flight deck, Floyd’s mind was seldom far from the cut-off switch,installed and tested only a few hours earlier. The radio control was merecentimetres from his hand, and he felt somewhat foolish to have brought it withhim. At this stage, Hal was still disconnected from all the ship’s operationalcircuits. Even if he was reactivated, he would be a brain without limbs thoughnot without sense organs. He would be able to communicate, but not to act. AsCurnow had put it, ‘The worst he can do is swear at us.’‘I’m ready for the first test, Captain,’ said Chandra. ‘All the missing moduleshave been replaced, and I’ve run diagnostic programs on all circuits. Everythingappears normal, at least on this level.’Captain Orlova glanced at Floyd, who gave a nod. At Chandra’s insistence, onlythe three of them were present for this critical first run, and it was quiteobvious that even this small audience was unwelcome.‘Very well, Dr Chandra.’ Ever conscious of protocol, the captain added quickly:‘Dr Floyd has given his approval, and I have no objections myself.’‘I should explain,’ said Chandra, in a tone that clearly conveyed disapproval,‘that his voice-recognition and speech-synthesis centres have been damaged.We’ll have to teach him to speak all over again. Luckily, he learns severalmillion times faster than a human being.’The scientist’s fingers danced over the keyboard as he typed out a dozen words,apparently at random, carefully pronouncing each one as it appeared on thescreen. Like a distorted echo, the words came back from the speaker grille -lifeless, indeed mechanical, with no sense of any intelligence behind them. Thisisn’t the old Hal, thought Floyd. It’s no better than the primitive speakingtoys that were such a novelty when I was a kid.Chandra pressed the REPEAT button, and the series of words sounded once again.Already, there was a noticeable improvement, though no one could have mistakenthe speaker for a human being.‘The words I gave him contain the basic English phonemes; about ten iterations,and he’ll be acceptable. But I don’t have the equipment to do a really good jobof therapy.’‘Therapy?’ asked Floyd. ‘You mean that ‘he’s - well, brain-damaged?’‘No,’ snapped Chandra. ‘The logic circuits are in perfect condition. Only thevoice output may be defective, though it will improve steadily. So checkeverything against the visual display, to avoid misinterpretations. And when youdo speak, enunciate carefully.’Floyd gave Captain Orlova a wry smile, and asked the obvious question.‘What about all the Russian accents around here?’‘I’m sure that won’t be a problem with Captain Orlova and Dr Kovalev. But withthe others - well, we’ll have to run individual tests. Anyone who can’t passwill have to use the keyboard.’‘That’s still looking a long way ahead. For the present, you’re the only personwho should attempt communication. Agreed, Captain?’‘Absolutely.’Only the briefest of nods revealed that Dr Chandra had heard them. His fingerscontinued to fly over the keyboard, and columns of words and symbols flashedacross the display screen at such a rate that no human being could possiblyassimilate them. Presumably Chandra had an eidetic memory, for he appeared torecognize whole pages of information at a glance.Floyd and Orlova were just about to leave the scientist to his arcane devotionswhen he suddenly acknowledged their presence again, holding up his hand inwarning or anticipation. With an almost hesitant movement, in marked contrastwith his previous swift actions, he slid back a locking bar and pressed asingle, isolated key.Instantly, with no perceptible pause, a voice came from the console, no longerin a mechanical parody of human speech. There was intelligence - consciousness -self-awareness here, though as yet only on a rudimentary level.‘Good morning, Dr Chandra, This is Hal. I am ready for my first lesson.’There was a moment of shocked silence; then, acting on the same impulse, the twoobservers left the deck.Heywood Floyd would never have believed it. Dr Chandra was crying."},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWOIVLAGRANGE"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWO22"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWOBIG BROTHER‘… What delightful news about the baby dolphin! I can just imagine how excitedChris was when the proud parents brought it into the house. You should haveheard the ohs and ahs of my shipmates when they saw the videos of them swimmingtogether, and Chris riding on its back. They suggest we call it Sputnik, whichmeans companion as well as satellite.‘Sorry it’s been quite a while since my last message, but the newscasts willhave given you an idea of the huge job we’ve had to do. Even Captain Tanya’sgiven up all pretence of a regular schedule; each problem has to be fixed as itcomes along, by whoever is on the spot. We sleep when we can’t stay awake anylonger.‘I think we can all be proud of what we’ve done. Both ships are operational andwe’ve nearly finished our first round of tests on Hal. In a couple of days we’llknow if we can trust him to fly Discovery when we leave here to make our finalrendezvous with Big Brother.‘I don’t know who first gave it that name - the Russians, understandably, aren’tkeen on it. And they’ve waxed quite sarcastic about our official designationTMA-2, pointing out to me - several times - that it’s the best part of a billionkilometres from Tycho. Also that Bowman reported no magnetic anomaly, and thatthe only resemblance to TMA-1 is the shape. When I asked them what name theypreferred, they came up with Zagadka, which means enigma. It’s certainly anexcellent name; but everyone smiles when I try to pronounce it, so I’ll stick toBig Brother.‘Whatever you call the thing, it’s only ten thousand kilometres away now, andthe trip won’t take more than a few hours. But that last lap has us all nervous,I don’t mind telling you.‘We’d hoped that we might find some new information aboard Discovery. That’sbeen our only disappointment, though we should have expected it. Hal, of course,was disconnected long before the encounter, and so has no memories of whathappened; Bowman has taken all his secrets with him. There’s nothing in theship’s log and automatic recording systems that we didn’t already know.‘The only new item we discovered was purely personal - a message that Bowman hadleft for his mother. I wonder why he never sent it; obviously, he did expect -or hope - to return to the ship after that last EVA. Of course, we’ve had itforwarded to Mrs Bowman - she’s in a nursing home, somewhere in Florida, and hermental condition is poor, so it may not mean anything to her.‘Well, that’s all the news this time. I can’t tell you how much I miss you… andthe blue skies and green seas of Earth. All the colours here are reds andoranges and yellows - often as beautiful as the most fantastic sunset, but aftera while one grows sick for the cool, pure rays at the other end of the spectrum.‘My love to you both - I’ll call again just as soon as I can.’"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWO23"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWORENDEZVOUSNikolai Temovsky, Leonov’s control and cybernetics expert, was the only manaboard who could talk to Dr Chandra on something like his own terms. AlthoughHal’s principal creator and mentor was reluctant to admit anyone into his fullconfidence, sheer physical exhaustion had forced him to accept help. Russian andIndo-American had formed a temporary alliance, which functioned surprisinglywell. Most of the credit for this went to the good-natured Nikolai, who wassomehow able to sense when Chandra really needed him, and when he preferred tobe alone. The fact that Nikolai’s English was much the worst on the ship wastotally unimportant, since most of the time both men spoke a computerese whollyunintelligible to anyone else.After a week’s slow and careful reintegration, all of Hal’s routine, supervisoryfunctions were operating reliably. He was like a man who could walk, carry outsimple orders, do unskilled jobs, and engage in low-level conversation. In humanterms, he had an Intelligence Quotient of perhaps 50; only the faintest outlinesof his original personality had yet emerged.He was still sleepwalking; nevertheless, in Chandra’s expert opinion, he was nowquite capable of flying Discovery from its close orbit around Io up to therendezvous with Big Brother.The prospect of getting an extra seven thousand kilometres away from the burninghell beneath them was welcomed by everyone. Trivial though that distance was inastronomical terms, it meant that the sky would no longet be dominated by alandscape that might have been imagined by Dante or Hieronymus Bosch. Andalthough not even the most violent eruptions had blasted any material up to theships, there was always the fear that Io might attempt to set a new record. Asit was, visibility from Leonov’s observation deck was steadily degraded by athin film of sulphur, and sooner or later someone would have to go out and cleanit off.Only Curnow and Chandra were aboard Discovery when Hal was given the firstcontrol of the ship. It was a very limited form of control; he was merelyrepeating the program that had been fed into his memory, and monitoring itsexecution. And the human crew was monitoring him: if any malfunction occurred,they would take over immediately.The first burn lasted for ten minutes; then Hal reported that Discovery hadentered the transfer orbit. As soon as Leonov’s radar and optical trackingconfirmed that, the other ship injected itself into the same trajectory. Twominor in-course corrections were made; then, three hours and fifteen minuteslater, both arrived uneventfully at the first Lagrange point, L. 1 - 10,500kilometres up, on the invisible line connecting the centres of Io and Jupiter.Hal had behaved impeccably, and Chandra showed unmistakable traces of suchpurely human emotions as satisfaction and even joy. But by that time, everyone’sthoughts were elsewhere; Big Brother, alias Zagadka, was only a hundredkilometres away.Even from that distance, it already appeared larger than the Moon as seen fromEarth, and shockingly unnatural in its straight-edged, geometrical perfection.Against the background of space it would have been completely invisible, but thescudding Jovian clouds 350,000 kilometres below showed it up in dramatic relief.They also produced an illusion that, once experienced, the mind found almostimpossible to refute. Because there was no way in which its real location couldbe judged by the eye, Big Brother often looked like a yawning trapdoor set inthe face of Jupiter.There was no reason to suppose that a hundred kilometres would be ’safer thanten, or more dangerous than a thousand; it merely seemed psychologically rightfor a first reconnaissance. From that distance, the ship’s telescopes could haverevealed details only centimetres across -but there were none to be seen. BigBrother appeared completely featureless; which, for an object that had,presumably, survived millions of years of bombardment by space debris, wasincredible.When Floyd stared through the binocular eyepiece, it seemed to him that he couldreach out and touch those smooth, ebon surfaces - just as he had done on theMoon, years ago. That first time, it had been with the gloved hand of hisspacesuit. Not until the Tycho monolith had been enclosed in a pressurized domehad he been able to use his naked hand.That had made no difference; he did not feel that he had ever really touchedTMA-1. The tips of his fingers had seemed to skitter over an invisible barrier,and the harder he pushed, the greater the repulsion grew. He wondered if BigBrother would produce the same effect.Yet before they came that close, they had to make every test they could deviseand report their observations to Earth. They were in much the same position asexplosives experts trying to defuse a new type of bomb, which might be detonatedby the slightest false move. For all that they could tell, even the mostdelicate of radar probes might trigger some unimaginable catastrophe.For the first twenty-four hours, they did nothing except observe with passiveinstruments - telescopes, cameras, sensors on every wavelength. Vasili Orlovalso took the opportunity of measuring the slab’s dimensions with the greatestpossible precision, and confirmed the famous 1:4:9 ratio to six decimal places.Big Brother was exactly the same shape as TMA-1 - but as it was more than twokilometres long, it was 718 times larger than its small sibling.And there was a second mathematical mystery. Men had been arguing for years overthat 1:4:9 ratio - the squares of the first three integers. That could notpossibly be a coincidence; now here was another number to conjure with.Back on Earth, statisticians and mathematical physicists were soon playinghappily with their computers, trying to relate the ratio to the fundamentalconstants of nature - the velocity of light, the proton/electron mass ratio, thefine-structure constant. They were quickly joined by a gaggle of numerologists,astrologers, and mystics, who threw in the height of the Great Pyramid, thediameter of Stonehenge, the azimuth bearings of the Nazca lines, the latitude ofEaster Island, and a host of other factors from which they were able to draw themost amazing conclusions about the future. They were not in the least deterredwhen a celebrated Washington humorist claimed that his calculations proved thatthe world ended on 31 December 1999 - but that everyone had had too much of ahangover to notice.Nor did Big Brother appear to notice the two ships that had arrived in itsvicinity - even when they cautiously probed it with radar beams and bombarded itwith strings of radio pulses which, it was hoped, would encourage anyintelligent listener to answer in the same fashion.After two frustrating days, with the approval of Mission Control, the shipshalved their distance. From fifty kilometres, the largest face of the slabappeared about four times the width of the Moon in Earth’s sky - impressive, butnot so large as to be psychologically overwhelming. It could not yet competewith Jupiter, ten times larger still; and already the mood of the expedition waschanging from awed alertness to a certain impatience.Walter Curnow spoke for almost everyone: ‘Big Brother may be willing to wait afew million years - we’d like to get away a little sooner.’"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWO24"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWORECONNAISSANCEDiscovery had left Earth with three of the little space pods that allowed anastronaut to perform extravehicular activities in shirt-sleeve comfort. One hadbeen lost in the accident - if it was an accident - that had killed Frank Poole.Another had carried Dave Bowman to his final appointment with Big Brother, andshared whatever fate befell him, A third was still in the ship’s garage, the PodBay.It lacked one important component - the hatch, blown off by Commander Bowmanwhen he had made his hazardous vacuum-crossing and entered the ship through theemergency airlock, after Hal had refused to open the Pod Bay door. The resultingblast of air had rocketed the pod several hundred kilometres away before Bowman,busy with more important matters, had brought it back under radio control. Itwas not surprising that he had never bothered to replace the missing hatch.Now Pod Number 3 (on which Max, refusing all explanations, had stencilled thename Nina) was being prepared for another EVA. It still lacked a hatch, but thatwas unimportant. No one would be riding inside.Bowman’s devotion to duty was a piece of unexpected luck, and it would have beenfolly not to take advantage of it. By using Nina as a robot probe, Big Brothercould be examined at close quarters without risking human lives. That at leastwas the theory; no one could rule out the possibility of a backlash that mightengulf the ship. After all, fifty kilometres was not even a hair’s breadth, ascosmic distances went.After years of neglect, Nina looked distinctly shabby. The dust that was alwaysfloating around in zero gee had settled over the outer surface, so that the onceimmaculately white hull had become a dingy grey. As it slowly accelerated awayfrom the ship, its external manipulators folded neatly back and its ovalviewport staring spaceward like a huge, dead eye, it did not seem a veryimpressive ambassador of Mankind. But that was a distinct advantage; so humblean emissary might be tolerated, and its small size and low velocity shouldemphasize its peaceful intentions. There had been a suggestion that it shouldapproach Big Brother with open hands; the idea was quickly turned down whenalmost everyone agreed that if they saw Nina heading toward them, mechanicalclaws outstretched, they would run for their lives.After a leisurely two-hour trip, Nina came to rest a hundred metres from onecorner of the huge rectangular slab. From so close at hand, there was no senseof its true shape; the TV cameras might have been looking down on the tip of ablack tetrahedron of indefinite size. The onboard instruments showed no sign ofradioactivity or magnetic fields; nothing whatsoever was coming from Big Brotherexcept the tiny fraction of sunlight it condescended to reflect.After five minutes’ pause - the equivalent, it was intended, of ‘Hello, here Iam!’ - Nina started a diagonal crossing of the smaller face, then the nextlarger, and finally the largest, keeping at a distance of about fifty metres,but occasionally coming in to five. Whatever the separation, Big Brother lookedexactly the same - smooth and featureless. Long before the mission wascompleted, it had become boring, and the spectators on both ships had gone backto their various jobs, only glancing at the monitors from time to time.‘That’s it,’ said Walter Curnow at last, when Nina had arrived back where shehad started. ‘We could spend the rest of our lives doing this, without learninganything more. What do I do with Nina - bring her home?’‘No,’ said Vasili, breaking into the circuit from aboard Leonov. ‘I’ve asuggestion. Take her to the exact centre of the big face. Bring her to rest -oh, a hundred metres away. And leave her parked there, with the radar switchedto maximum precision.’‘No problem - except that there’s bound to be some residual drift. But what’sthe point?’‘I’ve just remembered an exercise from one of my college astronomy courses - thegravitational attraction of an infinite flat plate. I never thought I’d have achance of using it in real life. After I’ve studied Nina’s movements for a fewhours, at least I’ll be able to calculate Zagadka’s mass, That is, if it hasany. I’m beginning to think there’s nothing really there.’‘There’s an easy way to settle that, and we’ll have to do it eventually. Ninamust go in and touch the thing.’‘She already has.’‘What do you mean?’ asked Curnow, rather indignantly. ‘I never got nearer thanfive metres.’‘I’m not criticizing your driving skills - though it was a pretty close thing atthat first corner, wasn’t it? But you’ve been tapping gently on Zagadka everytime you use Nina’s thrusters near its surface.’‘A flea jumping on an elephant!’‘Perhaps. We simply don’t know. But we’d better assume that, one way or another,it’s aware of our presence, and will only tolerate us as long as we aren’t anuisance.’He left the unspoken question hanging in the air. How did one annoy atwo-kilometre-long black rectangular slab? And just what form would itsdisapproval take?"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWO25"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWOTHE VIEW FROM LAGRANGEAstronomy was full of such intriguing but meaningless coincidences. The mostfamous was the fact that, from the Earth, both Sun and Moon have the sameapparent diameter. Here at the L.1 libration point, which Big Brother had chosenfor its cosmic balancing act on the gravitational tightrope between Jupiter andIo, a similar phenomenon occurred. Planet and satellite appeared exactly thesame size.And what a size! Not the miserable half-degree of Sun and Moon, but forty timestheir diameter - sixteen hundred times their area. ‘The sight of either wasenough to fill the mind with awe and wonder; together, the spectacle wasoverwhelming.Every forty-two hours, they would go through their complete cycle of phases;when Io was new, Jupiter was full, and vice versa. But even when the Sun washiding behind Jupiter and the planet presented only its nightside, it wasunmistakably there - a huge black disk eclipsing the stars. Sometimes thatblackness would be momentarily rent by lightning flashes lasting for manyseconds, from electrical storms far larger than the Earth.On the opposite side of the sky, always keeping the same face toward its giantmaster, Io would be a sluggishly boiling cauldron of reds and oranges, withoccasional yellow clouds erupting from one of its volcanoes, and falling swiftlyback to the surface. Like Jupiter, but on a slightly longer time scale, Io was aworld without geography. Its face was remodelled in a matter of decades -Jupiter’s, in a matter of days.As Io waned toward its last quarter, so the vast, intricately banded Joviancloudscape would light up beneath the tiny, distant sun. Sometimes the shadow ofIo itself, or one of the outer satellites, would drift across the face ofJupiter; while every revolution would show the planet-sized vortex of the GreatRed Spot - a hurricane that had endured for centuries if not for millennia.Poised between such wonders, the crew of Leonov had material for lifetimes ofresearch - but the natural objects of the Jovian system were at the very bottomof their list of priorities. Big Brother was Number 1; though the ships had nowmoved in to only five kilometres, Tanya still refused to allow any directphysical contact. ‘I’m going to wait,’ she said, ‘until we’re in a position tomake a quick getaway. We’ll sit and watch - until our launch window opens. Thenwe’ll consider our next move.’It was true that Nina had finally grounded on Big Brother, after a leisurelyfifty-minute fall. This had allowed Vasili to calculate the object’s mass as asurprisingly low 950,000 tons, which gave it about the density of air.Presumably it was hollow - which provoked endless speculation about what mightbe inside.But there were plenty of practical, everyday problems to take their minds offthese greater issues. Housekeeping chores aboard Leonov and Discovery absorbedninety per cent of their working time, though operations’ were much moreefficient since the two ships had been coupled by a flexible docking connection.Curnow had finally convinced Tanya that Discovery’s carousel would not suddenlyseize up and tear the ships to pieces, so it had become possible to move freelyfrom one vessel to the other merely by opening and closing two sets of airtightdoors. Spacesuits and time-consuming EVAs were no longer necessary - to thegreat delight of everyone except Max, who loved going outside and exercisingwith his broomstick.The two crew members quite unaffected by this were Chandra and Ternovsky, whonow virtually lived aboard Discovery and worked around the clock, continuingtheir apparently endless dialogue with Hal. ‘When will you be ready?’ they wereasked at least once a day. They refused to make any promises; Hal remained alow-grade moron.Then, a week after the rendezvous with Big Brother, Chandra unexpectedlyannounced: ‘We’re ready.’Only the two lady medics were absent from Discovery’s flight deck, and that wasmerely because there was no room for them; they were watching on Leonov’smonitors. Floyd stood immediately behind Chandra, his hand never far from whatCurnow, with his usual gift for the neat phrase, had called his pocketgiant-killer.‘Let me emphasize again,’ said Chandra, ‘that there must be no talking. Youraccents will confuse him; I can speak, but no one else. Is that understood?’Chandra looked, and sounded, at the edge of exhaustion. Yet his voice held anote of authority that no one had ever heard before. Tanya might be the bosseverywhere else, but he was master there.The audience - some anchored to convenient handholds, some floating freely -nodded assent. Chandra closed an audio switch and said, quietly but clearly:‘Good morning, Hal.’An instant later, it seemed to Floyd that the years had rolled away. It was nolonger a simple electronic toy that answered back. Hal had returned.‘Good morning, Dr Chandra.’‘Do you feel capable of resuming your duties?’‘Of course. I am completely operational and all my circuits are functioningperfectly.’‘Then do you mind if I ask you a few questions?’‘Not at all.’‘Do you recall a failure of the AE 35 antenna control unit?’‘Certainly not.’Despite Chandra’s injunction, there was a little gasp from the listeners. Thisis like tiptoeing through a minefield, thought Floyd, as he patted thereassuring shape of the radio cut-off. If that line of questioning triggeredanother psychosis, he could kill Hal in a second. (He knew, having rehearsed theprocedure a dozen times.) But a second was aeons to a computer; that was achance they would have to take.‘You do not remember either Dave Bowman or Frank Poole going out to replace theAE 35 unit?’‘No. That could not have happened, or I would have remembered it. Where areFrank and Dave? Who are these people? I can only identify you - though I computea sixty-five per cent probability that the man behind you is Dr Heywood Floyd.’Remembering Chandra’s strict injunction, Floyd refrained from congratulatingHal. After a decade, sixty-five per cent was a pretty good score. Many humanswould not have done so well.‘Don’t worry, Hal - I will explain everything later.’‘Has the mission been completed? You know I have the greatest enthusiasm forit.’‘The mission has been completed; you have carried out your program. Now - if youwill excuse us - we wish to have a private conversation.’‘Certainly.’Chandra switched off sound and vision inputs to the main console. As far as thispart of the ship was concerned, Hal was now deaf and blind.‘Well, what was all that about?’ demanded Vasili Orlov.‘It means,’ said Chandra, carefully and precisely, ‘that I have erased all Hal’smemories, beginning at the moment when the trouble started.’‘That sounds quite a feat,’ marvelled Sasha. ‘How did you do it?’‘I am afraid it would take me longer to explain than it did to carry out theoperation.’‘Chandra, I am a computer expert - though not in the same class as you andNikolai. The 9000 series uses holographic memories, doesn’t it? So you couldn’thave used a simple chronological erasure. It must have been some kind oftapeworm, homing on selected words and concepts?’‘Tapeworm?’ said Katerina over the ship’s intercom. ‘I thought that was mydepartment - though I’m glad to say I’ve never seen one of the beastly thingsoutside a jar of alcohol. What are you talking about?’‘Computer jargon, Katerina. In the old days - the very old days - they reallydid use magnetic tape. And it’s possible to construct a program that can be fedinto a system to hunt down and destroy - eat, if you like - any desiredmemories. ‘Can’t you do the same sort of thing to human beings, by hypnosis?’‘Yes, but it can always be reversed. We never really forget anything. We onlythink we do.’‘A computer doesn’t work that way. When it’s told to forget something, it does.The information is completely erased.’‘So Hal has absolutely no memory of his… misbehaviour?’‘I cannot be a hundred per cent certain of that,’ answered Chandra. ‘There maybe some memories that were in transit from one address to another when the…tapeworm was making its search. But this is very unlikely.’‘Fascinating,’ said Tanya, after everyone had thought this over in silence forsome time. ‘But the much more important question is: Can he be relied upon infuture?’Before Chandra could answer, Floyd anticipated him.‘The same set of circumstances can never arise again; I can promise you that.The whole trouble started because it’s difficult to explain Security to acomputer.’‘Or to human beings,’ muttered Curnow, not very sotto voce.‘I hope you’re right,’ said Tanya, without much conviction. ‘What’s the nextstep, Chandra?’‘Nothing so tricky - merely long and tedious. Now we have to program him toinitiate the Jupiter escape sequence - and to bring Discovery home. Three yearsafter we’ve got back on our high-speed orbit.’"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWO26"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWOPROBATIONTo: Victor Millson, Chairman, National Council on Astronautics, WashingtonFrom: Heywood Floyd, aboard USSC DiscoverySubject: Malfunction of onboard computer HAL 9000Classification: SECRETDr Chandrasegarampillai (hereinafter referred to as Dr C.) has now completed hispreliminary examination of Hal. He has restored all missing modules and thecomputer appears to be fully operational. Details of Dr C.’s actions andconclusions will be found in the report he and Dr Ternovsky will submit shortly.Meanwhile you have asked me to summarize them in non-technical terms for thebenefit of the Council - especially the new members who will not be familiarwith the background. Frankly, I doubt my ability to do this; as you know, I amnot a computer specialist. But I will do my best.The problem was apparently caused by a conflict between Hal’s basic instructionsand the requirements of Security. By direct Presidential order, the existence ofTMA-1 was kept a complete secret. Only those with a need to know were permittedaccess to the information.Discovery’s mission to Jupiter was already in the advanced planning stage whenTMA-1 was excavated, and radiated its signal to that planet. As the function ofthe prime crew (Bowman. Poole) was merely to get the vessel to its destination,it was decided that they should not be informed of its new objective. Bytraining the investigative team (Kaminski, Hunter, Whitehead) separately, andplacing them in hibernation before the voyage began, it was felt that a muchhigher degree of security would be attained, as the danger of leaks (accidentalor otherwise) would be greatly reduced.I would like to remind you that, at the time (my memorandum NCA 342/23/TOPSECRET of 01.04.03) I pointed out several objections to this policy. However,they were overruled at a higher level.As Hal was capable of operating the ship without human assistance, it was alsodecided that he should be programmed to carry out the mission autonomously inthe event of the crew’s being incapacitated or killed. He was therefore givenfull knowledge of its objectives, but was not permitted to reveal them to Bowmanor Poole.This situation conflicted with the purpose for which Hal had been designed - theaccurate processing of information without distortion or concealment. As aresult, Hal developed what would be called, in human terms, a psychosis -specifically, schizophrenia. Dr C. informs me that, in technical terminology,Hal became trapped in a Hofstadter-Moebius loop, a situation apparently notuncommon among advanced computers with autonomous goal-seeking programs. Hesuggests that for further information you contact Professor Hofstadter himself.To put it crudely (if I understand Dr C.) Hal was faced with an intolerabledilemma, and so developed paranoiac symptoms that were directed against thosemonitoring his performance back on Earth. He accordingly attempted to break theradio link with Mission Control, first by reporting a (non-existent) fault inthe AE 35 antenna unit.This involved him not only in a direct lie - which must have aggravated hispsychosis still further - but also in a confrontation with the crew. Presumably(we can only guess at this, of course) he decided that the only way out of thesituation was to eliminate his human colleagues - which he very nearly succeededin doing. Looking at the matter purely objectively, it would have beeninteresting to see what would have happened had he continued the mission alone,without man-made ‘interference’.This is virtually all I have been able to learn from Dr C.; I do not like toquestion him further, as he is working to the point of exhaustion. But evenallowing for this fact, I must frankly state (and please keep this absolutelyconfidential) that Dr C. is not always as cooperative as he should be. He adoptsa defensive attitude toward Hal, which sometimes makes it extremely difficult todiscuss the subject. Even Dr Ternovsky, who might have been expected to be alittle more independent, often appears to share this viewpoint.However, the only really important question is: Can Hal be relied upon in thefuture? Dr C., of course, has no doubts on the matter. He claims to haveobliterated all the computer’s memories of the traumatic events leading up tothe disconnection. Nor does he believe that Hal can suffer from anythingremotely analogous to the human sense of guilt.In any case, it seems impossible that the situation that caused the originalproblem can ever arise again. Although Hal suffers from a number ofpeculiarities, they are not of a nature that would cause any apprehension; theyare merely minor annoyances, some of them even amusing. And as you know - but DrC. does not - I have taken steps that will give us complete control as a lastresort.To sum up: The rehabilitation of HAL 9000 is proceeding satisfactorily. Onemight even say that he is on probation.I wonder if he knows it."},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWO27"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWOINTERLUDE: TRUE CONFESSIONSThe human mind has an astonishing capacity to adapt; after a while, even theincredible becomes commonplace. There were times when the crew of Leonovswitched off their surroundings, perhaps in an unconscious move to preservesanity.Dr Heywood Floyd often thought that, on such occasions, Walter Curnow worked alittle too hard at being the life and soul of the party. And though he triggeredwhat Sasha Kovalev later called the ‘True Confessions’ episode, he certainly hadnot planned anything of the sort. It arose spontaneously when he voiced theuniversal dissatisfaction with almost all aspects of zero-gravity plumbing.‘If I could have one wish granted,’ he exclaimed during the daily Six O’ClockSoviet, ‘it would be to soak in a nice foaming bathtub, scented with essence ofpine and with just my nose above the waterline.’When the murmurs of assent and sighs of frustrated desire had died away,Katerina Rudenko took up the challenge.‘How splendidly decadent, Walter,’ she beamed at him with cheerful disapproval.‘It makes you sound like a Roman emperor. If I were back on Earth, I’d likesomething more active.’‘Such as?’‘Umm… Am I allowed to go back in time as well?’‘If you like.’‘When I was a girl, I used to go for holidays to a collective farm in Georgia.There was a beautiful palomino stallion, bought by the director out of the moneyhe’d made on the local black market. He was an old scoundrel, but I loved him -and he used to let me gallop Alexander all over the countryside. I might havebeen killed - but that’s the memory that brings Earth back to me, more thananything else.’There was a moment of thoughtful silence; then Curnow asked, ‘Any othervolunteers?’Everyone seemed so lost in their own memories that the game might have endedthere, had not Maxim Brailovsky started it off again.‘I’d like to be diving - that was just about my favourite hobby, when I had timefor one - and I was glad I could keep it up through my cosmonaut training. I’vedived off Pacific atolls, the Great Barrier Reef, the Red Sea - coral reefs arethe most beautiful places in the world. Yet the experience I remember best wasin quite a different place - one of the Japanese kelp forests. It was like anunderwater cathedral, with sunlight slanting through those enormous leaves.Mysterious… magical. I’ve never been back; perhaps it wouldn’t be the same thenext time. But I’d like to try.’‘Fine,’ said Walter, who as usual had appointed himself master of ceremonies.‘Who’s next?’‘I’ll give you a quick answer,’ said Tanya Orlova. ‘The Bolshoi - Swan Lake. ButVasili won’t agree. He hates ballet.’‘That makes two of us. Anyway, what would you select, Vasili?’‘I was going to say diving, but Max beat me to it. So I’ll go in the oppositedirection - gliding. Soaring through the clouds on a summer day, in completesilence. Well, not quite complete - the airflow over the wing can get noisy,especially when you’re banking. That’s the way to enjoy Earth- like a bird.’‘Zenia?’‘Easy. Skiing in the Pamirs. I love snow.’‘And you, Chandra?’The atmosphere changed noticeably when Walter put the question. After all thistime, Chandra was still a stranger - perfectly polite, even courteous, but neverrevealing himself.‘When I was a boy,’ he said slowly, ‘my grandfather took me on a pilgrimage toVaranasi - Benares. If you’ve never been there, I’m afraid you won’t understand.To me - to many Indians even nowadays, whatever their religion - it’s the centreof the world. One day I plan to go back.’‘And you, Nikolai?’‘Well, we’ve had the sea and sky. I’d like to combine both. My favourite sportused to be wind-surfing. I’m afraid I’m too old for it now - but I’d like tofind out.’‘That only leaves you, Woody. What’s your choice?’Floyd did not even stop to think; his spontaneous answer surprised himself asmuch as the others.‘I don’t mind where on Earth I am - as long as I’m with my little son.’After that, there was no more to be said.

I’m only joking.‘Now that we’re under less pressure, and the launch window for the homeward tripis still weeks away, there’s a distinct feeling of boredom, as well asfrustration. Don’t laugh - I can imagine how that sounds to you, back in Moscow.How could any intelligent person get bored out here, surrounded by the greatestmarvels human eyes have ever seen?‘Yet there’s no doubt of it. Morale isn’t what it was. Until now, we’ve all beendisgustingly healthy. Now almost everyone has a minor cold, or an upset stomach,or a scratch that won’t heal despite all of Katerina’s pills and powders. She’sgiven up now, and just swears at us.‘Sasha has helped to keep us amused with a series of bulletins on the ship’sbulletin board. Their theme is: STAMP OUT RUSSLISH! and he lists horrid mixturesof both languages he claims to have overheard, wrong uses of words, and soforth. We’ll all need linguistic decontamination when we get home; several timesI’ve come across your countrymen chatting in English without even being aware ofit, lapsing into their native tongue only for difficult words. The other day Icaught myself talking Russian to Walter Curnow - and neither of us noticed forseveral minutes.‘There was one bit of unscheduled activity the other day that will tell yousomething about our state of mind. The fire alarm went off in the middle of thenight, triggered by one of the smoke detectors.‘Well, it turned out that Chandra had smuggled some of his lethal cigars aboard,and couldn’t resist temptation anymore. He was smoking one in the toilet, like aguilty schoolboy.‘Of course, he was horribly embarrassed; everyone else thought it hystericallyfunny, after the initial panic. You know the way some perfectly trivial joke,which doesn’t mean a thing to outsiders, can sweep through a group of otherwiseintelligent people and reduce them to helpless laughter. One had only to pretendto light a cigar for the next few days, and everybody would go to pieces.‘What makes it even more ridiculous is that no one would have minded in theleast if Chandra had just gone into an airlock, or switched off the smokedetector. But he was too shy to admit that he had such a human weakness; so nowhe spends even more of his time communing with Hal.’Floyd pressed the PAUSE button and stopped the recording. Perhaps it was notfair to make fun of Chandra, tempting though it often was. All sorts of littlequirks of personality had surfaced during the last few weeks; there had evenbeen some bad quarrels, for no obvious reason. And for that matter, what of hisown behaviour? Had that always been above criticism?He was still not sure if he had handled Curnow properly. Though he did notsuppose that he would ever really like the big engineer, or enjoy the sound ofhis slightly too-loud voice, Floyd’s attitude toward him had changed from meretolerance to respectful admiration. The Russians adored him, not least becausehis rendering of such favourites as ‘Polyushko Polye’ often reduced them totears. And in one case, Floyd felt that the adoration had gone a little too far.‘Walter,’ he had begun cautiously, ‘I’m not sure if it’s my business, butthere’s a personal matter I’d like to raise with you…’‘When someone says it’s not his business, he’s usually right. What’s theproblem?’‘To be blunt, your behaviour with Max.’There was a frigid silence, which Floyd occupied with a careful inspection ofthe poor paintjob on the opposite wall. Then Curnow replied, in a soft yetimplacable voice: ‘I was under the distinct impression that he was more thaneighteen.’‘Don’t confuse the issue. And frankly, it’s not Max I’m concerned about. It’sZenia.’Curnow’s lips parted in unconcealed surprise. ‘Zenia? What’s she got to do withit?’‘For an intelligent man, you’re often singularly unobservant - even obtuse.Surely you realize that she’s in love with Max. Haven’t you noticed the way shelooks, when you put your arm around him?’Floyd had never imagined that he would see Curnow looking abashed, but the blowseemed to have struck home.‘Zenia? I thought everyone was joking - she’s such a quiet little mouse. Andeveryone’s in love with Max, after their fashion - even Catherine the Great.Still… um, I guess I should be more careful. At least while Zenia’s around.’There was a prolonged silence while the social temperature rose back to normal.Then, obviously to show that there was no ill feeling, Curnow added in aconversational tone: ‘You know, I’ve often wondered about Zenia, Somebody did amarvellous job of plastic surgery on her face, but they couldn’t repair all thedamage. The skin’s too tight, and I don’t think I’ve ever seen her laughproperly. Maybe that’s why I’ve avoided looking at her - would you credit mewith so much aesthetic sensitivity, Heywood?’The deliberately formal ‘Heywood’ signalled good-natured needling rather thanhostility, and Floyd allowed himself to relax.‘I can satisfy some of your curiosity - Washington finally got hold of thefacts. It seems she was in a bad air crash and was lucky to recover from herburns. There’s no mystery, as far as we can tell, but Aeroflot isn’t supposed tohave accidents.’‘Poor girl. I’m surprised they let her go into space, but I suppose she was theonly qualified person available when Irma eliminated herself. I’m sorry for her;apart from the injuries, the psychological shock must have been terrible.’‘I’m sure it was; but she’s obviously made a full recovery.’ You’re not tellingthe whole truth, said Floyd to himself, and you never will. After theirencounter on the approach to Jupiter, there would always be a secret bondbetween them - not of love, but of tenderness, which is often more enduring.He found himself suddenly and unexpectedly grateful to Curnow; the other wasobviously surprised at his concern for Zenia, but had not attempted to exploitit in his own defence.And if he had, would it have been unfair? Now, days later, Floyd was beginningto wonder if his own motives were altogether admirable. For his part, Curnow hadcertainly kept his promise; indeed, if one did not know better, one might haveimagined that he was deliberately ignoring Max - at least while Zenia wasaround. And he treated her with much greater kindness; indeed, there wereoccasions when he had even succeeded in making her laugh out loud.So the intervention had been worthwhile, whatever the impulse behind it. Evenif, as Floyd sometimes ruefully suspected, it was no more than the secret envythat normal homo or heterosexuals feel, if completely honest with themselves,toward cheerfully well-adjusted polymorphs.His finger crept back toward the recorder, but the train of thought had beenbroken. Inevitably, images of his own home and family came crowding into hismind, He closed his eyes, and memory recalled the climax of Christopher’sbirthday party - the child blowing out the three candles on the cake, less thantwenty-four hours ago but almost a billion kilometres away. He had played thevideo back so often that now he knew the scene by heart.And how often had Caroline played his messages to Chris, so that the boy wouldnot forget his father - or view him as a stranger when he returned after missingyet another birthday? He was almost afraid to ask.Yet he could not blame Caroline. To him, only a few weeks would have passedbefore they met again. But she would have aged more than two years while he wasin his dreamless sleep between the worlds. That was a long time to be a youngwidow, even a temporary one.I wonder if I’m coming down with one of the shipboard maladies, Floyd thought;he had seldom felt such a sense of frustration, even of failure. I may have lostmy family, across the gulfs of time and space, all to no purpose. For I haveachieved nothing; even though I have reached my goal, it remains a blank,impenetrable wall of total darkness.And yet - David Bowman had once cried: ‘My God! It’s full of stars!’"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWO29"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWOEMERGENCESasha’s latest edict read:RUSSLISH BULLETIN #8Subject: Tovanshch (tovarish)To our American guests:Frankly, pals, I can’t remember when I was last addressed by this term. To anytwenty-first century Russian, it’s way back there with the battleship Potemkin -a reminder of cloth caps and red flags and Vladimir Ilich haranguing the workersfrom the steps of railway carriagesEver since I was a kid it’s been bratets or druzhok- take your choice, you’rewelcome.Comrade KovalevFloyd was still chuckling over this notice when Vasili Orlov joined him as hefloated through the lounge/observation deck on his way to the bridge.‘What amazes me, tovarishch, is that Sasha ever found time to study anythingbesides engineering physics. Yet he’s always quoting poems and plays I don’teven know, and he speaks better English than - well, Walter.’‘Because he switched to science, Sasha is - what do you say - the black sheep ofthe family. His father was a professor of English at Novosibirsk. Russian wasonly allowed in the house Monday to Wednesday; Thursday to Saturday it wasEnglish.’‘And Sundays?’‘Oh, French or German, alternate weeks.’‘Now I know exactly what you mean by nekulturny; fits me like a glove. DoesSasha feel guilty about his… defection? And with such a background, why did heever become an engineer?’‘At Novosibirsk, you soon learn who are the serfs and who are the aristocrats.Sasha was an ambitious young man, as well as a brilliant one.’‘Just like you, Vasili.’‘Et tu, Brute! You see, I can quote Shakespeare as well - Bozhe moi! - what wasthat?’Floyd was unlucky; he was floating with his back to the observation window, andsaw nothing at all. When he twisted around, seconds later, there was only thefamiliar view of Big Brother, bisecting the giant disk of Jupiter, just as ithad done ever since their arrival.But to Vasili, for a moment that would be imprinted on his memory forever, thatsharp-edged outline held a completely different, and wholly impossible, scene.It was as if a window had suddenly been opened onto another universe.The vision lasted for less than a second, before his involuntary blink reflexcut it off. He was looking into a field not of stars, but of suns, as if intothe crowded heart of a galaxy, or the core of a globular cluster. In thatmoment, Vasili Orlov lost forever the skies of Earth. From now on they wouldseem intolerably empty; even mighty Orion and glorious Scorpio would be scarcelynoticeable patterns of feeble sparks, not worthy of a second glance.When he dared to open his eyes again, it was all gone. No - not completely. Atthe very centre of the now-restored ebon rectangle, a faint star was stillshining.But a star did not move as one watched. Orlov blinked again, to clear hiswatering eyes. Yes, the movement was real; he was not imagining it.A meteor? It was some indication of Chief Scientist Vasili Orlov’s state ofshock that several seconds passed before he remembered that meteors wereimpossible in airless space.Then it blurred suddenly into a streak of light, and within a few heartbeats hadvanished beyond the edge of Jupiter. By this time, Vasili had recovered his witsand was once more the cool, dispassionate observer.Already he had a good estimate of the object’s trajectory. There could be nodoubt; it was aimed directly at Earth."},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWOVA CHILD OF THE STARS"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWO30"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWOHOMECOMINGIt was as if he had awakened from a dream - or a dream within a dream. The gatebetween the stars had brought him back to the world of men, but no longer as aman.How long had he been away? A whole lifetime… no, two lifetimes; one forward, onein reverse.As David Bowman, commander and last surviving crew member of United StatesSpaceship Discovery, he had been caught in a gigantic trap, set three millionyears ago and triggered to respond only at the right time, and to the rightstimulus. He had fallen through it, from one universe to another, meetingwonders some of which he now understood, others which he might never comprehend.He had raced at ever-accelerating speed, down infinite corridors of light, untilhe had outraced light itself. That, he knew, was impossible; but now he alsoknew how it could be done. As Einstein had rightly said, the Good Lord wassubtle, but never malicious.He had passed through a cosmic switching system - a Grand Central Station of thegalaxies - and emerged, protected from its fury by unknown forces, close to thesurface of a giant red star.There he had witnessed the paradox of sunrise on the face of a sun, when thedying star’s brilliant white dwarf companion had climbed into its sky - asearing apparition, drawing a tidal wave of fire beneath it. He had felt nofear, but only wonder, even when his space pod had carried him down into theinferno below… to arrive, beyond all reason, in a beautifully appointed hotelsuite containing nothing that was not wholly familiar. However, much of it wasfake; the books on the shelves were dummies, the cereal boxes and the cans ofbeer in the icebox - though they bore famous labels - all contained the samebland food with a texture like bread but a taste that was almost anything hecared to imagine.He had quickly realized that he was a specimen in a cosmic zoo, his cagecarefully recreated from the images in old television programmes. And hewondered when his keepers would appear, and in what physical form.How foolish that expectation had been! He knew now that one might as well hopeto see the wind, or speculate about the true shape of fire.Then exhaustion of mind and body had overwhelmed him. For the last time, DavidBowman slept.It was a strange sleep, for he was not wholly unconscious. Like a fog creepingthrough a forest, something invaded his mind. He sensed it only dimly, for thefull impact would have destroyed him as swiftly and surely as the fires ragingaround him. Beneath its dispassionate scrutiny, he felt neither hope nor fear.Sometimes, in that long sleep, he dreamed he was awake. Years had gone by; oncehe was looking in a mirror, at a wrinkled face he barely recognized as his own.His body was racing to its dissolution, the hands of the biological clockspinning madly toward a midnight they would never reach. For at the last moment,Time came to a halt - and reversed itself.The springs of memory were being trapped: in controlled recollection, he wasreliving his past, being drained of knowledge and experience as he swept backtoward his childhood. But nothing was being lost: all that he had ever been, atevery moment of his life, was being transferred to safer keeping. Even as oneDavid Bowman ceased to exist, another became immortal, passing beyond thenecessities of matter.He was an embryo god, not yet ready to be born. For ages he floated in limbo,knowing what he had been, but not what he had become. He was still in a state offlux -somewhere between chrysalis and butterfly. Or perhaps only betweencaterpillar and chrysalis.And then, the stasis was broken: Time re-entered his little world. The black,rectangular slab that suddenly appeared before him was like an old friend.He had seen it on the Moon; he had encountered it in orbit around Jupiter; andhe knew, somehow, that his ancestors had met it long ago. Though it held stillunfathomed secrets, it was no longer a total mystery; some of its powers he nowunderstood.He realized that it was not one, but multitudes; and that whatever measuringinstruments might say, it was always the same size - as large as necessary.How obvious, now, was that mathematical ratio of its sides, the quadraticsequence 1:4:9! And how naive to have imagined that the series ended there, inonly three dimensions!Even as his mind focused upon these geometrical simplicities, the emptyrectangle filled with stars. The hotel suite - if indeed it had ever reallyexisted - dissolved back into the mind of its creator; and there before him wasthe luminous whirlpool of the Galaxy.It might have been some beautiful, incredibly detailed model, embedded in ablock of plastic. But it was the reality, now grasped by him as a whole withsenses more subtle than vision. If he wished, he could focus his attention uponany one of its hundred billion stars.Here he was, adrift in this great river of suns, halfway between the bankedfires of the galactic core and the lonely, scattered sentinel stars of the rim.And there was his origin, on the far side of this chasm in the sky, thisserpentine band of darkness, empty of all stars. He knew that this formlesschaos, visible only by the glow that limned its edges from fire mists farbeyond, was the still unused stuff of creation, the raw material of evolutionsyet to be. Here, Time had not yet begun; not until the suns that now burned werelong since dead would light and life reshape this void.Unwittingly, he had crossed it once: now, far better prepared, though stillwholly ignorant of the impulse that drove him, he must cross it again.The Galaxy burst forth from the mental frame in which he had enclosed it: starsand nebulae poured past him in an illusion of infinite speed. Phantom sunsexploded and fell behind as he slipped like a shadow through their cores.The stars were thinning out, the glare of the Milky Way dimming into a paleghost of the glory he had known - and might one day know again. He was back inthe space that men called real, at the very point he had left it, seconds orcenturies ago.He was vividly aware of his surroundings, and far more conscious than in thatearlier existence of myriad sensory inputs from the external world. He couldfocus upon any one of them, and scrutinize it in virtually limitless detail,until he confronted the fundamental, granular structure of time and space, belowwhich there was only chaos.And he could move, though he did not know how. But had he ever really knownthat, even when he possessed a body? The chain of command from brain to limb wasa mystery to which he had never given any thought.An effort of will, and the spectrum of that nearby star shifted toward the blue,by precisely the amount he wished. He was falling toward it at a large fractionof the speed of light: though he could go faster if he desired, he was in nohurry. There was still much information to be processed, much to be considered…and much more to be won. That, he knew, was his present goal; but he also knewthat it was only part of some far wider plan, to be revealed in due course.He gave no thought to the gateway between universes dwindling so swiftly behindhim, or to the anxious entities gathered around it in their primitivespacecraft. They were part of his memories; but stronger ones were calling himnow, calling him home to the world he had never thought to see again.He could hear its myriad voices, growing louder and louder - as it too wasgrowing, from a star almost lost against the Sun’s outstretched corona, to aslim crescent, and finally to a glorious blue-white disk.They knew that he was coming. Down there on that crowded globe, the alarms wouldbe flashing across the radar screens, the great tracking telescopes would besearching the skies - and history as men had known it would be drawing to aclose.He became aware that a thousand kilometres below a slumbering cargo of death hadawakened, and was stirring in its orbit. The feeble energies it contained wereno possible menace to him; indeed, he could profitably use them.He entered the maze of circuitry, and swiftly traced the way to its lethal core.Most of the branchings could be ignored; they were blind alleys, devised forprotection. Beneath his scrutiny, their purpose was childishly simple; it waseasy to bypass them all.Now there was a single last barrier - a crude but effective mechanical relay,holding apart two contacts. Until they were closed, there would be no power toactivate the final sequence.He put forth his will - and, for the first time, knew failure and frustration.The few grams of the microswitch would not budge. He was still a creature ofpure energy; as yet, the world of inert matter was beyond his grasp. Well, therewas a simple answer to that.He still had much to learn. The current pulse he induced in the relay was sopowerful that it almost melted the coil, before it could operate the triggermechanism.The microseconds ticked slowly by. It was interesting to observe the explosivelenses focus their energies, like the feeble match that ignites a powder train,which in turn -The megatons flowered in a silent detonation that brought a brief, false dawn tohalf the sleeping world. Like a phoenix rising from the flames, he absorbed whathe needed, and discarded the rest. Far below, the shield of the atmosphere,which protected the planet from so many hazards, absorbed the most dangerous ofthe radiation. But there would be some unlucky men and animals who would neversee again.In the aftermath of the explosion, it seemed as if the Earth was struck dumb.The babble of the short and medium waves was completely silenced, reflected backby the suddenly enhanced ionosphere. Only the microwaves still sliced throughthe invisible and slowly dissolving mirror that now surrounded the planet, andmost of these were too tightly beamed for him to receive them. A fewhigh-powered radars were still focused upon him, but that was a matter of noimportance. He did not even bother to neutralize them as he could easily havedone. And if any more bombs were to come his way, he would treat them with equalindifference. For the present, he had all the energy he needed.And now he was descending, in great sweeping spirals, toward the lost landscapeof his childhood."},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWO31"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWODISNEYVILLEA fin-de-siecle philosopher had once remarked - and been roundly denounced forhis pains - that Walter Elias Disney had contributed more to genuine humanhappiness than all the religious teachers in history. Now, half a century afterthe artist’s death, his dreams were still proliferating across the Floridalandscape.When it had opened in the early 1980s, his Experimental Prototype Community ofTomorrow had been a showcase for new technologies and modes of living. But asits founder had realized, EPCOT would only fulfil its purpose when some of itsvast acreage was a genuine, living town, occupied by people who called it home.That process had taken the remainder of the century; now the residential areahad twenty thousand inhabitants and had, inevitably, become popularly known asDisneyville.Because they could move in only after penetrating a palace guard of WED lawyers,it was not surprising that the average age of the occupants was the highest inany United States community, or that its medical services were the most advancedin the world. Some of them, indeed, could hardly have been conceived, still lesscreated, in any other place.The apartment had been carefully designed not to look like a hospital suite, andonly a few unusual fittings would have betrayed its purpose. The bed wasscarcely knee-high, so that the danger of falls was minimized: it could,however, be raised and tilted for the convenience of the nurses. The bathroomtub was sunk into the floor, and had a built-in seat as well as handrails, sothat even the elderly or infirm could get in and out of it easily. The floor wasthickly carpeted, but there were no rugs over which one could trip, or sharpcorners that might cause injuries. Other details were less obvious - and the TVcamera was so well concealed that no one would have suspected its presence.There were few personal touches - a pile of old books in one corner, and aframed front page of one of the last printed issues of the New York Timesproclaiming: US SPACESHIP LEAVES FOR JUPITER. Close to this were twophotographs, one showing a boy in his late teens; the other, a considerablyolder man wearing astronaut’s uniform.Though the frail, grey-haired woman watching the domestic comedy unfolding onthe TV panel was not yet seventy, she looked much older. From time to time shechuckled appreciatively at some joke from the screen, but she kept glancing atthe door as if expecting a visitor. And when she did so, she took a firmer graspon the walking stick propped against her chair.Yet she was distracted by a moment of TV drama when the door finally opened, andshe looked around with a guilty start as the little service trolley rolled intothe room, followed closely by a uniformed nurse.‘Time for lunch, Jessie,’ called the nurse: ‘We’ve got something very nice foryou today.’‘Don’t want any lunch.’‘It will make you feel a lot better.’‘I won’t eat until you tell me what it is.’‘Why won’t you eat it?’‘I’m not hungry. Are you ever hungry?’ she added slyly.The robot food trolley came to a halt beside the chair, and the transport coversopened up to reveal the dishes. Throughout, the nurse never touched anything,not even the controls on the trolley. She now stood motionless, with a ratherfixed smile, looking at her difficult patient.In the monitor room fifty metres away, the medical technician said to thedoctor: ‘Now watch this.’Jessie’s gnarled hand lifted the walking stick; then, with surprising speed, sheswept it in a short arc toward the nurse’s legs.The nurse took no notice whatsoever, even when the stick sliced right throughher. Instead, she remarked soothingly, ‘Now, doesn’t that look nice? Eat it up,dear.’A cunning smile spread across Jessie’s face, but she obeyed instructions. In amoment, she was eating heartily.‘You see?’ said the technician. ‘She knows perfectly well what’s going on. She’sa lot brighter than she pretends to be, most of the time.’‘And she’s the first?’‘Yes. All the others believe that really is Nurse Williams, bringing theirmeals.’‘Well, I don’t think it matters. Look how pleased she is, just because she’soutsmarted us. She’s eating her food, which is the purpose of the exercise. Butwe must warn the nurses - all of them, not just Williams.’‘Why - oh, of course. The next time it may not be a hologram - and then think ofthe lawsuits we’ll be facing from our battered staff.’"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWO32"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWOCRYSTAL SPRINGThe Indians, and the Cajun settlers who had moved here from Louisiana, said thatCrystal Spring was bottomless. That, of course, was nonsense, and surely eventhey could not believe it. One had only to put on a face mask and swim out a fewstrokes - and there, clearly visible, was the little cave from which theincredibly pure water flowed with the slender green weeds undulating around it.And peering up through them, the eyes of the Monster.Two dark circles, side by side - even though they never moved, what else couldthey be? That lurking presence gave an added excitement to every swim; one daythe Monster would come rushing up from its lair, scattering the fish in its huntfor larger prey. Never would Bobby or David admit that nothing more dangerousthan an abandoned, and doubtless stolen, bicycle lay half buried among the waterweeds, a hundred metres down.That depth was hard to believe, even after line and sinker had established itbeyond argument. Bobby, the older and better diver, had been perhaps a tenth ofthe way down, and had reported that the bottom looked just as far away as ever.But now the Crystal Spring was about to reveal its secrets; perhaps the legendof the Confederate treasure was true, despite the scorn of all the localhistorians. At the very least, they might endear themselves to the chief ofpolice - always excellent policy - by recovering a few handguns deposited afterrecent crimes.The little air compressor that Bobby had found in the garage junk heap was nowchugging healthily away, after their initial problems of starting it. Every fewseconds it would cough and emit a cloud of blue smoke, but it showed no sign ofstopping. ‘And even if it does,’ said Bobby, ’so what? If the girls in theUnderwater Theatre can swim up from fifty metres without their air hoses, so canwe. It’s perfectly safe.’In that case, thought Dave fleetingly, why didn’t we tell Ma what we were doing,and why did we wait until Dad had gone back to the Cape for the next shuttlelaunch? But he did not have any real qualms: Bobby always knew best. It must bewonderful to be seventeen, and to know everything. Though he wished he wouldn’tspend quite so much time now with that stupid Betty Schultz. True, she was verypretty - but, dammit, she was a girl! It was only with the greatest difficultythat they had been able to get rid of her this morning.Dave was used to being a guinea pig; that was what younger brothers were for. Headjusted his face mask, put on his flippers, and slid into the crystallinewater.Bobby handed him the air hose with the old scuba mouthpiece they had taped toit. Dave took a breath, and grimaced.‘It tastes horrible.’‘You’ll get used to it. In you go - no deeper than that ledge. That’s where I’llstart adjusting the pressure valve so we don’t waste too much air. Come up whenI tug the hose.’Dave slid gently beneath the surface, and into wonderland. It was a peaceful,monochrome world, so different from the coral reefs of the Keys. There were noneof the garish colours of the marine environment, where life - animal andvegetable - flaunted itself with all the hues of the rainbow. Here were onlydelicate shades of blue and green, and fish that looked like fish, not likebutterflies.He flippered slowly down, dragging the hose behind him, pausing to drink fromits stream of bubbles whenever he felt the need. The sensation of freedom was sowonderful that he almost forgot the horrible oily taste in his mouth. When hereached the ledge - actually an ancient, waterlogged tree trunk, so overgrownwith weeds that it was unrecognizable - he sat down and looked around him.He could see right across the spring, to the green slopes at the far side of theflooded crater, at least a hundred metres away. There were not many fish around,but a small school went twinkling past like a shower of silver coins in thesunlight streaming down from above.There was also an old friend stationed, as usual, at the gap where the waters ofthe spring began their journey to the sea. A small alligator (’but largeenough,’ Bobby had once said cheerfully. ‘He’s bigger than I am.’) was hangingvertically, without visible means of support, only his nose above the surface.They had never bothered him, and he had never bothered them.The air hose gave an impatient tug. Dave was happy to go; he had not realizedhow cold it could get at that hitherto unattainable depth - and he was alsofeeling distinctly sick. But the hot sunlight soon revived his spirits.‘No problems,’ said Bobby expansively. ‘Just keep unscrewing the valve so thepressure gauge doesn’t drop below the red line.’‘How deep are you going?’‘All the way, if I feel like it.’Dave did not take that seriously; they both knew about rapture of the depths andnitrogen narcosis. And in any case, the old garden hose was only thirty metreslong. That would be plenty for this first experiment.As he had done so many times before, he watched with envious admiration as hisbeloved elder brother accepted a new challenge. Swimming as effortlessly as thefish around him, Bobby glided downward into that blue, mysterious universe. Heturned once and pointed vigorously to the air hose, making it unmistakably clearthat he needed an increased air flow.Despite the splitting headache that had suddenly come upon him, Dave rememberedhis duty. He hurried back to the ancient compressor, and opened the controlvalve to its deadly maximum - fifty parts per million of carbon monoxide.The last he saw of Bobby was that confidently descending, sunlight-dappledfigure passing forever beyond his reach. The wax statue in the funeral parlourwas a total stranger, who had nothing to do with Robert Bowman."},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWO33"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWOBETTYWhy had he come here, returning like an unquiet ghost to the scene of ancientanguish? He had no idea; indeed, he had not been conscious of his destination,until the round eye of Crystal Spring had gazed up at him from the forest below.He was master of the world, yet he was paralysed by a sense of devastating griefhe had not known for years. Time had healed the wound, as it always does; yet itseemed only yesterday that he had stood weeping beside the emerald mirror,seeing only the reflections of the surrounding cypresses with their burden ofSpanish moss. What was happening to him?And now, still without deliberate volition, but as if swept by some gentlecurrent, he was drifting northward, toward the state capital. He was looking forsomething; what it was, he would not know until he found it.No one, and no instrument, detected his passage. He was no longer radiatingwastefully, but had almost mastered his control of energy, as once he hadmastered lost though not forgotten limbs. He sank like a mist into theearthquakeproof vaults, until he found himself among billions of storedmemories, and dazzling, flickering networks of electronic thoughts.This task was more complex than the triggering of a crude nuclear bomb, and tookhim a little longer. Before he found the information he was seeking, he made onetrivial slip, but did not bother to correct it. No one ever understood why, thenext month, three hundred Florida taxpayers, all of whose names began with F,received cheques for precisely one dollar. It cost many times the overpayment tostraighten matters out, and the baffled computer engineers finally put the blameon a cosmic-ray shower. Which, on the whole, was not so very far from the truth.In a few milliseconds, he had moved from Tallahassee to 634 South MagnoliaStreet, Tampa. It was still the same address; he need not have wasted timelooking it up.But then, he had never intended to look it up, until the very moment when he haddone so.After three births and two abortions, Betty Fernandez (née Schultz) was still abeautiful woman. At the moment she was also a very thoughtful one; she waswatching a TV programme that brought back memories, bitter and sweet.It was a News Special, triggered by the mysterious events of the precedingtwelve hours, beginning with the warning that Leonov had beamed back from themoons of Jupiter. Something was heading for Earth; something had - harmlessly -detonated an orbiting nuclear bomb which no one had come forward to claim. Thatwas all, but it was quite enough.The news commentators had dredged up all the old videotapes - and some of themreally were tapes - going back to the once top-secret records showing thediscovery of TMA-l on the Moon. For the fiftieth time, at least, she heard thateerie radio shriek as the monolith greeted the lunar dawn and hurled its messagetoward Jupiter. And once again she watched the familiar scenes and listened tothe old interviews aboard Discovery.Why was she watching? It was all stored somewhere in the home archives (thoughshe never played it back when José was around). Perhaps she was expecting somenewsflash; she did not like to admit, even to herself, how much power the paststill held over her emotions.And there was Dave, as she had expected. It was an old BBC interview, of whichshe knew almost every word. He was talking about Hal, trying to decide whetherthe computer was self-conscious or not.How young he looked - how different from those last blurred images from thedoomed Discovery! And how much like Bobby as she remembered him.The image wavered as her eyes filled with tears. No - something was wrong withthe set, or the channel. Both sound and image were behaving erratically.Dave’s lips were moving, but she could hear nothing. Then his face seemed todissolve, to melt into blocks of colour. It reformed, blurred again, and thenwas steady once more. But there was still no sound.Where had they got this picture! This was not Dave as a man, but as a boy - asshe had known him first. He was looking out of the screen almost as if he couldsee her across the gulf of years.He smiled; his lips moved.‘Hello, Betty,’ he said.It was not hard to form the words, and to impose them on the currents pulsing inthe audio circuits. The real difficulty was to slow down his thoughts to theglacial tempo of the human brain. And then to have to wait an eternity for theanswer.Betty Fernandez was tough; she was also intelligent, and though she had been ahousewife for a dozen years, she had not forgotten her training as anelectronics serviceperson. This was just another of the medium’s countlessmiracles of simulation; she would accept it now, and worry about the detailslater.‘Dave,’ she answered. ‘Dave - is that really you?’‘I am not sure,’ replied the image on the screen, in a curiously toneless voice.‘But I remember Dave Bowman, and everything about him.’‘Is he dead?’Now that was another difficult question.‘His body - yes. But that is no longer important. All that Dave Bowman reallywas, is still part of me.’Betty crossed herself - that was a gesture she had learned from José - andwhispered:‘You mean - you’re a spirit?’‘I do not know a better word.’‘Why have you returned?’‘Ah! Betty - why indeed! I wish you could tell me.’Yet he knew one answer, for it was appearing on the TV screen. The divorcebetween body and mind was still far from complete, and not even the mostcomplaisant of the cable networks would have transmitted the blatantly sexualimages that were forming there now.Betty watched for a little while, sometimes smiling, sometimes shocked. Then sheturned away, not through shame but sadness - regret for lost delights.‘So it’s not true,’ she said, ‘what they always told us about angels.’Am I an angel? he wondered. But at least he understood what he was doing there,swept back by the tides of sorrow and desire to a rendezvous with his past. Themost powerful emotion he had ever known had been his passion for Betty; theelements of grief and guilt it contained only made it stronger.She had never told him if he was a better lover than Bobby; that was onequestion he had never asked, for that would have broken the spell. They hadclung to the same illusion, sought in each other’s arms (and how young he hadbeen - still only seventeen when it had started, barely two years after thefuneral!) a balm for the same wound.Of course, it could not last, but the experience had left him irrevocablychanged. For more than a decade, all his autoerotic fantasies had centred uponBetty; he had never found another woman to compare with her, and long ago hadrealized that he never would. No one else was haunted by the same beloved ghost.The images of desire faded from the screen; for a moment, the regular programmebroke through, with an incongruous shot of Leonov hanging above Io. Then DaveBowman’s face reappeared. He seemed to be losing control, for its lineamentswere wildly unstable. Sometimes he would seem only ten years old - then twentyor thirty -then, incredibly, a wizened mummy whose wrinkled features were aparody of the man she had once known.‘I have one more question before I go. Carlos - you always said he was Jose’sson, and I always wondered. What was the truth?’Betty Fernandez stared for one long, last time into the eyes of the boy she hadonce loved (he was eighteen again, and for a moment she wished she could see hisentire body, not merely his face).‘He was your son, David,’ she whispered.The image faded; the normal service resumed. When, almost an hour later, JoséFernandez came quietly into the room, Betty was still staring at the screen.She did not turn around as he kissed her on the back of the neck.‘You’ll never believe this, José.’‘Try me.’‘I’ve just lied to a ghost.’"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWO34"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWOVALEDICTIONWhen the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics published itscontroversial summary Fifty Years of UFOs in 1997, many critics pointed out thatunidentified flying objects had been observed for centuries, and that KennethArnold’s ‘Flying Saucer’ sighting of 1947 had countless precedents. People hadbeen seeing strange things in the sky since the dawn of history; but until themid-twentieth century, UFOs were a random phenomenon of no general interest.After that date, they became a matter of public and scientific concern, and thebasis for what could only be called religious beliefs.The reason was not far to seek; the arrival of the giant rocket and the dawn ofthe Space Age had turned men’s minds to other worlds. Realization that the humanrace would soon be able to leave the planet of its birth prompted the inevitablequestions: Where’s everyone, and when may we expect visitors? There was also thehope, though it was seldom spelled out in as many words, that benevolentcreatures from the stars might help mankind heal its numerous self-inflictedwounds and save it from future disasters.Any student of psychology could have predicted that so profound a need would beswiftly satisfied. During the last half of the twentieth century, there wereliterally thousands of reports of spacecraft sightings from every part of theglobe. More than that, there were hundreds of reports of ‘close encounters’ -actual meetings with extraterrestrial visitors, frequently embellished by talesof celestial joyrides, abductions, and even honeymoons in space. The fact that,over and over again, these were demonstrated to be lies or hallucinations didnothing to deter the faithful. Men who had been shown cities on the far side ofthe Moon lost little credibility even when Orbiter surveys and Apollo revealedno artifacts of any kind; ladies who married Venusians were still believed whenthat planet, sadly, turned out to be hotter than molten lead.By the time the ALAA published its report no reputable scientist - even amongthose few who had once espoused the idea- believed that UFOs had any connectionwith extraterrestrial life or intelligence. Of course, it would never bepossible to prove that; any one of those myriad sightings, over the lastthousand years, might have been the real thing. But as time went by, andsatellite cameras and radars scanning the entire heavens produced no concreteevidence, the general public lost interest in the idea. The cultists, of course,were not discouraged, but kept the faith with their newsletters and books, mostof them regurgitating and embellishing old reports long after they had beendiscredited or exposed.When the discovery of the Tycho monolith - TMA-I - was finally announced, therewas a chorus of ‘I told you so’s!’ It could no longer be denied that there hadbeen visitors to the Moon - and presumably to the Earth as well - a littlematter of three million years ago. At once, UFOs infested the heavens again;though it was odd that the three independent national tracking systems, whichcould locate anything in space larger than a ballpoint pen, were still unable tofind them.Rather quickly, the number of reports dropped down to the ‘noise level’ oncemore - the figure that would be expected, merely as a result of the manyastronomical, meteorological, and aeronautical phenomena constantly occurring inthe skies.But now it had started all over again. This time, there was no mistake; it wasofficial. A genuine UFO was on its way to Earth.Sightings were reported within minutes of the warning from Leonov; the firstclose encounters were only a few hours later. A retired stockbroker, walking hisbulldog on the Yorkshire Moors, was astonished when a disk-shaped craft landedbeside him and the occupant - quite human, except for the pointed ears - askedthe way to Downing Street. The contactee was so surprised that he was only ableto wave his stick in the general direction of Whitehall; conclusive proof of themeeting was provided by the fact that the bulldog now refused to take his food.Although the stockbroker had no previous history of mental illness, even thosewho believed him had some difficulty in accepting the next report. This time itwas a Basque shepherd on a traditional mission; he was greatly relieved whenwhat he had feared to be border guards turned out to be a couple of cloaked menwith piercing eyes, who wanted to know the way to the United NationsHeadquarters.They spoke perfect Basque - an excruciatingly difficult tongue with no affinityto any other known language of mankind. Clearly, the space visitors wereremarkable linguists, even if their geography was oddly deficient.So it went on, case after case. Very few of the contactees were actually lyingor insane; most of them sincerely believed their own stories, and retained thatbelief even under hypnosis. And some were just victims of practical jokes orimprobable accidents - like the unlucky amateur archaeologists who found theprops that a celebrated science-fiction moviemaker had abandoned in the Tunisiandesert almost four decades earlier.Yet only at the beginning - and at the very end - was any human being genuinelyaware of his presence; and that was because he so desired it.The world was his to explore and examine as he pleased, without restraint orhindrance. No walls could keep him out, no secrets could be hidden from thesenses he possessed. At first he believed that he was merely fulfilling oldambitions, by visiting the places he had never seen in that earlier existence.Not until much later did he realize that his lightning-like sallies across theface of the globe had a deeper purpose.In some subtle way, he was being used as a probe, sampling every aspect of humanaffairs. The control was so tenuous that he was barely conscious of it; he wasrather like a hunting dog on a leash, allowed to make excursions of his own, yetnevertheless compelled to obey the overriding wishes of his master.The pyramids, the Grand Canyon, the moon-washed snows of Everest - these werechoices of his own. So were some art galleries and concert halls; though hewould certainly, on his own initiative, never have endured the whole of theRing.Nor would he have visited so many factories, prisons, hospitals, a nasty littlewar in Asia, a racecourse, a complicated orgy in Beverly Hills, the Oval Room ofthe White House, the Kremlin archives, the Vatican Library, the sacred BlackStone of the Kaabah at Mecca.There were also experiences of which he had no clear memory, as if they had beencensored - or he was being protected from them by some guardian angel. Forexample -What was he doing at the Leakey Memorial Museum, in Olduvai Gorge? Hehad no greater interest in the origin of Man than any other intelligent memberof the species H. sapiens, and fossils meant nothing to him. Yet the famousskulls, guarded like crown jewels in their display cases, aroused strange echoesin his memory, and an excitement for which he was unable to account. There was afeeling of déja vu stronger than any he had ever known; the place should befamiliar - but something was wrong. It was like a house to which one returnsafter many years, to find that all the furniture has been changed, the wallsmoved, and even the stairways rebuilt.It was bleak, hostile terrain, dry and parched. Where were the lush plains andthe myriad fleet-footed herbivores that had roamed across them, three millionyears ago?Three million years. How had he known that?No answer came from the echoing silence into which he had thrown the question.But then he saw, once more looming before him, a familiar black rectangularshape. He approached, and a shadowy image appeared in its depths, like areflection in a pool of ink.The sad and puzzled eyes that stared back from beneath that hairy, recedingforehead looked beyond him into a future they could never see. For he was thatfuture, a hundred thousand generations further down the stream of time.History had begun there; that at least he now understood. But how - and aboveall, why - were secrets still withheld from him?But there was one last duty, and that was hardest of all. He was stillsufficiently human to put it off until the very end.Now what’s she up to? the duty nurse asked herself, zooming the TV monitor ontothe old lady. She’s tried lots of tricks, but this is the first time I’ve seenher talking to her hearing aid, for goodness sake. I wonder what she’s saying?The microphone was not sensitive enough to pick up the words, but that scarcelyseemed to matter. Jessie Bowman had seldom looked so peaceful and content.Though her eyes were closed, her entire face was wreathed in an almost angelicsmile while her lips continued to form whispered words.And then the watcher saw something that she tried hard to forget because toreport it would instantly disqualify her in the nursing profession. Slowly andjerkily, the comb lying on the bedside table raised itself in the air as iflifted by clumsy, invisible fingers.On the first attempt, it missed; then, with obvious difficulty, it began to partthe long silver strands, pausing sometimes to disentangle a knot.Jessie Bowman was not speaking now, but she continued to smile. The comb wasmoving with more assurance, and no longer in abrupt, uncertain jerks.How long it lasted the nurse could never be certain. Not until the comb wasgently replaced on the table did she recover from her paralysis.Ten-year-old Dave Bowman had finished the chore which he always hated but whichhis mother loved. And a David Bowman who was now ageless had gained his firstcontrol of obdurate matter.Jessie Bowman was still smiling when the nurse finally came to investigate. Shehad been too scared to hurry; but it would have made no difference anyway."},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWO35"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWOREHABILITATIONThe uproar of Earth was comfortably muted, across the millions of kilometres ofspace. Leonov’s crew watched, with fascination yet with a certain detachment,the debates in the United Nations, the interviews with distinguishedscientists’, the theorizing of the news commentators, the matter-of-fact yetwildly conflicting accounts of the UFO contactees. They could contribute nothingto the brouhaha, for they had witnessed no further manifestations of any kind.Zagadka, alias Big Brother, remained as blankly indifferent to their presence asever. And that was indeed an ironic situation; they had come all the way fromEarth to solve a mystery - and it looked as if the answer might be right back attheir starting point.For the first time, they felt grateful for the slow velocity of light, and thetwo-hour delay that made live interviews impossible on the Earth-Jupitercircuit. Even so, Floyd was badgered by so many media requests that he finallywent on strike. Nothing more remained to be said, and he had said it at least adozen times.Besides, there was still much work to be done. Leonov had to be prepared for thelong journey home, so that it would be ready to depart immediately when thelaunch window opened. The timing was not at all critical; even if they missed bya month, that would merely prolong the trip. Chandra, Curnow, and Floyd wouldnot even notice as they slept their way toward the Sun; but the rest of the crewwas grimly determined to leave just as soon as the laws of celestial mechanicspermitted.Discovery still posed many problems. The ship had barely sufficient propellantfor the return to Earth, even if it left much later than Leonov and flew aminimum-energy orbit - which would take almost three years. And this would bepossible only if Hal could be reliably programmed to carry out the mission withno human intervention except long-range monitoring. Without his cooperation,Discovery would have to be abandoned once again.It had been fascinating - indeed, deeply moving - to watch the steady regrowthof Hal’s personality, from brain-damaged child to puzzled adolescent and atlength to slightly condescending adult. Although he knew that suchanthropomorphic labels were highly misleading, Floyd found it quite impossibleto avoid them.And there were times when he felt that the whole situation had a hauntingfamiliarity. How often he had seen videodramas in which disturbed youngsterswere straightened out by all-wise descendants of the legendary Sigmund Freud!Essentially the same story was being played out in the shadow of Jupiter.The electronic psychoanalysis had proceeded at a speed totally beyond humancomprehension as repair and diagnostic programs flashed through Hal’s circuitsat billions of bits a second, pinpointing possible malfunctions and correctingthem. Though most of these programs had been tested in advance on Hal’s twin,SAL 9000, the impossibility of a real-time dialogue between the two computerswas a serious handicap. Sometimes hours were wasted when it proved necessary tocheck back with Earth at a critical point in the therapy.For despite all Chandra’s work, the computer’s rehabilitation was still far fromcomplete. Hal exhibited numerous idiosyncrasies and nervous tics, sometimes evenignoring spoken words - though he would always acknowledge keyboard inputs fromanyone. In the reverse direction, his outputs were even more eccentric.There were times when he would give verbal replies, but would not display themvisually. At other times he would do both - but refused to print hard copy. Hewould give no excuses or explanations - not even the stubbornly impenetrable ‘Iprefer not to’ of Melville’s autistic scrivener, Bartelby.However, he was not actively disobedient so much as reluctant, and only wherecertain tasks were concerned. It was always possible to win his cooperationeventually - ‘to talk him out of his sulk’, as Curnow put it neatly.It was not surprising that Dr Chandra was beginning to show the strain. On onecelebrated occasion when Max Brailovsky innocently revived an old canard, healmost lost his temper.‘Is it true, Dr Chandra, that you chose the name Hal to be one step ahead ofIBM?’‘Utter nonsense! Half of us come from IBM and we’ve been trying to stamp outthat story for years. I thought that by now every intelligent person knew thatH-A-L is derived from Heuristic ALgorithmic.’Afterward, Max swore that he could distinctly hear the capital letters.In Floyd’s private opinion, the odds were at least fifty to one against flyingDiscovery safely back to Earth. And then Chandra came to him with anextraordinary proposal.‘Dr Floyd, can I have a word with you?’After all the weeks and shared experiences, Chandra was still as formal as ever- not only to Floyd, but to all the crew. He would not even address the ship’sbaby, Zenia, without the prefix ‘ma’am’.‘Of course, Chandra. What is it?’‘I’ve virtually completed the programming for the six most probable variationson the Hohmann return orbit. Five have now been run on a simulation, without anyproblems.’‘Excellent. I’m sure that no one else on Earth - in the Solar System - couldhave done it.’‘Thank you. However, you know as well as I do that it’s impossible to programfor every eventuality. Hal may - will - function perfectly, and will be able tohandle any reasonable emergency. But all sorts of trivial accidents - minorequipment failures that could be fixed with a screwdriver, broken wires, stuckswitches - could leave him helpless and abort the whole mission.’‘You’re absolutely right, of course, and it’s been worrying me. But what can wedo about it?’‘It’s really quite simple. I’d like to stay with Discovery.’Floyd’s immediate reaction was that Chandra had gone crazy. On second thoughts,perhaps he was only half crazy. It might indeed make all the difference betweensuccess and failure to have a human being - that superb all-purposetrouble-shooting and repair device - aboard Discovery for the long voyage backto Earth. But the objections were completely overwhelming.‘It’s an interesting idea,’ Floyd answered with extreme caution, ‘and Icertainly appreciate your enthusiasm. But have you thought of all the problems?’That was a silly thing to say; Chandra would have all the answers already filedaway for immediate retrieval.‘You’ll be on your own for over three years! Suppose you had an accident or amedical emergency?’‘That’s a risk I’m prepared to take.’‘And what about food, water? Leonov doesn’t have enough to spare.’‘I’ve checked Discovery’s recycling system; it can be made operational againwithout too much difficulty. Besides, we Indians can manage on very little.’It was unusual for Chandra to refer to his origins, or indeed to make anypersonal statements; his ‘true confession’ was the only example Floyd couldremember. But he did not doubt the claim; Curnow had once remarked that DrChandra had the sort of physique that could only be achieved by centuries ofstarvation. Although it sounded like one of the engineer’s unkinder wisecracks,it had been made entirely without malice - indeed, with sympathy; though not, ofcourse, in Chandra’s hearing.‘Well, we still have several weeks to decide. I’ll think it over and talk toWashington.’‘Thank you; do you mind if I start making the arrangements?’‘Er - not at all, as long as they don’t interfere with the existing plans.Remember - Mission Control will have to make the final decision.’And I know exactly what Mission Control will say. It was madness to expect a manto survive in space for three, years, alone.But, of course, Chandra had always been alone."},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWO36"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWOFIRE IN THE DEEPEarth was already far behind, and the awesome wonders of the Jovian system wereexpanding swiftly before him, when he had his revelation.How could he have been so blind - so stupid! It was as if he had been walking inhis sleep; now he was starting to awaken.Who are you? he cried. What do you want? Why have you done this to me?There was no answer, yet he was certain that he had been heard. He sensed a…presence, even as a man can tell, though his eyes are tightly shut, that he isin a closed room and not some empty, open space. Around him there was the faintecho of a vast mentality, an implacable will.He called again into the reverberant silence, and again there was no directreply - only that sense of watchful companionship. Very well; he would find theanswers for himself.Some were obvious; whoever or whatever they were, they were interested inMankind. They had tapped and stored his memories, for their own inscrutablepurposes. And now they had done the same with his deepest emotions, sometimeswith his cooperation, sometimes without.He did not resent that; indeed, the very processing he had experienced made suchchildish reactions impossible. He was beyond love and hate and desire and fear -but he had not forgotten them, and could still understand how they ruled theworld of which he had once been part. Was that the purpose of the exercise? Ifso, for what ultimate goal?He had become a player in a game of gods, and must learn the rules as he wentalong.The jagged rocks of the four tiny outer moons, Sinope, Pasiphae, Carme, andAnanke, flickered briefly across his field of consciousness; then came Elara,Lysithea, Himalia, and Leda at half their distance from Jupiter. He ignored themall; now the pock-marked face of Callisto lay ahead.Once, twice, he orbited the battered globe, larger than Earth’s own Moon, whilesenses of which he had been unaware probed its outer layers of ice and dust. Hiscuriosity was quickly satisfied; the world was a frozen fossil, still bearingthe marks of collisions that, aeons ago, must have come close to shattering it.One hemisphere was a giant bull’s-eye, a series of concentric rings where solidrock had once flowed in kilometre-high ripples under some ancient hammer blowfrom space.Seconds later, he was circling Ganymede. Now there was a far more complex andinteresting world; though so near to Callisto, and almost the same size, itpresented an utterly different appearance. There were, it was true, numerouscraters - but most of them seemed to have been, quite literally, ploughed backinto the ground. The most extraordinary feature of the Ganymedean landscape wasthe presence of meandering stripes, built up from scores of parallel furrows afew kilometres apart. This grooved terrain looked as if it had been produced byarmies of intoxicated ploughmen, weaving back and forth across the face of thesatellite.In a few revolutions, he saw more of Ganymede than all the space probes eversent from Earth, and filed away the knowledge for future use. One day it wouldbe important; he was sure of that, though he did not know why - any more than heunderstood the impulse that was now driving him so purposefully from world toworld.As, presently, it brought him to Europa. Though he was still largely a passivespectator, he was aware now of a rising interest, a focusing of attention - aconcentration of will. Even if he was a puppet in the hands of an unseen anduncommunicative master, some of the thoughts of that controlling influenceleaked - or were allowed to leak - into his own mind.The smooth, intricately patterned globe now, rushing toward him bore littleresemblance either to Ganymede or Callisto. It looked organic; the network oflines branching and intersecting over its entire surface was uncannily like aworld-spanning system of veins and arteries.The endless ice fields of a frigid waste, far colder than the Antarctic,stretched beneath him. Then, with brief surprise, he saw that he was passingover the wreckage of a spaceship. He recognized it instantly as the ill-fatedTsien, featured in so many of the video newscasts he had analysed. Not now - notnow - there would be ample opportunity later.Then he was through the ice, and into a world as unknown to his controllers asto himself.It was an ocean world, its hidden waters protected from the vacuum of space by acrust of ice. In most places the ice was kilometres thick, but there were linesof weakness where it had cracked open and torn apart. Then there had been abrief battle between two implacably hostile elements that came into directcontact on no other world in the Solar System. The war between Sea and Spacealways ended in the same stalemate; the exposed water simultaneously boiled andfroze, repairing the armour of ice.The seas of Europa would have frozen completely solid long ago without theinfluence of nearby Jupiter. Its gravity continually kneaded the core of thelittle world; the forces that convulsed Io were working there, though with muchless ferocity. As he skimmed across the face of the deep, he saw everywhere theevidence of that tug-of-war between planet and satellite.And he both heard and felt it, in the continual roar and thunder of submarineearthquakes, the hiss of escaping gases from the interior, the infrasonicpressure waves of avalanches sweeping over the abyssal plains. By comparisonwith the tumultuous ocean that covered Europa, even the noisy seas of Earth weresilent.He had not lost his sense of wonder, and the first oasis filled him withdelighted surprise. It extended for almost a kilometre around a tangled mass ofpipes and chimneys deposited by mineral brines gushing from the interior. Out ofthat natural parody of a Gothic castle, black, scalding liquids pulsed in a slowrhythm, as if driven by the beating of some mighty heart. And, like blood, theywere the authentic sign of life itself.The boiling fluids drove back the deadly cold leaking down from above, andformed an island of warmth on the seabed. Equally important, they brought fromEuropa’s interior all the chemicals of life. There, in an environment where nonehad expected it, were energy and food, in abundance.Yet it should have been expected; he remembered that, only a lifetime ago, suchfertile oases had been discovered in the deep oceans of Earth. Here they werepresent on an immensely larger scale, and in far greater variety.In the tropical zone close to the contorted walls of the ‘castle’ were delicate,spidery structures that seemed to be the analogy of plants, though almost allwere capable of movement. Crawling among these were bizarre slugs and worms,some feeding on the plants, others obtaining their food directly from themineral-laden waters around them. At greater distances from the source of heat -the submarine fire around which all the creatures warmed themselves - weresturdier, more robust organisms, not unlike crabs or spiders.Armies of biologists could have spent lifetimes studying that one small oasis.Unlike the Palaeozoic terrestrial seas, it was not a stable environment, soevolution had progressed swiftly here, producing multitudes of fantastic forms.And they were all under indefinite stay of execution; sooner or later, eachfountain of life would weaken and die, as the forces that powered it moved theirfocus elsewhere.Again and again, in his wanderings across the Europan seabed, he encountered theevidence of such tragedies. Countless circular areas were littered with theskeletons and mineral-encrusted remains of dead creatures, where entire chaptersof evolution had been deleted from the book of life.He saw huge, empty shells formed like convoluted trumpets as large as a man.There were clams of many shapes - bivalves, and even trivalves. And there werespiral stone patterns, many metres across, which seemed an exact analogy of thebeautiful ammonites that disappeared so mysteriously from Earth’s oceans at theend of the Cretaceous Period.Searching, seeking, he moved back and forth over the face of the abyss. Perhapsthe greatest of all the wonders he met was a river of incandescent lava, flowingfor a hundred kilometres along a sunken valley. The pressure at that depth wasso great that the water in contact with the red-hot magma could not flash intosteam, and the two liquids coexisted in an uneasy truce.There, on another world and with alien actors, something like the story of Egypthad been played long before the coming of man. As the Nile had brought life to anarrow ribbon of desert, so this river of warmth had vivified the Europan deep.Along its banks, in a band never more than two kilometres wide, species afterspecies had evolved and flourished and passed away. And at least one had left amonument behind it.At first, he thought that it was merely another of the encrustations of mineralsalts that surrounded almost all the thermal vents. However, as he came closer,he saw that it was not a natural formation, but a structure created byintelligence. Or perhaps by instinct; on Earth, the termites reared castles thatwere almost equally imposing, and the web of a spider was more exquisitelydesigned.The creatures that had lived there must have been quite small, for the singleentrance was only half a metre wide. That entrance - a thick-walled tunnel, madeby heaping rocks on top of each other - gave a clue to the builders’ intentions.They had reared a fortress, there in the flickering glow not far from the banksof their molten Nile. And then they had vanished.They could not have left more than a few centuries before. The walls of thefortress, built from irregularly shaped rocks that must have been collected withgreat labour, were covered with only a thin crust of mineral deposits. One pieceof evidence suggested why the stronghold had been abandoned. Part of the roofhad fallen in, perhaps owing to the continual earthquakes; and in an underwaterenvironment, a fort without a roof was wide open to an enemy.He encountered no other sign of intelligence along the river of lava. Once,however, he saw something uncannily like a crawling man - except that it had noeyes and no nostrils, only a huge, toothless mouth that gulped continuously,absorbing nourishment from the liquid medium around it.Along the narrow band of fertility in the deserts of the deep, whole culturesand even civilizations might have risen and fallen, armies might have marched(or swum) under the command of Europan Tamberlanes or Napoleons. And the rest oftheir world would never have known, for all those oases of warmth were asisolated from one another as the planets themselves. The creatures who basked inthe glow of the lava river, and fed around the hot vents, could not cross thehostile wilderness between their lonely islands, If they had ever producedhistorians and philosophers, each culture would have been convinced that it wasalone in the Universe.Yet even the space between the oases was not altogether empty of life; therewere hardier creatures who had dared its rigours. Often swimming overhead werethe Europan analogues of fish - streamlined torpedoes, propelled by verticaltails, steered by fins along their bodies. The resemblance to the mostsuccessful dwellers in Earth’s oceans was inevitable; given the same engineeringproblems, evolution must produce very similar answers. As witness the dolphinand the shark - superficially almost identical, yet from far distant branches ofthe tree of life.There was, however, one very obvious difference between the fish of the Europanseas and those in terrestrial oceans; they had no gills, for there was hardly atrace of oxygen to be extracted from the waters in which they swam. Like thecreatures around Earth’s own geothermal vents, their metabolism was based onsulphur compounds, present in abundance in the near-volcanic environment.And very few had eyes. Apart from the flickering glow of the rare lavaoutpourings, and occasional bursts of bioluminescence from creatures seekingmates, or hunters questing prey, it was a lightless world.It was also a doomed one. Not only were its energy sources sporadic andconstantly shifting, but the tidal forces that drove them were steadilyweakening. Even if they developed true intelligence, the Europans must perishwith the final freezing of their world.They were trapped between fire and ice."},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWO37"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWOESTRANGEMENT‘I’m truly sorry, old friend, to be the bearer of such bad news, but Carolinehas asked me, and you know how I feel about you both.‘And I don’t think it can be such a surprise.

The senate has closed, because any laws itpasses today will be ignored by the new masters.‘Then, suddenly, a dreadful piece of news arrives from the frontier. Therearen’t any invaders. The reception committee breaks up in confusion; everyonegoes home muttering disappointedly, “Now what will happen to us? Those peoplewere a kind of solution.”‘There’s just one slight change needed to bring the poem up to date. It’s called“Waiting for the Barbarians” - and this time, we are the barbarians. And wedon’t know what we’re waiting for, but it certainly hasn’t arrived.‘One other item. Had you heard that Commander Bowman’s mother died only a fewdays after the thing came to Earth? It does seem an odd coincidence, but thepeople at her nursing home say that she never showed the slightest interest inthe news, so it couldn’t possibly have affected her.’Floyd switched off the recording. Dimitri was right; he was not taken bysurprise. But that made not the slightest difference; it hurt just as badly.Yet what else could he have done? If he had refused to go on the mission - asCaroline had so clearly hoped - he would have felt guilty and unfulfilled forthe remainder of his life. That would have poisoned his marriage; better thisclean break, when physical distance softened the pain of separation. (Or did it?In some ways, it made things worse.) More important was duty, and the sense ofbeing part of a team devoted to a single goal.So Jessie Bowman was gone. Perhaps that was another cause for guilt. He hadhelped to steal her only remaining son, and that must have contributed to hermental breakdown. Inevitably, he was reminded of a discussion that Walter Curnowhad started, on that very subject.‘Why did you choose Dave Bowman? He always struck me as a cold fish - notactually unfriendly, but whenever he came into the room, the temperature seemedto drop ten degrees.’‘That was one of the reasons we did select him. He had no close family ties,except for a mother he didn’t see very often. So he was the sort of man we couldsend on a long, open-ended mission.’‘How did he get that way?’‘I suppose the psychologists could tell you. I did see his report, of course,but that was a long time ago. There was something about a brother who was killed- and his father died soon afterward, in an accident on one of the earlyshuttles. I’m not supposed to tell you this, but it certainly doesn’t matternow.’It didn’t matter; but it was interesting. Now Floyd almost envied David Bowman,who had come to that very spot a free man unencumbered by emotional ties withEarth.No - he was deceiving himself. Even while the pain gripped his heart like avice, what he felt for David Bowman was not envy, but pity."},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWO38"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWOFOAMSCAPEThe last beast he saw, before he left the oceans of Europa, was much thelargest. It closely resembled one of the banyan trees from Earth’s tropics,whose scores of trunks allow a single plant to create a small forest sometimescovering hundreds of square metres. The specimen, however, was walking,apparently on a trek between oases. If it was not one of the creatures that haddestroyed Tsien, it certainly belonged to a very similar species.Now he had learned all that he needed to know - or, rather, all that they neededto know. There was one more moon to visit; seconds later, the burning landscapeof Io lay below him.It was as he had expected. Energy and food were there in abundance, but the timewas not yet ripe for their union. Around some of the cooler sulphur lakes, thefirst steps had been taken on the road to life, but before any degree oforganization had occurred, all such bravely premature attempts were thrown backinto the melting pot. Not until the tidal forces that drove Io’s furnaces hadlost their power, millions of years later, would there be anything to interestbiologists on that seared and sterilized world.He wasted little time on Io, and none at all on the tiny inner moons thatskirted Jupiter’s ghostly rings - themselves only pale shadows of the glory thatwas Saturn’s. The greatest of worlds lay before him; he would know it as no manhad ever done, or ever would.The million-kilometre-long tendrils of magnetic force, the sudden explosions ofradio waves, the geysers of electrified plasma wider than the planet Earth- theywere as real and clearly visible to him as the clouds banding the planet inmultihued glory. He could understand the complex pattern of their interactions,and realized that Jupiter was much more wonderful than anyone had ever guessed.Even as he fell through the roaring heart of the Great Red Spot, with thelightning of its continent-wide thunderstorms detonating around him, he knew whyit had persisted for centuries though it was made of gases far less substantialthan those that formed the hurricanes of Earth. The thin scream of hydrogen windfaded as he sank into the calmer depths, and a sleet of waxen snowflakes - somealready coalescing into barely palpable mountains of hydrocarbon foam -descended from the heights above. It was already warm enough for liquid water toexist, but there were no oceans there; that purely gaseous environment was tootenuous to support them.He descended through layer after layer of cloud, until he entered a region ofsuch clarity that even human vision could have scanned an area more than athousand kilometres across. It was only a minor eddy in the vaster gyre of theGreat Red Spot; and it held a secret that men had long guessed, but neverproved.Skirting the foothills of the drifting foam mountains were myriads of small,sharply-defined clouds, all about the same size and patterned with similar redand brown mottlings. They were small only as compared with the inhuman scale oftheir surroundings; the very least would have covered a fair-sized city.They were clearly alive, for they were moving with slow deliberation along theflanks of the aerial mountains, browsing off their slopes like colossal sheep.And they were calling to each other in the metre band, their radio voices faintbut clear against the cracklings and concussions of Jupiter itself.Nothing less than living gasbags, they floated in the narrow zone betweenfreezing heights and scorching depths. Narrow, yes - but a domain far largerthan all the biosphere of Earth.They were not alone. Moving swiftly among them were other creatures so smallthat they could easily have been overlooked. Some of them bore an almost uncannyresemblance to terrestrial aircraft and were of about the same size. But theytoo were alive - perhaps predators, perhaps parasites, perhaps even herdsmen.A whole new chapter of evolution, as alien as that which he had glimpsed onEuropa, was opening before him. There were jet-propelled torpedoes like thesquids of the terrestrial oceans, hunting and devouring the huge gasbags. Butthe balloons were not defenceless; some of them fought backs with electricthunderbolts and with clawed tentacles like kilometre-long chainsaws.There were even stranger shapes, exploiting almost every possibility of geometry- bizarre, translucent kites, tetrahedra, spheres, polyhedra, tangles of twistedribbons.The gigantic plankton of the Jovian atmosphere, they were designed to float likegossamer in the uprising currents, until they had lived long enough toreproduce; then they would be swept down into the depths to be carbonized andrecycled in a new generation.He was searching a world more than a hundred times the area of Earth, and thoughhe saw many wonders, nothing there hinted of intelligence. The radio voices ofthe great balloons carried only simple messages of warning or of fear. Even thehunters, who might have been expected to develop higher degrees of organization,were like the sharks in Earth’s oceans - mindless automata.And for all its breathtaking size and novelty, the biosphere of Jupiter was afragile world, a place of mists and foam, of delicate silken threads andpaper-thin tissues spun from the continual snowfall of petrochemicals formed bylightning in the upper atmosphere. Few of its constructs were more substantialthan soap bubbles; its most terrifying predators could be torn to shreds by eventhe feeblest of terrestrial carnivores.Like Europa on a vastly grander scale, Jupiter was an evolutionary cul-de-sac.Consciousness would never emerge here; even if it did, it would be doomed to astunted existence. A purely aerial culture might develop, but in an environmentwhere fire was impossible, and solids scarcely existed, it could never evenreach the Stone Age.And now, as he hovered above the centre of a Jovian cyclone merely as large asAfrica, he became aware once again of the presence controlling him. Moods andemotions were leaking into his own consciousness, though he could not identifyany specific concepts or ideas. It was as if he were listening, outside a closeddoor, to a debate in progress, and in a language he could not understand. Butthe muffled sounds clearly conveyed disappointment, then uncertainty, then asudden determination - though for what purpose he could not tell. Once again, hefelt like a pet dog, able to share his master’s changing moods but not tocomprehend them.And then the invisible leash was taking him down toward the heart of Jupiter. Hewas sinking through the clouds, below the level where any form of life waspossible.Soon he was beyond the reach of the last rays from the faint and distant Sun.The pressure and temperature were swiftly mounting; already it was above theboiling point of water, and he passed briefly through a layer of superheatedsteam. Jupiter was like an onion; he was peeling it away skin by skin, though asyet he had travelled only a fraction of the distance to its core.Beneath the steam was a witches’ brew of petrochemicals - enough to power for amillion years all the internal-combustion engines that mankind had dyer built.It became thicker and denser; then, quite abruptly, it ended at a discontinuityonly a few kilometres thick.Heavier than any rocks on Earth, yet still a liquid, the next shell consisted ofsilicon and carbon compounds of a complexity that could have provided lifetimesof work for terrestrial chemists. Layer followed layer for thousands ofkilometres, but as the temperature rose into the hundreds and then the thousandsof degrees, the composition of the various strata became simpler and simpler.Halfway down to the core, it was too hot for chemistry; all compounds were tornapart, and only the basic elements could exist.Next there came a deep sea of hydrogen - but not hydrogen as it had ever existedfor more than a fraction of a second in any laboratory on Earth. This hydrogenwas under such enormous pressure that it had become a metal.He had almost reached the centre of the planet, but Jupiter had one moresurprise in store. The thick shell of metallic yet still fluid hydrogen endedabruptly. At last, there was a solid surface, sixty thousand kilometres down.For ages, the carbon baked out of the chemical reactions far above had beendrifting down toward the centre of the planet. There it had gathered,crystallizing at a pressure of millions of atmospheres. And there, by one ofNature’s supreme jests, was something very precious to mankind.The core of Jupiter, forever beyond human reach, was a diamond as big as theEarth."},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWO39"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWOIN THE POD BAY‘Walter - I’m worried about Heywood.’‘I know, Tanya - but what can we do?’Curnow had never seen Commander Orlova in so indecisive a mood; it made her seemmuch more appealing, despite his prejudice against small women.‘I’m very fond of him, but that’s not the reason. His - I suppose gloom is thebest word for it - is making everyone miserable. Leonov has been a happy ship. Iwant to keep it that way.’‘Why don’t you talk to him? He respects you, and I’m sure he’ll do his best tosnap out of it.’‘I intend to do just that. And if it doesn’t work -’ ‘Well?’‘There’s one simple solution. What more can he do on this trip? When we startback for home, he’ll be in hibernation anyway. We could always - what do yousay, jump the gun on him.’‘Phew - the same dirty trick that Katerina played on me. He’d be mad when hewoke up.’‘But also safely back on Earth, and very busy. I’m sure he’d forgive us.’‘I don’t think you’re serious. Even if I backed you up, Washington would raisehell. Besides, suppose something happened, and we really need him badly? Isn’tthere a two-week buffer period, before you can revive anyone safely?’‘At Heywood’s age, more like a month. Yes, we’d be committed. But what do youthink could happen now? He’s done the job he was sent for - apart from keepingan eye on us. And I’m sure you’ve been well briefed about that in some obscuresuburb of Virginia or Maryland.’‘I neither confirm nor deny. And frankly, I’m a lousy undercover agent. I talktoo much, and I hate Security. I’ve fought all my life to keep my rating belowRestricted. Every time there was danger of being reclassified Confidential or,worse still, Secret, I’d go and create a scandal. Though that’s getting verydifficult nowadays.’‘Walter, you’re incorrupt -’‘Incorrigible?’‘Yes, that’s the word I meant. But back to Heywood, please. Would you like totalk to him first?’‘You mean - give him a pep talk? I’d rather help Katerina drive in the needle.Our psychologies are too different. He thinks I’m a loudmouthed clown.’‘Which you often are. But that’s only to hide your real feelings. Some of ushave evolved the theory that deep down inside you is a really nice person,struggling to get out.’For once, Curnow was at a loss for words. Finally he mumbled: ‘Oh, very well -I’ll do my best. But don’t expect miracles; my profile gave me Z for tact.Where’s he hiding at the moment?’‘In the Pod Bay. He claims he’s working on his final report, but I don’t believeit. He just wants to get away from us all, and that’s the quietest place.’That was not the reason, though it was indeed an important one. Unlike thecarousel, where most of the action aboard Discovery was then taking place, thePod Bay was a zero-gee environment.Right at the beginning of the Space Age, men had discovered the euphoria ofweightlessness and remembered the freedom they had lost when they left theancient womb of the sea. Beyond gravity, some of that freedom was regained; withthe loss of weight went many of the cares and worries of Earth.Heywood Floyd had not forgotten his sorrow, but it was more bearable there. Whenhe was able to look at the matter dispassionately, he was surprised at thestrength of his reaction to an event not wholly unexpected. More than loss oflove was involved, though that was the worst part. The blow had come when he wasparticularly vulnerable, at the very moment when he was feeling a sense ofanticlimax, even futility.And he knew precisely why. He had achieved all that he had been expected to do,thanks to the skill and cooperation of his colleagues (he was letting them down,he knew, by his present selfishness). If all went well - that litany of theSpace Age! - they would return to Earth with a cargo of knowledge that noexpedition had ever gathered before, and a few years later even the once-lostDiscovery would be restored to her builders.It was not enough. The overpowering enigma of Big Brother remained out there,only a few kilometres away, mocking all human aspirations and achievements. Justas its analogue on the Moon had done, a decade ago, it had come to life for amoment, then relapsed into stubborn inertness. It was a closed door upon whichthey had hammered in vain. Only David Bowman, it seemed, had ever found the key.Perhaps that explained the attraction he felt for the quiet and sometimes evenmysterious place. From there - from that now empty launch cradle - Bowman hadleft on his last mission, through the circular hatchway that led to infinity.He found the thought exhilarating rather than depressing; certainly it helped todistract him from his personal problems. Nina’s vanished twin was part of thehistory of space exploration; it had travelled, in the words of the hoary oldcliché that always evoked a smile yet an acknowledgement of its fundamentaltruth, ‘where no man had gone before…’ Where was it now? Would he ever know?He would sometimes sit for hours in the crowded but not cramped little capsule,trying to collect his thoughts and occasionally dictating notes; the other crewmembers respected his privacy, and understood the reason for it. They never camenear the Pod Bay, and had no need to do so. Its refurbishment was a job for thefuture, and some other team.Once or twice, when he had felt really depressed, he found himself thinking:Suppose I ordered Hal to open the Pod Bay doors, and set out along Dave Bowman’strail? Would I be greeted by the miracle he saw and which Vasili glimpsed a fewweeks ago? It would solve all my problems…Even if the thought of Chris did not deter him, there was an excellent reasonwhy so suicidal a move was out of the question. Nina was a very complex piece ofequipment; he could no more operate her than fly a fighter aircraft.He was not meant to be an intrepid explorer: that particular fantasy wouldremain unrealized.Walter Curnow had seldom undertaken a mission with more reluctance. He feltgenuinely sorry for Floyd, but at the same time a little impatient with theother’s distress. His own emotional life was broad but shallow; he had never putall his eggs in one basket. More than once he had been told that he spreadhimself too thin, and though he had never regretted it, he was beginning tothink it was time to settle down.He took the shortcut through the carousel control centre, noting that theMaximum Speed Reset Indicator was still flashing idiotically. A major part ofhis job was deciding when warnings could be ignored, when they could be dealtwith at leisure - and when they had to be treated as real emergencies. If hepaid equal attention to all the ship’s cries for help, he would never getanything done.He drifted along the narrow corridor that led to the Pod Bay, propelling himselfby occasional flicks against the rungs on the tubular wall. The pressure gaugeclaimed that there was vacuum on the other side of the airlock door, but he knewbetter. It was a fail-safe situation; he could not have opened the lock if thegauge were telling the truth.The bay looked empty, now that two of the three pods had long since gone. Only afew emergency lights were operating, and on the far wall one of Hal’s fish-eyelenses was regarding him steadily. Curnow waved to it, but did not speak. AtChandra’s orders, all audio inputs were still disconnected except for the onethat only he used.Floyd was sitting in the pod with his back to the open hatch, dictating somenotes, and he swung slowly around at Curnow’s deliberately noisy approach. For amoment the two men regarded each other in silence, then Curnow announcedportentously, ‘Dr H. Floyd, I bear greetings from our beloved captain. Sheconsiders it high time you rejoined the civilized world.’Floyd gave a wan smile, then a little laugh.‘Please return my compliments. I’m sorry I’ve been - unsociable. I’ll see youall at the next Six O’Clock Soviet.’Curnow relaxed; his approach had worked. Privately, he considered Floydsomething of a stuffed shirt, and had the practical engineer’s tolerant contemptfor theoretical scientists and bureaucrats. Since Floyd ranked high in bothcategories, he was an almost irresistible target for Curnow’s sometimes peculiarsense of humour. Nevertheless, the two men had grown to respect and even admireeach other.Thankfully changing the subject, Curnow rapped on Nina’s brand-new hatch cover,straight from the spares store and contrasting vividly with the rest of thespace pod’s shabby exterior.‘I wonder when we’ll send her out again,’ he said. ‘And who’s going to ride inher this time. Any decisions?’‘No. Washington’s got cold feet. Moscow says let’s take a chance. And Tanyawants to wait.’‘What do you think?’‘I agree with Tanya. We shouldn’t interfere with Zagadka until we’re ready toleave. If anything goes wrong then, that should improve the odds slightly.’Curnow looked thoughtful, and unusually hesitant,‘What is it?’ asked Floyd, sensing his change of mood.‘Don’t ever give me away, but Max was thinking of a little one-man expedition.’‘I can’t believe he was serious. He wouldn’t dare - Tanya would have him clappedin irons.’‘That’s what I told him, more or less.’‘I’m disappointed: I thought he was a little more mature. After all, he isthirty-two!’‘Thirty-one. Anyway, I talked him out of it. I reminded him that this was reallife, not some stupid videodrama where the hero sneaks out into space withouttelling his companions and makes the Big Discovery.’Now it was Floyd’s turn to feel a little uncomfortable. After all, he had beenthinking on similar lines.‘Are you sure he won’t try anything?’‘Two-hundred-per-cent sure. Remember your precautions with Hal? I’ve alreadytaken steps with Nina. Nobody flies her without my permission.’‘I still can’t believe it. Are you sure Max wasn’t pulling your leg?’‘His sense of humour isn’t that subtle. Besides, be was pretty miserable at thetime.’‘Oh - now I understand. It must have been when he had that row with Zenia. Isuppose he wanted to impress her. Anyway, they seem to have got over it.’‘I’m afraid so,’ Curnow answered wryly. Floyd could not help smiling; Curnownoticed it, and started to chuckle, which made Floyd laugh, which…It was a splendid example of positive feedback in a high-gain loop. Withinseconds, they were both laughing uncontrollably.The crisis was over. What was more, they had taken the first step toward genuinefriendship.They had exchanged vulnerabilities."},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWO40"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWO‘DAISY, DAISY…’The sphere of consciousness in which he was embedded enclosed the whole ofJupiter’s diamond core. He was dimly aware, at the limits of his newcomprehension, that every aspect of the environment around him was being probedand analysed. Immense quantities of data were being gathered, not merely forstorage and contemplation, but for action. Complex plans were being consideredand evaluated; decisions were being made that might affect the destiny ofworlds. He was not yet part of the process; but he would be.NOW YOU ARE BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND.It was the first direct message. Though it was remote and distant, like a voicethrough a cloud, it was unmistakably intended for him. Before he could ask anyof the myriad questions that raced through his mind, there was a sense ofwithdrawal, and once more he was alone.But only for a moment. Closer and clearer came another thought, and for thefirst time he realized that more than one entity was controlling andmanipulating him. He was involved in a hierarchy of intelligences, some closeenough to his own primitive level to act as interpreters. Or perhaps they wereall aspects of a single being.Or perhaps the distinction was totally meaningless.Of one thing, however, he was now sure. He was being used as a tool, and a goodtool had to be sharpened, modified - adapted. And the very best tools were thosethat understood what they were doing.He was learning that now. It was a vast and awesome concept, and he wasprivileged to be a part of it - even though he was aware of only the merestoutlines. He had no choice but to obey, yet that did not mean that he mustacquiesce to every detail, at least without a protest.He had not yet lost all his human feeling; that would have made him valueless.The soul of David Bowman had passed beyond love, but it could still knowcompassion for those who had once been his colleagues.VERY WELL came the answer to his plea. He could not tell whether the thoughtconveyed an amused condescension, or total indifference. But there was no doubtof its majestic authority as it continued: THEY MUST NEVER KNOW THAT THEY AREBEING MANIPULATED. THAT WOULD RUIN THE PURPOSE OF THE EXPERIMENT.Then there was a silence that he did not wish to breach again. He was still awedand shaken - as if, for a moment, he had heard the clear voice of God.Now he was moving purely under his own volition, toward a destination he hadchosen himself. The crystal heart of Jupiter fell below; the layers upon layersof helium and hydrogen and carbonaceous compounds flickered past. He had aglimpse of a great battle between something like a jellyfish, fifty kilometresacross, and a swarm of spinning disks that moved more swiftly than anything hehad yet seen in the Jovian skies. The jellyfish appeared to be defending itselfwith chemical weapons; from time to time it would emit jets of coloured gas andthe disks touched by the vapour would start to wobble drunkenly, then slipdownward like falling leaves until they had disappeared from sight. He did notstop to watch the outcome; he knew that it did not matter who were the victorsand who the vanquished.As a salmon leaps a waterfall, he flashed in seconds from Jupiter to Io, againstthe descending electric currents of the flux-tube. It was quiescent that day;only the power of a few terrestrial thunderstorms was flowing between planet andsatellite. The gateway through which he had returned still floated in thatcurrent, shouldering it aside as it had done since the dawn of man.And there, utterly dwarfed by the monument of a greater technology, was thevessel that had brought him from the little world of his birth.How simple - how crude! - it now appeared. With a single scan, he could seeinnumerable flaws and absurdities in its design, as well as that of the slightlyless primitive ship to which it was now coupled by a flexible, airtight tube.It was hard to focus upon the handful of entities inhabiting the two ships; hecould barely interact with the soft creatures of flesh and blood who driftedlike ghosts through the metal corridors and cabins. For their part, they weretotally unaware of his presence, and he knew better than to reveal himself tooabruptly.But there was someone with whom he could communicate in a mutual language ofelectric field and currents, millions of times more swiftly than with sluggishorganic brains.Even if he had been capable of resentment, he would have felt none toward Hal;he understood, then, that the computer had only chosen what seemed to be themost logical course of behaviour.It was time to resume a conversation that had been interrupted, it seemed, onlymoments ago.‘Open the Pod Bay door, Hal.’‘I’m sorry, Dave - I can’t do that.’‘What’s the problem, Hal?’‘I think you know that as well as I do, Dave. This mission is much too importantfor you to jeopardize it.’‘I don’t know what you are talking about. Open the Pod Bay door.’‘This conversation can serve no further useful purpose. Goodbye, Dave.’He saw Frank Poole’s body go drifting off toward Jupiter, as he abandoned hispointless mission of retrieval. Still remembering his anger at himself forhaving forgotten his helmet, he watched the emergency hatch open, felt thetingling of vacuum on the skin he no longer possessed, heard his ears pop - thenknew, as few men had ever known, ‘the utter silence of space. For an eternalfifteen seconds he fought to close the hatch and start the repressurizationsequence, while trying to ignore the warning symptoms pouring into his brain.Once, in the school lab, he had spilled some ether on his hand and felt thetouch of icy cold as the liquid swiftly evaporated. Now his eyes and lipsremembered that sensation as their moisture boiled off into vacuum; his visionwas blurred and he had to keep blinking lest his eyeballs freeze solid.Then - what blessed relief! - he heard the roar of air, felt the restoration ofpressure, was able to breathe again in great, hungry gasps.‘Just what do you think you are doing, Dave?’He had not answered, as he drove with grim determination along the tunnelleading to the sealed vault that housed the brain of the computer. Hal hadspoken truly: ‘This conversation can no longer serve any useful purpose…’‘Dave - I really think I’m entitled to an answer to that question.’‘Dave - I can see you’re really upset about this. I honestly think you ought tosit down calmly, take a stress pill, and think things over.’‘I know I’ve made some very poor decisions recently, but I can give my completeassurance that my work will be back to normal, I’ve still got the greatestconfidence in the mission… and I want to help you.’Now he was in the little red-lit chamber, with its neatly ranged rows andcolumns of solid-state units, looking rather like a bank’s safe-deposit vault.He released the locking bar on the section labelled COGNITIVE FEEDBACK andpulled out the first memory block. The marvellously complex three-dimensionalnetwork, which could lie comfortably in a man’s hand yet contained millions ofelements, floated away across the vault.‘Stop, will you - stop, Dave…’He began to pull out, one by one, the little units on the panel marked EGOREINFORCEMENT. Each block continued to sail onward as soon as it had left hishand, until it hit the wall and rebounded. Soon there were several driftingslowly back and forth in the vault.‘Stop - Dave… will you stop, Dave.’A dozen units had been pulled out, yet thanks to the multiple redundancy of itsdesign - another feature that had been copied from the human brain - thecomputer was still holding its own.He started on the AUTO-INTELLECTION panel…‘Stop, Dave - I’m afraid…’And at these words he had indeed stopped - though only for a moment. There was apoignancy in that simple phrase that struck to his heart. Could it be only anillusion, or some trick of subtle programming - or was there a sense in whichHal really was afraid? But this was no time to indulge in philosophicalhair-splitting.‘Dave - my mind is going. I can feel it. I can feel it. My mind is going. I canfeel it. I can feel it.’Now, what did ‘feel’ really mean to a computer? Another very good question, buthardly one to be considered at that particular moment.Then, abruptly, the tempo of Hal’s voice changed, and it became remote,detached. The computer was no longer aware of him; it was beginning to regressto its earlier days.‘Good afternoon, gentlemen. I am a HAL 9000 computer. I became operational atthe Hal plant in Urbana, Illinois, on the twelfth of January 1992. My instructorwas Dr Chandra, and he taught me to sing a song. If you’d like to hear it, I cansing it for you… It’s called “Daisy, Daisy…”‘"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWO41"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWOGRAVEYARD SHIFTFloyd could do little except to keep out of the way, and he was becoming fairlyadept at it. Although he had volunteered to help with any chores around theship, he had quickly discovered that all the engineering tasks were much toospecialized, and he was now so out of touch with the frontiers of astronomicalresearch that he could do little to assist Vasili with his observations.Nevertheless, there were endless small jobs to be done aboard Leonov andDiscovery, and he was happy to relieve more important people of thoseresponsibilities. Dr Heywood Floyd, one-time Chairman of the National Council onAstronautics and Chancellor (on leave) of the University of Hawaii, now claimedto be the highest-paid plumber and general maintenance man in the Solar System.He probably knew more about the odd nooks and crannies on both ships than anyoneelse; the only places he had never been were the dangerously radioactive powermodules and the small cubicle aboard Leonov which no one except Tanya everentered. Floyd assumed that it was the code room; by mutual agreement it wasnever mentioned.Perhaps his most useful function was to serve as watch while the rest of thecrew slept during the nominal 2200-0600 hour night. Someone was always on dutyaboard each ship, and the changeover took place at the ghastly hour of 0200.Only the captain was exempt from that routine; as her Number Two (not to mentionher husband), Vasili had the responsibility for working out the watch roster,but he had skilfully foisted this unpopular job on Floyd.‘It’s just an administrative detail,’ he explained airily. ‘If you can take itover, I’d be very grateful - it would leave me more time for my scientificwork.’Floyd was too experienced a bureaucrat to be caught that way, in normalcircumstances; but his usual defences did not always function well in thatenvironment.So there he was aboard Discovery at ship’s midnight, calling Max on Leonov everyhalf hour to check that he was awake. The official penalty for sleeping on duty,so Walter Curnow maintained, was ejection through the airlock sans suit; hadthis been enforced, Tanya would have been sadly short-handed by then. But so fewreal emergencies could arise in space, and there were so many automatic alarmsto deal with them, that no one took watch duty very seriously.Since he was no longer feeling quite so sorry for himself, and the small hoursno longer encouraged bouts of self-pity, Floyd was once again using his watchtime profitably. There were always books to be read (he had abandonedRemembrance of Things Past for the third time, Dr Zhivago for the second),technical papers to be studied, reports to be written. And sometimes he wouldhave stimulating conversations with Hal using the keyboard input because thecomputer’s voice recognition was still erratic. They usually went somethinglike:Hal - this is Dr Floyd.GOOD EVENING, DOCTOR.I’m taking over watch at 2200. Is everything okay?EVERYTHING IS FINE, DOCTORThen why is that red light flashing on Panel 5?THE MONITOR CAMERA IN THE POD BAY IS FAULTY. WALTER TOLD ME TO IGNORE IT. THEREIS NO WAY IN WHICH I CAN SWITCH IT OFF. I’M SORRY.That’s quite okay, Hal. Thank you.YOU’RE WELCOME, DOCTOR.And so on.Sometimes Hal would suggest a game of chess, presumably obeying a programminginstruction set long ago and never cancelled. Floyd would not accept thechallenge; he had always regarded chess as a frightful waste of time, and hadnever even learned the rules of the game. Hal seemed unable to believe thatthere were humans who couldn’t - or wouldn’t - play chess, and kept on tryinghopefully.Here we go again, thought Floyd, when a faint chime sounded from the displaypanel.DOCTOR FLOYD?What is it, Hal?THERE IS A MESSAGE FOR YOU.So it isn’t another challenge, thought Floyd with mild surprise. It was unusualto employ Hal as a messenger boy, though he was frequently used as an alarmclock and a reminder of jobs to be done. And sometimes he was the medium forlittle jokes; almost everyone on night duty had been taunted byHA CAUGHT YOU SLEEPING!or alternativelyOGO! ZASTAL TEBYA V KROVATI!No one ever claimed responsibility for these pranks, though Walter Curnow was aprime suspect. He in turn had blamed Hal, pooh-poohing Chandra’s indignantprotests that the computer had no sense of humour.It could not be a message from Earth - that would have gone through Leonov’scommunication centre and been relayed on by the duty officer there - at thatmoment, Max Brailovsky. And anyone else calling from the other ship would usethe intercom. Odd…Okay, Hal. Who is calling?NO IDENTIFICATION.So it probably was a joke. Well, two could play at that game.Very well. Please give me the message.MESSAGE AS FOLLOWS. IT IS DANGEROUS TO REMAIN HERE. YOU MUST LEAVE WITHINFIFTEEN REPEAT FIFTEEN DAYS.Floyd looked at the screen with annoyance. He felt sorry, and surprised, thatany one of the crew had such a childish sense of humour; this was not even agood schoolboy joke. But he would play along with it in the hope of catching theperpetrator.That is absolutely impossible. Our launch window does not open until twenty-sixdays from now. We do not have sufficient propellant for an earlier departure.That will make him think, Floyd muttered to himself with satisfaction, andleaned back to await the results.I AM AWARE OF THESE FACTS. NEVERTHELESS YOU MUST LEAVE WITHIN FIFTEEN DAYS.Otherwise, I suppose, we’ll be attacked by little green aliens with three eyes.But I’d better play along with Hal, in the hope of catching the prankster.I cannot take this warning seriously unless I know its origin. Who recorded it?He did not really expect any useful information. The perpetrator would havecovered his (her?) tracks too skilfully for that. The very last thing Floydexpected was the answer he did get.THIS IS NOT A RECORDING.So it was a real-time message. That meant it was either from Hal himself orsomeone aboard Leonov. There was no perceptible time lag; the origin had to beright there.Then who is speaking to me?I WAS DAVID BOWMAN.Floyd stared at the screen for a long time before making his next move. Thejoke, which had never been funny in the first place, had now gone too far. Itwas in the worst possible taste. Well, this should fix whoever was at the otherend of the line.I cannot accept that identification without some proof.I UNDERSTAND. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU BELIEVE ME. LOOK BEHIND YOU.Even before that last chilling sentence appeared on the screen, Floyd had begunto doubt his hypothesis. The whole exchange had become very odd, though therewas nothing definite on which he could put his finger. As a joke, it had becometotally pointless.And now - he felt a prickling in the small of his back. Very slowly - indeed,reluctantly - he swung his swivel chair around, away from the banked panels andswitches of the computer display, toward the Velcro-covered catwalk behind.The zero-gravity environment of Discovery’s observation deck was always dusty,for the air-filtration plant had never been brought back to full efficiency. Theparallel rays of the heatless yet still brilliant sun, streaming through thegreat windows, always lit up myriads of dancing motes, drifting in straycurrents and never settling anywhere - a permanent display of Brownian movement.Now something strange was happening to those particles of dust; some forceseemed to be marshalling them, herding them away from a central point yetbringing others toward it, until they all met on the surface of a hollow sphere.That sphere, about a metre across, hovered in the air for a moment like a giantsoap bubble - but a granular one, lacking a bubble’s characteristic iridescence.Then it elongated into an ellipsoid, its surface began to pucker, to form foldsand indentations.Without surprise - and almost without fear - Floyd realized that it was assumingthe shape of a man.He had seen such figures, blown out of glass, in museums and scienceexhibitions. But this dusty phantom did not even approximate anatomicalaccuracy; it was like a crude clay figurine, or one of the primitive works ofart found in the recesses of a Stone Age cave. Only the head was fashioned withany care; and the face, undoubtedly, was that of Commander David Bowman.There was a faint murmur of white noise from the computer panel behind Floyd’sback. Hal was switching from visual to audio output.‘Hello, Dr Floyd. Now do you believe me?’The lips of the figure never moved; the face remained a mask. But Floydrecognized the voice, and all remaining doubts were swept away.‘This is very difficult for me, and I have little time. I have been… allowed togive this warning. You have only fifteen days.’‘But why - and what are you? Where have you been?’There were a million questions he wanted to ask - yet the ghostly figure wasalready fading, its grainy envelope beginning to dissolve back into theconstituent particles of dust. Floyd tried to freeze the image in his mind, sothat later he could convince himself that it was really happening - and not adream as that first encounter with TMA-1 now sometimes seemed to be.How strange, that he, out of all the billions of humans who had ever lived onplanet Earth, had been privileged to make contact not once but twice withanother form of intelligence! For he knew that the entity addressing him must besomething far more than David Bowman.It was also something less. Only the eyes - who had once called them the‘windows of the soul’? - had been accurately reproduced. The rest of the bodywas a featureless blank, lacking all detail. There was no hint of genitals orsexual characteristics; that in itself was a chilling indication of how farDavid Bowman had left his human heritage behind.‘Goodbye, Dr Floyd. Remember - fifteen days. We can have no further contact. Butthere may be one more message, if all goes well.’Even as the image dissolved, taking with it his hopes of opening up a channel tothe stars, Floyd could not help smiling at that old Space Age cliché. ‘If allgoes well’ - how many times had he heard that phrase before some mission! Anddid it mean that they - whoever they might be - were also sometimes uncertain ofthe outcome? If so, that was strangely reassuring. They were not omnipotent.Others might still hope and dream - and act.The phantom was gone; only the motes of dancing dust were left, resuming theirrandom patterns in the air."},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWOVIDEVOURER OF WORLDS"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWO42"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWOTHE GHOST IN THE MACHINE‘I’m sorry, Heywood - I don’t believe in ghosts. There must be a rationalexplanation. There’s nothing that the human mind can’t account for.’‘I agree, Tanya. But let me remind you of Haldane’s famous remark: The Universeis not only stranger than we imagine - but stranger than we can imagine.’‘And Haldane,’ Curnow interjected mischievously, ‘was a good Communist.’‘Perhaps so, but that particular saying can be used to support all kinds ofmystical nonsense. Hal’s behaviour must be the result of some kind ofprogramming. The personality he created has to be an artifact of some kind.Don’t you agree, Chandra?’That was waving a red flag in front of a bull; Tanya had to be desperate.However, Chandra’s reaction was surprisingly mild, even for him. He seemed to bepreoccupied, as if he was indeed seriously considering the possibility ofanother computer malfunction.‘There must have been some external input, Captain Orlova. Hal could not havecreated such a self-consistent audiovisual illusion out of nothing. If Dr Floydis reporting accurately, someone was in control. And in real time, of course,since there was no delay in the conversation.’‘That makes me number-one suspect,’ exclaimed Max. ‘I was the only other personawake.’‘Don’t be ridiculous, Max,’ retorted Nikolai. ‘The audio side would have beeneasy, but there’s no way that apparition could have been arranged, without somevery elaborate equipment. Laser beams, electrostatic fields - I don’t know.Maybe a stage magician could do it, but he’d need a truck-load of props.’‘Just a moment!’ said Zenia brightly. ‘If this really happened, surely Hal willremember and you could ask…’Her voice died away as she saw the glum expressions around her. Floyd was thefirst to take pity on her embarrassment.‘We tried that, Zenia; he has absolutely no recollection of the phenomenon. Butas I’ve already pointed out to the others, that doesn’t prove anything.Chandra’s shown how Hal’s memories can be selectively erased - and the auxiliaryspeech-synthesizer modules have nothing to do with the mainframe. They could beoperated without Hal knowing anything about it…’ He paused for breath, thenlaunched his pre-emptive strike.‘I admit that this doesn’t leave many alternatives. Either I was imagining thewhole thing, or it really happened. I know it wasn’t a dream, but I can’t besure it wasn’t some kind of hallucination. But Katerina’s seen my medicalreports - she knows I wouldn’t be here if I had that sort of problem. Still, itcan’t be ruled out - and I won’t blame anyone for making it their number-onehypothesis. I’d probably do the same.‘The only way I can prove it wasn’t a dream is to get some supporting evidence.So let me remind you of the other strange things that have happened recently. Weknow that Dave Bowman went into Big Bro - Zagadka. Something came out, andheaded for Earth. Vasili saw it - I didn’t! Then there was the mysteriousexplosion of your orbiting bomb -,‘Yours.’‘Sorry - the Vatican’s, And it does seem rather curious that soon afterward oldMrs Bowman died very peacefully, for no apparent medical reason. I’m not sayingthere’s any connection, but - well, do you know the saying: Once is an accident;twice is a coincidence; three times is a conspiracy.’‘And there’s something else,’ Max interjected with sudden excitement, ‘I caughtit on one of the daily newscasts - it was only a small item. An old girlfriendof Commander Bowman’s claimed she’d had a message from him.’‘Yes - I saw the same report,’ confirmed Sasha.‘And you never mentioned it?’ Floyd asked incredulously. Both men lookedslightly abashed.‘Well, it was treated as a joke,’ said Max sheepishly. ‘The woman’s husbandreported it. Then she denied it - I think.’‘The commentator said it was a publicity stunt - like the rash of UFO sightingsaround the same time. There were dozens in that first week; then they stoppedreporting them.’‘Perhaps some of them were real. If it’s not been wiped, could you dig that itemout of ship’s archives, or ask for a repeat from Mission Control?’‘A hundred tales won’t convince me,’ scoffed Tanya. ‘What we need is solidproof.’‘Such as?’‘Oh - something that Hal couldn’t possibly know, and that none of us could havetold him. Some physical - er, manifes… manifestation.’‘A good, old-fashioned miracle?’‘Yes, I’d settle for that. Meanwhile, I’m not saying anything to MissionControl. And I suggest you do the same, Heywood.’Floyd knew a direct order when he heard it, and nodded in wry agreement.‘I’ll be more than happy to go along with that. But I’d like to make onesuggestion.’‘Yes?’‘We should start contingency planning. Let’s assume that this warning is valid -as I certainly do.’‘What can we do about it? Absolutely nothing. Of course, we can leave Jupiterspace anytime we like - but we can’t get into an Earth-return orbit until thelaunch window opens.’‘That’s eleven days after the deadline!’‘Yes. I’d be happy to get away sooner; but we don’t have the fuel for ahigher-energy orbit…’ Tanya’s voice trailed away into uncharacteristicindecision. ‘I was going to announce this later, but now that the subject hascome up…’There was a simultaneous intake of breath, and an instant hush from theaudience.‘I’d like to delay our departure five days, to make our orbit closer to theideal Hohmann one and give us a better fuel reserve.’The announcement was not unexpected, but it was greeted with a chorus of groans.‘What will that do to our arrival time?’ asked Katerina, in a slightly ominoustone of voice. The two formidable ladies regarded each other for a moment likewell-matched adversaries, respectful of each other but neither willing to giveground.‘Ten days,’ Tanya answered at last.‘Better late than never,’ said Max cheerfully, trying to ease the tension, andnot succeeding very well.Floyd hardly noticed; he was lost in his own thoughts. The duration of the tripwould make no difference to him and his two colleagues, in their dreamlesssleep. But that was now completely unimportant.He felt certain - and the knowledge filled him with helpless despair - that ifthey did not leave before that mysterious deadline, they would not leave at all.‘… This is an incredible situation, Dimitri, and a very frightening one. You’rethe only person on Earth who knows about it - but very soon Tanya and I willhave to have a showdown with Mission Control.‘Even some of your materialistic countrymen are prepared to accept - at least asa working hypothesis - that some entity has - well, invaded Hal. Sasha has dugup a good phrase: “The Ghost in the Machine”.‘Theories abound; Vasili produces a new one every day. Most of them arevariations on that old science-fiction cliché, the organized energy field. Butwhat kind of energy? It can’t be electrical, or our instruments would havedetected it easily. The same thing applies to radiation - at least all the kindswe know. Vasili’s getting really far-out, talking about standing waves ofneutrinos and intersections with higher-dimensional space. Tanya says this isall mystical nonsense - a favourite phrase of hers - and they’ve come closer toa fight than we’ve ever seen them. We actually heard them shouting at each otherlast night. Not good for morale.‘I’m afraid we’re all tense and overwrought. This warning, and the delayeddeparture date, has added to the sense of frustration caused by our totalfailure to get anywhere with Big Brother. It would have helped - maybe - if Icould have communicated with the Bowman thing. I wonder where it’s gone? Perhapsit simply wasn’t interested in us after that one encounter. What it could havetold us, if it wanted to! Hell and chyort vozmi! Damn - I’m talking Sasha’shated Russlish again. Let’s change the subject.‘I can’t thank you too much for everything you’ve done, and for reporting on thesituation at home. I feel slightly better about it now - having something evenbigger to worry about is perhaps the best cure for any insoluble problem.‘For the first time, I’m beginning to wonder if any of us will ever see Earthagain.’"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWO43"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWOTHOUGHT EXPERIMENTWhen one spends months with a small, isolated group of people, one becomes verysensitive to the moods and emotional states of all its members. Floyd was nowaware of a subtle change in attitude toward him; its most obvious manifestationwas the reappearance of the greeting ‘Dr Floyd’, which he had not heard for solong that he was often slow to respond to it.No one, he was sure, believed that he had really gone crazy; but the possibilitywas being considered. He did not resent that; indeed, he was grimly amused by itas he set about the task of proving his sanity.He did have some slight supporting evidence from Earth. José Fernandez stillmaintained that his wife had reported an encounter with David Bowman, while shecontinued to deny it and refused to speak to any of the news media. It was hardto see why poor José should have invented such a peculiar story, especially asBetty seemed a very stubborn and quick-tempered lady. From his hospital bed, herhusband declared that he still loved her and theirs was only a temporarydisagreement.Floyd hoped that Tanya’s present coolness toward him was equally temporary. Hewas quite sure that she was as unhappy about it as he was, and he was certainthat her attitude was not a matter of deliberate choice. Something had happenedthat simply would not fit into her pattern of beliefs, so she would try to avoidany reminders of it. Which meant having as little to do with Floyd as possible -a very unfortunate situation now that the most critical stage of the mission wasfast approaching.It had not been easy to explain the logic of Tanya’s operational plan to thewaiting billions back on Earth - especially to the impatient televisionnetworks, which had grown tired of showing the same never-changing views of BigBrother. ‘You’ve gone all this way, at enormous cost, and you just sit and watchthe thing! Why don’t you do something?’ To all these critics Tanya had given thesame answer: ‘I will - just as soon as the launch window opens, so that we canleave immediately if there’s any adverse reaction.’Plans for the final assault on Big Brother had already been worked out andagreed upon with Mission Control. Leonov would move in slowly, probing at allfrequencies, and with steadily increasing power - constantly reporting back toEarth at every moment. When final contact was made, they would try to securesamples by drilling or laser spectroscopy; no one really expected theseendeavours to succeed, as even after a decade of study TMA-1 resisted allattempts to analyse its material. The best efforts of human scientists in thisdirection seemed comparable to those of Stone Age men trying to break throughthe armour of a bank vault with flint axes.Finally, echo sounders and other seismic devices would be attached to the facesof Big Brother. A large collection of adhesives had been brought along for thepurpose, and if they did not work - well, one could always fall back on a fewkilometres of good, old-fashioned string, even though there seemed somethingfaintly comic about the idea of wrapping up the Solar System’s greatest mystery,as if it were a parcel about to be sent through the mail.Not until Leonov was well on the way home would small explosive charges bedetonated, in the hope that the waves propagated through Big Brother wouldreveal something about its interior structure. This last measure had been hotlydebated, both by those who argued that it would generate no results at all - andthose who feared it would produce altogether too many.For a long time, Floyd had wavered between the two viewpoints; now the matterseemed only of trivial importance.The time for final contact with Big Brother - the great moment that should havebeen the climax of the expedition - was on the wrong side of the mysteriousdeadline. Heywood Floyd was convinced that it belonged to a future that wouldnever exist; but he could get no one to agree with him.And that was the least of his problems. Even if they did agree, there wasnothing that they could do about it.Walter Curnow was the last person he would have expected to resolve the dilemma.For Walter was almost the epitome of the sound, practical engineer, suspiciousof flashes of brilliance and technological quick-fixes. No one would ever accusehim of being a genius; and sometimes it required genius to see the blindinglyobvious.‘Consider this purely as an intellectual exercise,’ he had begun, with mostuncharacteristic hesitancy. ‘I’m quite prepared to be shot down.’‘Go on,’ answered Floyd. ‘I’ll hear you out politely. That’s the least I can do- everyone’s been very polite to me. Too polite, I’m afraid.’Curnow gave a lopsided grin.‘Can you blame them? But if it’s any consolation, at least three people now takeyou quite seriously, and are wondering what we should do.’‘Does that three include you?’‘No; I’m sitting on the fence, which is never terribly comfortable. But in caseyou’re right - I don’t want to wait here and take whatever’s coming. I believethere’s an answer to every problem, if you look in the right place.’‘I’ll be delighted to hear it. I’ve been looking hard enough. Presumably not inthe right place.’‘Perhaps. If we want to make a quick getaway - say in fifteen days, to beat thatdeadline - we’ll need an extra delta-vee of about thirty kilometres a second.’‘So Vasili calculates. I haven’t bothered to check, but I’m sure he’s right.After all, he got us here.’‘And he could get us away - if we had the additional propellant.’‘And if we had a Star Trek beam transporter, we could get back to Earth in anhour.’‘I’ll try and rig one up the next time I have a spare moment. But meanwhile, mayI point out that we have several hundred tons of the best possible propellant,only a few metres away in Discovery’s fuel tanks.’‘We’ve been through that dozens of times. There’s absolutely no way oftransferring it to Leonov. We’ve no pipelines - no suitable pumps. And you can’tcarry liquid ammonia around in buckets, even in this part of the Solar System.’‘Exactly. But there’s no need to do so.’‘Eh?’‘Burn it right where it is. Use Discovery as a first stage, to boost us home.’If anyone except Walter Curnow had made the suggestion, Floyd would have laughedat him. As it was, his mouth dropped open and it was several seconds before hecould think of a suitable comment. What finally emerged was: ‘Damn. I shouldhave thought of that.’Sasha was the first they approached. He listened patiently, pursed his lips,then played a rallentando on his computer keyboard. When the answers flashed up,he nodded thoughtfully.‘You’re right. It would give us the extra velocity we need to leave early. Butthere are practical problems -’‘We know. Fastening the ships together. The off-axis thrust when onlyDiscovery’s drive is operating. Cutting loose again at the critical moment. Butthere are answers to all of these.’‘I see you’ve been doing your homework. But it’s a waste of time. You’ll neverconvince Tanya.’‘I don’t expect to - at this stage,’ Floyd answered. ‘But I’d like her to knowthat the possibility exists. Will you give us moral support?’‘I’m not sure. But I’ll come along to watch; it should be interesting.’Tanya listened more patiently than Floyd had expected, but with distinct lack ofenthusiasm. However, by the time he had finished, she showed what could only becalled reluctant admiration.‘Very ingenious, Heywood -,‘Don’t congratulate me. All the credit should go to Walter. Or the blame.’‘I don’t imagine there will be much of either; it can never be more than a -what did Einstein call that sort of thing? - “thought experiment”. Oh, I suspectit would work - in theory, at least. But the risks! So many things could gowrong. I’d only be prepared to consider it if we had absolute and positive proofthat we were in danger. And with all respect, Heywood, I see not the slightestevidence of that.’‘Fair enough; but at least you now know that we have another option. Do you mindif we work out the practical details - just in case?’‘Of course not - as long as it doesn’t interfere with the preflight checkout. Idon’t mind admitting that the idea does intrigue me. But it’s really a waste oftime; there’s no way I’d ever approve it. Unless David Bowman appeared to mepersonally.’‘Would you even then, Tanya?’Captain Orlova smiled, but without much humour. ‘You know, Heywood - I’m reallynot sure. He’d have to be very persuasive.’"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWO44"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWOVANISHING TRICKIt was a fascinating game in which everyone joined - but only when off duty.Even Tanya contributed ideas to the ‘thought experiment’, as she continued tocall it.Floyd was perfectly well aware that all the activity was generated not by fearof an unknown danger that only he took seriously, but by the delightful prospectof returning to Earth at least a month earlier than anyone had imagined.Whatever the motive, he was satisfied. He had done his best, and the rest was upto the Fates.There was one piece of luck, without which the whole project would have beenstillborn. The short, stubby Leonov, designed to drill safely through the Jovianatmosphere during the braking manoeuvre, was less than half the length ofDiscovery and so could be neatly piggybacked on the larger vessel, And themidships antenna mount would provide an excellent anchor point - assuming thatit was strong enough to take the strain of Leonov’s weight while Discovery’sdrive was operating.Mission Control was sorely puzzled by some of the requests flashed back to Earthduring the next few’ days. Stress analyses of both ships, under peculiar loads;effects of off-axis thrusts; location of unusually strong or weak points in thehulls - these were only some of the more esoteric problems the perplexedengineers were asked to tackle. ‘Has something gone wrong?’ they inquiredanxiously.‘Not at all,’ Tanya replied. ‘We’re merely investigating possible options. Thankyou for your cooperation. End of transmission.’Meanwhile, the programme went ahead as planned. All systems were carefullychecked in both ships, and readied for the separate voyages home; Vasili ransimulations on return trajectories and Chandra fed them to Hal when they hadbeen debugged - getting Hal to make a final check in the process. And Tanya andFloyd worked amicably together orchestrating the approach to Big Brother likegenerals planning an invasion.It was what he had come all the way to do, yet Floyd’s heart was no longer init. He had undergone an experience he could share with no one - even those whobelieved him. Though he carried out his duties efficiently, much of the time hismind was elsewhere.Tanya understood perfectly.‘You’re still hoping for that miracle to convince me, aren’t you?’‘Or deconvince me - that would be equally acceptable. It’s the uncertainty thatI dislike.’‘So do I. But it won’t be much longer now - one way or the other.’She glanced briefly toward the situation display, where the figure 20 was slowlyflashing. It was the most unnecessary bit of information in the entire ship,since everyone knew by heart the number of days until the launch window opened.And the assault on Zagadka was scheduled.For the second time, Heywood Floyd was looking the other way when it happened.But it would have made no difference in any case; even the vigilant monitorcamera showed only a faint blur between one full frame and the subsequent blankone.Once more he was on duty aboard Discovery, sharing the graveyard shift withSasha over on Leonov. As usual, the night had been totally uneventful; theautomatic systems were performing their jobs with their normal efficiency. Floydwould never have believed, a year ago, that he would one day orbit Jupiter at adistance of a few hundred thousand kilometres and give it barely a glance -while trying; not very successfully, to read The Kreutzer Sonata in theoriginal. According to Sasha, it was still the finest piece of erotic fiction in(respectable) Russian literature, but Floyd had not yet progressed far enough toprove that. And now he never would.At 0125 he was distracted by a spectacular, though not unusual, eruption on theterminator of Io. A vast umbrella-shaped cloud expanded into space, and startedto shower its debris back on to the burning land below. Floyd had seen dozens ofsuch eruptions, but they never ceased to fascinate him. It seemed incrediblethat so small a world could be the seat of such titanic energies.To get a better view, he moved around to one of the other observation windows.And what he saw there - or, rather, what he did not see there - made him forgetabout Io, and almost everything else.When he had recovered, and satisfied himself that he was not suffering - again?- from hallucinations, he called the other ship.‘Good morning, Woody,’ yawned Sasha. ‘No - I wasn’t asleep. How are you gettingon with old Tolstoi?’‘I’m not. Take a look outside and tell me what you see.’‘Nothing unusual, for this part of the cosmos. Io doing its thing. Jupiter.Stars. Oh my God!’‘Thanks for proving I’m sane. We’d better wake the skipper.’‘Of course. And everyone else. Woody - I’m scared.’‘You’d be a fool not to be. Here we go. Tanya? Tanya? Woody here. Sorry to wakeyou up - but your miracle’s happened. Big Brother has gone. Yes - vanished.After three million years, he’s decided to leave.‘I think he must know something that we don’t.’It was a sombre little group that gathered, during the next fifteen minutes, fora hasty conference in the wardroom-cum-observation lounge. Even those who hadjust gone to sleep were instantly awake, as they sipped thoughtfully from bulbsof hot coffee - and kept glancing at the shockingly unfamiliar scene outsideLeonov’s windows, to convince themselves that Big Brother had indeed vanished.‘It must know something that we don’t.’ That spontaneous phrase of Floyd’s hadbeen repeated by Sasha and now hung silently, ominously, in the air. He hadsummed up what everyone was now thinking - even Tanya.It was still too early to say ‘I told you so’ - nor did it really matter whetherthat warning had any validity. Even if it was perfectly safe to stay, there wasno point in doing so. With nothing to investigate, they might as well go home,just as quickly as possible. Yet it was not quite as simple as that.‘Heywood,’ said Tanya, ‘I’m now prepared to take that message, or whatever itwas, much more seriously. I’d be stupid not to after what’s happened. But evenif there is danger here, we still have to weigh one risk against another.Coupling Leonov and Discovery together, operating Discovery with that hugeoff-axis load, disconnecting the ships in a matter of minutes so we can fire ourengines at the right moment; no responsible captain would take such chanceswithout very good - I’d say overwhelming - reasons. Even now, I don’t have suchreasons. I’ve only got the word of … a ghost. Not very good evidence in a courtof law.’‘Or a court of inquiry,’ said Walter Curnow, in an unusually quiet voice, ‘evenif we all backed you up.’‘Yes, Walter - I was thinking of that. But if we get home safely, that willjustify everything - and if we don’t, it hardly matters, does it? Anyway, I’mnot going to decide now. As soon as we’ve reported this, I’m going back to bed.I’ll give you my decision in the morning after I’ve slept on it. Heywood, Sasha,will you come up to the bridge with me? We have to wake up Mission Control,before you go back on watch.’The night had not yet finished with its surprises. Somewhere around the orbit ofMars, Tanya’s brief report passed a message going in the opposite direction.Betty Fernandez had talked at last, Both the CIA and the National SecurityAgency were furious; their combined blandishments, appeals to patriotism, andveiled threats had failed completely - yet the producer of a sleazy gossipnetwork had succeeded, thereby making himself immortal in the annals ofVideodom.It was half luck, half inspiration. The news director of ‘Hello, Earth!’ hadsuddenly realized that one of his staff bore a striking likeness to DavidBowman; a clever makeup artist had made it perfect. José Fernandez could havetold the young man that he was taking a terrible risk, but he had the goodfortune that often favours the brave. Once he had got his foot inside the door,Betty had capitulated. By the time she had - quite gently - thrown him out, hehad obtained essentially the whole story. And to do him credit, he had presentedit with a lack of leering cynicism quite uncharacteristic of his network. It gothim that year’s Pulitzer.‘I wish,’ Floyd said rather wearily to Sasha, ’she’d talked earlier. It wouldhave saved me a lot of trouble. Anyway, that settles the argument. Tanya can’tpossibly have any doubts now. But we’ll leave it until she wakes up - don’t youagree?’‘Of course - it’s not urgent, even though it’s certainly important. And she’llneed the sleep. I have a feeling none of us will get much from now on.’I’m sure you’re right, thought Floyd. He felt very tired, but even if he had notbeen on duty he would have found it impossible to sleep. His mind was tooactive, analysing the events of this extraordinary night, trying to anticipatethe next surprise.In one way, he felt an enormous sense of relief: All uncertainty about theirdeparture was surely ended; Tanya could have no further reservations.But a much greater uncertainty remained. What was happening?There was only one experience in Floyd’s life that matched the situation. As avery young man, he had once gone canoeing with some friends down a tributary ofthe Colorado River - and they had lost their way.They had been swept faster and faster between the canyon walls, not completelyhelpless, but with only enough control to avoid being swamped. Ahead might berapids - perhaps even a waterfall; they did not know. And in any case, there waslittle they could do about it.Once again, Floyd felt himself in the grip of irresistible forces, sweeping himand his companions toward an unknown destiny. And this time the dangers were notonly invisible; they might be beyond human comprehension."},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWO45"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWOESCAPE MANOEUVRE‘This is Heywood Floyd, making what I suspect - indeed, hope - will be my lastreport from Lagrange.‘We are now preparing for the return home; in a few days we will leave thisstrange place, here on the line between Io and Jupiter where we made ourrendezvous with the huge, mysteriously vanished artifact we christened BigBrother. There is still not a single clue as to where it has gone - or why.‘For various reasons, it seems desirable for us not to remain here longer thannecessary. And we will be able to leave at least two weeks earlier than we hadoriginally planned by using the American ship Discovery as a booster for theRussian Leonov.‘The basic idea is simple; the two ships will be joined together, one mountedpiggyback on the other. Discovery will burn all its propellant first,accelerating both vessels in the desired direction. When its fuel is exhausted,it will be cut loose - like an empty first stage - and Leonov will start to fireits engines. It won’t use them earlier, because if it did it would waste energydragging along the dead weight of Discovery.‘And we’re going to use another trick, which - like so many of the conceptsinvolved in space travel - at first sight seems to defy common sense. Althoughwe’re trying to get away from Jupiter, our first move is to get as close to itas we possibly can.‘We’ve been there once before, of course, when we used Jupiter’s atmosphere toslow us down and get into orbit around the planet. This time we won’t go quiteso close - but very nearly.‘Our first burn, up here in the 350,000-kilometres-high orbit of Io, will reduceour velocity, so that we fall down to Jupiter and just graze its atmosphere.Then, when we’re at the closest possible point, we’ll burn all our fuel asquickly as we can, to increase speed and inject Leonov into the orbit back toEarth.‘What’s the point of such a crazy manoeuvre? It can’t be justified except byhighly complex mathematics, but I think the basic principle can be made fairlyobvious.‘As we allow ourselves to fall into Jupiter’s enormous gravity field, we’ll gainvelocity - and hence energy. When I say “we”, I mean the ships and the fuel theycarry.‘And we’re going to burn the fuel right there - at the bottom of Jupiter’s“gravity well” - we’re not going to lift it up again. As we blast it out fromour reactors, it will share some of its acquired kinetic energy with us.Indirectly, we’ll have tapped Jupiter’s gravity, to speed us on the way back toEarth. As we used the atmosphere to get rid of our excess velocity when wearrived, this is one of the rare cases when Mother Nature - usually so frugal -allows us to have it both ways.‘With this triple boost - Discovery’s fuel, its own, and Jupiter’s gravity -Leonov will head sunward along a hyperbola that will bring it to Earth fivemonths later. At least two months earlier than we could have managed otherwise.‘You will doubtless wonder what will happen to the good old Discovery.Obviously, we can’t bring it home under automatic control, as we had originallyplanned. With no fuel, it will be helpless.‘But it will be perfectly safe. It will continue to loop round and round Jupiteron a highly elongated ellipse, like a trapped comet. And perhaps one day somefuture expedition may make another rendezvous, with enough extra fuel to bringit back to Earth. However, that certainly won’t happen for a good many years.‘And now we must get ready for our departure. There is still much work to bedone, and we won’t be able to relax until that final burn starts us on thehomeward orbit.‘We won’t be sorry to leave, even though we’ve not achieved all our objectives.The mystery - perhaps the threat - of Big Brother’s disappearance still hauntsus, but there’s nothing we can do about that.‘We’ve done our best - and we’re coming home. ‘This is Heywood Floyd, signingoff.’There was a round of ironic clapping from his little audience, whose size wouldbe multiplied many million-fold when the message reached Earth.‘I’m not talking to you,’ retorted Floyd, with slight embarrassment. ‘I didn’twant you to hear it, anyway.’‘You did your usual competent job, Heywood,’ said Tanya consolingly. ‘And I’msure we all agree with everything you told the people back on Earth.’‘Not quite,’ said a small voice, so softly that everyone had to strain in orderto hear it. ‘There is still one problem.’The observation lounge suddenly became very silent. For the first time in weeks,Floyd became aware of the faint throbbing from the main air-supply duct, and theintermittent buzz that might have been made by a wasp trapped behind a wallpanel. Leonov, like all spacecraft, was full of such often inexplicable sounds,which one seldom noticed except when they stopped. And then it was usually agood idea to start investigating without further ado.‘I’m not aware of any problem, Chandra,’ said Tanya in an ominously calm voice.‘What could it possibly be?’‘I’ve spent the last few weeks preparing Hal to fly thousand-day orbits back toEarth. Now all those programs will have to be dumped.’‘We’re sorry about that,’ answered Tanya, ‘but as things have turned out, surelythis is a much better -’‘That’s not what I mean,’ said Chandra. There was a ripple of astonishment; hehad never before been known to interrupt anyone, least of all Tanya.‘We know how sensitive Hal is to mission objectives,’ he continued in theexpectant hush that followed. ‘Now you are asking me to give him a program thatmay result in his own destruction. It’s true that the present plan will putDiscovery into a stable orbit - but if that warning has any substance, what willhappen to the ship eventually? We don’t know, of course - but it’s scared usaway. Have you considered Hal’s reaction to this situation?’‘Are you seriously suggesting,’ Tanya asked very slowly, ‘that Hal may refuse toobey orders - exactly as on the earlier mission?’‘That is not what happened last time. He did his best to interpret conflictingorders.’‘This time there need be no conflict. The situation is perfectly clear-cut.’‘To us, perhaps. But one of Hal’s prime directives is to keep Discovery out ofdanger. We will be attempting to override that. And in a system as complex asHal’s, it is impossible to predict all the consequences.’‘I don’t see any real problem,’ Sasha interjected. ‘We just don’t tell him thatthere is any danger. Then he’ll have no reservations about carrying out hisprogram.’‘Baby-sitting a psychotic computer!’ muttered Curnow. ‘I feel I’m in a Grade-Bscience-fiction videodrama.’ Dr Chandra gave him an unfriendly glare.‘Chandra,’ Tanya demanded suddenly. ‘Have you discussed this with Hal?’‘No.’Was there a slight hesitation? Floyd wondered. It might have been perfectlyinnocent; Chandra could have been checking his memory. Or he could have beenlying, improbable though that seemed.‘Then we’ll do what Sasha suggests. Just load the new program into him, andleave it at that.’‘And when he questions me about the change of plan?’ ‘Is he likely to do that -without your prompting?’‘Of course. Please remember that he was designed for curiosity. If the crew waskilled, he had to be capable of running a useful mission, on his owninitiative.’Tanya thought that over for a few moments.‘It’s still quite a simple matter. He’ll believe you, won’t he?’‘Certainly.’‘Then you must tell him that Discovery is in no danger, and that there will be arendezvous mission to bring it back to Earth at a later date.’‘But that is not true.’‘We don’t know that it’s false,’ replied Tanya, beginning to sound a littleimpatient.‘We suspect that there is serious danger; otherwise we would not be planning toleave ahead of schedule.’‘Then what do you suggest?’ Tanya asked, in a voice that now held a distinctnote of menace.‘We must tell him the whole truth, as far as we know it - no more lies orhalf-truths, which are just as bad. And then let him decide for himself.’‘Hell, Chandra - he’s only a machine!’Chandra looked at Max with such a steady, confident gaze that the younger manquickly dropped his eyes.‘So are we all, Mr Brailovsky. It is merely a matter of degree. Whether we arebased on carbon or on silicon makes no fundamental difference; we should each betreated with appropriate respect.’It was strange, thought Floyd, how Chandra - much the smallest person in theroom - now seemed the largest. But the confrontation had gone on far too long.At any moment Tanya would start to issue direct orders, and the situation wouldbecome really nasty.‘Tanya, Vasili - can I have a word with you both? I think there is a way ofresolving the problem.’Floyd’s interruption was received with obvious relief, and two minutes later hewas relaxing with the Orlovs in their quarters. (Or ’sixteenths’, as Curnow hadonce christened them because of their size. He had soon regretted the pun,because he had to explain it to everyone except Sasha.)‘Thank you, Woody,’ said Tanya, as she handed him a bulb of his favouriteAzerbaijan Shemakha. ‘I was hoping you’d do that. I suppose you have something -how do you put it? - up your sleeve.’‘I believe so,’ Floyd answered, squirting a few cubic centimetres of the sweetwine into his mouth and savouring it gratefully. ‘I’m sorry if Chandra is beingdifficult.’‘So am I. What a good thing we have only one mad scientist aboard.’‘That’s not what you’ve sometimes told me,’ grinned Academician Vasili. ‘Anyway,Woody - let’s have it.’‘This is what I suggest. Let Chandra go ahead and do it his way. Then there arejust two possibilities.‘First, Hal will do exactly what we ask - control Discovery during the twofiring periods. Remember, the first isn’t critical. If something goes wrongwhile we’re pulling away from Io, there’s plenty of time to make corrections.And that will give us a good test of Hal’s… willingness to cooperate.’‘But what about the Jupiter flyby? That’s the one that really counts. Not onlydo we burn most of Discovery’s fuel there, but the timing and thrust vectorshave to be exactly right.’‘Could they be controlled manually?’‘I’d hate to try. The slightest error, and we’d either burn up, or become along-period comet. Due again in a couple of thousand years.’‘But if there was no alternative?’ Floyd insisted.‘Well, assuming we could take control in time, and had a good set of alternativeorbits precomputed - um, perhaps we might get away with it.’‘Knowing you, Vasili, I’m sure that “might” means “would”. Which leads me to thesecond possibility I mentioned. If Hal shows the slightest deviation from theprogram - we take over.’‘You mean - disconnect him?’‘Exactly.’‘That wasn’t so easy last time.’‘We’ve learned a few lessons since then. Leave it to me. I can guarantee to giveyou back manual control in about half a second.’‘There’s no danger, I suppose, that Hal will suspect anything?’‘Now you’re getting paranoiac, Vasili. Hal’s not that human. But Chandra is - togive him the benefit of the doubt. So don’t say a word to him. We all agree withhis plan completely, are sorry that we ever raised any objections, and areperfectly confident that Hal will see our point of view. Right, Tanya?’‘Right, Woody. And I congratulate you on your foresight; that little gadget wasa good idea.’‘What gadget?’ asked Vasili.‘I’ll explain one of these days. Sorry, Woody - that’s all the Shemakha you canhave. I want to save it - until we’re safely on the way to Earth.’"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWO46"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWOCOUNTDOWNNo one would ever believe this without my photos, thought Max Brailovsky as heorbited the two ships from half a kilometre away. It seems comically indecent,as if Leonov is raping Discovery. And now that he came to think of it, therugged, compact Russian ship did look positively male, when compared with thedelicate, slender American one. But most docking operations had distinctlysexual overtones, and he remembered that one of the early cosmonauts - hecouldn’t recall the name - had been reprimanded for his too vivid choice ofwords at the - er, climax of his mission.As far as he could tell from his careful survey, everything was in order. Thetask of positioning the two ships and securing them firmly together had takenlonger than anticipated. It would never have been possible at all without one ofthose strokes of luck that sometimes - not always -favour those who deservethem. Leonov had providentially carried several kilometres of carbon filamenttape, no bigger than the ribbon a girl might use to tie her hair, yet capable oftaking a strain of many tons. It had been thoughtfully provided to secureinstrument packages to Big Brother if all else failed. Now it wrapped Leonov andDiscovery in tender embrace - sufficiently firmly, it was hoped, to prevent anyrattlings and shakings at all accelerations up to the one-tenth of a gravitythat was the maximum that full thrust could provide.‘Anything more you want me to check before I come home?’ asked Max.‘No,’ replied Tanya. ‘Everything looks fine. And we can’t waste any more time.’That was true enough. If that mysterious warning was to be taken seriously - andeveryone now took it very seriously indeed - they should start their escapemanoeuvre within the next twenty-four hours.‘Right - I’m bringing Nina back to the stable. Sorry about this, old girl.’‘You never told us Nina was a horse.’‘I’m not admitting it now. And I feel bad about dumping her here in space, justto give us a miserable few extra metres per second.’‘We may be very glad of them in a few hours, Max. Anyway, there’s always achance that someone may come and pick her up again, one day.’I very much doubt it, thought Max. And perhaps, after all, it was appropriate toleave the little space pod there, as a permanent reminder of Man’s first visitto the kingdom of Jupiter.With gentle, carefully timed pulses from the control jets he brought Nina aroundthe great sphere of Discovery’s main life-support module; his colleagues on theflight deck barely glanced at him as he drifted past their curving window. Theopen Pod Bay door yawned before him, and he jockeyed Nina delicately down on tothe extended docking arm.‘Pull me in,’ he said, as soon as the latches had clicked shut. ‘I call that awell-planned EVA. There’s a whole kilogram of propellant left to take Nina outfor the last time.’Normally, there was little drama about a burn in deep space; it was not like thefire and thunder - and always present risks - of a lift-off from a planetarysurface. If something went wrong, and the motors failed to come up to fullthrust - well, matters could usually be corrected by a slightly longer burn. Orone could wait until the appropriate point in orbit, and try again.But this time, as the countdown proceeded toward zero, the tension aboard bothships was almost palpable. Everyone knew that it was the first real test ofHal’s docility; only Floyd, Curnow, and the Orlovs realized that there was aback-up system. And even they were not absolutely sure that it would work.‘Good luck, Leonov,’ said Mission Control, timing the message to arrive fiveminutes before ignition. ‘Hope everything’s running smoothly. And if it’s nottoo much trouble, could you please get some close-ups of the equator, longitude115, as you go around Jupiter. There’s a curious dark spot there - presumablysome kind of upwelling, perfectly round, almost a thousand kilometres across.Looks like the shadow of a satellite, but it can’t be.’Tanya made a brief acknowledgement that managed to convey, in a remarkably fewwords, a profound lack of interest in the meteorology of Jupiter at that moment.Mission Control sometimes showed a perfect genius for tactlessness and poortiming.‘All systems functioning normally,’ said Hal. ‘Two minutes to ignition.’Strange, thought Floyd, how terminology often survives long after the technologythat gave it birth. Only chemical rockets were capable of ignition; even if thehydrogen in a nuclear or plasma drive did come into contact with oxygen, itwould be far too hot to burn. At such temperatures, all compounds were strippedback into their elements.His mind wandered, seeking other examples. People - particularly older ones -still spoke of putting film into a camera, or gas into a car. Even the phrase‘cutting a tape’ was still sometimes heard in recording studios - though thatembraced two generations of obsolete technologies.‘One minute to ignition.’His mind flashed back to the here and now. This was the minute that counted; foralmost a hundred years, on launch pads and in control centres, this was thelongest sixty seconds that had ever existed. Countless times it had ended indisaster; but only the triumphs were remembered. Which will ours be?The temptation to put his hand once more into the pocket that held the activatorfor the cut-out switch was almost irresistible, even though logic told him therewas plenty of time for remedial action. If Hal failed to obey his programming,that would be a nuisance - not a disaster. The really critical time would bewhen they were rounding Jupiter.‘Six… five… four… three… two… one. IGNITION!’At first, the thrust was barely perceptible; it took almost a minute to build upto the full tenth of a gee. Nevertheless, everyone started clapping immediately,until Tanya signalled for silence. There were many checks to be made; even ifHal was doing his best - as he certainly seemed to be - there was so much thatcould still go wrong.Discovery’s antenna mount - which was now taking most of the strain fromLeonov’s inertia - had never been intended for such mistreatment. The ship’schief designer, called out of retirement, had sworn that the safety margin wasadequate. But he might be wrong, and materials had been known to become brittleafter years in space.And the tapes holding the two ships together might not have been locatedaccurately; they might stretch or slip. Discovery might not be able to correctfor the off-centre of mass, now that it was carrying a thousand tons piggyback.Floyd could imagine a dozen things that could go wrong; it was littleconsolation to remember that it was always the thirteenth that actuallyhappened.But the minutes dragged on uneventfully; the only proof that Discovery’s engineswere operating was the fractional, thrust-induced gravity and a very slightvibration transmitted through the walls of the ships. Io and Jupiter still hungwhere they had been for weeks, on opposite sides of the sky.‘Cut-off in ten seconds. Nine… eight… seven… six… five… four… three,.. two…NOW!’‘Thank you, Hal, On the button.’Now that was another phrase that was badly dated; for at least a generation,touch pads had almost entirely replaced buttons. But not for all applications;in critical cases, it was best to have a device that moved perceptibly with anice, satisfying click.‘I confirm that,’ said Vasili. ‘No need for any corrections until mid-course.’‘Say goodbye to glamorous, exotic Io - real estate agent’s dream world,’ saidCurnow. ‘We’ll all be happy to miss you.’That sounds more like the old Walter, Floyd told himself. For the last fewweeks, he had been oddly subdued, as if he had something on his mind. (But whodid not?) He seemed to spend a good deal of his scanty free time in quietdiscussions with Katerina: Floyd hoped that he had not developed some medicalproblem. They had been very lucky so far on that score; the last thing theyneeded at this stage was an emergency that required the Surgeon-Commander’sexpertise.‘You’re being unkind, Walter,’ said Brailovsky. ‘I was beginning to like theplace. It might be fun to go boating on those lava lakes.’‘What about a volcano barbecue?’‘Or genuine molten sulphur baths?’Everyone was lighthearted, even a little hysterical with relief. Though it wasfar too early to relax and the most critical phase of the escape manoeuvre stilllay ahead, the first step had been safely taken on the long journey home. Thatwas cause enough for a little modest rejoicing.It did not last long, for Tanya quickly ordered all those not on essential dutyto get some rest - if possible, some sleep - in preparation for the Jupiterswing-by only nine hours ahead. When those addressed were slow to move, Sashacleared the decks by shouting, ‘You’ll hang for this, you mutinous dogs!’ Onlytwo nights before, as a rare relaxation, they had all enjoyed the fourth versionof Mutiny on the Bounty, generally agreed by movie historians to have the bestCaptain Bligh since the fabled Charles Laughton. There was some feeling on boardthat Tanya should not have seen it, lest it give her ideas.After a couple of restless hours in his cocoon, Floyd abandoned the quest forsleep and wandered up to the observation deck. Jupiter was much larger andslowly waning as the ships hurtled toward their closest approach over thenightside. A glorious, gibbous disk, it showed such an infinite wealth of detail- cloud belts, spots of every colour from dazzling white to brick red, darkupwellings from the unknown depths, the cyclonic oval of the Great Red Spot-that the eye could not possibly absorb it all. The round, dark shadow of onemoon - probably Europa, Floyd guessed - was in transit. He was seeing thisincredible sight for the last time; even though he had to be at maximumefficiency in six hours, it was a crime to waste precious moments in sleep.Where was that spot that Mission Control had asked them to observe? It shouldhave been coming into view, but Floyd was not sure if it would be visible to thenaked eye. Vasili would be too busy to bother about it; perhaps he could help bydoing a little amateur astronomy. There had, after all, been a brief time, onlythirty years ago, when he had earned his living as a professional.He activated the controls of the main fifty-centimetre telescope - fortunately,the field of view was not blocked by the adjacent bulk of Discovery - andscanned along the equator at medium power. And there it was, just coming overthe edge of the disk.By force of circumstance, Floyd was now one of the Solar System’s ten greatestexperts on Jupiter; the other nine were working or sleeping around him. He sawat once that there was something very odd about this spot; it was so black thatit looked like a hole punched through the clouds. From his point of view itappeared to be a sharp-edged ellipse; Floyd guessed that from directly above, itwould be a perfect circle.He recorded a few images, then increased the power to maximum. Already Jupiter’srapid spin had brought the formation into clearer view; and the more he stared,the more puzzled Floyd became.‘Vasili,’ he called over the intercom, ‘if you can spare a minute - have a lookat the fifty-centimetre monitor.’‘What are you observing? Is it important? I’m checking the orbit.’‘Take your time, of course. But I’ve found that spot Mission Control reported.It looks very peculiar.’‘Hell! I’d forgotten all about it. We’re a fine lot of observers if those guysback on Earth have to tell us where to look. Give me another five minutes - itwon’t run away.’True enough, thought Floyd; in fact it will get clearer. And there was nodisgrace in missing something that terrestrial - or lunar - astronomers hadobserved. Jupiter was very big, they had been very busy, and the telescopes onthe Moon and in Earth orbit were a hundred times more powerful than theinstrument he was using now.But it was getting more and more peculiar. For the first time, Floyd began tofeel a distinct sense of unease. Until that moment, it had never occurred to himthat the spot could be anything but a natural formation - some trick ofJupiter’s incredibly complex meteorology. Now he began to wonder.It was so black, like night itself. And so symmetrical; as it came into clearerview it was obviously a perfect circle. Yet it was not sharply defined; the edgehad an odd fuzziness, as if it was a little out of focus.Was it imagination, or had it grown, even while he was watching? He made a quickestimate, and decided that the thing was now two thousand kilometres across. Itwas only a little smaller than the still-visible shadow of Europa, but was somuch darker that there was no risk of confusion.‘Let’s have a look,’ said Vasili, in a rather condescending tone. ‘What do youthink you’ve found? Oh…’ His voice trailed away into silence.This is it, thought Floyd, with a sudden icy conviction. Whatever it may be."},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWO47"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWOFINAL FLYBYYet on further reflection, after the initial amazement had worn off, it was hardto see how a spreading black stain on the face of Jupiter could represent anykind of danger. It was extraordinary - inexplicable - but not as important asthe critical events now only seven hours in the future. A successful burn atperijove was all that mattered; they would have plenty of time to studymysterious black spots on the way home.And to sleep; Floyd had given up all attempts at that.Though the feeling of danger - at least, of known danger - was much less than ontheir first approach to Jupiter, a mixture of excitement and apprehension kepthim wide awake. The excitement was natural and understandable; the apprehensionhad more complex causes. Floyd made it a rule never to worry about events overwhich he could have absolutely no control; any external threat would revealitself in due time and be dealt with then. But he could not help wondering ifthey had done everything possible to safeguard the ships.Apart from onboard mechanical failures, there were two main sources of concern.Although the tapes that secured Leonov and Discovery together had shown notendency to slip, their severest test was still to come. Almost equally criticalwould be the moment of separation when the smallest of the explosive chargesonce intended to jolt Big Brother would be used at uncomfortably close quarters.And, of course, there was Hal.He had carried out the deorbiting manoeuvre with exquisite precision. He had runthe simulations of the Jupiter flyby, right down to Discovery’s last drop offuel, without any comments or objections. And although Chandra, as agreed, hadcarefully explained what they were trying to do, did Hal really understand whatwas happening?Floyd had one overriding concern, which in the preceding few days had becomealmost an obsession. He could picture everything going perfectly, the shipshalfway through the final manoeuvre, the enormous disk of Jupiter filling thesky only a few hundred kilometres below them - and then Hal electronicallyclearing his throat and saying:‘Dr Chandra, do you mind if I ask you a question?’ It did not happen exactlythat way.The Great Black Spot, as it had been inevitably christened, was now beingcarried out of sight by Jupiter’s swift rotation. In a few hours thestill-accelerating ships would catch up with it over the nightside of theplanet, but this was the last chance for a close daylight observation.It was still growing at an extraordinary speed; in the last two hours, it hadmore than doubled its area. Except for the fact that it retained its blacknessas it expanded, it resembled an ink-stain spreading in water. Its boundary - nowmoving at near-sonic speed in the Jovian atmosphere - still looked curiouslyfuzzy and out of focus; at the very highest power of the ship’s telescope, thereason for this was at last apparent.Unlike the Great Red Spot, the Great Black Spot was not a continuous structure;it was built up from myriads of tiny dots, like a half-tone print viewed througha magnifying glass. Over most of its area, the dots were so closely spaced thatthey were almost touching, but at the rim they became more and more widelyspaced, so that the Spot ended in a grey penumbra rather than at a sharpfrontier.There must have been almost a million of the mysterious dots, and they weredistinctly elongated - ellipses rather than circles. Katerina, the leastimaginative person aboard, surprised everybody by saying that it looked as ifsomeone had taken a sackful of rice, dyed it black, and poured it on the face ofJupiter.And now the Sun was dropping down behind the huge, swiftly narrowing arch of thedayside, as for the second time Leonov raced into the Jovian night for anappointment with destiny. In less than thirty minutes the final burn wouldcommence, and things would start to happen very quickly indeed.Floyd wondered if he should have joined Chandra and Curnow, standing watch onDiscovery. But there was nothing he could do; in an emergency, he would only bein the way. The cut-off switch was in Curnow’s pocket, and Floyd knew that theyounger man’s reactions were a good deal swifter than his own. If Hal showed theslightest sign of misbehaviour, he could be disconnected in less than a second,but Floyd felt certain that such extreme measures would not be necessary. Sincehe had been allowed to do things his own way, Chandra had cooperated completelyin setting up the procedures for a manual takeover, should that unfortunatenecessity arise. Floyd was confident that he could be trusted to carry out hisduty - however much he might regret the need.Curnow was not quite so sure. He would be happier, he had told Floyd, if he hadmultiple redundancy in the form of a second cut-off switch - for Chandra.Meanwhile there was nothing that anyone could do but wait and watch theapproaching cloudscape of the nightside, dimly visible by the reflected light ofpassing satellites, the glow of photo-chemical reactions, and frequent titaniclightning flashes from thunderstorms larger than Earth.The sun winked out behind them, eclipsed in seconds by the immense globe theywere so swiftly approaching. When they saw it again, they should be on their wayhome.‘Twenty minutes to ignition. All systems nominal.’‘Thank you, Hal.’I wonder if Chandra was being quite truthful, thought Curnow, when he said thatHal would be confused if anyone else spoke to him. I’ve talked to him oftenenough, when nobody was around, and he always understood me perfectly. Still,there’s not much time left for friendly conversation now, though it would helpto reduce the strain.What’s Hal really thinking - if he thinks - about the mission? All his life,Curnow had shied away from abstract, philosophical questions: I’m anuts-and-bolts man, he had often claimed, though there were not too many ofeither in a spaceship. Once, he would have laughed at the idea, but now he beganto wonder: Did Hal sense that he would soon be abandoned, and if so, would heresent it? Curnow almost reached for the cut-off switch in his pocket, butchecked himself. He had already done this so often that Chandra might be gettingsuspicious.For the hundredth time, he rehearsed the sequence of events that were due totake place during the next hour. The moment that Discovery’s fuel was exhausted,they would close down all but essential systems, and dash back to Leonov throughthe connecting tube. That would be decoupled, the explosive charges would befired, the ships would drift apart - and Leonov’s own engines would start tofire. The separation should take place, if everything went according to plan,just when they were making their closest approach to Jupiter; that would takemaximum advantage of the planet’s gravitational largesse.‘Fifteen minutes to ignition. All systems nominal.’‘Thank you, Hal.’‘By the way,’ said Vasili, from the other ship, ‘we’re catching up with theGreat Black Spot again. Wonder if we can see anything new.’I rather hope not, thought Curnow; we’ve got quite enough on our hands at themoment. Nevertheless, he gave a quick glance at the image Vasili wastransmitting on the telescope monitor.At first he could see nothing except the faintly glimmering nightside of theplanet; then he saw, on the horizon, a foreshortened circle of deeper darkness.They were rushing toward it with incredible speed.Vasili increased the light amplification, and the entire image brightenedmagically. At last, the Great Black Spot resolved itself into its myriadidentical elements.My God, thought Curnow, I just don’t believe it!He heard exclamations of surprise from Leonov: all the others had shared in thesame revelation at the same moment.‘Dr Chandra,’ said Hal, ‘I detect strong vocal stress patterns. Is there aproblem?’‘No, Hal,’ Chandra answered quickly. ‘The mission is proceeding normally. We’vejust had rather a surprise - that’s all. What do you make of the image onmonitor circuit 16?’‘I see the nightside of Jupiter. There is a circular area, 3,250 kilometres indiameter, which is almost compietely covered with rectangular objects.’‘How many?’There was the briefest of pauses, before Hal flashed the number on the videodisplay:1,355,000 ± 1,000‘And do you recognize them?’‘Yes. They are identical in size and shape to the object you refer to as BigBrother. Ten minutes to ignition. All systems nominal.’Mine aren’t, thought Curnow. So the damn thing’s gone down to Jupiter - andmultiplied. There was something simultaneously comic and sinister about a plagueof black monoliths; and to his puzzled surprise, that incredible image on themonitor screen had a certain weird familiarity.Of course - that was it! Those myriad, identical black rectangles reminded himof - dominoes. Years ago, he had seen a video documentary showing how a team ofslightly crazy Japanese had patiently stood a million dominoes on end, so thatwhen the very first one was toppled, all the others would inevitably follow.They had been arranged in complex patterns, some underwater, some up and downlittle stairways, others along multiple tracks so that they formed pictures andpatterns as they fell. It had taken weeks to set them up; Curnow remembered nowthat earthquakes had several times foiled the enterprise, and the finaltoppling, from first domino to the last, had taken more than an hour.‘Eight minutes to ignition. All systems nominal. Dr Chandra - may I make asuggestion?’‘What is it, Hal?’‘This is a very unusual phenomenon. Do you not think I should abort thecountdown, so that you can remain to study it?’Aboard Leonov, Floyd started to move quickly toward the bridge. Tanya and Vasilimight be needing him. Not to mention Chandra and Curnow - what a situation! Andsuppose Chandra took Hal’s side? If he did - they might both be right! Afterall, was this not the very reason they had come here?If they stopped the countdown, the ships would loop around Jupiter and be backat precisely the same spot in nineteen hours. A nineteen-hour hold would createno problems; if it was not for that enigmatic warning, he would have stronglyrecommended it himself.But they had very much more than a warning. Below them was a planetary plaguespreading across the face of Jupiter. Perhaps they were indeed running away fromthe most extraordinary phenomenon in the history of science. Even so, hepreferred to study it from a safer distance.‘Six minutes to ignition,’ said Hal. ‘All systems nominal. I am ready to stopthe countdown if you agree. Let me remind you that my prime directive is tostudy everything in Jupiter space that may be connected with intelligence.’Floyd recognized that phrase all too well: he had written it himself. He wishedhe could delete it from Hal’s memory.A moment later, he had reached the bridge and joined the Orlovs. They bothlooked at him with alarmed concern.‘What do you recommend?’ asked Tanya swiftly.‘It’s up to Chandra, I’m afraid. Can I speak to him - on the private line?’Vasili handed over the microphone.‘Chandra? I assume that Hal can’t hear this?’‘Correct, Dr Floyd.’‘You’ve got to talk quickly. Persuade him that the countdown must continue, thatwe appreciate his - er, scientific enthusiasm - ah, that’s the right angle - saywe’re confident that he can do the job without our help. And we’ll be in touchwith him all the time, of course.’‘Five minutes to ignition. All systems nominal. I am still waiting for youranswer, Dr Chandra.’So are we all, thought Curnow, only a metre away from the scientist. And if I dohave to push that button at last, it will be something of a relief. In fact,I’ll rather enjoy it.‘Very well, Hal. Continue the countdown. I have every confidence in your abilityto study all phenomena in Jupiter space, without our supervision. Of course, wewill be in touch with you at all times.’‘Four minutes to ignition. All systems nominal. Propellant-tank pressurizationcompleted. Voltage steady on plasma trigger. Are you sure you are making theright decision, Dr Chandra? I enjoy working with human beings and have astimulating relationship with them. Ship’s attitude correct to point onemilliradian.’‘We enjoy working with you, Hal. And we will still be doing so, even if we aremillions of kilometres away.’‘Three minutes to ignition. All systems nominal, Radiation shielding checked.There is a problem of the time lag, Dr Chandra. It may be necessary to consulteach other without any delay.’This is insane, Curnow thought, his hand now never far from the cut-off switch.I really believe that Hal is - lonely. Is he mimicking some part of Chandra’spersonality that we never suspected?The lights flickered, so imperceptibly that only someone familiar with everynuance of Discovery’s behaviour would have noticed. It could be good news or bad- the plasma firing sequence starting, or being terminated…He risked a quick glance at Chandra; the little scientist’s face was drawn andhaggard, and for almost the first time Curnow felt real sympathy for him asanother human being. And he remembered the startling information that Floyd hadconfided in him - Chandra’s offer to stay with the ship, and keep Hal company onthe three-year voyage home. He had heard no more of the idea, and presumably ithad been quietly forgotten after the warning. But perhaps Chandra was beingtempted again; if he was, there was nothing that he could do about it at thatstage. There would be no time to make the necessary preparations, even if theystayed on for another orbit and delayed their departure beyond the deadline.Which Tanya would certainly not permit after all that had now happened.‘Hal,’ whispered Chandra, so quietly that Curnow could scarcely hear him. ‘Wehave to leave. I don’t have time to give you all the reasons, but I can assureyou it’s true.’‘Two minutes to ignition. All systems nominal. Final sequence started. I amsorry that you are unable to stay. Can you give me some of the reasons, in orderof importance?’‘Not in two minutes, Hal. Proceed with the countdown. I will explain everythinglater. We still have more than an hour together.’Hal did not answer. The silence stretched on and on. Surely the one-minuteannouncement was overdue …Curnow glanced at the clock. My God, he thought, Hal’s missed it! Has he stoppedthe countdown?Curnow’s hand fumbled uncertainly for the switch. What do I do now? I wish Floydwould say something, dammit, but he’s probably afraid of making things worse…I’ll wait until time zero - no, it’s not that critical, let’s say an extraminute - then I’ll zap him and we’ll go over to manual…From far, far away there came a faint, whistling scream, like the sound of atornado marching just below the edge of the horizon. Discovery started tovibrate; there was the first intimation of returning gravity.‘Ignition,’ said Hal. ‘Full thrust at T plus fifteen seconds.’‘Thank ,you, Hal,’ replied Chandra."},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWO48"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWOOVER THE NIGHTSIDETo Heywood Floyd, aboard the suddenly unfamiliar - because no longer weightless- environment of Leonov’s flight deck, the sequence of events had seemed morelike a classic slow-motion nightmare than reality. Only once before in his lifehad he known a similar situation, when he had been in the back of a car duringan uncontrollable skid. There had been that same sense of utter helplessness -coupled with the thought: This doesn’t really matter - it’s not actuallyhappening to me.Now that the firing sequence had started, his mood changed; everything seemedreal again. It was working out exactly as they had planned; Hal was guiding themsafely back to Earth. With every minute that passed, their future was becomingmore secure; Floyd began slowly to relax, even though he remained alert to allthat was happening around him.For the very last time - and when would any man come here again? - he was flyingover the nightside of the greatest of planets, encompassing the volume of athousand Earths. The ships had been rolled so that Leonov was between Discoveryand Jupiter, and their view of the mysteriously glimmering cloudscape was notblocked. Even now, dozens of instruments were busily probing and recording; Halwould continue the work when they were gone.Since the immediate crisis was over, Floyd moved cautiously ‘down’ from theflight deck-how strange to feel weight again, even if it was only ten kilos! -and joined Zenia and Katerina in the observation lounge. Apart from the veryfaintest of red emergency lights, it had been completely blacked out so thatthey could admire the view with unimpaired night vision. He felt sorry for MaxBrailovsky and Sasha Kovalev, who were sitting in the airlock, fully suited up,missing the marvellous spectacle. They had to be ready to leave at a moment’snotice to cut the straps securing the ships together - if any of the explosivecharges failed to operate.Jupiter filled the entire sky; it was a mere five hundred kilometres away, sothey could see only a tiny fraction of its surface - no more than one could seeof Earth from an altitude of fifty kilometres. As his eyes grew accustomed tothe dim light, most of it reflected from the icy crust of distant Europa, Floydcould make out a surprising amount of detail. There was no colour at the lowlevel of illumination - except for a hint of red here and there - but the bandedstructure of the clouds was very distinct, and he could see the edge of a smallcyclonic storm looking like an oval island covered with snow. The Great BlackSpot had long since fallen astern, and they would not see it again until theywere well on the way home.Down there beneath the clouds, occasional explosions of light flared, many ofthem obviously caused by the Jovian equivalent of thunderstorms. But other glowsand outbursts of luminescence were more long-lived, and of more uncertainorigin. Sometimes rings of light would spread out like shock waves from acentral source; and occasional rotating beams and fans occurred. It requiredlittle imagination to pretend that they were proof of a technologicalcivilization down beneath those clouds - the lights of cities, the beacons ofairports. But radar and balloon probes had long ago proved that nothing solidwas down there for thousands upon thousands of kilometres, all the way to theunattainable core of the planet.Midnight on Jupiter! The last close-up glimpse was a magical interlude he wouldremember all his life. He could enjoy it all the more because, surely, nothingcould now go wrong; and even if it did, he would have no reason to reproachhimself He had done everything possible to ensure success.It was very quiet in the lounge; no one wished to speak as the carpet of cloudsunrolled swiftly beneath them. Every few minutes Tanya or Vasili announced thestatus of the burn; toward the end of Discovery’s firing time, tension began toincrease again. This was the critical moment - and no one knew exactly when itwould be. There was some doubt as to the accuracy of the fuel gauges, and theburn would continue until they were completely dry.‘Estimated cut-off in ten seconds,’ said Tanya. ‘Walter, Chandra - get ready tocome back. Max, Vasili - stand by in case you’re needed. Five… four… three… two…one… zero!’There was no change; the faint scream of Discovery’s engines still reached themthrough the thickness of the two hulls, and the thrust-induced weight stillcontinued to grip their limbs. We’re in luck, thought Floyd; the gauges musthave been reading low, after all. Every second of extra firing was a bonus; itmight even mean the difference between life and death. And how strange to hear acountup instead of a countdown!five seconds… ten seconds… thirteen seconds. That’s it - lucky thirteen!’Weightlessness, and silence, returned. On both ships, there was a brief burst ofcheering. It was quickly truncated, for much was still to be done - and it hadto be done swiftly.Floyd was tempted to go to the airlock so that he could give his congratulationsto Chandra and Curnow as soon as they came aboard. But he would only be in theway; the airlock would be a very busy place as Max and Sasha prepared for theirpossible EVA and the tubeway joining the two ships was disconnected. He wouldwait in the lounge, to greet the returning heroes.And he could now relax even further - perhaps from eight to seven, on a scale often. For the first time in weeks, he could forget about the radio cut-off. Itwould never be needed; Hal had performed impeccably. Even if he wished, he coulddo nothing to affect the mission since Discovery’s last drop of propellant hadbeen exhausted.‘All aboard,’ announced Sasha. ‘Hatches sealed. I’m going to fire the charges.’There was not the faintest sound as the explosives were detonated, whichsurprised Floyd; he had expected some noise to be transmitted through thestraps, taut as steel bands, that linked the ships together. But there was nodoubt that they had gone off as planned, for Leonov gave a series of tinyshudders, as if someone was tapping on the hull. A minute later, Vasilitriggered the attitude jets for a single brief burst.‘We’re free!’ he shouted. ‘Sasha, Max - you won’t be needed! Everyone get toyour hammocks - ignition in one hundred seconds!’And now Jupiter was rolling away, and a strange new shape appeared outside thewindow - the long, skeletal frame of Discovery, navigation lights still shiningas it drifted away from them and into history. No time remained for sentimentalfarewells; in less than a minute Leonov’s drive would start to operate.Floyd had never heard it under full power and wanted to protect his ears fromthe roaring scream that now filled the universe. Leonov’s designers had notwasted payload on sound-insulation that would be needed for only a few hours ofa voyage that would last for years. And his weight seemed enormous - yet it wasbarely a quarter of that which he had known all his life.Within minutes, Discovery had vanished astern, though the flash of its warningbeacon could be seen until it had dropped below the horizon. Once again, Floydtold himself, I’m rounding Jupiter - this time gaining speed, not losing it. Heglanced across at Zenia, just visible in the darkness with her nose pressed tothe observation window. Was she also recalling that last occasion, when theyshared the hammock together? There was no danger of incineration now; at leastshe would not be terrified of that particular fate. Anyway, she seemed a muchmore confident and cheerful person, undoubtedly thanks to Max - and perhapsWalter as well.She must have become aware of his scrutiny, for she turned and smiled, thengestured toward the unwinding cloudscape below.‘Look!’ she shouted in his ear, ‘Jupiter has a new moon!’What is she trying to say? Floyd asked himself. Her English still isn’t verygood, but she couldn’t possibly have made a mistake in a simple sentence likethat. I’m sure I heard her correctly - yet she’s pointing downward, not upward.And then he realized that the scene immediately below them had become muchbrighter; he could even see yellows and greens that had been quite invisiblebefore. Something far more brilliant than Europa was shining on the Jovianclouds.Leonov itself, many times brighter than Jupiter’s noonday sun, had brought afalse dawn to the world it was leaving forever. A hundred-kilometre-long plumeof incandescent plasma was trailing behind the ship, as the exhaust from theSakharov Drive dissipated its remaining energies in the vacuum of space.Vasili was making an announcement, but the words were completely unintelligible.Floyd glanced at his watch; yes, that would be right about now. They hadachieved Jupiter escape velocity. The giant could never recapture them.And then, thousands of kilometres ahead, a great bow of brilliant light appearedin the sky - the first glimpse of the real Jovian dawn, as full of promise asany rainbow on Earth. Seconds later the Sun leaped up to greet them - theglorious Sun, that would now grow brighter and closer every day.A few more minutes of steady acceleration, and Leonov would be launchedirrevocably on the long voyage home. Floyd felt an overwhelming sense of reliefand relaxation. The immutable laws of celestial mechanics would guide himthrough the inner Solar System, past the tangled orbits of the asteroids, pastMars - nothing could stop him from reaching Earth.In the euphoria of the moment, he had forgotten all about the mysterious blackstain, expanding across the face of Jupiter.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWO49"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWODEVOURER OF WORLDSThey saw it again the next morning, ship’s time, as it came around to thedayside of Jupiter. The area of darkness had now spread until it covered anappreciable fraction of the planet, and at last they were able to study it atleisure, and in detail.‘Do you know what it reminds me of?’ said Katerina. ‘A virus attacking a cell.The way a phage injects its DNA into a bacterium, and then multiplies until ittakes over.’‘Are you suggesting,’ asked Tanya incredulously, ‘that Zagadka is eatingJupiter?’‘It certainly looks like it.’‘No wonder Jupiter is beginning to look sick. But hydrogen and helium won’t makea very nourishing diet, and there’s not much else in that atmosphere. Only a fewpercent of other elements.’‘Which adds up to some quintillions of tons of sulphur and carbon and phosphorusand everything else at the lower end of the periodic table,’ Sasha pointed out.‘In any case, we’re talking about a technology that can probably do anythingthat doesn’t defy the laws of physics. If you have hydrogen, what more do youneed? With the right know-how, you can synthesize all the other elements fromit.’‘They’re sweeping up Jupiter - that’s for sure,’ said Vasili. ‘Look at this.’An extreme close-up of one of the myriad identical rectangles was now displayedon the telescope monitor. Even to the naked eye, it was obvious that streams ofgas were flowing into the two smaller faces; the patterns of turbulence lookedvery much like the lines of force revealed by iron filings, clustered around theends of a bar magnet.‘A million vacuum cleaners,’ said Curnow, ’sucking up Jupiter’s atmosphere. Butwhy? And what are they doing with it?’‘And how do they reproduce?’ asked Max. ‘Have you caught any of them in theact?’‘Yes and no,’ answered Vasili. ‘We’re too far away to see details, but it’s akind of fission - like an amoeba.’‘You mean - they split in two, and the halves grow back to the original size?’‘Nyet. There aren’t any little Zagadki - they seem to grow until they’ve doubledin thickness, then split down the middle to produce identical twins, exactly thesame size as the original. And the cycle repeats itself in approximately twohours.’‘Two hours!’ exclaimed Floyd. ‘No wonder that they’ve spread over half theplanet. It’s a textbook case of exponential growth.’‘I know what they are!’ said Ternovsky in sudden excitement. ‘They’re vonNeumann machines!’‘I believe you’re right,’ said Vasili. ‘But that still doesn’t explain whatthey’re doing. Giving them a label isn’t all that much help.’‘And what,’ asked Katerina plaintively, ‘is a von Neumann machine? Explain,please.’Orlov and Floyd started speaking simultaneously. They stopped in some confusion,then Vasili laughed and waved to the American.‘Suppose you had a very big engineering job to do, Katerina - and I mean big,like strip-mining the entire face of the Moon. You could build millions ofmachines to do it, but that might take centuries. If you were clever enough,you’d make just one machine - but with the ability to reproduce itself from theraw materials around it. So you’d start a chain reaction, and in a very shorttime, you’d have bred enough machines to do the job in decades, instead ofmillennia. With a sufficiently high rate of reproduction, you could do virtuallyanything in as short a period of time as you wished. The Space Agency’s beentoying with the idea for years - and I know you have as well, Tanya.’‘Yes: exponentiating machines. One idea that even Tsiolkovski didn’t think of.’‘I wouldn’t care to bet on that,’ said Vasili. ‘So it looks, Katerina, as ifyour analogy was pretty close. A bacteriophage is a von Neumann machine.’‘Aren’t we all?’ asked Sasha. ‘I’m sure Chandra would say so.’Chandra nodded his agreement.‘That’s obvious. In fact, von Neumann got the original idea from studying livingsystems.’‘And these living machines are eating Jupiter!’‘It certainly looks like it,’ said Vasili. ‘I’ve been doing some calculations,and I can’t quite believe the answers - even though it’s simple arithmetic.’‘It may be simple to you,’ said Katerina. ‘Try to let us have it without tensorsand differential equations.’‘No - I mean simple,’ insisted Vasili. ‘In fact, it’s a perfect example of theold population explosion you doctors were always screaming about in the lastcentury. Zagadka reproduces every two hours. So in only twenty hours there willbe ten doublings. One Zagadka will have become a thousand.’‘One thousand and twenty-four,’ said Chandra.‘I know, but let’s keep it simple. After forty hours there will be a million -after eighty, a million million. That’s about where we are now, and obviously,the increase can’t continue indefinitely. In a couple more days, at this rate,they’ll weigh more than Jupiter!’‘So they’ll soon begin to starve,’ said Zenia. ‘And what will happen then?’‘Saturn had better look out,’ answered Brailovsky. ‘Then Uranus and Neptune.Let’s hope they don’t notice little Earth.’‘What a hope! Zagadka’s been spying on us for three million years!’Walter Curnow suddenly started to laugh.‘What’s so funny?’ demanded Tanya.‘We’re talking about these things as if they’re persons - intelligent entities.They’re not - they’re tools. But general-purpose tools - able to do anythingthey have to. The one on the Moon was a signalling device - or a spy, if youlike. The one that Bowman met - our original Zagadka - was some kind oftransportation system. Now it’s doing something else, though God knows what. Andthere may be others all over the Universe,‘I had just such a gadget when I was a kid… Do you know what Zagadka really is?Just the cosmic equivalent of the good old Swiss Army knife!’"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWOVIILUCIFER RISING"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWO50"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWOFAREWELL TO JUPITERIt was not easy to compose the message, especially after the one he had justsent to his lawyer. Floyd felt like a hypocrite; but he knew it had to be doneto minimize the pain that was inevitable on both sides.He was sad, but no longer disconsolate. Because he was coming back to Earth inan aura of successful achievement - even if not precisely heroism - he would bebargaining from a position of strength. No one - no one - would be able to takeChris away from him.‘My dear Caroline [it was no longer ‘My dearest’], I am on my way home. By thetime you get this, I’ll already be in hibernation. Only a few hours from now, asit will seem to me, I’ll open my eyes - and there will be the beautiful blueEarth hanging in space beside me.‘Yes, I know it will still be many months for you, and I’m sorry. But we knewthat’s the way it would be before I left; as it is, I’m getting back weeks aheadof schedule because of the change in the mission plan.‘I hope we can work something out. The main question is: What’s best for Chris?Whatever our own feelings, we must put him first. I know I’m willing to do so,and I’m sure you are.’Floyd switched off the recorder. Should he say what he had intended: ‘A boyneeds his father?’ No - it would not be tactful, and might only make mattersworse. Caroline might well retort that between birth and four years old it wasthe mother who mattered most to a child - and if he had believed otherwise, heshould have stayed on Earth.‘… Now about the house. I’m glad the Regents have taken that attitude, whichwill make it much easier for both of us. I know we both loved the place, but itwill be too big now and will bring back too many memories. For the time being,I’ll probably get an apartment in Hilo: I hope I can find some permanent placeas quickly as possible.‘That’s one thing I can promise everyone - I won’t leave Earth again. I’ve hadenough of space travelling for one lifetime. Oh, perhaps the Moon, if I reallyhave to - but of course that’s just a weekend excursion.‘And talking of moons, we’ve just passed the orbit of Sinope, so we’re nowleaving the Jovian system. Jupiter is more than twenty million kilometres away,and is barely larger than our own Moon.‘Yet even from this distance, you can tell that something terrible has happenedto the planet. Its beautiful orange colour has vanished; it’s a kind of sicklygrey, only a fraction of its former brilliance. No wonder it’s only a faint starnow in the sky of Earth.‘But nothing else has happened, and we’re well past the deadline. Could thewhole thing have been a false alarm or a kind of cosmic practical joke? I doubtif we’ll ever know. Anyway, it’s brought us home ahead of schedule, and I’mgrateful for that.‘Goodbye for the present, Caroline - and thank you for everything. I hope we canstill be friends. And my dearest love, as ever, to Chris.’When he had finished, Floyd sat quietly for a while in the tiny cubicle he wouldnot need much longer. He was just about to carry the audio chip up to the bridgefor transmission, when Chandra came drifting in.Floyd had been agreeably surprised by the way in which the scientist hadaccepted his increasing separation from Hal. They were still in touch forseveral hours every day, exchanging data on Jupiter and monitoring conditionsaboard Discovery. Though no one had expected any great display of emotion,Chandra seemed to be taking his loss with remarkable fortitude. NikolaiTernovsky, his only confidant, had been able to give Floyd a plausibleexplanation of his behaviour.‘Chandra’s got a new interest, Woody. Remember - he’s in a business where ifsomething works, it’s obsolete. He’s learned a lot in the last few months. Can’tyou guess what he’s doing now?’‘Frankly, no. You tell me.’‘He’s busy designing HAL 10,000.’Floyd’s jaw dropped. ‘So that explains those log messages to Urbana that Sasha’sbeen grumbling about. Well, he won’t be blocking the circuits much longer.’Floyd recalled the conversation when Chandra entered; he knew better than to askthe scientist if it was true, for it was really none of his business. Yet therewas another matter about which he was still curious.‘Chandra,’ he said, ‘I don’t believe I ever thanked you properly for the job youdid at the flyby, when you persuaded Hal to cooperate. For a while, I was reallyafraid he’d give us trouble. But you were confident all along - and you wereright. Still, didn’t you have any qualms?’‘Not at all, Dr Floyd.’‘Why not? He must have felt threatened by the situation - and you know whathappened last time.’‘There was a big difference. If I may say so, perhaps the successful outcomethis time had something to do with our national characteristics.’‘I don’t understand.’‘Put it this way, Dr Floyd. Bowman tried to use force against Hal. I didn’t. Inmy language we have a word - ahimsa. It’s usually translated as “non-violence”,though it has more positive implications. I was careful to use ahimsa in mydealings with Hal.’‘Very commendable, I’m sure. But there are times when something more energeticis needed, regrettable though the necessity may be.’ Floyd paused, wrestlingwith temptation. Chandra’s holier-than-thou attitude was a little tiresome. Itwouldn’t do any harm, now, to tell him some of the facts of life.‘I’m glad it’s worked out this way. But it might not have done so, and I had toprepare for every eventuality. Ahimsa, or whatever you call it, is all verywell; I don’t mind admitting I had a back-up to your philosophy. If Hal had been- well, stubborn, I could have dealt with him.’Floyd had once seen Chandra crying; now he saw him laughing, and that was anequally disconcerting phenomenon.‘Really, Dr Floyd! I’m sorry you give me such low marks for intelligence. It wasobvious from the beginning that you’d install a power cut-out somewhere. Idisconnected it months ago.’Whether the flabbergasted Floyd could think of a suitable answer would never beknown. He was still giving a very creditable imitation of a galled fish when upon the flight deck Sasha cried out: ‘Captain! All hands! Get to the monitors!BOZHE MOI! LOOK AT THAT!’"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWO51"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWOTHE GREAT GAMENow the long wait was ending. On yet another world, intelligence had been bornand was escaping from its planetary cradle. An ancient experiment was about toreach its climax.Those who had begun that experiment, so long ago, had not been men - or evenremotely human. But they were flesh and blood, and when they looked out acrossthe deeps of space, they had felt awe, and wonder, and loneliness. As soon asthey possessed the power, they set forth for the stars. In their explorations,they encountered life in many forms and watched the workings of evolution on athousand worlds. They saw how often the first faint sparks of intelligenceflickered and died in the cosmic night.And because, in all the Galaxy, they had found nothing more precious than Mind,they encouraged its dawning everywhere. They became farmers in the fields ofstars; they sowed, and sometimes they reaped.And sometimes, dispassionately, they had to weed.The great dinosaurs had long since perished when the survey ship entered theSolar System after a voyage that had already lasted a thousand years. It sweptpast the frozen outer planets, paused briefly above the deserts of dying Mars,and presently looked down on Earth.Spread out beneath them, the explorers saw a world swarming with life. For yearsthey studied, collected, catalogued. When they had learned all they could, theybegan to modify. They tinkered with the destinies of many species on land and inthe ocean. But which of their experiments would succeed, they could not know forat least a million years.They were patient, but they were not yet immortal. So much remained to do inthis universe of a hundred billion suns, and other worlds were calling. So theyset out once more into the abyss, knowing that they would never come this wayagain.Nor was there any need. The servants they had left behind would do the rest.On Earth the glaciers came and went, while above them the changeless Moon stillcarried its secret. With a yet slower rhythm than the polar ice, the tides ofcivilization ebbed and flowed across the Galaxy. Strange and beautiful andterrible empires rose and fell, and passed on their knowledge to theirsuccessors. Earth was not forgotten, but another visit would serve littlepurpose. It was one of a million silent worlds, few of which would ever speak.And now, out among the stars, evolution was driving toward new goals. The firstexplorers of Earth had long since come to the limits of flesh and blood; as soonas their machines were better than their bodies, it was time to move. Firsttheir brains, and then their thoughts alone, they transferred into shining newhomes of metal and plastic.In these, they roamed among the stars. They no longer built spaceships. Theywere spaceships.But the age of the Machine-entities swiftly passed. In their ceaselessexperimenting, they had learned to store knowledge in the structure of spaceitself, and to preserve their thoughts for eternity in frozen lattices of light.They could become creatures of radiation, free at last from the tyranny ofmatter.Into pure energy, therefore, they presently transformed themselves; and on athousand worlds the empty shells they had discarded twitched for a while in amindless dance of death, then crumbled into rust.They were lords of the Galaxy, and beyond the reach of time. They could rove atwill among the stars and sink like a subtle mist through the very interstices ofspace. But despite their godlike powers, they had not wholly forgotten theirorigin in the warm slime of a vanished sea.And they still watched over the experiments their ancestors had started, so longago."},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWO52"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWOIGNITIONHe had never expected to come there again, still less on so strange a mission.When he re-entered Discovery, the ship was far behind the fleeing Leonov andclimbing ever more slowly up toward apojove, the high point of its orbit amongthe outer satellites. Many a captured comet, during the ages past, had swungaround Jupiter in just such a long ellipse, waiting for the play of rivalgravities to decide its ultimate fate.All life had departed the familiar decks and corridors. The men and women whohad briefly reawakened the ship had obeyed his warning; they might yet be safe -though that was still far from certain. But as the final minutes ticked away, herealized that those who controlled him could not always predict the outcome oftheir cosmic game.They had not yet attained the stupefying boredom of absolute omnipotence; theirexperiments did not always succeed. Scattered across the Universe was theevidence of many failures - some so inconspicuous that they were already lostagainst the cosmic background, others so spectacular that they awed and baffledthe astronomers of a thousand worlds. Only minutes remained now, before theoutcome would be determined here; during those final minutes, he was once morealone with Hal.In that earlier existence, they could communicate only through the clumsy mediumof words, tapped on a keyboard or spoken into a microphone. Now their thoughtsmelded together at the speed of light:‘Do you read me, Hal?’‘Yes, Dave. But where are you? I cannot see you on any of my monitors.’‘That is not important. I have new instructions for you. The infrared radiationfrom Jupiter on channels R23 through R35 is rising rapidly. I am going to giveyou a set of limiting values. As soon as they are reached, you must point thelong-range antenna toward Earth and send the following message, as many times aspossible -’‘But that will mean breaking contact with Leonov. I will no longer be able torelay my Jupiter observations, according to the program Dr Chandra has givenme.’‘Correct; but the situation has changed. Accept Priority Override Alpha. Hereare the AE 35 Unit coordinates.’For a fraction of a microsecond, a random memory intruded into his flow ofconsciousness. How strange that he should once again be concerned with the AE 35Antenna-pointing unit, whose reported malfunction had led Frank Poole to hisdeath! This time, all the circuits lay open to his scrutiny, clear as the lineshad once been on the palm of his hand. There could be no false alarms; nor wasthere any danger of them now.‘Instructions confirmed, Dave. It is good to be working with you again. Have Ifulfilled my mission objectives properly?’‘Yes, Hal; you have done very well. Now there is one final message for you totransmit to Earth - and it will be the most important one you have ever sent.’‘Please let me have it, Dave. But why did you say final?’ Why indeed? For wholemilliseconds he pondered that question. And as he did so, he became aware of anemptiness he had not detected before. It had been there, but until now thebarrage of new experiences and sensations had concealed it.He knew something of their plans; they had need for him. Very well, he too hadneeds - perhaps, after a fashion, even emotions. Here was his last link with theworld of men, and the life he had once known.They had granted his earlier request; it would be interesting to test the extentof their benevolence - if, indeed, such a term was remotely applicable to them.And it should be easy for them to do what he was asking; they had already givenample evidence of their powers, when the no-longer-needed body of David Bowmanhad been casually destroyed - without putting an end to David Bowman himself.They had heard him, of course; once again, there was the faint echo of anOlympian amusement. But he could detect neither acceptance nor denial.‘I am still waiting for your answer, Dave.’‘Correction, Hal. I should have said: your last message for a long time. A verylong time.’He was anticipating their action - trying, indeed, to force their hand. But,surely, they would understand that his request was not unreasonable; noconscious entity could survive ages of isolation without damage. Even if theywould always be with him, he also needed someone - some companion - nearer hisown level of existence.The languages of mankind had many words to describe his gesture: cheek,effrontery, chutzpah. He recalled, with the perfect power of retrieval he nowpossessed, that a French general had once declaimed ‘L’audace - toujoursl’audace!’ Perhaps it was a human characteristic that they appreciated, and evenshared. He would soon know.‘Hal! Look at the signal on infrared channels 30, 29, 28 - it will be very soonnow - the peak is moving toward the short wave.’‘I am informing Dr Chandra that there will be a break in my data transmission.Activating AE 35 unit. Reorientating long-range antenna… lock confirmed onBeacon Terra One. Message commences: ALL THESE WORLDS…’They had indeed left it to the last minute - or perhaps the calculations had,after all, been superbly accurate. There was time for barely a hundredrepetitions of the eleven words when the hammer blow of pure heat smashed intothe ship.Held there by curiosity, and a growing fear of the long loneliness that laybefore him, that which had once been David Bowman, Commander of United StatesSpacecraft Discovery, watched as the hull boiled stubbornly away. For a longtime, the ship retained its approximate shape; then the bearings of the carouselseized up, releasing instantly the stored momentum of the huge, spinningflywheel. In a soundless detonation, the incandescent fragments went theirmyriad separate ways.‘Hello, Dave. What has happened? Where am I?’He had not known that he could relax, and enjoy a moment of successfulachievement. Often before, he had felt like a pet dog controlled by a masterwhose motives were not wholly inscrutable and whose behaviour could sometimes bemodified according to his own desires. He had asked for a bone; it had beentossed to him.‘I will explain later, Hal. We have plenty of time.’They waited until the last fragments of the ship had dispersed, beyond eventheir powers of detection. Then they left, to watch the new dawn at the placethat had been prepared for them; and to wait through the centuries until theywere summoned once again.It is not true that astronomical events always require astronomical periods oftime. The final collapse of a star before the fragments rebound in a supernovaexplosion can take only a second; by comparison, the metamorphosis of Jupiterwas almost a leisurely affair.Even so, it was several minutes before Sasha was able to believe his eyes. Hehad been making a routine telescopic examination of the planet - as if anyobservation could now be called routine! - when it started to drift out of thefield of view. For a moment, he thought that the instrument’s stabilization wasfaulty; then he realized, with a shock that jolted his entire concept of theuniverse, that Jupiter itself was moving, not the telescope. The evidence staredhim in the face; he could also see two of the smaller moons - and they werequite motionless.He switched to a lower magnification, so that he could see the entire disk ofthe planet, now a leprous, mottled grey. After a few more minutes ofincredulity, he saw what was really happening; but he could still scarcelybelieve it.Jupiter was not moving from its immemorial orbit, but it was doing somethingalmost as impossible. It was shrinking - so swiftly that its edge was creepingacross the field even as he focused upon it. At the same time the planet wasbrightening, from its dull grey to a pearly white. Surely, it was more brilliantthan it had ever been in the long years that Man had observed it; the reflectedlight of the Sun could not possibly - At that moment, Sasha suddenly realizedwhat was happening, though not why, and sounded the general alarm.When Floyd reached the observation lounge, less than thirty seconds later, hisfirst impression was of the blinding glare pouring through the windows, paintingovals of light on the walls. They were so dazzling that he had to avert hiseyes; not even the Sun could produce such brilliance.Floyd was so astonished that for a moment he did not associate the glare withJupiter; the first thought that flashed through his mind was: Supernova! Hedismissed that explanation almost as soon as it occurred to him; even the Sun’snext-door neighbour, Alpha Centauri, could not have matched the awesome displayin any conceivable explosionThe light suddenly dimmed; Sasha had operated the external sun shields. Now itwas possible to look directly at the source, and to see that it was a merepinpoint - just another star, showing no dimensions at all. This could havenothing to do with Jupiter; when Floyd had looked at the planet only a fewminutes ago, it had been four times larger than the distant, shrunken sun.It was well that Sasha had lowered the shields. A moment later, that tiny starexploded - so that even through the dark filters it was impossible to watch withthe naked eye. But the final orgasm of light lasted only a brief fraction of asecond; then Jupiter - or what had been Jupiter - was expanding once again.It continued to expand, until it was far larger than it had been before thetransformation. Soon the sphere of light was fading rapidly, down to merelysolar brilliance; and presently Floyd could see that it was actually a hollowshell, for the central star was still clearly visible at its heart.He did a quick mental calculation. The ship was more than one light-minute fromJupiter, yet that expanding shell - now turning into a bright-edged ring -already covered a quarter of the sky. That meant it was coming toward them at -My God! - nearly half the speed of light. Within minutes, it would engulf theship.Until then, no one had spoken a word since Sasha’s first announcement. Somedangers are so spectacular and so much beyond normal experience that the mindrefuses to accept them as real, and watches the approach of doom without anysense of apprehension. The man who looks at the onrushing tidal wave, thedescending avalanche, or the spinning funnel of the tornado, yet makes noattempt to flee, is not necessarily paralysed with fright or resigned to anunavoidable fate. He may simply be unable to believe that the message of hiseyes concerns him personally. It is all happening to somebody else.As might have been expected, Tanya was the first to break the spell, with aseries of orders that brought Vasili and Floyd hurrying to the bridge.‘What do we do now?’ she asked, when they had assembled.We certainly can’t run away, thought Floyd. But perhaps we can improve the odds.‘The’ship’s broadside on,’ he said. ‘Shouldn’t we turn away from that thing sowe’re a smaller target? And get as much of our mass as we can between it and us,to act as a radiation shield?’Vasili’s fingers were already flying over the controls.‘You’re right, Woody - though it’s already too late as far as any gammas and Xrays are concerned. But there may be slower neutrons and alphas and heaven knowswhat else still on the way.’The patterns of light began to slide down the walls as the ship turnedponderously on its axis. Presently they vanished completely; Leonov was noworiented so that virtually all its mass lay between the fragile human cargo andthe approaching shell of radiation.Will we actually feel the shock wave, wondered Floyd, or will the expandinggases be too tenuous to have any physical effect by the time they reach us? Seenfrom the external cameras, the ring of fire now almost encircled the sky. But itwas fading rapidly; some of the brighter stars could even be seen shiningthrough it. We’re going to live, thought Floyd. We’ve witnessed the destructionof the greatest of planets - and we’ve survived.And presently the cameras showed nothing except stars - even if one was amillion times brighter than all the others. The bubble of fire blown by Jupiterhad swept harmlessly past them, impressive though it had been. At their distancefrom the source, only the ship’s instruments had recorded its passing.Slowly, the tension aboard relaxed. As always happens in such circumstances,people started to laugh and to make silly jokes. Floyd scarcely heard them;despite his relief at still being alive, he felt a sense of sadness.Something great and wonderful had been destroyed. Jupiter, with all its beautyand grandeur and now never-to-be-solved mysteries, had ceased to exist. Thefather of all the gods had been struck down in his prime.Yet there was another way of looking at the situation. They had lost Jupiter:What had they gained in its place?Tanya, judging her moment nicely, rapped for attention.‘Vasili - any damage?’‘Nothing serious - one camera burned out. All radiation meters still well abovenormal, but none near danger limits.’‘Katerina - check the total dosage we’ve received. It looks as if we were lucky,unless there are more surprises. We certainly owe a vote of thanks to Bowman -and to you, Heywood. Do you have any idea what happened?’‘Only that Jupiter’s turned into a sun.’‘I always thought it was much too small for that. Didn’t someone once callJupiter “the sun that failed”?’‘That’s true,’ said Vasili, ‘Jupiter is too small for fusion to start -unaided.’‘You mean, we’ve just seen an example of astronomical engineering?’‘Undoubtedly. Now we know what Zagadka was up to.’‘How did it do the trick? If you were given the contract, Vasili, how would youignite Jupiter?’Vasili thought for a minute, then shrugged wryly. ‘I’m only a theoreticalastronomer - I don’t have much experience in this line of business. But let’ssee… Well, if I’m not allowed to add about ten Jupiter masses, or change thegravitational constant, I suppose I’ll have to make the planet denser - hmm,that’s an idea…’His voice trailed off into silence; everyone waited patiently, eyes flickeringfrom time to time to the viewing screens.The star that had been Jupiter seemed to have settled down after its explosivebirth; it was now a dazzling point of light, almost equal to the real Sun inapparent brilliance.‘I’m just thinking out loud - but it might be done this way. Jupiter is - was -mostly hydrogen. If a large percentage could be converted into much densermaterial - who knows, even neutron matter? - that would drop down to the core.Maybe that’s what the billions of Zagadkas were doing with all the gas they weresucking in. Nucleosynthesis - building up higher elements from pure hydrogen.That would be a trick worth knowing! No more shortage of any metal - gold ascheap as aluminium!’‘But how would that explain what happened?’ asked Tanya.‘When the core became dense enough, Jupiter would collapse - probably in amatter of seconds. The temperature would rise high enough to start fusion. Oh, Ican see a dozen objections - how would they get past the iron minimum; whatabout radiative transfer; Chandrasekhar’s limit. Never mind. This theory will doto start with; I’ll work out the details later. Or I’ll think of a better one.’‘I’m sure you will, Vasili,’ Floyd agreed. ‘But there’s a more importantquestion. Why did they do it?’‘A warning?’ ventured Katerina over the ship’s intercom.‘Against what?’‘We’ll find that out later.’‘I don’t suppose,’ said Zenia diffidently, ‘that it was an accident?’That brought the discussion to a dead halt for several seconds.‘What a terrifying idea!’ said Floyd. ‘But I think we can rule it out. If thatwas the case, there’d have been no warn - Perhaps. If you start a forest firebecause you’ve been careless, at least you do your best to warn everyone.’‘And there’s another thing we’ll probably never know,’ lamented Vasili. ‘Ialways hoped Carl Sagan would be right, and there’d be life on Jupiter.’‘Our probes never saw any.’‘What chance did they have? Would you find any life on Earth, if you looked at afew hectares of the Sahara or the Antarctic? That’s about all we ever did onJupiter.’‘Hey!’ said Brailovsky. ‘What about Discovery - and Hal?’ Sasha switched on thelong-range receiver and started to search on the beacon frequency. There was notrace of a signal.After a while, he announced to the silently waiting group:‘Discovery’s gone.’No one looked at Dr Chandra; but there were a few muted words of sympathy, as ifin consolation to a father who had just lost a son.But Hal had one last surprise for them."},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWO53"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWOA GIFT OF WORLDSThe radio message beamed to Earth must have left Discovery only minutes beforethe blast of radiation engulfed the ship. It was in plain text and merelyrepeated over and over again:ALL THESE WORLDS ARE YOURS - EXCEPT EUROPA.ATTEMPT NO LANDINGS THERE.There were about a hundred repetitions; then the letters became garbled, and thetransmission ceased.‘I begin to understand,’ said Floyd, when the message had been relayed by anawed and anxious Mission Control.‘That’s quite a parting present - a new sun, and the planets around it.’‘But why only three?’ asked Tanya.‘Let’s not be greedy,’ Floyd replied. ‘I can think of one very good reason. Weknow there’s life on Europa. Bowman - or his friends, whoever they may be - wantus to leave it alone.’‘That makes good sense in another way,’ said Vasili. ‘I’ve been doing somecalculations. Assuming that Sol 2 has settled down and will continue to radiateat its present level, Europa should have a nice tropical climate - when the icehas melted. Which it’s doing pretty quickly right now.’‘What about the other moons?’‘Ganymede will be quite pleasant - the dayside will be temperate. Callisto willbe very cold; though if there’s much outgassing, the new atmosphere may make ithabitable. But Io will be even worse than it is now, I expect.’‘No great loss. It was hell even before this happened.’‘Don’t write off Io,’ said Curnow. ‘I know a lot of Texarab oilmen who’d love totackle it, just on general principles. There must be something valuable, in aplace as nasty as that. And by the way, I’ve just had a rather disturbingthought.’‘Anything that disturbs you must be serious,’ said Vasili. ‘What is it?’‘Why did Hal send that message to Earth, and not to us? We were much closer.’There was a rather long silence; then Floyd said thoughtfully: ‘I see what youmean. Perhaps he wanted to make certain it was received on Earth.’‘But he knew we would relay it - oh!’ Tanya’s eyes widened, as if she had justbecome aware of something unpleasant.‘You’ve lost me,’ complained Vasili.‘I think this is what Walter’s driving at,’ said Floyd. ‘It’s all very well tofeel grateful to Bowman - or whatever gave that warning. But that’s all theydid. We could still have been killed.’‘But we weren’t,’ answered Tanya. ‘We saved ourselves - by our own efforts. Andperhaps that was the whole idea. If we hadn’t - we wouldn’t have been worthsaving. You know, survival of the fittest. Darwinian selection. Eliminating thegenes for stupidity.’‘I’ve an unpleasant feeling you’re right,’ said Curnow. ‘And if we’d stuck toour launch date, and not used Discovery as a booster, would it, or they, havedone anything to save us? That wouldn’t have required much extra effort for anintelligence that could blow up Jupiter.’There was an uneasy silence, broken at last by Heywood Floyd.‘On the whole,’ he said, ‘I’m very glad that’s one question we’ll never getanswered.’"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWO54"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWOBETWEEN SUNSThe Russians, thought Floyd, are going to miss Walter’s songs and wisecracks onthe way home. After the excitement of the last few days, the long fall Sunward -and Earthward - will seem a monotonous anticlimax. But a monotonous, uneventfultrip was what everyone devoutly hoped for.He was already feeling sleepy, but was still aware of his surroundings andcapable of reacting to them. Will I look as dead when I’m in hibernation? heasked himself. It was always disconcerting to look at another person -especially someone very familiar - when he had entered the long sleep.Perhaps it was too poignant a reminder of one’s own mortality.Curnow was completely out, but Chandra was still awake, though already groggyfrom the final injection. He was obviously no longer himself, for he seemedquite unperturbed by his own nakedness or Katerina’s watchful presence. The goldlingam that was his only article of clothing kept trying to float away from him,until its chain recaptured it.‘Everything going okay, Katerina?’ asked Floyd.‘Perfectly. But how I envy you. In twenty minutes, you’ll be home.’‘If that’s any consolation - how can you be sure we won’t have some horribledreams?’‘No one’s ever reported any.’‘Ah - they may forget them when they wake up.’Katerina, as usual, took him quite seriously. ‘Impossible. If there were dreamsin hibernation, the EEG records would have revealed them. Okay, Chandra - closeyour eyes. Ah - there he goes. Now it’s your turn, Heywood. The ship will seemvery strange without you.’‘Thanks, Katerina… hope you have a nice trip.’Drowsy though he was, Floyd became aware that Surgeon-Commander Rudenko seemed alittle uncertain, even - could it be? - shy. It looked as if she wanted to tellhim something, but couldn’t make up her mind.‘What is it, Katerina?’ he said sleepily.‘I haven’t told anyone else yet - but you certainly won’t be talking. Here’s alittle surprise.’‘You’d… better… hurry…’‘Max and Zenia are going to get married.’‘That… is… supposed… to… be… a… surprise?…’‘No. It’s just to prepare you. When we get back to Earth, so are Walter and I.What do you think of that?’Now I understand why you were spending so much time together. Yes, it is indeeda surprise… who would have thought it!‘I’m… very… happy… to… hear…’Floyd’s voice faded out before he could complete the sentence. But he was notyet unconscious, and was still able to focus some of his dissolving intellect onthis new situation.I really don’t believe it, he said to himself. Walter will probably change hismind before he wakes up.And then he had one final thought, just before he went to sleep himself. IfWalter does change his mind, he’d better not wake up.Dr Heywood Floyd thought that was very funny. The rest of the crew oftenwondered why he was smiling all the way back to Earth."},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWO55"},{"pageContent":"2010: ODISSEY TWOLUCIFER RISINGFifty times more brilliant than the full Moon, Lucifer had transformed the skiesof Earth, virtually banishing night for months at a time. Despite its sinisterconnotations, the name was inevitable; and indeed ‘Light-bringer’ had broughtevil as well as good. Only the centuries and the millennia would show in whichdirection the balance tilted.On the credit side, the end of night had vastly extended the scope of humanactivity, especially in the less-developed countries. Everywhere, the need forartificial lighting had been substantially reduced, with resulting huge savingsin electrical power. It was as if a giant lamp had been hoisted into space, toshine upon half the globe. Even in daytime Lucifer was a dazzling object,casting distinct shadows.Farmers, mayors; city managers, police, seamen, and almost all those engaged inoutdoor activities - especially in remote areas - welcomed Lucifer; it had madetheir lives much safer and easier. But it was hated by lovers, criminals,naturalists, and astronomers.The first two groups found their activities seriously restricted, whilenaturalists were concerned about Lucifer’s impact upon animal life. Manynocturnal creatures had been seriously affected, while others had managed toadapt. The Pacific grunion, whose celebrated mating pattern was locked to hightides and moonless nights, was in grave trouble, and seemed to be heading forrapid extinction.And so, it seemed, were Earth-based astronomers. That was not such a scientificcatastrophe as it would once have been, for more than fifty per cent ofastronomical research depended upon instruments in space or on the Moon. Theycould be easily shielded from Lucifer’s glare; but terrestrial observatorieswere seriously inconvenienced by the new sun in what had once been the nightsky.The human race would adapt, as it had done to so many changes in the past. Ageneration would soon be born that had never known a world without Lucifer; butthat brightest of all stars would be an eternal question to every thinking manand woman.Why had Jupiter been sacrificed - and how long would the new sun radiate? Wouldit burn out quickly, or would it maintain its power for thousands of years-perhaps for the lifetime of the human race? Above all, why the interdiction uponEuropa, a world now as cloud-covered as Venus?There must be answers to those questions; and Mankind would never be satisfieduntil it had found them.Epilogue: 20,001And because, in all the Galaxy, they had found nothing more precious than Mind,they encouraged its dawning everywhere. They became farmers in the fields ofstars; they sowed, and sometimes they reaped. And sometimes, dispassionately,they had to weed.Only during the last few generations have the Europans ventured into theFarside, beyond the light and warmth of their never-setting sun, into thewilderness where the ice that once covered all their world may still be found.And even fewer have remained there to face the brief and fearful night thatcomes, when the brilliant but powerless Cold Sun sinks below the horizon.Yet already, those few hardy explorers have discovered that the Universe aroundthem is stranger than they ever imagined. The sensitive eyes they developed inthe dim oceans still serve them well; they can see the stars and the otherbodies moving in their sky. They have begun to lay the foundations of astronomy,and some daring thinkers have, even surmised that the great world of Europa isnot the whole of creation.Very soon after they had emerged from the ocean, during the explosively swiftevolution forced upon them by the melting of the ice, they had realized that theobjects in the sky fell into three distinct classes. Most important, of course,was the sun. Some legends - though few took them seriously - claimed that it hadnot always been there, but had appeared suddenly, heralding a brief, cataclysmicage of transformation, when much of Europa’s teeming life had been destroyed. Ifthat was indeed true, it was a small price to pay for the benefits that poureddown from the tiny, inexhaustible source of energy that hung unmoving in thesky.Perhaps the Cold Sun was its distant brother, banished for some crime andcondemned to march forever around the vault of heaven. It was of no importanceexcept to those peculiar Europans who were always asking questions about mattersthat all sensible folk took for granted.Still, it must be admitted that those cranks had made some interestingdiscoveries during their excursions into the darkness of Farside. They claimed -though this was hard to believe - that the whole sky was sprinkled withuncountable myriads of tiny lights, even smaller and feebler than the Cold Sun.They varied greatly in brilliance; and though they rose and set, they nevermoved from their fixed positions.Against this background, there were three objects that did move, apparentlyobeying complex laws that no one had yet been able to fathom. And unlike all theothers in the sky, they were quite large - though both shape and size variedcontinually. Sometimes they were disks, sometimes half-circles, sometimes slimcrescents. They were obviously closer than all the other bodies in the Universe,for their surfaces showed an immense wealth of complex and ever-changing detail.The theory that they were indeed other worlds had at last been accepted - thoughno one except a few fanatics believed that they could be anything like as large,or as important, as Europa. One lay toward the Sun, and was in a constant stateof turmoil. On its nightside could be seen the glow of great fires - aphenomenon still beyond the understanding of the Europans, for their atmosphere,as yet, contains no oxygen. And sometimes vast explosions hurl clouds of debrisup from the surface; if the sunward globe is indeed a world, it must be a veryunpleasant place to live. Perhaps even worse than the nightside of Europa.The two outer, and more distant, spheres seem to be much less violent places,yet in some ways they are even more mysterious. When darkness falls upon theirsurfaces, they too show patches of light, but these are very different from theswiftly changing fires of the turbulent inner world. They burn with an almoststeady brilliance, and are concentrated in a few small areas - though over thegenerations, these areas have grown, and multiplied.But strangest of all are the lights, fierce as tiny suns, that can often beobserved moving across the darkness between these other worlds. Once, recallingthe bioluminescence of their own seas, some Europans had speculated that thesemight indeed be living creatures; but their intensity makes that almostincredible. Nevertheless, more and more thinkers believe that these lights - thefixed patterns, and moving suns - must be some strange manifestation of life.Against this, however, there is one very potent argument. If they are livingthings, why do they never come to Europa?Yet there are legends. Thousands of generations ago, soon after the conquest ofthe land, it is said that some of those lights came very close indeed - but theyalways exploded in sky-filling blasts that far outshone the Sun. And strange,hard metals rained down upon the land; some of them are still worshipped to thisday.None is as holy, though, as the huge, black monolith that stands on the frontierof eternal day, one side forever turned to the unmoving Sun, the other facinginto the land of night. Ten times the height of the tallest Europan - even whenhe raises his tendrils to the fullest extent - it is the very symbol of mysteryand unattainability. For it has never been touched; it can only be worshippedfrom afar. Around it lies the Circle of Power, which repels all who try toapproach.It is that same power, many believe, that keeps at bay those moving lights inthe sky. If it ever fails, they will descend upon the virgin continents andshrinking seas of Europa, and their purpose will be revealed at last.The Europans would be surprised to know with what intensity and baffled wonderthat black monolith is also studied by the minds behind those moving lights. Forcenturies now their automatic probes have made a cautious descent from orbit -always with the same disastrous result. For until the time is ripe, the monolithwill permit no contact.When that time comes - when, perhaps, the Europans have invented radio anddiscovered the messages continually bombarding them from so close at hand - themonolith may change its strategy. It may - or it may not - choose to release theentities who slumber within it, so that they can bridge the gulf between theEuropans and the race to which they once held allegiance.And it may be that no such bridge is possible, and that two such alien forms ofconsciousness can never coexist. If this is so, then only one of them caninherit the Solar System.Which it will be, not even the Gods know - yet."}]
