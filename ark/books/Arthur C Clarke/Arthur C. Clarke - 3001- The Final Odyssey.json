Though they were not remotely human, they were fleshand blood, and when they looked out across the deeps of space, they felt awe,and wonder - and loneliness. As soon as they possessed the power, they began toseek for fellowship among the stars.In their explorations, they encountered life in many forms, and watched theworkings of evolution on a thousand worlds. They saw how often the first faintsparks of intelligence flickered and died in the cosmic night.And because, in all the Galaxy, they had found nothing more precious than Mind,they encouraged its dawning everywhere. They became farmers in the fields ofstars; they sowed, and sometimes they reaped.And sometimes, dispassionately, they had to weed.The great dinosaurs had long since passed away, their morning promiseannihilated by a random hammerblow from space, when the survey ship entered theSolar System after a voyage that had already lasted a thousand years. It sweptpast the frozen outer planets, paused briefly above the deserts of dying Mars,and presently looked down on Earth.Spread out beneath them, the explorers saw a world swarming with life. For yearsthey studied, collected, catalogued. When they had learned all that they could,they began to modify. They tinkered with the destiny of many species, on landand in the seas. But which of their experiments would bear fruit, they could notknow for at least a million years.They were patient, but they were not yet immortal. There was so much to do inthis universe of a hundred billion suns, and other worlds were calling. So theyset out once more into the abyss, knowing that they would never come this wayagain. Nor was there any need: the servants they had left behind would do therest.On Earth, the glaciers came and went, while above them the changeless Moon stillcarried its secret from the stars. With a yet slower rhythm than the polar ice,the tides of civilization ebbed and flowed across the Galaxy. Strange andbeautiful and terrible empires rose and fell, and passed on their knowledge totheir successors.And now, out among the stars, evolution was driving towards new goals. The firstexplorers of Earth had long since come to the limits of flesh and blood; as soonas their machines were better than their bodies, it was time to move. Firsttheir brains, and then their thoughts alone, they transferred into shining newhomes of metal and gemstone. In these, they roamed the Galaxy. They no longerbuilt spaceships. They were spaceships.But the age of the Machine-entities swiftly passed. In their ceaselessexperimenting, they had learned to store knowledge in the structure of spaceitself, and to preserve their thoughts for eternity in frozen lattices of light.Into pure energy, therefore, they presently transformed themselves; and on athousand worlds, the empty shells they had discarded twitched for a while in amindless dance of death, then crumbled into dust.Now they were Lords of the Galaxy, and could rove at will among the stars, orsink like a subtle mist through the very interstices of space. Though they werefreed at last from the tyranny of matter, they had not wholly forgotten theirorigin, in the warm slime of a vanished sea. And their marvellous instrumentsstill continued to function, watching over the experiments started so many agesago.But no longer were they always obedient to the mandates of their creators; likeall material things, they were not immune to the corruption of Time and itspatient, unsleeping servant, Entropy.And sometimes, they discovered and sought goals of their own.I STAR CITY"},{"pageContent":"3001: THE FINAL ODISSEY1 COMET COWBOYCaptain Dimitri Chandler [M2973.04.21/93.106//Mars//I SpaceAcad3005] - or ‘Dim’to his very best friends - was understandably annoyed. The message from Earthhad taken six hours to reach the space-tug Goliath, here beyond the orbit ofNeptune; if it had arrived ten minutes later he could have answered ‘Sorry -can’t leave now - we’ve just started to deploy the sun-screen.’The excuse would have been perfectly valid: wrapping a comet’s core in a sheetof reflective film only a few molecules thick, but kilometres on a side, was notthe sort of job you could abandon while it was half-completed.Still, it would be a good idea to obey this ridiculous request: he was alreadyin disfavour sunwards, through no fault of his own. Collecting ice from therings of Saturn, and nudging it towards Venus and Mercury, where it was reallyneeded, had started back in the 2700s - three centuries ago. Captain Chandlerhad never been able to see any real difference in the ‘before and after’ imagesthe Solar Conservers were always producing, to support their accusations ofcelestial vandalism. But the general public, still sensitive to the ecologicaldisasters of previous centuries, had thought otherwise, and the ‘Hands offSaturn!’ vote had passed by a substantial majority. As a result, Chandler was nolonger a Ring Rustler, but a Comet Cowboy.So here he was at an appreciable fraction of the distance to Alpha Centauri,rounding up stragglers from the Kuiper Belt. There was certainly enough ice outhere to cover Mercury and Venus with oceans kilometres deep, but it might takecenturies to extinguish their hell-fires and make them suitable for life. TheSolar Conservers, of course, were still protesting against this, though nolonger with so much enthusiasm. The millions dead from the tsunami caused by thePacific asteroid in 2304 - how ironic that a land impact would have done muchless damage! - had reminded all future generations that the human race had toomany eggs in one fragile basket.Well, Chandler told himself, it would be fifty years before this particularpackage reached its destination, so a delay of a week would hardly make muchdifference. But all the calculations about rotation, centre of mass, and thrustvectors would have to be redone, and radioed back to Mars for checking. It was agood idea to do your sums carefully, before nudging billions of tons of icealong an orbit that might take it within hailing distance of Earth.As they had done so many times before, Captain Chandler’s eyes strayed towardsthe ancient photograph above his desk. It showed a three-masted steamship,dwarfed by the iceberg that was looming above it - as, indeed, Goliath wasdwarfed at this very moment.How incredible, he had often thought, that only one long lifetime spanned thegulf between this primitive Discovery and the ship that had carried the samename to Jupiter! And what would those Antarctic explorers of a thousand yearsago have made of the view from his bridge? They would certainly have beendisoriented, for the wall of ice beside which Goliath was floating stretchedboth upwards and downwards as far as the eye could see. And it wasstrange-looking ice, wholly lacking the immaculate whites and blues of thefrozen Polar seas. In fact, it looked dirty - as indeed it was. For only someninety per cent was water-ice: the rest was a witch’s brew of carbon and sulphurcompounds, most of them stable only at temperatures not far above absolute zero.Thawing them out could produce unpleasant surprises: as one astrochemist hadfamously remarked, ‘Comets have bad breath’.‘Skipper to all personnel,’ Chandler announced. ‘There’s been a slight change ofprogramme. We’ve been asked to delay operations, to investigate a target thatSpaceguard radar has picked up.’‘Any details?’ somebody asked, when the chorus of groans over the ship’sintercom had died away.‘Not many, but I gather it’s another Millennium Committee project they’veforgotten to cancel.’More groans: everyone had become heartily sick of all the events planned tocelebrate the end of the 2000s. There had been a general sigh of relief when 1January 3001 had passed uneventfully, and the human race could resume its normalactivities.‘Anyway, it will probably be another false alarm, like the last one. We’ll getback to work just as quickly as we can. Skipper out.’This was the third wild-goose-chase, Chandler thought morosely, he’d beeninvolved with during his career. Despite centuries of exploration, the SolarSystem could still produce surprises, and presumably Spaceguard had a goodreason for its request. He only hoped that some imaginative idiot hadn’t onceagain sighted the fabled Golden Asteroid. If it did exist - which Chandler didnot for a moment believe - it would be no more than a mineralogical curiosity:it would be of far less real value than the ice he was nudging sunwards, tobring life to barren worlds.There was one possibility, however, which he did take quite seriously. Already,the human race had scattered its robot probes through a volume of space ahundred light-years across - and the Tycho Monolith was sufficient reminder thatmuch older civilizations had engaged in similar activities. There might well beother alien artefacts in the Solar System, or in transit through it. CaptainChandler suspected that Spaceguard had something like this in mind: otherwise itwould hardly have diverted a Class I space-tug to go chasing after anunidentified radar blip.Five hours later, the questing Goliath detected the echo at extreme range; evenallowing for the distance, it seemed disappointingly small. However, as it grewclearer and stronger, it began to give the signature of a metallic object,perhaps a couple of metres long. It was travelling on an orbit heading out ofthe Solar System, so was almost certainly, Chandler decided, one of the myriadpieces of space-junk that Mankind had tossed towards the stars during the lastmillennium and which might one day provide the only evidence that the human racehad ever existed.Then it came close enough for visual inspection, and Captain Chandler realized,with awed astonishment, that some patient historian was still checking theearliest records of the Space Age. What a pity that the computers had given himthe answer, just a few years too late for the Mifiermium celebrations!‘Goliath here,’ Chandler radioed Earthwards, his voice tinged with pride as wellas solemnity. ‘We’re bringing aboard a thousand-year-old astronaut. And I canguess who it is.’"},{"pageContent":"3001: THE FINAL ODISSEY2 AWAKENINGFrank Poole awoke, but he did not remember. He was not even sure of his name.Obviously, he was in a hospital room: even though his eyes were still closed,the most primitive, and evocative, of his senses told him that. Each breathbrought the faint and not unpleasant tang of antiseptics in the air, and ittriggered a memory of the time when - of course! - as a reckless teenager he hadbroken a rib in the Arizona Hang-gliding Championship.Now it was all beginning to come back. I’m Deputy Commander Frank Poole,Executive Officer, USSS Discovery, on a Top Secret mission to Jupiter - Itseemed as if an icy hand had gripped his heart. He remembered, in slow-motionplayback, that runaway space-pod jetting towards him, metal claws outstretched.Then the silent impact - and the not-so-silent hiss of air rushing out of hissuit. After that - one last memory, of spinning helplessly in space, trying invain to reconnect his broken air-hose.Well, whatever mysterious accident had happened to the space-pod controls, hewas safe now. Presumably Dave had made a quick EVA and rescued him before lackof oxygen could do permanent brain damage.Good old Dave! He told himself. I must thank - just a moment! - I’m obviouslynot aboard Discovery now - surely I haven’t been unconscious long enough to betaken back to Earth!His confused train of thought was abruptly broken by the arrival of a Matron andtwo nurses, wearing the immemorial uniform of their profession. They seemed alittle surprised: Poole wondered if he had awakened ahead of schedule, and theidea gave him a childish feeling of satisfaction.‘Hello!’ he said, after several attempts; his vocal cords appeared to be veryrusty. ‘How am I doing?’Matron smiled back at him and gave an obvious ‘Don’t try to talk’ command byputting a finger to her lips. Then the two nurses fussed swiftly over him withpractised skill, checking pulse, temperature, reflexes. When one of them liftedhis right arm and let it drop again, Poole noticed something peculiar It fellslowly, and did not seem to weigh as much as normal. Nor, for that matter, didhis body, when he attempted to move.So I must be on a planet, he thought. Or a space-station with artificialgravity. Certainly not Earth - I don’t weigh enough.He was about to ask the obvious question when Matron pressed something againstthe side of his neck; he felt a slight tingling sensation, and sank back into adreamless sleep. Just before he became unconscious, he had time for one morepuzzled thought.How odd - they never spoke a single word - all the time they were with me."},{"pageContent":"3001: THE FINAL ODISSEY3 REHABILITATIONWhen he woke again, and found Matron and nurses standing round his bed, Poolefelt strong enough to assert himself.‘Where am I? Surely you can tell me that!’ The three women exchanged glances,obviously uncertain what to do next. Then Matron answered, enunciating her wordsvery slowly and carefully: ‘Everything is fine, Mr Poole. Professor Andersonwill be here in a minute He will explain.’Explain what? thought Poole with some exasperation. But at least she speaksEnglish, even though I can’t place her accent.Anderson must have been already on his way, for the door opened moments later -to give Poole a brief glimpse of a small crowd of inquisitive onlookers peeringin at him. He began to feel like a new exhibit at a zoo.Professor Anderson was a small, dapper man whose features seemed to havecombined key aspects of several races - Chinese, Polynesian, Nordic - in athoroughly confusing fashion. He greeted Poole by holding up his right palm,then did an obvious double-take and shook hands, with such a curious hesitationthat he might have been rehearsing some quite unfamiliar gesture.‘Glad to see you’re looking so well, Mr Poole… We’ll have you up in no time.’Again that odd accent and slow delivery - but the confident bedside manner wasthat of all doctors, in all places and all ages.‘I’m glad to hear it. Now perhaps you can answer a few questions…’‘Of course, of course. But just a minute.’Anderson spoke so rapidly and quietly to the Matron that Poole could catch onlya few words, several of which were wholly unfamiliar to him. Then the Matronnodded at one of the nurses, who opened a wall-cupboard and produced a slimmetal band, which she proceeded to wrap around Poole’s head.‘What’s that for?’ he asked - being one of those difficult patients, so annoyingto doctors, who always want to know just what’s happening to them. ‘EECreadout?’Professor, Matron and nurses looked equally baffled. Then a slow smile spreadacross Anderson’s face.‘Oh - electro… enceph .. alo… gram,’ he said slowly, as if dredging the word upfrom the depth of memory, ‘You’re quite right. We just want to monitor yourbrain functions.’My brain would function perfectly well if you’d let me use it, Poole grumbledsilently. But at least we seem to be getting somewhere - finally.‘Mr Poole,’ said Anderson, still speaking in that curious stilted voice, as ifventuring in a foreign language, ‘you know, of course, that you were - disabled- in a serious accident, while you were working outside Discovery.’Poole nodded agreement.‘I’m beginning to suspect,’ he said dryly, ‘that “disabled” is a slightunderstatement.’Anderson relaxed visibly, and a slow smile spread across his face.‘You’re quite correct. Tell me what you think happened.’‘Well, the best case scenario is that, after I became unconscious, Dave Bowmanrescued me and brought me back to the ship. How is Dave? No one will tell meanything!’‘All in due course… and the worst case?’It seemed to Frank Poole that a chill wind was blowing gently on the back of hisneck. The suspicion that had been slowly forming in his mind began to solidify.‘That I died, but was brought back here - wherever “here” is - and you’ve beenable to revive me. Thank you…’‘Quite correct. And you’re back on Earth. Well, very near it.’What did he mean by ‘very near it’? There was certainly a gravity field here -so he was probably inside the slowly turning wheel of an orbiting space-station.No matter: there was something much more important to think about.Poole did some quick mental calculations. If Dave had put him in thehibernaculum, revived the rest of the crew, and completed the mission to Jupiter- why, he could have been ‘dead’ for as much as five years!‘Just what date is it?’ he asked, as calmly as possible.Professor and Matron exchanged glances. Again Poole felt that cold wind on hisneck.‘I must tell you, Mr Poole, that Bowman did not rescue you. He believed - and wecannot blame him - that you were irrevocably dead. Also, he was facing adesperately serious crisis that threatened his own survival…’‘So you drifted on into space, passed through the Jupiter system, and headed outtowards the stars. Fortunately, you were so far below freezing point that therewas no metabolism - but it’s a near-miracle that you were ever found at all. Youare one of the luckiest men alive. No - ever to have lived!’Am I? Poole asked himself bleakly. Five years, indeed! It could be a century -or even more.‘Let me have it,’ he demanded.Professor and Matron seemed to be consulting an invisible monitor: when theylooked at each other and nodded agreement, Poole guessed that they were allplugged into the hospital information circuit, linked to the headband he waswearing.‘Frank,’ said Professor Anderson, making a smooth switch to the role oflong-time family physician, ‘this will be a great shock to you, but you’recapable of accepting it - and the sooner you know, the better.’‘We’re near the beginning of the Fourth Millennium. Believe me - you left Earthalmost a thousand years ago.’‘I believe you,’ Poole answered calmly. Then, to his great annoyance, the roomstarted to spin around him, and he knew nothing more.When he regained consciousness, he found that he was no longer in a bleakhospital room but in a luxurious suite with attractive - and steadily changing -images on the walls. Some of these were famous and familiar paintings, othersshowed land and sea-scapes that might have been from his own time. There wasnothing alien or upsetting: that, he guessed, would come later.His present surroundings had obviously been carefully programmed: he wondered ifthere was the equivalent of a television screen somewhere (how many channelswould the Fourth Millennium have?) but could see no sign of any controls nearhis bed. There was so much he would have to learn in this new world: he was asavage who had suddenly encountered civilization.But first, he must regain his strength - and learn the language; not even theadvent of sound recording, already more than a century old when Poole was born,had prevented major changes in grammar and pronunciation. And there werethousands of new words, mostly from science and technology, though often he wasable to make a shrewd guess at their meaning.More frustrating, however, were the myriad of famous and infamous personal namesthat had accumulated over the millennium, and which meant nothing to him. Forweeks, until he had built up a data bank, most of his conversations had to beinterrupted with potted biographies. As Poole’s strength increased, so did thenumber of his visitors, though always under Professor Anderson’s watchful eye.They included medical specialists, scholars of several disciplines, and - of thegreatest interest to him - spacecraft commanders.There was little that he could tell the doctors and historians that was notrecorded somewhere in Mankind’s gigantic data banks, but he was often able togive them research shortcuts and new insights about the events of his own time.Though they all treated him with the utmost respect and listened patiently as hetried to answer their questions, they seemed reluctant to answer his. Poolebegan to feel that he was being over-protected from culture shock, andhalf-seriously wondered how he could escape from his suite. On the few occasionshe was alone, he was not surprised to discover that the door was locked.Then the arrival of Doctor Indra Wallace changed everything. Despite her name,her chief racial component appeared to be Japanese, and there were times whenwith just a little imagination Poole could picture her as a rather mature GeishaGirl. It was hardly an appropriate image for a distinguished historian, holdinga Virtual Chair at a university still boasting real ivy.She was the first visitor with a fluent command of Poole’s own English, so hewas delighted to meet her.‘Mr Poole,’ she began, in a very business-like voice, ‘I’ve been appointed yourofficial guide and - let’s say - mentor. My qualifications - I’ve specialized inyour period - my thesis was “The Collapse of the Nation-State, 2000-50″. 1believe we can help each other in many ways.’‘I’m sure we can. First I’d like you to get me out of here, so I can see alittle of your world.’‘Exactly what we intend to do. But first we must give you an Ident. Until thenyou’ll be - what was the term? -a non-person. It would be almost impossible foryou to go anywhere, or get anything done. No input device would recognize yourexistence.’‘Just what I expected,’ Poole answered, with a wry smile. ‘It was starting toget that way in my own time - and many people hated the idea.’‘Some still do. They go off and live in the wilderness - there’s a lot more onEarth than there was in your century! But they always take their compaks withthem, so they can call for help as soon as they get into trouble. The mediantime is about five days.’‘Sorry to hear that. The human race has obviously deteriorated.’He was cautiously testing her, trying to find the limits of her tolerance and tomap out her personality. It was obvious that they were going to spend much timetogether, and that he would have to depend upon her in hundreds of ways. Yet hewas still not sure if he would even like her: perhaps she regarded him merely asa fascinating museum exhibit.Rather to Poole’s surprise, she agreed with his criticism.‘That may be true - in some respects. Perhaps we’re physically weaker, but we’rehealthier and better adjusted than most humans who have ever lived. The NobleSavage was always a myth’.She walked over to a small rectangular plate, set at eye-level in the door. Itwas about the size of one of the countless magazines that had proliferated inthe far-off Age of Print, and Poole had noticed that every room seemed to haveat least one. Usually they were blank, but sometimes they contained lines ofslowly scrolling text, completely meaningless to Poole even when most of thewords were familiar. Once a plate in his suite had emitted urgent beepings,which he had ignored on the assumption that someone else would deal with theproblem, whatever it was. Fortunately the noise stopped as abruptly as it hadstarted.Dr Wallace laid the palm of her hand upon the plate, then removed it after a fewseconds. She glanced at Poole, and said smilingly: ‘Come and look at this.’The inscription that had suddenly appeared made a good deal of sense, when heread it slowly:WALLACE, INDRA [F2970.03.11 :31.885 / /HIST.OXFORD] ‘I suppose itmeans Female, date of birth 11 March 2970 - and that you’re associated with theDepartment of History at Oxford. And I guess that 31.885 is a personalidentification number. Correct?’‘Excellent, Mr Poole. I’ve seen some of your e-mail addresses and credit cardnumbers - hideous strings of alpha-numeric gibberish that no one could possiblyremember! But we all know our date of birth, and not more than 99,999 otherpeople will share it. So a five-figure number is all you’ll ever need… and evenif you forget that, it doesn’t really matter. As you see, it’s a part of you.’‘Implant?’‘Yes - nanochip at birth, one in each palm for redundancy. You won’t even feelyours when it goes in. But you’ve given us a small problem…’‘What’s that?’‘The readers you’ll meet most of the time are too simple-minded to believe yourdate of birth. So, with your permission, we’ve moved it up a thousand years.’‘Permission granted. And the rest of the Ident?’‘Optional. You can leave it empty, give your current interests and location - oruse it for personal messages, global or targeted.’Some things, Poole was quite sure, would not have changed over the centuries. Ahigh proportion of those ‘targeted’ messages would be very personal indeed.He wondered if there were still self or state-appointed censors in this day andage - and if their efforts at improving other people’s morals had been moresuccessful than in his own time.He would have to ask Dr Wallace about that, when he got to know her better."},{"pageContent":"3001: THE FINAL ODISSEY4 A ROOM WITH A VIEW‘Frank - Professor Anderson thinks you’re strong enough to go for a littlewalk.’‘I’m very pleased to hear it. Do you know the expression “stir crazy”?’‘No - but I can guess what it means.’Poole had so adapted to the low gravity that the long strides he was takingseemed perfectly normal. Half a gee, he had estimated - just right to give asense of well-being. They met only a few people on their walk, all of themstrangers, but every one gave a smile of recognition. By now, Poole told himselfwith a trace of smugness, I must be one of the best-known celebrities in thisworld. That should be a great help - when I decide what to do with the rest ofmy life. At least another century, if I can believe Anderson.The corridor along which they were walking was completely featureless apart fromoccasional numbered doors, each bearing one of the universal recog panels. Poolehad followed Indra for perhaps two hundred metres when he came to a sudden halt,shocked because he had not realized something so blindingly obvious.‘This space-station must be enormous!’ he exclaimed. Indra smiled back at him.‘Didn’t you have a saying - “You ain’t seen anything yet”?’‘”Nothing”,’ he corrected, absent-mindedly. He was still trying to estimate thescale of this structure when he had another surprise. Who would have imagined aspace-station large enough to boast a subway - admittedly a miniature one, witha single small coach capable of seating only a dozen passengers.‘Observation Lounge Three,’ ordered Indra, and they drew silently and swiftlyaway from the terminal.Poole checked the time on the elaborate wrist-band whose functions he was stillexploring. One minor surprise had been that the whole world was now on UniversalTime: the confusing patchwork of Time Zones had been swept away by the advent ofglobal communications There had been much talk of this, back in the twenty-firstcentury, and it had even been suggested that Solar should be replaced bySidereal Time. Then, during the course of the year, the Sun would move rightround the clock: setting at the time it had risen six months earlier.However, nothing had come of this ‘Equal time in the Sun’ proposal - or of evenmore vociferous attempts to reform the calendar. That particular job, it hadbeen cynically suggested, would have to wait for somewhat major advances intechnology. Some day, surely, one of God’s minor mistakes would be corrected,and the Earth’s orbit would be adjusted, to give every year twelve months ofthirty exactly equal days.As far as Poole could judge by speed and elapsed time, they must have travelledat least three kilometres before the vehicle came to a silent stop, the doorsopened, and a bland autovoice intoned, ‘Have a good view. Thirty-five per centcloud-cover today.’At last, thought Poole, we’re getting near the outer wall. But here was anothermystery - despite the distance he had gone, neither the strength nor thedirection of gravity had altered! He could not imagine a spinning space-stationso huge that the gee-vector would not be changed by such a displacement… couldhe really be on some planet after all? But he would feel lighter - usually muchlighter - on any other habitable world in the Solar System.When the outer door of the terminal opened, and Poole found himself entering asmall airlock, he realized that he must indeed be in space. But where were thespacesuits? He looked around anxiously: it was against all his instincts to beso close to vacuum, naked and unprotected. One experience of that was enough…‘We’re nearly there,’ said Indra reassuringly.The last door opened, and he was looking out into the utter blackness of space,through a huge window that was curved both vertically and horizontally. He feltlike a goldfish in its bowl, and hoped that the designers of this audaciouspiece of engineering knew exactly what they were doing. They certainly possessedbetter structural materials than had existed in his time.Though the stars must be shining out there, his light-adapted eyes could seenothing but black emptiness beyond the curve of the great window. As he startedto walk towards it to get a wider view, Indra restrained him and pointedstraight ahead.‘Look carefully,’ she said ‘Don’t you see it-’Poole blinked, and stared into the night. Surely it must be an illusion - even,heaven forbid, a crack in the window…He moved his head from side to side. No, it was real. But what could it be? Heremembered Euclid’s definition ‘A lie has length, but no thickness’.For spanning the whole height of the window, and obviously continuing out ofsight above and below, was a thread of light quite easy to see when he lookedfor it, yet so one-dimensional that the word ‘thin’ could not even be applied.However, it was not completely featureless; there were barely visible spots ofgreater brilliance at irregular intervals along its length, like drops of wateron a spider’s web.Poole continued walking towards the window, and the view expanded until at lasthe could see what lay below him. It was familiar enough: the whole continent ofEurope, and much of northern Africa, just as he had seen them many times fromspace. So he was in orbit after all - probably an equatorial one, at a height ofat least a thousand kilometres.Indra was looking at him with a quizzical smile.‘Go closer to the window,’ she said, very softly. ‘So that you can look straightdown. I hope you have a good head for heights.’What a silly thing to say to an astronaut! Poole told himself as he movedforward. If I ever suffered from vertigo, I wouldn’t be in this business…The thought had barely passed through his mind when he cried ‘My God!’ andinvoluntarily stepped back from the window, Then, bracing himself, he dared tolook again.He was looking down on the distant Mediterranean from the face of a cylindricaltower, whose gently curving wall indicated a diameter of several kilometres. Butthat was nothing compared with its length, for it tapered away down, down, down- until it disappeared into the mist somewhere over Africa. He assumed that itcontinued all the way to the surface.‘How high are we?’ he whispered.‘Two thousand kay. But now look upwards.’This time, it was not such a shock: he had expected what he would see. The towerdwindled away until it became a glittering thread against the blackness ofspace, and he did not doubt that it continued all the way to the geostationaryorbit, thirty-six thousand kilometres above the Equator. Such fantasies had beenwell known in Poole’s day: he had never dreamed he would see the reality - andbe living in it.He pointed towards the distant thread reaching up from the eastern horizon.‘That must be another one.’‘Yes - the Asian Tower. We must look exactly the same to them.’‘How many are there?’‘Just four, equally spaced around the Equator. Africa, Asia, America, Pacifica.The last one’s almost empty - only a few hundred levels completed. Nothing tosee except water…’Poole was still absorbing this stupendous concept when a disturbing thoughtoccurred to him.‘There were already thousands of satellites, at all sorts of altitudes, in mytime. How do you avoid collisions?’Indra looked slightly embarrassed.‘You know - I never thought about that - it’s not my field.’ She paused for amoment, clearly searching her memory. Then her face brightened.‘I believe there was a big clean-up operation, centuries ago. There just aren’tany satellites, below the stationary orbit.’That made sense, Poole told himself. They wouldn’t be needed - the four gigantictowers could provide all the facilities once provided by thousands of satellitesand space-stations.‘And there have never been any accidents - any collisions with spaceshipsleaving earth, or re-entering the atmosphere?’Indra looked at him with surprise.‘But they don’t, any more,’ She pointed to the ceiling. ‘All the spaceports arewhere they should be - up there, on the outer ring. I believe it’s four hundredyears since the last rocket lifted off from the surface of the Earth.’Poole was still digesting this when a trivial anomaly caught his attention. Histraining as an astronaut had made him alert to anything out of the ordinary: inspace, that might be a matter of life or death.The Sun was out of view, high overhead, but its rays streaming down through thegreat window painted a brilliant band of light on the floor underfoot. Cuttingacross that band at an angle was another, much fainter one, so that the frame ofthe window threw a double shadow.Poole had to go almost down on his knees so that he could peer up at the sky. Hehad thought himself beyond surprise, but the spectacle of two suns left himmomentarily speechless.‘What’s that?’ he gasped, when he had recovered his breath.‘Oh - haven’t you been told? That’s Lucifer.’‘Earth has another sun?’‘Well, it doesn’t give us much heat, but it’s put the Moon out of business…Before the Second Mission went there to look for you, that was the planetJupiter.’I knew I would have much to learn in this new world, Poole told himself. Butjust how much, I never dreamed."},{"pageContent":"3001: THE FINAL ODISSEY5 EDUCATIONPoole was both astonished and delighted when the television set was wheeled intothe room and positioned at the end of his bed. Delighted because he wassuffering from mild information starvation - and astonished because it was amodel which had been obsolete even in his own time.‘We’ve had to promise the Museum we’ll give it back,’ Matron informed him. ‘AndI expect you know how to use this,’As he fondled the remote-control, Poole felt a wave of acute nostalgia sweepover him. As few other artefacts could, it brought back memories of hischildhood, and the days when most television sets were too stupid to understandspoken commands.‘Thank you, Matron. What’s the best news channel?’She seemed puzzled by his question, then brightened.‘Oh - I see what you mean. But Professor Anderson thinks you’re not quite readyyet. So Archives has put together a collection that will make you feel at home.’Poole wondered briefly what the storage medium was in this day and age. He couldstill remember compact disks, and his eccentric old Uncle George had been theproud possessor of a collection of vintage videotapes. But surely thattechnological contest must have finished centuries ago - in the usual Darwinianway, with the survival of the fittest.He had to admit that the selection was well done, by someone (Indra?) familiarwith the early twenty-first century. There was nothing disturbing - no wars orviolence, and very little contemporary business or politics, all of which wouldnow be utterly irrelevant. There were some light comedies, sporting events (howdid they know that he had been a keen tennis fan?), classical and pop music, andwildlife documentaries.And whoever had put this collection together had a sense of humour, or theywould not have included episodes from each Star Trek series. As a very smallboy, Poole had met both Patrick Stewart and Leonard Nimoy: he wondered what theywould have thought if they could have known the destiny of the child who hadshyly asked for their autographs.A depressing thought occurred to him, soon after he had started exploring - muchof the time in fast-forward - these relics of the past. He had read somewherethat by the turn of the century - his century! - there were approximately fiftythousand television stations broadcasting simultaneously. If that figure hadbeen maintained and it might well have increased - by now millions of millionsof hours of TV programming must have gone on the air. So even the most hardenedcynic would admit that there were probably at least a billion hours ofworthwhile viewing… and millions that would pass the highest standards ofexcellence. How to find these few - well, few million - needles in so gigantic ahaystack?The thought was so overwhelming - indeed, so demoralizing - that after a week ofincreasingly aimless channel-surfing Poole asked for the set to be removed.Perhaps fortunately, he had less and less time to himself during his wakinghours, which were steadily growing longer as his strength came back.There was no risk of boredom, thanks to the continual parade not only of seriousresearchers but also inquisitive - and presumably influential - citizens who hadmanaged to filter past the palace guard established by Matron and ProfessorAnderson. Nevertheless, he was glad when, one day, the television setreappeared, he was beginning to suffer from withdrawal symptoms - and this time,he resolved to be more selective in his viewing.The venerable antique was accompanied by Indra Wallace, smiling broadly.‘We’ve found something you must see, Frank. We think it will help you to adjust- anyway, we’re sure you’ll enjoy it.’Poole had always found that remark a recipe for guaranteed boredom, and preparedfor the worst. But the opening had him instantly hooked, taking him back to hisold life as few other things could have done. At once he recognized one of themost famous voices of his age, and remembered that he had seen this veryprogramme before. Could it have been at its first transmission? No, he was onlyfive then: must have been a repeat…‘Atlanta, 2000 December 31.’‘This is CNN International, five minutes from the dawn of the New Millennium,with all its unknown perils and promise…’‘But before we try to explore the future, let’s look back a thousand years, andask ourselves: could any persons living in Ad. 1000 even remotely imagine ourworld, or understand it, if they were magically transported across thecenturies?’‘Almost the whole of the technology we take for granted was invented near thevery end of our Millennium - the steam engine, electricity, telephones, radio,television, cinema, aviation, electronics. And, during a single lifetime,nuclear energy and space travel - what would the greatest minds of the past havemade of these? How long could an Archimedes or a Leonardo have retained hissanity, if suddenly dumped into our world?’‘It’s tempting to think that we would do better, if we were transported athousand years hence. Surely the fundamental scientific discoveries have alreadybeen made, though there will be major improvements in technology, will there beany devices, anything as magical and incomprehensible to us as a pocketcalculator or a video camera would have been to Isaac Newton?’‘Perhaps our age is indeed sundered from all those that have gone before.Telecommunications, the ability to record images and sounds once irrevocablylost, the conquest of the air and space - all these have created a civilizationbeyond the wildest fantasies of the past. And equally important, Copernicus,Newton, Darwin and Einstein have so changed our mode of thinking and our outlookon the universe that we might seem almost a new species to the most brilliant ofour predecessors.’‘And will our successors, a thousand years from now, look back on us with thesame pity with which we regard our ignorant, superstitious, disease-ridden,short-lived ancestors? We believe that we know the answers to questions thatthey could not even ask: but what surprises does the Third Millennium hold forus?’‘Well, here it comes -’A great bell began to toll the strokes of midnight. The last vibration throbbedinto silence…‘And that’s the way it was - good-bye, wonderful and terrible twentiethcentury…’Then the picture broke into a myriad fragments, and a new commentator took over,speaking with the accent which Poole could now easily understand, and whichimmediately brought him up to the present.‘Now, in the first minutes of the year three thousand and one, we can answerthat question from the past…’‘Certainly, the people of 2001 who you were just watching would not feel asutterly overwhelmed in our age as someone from 1001 would have felt in theirs.Many of our technological achievements they would have anticipated; indeed, theywould have expected satellite cities, and colonies on the Moon and planets. Theymight even have been disappointed, because we are not yet immortal, and havesent probes only to the nearest stars…’Abruptly, Indra switched off the recording.‘See the rest later, Frank: you’re getting tired. But I hope it will help you toadjust.’‘Thank you, Indra. I’ll have to sleep on it. But it’s certainly proved onepoint.’‘What’s that?’‘I should be grateful I’m not a thousand-and-oner, dropped into 2001. That wouldbe too much of a quantum jump: I don’t believe anyone could adjust to it. Atleast I know about electricity, and won’t die of fright if a picture startstalking at me.’I hope, Poole told himself, that confidence is justified. Someone once said thatany sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. Will Imeet magic in this new world - and be able to handle it?"},{"pageContent":"3001: THE FINAL ODISSEY6 BRAINCAP‘I’m afraid you’ll have to make an agonizing decision,’ said Professor Anderson,with a smile that neutralized the exaggerated gravity of his words.‘I can take it, Doctor. Just give it to me straight.’‘Before you can be fitted with your Braincap, you have to be completely bald. Sohere’s your choice. At the rate your hair grows, you’d have to be shaved atleast once a month. Or you could have a permanent.’‘How’s that done?’‘Laser scalp treatment. Kills the follicles at the root.’‘Hmm… is it reversible?’‘Yes, but that’s messy and painful, and takes weeks.’‘Then I’ll see how I like being hairless, before committing myself. I can’tforget what happened to Samson.’‘Who?’‘Character in a famous old book. His girl-friend cut off his hair while he wassleeping. When he woke up, all his strength had gone.’‘Now I remember - pretty obvious medical symbolism!’‘Still, I wouldn’t mind losing my beard. I’d be happy to stop shaving, once andfor all.’‘I’ll make the arrangements. And what kind of wig would you like?’Poole laughed.‘I’m not particularly vain - think it would be a nuisance, and probably won’tbother. Something else I can decide later.’That everyone in this era was artificially bald was a surprising fact that Poolehad been quite slow to discover; his first revelation had come when both hisnurses removed their luxuriant tresses, without the slightest sign ofembarrassment, just before several equally bald specialists arrived to give hima series of micro-biological checks. He had never been surrounded by so manyhairless people, and his initial guess was that this was the latest step in themedical profession’s endless war against germs.Like many of his guesses, it was completely wrong, and when he discovered thetrue reason he amused himself by seeing how often he would have been sure, hadhe not known in advance, that his visitors’ hair was not their own. The answerwas: seldom with men, never with women; this was obviously the great age of thewig-maker.Professor Anderson wasted no time: that afternoon the nurses smeared someevil-smelling cream over Poole’s head, and when he looked into the mirror anhour later he did not recognize himself. Well, he thought, perhaps a wig wouldbe a good idea, after all…The Braincap fitting took somewhat longer. First a mould had to be made, whichrequired him to sit motionless for a few minutes until the plaster set. He fullyexpected to be told that his head was the wrong shape when his nurses - gigglingmost unprofessionally - had a hard time extricating him. ‘Ouch that hurt!’ hecomplained.Next came the skull-cap itself, a metal helmet that fitted snugly almost down tothe ears, and triggered a nostalgic thought - wish my Jewish friends could seeme now! After a few minutes, it was so comfortable that he was unaware of itspresence.Now he was ready for the installation - a process which, he realized withsomething akin to awe, had been the Rite of Passage for almost all the humanrace for more than half a millennium.‘There’s no need to close your eyes,’ said the technician, who had beenintroduced by the pretentious title of ‘Brain Engineer’ - almost alwaysshortened to ‘Brainman’ in popular usage. ‘When Setup begins, all your inputswill be taken over. Even if your eyes are open, you won’t see anything.’I wonder if everyone feels as nervous as this, Poole asked himself. Is this thelast moment I’ll be in control of my own mind? Still, I’ve learned to trust thetechnology of this age; up to now, it hasn’t let me down. Of course, as the oldsaying goes, there’s always a first time…As he had been promised, he had felt nothing except a gentle tickling as themyriad of nanowires wormed their way through his scalp. All his senses werestill perfectly normal; when he scanned his familiar room, everything wasexactly where it should be.The Brainman - wearing his own skull-cap, wired, like Poole’s, to a piece ofequipment that could easily have been mistaken for a twentieth-century laptopcomputer - gave him a reassuring smile.‘Ready?’ he asked.There were times when the old cliche´s were the best ones.‘Ready as I’ll ever be,’ Poole answered.Slowly, the light faded - or seemed to. A great silence descended, and even thegentle gravity of the Tower relinquished its hold upon him. He was an embryo,floating in a featureless void, though not in complete darkness. He had knownsuch a barely visible, near ultra-violet tenebrosity, on the very edge of night,only once in his life when he had descended further than was altogether wisedown the face of a sheer cliff at the outer edge of the Great Barrier Reef.Looking down into hundreds of metres of crystalline emptiness, he had felt sucha sense of disorientation that he experienced a brief moment of panic, and hadalmost triggered his buoyancy unit before regaining control. Needless to say, hehad never mentioned the incident to the Space Agency physicians…From a great distance a voice spoke out of the immense void that now seemed tosurround him. But it did not reach him through his ears: it sounded softly inthe echoing labyrinths of his brain.‘Calibration starting. From time to time you will be asked questions - you cananswer mentally, but it may help to vocalize. Do you understand?’‘Yes,’ Poole replied, wondering if his lips were indeed moving. There was no waythat he could tell.Something was appearing in the void - a grid of thin lines, like a huge sheet ofgraph paper. It extended up and down, right and left, to the limits of hisvision. He tried to move his head, but the image refused to change.Numbers started to flicker across the grid, too fast for him to read - butpresumably some circuit was recording them. Poole could not help smiling (didhis cheeks move?) at the familiarity of it all. This was just like thecomputer-driven eye examination that any oculist of his age would give a client.The grid vanished, to be replaced by smooth sheets of colour filling his entirefield of view. In a few seconds, they flashed from one end of the spectrum tothe other. ‘Could have told you that,’ Poole muttered silently. ‘My colourvision’s perfect. Next for hearing, I suppose.’He was quite correct. A faint, drumming sound accelerated until it became thelowest of audible Cs, then raced up the musical scale until it disappearedbeyond the range of human hearing, into bat and dolphin territory.That was the last of the simple, straightforward tests. He was briefly assailedby scents and flavours, most of them pleasant but some quite the reverse. Thenhe became, or so it seemed, a puppet on an invisible strig.He presumed that his neuromuscular control was being tested, and hoped thatthere were no external manifestations, if there were, he would probably looklike someone in the terminal stages of St Vitus’s Dance. And for one moment heeven had a violent erection, but was unable to give it a reality check before hefell into a dreamless sleep.Or did he only dream that he slept? He had no idea how much time had elapsedbefore he awoke. The helmet had already gone, together with the Brainman and hisequipment.‘Everything went fine,’ beamed Matron. ‘It will take a few hours to check thatthere are no anomalies. If your reading’s KO - I mean OK - you’ll have yourBraincap tomorrow.’Poole appreciated the efforts of his entourage to learn archaic English, but hecould not help wishing that Matron had not made that unfortunateslip-of-the-tongue.When the time came for the final filling, Poole felt almost like a boy again,about to unwrap some wonderful new toy under the Christmas free.‘You won’t have to go through all that setting-up again,’ the Brainman assuredhim. ‘Download will start immediately. I’ll give you a five-minute demo. Justrelax and enjoy.’Gentle, soothing music washed over him; though it was something very familiar,from his own time, he could not identify it. There was a mist before his eyes,which parted as he walked towards it…Yes, he was walking! The illusion was utterly convincing; he could feel theimpact of his feet on the ground, and now that the music had stopped he couldhear a gentle wind blowing through the great trees that appeared to surroundhim. He recognized them as Californian redwoods, and hoped that they stillexisted in reality, somewhere on Earth.He was moving at a brisk pace - too fast for comfort, as if time was slightlyaccelerated so he could cover as much ground as possible. Yet he was notconscious of any effort; he felt he was a guest in someone else’s body. Thesensation was enhanced by the fact that he had no control over his movements.When he attempted to stop, or to change direction, nothing happened. He wasgoing along for the ride.It did not matter; he was enjoying the novel experience - and could appreciatehow addictive it could become. The ‘dream machines’ that many scientists of hisown century had anticipated - often with alarm - were now part of everyday life.Poole wondered how Mankind had managed to survive: he had been told that much ofit had not. Millions had been brain-burned, and had dropped out of life.Of course, he would be immune to such temptations! He would use this marvelloustool to learn more about the world of the Fourth Millennium, and to acquire inminutes new skills that would otherwise take years to master. Well - he might,just occasionally, use the Braincap purely for fun…He had come to the edge of the forest, and was looking out across a wide river.Without hesitation, he walked into it, and felt no alarm as the water rose overhis head. It did seem a little strange that he could continue breathingnaturally, but he thought it much more remarkable that he could see perfectly ina medium where the unaided human eye could not focus. He could count every scaleon the magnificent trout that went swimming past, apparently oblivious to thisstrange intruder…Then, a mermaid- Well he had always wanted to meet one, but he had assumed thatthey were marine creatures. Perhaps they occasionally came upstream - likesalmon, to have their babies? She was gone before he could question her, toconfirm or deny this revolutionary theory.The river ended in a translucent wall; he stepped through it on to the face of adesert, beneath a blazing sun. Its heat burned him uncomfortably - yet he wasable to look directly into its noonday fury. He could even see, with unnaturalclarity, an archipelago of sunspots near one limb. And - this was surelyimpossible - there was the tenuous glory of the corona, quite invisible exceptduring total eclipse, reaching out like a swan’s wings on either side of theSun.Everything faded to black: the haunting music returned, and with it the blissfulcoolness of his familiar room. He opened his eyes (had they ever been closed?)and found an expectant audience waiting for his reaction.‘Wonderful!’ he breathed, almost reverently. ‘Some of it seemed - well, realerthan real!’Then his engineer’s curiosity, never far from the surface, started nagging him.‘Even that short demo must have contained an enormous amount of information.How’s it stored?’‘In these tablets - the same your audio-visual system uses, but with muchgreater capacity.’The Brainman handed Poole a small square, apparently made of glass, silvered onone surface; it was almost the same size as the computer diskettes of his youth,but twice the thickness. As Poole tilted it back and forth, trying to see intoits transparent interior, there were occasional rainbow-hued flashes, but thatwas all.He was holding, he realized, the end product of more than a thousand years ofelectro-optical technology - as well as other technologies unborn in his era.And it was not surprising that, superficially, it resembled closely the deviceshe had known. There was a convenient shape and size for most of the commonobjects of everyday life -knives and forks, books, hand-tools, furniture… andremovable memories for computers.‘What’s its capacity?’ he asked. ‘In my time, we were up to a terabyte insomething this size. I’m sure you’ve done a lot better.’‘Not as much as you might imagine - there’s a limit, of course, set by thestructure of matter. By the way, what was a terabyte? Afraid I’ve forgotten.’‘Shame on you! Kilo, mega, giga, tera… that’s ten to the twelfth bytes. Then thepetabyte - ten to the fifteenth - that’s as far as I ever got.’‘That’s about where we start. It’s enough to record everything any person canexperience during one lifetime.’It was an astonishing thought, yet it should not have been so surprising. Thekilogram of jelly inside the human skull was not much larger than the tabletPoole was holding in his hand, and it could not possibly be as efficient astorage device - it had so many other duties to deal with.‘And that’s not all,’ the Brainman continued. ‘With some data compression, itcould store not only the memories - but the actual person.’‘And reproduce them again?’‘Of course; straightforward job of nanoassembly.’So I’d heard, Poole told himself - but I never really believed it.Back in his century, it seemed wonderful enough that the entire lifework of agreat artist could be stored on a single small disk. And now, something nolarger could hold - the artist as well."},{"pageContent":"3001: THE FINAL ODISSEY7 DEBRIEFING‘I’m delighted,’ said Poole, ‘to know that the Smithsonian still exists, afterall these centuries.’‘You probably wouldn’t recognize it,’ said the visitor who had introducedhimself as Dr Alistair Kim, Director of Astronautics. ‘Especially as it’s nowscattered over the Solar System - the main off-Earth collections are on Mars andthe Moon, and many of the exhibits that legally belong to us are still headingfor the stars. Some day we’ll catch up with them and bring them home. We’reparticularly anxious to get our hands on Pioneer 10 - the first manmade objectto escape from the Solar System.’‘I believe I was on the verge of doing that, when they located me.’‘Lucky for you - and for us. You may be able to throw light on many things wedon’t know.’‘Frankly, I doubt it - but I’ll do my best. I don’t remember a thing after thatrunaway space-pod charged me. Though I still find it hard to believe, I’ve beentold that Hal was responsible.’‘That’s true, but it’s a complicated story. Everything we’ve been able to learnis in this recording - about twenty hours, but you can probably Fast most ofit.’‘You know, of course, that Dave Bowman went out in the Number 2 Pod to rescueyou - but was then locked outside the ship because Hal refused to open thepod-bay doors.’‘Why, for God’s sake?’Dr Kim winced slightly. It was not the first time Poole had noticed such areaction.(Must watch my language, he thought. ‘God’ seems to be a dirty word in thisculture - must ask Indra about it.)‘There was a major programming error in Hal’s instructions - he’d been givencontrol of aspects of the mission you and Bowman didn’t know about, it’s all inthe recording…‘Anyway, he also cut off the life-support systems to the three hybernauts - theAlpha Crew - and Bowman had to jettison their bodies as well.’(So Dave and I were the Beta Crew - something else I didn’t know…)‘What happened to them?’ Poole asked. ‘Couldn’t they have been rescued, just asI was?’‘I’m afraid not: we’ve looked into it, of course. Bowman ejected them severalhours after he’d taken back control from Hal, so their orbits were slightlydifferent from yours. Just enough for them to burn up in Jupiter - while youskimmed by, and got a gravity boost that would have taken you to the OrionNebula in a few thousand more years…’‘Doing everything on manual override - really a fantastic performance! - Bowmanmanaged to get Discovery into orbit round Jupiter. And there he encountered whatthe Second Expedition called Big Brother - an apparent twin of the TychoMonolith, but hundreds of times larger.’‘And that’s where we lost him. He left Discovery in the remaining space-pod, andmade a rendezvous with Big Brother. For almost a thousand years, we’ve beenhaunted by his last message: “By Deus - it’s full of stars!”(Here we go again! Poole told himself. No way Dave could have said that… Musthave been ‘My God - it’s full of stars!’)‘Apparently the pod was drawn into the Monolith by some kind of inertial field,because it - and presumably Bowman - survived an acceleration which should havecrushed them instantly. And that was the last information anyone had, for almostten years, until the joint US-Russian Leonov mission…’‘Which made a rendezvous with the abandoned Discovery so that Dr Chandra couldgo aboard and reactivate Hal. Yes, I know that.’Dr Kim looked slightly embarrassed.‘Sorry - I wasn’t sure how much you’d been told already Anyway, that’s when evenstranger things started to happen.’‘Apparently the arrival of Leonov triggered something inside Big Brother. If wedid not have these recordings, no one would have believed what happened. Let meshow you… here’s Dr Heywood Floyd keeping the midnight watch aboard Discovery,after power had been restored. Of course you’ll recognize everything.’(Indeed I do: and how strange to see the long-dead Heywood Floyd, sitting in myold seat with Hal’s unblinking red eye surveying everything in sight. And evenstranger to think that Hal and I have both shared the same experience ofresurrection from the dead…)A message was coining up on one of the monitors, and Floyd answered lazily, ‘OK,Hal. Who is calling?’NO IDENTIFICATION.Floyd looked slightly annoyed.‘Very well. Please give me the message.’IT IS DANGEROUS TO REMAIN HERE. YOU MUST LEAVE WITHIN FIFTEEN DAYS.‘That is absolutely impossible. Our launch window does not open until twenty-sixdays from now. We do not have sufficient propellant for an earlier departure.’I AM AWARE OF THESE FACTS. NEVERTHELESS YOU MUST LEAVE WITHIN FWFEEN DAYS.‘I cannot take this warning seriously unless I know its origin… who is speakingto me?’I WAS DAVID BOWMAN. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU BELIEVE ME. LOOK BEHIND YOU.Heywood Floyd slowly turned in his swivel chair, away from the banked panels andswitches of the computer display, towards the Velcro-covered catwalk behind.(’Watch this carefully,’ said Dr Kim.As if I needed telling, thought Poole…)The zero-gravity environment of Discovery’s observation deck was much dustierthan he remembered it: he guessed that the air-filtration plant had not yet beenbrought on line. The parallel rays of the distant yet still brilliant Sun,streaming through the great windows, lit up a myriad of dancing motes in aclassic display of Brownian movement.And now something strange was happening to these particles of dust; some forceseemed to be marshalling them, herding them away from a central point yetbringing others towards it, until they all met on the surface of a hollowsphere. That sphere, about a metre across, hovered in the air for a moment likea giant soap bubble. Then it elongated into an ellipsoid, whose surface began topucker, to form folds and indentations. Poole was not really surprised when itstarted to assume the shape of a man.He had seen such figures, blown out of glass, in museums and science exibitions.But this dusty phantom did not even approximate anatomical accuracy; it was likea crude clay figurine, or one of the primitive works of art found in therecesses of Stone Age caves. Only the head was fashioned with care; and theface, beyond all shadow of doubt, was that of Commander David Bowman.HELLO, DR FLOYD. NOW DO YOU BELIEVE ME?The lips of the figure never moved: Poole realized that the voice - yes,certainly Bowman’s voice - was actually coming from the speaker grille.THIS IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME, AND I HAVE LIITLE TIME. I HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TOGIVE THIS WARNING. YOU HAVE ONLY FIFFEEN DAYS.‘Why - and what are you?’But the ghostly figure was already fading, its grainy envelope beginning todissolve back into the constituent particles of dust.GOOD-BYE, DOCTOR FLOYD. WE CAN HAVE NO FURTHER CONTACT. BUT THERE MAY BE ONEMORE MESSAGE, IF ALL GOES WELL.As the image dissolved, Poole could not help smiling at that old Space Agecliche´. ‘If all goes well’ - how many times he had heard that phrase intonedbefore a mission!The phantom vanished: only the motes of dancing dust were left, resuming theirrandom patterns in the air. With an effort of will, Poole came back to thepresent.‘Well, Commander - what do you think of that?’ asked Kim.Poole was still shaken, and it was several seconds before he could reply.‘The face and the voice were Bowman’s - I’d swear to that. But what was it?’‘That’s what we’re still arguing about. Call it a hologram, a projection - ofcourse, there are plenty of ways it could be faked if anyone wanted to - but notin those circumstances! And then, of course, there’s what happened next.’‘Lucifer?’‘Yes. Thanks to that warning, the Leonov had just sufficient time to get awaybefore Jupiter detonated.’‘So whatever it was, the Bowman-thing was friendly and trying to help.’‘Presumably. And it may have been responsible for that “one more message” we didreceive - it was sent only minutes before the detonation. Another waning.’Dr Kim brought the screen to life once more. It showed plain text: ALL THESEWORLDS ARE YOURS EXCEPT EUROPA. ATTEMPT NO LANDINGS THERE. The same message wasrepeated about a hundred times, then the letters became garbled.‘And we never have tried to land there?’ asked Poole.‘Only once, by accident, thirty-six years later - when the USSS Galaxy washijacked and forced down there, and her sister ship Universe had to go to therescue. It’s all here -with what little our robot monitors have told us aboutthe Europans.’‘I’m anxious to see them.’‘They’re amphibious, and come in all shapes and sizes. As soon as Luciferstarted melting the ice that covered theirt whole world, they began to emergefrom the sea. Since then, they’ve developed at a speed that seems biologicallyimpossible.’‘From what I remember about Europa, weren’t there lots of cracks in the ice?Perhaps they’d already started crawling through and having a look round.’‘That’s a widely accepted theory. But there’s another, much more speculative,one. The Monolith may have been involved, in ways we don’t yet understand. Whattriggered that line of thought was the discovery of TMA ZERO, right here onEarth, almost five hundred years after your time. I suppose you’ve been toldabout that?’‘Only vaguely - there’s been so much to catch up with! I did think the name wasridiculous - since it wasn’t a magnetic anomaly - and it was in Africa, notTycho!’‘You’re quite right, of course, but we’re stuck with the name. And the more welearn about the Monoliths, the more the puzzle deepens. Especially as they’restill the only real evidence for advanced technology beyond the Earth.’‘That’s surprised me. I should have thought that by this lime we’d have pickedup radio signals from somewhere. The astronomers started searching when I was aboy!’‘Well, there is one hint - and it’s so terrifying that we don’t like to talkabout it. Have you heard of Nova Scorpio?’‘I don’t believe so.’‘Stars go nova all the time, of course - and this wasn’t a particularlyimpressive one. But before it blew up, N Scorp was known to have severalplanets.’‘Inhabited?’‘Absolutely no way of telling; radio searches had picked up nothing. And here’sthe nightmare…’‘Luckily, the automatic Nova Patrol caught the event at the very beginning. Andit didn’t start at the star. One of the planets detonated first, and thentriggered its sun.’‘My Gah… sorry, go on.’‘You see the point. It’s impossible for a planet to go nova - except in oneway.’‘I once read a sick joke in a science-fiction novel - “supernovae are industrialaccidents”.’‘It wasn’t a supernova - but that may be no joke. The most widely acceptedtheory is that someone else had been tapping vacuum energy - and had lostcontrol.’‘Or it could have been a war.’‘Just as bad; we’ll probably never know. But as our own civilization depends onthe same energy source, you can understand why N Scorp sometimes gives usnightmares.’‘And we only had melting nuclear reactors to worry about!’‘Not any longer, thank Deus. But I really wanted to tell you more about TMAZERO’s discovery, because it marked a turning point in human history.’‘Finding TMA ONE on the Moon was a big enough shock, but five hundred yearslater there was a worse one. And it was much nearer home - in every sense of theword. Down there in Africa.’"},{"pageContent":"3001: THE FINAL ODISSEY8 RETURN TO OLDUVAIThe Leakeys, Dr Stephen Del Marco often told himself, would never haverecognized this place, even though it’s barely a dozen kilometres from whereLouis and Mary, five centuries ago, dug up the bones of our first ancestors.Global warming, and the Little Ice Age (truncated by miracles of heroictechnology) had transformed the landscape, and completely altered its biota.Oaks and pine trees were still fighting it out, to see which would survive thechanges in climatic fortune.And it was hard to believe that, by this year 2513, there was anything left inOlduvai undug by enthusiastic anthropologists. However, recent flash-floods -which were not supposed to happen any more - had resculpted this area, and cutaway several metres of topsoil. Del Marco had taken advantage of theopportunity: and there, at the limit of the deep-scan, was something he couldnot quite believe.It had taken more than a year of slow and careful excavation to reach thatghostly image, and to learn that the reality was stranger than anything he haddared to imagine. Robot digging machines had swiftly removed the first fewmetres, then the traditional slave-crews of graduate students had taken over.They had been helped - or hindered - by a team of four kongs, who Del Marcoconsidered more trouble than they were worth. However, the students adored thegenetically-enhanced gorillas, whom they treated like retarded but much-lovedchildren. It was rumoured that the relationships were not always completelyPlatonic.For the last few metres, however, everything was the work of human hands,usually wielding toothbrushes - soft-bristled at that. And now it was finished:Howard Carter, seeing the first glint of gold in Tutankhamen’s tomb, had neveruncovered such a treasure as this. From this moment onwards, Del Marco knew,human beliefs and philosophies would be irrevocably changed.The Monolith appeared to be the exact twin of that discovered on the Moon fivecenturies earlier: even the excavation surrounding it was almost identical insize. And like TMA ONE, it was totally non-reflective, absorbing with equalindifference the fierce glare of the African Sun and the pale gleam of Lucifer.As he led his colleagues - the directors of the world’s half-dozen most famousmuseums, three eminent anthropologists, the heads of two media empires - downinto the pit, Del Marco wondered if such a distinguished group of men and womenhad ever been so silent, for so long. But that was the effect that this ebonrectangle had on all visitors, as they realized the implications of thethousands of artefacts that surrounded it.For here was an archaeologist’s treasure-trove - crudely-fashioned flint tools,countless bones - some animal, some human - and almost all arranged in carefulpatterns. For centuries - no, millennia - these pitiful gifts had been broughthere, by creatures with only the first glimmer of intelligence, as tribute to amarvel beyond their understanding.And beyond ours, Del Marco had often thought. Yet of two things he was certain,though he doubted if proof would ever be possible.This was where - in time and space - the human species had really begun.And this Monolith was the very first of all its multitudinous gods."},{"pageContent":"3001: THE FINAL ODISSEY9 SKYLAND‘There were mice in my bedroom last night,’ Poole complained, only halfseriously. ‘Is there any chance you could find me a cat?’Dr Wallace looked puzzled, then started to laugh.‘You must have heard one of the cleaning microts - I’ll get the programmingchecked so they don’t disturb you. Try not to step on one if you catch it atwork; if you do, it will call for help, and all its friends will come to pick upthe pieces.’So much to learn - so little time! No, that wasn’t true, Poole reminded himself.He might well have a century ahead of him, thanks to the medical science of thisage. The thought was already beginning to fill him with apprehension rather thanpleasure.At least he was now able to follow most conversations easily, and had learned topronounce words so that Indra was not the only person who could understand him.He was very glad that Anglish was now the world language, though French, Russianand Mandarin still flourished.‘I’ve another problem, Indra - and I guess you’re the only person who can help.When I say “God”, why do people look embarrassed?’Indra did not look at all embarrassed; in fact, she laughed.‘That’s a very complicated story. I wish my old friend Dr Khan was here toexplain it to you - but he’s on Ganymede, curing any remaining True Believers hecan find there. When all the old religions were discredited - let me tell youabout Pope Pius XX sometime - one of the greatest men in history! - we stillneeded a word for the Prime Cause, or the Creator of the Universe - if there isone…’‘There were lots of suggestions - Deo - Theo - Jove - Brahma - they were alltried, and some of them are still around - especially Einstein’s favourite, “TheOld One”. But Deus seems to be the fashion nowadays.’‘I’ll try to remember; but it still seems silly to me.’‘You’ll get used to it: I’ll teach you some other reasonably polite expletives,to use when you want to express your feelings…’‘You said that all the old religions have been discredited. So what do peoplebelieve nowadays?’‘As little as possible. We’re all either Deists or Theists.’‘You’ve lost me. Definitions, please.’‘They were slightly different in your time, but here are the latest versions.Theists believe there’s not more than one God; Deists that there is not lessthan one God.’‘I’m afraid the distinction’s too subtle for me.’‘Not for everyone; you’d be amazed at the bitter controversies it’s aroused.Five centuries ago, someone used what’s known as surreal mathematics to provethere’s an infinite number of grades between Theists and Deists. Of course, likemost dabblers with infinity, he went insane. By the way, the best-known Deistswere Americans - Washington, Franklin, Jefferson.’‘A little before my time - though you’d be surprised how many people don’trealize it.’‘Now I’ve some good news. Joe - Prof. Anderson - has finally given his - whatwas the phrase? - OK. You’re fit enough to go for a little trip upstairs… to theLunar Level.’‘Wonderful. How far is that?’‘Oh, about twelve thousand kilometres.’‘Twelve thousand! That will take hours!’Indra looked surprised at his remark: then she smiled.‘Not as long as you think. No - we don’t have a Star Trek Transporter yet -though I believe they’re still working on it! But you’ll need new clothes, andsomeone to show you how to wear them. And to help you with the hundreds oflittle everyday jobs that can waste so much time. So we’ve taken the liberty ofarranging a human personal assistant for you Come in, Danil.’Danil was a small, light-brown man in his mid-thirties, who surprised Poole bynot giving him the usual palm-top salute, with its automatic exchange ofinformation.Indeed, it soon appeared that Danil did not possess an Ident: whenever it wasneeded, he produced a small rectangle of plastic that apparently served the samepurpose as the twenty-first century’s ’smart cards’.‘Danil will also be your guide and what was that word? - I can never remember -rhymes with “ballet”. He’s been specially trained for the job. I’m sure you’llfind him completely satisfactory.’Though Poole appreciated this gesture, it made him feel a little uncomfortable.A valet, indeed! He could not recall ever meeting one; in his time, they werealready a rare and endangered species. He began to feel like a character from anearly-twentieth-century English novel.‘You have a choice,’ said Indra, ‘though I know which one you’ll take. We can goup on an external elevator, and admire the view - or an interior one, and enjoya meal and some light entertainment.’‘I can’t imagine anyone wanting to stay inside.’‘You’d be surprised. It’s too vertiginous for some people - especially visitorsfrom down below. Even mountain climbers who say they’ve got a head for heightsmay start to turn green - when the heights are measured in thousands ofkilometres, instead of metres.’‘I’ll risk it,’ Poole answered with a smile. ‘I’ve been higher.’When they had passed through a double set of airlocks in the exterior wall ofthe Tower (was it imagination, or did he feel a curious sense of disorientationthen?) they entered what might have been the auditorium of a very small theatre.Rows of ten seats were banked up in five tiers: they all faced towards one ofthe huge picture windows which Poole still found disconcerting, as he couldnever quite forget the hundreds of tons of air pressure, striving to blast itout into space.The dozen or so other passengers, who had probably never given the matter anythought, seemed perfectly at ease. They all smiled as they recognized him,nodded politely, then turned away to admire the view.‘Welcome to Skylounge,’ said the inevitable autovoice. ‘Ascent begins in fiveminutes. You will find refreshments and toilets on the lower floor.’Just how long will this trip last? Poole wondered. We’re going to travel overtwenty thousand klicks, there and back: this will be like no elevator ride I’veever known on Earth…While he was waiting for the ascent to begin, he enjoyed the stunning panoramalaid out two thousand kilometres below. It was winter in the northernhemisphere, but the climate had indeed changed drastically, for there was littlesnow south of the Arctic Circle.Europe was almost cloud-free, and there was so much detail that the eye wasoverwhelmed. One by one he identified the great cities whose names had echoeddown the centuries; they had been shrinking even in his time, as thecommunications revolution changed the face of the world, and had now dwindledstill further. There were also some bodies of water in improbable places - thenorthern Sahara’s Lake Saladin was almost a small sea.Poole was so engrossed by the view that he had forgotten the passage of time.Suddenly he realized that much more than five minutes had passed - yet theelevator was still stationary. Had something gone wrong - or were they waitingfor late arrivals?And then he noticed something so extraordinary that at first he refused tobelieve the evidence of his eyes. The panorama had expanded, as if he hadalready risen hundreds of kilometres! Even as he watched, he noticed newfeatures of the planet below creeping into the frame of the window.Then Poole laughed, as the obvious explanation occurred to him.‘You could have fooled me, Indra! I thought this was real - not a videoprojection!’Indra looked back at him with a quizzical smile.‘Think again, Frank. We started to move about ten minutes ago. By now we must beclimbing at, oh - at least a thousand kilometres an hour. Though I’m told theseelevators can reach a hundred gee at maximum acceleration, we won’t touch morethan ten, on this short run.’‘That’s impossible! Six is the maximum they ever gave me in the centrifuge, andI didn’t enjoy weighing half a ton. I know we haven’t moved since we steppedinside.’Poole had raised his voice slightly, and suddenly became aware that the otherpassengers were pretending not to notice.‘I don’t understand how it’s done, Frank, but it’s called an inertial field. Orsometimes a Sharp one - the “S” stands for a famous Russian scientist, Sakharov- I don’t know who the others were.’Slowly, understanding dawned in Poole’s mind - and also a sense of awe-struckwonder. Here indeed was a ‘technology indistinguishable from magic’.‘Some of my friends used to dream of “space drives” - energy fields that couldreplace rockets, and allow movement without any feeling of acceleration, Most ofus thought they were crazy - but it seems they were right! I can still hardlybelieve it… and unless I’m mistaken, we’re starting to lose weight.’‘Yes - it’s adjusting to the lunar value. When we step out, you’ll feel we’re onthe Moon. But for goodness’ sake, Frank - forget you’re an engineer, and simplyenjoy the view.’It was good advice, but even as he watched the whole of Africa, Europe and muchof Asia flow into his field of vision, Poole could not tear his mind away fromthis astonishing revelation. Yet he should not have been wholly surprised: heknew that there had been major breakthroughs in space propulsion systems sincehis time, but had not realized that they would have such dramatic applicationsto everyday life - if that term could be applied to existence in athirty-six-thousand-kilometre-high skyscraper.And the age of the rocket must have been over, centuries ago. All his knowledgeof propellant systems and combustion chambers, ion thrusters and fusionreactors, was totally obsolete. Of course, that no longer mattered - but heunderstood the sadness that the skipper of a windjammer must have felt, whensail gave way to steam.His mood changed abruptly, and he could not help smiling, when the robovoiceannounced, ‘Arriving in two minutes. Please make sure that you do not leave anyof your personal belongings behind.’How often he had heard that announcement, on some commercial flight? He lookedat his watch, and was surprised to see that they had been ascending for lessthan half an hour So that meant an average speed of at least twenty thousandkilometres an hour, yet they might never have moved. What was even stranger -for the last ten minutes or more they must actually have been decelerating sorapidly that by rights they should all have been standing on the roof, headspointing towards Earth!The doors opened silently, and as Poole stepped out he again felt the slightdisorientation he had noticed on entering the elevator lounge. This time,however, he knew what it meant: he was moving through the transition zone wherethe inertial field overlapped with gravity - at this level, equal to the Moon’s.Indra and Danil followed him, walking carefully now at a third of theircustomary weight, as they went forward to meet the next of the day’s wonders.Though the view of the receding Earth had been awesome, even for an astronaut,there was nothing unexpected or surprising about it. But who would have imagineda gigantic chamber, apparently occupying the entire width of the Tower, so thatthe far wall was more than five kilometres away? Perhaps by this time there werelarger enclosed volumes on the Moon and Mars, but this must surely be one of thelargest in space itself.They were standing on a viewing platform, fifty metres up on the outer wall,looking across an astonishingly varied panorama. Obviously, an attempt had beenmade to reproduce a whole range of terrestrial biomes. Immediately beneath themwas a group of slender trees which Poole could not at first identify: then herealized that they were oaks, adapted to one-sixth of their normal gravity.What, he wondered, would palm frees look like here? Giant reeds, probably…In the middle-distance there was a small lake, fed by a river that meanderedacross a grassy plain, then disappeared into something that looked like a singlegigantic banyan tree. What was the source of the water? Poole had become awareof a faint drumming sound, and as he swept his gaze along the gently curvingwall, he discovered a miniature Niagara, with a perfect rainbow hovering in thespray above it.He could have stood here for hours, admiring the view and still not exhaustingall the wonders of this complex and brilliantly contrived simulation of theplanet below. As it spread out into new and hostile environments, perhaps thehuman race felt an ever-increasing need to remember its origins. Of course, evenin his own time every city had its parks as - usually feeble - reminders ofNature. The same impulse must be acting here, on a much grander scale. CentralPark, Africa Tower!‘Let’s go down,’ said Indra. ‘There’s so much to see, and I don’t come here asoften as I’d like.’Followed by the silent but ever-present Danil, who always seemed to know when hewas needed but otherwise kept out of the way, they began a leisurely explorationof this oasis in space. Though walking was almost effortless in this lowgravity, from time to time they took advantage of a small monorail, and stoppedonce for refreshments at a cafe´, cunningly concealed in the trunk of a redwoodthat must have been at least a quarter of a kilometre tall.There were very few other people about - their fellow passengers had long sincedisappeared into the landscape - so it was as if they had all this wonderland tothemselves.Everything was so beautifully maintained, presumably by armies of robots, thatfrom time to time Poole was reminded of a visit he had made to Disney World as asmall boy. But this was even better: there were no crowds, and indeed verylittle reminder of the human race and its artefacts.They were admiring a superb collection of orchids, some of enormous size, whenPoole had one of the biggest shocks of his life. As they walked past a typicalsmall gardener’s shed, the door opened - and the gardener emerged.Frank Poole had always prided himself on his self-control, and never imaginedthat as a full-grown adult he would give a cry of pure fright. But like everyboy of his generation, he had seen all the ‘Jurassic’ movies - and he knew araptor when he met one eye to eye.‘I’m terribly sorry,’ said Indra, with obvious concern. ‘I never thought ofwarning you.’Poole’s jangling nerves returned to normal. Of course, there could be no danger,in this perhaps too-well-ordered world: but still…!The dinosaur returned his stare with apparent total disinterest, then doubledback into the shed and emerged again with a rake and a pair of garden shears,which it dropped into a bag hanging over one shoulder. It walked away from themwith a bird-like gait, never looking back as it disappeared behind someten-metre-high sunflowers.‘I should explain,’ said Indra contritely. ‘We like to use bio-organisms when wecan, rather than robots - I suppose it’s carbon chauvinism! Now, there are onlya few animals that have any manual dexterity, and we’ve used them all at onetime or another.’‘And here’s a mystery that no one’s been able to solve. You’d think thatenhanced herbivores like orangutans and gorillas would be good at this sort ofwork. Well, they’re not; they don’t have the patience for it.’‘Yet carnivores like our friend here are excellent, and easily trained. What’smore - here’s another paradox! -after they’ve been modified they’re docile andgood-natured. Of course, there’s almost a thousand years of genetic engineeringbehind them, and look what primitive man did to the wolf, merely by trial anderror!’Indra laughed and continued: ‘You may not believe this, Frank, but they alsomake good baby-sitters - children love them! There’s a five-hundred-year-oldjoke: “Would you trust your kids to a dinosaur?” “What - and risk injuring it?”‘Poole joined in the laughter, partly in shame-faced reaction to his own fright.To change the subject, he asked Indra the question that was still worrying him.‘All this,’ he said, ‘it’s wonderful - but why go to so much trouble, whenanyone in the Tower can reach the real thing, just as quickly?’Indra looked at him thoughtfully, weighing her words. ‘That’s not quite true.It’s uncomfortable - even dangerous - for anyone who lives above the half-geelevel to go down to Earth, even in a hoverchair. So it has to be this -or, asyou used to say, Virtual Reality.’(Now I begin to understand, Poole told himself bleakly. That explains Anderson’sevasiveness, and all the tests he’s been doing to see if I’ve regained mystrength. I’ve come all the way back from Jupiter, to within two thousandkilometres of Earth - but I may never again walk on the surface of my homeplanet. I’m not sure how I will be able to handle this…)"},{"pageContent":"3001: THE FINAL ODISSEY10 HOMAGE TO ICARUSHis depression quickly passed: there was so much to do and see. A thousandlifetimes would not have been enough, and the problem was to choose which of themyriad distractions this age could offer. He tried, not always successfully, toavoid the trivia, and to concentrate on the things that mattered - notably hiseducation.The Braincap - and the book-sized player that went with it, inevitably calledthe Brainbox - was of enormous value here. He soon had a small library of‘instant knowledge’ tablets, each containing all the material needed for acollege degree. When he slipped one of these into the Brainbox, and gave it thespeed and intensity adjustments that most suited him, there would be a flash oflight, followed by a period of unconsciousness that might last as long as anhour. When he awoke, it seemed that new areas of his mind had been opened up,though he only knew they were there when he searched for them. It was almost asif he was the owner of a library who had suddenly discovered shelves of books hedid not know he possessed.To a large extent, he was the master of his own time. Out of a sense of duty -and gratitude - he acceded to as many requests as he could from scientists,historians, writers and artists working in media that were oftenincomprehensible to him. He also had countless invitations from other citizensof the four Towers, virtually all of which he was compelled to turn down.Most tempting - and most hard to resist - were those that came from thebeautiful planet spread out below. ‘Of course,’ Professor Anderson had told him,‘you’d survive if you went down for short time with the right life-supportsystem, but you wouldn’t enjoy it. And it might weaken your neuromuscular systemeven further. It’s never really recovered from that thousand-year sleep.’His other guardian, Indra Wallace, protected him from unnecessary intrusions,and advised him which requests he should accept - and which he should politelyrefuse. By himself, he would never understand the socio-political structure ofthis incredibly complex culture, but he soon gathered that, although in theoryall class distinctions had vanished, there were a few thousand super-citizens.George Orwell had been right; some would always be more equal than others.There had been times when, conditioned by his twentyfirst-century experience,Poole had wondered who was paying for all this hospitality - would he one day bepresented with the equivalent of an enormous hotel bill? But Indra had quicklyreassured him: he was a unique and priceless museum exhibit, so would never haveto worry about such mundane considerations. Anything he wanted - within reason -would be made available to him: Poole wondered what the limits were, neverimagining that one day he would attempt to discover them.All the most important things in life happen by accident, and he had set hiswall display browser on random scan, silent, when a striking image caught hisattention.‘Stop scan! Sound up!’ he shouted, with quite unnecessary loudness.He recognized the music, but it was a few minutes before he identified it; thefact that his wall was filled with winged humans circling gracefully round eachother undoubtedly helped. But Tchaikovsky would have been utterly astonished tosee this performance of Swan Lake - with the dancers actually flying…Poole watched, entranced, for several minutes, until he was fairly confidentthat this was reality, and not a simulation: even in his own day, one couldnever be quite certain. Presumably the ballet was being performed in one of themany low-gravity environments - a very large one, judging by some of the images.It might even be here in Africa Tower.I want to try that, Poole decided. He had never quite forgiven the Space Agencyfor banning one of his greatest pleasures - delayed parachute formation jumping- even though he could see the Agency’s point in not wanting to risk a valuableinvestment. The doctors had been quite unhappy about his earlier hang-glidingaccident; fortunately his teenage bones had healed completely.‘Well,’ he thought, ‘there’s no one to stop me now unless it’s Prof. Anderson…’To Poole’s relief, the physician thought it an excellent idea, and he was alsopleased to find that every one of the Towers had its own Aviary, up at theone-tenth-gee level.Within a few days he was being measured for his wings, not in the least like theelegant versions worn by the performers of Swan Lake. Instead of feathers therewas a flexible membrane, and when he grasped the hand-holds attached to thesupporting ribs, Poole realized that he must look much more like a bat than abird. However his ‘Move over, Dracula!’ was completely wasted on his instructor,who was apparently unacquainted with vampires.For his first lessons he was restrained by a light harness, so that he did notmove anywhere while he was taught the basic strokes - and, most important ofall, learned control and stability. Like many acquired skills, it was not quiteas easy as it looked.He felt ridiculous in this safety-harness - how could anyone injure themselvesat a tenth of a gravity! - and was glad that he needed only a few lessons;doubtless his astronaut training helped. He was, the Wingmaster told him, thebest pupil he had ever taught: but perhaps he said that to all of them.After a dozen free-flights in a chamber forty metres on a side, criss-crossedwith various obstacles which he easily avoided, Poole was given the all-clearfor his first solo - and felt nineteen years old again, about to take off in theFlagstaff Aero Club’s antique Cessna.The unexciting name ‘The Aviary’ had not prepared him for the venue of thismaiden flight. Though it seemed even more enormous than the space holding theforests and gardens down at the lunar-gee level, it was almost the same size,since it too occupied an entire floor of the gently tapering Tower. A circularvoid, half a kilometre high and over four kilometres wide, it appeared trulyenormous, as there were no features on which the eye could rest. Because thewalls were a uniform pale blue, they contributed to the impression of infinitespace.Poole had not really believed the Wingmaster’s boast, ‘You can have any sceneryyou like’, and intended to throw him what he was sure was an impossiblechallenge. But on this first flight, at the dizzy altitude of fifty metres,there were no visual distractions, Of course, a fall from the equivalentaltitude of five metres in the ten-fold greater Earth gravity could break one’sneck; however, even minor bruises were unlikely here, as the entire floor wascovered with a network of flexible cables The whole chamber was a gianttrampoline; one could, thought Poole, have a lot of fun here - even withoutwings.With firm, downward strokes, Poole lifted himself into the air. In almost notime, it seemed that he was a hundred metres in the air, and still rising.‘Slow down’ said the Wingmaster, ‘I can’t keep up with you,’Poole straightened out, then attempted a slow roll. He felt light-headed as wellas light-bodied (less than ten kilograms!) and wondered if the concentration ofoxygen had been increased.This was wonderful - quite different from zero gravity, as it posed more of aphysical challenge. The nearest thing to it was scuba diving: he wished therewere birds here, to emulate the equally colourful coral fish who had so oftenaccompanied him over tropical reefs.One by one, the Wingmaster put him through a series of manoeuvres - rolls,loops, upside-down flying, hovering.Finally he said: ‘Nothing more I can teach you. Now let’s enjoy the view.’Just for a moment, Poole almost lost control - as he was probably expected todo. For, without the slightest warning, he was surrounded by snow-cappedmountains, and was flying down a narrow pass, only metres from some unpleasantlyjagged rocks.Of course, this could not be real: those mountains were as insubstantial asclouds, and he could fly right through them if he wished. Nevertheless, heveered away from the cliff-face (there was an eagle’s nest on one of its ledges,holding two eggs which he felt he could touch if he came closer) and headed formore open space.The mountains vanished; suddenly, it was night. And then the stars came out -not the miserable few thousand in the impoverished skies of Earth, but legionsbeyond counting. And not only stars, but the spiral whirlpools of distantgalaxies, the teeming, close-packed sun-swarms of globular clusters.There was no possible way this could be real, even if he had been magicallytransported to some world where such skies existed. For those galaxies werereceding even as he watched; stars were fading, exploding, being born in stellarnurseries of glowing fire-mist. Every second, a million years must be passing…The overwhelming spectacle disappeared as quickly as it had come: he was back inthe empty sky, alone except for his instructor, in the featureless blue cylinderof the Aviary.‘I think that’s enough for one day,’ said the Wingmaster, hovering a few metresabove Poole. ‘What scenery would you like, the next time you come here?’Poole did not hesitate. With a smile, he answered the question."},{"pageContent":"3001: THE FINAL ODISSEY11 HERE BE DRAGONSHe would never have believed it possible, even with the technology of this dayand age. How many terabytes - petabytes - was there a large enough word? - ofinformation must have been accumulated over the centuries, and in what sort ofstorage medium? Better not think about it, and follow Indra’s advice: ‘Forgetyou’re an engineer - and enjoy yourself.’He was certainly enjoying himself now, though his pleasure was mixed with analmost overwhelming sense of nostalgia. For he was flying, or so it seemed, atan altitude of about two kilometres, above the spectacular and unforgottenlandscape of his youth. Of course, the perspective was false, since the Aviarywas only half a kilometre high, but the illusion was perfect.He circled Meteor Crater, remembering how he had scrambled up its sides duringhis earlier astronaut training. How incredible that anyone could ever havedoubted its origin, and the accuracy of its name! Yet well into the twentiethcentury, distinguished geologists had argued that it was volcanic: not until thecoming of the Space Age was it - reluctantly - accepted that all planets werestill under continual bombardment.Poole was quite sure that his comfortable cruising speed was nearer twenty thantwo hundred kilometres an hour, yet he had been allowed to reach Flagstaff inless than fifteen minutes. And there were the whitely-gleaming domes of theLowell Observatory, which he had visited so often as a boy, and whose friendlystaff had undoubtedly been responsible for his choice of career. He hadsometimes wondered what his profession might have been, had he not been born inArizona, near the very spot where the most long-enduring and influential ofMartian fantasies had been created. Perhaps it was imagination, but Poolethought he could just see Lowell’s unique tomb, close to the great telescope,which had fuelled his dreams.From what year, and what season, had this image been captured? He guessed it hadcome from the spy satellites which had watched over the world of the earlytwenty-first century. It could not be much later than his own time, for thelayout of the city was just as he remembered. Perhaps if he went low enough hewould even see himself…But he knew that was absurd; he had already discovered that this was the nearesthe could get. If he flew any closer, the image would start to breakup, revealingits basic pixels. It was better to keep his distance, and not destroy thebeautiful illusion.And there - it was incredible! - was the little park where he had played withhis junior and high-school friends. The City Fathers were always arguing aboutits maintenance, as the water supply became more and more critical. Well, atleast it had survived to this time - whenever that might be.And then another memory brought tears to his eyes. Along those narrow paths,whenever he could get home from Houston or the Moon, he had walked with hisbeloved Rhodesian Ridgeback, throwing sticks for him to retrieve, as man and doghad done from time immemorial.Poole had hoped, with all his heart, that Rikki would still be there to greethim when he returned from Jupiter, and had left him in the care of his youngerbrother Martin. He almost lost control, and sank several metres before regainingstability, as he once more faced the bitter truth that both Rikki and Martin hadbeen dust for centuries.When he could see properly again, he noticed that the dark band of the GrandCanyon was just visible on the far horizon. He was debating whether to head forit - he was growing a little tired - when he became aware that he was not alonein the sky. Something else was approaching, and it was certainly not a humanflyer. Although it was difficult to judge distances here, it seemed much toolarge for that.Well, he thought, I’m not particularly surprised to meet a pterodactyl here -indeed, it’s just the sort of thing I’d expect. I hope it’s friendly - or that Ican outfly it if it isn’t. Oh, no!A pterodactyl was not a bad guess: maybe eight points out of ten. What wasapproaching him now, with slow flaps of its great leathery wings, was a dragonstraight out of Fairyland. And, to complete the picture, there was a beautifullady riding on its back. At least, Poole assumed she was beautiful. Thetraditional image was rather spoiled by one trifling detail: much of her facewas concealed by a large pair of aviator’s goggles that might have come straightfrom the open cockpit of a World War I biplane.Poole hovered in mid-air, like a swimmer treading water, until the oncomingmonster came close enough for him to hear the flapping of its great wings. Evenwhen it was less than twenty metres away, he could not decide whether it was amachine or a bio-construct: probably both.And then he forgot about the dragon, for the rider removed her goggles.The trouble with cliche´s, some philosopher remarked, probably with a yawn, isthat they are so boringly true.But ‘love at first sight’ is never boring.Danil could provide no information, but then Poole had not expected any fromhim. His ubiquitous escort - he certainly would not pass muster as a classicvalet - seemed so limited in his functions that Poole sometimes wondered if hewas mentally handicapped, unlikely though that seemed. He understood thefunctioning of all the household appliances, carried out simple orders withspeed and efficiency, and knew his way about the Tower. But that was all; it wasimpossible to have an intelligent conversation with him, and any polite queriesabout his family were met with a look of blank incomprehension. Poole had evenwondered if he too was a bio-robot.Indra, however, gave him the answer he needed right away.‘Oh, you’ve met the Dragon Lady!’‘Is that what you call her? What’s her real name - and can you get me her Ident?We were hardly in a position to touch palms.’‘Of course - no problemo.’‘Where did you pick up that?’Indra looked uncharacteristically confused.‘I’ve no idea - some old book or movie. Is it a good figure of speech?’‘Not if you’re over fifteen.’‘I’ll try to remember. Now tell me what happened - unless you want to make mejealous.’They were now such good friends that they could discuss any subject with perfectfrankness. Indeed, they had laughingly lamented their total lack of romanticinterest in each other - though Indra had once commented, ‘I guess that if wewere both marooned on a desert asteroid, with no hope of rescue, we could cometo some arrangement.’‘First, you tell me who she is.’‘Her name’s Aurora McAuley; among many other things, she’s President of theSociety for Creative Anachronisms. And if you thought Draco was impressive, waituntil you see some of their other - ah - creations. Like Moby Dick - and a wholezooful of dinosaurs Mother Nature never thought of.’This is too good to be true, thought Poole.I am the biggest anachronism on Planet Earth."},{"pageContent":"3001: THE FINAL ODISSEY12 FRUSTRATIONUntil now, he had almost forgotten that conversation with the Space Agencypsychologist.‘You may be gone from Earth for at least three years. If you like, I can giveyou a harmless anaphrodisiac implant that will last out the mission. I promisewe’ll more than make it up, when you get home.’‘No thanks,’ Poole had answered, trying to keep his face straight when hecontinued, ‘I think I can handle it.’Nevertheless, he had become suspicious after the third or fourth week - and sohad Dave Bowman.‘I’ve noticed it too,’ Dave said ‘I bet those damn doctors put something in ourdiet…’Whatever that something was - if indeed it had ever existed - it was certainlylong past its shelf-life. Until now, Poole had been too busy to get involved inany emotional entanglements, and had politely turned down generous offers fromseveral young (and not so young) ladies. He was not sure whether it was hisphysique or his fame that appealed to them: perhaps it was nothing more thansimple curiosity about a man who, for all they knew, might be an ancestor fromtwenty or thirty generations in the past.To Poole’s delight, Mistress McAuley’s Ident conveyed the information that shewas currently between lovers, and he wasted no further time in contacting her.Within twenty-four hours he was pillion-riding, with his arms enjoyably aroundher waist. He had also learned why aviator’s goggles were a good idea, for Dracowas entirely robotic, and could easily cruise at a hundred klicks. Poole doubtedif any real dragons had ever attained such speeds.He was not surprised that the ever-changing landscapes below them were straightout of legend. Ali Baba had waved angrily at them, as they overtook his flyingcarpet, shouting ‘Can’t you see where you’re going!’ Yet he must be a long wayfrom Baghdad, because the dreaming spires over which they now circled could onlybe Oxford.Aurora confirmed his guess as she pointed down: ‘That’s the pub - the inn -where Lewis and Tolkien used to meet their friends, the Inklings. And look atthe river - that boat just coming out from the bridge - do you see the twolittle girls and the clergyman in it?’‘Yes,’ he shouted back against the gentle sussuration of Draco’s slipstream.‘And I suppose one of them is Alice.’Aurora turned and smiled at him over her shoulder: she seemed genuinelydelighted.‘Quite correct: she’s an accurate replica, based on the Reverend’s photos. I wasafraid you wouldn’t know. So many people stopped reading soon after your time.’Poole felt a glow of satisfaction.I believe I’ve passed another test, he told himself smugly. Riding on Draco musthave been the first. How many more, I wonder? Fighting with broadswords?But there were no more, and the answer to the immemorial ‘Your place or mine?’was - Poole’s.The next morning, shaken and mortified, he contacted Professor Anderson.‘Everything was going splendidly,’ he lamented, ‘when she suddenly becamehysterical and pushed me away. I was afraid I’d hurt her somehow -’Then shecalled the roomlight - we’d been in darkness - and jumped out of bed. I guess Iwas just staring like a fool…’ He laughed ruefully. ‘She was certainly worthstaring at.’‘I’m sure of it. Go on.’‘After a few minutes she relaxed and said something I’ll never be able toforget.’Anderson waited patiently for Poole to compose himself. ‘She said: “I’m reallysorry, Frank. We could have had a good time. But I didn’t know that you’d been -mutilated.”The professor looked baffled, but only for a moment. ‘Oh - I understand. I’msorry too, Frank - perhaps I should have warned you. In my thirty years ofpractice, I’ve only seen half a dozen cases - all for valid medical reasons,which certainly didn’t apply to you…’‘Circumcision made a lot of sense in primitive times - and even in your century- as a defence against some unpleasant - even fatal - diseases in backwardcountries with poor hygiene. But otherwise there was absolutely no excuse for it- and several arguments against, as you’ve just discovered!’‘I checked the records after I’d examined you the first time, and found that bymid-twenty-first century there had been so many malpractice suits that theAmerican Medical Association had been forced to ban it. The arguments among thecontemporary doctors are very entertaining.’‘I’m sure they are,’ said Poole morosely.‘In some countries it continued for another century: then some unknown geniuscoined a slogan - please excuse the vulgarity - “God designed us: circumcisionis blasphemy”. That more or less ended the practice. But if you want, it wouldbe easy to arrange a transplant - you wouldn’t be making medical history, by anymeans.’‘I don’t think it would work. Afraid I’d start laughing every time.’‘That’s the spirit - you’re already getting over it.’Somewhat to his surprise, Poole realized that Anderson’s prognosis was correct.He even found himself already laughing.‘Now what, Frank?’‘Aurora’s “Society for Creative Anachronisms”. I’d hoped it would improve mychances. Just my luck to have found one anachronism she doesn’t appreciate.’"},{"pageContent":"3001: THE FINAL ODISSEY13 STRANGER IN A STRANGE TIMEIndra was not quite as sympathetic as he had hoped: perhaps, after all, therewas some sexual jealousy in their relationship. And - much more serious - whatthey wryly labelled the Dragon Debacle led to their first real argument.It began innocently enough, when Indra complained:‘People are always asking me why I’ve devoted my life to such a horrible periodof history, and it’s not much of an answer to say that there were even worseones.’‘Then why are you interested in my century?’‘Because it marks the transition between barbarism and civilization.’‘Thank you. Just call me Conan.’‘Conan? The only one I know is the man who invented Sherlock Holmes.’‘Never mind - sorry I interrupted. Of course, we in the so-called developedcountries thought we were civilized. At least war wasn’t respectable any more,and the United Nations was always doing its best to stop the wars that did breakout.’‘Not very successfully: I’d give it about three out of ten. But what we findincredible is the way that people - right up to the early 2000s! - calmlyaccepted behaviour we would consider atrocious. And believed in the mostmind-boggled -’‘Boggling.’‘- nonsense, which surely any rational person would dismiss out of hand.’‘Examples, please.’‘Well, your really trivial loss started me doing some research, and I wasappalled by what I found. Did you know that every year in some countriesthousands of little girls were hideously mutilated to preserve their virginity?Many of them died - but the authorities turned a blind eye.’‘I agree that was terrible - but what could my government do about it?’‘A great deal - if it wished. But that would have offended the people whosupplied it with oil and bought its weapons, like the landmines that killed andmaimed civilians by the thousand.’‘You don’t understand, Indra. Often we had no choice: we couldn’t reform thewhole world. And didn’t somebody once say “Politics is the art of thepossible”?’‘Quite true - which is why only second-rate minds go into it. Genius likes tochallenge the impossible.’‘Well, I’m glad you have a good supply of genius, so you can put things right.’‘Do I detect a hint of sarcasm? Thanks to our computers, we can run politicalexperiments in cyberspace before trying them out in practice. Lenin was unlucky;he was born a hundred years too soon. Russian communism might have worked - atleast for a while - if it had had microchips. And had managed to avoid Stalin.’Poole was constantly amazed by Indra’s knowledge of his age - as well as by herignorance of so much that he took for granted. In a way, he had the reverseproblem. Even if he lived the hundred years that had been confidently promisedhim, he could never learn enough to feel at home. In any conversation, therewould always be references he did not understand, and jokes that would go overhis head. Worse still, he would always feel on the verge of some “faux pas” -about to create some social disaster that would embarrass even the best of hisnew friends…Such as the occasion when he was lunching, fortunately in his own quarters, withIndra and Professor Anderson. The meals that emerged from the autochef werealways perfectly acceptable, having been designed to match his physiologicalrequirements. But they were certainly nothing to get excited about, and wouldhave been the despair of a twenty-first-century gourmet.Then, one day, an unusually tasty dish appeared, which brought back vividmemories of the deer-hunts and barbecues of his youth. However, there wassomething unfamiliar about both flavour and texture, so Poole asked the obviousquestion.Anderson merely smiled, but for a few seconds Indra looked as if she was aboutto be sick. Then she recovered and said: ‘You tell him - after we’ve finishedeating.’Now what have I done wrong? Poole asked himself. Half an hour later, with Indrarather pointedly absorbed in a video display at the other end of the room, hisknowledge of the Third Millennium made another major advance.‘Corpse-food was on the way out even in your time,’ Anderson explained. ‘Raisinganimals to - ugh - eat them became economically impossible. I don’t know howmany acres of land it took to feed one cow, but at least ten humans couldsurvive on the plants it produced. And probably a hundred, with hydroponictechniques.‘But what finished the whole horrible business was not economics - but disease.It started first with cattle, then spread to other food animals - a kind ofvirus, I believe, that affected the brain, and caused a particularly nastydeath. Although a cure was eventually found, it was too late to turn back theclock - and anyway, synthetic foods were now far cheaper, and you could get themin any flavour you liked.’Remembering weeks of satisfying but unexciting meals, Poole had strongreservations about this. For why, he wondered, did he still have wistful dreamsof spare-ribs and cordon bleu steaks?Other dreams were far more disturbing, and he was afraid that before long hewould have to ask Anderson for medical assistance. Despite everything that wasbeing done to make him feel at home, the strangeness and sheer complexity ofthis new world were beginning to overwhelm him. During sleep, as if in anunconscious effort to escape, he often reverted to his earlier life: but when heawoke, that only made matters worse.He had travelled across to America Tower and looked down, in reality and not insimulation, on the landscape of his youth - and it had not been a good idea.With optical aid, when the atmosphere was clear, he’d got so close that he couldsee individual human beings as they went about their affairs, sometimes alongstreets that he remembered…And always, at the back of his mind, was the knowledge that down there had oncelived everyone he had ever loved, Mother, Father (before he had gone off withthat Other Woman), dear Uncle George and Aunt Lil, brother Martin - and, notleast, a succession of dogs, beginning with the warm puppies of his earliestchildhood and culminating in Rikki.Above all, there was the memory - and mystery - of Helena…It had begun as a casual affair, in the early days of his astrotraining, but hadbecome more and more serious as the years went by. Just before he had left forJupiter, they had planned to make it permanent when he returned.And if he did not, Helena wished to have his child. He still recalled the blendof solemnity and hilarity with which they had made the necessary arrangements…Now, a thousand years later, despite all his efforts, he had been unable to findif Helena had kept her promise. Just as there were now gaps in his own memory,so there were also in the collective records of Mankind. The worst was thatcreated by the devastating electromagnetic pulse from the 2304 asteroid impact,which had wiped out several per cent of the world’s information banks, despiteall backups and safety systems. Poole could not help wondering if, among all theexabytes that were irretrievably lost, were the records of his own children:even now, his descendants of the thirtieth generation might be walking theEarth; but he would never know.It helped a little to have discovered that - unlike Aurora -some ladies of thisera did not consider him to be damaged goods. On the contrary: they often foundhis alteration quite exciting, but this slightly bizarre reaction made itimpossible for Poole to establish any close relationship. Nor was he anxious todo so; all that he really needed was the occasional healthy, mindless exercise.Mindless - that was the trouble. He no longer had arty purpose in life. And theweight of too many memories was upon him; echoing the title of a famous book hehad read in his youth, he often said to himself, ‘I am a Stranger in a StrangeTime.’There were even occasions when he looked down at the beautiful planet on which -if he obeyed doctor’s orders - he could never walk again, and wondered what itwould be like to make a second acquaintance with the vacuum of space. Though itwas not easy to get through the airlocks without triggering some alarm, it hadbeen done: every few years, some determined suicide made a brief meteoricdisplay in the Earth’s atmosphere.Perhaps it was just as well that deliverance was on its way, from a completelyunexpected direction.* * *‘Nice to meet you, Commander Poole - for the second time.’‘I’m sorry - don’t recall - but then I see so many people.’‘No need to apologize. First time was out round Neptune.’‘Captain Chandler - delighted to see you! Can I get something from theautochef?’‘Anything with over twenty per cent alcohol will be fine.’‘And what are you doing back on Earth? They told me you never come inside Marsorbit.’‘Almost true - though I was born here, I think it’s a dirty, smelly place - toomany people - creeping up to a billion again!’‘More than ten billion in my time. By the way, did you get my “Thank you”message?’‘Yes - and I know I should have contacted you. But I waited until I headedsunwards again. So here I am. Your good health!’As the Captain disposed of his drink with impressive speed, Poole tried toanalyse his visitor. Beards - even small goatees like Chandler’s - were veryrare in this society, and he had never known an astronaut who wore one: they didnot co-exist comfortably with space-helmets. Of course, a Captain might go foryears between EVs, and in any case most outside jobs were done by robots; butthere was always the risk of the unexpected, when one might have to get suitedin a hurry. It was obvious that Chandler was something of an eccentric, andPoole’s heart warmed to him.‘You’ve not answered my question. If you don’t like Earth, what are you doinghere?’‘Oh, mostly contacting old friends - it’s wonderful to forget hour-long delays,and to have real-time conversations! But of course that’s not the reason. My oldrust-bucket is having a refit, up at the Rim shipyard. And the armour has to bereplaced; when it gets down to a few centimetres thick, I don’t sleep too well.’‘Armour?’‘Dust shield. Not such a problem in your time, was it? But it’s a dirtyenvironment out round Jupiter, and our normal cruise speed is several thousandklicks - a second! So there’s a continuous gentle pattering, like raindrops onthe roof.’‘You’re joking!’‘Course I am. If we really could hear anything, we’d be dead. Luckily, this sortof unpleasantness is very rare - last serious accident was twenty years ago. Weknow all the main comet streams, where most of the junk is, and are careful toavoid them - except when we’re matching velocity to round up ice.‘But why don’t you come aboard and have a look around, before we take off forJupiter?’‘I’d be delighted… did you say Jupiter?’‘Well, Ganymede, of course - Anubis City. We’ve a lot of business there, andseveral of us have families we haven’t seen for months.’Poole scarcely heard him.Suddenly - unexpectedly - and perhaps none too soon, he had found a reason forliving.Commander Frank Poole was the sort of man who hated to leave a job undone - anda few specks of cosmic dust, even moving at a thousand kilometres a second, werenot likely to discourage him.He had unfinished business at the world once known as Jupiter.II GOLIATH"},{"pageContent":"3001: THE FINAL ODISSEY14 A FAREWELL TO EARTH‘Anything you want within reason,’ he had been told. Frank Poole was not sure ifhis hosts would consider that returning to Jupiter was a reasonable request;indeed, he was not quite sure himself, and was beginning to have secondthoughts.He had already committed himself to scores of engagements, weeks in advance.Most of them he would be happy to miss, but there were some he would be sorry toforgo. In particular, he hated to disappoint the senior class from his old highschool - how astonishing that it still existed! - when they planned to visit himnext month.However, he was relieved - and a little surprised - when both Indra andProfessor Anderson agreed that it was an excellent idea. For the first time, herealized that they had been concerned with his mental health; perhaps a holidayfrom Earth would be the best possible cure.And, most important of all, Captain Chandler was delighted. ‘You can have mycabin,’ he promised. ‘I’ll kick the First Mate out of hers.’ There were timeswhen Poole wondered if Chandler, with his beard and swagger, was not anotheranachronism. He could easily picture him on the bridge of a batteredthree-master, with Skull and Crossbones flying overhead.Once his decision had been made, events moved with surprising speed. He hadaccumulated very few possessions, and fewer still that he needed to take withhim. The most important was Miss Pringle, his electronic alter ego andsecretary, now the storehouse of both his lives, and the small stack of terabytememories that went with her.Miss Pringle was not much larger than the hand-held personal assistants of hisown age, and usually lived, like the Old West’s Colt 45, in a quick-draw holsterat his waist. She could communicate with him by audio or Braincap, and her primeduty was to act as an information filter and a buffer to the outside world. Likeany good secretary, she knew when to reply, in the appropriate format: ‘I’ll putyou through now’ or - much more frequently: ‘I’m sorry - Mr Poole is engaged.Please record your message and he will get back to you as soon as possible.’Usually, this was never.There were very few farewells to be made: though realtime conversations would beimpossible owing to the sluggish velocity of radio waves, he would be inconstant touch with Indra and Joseph - the only genuine friends he had made.Somewhat to his surprise, Poole realized that he would miss his enigmatic butuseful ‘valet’, because he would now have to handle all the small chores ofeveryday life by himself. Danil bowed slightly when they parted, but otherwiseshowed no sign of emotion, as they took the long ride up to the outer curve ofthe world-circling wheel, thirty-six thousand kilometres above central Africa.‘I’m not sure, Dim, that you’ll appreciate the comparison. But do you know whatGoliath reminds me of?’They were now such good friends that Poole could use the Captain’s nickname -but only when no one else was around.‘Something unflattering, I assume.’‘Not really. But when I was a boy, I came across a whole pile of oldscience-fiction magazines that my Uncle George had abandoned - “pulps”, theywere called, after the cheap paper they were printed on… most of them werealready falling to bits. They had wonderful garish covers, showing strangeplanets and monsters - and, of course, spaceships!‘As I grew older, I realized how ridiculous those spaceships were. They wereusually rocket-driven - but there was never any sign of propellant tanks! Someof them had rows of windows from stem to stem, just like ocean liners. There wasone favourite of mine with a huge glass dome - a space-going conservatory…‘Well, those old artists had the last laugh: too bad they could never know.Goliath looks more like their dreams than the flying fuel-tanks we used tolaunch from the Cape.Your Inertial Drive still seems too good to be true - no visible means ofsupport, unlimited range and speed - sometimes I think I’m the one who’sdreaming!’Chandler laughed and pointed to the view outside.‘Does that look like a dream?’It was the first time that Poole had seen a genuine horizon since he had come toStar City, and it was not quite as far away as he had expected. After all, hewas on the outer rim of a wheel seven times the diameter of Earth, so surely theview across the roof of this artificial world should extend for several hundredkilometres…He used to be good at mental arithmetic - a rare achievement even in his time,and probably much rarer now. The formula to give the horizon distance was asimple one: the square root of twice your height times the radius - the sort ofthing you never forgot, even if you wanted to…Let’s see - we’re about 8 metres up - so root 16 - this is easy! - say big R is40,000 - knock off those three zeros to make it all klicks - 4 times root 40 -hmm - just over 25…Well, twenty-five kilometres was a fair distance, and certainly no spaceport onEarth had ever seemed this huge. Even knowing perfectly well what to expect, itwas uncanny to watch vessels many times the size of his long-lost Discoverylifting off, not only with no sound, but with no apparent means of propulsion.Though Poole missed the flame and fury of the old-time countdowns, he had toadmit that this was cleaner, more efficient - and far safer.Strangest of all, though, was to sit up here on the Rim, in the GeostationaryOrbit itself - and to feel weight! Just metres away, outside the window of thetiny observation lounge, servicing robots and a few spacesuited humans weregliding gently about their business; yet here inside Goliath the inertial fieldwas maintaining standard Mars-gee.‘Sure you don’t want to change your mind, Frank?’ Captain Chandler had askedjokingly, as he left for the bridge. ‘Still ten minutes before lift-off.’‘Wouldn’t be very popular if I did, would I? No - as they used to say back inthe old days - we have commit. Ready or not, here I come.’Poole felt the need to be alone when the drive went on, and the tiny crew - onlyfour men and three women - respected his wish. Perhaps they guessed how he mustbe feeling, to leave Earth for the second time in a thousand years - and, onceagain, to face an unknown destiny.Jupiter-Lucifer was on the other side of the Sun, and the almost straight lineof Goliath’s orbit would take them close to Venus. Poole looked forward toseeing, with his own unaided eyes, if Earth’s sister planet was now beginning tolive up to that description, after centuries of terraforming.From a thousand kilometres up, Star City looked like a gigantic metal bandaround Earth’s Equator, dotted with gantries, pressure domes, scaffoldingholding half-completed ships, antennas, and other more enigmatic structures. Itwas diminishing swiftly as Goliath headed sunwards, and presently Poole couldsee how incomplete it was: there were huge gaps spanned only by a spider’s webof scaffolding, which would probably never be completely enclosed.And now they were falling below the plane of the ring; it was midwinter in thenorthern hemisphere, so the slim halo of Star City was inclined at over twentydegrees to the Sun. Already Poole could see the American and Asian towers, asshining threads stretching outwards and away, beyond the blue haze of theatmosphere.He was barely conscious of time as Goliath gained speed, moving more swiftlythan any comet that had ever fallen sunwards from interstellar space. The Earth,almost full, still spanned his field of view, and he could now see the fulllength of the Africa Tower which had been his home in the life he was nowleaving - perhaps, he could not help thinking, leaving for ever.When they were fifty thousand kilometres out, he was able to view the whole ofStar City, as a narrow ellipse enclosing the Earth. Though the far side wasbarely visible, as a hair-line of light against the stars, it was awe-inspiringto think that the human race had now set this sign upon the heavens.Then Poole remembered the rings of Saturn, infinitely more glorious. Theastronautical engineers still had a long, long way to go, before they couldmatch the achievements of Nature.Or, if that was the right word, Deus."},{"pageContent":"3001: THE FINAL ODISSEY15 TRANSIT OF VENUSWhen he woke the next morning, they were already at Venus. But the huge,dazzling crescent of the still cloud-wrapped planet was not the most strikingobject in the sky:Goliath was floating above an endless expanse of crinkled silver foil, flashingin the sunlight with ever-changing patterns as the ship drifted across it.Poole remembered that in his own age there had been an artist who had wrappedwhole buildings in plastic sheets: how he would have loved this opportunity topackage billions of tons of ice in a glittering envelope… Only in this way couldthe core of a comet be protected from evaporation on its decades-long journeysunwards.‘You’re in luck, Frank,’ Chandler had told him. ‘This is something I’ve neverseen myself. It should be spectacular. Impact due in just over an hour. We’vegiven it a little nudge, to make sure it comes down in the right place. Don’twant anyone to get hurt.’Poole looked at him in astonishment.‘You mean - there are already people on Venus?’‘About fifty mad scientists, near the South Pole. Of course, they’re well dugin, but we should shake them up a bit - even though Ground Zero is on the otherside of the planet. Or I should say “Atmosphere Zero” - it will be days beforeanything except the shockwave gets down to the surface.’As the cosmic iceberg, sparkling and flashing in its protective envelope,dwindled away towards Venus, Poole was struck with a sudden, poignant memory.The Christmas trees of his childhood had been adorned with just such ornaments,delicate bubbles of coloured glass. And the comparison was not completelyludicrous: for many families on Earth, this was still the right season forgifts, and Goliath was bringing a present beyond price to another world.The radar image of the tortured Venusian landscape - its weird volcanoes,pancake domes, and narrow, sinuous canyons - dominated the main screen ofGoliath’s control centre, but Poole preferred the evidence of his own eyes.Although the unbroken sea of clouds that covered the planet revealed nothing ofthe inferno beneath, he wanted to see what would happen when the stolen cometstruck. In a matter of seconds, the myriad of tons of frozen hydrates that hadbeen gathering speed for decades on the downhill run from Neptune would deliverall their energy…The initial flash was even brighter than he had expected. How strange that amissile made of ice could generate temperatures that must be in the tens ofthousands of degrees! Though the filters of the view-port would have absorbedall the dangerous shorter wave-lengths, the fierce blue of the fireballproclaimed that it was hotter than the Sun.It was cooling rapidly as it expanded - through yellow, orange, red… Theshockwave would now be spreading outwards at the velocity of sound - and what asound that must be! - so in a few minutes there should be some visibleindication of its passage across the face of Venus.And there it was! Only a tiny black ring - like an insignificant puff of smoke,giving no hint of the cyclonic fury that must be blasting its way outwards fromthe point of impact. As Poole watched, it slowly expanded, though owing to itsscale there was no sense of visible movement: he had to wait for a full minutebefore he could be quite sure that it had grown larger.After a quarter of an hour, however, it was the most prominent marking on theplanet. Though much fainter - a dirty grey, rather than black - the shockwavewas now a ragged circle more than a thousand kilometres across. Poole guessedthat it had lost its original symmetry while sweeping over the great mountainranges that lay beneath it.Captain Chandler’s voice sounded briskly over the ship’s address system.‘Putting you through to Aphrodite Base. Glad to say they’re not shouting forhelp -’‘- shook us up a bit, but just what we expected. Monitors indicate some rainalready over the Nokomis Mountains - it will soon evaporate, but that’s abeginning. And there seems to have been a flash-flood in Hecate Chasm - too goodto be true, but we’re checking. There was a temporary lake of boiling waterthere after the last delivery -’I don’t envy them, Poole told himself - but I certainly admire them. They provethat the spirit of adventure still exists in this perhaps too-comfortable andtoo-well-adjusted society.‘- and thanks again for bringing this little load down in the right place. Withany luck - and if we can get that sun-screen up into sync orbit - we’ll havesome permanent seas before long. And then we can plant coral reefs, to make limeand pull the excess CO2 out of the atmosphere - hope I live to see it!’I hope you do, thought Poole in silent admiration. He had often dived in thetropical seas of Earth, admiring weird and colourful creatures so bizarre thatit was hard to believe anything stranger would be found, even on the planets ofother suns.‘Package delivered on time, and receipt acknowledged,’ said Captain Chandlerwith obvious satisfaction. ‘Goodbye Venus - Ganymede, here we come.’MISS PRINGLEFILE WALLACEHello, Indra. Yes, you were quite right. I do miss our little arguments.Chandler and I get along fine, and at first the crew treated me - this willamuse you - rather like a holy relic. But they’re beginning to accept me, andhave even started to pull my leg (do you know that idiom?).It’s annoying not to be able to have a real conversation - we’ve crossed theorbit of Mars, so radio round-trip is already over an hour. But there’s oneadvantage - you won’t be able to interrupt me…Even though it will take us only a week to reach Jupiter, I thought I’d havetime to relax. Not a bit of it: my fingers started to itch, and I couldn’tresist going back to school. So I’ve begun basic training, all over again, inone of Goliath’s minishuttles. Maybe Dim will actually let me solo…It’s not much bigger than Discovery’s pods - but what a difference! First ofall, of course, it doesn’t use rockets: I can’t get used to the luxury of theinertial drive, and unlimited range. Could fly back to Earth if I had to -though I’d probably get - remember the phrase I used once, and you guessed itsmeaning? - ’stir crazy’.The biggest difference, though, is the control system. It’s been a big challengefor me to get used to hands-off operation - and the computer has had to learn torecognize my voice commands. At first it was asking every five minutes ‘Do youreally mean that?’ I know it would be better to use the Braincap - but I’m stillnot completely confident with that gadget. Not sure if I’ll ever get used tosomething reading my mind.By the way, the shuttle’s called Falcon. It’s a nice name - and I wasdisappointed to find that no one aboard knew that it goes all the way back tothe Apollo missions, when we first landed on the Moon…Uh-huh - there was a lot more I wanted to say, but the skipper is calling.

Every day, at 18.00 hours, all personnel gathered for dinner in thewardroom, which in zero-gee could hold at least thirty people in comfort, ifspread uniformly around the walls. However, most of the time the ship’s workingareas were held at lunar gravity, so there was an undeniable floor - and morethan eight bodies made a crowd.The semi-circular table that unfolded around the auto-chef at mealtimes couldjust seat the entire seven-person crew, with the Captain at the place of honour.One extra created such insuperable problems that somebody now had to eat alonefor every meal. After much good-natured debate, it was decided to make thechoice in alphabetical order - not of proper names, which were hardly ever used,but of nicknames. It had taken Poole some time to get used to them: ‘Bolts’(structural engineering); ‘Chips’ (computers and communications); ‘First’ (FirstMate); ‘Life’ (medical and life-support systems); ‘Props’ (propulsion andpower); and ‘Stars’ (orbits and navigation).During the ten-day voyage, as he listened to the stories, jokes and complaintsof his temporary shipmates, Poole learned more about the solar system thanduring his months on Earth. All aboard were obviously delighted to have a newand perhaps naïve listener as an attentive one-man audience, but Poole wasseldom taken in by their more imaginative stories.Yet sometimes it was hard to know where to draw the line. No one really believedin the Golden Asteroid, which was usually regarded as a twenty-fourth-centuryhoax. But what about the Mercurian plasmoids, which had been reported by atleast a dozen reliable witnesses during the last five hundred years?The simplest explanation was that they were related to ball-lightning,responsible for so many ‘Unidentified Flying Object’ reports on Earth and Mars.But some observers swore that they had shown purposefulness - eveninquisitiveness - when they were encountered at close quarters. Nonsense,answered the sceptics - merely electrostatic attraction!Inevitably, this led to discussions about life in the Universe, and Poole foundhimself - not for the first time -defending his own era against its extremes ofcredulity and scepticism. Although the ‘Aliens are among us’ mania had alreadysubsided when he was a boy, even as late as the 2020s the Space Agency was stillplagued by lunatics who claimed to have been contacted - or abducted - byvisitors from other worlds. Their delusions had been reinforced by sensationalmedia exploitation, and the whole syndrome was later enshrined in the medicalliterature as ‘Adamski’s Disease’.The discovery of TMA ONE had, paradoxically, put an end to this sorry nonsense,by demonstrating that though there was indeed intelligence elsewhere, it hadapparently not concerned itself with Mankind for several million years. TMA ONEhad also convincingly refuted the handful of scientists who argued that lifeabove the bacterial level was such an improbable phenomenon that the human racewas alone in this Galaxy - if not the Cosmos.Goliath’s crew was more interested in the technology than the politics andeconomics of Poole’s era, and were particularly fascinated by the revolutionthat had taken place in his own lifetime - the end of the fossil-fuel age,triggered by the harnessing of vacuum energy. They found it hard to imagine thesmog-choked cities of the twentieth century, and the waste, greed and appallingenvironmental disasters of the Oil Age.‘Don’t blame me,’ said Poole, fighting back gamely after one round of criticism.‘Anyway, see what a mess the twenty-first century made.’There was a chorus of ‘What do you mean?’s around the table.‘Well, as soon as the so-called Age of Infinite Power got under way, andeveryone had thousands of kilowatts of cheap, clean energy to play with - youknow what happened!’‘Oh, you mean the Thermal Crisis. But that was fixed.’‘Eventually - after you’d covered half the Earth with reflectors to bounce theSun’s heat back into space. Otherwise it would have been as parboiled as Venusby now.’The crew’s knowledge of Third Millennium history was so surprisingly limitedthat Poole - thanks to the intensive education he had received in Star City -could often amaze them with details of events centuries after his own time.However, he was flattered to discover how well-acquainted they were withDiscovery’s log, it had become one of the classic records of the Space Age. Theylooked on it as he might have regarded a Viking saga; often he had to remindhimself that he was midway in time between Goliath and the first ships to crossthe western ocean…‘On your Day 86,’ Stars reminded him, at dinner on the fifth evening, ‘youpassed within two thousand kay of asteroid 7794 - and shot a probe into it. Doyou remember?”‘Of course I do,’ Poole answered rather brusquely ‘To me, it happened less thana year ago’‘Um, sorry. Well, tomorrow we’ll be even closer to 13,445. Like to have a look?’With autoguidance and freeze-frame, we should have a window all of tenmilliseconds wide.’A hundredth of a second! That few minutes in Discovery had seemed hectic enough,but now everything would happen fifty times faster.‘How large is it?’ Poole asked.‘Thirty by twenty by fifteen metres,’ Stars replied. ‘Looks like a batteredbrick.’‘Sorry we don’t have a slug to fire at it,’ said Props. ‘Did you ever wonder if7794 would hit back?’‘Never occurred to us. But it did give the astronomers a lot of usefulinformation, so it was worth the risk… Anyway, a hundredth of a second hardlyseems worth the bother. Thanks all the same.’‘I understand. When you’ve seen one asteroid, you’ve seen them -’‘Not true, Chips. When I was on Eros -’‘As you’ve told us at least a dozen times -, Poole’s mind tuned out thediscussion, so that it was a background of meaningless noise. He was a thousandyears in the past, recalling the only excitement of Discovery’s mission beforethe final disaster. Though he and Bowman were perfectly aware that 7794 wasmerely a lifeless, airless chunk of rock, that knowledge scarcely affected theirfeelings. It was the only solid matter they would meet this side of Jupiter, andthey had stared at it with the emotions of sailors on a long sea voyage,skirting a coast on which they could not land.It was turning slowly end over end, and there were mottled patches of light andshade distributed at random over its surface. Sometimes it sparkled like adistant window, as planes or outcroppings of crystalline material flashed in theSun…He remembered, also, the mounting tension as they waited to see if their aim hadbeen accurate. It was not easy to hit such a small target, two thousandkilometres away, moving at a relative velocity of twenty kilometres a second.Then, against the darkened portion of the asteroid, there had been a sudden,dazzling explosion of light. The tiny slug - pure Uranium 238 - had impacted atmeteoric speed: in a fraction of a second, all its kinetic energy had beentransformed into heat. A puff of incandescent gas had erupted briefly intospace, and Discovery’s cameras were recording the rapidly fading spectral lines,looking for the tell-tale signatures of glowing atoms. A few hours later, backon Earth, the astronomers learned for the first time the composition of anasteroid’s crust. There were no major surprises, but several bottles ofchampagne changed hands.Captain Chandler himself took little part in the very democratic discussionsaround his semi-circular table: he seemed content to let his crew relax andexpress their feelings in this informal atmosphere. There was only one unspokenrule: no serious business at mealtimes. If there were any technical oroperational problems, they had to be dealt with elsewhere.Poole had been surprised - and a little shocked - to discover that the crew’sknowledge of Goliath’s systems was very superficial. Often he had askedquestions which should have been easily answered, only to be referred to theship’s own memory banks. After a while, however, he realized that the sort ofin-depth training he had received in his days was no longer possible: far toomany complex systems were involved for any man or woman’s mind to master. Thevarious specialists merely had to know what their equipment did, not how.Reliability depended on redundancy and automatic checking, and humanintervention was much more likely to do harm than good.Fortunately none was required on this voyage: it had been as uneventful as anyskipper could have hoped, when the new sun of Lucifer dominated the sky ahead.III THE WORLDS OF GALILEO(Extract, text only, Tourist’s Guide to Outer Solar System, v 219.3)Even today, the giant satellites of what was once Jupiter present us with majormysteries. Why are four worlds, orbiting the same primary and very similar insize, so different in most other respects?Only in the case of Io, the innermost satellite, is there a convincingexplanation. It is so close to Jupiter that the gravitational tides constantlykneading its interior generate colossal quantities of heat - so much, indeed,that Io’s surface is semi-molten. It is the most volcanically active world inthe Solar System; maps of Io have a half-life of only a few decades.Though no permanent human bases have ever been established in such an unstableenvironment, there have been numerous landings and there is continuous robotmonitoring. (For the tragic fate of the 2571 Expedition, see Beagle 5.)Europa, second in distance from Jupiter, was originally entirely covered in ice,and showed few surface features except a complicated network of cracks. Thetidal forces which dominate Io were much less powerful here, but produced enoughheat to give Europa a global ocean of liquid water, in which many strangelife-forms have evolved.In 2010 the Chinese ship Tsien touched down on Europa on one of the few outcropsof solid rock protruding through the crust of ice. In doing so it disturbed acreature of the Europan abyss and was destroyed (see Spacecraft Tsien, Galaxy,Universe).Since the conversion of Jupiter into the mini-sun Lucifer in 2061, virtually allof Europa’s ice-cover has melted, and extensive vulcanism has created severalsmall islands.As is well-known, there have been no landings on Europa for almost a thousandyears, but the satellite is under continuous surveillance.Ganymede, largest moon in the Solar System (diameter 5260 kilometres), has alsobeen affected by the creation of a new sun, and its equatorial regions are warmenough to sustain terrestrial life-forms, though it does not yet have abreathable atmosphere. Most of its population is actively engaged interraforming and scientific research; the main settlement is Anubis (pop41,000), near the South Pole.Callisto is again wholly different. Its entire surface is covered by impactcraters of all sizes, so numerous that they overlap. The bombardment must havecontinued for millions of years, for the newer craters have completelyobliterated the earlier ones. There is no permanent base on Callisto, butseveral automatic stations have been established there."},{"pageContent":"3001: THE FINAL ODISSEY17 GANYMEDEIt was unusual for Frank Poole to oversleep, but he had been kept awake bystrange dreams. Past and present were inextricably mixed; sometimes he was onDiscovery, sometimes in the Africa Tower - and sometimes he was a boy again,among friends he had thought long-forgotten.Where am I? he asked himself as he struggled up to consciousness, like a swimmertrying to get back to the surface. There was a small window just above his bed,covered by a curtain not thick enough to completely block the light fromoutside. There had been a time, around the mid-twentieth century, when aircrafthad been slow enough to feature First Class sleeping accommodation: Poole hadnever sampled this nostalgic luxury, which some tourist organizations had stilladvertised in his own day, but he could easily imagine that he was doing so now.He drew the curtain and looked out. No, he had not awakened in the skies ofEarth, though the landscape unrolling below was not unlike the Antarctic. Butthe South Pole had never boasted two suns, both rising at once as Goliath swepttowards them.The ship was orbiting less than a hundred kilometres above what appeared to bean immense ploughed field, lightly dusted with snow. But the ploughman must havebeen drunk - or the guidance system must have gone crazy - for the furrowsmeandered in every direction, sometimes cutting across each other or turningback on themselves. Here and there the terrain was dotted with faint circles-ghost craters from meteor impacts aeons ago.So this is Ganymede, Poole wondered drowsily. Mankind’s furthest outpost fromhome! Why should any sensible person want to live here? Well, I’ve often thoughtthat when I’ve flown over Greenland or Iceland in winter-time…There was a knock on the door, a ‘Mind if I come in?’, and Captain Chandler didso without waiting for a reply.‘Thought we’d let you sleep until we landed - that end-of-trip party did lastlonger than I’d intended, but I couldn’t risk a mutiny by cutting it short.’Poole laughed.‘Has there ever been a mutiny in space?’‘Oh, quite a few but not in my time. Now we’ve mentioned the subject, you mightsay that Hal started the tradition… sorry - perhaps I shouldn’t - look - there’sGanymede City!’Coming up over the horizon was what appeared to be a criss-cross pattern ofstreets and avenues, intersecting almost at right-angles but with the slightirregularity typical of any settlement that had grown by accretion, withoutcentral planning. It was bisected by a broad river - Poole recalled that theequatorial regions of Ganymede were now warm enough for liquid water to exist -and it reminded him of an old wood-cut he had seen of medieval London.Then he noticed that Chandler was looking at him with an expression ofamusement… and the illusion vanished as he realized the scale of the ‘city’.‘The Ganymedeans,’ he said dryly, ‘must have been rather large, to have maderoads five or ten kilometres wide.’‘Twenty in some places. Impressive, isn’t it? And all the result of icestretching and contracting. Mother Nature is ingenious… I could show you somepatterns that look even more artificial, though they’re not as large as thisone.’‘When I was a boy, there was a big fuss about a face on Mars. Of course, itturned out to be a hill that had been carved by sand-storms… lots of similarones in Earth’s deserts.’‘Didn’t someone say that history always repeats itself? Same sort of nonsensehappened with Ganymede City - some nuts claimed it had been built by aliens. ButI’m afraid it won’t be around much longer.’‘Why?’ asked Poole in surprise.‘It’s already started to collapse, as Lucifer melts the permafrost. You won’trecognize Ganymede in another hundred years… there’s the edge of Lake Gilgamesh- if you look carefully - over on the right-’‘I see what you mean. What’s happening - surely the water’s not boiling, even atthis low pressure?’‘Electrolysis plant. Don’t know how many skillions of kilograms of oxygen a day.Of course, the hydrogen goes up and gets lost - we hope.’Chandler’s voice trailed off into silence. Then he resumed, in an unusuallydiffident tone: ‘All that beautiful water down there - Ganymede doesn’t needhalf of it! Don’t tell anyone, but I’ve been working out ways of getting some toVenus.’‘Easier than nudging comets?’‘As far as energy is concerned, yes - Ganymede’s escape velocity is only threeklicks per second. And much, much quicker - years instead of decades. But thereare a few practical difficulties..‘I can appreciate that. Would you shoot it off by a mass-launcher?’‘Oh no - I’d use towers reaching up through the atmosphere, like the ones onEarth, but much smaller. We’d pump the water up to the top, freeze it down tonear absolute zero, and let Ganymede sling it off in the right direction as itrotated. There would be some evaporation loss in transit, but most of it wouldarrive - what’s so funny?’‘Sorry - I’m not laughing at the idea - it makes good sense. But you’ve broughtback such a vivid memory. We used to have a garden sprinkler - driven round andround by its water jets. What you’re planning is the same thing - on a slightlybigger scale… using a whole world…’Suddenly, another image from his past obliterated all else. Poole rememberedhow, in those hot Arizona days, he and Rikki had loved to chase each otherthrough the clouds of moving mist, from the slowly revolving spray of the gardensprinkler.Captain Chandler was a much more sensitive man than he pretended to be: he knewwhen it was time to leave.‘Gotta get back to the bridge,’ he said gruffly. ‘See you when we land atAnubis.’"},{"pageContent":"3001: THE FINAL ODISSEY18 GRAND HOTELThe Grand Ganymede Hotel - inevitably known throughout the Solar System as‘Hotel Grannymede’ was certainly not grand, and would be lucky to get a ratingof one-and-a-half stars on Earth. As the nearest competition was several hundredmillion kilometres away, the management felt little need to exert itself unduly.Yet Poole had no complaints, though he often wished that Danil was still around,to help him with the mechanics of life and to communicate more efficiently withthe semi-intelligent devices with which he was surrounded. He had known a briefmoment of panic when the door had closed behind the (human) bellboy, who hadapparently been too awed by his guest to explain how any of the room’s servicesfunctioned. After five minutes of fruitless talking to the unresponsive walls,Poole had finally made contact with a system that understood his accent and hiscommands. What an ‘All Worlds’ news item it would have made - ‘Historicastronaut starves to death, trapped in Ganymede hotel room’!And there would have been a double irony. Perhaps the naming of the Grannymede’sonly luxury suite was inevitable, but it had been a real shock to meet anancient life-size holo of his old shipmate, in full-dress uniform, as he was ledinto - the Bowman Suite. Poole even recognized the image: his own officialportrait had been made at the same time, a few days before the mission began.He soon discovered that most of his Goliath crewmates had domestic arrangementsin Anubis, and were anxious for him to meet their Significant Others during theship’s planned twenty-day stop. Almost immediately he was caught up in thesocial and professional life of this frontier settlement, and it was AfricaTower that now seemed a distant dream.Like many Americans, in their secret hearts, Poole had a nostalgic affection forsmall communities where everyone knew everyone else - in the real world, and notthe virtual one of cyberspace. Anubis, with a resident population less than thatof his remembered Flagstaff, was not a bad approximation to this ideal.The three main pressure domes, each two kilometres in diameter, stood on aplateau overlooking an ice-field which stretched unbroken to the horizon.Ganymede’s second sun- once known as Jupiter - would never give sufficient heat to melt the polarcaps. This was the principal reason for establishing Anubis in such aninhospitable spot: the city’s foundations were not likely to collapse for atleast several centuries.And inside the domes, it was easy to be completely indifferent to the outsideworld. Poole, when he had mastered the mechanisms of the Bowman Suite,discovered that he had a limited but impressive choice of environments. He couldsit beneath palm trees on a Pacific beach, listening to the gentle murmur of thewaves - or, if he preferred, the roar of a tropical hurricane. He could flyslowly along the peaks of the Himalayas, or down the immense canyons of MarinerValley. He could walk through the gardens of Versailles or down the streets ofhalf a dozen great cities, at several widely spaced times in their history. Evenif the Hotel Grannymede was not one of the Solar System’s most highly acclaimedresorts, it boasted facilities which would have astounded all its more famouspredecessors on Earth.But it was ridiculous to indulge in terrestrial nostalgia, when he had comehalf-way across the Solar System to visit a strange new world. After someexperimenting, Poole arranged a compromise, for enjoyment - and inspiration-during his steadily fewer moments of leisure.To his great regret, he had never been to Egypt, so it was delightful to relaxbeneath the gaze of the Sphinx - as it was before its controversial‘restoration’ - and to watch tourists scrambling up the massive blocks of theGreat Pyramid. The illusion was perfect, apart from the no-man’s-land where thedesert clashed with the (slightly worn) carpet of the Bowman Suite.The sky, however, was one that no human eyes had seen until five thousand yearsafter the last stone was laid at Giza. But it was not an illusion; it was thecomplex and ever-changing reality of Ganymede.Because this world - like its companions - had been robbed of its spin aeons agoby the tidal drag of Jupiter, the new sun born from the giant planet hungmotionless in its sky. One side of Ganymede was in perpetual Lucifer-light - andalthough the other hemisphere was often referred to as the ‘Night Land’, thatdesignation was as misleading as the much earlier phrase ‘The dark side of theMoon’. Like the lunar Farside, Ganymede’s ‘Night Land’ had the brilliant lightof old Sol for half of its long day.By a coincidence more confusing than useful, Ganymede took almost exactly oneweek - seven days, three hours -to orbit its primary. Attempts to create a ‘OneMede day = one Earth week’ calendar had generated so much chaos that they hadbeen abandoned centuries ago. Like all the other residents of the Solar System,the locals employed Universal Time, identifying their twenty-four-hour standarddays by numbers rather than names.Since Ganymede’s newborn atmosphere was still extremely thin and almostcloudless, the parade of heavenly bodies provided a never-ending spectacle. Attheir closest, Io and Callisto each appeared about half the size of the Moon asseen from Earth - but that was the only thing they had in common. Io was soclose to Lucifer that it took less than two days to race around its orbit, andshowed visible movement even in a matter of minutes. Callisto, at over fourtimes Io’s distance, required two Mede days - or sixteen Earth ones - tocomplete its leisurely circuit.The physical contrast between the two worlds was even more remarkable.Deep-frozen Callisto had been almost unchanged by Jupiter’s conversion into amini-sun: it was still a wasteland of shallow ice craters, so closely packedthat there was not a single spot on the entire satellite that had escaped frommultiple impacts, in the days when Jupiter’s enormous gravity field wascompeting with Saturn’s to gather up the debris of the outer Solar System. Sincethen, apart from a few stray shots, nothing had happened for several billionyears.On Io, something was happening every week. As a local wit had remarked, beforethe creation of Lucifer it had been Hell - now it was Hell warmed up.Often, Poole would zoom into that burning landscape and look into the sulphurousthroats of volcanoes that were continually reshaping an area larger than Africa.Sometimes incandescent fountains would soar briefly hundreds of kilometres intospace, like gigantic trees of fire growing on a lifeless world.As the floods of molten sulphur spread out from volcanoes and vents, theversatile element changed through a narrow spectrum of reds and oranges andyellows when, chameleon-like, it was transformed into its vari-colouredallotropes. Before the dawn of the Space Age, no one had ever imagined that sucha world existed. Fascinating though it was to observe it from his comfortablevantage point, Poole found it hard to believe that men had ever risked landingthere, where even robots feared to tread… His main interest, however, wasEuropa, which at its closest appeared almost exactly the same size as Earth’ssolitary Moon, but raced through its phases in only four days. Though Poole hadbeen quite unconscious of the symbolism when he chose his private landscape, itnow seemed wholly appropriate that Europa should hang in the sky above anothergreat enigma - the Sphinx.Even with no magnification, when he requested the naked-eye view, Poole couldsee how greatly Europa had changed in the thousand years since Discovery had setout for Jupiter. The spider’s web of narrow bands and lines that had oncecompletely enveloped the smallest of the four Galilean satellites had vanished,except around the poles. Here the global crust of kilometre-thick ice remainedunmelted by the warmth of Europa’s new sun: elsewhere, virgin oceans seethed andboiled in the thin atmosphere, at what would have been comfortable roomtemperature on Earth.It was also a comfortable temperature to the creatures who had emerged, afterthe melting of the unbroken ice shield that had both trapped and protected them.Orbiting spysats, showing details only centimetres across, had watched oneEuropan species starting to evolve into an amphibious stage: though they stillspent much of their time underwater, the ‘Europs’ had even begun theconstruction of simple buildings.That this could happen in a mere thousand years was astonishing, but no onedoubted that the explanation lay in the last and greatest of the Monoliths - themany-kilometre-long ‘Great Wall’ standing on the shore of the Sea of Galilee.And no one doubted that, in its own mysterious way, it was watching over theexperiment it had started on this world - as it had done on Earth four millionyears before."},{"pageContent":"3001: THE FINAL ODISSEY19 THE MADNESS OF MANKINDMISS PRINGLEFILE INDRAMy dear Indra - sorry I’ve not even voice-mailed you before - usual excuse, ofcourse, so I won’t bother to give it.To answer your question - yes, I’m now feeling quite at home at the Grannymede,but am spending less and less time there, though I’ve been enjoying the skydisplay I’ve had piped into my suite. Last night the Io flux-tube put on a fineperformance - that’s a kind of lightning discharge between Io and Jupiter - Imean Lucifer. Rather like Earth’s aurora, but much more spectacular. Discoveredby the radio astronomers even before I was born.And talking about ancient times - did you know that Anubis has a Sheriff? Ithink that’s overdoing the frontier spirit. Reminds me of the stories mygrandfather used to tell me about Arizona… Must try some of them on the Medes…This may sound silly - I’m still not used to being in the Bowman Suite. I keeplooking over my shoulder…How do I spend my time? Much the same as in Africa Tower. I’m meeting the localintelligentsia, though as you might expect they’re rather thin on the ground(hope no one is bugging this). And I’ve interacted - real and virtual - with theeducational system - very good, it seems, though more technically oriented thanyou’d approve. That’s inevitable, of course, in this hostile environment…But it’s helped me to understand why people live here. There’s a challenge - asense of purpose, if you like - that I seldom found on Earth.It’s true that most of the Medes were born here, so don’t know any other home.Though they’re - usually - too polite to say so, they think that the Home Planetis becoming decadent. Are you? And if so, what are you Terries - as the localscall you - going to do about it? One of the teenage classes I’ve met hopes towake you up. They’re drawing up elaborate Top Secret plans for the Invasion ofEarth. Don’t say I didn’t warn you…I’ve made one trip outside Anubis, into the so-called Night Land, where theynever see Lucifer. Ten of us -Chandler, two of Goliath’s crew, six Medes - wentinto Farside, and chased the Sun down to the horizon so it really was night.Awesome - much like polar winters on Earth, but with the sky completely black…almost felt I was in space.We could see all the Galileans beautifully, and watched Europa eclipse - sorry,occult - Io. Of course, the trip had been timed so we could observe this…Several of the smaller satellites were just also visible, but the double starEarth-Moon was much more conspicuous. Did I feel homesick? Frankly, no - thoughI miss my new friends back there…And I’m sorry - I still haven’t met Dr Khan, though he’s left several messagesfor me. I promise to do it in the next few days - Earth days, not Mede ones!Best wishes to Joe - regards to Danil, if you know what’s happened to him - ishe a real person again? - and my love to yourself.STORE TRANSMITBack in Poole’s century, a person’s name often gave a clue to his/herappearance, but that was no longer true thirty generations later. Dr TheodoreKhan turned out to be a Nordic blond who might have looked more at home in aViking longboat than ravaging the steppes of Central Asia: however, he would nothave been too impressive in either role, being less than a hundred and fiftycentimetres tall. Poole could not resist a little amateur psychoanalysis: smallpeople were often aggressive over-achievers - which, from Indra Wallace’s hints,appeared to be a good description of Ganymede’s sole resident philosopher. Khanprobably needed these qualifications, to survive in such a practically-mindedsociety.Anubis City was far too small to boast a university campus - a luxury whichstill existed on the other worlds, though many believed that thetelecommunications revolution had made it obsolete. Instead, it had somethingmuch more appropriate, as well as centuries older - an Academy, complete with agrove of olive trees that would have fooled Plato himself, until he hadattempted to walk through it. Indra’s joke about departments of philosophyrequiring no more equipment than blackboards clearly did not apply in thissophisticated environment.‘It’s built to hold seven people,’ said Dr Khan proudly, when they had settleddown on chairs obviously designed to be not-too-comfortable, ‘because that’s themaximum one can efficiently interact with. And, if you count the ghost ofSocrates, it was the number present when Phaedo delivered his famous address…’‘The one on the immortality of the soul?’Khan was so obviously surprised that Poole could not help laughing.‘I took a crash course in philosophy just before I graduated - when the syllabuswas planned, someone decided that we hairy-knuckled engineers should be exposedto a little culture.’‘I’m delighted to hear it. That makes things so much easier. You know - I stillcan’t credit my luck. Your arrival here almost tempts me to believe in miracles!I’d even thought of going to Earth to meet you - has dear Indra told you aboutmy - ah - obsession?’‘No,’ Poole answered, not altogether truthfully.Dr Khan looked very pleased; he was clearly delighted to find a new audience.‘You may have heard me called an atheist, but that’s not quite true. Atheism isunprovable, so uninteresting. Equally, however unlikely it is, we can never becertain that God once existed - and has now shot off to infinity, where no onecan ever find him… Like Gautama Buddha, I take no position on this subject. Myfield of interest is the psychopathology known as Religion.’‘Psychopathology? That’s a harsh judgement.’‘Amply justified by history. Imagine that you’re an intelligentextraterrestrial, concerned only with verifiable truths. You discover a specieswhich has divided itself into thousands - no by now millions - of tribal groupsholding an incredible variety of beliefs about the origin of the universe andthe way to behave in it. Although many of them have ideas in common, even whenthere’s a ninety-nine per cent overlap, the remaining one per cent is enough toset them killing and torturing each other, over trivial points of doctrine,utterly meaningless to outsiders.’‘How to account for such irrational behaviour? Lucretius hit it on the nail whenhe said that religion was the by-product of fear - a reaction to a mysteriousand often hostile universe. For much of human prehistory, it may have been anecessary evil - but why was it so much more evil than necessary - and why didit survive when it was no longer necessary?‘I said evil - and I mean it, because fear leads to cruelty. The slightestknowledge of the Inquisition makes one ashamed to belong to the human species…One of the most revolting books ever published was the Hammer of Witches,written by a couple of sadistic perverts and describing the tortures the Churchauthorized - encouraged! - to extract “confessions” from thousands of harmlessold women, before it burned them alive… The Pope himself wrote an approvingforeword!’‘But most of the other religions, with a few honourable exceptions, were just asbad as Christianity… Even in your century, little boys were kept chained andwhipped until they’d memorized whole volumes of pious gibberish, and robbed oftheir childhood and manhood to become monks…’‘Perhaps the most baffling aspect of the whole affair is how obvious madmen,century after century, would proclaim that they - and they alone! - had receivedmessages from God. If all the messages had agreed, that would have settled thematter. But of course they were wildly discordant - which never preventedself-styled messiahs from gathering hundreds - sometimes millions - ofadherents, who would fight to the death against equally deluded believers of amicroscopically differing faith.’Poole thought it was about time he got a word in edgeways.‘You’ve reminded me of something that happened in my home-town when I was a kid.A holy man - quote, unquote - set up shop, claimed he could work miracles - andcollected a crowd of devotees in next to no time. And they weren’t ignorant orilliterate; often they came from the best families. Every Sunday I used to seeexpensive cars parked round his - ah - temple.’‘The “Rasputin Syndrome”, it’s been called: there are millions of such cases,all through history, in every country. And about one time in a thousand the cultsurvives for a couple of generations. What happened in this case?’‘Well, the competition was very unhappy, and did its best to discredit him. WishI could remember his name - he used a long Indian one - Swami something-or-other- but it turned out he came from Alabama. One of his tricks was to produce holyobjects out of thin air, and hand them to his worshippers. As it happened, ourlocal rabbi was an amateur conjuror, and gave public demonstrations showingexactly how it was done. Didn’t make the slightest difference - the faithfulsaid that their man’s magic was real, and the rabbi was just jealous.’‘At one time, I’m sorry to say, Mother took the rascal seriously - it was soonafter Dad had run off, which may have had something to do with it - and draggedme to one of his sessions. I was only about ten, but I thought I’d never seenanyone so unpleasant-looking. He had a beard that could have held several birds’nests, and probably did.’‘He sounds like the standard model. How long did he flourish?’‘Three or four years. And then he had to leave town in a hurry: he was caughtrunning teenage orgies. Of course, he claimed he was using mystical soul-savingtechniques. And you won’t believe this -,‘Try me.’‘Even then, lots of his dupes still had faith in him. Their god could do nowrong, so he must have been framed.’‘Framed?’‘Sorry - convicted by faked evidence - sometimes used by the police to catchcriminals, when all else fails.’‘Hmm. Well, your swami was perfectly typical: I’m rather disappointed. But hedoes help to prove my case -that most of humanity has always been insane, atleast some of the time.’‘Rather an unrepresentative sample - one small Flagstaff suburb.’‘True, but I could multiply it by thousands - not only in your century, but alldown the ages. There’s never been anything, however absurd, that countlesspeople weren’t prepared to believe, often so passionately that they’d fight tothe death rather than abandon their illusions. To me, that’s a good operationaldefinition of insanity.’‘Would you argue that anyone with strong religious beliefs was insane?’‘In a strictly technical sense, yes - if they really were sincere, and nothypocrites. As I suspect ninety per cent were.’‘I’m certain that Rabbi Berenstein was sincere - and he was one of the sanestmen I ever knew, as well as one of the finest. And how do you account for this?The only real genius I ever met was Dr Chandra, who led the HAL project. I oncehad to go into his office - there was no reply when I knocked, and I thought itwas unoccupied.’‘He was praying to a group of fantastic little bronze statues, draped withflowers. One of them looked like an elephant… another had more than the regularnumber of arms… I was quite embarrassed, but luckily he didn’t hear me and Itiptoed out. Would you say he was insane?’‘You’ve chosen a bad example: genius often is! So let’s say: not insane, butmentally impaired, owing to childhood conditioning. The Jesuits claimed: “Giveme a boy for six years, and he is mine for life.” If they’d got hold of littleChandra in time, he’d have been a devout Catholic - not a Hindu.’‘Possibly. But I’m puzzled - why were you so anxious to meet me? I’m afraid I’venever been a devout anything. What have I got to do with all this?’Slowly, and with the obvious enjoyment of a man unburdening himself of a heavy,long-hoarded secret, Dr Khan told him."},{"pageContent":"3001: THE FINAL ODISSEY20 APOSTATERECORD POOLEHello, Frank… So you’ve finally met Ted.

That would have been his hero, Pius XX - I’m sure I mentionedhim to you. Look him up - he’s usually called the Impius! It’s a fascinatingstory, and exactly parallels something that happened just before you were born.You must know how Mikhail Gorbachev, the President of the Soviet Empire, broughtabout its dissolution at the end of the twentieth century, by exposing itscrimes and excesses.He didn’t intend to go that far - he’d hoped to reform it, but that was nolonger possible. We’ll never know if Pius XX had the same idea, because he wasassassinated by a demented cardinal soon after he’d horrified the world byreleasing the secret files of the Inquisition…The religious were still shaken by the discovery of TMA ZERO only a few decadesearlier - that had a great impact on Pius XX, and certainly influenced hisactions…But you still haven’t told me how Ted, that old cryptoDeist, thinks you can helphim in his search for God.

Never thought I’d get into philosophy again afterall these years of engineering. Perhaps I had to go through them first, toappreciate it. Wonder how he’d grade me as a student?Yesterday I tried this line of approach, to see his reaction. Perhaps it’soriginal, though I doubt it. Thought you’d like to hear it - will be interestedin your comments. Here’s our discussion -MISS PRINGLE COPY AUDIO 94.‘Surely, Ted, you can’t deny that most of the greatest works of human art havebeen inspired by religious devotion. Doesn’t that prove something?’‘Yes - but not in a way that will give much comfort to any believers! From timeto time, people amuse themselves making lists of the Biggests and Greatests andBests - I’m sure that was a popular entertainment in your day.’‘It certainly was.’‘Well, there have been some famous attempts to do this with the arts. Of coursesuch lists can’t establish absolute - eternal - values, but they’re interestingand show how tastes change from age to age.’‘The last list I saw - it was on the Earth Artnet only a few years ago - wasdivided into Architecture, Music, Visual Arts… I remember a few of the examples…the Parthenon, the Taj Mahal… Bach’s Toccata and Fugue was first in music,followed by Verdi’s Requiem Mass. In art - the Mona Lisa, of course. Then - notsure of the order - a group of Buddha statues somewhere in Ceylon, and thegolden death-mask of young King Tut.‘Even if I could remember all the others - which of course I can’t - it doesn’tmatter: the important thing is their cultural and religious backgrounds.Overall, no single religion dominated - except in music. And that could be dueto a purely technological accident: the organ and the other pre-electronicmusical instruments were perfected in the Christianized West. It could haveworked out quite differently… if, for example, the Greeks or the Chinese hadregarded machines as something more than toys.‘But what really settles the argument, as far as I’m concerned, is the generalconsensus about the single greatest work of human art. Over and over again, inalmost every listing - it’s Angkor Wat. Yet the religion that inspired that hasbeen extinct for centuries - no one even knows precisely what it was, exceptthat it involved hundreds of gods, not merely one!’‘Wish I could have thrown that at dear old Rabbi Berenstein - I’m sure he’d havehad a good answer.’‘I don’t doubt it. I wish I could have met him myself. And I’m glad he neverlived to see what happened to Israel.’END AUDIO.There you have it, Indra. Wish the Grannymede had Angkor Wat on its menu - I’venever seen it - but you can’t have everything…Now, the question you really wanted answered… why is Dr Ted so delighted thatI’m here?As you know, he’s convinced that the key to many mysteries lies on Europa -where no one has been allowed to land for a thousand years.He thinks I may be an exception. He believes I have a friend there. Yes - DaveBowman, or whatever he’s now become…We know that he survived being drawn into the Big Brother Monolith - and somehowrevisited Earth afterwards. But there’s more, that I didn’t know. Very fewpeople do, because the Medes are embarrassed to talk about it…Ted Khan has spent years collecting the evidence, and is now quite certain ofthe facts - even though he can’t explain them. On at least six occasions, abouta century apart, reliable observers here in Anubis have reported seeing an -apparition - just like the one that Heywood Floyd met aboard Discovery. Thoughnot one of them knew about that incident, they were all able to identify Davewhen they were shown his hologram. And there was another sighting aboard asurvey ship that made a close approach to Europa, six hundred years ago…Individually, no one would take these cases seriously - but altogether they makea pattern. Ted’s quite sure that Dave Bowman survives in some form, presumablyassociated with the Monolith we call the Great Wall. And he still has someinterest in our affairs.Though he’s made no attempt at communication, Ted hopes we can make contact.

Why do youask?’‘If it wasn’t a ghost, it was the most vivid dream I’ve ever had. Last night Ihad a conversation with Dave Bowman.’Poole knew that Captain Chandler would take him seriously, when the occasionrequired; nor was he disappointed.‘Interesting - but there’s an obvious explanation. You’ve been living here inthe Bowman Suite, for Deus’s sake! You told me yourself it feels haunted.’‘I’m sure - well, ninety-nine per cent sure - that you’re right, and the wholething was prompted by the discussions I’ve been having with Prof. Ted. Have youheard the reports that Dave Bowman occasionally appears in Anubis? About onceevery hundred years? Just as he did to Dr Floyd aboard Discovery, after she’dbeen reactivated.’‘What happened there? I’ve heard vague stories, but never taken them seriously.’‘Dr Khan does - and so do I - I’ve seen the original recordings. Floyd’s sittingin my old chair when a kind of dust-cloud forms behind him, and shapes itselfinto Dave - though only the head has detail. Then it gives that famous message,warning him to leave.’‘Who wouldn’t have? But that was a thousand years ago. Plenty of time to fakeit.’‘What would be the point? Khan and I were looking at it yesterday. I’d bet mylife it’s authentic.’‘As a matter of fact, I agree with you. And I have heard those reports…’Chandler’s voice trailed away, and he looked slightly embarrassed.‘Long time ago, I had a girl-friend here in Anubis. She told me that hergrandfather had seen Bowman. I laughed.’‘I wonder if Ted has that sighting on his list. Could you put him in touch withyour friend?’‘Er - rather not. We haven’t spoken for years. For all I know, she may be on theMoon, or Mars… Anyway, why is Professor Ted interested?’‘That’s what I really wanted to discuss with you.’‘Sounds ominous. Go ahead,’‘Ted thinks that Dave Bowman - or whatever he’s become - may still exist - upthere on Europa.’‘After a thousand years?’‘Well - look at me.’‘One sample is poor statistics, my maths prof. used to say. But go on.’‘It’s a complicated story - or maybe a jigsaw, with most of the pieces missing.But it’s generally agreed that something crucial happened to our ancestors whenthat Monolith appeared in Africa, four million years ago. It marks a turningpoint in prehistory - the first appearance of tools - and weapons - andreligion… That can’t be pure coincidence. The Monolith must have done somethingto us - surely it couldn’t have just stood there, passively accepting worship…’‘Ted’s fond of quoting a famous palaeontologist who said “TMA ZERO gave us anevolutionary kick in the pants”. He argues that the kick wasn’t in a whollydesirable direction. Did we have to become so mean and nasty to survive? Maybewe did… As I understand him, Ted believes that there’s something fundamentallywrong with the wiring of our brains, which makes us incapable of consistentlogical thinking. To make matters worse, though all creatures need a certainamount of aggressiveness to survive, we seem to have far more than is absolutelynecessary. And no other animal tortures its fellows as we do. Is this anevolutionary accident - a piece of genetic bad luck?‘It’s also widely agreed that TMA ONE was planted on the Moon to keep track ofthe project - experiment - whatever it was - and to report to Jupiter - theobvious place for Solar System Mission Control. That’s why another Monolith -Big Brother - was waiting there. Had been waiting four million years, whenDiscovery arrived. Agreed so far?’‘Yes; I’ve always thought that was the most plausible theory.’‘Now for the more speculative stuff. Bowman was apparently swallowed up by BigBrother, yet something of his personality seems to have survived. Twenty yearsafter that encounter with Heywood Floyd in the second Jupiter expedition, theyhad another contact aboard Universe, when Floyd joined it for the 2061rendezvous with Halley’s Comet. At least, so he tells us in his memoirs - thoughhe was well over a hundred when he dictated them.’‘Could have been senile.’‘Not according to all the contemporary accounts! Also - perhaps even moresignificant - his grandson Chris had some equally weird experiences when Galaxymade its forced landing on Europa. And, of course, that’s where the Monolith -or a Monolith - is, right now! Surrounded by Europans…’‘I’m beginning to see what Dr Ted’s driving at. This is where we came in - thewhole cycle’s starting over again. The Europs are being groomed for stardom.’‘Exactly - everything fits. Jupiter ignited to give them a sun, to thaw outtheir frozen world. The warning to us to keep our distance - presumably so thatwe wouldn’t interfere with their development…’‘Where have I heard that idea before? Of course, Frank - it goes back a thousandyears - to your own time! “The Prime Directive”! We still get lots of laughsfrom those old Star Trek programmes.’‘Did I ever tell you I once met some of the actors? They would have beensurprised to see me now… And I’ve always had two thoughts about thatnon-interference policy. The Monolith certainly violated it with us, back therein Africa. One might argue that did have disastrous results…’‘So better luck next time - on Europa!’ Poole laughed, without much humour.‘Khan used those exact words.’‘And what does he think we should do about it? Above all - where do you comeinto the picture?’‘First of all, we must find what’s really happening on Europa - and why. Merelyobserving it from space is not enough.’‘What else can we do? All the probes the Medes have sent there were blown up,just before landing.’‘And ever since the mission to rescue Galaxy, crew-carrying ships have beendiverted by some field of force, which no one can figure out. Very interesting:it proves that whatever is down there is protective, but not malevolent. And -this is the important point - it must have some way of scanning what’s on theway. It can distinguish between robots and humans.’‘More than I can do, sometimes. Go on.’‘Well, Ted thinks there’s one human being who might make it down to the surfaceof Europa - because his old friend is there, and may have some influence withthe ‘powers-that-be.’Captain Dimitri Chandler gave a long, low whistle.‘And you’re willing to risk it?’‘Yes: what have I got to lose?’‘One valuable shuttle craft, if I know what you have in mind. Is that why you’vebeen learning to fly Falcon?’‘Well, now that you mention it… the idea had occurred to me.’‘I’ll have to think it over - I’ll admit I’m intrigued, but there are lots ofproblems.’‘Knowing you, I’m sure they won’t stand in the way - once you’ve decided to helpme.’"},{"pageContent":"3001: THE FINAL ODISSEY22 VENTUREMISS PRINGLE LIST PRIORITY MESSAGES FROM EARTHRECORDDear Indra - I’m not trying to be dramatic, but this may be my last message fromGanymede.

But I wouldn’t recommend it: our mysterious friendmight be alarmed by anyone coming in that fast.’‘Agreed and I want time to think. I’m going to take several hours, at least. AndI’m still hoping…’ Poole’s voice trailed off into silence.‘Hoping what?’‘That I can make some sort of contact with Dave, or whatever it is, before Iattempt to land.’‘Yes, it’s always rude to drop in uninvited - even with people you know, letalone perfect strangers like the Europs. Perhaps you should take some gifts -what did the old-time explorers use? I believe mirrors and beads were oncepopular.’Chandler’s facetious tone did not disguise his real concern, both for Poole andfor the valuable piece of equipment he proposed to borrow - and for which theskipper of Goliath was ultimately responsible.‘I’m still trying to decide how we work this. If you come back a hero, I want tobask in your reflected glory. But if you lose Falcon as well as yourself, whatshall I say? That you stole the shuttle while we weren’t looking? I’m afraid noone would buy that story. Ganymede Traffic Control’s very efficient - has to be!If you left without advance notice, they’d be on to you in a microsec - well, amillisecond. No way you could leave unless I file your flight-plan ahead oftime.’‘So this is what I propose to do, unless I think of something better.’‘You’re taking Falcon out for a final qualification test - everyone knows you’vealready soloed. You’ll go into a two-thousand-kilometre-high orbit above Europa- nothing unusual about that - people do it all the time, and the localauthorities don’t seem to object.’‘Estimated total flight time five hours plus or minus ten minutes. If yousuddenly change your mind about coming home, no one can do anything about it -at least, no one on Ganymede. Of course, I’ll make some indignant noises, andsay how astonished I am by such gross navigational errors, etc., etc. Whateverwill look best in the subsequent Court of Enquiry.’‘Would it come to that? I don’t want to do anything that will get you intotrouble.’‘Don’t worry - it’s time there was a little excitement round here. But only youand I know about this plot; try not to mention it to the crew - I want them tohave - what was that other useful expression you taught me? - “plausibledeniability”.’‘Thanks, Dim - I really appreciate what you’re doing. And I hope you’ll neverhave to regret hauling me aboard Goliath, out round Neptune.’Poole found it hard to avoid arousing suspicion, by the way he behaved towardshis new crewmates as they prepared Falcon for what was supposed to be a short,routine flight. Only he and Chandler knew that it might be nothing of the kind.Yet he was not heading into the totally unknown, as he and Dave Bowman had donea thousand years ago. Stored in the shuttle’s memory were high-resolution mapsof Europa showing details down to a few metres across. He knew exactly where hewished to go; it only remained to see if he would be allowed to break thecenturies-long quarantine."},{"pageContent":"3001: THE FINAL ODISSEY24 ESCAPE‘Manual control, please.’‘Are you sure, Frank?’‘Quite sure, Falcon… Thank you.’Illogical though it seemed, most of the human race had found it impossible notto be polite to its artificial children, however simple-minded they might be.Whole volumes of psychology, as well as popular guides (How Not to Hurt YourComputer’s Feelings; Artificial Intelligence - Real irritation were two of thebest-known titles) had been written on the subject of Man-Machine etiquette.Long ago it had been decided that, however inconsequential rudeness to robotsmight appear to be, it should be discouraged. All too easily, it could spread tohuman relationships as well.Falcon was now in orbit, just as her flight-plan had promised, at a safe twothousand kilometres above Europa. The giant moon’s crescent dominated the skyahead, and even the area not illuminated by Lucifer was so brilliantly lit bythe much more distant Sun that every detail was clearly visible. Poole needed nooptical aid to see his planned destination, on the still-icy shore of the Sea ofGalilee, not far from the skeleton of the first spacecraft to land on thisworld. Though the Europans had long ago removed all its metal components, theill-fated Chinese ship still served as a memorial to its crew; and it wasappropriate that the only ‘town’ - even if an alien one - on this whole worldshould have been named ‘Tsienville’.Poole had decided to come down over the Sea, and then fly very slowly towardsTsienville - hoping that this approach would appear friendly, or at leastnon-aggressive. Though he admitted to himself that this was very naïve, he couldthink of no better alternative.Then, suddenly, just as he was dropping below the thousand-kilometre level,there was an interruption - not of the kind he had hoped for, but one which hehad been expecting.‘This is Ganymede Control calling Falcon. You have departed from yourflight-plan. Please advise immediately what is happening.’It was hard to ignore such an urgent request, but in the circumstances it seemedthe best thing to do.Exactly thirty seconds later, and a hundred kilometres closer to Europa,Ganymede repeated its message. Once again Poole ignored it - but Falcon did not.‘Are you quite sure you want to do this, Frank?’ asked the shuttle. Though Pooleknew perfectly well that he was imagining it, he would have sworn there was anote of anxiety in its voice.‘Quite sure, Falcon. I know exactly what I’m doing.’That was certainly untrue, and any moment now further lying might be necessary,to a more sophisticated audience.Seldom-activated indicator lights started to flash near the edge of the controlboard. Poole smiled with satisfaction: everything was going according to plan.‘This is Ganymede Control! Do you receive me, Falcon? You are operating onmanual override, so I am unable to assist you. What is happening? You are stilldescending towards Europa. Please acknowledge immediately.’Poole began to experience mild twinges of conscience. He thought he recognizedthe Controller’s voice, and was almost certain that it was a charming lady hehad met at a reception given by the Mayor, soon after his arrival at Anubis. Shesounded genuinely alarmed.Suddenly, he knew how to relieve her anxiety - as well as to attempt somethingwhich he had previously dismissed as altogether too absurd. Perhaps, after all,it was worth a try: it certainly wouldn’t do any harm - and it might even work.‘This is Frank Poole, calling from Falcon. I am perfectly OK - but somethingseems to have taken over the controls, and is bringing the shuttle down towardsEuropa. I hope you are receiving this - I will continue to report as long aspossible.’Well, he hadn’t actually lied to the worried Controller, and one day he hoped hewould be able to face her with a clear conscience.He continued to talk, trying to sound as if he was completely sincere, insteadof skirting the edge of truth.‘This is Frank Poole aboard the shuttle Falcon, descending towards Europa. Iassume that some outside force has taken charge of my spacecraft, and will belanding it safely.’‘Dave - this is your old shipmate Frank. Are you the entity that is controllingme? I have reason to think that you are on Europa.‘If so - I look forward to meeting you - wherever or whatever you are.’Not for a moment did he imagine there would be any reply: even Ganymede Controlappeared to be shocked into silence.And yet, in a way, he had an answer. Falcon was still being permitted to descendtowards the Sea of Galilee.Europa was only fifty kilometres below; with his naked eyes Poole could now seethe narrow black bar where the greatest of the Monoliths stood guard - if indeedit was doing that - on the outskirts of Tsienville.No human being had been allowed to come so close for a thousand years."},{"pageContent":"3001: THE FINAL ODISSEY25 FIRE IN THE DEEPFor millions of years it had been an ocean world, its hidden waters protectedfrom the vacuum of space by a crust of ice. In most places the ice waskilometres thick, but there were lines of weakness where it had cracked open andtorn apart. Then there had been a brief battle between two implacably hostileelements that came into direct contact on no other world in the Solar System,The war between Sea and Space always ended in the same stalemate; the exposedwater simultaneously boiled and froze, repairing the armour of ice.The seas of Europa would have frozen completely solid long ago without theinfluence of nearby Jupiter. Its gravity continually kneaded the core of thelittle world; the forces that convulsed Io were also working there, though withmuch less ferocity. Everywhere in the deep was evidence of that tug-of-warbetween planet and satellite, in the continual roar and thunder of submarineearthquakes, the shriek of gases escaping from the interior, the infrasonicpressure waves of avalanches sweeping over the abyssal plains. By comparisonwith the tumultuous ocean that covered Europa, even the noisy seas of Earth weremuted.Here and there, scattered over the deserts of the deep, were oases that wouldhave amazed and delighted any terrestrial biologist. They extended for severalkilometres around tangled masses of pipes and chimneys deposited by mineralbrines gushing from the interior. Often they created natural parodies of Gothiccastles, from which black, scalding liquids pulsed in a slow rhythm, as ifdriven by the beating of some mighty heart. And like blood, they were theauthentic sign of life itself.The boiling fluids drove back the deadly cold leaking down from above, andformed islands of warmth on the sea-bed. Equally important, they brought fromEuropa’s interior all the chemicals of life. Such fertile oases, offering foodand energy in abundance, had been discovered by the twentieth-century explorersof Earth’s oceans. Here they were present on an immensely larger scale, and infar greater variety.Delicate, spidery structures that seemed to be the analogue of plants flourishedin the ‘tropical’ zones closest to the sources of heat. Crawling among thesewere bizarre slugs and worms, some feeding on the plants, others obtaining theirfood directly from the mineral-laden waters around them. At greater distancesfrom the submarine fires around which all these creatures warmed themselveslived sturdier, more robust organisms, not unlike crabs or spiders.Armies of biologists could have spent lifetimes studying one small oasis. Unlikethe Palaeozoic terrestrial seas, the Europan abyss was not a stable environment,so evolution had progressed with astonishing speed, producing multitudes offantastic forms. And all were under the same indefinite stay of execution;sooner or later, each fountain of life would weaken and die, as the forces thatpowered it moved their focus elsewhere. All across the Europan sea-bed wasevidence of such tragedies; countless circular areas were littered with theskeletons and mineral-encrusted remains of dead creatures, where entire chaptersof evolution had been deleted from the book of life. Some had left as their onlymemorial huge, empty shells like convoluted trumpets, larger than a man. Andthere were clams of many shapes - bivalves, and even trivalves, as well asspiral stone patterns, many metres across - exactly like the beautiful ammonitesthat disappeared so mysteriously from Earth’s oceans at the end of theCretaceous Period.Among the greatest wonders of the Europan abyss were rivers of incandescentlava, pouring from the calderas of submarine volcanoes. The pressure at thesedepths was so great that the water in contact with the red-hot magma could notflash into steam, so the two liquids co-existed in an uneasy truce.There, on another world and with alien actors, something like the story of Egypthad been played out long before the coming of Man. As the Nile had brought lifeto a narrow ribbon of desert, so this river of warmth had vivified the Europandeep. Along its banks, in a band never more than a few kilometres wide, speciesafter species had evolved and flourished and passed away. And some had leftpermanent monuments.Often, they were not easy to distinguish from the natural formations around thethermal vents, and even when they were clearly not due to pure chemistry, onewould be hard put to decide whether they were the product of instinct orintelligence. On Earth, the termites reared condominiums almost as impressive asany found in the single vast ocean that enveloped this frozen world.Along the narrow band of fertility in the deserts of the deep, whole culturesand even civilizations might have risen and fallen, armies might have marched -or swum - under the command of Europan Tamberlanes or Napoleons. And the rest oftheir world would never have known, for all their oases were as isolated fromone another as the planets themselves, The creatures who basked in the glow ofthe lava rivers, and fed around the hot vents, could not cross the hostilewilderness between their lonely islands. If they had ever produced historiansand philosophers, each culture would have been convinced that it was alone inthe Universe.Yet even the space between the oases was not altogether empty of life; therewere hardier creatures who had dared its rigours. Some were the Europananalogues of fish - streamlined torpedoes, propelled by vertical tails, steeredby fins along their bodies. The resemblance to the most successful dwellers inEarth’s oceans was inevitable; given the same engineering problems, evolutionmust produce very similar answers. Witness the dolphin and the shark -superficially almost identical, yet from far distant branches of the tree oflife.There was, however, one very obvious difference between the fish of the Europanseas and those in terrestrial oceans; they had no gills, for there was hardly atrace of oxygen to be extracted from the waters in which they swam. Like thecreatures around Earth’s own geothermal vents, their metabolism was based onsulphur compounds, present in abundance in this volcanic environment.And very few had eyes. Apart from the flickering glow of lava outpourings, andoccasional bursts of bioluminescence from creatures seeking mates, or huntersquesting prey, it was a lightless world.It was also a doomed one. Not only were its energy sources sporadic andconstantly shifting, but the tidal forces that drove them were steadilyweakening. Even if they developed true intelligence, the Europans were trappedbetween fire and ice.Barring a miracle, they would perish with the final freezing of their littleworld.Lucifer had wrought that miracle."},{"pageContent":"3001: THE FINAL ODISSEY26 TSIENVILLEIn the final moments, as he came in over the coast at a sedate hundredkilometres an hour, Poole wondered if there might be some last-minuteintervention. But nothing untoward happened, even when he moved slowly along theblack, forbidding face of the Great Wall.It was the inevitable name for the Europa Monolith as, unlike its littlebrothers on Earth and Moon, it was lying horizontally, and was more than twentykilometres long. Although it was literally billions of times greater in volumethan TMA ZERO and TMA ONE, its proportions were exactly the same - thatintriguing ratio 1:4:9, inspirer of so much numerological nonsense over thecenturies.As the vertical face was almost ten kilometres high, one plausible theorymaintained that among its other functions the Great Wall served as a wind-break,protecting Tsienville from the ferocious gales that occasionally roared in fromthe Sea of Galilee. They were much less frequent now that the climate hadstabilized, but a thousand years earlier they would have been a severediscouragement to any life-forms emerging from the ocean.Though he had fully intended to do so, Poole had never found time to visit theTycho Monolith - still Top Secret when he had left for Jupiter - and Earth’sgravity made its twin at Olduvai inaccessible to him. But he had seen theirimages so often that they were much more familiar than the proverbial back ofthe hand (and how many people, he had often wondered, would recognize the backsof their hands?). Apart from the enormous difference in scale, there wasabsolutely no way of distinguishing the Great Wall from TMA ONE and TMA ZERO -or, for that matter, the ‘Big Brother’ Monolith that Discovery and the Leonovhad encountered orbiting Jupiter.According to some theories, perhaps crazy enough to be true, there was only onearchetypal Monolith, and all the others - whatever their size - were merelyprojections or images of it. Poole recalled these ideas when he noticed thespotless, unsullied smoothness of the Great Wall’s towering ebon face. Surely,after so many centuries in such a hostile environment, it should have collecteda few patches of grime! Yet it looked as immaculate as if an army ofwindow-cleaners had just polished every square centimetre.Then he recalled that although everyone who had ever come to view TMA ONE andTMA ZERO felt an irresistible urge to touch their apparently pristine surfaces,no one had ever succeeded. Fingers - diamond drills - laser knives - allskittered across the Monoliths as if they were coated by an impenetrable film.Or as if - and this was another popular theory - they were not quite in thisuniverse, but somehow separated from it by an utterly impassable fraction of amillimetre.He made one complete, leisurely circuit of the Great Wall, which remainedtotally indifferent to his progress. Then he brought the shuttle - still onmanual, in case Ganymede Control made any further attempts to ‘rescue’ him - tothe outer limits of Tsienville, and hovered there looking for the best place toland.The scene through Falcon’s small panoramic window was wholly familiar to him; hehad examined it so often in Ganymede recordings, never imagining that one day hewould be observing it in reality. The Europs, it seemed, had no idea of townplanning; hundreds of hemispherical structures were scattered apparently atrandom over an area about a kilometre across. Some were so small that even humanchildren would feel cramped in them; though others were big enough to hold alarge family, none was more than five metres high.And they were all made from the same material, which gleamed a ghostly white inthe double daylight. On Earth, the Esquimaux had found the identical answer tothe challenge of their own frigid, materials-poor environment; Tsienville’sigloos were also made of ice.In lieu of streets, there were canals - as best suited creatures who were stillamphibious, and apparently returned to the water to sleep. Also, it wasbelieved, to feed and to mate, though neither hypothesis had been proved.Tsienville had been called ‘Venice, made of ice’, and Poole had to agree that itwas an apt description. However, there were no Venetians in sight; the placelooked as if it had been deserted for years.And here was another mystery; despite the fact that Lucifer was fifty timesbrighter than the distant Sun, and was a permanent fixture in the sky, theEurops still seemed locked to an ancient rhythm of night and day. They returnedto the ocean at sunset, and emerged with the rising of the Sun - despite thefact that the level of illumination had changed by only a few per cent. Perhapsthere was a parallel on Earth, where the life cycles of many creatures werecontrolled as much by the feeble Moon as the far more brilliant Sun.It would be sunrise in another hour, and then the inhabitants of Tsienvillewould return to land and go about their leisurely affairs - as by humanstandards, they certainly were. The sulphur-based biochemistry that powered theEurops was not as efficient as the oxygen-driven one that energized the vastmajority of terrestrial animals. Even a sloth could outrun a Europ, so it wasdifficult to regard them as potentially dangerous. That was the Good News; theBad News was that even with the best intentions on both sides, attempts atcommunication would be extremely slow - perhaps intolerably tedious.It was about time, Poole decided, that he reported back to Ganymede Control.They must be getting very anxious, and he wondered how his co-conspirator,Captain Chandler, was dealing with the situation.‘Falcon calling Ganymede. As you can doubtless see, I have - er - been broughtto rest just above Tsienville. There is no sign of hostility, and as it’s stillsolar night here all the Europs are underwater. Will call you again as soon asI’m on the ground.’Dim would have been proud of him, Poole thought, as he brought Falcon downgently as a snowflake on a smooth patch of ice. He was taking no chances withits stability, and set the inertial drive to cancel all but a fraction of theshuttle’s weight - just enough, he hoped, to prevent it being blown away by anywind.He was on Europa - the first human in a thousand years. Had Armstrong and Aldrinfelt this sense of elation, when Eagle touched down on the Moon? Probably theywere too busy checking their Lunar Module’s primitive and totally unintelligentsystems. Falcon, of course, was doing all this automatically. The little cabinwas now very quiet, apart from the inevitable - and reassuring - murmur ofwell-tempered electronics. It gave Poole a considerable shock when Chandler’svoice, obviously pre-recorded, interrupted his thoughts.‘So you made it! Congratulations! As you know, we’re scheduled to return to theBelt week after next, but that should give you plenty of time.’‘After five days, Falcon knows what to do. She’ll find her way home, with orwithout you. So good luck!’MISS PRINGLEACTIVATE CRYPTO PROGRAMSTOREHello, Dim - thanks for that cheerful message! I feel rather silly using thisprogram - as if I’m a secret agent in one of the spy melodramas that used to beso popular before I was born. Still, it will allow some privacy, which may beuseful. Hope Miss Pringle has downloaded it properly… of course, Miss P, I’monly joking!By the way, I’m getting a barrage of requests from all the news media in theSolar System. Please try to hold them off - or divert them to Dr Ted. He’llenjoy handling them…Since Ganymede has me on camera all the time, I won’t waste breath telling youwhat I’m seeing. If all goes well, we should have some action in a few minutes -and we’ll know if it really was a good idea to let the Europs find me alreadysitting here peacefully, waiting to greet them when they come to the surface…Whatever happens, it won’t be as big a surprise to me as it was to Dr Chang andhis colleagues, when they landed here a thousand years ago! I played his famouslast message again, just before leaving Ganymede. I must confess it gave me aneerie feeling - couldn’t help wondering if something like that could possiblyhappen again… wouldn’t like to immortalize myself the way poor Chang did…Of course, I can always lift off if something starts going wrong… and here’s aninteresting thought that’s just occurred to me… I wonder if the Europs have anyhistory - any kind of records… any memory of what happened just a few kilometresfrom here, a thousand years ago?"},{"pageContent":"3001: THE FINAL ODISSEY27 ICE AND VACUUM…This is Dr Chang, calling from Europa. I hope you cart hear me, especially DrFloyd - I know you’re aboard Leonov… I may not have much time… aiming my suitantenna where I think you are… please relay this information to Earth.Tsien was destroyed three hours ago. I’m the only survivor. Using my suit radio- no idea if it has enough range, but it’s the only chance. Please listencarefully…THERE IS LIFE ON EUROPA. I repeat: THERE IS LIFE ON EUROPA…We landed safely, checked all the systems, and ran out the hoses so we couldstart pumping water into our propellant tanks immediately… just in case we hadto leave in a hurry.Everything was going according to plan… it seemed almost too good to be true.The tanks were half full when Dr Lee and I went out to check the pipeinsulation. Tsien stands - stood - about thirty metres from the edge of theGrand Canal. Pipes went directly from it and down through the ice. Very thin -not safe to walk on.Jupiter was quarter full, and we had five kilowatts of lighting strung up on theship. She looked like a Christmas tree - beautiful, reflected on the ice…Lee saw it first - a huge dark mass rising up from the depths. At first wethought it was a school of fish - too large for a single organism - then itstarted to break through the ice, and began moving towards us.It looked rather like huge strands of wet seaweed, crawling along the ground.Lee ran back to the ship to get a camera - I stayed to watch, reporting over theradio. The thing moved so slowly I could easily outrun it. I was much moreexcited than alarmed. Thought I knew what kind of creature it was - I’ve seenpictures of the kelp forests off California - but I was quite wrong.I could tell it was in trouble. It couldn’t possibly survive at a temperature ahundred and fifty below its normal environment. It was freezing solid as itmoved forward -bits were breaking off like glass - but it was still advancingtowards the ship, a black tidal wave, slowing down all the time.I was still so surprised that I couldn’t think straight and I couldn’t imaginewhat it was trying to do. Even though it was heading towards Tsien it stillseemed completely harmless, like - well, a small forest on the move. I remembersmiling - it reminded me of Macbeth’s Birnam Wood…Then I suddenly realized the danger. Even if it was completely inoffensive - itwas heavy - with all the ice it was carrying, it must have weighed several tons,even in this low gravity.And it was slowly, painfully climbing up our landing gear… the legs werebeginning to buckle, all in slow motion, like something in a dream - or anightmare…Not until the ship started to topple did I realize what the thing was trying todo - and then it was far too late. We could have saved ourselves - if we’d onlyswitched off our lights!Perhaps it’s a phototrope, its biological cycle triggered by the sunlight thatfilters down through the ice. Or it could have been attracted like a moth to acandle. Our floodlights must have been more brilliant than anything that Europahas ever known, even the Sun itself…Then the ship crashed. I saw the hull split, a cloud of snowflakes form asmoisture condensed. All the lights went out, except for one, swinging back andforth on a cable a couple of metres above the ground.I don’t know what happened immediately after that. The next thing I remember, Iwas standing under the light, beside the wreck of the ship, with a finepowdering of fresh snow all around me. I could see my footsteps in it veryclearly. I must have run there; perhaps only a minute or two had elapsed…The plant - I still thought of it as a plant - was motionless. I wondered if ithad been damaged by the impact; large sections - as thick as a man’s arms - hadsplintered off, like broken twigs.Then the main trunk started to move again. It pulled away from the hull, andbegan to crawl towards me. That was when I knew for certain that the thing waslight-sensitive: I was standing immediately under the thousand-watt lamp, whichhad stopped swinging now.Imagine an oak tree - better still, a banyan with its multiple trunks and roots- flattened out by gravity and trying to creep along the ground. It got towithin five metres of the light, then started to spread out until it had made aperfect circle around me. Presumably that was the limit of its tolerance - thepoint at which photo-attraction turned to repulsion.After that, nothing happened for several minutes, I wondered if it was dead -frozen solid at last.Then I saw that large buds were forming on many of the branches. It was likewatching a time-lapse film of flowers opening. In fact I thought they wereflowers - each about as big as a man’s head.Delicate, beautifully coloured membranes started to unfold. Even then, itoccurred to me that no one - no thing - could ever have seen these coloursproperly, until we brought our lights - our fatal lights - to this world.Tendrils, stamens, waving feebly… I walked over to the living wall thatsurrounded me, so that I could see exactly what was happening. Neither then, orat any other time, had I felt the slightest fear of the creature. I was certainthat it was not malevolent - if indeed it was conscious at all.There were scores of the big flowers, in various stages of unfolding. Now theyreminded me of butterflies, just emerging from the chrysalis - wings crumpled,still feeble - I was getting closer and closer to the truth.But they were freezing - dying as quickly as they formed. Then, one afteranother, they dropped off from the parent buds. For a few moments they floppedaround like fish stranded on dry land - and at last I realized exactly what theywere. Those membranes weren’t petals - they were fins, or their equivalent. Thiswas the free-swimming larval stage of the creature. Probably it spends much ofits life rooted on the sea-bed, then sends these mobile offspring in search ofnew territory. Just like the corals of Earth’s oceans.I knelt down to get a closer look at one of the little creatures. The beautifulcolours were fading now, to a drab brown. Some of the petal-fins had snappedoff, becoming brittle shards as they froze. But it was still moving feebly, andas I approached it tried to avoid me. I wondered how it sensed my presence.Then I noticed that the stamens - as I’d called them -all carried bright bluedots at their tips. They looked like tiny star sapphires - or the blue eyesalong the mantle of a scallop - aware of light, but unable to form true images.As I watched, the vivid blue faded, the gems became dull, ordinary stones…Dr Floyd - or anyone else who is listening - I haven’t much more time; mylife-support system alarm has just sounded. But I’ve almost finished.I knew then what I had to do. The cable to that thousand-watt lamp was hangingalmost to the ground. I gave it a few tugs, and the light went out in a showerof sparks.I wondered whether it was too late. For a few minutes nothing happened. So Iwalked over to the wall of tangled branches around me - and kicked it.Slowly, the creature started to unweave itself, and to retreat back to theCanal. I followed it all the way back to the water, encouraging it with morekicks when it slowed down, feeling the fragments of ice crunching all the timebeneath my boots… As it neared the Canal, it seemed to gain strength and energy,as if it knew it was approaching its natural home. I wondered if it wouldsurvive, to bud again.It disappeared through the surface, leaving a few last dead larvae on the alienland. The exposed free water bubbled for a few minutes until a scab ofprotective ice sealed it from the vacuum above. Then I walked back to the shipto see if there was anything to salvage - I don’t want to talk about that.I’ve only two requests to make, Doctor. When the taxonomists classify thiscreature , I hope they’ll name it after me.And - when the next ship comes home - ask them to take our bones back to China.I’ll lose power in a few minutes - wish I knew whether anyone was receiving me.Anyway, I’ll repeat this message as long as I can…This is Professor Chang on Europa, reporting the destruction of the spaceshipTsien. We landed beside the Grand Canal and set up our pumps at the edge of theice -"},{"pageContent":"3001: THE FINAL ODISSEY28 THE LITTLE DAWNMISS PRINGLE RECORDHere comes the Sun! Strange - how quickly it seems to rise, on this slowlyturning world! Of course, of course - the disc’s so small that the whole of itpops above the horizon in no time… Not that it makes much difference to thelight - if you weren’t looking in that direction, you’d never notice that therewas another sun in the sky.But I hope the Europs have noticed. Usually it takes them less than five minutesto start coming ashore after the Little Dawn. Wonder if they already know I’mhere, and are scared…No - could be the other way round. Perhaps they’re inquisitive - even anxious tosee what strange visitor has come to Tsienville… I rather hope so…Here they come! Hope your spysats are watching - Falcon’s cameras recording…How slowly they move! I’m afraid it’s going to be very boring trying tocommunicate with them… even if they want to talk to me…Rather like the thing that overturned Tsien, but much smaller… They remind me oflittle trees, walking on half a dozen slender trunks. And with hundreds ofbranches, dividing into twigs, which divide again… and again. Just like many ofour general-purpose robots… what a long time it took us to realize thatimitation humanoids were ridiculously clumsy, and the proper way to go was withmyriad of small manipulators! Whenever we invent something clever, we find thatMother Nature’s already thought of it…Aren’t the little ones cute - like tiny bushes on the move. Wonder how theyreproduce - budding? I hadn’t realized how beautiful they are. Almost ascolourful as coral reef fish - maybe for the same reasons… to attract mates, orfool predators by pretending to be something else…Did I say they looked like bushes? Make that rose-bushes - they’ve actually gotthorns! Must have a good reason for them…I’m disappointed. They don’t seem to have noticed me. They’ll all heading intotown, as if a visiting spacecraft was an everyday occurrence… only a few left…maybe this will work…I suppose they can detect sound vibrations - most marine creatures can - thoughthis atmosphere may be too thin to carry my voice very far…FALCON - EXTERNAL SPEAKER…HELLO, CAN YOU HEAR ME? MY NAME IS FRANK POOLE… AHEM… I COME IN PEACE FOR ALLMANKIND…Makes me feel rather stupid, but can you suggest anything better? And it will begood for the record…Nobody’s taking the slightest notice. Big ones and little ones, they re allcreeping towards their igloos Wonder what they actually do when they get there -perhaps I should follow. I’m sure it would be perfectly safe - I can move somuch faster - I’ve just had an amusing flashback. All these creatures going inthe same direction - they look like the commuters who used to surge back andforth twice a day between home and office, before electronics made itunnecessary. Let’s try again, before they all disappear.HELLO THERE THIS IS FRANK POOLE, A VISITOR FROM PLANET EARTH. CAN YOU HEAR ME?I HEAR YOU, FRANK. THIS IS DAVE."},{"pageContent":"3001: THE FINAL ODISSEY29 THE GHOSTS IN THE MACHINEFrank Poole’s immediate reaction was one of utter astonishment, followed byoverwhelming joy. He had never really believed that he would make any kind ofcontact, either with the Europs or the Monolith. Indeed, he had even hadfantasies of kicking in frustration against that towering ebon wall and shoutingangrily, ‘Is there anybody home?’Yet he should not have been so amazed: some intelligence must have monitored hisapproach from Ganymede, and permitted him to land. He should have taken Ted Khanmore seriously.‘Dave,’ he said slowly, ‘is that really you?’Who else could it be? a part of his mind asked. Yet it was not a foolishquestion. There was something curiously mechanical - impersonal about the voicethat came from the small speaker on Falcon’s control board.YES, FRANK. I AM DAVE.There was a very brief pause: then the same voice continued, without any changeof intonation:HELLO FRANK. THIS IS HAL.MISS PRINGLERECORDWell - Indra, Dim - I’m glad I recorded all that, otherwise you’d never believeme…I guess I’m still in a state of shock. First of all, how should I feel aboutsomeone who tried to - who did - kill me - even if it was a thousand years ago!But I understand now that Hal wasn’t to blame; nobody was. There’s a very goodpiece of advice I’ve often found useful ‘Never attribute to malevolence what ismerely due to incompetence’ I can’t feel any anger towards a bunch ofprogrammers I never knew, who’ve been dead for centuries.I’m glad this is encrypted, as I don’t know how it should be handled, and a lotthat I tell you may turn out to be complete nonsense. I’m already suffering frominformation overload, and had to ask Dave to leave me for a while - after allthe trouble I’ve gone through to meet him! But I don’t think I hurt hisfeelings: I m not sure yet if he has any feelings…What is he - good question! Well, he really is Dave Bowman, but with most of thehumanity stripped away - like - ah - like the synopsis of a book or a technicalpaper. You know how an abstract can give all the basic information but no hintof the author’s personality? Yet there were moments when I felt that somethingof the old Dave was still there. I wouldn’t go so far as to say he’s pleased tomeet me again - moderately satisfied might be more like it… For myself, I’mstill very confused. Like meeting an old friend after a long separation, andfinding that they’re now a different person. Well, it has been a thousand years- and I can’t imagine what experiences he’s known, though as I’ll show youpresently, he’s tried to share some of them with me.And Hal - he’s here too, without question. Most of the time, there’s no way Ican tell which of them is speaking to me. Aren’t there examples of multiplepersonalities in the medical records? Maybe it’s something like that.I asked him how this had happened to them both, and he - they - dammit, Halman!- tried to explain. Let me repeat - I may have got it partly wrong, but it’s theonly working hypothesis I have.Of course, the Monolith - in its various manifestations - is the key - no,that’s the wrong word - didn’t someone once say it was a kind of cosmic SwissArmy knife? You still have them, I’ve noticed, though both Switzerland and itsarmy disappeared centuries ago. It’s a general-purpose device that can doanything it wants to. Or was programmed to do…Back in Africa, four million years ago, it gave us that evolutionary kick in thepants, for better or for worse. Then its sibling on the Moon waited for us toclimb out of the cradle. That we’ve already guessed, and Dave’s confirmed it.I said that he doesn’t have many human feelings, but he still has curiosity - hewants to learn. And what an opportunity he’s had!When the Jupiter Monolith absorbed him - can’t think of a better word - it gotmore than it bargained for. Though it used him - apparently as a capturedspecimen, and a probe to investigate Earth - he’s also been using it. With Hal’sassistance - and who should understand a super-computer better than another one?- he’s been exploring its memory, and trying to find its purpose.Now, this is something that’s very hard to believe. The Monolith is afantastically powerful machine - look what it did to Jupiter! - but it’s no morethan that. It’s running on automatic - it has no consciousness. I remember oncethinking that I might have to kick the Great Wall and shout ‘Is there anyonethere?’ And the correct answer would have to be - no one, except Dave and Hal…Worse still, some of its systems may have started to fail; Dave even suggeststhat, in a fundamental way, it’s become stupid! Perhaps it’s been left on itsown for too long - it’s time for a service check.And he believes the Monolith has made at least one misjudgement. Perhaps that’snot the right word - it may have been deliberate, carefully considered…In any event, it’s - well, truly awesome, and terrifying in its implications.Luckily, I can show it to you, so you can decide for yourselves. Yes, eventhough it happened a thousand years ago, when Leonov flew the second mission toJupiter! And all this time, no one has ever guessed…I’m certainly glad you got me fitted with the Braincap. Of course it’s beeninvaluable - I can’t imagine life without it - but now it’s doing a job it wasnever designed for. And doing it remarkably well.It took Halman about ten minutes to find how it worked, and to set up aninterface. Now we have mind-to-mind contact - which is quite a strain on me, Ican tell you. I have to keep asking them to slow down, and use baby-talk. Orshould I say baby-think…I’m not sure how well this will come through. It’s a thousand-year-old recordingof Dave’s own experience, somehow stored in the Monolith’s enormous memory, thenretrieved by Dave and injected into my Braincap - don’t ask me exactly how - andfinally transferred and beamed to you by Ganymede Central. Phew. Hope you don’tget a headache downloading it.Over to Dave Bowman at Jupiter, early twenty-first century…"},{"pageContent":"3001: THE FINAL ODISSEY30 FOAMSCAPEThe million-kilometre-long tendrils of magnetic force, the sudden explosion ofradio waves, the geysers of electrified plasma wider than the planet Earth -they were as real and clearly visible to him as the clouds banding the planet inmulti-hued glory. He could understand the complex pattern of their interactions,and realized that Jupiter was much more wonderful than anyone had ever guessed.Even as he fell through the roaring heart of the Great Red Spot, with thelightning of its continent-wide thunderstorms detonating under him, he knew whyit had persisted for centuries though it was made of gases far less substantialthan those that formed the hurricanes of Earth. The thin scream of hydrogen windfaded as he sank into the calmer depths, and a sheet of waxen snowflakes - somealready coalescing into barely palpable mountains of hydrocarbon foam -descended from the heights above. It was already warm enough for liquid water toexist, but there were no oceans there; this purely gaseous environment was tootenuous to support them.He descended through layer after layer of cloud, until he entered a region ofsuch clarity that even human vision could have scanned an area more than athousand kilometres across. It was only a minor eddy in the vaster gyre of theGreat Red Spot; and it held a secret that men had long guessed, but neverproved. Skirting the foothills of the drifting foam mountains were myriad ofsmall, sharply defined clouds, all about the same size and patterned withsimilar red and brown mottling. They were small only as compared with theinhuman scale of their surroundings; the very least would have covered afair-sized city.They were clearly alive, for they were moving with slow deliberation along theflanks of the aerial mountains, browsing off their slopes like colossal sheep.And they were calling to each other in the metre band, their radio voices faintbut clear against the cracklings and concussions of Jupiter itself.Nothing less than living gasbags, they floated in the narrow zone betweenfreezing heights and scorching depths. Narrow, yes - but a domain far largerthan all the biosphere of Earth.They were not alone. Moving swiftly among them were other creatures so smallthat they could easily have been overlooked. Some of them bore an almost uncannyresemblance to terrestrial aircraft, and were of about the same size. But theytoo were alive - perhaps predators, perhaps parasites, perhaps even herdsmen.A whole new chapter of evolution, as alien as that which he had glimpsed onEuropa, was opening before him. There were jet-propelled torpedoes like thesquids of the terrestrial oceans, hunting and devouring the huge gas-bags. Butthe balloons were not defenceless; some of them fought back with electricthunderbolts and with clawed tentacles like kilometre-long chainsaws.There were even stranger shapes, exploiting almost every possibility of geometry- bizarre, translucent kites, tetrahedra, spheres, polyhedra, tangles of twistedribbons… The gigantic plankton of the Jovian atmosphere, they were designed tofloat like gossamer in the uprising currents, until they had lived long enoughto reproduce; then they would be swept down into the depths to be carbonized andrecycled in a new generation.He was searching a world more than a hundred times the area of Earth, and thoughhe saw many wonders, nothing there hinted of intelligence. The radio voices ofthe great balloons carried only simple messages of warning or of fear. Even thehunters, who might have been expected to develop higher degrees of organization,were like the sharks in Earth’s oceans - mindless automata.And for all its breathtaking size and novelty, the biosphere of Jupiter was afragile world, a place of mists and foam, of delicate silken threads andpaper-thin tissues spun from the continual snowfall of petrochemicals formed bylightning in the upper atmosphere. Few of its constructs were more substantialthan soap bubbles; its most awesome predators could be torn to shreds by eventhe feeblest of terrestrial carnivores.Like Europa, but on a vastly grander scale, Jupiter was an evolutionarycul-de-sac. Intelligence would never emerge here; even if it did, it would bedoomed to a stunted existence. A purely aerial culture might develop, but in anenvironment where fire was impossible, and solids scarcely existed, it couldnever even reach the Stone Age."},{"pageContent":"3001: THE FINAL ODISSEY31 NURSERYMISS PRINGLE RECORDWell, Indra - Dim - I hope that came through in good shape - I still find ithard to believe. All those fantastic creatures - surely we should have detectedtheir radio voices, even if we couldn’t understand them! - wiped out in amoment, so that Jupiter could be made into a sun.And now we can understand why. It was to give the Europs their chance. Whatpitiless logic: is intelligence the only thing that matters? I can see some longarguments with Ted Khan over this - The next question is: will the Europs makethe grade - or will they remain forever stuck in the kindergarten - not eventhat - the nursery? Though a thousand years is a very short time, one would haveexpected some progress, but according to Dave they’re exactly the same now aswhen they left the sea. Perhaps that’s the trouble; they still have one foot -or one twig! - in the water.And here’s another thing we got completely wrong. We thought they went back intothe water to sleep. It’s just the other way round - they go back to eat, andsleep when they come on land! As we might have guessed from their structure -that network of branches - they’re plankton feeders…I asked Dave about the igloos they’ve built. Aren’t they a technologicaladvance? And he said: not really - they’re only adaptations of structures theymake on the sea-bed, to protect themselves from various predators - especiallysomething like a flying carpet, as big as a football field…There’s one area, though, where they have shown initiative - even creativity.They’re fascinated by metals, presumably because they don’t exist in pure formin the ocean. That’s why Tsien was stripped - the same thing’s happened to theoccasional probes that have come down in their territory. What do they do withthe copper and beryllium and titanium they collect? Nothing useful, I’m afraid.They pile it all together in one place, in a fantastic heap that they keepreassembling. They could be developing an aesthetic sense - I’ve seen worse inthe Museum of Modem Art… But I’ve got another theory - did you ever hear ofcargo cults? During the twentieth century, some of the few primitive tribes thatstill existed made imitation aeroplanes out of bamboo, in the hope of attractingthe big birds in the sky that occasionally brought them wonderful gifts. Perhapsthe Europs have the same idea.Now that question you keep asking me… What is Dave? And how did he - and Hal -become whatever it is they are now?The quick answer, of course, is that they’re both emulations - simulations - inthe Monolith’s gigantic memory. Most of the time they’re inactivated; when Iasked Dave about this, he said he’d been ‘awake’ - his actual word -for onlyfifty years altogether, in the thousand since his - er - metamorphosis.When I asked if he resented this takeover of his life, he said, ‘Why should Iresent it? I am performing my functions perfectly.’ Yes, that sounds exactlylike Hal! But I believe it was Dave - if there’s any distinction now.Remember that Swiss Army knife analogy? Halman is one of this cosmic knife’smyriad of components.But he’s not a completely passive tool - when he’s awake, he has some autonomy,some independence - presumably within limits set by the Monolith’s overridingcontrol. During the centuries, he’s been used as a kind of intelligent probe toexamine, Jupiter - as you’ve just seen - as well as Ganymede and the Earth. Thatconfirms those mysterious events in Florida, reported by Dave’s old girl-friend,and the nurse who was looking after his mother, just moments before her death…as well as the encounters in Anubis City.And it also explains another mystery. I asked Dave directly: why was I allowedto land on Europa, when everyone else has been turned away for centuries? Ifully expected to be!The answer’s ridiculously simple. The Monolith uses Dave - Halman - from time totime, to keep an eye on us.Dave knew all about my rescue - even saw some of the media interviews I made, onEarth and on Ganymede. I must say I’m still a little hurt he made no attempt tocontact me! But at least he put out the Welcome mat when I did arrive…Dim - I still have forty-eight hours before Falcon leaves - with or without me!I don’t think I’ll need them, now I’ve made contact with Halman; we can keep intouch just as easily from Anubis… if he wants to do so.And I’m anxious to get back to the Grannymede as quickly as possible. Falcon’s afine little spacecraft, but her plumbing could be improved - it’s beginning tosmell in here, and I’m itching for a shower.Look forward to seeing you - and especially Ted Khan.We have much to talk about, before I return to Earth.TRANSMITSTOREV TERMINATIONThe toil of all that beHeals not the primal fault;It rains into the sea,And still the sea is salt.- A. E. Housman, More Poems"},{"pageContent":"3001: THE FINAL ODISSEY32 A GENTLEMAN OF LEISUREOn the whole, it had been an interesting but uneventful decades, punctuated bythe joys and sorrows which Time and Fate bring to all mankind. The greatest ofthose had been wholly unexpected; in fact, before he left for Ganymede, Poolewould have dismissed the very idea as preposterous.There is much truth in the saying that absence makes the heart grow fonder. Whenhe and Indra Wallace met again, they discovered that, despite their banteringand occasional disagreements, they were closer than they had imagined. One thingled to another including, to their mutual joy, Dawn Wallace and Martin Poole.It was rather late in life to start a family - quite apart from that littlematter of a thousand years - and Professor Anderson had warned them that itmight be impossible. Or even worse…‘You were lucky in more ways than you realize,’ he told Poole. ‘Radiation damagewas surprisingly low, and we were able to make all essential repairs from yourintact DNA. But until we do some more tests, I can’t promise genetic integrity.So enjoy yourselves - but don’t start a family until I give the OK.’The tests had been time-consuming, and as Anderson had feared, further repairswere necessary. There was one major set-back - something that could never havelived, even if it had been allowed to go beyond the first few weeks afterconception - but Martin and Dawn were perfect, with just the right number ofheads, arms and legs. They were also handsome and intelligent, and barelymanaged to escape being spoiled by their doting parents - who continued to bethe best of friends when, after fifteen years, each opted for independenceagain. Because of their Social Achievement Rating, they would have beenpermitted - indeed, encouraged - to have another child, but they decided not toput any more of a burden on their astonishingly good luck.One tragedy had shadowed Poole’s personal life during this period - and indeedhad shocked the whole Solar community. Captain Chandler and his entire crew hadbeen lost when the nucleus of a comet they were reconnoitring exploded suddenly,destroying Goliath so completely that only a few fragments were ever located.Such explosions - caused by reactions among unstable molecules which existed atvery low temperatures - were a well-known danger to comet-collectors, andChandler had encountered several during his career. No one would ever know theexact circumstances which caused so experienced a spaceman to be taken bysurprise.Poole missed Chandler very badly: he had played a unique role in his life, andthere was no one to replace him - no one, except Dave Bowman, with whom he hadshared so momentous an adventure. He and Chandler had often made plans to gointo space together again, perhaps all the way out to the Oort Cloud with itsunknown mysteries and its remote but inexhaustible wealth of ice. Yet someconflict of schedules had always upset their plans, so this was a wished-forfuture that would never exist.Another long-desired goal Poole had managed to achieve - despite doctor’sorders. He had been down to Earth: and once was quite enough.The vehicle in which he had travelled looked almost identical to the wheelchairsused by the luckier paraplegics of his own time. It was motorized, and hadballoon tyres which allowed it to roll over reasonably smooth surfaces. However,it could also fly - at an altitude of about twenty centimetres - on anaircushion produced by a set of small but very powerful fans. Poole wassurprised that so primitive a technology was still in use, but inertia-controldevices were too bulky for such small-scale applications.Seated comfortably in his hoverchair, he was scarcely conscious of hisincreasing weight as he descended into the heart of Africa; though he did noticesome difficulty in breathing, he had experienced far worse during his astronauttraining. What he was not prepared for was the blast of furnace-heat that smotehim as he rolled out of the gigantic, sky-piercing cylinder that formed the baseof the Tower. Yet it was still morning: what would it be like at noon?He had barely accustomed himself to the heat when his sense of smell wasassailed. A myriad odours - none unpleasant, but all unfamiliar - clamoured forhis attention. He closed his eyes for a few minutes, in an attempt to avoidoverloading his input circuits.Before he had decided to open them again, he felt some large, moist objectpalpating the back of his neck.‘Say hello to Elizabeth,’ said his guide, a burly young man dressed intraditional Great White Hunter garb, much too smart to have seen any real use:’she’s our official greeter.’Poole twisted round in his chair, and found himself looking into the soulfuleyes of a baby elephant.‘Hello, Elizabeth,’ he answered, rather feebly. Elizabeth lifted her trunk insalute, and emitted a sound not usually heard in polite society, though Poolefelt sure it was well-intentioned.Altogether, he spent less than an hour on Planet Earth, skirting the edge of ajungle whose stunted trees compared unfavourably with Skyland’s, andencountering much of the local fauna. His guides apologized for the friendlinessof the lions, who had been spoilt by tourists - but the malevolent expressionsof the crocodiles more than compensated; here was Nature raw and unchanged.Before he returned to the Tower, Poole risked taking a few steps away from hishoverchair. He realized that this would be the equivalent of carrying his ownweight on his back, but that did not seem an impossible feat, and he would neverforgive himself unless he attempted it.It was not a good idea; perhaps he should have tried it in a cooler climate.After no more than a dozen steps, he was glad to sink back into the luxuriousclutches of the chair.‘That’s enough,’ he said wearily. ‘Let’s go back to the Tower.’As he rolled into the elevator lobby, he noticed a sign which he had somehowoverlooked during the excitement of his arrival. It read:WELCOME TO AFRICA!‘In wildness is the preservation of the world.’HENRY DAVID THOREAU(1817-1862)Observing Poole’s interest, the guide asked ‘Did you know him?’It was the sort of question Poole heard all too often, and at the moment he didnot feel equipped to deal with it.‘I don’t think so,’ he answered wearily, as the great doors closed behind them,shutting out the sights, scents and sounds of Mankind’s earliest home.His vertical safari had satisfied his need to visit Earth, and he did his bestto ignore the various aches and pains acquired there when he returned to hisapartment at Level 10,000 - a prestigious location, even in this democraticsociety. Indra, however, was mildly shocked by his appearance, and ordered himstraight to bed.‘Just like Antaeus - but in reverse!’ she muttered darkly. ‘Who?’ asked Poole:there were times when his wife’s erudition was a little overwhelming, but he haddetermined never to let it give him an inferiority complex.‘Son of the Earth Goddess, Gaea. Hercules wrestled with him - but every time hewas thrown to the ground, Antaeus renewed his strength.’‘Who won?’‘Hercules, of course - by holding Antaeus in the air, so Ma couldn’t rechargehis batteries.’‘Well, I’m sure it won’t take me long to recharge mine. And I’ve learned onelesson. If I don’t get more exercise, I may have to move up to Lunar Gravitylevel.’Poole’s good resolution lasted a full month: every morning he went for a briskfive-kilometre walk, choosing a different level of the Africa Tower each day.Some floors were still vast, echoing deserts of metal which would probably neverbe occupied, but others had been landscaped and developed over the centuries ina bewildering variety of architectural styles. Many were borrowings from pastages and cultures; others hinted at futures which Poole would not care to visit.At least there was no danger of boredom, and on many of his walks he wasaccompanied, at a respectful distance, by small groups of friendly children.They were seldom able to keep up with him for long.One day, as Poole was striding down a convincing - though sparsely populated -imitation of the Champs Elyse´es, he suddenly spotted a familiar face.‘Danil!’ he called.The other man took not the slightest notice, even when Poole called again, moreloudly.‘Don’t you remember me?’Danil - and now that he had caught up with him, Poole did not have the slightestdoubt of his identity - looked genuinely baffled.‘I’m sorry,’ he said. ‘You’re Commander Poole, of course. But I’m sure we’venever met before.’Now it was Poole’s turn to be embarrassed.‘Stupid of me,’ he apologized. ‘Must have mistaken you for someone else. Have agood day.’He was glad of the encounter, and was pleased to know that Danil was back innormal society. Whether his original crime had been axe-murders or overduelibrary books should no longer be the concern of his one-time employer; theaccount had been settled, the books closed. Although Poole sometimes missed thecops-and-robbers dramas he had often enjoyed in his youth, he had grown toaccept the current wisdom: excessive interest in pathological behaviour wasitself pathological.With the help of Miss Pringle, Mk III, Poole had been able to schedule his lifeso that there were even occasional blank moments when he could relax and set hisBraincap on Random Search, scanning his areas of interest. Outside his immediatefamily, his chief concerns were still among the moons of Jupiter/Lucifer, notleast because he was recognized as the leading expert on the subject, and apermanent member of the Europa Committee.This had been set up almost a thousand years ago, to consider what, if anything,could and should be done about the mysterious satellite. Over the centuries, ithad accumulated a vast amount of information, going all the way back to theVoyager flybys of 1979 and the first detailed surveys from the orbiting Galileospacecraft of 1996.Like most long-lived organizations, the Europa Committee had become slowlyfossilized, and now met only when there was some new development. It had wokenup with a start after Halman’s reappearance, and appointed an energetic newchairperson whose first act had been to co-opt Poole.Though there was little that he could contribute that was not already recorded,Poole was very happy to be on the Committee. It was obviously his duty to makehimself available, and it also gave him an official position he would otherwisehave lacked. Previously his status was what had once been called a ‘nationaltreasure’, which he found faintly embarrassing. Although he was glad to besupported in luxury by a world wealthier than all the dreams of war-ravagedearlier ages could have imagined, he felt the need to justify his existence.He also felt another need, which he seldom articulated even to himself. Halmanhad spoken to him, if only briefly, at their strange encounter two decades ago.Poole was certain that, if he wished, Halman could easily do so again. Were allhuman contacts no longer of interest to him? He hoped that was not the case; yetthat might be one explanation of his silence.He was frequently in touch with Theodore Khan - as active and acerbic as ever,and now the Europa Committee’s representative on Ganymede. Ever since Poole hadreturned to Earth, Ted had been trying in vain to open a channel ofcommunication with Bowman. He could not understand why long lists of importantquestions on subjects of vital philosophical and historic interest received noteven brief acknowledgements.‘Does the Monolith keep your friend Halman so busy that he can’t talk to me?’ hecomplained to Poole. ‘What does he do with his time, anyway?’It was a very reasonable question; and the answer came, like a thunderbolt outof a cloudless sky, from Bowman himself - as a perfectly commonplace vidphonecall."},{"pageContent":"3001: THE FINAL ODISSEY33 CONTACT‘Hello, Frank. This is Dave. I have a very important message for you. I assumethat you are now in your suite in Africa Tower. If you are there, pleaseidentify yourself by giving the name of our instructor in orbital mechanics. Iwill wait for sixty seconds, and if there is no reply will try again in exactlyone hour.’That minute was hardly long enough for Poole to recover from the shock. He felta brief surge of delight, as well as astonishment, before another emotion tookover. Glad though he was to hear from Bowman again, that phrase ‘a veryimportant message’ sounded distinctly ominous.At least it was fortunate, Poole told himself, that he’s asked for one of thefew names I can remember. Yet who could forget a Scot with a Glasgow accent sothick it had taken them a week to master it? But he had been a brilliantlecturer - once you understood what he was saying.‘Dr Gregory McVitty.’‘Accepted. Now please switch on your Braincap receiver. It will take threeminutes to download this message. Do not attempt to monitor: I am usingten-to-one compression. I will wait two minutes before starting.’How is he managing to do this? Poole wondered. Jupiter/Lucifer was now overfifty light-minutes away, so this message must have left almost an hour ago. Itmust have been sent with an intelligent agent in a properly addressed package onthe Ganymede-Earth beam - but that would have been a trivial feat to Halman,with the resources he had apparently been able to tap inside the Monolith.The indicator light on the Brainbox was flickering. The message was comingthrough.At the compression Halman was using, it would take half an hour for Poole toabsorb the message in real-time. But he needed only ten minutes to know that hispeaceful life-style had come to an abrupt end"},{"pageContent":"3001: THE FINAL ODISSEY34 JUDGEMENTIn a world of universal and instantaneous communication, it was very difficultto keep secrets. This was a matter, Poole decided immediately, for face-to-facediscussion.The Europa Committee had grumbled, but all its members had assembled in hisapartment. There were seven of them - the lucky number, doubtless suggested bythe phases of the Moon, that had always fascinated Mankind. It was the firsttime Poole had met three of the Committee’s members, though by now he knew themall more thoroughly than he could possibly have done in a pre-Braincappedlifetime.‘Chairperson Oconnor, members of the Committee - I’d like to say a few words -only a few, I promise! - before you download the message I’ve received fromEuropa. And this is something I prefer to do verbally; that’s more natural forme - I’m afraid I’ll never be quite at ease with direct mental transfer.’‘As you all know, Dave Bowman and Hal have been stored as emulations in theMonolith on Europa. Apparently it never discards a tool it once found useful,and from time to time it activates Halman, to monitor our affairs - when theybegin to concern it. As I suspect my arrival may have done - though perhaps Iflatter myself.’‘But Halman isn’t just a passive tool. The Dave component still retainssomething of its human origins - even emotions. And because we were trainedtogether - shared almost everything for years - he apparently finds it mucheasier to communicate with me than with anyone else. I would like to think heenjoys doing it, but perhaps that’s too strong a word.’‘He’s also curious - inquisitive - and perhaps a little resentful of the wayhe’s been collected, like a specimen of wildlife. Though that’s probably what weare, from the viewpoint of the intelligence that created the Monolith.’‘And where is that intelligence now? Halman apparently knows the answer, andit’s a chilling one.’‘As we always suspected, the Monolith is part of a galactic network of somekind. And the nearest node - the Monolith’s controller, or immediate superior -is 450 light-years away.’‘Much too close for comfort! This means that the report on us and our affairsthat was transmitted early in the twenty-first century was received half amillennium ago. If the Monolith’s - let’s say Supervisor - replied at once, anyfurther instructions should be arriving just about now.’‘And that’s exactly what seems to be happening. During the last few days, theMonolith has been receiving a continuous string of messages, and has beensetting up new programs, presumably in accordance with these.’‘Unfortunately, Halman can only make guesses about the nature of thoseinstructions. As you’ll gather when you’ve downloaded this tablet, he has somelimited access to many of the Monolith’s circuits and memory banks, and can evencarry on a kind of dialogue with it. If that’s the right word - since you needtwo people for that! I still can’t really grasp the idea that the Monolith, forall its powers, doesn’t possess consciousness - doesn’t even know that itexists!’‘Halman’s been brooding over the problem for a thousand years - on and off - andhas come to the same answer that most of us have done. But his conclusion mustsurely carry far more weight, because of his inside knowledge.’‘Sorry! I wasn’t intending to make a joke - but what else could you call it?’‘Whatever went to the trouble of creating us - or at least tinkering with ourancestors’ minds and genes - is deciding what to do next. And Halman ispessimistic. No - that’s an exaggeration. Let’s say he doesn’t think much of ourchances, but is now too detached an observer to be unduly worried. The future -the survival! - of the human race isn’t much more than an interesting problem tohim, but he’s willing to help.’Poole suddenly stopped talking, to the surprise of his intent audience.‘That’s strange. I’ve just had an amazing flashback… I’m sure it explains what’shappening. Please bear with me.’‘Dave and I were walking together one day, along the beach at the Cape, a fewweeks before launch, when we noticed a large beetle lying on the sand. As oftenhappens, it had fallen on its back and was waving its legs in the air,struggling to get right-way-up.’‘I ignored it - we were engaged in some complicated technical discussion - butnot Dave. He stepped aside, and carefully flipped it over with his shoe. As itflew away I commented, “Are you sure that was a good idea? Now it will go offand chomp somebody’s prize chrysanthemums.” And he answered, “Maybe you’reright. But I’d like to give it the benefit of the doubt.”‘My apologies - I’d promised to say only a few words! But I’m very glad Iremembered that incident: I really believe it puts Halman’s message in the rightperspective. He’s giving the human race the benefit of the doubt…’‘Now please check your Braincaps. This is a high-density recording - top of theu.v. band, Channel 110. Make yourselves comfortable, but be sure you’re freeline of sight. Here we go…’"},{"pageContent":"3001: THE FINAL ODISSEY35 COUNCIL OF WARNo one asked for a replay. Once was sufficient.There was a brief silence when the playback finished; then Chairperson DrOconnor removed her Braincap, massaged her shining scalp, and said slowly:‘You taught me a phrase from your period that seems very appropriate now. Thisis a can of worms.’‘But only Bowman - Halman - has opened it,’ said one of the Committee members.‘Does he really understand the operation of something as complex as theMonolith? Or is this whole scenario a figment of his imagination?’‘I don’t think he has much imagination,’ Dr Oconnor answered. ‘And everythingchecks perfectly. Especially the reference to Nova Scorpio. We assumed that wasan accident; apparently it was a - judgement.’‘First Jupiter - now Scorpio,’ said Dr Kraussman, the distinguished physicistwho was popularly regarded as a reincarnation of the legendary Einstein. Alittle plastic surgery, it was rumoured, had also helped. ‘Who will be next inline?’‘We always guessed,’ said the Chair, ‘that the TMAs were monitoring us.’ Shepaused for a moment, then added ruefully: ‘What bad - what incredibly bad! -luck that the fmal report went off, just after the very worst period in humanhistory!’There was another silence. Everyone knew that the twentieth century had oftenbeen branded ‘The Century of Torture’Poole listened without interrupting, while he waited for some consensus toemerge. Not for the first time, he was impressed by the quality of the CommitteeNo one was trying to prove a pet theory, score debating points, or inflate anego: he could not help drawing a contrast with the often bad-tempered argumentshe had heard in own time, between Space Agency engineers and administrators,Congressional staffs, and industrial executives.Yes, the human race had undoubtedly improved. The Braincap had not only helpedto weed out misfits, but had enormously increased the efficiency of education.Yet there had also been a loss; there were very few memorable characters in thissociety. Offhand he could think of only four - Indra, Captain Chandler, Dr Khanand the Dragon Lady of wistful memory.The Chairperson let the discussion flow smoothly back and forth until everyonehad had a say, then began her summing up.‘The obvious first question - how seriously should we take this threat - isn’tworth wasting time on. Even if it’s a false alarm, or a misunderstanding, it’spotentially so grave that we must assume it’s real, until we have absolute proofto the contrary. Agreed?’‘Good. And we don’t know how much time we have. So we must assume that thedanger is immediate. Perhaps Halman may be able to give us some further warning,but by then it may be too late.’‘So the only thing we have to decide is: how can we protect ourselves, againstsomething as powerful as the Monolith? Look what happened to Jupiter! And,apparently, Nova Scorpio…’‘I’m sure that brute force would be useless, though perhaps we should explorethat option. Dr Kraussman - how long would it take to build a super-bomb?’‘Assuming that the designs still exist, so that no research is necessary - oh,perhaps two weeks. Thermonuclear weapons are rather simple, and use commonmaterials - after all, they made them back in the Second Millennium! But if youwanted something sophisticated - say an antimatter bomb, or a mini-black-hole -well, that might take a few months.’‘Thank you: could you start looking into it? But as I’ve said, I don’t believeit would work; surely something that can handle such powers must also be able toprotect itself against them. So - any other suggestions?’‘Can we negotiate?’ one councillor asked, not very hopefully.‘With what… or whom?’ Kraussman answered. ‘As we’ve discovered, the Monolith isessentially a pure mechanism, doing just what it’s been programmed to do.Perhaps that program is flexible enough to allow of changes, but there’s no waywe can tell. And we certainly can’t appeal to Head Office - that’s half athousand light-years away!’Poole listened without interrupting; there was nothing he could contribute tothe discussion, and indeed much of it was completely over his head. He began tofeel an insidious sense of depression, would it have been better, he wondered,not to pass on this information? Then, if it was a false alarm, no one would beany the worse. And if it was not - well, humanity would still have peace ofmind, before whatever inescapable doom awaited it.He was still mulling over these gloomy thoughts when he was suddenly alerted bya familiar phrase.A quiet little member of the Committee, with a name so long and difficult thatPoole had never been able to remember, still less pronounce it, had abruptlydropped just two words into the discussion.‘Trojan Horse!’There was one of those silences generally described as ‘pregnant’, then a chorusof ‘Why didn’t I think of that!’ ‘Of course!’ ‘Very good idea!’ until theChairperson, for the first time in the session, had to call for order.‘Thank you, Professor Thirugnanasampanthamoorthy,’ said Dr Oconnor, withoutmissing a beat. ‘Would you like to be more specific?’‘Certainly. If the Monolith is indeed, as everyone seems to think, essentially amachine without consciousness - and hence with only limited self-monitoringability - we may already have the weapons that can defeat it. Locked up in theVault.’‘And a delivery system - Halman!’‘Precisely.’‘Just a minute, Dr T. We know nothing - absolutely nothing - about theMonolith’s architecture. How can we be sure that anything our primitive speciesever designed would be effective against it?’‘We can’t - but remember this. However sophisticated it is, the Monolith has toobey exactly the same universal laws of logic that Aristotle and Booleformulated, centuries ago. That’s why it may - no, should! - be vulnerable tothe things locked up in the Vault. We have to assemble them in such a way thatat least one of them will work. It’s our only hope - unless anybody can suggesta better alternative.’‘Excuse me,’ said Poole, finally losing patience. ‘Will someone kindly tell me -what and where is this famous Vault you’re talking about?’"},{"pageContent":"3001: THE FINAL ODISSEY36 CHAMBER OF HORRORSHistory is full of nightmares, some natural, some manmade.By the end of the twenty-first century, most of the natural ones - smallpox, theBlack Death, AIDS, the hideous viruses lurking in the African jungle - had beeneliminated, or at least brought under control, by the advance of medicine.However, it was never wise to underestimate the ingenuity of Mother Nature, andno one doubted that the future would still have unpleasant biological surprisesin store for Mankind.It seemed a sensible precaution, therefore, to keep a few specimens of all thesehorrors for scientific study - carefully guarded, of course, so that there wasno possibility of them escaping and again wreaking havoc on the human race. Buthow could one be absolutely sure that there was no danger of this happening?There had been - understandably - quite an outcry in the late twentieth centurywhen it was proposed to keep the last known smallpox viruses at Disease ControlCentres in the United States and Russia. However unlikely it might be, there wasa finite possibility that they might be released by such accidents asearthquakes, equipment failures - or even deliberate sabotage by terroristgroups.A solution that satisfied everyone (except a few ‘Preserve the lunarwilderness!’ extremists) was to ship them to the Moon, and to keep them in alaboratory at the end of a kilometre-long shaft drilled into the isolatedmountain Pico, one of the most prominent features of the Mare Imbrium. And here,over the years, they were joined by some of the most outstanding examples ofmisplaced human ingenuity - indeed, insanity.There were gases and mists that, even in microscopic doses, caused slow orinstant death. Some had been created by religious cultists who, though mentallyderanged, had managed to acquire considerable scientific knowledge. Many of thembelieved that the end of the world was at hand (when, of course, only theirfollowers would be saved). In case God was absent-minded enough not to performas scheduled, they wanted to make sure that they could rectify His unfortunateoversight.The first assaults of these lethal cultists were made on such vulnerable targetsas crowded subways, World Fairs, sports stadiums, pop concerts… tens ofthousands were killed, and many more injured before the madness was broughtunder control in the early twenty-first century. As often happens, some goodcame out of evil, because it forced the world’s law-enforcement agencies toco-operate as never before; even rogue states which had promoted politicalterrorism were unable to tolerate this random and wholly unpredictable variety.The chemical and biological agents used in these attacks - as well as in earlierforms of warfare - joined the deadly collection in Pico. Their antidotes, whenthey existed, were also stored with them. It was hoped that none of thismaterial would ever concern humanity again - but it was still available, underheavy guard, if it was needed in some desperate emergency.The third category of items stored in the Pico vault, although they could beclassified as plagues, had never killed or injured anyone - directly. They hadnot even existed before the late twentieth century, but in a few decades theyhad done billions of dollars’ worth of damage, and often wrecked lives aseffectively as any bodily illness could have done. They were the diseases whichattacked Mankind’s newest and most versatile servant, the computer.Taking names from the medical dictionaries - viruses, prions, tapeworms - theywere programs that often mimicked, with uncanny accuracy, the behaviour of theirorganic relatives. Some were harmless - little more than playful jokes,contrived to surprise or amuse Computer operators by unexpected messages andimages on their visual displays. Others were far more malicious - deliberatelydesigned agents of catastrophe.In most cases their purpose was entirely mercenary; they were the weapons thatsophisticated criminals used to blackmail the banks and commercial organizationsthat now depended utterly upon the efficient operation of their computersystems. On being warned that their data banks would be erased automatically ata certain time, unless they transferred a few megadollars to some anonymousoffshore number, most victims decided not to risk possibly irreparable disaster.They paid up quietly, often - to avoid public or even private embarrassment -without notifying the police.This understandable desire for privacy made it easy for the network highwaymento conduct their electronic holdups: even when they were caught, they weretreated gently by legal systems which did not know how to handle such novelcrimes - and, after all, they had not really hurt anyone, had they? Indeed,after they had served their brief sentences, many of the perpetrators werequietly hired by their victims, on the old principle that poachers make the bestgame-keepers.These computer criminals were driven purely by greed, and certainly did not wishto destroy the organizations they preyed upon: no sensible parasite kills itshost. But there were other, and much more dangerous, enemies of society at work…Usually, they were maladjusted individuals - typically adolescent males -working entirely alone, and of course in complete secrecy. Their aim was tocreate programs which would simply create havoc and confusion, when they hadbeen spread over the planet by the world-wide cable and radio networks, or onphysical carriers such as diskettes and CD ROMS. Then they would enjoy theresulting chaos, basking in the sense of power it gave their pitiful psyches.Sometimes, these perverted geniuses were discovered and adopted by nationalintelligence agencies for their own secretive purposes - usually, to break intothe data banks of their rivals. This was a fairly harmless line of employment,as the organizations concerned did at least have some sense of civicresponsibility.Not so the apocalyptic sects, who were delighted to discover this new armoury,holding weapons far more effective, and more easily disseminated, than gas orgerms. And much more difficult to counter, since they could be broadcastinstantaneously to millions of offices and homes.The collapse of the New York-Havana Bank in 2005, the launching of Indiannuclear missiles in 2007 (luckily with their warheads unactivated), the shutdownof Pan-European Air Traffic Control in 2008, the paralysis of the North Americantelephone network in that same year - all these were cult-inspired rehearsalsfor Doomsday. Thanks to brilliant feats of counterintelligence by normallyuncooperative, and even warring, national agencies, this menace was slowlybrought under control.At least, so it was generally believed: there had been no serious attacks at thevery foundations of society for several hundred years. One of the chief weaponsof victory had been the Braincap - though there were some who believed that thisachievement had been bought at too great a cost.Though arguments over the freedom of the Individual versus the duties of theState were old when Plato and Aristotle attempted to codify them, and wouldprobably continue until the end of time, some consensus had been reached in theThird Millennium. It was generally agreed that Communism was the most perfectform of government; unfortunately it had been demonstrated - at the cost of somehundreds of millions of lives - that it was only applicable to social insects,Robots Class II, and similar restricted categories. For imperfect human beings,the least-worst answer was Demosocracy, frequently defined as ‘individual greed,moderated by an efficient but not too zealous government’.Soon after the Braincap came into general use, some highly intelligent - andmaximally zealous - bureaucrats realized that it had a unique potential as anearly-warning system. During the setting-up process, when the new wearer wasbeing mentally ‘calibrated’ it was possible to detect many forms of psychosisbefore they had a chance of becoming dangerous. Often this suggested the besttherapy, but when no cure appeared possible the subject could be electronicallytagged - or, in extreme cases, segregated from society. Of course, this mentalmonitoring could test only those who were fitted with a Braincap - but by theend of the Third Millennium this was as essential for everyday life as thepersonal telephone had been at its beginning. In fact, anyone who did not jointhe vast majority was automatically suspect, and checked as a potential deviant.Needless to say, when ‘mind-probing’, as its critics called it, started cominginto general use, there were cries of outrage from civil-rights organizations;one of their most effective slogans was ‘Braincap or Braincop?’ Slowly - evenreluctantly - it was accepted that this form of monitoring was a necessaryprecaution against far worse evils; and it was no coincidence that with thegeneral improvement in mental health, religious fanaticism also started itsrapid decline-When the long-drawn-out war against the cybernet criminals ended, the victorsfound themselves owning an embarrassing collection of spoils, all of themutterly incomprehensible to any past conqueror. There were, of course, hundredsof computer viruses, most of them very difficult to detect and kill. And therewere some entities - for want of a better name - that were much more terrifying.They were brilliantly invented diseases for which there was no cure - in somecases not even the possibility of a cureMany of them had been linked to great mathematicians who would have beenhorrified by this corruption of their discoveries. As it is a humancharacteristic to belittle a real danger by giving it an absurd name, thedesignations were often facetious: the Godel Gremlin, the Mandelbrot Maze, theCombinatorial Catastrophe, the Transfinite Trap, the Conway Conundrum, theTuring Torpedo, the Lorentz Labyrinth, the Boolean Bomb, the Shannon Snare, theCantor Cataclysm…If any generalization was possible, all these mathematical horrors operated onthe same principle. They did not depend for their effectiveness on anything asnaïve as memory-erasure or code corruption - on the contrary. Their approach wasmore subtle; they persuaded their host machine to initiate a program which couldnot be completed before the end of the universe, or which - the Mandelbrot Mazewas the deadliest example - involved a literally infinite series of steps.A trivial example would be the calculation of Pi, or any other irrationalnumber. However, even the most stupid electro-optic computer would not fall intosuch a simple trap: the day had long since passed when mechanical morons wouldwear out their gears, grinding them to powder as they tried to divide by zero…The challenge to the demon programmers was to convince their targets that thetask set them had a definite conclusion that could be reached in a finite time.In the battle of wits between man (seldom woman, despite such role-models asLady Ada Lovelace, Admiral Grace Hopper and Dr Susan Calvin) and machine, themachine almost invariably lost.It would have been possible - though in some cases difficult and even risky - todestroy the captured obscenities by ERASE/OVERWRITE commands, but theyrepresented an enormous investment in time and ingenuity which, howevermisguided, seemed a pity to waste. And, more important, perhaps they should bekept for study, in some secure location, as a safeguard against the time whensome evil genius might reinvent and deploy them.The solution was obvious. The digital demons should be sealed with theirchemical and biological counterparts, it was hoped for ever, in the Pico Vault."},{"pageContent":"3001: THE FINAL ODISSEY37 OPERATION DAMOCLESPoole never had much contact with the team who assembled the weapon everyonehoped would never have to be used. The operation - ominously, but aptly, namedDamocles - was so highly specialized that he could contribute nothing directly,and he saw enough of the task force to realize that some of them might almostbelong to an alien species. Indeed, one key member was apparently in a lunaticasylum - Poole had been surprised to find that such places still existed - andChairperson Oconnor sometimes suggested that at least two others should joinhim.‘Have you ever heard of the Enigma Project?’ she remarked to Poole, after aparticularly frustrating session. When he shook his head, she continued: ‘I’msurprised - it was only a few decades before you were born: I came across itwhile when I was researching material for Damocles. Very similar problem - inone of your wars, a group of brilliant mathematicians was gathered together, ingreat secrecy, to break an enemy code… incidentally, they built one of the veryfirst real computers, to make the job possible.’‘And there’s a lovely story - I hope it’s true - that reminds me of our ownlittle team. One day the Prime Minister came on a visit of inspection, andafterwards he said to Enigma’s Director: “When I told you to leave no stoneunturned to get the men you needed, I didn’t expect you to take me soliterally”.’Presumably all the right stones had been turned for Project Damocles. However,as no one knew whether they were working against a deadline of days, weeks oryears, at first it was hard to generate any sense of urgency. The need forsecrecy also created problems; since there was no point in spreading alarmthroughout the Solar System, not more than fifty people knew of the project. Butthey were the people who mattered - who could marshal all the forces necessary,and who alone could authorize the opening of the Pico Vault, for the first timein five hundred years.When Halman reported that the Monolith was receiving messages with increasingfrequency, there seemed little doubt that something was going to happen. Poolewas not the only one who found it hard to sleep in those days, even with thehelp of the Braincap’s anti-insomnia programs. Before he finally did get tosleep, he often wondered if he would wake up again. But at last all thecomponents of the weapon were assembled - a weapon invisible, untouchable andunimaginable to almost all the warriors who had ever lived.Nothing could have looked more harmless and innocent than the perfectly standardterabyte memory tablet, used with millions of Braincaps every day. But the factthat it was encased in a massive block of crystalline material, criss-crossedwith metal bands, indicated that it was something quite out of the ordinary.Poole received it with reluctance; he wondered if the courier who had been giventhe awesome task of carrying the Hiroshima atom bomb’s core to the Pacificairbase from which it was launched had felt the same way. And yet, if all theirfears were justified, his responsibility might be even greater.And he could not be certain that even the first part of his mission would besuccessful. Because no circuit could be absolutely secure, Halman had not yetbeen informed about Project Damocles; Poole would do that when he returned toGanymede.Then he could only hope that Halman would be willing to play the role of TrojanHorse - and, perhaps, be destroyed in the process."},{"pageContent":"3001: THE FINAL ODISSEY38 PRE-EMPTIVE STRIKEIt was strange to be back in the Hotel Grannymede after all these years -strangest of all, because it seemed completely unchanged, despite everythingthat had happened. Poole was still greeted by the familiar image of Bowman as hewalked into the suite named after him: and, as he expected, Bowman/Halman waswaiting, looking slightly less substantial than the ancient hologram.Before they could even exchange greetings, there was an interruption that Poolewould have welcomed - at any other time than this. The room vidphone gave itsurgent trio of rising notes - also unchanged since his last visit -and an oldfriend appeared on the screen.‘Frank!’ cried Theodore Khan, ‘why didn’t you tell me you were coming! When canwe meet? Why no video - someone with you? And who were all thoseofficial-looking types who landed at the same time -’‘Please Ted! Yes, I’m sorry - but believe me, I’ve got very good reasons - I’llexplain later. And I do have someone with me - call you back just as soon as Ican. Good-bye!’As he belatedly gave the ‘Do Not Disturb’ order, Poole said apologetically:‘Sorry about that - you know who it was, of course.’‘Yes - Dr Khan. He often tried to get in touch with me.’‘But you never answered. May I ask why?’ Though there were far more importantmatters to worry about, Poole could not resist putting the question.‘Ours was the only channel I wished to keep open. Also, I was often away.Sometimes for years.’That was surprising - yet it should not have been. Poole knew well enough thatHalman had been reported in many places, in many times. Yet - ‘away for years’?He might have visited quite a few star systems - perhaps that was how he knewabout Nova Scorpio, only forty light-years distant. But he could never have goneall the way to the Node; there and back would have been a nine-hundred-yearjourney.‘How lucky that you were here when we needed you!’ It was very unusual forHalman to hesitate before replying. There was much longer than the unavoidablethree-second time-lag before he said slowly ‘Are you sure that it was luck?’‘What do you mean?’‘I do not wish to talk about it, but twice I have - glimpsed - powers - entities- far superior to the Monoliths, and perhaps even their makers. We may both haveless freedom than we imagine.’That was indeed a chilling thought; Poole needed a deliberate effort of will toput it aside and concentrate on the immediate problem.‘Let us hope we have enough free-will to do what is necessary. Perhaps this is afoolish question. Does the Monolith know that we are meeting? Could it be -suspicious?’‘It is not capable of such an emotion. It has numerous fault-protection devices,some of which I understand. But that is all.’‘Could it be overhearing us now?’‘I do not believe so.’I wish that I could be sure it was such a naïve and simple-minded super-genius,thought Poole as he unlocked his briefcase and took out the sealed boxcontaining the tablet. In this low gravity its weight was almost negligible; itwas impossible to believe that it might hold the destiny of Mankind.‘There was no way we could be certain of getting a secure circuit to you, so wecouldn’t go into details. This tablet contains programs which we hope willprevent the Monolith from carrying out any orders which threaten Mankind. Thereare twenty of the most devastating viruses ever designed on this, most of whichhave no known antidote; in some cases, it is believed that none is possible.There are five copies of each. We would like you to release them when - and if -you think it is necessary. Dave - Hal - no one has ever been given such aresponsibility. But we have no other choice.’Once again, the reply seemed to take longer than the three-second round tripfrom Europa.‘If we do this, all the Monolith’s functions may cease. We are uncertain whatwill happen to us then.’‘We have considered that, of course. But by this lime, you must surely have manyfacilities at your command -some of them probably beyond our understanding. I amalso sending you a petabyte memory tablet. Ten to the fifteenth bytes is morethan sufficient to hold all the memories and experiences of many lifetimes. Thiswill give you one escape route: I suspect you have others.’‘Correct. We will decide which to use at the appropriate time.’Poole relaxed - as far as was possible in this extraordinary situation. Halmanwas willing to co-operate: he still had sufficient links with his origins.‘Now, we have to get this tablet to you - physically. Its contents are toodangerous to risk sending over any radio or optical channel. I know you possesslong-range control of matter: did you not once detonate an orbiting bomb? Couldyou transport it to Europa? Alternatively, we could send it in an auto-courier,to any point you specify.’‘That would be best: I will collect it in Tsienville. Here are the co-ordinates…Poole was still slumped in his chair when the Bowman Suite monitor admitted thehead of the delegation that had accompanied him from Earth. Whether ColonelJones was a genuine Colonel - or even if his name was Jones - were minormysteries which Poole was not really interested in solving; it was sufficientthat he was a superb organizer and had handled the mechanics of OperationDamocles with quiet efficiency.‘Well, Frank - it’s on its way. Will be landing in one hour, ten minutes. Iassume that Halman can take it from there, but I don’t understand how he canactually handle - is that the right word? - these tablets.’‘I wondered about that, until someone on the Europa Committee explained it.There’s a well-known - though not to me! - theorem stating that any computer canemulate any other computer. So I’m sure that Halman knows exactly what he’sdoing. He would never have agreed otherwise.’‘I hope you’re right,’ replied the Colonel. ‘If not - well, I don’t know whatalternative we have.’There was a gloomy pause, until Poole did his best to relieve the tension.‘By the way, have you heard the local rumour about our visit?’‘Which particular one?’‘That we’re a special commission sent here to investigate crime and corruptionin this raw frontier township. The Mayor and the Sheriff are supposed to berunning scared.’‘How I envy them,’ said ‘Colonel Jones’. ‘Sometimes it’s quite a relief to havesomething trivial to worry about.’"},{"pageContent":"3001: THE FINAL ODISSEY39 DEICIDELike all the inhabitants of Anubis City (population now 56,521), Dr TheodoreKhan woke soon after local midnight to the sound of the General Alarm. His firstreaction was ‘Not another Icequake, for Deus’s sake!’He rushed to the window, shouting ‘Open’ so loudly that the room did notunderstand, and he had to repeat the order in a normal voice. The light ofLucifer should have come streaming in, painting the patterns on the floor thatso fascinated visitors from Earth, because they never moved even a fraction of amillimetre, no matter how long they waited…That unvarying beam of light was no longer there. As Khan stared in utterdisbelief through the huge, transparent bubble of the Anubis Dome, he saw a skythat Ganymede had not known for a thousand years. It was once more ablaze withstars; Lucifer had gone.And then, as he explored the forgotten constellations, Kahn noticed somethingeven more terrifying. Where Lucifer should have been was a tiny disc of absoluteblackness, eclipsing the unfamiliar stars.There was only one possible explanation, Khan told himself numbly. Lucifer hasbeen swallowed by a Black Hole. And it may be our turn next.On the balcony of the Grannymede Hotel, Poole was watching the same spectacle,but with more complex emotions. Even before the general alarm, his comsec hadwoken him with a message from Halman.‘It is beginning. We have infected the Monolith. But one - perhaps several - ofthe viruses have entered our own circuits. We do not know if we will be able touse the memory tablet you have given us. If we succeed, we will meet you inTsienville.’Then came the surprising and strangely moving words whose exact emotionalcontent would be debated for generations:‘If we are unable to download, remember us.’ From the room behind him, Pooleheard the voice of the Mayor, doing his best to reassure the now sleeplesscitizens of Anubis. Though he opened with that most terrifying of officialstatements - ‘No cause for alarm’ - the Mayor did indeed have words of comfort.‘We don’t know what’s happening but Lucifer’s still shining normally! I repeat -Lucifer is still shining! We’ve just received news from the interorbit shuttleAlcyone, which left for Callisto half an hour ago. Here’s their view -, Pooleleft the balcony and rushed into his room just in time to see Lucifer blazereassuringly on the vidscreen.‘What’s happened,’ the Mayor continued breathlessly, ‘is that something hascaused a temporary eclipse - we’ll zoom in to look at it… Callisto Observatory,come in please…’How does he know it’s ‘temporary’? thought Poole, as he waited for the nextimage to come up on the screen.Lucifer vanished, to be replaced by a field of stars. At the same time, theMayor faded out and another voice took over:‘- two-metre telescope, but almost any instrument will do. It’s a disc ofperfectly black material, just over ten thousand kilometres across, so thin itshows no visible thickness. And it’s placed exactly - obviously deliberately -toblock Ganymede from receiving any light.‘We’ll zoom in to see if it shows any details, though I rather doubt it…’From the viewpoint of Callisto, the occulting disc was foreshortened into anoval, twice as long as it was wide. It expanded until it completely filled thescreen; thereafter, it was impossible to tell whether the image was beingzoomed, as it showed no structure whatsoever.‘As I thought - there’s nothing to see. Let’s pan over to the edge of thething…’Again there was no sense of motion, until a field of stars suddenly appeared,sharply defined by the curving edge of the world-sized disc. It was exactly asif they were looking past the horizon of an airless, perfectly smooth planet.No, it was not perfectly smooth…‘That’s interesting,’ commented the astronomer, who until now had soundedremarkably matter-of-fact, as if this sort of thing was an everyday occurrence.‘The edge looks jagged - but in a very regular fashion - like a saw-blade…’A circular saw Poole muttered under his breath. Is it going to carve us up?Don’t be ridiculous…‘This is as close as we can get before diffraction spoils the image - we’llprocess it later and get much better detail:’The magnification was now so great that all trace of the disc’s circularity hadvanished. Across the vidscreen was a black band, serrated along its edge withtriangles so identical that Poole found it hard to avoid the ominous analogy ofa saw-blade. Yet something else was nagging at the back of his mind…Like everyone else on Ganymede, he watched the infinitely more distant starsdrifting in and out of those geometrically perfect valleys. Very probably, manyothers jumped to the same conclusion even before he did.If you attempt to make a disc out of rectangular blocks -whether theirproportions are 1:4:9 or any other - it cannot possibly have a smooth edge. Ofcourse, you can make it as near a perfect circle as you like, by using smallerand smaller blocks. Yet why go to that trouble, if you merely wanted to build ascreen large enough to eclipse a sun?The Mayor was right; the eclipse was indeed temporary. But its ending was theprecise opposite of a solar one.First light broke through at the exact centre, not in the usual necklace ofBailey’s Beads along the very edge. Jagged lines radiated from a dazzlingpinhole - and now, under the highest magnification, the structure of the discwas being revealed. It was composed of millions of identical rectangles, perhapsthe same size as the Great Wall of Europa. And now they were splitting apart: itwas as if a gigantic jigsaw puzzle was being dismantled.Its perpetual, but now briefly interrupted, daylight was slowly returning toGanymede, as the disc fragmented and the rays of Lucifer poured through thewidening gaps. Now the components themselves were evaporating, almost as if theyneeded the reinforcement of each other’s contact to maintain reality.Although it seemed like hours to the anxious watchers in Anubis City, the wholeevent lasted for less than fifteen minutes. Not until it was all over did anyonepay attention to Europa itself.The Great Wall was gone: and it was almost an hour before the news came fromEarth, Mars and Moon that the Sun itself had appeared to flicker for a fewseconds, before resuming business as usual.It had been a highly selective set of eclipses, obviously targeted at humankind.Nowhere else in the Solar System would anything have been noticed.In the general excitement, it was a little longer before the world realized thatTMA ZERO and TMA ONE had both vanished, leaving only their four-million-year-oldimprints on Tycho and Africa.It was the first time the Europs could ever have met humans, but they seemedneither alarmed nor surprised by the huge creatures moving among them at suchlightning speed. Of course, it was not too easy to interpret the emotional stateof something that looked like a small, leafless bush, with no obvious senseorgans or means of communication. But if they were frightened by the arrival ofAlcyone, and the emergence of its passengers, they would surely have remainedhiding in their igloos.As Frank Poole, slightly encumbered by his protective suit and the gift ofshining copper wire he was carrying, walked into the untidy suburbs ofTsienville, he wondered what the Europs thought of recent events. For them,there had been no eclipse of Lucifer, but the disappearance of the Great Wallmust surely have been a shock. It had stood there for a thousand years, as ashield and doubtless much more; then, abruptly, it was gone, as if it had neverbeen…The petabyte tablet was waiting for him, with a group of Europs standing aroundit, demonstrating the first sign of curiosity that Poole had ever observed inthem. He wondered if Halman had somehow told them to watch over this gift fromspace, until he came to collect it.And to take it back, since it now contained not only a sleeping friend butterrors which some future age might exorcise, to the only place where it couldbe safely stored."},{"pageContent":"3001: THE FINAL ODISSEY40 MIDNIGHT: PICOIt would be hard, Poole thought, to imagine a more peaceful scene - especiallyafter the trauma of the last weeks. The slanting rays of a nearly full Earthrevealed all the subtle details of the waterless Sea of Rains - not obliteratingthem, as the incandescent fury of the Sun would do.The small convoy of mooncars was arranged in a semicircle a hundred metres fromthe inconspicuous opening at the base of Pico that was the entrance to theVault. From this viewpoint, Poole could see that the mountain did not live up tothe name that the early astronomers, misled by its pointed shadow, had given toit. It was more like a rounded hill than a sharp peak, and he could well believethat one of the local pastimes was bicycle-riding to the summit. Until now, noneof those sportsmen and women could have guessed at the secret hidden beneaththeir wheels: he hoped that the sinister knowledge would not discourage theirhealthy exercise.An hour ago, with a sense of mingled sadness and triumph, he had handed over thetablet he had brought -never letting it out of his sight - from Ganymededirectly to the Moon.‘Good-bye, old friends,’ he had murmured. ‘You’ve done well. Perhaps some futuregeneration will reawaken you. But on the whole - I rather hope not.’He could imagine, all too clearly, one desperate reason why Halman’s knowledgemight be needed again. By now, surely, some message was on its way to thatunknown control centre, bearing the news that its servant on Europa no longerexisted. With reasonable luck, it would take 950 years, give or take a few,before any response could be expected.Poole had often cursed Einstein in the past; now he blessed him. Even the powersbehind the Monoliths, it now appeared certain, could not spread their influencefaster than the speed of light. So the human race should have almost amillennium to prepare for the next encounter - if there was to be one. Perhapsby that time, it would be better prepared.Something was emerging from the tunnel - the track-mounted, semi-humanoid robotthat had carried the tablet into the Vault. It was almost comic to see a machineenclosed in the kind of isolation suit used as protection against deadly germsand here on the airless Moon! But no one was taking any chances, howeverunlikely they might seem. After all, the robot had moved among those carefullysequestered nightmares, and although according to its video cameras everythingappeared in order, there was always a chance that some vial had leaked, or somecanister’s seal had broken. The Moon was a very stable environment, but duringthe centuries it had known many quakes and meteor impacts.The robot came to a halt fifty metres outside the tunnel. Slowly, the massiveplug that sealed the Vault swung back into place, and began to rotate in itsthreads, like a giant bolt being screwed into the mountain.‘All not wearing dark glasses, please close your eyes or look away from therobot!’ said an urgent voice over the mooncar radio. Poole twisted round in hisseat, just in time to see an explosion of light on the roof of the vehicle. Whenhe turned back to look at Pico, all that was left of the robot was a heap ofglowing slag; even to someone who had spent much of his life surrounded byvacuum, it seemed altogether wrong that tendrils of smoke were not slowlyspiralling up from it.‘Sterilization completed,’ said the voice of the Mission Controller. ‘Thank you,everybody. Now returning to Plato City.’How ironic - that the human race had been saved by the skilful deployment of itsown insanities! What moral, Poole wondered, could one possibly draw from that?He looked back at the beautiful blue Earth, huddling beneath its tatteredblanket of clouds for protection against the cold of space. Up there, a fewweeks from now, he hoped to cradle his first grandson in his arms.Whatever godlike powers and principalities lurked beyond the stars, Poolereminded himself, for ordinary humans only two things were important - Love andDeath.His body had not yet aged a hundred years: he still had plenty of time for both.EPILOGUE‘Their little universe is very young, and its god is still a child. But it istoo soon to judge them; when We return in the Last Days, We will consider whatshould be saved.’"}]
