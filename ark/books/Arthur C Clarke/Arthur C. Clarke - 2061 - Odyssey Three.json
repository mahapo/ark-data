Especially as I’m a hundred and three - as you knowperfectly well.’‘Here we go again! Anyone would think you’ve never read Professor Rudenko’sbook.’‘Dear old Katerina! We’d planned a get-together on her hundredth birthday. I wasso sorry she never made it - that’s what comes of spending too much time onEarth.’‘Ironic, since she was the one who coined that famous slogan “Gravity is thebringer of old age.”‘Dr Heywood Floyd stared thoughtfully at the ever-changing panorama of thebeautiful planet, only six thousand kilometres away, on which he could neverwalk again. It was even more ironic that, through the most stupid accident ofhis life, he was still in excellent health when virtually all his old friendswere dead.He had been back on Earth only a week when, despite all the warnings and his owndetermination that nothing of the sort would ever happen to him, he had steppedoff that second-storey balcony. (Yes, he had been celebrating: but he had earnedit - he was a hero on the new world to which Leonov had returned.) The multiplefractures had led to complications, which could best be handled in the PasteurSpace Hospital.That had been in 2015. And now - he could not really believe it, but there wasthe calendar on the wall - it was 2061.For Heywood Floyd, the biological clock had not merely been slowed down by theone-sixth Earth gravity of the hospital; twice in his life it had actually beenreversed. It was now generally believed - though some authorities disputed it -that hibernation did more than merely stop the ageing process; it encouragedrejuvenation. Floyd had actually become younger on his voyage to Jupiter andback.‘So you really think it’s safe for me to go?’‘Nothing in this Universe is safe, Heywood. All I can say is that there are nophysiological objections. After all, your environment will be virtually the sameaboard Universe as it is here. She may not have quite the standard of - ah -superlative medical expertise we can provide at Pasteur, but Dr Mahindran is agood man. If there’s any problem he can’t cope with, he can put you intohibernation again, and ship you back to us, COD.’It was the verdict that Floyd had hoped for, yet somehow his pleasure wasalloyed with sadness. He would be away for weeks from his home of almost half acentury, and the new friends of his later years. And although Universe was aluxury liner compared with the primitive Leonov (now hovering high above Farsideas one of the main exhibits at the Lagrange Museum) there was still some elementof risk in any extended space voyage. Especially like the pioneering one onwhich he was now preparing to embark.Yet that, perhaps, was exactly what he was seeking - even at a hundred and three(or, according to the complex geriatric accounting of the late ProfessorKaterina Rudenko, a hale and hearty sixty-five.) During the last decade, he hadbecome aware of an increasing restlessness and a vague dissatisfaction with alife that was too comfortable and well-ordered.Despite all the exciting projects now in progress around the Solar System - theMars Renewal, the establishment of the Mercury Base, the Greening of Ganymede -there had been no goal on which he could really focus his interests and hisstill considerable energies. Two centuries ago, one of the first poets of theScientific Era had summed up his feelings perfectly, speaking through the lipsof Odysseus/Ulysses:Life piled on lifeWere all too little, and of one of meLittle remains; but every hour is savedFrom that eternal silence, something more,A bringer of new things: and vile it wereFor some three suns to store and hoard myself,And this grey spirit yearning in desireTo follow knowledge like a sinking star,Beyond the utmost bound of human thought.‘Three suns’, indeed! It was more than forty:Ulysses would have been ashamed of him. But the next verse - which he knew sowell - was even more appropriate:It may be that the gulfs will wash us down:It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,And see the great Achilles, whom we knew.Though much is taken, much abides; and thoughWe are not now that strength which in old daysMoved earth and heaven; that which we are, we are;One equal temper of heroic hearts,Made weak by time and fate, but strong in willTo strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.‘To seek, to find…’ Well, now he knew what he was going to seek, and to find -because he knew exactly where it would be. Short of some catastrophic accident,there was no way in which it could possibly elude him.It was not a goal he had ever consciously had in mind, and even now he was notquite sure why it had become so suddenly dominant. He would have thought himselfimmune to the fever which was once again infecting mankind - for the second timein his life! - but perhaps he was mistaken. Or it could have been that theunexpected invitation to join the short list of distinguished guests aboardUniverse had fired his imagination, and awakened an enthusiasm he had not evenknown he possessed.There was another possibility. After all these years, he could still rememberwhat an anticlimax the 1985/6 encounter had been to the general public. Now wasa chance - the last for him, and the first for humanity - to more than make upfor any previous disappointment.Back in the twentieth century, only flybys had been possible. This time, therewould be an actual landing, as pioneering in its way as Armstrong’s and Aldrin’sfirst steps on the Moon.Dr Heywood Floyd, veteran of the 2010-15 mission to Jupiter, let his imaginationfly outwards to the ghostly visitor once again returning from the deeps ofspace, gaining speed second by second as it prepared to round the Sun. Andbetween the orbits of Earth and Venus the most famous of all comets would meetthe still uncompleted space-liner Universe, on her maiden flight.The exact point of rendezvous was not yet settled, but his decision was alreadymade.‘Halley - here I come…’ whispered Heywood Floyd."},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREE2"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREEFIRST SIGHTIt is not true that one must leave Earth to appreciate the full splendour of theheavens. Not even in space is the starry sky more glorious than when viewed froma high mountain, on a perfectly clear night, far from any source of artificialillumination. Even though the stars appear brighter beyond the atmosphere, theeye cannot really appreciate the difference; and the overwhelming spectacle ofhalf the celestial sphere at a single glance is something that no observationwindow can provide.But Heywood Floyd was more than content with his private view of the Universe,especially during the times when the residential zone was on the shadow side ofthe slowly revolving space hospital. Then there would be nothing in hisrectangular field of view but stars, planets, nebulae - and occasionally,drowning out all else, the unblinking glare of Lucifer, new rival to the Sun.About ten minutes before the beginning of his artificial night, he would switchoff all the cabin lights - even the red emergency standby - so that he couldbecome completely dark-adapted. A little late in life for a space engineer, hehad learned the pleasures of naked-eye astronomy, and could now identifyvirtually any constellation, even if he could glimpse only a small portion ofit.Almost every ‘night’ that May, as the comet was passing inside the orbit ofMars, he had checked its location on the star charts. Although it was an easyobject with a good pair of binoculars, Floyd had stubbornly resisted their aid;he was playing a little game, seeing how well his ageing eyes would respond tothe challenge. Though two astronomers on Mauna Kea already claimed to haveobserved the comet visually, no-one believed them, and similar assertions fromother residents of Pasteur had been treated with even greater scepticism.But tonight, a magnitude of at least six was predicted; he might be in luck. Hetraced the line from Gamma to Epsilon, and stared towards the apex of animaginary equilateral triangle set upon it - almost as if he could focus hisvision across the Solar System by a sheer effort of will.And there it was! - just as he had first seen it, seventy-six years ago,inconspicuous but unmistakable. If he had not known exactly where to look, hewould not even have noticed it, or would have dismissed it as some distantnebula.To his naked eye it was merely a tiny, perfectly circular blob of mist; strainas he would, he was unable to detect any trace of a tail. But the small flotillaof probes that had been escorting the comet for months had already recorded thefirst outbursts of dust and gas that would soon create a glowing plume acrossthe stars, pointing directly away from its creator, the Sun,Like everyone else, Heywood Floyd had watched the transformation of the cold,dark - no, almost black - nucleus as it entered the inner Solar System. Afterseventy years of deepfreeze, the complex mixture of water, ammonia and otherices was beginning to thaw and bubble. A flying mountain, roughly the shape -and size - of the island of Manhattan was turning on a cosmic spit everyfifty-three hours; as the heat of the Sun seeped through the insulating crust,the vaporizing gases were making Halley’s Comet behave like a leakingsteam-boiler. Jets of water vapour, mixed with dust and a witch’s brew oforganic chemicals, were bursting out from half a dozen small craters; thelargest - about the size of a football field - erupted regularly about two hoursafter local dawn. It looked exactly like a terrestrial geyser, and had beenpromptly christened ‘Old Faithful’.Already, he had fantasies of standing on the rim of that crater, waiting for theSun to rise above the dark, contorted landscape which he already knew wellthrough the images from space. True, the contract said nothing about passengers- as opposed to crew and scientific personnel - going outside the ship when itlanded on Halley.On the other hand, there was also nothing in the small print that specificallyforbade it.They’ll have a job to stop me, thought Heywood Floyd. I’m sure I can stillhandle a spacesuit. And if I’m wrong…He remembered reading that a visitor to the Taj Mahal had once remarked: ‘I’ddie tomorrow for a monument like this.’He would gladly settle for Halley’s Comet."},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREE3"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREERE-ENTRYEven apart from that embarrassing accident, the return to Earth had not beeneasy.The first shock had come soon after revival, when Dr Rudenko had woken him fromhis long sleep. Walter Curnow was hovering beside her, and even in hissemi-conscious state he could tell that something was wrong; their pleasure atseeing him awake was a little too exaggerated, and failed to conceal a sense ofstrain. Not until he was fully recovered did they let him know that Dr Chandrawas no longer with them.Somewhere beyond Mars, so imperceptibly that the monitors could not pinpoint thetime, he had simply ceased to live. His body, set adrift in space, had continuedunchecked along Leonov’s orbit, and had long since been consumed by the fires ofthe Sun.The cause of death was totally unknown, but Max Brailovsky expressed a viewthat, highly unscientific though it was, not even Surgeon-Commander KaterinaRudenko attempted to refute.‘He couldn’t live without Hal.’Walter Curnow, of all people, added another thought.‘I wonder how Hal will take it?’ he asked. ‘Something out there must bemonitoring all our broadcasts. Sooner or later, he’ll know.’And now Curnow was gone too - so were they all except little Zenia. He had notseen her for twenty years, but her card arrived punctually every Christmas. Thelast one was still pinned above his desk; it showed a troika laden with giftsspeeding through the snows of a Russian winter, watched by extremelyhungry-looking wolves.Forty-five years! Sometimes it seemed only yesterday that Leonov had returned toEarth orbit, and the applause of all mankind. Yet it had been a curiouslysubdued applause, respectful but lacking genuine enthusiasm. The mission toJupiter had been altogether too much of a success; it had opened a Pandora’sbox, the full contents of which had yet to be disclosed.When the black monolith known as Tycho Magnetic Anomaly One had been excavatedon the Moon, only a handful of men knew of its existence. Not until afterDiscovery’s ill-fated voyage to Jupiter did the world learn that, four millionyears ago, another intelligence had passed through the Solar System, and leftits calling card. The news was a revelation - but not a surprise; something ofthe sort had been expected for decades.And it had all happened long before the human race existed. Although somemysterious accident had befallen Discovery out round Jupiter, there was no realevidence that it involved anything more than a shipboard malfunction. Althoughthe philosophical consequences of TMA 1 were profound, for all practicalpurposes mankind was still alone in the Universe.Now that was no longer true. Only light minutes away - a mere stone’s throw inthe Cosmos - was an intelligence that could create a star, and, for its owninscrutable purpose, destroy a planet a thousand times the size of Earth. Evenmore ominous was the fact that it had shown awareness of mankind, through thelast message that Discovery had beamed back from the moons of Jupiter justbefore the fiery birth of Lucifer had destroyed it:ALL THESE WORLDS ARE YOURS - EXCEPT EUROPA.ATTEMPT NO LANDINGS THERE.The brilliant new star, which had banished night except for the few months ineach year when it was passing behind the Sun, had brought both hope and fear tomankind. Fear - because the Unknown, especially when it appeared linked withomnipotence - could not fail to rouse such primeval emotions. Hope - because ofthe transformation it had wrought in global politics.It had often been said that the only thing that could unite mankind was a threatfrom space. Whether Lucifer was a threat, no-one knew; but it was certainly achallenge. And that, as it turned out, was enough.Heywood Floyd had watched the geopolitical changes from his vantage point onPasteur, almost as if he was an alien observer himself. At first, he had nointention of remaining in space, once his recovery was complete. To the baffledannoyance of his doctors, that took an altogether unreasonable length of time.Looking back from the tranquillity of later years, Floyd knew exactly why hisbones refused to mend.He simply did not wish to return to Earth: there was nothing for him, down onthe dazzling blue and white globe that filled his sky. There were times when hecould well understand how Chandra might have lost the will to live.It was pure chance that he had not been with his first wife on that flight toEurope. Now Marion was part of another life, that might have belonged to someoneelse, and their two daughters were amiable strangers with families of their own.But he had lost Caroline through his own actions, even though he had no realchoice in the matter. She had never understood (had he really done so himself?)why he had left the beautiful home they had made together, to exile himself foryears in the cold wastes far from the Sun.Though he had known, even before the mission was half over, that Caroline wouldnot wait, he had hoped desperately that Chris would forgive him. But even thisconsolation had been denied; his son had been without a father for too long. Bythe time that Floyd returned, he had found another, in the man who had taken hisplace in Caroline’s life. The estrangement was complete; he thought he wouldnever get over it, but of course he did - after a fashion.His body had cunningly conspired with his unconscious desires. When at last hereturned to Earth, after his protracted convalescence in Pasteur, he promptlydeveloped such alarming symptoms - including something suspiciously like bonenecrosis - that he was immediately rushed back to orbit. And there he hadstayed, apart from a few excursions to the Moon, completely adapted to living inthe zero to one-sixth gravity regime of the slowly rotating space hospital.He was not a recluse - far from it. Even while he was convalescing, he wasdictating reports, giving evidence to endless commissions, being interviewed bymedia representatives. He was a famous man, and enjoyed the experience - whileit lasted. It helped to compensate for his inner wounds.The first complete decade - 2020 to 2030 - seemed to have passed so swiftly thathe now found it difficult to focus upon it. There were the usual crises,scandals, crimes, catastrophes - notably the Great Californian Earthquake, whoseaftermath he had watched with fascinated horror through the station’s monitorscreens. Under their greatest magnification, in favourable conditions, theycould show individual human beings; but from his God’s-eye-view it had beenimpossible to identify with the scurrying dots fleeing from the burning cities.Only the ground cameras revealed the true horror.During that decade, though the results would not be apparent until later, thepolitical tectonic plates were moving as inexorably as the geological ones - yetin the opposite sense, as if time was running backwards. For in the beginning,the Earth had possessed the single supercontinent of Pangaea, which over theaeons had split asunder. So had the human species, into innumerable tribes andnations; now it was merging together, as the old linguistic and culturaldivisions began to blur.Although Lucifer had accelerated the process, it had begun decades earlier, whenthe coming of the jet age had triggered an explosion of global tourism. Atalmost the same time - it was not, of course, a coincidence - satellites andfibre optics had revolutionized communications. With the historic abolition oflong-distance charges on 31 December 2000, every telephone call became a localone, and the human race greeted the new millennium by transforming itself intoone huge, gossiping family.Like most families, it was not always a peaceful one, but its disputes no longerthreatened the entire planet. The second - and last - nuclear war saw the use incombat of no more bombs than the first: precisely two. And though thekilotonnage was greater, the casualties were far fewer, as both were usedagainst sparsely populated oil installations. At that point the Big Three ofChina, the US and the USSR moved with commendable speed and wisdom, sealing offthe battle zone until the surviving combatants had come to their senses.By the decade of 2020-30, a major war between the Great Powers was asunthinkable as one between Canada and the United States had been in the centurybefore. This was not due to any vast improvement in human nature, or indeed toany single factor except the normal preference of life over death. Much of themachinery of peace was not even consciously planned: before the politiciansrealized what had happened, they discovered that it was in place, andfunctioning well…No statesman, no idealist of any persuasion invented the ‘Peace Hostage’movement; the very name was not coined until well after someone had noticed thatat any given moment there were a hundred thousand Russian tourists in the UnitedStates - and half a million Americans in the Soviet Union, most of them engagedin their traditional pastime of complaining about the plumbing. And perhaps evenmore to the point, both groups contained a disproportionately large number ofhighly non-expendable individuals - the sons and daughters of wealth, privilegeand political power.And even if one wished, it was no longer possible to plan a large-scale war. TheAge of Transparency had dawned in the 1990s, when enterprising news media hadstarted to launch photographic satellites with resolutions comparable to thosethat the military had possessed for three decades. The Pentagon and the Kremlinwere furious; but they were no match for Reuters, Associated Press and theunsleeping, twenty-four-hours-a-day cameras of the Orbital News Service.By 2060, even though the world had not been completely disarmed, it had beeneffectively pacified, and the fifty remaining nuclear weapons were all underinternational control. There was surprisingly little opposition when thatpopular monarch, Edward VIII, was elected the first Planetary President, only adozen states dissenting. They ranged in size and importance from the stillstubbornly neutral Swiss (whose restaurants and hotels nevertheless greeted thenew bureaucracy with open arms) to the even more fanatically independentMalvinians, who now resisted all attempts by the exasperated British andArgentines to foist them off on each other.The dismantling of the vast and wholly parasitic armaments industry had given anunprecedented - sometimes, indeed, unhealthy - boost to the world economy. Nolonger were vital raw materials and brilliant engineering talents swallowed upin a virtual black hole - or, even worse, turned to destruction. Instead, theycould be used to repair the ravages and neglect of centuries, by rebuilding theworld.And building new ones. Now indeed mankind had found the ‘moral equivalent ofwar’, and a challenge that could absorb the surplus energies of the race - foras many millennia ahead as anyone dared to dream."},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREE4"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREETYCOONWhen he was born, William Tsung had been called ‘the most expensive baby in theworld’; he held the title for only two years before it was claimed by hissister. She still held it, and now that the Family Laws had been repealed, itwould never be challenged.Their father, the legendary Sir Lawrence, had been born when China hadre-instituted the stringent ‘One Child, One Family’ rule; his generation hadprovided psychologists and social scientists with material for endless studies.Having no brothers or sisters - and in many cases, no uncles or aunts - it wasunique in human history. Whether credit was due to the resilience of the speciesor the merit of the Chinese ‘extended family’ system would probably never besettled. The fact remained that the children of that strange time wereremarkably free from scars; but they were certainly not unaffected, and SirLawrence had done his somewhat spectacular best to make up for the isolation ofhis infancy.When his second child was born in ‘22, the licensing system had become law. Youcould have as many children as you wished, provided only that you paid theappropriate fee. (The surviving old guard communists were not the only ones whothought the whole scheme perfectly appalling, but they were outvoted by theirpragmatic colleagues in the fledgling congress of the People’s DemocraticRepublic.)Numbers one and two were free. Number three cost a million sols. Number four wastwo million. Number five was four million, and so on. The fact that, in theory,there were no capitalists in the People’s Republic was cheerfully ignored.Young Mr Tsung (that was years, of course, before King Edward gave him his KBE)never revealed if he had any target in mind; he was still a fairly poormillionaire when his fifth child was born. But he was still only forty, and whenthe purchase of Hong Kong did not take quite as much of his capital as he hadfeared, he discovered that he had a considerable amount of small change in hand.So ran the legend - but, like many other stories about Sir Lawrence, it was hardto distinguish fact from mythology. There was certainly no truth in thepersistent rumour that he had made his first fortune through the famousshoe-box-sized pirate edition of the Library of Congress. The whole MolecularMemory Module racket was an off-Earth operation, made possible by the UnitedStates’ failure to sign the Lunar Treaty.Even though Sir Lawrence was not a multitrillionaire, the complex ofcorporations he had built up made him the greatest financial power on earth - nosmall achievement for the son of a humble videocassette peddler in what wasstill known as the New Territories. He probably never noticed the eight millionfor Child Number Six, or even the thirty-two for Number Eight. The sixty-four hehad to advance on Number Nine attracted world publicity, and after Number Tenthe bets placed on his future plans may well have exceeded the two hundred andfifty-six million the next child would have cost him. However, at that point theLady Jasmine, who combined the best properties of steel and silk in exquisiteproportion, decided that the Tsung dynasty was adequately established.It was quite by chance (if there is such a thing) that Sir Lawrence becamepersonally involved in the space business. He had, of course, extensive maritimeand aeronautical interests, but these were handled by his five sons and theirassociates. Sir Lawrence’s real love was communications - newspapers (those fewthat were left), books, magazines (paper and electronic) and, above all, theglobal television networks.Then he had bought the magnificent old Peninsular Hotel, which to a poor Chineseboy had once seemed the very symbol of wealth and power, and turned it into hisresidence and main office. He surrounded it by a beautiful park, by the simpleexpedient of pushing the huge shopping centres underground (his newly formedLaser Excavation Corporation made a fortune in the process, and set a precedentfor many other cities).One day, as he was admiring the unparalleled skyline of the city across theharbour, he decided that a further improvement was necessary. The view from thelower floors of the Peninsular had been blocked for decades by a large buildinglooking like a squashed golfball. This, Sir Lawrence decided, would have to go.The Director of the Hong Kong Planetarium - widely considered to be among thefive best in the world - had other ideas, and very soon Sir Lawrence wasdelighted to discover someone he could not buy at any price. The two men becamefirm friends; but when Dr Hessenstein arranged a special presentation for SirLawrence’s sixtieth birthday, he did not know that he would help to change thehistory of the Solar System."},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREE5"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREEOUT OF THE ICEMore than a hundred years after Zeiss had built the first prototype in Jena in1924, there were still a few optical planetarium projectors in use, loomingdramatically over their audiences. But Hong Kong had retired itsthird-generation instrument decades ago, in favour of the far more versatileelectronic system. The whole of the great dome was, essentially, a gianttelevision screen, made up of thousands of separate panels, on which anyconceivable image could be displayed.The programme had opened - inevitably - with a tribute to the unknown inventorof the rocket, somewhere in China during the thirteenth century. The first fiveminutes were a high-speed historical survey, giving perhaps less than due creditto the Russian, German and American pioneers in order to concentrate on thecareer of Dr Hsue-Shen Tsien. His countrymen could be excused, in such a timeand place, if they made him appear as important in the history of rocketdevelopment as Goddard, von Braun, or Koroylev. And they certainly had justgrounds for indignation at his arrest on trumped-up charges in the United Stateswhen, after helping to establish the famed Jet Propulsion Laboratory and beingappointed Caltech’s first Goddard Professor, he decided to return to hishomeland.The launching of the first Chinese satellite by the ‘Long March 1′ rocket in1970 was barely mentioned, perhaps because at that time the Americans werealready walking on the Moon. Indeed, the rest of the twentieth century wasdismissed in a few minutes, to take the story up to 2007 and the construction ofthe spaceship Tsien.The narrator did not gloat unduly over the consternation of the otherspacefaring powers, when a presumed Chinese space station suddenly blasted outof orbit and headed for Jupiter, to overtake the Russian-American mission aboardthe Cosmonaut Alexei Leonov. The story was dramatic - and tragic - enough torequire no embellishment.Unfortunately, there was very little authentic visual material to illustrate it:the programme had to rely largely on special effects and intelligentreconstruction from later, long-range photo-surveys. During their brief sojournon the icy surface of Europa, Tsien’s crew had been far too busy to maketelevision documentaries, or even set up an unattended camera.Nevertheless, the words spoken at the time conveyed much of the drama of thatfirst landing on the moons of Jupiter. The commentary broadcast from theapproaching Leonov by Heywood Floyd served admirably to set the scene, and therewere plenty of library shots of Europa to illustrate it:‘At this very moment I’m looking at it through the most powerful of the ship’stelescopes; under this magnification, it’s ten times larger than the Moon as yousee it with the naked eye. And it’s a really weird sight.‘The surface is a uniform pink, with a few small brown patches. It’s coveredwith an intricate network of narrow lines, curling and weaving in alldirections. In fact, it looks very much like a photo from a medical textbook,showing a pattern of veins and arteries.‘A few of these features are hundreds - or even thousands - of kilometres long,and look rather like the illusory canals that Percival Lowell and otherearly-twentieth-century astronomers imagined they’d seen on Mars.‘But Europa’s canals aren’t an illusion, though of course they’re notartificial. What’s more, they do contain water - or at least ice. For thesatellite is almost entirely covered by ocean, averaging fifty kilometres deep.‘Because it’s so far from the Sun, Europa’s surface temperature is extremely low- about a hundred and fifty degrees below freezing. So one might expect itssingle ocean to be a solid block of ice.‘Surprisingly, that isn’t the case because there’s a lot of heat generatedinside Europa by tidal forces - the same forces that drive the great volcanoeson neighbouring Io.‘So the ice is continually melting, breaking up and freezing, forming cracks andlanes like those in the floating ice sheets in our own polar regions. It’s thatintricate tracery of cracks I’m seeing now; most of them are dark and veryancient - perhaps millions of years old. But a few are almost pure white;they’re the new ones that have just opened up, and have a crust only a fewcentimetres thick.‘Tsien has landed right beside one of these white streaks - thefifteen-hundred-kilometre-long feature that’s been christened the Grand Canal.Presumably the Chinese intend to pump its water into their propellant tanks, sothat they can explore the Jovian satellite system and then return to Earth. Thatmay not be easy, but they’ll certainly have studied the landing site with greatcare, and must know what they’re doing.‘It’s obvious, now, why they’ve taken such a risk - and why they claim Europa.As a refuelling point, it could be the key to the entire Solar System…’But it hadn’t worked out that way, thought Sir Lawrence, as he reclined in hisluxurious chair beneath the streaked and mottled disc that filled his artificialsky. The oceans of Europa were still inaccessible to mankind, for reasons whichwere still a mystery. And not only inaccessible, but invisible: since Jupiterhad become a sun, both its inner satellites had vanished beneath clouds ofvapour boiling out from their interiors. He was looking at Europa as it had beenback in 2010 - not as it was today.He had been little more than a boy then, but could still remember the pride hefelt in knowing that his countrymen - however much he disapproved of theirpolitics - were about to make the first landing on a virgin world.There had been no camera there, of course, to record that landing, but thereconstruction was superbly done. He could really believe that was the doomedspaceship dropping silently out of the jetblack sky towards the Europanicescape, and coming to rest beside the discoloured band of recently frozenwater that had been christened the Grand Canal.Everyone knew what had happened next; perhaps wisely, there had been no attemptto reproduce it visually. Instead, the image of Europa faded, to be replaced bya portrait as familiar to every Chinese as Yuri Gagarin’s was to every Russian.The first photograph showed Rupert Chang on his graduation day in 1989 - theearnest young scholar, indistinguishable from a million others, utter1y unawareof his appointment with history two decades in the future.Briefly, to a background of subdued music, the commentator summed up thehighlights of Dr Chang’s career, until his appointment as Science Officer aboardTsien. Cross-sections in time, the photographs grew older, until the last one,taken immediately before the mission.Sir Lawrence was glad of the planetarium’s darkness; both his friends and hisenemies would have been surprised to see the moisture gathering in his eyes ashe listened to the message that Dr Chang had aimed towards the approachingLeonov, never knowing if it would be received.‘… know you are aboard Leonov… may not have much time… aiming my suit antennawhere I think…’The signal vanished for agonizing seconds, then came back much clearer, thoughnot appreciably louder.‘… relay this information to Earth. Tsien destroyed three hours ago. I’m onlysurvivor. Using my suit radio - no idea if it has enough range, but it’s theonly chance. Please listen carefully. THERE IS LIFE ON EUROPA. I repeat: THEREIS LIFE ON EUROPA…The signal faded again.‘… soon after local midnight. We were pumping steadily and the tanks were almosthalf full. Dr Lee and I went out to check the pipe insulation. Tsien stands -stood - about thirty metres from the edge of the Grand Canal. Pipes go directlyfrom it and down through the ice. Very thin - not safe to walk on. The warmupwelling…’Again a long silence.‘… no problem - five kilowatts of lighting strung up on the ship. Like aChristmas tree - beautiful, shining right through the ice. Glorious colours. Leesaw it first - a huge dark mass rising up from the depths. At first we thoughtit was a school of fish - too large for a single organism - then it started tobreak through the ice.‘… like huge strands of wet seaweed, crawling along the ground. Lee ran back tothe ship to get a camera - I stayed to watch, reporting over the radio. Thething moved so slowly I could easily outrun it. I was much more excited thanalarmed. Thought I knew what kind of creature it was - I’ve seen pictures of thekelp forests off California - but I was quite wrong…I could tell it was in trouble. It couldn’t possibly survive at a temperature ahundred and fifty below its normal environment. It was freezing solid as itmoved forward - bits were breaking off like glass - but it was still advancingtowards the ship - a black tidal wave, slowing down all the time.‘I was still so surprised that I couldn’t think straight and I couldn’t imaginewhat it was trying to do.‘… climbing up the ship, building a kind of ice tunnel as it advanced. Perhapsthis was insulating it from the cold - the way termites protect themselves fromSunlight with their little corridors of mud.‘… tons of ice on the ship. The radio antennas broke off first. Then I could seethe landing legs beginning to buckle - all in slow motion, like a dream.‘Not until the ship started to topple did I realize what the thing was trying todo - and then it was too late. We could have saved ourselves - if we’d onlyswitched off those lights.‘Perhaps it’s a phototrope, its biological cycle triggered by the Sunlight thatfilters through the ice. Or it could have been attracted like a moth to acandle. Our floodlights must have been more brilliant than anything that Europahas ever known.‘Then the ship crashed. I saw the hull split, a cloud of snowflakes form asmoisture condensed. All the lights went out, except for one, swinging back andforth on a cable a couple of metres above the ground.‘I don’t know what happened immediately after that. The next thing I remember, Iwas standing under the light, beside the wreck of the ship, with a finepowdering of fresh snow all around me. I could see my footsteps in it veryclearly… I must have run there; perhaps only a minute or two had elapsed…‘The plant - I still thought of it as a plant - was motionless. I wondered if ithad been damaged by the impact; large sections - as thick as a man’s arm -hadsplintered off, like broken twigs.‘Then the main trunk started to move again. It pulled away from the hull, andbegan to crawl towards me. That was when I knew for certain that the thing waslight-sensitive: I was standing immediately under the thousand-watt lamp, whichhad stopped swinging now.‘Imagine an oak tree - better still, a banyan with its multiple trunks and roots- flattened out by gravity and trying to creep along the ground. It got towithin five metres of the light, then started to spread out until it had made aperfect circle around me. Presumably that was the limit of its tolerance -thepoint at which photo-attraction turned to repulsion. After that, nothinghappened for several minutes. I wondered if it was dead - frozen solid at last.‘Then I saw that large buds were forming on many of the branches. It was likewatching a time-lapse film of flowers opening. In fact I thought they wereflowers - each about as big as a man’s head.‘Delicate, beautifully coloured membranes started to unfold. Even then, itoccurred to me that no-one - no thing - could ever have seen these coloursbefore; they had no existence until we brought our lights - our fatal lights -to this world.‘Tendrils, stamens, waving feebly… I walked over to the living wall thatsurrounded me, so that I would see exactly what was happening. Neither then, orat any other time, had I felt the slightest fear of the creature. I was certainthat it was not malevolent - if indeed it was conscious at all.‘There were scores of the big flowers, in various stages of unfolding. Now, theyreminded me of butterflies, just emerging from the chrysalis… wings crumpled,still feeble… I was getting closer and closer to the truth.‘But they were freezing - dying as quickly as they formed. Then, one afteranother, they dropped off from the parent buds. For a few moments they floppedaround like fish stranded on dry land - and at last I realized exactly what theywere. Those membranes weren’t petals - they were fins, or their equivalent. Thiswas the free-swimming, larval stage of the creature. Probably it spends much ofits life rooted on the seabed, then sends these mobile offspring in search ofnew territory. Just like the corals of Earth’s oceans.‘I knelt down to get a closer look at one of the little creatures. The beautifulcolours were fading now, to a drab brown. Some of the petal-fins had snappedoff, becoming brittle shards as they froze. But it was still moving feebly, andas I approached it tried to avoid me. I wondered how it sensed my presence.‘Then I noticed that the stamens - as I’d called them - all carried bright bluedots at their tips. They looked like tiny star sapphires - or the blue eyesalong the mantle of a scallop - aware of light, but unable to form true images.As I watched, the vivid blue faded, the sapphires became dull, ordinary stones…‘Dr Floyd - or anyone else who is listening - I haven’t much more time - Jupiterwill soon block my signal. But I’ve almost finished.‘I knew then what I had to do. The cable to that thousand-watt lamp was hangingalmost to the ground. I gave it a few tugs, and the light went out in a showerof sparks.‘I wondered if it was too late. For a few minutes, nothing happened. So I walkedover to the wall of tangled branches around me, and kicked it.‘Slowly, the creature started to unweave itself, and to retreat back to theCanal. There was plenty of light - I could see everything perfectly. Ganymedeand Callisto were in the sky - Jupiter was a huge, thin crescent - and there wasa big auroral display on the nightside, at the Jovian end of the Io flux tube.There was no need to use my helmet light.‘I followed the creature all the way back to the water, encouraging it with morekicks when it slowed down, feeling the fragments of ice crunching all the timebeneath my boots… As it neared the Canal, it seemed to gain strength and energy,as if it knew that it was approaching its natural home. I wondered if it wouldsurvive, to bud again.‘It disappeared through the surface, leaving a few last dead larvae on the alienland. The exposed free water bubbled for a few minutes until a scab ofprotective ice sealed it from the vacuum above. Then I walked back to the shipto see if there was anything to salvage - I don’t want to talk about that…‘I’ve only two requests to make, Doctor. When the taxonomists classify thiscreature, I hope they’ll name it after me.‘And - when the next ship comes home - ask them to take our bones back toChina..‘Jupiter will be cutting us off in a few minutes. I wish I knew whether anyonewas receiving me. Anyway, I’ll repeat this message when we’re in line of sightagain - if my suit’s life-support system lasts that long.‘This is Professor Chang on Europa, reporting the destruction of spaceshipTsien. We landed beside the Grand Canal and set up our pumps at the edge of theice…’The signal faded abruptly, came back for a moment, then disappeared completelybelow the noise level. There would never be any further message from ProfessorChang; but it had already deflected Lawrence Tsung’s ambitions into space."},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREE6"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREETHE GREENING OF GANYMEDERolf van der Berg was the right man, in the right place, at the right time; noother combination would have worked. Which, of course, is how much of history ismade.He was the right man because he was a second-generation Afrikaner refugee, and atrained geologist; both factors were equally important. He was in the rightplace, because that had to be the largest of the Jovian moons - third outwardsin the sequence Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto.The time was not so critical, for the information had been ticking away like adelayed-action bomb in the data banks for at least a decade. Van der Berg didnot encounter it until ‘57; even then it took him another year to convincehimself that he was not crazy - and it was ‘59 before he had quietly sequesteredthe original records so that no-one could duplicate his discovery. Only thencould he safely give his full attention to the main problem: what to do next.It had all begun, as is so often the case, with an apparently trivialobservation in a field which did not even concern van der Berg directly. Hisjob, as a member of the Planetary Engineering Task Force, was to survey andcatalogue the natural resources of Ganymede; he had little business foolingaround with the forbidden satellite next door.But Europa was an enigma which no-one - least of all its immediate neighbours -could ignore for long. Every seven days it passed between Ganymede and thebrilliant minisun that had once been Jupiter, producing eclipses which couldlast as long as twelve minutes. At its closest, it appeared slightly smallerthan the Moon as seen from Earth, but it dwindled to a mere quarter of that sizewhen it was on the other side of its orbit.The eclipses were often spectacular. Just before it slid between Ganymede andLucifer, Europa would become an ominous black disc, outlined with a ring ofcrimson fire, as the light of the new sun was refracted through the atmosphereit had helped to create.In less than half a human lifetime, Europa had been transformed. The crust ofice on the hemisphere always facing Lucifer had melted, to form the SolarSystem’s second ocean. For a decade it had foamed and bubbled into the vacuumabove it, until equilibrium had been reached. Now Europa possessed a thin butserviceable - though not to human beings - atmosphere of water vapour, hydrogensulphide, carbon and sulphur dioxides, nitrogen, and miscellaneous rare gases.Though the somewhat misnamed ‘nightside’ of the satellite was still permanentlyfrozen, an area as large as Africa now had a temperate climate, liquid water,and a few scattered islands.All this, and not much more, had been observed through telescopes in Earthorbit. By the time that the first full-scale expedition had been launched to theGalilean moons, in 2028, Europa had already become veiled by a permanent mantleof clouds. Cautious radar probing revealed little but smooth ocean on one face,and almost equally smooth ice on the other; Europa still maintained itsreputation as the flattest piece of real estate in the Solar System. Ten yearslater, that was no longer true: something drastic had happened to Europa. It nowpossessed a solitary mountain, almost as high as Everest, jutting up through theice of the twilight zone. Presumably some volcanic activity - like thatoccurring ceaselessly on neighbouring Io - had thrust this mass of materialskywards. The vastly increased heat-flow from Lucifer could have triggered suchan event.But there were problems with this obvious explanation. Mount Zeus was anirregular pyramid, not the usual volcanic cone, and radar scans showed none ofthe characteristic lava flows. Some poor-quality photographs obtained throughtelescopes on Ganymede, during a momentary break in the clouds, suggested thatit was made of ice, like the frozen landscape around it. Whatever the answer,the creation of Mount Zeus had been a traumatic experience for the world itdominated, for the entire crazy-paving pattern of fractured ice floes over thenightside had changed completely.One maverick scientist had put forward the theory that Mount Zeus was a ‘cosmiciceberg’ - a cometary fragment that had dropped upon Europa from space; batteredCallisto gave ample proof that such bombardments had occurred in the remotepast. The theory was very unpopular on Ganymede, whose would-be colonistsalready had sufficient problems.They had been much relieved when van der Berg had refuted the theoryconvincingly; any mass of ice this size would have shattered on impact - andeven if it hadn’t, Europa’s gravity, modest though it was, would have quicklybrought about its collapse. Radar measurements showed that though Mount Zeus wasindeed steadily sinking, its overall shape remained completely unaltered. Icewas not the answer.The problem could, of course, have been settled by sending a single probethrough the clouds of Europa. Unfortunately, whatever was beneath that almostpermanent overcast did not encourage curiosity.ALL THESE WORLDS ARE YOURS - EXCEPT EUROPA.ATTEMPT NO LANDINGS THERE.That last message relayed from the spaceship Discovery just before itsdestruction had not been forgotten, but there had been endless arguments aboutits interpretation. Did ‘landings’ refer to robot probes, or only to mannedvehicles? And what about close flybys - manned or unmanned? Or balloons floatingin the upper atmosphere?The scientists were anxious to find out, but the general public was distinctlynervous. Any power that could detonate the mightiest planet in the Solar Systemwas not to be trifled with. And it would take centuries to explore and exploitIo, Ganymede, Callisto and the dozens of minor satellites; Europa could wait.More than once, therefore, van der Berg had been told not to waste his valuabletime on research of no practical importance, when there was so much to be doneon Ganymede. (’Where can we find carbon - phosphorus - nitrates for thehydroponic farms? How stable is the Barnard Escarpment? Is there any danger ofmore mudslides in Phrygia?’ And so on and so forth…) But he had inherited hisBoer ancestors’ well-deserved reputation for stubbornness: even when he wasworking on his numerous other projects, he kept looking over his shoulder atEuropa.And one day, just a few hours, a gale from the nightside cleared the skies aboutMount Zeus."},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREE7"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREETRANSIT‘I too take leave of all 1 ever had…’From what depths of memory had that line come swimming up to the surface?Heywood Floyd closed his eyes, and tried to focus on the past. It was certainlyfrom a poem - and he had hardly read a line of poetry since leaving college. Andlittle enough then, except during a short English Appreciation Seminar.With no further clues, it might take the station computer quite a while -perhaps as much as ten minutes - to locate the line in the whole body of Englishliterature. But that would be cheating (not to mention expensive) and Floydpreferred to accept the intellectual challenge.A war poem, of course - but which war? There had been so many in the twentiethcentury.He was still searching through the mental mists when his guests arrived, movingwith the effortless, slow-motion grace of longtime one-sixth gravity residents.The society of Pasteur was strongly influenced by what had been christened‘centrifugal stratification’; some people never left the zero gee of the hub,while those who hoped one day to return to Earth preferred the almostnormal-weight regime out on the rim of the huge, slowly revolving disc.George and Jerry were now Floyd’s oldest and closest friends - which wassurprising, because they had so few obvious points in common. Looking back onhis own somewhat chequered emotional career - two marriages, three formalcontracts, two informal ones, three children - he often envied the long-termstability of their relationship, apparently quite unaffected by the ‘nephews’from Earth or Moon who visited them from time to time.‘Haven’t you ever thought of divorce?’ he had once asked them teasingly.As usual, George - whose acrobatic yet profoundly serious conducting had beenlargely responsible for the comeback of the classical orchestra - was at no lossfor words.‘Divorce - never,’ was his swift reply. ‘Murder - often.’‘Of course, he’d never get away with it,’ Jerry had retorted. ‘Sebastian wouldspill the beans.’Sebastian was a beautiful and talkative parrot which the couple had importedafter a long battle with the hospital authorities. He could not only talk, butcould reproduce the opening bars of the Sibelius Violin Concerto, with whichJerry - considerably helped by Antonio Stradivari - had made his reputation halfa century ago.Now the time had come to say goodbye to George, Jerry and Sebastian - perhapsonly for a few weeks, perhaps for ever. Floyd had already made all his otherfarewells, in a round of parties that had gravely depleted the station’s winecellar, and could think of nothing he had left undone.Archie, his early-model but still perfectly serviceable comsec, had beenprogrammed to handle all incoming messages, either by sending out appropriatereplies or by routing anything urgent and personal to him aboard Universe. Itwould be strange, after all these years, not to be able to talk to anyone hewished - though in compensation he could also avoid unwanted callers. After afew days into the voyage, the ship would be far enough from Earth to makereal-time conversation impossible, and all communication would have to be byrecorded voice or teletext.‘We thought you were our friend,’ complained George. ‘It was a dirty trick tomake us your executors - especially as you’re not going to leave us anything.’‘You may have a few surprises,’ grinned Floyd. ‘Anyway, Archie will take care ofall the details. I’d just like you to monitor my mail, in case there’s anythinghe doesn’t understand.’‘If he won’t, nor will we. What do we know about all your scientific societiesand that sort of nonsense?’‘They can look after themselves. Please see that the cleaning staff doesn’t messthings up too badly while I’m away - and, if I don’t come back - here are a fewpersonal items I’d like delivered - mostly family.’Family! There were pains, as well as pleasures, in living as long as he haddone.It had been sixty-three - sixty-three! - years since Marion had died in that aircrash. Now he felt a twinge of guilt, because he could not even recall the griefhe must have known. Or at best, it was a synthetic reconstruction, not a genuinememory.What would they have meant to each other, had she still been alive? She wouldhave been just a hundred years old by now.And now the two little girls he had once loved so much were friendly,grey-haired strangers in their late sixties, with children - and grandchildren!- of their own. At last count there had been nine on that side of the family;without Archie’s help, he would never be able to keep track of their names. Butat least they all remembered him at Christmas, through duty if not affection.His second marriage, of course, had overlain the memories of his first, like thelater writing on a medieval palimpsest. That too had ended, fifty years ago,somewhere between Earth and Jupiter. Though he had hoped for a reconciliationwith both wife and son, there had been time for only one brief meeting, amongall the welcoming ceremonies, before his accident exiled him to Pasteur.The meeting had not been a success; nor had the second, arranged at considerableexpense and difficulty aboard the space hospital itself - indeed, in this veryroom. Chris had been twenty then, and had just married; if there was one thingthat united Floyd and Caroline, it was disapproval of his choice.Yet Helena had turned out remarkably well: she had been a good mother to ChrisII, born barely a month after the marriage. And when, like so many other youngwives, she was widowed by the Copernicus Disaster, she did not lose her head.There was a curious irony in the fact that both Chris I and II had lost theirfathers to space, though in very different ways. Floyd had returned briefly tohis eight-year-old son as a total stranger; Chris II had at least known a fatherfor the first decade of his life, before losing him for ever.And where was Chris these days? Neither Caroline nor Helena - who were now thebest of friends - seemed to know whether he was on Earth or in space. But thatwas typical; only postcards date-stamped CLAVIUS BASE had informed his family ofhis first visit to the Moon.Floyd’s card was still taped prominently above his desk. Chris II had a goodsense of humour - and of history. He had mailed his grandfather that famousphotograph of the Monolith, looming over the spacesuited figures gathered roundit in the Tycho excavation, more than half a century ago. All the others in thegroup were now dead, and the Monolith itself was no longer on the Moon. In 2006,after much controversy, it had been brought to Earth and erected - an uncannyecho of the main building - in the United Nations Plaza. It had been intended toremind the human race that it was no longer alone; five years later, withLucifer blazing in the sky, no such reminder was needed.Floyd’s fingers were not very steady - sometimes his right hand seemed to have awill of its own - as he unpeeled the card and slipped it into his pocket. Itwould be almost the only personal possession he would take when he boardedUniverse.‘Twenty-five days - you’ll be back before we’ve noticed you’re gone,’ saidJerry. ‘And by the way, is it true that you’ll have Dimitri onboard?’‘That little Cossack!’ snorted George. ‘I conducted his Second Symphony, back in‘22.’‘Wasn’t that when the First Violin threw up, during the largo?’‘No - that was Mahler, not Mihailovich. And anyway it was the brass, so nobodynoticed - except the unlucky tuba player, who sold his instrument the next day.’‘You’re making this up!’‘Of course. But give the old rascal my love, and ask him if he remembers thatnight we had out in Vienna. Who else have you got aboard?’‘I’ve heard horrible rumours about press gangs,’ said Jerry thoughtful1y.‘Greatly exaggerated, I can assure you. We’ve all been personally chosen by SirLawrence for our intelligence, wit, beauty, charisma, or other redeemingvirtue.’‘Not expendability?’‘Well, now that you mention it, we’ve all had to sign a depressing legaldocument, absolving Tsung Spacelines from every conceivable liability. My copy’sin that file, by the way.’‘Any chance of us collecting on it?’ asked George hopefully.‘No - my lawyers say it’s iron-clad. Tsung agrees to take me to Halley and back,give me food, water, air, and a room with a view.’‘And in return?’‘When I get back I’ll do my best to promote future voyages, make some videoappearances, write a few articles - all very reasonable, for the chance of alifetime. Oh yes - I’ll also entertain my fellow passengers - and vice versa.’‘How? Song and dance?’‘Well, I hope to inflict selected portions of my memoirs on a captive audience.But I don’t think I’ll be able to compete with the professionals. Did you knowthat Yva Merlin will be on board?’‘What! How did they coax her out of that Park Avenue cell?’‘She must be a hundred and - oops, sorry, Hey.’ ‘She’s seventy, plus or minusfive.’‘Forget the minus. I was just a kid when Napoleon came out.’There was a long pause while each of the trio scanned his memories of thatfamous work. Although some critics considered her Scarlett O’Hara to be herfinest role, to the general public Yva Merlin (née Evelyn Miles, when she wasborn in Cardiff, South Wales) was still identified with Josephine. Almost half acentury ago, David Griffin’s controversial epic had delighted the French andinfuriated the British - though both sides now agreed that he had occasionallyallowed his artistic impulses to trifle with the historical record, notably inthe spectacular final sequence of the Emperor’s coronation in Westminster Abbey.‘That’s quite a scoop for Sir Lawrence,’ said George thoughtfully.‘I think I can claim some credit for that. Her father was an astronomer - heworked for me at one time - and she’s always been quite interested in science.So I made a few video calls.’Heywood Floyd did not feel it necessary to add that, like a substantial fractionof the human race, he had fallen in love with Yva ever since the appearance ofGWTW Mark II.‘Of course,’ he continued, ‘Sir Lawrence was delighted - but I had to convincehim that she had more than a casual interest in astronomy. Otherwise the voyagecould be a social disaster.’‘Which reminds me,’ said George, producing a small package he had been not verysuccessfully hiding behind his back. ‘We have a little present for you.’‘Can I open it now?’‘Do you think he should?’ Jerry wondered anxiously.‘In that case, I certainly will,’ said Floyd, untying the bright green ribbonand unwrapping the paper.Inside was a nicely framed painting. Although Floyd knew little of art, he hadseen it before; indeed, who could ever forget it?The makeshift raft tossing on the waves was crowded with half-naked castaways,some already moribund, others waving desperately at a ship on the horizon.Beneath it was the caption:THE RAFT OF THE MEDUSA(Theodore Géricault, 1791-1824)And underneath that was the message, signed by George and Jerry: ‘Getting thereis half the fun.’‘You’re a pair of bastards, and I love you dearly,’ said Floyd, embracing themboth. The ATTENTION light on Archie’s keyboard was flashing briskly; it was timeto go.His friends left in a silence more eloquent than words. For the last time,Heywood Floyd looked around the little room that had been his universe foralmost half his life.And suddenly he remembered how that poem ended:‘I have been happy: happy now I go.’"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREE8"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREESTARFLEETSir Lawrence Tsung was not a sentimental man, and was far too cosmopolitan totake patriotism seriously - though as an undergraduate he had briefly sportedone of the artificial pigtails worn during the Third Cultural Revolution. Yetthe planetarium re-enactment of the Tsien disaster moved him deeply, and causedhim to focus much of his enormous influence and energy upon space.Before long, he was taking weekend trips to the Moon, and had appointed his sonCharles (the thirty-two-million-so! one) as Vice-President of TsungAstrofreight. The new corporation had only two catapult-launched,hydrogen-fuelled ramrockets of less than a thousand tons empty mass; they wouldsoon be obsolete, but they could provide Charles with the experience that, SirLawrence was quite certain, would be needed in the decades ahead. For at longlast, the Space Age was truly about to begin.Little more than half a century had separated the Wright Brothers and the comingof cheap, mass air transportation; it had taken twice as long to meet the fargreater challenge of the Solar System.Yet when Luis Alvarez and his team had discovered muon-catalysed fusion back inthe 1950s, it had seemed no more than a tantalizing laboratory curiosity, ofonly theoretical interest. Just as the great Lord Rutherford had pooh-poohed theprospects of atomic power, so Alvarez himself doubted that ‘cold nuclear fusion’would ever be of practical importance. Indeed, it was not until 2040 that theunexpected and accidental manufacture of stable muonium-hydrogen ‘compounds’ hadopened up a new chapter of human history - exactly as the discovery of theneutron had initiated the Atomic Age.Now small, portable nuclear power plants could be built, with a minimum ofshielding. Such enormous investments had already been made in conventionalfusion that the world’s electrical utilities were not - at first - affected, butthe impact on space travel was immediate; it could be paralleled only by the jetrevolution in air transport of a hundred years earlier.No longer energy-limited, spacecraft could achieve far greater speeds; flighttimes in the Solar System could now be measured in weeks rather than months oreven years. But the muon drive was still a reaction device - a sophisticatedrocket, no different in principle from its chemically fuelled ancestors; itneeded a working fluid to give it thrust. And the cheapest, cleanest, and mostconvenient of all working fluids was - plain water.The Pacific Spaceport was not likely to run short of this useful substance.Matters were different at the next port of call - the Moon. Not a trace of waterhad been discovered by the Surveyor, Apollo, and Luna missions. If the Moon hadever possessed any native water, aeons of meteoric bombardment had boiled andblasted it into space.Or so the selenologists believed; yet clues to the contrary had been visible,ever since Galileo had turned his first telescope upon the Moon. Some lunarmountains, for a few hours after dawn, glitter as brilliantly as if they arecapped with snow. The most famous case is the rim of the magnificent craterAristarchus, which William Herschel, the father of modem astronomy, onceobserved shining so brightly in the lunar night that he decided it must be anactive volcano. He was wrong; what he saw was the Earthlight reflected from athin and transient layer of frost, condensed during the three hundred hours offreezing darkness.The discovery of the great ice deposits beneath Schroter’s Valley, the sinuouscanyon winding away from Anstarchus, was the last factor in the equation thatwould transform the economics of space-flight. The Moon could provide a fillingstation just where it was needed, high up on the outermost slopes of the Earth’sgravitational field, at the beginning of the long haul to the planets.Cosmos, first of the Tsung fleet, had been designed to carry freight andpassengers on the Earth-Moon-Mars run, and as a test-vehicle, through complexdeals with a dozen organizations and governments, of the still experimental muondrive. Built at the Imbriurn shipyards, she had just sufficient thrust to liftoff from the Moon with zero payload; operating from orbit to orbit, she wouldnever again touch the surface of any world. With his usual flair for publicity,Sir Lawrence arranged for her maiden flight to commence on the hundredthanniversary of Sputnik Day, 4 October 2057.Two years later, Cosmos was joined by a sister ship. Galaxy was designed for theEarth-Jupiter run, and had enough thrust to operate directly to any of theJovian moons, though at considerable sacrifice of payload. If necessary, shecould even return to her lunar berth for refitting. She was by far the swiftestvehicle ever built by man: if she burned up her entire propellant mass in oneorgasm of acceleration, she would attain a speed of a thousand kilometres asecond - which would take her from Earth to Jupiter in a week, and to thenearest star in not much more than ten thousand years.The third ship of the fleet - and Sir Lawrence’s pride and joy - embodied allthat had been learned in the building of her two sisters. But Universe was notintended primarily for freight. She was designed from the beginning as the firstpassenger liner to cruise the space lanes - right out to Saturn, the jewel ofthe Solar System.Sir Lawrence had planned something even more spectacular for her maiden voyage,but construction delays caused by a dispute with the Lunar Chapter of theReformed Teamsters’ Union had upset his schedule. There would just be time forthe initial flight tests and Lloyd’s certification in the closing months of2060, before Universe left Earth orbit for her rendezvous. It would be a veryclose thing: Halley’s Comet would not wait, even for Sir Lawrence Tsung."},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREE9"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREEMOUNT ZEUSThe survey satellite Europa VI had been in orbit for almost fifteen years, andhad far exceeded its design life; whether it should be replaced was a subject ofconsiderable debate in the small Ganymede scientific establishment.It carried the usual collection of data-gathering instruments, as well as a nowvirtually useless imaging system. Though still in perfect working order, allthat this normally showed of Europa was an unbroken cloudscape. The overworkedscience team on Ganymede scanned the recordings in ‘Quick Look’ mode once aweek, then squirted the raw data back to Earth. On the whole, they would berather relieved when Europa VI expired and its torrent of uninterestinggigabytes finally dried up.Now, for the first time in years, it had produced something exciting.‘Orbit 71934,’ said the Deputy Chief Astronomer, who had called van der Berg assoon as the latest data-dump had been evaluated. ‘Coming in from the nightside -heading straight for Mount Zeus. You won’t see anything for another ten seconds,though.’The screen was completely black, yet van der Berg could imagine the frozenlandscape rolling past beneath its blanket of clouds a thousand kilometresbelow. In a few hours the distant Sun would be shining there, for Europarevolved on its axis once in every seven Earth-days. ‘Nightside’ should reallybe called ‘Twilight-side’, for half the time it had ample light - but no heat.Yet the inaccurate name had stuck, because it had emotional validity: Europaknew Sunrise, but never Lucifer-rise.And the Sunrise was coming now, speeded up a thousandfold by the racing probe. Afaintly luminous band bisected the screen, as the horizon emerged from darkness.The explosion of light was so sudden that van der Berg could almost imagine hewas looking into the glare of an atomic bomb. In a fraction of a second, it ranthrough all the colours of the rainbow, then became pure white as the Sun leaptabove the mountain - then vanished as the automatic filters cut into thecircuit.‘That’s all; pity there was no operator on duty at the time - he could havepanned the camera down and had a good view of the mountain as we went over. ButI knew you’d like to see it - even though it disproves your theory.’‘How?’ said van der Berg, more puzzled than annoyed.‘When you go through it in slow motion, you’ll see what I mean. Those beautifulrainbow effects - they’re not atmospheric - they’re caused by the mountainitself. Only ice could do that. Or glass - which doesn’t seem very likely.’‘Not impossible - volcanoes can produce natural glass - but it’s usually black…of course!’‘Yes?’‘Er - I won’t commit myself until I’ve been through the data. But my guess wouldbe rock crystal - transparent quartz. You can make beautiful prisms and lensesout of it. Any chance of some more observations?’‘I’m afraid not - that was pure luck - Sun, mountain, camera all lined up at theright time. It won’t happen again in a thousand years.’‘Thanks, anyway - can you send me over a copy? No hurry - I’m just leaving on afield trip to Perrine, and won’t be able to look at it until I get back.’Van der Berg gave a short, rather apologetic laugh.‘You know, if that really is rock crystal, it would be worth a fortune. Mighteven help solve our balance of payments problem…’But that, of course, was utter fantasy. Whatever wonders - or treasures - Europamight conceal, the human race had been forbidden access to them, by that lastmessage from Discovery. Fifty years later, there was no sign that theinterdiction would ever be lifted."},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREE10"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREESHIP OF FOOLSFor the first forty-eight hours of the voyage, Heywood Floyd could not reallybelieve the comfort, the spaciousness - the sheer extravagance of Universe’sliving arrangements. Yet most of his fellow passengers took them for granted;those who had never left Earth before assumed that all spaceships must be likethis.He had to look back at the history of aeronautics to put matters in the rightperspective. In his own lifetime, he had witnessed - indeed, experienced - therevolution that had occurred in the skies of the planet now dwindling behindhim. Between the clumsy old Leonov and the sophisticated Universe lay exactlyfifty years. (Emotionally, he couldn’t really believe that - but it was uselessarguing about arithmetic.)And just fifty years had separated the Wright Brothers from the first jetairliners. At the beginning of that half-century, intrepid aviators had hoppedfrom field to field, begoggled and windswept on open chairs; at its end,grandmothers had slumbered peacefully between continents at a thousandkilometres an hour.So he should not, perhaps, have been astonished at the luxury and elegant decorof his stateroom, or even the fact that he had a steward to keep it tidy. Thegenerously sized window was the most startling feature of his suite, and atfirst he felt quite uncomfortable thinking of the tons of air pressure it washolding in check against the implacable, and never for a moment relaxing, vacuumof space.The biggest surprise, even though the advance literature should have preparedhim for it, was the presence of gravity. Universe was the first spaceship everbuilt to cruise under continuous acceleration, except for the few hours of themid-course ‘turnaround’. When her huge propellant tanks were fully loaded withtheir five thousand tons of water, she could manage a tenth of a gee - not much,but enough to keep loose objects from drifting around. This was particularlyconvenient at mealtimes - though it took a few days for the passengers to learnnot to stir their soup too vigorously.Forty-eight hours out from Earth, the population of Universe had alreadystratified itself into four distinct classes.The aristocracy consisted of Captain Smith and his officers. Next came thepassengers; then crew - non-commissioned and stewards. And then steerage…That was the description that the five young space scientists had adopted forthemselves, first as a joke but later with a certain amount of bitterness. WhenHoyd compared their cramped and jury-rigged quarters with his own luxuriouscabin, he could see their point of view, and soon became the conduit of theircomplaints to the Captain.Yet all things considered, they had little to grumble about; in the rush to getthe ship ready, it had been touch and go as to whether there would be anyaccommodation for them and their equipment. Now they could look forward todeploying instruments around - and on - the comet during the critical daysbefore it rounded the Sun, and departed once more to the outer reaches of theSolar System. The members of the science team would establish their reputationson this voyage, and knew it. Only in moments of exhaustion, or fury withmisbehaving instrumentation, did they start complaining about the noisyventilating system, the claustrophobic cabins, and occasional strange smells ofunknown origin.But never the food, which everyone agreed was excellent. ‘Much better,’ CaptainSmith assured them, ‘than Darwin had on the Beagle.’To which Victor Willis had promptly retorted:‘How does he know? And by the way, Beagle’s commander cut his throat when he gotback to England.’That was rather typical of Victor, perhaps the planet’s best-known sciencecommunicator - to his fans - or ‘pop-scientist’ - to his equally numerousdetractors. It would be unfair to call them enemies; admiration for his talentswas universal, if occasionally grudging. His soft, mid-Pacific accent andexpansive gestures on camera were widely parodied, and he had been credited (orblamed) for the revival of full-length beards. ‘A man who grows that much hair,’critics were fond of saying, ‘must have a lot to hide.’He was certainly the most instantly recognizable of the six VIPs - though Floyd,who no longer regarded himself as a celebrity, always referred to themironically as ‘The Famous Five’. Yva Merlin could often walk unrecognized onPark Avenue, on the rare occasions when she emerged from her apartment. DimitriMihailovich, to his considerable annoyance, was a good ten centimetres belowaverage height; this might help to explain his fondness for thousand-pieceorchestras - real or synthesized -but did not enhance his public image.Clifford Greenburg and Margaret M’Bala also fell into the category of ‘famousunknowns’ - though this would certainly change when they got back to Earth. Thefirst man to land on Mercury had one of those pleasant, unremarkable faces thatare very hard to remember; moreover the days when he had dominated the news werenow thirty years in the past. And like most authors who are not addicted to talkshows and autographing sessions, Ms M’Bala would be unrecognized by the vastmajority of her millions of readers.Her literary fame had been one of the sensations of the forties. A scholarlystudy of the Greek pantheon was not usually a candidate for the best-sellerlists, but Ms M’Bala had placed its eternally inexhaustible myths in acontemporary space-age setting. Names which a century earlier had been familiaronly to astronomers and classical scholars were now part of every educatedperson’s world picture; almost every day there would be news from Ganymede,Callisto, Io, Titan, Japetus - or even more obscure worlds like Carme, Pasiphaë,Hyperion, Phoebe…Her book would have been no more than modestly successful, however, had she notfocused on the complicated family life of Jupiter-Zeus, Father of all the Gods(as well as much else). And by a stroke of luck, an editor of genius had changedher original title, The View from Olympus, to The Passions of the Gods. Enviousacademics usually referred to it as Olympic Lusts, but invariably wished theyhad written it.Not surprisingly, it was Maggie M - as she was quickly christened by her fellowpassengers - who first used the phrase Ship of Fools. Victor Willis adopted iteagerly, and soon discovered an intriguing historical resonance. Almost acentury ago, Katherine Anne Porter had herself sailed with a group of scientistsand writers aboard an ocean liner to watch the launch of Apollo 17, and the endof the first phase of lunar exploration.‘I’ll think about it,’ Ms M’Bala had remarked ominously, when this was reportedto her. ‘Perhaps it’s time for a third version. But I won’t know, of course,until we get back to Earth…’"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREE11"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREETHE LIEIt was many months before Rolf van der Berg could once again turn his thoughtsand energies towards Mount Zeus. The taming of Ganymede was a more thanfull-time job, and he was away from his main office at Dardanus Base for weeksat a time, surveying the route of the proposed Gilgamesh-Osiris monorail.The geography of the third and largest Galilean moon had changed drasticallysince the detonation of Jupiter - and it was still changing. The new sun thathad melted the ice of Europa was not as powerful here, four hundred thousandkilometres further out - but it was warm enough to produce a temperate climateat the centre of the face forever turned towards it. There were small, shallowseas - some as large as Earth’s Mediterranean - up to latitudes forty north andsouth. Not many features still survived from the maps generated by the Voyagermissions back in the twentieth century. Melting permafrost and occasionaltectonic movements triggered by the same tidal forces operating on the two innermoons made the new Ganymede a cartographer’s nightmare.But those very factors also made it a planetary engineer’s paradise. Here wasthe only world, except for the arid and much less hospitable Mars, on which menmight one day walk unprotected beneath an open sky. Ganymede had ample water,all the chemicals of life, and - at least while Lucifer shone - a warmer climatethan much of Earth.Best of all, full-body spacesuits were no longer necessary; the atmosphere,though still unbreathable, was just dense enough to permit the use of simpleface-masks and oxygen cylinders. In a few decades - so the microbiologistspromised, though they were hazy about specific dates - even these could bediscarded. Strains of oxygen-generating bacteria had already been let looseacross the face of Ganymede; most had died but some had flourished, and theslowly rising curve on the atmospheric analysis chart was the first exhibitproudly displayed to all visitors at Dardanus.For a long time, van der Berg kept a watchful eye on the data flowing in fromEuropa VI, hoping that one day the clouds would clear again when it was orbitingabove Mount Zeus. He knew that the odds were against it, but while the slightestchance existed he made no effort to explore any other avenue of research. Therewas no hurry, he had far more important work on his hands - and anyway, theexplanation might turn out to be something quite trivial and uninteresting.Then Europa VI suddenly expired, almost certainly as a result of a randommeteoric impact. Back on Earth, Victor Willis had made rather a fool of himself- in the opinion of many - by interviewing the ‘Euronuts’ who now more thanadequately filled the gap left by the UFO-enthusiasts of the previous century.Some of them argued that the probe’s demise was due to hostile action from theworld below: the fact that it had been allowed to operate without interferencefor fifteen years - almost twice its design life - did not bother them in theleast. To Victor’s credit, he stressed this point and demolished most of thecultists’ other arguments; but the consensus was that he should never have giventhem publicity in the first place.To van der Berg, who quite relished his colleagues’ description of him as a’stubborn Dutchman’ and did his best to live up to it, the failure of Europa VIwas a challenge not to be resisted. There was not the slightest hope of fundinga replacement, for the silencing of the garrulous and embarrassingly long-livedprobe had been received with considerable relief.So what was the alternative? Van der Berg sat down to consider his options.Because he was a geologist, and not an astrophysicist, it was several daysbefore he suddenly realized that the answer had been staring him in the faceever since he had landed on Ganymede.Afrikaans is one of the world’s best languages in which to curse; even whenspoken politely, it can bruise innocent bystanders. Van der Berg let off steamfor a few minutes; then he put through a call to the Tiamat Observatory -sitting precisely on the equator, with the tiny, blinding disc of Luciferforever vertically overhead.Astrophysicists, concerned with the most spectacular objects in the Universe,tend to patronize mere geologists who devote their lives to small, messy thingslike planets. But out here on the frontier, everyone helped everyone else, andDr Wilkins was not only interested but sympathetic.The Tiamat Observatory had been built for a single purpose, which had indeedbeen one of the main reasons for establishing a base on Ganymede. The study ofLucifer was of enormous importance not only to pure scientists but also tonuclear engineers, meteorologists, oceanographers - and, not least, to statesmenand philosophers. That there were entities which could turn a planet into a sunwas a staggering thought, and had kept many awake at night. It would be well formankind to learn all it could about the process; one day there might be need toimitate it - or prevent it.And so for more than a decade Tiamat had been observing Lucifer with everypossible type of instrumentation, continually recording its spectrum across theentire electromagnetic band, and also actively probing it with radar from amodest hundred-metre dish, slung across a small impact crater.‘Yes,’ said Dr Wilkins, ‘we’ve often looked at Europa and Io. But our beam isfixed on Lucifer, so we can only see them for a few minutes while they’re intransit. And your Mount Zeus is just on the dayside, so it’s hidden from usthen.’‘I realize that,’ said van der Berg a little impatiently. ‘But couldn’t youoffset the beam by just a little, so you could have a look at Europa before itcomes in line? Ten or twenty degrees would get you far enough into dayside.’‘One degree would be enough to miss Lucifer, and get Europa full-face on theother side of its orbit. But then it would be more than three times furtheraway, so we’d only have a hundredth of the reflected power. Might work, though:we’ll give it a try. Let me have the specs on frequencies, wave envelopes,polarization and anything else your remote-sensing people think will help. Itwon’t take us long to rig up a phase-shifting network that will slew the beam acouple of degrees. More than that I don’t know - it’s not a problem we’ve everconsidered. Though perhaps we should have done so - anyway, what do you expectto find on Europa, except ice and water?’‘If I knew,’ said van der Berg cheerfully, ‘I wouldn’t be asking for help, wouldI?’‘And I wouldn’t be asking for full credit when you publish. Too bad my name’s atthe end of the alphabet; you’ll be ahead of me by only one letter.’That was a year ago: the long-range scans hadn’t been good enough, andoffsetting the beam to look on to Europa’s dayside just before conjunction hadproved more difficult than expected. But at last the results were in; thecomputers had digested them, and van der Berg was the first human being to lookat a mineralogical map of post-Lucifer Europa.It was, as Dr Wilkins had surmised, mostly ice and water, with outcroppings ofbasalt interspersed with deposits of sulphur. But there were two anomalies.One appeared to be an artefact of the imaging process; there was an absolutelystraight feature, two kilometres long, which showed virtually no radar echo. Vander Berg left Dr Wilkins to puzzle over that; he was only concerned with MountZeus.It had taken him a long time to make the identification, because only a madman -or a really desperate scientist - would have dreamed that such a thing waspossible. Even now, though every parameter checked to the limits of accuracy, hestill could not really believe it. And he had not even attempted to consider hisnext move.When Dr Wilkins called, anxious to see his name and reputation spreading throughthe data banks, he mumbled that he was still analysing the results. But at lasthe could put it off no longer.‘Nothing very exciting,’ he told his unsuspecting colleague. ‘Merely a rare formof quartz - I’m still trying to match it from Earth samples.’It was the first time he had ever lied to a fellow scientist, and he feltterrible about it.But what was the alternative?"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREE12"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREEOOM PAULRolf van der Berg had not seen his Uncle Paul for a decade, and it was notlikely that they would ever again meet in the flesh. Yet he felt very close tothe old scientist - the last of his generation, and the only one who couldrecall (when he wished, which was seldom) his forefathers’ way of life.Dr Paul Kreuger - ‘Oom Paul’ to all his family and most of his friends - wasalways there when he was needed, with information and advice, either in personor at the end of a half-billion-kilometre radio link. Rumour had it that onlyextreme political pressure had forced the Nobel Committee - with greatreluctance - to overlook his contributions to particle physics, now once more indesperate disarray after the general house-cleaning at the end of the twentiethcentury.If this was true, Dr Kreuger bore no grudge. Modest and unassuming, he had nopersonal enemies, even among the cantankerous factions of his fellow exiles.Indeed, he was so universally respected that he had received several invitationsto re-visit the United States of Southern Africa, but had always politelydeclined - not, he hastened to explain, because he felt he would be in anyphysical danger in the USSA, but because he feared that the sense of nostalgiawould be overwhelming.Even using the security of a language now understood by less than a millionpeople, van der Berg had been very discreet, and had used circumlocutions andreferences that would be meaningless except to a close relative. But Paul had nodifficulty in understanding his nephew’s message, though he could not take itseriously. He was afraid young Rolf had made a fool of himself, and would lethim down as gently as possible. Just as well he hadn’t rushed to publish: atleast he had the sense to keep quiet…And suppose - just suppose - it was true? The scanty hairs rose on the back ofPaul’s head. A whole spectrum of possibilities - scientific, financial,political - suddenly opened up before his eyes, and the more he considered them,the more awesome they appeared.Unlike his devout ancestors, Dr Kreuger had no God to address in moments ofcrisis or perplexity. Now, he almost wished he had; but even if he could pray,that wouldn’t really help. As he sat down at his computer and started to accessthe data banks, he did not know whether to hope that his nephew had made astupendous discovery - or was talking utter nonsense. Could the Old One reallyplay such an incredible trick on mankind? Paul remembered Einstein’s famouscomment that though He was subtle, He was never malicious.Stop daydreaming, Dr Paul Kreuger told himself.

His announcement was received, as he had expected, with stunnedincredulity.Victor Willis was the first to recover.‘A swimming pool! In a spaceship! You must be joking!’The Captain leaned back and prepared to enjoy himself. He grinned at HeywoodFloyd who had already been let into the secret.‘Well, I suppose Columbus would have been amazed at some of the facilities onthe ships that came after him.’‘Is there a diving board?’ asked Greenburg wistfully. ‘I used to be collegechampion.’‘As a matter of fact - yes. It’s only five metres - but that will give you threeseconds of free fall, at our nominal tenth of a gee. And if you want a longertime, I’m sure Mr Curtis will be happy to reduce thrust.’‘Indeed?’ said the Chief Engineer dryly. ‘And mess up all my orbit calculations?Not to mention the risk of the water crawling out, Surface tension, you know…‘Wasn’t there a space station once that had a spherical swimming pool?’ somebodyasked.‘They tried it at the hub of Pasteur, before they started the spin,’ answeredFloyd. ‘It just wasn’t practical. In zero gravity, it had to be completelyenclosed. And you could drown rather easily inside a big sphere of water, if youpanicked.’‘One way of getting into the record books - first person to drown in space…’‘No-one told us to bring swimsuits,’ complained Maggie M’Bala.‘Anyone who has to wear a swimsuit probably should,’ Mihailovich whispered toFloyd.Captain Smith rapped on the table to restore order. ‘This is more important,please. As you know, at midnight we reach maximum speed, and have to startbraking. So the drive will shut down at 23.00, and the ship will be reversed.We’ll have two hours of weightlessness before we commence thrust again at 01.00.‘As you can imagine, the crew will be rather busy - we’ll use the opportunityfor an engine check and a hull inspection, which can’t be done while we’re underpower. I strongly advise you to be sleeping then, with the restraint strapslightly fastened across your beds. The stewards will check that there aren’t anyloose articles that could cause trouble when weight comes on again. Questions?’There was a profound silence, as if the assembled passengers were still somewhatstunned by the revelation and were deciding what to do about it.‘I was hoping you’d ask me about the economics of such a luxury - but as youhaven’t, I’ll tell you anyway. It’s not a luxury at all - it doesn’t cost athing, but we hope it will be a very valuable asset on future voyages.‘You see, we have to carry five thousand tons of water as reaction mass, so wemight as well make the best use of it. Number One tank is now three-quartersempty; we’ll keep it that way until the end of the voyage. So after breakfasttomorrow - see you down at the beach…Considering the rush to get Universe spaceborne, it was surprising that such agood job had been done on something so spectacularly non-essential.The ‘beach’ was a metal platform, about five metres wide, curving around a thirdof the great tank’s circumference. Although the far wall was only another twentymetres away, clever use of projected images made it seem at infinity. Borne onthe waves in the middle distance, surfers were heading towards a shore whichthey would never reach, Beyond them, a beautiful passenger clipper which anytravel agent would recognize instantly as Tsung Sea-Space Corporation’s Tai-Panwas racing along the horizon under a full spread of sail.To complete the illusion, there was sand underfoot (slightly magnetized, so itwould not stray too far from its appointed place) and the short length of beachended in a grove of palm trees which were quite convincing, until examined tooclosely. Overhead, a hot tropical sun completed the idyllic picture; it was hardto realize that just beyond these walls the real Sun was shining, now twice asfiercely as on any terrestrial beach.The designer had really done a wonderful job, in the limited space available. Itseemed a little unfair of Greenburg to complain: ‘Pity there’s no surf…’"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREE14"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREESEARCHIt is a good principle in science not to believe any ‘fact’ - howeverwell-attested - until it fits into some accepted frame of reference.Occasionally, of course, an observation can shatter the frame and force theconstruction of a new one, but that is extremely rare. Galileos and Einsteinsseldom appear more than once per century, which is just as well for theequanimity of mankind.Dr Kreuger fully accepted this principle: he would not believe his nephew’sdiscovery until he could explain it, and as far as he could see that requirednothing less than a direct Act of God. Wielding Occam’s still highly serviceablerazor, he thought it somewhat more probable that Rolf had made a mistake; if so,it should be fairly easy to find it.To Uncle Paul’s great surprise, it proved very difficult indeed. The analysis ofradar remote-sensing observations was now a venerable and well-established art,and the experts that Paul consulted all gave the same answer, after considerabledelay. They also asked: ‘Where did you get that recording?’‘Sorry,’ he had answered. ‘I’m not at liberty to say.’The next step was to assume that the impossible was correct, and to startsearching the literature. This could be an enormous job, for he did not evenknow where to begin. One thing was quite certain: a brute-force, head-on attackwas bound to fail. It would be just as if Roentgen, the morning after he haddiscovered X-rays, had started to hunt for their explanation in the physicsjournals of his day. The information he needed still lay years in the future.But there was at least a sporting chance that what he was looking for was hiddensomewhere in the immense body of existing scientific knowledge. Slowly andcarefully, Paul Kreuger set up an automatic search programme, designed for whatit would exclude as much as what it would embrace. It should cut out allEarth-related references - they would certainly number in the millions - andconcentrate entirely on extraterrestrial citations.One of the benefits of Dr Kreuger’s eminence was an unlimited computer budget:that was part of the fee he demanded from the various organizations who neededhis wisdom. Though this search might be expensive, he did not have to worryabout the bill.As it turned out, this was surprisingly small. He was lucky: the search came toan end after only two hours thirty-seven minutes, at the 21,456th reference.The title was enough. Paul was so excited that his own comsec refused torecognize his voice, and he had to repeat the command for a full print-out.Nature had published the paper in 1981 - almost five years before he was born! -and as his eyes swept swiftly over its single page he knew not only that hisnephew had been right all along - but, just as important, exactly how such amiracle could occur.The editor of that eighty-year-old journal must have had a good sense of humour.A paper discussing the cores of the outer planets was not something to grab theusual reader: this one, however, had an unusually striking title. His comseccould have told him quickly enough that it had once been part of a famous song,but that of course was quite irrelevant.Anyway, Paul Kreuger had never heard of the Beatles, and their psychedelicfantasies."},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREEIITHE VALLEY OF THE BLACK SNOW"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREE15"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREERENDEZVOUSAnd now Halley was too close to be seen; ironically, observers back on Earthwould get a far better view of the tail, already stretching fifty millionkilometres at right angles to the comet’s orbit, like a pennant fluttering inthe invisible gale of the solar wind.On the morning of the rendezvous, Heywood Floyd woke early from a troubledsleep. It was unusual for him to dream - or at least to remember his dreams -and doubtless the anticipated excitements of the next few hours wereresponsible. He was also slightly worried by a message from Caroline, asking ifhe had heard from Chris lately. He had radioed back, a little tersely, thatChris had never bothered to say thank you when he had helped him get his currentposition on Universe’s sister ship Cosmos; perhaps he was already bored with theEarth-Moon run and was looking for excitement elsewhere.‘As usual,’ Floyd had added, ‘we’ll hear from him in his own good time.’Immediately after breakfast, passengers and science team had gathered for afinal briefing from Captain Smith. The scientists certainly did not need it, butif they felt any irritation, so childish an emotion would have been quicklyswept away by the weird spectacle on the main viewscreen.It was easier to imagine that Universe was flying into a nebula, rather than acomet. The entire sky ahead was now a misty white fog - not uniform, but mottledwith darker condensations and streaked with luminous bands and brightly glowingjets, all radiating away from a central point. At this magnification, thenucleus was barely visible as a tiny black speck, yet it was clearly the sourceof all the phenomena around it.‘We cut our drive in three hours,’ said the Captain. ‘Then we’ll be only athousand kilometres away from the nucleus, with virtually zero velocity. We’llmake some final observations, and confirm our landing site.’‘So we’ll go weightless at 12.00 exactly. Before then, your cabin stewards willcheck that everything’s correctly stowed. It will be just like turnaround,except that this time it’s going to be three days, not two hours, before we haveweight again.‘Halley’s gravity? Forget it - less than one centimetre per second squared -just about a thousandth of Earth’s. You’ll be able to detect it if you wait longenough, but that’s all. Takes fifteen seconds for something to fall a metre.‘For safety, I’d like you all here in the observation lounge, with your seatbelts properly secured, during rendezvous and touchdown. You’ll get the bestview from here anyway, and the whole operation won’t take more than an hour.We’ll only be using very small thrust corrections, but they may come from anyangle and could cause minor sensory disturbances.’What the Captain meant, of course, was spacesickness - but that word, by generalagreement, was taboo aboard Universe. It was noticeable, however, that manyhands strayed into the compartments beneath the seats, as if checking that thenotorious plastic bags would be available if urgently required.The image on the viewscreen expanded, as the magnification was increased. For amoment it seemed to Floyd that he was in an aeroplane, descending through lightclouds, rather than in a spacecraft approaching the most famous of all comets.The nucleus was growing larger and clearer; it was no longer a black dot, but anirregular ellipse - now a small, pockmarked island lost in the cosmic ocean -then, suddenly, a world in its own right.There was still no sense of scale. Although Floyd knew that the whole panoramaspread before him was less than ten kilometres across, he could easily haveimagined that he was looking at a body as large as the Moon. But the Moon wasnot hazy around the edges, nor did it have little jets of vapour - and two largeones - spurting from its surface.‘My God!’ cried Mihailovich, ‘what’s that?’He pointed to the lower edge of the nucleus, just inside the terminator.Unmistakably - impossibly -a light was flashing there on the nightside of thecomet with a perfectly regular rhythm: on, off, on, off, once every two or threeseconds.Dr Willis gave his patient ‘I can explain it to you in words of one syllable’cough, but Captain Smith got there first.‘I’m sorry to disappoint you, Mr Mihailovich. That’s only the beacon on SamplerProbe Two - it’s been sitting there for a month, waiting for us to come and pickit up.’‘What a shame; I thought there might be someone - something - there to welcomeus.’‘No such luck, I’m afraid; we’re very much on our own out here. That beacon isjust where we intend to land - it’s near Halley’s south pole and is in permanentdarkness at the moment. That will make it easier on our life-support systems.The temperature’s up to 120 degrees on the Sunlit side - way above boilingpoint.’‘No wonder the comet’s perking,’ said the unabashed Dimitri. ‘Those jets don’tlook very healthy to me. Are you sure it’s safe to go in?’‘That’s another reason we’re touching down on the nightside; there’s no activitythere. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I must get back to the bridge. This is thefirst chance I’ve ever had of landing on a new world - and I doubt if I’ll getanother.’Captain Smith’s audience dispersed slowly, and in unusual silence. The image onthe viewscreen zoomed back to normal, and the nucleus dwindled once more to abarely visible spot. Yet even in those few minutes it seemed to have grownslightly larger, and perhaps that was no illusion. Less than four hours beforeencounter, the ship was still hurtling towards the comet at fifty thousandkilometres an hour.It would make a crater more impressive than any that Halley now boasted, ifsomething happened to the main drive at this stage of the game."},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREE16"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREETOUCHDOWNThe landing was just as anticlimactic as Captain Smith had hoped. It wasimpossible to tell the moment when Universe made contact; a full minute elapsedbefore the passengers realized that touchdown was complete, and raised a belatedcheer.The ship lay at one end of a shallow valley, surrounded by hills little morethan a hundred metres high. Anyone who had been expecting to see a lunarlandscape would have been greatly surprised; these formations bore noresemblance at all to the smooth, gentle slopes of the Moon, sand-blasted bymicrometeorite bombardment over billions of years.There was nothing here more than a thousand years old; the Pyramids were farmore ancient than this landscape. Every time around the Sun, Halley wasremoulded - and diminished - by the solar fires. Even since the 1986 perihelionpassage, the shape of the nucleus had been subtly changed. Melding metaphorsshamelessly, Victor Willis had nevertheless put it rather well when he told hisviewers: ‘The “peanut” has become wasp-waisted!’Indeed, there were indications that, after a few more revolutions round the Sun,Halley might split into two roughly equal fragments - as had Biela’s comet, tothe amazement of the astronomers of 1846.The virtually non-existent gravity also contributed to the strangeness of thelandscape. All around were spidery formations like the fantasies of asurrealistic artist, and improbably canted rockpiles that could not havesurvived more than a few minutes even on the Moon.Although Captain Smith had chosen to land Universe in the depths of the polarnight - all of five kilometres from the blistering heat of the Sun - there wasample illumination. The huge envelope of gas and dust surrounding the cometformed a glowing halo which seemed appropriate for this region; it was easy toimagine that it was an aurora, playing over the Antarctic ice. And if that wasnot sufficient, Lucifer provided its quota of several hundred full moons.Although expected, the complete absence of colour was a disappointment; Universemight have been sitting in an opencast coal mine: that, in fact, was not a badanalogy, for much of the surrounding blackness was due to carbon or itscompounds, intimately mixed with snow and ice.Captain Smith, as was his due, was the first to leave the ship, pushing himselfgently out from Universe’s main airlock. It seemed an eternity before he reachedthe ground, two metres below; then he picked up a handful of the powderysurface, and examined it in his gloved hand.Aboard the ship, everyone waited for the words that would go into the historybooks.‘Looks like pepper and salt,’ said the Captain. ‘If it were thawed out, it mightgrow a pretty good crop.’* * *The mission plan involved one complete Halley ‘day’ of fifty-five hours at thesouth pole, then - if there were no problems - a move of ten kilometres towardsthe very ill-defined equator, to study one of the geysers during a completeday-night cycle.Chief Scientist Pendrill wasted no time. Almost immediately, he set off with acolleague on a two-man jet-sled towards the beacon of the waiting probe. Theywere back within the hour, bearing prepackaged samples of comet which theyproudly consigned to the deep-freeze.Meanwhile the other teams established a spider’s web of cables along the valley,strung between poles driven into the friable crust. These served not only tolink numerous instruments to the ship, but also made movement outside mucheasier. One could explore this portion of Halley without the use of cumbersomeExternal Manoeuvring Units; it was only necessary to attach a tether to a cable,and then go along it hand over hand. That was also much more fun than operatingEMUs, which were virtually one-man spaceships with all the complications theyinvolved.The passengers watched all this with fascination, listening to the radioedconversations and trying to join in the excitement of discovery. After abouttwelve hours - considerably less in the case of ex-astronaut Clifford Greenburg- the pleasure of being a captive audience started to pall. Soon there was muchtalk about ‘going outside’ except from Victor Willis who was quiteuncharacteristically subdued.‘I think he’s scared,’ said Dimitri contemptuously. He had never liked Victor,since discovering that the scientist was completely tone-deaf. Though this waswildly unfair to Victor (who had gamely allowed himself to be used as a guineapig for studies of his curious affliction) Dimitri was fond of adding darkly ‘Aman that hath no music in himself, Is fit for treasons, stratagems and spoils.’Floyd had made up his mind even before leaving Earth orbit. Maggie M was gameenough to try anything and would need no encouragement. (Her slogan ‘An authorshould never turn down the opportunity for a new experience’ had impactedfamously on her emotional life.)Yva Merlin, as usual, had kept everyone in suspense, but Floyd was determined totake her on a personal tour of the comet. It was the very least he could do tomaintain his reputation; everyone knew that he had been partly responsible forgetting the fabulous recluse on the passenger list, and now it was a runningjoke that they were having an affair. Their most innocent remarks were gleefullymisinterpreted by Dimitri and the ship’s physician Dr Mahindran, who professedto regard them with envious awe.After some initial annoyance - because it all too accurately recalled theemotions of his youth - Floyd had gone along with the joke. But he did not knowhow Yva felt about it, and had so far lacked the courage to ask her. Even now,in this compact little society where few secrets lasted more than six hours, shemaintained much of her famous reserve - that aura of mystery which hadfascinated audiences for three generations.As for Victor Willis, he had just discovered one of those devastating littledetails that can destroy the best-laid plans of mice and spacemen.Universe was equipped with the latest Mark XX suits, with non-fogging,non-reflective visors guaranteed to give an unparalleled view of space. Andthough the helmets came in several sizes, Victor Willis could not get into anyof them without major surgery.It had taken him fifteen years to perfect his trademark (’a triumph of thetopiary art,’ one critic had called it, perhaps admiringly).Now only his beard stood between Victor Willis and Halley’s Comet. Soon he wouldhave to make a choice between the two."},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREE17"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREETHE VALLEY OF BLACK SNOWCaptain Smith had raised surprisingly few objections to the idea of passengerEVAs. He agreed that to have come all this way, and not to set foot upon thecomet, was absurd.‘There’ll be no problems if you follow instructions,’ he said at the inevitablebriefing. ‘Even if you’ve never worn spacesuits before - and I believe that onlyCommander Greenburg and Dr Floyd have done so - they’re quite comfortable, andfully automatic. There’s no need to bother about any controls or adjustments,after you’ve been checked out in the airlock.‘One absolute rule: only two of you can go EVA at one time. You’ll have apersonal escort, of course, linked to you by five metres of safety line - thoughthat can be played out to twenty if necessary. In addition, you’ll both betethered to the two guide-cables we’ve strung the whole length of the valley.The rule of the road is the same as on Earth; keep to the right! If you want toovertake anyone, you only have to unclip your buckle - but one of you mustalways remain attached to the line. That way, there’s no danger of drifting offinto space. Any questions?’‘How long can we stay out?’‘As long as you like, Ms M’Bala. But I recommend that you return just as soon asyou feel the slightest discomfort. Perhaps an hour would be best for the firstouting - though it may seem like only ten minutes…’Captain Smith had been quite correct. As Heywood Floyd looked at histime-elapsed display, it seemed incredible that forty minutes had alreadypassed. Yet it should not have been so surprising, for the ship was already agood kilometre away.As the senior passenger - by almost any reckoning - he had been given theprivilege of making the first EVA. And he really had no choice of companion.‘EVA with Yva!’ chortled Mihailovich. ‘How can you possibly resist! Even if,’ headded with a lewd grin, ‘those damn suits won’t let you try all theExtravehicular Activities you’d like,’Yva had agreed, without any hesitation, yet also without any enthusiasm. That,Floyd thought wryly, was typical. It would not be quite true to say that he wasdisillusioned - at his age, he had very few illusions left - but he wasdisappointed. And with himself rather than Yva; she was as beyond criticism orpraise as the Mona Lisa - with whom she had often been compared.The comparison was, of course, ridiculous; La Gioconda was mysterious, but shewas certainly not erotic. Yva’s power had lain in her unique combination of both- with innocence thrown in for good measure. Half a century later, traces of allthree ingredients were still visible, at least to the eye of faith.What was lacking - as Floyd had been sadly forced to admit - was any realpersonality. When he tried to focus his mind upon her, all he could visualizewere the roles she had played. He would have reluctantly agreed with the criticwho had once said:‘Yva Merlin is the reflection of all men’s desires; but a mirror has nocharacter.’And now this unique and mysterious creature was floating beside him across theface of Halley’s Comet, as they and their guide moved along the twin cables thatspanned the Valley of Black Snow. That was his name; he was childishly proud ofit, even though it would never appear on any map. There could be no maps of aworld where geography was as ephemeral as weather on Earth. He savoured theknowledge that no human eye had ever before looked upon the scene around him -or ever would again.On Mars, or on the Moon, you could sometimes -with a slight effort ofimagination, and if you ignored the alien sky - pretend that you were on Earth.This was impossible here, because the towering - often overhanging - snowsculptures showed only the slightest concession to gravity. You had to look verycarefully at your surroundings to decide which way was up.The Valley of Black Snow was unusual, because it was a fairly solid structure -a rocky reef embedded in volatile drifts of water and hydrocarbon ice. Thegeologists were still arguing about its origin, some maintaining that it wasreally part of an asteroid that had encountered the comet ages ago. Corings hadrevealed complex mixtures of organic compounds, rather like frozen coal-tar -though it was certain that life had never played any part in their formation.The ’snow’ carpeting of the floor of the little valley was not completely black;when Floyd raked it with the beam of his flashlight it glittered and sparkled asif embedded with a million microscopic diamonds. He wondered if there wereindeed diamonds on Halley: there was certainly enough carbon here. But it wasalmost equally certain that the temperatures and pressures necessary to createthem had never existed here.On a sudden impulse, Floyd reached down and gathered two handfuls of the snow:he had to push with his feet against the safety line to do so, and had a comicvision of himself as a trapeze artist walking a tightrope - but upside down. Thefragile crust offered virtually no resistance as he buried head and shouldersinto it; then he pulled gently on his tether and emerged with his handful ofHalley.He wished that he could feel it through the insulation of his gloves, as hecompacted the mass of crystalline fluff into a ball that just fitted the palm ofhis hand. There it lay, ebony black yet giving fugitive flashes of light as heturned it from side to side.And suddenly, in his imagination, it became the purest white - and he was a boyagain, in the winter playground of his youth, surrounded with the ghosts of hischildhood. He could even hear the cries of his companions, taunting andthreatening him with their own projectiles of immaculate snow…The memory was brief, but shattering, for it brought an overwhelming sensationof sadness. Across a century of time, he could no longer remember a single oneof those phantom friends who stood around him; yet some, he knew, he had onceloved…His eyes filled with tears, and his fingers clenched around the ball of aliensnow. Then the vision faded; he was himself again. This was not a moment ofsadness, but of triumph.‘My God!’ cried Heywood Floyd, his words echoing in the tiny, reverberantuniverse of his spacesuit, ‘I’m standing on Halley’s Comet - what more do Iwant! If a meteor hits me now, I won’t have a single complaint!’He brought up his arms and launched the snowball towards the stars. It was sosmall, and so dark, that it vanished almost at once, but he kept on staring intothe sky.And then, abruptly - unexpectedly - it appeared in a sudden explosion of light,as it rose into the rays of the hidden Sun. Black as soot though it was, itreflected enough of that blinding brilliance to be easily visible against thefaintly luminous sky.Floyd watched it until it finally disappeared - perhaps by evaporation, perhapsby dwindling into the distance. It would not last long in the fierce torrent ofradiation overhead; but how many men could claim to have created a comet oftheir own?"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREE18"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREE‘OLD FAITHFUL’The cautious exploration of the comet had already begun while Universe stillremained in the polar shadow. First, one-man EMUs (few people now knew thatstood for External Manoeuvring Unit) gently jetted over both day- and nightside,recording everything of interest. Once the preliminary surveys had beencompleted, groups of up to five scientists flew out in the onboard shuttle,deploying equipment and instruments at strategic spots.The Lady Jasmine was a far cry from the primitive ’space pods’ of the Discoveryera, capable of operating only in a gravity-free environment. She was virtuallya small spaceship, designed to ferry personnel and light cargo between theorbiting Universe and the surfaces of Mars, Moon, or the Jovian satellites. Herchief pilot, who treated her like the grande dame she was, complained with mockbitterness that flying round a miserable little comet was far beneath herdignity.When he was quite sure that Halley - on the surface at least - held nosurprises, Captain Smith lifted away from the pole. Moving less than a dozenkilometres took Universe to a different world, from a glimmering twilight thatwould last for months to a realm that knew the cycle of night and day. And withthe dawn, the comet came slowly to life.As the Sun crept above the jagged, absurdly close horizon, its rays would slantdown into the countless small craters that pockmarked the crust. Most of themwould remain inactive, their narrow throats sealed by incrustations of mineralsalts. Nowhere else on Halley were such vivid displays of colour; they hadmisled biologists into thinking that here life was beginning, as it had onEarth, in the form of algal growths. Many had not yet abandoned that hope,though they would be reluctant to admit it.From other craters, wisps of vapour floated up into the sky, moving inunnaturally straight trajectories because there were no winds to divert them.Usually nothing else happened for an hour or two; then, as the Sun’s warmthpenetrated to the frozen interior, Halley would begin to spurt - as VictorWillis had put it ‘like a pod of whales’.Though picturesque, it was not one of his more accurate metaphors. The jets fromthe dayside of Halley were not intermittent, but played steadily for hours at atime. And they did not curl over and fall back to the surface, but went risingon up into the sky, until they were lost in the glowing fog which they helpedcreate.At first, the science team treated the geysers as cautiously as if they werevulcanologists approaching Etna or Vesuvius in one of their less predictablemoods. But they soon discovered that Halley’s eruptions, though often fearsomein appearance, were singularly gentle and well-behaved; the water emerged aboutas fast as from an ordinary firehose, and was barely warm. Within seconds ofescaping from its underground reservoir, it would flash into a mixture of vapourand ice crystals; Halley was enveloped in a perpetual snowstorm, fallingupwards… Even at this modest speed of ejection, none of the water would everreturn to its source. Each time it rounded the Sun, more of the comet’slife-blood would haemorrhage into the insatiable vacuum of space.After considerable persuasion, Captain Smith agreed to move Universe to within ahundred metres of ‘Old Faithful’, the largest geyser on the dayside. It was anawesome sight - a whitish-grey column of mist, growing like some giant tree froma surprisingly small orifice in a three-hundred-metre-wide crater which appearedto be one of the oldest formations on the comet. Before long, the scientistswere scrambling all over the crater, collecting specimens of its (completelysterile, alas) multi-coloured minerals, and casually thrusting theirthermometers and sampling tubes into the soaring water-ice-mist column itself.‘If it tosses any of you out into space,’ warned the Captain, ‘don’t expect tobe rescued in a hurry. In fact, we may just wait until you come back.’‘What does he mean by that?’ a puzzled Dimitri Mihailovich had asked. As usual,Victor Willis was quick with the answer.‘Things don’t always happen the way you’d expect in celestial mechanics.Anything thrown off Halley at a reasonable speed will still be moving inessentially the same orbit - it takes a huge velocity change to make a bigdifferenc. So one revolution later, the two orbits will intersect again - andyou’ll be right back where you started. Seventy-six years older, of course.’Not far from Old Faithful was another phenomenon which no-one could reasonablyhave anticipated. When they first observed it, the scientists could scarcelybelieve their eyes. Spread out across several hectares of Halley, exposed to thevacuum of space, was what appeared to be a perfectly ordinary lake, remarkableonly for its extreme blackness.Obviously, it could not be water; the only liquids which could be stable in thisenvironment were heavy organic oils or tars. In fact, ‘Lake Tuonela’ turned outto be more like pitch, quite solid except for a sticky surface layer less than amillimetre thick. In this negligible gravity, it must have taken years - perhapsseveral trips round the warming fires of the Sun - for it to have assumed itspresent mirror-flatness.Until the Captain put a stop to it, the lake became one of the principal touristattractions on Halley’s Comet. Someone (nobody claimed the dubious honour)discovered that it was possible to walk perfectly normally across it, almost asif on Earth; the surface film had just enough adhesion to hold the foot inplace. Before long, most of the crew had got themselves videoed apparentlywalking on water…Then Captain Smith inspected the airlock, discovered the walls liberally stainedwith tar, and gave the nearest thing to a display of anger that anyone had everwitnessed from him.‘It’s bad enough,’ he said through clenched teeth, ‘having the outside of theship coated with - soot. Halley’s Comet is about the filthiest place I’ve everseen…’After that, there were no more strolls on Lake Tuonela."},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREE19"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREEAT THE END OF THE TUNNELIn a small, self-contained universe where everyone knows everyone else, therecan be no greater shock than encountering a total stranger.Heywood Floyd was floating gently along the corridor to the main lounge when hehad this disturbing experience. He stared in amazement at the interloper,wondering how a stowaway had managed to avoid detection for so long. The otherman looked back at him with a combination of embarrassment and bravado,obviously waiting for Floyd to speak first.‘Well, Victor!’ he said at last. ‘Sorry I didn’t recognize you. So you’ve madethe supreme sacrifice, for the cause of science - or should I say your public?’‘Yes,’ Willis answered grumpily. ‘I did manage to squeeze into one helmet - butthe damn bristles made so many scratching noises no-one could hear a word Isaid.’‘When are you going out?’‘Just as soon as Cliff comes back - he’s gone caving with Bill Chant.’The first flybys of the comet, in 1986, had suggested that it was considerablyless dense than water -which could only mean that it was either made of veryporous material, or was riddled with cavities. Both explanations turned out tobe correct.At first, the ever-cautious Captain Smith flatly forbade any cave-exploring. Hefinally relented when Dr Pendrill reminded him that his chief assistant Dr Chantwas an experienced speleologist - indeed, that was one of the very reasons hehad been chosen for the mission.‘Cave-ins are impossible, in this low gravity,’ Pendrill had told the reluctantCaptain. ‘So there’s no danger of being trapped.’‘What about being lost?’‘Chant would regard that suggestion as a professional insult. He’s been twentykilometres inside Mammoth Cave. Anyway, he’ll play out a guideline.’‘Communications?’‘The line’s got fibre optics in it. And his suit radio will probably work mostof the way.’‘Umm. Where does he want to go in?’‘The best place is that extinct geyser at the base of Etna Junior. It’s beendead for at least a thousand years.’‘So I suppose it should keep quiet for another couple of days. Very well - doesanyone else want to go?’‘Cliff Greenburg has volunteered - he’s done a good deal of underwatercave-exploring, in the Bahamas.’‘I tried it once - that was enough. Tell Cliff he’s much too valuable. He can goin as far as he can still see the entrance - and no further. And if he losescontact with Chant, he’s not to go after him, without my authority.’Which, the Captain added to himself, I would be very reluctant to give…Dr Chant knew all the old jokes about speleologists wanting to return to thewomb, and was quite sure he could refute them.‘That must be a damn noisy place, with all its thumpings and bumpings andgurglings,’ he argued. ‘I love caves because they’re so peaceful and timeless.You know that nothing has changed for a hundred thousand years, except that thestalactites have grown a bit thicker.’But now, as he drifted deeper into Halley, playing out the thin, but virtuallyunbreakable thread that linked him to Clifford Greenburg, he realized that thiswas no longer true. As yet, he had no scientific proof, but his geologist’sinstincts told him that this subterranean world had been born only yesterday, onthe time-scale of the Universe. It was younger than some of the cities of man.The tunnel through which he was gliding in long, shallow leaps was about fourmetres in diameter, and his virtual weightlessness brought back vivid memoriesof cave-diving on Earth. The low gravity contributed to the illusion; it wasexactly as if he was carrying slightly too much weight, and so kept driftinggently downwards. Only the absence of all resistance reminded him that he wasmoving through vacuum, not water.‘You’re just getting out of sight,’ said Greenburg, fifty metres in from theentrance. ‘Radio link still fine. What’s the scenery like?’‘Very hard to say - I can’t identify any formations, so I don’t have thevocabulary to describe them. It’s not any kind of rock - it crumbles when Itouch it - I feel as if I’m exploring a giant Gruyère cheese.’‘You mean it’s organic?’‘Yes - nothing to do with life, of course - but perfect raw material for it. Allsorts of hydrocarbons - the chemists will have fun with these samples. Can youstill see me?’‘Only the glow of your light, and that’s fading fast.’‘Ah - here’s some genuine rock - doesn’t look as if it belongs here - probablyan intrusion - ah - I’ve struck gold!’‘You’re joking!’‘It fooled a lot of people in the old West - iron pyrites. Common on the outersatellites, of course, but don’t ask me what it’s doing here…’‘Visual contact lost. You’re two hundred metres in.’‘I’m passing through a distinct layer - looks like meteoric debris - somethingexciting must have happened back then - I hope we can date it - wow!’‘Don’t do that sort of thing to me!’‘Sorry - quite took my breath away - there’s a big chamber ahead - last thing Iexpected - let me swing the beam around…‘Almost spherical - thirty, forty metres across. And - I don’t believe it -Halley is full of surprises - stalactites, stalagmites.’‘What’s so surprising about that?’‘No free water, no limestone here, of course - and such low gravity. Looks likesome kind of wax. Just a minute while I get good video coverage… fantasticshapes… sort of thing a dripping candle makes… that’s odd…’‘Now what?’Dr Chant’s voice had shown a sudden alteration in tone, which Greenburg hadinstantly detected.‘Some of the columns have been broken. They’re lying on the floor. It’s almostas if…’‘Go on!’‘… as if something has - blundered - into them.’‘That’s crazy. Could an earthquake have snapped them?’‘No earthquakes here - only microseisms from the geysers. Perhaps there was abig blow-out at some time. Anyway, it was centuries ago. There’s a film of thiswax stuff over the fallen columns - several millimetres thick.’Dr Chant was slowly recovering his composure. He was not a highly imaginativeman - spelunking eliminates such men rather quickly - but the very feel of theplace had triggered some disturbing memory. And those fallen columns lookedaltogether too much like the bars of a cage, broken by some monster in anattempt to escape.Of course, that was perfectly absurd - but Dr Chant had learned never to ignoreany premonition, any danger signal, until he had traced it to its origin. Thatcaution had saved his life more than once; he would not go beyond this chamberuntil he had identified the source of his fear. And he was honest enough toadmit that ‘fear’ was the correct word.‘Bill - are you all right? What’s happening?’‘Still filming. Some of these shapes remind me of Indian temple sculpture.Almost erotic.’He was deliberately turning his mind away from the direct confrontation of hisfears, hoping thereby to sneak up on them unawares, by a kind of averted mentalvision. Meanwhile the purely mechanical acts of recording and collecting samplesoccupied most of his attention.There was nothing wrong, he reminded himself, with healthy fear; only when itescalated into panic did it become a killer. He had known panic twice in hislife (once on a mountainside, once underwater) and still shuddered at the memoryof its clammy touch. Yet - thankfully - he was far from it now, and for a reasonwhich, though he did not understand it, he found curiously reassuring. There wasan element of comedy in the situation.And presently he started to laugh - not with hysteria, but with relief.‘Did you ever see those old Star Wars movies?’ he asked Greenburg.‘Of course - half a dozen times.’‘Well, I know what’s been bothering me. There was a sequence when Luke’sspaceship dives into an asteroid - and runs into a gigantic snake-creature thatlurks inside its caverns.’‘Not Luke’s ship - Hans Solo’s Millennium Falcon. And I always wondered how thatpoor beast managed to eke out a living. It must have grown very hungry, waitingfor the occasional titbit from space. And Princess Leia wouldn’t have been morethan an hors-d’oeuvre, anyway.’‘Which I certainly don’t intend to provide,’ said Dr Chant, now completely atease. ‘Even if there is life here - which would be marvellous - the food chainwould be very short. So I’d be surprised to find anything bigger than a mouse.Or, more likely, a mushroom… Now let’s see - where do we go from here… There aretwo exits on the other side of the chamber… the one on the right is bigger… I’lltake that…’‘How much more line have you got?’‘Oh, a good half-kilometre. Here we go… I’m in the middle of the chamber… damn,bounced off the wall… now I’ve got a hand-hold… going in head-first… smoothwalls, real rock for a change… that’s a pity..‘What’s the problem?’‘Can’t go any further. More stalactites… too close together for me to getthrough… and too thick to break without explosives. And that would be a shame…the colours are beautiful… first real greens and blues I’ve seen on Halley. Justa minute while I get them on video…Dr Chant braced himself against the wall of the narrow tunnel, and aimed thecamera. With his gloved fingers be reached for the HI-INTENSITY switch, butmissed it and cut off the main lights completely.‘Lousy design,’ he muttered. ‘Third time I’ve done that.’He did not immediately correct his mistake, because he had always enjoyed thatsilence and total darkness which can be experienced only in the deepest caves.The gentle background noises of his life-support equipment robbed him of thesilence, but at least…What was that? From beyond the portcullis of stalactites blocking furtherprogress he could see a faint glow, like the first light of dawn. As his eyesgrew adapted to the darkness, it appeared to grow brighter, and he could detecta hint of green. Now he could even see the outlines of the barrier ahead.‘What’s happening?’ said Greenburg anxiously.‘Nothing - just observing.’And thinking, he might have added. There were four possible explanations.Sunlight could be filtering down through some natural light duct - ice, crystal,whatever. But at this depth? Unlikely.Radioactivity? He hadn’t bothered to bring a counter; there were virtually noheavy elements here. But it would be worth coming back to check.Some phosphorescent mineral - that was the one he’d put his money on. But therewas a fourth possibility - the most unlikely, and most exciting, of all.Dr Chant had never forgotten a moonless - and Luciferless - night on the shoresof the Indian Ocean, when he had been walking beneath brilliant stars along asandy beach. The sea was very calm, but from time to time a languid wave wouldcollapse at his feet - and detonate in an explosion of light.He had walked out into the shallows (he could still remember the feel of thewater round his ankles, like a warm bath) and with every step he took there hadbeen another burst of light. He could even trigger it by clapping his handsclose to the surface.Could similar bioluminescent organisms have evolved, here in the heart ofHalley’s Comet? He would love to think so. It seemed a pity to vandalizesomething so exquisite as this natural work of art - with the glow behind it,the barrier now reminded him of an altar screen he had once seen in somecathedral - but he would have to go back and get some explosives. Meanwhile,there was the other corridor…‘I can’t get any further along this route,’ he told Greenburg, ’so I’ll try theother. Coming back to the junction - setting the reel on rewind.’ He did notmention the mysterious glow, which had vanished as soon as he switched on hislights again.Greenburg did not reply immediately, which was unusual; probably he was talkingto the ship. Chant did not worry; he would repeat his message as soon as he hadgot under way again.He did not bother, because there was a brief acknowledgement from Greenburg.‘Fine, Cliff - thought I’d lost you for a minute. Back at the chamber - nowgoing into the other tunnel - hope there’s nothing blocking that.’This time, Greenburg replied at once.‘Sorry, Bill. Come back to the ship. There’s an emergency - no, not here -everything’s fine with Universe. But we may have to return to Earth at once.’It was only a few weeks before Dr Chant discovered a very plausible explanationfor the broken columns. As the comet blasted its substance away into space ateach perihelion passage, its mass distribution continually altered. And so,every few thousand years, its spin became unstable, and it would change thedirection of its axis - quite violently, like a top that is about to fall overas it loses energy. When that occurred, the resulting cometquake could reach arespectable five on the Richter scale.But he never solved the mystery of the luminous glow. Though the problem wasswiftly overshadowed by the drama that was now unfolding, the sense of a missedopportunity would continue to haunt him for the rest of his life.Though he was occasionally tempted, he never mentioned it to any of hiscolleagues. But he did leave a sealed note for the next expedition, to be openedin 2133."},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREE20"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREERECALL‘Have you seen Victor?’ said Mihailovich gleefully, as Floyd hurried to answerthe Captain’s summons. ‘He’s a broken man.’‘He’ll grow it back on the way home,’ snapped Floyd, who had no time for suchtrivialities at the moment. ‘I’m trying to find out what’s happened.’Captain Smith was still sitting, almost stunned, in his cabin when he arrived.If this was an emergency affecting his own ship, he would have been a tornado ofcontrolled energy, issuing orders right and left. But there was nothing he coulddo about this situation, except await the next message from Earth.Captain Laplace was an old friend; how could he have got into such a mess? Therewas no conceivable accident, error of navigation, or failure of equipment thatcould possibly account for his predicament. Nor, as far as Smith could see, wasthere any way in which Universe could help him get out of it. Operations Centrewas just running round and round in circles; this looked like one of thoseemergencies, all too common in space, where nothing could be done excepttransmit condolences and record last messages. But he gave no hint of his doubtsand reservations when he reported the news to Floyd.‘There’s been an accident,’ he said. ‘We’ve received orders to return to Earthimmediately, to be fitted out for a rescue mission.’‘What kind of accident?’‘It’s our sister ship, Galaxy. She was doing a survey of the Jovian satellites.And she’s made a crash landing.’He saw the look of amazed incredulity on Floyd’s face.‘Yes, I know that’s impossible. But you’ve not heard anything yet. She’sstranded - on Europa.’‘Europa!’‘I’m afraid so. She’s damaged, but apparently there’s no loss of life. We’restill awaiting details.’‘When did it happen?’‘Twelve hours ago. There was a delay before she could report to Ganymede.’‘But what can we do? We’re on the other side of the Solar System. Getting backto lunar orbit to refuel, then taking the fastest orbit to Jupiter - it would be- oh, at least a couple of months!’ (And back in Leonov’s day, Floyd added tohimself, it would have been a couple of years…)‘I know; but there’s no other ship that could do anything.’ -‘What about Ganymede’s own inter-satellite ferries?’‘They’re only designed for orbital operations.’‘They’ve landed on Callisto.’‘Much lower energy mission. Oh, they could just manage Europa, but withnegligible payload. It’s being looked into, of course.’Floyd scarcely heard the Captain; he was still trying to assimilate thisastonishing news. For the first time in half a century - and only for the secondtime in all history! - a ship had landed on the forbidden moon. And thatprompted an ominous thought.‘Do you suppose,’ he asked, ‘that - whoever - whatever - is on Europa could beresponsible?’‘I was wondering about that,’ said the Captain glumly. ‘But we’ve been snoopingaround the place for years, without anything happening.’‘Even more to the point - what might happen to us if we attempted a rescue?’‘That’s the first thing that occurred to me. But all this is speculation - we’llhave to wait until we have more facts. Meanwhile - this is really why I calledyou - I’ve just received Galaxy’s crew manifest, and I was wondering…’Hesitantly, he pushed the print-out across his desk.

Television, which had been blamedfor many evils, deserved some credit for this. A precedent had been set ageneration earlier in the Philippines; when they know that the world iswatching, the great majority of men and women tend to behave in a responsiblemanner. Though there have been shameful exceptions, few massacres occur oncamera.Most of the Afrikaners, when they recognized the inevitable, had left thecountry long before the takeover of power. And - as the new administrationbitterly complained - they had not gone empty-handed. Billions of rands had beentransferred to Swiss and Dutch banks; towards the end, there had been mysteriousflights almost every hour out of Cape Town and Jo’burg to Zurich and Amsterdam.It was said that by Freedom Day one would not find one troy ounce of gold or acarat of diamond in the late Republic of South Africa - and the mine workingshad been effectively sabotaged. One prominent refugee boasted, from his luxuryapartment in The Hague, ‘It will be five years before the Kaffirs can getKimberley working again - if they ever do.’ To his great surprise, De Beers wasback in business, under new name and management, in less than five weeks, anddiamonds were now the single most important element in the new nation’s economy.Within a generation, the younger refugees had been absorbed - despite desperaterearguard actions by their conservative elders - in the deracinated culture ofthe twenty-first century. They recalled, with pride but without boastfulness,the courage and determination of their ancestors, and distanced themselves fromtheir stupidities. Virtually none of them spoke Afrikaans, even in their ownhomes.Yet, precisely as in the case of the Russian Revolution a century earlier, therewere many who dreamed of putting back the clock - or, at least, of sabotagingthe efforts of those who had usurped their power and privilege. Usually theychannelled their frustration and bitterness into propaganda, demonstrations,boycotts, petitions to the World Council - and, rarely, works of art. WilhelmSmuts’ The Voortrekkers was conceded to be a masterpiece of (ironically) Englishliterature, even by those who bitterly disagreed with the author.But there were also groups who believed that political action was useless, andthat only violence would restore the longed-for status quo. Although there couldnot have been many who really imagined that they could rewrite the pages ofhistory, there were not a few who, if victory was impossible, would gladlysettle for revenge.Between the two extremes of the totally assimilated and the completelyintransigent, there was an entire spectrum of political - and apolitical -parties. Der Bund was not the largest, but it was the most powerful, andcertainly the richest, since it controlled much of the lost Republic’s smuggledwealth, through a network of corporations and holding companies. Most of thesewere now perfectly legal, and indeed completely respectable.There was half a billion of Bund money in Tsung Aerospace, duly listed in theannual balance sheet. In 2059, Sir Lawrence was happy to receive anotherhalf-billion, which enabled him to accelerate the commissioning of his littlefleet.But not even his excellent intelligence traced any connection between the Bundand Tsung Aerospace’s latest charter mission, In any event, Halley was thenapproaching Mars, and Sir Lawrence was so busy getting Universe ready to leaveon schedule that he paid little attention to the routine operations of hersister ships.Though Lloyd’s of London did raise some queries about Galaxy’s proposed routing,these objections were quickly dealt with.

An anonymous and unexpected grant to the PlanetaryScience Foundation would finance a reconnaissance of the Jovian (even now,no-one ever called it Luciferian) satellite system, paying particular attentionto a dozen of the neglected smaller moons. Some of these had never even beenproperly surveyed, much less visited.As soon as he heard of the mission, Rolf van der Berg called the Tsung shippingagent and made some discreet enquiries.‘Yes, first we’ll head in towards Io - then do a flyby of Europa -’‘Only a flyby? How close?’‘Just a moment - odd, the flight plan doesn’t give details. But of course shewon’t go inside the Interdiction Zone.’‘Which was down to ten thousand kilometres at the last ruling… fifteen yearsago. Anyway, I’d like to volunteer as Mission Planetologist. I’ll send across myqualifications -’‘No need to do so, Dr van der Berg. They’ve already asked for you.’It is always easy to be wise after the event, and when he cast his mind back (hehad plenty of time for it later) Captain Laplace recalled a number of curiousaspects of the charter. Two crew members were taken suddenly sick, and werereplaced at short notice; he was so glad to have substitutes that he did notcheck their papers as closely as he might have done. (And even if he had, hewould have discovered that they were perfectly in order.)Then there was the trouble with the cargo. As captain, he was entitled toinspect anything that went aboard the ship. Of course, it was impossible to dothis for every item, but he never hesitated to investigate if he had goodreason. Space crews were, on the whole, a highly responsible body of men; butlong missions could be boring, and there were tedium-relieving chemicals which -though perfectly legal on Earth - should be discouraged off it.When Second Officer Chris Floyd reported his suspicions, the Captain assumedthat the ship’s chromatographic ’sniffer’ had detected another cache of thehigh-grade opium which his largely Chinese crew occasionally patronized. Thistime, however, the matter was serious - very serious.‘Cargo Hold Three, Item 2/456, Captain. The manifest says “Scientificapparatus”. It contains explosives.’‘What!’‘Definitely, Sir. Here’s the electrogram.’‘I’ll take your word for it, Mr Floyd. Have you inspected the item?’‘No, Sir. It’s in a sealed crew case, half a metre by one metre by five metres,approximately. One of the largest packages the science team brought aboard. It’slabelled FRAGILE - HANDLE WITH CARE. But so is everything, of course.’Captain Laplace drummed his fingers thoughtfully on the grained plastic ‘wood’of his desk. (He hated the pattern, and intended to get rid of it on the nextrefit.) Even that slight action started him rising out of his seat, and heautomatically anchored himself by wrapping his foot around the pillar of thechair.Though he did not for a moment doubt Floyd’s report - his new Second Officer wasvery competent, and the Captain was pleased that he had never brought up thesubject of his famous grandfather -there could be an innocent explanation. Thesniffer might have been misled by other chemicals with nervous molecularbondings.They could go down into the hold and force open the package. No - that might bedangerous, and could cause legal problems as well. Best to go straight to thetop; he’d have to do that anyway, sooner or later.‘Please bring Dr Anderson here - and don’t mention this to anyone else,’‘Very good, Sir.’ Chris Floyd gave a respectful but quite unnecessary salute,and left the room in a smooth, effortless glide.The leader of the science team was not accustomed to zero gravity, and hisentrance was quite clumsy. His obvious genuine indignation did not help, and hehad to grab the Captain’s desk several times in an undignified manner.‘Explosives! Of course not! Let me see the manifest… 2/456…’Dr Anderson pecked out the reference on his portable keyboard, and slowly readoff: “Mark V penetrometers, Quantity three.” Of course - no problem.’‘And just what,’ said the Captain, ‘is a penetrometer?’ Despite his concern, hehad difficulty in suppressing a smile; it sounded a little obscene.‘Standard planetary sampling device. You drop it, and with any luck it will giveyou a core up to ten metres long - even in hard rock. Then it sends back acomplete chemical analysis. The only safe way to study places like daysideMercury - or Io, where we’ll drop the first one.’‘Dr Anderson,’ said the Captain, with great selfrestraint, ‘you may be anexcellent geologist, but you don’t know much about celestial mechanics. Youcan’t just drop things from orbit -’The charge of ignorance was clearly unfounded, as the scientist’s reactionproved.‘The idiots!’ he said. ‘Of course, you should have been notified.’‘Exactly. Solid fuel rockets are classified as “Hazardous Cargo”. I wantclearance from the underwriters, and your personal assurance that the safetysystems are adequate; otherwise, they go overboard. Now, any other littlesurprises? Were you planning seismic surveys? I believe those usually involveexplosives…’A few hours later, the somewhat chastened scientist admitted that he had alsofound two bottles of elemental fluorine, used to power the lasers which couldzap passing celestial bodies at thousand-kilometre ranges for spectrographicsampling. As pure fluorine was about the most vicious substance known to man, itwas high on the list of prohibited materials - but, like the rockets which drovethe penetrometers down to their targets, it was essential for the mission.When he was quite satisfied that all the necessary precautions had been taken,Captain Laplace accepted the scientist’s apologies, and his assurance that theoversight was entirely due to the haste with which the expedition had beenorganized.He felt sure that Dr Anderson was telling the truth, but already he felt thatthere was something odd about the mission.Just how odd he could never have imagined."},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREE23"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREEINFERNOBefore the detonation of Jupiter, Io had been second only to Venus as the bestapproximation to Hell in the Solar System. Now that Lucifer had raised itssurface temperature another couple of hundred degrees, even Venus could nolonger compete.The sulphur volcanoes and geysers had multiplied their activity, now reshapingthe features of the tormented satellite in years rather than decades. Theplanetologists had given up any attempt at mapmaking, and contented themselveswith taking orbital photographs every few days. From these, they had constructedawe-inspiring time-lapse movies of inferno in action.Lloyd’s of London had charged a stiff premium for this leg of the mission, butIo posed no real danger to a ship doing a flyby at a minimum range of tenthousand kilometres - and over the relatively quiescent nightside at that.As he watched the approaching yellow and orange globe - the most improbablygarish object in the entire Solar System - Second Officer Chris Floyd could nothelp recalling the time, now half a century ago, when his grandfather had comethis way. Here, Leonov had made its rendezvous with the abandoned Discovery, andhere Dr Chandra had reawakened the dormant computer Hal. Then both ships hadflown on to survey the enormous black monolith hovering at L1, the InnerLagrange Point between Io and Jupiter.Now the monolith was gone - and so was Jupiter. The minisun that had risen likea phoenix from the implosion of the giant planet had turned its satellites intowhat was virtually another Solar System, though only on Ganymede and Europa werethere regions with Earthlike temperatures. How long that would continue to bethe case, no-one knew. Estimates of Lucifer’s life-span ranged from a thousandto a million years.Galaxy’s science team looked wistfully at the L1 point, but it was now far toodangerous to approach. There had always been a river of electrical energy - theIo ‘flux tube’ - flowing between Jupiter and its inner satellite, and thecreation of Lucifer had increased its strength several hundredfold. Sometimesthe river of power could even be seen by the naked eye, glowing yellow with thecharacteristic light of ionized sodium. Some engineers on Ganymede had talkedhopefully about tapping the gigawatts going to waste next door, but no-one couldthink of a plausible way of doing so.The first penetrometer was launched, with vulgar comments from the crew, and twohours later drove like a hypodermic needle into the festering satellite. Itcontinued to operate for almost five seconds - ten times its designed lifetime -broadcasting thousands of chemical, physical and rheological measurements,before Io demolished it.The scientists were ecstatic; van der Berg was merely pleased. He had expectedthe probe to work; Io was an absurdly easy target. But if he was right aboutEuropa, the second penetrometer would surely fail.Yet that would prove nothing; it might fail for a dozen good reasons. And whenit did, there would be no alternative but a landing.Which, of course, was totally prohibited - not only by the laws of man."},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREE24"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREESHAKA THE GREATASTROPOL - which, despite its grandiose title, had disappointingly littlebusiness off Earth - would not admit that SHAKA really existed. The USSA tookexactly the same position, and its diplomats became embarrassed or indignantwhen anyone was tactless enough to mention the name.But Newton’s Third Law applies in politics, as in everything else. The Bund hadits extremists -though it tried, sometimes not very hard, to disown them -continually plotting against the USSA. Usually they confined themselves toattempts at commercial sabotage, but there were occasional explosions,disappearances and even assassinations.Needless to say, the South Africans did not take this lightly. They reacted byestablishing their own official counter-intelligence services, which also had arather free-wheeling range of operations - and likewise claimed to know nothingabout SHAKA. Perhaps they were employing the useful CIA invention of ‘plausibledeniability’. It is even possible that they were telling the truth.According to one theory, SHAKA started as a codeword, and then - rather likeProkofiev’s ‘Lieutenant Kije’ - had acquired a life of its own, because it wasuseful to various clandestine bureaucracies. This would certainly account forthe fact that none of its members had ever defected, or even been arrested.But there was another, somewhat far-fetched explanation for this, according tothose who believed that SHAKA really did exist. All its agents had beenpsychologically conditioned to self-destruct before there was any possibility ofinterrogation.Whatever the truth, no-one could seriously imagine that, more than two centuriesafter his death, the legend of the great Zulu tyrant would cast its shadowacross worlds he never knew."},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREE25"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREETHE SHROUDED WORLDDuring the decade after the ignition of Jupiter, and the spreading of the GreatThaw across its satellite system, Europa had been left strictly alone. Then theChinese had made a swift flyby, probing the clouds with radar in an attempt tolocate the wreck of the Tsien. They had been unsuccessful, but their maps ofdayside were the first to show the new continents now emerging as the ice-covermelted.They had also discovered a perfectly straight two-kilometre-long feature whichlooked so artificial that it was christened the Great Wall. Because of its shapeand size it was assumed to be the Monolith -or a monolith, since millions hadbeen replicated in the hours before the creation of Lucifer.However, there had been no reaction, or any hint of an intelligent signal, frombelow the steadily thickening clouds. So a few years later, survey satelliteswere placed in permanent orbit, and high-altitude balloons were dropped into theatmosphere to study its wind patterns. Terrestrial meteorologists found these ofabsorbing interest, because Europa - with a central ocean, and a sun that neverset - presented a beautifully simplified model for their text-books.So had begun the game of ‘Europan Roulette’, as the administrators were fond ofcalling it whenever the scientists proposed getting closer to the satellite.After fifty uneventful years, it had become somewhat boring. Captain Laplacehoped it would remain that way, and had required considerable reassurance fromDr Anderson.‘Personally,’ he had told the scientist, ‘I would regard it as a slightlyunfriendly act, to have a ton of armour-piercing hardware dropped on me at athousand kilometres an hour. I’m quite surprised the World Council gave youpermission.’Dr Anderson was also a little surprised, though he might not have been had heknown that the project was the last item on a long agenda of a ScienceSubCommittee late on a Friday afternoon. Of such trifles history is made.‘I agree, Captain. But we are operating under very strict limitations, andthere’s no possibility of interfering with the - ah - Europans, whoever theyare. We’re aiming at a target five kilometres above sea level.’‘So I understand. What’s so interesting about Mount Zeus?’‘It’s a total mystery. It wasn’t even there, only a few years ago. So you canunderstand why it drives the geologists crazy.’‘And your gadget will analyse it when it goes in.’‘Exactly. And - I really shouldn’t be telling you this - but I’ve been asked tokeep the results confidential, and to send them back to Earth encrypted.Obviously, someone’s on the track of a major discovery, and wants to make quitesure they’re not beaten to a publication. Would you believe that scientistscould be so petty?’Captain Laplace could well believe it, but did not want to disillusion hispassenger. Dr Anderson seemed touchingly naïve; whatever was going on - and theCaptain was now quite certain there was much more to this mission than met theeye - Anderson knew nothing about it.‘I can only hope, Doctor, that the Europans don’t go in for mountain climbing.I’d hate to interrupt any attempt to put a flag on their local Everest.’There was a feeling of unusual excitement aboard Galaxy when the penetrometerwas launched - and even the inevitable jokes were muted. During the two hours ofthe probe’s long fall towards Europa, virtually every member of the crew foundsome perfectly legitimate excuse to visit the bridge and watch the guidanceoperation. Fifteen minutes before impact, Captain Laplace declared it out ofbounds to all visitors, except the ship’s new steward Rosie; without her endlesssupply of squeezebulbs full of excellent coffee, the operation could not havecontinued.Everything went perfectly. Soon after atmospheric entry, the air-brakes weredeployed, slowing the penetrometer to an acceptable impact velocity. The radarimage of the target - featureless, with no indication of scale - grew steadilyon the screen. At minus one second, all the recorders switched automatically tohigh speed…But there was nothing to record. ‘Now I know,’ said Dr Anderson sadly, ‘just howthey felt at the Jet Propulsion Lab, when those first Rangers crashed into theMoon - with their cameras blind.’"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREE26"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREENIGHT WATCHOnly time is universal; night and day are merely quaint local customs, found onthose planets which tidal forces have not yet robbed of their rotation. Buthowever far they travel from their native world, human beings can never escapethe diurnal rhythm, set ages ago by its cycle of light and darkness.So at 01.05, Universal Time, Second Officer Chang was alone on the bridge, whilethe ship was sleeping around him. There was no real need for him to be awakeeither, since Galaxy’s electronic senses would detect any malfunction far soonerthan he could possibly do. But a century of cybernetics had proved that humanbeings were still slightly better than machines at dealing with the unexpected;and sooner or later, the unexpected always happened.‘Where’s my coffee?’ thought Chang grumpily. ‘It’s not like Rosie to be late.’He wondered if the steward had been affected by the same malaise that hadovertaken both scientists and space crew, after the disasters of the lasttwenty-four hours.Following the failure of the first penetrometer, there had been a hastyconference to decide the next step. One unit was left; it had been intended forCallisto, but it could be used just as easily here.‘And anyway,’ Dr Anderson had argued, ‘we’ve landed on Callisto - there’snothing there except assorted varieties of cracked ice.’There had been no disagreement. After a twelve-hour delay for modification andtesting, Pen No. 3 was launched into the Europan cloudscape, following theinvisible track of its precursor.This time, the ship’s recorders did get some data - for about half amillisecond. The accelerometer on the probe, which was calibrated to operate upto 20,000 gee, gave one brief pulse before going off-scale. Everything must havebeen destroyed in very much less than the twinkling of an eye.After a second, and even gloomier, post-mortem, it was decided to report toEarth, and wait in high orbit round Europa for any further instructions, beforeproceeding to Callisto and the outer moons,‘Sorry to be late, Sir,’ said Rose McCullen (one would never guess from her namethat she was slightly darker than the coffee she was carrying) ‘but I must haveset the alarm wrong.’‘Lucky for us,’ chuckled the Officer of the Watch, ‘that you’re not running theship.’‘I don’t understand how anyone could run it,’ answered Rose. ‘It all looks socomplicated.’‘Oh, it’s not as bad as it looks,’ said Chang. ‘And don’t they give you basicspace theory in your training course?’‘Er - yes. But I never understood much of it. Orbits and all that nonsense.’Second Officer Chang was bored, and felt it would be a kindness to enlighten hisaudience. And although Rose was not exactly his type, she was undoubtedlyattractive; a little effort now might be a worthwhile investment. It neveroccurred to him that, having performed her duty, Rose might like to go back tosleep.Twenty minutes later, Second Officer Chang waved at the navigation console andconcluded expansively: ‘So you see, it’s really almost automatic. You only haveto punch in a few numbers and the ship takes care of the rest.’Rose seemed to be getting tired; she kept looking at her watch.‘I’m sorry,’ said the suddenly contrite Chang. ‘I shouldn’t have kept you up.’‘Oh no - it’s extremely interesting. Please go on.’‘Definitely not. Maybe some other time. Goodnight, Rosie - and thanks for thecoffee.’‘Goodnight, Sir.’Steward Third Class Rose McCullen glided (not too skilfully) towards the stillopen door. Chang did not bother to look back when he heard it close.It was thus a considerable shock when, a few seconds later, he was addressed bya completely unfamiliar female voice.‘Mr Chang - don’t bother to touch the alarm button - it’s disconnected. Here arethe landing coordinates. Take the ship down.’Slowly, wondering if he had somehow dozed off and was having a nightmare, Changrotated his chair.The person who had been Rose McCullen was floating beside the oval hatchway,steadying herself by holding on to the locking lever of the door. Everythingabout her seemed to have changed; in a moment of time, their roles had beenreversed. The shy steward - who had never before looked at him directly - wasnow regarding Chang with a cold, merciless stare that made him feel like arabbit hypnotized by a snake. The small but deadly-looking gun nestling in herfree hand seemed an unnecessary adornment; Chang had not the slightest doubtthat she could very efficiently kill him without it.Nevertheless, both his self-respect and his professional honour demanded that heshould not surrender without some sort of a struggle. At the very least, hemight be able to gain time.‘Rose,’ he said - and now his lips had difficulty in forming a name which hadbecome suddenly inappropriate - ‘this is perfectly ridiculous. What I told youjust now - it’s simply not true. I couldn’t possibly land the ship by myself. Itwould take hours to compute the correct orbit, and I’d need someone to help me.A co-pilot, at least.’The gun did not waver.‘I’m not a fool, Mr Chang. This ship isn’t energy-limited, like the old chemicalrockets. The escape velocity of Europa is only three kilometres a second. Partof your training is an emergency landing with the main computer down. Now youcan put it into practice: the window for an optimum touchdown at the coordinatesI will give you opens in five minutes.’‘That type of abort,’ said Chang, now beginning to sweat profusely, ‘has anestimated twenty-five per cent failure rate’ - the true figure was ten per cent,but in the circumstances he felt that a little exaggeration was justified - ‘andit’s years since I checked out on it.’‘In that case,’ answered Rose McCullen, ‘I’ll have to eliminate you and ask theCaptain to send me someone more qualified. Annoying, because we’ll miss thiswindow and have to wait a couple of hours for the next one. Four minutes left.’Second Officer Chang knew when he was beaten; but at least he had tried.‘Let me have those coordinates,’ he said."},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREE27"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREEROSIECaptain Laplace woke instantly at the first gentle tapping, like a distantwoodpecker, of the attitude control jets. For a moment he wondered if he wasdreaming: no, the ship was definitely turning in space.Perhaps it was getting too hot on one side and the thermal control system wasmaking some minor adjustments. That did happen occasionally, and was a blackmark for the officer on duty, who should have noticed that the temperatureenvelope was being approached.He reached for the intercom button to call - who was it? - Mr Chang on thebridge. His hand never completed the movement.After days of weightlessness, even a tenth of a gravity is a shock. To theCaptain it seemed like minutes, though it must have been only a few seconds,before he could unbuckle his restraining harness and struggle out of his bunk.This time, he found the button and jabbed it viciously. There was no reply.He tried to ignore the thuds and bumps of inadequately secured objects that hadbeen taken unawares by the onset of gravity. Things seemed to go on falling fora long time, but presently the only abnormal sound was the muffled, far-offscream of the drive at full blast.He tore open the curtain of the cabin’s little window, and looked out at thestars. He knew roughly where the ship’s axis should have been pointing; even ifhe could only judge it to within thirty or forty degrees, that would allow himto distinguish between the two possible alternatives.Galaxy could be vectored either to gain, or to lose, orbital velocity. It waslosing it - and therefore preparing to fall towards Europa.There was an insistent banging on the door, and the Captain realized that littlemore than a minute could really have passed. Second Officer Floyd and two othercrew members were crowded in the narrow passageway.‘The bridge is locked, Sir,’ Floyd reported breathlessly. ‘We can’t get in - andChang doesn’t answer. We don’t know what’s happened.’‘I’m afraid I do,’ Captain Laplace answered, climbing into his shorts. ‘Somemadman was bound to try it sooner or later. We’ve been hijacked, and I knowwhere. But I’m damned if I know why.’He glanced at his watch, and did a quick mental calculation.‘At this thrust level, we’ll have deorbited within fifteen minutes - make it tenfor safety. Any way we can cut the drive without endangering the ship?’Second Officer Yu, Engineering, looked very unhappy, but volunteered a reluctantreply.‘We could pull the circuit breakers in the pump motor lines, and cut off thepropellant supply.’‘Can we get at them?’‘Yes - they’re on Deck Three.’‘Then let’s go.’‘Er - then the independent backup system would take over. For safety, that’sbehind a sealed bulkhead on Deck Five - we’d have to get a cutter - no, itcouldn’t be done in time.’Captain Laplace had been afraid of that. The men of genius who had designedGalaxy had tried to protect the ship from all plausible accidents. There was noway they could have safeguarded it against human malevolence.‘Any alternatives?’‘Not in the time available, I’m afraid.’‘Then let’s get to the bridge and see if we can talk to Chang - and whoever iswith him.’And who could that be? he wondered. He refused to believe that it could be oneof his regular crew. That left - of course, there was the answer! He could seeit all. Monomaniac researcher tries to prove theory - experiments frustrated -decides that the quest for knowledge takes precedence over everything else.It was uncomfortably like one of those cheap ‘mad scientist’ melodramas, but itfitted the facts perfectly. He wondered if Dr Anderson had decided that this wasthe only road to a Nobel Prize.That theory was swiftly demolished when the breathless and dishevelled geologistarrived gasping:‘For God’s sake, Captain - what’s happening? We’re under full thrust! Are wegoing up - or down?’‘Down,’ answered Captain Laplace. ‘In about ten minutes, we’ll be in an orbitthat will hit Europa. I can only hope that whoever’s at the controls knows whathe’s doing.’Now they were at the bridge, facing the closed door. Not a sound came from thefar side.Laplate rapped as loudly as he possibly could without bruising his knuckles.‘This is the Captain! Let us in!’He felt rather foolish at giving an order which would certainly be ignored, buthe hoped for at least some reaction. To his surprise, he got one.The external speaker hissed into life, and a voice said: ‘Don’t attempt anythingfoolish, Captain. I have a gun, and Mr Chang is obeying my orders.’‘Who was that?’ whispered one of the officers. ‘It sounds like a woman!’‘You’re right,’ said the Captain grimly. That certainly cut down thealternatives, but didn’t help matters in any way.‘What do you hope to do? You know you can’t possibly get away with it!’ heshouted, trying to sound masterful rather than plaintive.‘We’re landing on Europa. And if you want to take off again, don’t try to stopme.’‘Her room’s completely clean,’ Second Officer Chris Floyd reported thirtyminutes later, when the thrust had been cut to zero and Galaxy was falling alongthe ellipse which would soon graze the atmosphere of Europa. They were nowcommitted; although it would now be possible to immobilize the engines, it wouldbe suicide to do so. They would be needed again to make a landing - althoughthat could be merely a more protracted form of suicide.‘Rosie McCullen! Who would have believed it! Do you suppose she’s on drugs?’‘No,’ said Floyd. ‘This has been very carefully planned. She must have a radiohidden somewhere in the ship. We should search for it.’‘You sound like a damned cop.’‘That will do, gentlemen,’ said the Captain. Tempers were getting frayed,largely through sheer frustration and the total failure to establish any furthercontact with the barricaded bridge. He glanced at his watch.‘Less than two hours before we enter atmosphere - what there is of it. I’ll bein my cabin - it’s just possible they may try to call me there. Mr Yu, pleasestand by the bridge and report any developments at once.’He had never felt so helpless in his life, but there were times when doingnothing was the only thing to do. As he left the officers’ wardroom, he heardsomeone say wistfully: ‘I could do with a bulb of coffee. Rosie made the bestI’ve ever tasted.’Yes, thought the Captain grimly, she’s certainly efficient. Whatever job shetackles, she’ll do it thoroughly."},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREE28"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREEDIALOGUEThere was only one man aboard Galaxy who could regard the situation as anythingbut a total disaster. I may be about to die, Rolf van der Berg told himself; butat least I have a chance of scientific immortality. Though that might be poorconsolation, it was more than anyone else on the ship could hope for.That Galaxy was heading for Mount Zeus he did not doubt for a moment; there wasnothing else on Europa of any significance. Indeed, there was nothing remotelycomparable on any planet.So his theory - and he had to admit that it was still a theory - was no longer asecret. How could it have leaked out?He trusted Uncle Paul implicitly, but he might have been indiscreet. Morelikely, someone had monitored his computers, perhaps as a matter of routine. Ifso, the old scientist could well be in danger; Rolf wondered if he could - orshould - get a warning to him. He knew that the communications officer wastrying to contact Ganymede via one of the emergency transmitters; an automaticbeacon alert had already gone out, and the news would be hitting Earth anyminute now. It had been on its way now for almost an hour…‘Come in,’ he said, at the quiet knock on his cabin door. ‘Oh - hello, Chris.What can I do for you?’He was surprised to see Second Officer Chris Floyd, whom he knew no better thanany of his other colleagues. If they landed safely on Europa, he thoughtgloomily, they might get to know each other far better than they wished.‘Hello, Doctor. You’re the only person who lives around here. I wondered if youcould help me.’‘I’m not sure how anyone can help anyone at the moment. What’s the latest fromthe bridge?’‘Nothing new: I’ve just left Yu and Gillings up there, trying to fix a mike onthe door. But no-one inside seems to be talking; not surprising - Chang musthave his hands full.’‘Can he get us down safely?’‘He’s the best; if anyone can do it, he can. I’m more worried about getting offagain.’‘God - I’d not been looking that far ahead. I assumed that was no problem.’‘It could be marginal. Remember, this ship is designed for orbital operations.We hadn’t planned to put down on any major moon - though we had hoped torendezvous with Ananke and Carme. So we could be stuck on Europa - especially ifChang has to waste propellant looking for a good landing site.’‘Do we know where he is trying to land?’ Rolf asked, trying not to sound moreinterested than might be reasonably expected. He must have failed, because Chrislooked at him sharply.‘There’s no way we can tell at this stage, though we may get a better idea whenhe starts braking. But you know these moons; where do you think?’‘There’s only one interesting place. Mount Zeus.’‘Why should anyone want to land there?’RoIf shrugged.‘That was one of the things we’d hoped to find out. Cost us two expensivepenetrometers.’‘And it looks like costing a great deal more. Haven’t you any ideas?’‘You sound like a cop,’ said van der Berg with a grin, not intending it in theleast seriously.‘Funny - that’s the second time I’ve been told that in the last hour.’Instantly, there was a subtle change in the atmosphere of the cabin - almost asif the life-support system had readjusted itself.‘Oh - I was just joking - are you?’‘If I was, I wouldn’t admit it, would I?’That was no answer, thought van der Berg; but on second thoughts, perhaps itwas.He looked intently at the young officer, noticing - not for the first time - hisstriking resemblance to his famous grandfather. Someone had mentioned that ChrisFloyd had only joined Galaxy on this mission, from another ship in the Tsungfleet - adding sarcastically that it was useful to have good connections in anybusiness. But there had been no criticism of Floyd’s ability; he was anexcellent space officer. Those skills might qualify him for other part-time jobsas well; look at RosieMcCulIen - who had also, now he came to think of it,joined Galaxy just before this mission.Rolf van der Berg felt that he had become enmeshed in some vast and tenuous webof interplanetary intrigue; as a scientist, accustomed to getting - usually -straightforward answers to the questions he put to nature, he did not enjoy thesituation.But he could hardly claim to be an innocent victim. He had tried to conceal thetruth - or at least what he believed to be the truth. And now the consequencesof that deceit had multiplied like the neutrons in a chain reaction; withresults that might be equally disastrous.Which side was Chris Floyd on? How many sides were there? The Bund wouldcertainly be involved, once the secret had leaked out. But there were splintergroups within the Bund itself, and groups opposing them; it was like a hall ofmirrors.There was one point, however, on which he did feel reasonably certain. ChrisFloyd, if only because of his connections, could be trusted. I’d put my money,thought van der Berg, on him being assigned to ASTROPOL for the duration of themission - however long, or short, that might now be.‘I’d like to help you, Chris,’ he said slowly. ‘As you probably suspect, I dohave some theories. But they may still be utter nonsense.‘In less than half an hour, we may know the truth. Until then, I prefer to saynothing.’And this is not, he told himself, merely ingrained Boer stubbornness. If he hadbeen mistaken, he would prefer not to die among men who knew that he was thefool who had brought them to their doom."},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREE29"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREEDESCENTSecond Officer Chang had been wrestling with the problem ever since Galaxy hadbeen successfully - to his surprise as much as his relief - injected intotransfer orbit. For the next couple of hours she was in the hands of God, or atleast Sir Isaac Newton; there was nothing to do but wait until the final brakingand descent manoeuvre.He had briefly considered trying to fool Rosie by giving the ship a reversevector at closest approach, and so taking it out into space again. It would thenbe back in a stable orbit, and a rescue could eventually be mounted fromGanymede. But there was a fundamental objection to this scheme: he wouldcertainly not be alive to be rescued. Though Chang was no coward, he wouldprefer not to become a posthumous hero of the spaceways.In any event, his chances of surviving the next hour seemed remote. He had beenordered to take down, single-handed, a three-thousand tonner on totally unknownterritory. This was not a feat he would care to attempt even on the familiarMoon.‘How many minutes before you start braking?’ asked Rosie. Perhaps it was more ofan order than a question; she clearly understood the fundamentals ofastronautics, and Chang abandoned his last wild fantasies of outwitting her.‘Five,’ he said reluctantly. ‘Can I warn the rest of the ship to stand by?’‘I’ll do it. Give me the mike… THIS IS THE BRIDGE. WE START BRAKING IN FIVEMINUTES. REPEAT, FIVE MINUTES. OUT.’To the scientists and officers assembled in the wardroom, the message was fullyexpected. They had had one piece of luck; the external video monitors had notbeen switched off. Perhaps Rose had forgotten about them; it was more likelythat she had not bothered. So now, as helpless spectators - quite literally, acaptive audience - they could watch their unfolding doom.The cloudy crescent of Europa now filled the field of the rear-view camera.There was no break anywhere in the solid overcast of water vapour recondensingon its way back to nightside. That was not important, since the landing would beradar-controlled until the last moment. It would, however, prolong the agony ofobservers who had to rely on visible light,No-one stared more intently at the approaching world than the man who hadstudied it with such frustration for almost a decade. Rolf van der Berg, seatedin one of the flimsy low-gravity chairs with the restraining belt lightlyfastened, barely noticed the first onset of weight as braking commenced.In five seconds, they were up to full thrust. All the officers were doing rapidcalculations on their comsets; without access to Navigation, there would be alot of guesswork, and Captain Laplace waited for a consensus to emerge.‘Eleven minutes,’ he announced presently, ‘assuming he doesn’t reduce thrustlevel - he’s at max now. And assuming he’s going to hover at ten kilometres -just above the overcast - and then go straight down. That could take anotherfive minutes.’It was unnecessary for him to add that the last second of those five minuteswould be the most critical.Europa seemed determined to keep its secrets to the very end. When Galaxy washovering motionless, just above the cloudscape, there was still no sign of theland - or sea - beneath. Then, for a few agonizing seconds, the screens becamecompletely blank - except for a glimpse of the now extended, and very seldomused, landing gear. The noise of its emergence a few minutes earlier had causeda brief flurry of alarm among the passengers; now they could only hope that itwould perform its duty.How thick is this damn cloud? van der Berg asked himself. Does it go all the waydown -No, it was breaking, thinning out into shreds and wisps - and there wasthe new Europa, spread out, it seemed, only a few thousand metres below.It was indeed new; one did not have to be a geologist to see that. Four billionyears ago, perhaps, the infant Earth had looked like this, as land and seaprepared to begin their endless conflict.Here, until fifty years ago, there had been neither land nor sea - only ice. Butnow the ice had melted on the Lucifer-facing hemisphere, the resulting water hadboiled upwards - and been deposited in the permanent deep-freeze of nightside.The removal of billions of tons of liquid from one hemisphere to the other hadthus exposed ancient seabeds that had never before known even the pale light ofthe far-distant Sun.Some day, perhaps, these contorted landscapes would be softened and tamed by aspreading blanket of vegetation; now they were barren lava flows and gentlysteaming mud flats, interrupted occasionally by masses of up-thrust rock withstrangely slanting strata. This had clearly been an area of great tectonicdisturbance, which was hardly surprising if it had seen the recent birth of amountain the size of Everest.And there it was - looming up over the unnaturally close horizon. Rolf van derBerg felt a tightness in his chest, and a tingling of the flesh at the back ofhis neck. No longer through the remote impersonal senses of instruments, butwith his own eyes, he was seeing the mountain of his dreams.As he well knew, it was in the approximate shape of a tetrahedron, tilted sothat one face was almost vertical. (That would be a nice challenge to climbers,even in this gravity - especially as they couldn’t drive pitons into it…) Thesummit was hidden in the clouds, and much of the gently-sloping face turnedtowards them was covered with snow.‘Is that what all the fuss is about?’ muttered someone in disgust. ‘Looks like aperfectly ordinary mountain to me. I guess that once you’ve seen one -’ He was’shushed’ angrily into silence.Galaxy was now drifting slowly towards Mount Zeus, as Chang searched for a goodlanding place. The ship had very little lateral control, as ninety per cent ofthe main thrust had to be used merely to support it. There was enough propellantto hover for perhaps five minutes; after that, he might still be able to landsafely - but he could never take off again.Neil Armstrong had faced the same dilemma, almost a hundred years ago. But hehad not been piloting with a gun aimed at his head.Yet for the last few minutes, Chang had totally forgotten both gun and Rosie.Every sense was focused on the job ahead; he was virtually part of the greatmachine he was controlling. The only human emotion left to him was not fear -but exhilaration. This was the job he had been trained to perform; this was thehighlight of his professional career - even as it might be the finale.And that was what it looked like becoming. The foot of the mountain was now lessthan a kilometre away - and he had still found no landing site. The terrain wasincredibly rugged, torn with canyons, littered with gigantic boulders. He hadnot seen a single horizontal area larger than a tennis court -and the red lineon the propellant gauge was only thirty seconds away.But there, at last, was a smooth surface - much the flattest he’d seen - it washis only chance within the time frame.Delicately, he juggled the giant, unstable cylinder he was controlling towardsthe patch of horizontal ground - it seemed to be snow-covered - yes, it was -the blast was blowing the snow away - but what’s underneath? - looks like ice -must be a frozen lake - how thick? - HOW THICK? -The five-hundred-tonhammer-blow of Galaxy’s main jets hit the treacherously inviting surface. Apattern of radiating lines sped swiftly across it; the ice cracked, and greatsheets started to overturn. Concentric waves of boiling water hurtled outwardsas the fury of the drive blasted into the suddenly uncovered lake.Like the well-trained officer he was, Chang reacted automatically, without thefatal hesitations of thought. His left hand ripped open the SAFETY LOCK bar; hisright grabbed the red lever it protected - and pulled it to the open position.The ABORT program, peacefully sleeping ever since Galaxy was launched, took overand hurled the ship back up into the sky."},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREE30"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREEGALAXY DOWNIn the wardroom, the sudden surge of full thrust came like a stay of execution.The horrified officers had seen the collapse of the chosen landing site, andknew that there was only one way of escape. Now that Chang had taken it, theyonce more permitted themselves the luxury of breath.But how long they could continue to enjoy that experience, no-one could guess.Only Chang knew whether the ship had enough propellant to reach a stable orbit;and even if it did, Captain Laplace thought gloomily, the lunatic with the gunmight order him down again. Though he did not for a minute believe that shereally was a lunatic; she knew exactly what she was doing.Suddenly, there was a change in thrust.‘Number Four motor’s just cut,’ said an engineering officer. ‘I’m not surprised- probably overheated. Not rated for so long at this level.’There was, of course, no sense of any directional change - the reduced thrustwas still along the ship’s axis - but the views on the monitor screens hadtilted crazily. Galaxy was still ascending, but no longer vertically. She hadbecome a ballistic missile, aimed at some unknown target on Europa.Once more, the thrust dropped abruptly; across the video monitors, the horizonbecame level again.‘He’s cut the opposite motor - only way to stop us cartwheeling - but can hemaintain altitude - good man!’The watching scientists could not see what was good about it; the view on themonitors had disappeared completely, obscured by a blinding white fog.‘He’s dumping excess propellant - lightening the ship -’The thrust dwindled away to zero; the ship was in free fall. In a few seconds,it had dropped through the vast cloud of ice crystals created when its dumpedpropellant had exploded into space. And there beneath it, approaching at aleisurely one-eighth of a gravity acceleration, was Europa’s central sea. Atleast Chang would not have to select a landing site; from now on, it would bestandard operating procedure, familiar as a video game to millions who had nevergone into space, and never would.All you had to do was to balance the thrust against gravity, so that thedescending ship reached zero velocity at zero altitude. There was some marginfor error, but not much, even for the water landings which the first Americanastronauts had preferred, and which Chang was now reluctantly emulating. If hemade a mistake - and after the last few hours, he could scarcely be blamed - nohome computer would say to him: ‘Sorry - you’ve crashed. Would you like to tryagain? Answer YES/NO…’Second Officer Yu and his two companions, waiting with their improvised weaponsoutside the locked door of the bridge, had perhaps been given the toughestassignment of all. They had no monitor screens to tell them what was happening,and had to rely on messages from the wardroom. Nor had there been anythingthrough the spy mike, which was hardly surprising. Chang and McCullen had verylittle time or need for conversation.The touchdown was superb, with hardly a jolt. Galaxy sank a few extra metres,then bobbed up again, to float vertically and - thanks to the weight of theengines - in the upright position.It was then that the listeners heard the first intelligible sounds through thespy mike.‘You maniac, Rosie,’ said Chang’s voice, more in resigned exhaustion than anger.‘I hope you’re satisfied. You’ve killed us all.’There was one pistol shot, then a long silence.Yu and his colleagues waited patiently, knowing that something was bound tohappen soon. Then they heard the locking levers being unlatched, and gripped thespanners and metal bars they were carrying. She might get one of them, but notall -The door swung open, very slowly.‘Sorry,’ said Second Officer Chang. ‘I must have passed out for a minute.’Then, like any reasonable man, he fainted again."},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREE31"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREETHE SEA OF GALILEEI can never understand how a man could become a doctor, Captain Laplace toldhimself. Or an undertaker, for that matter. They have some nasty jobs to do…‘Well, did you find anything?’‘No, Skipper. Of course, I don’t have the right sort of equipment. There aresome implants that you could only locate through a microscope - or so I’m told.They could only be very short range, though.’‘Perhaps to a relay transmitter somewhere in the ship - Floyd’s suggested wemake a search. You took fingerprints and - any other idents?’‘Yes - when we contact Ganymede, we’ll beam them up, with her papers. But Idoubt if we’ll ever know who Rosie was, or who she was acting for. Or why, forGod’s sake.’‘At least she showed some human instincts,’ said Laplace thoughtfully. ‘She musthave known she’d failed, when Chang pulled the ABORT lever. She could have shothim then, instead of letting him land.’‘Much good that will do us, I’m afraid. Let me tell you something that happenedwhen Jenkins and I put the cadaver out through the refuse dump.’The doctor pursed his lips in a grimace of distaste.‘You were right, of course - it was the only thing to do. Well, we didn’t botherto attach any weights - it floated for a few minutes - we watched to see if itwould clear the ship - and then…’The doctor seemed to be struggling for words.‘What, dammit?’‘Something came up out, of the water, Like a parrot beak, but about a hundredtimes bigger. It took - Rosie - with one snap, and disappeared. We have someimpressive company here; even if we could breathe outside, I certainly wouldn’trecommend swimming -’‘Bridge to Captain,’ said the officer on duty, ‘Big disturbance in the water -camera three - I’ll give you the picture.’‘That’s the thing I saw!’ cried the doctor. He felt a sudden chill at theinevitable, ominous thought: I hope it’s not back for more.Suddenly, a vast bulk broke through the surface of the ocean and arched into thesky. For a moment, the whole monstrous shape was suspended between air andwater.The familiar can be as shocking as the strange - when it is in the wrong place.Both captain and doctor exclaimed simultaneously: ‘It’s a shark!’There was just time to notice a few subtle differences - in addition to themonstrous parrot-beak - before the giant crashed back into the sea. There was anextra pair of fins - and there appeared to be no gills. Nor were there any eyes,but on either side of the beak there were curious protuberances that might besome other sense organs.‘Convergent evolution, of course,’ said the doctor. ‘Same problems, samesolutions, on any planet. Look at Earth. Sharks, dolphins, ichthyosaurs - alloceanic predators must have the same basic design. That beak puzzles me, though-’‘What’s it doing now?’The creature had surfaced again, but now it was moving very slowly, as ifexhausted after that one gigantic leap. In fact, it seemed to be in trouble -even in agony; it was beating its tail against the sea, without attempting tomove in any definite direction.Suddenly, it vomited its last meal, turned belly up, and lay wallowinglifelessly in the gentle swell.‘Oh my God,’ whispered the Captain, his voice full of revulsion. ‘I think I knowwhat’s happened.’‘Totally alien biochemistries,’ said the doctor; even he seemed shaken by thesight. ‘Rosie’s claimed one victim, after all.’The Sea of Galilee was, of course, named after the man who had discovered Europa- as he in turn had been named after a much smaller sea on another world.It was a very young sea, being less than fifty years old; and, like mostnew-born infants, could be quite boisterous. Although the Europan atmosphere wasstill too thin to generate real hurricanes, a steady wind blew from thesurrounding land towards the tropical zone at the point above which Lucifer wasstationary. Here, at the point of perpetual noon, the water was continuallyboiling - though at a temperature, in this thin atmosphere, barely hot enough tomake a good cup of tea.Luckily, the steamy, turbulent region immediately beneath Lucifer was a thousandkilometres away; Galaxy had descended in a relatively calm area, less than ahundred kilometres from the nearest land. At peak velocity, she could cover thatdistance in a fraction of a second; but now, as she drifted beneath thelow-hanging clouds of Europa’s permanent overcast, land seemed as far-off as theremotest quasar. To make matters worse - if possible - the eternal off-shorewind was taking her further out to sea. And even if she could manage to groundherself on some virgin beach of this new world, she might be no better off thanshe was now.But she would be more comfortable; spaceships, though admirably watertight, areseldom seaworthy. Galaxy was floating in a vertical position, bobbing up anddown with gentle but disturbing oscillations; half the crew was already sick.Captain Laplace’s first action, after he had been through the damage reports,was to appeal for anyone with experience in handling boats - of any size orshape. It seemed reasonable to suppose that among thirty astronautical engineersand space scientists there should be a considerable amount of seafaring talent,and he immediately located five amateur sailors and even one professional -Purser Frank Lee who had started his career with the Tsung shipping lines andthen switched to space.Although pursers were more accustomed to handling accounting machines (often, inFrank Lee’s case, a two-hundred-year-old ivory abacus) than navigationalinstruments, they still had to pass exams in basic seamanship. Lee had never hada chance of testing his maritime skills; now, almost a billion kilometres fromthe South China Sea, his time had come.‘We should flood the propellant tanks,’ he told the Captain. ‘Then we’ll ridelower and won’t be bobbing up and down so badly.’It seemed foolish to let even more water into the ship, and the Captainhesitated.‘Suppose we run aground?’No one made the obvious comment ‘What difference will it make?’ Without anyserious discussion, it had been assumed that they would be better off on land -if they could ever reach it.‘We can always blow the tanks again. We’ll have to do that anyway, when we reachshore, to get the ship into a horizontal position. Thank God we have power…’His voice trailed off; everyone knew what he meant. Without the auxiliaryreactor which was now running the life-support systems, they would all be deadwithin hours. Now - barring a breakdown - the ship could sustain themindefinitely.Ultimately, of course, they would starve; they had just had dramatic proof thatthere was no nourishment, but only poison, in the seas of Europa.At least they had made contact with Ganymede, so that the entire human race nowknew their predicament. The best brains in the Solar System would now be tryingto save them. If they failed, the passengers and crew of Galaxy would have theconsolation of dying in the full glare of publicity."},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREEIVAT THE WATER HOLE"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREE32"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREEDIVERSION‘The latest news,’ said Captain Smith to his assembled passengers, ‘is thatGalaxy is afloat, and in fairly good condition. One crew member - a womansteward - has been killed - we don’t know the details - but everyone else issafe.‘The ship’s systems are all working; there are a few leaks, but they’ve beencontrolled. Captain Laplace says there’s no immediate danger, but the prevailingwind is driving them further away from the mainland, towards the centre ofdayside. That’s not a serious problem - there are several large islands they’revirtually certain to reach first. At the moment they’re ninety kilometres fromthe nearest land. They’ve seen some large marine animals, but they show no signof hostility.‘Barring further accidents, they should be able to survive for several months,until they run out of food - which of course is now being strictly rationed. Butaccording to Captain Laplace, morale is still high.‘Now, this is where we come in. If we return to Earth immediately, get refuelledand refitted, we can reach Europa in a retrograde, powered orbit in eighty-fivedays. Universe is the only ship currently commissioned that can land there andtake off again with a reasonable payload. The Ganymede shuttles may be able todrop supplies, but that’s all - though it may make the difference between lifeand death.‘I’m sorry, ladies and gentlemen, that our visit has been cut short - but Ithink you’ll agree that we’ve shown you everything we promised. And I’m sureyou’ll approve of our new mission - even though the chances of success are,frankly, rather slim. That’s all for the moment. Dr Floyd, can I have a wordwith you?’As the others drifted slowly and thoughtfully from the main lounge - scene of somany less portentous briefings - the Captain scanned a clipboard full ofmessages. There were still occasions when words printed on pieces of paper werethe most convenient medium of communication, but even here technology had madeits mark. The sheets that the Captain was reading were made of the indefinitelyreusable multifax material which had done so much to reduce the load on thehumble wastepaper basket.‘Heywood,’ he said - now that the formalities were over - ‘as you can guess, thecircuits are burning up. And there’s a lot going on that I don’t understand.’‘Ditto,’ answered Floyd. ‘Anything from Chris yet?’“No, but Ganymede’s relayed your message; he should have had it by now. There’sa priority override on private communications, as you can imagine - but ofcourse your name overrode that.’‘Thanks, Skipper. Anything I can do to help?’‘Not really - I’ll let you know.’It was almost the last time, for quite a while, that they would be on speakingterms with each other. Within a few hours Dr Heywood Floyd would become ‘Thatcrazy old fool!’, and the short-lived ‘Mutiny on the Universe’ would have begun- led by the Captain.It was not actually Heywood Floyd’s idea; he only wished it was.Second Officer Roy Jolson was ‘Stars’, the navigation officer; Floyd barely knewhim by sight, and had never had occasion to say more than good morning to him.He was quite surprised, therefore, by the diffident knock on his cabin door.The astrogator was carrying a set of charts, and seemed a little ill at ease. Hecould not be overawed by Floyd’s presence - everyone on board now took him forgranted - so there must be some other reason.‘Dr Floyd,’ he began, in a tone of such urgent anxiety that he reminded hislistener of a salesman whose entire future depends on making the next deal. ‘I’dlike your advice - and assistance.’‘Of course - but what can I do?’Jolson unrolled the chart showing the position of all the planets inside theorbit of Lucifer.‘Your old trick of coupling Leonov and Discovery, to escape from Jupiter beforeit blew up, gave me the idea.’‘It wasn’t mine. Walter Curnow thought of it.’‘Oh - I never knew that. Of course, we don’t have another ship to boost us here- but we have something much better.’‘What do you mean?’ asked Floyd, completely baffled.‘Don’t laugh. Why go back to Earth to take on propellant - when Old Faithful isblasting out tons every second, a couple of hundred metres away? If we tappedthat, we could get to Europa not in three months - but in three weeks.’The concept was so obvious, yet so daring, that it took Floyd’s breath away. Hecould see half a dozen objections instantly; but none of them seemed fatal.‘What does the Captain think of the idea?’‘I’ve not told him; that’s why I need your help. I’d like you to check mycalculations - then put the idea to him. He’d turn me down - I’m quite certain -and I don’t blame him. If I was captain, I think I would too…’There was a long silence in the little cabin. Then Heywood Floyd said slowly:‘Let me give you all the reasons why it can’t be done. Then you can tell me whyI’m wrong.’Second Officer Jolson knew his commander; Captain Smith had never heard such acrazy suggestion in his life.His objections were all well-founded, and showed little, if any, trace of thenotorious ‘not invented here’ syndrome.‘Oh, it would work in theory,’ he admitted. ‘But think of the practicalproblems, man! How would you get the stuff into the tanks?’‘I’ve talked to the engineers. We’d move the ship to the edge of the crater -it’s quite safe to get within fifty metres. There’s plumbing in the unfurnishedsection we can rip out - then we’d run a line to Old Faithful and wait until hespouts; you know how reliable and well-behaved he is.’‘But our pumps can’t operate in a near vacuum!’‘We don’t need them; we can rely on the geyser’s own efflux velocity to give usan input of at least a hundred kilos a second. Old Faithful will do all thework.’‘He’ll just give ice crystals and steam, not liquid water.’‘It will condense when it gets on board.’‘You’ve really thought this out, haven’t you?’ said the Captain with grudgingadmiration. ‘But I just don’t believe it. Is the water pure enough, for onething? What about contaminants - especially carbon particles?’Floyd could not help smiling. Captain Smith was developing an obsession aboutsoot…‘We can filter out large ones; the rest won’t affect the reaction. Oh yes - thehydrogen isotope ratio here looks better than for Earth. You may even get someextra thrust.’‘What do your colleagues think of the idea? If we head straight for Lucifer, itmay be months before they can get home…‘I’ve not spoken to them. But does it matter, when so many lives are at stake?We may reach Galaxy seventy days ahead of schedule! Seventy days! Think whatcould happen on Europa in that time!’‘I’m perfectly aware of the time factor,’ snapped the Captain. ‘That applies tous as well. We may not have provisions for such an extended trip.’Now he’s straining at gnats, thought Floyd - and he must know that I know it.Better be tactful…‘An extra couple of weeks? I can’t believe we have so narrow a margin. You’vebeen feeding us too well, anyway. Do some of us good to be on short rations fora while.’The Captain managed a frosty smile.‘You can tell that to Willis and Mihailovich. But I’m afraid the whole idea isinsane.’‘At least let us try it on the owners. I’d like to speak to Sir Lawrence.’‘I can’t stop you, of course,’ said Captain Smith, in a tone that suggested hewished he could. ‘But I know exactly what he’ll say.’He was quite wrong.Sir Lawrence Tsung had not placed a bet for thirty years; it was no longer inkeeping with his august position in the world of commerce. But as a young man hehad often enjoyed a mild flutter at the Hong Kong Race Course, before apuritanical administration had closed it in a fit of public morality. It wastypical of life, Sir Lawrence sometimes thought wistfully, that when he couldbet he had no money - and now he couldn’t, because the richest man in the worldhad to set a good example.And yet, as nobody knew better than he did, his whole business career had beenone long gamble. He had done his utmost to control the odds, by gathering thebest information and listening to the experts his hunches told him would givethe wisest advice. He had usually pulled out in time when they were wrong; butthere had always been an element of risk.Now, as he read the memorandum from Heywood Floyd, he felt again the old thrillhe had not known since he had watched the horses thundering round into the lastlap. Here was a gamble indeed - perhaps the last and greatest of his career -though he would never dare tell his Board of Directors. Still less the LadyJasmine.‘Bill,’ he said, ‘what do you think?’His son (steady and reliable, but lacking that vital spark which was perhaps nolonger needed in this generation) gave him the answer he expected.‘The theory is quite sound. Universe can do it - on paper. But we’ve lost oneship. We’ll be risking another.’‘She’s going to Jupiter - Lucifer - anyway.’‘Yes - but after a complete checkout in Earth orbit. And do you realize whatthis proposed direct mission will involve? She’ll be smashing all speed records- doing over a thousand kilometres a second at turnaround!’It was the worst thing he could possibly have said; once again the thunder ofhooves sounded in his father’s ears.But Sir Lawrence merely answered: ‘It won’t do any harm for them to make sometests, though Captain Smith is fighting the idea tooth and nail. Even threatensto resign. Meanwhile, just check the position with Lloyd’s - we may have to backdown on the Galaxy claim.’Especially, he might have added, if we’re going to throw Universe on to thetable, as an even bigger chip.And he was worried about Captain Smith. Now that Laplace was stranded on Europa,he was the best commander he had left."},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREE33"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREEPIT STOP‘Sloppiest job I’ve seen since I left college,’ grumbled the Chief Engineer.‘But it’s the best we can do in the time.’The makeshift pipeline stretched across fifty metres of dazzling,chemical-encrusted rock to the now quiescent vent of Old Faithful, where itended in a rectangular, downward-pointing funnel. The sun had just risen overthe hills, and already the ground had begun to tremble slightly as the geyser’ssubterranean - or subhallean - reservoirs felt the first touch of warmth.Watching from the observation lounge, Heywood Floyd could hardly believe that somuch had happened in a mere twenty-four hours. First of all, the ship had splitinto two rival factions - one led by the Captain, the other perforce headed byhimself. They had been coldly polite to each other, and there had been no actualexchange of blows; but he had discovered that in certain quarters he nowrejoiced in the nickname of ‘Suicide’ Floyd. It was not an honour that heparticularly appreciated.Yet no-one could find anything fundamentally wrong with the Floyd-Jolsonmanoeuvre. (That name was also unfair: he had insisted that Jolson get all thecredit, but no-one had listened. And Mihailovich had said: ‘Aren’t you preparedto share the blame?’)The first test would be in twenty minutes, when Old Faithful, rather belatedly,greeted the dawn. But even if that worked, and the propellant tanks started tofill with sparkling pure water rather than the muddy slurry Captain Smith hadpredicted, the road to Europa was still not open.A minor, but not unimportant, factor was the wishes of the distinguishedpassengers. They had expected to be home within two weeks; now, to theirsurprise and in some cases consternation, they were faced with the prospect of adangerous mission halfway across the Solar System - and, even if it succeeded,no firm date for a return to Earth.Willis was distraught; all his schedules would be totally wrecked. He driftedaround muttering about lawsuits, but no-one expressed the slightest sympathy.Greenburg, on the other hand, was ecstatic; now he would really be in the spacebusiness again! And Mihailovich - who spent a lot of time noisily composing inhis far from soundproof cabin - was almost equally delighted. He was sure thatthe diversion would inspire him to new heights of creativity.Maggie M was philosophical: ‘If it can save a lot of lives,’ she said, lookingpointedly at Willis, ‘how can anyone possibly object?’As for Yva Merlin, Floyd made a special effort to explain matters to her, anddiscovered that she understood the situation remarkably well. And it was Yva, tohis utter astonishment, who asked the question to which no-one else seemed tohave paid much attention: ‘Suppose the Europans don’t want us to land - even torescue our friends?’Floyd looked at her in frank amazement; even now, he still found it difficult toaccept her as a real human being, and never knew when she would come out withsome brilliant insight or utter stupidity.‘That’s a very good question, Yva. Believe me, I’m working on it.’He was telling the truth; he could never lie to Yva Merlin. That, somehow, wouldbe an act of sacrilege.The first wisps of vapour were appearing over the mouth of the geyser. They shotupwards and away in their unnatural vacuum trajectories, and evaporated swiftlyin the fierce Sunlight.Old Faithful coughed again, and cleared its throat. A snowy-white - andsurprisingly compact - column of ice crystals and water droplets climbed swiftlytowards the sky. All one’s terrestrial instincts expected it to topple and fall,but of course it did not. It continued onwards and upwards, spreading onlyslightly, until it merged into the vast, glowing envelope of the comet’s stillexpanding coma. Floyd noted, with satisfaction, that the pipeline was beginningto shake as fluid rushed into it.Ten minutes later, there was a council of war on the bridge. Captain Smith,still in a huff, acknowledged Floyd’s presence with a slight nod; his NumberTwo, a little embarrassed, did all the talking.‘Well, it works, surprisingly well. At this rate, we can fill our tanks intwenty hours - though we may have to go out and anchor the pipe more securely.’‘What about the dirt?’ someone asked.The First Officer held up a transparent squeeze-bulb holding a colourlessliquid.‘The filters got rid of everything down to a few microns, To be on the safeside, we’ll run through them twice, cycling from one tank to another. Noswimming pool, I’m afraid, until we pass Mars.’That got a much needed laugh, and even the Captain relaxed a little.‘We’ll run up the engines, at minimum thrust, to check that there are nooperational anomalies with Halley H20. If there are, we’ll forget the wholeidea, and head home on good old Moon water, fob Aristarchus.’There was one of those ‘party silences’ where everyone waits simultaneously forsomeone else to speak. Then Captain Smith broke the embarrassing hiatus.‘As you all know,’ he said, ‘I’m very unhappy with the whole idea. In fact - ‘he changed course abruptly; it was equally well-known that he had consideredsending Sir Lawrence his resignation, though in the circumstances that wouldhave been a somewhat pointless gesture.‘But a couple of things have happened in the last few hours. The owner agreeswith the project - if no fundamental objections emerge from our tests. And -this is the big surprise, and I don’t know any more about it than you do - theWorld Space Council has not only okayed but requested that we make thediversion, underwriting any expenses incurred. Your guess is as good as mine…‘But I still have one worry -’ he looked doubtfully at the little bulb of water,which Heywood Floyd was now holding up to the light and shaking gently. ‘I’m anengineer, not a damn chemist. This stuff looks clean - but what will it do tothe tank linings?’Floyd never quite understood why he acted as he did; such rashness wascompletely uncharacteristic. Perhaps he was simply impatient with the wholedebate, and wanted to get on with the job. Or perhaps he felt that the Captainneeded a little stiffening of the moral fibre.With one quick movement, he flicked open the stopcock and squirted approximately20cc of Halley’s Comet down his throat.‘There’s your answer, Captain,’ he said, when he had finished swallowing.‘And that,’ said the ship’s doctor half an hour later, ‘was one of the silliestexhibitions I’ve ever seen. Don’t you know that there are cyanides and cyanogensand God knows what else in that stuff?’‘Of course, I do,’ laughed Floyd. ‘I’ve seen the analyses - just a few parts ina million. Nothing to worry about, But I did have one surprise,’ he addedruefully.‘And what was that?’‘If you could ship this stuff back to Earth, you could make a fortune selling itas Halley’s Patent Purgative.’"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREE34"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREECAR WASHNow that they were committed, the whole atmosphere aboard Universe had changed.There was no more argument; everyone was cooperating to the utmost, and very fewpeople had much sleep for the next two rotations of the nucleus - a hundredhours of Earth time.The first Halley ‘day’ was devoted to a still rather cautious tapping of OldFaithful, but when the geyser subsided towards nightfall the technique had beenthoroughly mastered. More than a thousand tons of water had been taken aboard;the next period of daylight would be ample for the rest.Heywood Floyd kept out of the Captain’s way, not wishing to press his luck; inany event, Smith had a thousand details to attend to. But the calculation of thenew orbit was not among them; that had been checked and rechecked on Earth.There was no doubt, now, that the concept was brilliant, and the savings evengreater than Jolson had claimed. By refuelling on Halley, Universe hadeliminated the two major orbit changes involved in the rendezvous with Earth;she could now go straight to her goal, under maximum acceleration, saving manyweeks. Despite the possible risks, everyone now applauded the scheme.Well, almost everyone.On Earth, the swiftly organized ‘Hands off Halley!’ society was indignant. Itsmembers (a mere 236, but they knew how to drum up publicity) did not considerthe rifling of a celestial body justified, even to save lives. They refused tobe placated even when it was pointed out that Universe was merely borrowingmaterial that the comet was about to lose anyway. It was, they argued, theprinciple of the thing. Their angry communiqués gave much needed light reliefaboard Universe.Cautious as ever, Captain Smith ran the first low-powered tests with one of theattitude-control thrusters; if this became unserviceable, the ship could managewithout it, There were no anomalies; the engine behaved exactly as if it wasrunning on the best distilled water from the lunar mines.Then he tested the central main engine, Number One; if that was damaged, therewould be no loss of manoeuvrability - only of total thrust. The ship would stillbe fully controllable, but, with the four remaining outboards alone, peakacceleration would be down by twenty per cent.Again, there were no problems; even the sceptics started being polite to HeywoodFloyd, and Second Officer Jolson was no longer a social outcast.The lift-off was scheduled late in the afternoon, just before Old Faithful wasdue to subside. (Would it still be there to greet the next visitors inseventy-six years’ time? Floyd wondered. Perhaps; there were hints of itsexistence even back on the 1910 photographs.)There was no countdown, in the dramatic oldtime Cape Canaveral style. When hewas quite satisfied that everything was shipshape, Captain Smith applied a merefive tons of thrust on Number One, and Universe drifted slowly upwards and awayfrom the comet.The acceleration was modest, but the pyrotechnics were awe-inspiring - and, tomost of the watchers, wholly unexpected. Until now, the jets from the mainengines had been virtually invisible, being formed entirely of highly ionizedoxygen and hydrogen. Even when - hundreds of kilometres away - the gases hadcooled off enough to combine chemically, there was still nothing to be seen,because the reaction gave no light in the visible spectrum.But now, Universe was climbing away from Halley on a column of incandescence toobrilliant for the eye to look upon; it seemed almost a solid pillar of flame.Where it hit the ground, rock exploded upwards and outwards; as it departed forever, Universe was carving its signature, like cosmic graffiti, across thenucleus of Halley’s Comet.Most of the passengers, accustomed to climbing spacewards with no visible meansof support, reacted with considerable shock. Floyd waited for the inevitableexplanation; one of his minor pleasures was catching Willis in some scientificerror, but this very seldom happened. And even when it did, Willis always hadsome very plausible excuse.‘Carbon,’ he said. ‘Incandescent carbon - exactly as in a candle flame - butslightly hotter.’‘Slightly,’ murmured Floyd.‘We’re no longer burning - if you’ll excuse the word -, (Floyd shrugged hisshoulders) ‘pure water. Although it’s been carefully filtered, there’s a lot ofcolloidal carbon in it. As well as compounds that could only be removed bydistillation.’‘It’s very impressive, but I’m a little worried,’ said Greenburg. ‘All thatradiation - won’t it affect the engines - and heat the ship badly?’It was a very good question, and it had caused some anxiety. Floyd waited forWillis to handle it; but that shrewd operator bounced the ball right back tohim.‘I’d prefer Dr Floyd to deal with that - after all, it was his idea.’‘Jolson’s, please. Good point, though. But it’s no real problem; when we’reunder full thrust, all those fireworks will be a thousand kilometres behind us.We won’t have to worry about them.’The ship was now hovering some two kilometres above the nucleus; had it not beenfor the glare of the exhaust, the whole sunlit face of the tiny world would havebeen spread out beneath. At this altitude - or distance - the column of OldFaithful had broadened slightly. It looked, Floyd suddenly recalled, like one ofthe giant fountains ornamenting Lake Geneva. He had not seen them for fiftyyears, and wondered if they still played there.Captain Smith was testing the controls, slowly rotating the ship, then pitchingand yawing it along the Y and Z axes. Everything seemed to be functioningperfectly.‘Mission time zero is ten minutes from now,’ he announced. ‘0.1 gee for fiftyhours; then 0.2 until turnaround - one hundred and fifty hours from now.’ Hepaused to let that sink in; no other ship had ever attempted to maintain so higha continuous acceleration, for so long. If Universe was not able to brakeproperly, she would also enter the history books as the first mannedinterstellar voyager.The ship was now turning towards the horizontal - if that word could be used inthis almost gravityless environment - and was pointing directly to the whitecolumn of mist and ice crystals still steadily spurting from the comet. Universestarted to move towards it -‘What’s he doing?’ said Mihailovich anxiously.Obviously anticipating such questions, the Captain spoke again. He seemed tohave completely recovered his good humour, and there was a hint of amusement inhis voice.‘Just one little chore before we leave, Don’t worry - I know exactly what I’mdoing. And Number Two agrees with me - don’t you?’‘Yessir - though I thought you were joking at first.’‘What is going on up on the bridge?’ asked Willis, for once at a loss.Now the ship was starting a slow roll, while still moving at no more than a goodwalking speed towards the geyser. From this distance - now less than a hundredmetres - it reminded Floyd still more closely of those far-off Geneva fountains.Surely he’s not taking us into it - But he was. Universe vibrated gently as itnuzzled its way into the rising column of foam. It was still rolling veryslowly, as if it was drilling its way into the giant geyser. The video monitorsand observation windows showed only a milky blankness.The whole operation could not have lasted more than ten seconds; then they wereout on the other side. There was a brief burst of spontaneous clapping from theofficers on the bridge; but the passengers - even including Floyd - still feltsomewhat put-upon.‘Now we’re ready to go,’ said the Captain, in tones of great satisfaction. ‘Wehave a nice, clean ship again.’During the next half-hour, more than ten thousand amateur observers on Earth andMoon reported that the comet had doubled its brightness. The Comet Watch Networkbroke down completely under the overload, and the professional astronomers werefurious.But the public loved it, and a few days later Universe put on an even bettershow, a few hours before dawn.The ship, gaining speed by more than ten thousand kilometres an hour, everyhour, was now far inside the orbit of Venus. It would get even closer to the sunbefore it made its perihelion passage - far more swiftly than any naturalcelestial body - and headed out towards Lucifer.As it passed between Earth and Sun, the thousand kilometre tail of incandescentcarbon was easily visible as a fourth magnitude star, showing appreciablemovement against the constellations of the morning sky in the course of a singlehour. At the very beginning of its rescue mission, Universe would be seen bymore human beings, at the same moment, than any artefact in the history of theworld."},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREE35"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREEADRIFTThe unexpected news that their sister ship Universe was on the way - and mightarrive far sooner than anyone had dared to dream - had an effect upon the moraleof Galaxy’s crew that could only be called euphoric. The mere fact that theywere drifting helplessly on a strange ocean, surrounded by unknown monsters,suddenly seemed of minor importance.As did the monsters themselves, though they made interesting appearances fromtime to time. The giant ’sharks’ were sighted occasionally, but never came nearthe ship, even when garbage was dumped overboard. This was quite surprising; itstrongly suggested that the great beasts - unlike their terrestrial counterparts- had a good system of communication. Perhaps they were more closely allied todolphins than to sharks.There were many schools of smaller fish, which no-one would have given a secondglance in a market on Earth. After several attempts, one of the officers - akeen angler - managed to catch one with an unbaited hook. He never brought it inthrough the airlock - the Captain would not have permitted it, anyway - butmeasured and photographed it carefully before returning it to the sea.The proud sportsman had to pay a price for his trophy, however. Thepartial-pressure spacesuit he had worn during the exercise had thecharacteristic ‘rotten eggs’ stink of hydrogen sulphide when he brought it backinto the ship, and he became the butt of innumerable jokes. It was yet anotherreminder of an alien, and implacably hostile, biochemistry.Despite the pleas of the scientists, no further angling was allowed. They couldwatch and record, but not collect, And anyway, it was pointed out, they wereplanetary geologists, not naturalists. No-one had thought of bringing formalin -which probably would not work here in any event.Once, the ship drifted for several hours through floating mats or sheets of somebright green material. It formed ovals, about ten metres across, and all ofapproximately the same size, Galaxy ploughed through them without resistance,and they swiftly reformed behind her. It was guessed that they were colonialorganisms of some kind.And one morning, the officer of the watch was startled when a periscope rose outof the water and he found himself staring into a mild, blue eye which, he saidwhen he had recovered, looked like a sick cow’s. It regarded him sadly for a fewmoments, without much apparent interest, then slowly returned to the ocean,Nothing seemed to move very fast here, and the reason was obvious. This wasstill a low-energy world - there was none of the free oxygen that allowed theanimals of Earth to live by a series of continuous explosions, from the momentthey started to breathe at birth. Only the ’shark’ of that first encounter hadshown any sign of violent activity - in its last, dying spasm.Perhaps that was good news for men. Even if they were encumbered withspacesuits, there was probably nothing on Europa that could catch them -even ifit wanted to.Captain Laplace found wry amusement in handing over the operation of his ship tothe purser; he wondered if this situation was unique, in the annals of space andsea.Not that there was a great deal that Mr Lee could do. Galaxy was floatingvertically, one-third out of the water, heeling slightly before a wind that wasdriving it at a steady five knots. There were only a few leaks below thewaterline, easily handled. Equally important, the hull was still airtight.Although most of the navigation equipment was useless, they knew exactly wherethey were. Ganymede gave them an accurate fix on their emergency beacon everyhour, and if Galaxy kept to her present course she would make landfall on alarge island within the next three days. If she missed that, she would head onout to the open sea, and eventually reach the tepidly boiling zone immediatelyunderneath Lucifer. Though not necessarily catastrophic, that was a mostunattractive prospect; Acting Captain Lee spent much of his time thinking ofways to avoid it.Sails - even if he had suitable material and rigging - would make very littledifference to their course. He had lowered improvised sea-anchors down to fivehundred metres, looking for currents that might be useful, and finding none. Norhad he found the bottom; it lay unknown kilometres further down.Perhaps that was just as well; it protected them from the submarine quakes thatcontinually. racked this new ocean. Sometimes Galaxy would shake as if struck bya giant hammer, as a shockwave went racing by. In a few hours, a tsunami, dozensof metres high, would crash upon some Europan shore; but here in deep water thedeadly waves were little more than ripples.Several times, sudden vortexes were observed at a distance; they looked quitedangerous - maelstroms that might even suck Galaxy down to unknown depths - butluckily they were too far off to do more than make the ship spin around a fewtimes in the water.And just once, a huge bubble of gas rose and burst only a hundred metres away.It was most impressive, and everyone seconded the doctor’s heartfelt comment:‘Thank God we can’t smell it.’It is surprising how quickly the most bizarre situation can become routine.Within a few days, life aboard Galaxy had settled down to a steady routine, andCaptain Laplace’s main problem was keeping the crew occupied. There was nothingworse for morale than idleness, and he wondered how the skippers of the oldwindjammers had kept their men busy on those interminable voyages. They couldn’thave spent all their time scrambling up the rigging or cleaning the decks.He had the opposite problem with the scientists. They were always proposingtests and experiments, which had to be carefully considered before they could beapproved. And if he allowed it, they would have monopolized the ship’s now verylimited communications channels.The main antenna complex was now being battered around at the waterline, andGalaxy could no longer talk directly to Earth. Everything had to be relayedthrough Ganymede, on a bandwidth of a few miserable megahertz. A single livevideo channel pre-empted everything else, and he had to resist the clamour ofthe terrestrial networks. Not that they would have a great deal to show theiraudiences, except open sea, cramped ship interiors, and a crew which, though ingood spirits, was becoming steadily more hirsute.An unusual amount of traffic seemed directed to Second Officer Floyd whoseencrypted responses were so brief that they could not have contained muchinformation. Laplace finally decided to have a talk to the young man.‘Mr Floyd,’ he said, in the privacy of his cabin. ‘I’d appreciate it if youwould enlighten me about your part-time occupation.’Floyd looked embarrassed, and clutched at the table as the ship rocked slightlyin a sudden gust.‘I wish I could, sir, but I’m not permitted.’‘By whom, may I ask?’‘Frankly, I’m not sure.’That was perfectly true. He suspected it was ASTROPOL, but the two quietlyimpressive gentlemen who had briefed him on Ganymede had unaccountably failed toprovide this information.‘As captain of this ship - especially in the present circumstances - I wouldlike to know what’s going on here. If we get out of this, I’m going to spend thenext few years of my life at Courts of Enquiry. And you’ll probably be doing thesame.’Floyd managed a wry grin.‘Hardly worth being rescued, is it, Sir? All I know is that some high-levelagency expected trouble on this mission, but didn’t know what form it wouldtake. I was just told to keep my eyes open. I’m afraid I didn’t do much good,but I imagine I was the only qualified person they could get hold of in time.’‘I don’t think you can blame yourself. Who would have imagined that Rosie -’The Captain paused, struck by a sudden thought.‘Do you suspect anyone else?’ He felt like adding ‘Me, for instance?’, but thesituation was already sufficiently paranoiac.Floyd looked thoughtful, then apparently came to a decision.‘Perhaps I should have spoken to you before, Sir, but I know how busy you’vebeen. I’m sure Dr van der Berg is involved somehow. He’s a Mede, of course;they’re odd people, and I don’t really understand them.’ Or like them, he mighthave added. Too clannish - not really friendly to offworlders. Still, one couldhardly blame them; all pioneers trying to tame a new wilderness were probablymuch the same.‘Van der Berg - hmm. What about the other scientists?’‘They’ve been checked, of course. All perfectly legitimate, and nothing unusualabout any of them.’That was not altogether true. Dr Simpson had more wives than was strictly legal,at least at one time, and Dr Higgins had a large collection of most curiousbooks. Second Officer Floyd was not quite sure why he had been told all this;perhaps his mentors merely wanted to impress him with their omniscience. Hedecided that working for ASTROPOL (or whoever it was) had some entertainingfringe benefits.‘Very well,’ said the Captain, dismissing the amateur agent. ‘But please keep meinformed if you discover anything - anything at all- that might affect thesafety of the ship.’In the present circumstances, it was hard to imagine what that might be. Anyfurther hazards seemed slightly superfluous."},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREE36"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREETHE ALIEN SHOREEven twenty-four hours before they sighted the island, it was still not certainwhether Galaxy would miss it and be blown on out into the emptiness of thecentral ocean. Her position, as observed by the Ganymede radar, was plotted on alarge chart which everyone aboard examined anxiously several times a day.Even if the ship did reach land, her problems might be just beginning. She mightbe pounded to pieces on a rocky coast, rather than gently deposited on someconveniently shelving beach.Acting Captain Lee was keenly aware of all these possibilities. He had once beenshipwrecked himself, in a cabin cruiser whose engines had failed at a criticalmoment, off the island of Bali. There had been little danger, though a good dealof drama, and he had no wish to repeat the experience - especially as there wasno coastguard here to come to the rescue.There was a truly cosmic irony in their plight. Here they were, aboard one ofthe most advanced transportation devices ever made by man - capable of crossingthe Solar System! - yet now they could not deflect it more than a few metresfrom its course. Nevertheless, they were not completely helpless; Lee still hada few cards to play.On this sharply curving world, the island was only five kilometres away whenthey first sighted it. To Lee’s great relief, there were none of the cliffs hehad feared; nor, on the other hand, was there any sign of the beach he had hopedfor. The geologists had warned him that he was a few million years too early tofind sand here; the mills of Europa, grinding slowly, had not yet had time to dotheir work.As soon as it was certain they would hit the land, Lee gave orders to pump outGalaxy’s main tanks, which he had deliberately flooded soon after touchdown.Then followed a very uncomfortable few hours, during which at least a quarter ofthe crew took no further interest in the proceedings.Galaxy rose higher and higher in the water, oscillating more and more wildly -then tumbled with a mighty splash, to lie along the surface, like the corpse ofa whale in the bad old days when the catcher-boats pumped them full of air tostop them sinking. When he saw how the ship was lying, Lee adjusted her buoyancyagain, until she was slightly stern-down, and the forward bridge was just clearof the water.As he expected, Galaxy then swung broadside-on to the wind. Another quarter ofthe crew became incapacitated then, but Lee had enough helpers to get out thesea-anchor he had prepared for this final act. It was merely an improvised raft,made of empty boxes lashed together, but its drag caused the ship to pointtowards the approaching land.Now they could see that they were heading - with agonizing slowness - towards anarrow stretch of beach, covered with small boulders. If they could not havesand, this was the best alternative…The bridge was already over the beach when Galaxy grounded, and Lee played hislast card. He had made only a single test-run, not daring to do more in case theabused machinery failed.For the last time, Galaxy extended her landing gear. There was a grinding andshuddering as the pads on the underside dug their way into the alien beach. Nowshe was securely anchored against the winds and waves of this tideless ocean.There was no doubt that Galaxy had found her final resting place - and, all toopossibly, that of her crew."},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREEVTHROUGH THE ASTEROIDS"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREE37"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREESTARAnd now Universe was moving so swiftly that its orbit no longer even remotelyresembled that of any natural object in the Solar System. Mercury, closest tothe Sun, barely exceeds fifty kilometres a second at perihelion; Universe hadreached twice that speed in the first day - and at only half the acceleration itwould achieve when it was lighter by several thousand tons of water.For a few hours, as they passed inside its orbit, Venus was the brightest of allheavenly bodies, next to the Sun and Lucifer. Its tiny disc was just visible tothe naked eye, but even the ship’s most powerful telescopes showed no markingswhatever. Venus guarded her secrets as jealously as Europa.By going still closer to the Sun - well inside the orbit of Mercury - Universewas not merely taking a short cut, but was also getting a free boost from theSun’s gravitational field. Because nature always balances her books, the Sunlost some velocity in the transaction; but the effect would not be measurablefor a few thousand years.Captain Smith used the ship’s perihelion passage to restore some of the prestigehis foot-dragging had cost him.‘Now you know,’ he said, ‘exactly why I flew the ship through Old Faithful. Ifwe hadn’t washed all that dirt off the hull, by this time we’d be badlyoverheating. In fact, I doubt if the thermal controls would have handled theload - it’s already ten times Earth level.’ Looking - through filters that werealmost black - at the hideously swollen Sun, his passengers could easily believehim. They were all more than happy when it had shrunk back to normal size - andcontinued to dwindle astern as Universe sliced across the orbit of Mars, outwardbound on the final leg of its mission.The ‘Famous Five’ had all adjusted, in their various ways, to the unexpectedchange in their lives. Mihailovich was composing copiously and noisily, and wasseldom seen except when he emerged at meals, to tell outrageous stories andtease all available victims, especially Willis. Greenburg had elected himself,no-one dissenting, an honorary crew member, and spent much of his time on thebridge.Maggie M viewed the situation with rueful amusement.‘Writers,’ she remarked, ‘are always saying what a lot of work they could do ifthey were only in some place with no interruptions - no engagements; lighthousesand prisons are their favourite examples. So I can’t complain - except that myrequests for research material keep getting delayed by high priority messages.’Even Victor Willis had now come to much the same conclusion; he too was busilyat work on sundry long-range projects. And he had an additional reason to keepto his cabin. It would still be several weeks before he looked as if he hadforgotten to shave, and months before he returned to his full glory.Yva Merlin spent hours every day in the entertainment centre, catching up - asshe readily explained - with her favourite classics. It was fortunate thatUniverse’s library and projection facilities had been installed in time for thevoyage; though the collection was still relatively small, there was sufficientfor several lifetimes of viewing.All the famous works of visual art were there, right back to the flickering dawnof the cinema. Yva knew most of them, and was happy to share her knowledge.Floyd, of course, enjoyed listening to her, because then she became alive - anordinary human being, not an icon. He found it both sad and fascinating thatonly through an artificial universe of video images could she establish contactwith the real world.One of the strangest experiences of Heywood Floyd’s fairly eventful life wassitting in semi-darkness just behind Yva, somewhere outside the orbit of Mars,while they watched the original Gone with the Wind together. There were momentswhen he could see her famous profile silhouetted against that of Vivien Leigh,and could compare the two - though it was impossible to say that one actress wasbetter than the other; both were sui generis.When the lights went up, he was astonished to see that Yva was crying. He tookher hand and said tenderly: ‘I cried too, when Bonny died.’Yva managed a faint smile.‘I was really crying for Vivien,’ she said. ‘While we were shooting Two, I reada lot about her - she had such a tragic life. And talking about her, right outhere between the planets, reminds me of something that Larry said when hebrought the poor thing back from Ceylon after her nervous breakdown. He told hisfriends: “I’ve married a woman from outer space.”Yva paused for a moment, and another tear trickled (rather theatrically, Floydcould not help thinking) down her cheek.‘And here’s something even stranger. She made her last movie exactly a hundredyears ago - and do you know what it was?’‘Go on - surprise me again.’‘I expect it will surprise Maggie - if she’s really writing the book she keepsthreatening us with. Vivien’s very last film was - Ship of Fools.’"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREE38"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREEICEBERGS OF SPACENow that they had so much unexpected time on their hands, Captain Smith hadfinally agreed to give Victor Willis the long-delayed interview which was partof his contract. Victor himself had kept putting it off, owing to whatMihailovich persisted in calling his ‘amputation’. As it would be many monthsbefore he could regenerate his public image, he had finally decided to do theinterview off-camera; the studio on Earth could fake him in later with libraryshots.They had been sitting in the Captain’s still only partly furnished cabin,enjoying one of the excellent wines which apparently made up much of Victor’sbaggage allowance. As Universe would cut its drive and start coasting within thenext few hours, this would be the last opportunity for several days. Weightlesswine, Victor maintained, was an abomination; he refused to put any of hisprecious vintage into plastic squeezebulbs.‘This is Victor Willis, aboard the spaceship Universe at 18.30 on Friday, 15July 2061. Though we’re not yet at the mid-point of our journey, we’re alreadyfar beyond the orbit of Mars, and have almost reached our maximum velocity.Which is, Captain?’‘One thousand and fifty kilometres a second.’‘More than a thousand kilometres a second -almost four million kilometres anhour!’Victor Willis’ surprise sounded perfectly genuine; no-one would have guessedthat he knew the orbital parameters almost as well as did the Captain. But oneof his strengths was his ability to put himself in the place of his viewers, andnot only to anticipate their questions, but to arouse their interest.‘That’s right,’ the Captain answered with quiet pride. ‘We are travelling twiceas fast as any human beings since the beginning of time.’That should have been one of my lines, thought Victor; he did not like hissubject to get ahead of him. But, good professional that he was, he quicklyadapted.He pretended to consult his famous little memo pad, with its sharply directionalscreen whose display only he could see.‘Every twelve seconds, we’re travelling the diameter of Earth. Yet it will stilltake us another ten days to reach Jupi - ah, Lucifer! That gives some idea ofthe scale of the Solar System.‘Now, Captain, this is a delicate subject, but I’ve had a lot of questions aboutit during the last week.’Oh no, groaned Smith. Not the zero gravity toilets again!‘At this very moment, we are passing right through the heart of the asteroidbelt -’(I wish it was the toilets, thought Smith…)‘- and though no spaceship has ever been seriously damaged by a collision,aren’t we taking quite a risk? After all, there are literally millions ofbodies, down to the size of beachballs, orbiting in this section of space. Andonly a few thousand have been charted.’‘More than a few: over ten thousand.’‘But there are millions we don’t know about.’‘That’s true; but it wouldn’t help us much if we did.’‘What do you mean?’‘There’s nothing we can do about them.’‘Why not?’Captain Smith paused for careful thought. Willis was right - this was indeed adelicate subject; Head Office would rap his knuckles smartly, if he saidanything to discourage potential customers.‘First of all, space is so enormous that even here - as you said, right in theheart of the asteroid belt - the chance of collision is - infinitesimal. We’vebeen hoping to show you an asteroid - the best we can do is Hanuman, a miserablethree hundred metres across - but the nearest we get to it is a quarter of amillion kilometres.’‘But Hanuman is gigantic, compared to all the unknown debris that’s floatingaround out here. Aren’t you worried about that?’‘About as worried as you are, at being struck by lightning on Earth.’‘As a matter of fact, I once had a narrow escape, on Pike’s Peak in Colorado -the flash and the bang were simultaneous. But you admit that the danger doesexist - and aren’t we increasing the risk, by the enormous speed at which we’retravelling?’Willis, of course, knew the answer perfectly well; once again he was puttinghimself in the place of his legions of unknown listeners on the planet that wasgetting a thousand kilometres further away with every passing second.‘It’s hard to explain without mathematics,’ said the Captain (how many times hehad used that phrase. Even when it wasn’t true!), ‘but there’s no simplerelationship between speed and risk. To hit anything at spacecraft velocitieswould be catastrophic; if you’re standing next to an atomic bomb when it goesoff, it makes no difference whether it’s in the kiloton or megaton class.’That was not exactly a reassuring statement, but it was the best he could do.Before Willis could press the point further, he continued hastily:‘And let me remind you that any - er - slight extra risk we may be running is inthe best of causes. A single hour may save lives.’‘Yes, I’m sure we all appreciate that.’ Willis paused; he thought of adding‘And, of course, I’m in the same boat’, but decided against it. It might soundimmodest - not that modesty had ever been his strong suit. And anyway, he couldhardly make a virtue of a necessity; he had very little alternative now, unlesshe decided to walk home.‘All this,’ he continued, ‘brings me to another point. Do you know what happenedjust a century and a half ago, on the North Atlantic?’‘In 1911?’‘Well, actually 1912 -’Captain Smith guessed what was coming, and stubbornly refused to cooperate bypretending ignorance.‘I suppose you mean the Titanic,’ he said.‘Precisely,’ answered Willis, gamely concealing his disappointment. ‘I’ve had atleast twenty reminders from people who think they’re the only one who’s spottedthe parallel.’‘What parallel? The Titanic was running unacceptable risks, merely trying tobreak a record.’He almost added ‘And she didn’t have enough lifeboats’, but luckily checkedhimself in time, when he recalled that the ship’s one and only shuttle couldcarry not more than five passengers. If Willis took him up on that, it wouldinvolve altogether too many explanations.‘Well, I grant that the analogy is far-fetched. But there’s another strikingparallel which everyone points out. Do you happen to know the name of theTitanic’s first and last Captain?’‘I haven’t the faintest - ‘ began Captain Smith. Then his jaw dropped.‘Precisely,’ said Victor Willis, with a smile which it would be charitable tocall smug.Captain Smith would willingly have strangled all those amateur researchers. Buthe could hardly blame his parents for bequeathing him the commonest of Englishnames."},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREE39"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREETHE CAPTAIN’S TABLEIt was a pity that viewers on (and off) Earth could not have enjoyed the lessformal discussions aboard Universe. Shipboard life had now settled down to asteady routine, punctuated by a few regular landmarks - of which the mostimportant, and certainly the most long-established, was the traditional‘Captain’s Table’.At 18.00 hours exactly, the six passengers, and five of the officers not onduty, would join Captain Smith for dinner. There was, of course, none of theformal dress that had been mandatory aboard the floating palaces of the NorthAtlantic, but there was usually some attempt at sartorial novelty. Yva couldalways be relied upon to produce some new brooch, ring, necklace, hair-ribbon,or perfume from an apparently inexhaustible supply.If the drive was on, the meal would begin with soup; but if the ship wascoasting and weightless, there would be a selection of hors-d’oeuvres. In eitherevent, before the main course was served Captain Smith would report the latestnews - or try to dispel the latest rumours, usually fuelled by newscasts fromEarth or Ganymede.Accusations and countercharges were flying in all directions, and the mostfantastic theories had been proposed to account for Galaxy’s hijacking. A fingerhad been pointed at every secret organization known to exist, and many that werepurely imaginary. All the theories, however, had one thing in common. Not one ofthem could suggest a plausible motive.The mystery had been compounded by the one fact which had emerged. Strenuousdetective work by ASTROPOL had established the surprising fact that the late‘Rose McCullen’ was really Ruth Mason, born in North London, recruited to theMetropolitan Police - and then, after a promising start, dismissed for racistactivities. She had emigrated to Africa - and vanished. Obviously, she hadbecome involved in that unlucky continent’s political underground. SHAKA wasfrequently mentioned, and as frequently denied by the USSA.What all this could possibly have to do with Europa was endlessly, andfruitlessly, debated around the table - especially when Maggie M confessed thatat one time she had been planning a novel about Shaka, from the viewpoint of oneof his thousand unfortunate wives. But the more she researched the project, themore repellent it became. ‘By the time I abandoned Shaka,’ she wryly admitted,‘I knew exactly what a modern German feels about Hitler.’Such personal revelations became more and more common as the voyage proceeded.When the main meal was over, one of the group would be given the floor forthirty minutes. Between them; they had a dozen lifetimes of experience, on asmany heavenly bodies, so it would be hard to find a better source ofafter-dinner tales.The least effective speaker was, somewhat surprisingly, Victor Willis. He wasfrank enough to admit it, and to give the reason.‘I’m so used,’ he said, almost but not quite apologetically, ‘to performing foran audience of millions that I find it hard to interact with a friendly littlegroup like this.’‘Could you do better if it wasn’t friendly?’ asked Mihailovich, always anxiousto be helpful. ‘That could easily be arranged.’Yva, on the other hand, turned out to be better than expected, even though hermemories were confined entirely to the world of entertainment. She wasparticularly good on the famous - and infamous - directors she had worked with,especially David Griffin.‘Was it true,’ asked Maggie M, doubtless thinking of Shaka, ‘that he hatedwomen?’‘Not at all,’ Yva answered promptly. ‘He just hated actors. He didn’t believethey were human beings.’Mihailovich’s reminiscences also covered a somewhat limited territory - thegreat orchestras and ballet companies, famous conductors and composers, andtheir innumerable hangers-on. But he was so full of hilarious stories ofbackstage intrigues and liaisons, and accounts of sabotaged first nights andmortal feuds among prima donnas, that he kept even his most unmusical listenersconvulsed with laughter, and was willingly granted extra time.Colonel Greenburg’s matter-of-fact accounts of extraordinary events could hardlyhave provided a greater contrast. The first landing at Mercury’s - relatively -temperate south pole had been so thoroughly reported that there was little newto be said about it; the question that interested everyone was:‘When will we return?’ That was usually followed by: ‘Would you like to goback?’‘If they ask me to, of course I’ll go,’ Greenburg answered. ‘But I rather thinkthat Mercury is going to be like the Moon. Remember - we landed there in 1969 -and didn’t go back again for half a lifetime. Anyway, Mercury isn’t as useful asthe Moon - though perhaps one day it may be. There’s no water there; of course,it was quite a surprise to find any on the Moon. Or I should say in the Moon.‘Though it wasn’t as glamorous as landing on Mercury, I did a more important jobsetting up the Aristarchus Mule-train.’‘Mule-train?’‘Yep. Before the big equatorial launcher was built, and they started shootingthe ice straight into orbit, we had to haul it from the pit-head to the ImbriumSpaceport. That meant levelling a road across the lava plains and bridging quitea few crevasses. The Ice Road, we called it - only three hundred kilometres, butit took several lives to build…‘The “mules” were eight-wheeled tractors with huge tyres and independentsuspension: they towed up to a dozen trailers, with a hundred tons of iceapiece. Used to travel by night - no need to shield the cargo then.‘I rode with them several times. The trip took about six hours - we weren’t outto break speed records - then the ice would be offloaded into big, pressurizedtanks, waiting for sunrise. As soon as it melted, it would be pumped into theships.‘The Ice Road is still there, of course, but only the tourists use it now. Ifthey’re sensible, they’ll drive by night, as we used to do. It was pure magic,with the full Earth almost directly overhead, so brilliant that we seldom usedour own lights. And although we could talk to our friends whenever we wanted to,we often switched off the radio and left it to the automatics to tell them wewere OK. We just wanted to be alone, in that great shining emptiness - while itwas still there, because we knew it wouldn’t last.‘Now they’re building the Teravolt quarksmasher, running right around theequator, and domes are going up all over Imbrium and Serenitatis. But we knewthe real lunar wilderness, exactly as Armstrong and Aldrin saw it - before youcould buy “Wish you were here” cards in the post office at Tranquillity Base.’"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREE40"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREEMONSTERS FROM EARTH‘… lucky you missed the Annual Ball: believe it or not, it was just as grisly aslast year’s.

It was all so long ago - and there wasnothing he had not said a hundred times to Congressional Committees, SpaceCouncil boards and media persons like Victor Willis.Nevertheless, he had a duty to his fellow passengers which could not be avoided.As the only living man to have witnessed the birth of a new sun - and a newsolar system - they expected him to have some special understanding of theworlds they were now so swiftly approaching. It was a naïve assumption; he couldtell them far less about the Galilean satellites than the scientists andengineers who had been working there for more than a generation. When he wasasked ‘What’s it really like on Europa?’ (or Ganymede, or Io, or Callisto…) hewas liable to refer the enquirer, rather brusquely, to the voluminous reportsavailable in the ship’s library.Yet there was one area where his experience was unique. Half a century later, hesometimes wondered if it had really happened, or whether he had been asleepaboard Discovery when David Bowman had appeared to him. Almost easier to believethat a spaceship could be haunted…But he could not have been dreaming, when the floating dust motes assembledthemselves into that ghostly image of a man who should have been dead for adozen years. Without the warning it had given him (how clearly he rememberedthat its lips were motionless, and the voice had come from the console speaker)Leonov and all aboard would have been vaporized in the detonation of Jupiter.‘Why did he do it?’ Floyd asked during one of the after-dinner sessions. ‘I’vepuzzled over that for fifty years. Whatever he became, after he went out inDiscovery’s space pod to investigate the monolith, he must still have had somelinks with the human race; he was not completely alien. We know that he returnedto Earth - briefly - because of that orbiting bomb incident. And there’s strongevidence that he visited both his mother and his old girlfriend; that’s not theaction of - of an entity that had discarded all emotions.’‘What do you suppose he is now?’ asked Willis. ‘For that matter - where is he?’‘Perhaps that last question has no meaning - even for human beings. Do you knowwhere your consciousness resides?’‘I’ve no use for metaphysics. Somewhere in the general area of my brain,anyway.’‘When I was a young man,’ sighed Mihailovich, who had a talent for deflating themost serious discussions, ‘mine was about a metre lower down.’‘Let’s assume he’s on Europa; we know there’s a monolith there, and Bowman wascertainly associated with it in some way - see how he relayed that warning.’‘Do you think he also relayed the second one, telling us to stay away?’‘Which we are now going to ignore -’‘ in a good cause -’ Captain Smith, who was usually content to let thediscussion go where it wished, made one of his rare interjections.‘Dr Floyd,’ he said thoughtfully, ‘you’re in a unique position, and we shouldtake advantage of it. Bowman went out of his way to help you once. If he’s stillaround, he may be willing to do so again. I worry a good deal about that ATTEMPTNO LANDINGS HERE order. If he could assure us that it was - temporarilysuspended, let’s say - I’d be much happier.’There were several ‘hear, hear’s around the table before Floyd answered.‘Yes, I’ve been thinking along the same lines. I’ve already told Galaxy to watchout for any - let’s say manifestations - in case he tries to make contact.’‘Of course,’ said Yva, ‘he may be dead by now - if ghosts can die.’Not even Mihailovich had a suitable comment to this, but Yva obviously sensedthat no-one thought much of her contribution.Undeterred, she tried again.‘Woody, dear,’ she said. ‘Why don’t you simply give him a call on the radio?That’s what it’s for, isn’t it?’The idea had occurred to Floyd, but it had somehow seemed too naïve to takeseriously.‘I will,’ he said. ‘I don’t suppose it will do any harm.’"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREE42"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREEMINILITHThis time, Floyd was quite sure he was dreaming…He had never been able to sleep well in zero gravity, and Universe was nowcoasting, unpowered, at maximum velocity. In two days it would start almost aweek of steady deceleration, throwing away its enormous excess speed until itwas able to rendezvous with Europa.However many times he adjusted the restraining straps, they always seemed eithertoo tight or too loose. He would have difficulty in breathing - or else he wouldfind himself drifting out of his bunk.Once he had awoken in mid-air, and had flailed away for several minutes until,exhausted, he had managed to ’swim’ the few metres to the nearest wall. Notuntil then had he remembered that he should merely have waited; the roomventilating system would have soon pulled him to the exhaust grille without anyexertion on his part. As a seasoned space-traveller, he knew this perfectlywell; his only excuse was simple panic.But tonight, he had managed to get everything right; probably when weightreturned, he would have difficulty in readjusting to that. He had lain awake foronly a few minutes, recapitulating the latest discussion at dinner, and had thenfallen asleep.In his dreams, he had continued the conversation around the table. There hadbeen a few trifling changes, which he accepted without surprise. Willis, forexample, had grown his beard back - though on only one side of his face. This,Floyd presumed, was in aid of some research project, though he found itdifficult to imagine its purpose.In any event, he had his own worries. He was defending himself against thecriticisms of Space Administrator Millson, who had somewhat surprisingly joinedtheir little group. Floyd wondered how he had come aboard Universe (could hepossibly have stowed away?). The fact that Millson had been dead for at leastforty years seemed much less important.‘Heywood,’ his old enemy was saying, ‘the White House is most upset.’‘I can’t imagine why.’‘That radio message you’ve just sent to Europa. Did it have State Departmentclearance?’‘I didn’t think it was necessary. I merely asked permission to land.’‘Ah - but that’s it. Who did you ask? Do we recognize the government concerned?I’m afraid it’s all very irregular…Millson faded away, still tut-tutting. I’m very glad this is only a dream,thought Floyd. Now what?Well, I might have expected it. Hello, old friend. You come in all sizes, don’tyou? Of course, even TMA 1 couldn’t have squeezed into my cabin - and its BigBrother could easily have swallowed Universe in one gulp.The black monolith was standing - or floating - only two metres from his bunk.With an uncomfortable shock of recognition, Floyd realized that it was not onlythe same shape, but also the same size, as an ordinary tombstone. Although theresemblance had often been pointed out to him, until now the incongruity ofscale had lessened the psychological impact. Now, for the first time, he feltthe likeness was disquieting - even sinister. I know this is only a dream - butat my age, I don’t want any reminders…Anyway - what are you doing here? Do you bring a message from Dave Bowman? Areyou Dave Bowman?Well, I didn’t really expect an answer; you weren’t very talkative in the past,were you? But things always happened when you were around. Back in Tycho, sixtyyears ago, you sent that signal to Jupiter, to tell your makers that we’d dugyou up. And look what you did to Jupiter, when we got there a dozen years later!What are you up to now?"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREEVIHAVEN"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREE43"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREESALVAGEThe first task confronting Captain Laplace and his crew, once they had grownaccustomed to being on terra firma, was to re-orient themselves. Everything onGalaxy was the wrong way round.Spaceships are designed for two modes of operation - either no gravity at all,or, when the engines are thrusting, an up-and-down direction along the axis. Butnow Galaxy was lying almost horizontally, and all the floors had become walls.It was exactly as if they were trying to live in a lighthouse that had toppledon to its side; every single piece of furniture had to be moved, and at leastfifty per cent of the equipment was not functioning properly.Yet in some ways this was a blessing in disguise, and Captain Laplace made themost of it. The crew was so busy rearranging Galaxy’s interior - giving priorityto the plumbing - that he had few worries about morale. As long as the hullremained airtight, and the muon generators continued to supply power, they werein no immediate danger; they merely had to survive for twenty days, andsalvation would come from the skies in the shape of Universe. No-one evermentioned the possibility that the unknown powers that ruled Europa might objectto a second landing. They had - as far as anyone knew - ignored the first;surely they could not interfere with a mission of mercy…Europa itself, however, was now less cooperative. While Galaxy had been adrifton the open sea, it had been virtually unaffected by the quakes whichcontinually racked the little world. But now that the ship had become an all toopermanent land structure, it was shaken every few hours by seismic disturbances.Had it touched down in the normal vertical position, by now it would certainlyhave been overturned.The quakes were unpleasant rather than dangerous, but they gave nightmares toanyone who had experienced Tokyo ‘33 or Los Angeles ‘45. It did not help much toknow that they followed a completely predictable pattern, rising to a peak ofviolence and frequency every three and a half days when Io came swinging past onits inner orbit. Nor was it much consolation to know that Europa’s owngravitational tides were inflicting at least equal damage on Io.After six days of gruelling work, Captain Laplace was satisfied that Galaxy wasas near shipshape as was possible in the circumstances. He declared a holiday -which most of the crew spent sleeping - and then drew up a schedule for theirsecond week on the satellite.The scientists, of course, wanted to explore the new world they had sounexpectedly entered. According to the radar maps that Ganymede had transmittedto them, the island was fifteen kilometres long and five wide; its maximumelevation was only a hundred metres - not high enough, someone had gloomilypredicted, to avoid a really bad tsunami.It was hard to imagine a more dismal and forbidding place; half a century ofexposure to Europa’s feeble winds and rains had done nothing to break up thepillow lava which covered half its surface, or to soften the outcropping ofgranite that protruded through the rivers of frozen rock. But it was their homenow, and they had to find a name for it.Gloomy, downbeat suggestions like Hades, Inferno, Hell, Purgatory… were firmlyvetoed by the Captain; he wanted something cheerful. One surprising and quixotictribute to a brave enemy was seriously considered before being rejectedthirty-two to ten, with five abstentions: the island would not be called‘Roseland’..In the end, ‘Haven’ won unanimously."},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREE44"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREEENDURANCE‘History never repeats itself - but historical situations recur.’As he made his daily report to Ganymede, Captain Laplace kept thinking of thephrase. It had been quoted by Margaret M’Bala - now approaching at almost athousand kilometres every second - in a message of encouragement from Universewhich he had been very happy to relay to his fellow castaways.‘Please tell Miss M’Bala that her little history lesson was extremely good formorale; she couldn’t have thought of anything better to send us.‘Despite the inconvenience of having our walls and floors switched around, we’reliving in luxury compared to those old polar explorers. Some of us had heard ofErnest Shackleton, but we had no idea of the Endurance saga. To have beentrapped on ice floes for over a year - then to spend the Antarctic winter in acave - then to cross a thousand kilometres of sea in an open boat and to climb arange of unmapped mountains to reach the nearest human settlement!‘And yet that was only the beginning. What we find incredible - and inspiring -is that Shackleton went back four times to rescue his men on that little island- and saved every one of them! You can guess what that story’s done to ourspirits - I hope you can fax this book to us in your next transmission - we’reall anxious to read it.‘And what would he have thought of that! Yes, we’re infinitely better off thanany of those old-time explorers. It’s almost impossible to believe that, untilwell into the last century, they were completely cut off from the rest of thehuman race, once they’d gone over the horizon. We should be ashamed at grumblingbecause light isn’t fast enough and we can’t talk to our friends in real time -or that it takes a couple of hours to get replies from Earth… They had nocontact for months - almost years! Again, Miss M’Bala - our sincerest thanks.‘Of course, all Earth explorers did have one considerable advantage over us; atleast they could breathe the air. Our science team has been clamouring to gooutside, and we’ve modified four spacesuits for EVAs of up to six hours. At thisatmospheric pressure they won’t need full suits - a waist seal is good enough -and I’m allowing two men to go out at a time, as long as they stay within sightof the ship.‘Finally, here’s today’s weather report. Pressure two hundred and fifty bars,temperature steady at twenty-five degrees, wind gusting at up to thirty klicksfrom the west, usual hundred per cent overcast, quakes between one and three onopen-ended Richter…‘You know, I never did like the sound of that “open-ended” - especially now thatIo’s coming into conjunction again."},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREE45"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREEMISSIONWhen people asked to see him together, it usually meant trouble, or at leastsome difficult decision. Captain Laplace had noticed that Floyd and van der Bergwere spending a lot of time in earnest discussions, often with Second OfficerChang, and it was easy to guess what they were talking about. Yet their proposalstill took him by surprise.‘You want to go to Mount Zeus! How - in an open boat? Has that Shackleton bookgone to your head?’Floyd looked slightly embarrassed; the Captain was right on target. South hadbeen an inspiration, in more ways than one.‘Even if we could build a boat, Sir, it would take much too long… especially nowthat Universe looks like reaching us within ten days.’‘And I’m not sure,’ added van der Berg, ‘that I’d care to sail on this “Sea ofGalilee”; not all its inhabitants may have got the message that we’re inedible.’‘So that leaves only one alternative, doesn’t it? I’m sceptical, but I’m willingto be convinced. Go on…‘We’ve discussed it with Mr Chang, and he confirms that it can be done. MountZeus is only three hundred kilometres away; the shuttle can fly there in lessthan an hour.’‘And find a place to land? As you doubtless recall, Mr Chang wasn’t verysuccessful with Galaxy.’‘No problem, Sir, The William Tsung’s only a hundredth of our mass; even thatice could probably have supported it. We’ve been over the video records, andfound a dozen good landing sites.’‘Besides,’ said van der Berg, ‘the pilot won’t have a pistol pointed at him.That could help.’‘I’m sure it will. But the big problem is at this end. How are you going to getthe shuttle out of its garage? Can you rig a crane? Even in this gravity, itwould be quite a load.’‘No need to, Sir. Mr Chang can fly it out.’There was a prolonged silence while Captain Laplace contemplated, obviouslywithout much enthusiasm, the idea of rocket motors firing inside his ship. Thesmall shuttle William Tsung, more familiarly known as Bill Tee, was designedpurely for orbital operations; normally, it would be pushed gently out of its‘garage’, and the engines would not operate until it was well away from themother ship.‘Obviously you’ve worked all this out,’ said the Captain grudgingly, ‘but whatabout the angle of take-off? Don’t tell me you want to roll Galaxy over so thatBill Tee can pop straight up? The garage is half-way down one side; lucky itwasn’t underneath when we grounded.’‘The take-off will have to be at sixty degrees to the horizontal; the lateralthrusters can handle it.’‘If Mr Chang says so, I’ll certainly believe him. But what will the firing do tothe ship?’‘Well, it will wreck the garage interior - but it will never be used again,anyway. And the bulkheads are designed for accidental explosions, so there’s nodanger of damage to the rest of the ship. We’ll have fire-fighting crewsstanding by, just in case.’It was a brilliant concept - no doubt of that. If it worked, the mission wouldnot be a total failure. During the last week, Captain Laplace had given scarcelya moment’s thought to the mystery of Mount Zeus, which had brought them to thispredicament: only survival had mattered. But now there was hope, and leisure tothink ahead. It would be worth taking some risks, to find why this little worldwas the focus of so much intrigue."},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREE46"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREESHUTTLE‘Speaking from memory,’ said Dr Anderson, ‘Goddard’s first rocket flew aboutfifty metres. I wonder if Mr Chang will beat that record?’‘He’d better - or we’ll all be in trouble.’Most of the science team had gathered in the observation lounge, and everyonewas staring anxiously back along the hull of the ship. Although the entrance ofthe ‘garage’ was not visible from this angle, they would see the Bill Tee soonenough, when - and if - it emerged.There was no countdown; Chang was taking his time, making every possible check -and would fire when he felt like it. The shuttle had been stripped down to itsminimum mass, and was carrying just enough propellant for one hundred seconds offlight. If everything worked, that would be ample; if it didn’t, more would notonly be superfluous, but dangerous.‘Here we go,’ said Chang casually.It was almost like a conjuring trick; everything happened so quickly that theeye was deceived. No one saw Bill Tee pop out of the garage, because it washidden in a cloud of steam. When the cloud had cleared, the shuttle was alreadylanding, two hundred metres away.A great cheer of relief echoed through the lounge.‘He did it!’ cried ex-Acting Captain Lee. ‘He’s broken Goddard’s record -easily!’Standing on its four stubby legs in the bleak Europan landscape, Bill Tee lookedlike a larger and even less elegant version of an Apollo lunar module. That wasnot, however, the thought that occurred to Captain Laplace, as he looked outfrom the bridge. It seemed to him that his ship was rather like a strandedwhale, that had managed a difficult birth in an alien element. He hoped that thenew calf would survive.Forty-eight very busy hours later, the William Tsung was loaded, checked out ona ten-kilometre circuit over the island - and ready to go. There was stillplenty of time for the mission; by the most optimistic reckoning, Universe couldnot arrive for another three days, and the trip to Mount Zeus, even allowing forthe deployment of Dr van der Berg’s extensive array of instruments, would takeonly six hours.As soon as Second Officer Chang had landed, Captain Laplace called him to hiscabin. The Skipper looked, thought Chang, somewhat ill at ease.‘Good work, Walter - but of course that’s only what we expect.’‘Thanks, Sir, So what’s the problem?’The Captain smiled. A well-integrated crew could keep no secrets.‘Head Office, as usual. I hate to disappoint you, but I’ve had orders that onlyDr van der Berg and Second Officer Floyd are to make the trip.’‘I get the picture,’ Chang answered, with a trace of bitterness. ‘What have youtold them?’‘Nothing, yet; that’s why I wanted to talk to you. I’m quite prepared to saythat you’re the only pilot who can fly the mission.’‘They’ll know that’s nonsense; Floyd could do the job as well as I could.There’s not the slightest risk - except for a malfunction, which could happen toanyone.’‘I’d still be willing to stick my neck out, if you insist. After all, no-one canstop me - and we’ll all be heroes when we get back to Earth.’Chang was obviously doing some intricate calculations. He seemed rather pleasedwith the result.‘Replacing a couple of hundred kilos of payload with propellant gives us aninteresting new option; I’d intended to mention it earlier, but there was no wayBill Tee could manage with all that extra gear and a full crew…’‘Don’t tell me. The Great Wall.’‘Of course; we could do a complete survey in one or two passes, and find what itreally is.’‘I thought we had a very good idea, and I’m not sure if we should go near it.That might be pressing our luck.’‘Perhaps. But there’s another reason; to some of us, it’s an even better one…’‘Go on.’‘Tsien. It’s only ten kilometres from the Wall. We’d like to drop a wreaththere.’So that was what his officers had been discussing so solemnly; not for the firsttime, Captain Laplace wished he knew a little more Mandarin.‘I understand,’ he said quietly. ‘I’ll have to think it over - and talk to vander Berg and Floyd to see if they agree.’‘And Head Office?’‘No, dammit. This will be my decision.’"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREE47"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREESHARDS‘You’d better hurry,’ Ganymede Central had advised, ‘The next conjunction willbe a bad one - we’ll be triggering quakes as well as Io. And we don’t want toscare you - but unless our radar’s gone crazy, your mountain’s sunk anotherhundred metres since the last check.’At that rate, thought van der Berg, Europa will be flat again in ten years. Howmuch faster things happened here than on Earth; which was one reason why theplace was so popular with geologists.Now that he was strapped into the number two position immediately behind Floyd,and virtually surrounded by consoles of his own equipment, he felt a curiousmixture of excitement and regret. In a few hours, the great intellectualadventure of his life would be over - one way or the other. Nothing that wouldever happen again could possibly match it.He did not have the slightest trace of fear; his confidence in both man andmachine was complete. One unexpected emotion was a wry sense of gratitude to thelate Rose McCullen; without her, he would never have had this opportunity, butmight have gone, still uncertain, to his grave.The heavily laden Bill Tee could barely manage one-tenth of a gravity atlift-off; it was not intended for this sort of work, but would manage muchbetter on the homeward journey when it had deposited its cargo. It seemed totake ages to climb clear of Galaxy, and they had ample time to note the damageto the hull as well as signs of corrosion from the occasional mildly acid rains.While Floyd concentrated on the lift-off, van der Berg gave a quick report onthe ship’s condition from the viewpoint of a privileged observer. It seemed theright thing to do - even though, with any luck, Galaxy’s space-worthiness wouldsoon be of no further concern to anyone.Now they could see the whole of Haven spread out beneath them, and van der Bergrealized what a brilliant job Acting Captain Lee had done when he beached theship. There were only a few places where it could have been safely grounded;although a good deal of luck had also been involved, Lee had used wind andsea-anchor to the best possible advantage.The mists closed around them; Bill Tee was rising on a semi-ballistic trajectoryto minimize drag, and there would be nothing to see except the clouds for twentyminutes. A pity, thought van der Berg; I’m sure there must be some interestingcreatures swimming around down there, and no-one else may have a chance ofseeing them.‘Coming up to engine cut-off,’ said Floyd. ‘Everything normal.’‘Very good, Bill Tee. No report of traffic at your altitude. You’re still numberone on the runway to land.’‘Who’s that joker?’ asked van der Berg.‘Ronnie Lim. Believe it or not, that “number one on the runway” goes back toApollo.’Van der Berg could understand why. There was nothing like the occasional touchof humour - providing it was not overdone - to relieve the strain when men wereinvolved in some complex and possibly hazardous enterprise.‘Fifteen minutes before we start braking,’ said Floyd. ‘Let’s see who else is onthe air.’He started the autoscan, and a succession of beeps and whistles, separated byshort silences as the tuner rejected them one by one in its swift climb up theradio spectrum, echoed round the little cabin.‘Your local beacons and data transmissions,’ said Floyd. ‘I was hoping - ah,here we are!’It was only a faint musical tone, warbling rapidly up and down like a dementedsoprano. Floyd glanced at the frequency meter.‘Doppler shift almost gone - she’s slowing fast.’‘What is it -text?’‘Slowscan video, I think. They’re relaying a lot of material back to Earththrough the big dish on Ganymede, when it’s in the right position. The networksare yelling for news.’They listened to the hypnotic but meaningless sound for a few minutes; thenFloyd switched it off. Incomprehensible though the transmission from Universewas to their unaided senses, it conveyed the only message that mattered. Helpwas on the way, and would soon be there.Partly to fill the silence, but also because he was genuinely interested, vander Berg remarked casually: ‘Have you talked to your grandfather lately?’‘Talked’, of course, was a misnomer where interplanetary distances wereconcerned, but no-one had come up with an acceptable alternative. ‘Voicegram’,‘audiomail’ and ‘vocard’ had all flourished briefly, then vanished into limbo.Even now, most of the human race probably did not believe that realtimeconversation was impossible in the Solar System’s wide, open spaces, and fromtime to time indignant protests were heard: ‘Why can’t you scientists dosomething about it?’‘Yes,’ said Floyd. ‘He’s in fine shape, and I look forward to meeting him.’There was a slight strain in his voice. I wonder, thought van der Berg, whenthey last met; but he realized that it would be tactless to ask. Instead, hespent the next ten minutes rehearsing the off-loading and setting-up procedureswith Floyd, so there would be no unnecessary confusion when they touched down.The COMMENCE BRAKING alarm went off just a fraction of a second after Floyd hadalready started the program sequencer. I’m in good hands, thought van der Berg:I can relax and concentrate on my job. Where’s that camera - don’t say it’sfloated away again.The clouds were clearing. Even though the radar had shown exactly what wasbeneath them, in a display as good as normal vision could provide, it was stilla shock to see the face of the mountain rearing up only a few kilometres ahead.‘Look!’ cried Floyd suddenly. ‘Over to the left -by that double peak - give youone guess!’‘I’m sure you’re right - I don’t think we did any damage - it just splattered -wonder where the other one hit-’‘Altitude one thousand. Which landing site? Alpha doesn’t look so good fromhere.’‘You’re right - try Gamma - closer to the mountain, anyway.’‘Five hundred. Gamma it is. I’ll hover for twenty secs - if you don’t like it,we’ll switch to Beta. Four hundred… Three hundred… Two hundred. (’Good luck,Bill Tee,’ said Galaxy briefly). Thanks, Ronnie… One hundred and fifty… Onehundred… Fifty… How about it? Just a few small rocks, and - that’s peculiar -what looks like broken glass all over the place - someone’s had a wild partyhere… Fifty… Fifty… Still OK?’‘Perfect. Go down.’‘Forty… thirty… twenty… Sure you don’t want to change your mind?… Ten… Kickingup a little dust, as Neil said once - or was it Buzz?… Five… Contact! Easy,wasn’t it? Don’t know why they bother to pay me.’"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREE48"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREELUCY‘Hello, Gany Central - we’ve made a perfect landing - I mean Chris has - on aflat surface of some metamorphic rock - probably the same pseudogranite we’vecalled Havenite. The base of the mountain is only two kilometres away, butalready I can tell there’s no real need to go any closer.‘We’re putting on our top-suits now, and will start unloading in five minutes.Will leave the monitors running, of course, and will call on every quarter-hour.Van out.’‘What did you mean by that “no need to go any closer”?’ asked Floyd.Van der Berg grinned. In the last few minutes he seemed to have shed years, andalmost to have become a carefree boy.‘Circumspice,’ he said happily. ‘Latin for “look around you”. Let’s get the bigcamera out first - wow!’The Bill Tee gave a sudden lurch, and for a moment heaved up and down on itslanding-gear shock absorbers with a motion that, if it had continued for morethan a few seconds, would have been a recipe for instant sea sickness.‘Ganymede was right about those quakes,’ said Floyd, when they had recovered.‘Is there any serious danger?’‘Probably not; it’s still thirty hours to conjunction, and this looks a solidslab of rock. But we won’t waste any time here - luckily we won’t need to. Is mymask straight? It doesn’t feel right.’‘Let me tighten the strap. That’s better. Breathe in hard - good, now it fitsfine. I’ll go first.’Van der Berg wished that his could be the first small step, but Floyd was thecommander and it was his duty to check that the Bill Tee was in good shape - andready for an immediate take-off.He walked once around the little spacecraft, examining the landing gear, thengave the thumbs-up signal to van der Berg, who started down the ladder to joinhim. Although he had worn the same lightweight breathing equipment on hisexploration of Haven, he felt a little awkward with it, and paused at thelanding pad to make some adjustments. Then he glanced up - and saw what Floydwas doing.‘Don’t touch it!’ he cried. ‘It’s dangerous!’Floyd jumped a good metre away from the shards of vitreous rock he wasexamining. To his untrained eye, they looked rather like an unsuccessful meltfrom a large glass furnace.‘It’s not radioactive, is it?’ he asked anxiously. ‘No. But stay away until I’vegot there.’To his surprise, Floyd realized that van der Berg was wearing heavy gloves. As aspace officer, it had taken him a long time to grow accustomed to the fact that,here on Europa, it was safe to expose one’s bare skin to the atmosphere. Nowhereelse in the Solar System - even on Mars - was that possible.Very cautiously, van der Berg reached down and picked up a long splinter of theglassy material. Even in this diffused light, it glittered strangely, and Floydcould see that it had a vicious edge.‘The sharpest knife in the known universe,’ said van der Berg happily.‘We’ve been through all this to find a knife!’Van der Berg started to laugh, then found it wasn’t easy inside his mask.‘So you still don’t know what this is about?’‘I’m beginning to feel I’m the only one who doesn’t.’Van der Berg took his companion by the shoulder, and turned him to face thelooming mass of Mount Zeus. From this distance, it filled half the sky - notmerely the greatest, but the only mountain on this whole world.‘Admire the view just for one minute. I have an important call to make.’He punched a code sequence on his comset, waited for the READY light to flash,and said: ‘Ganymede Central 109 - this is Van. Do you receive?’After no more than the minimum timelag, an obviously electronic voice answered:‘Hello, Van. This is Ganymede Central 109. Ready to receive.’Van der Berg paused, savouring the moment he would remember for the rest of hislife.‘Contact Earth Ident Uncle 737. Relay following message. LUCY IS HERE. LUCY ISHERE. End message. Please repeat.’Perhaps I should have stopped him saying that, whatever it means, thought Floyd,as Ganymede repeated the message. But it’s too late now. It will reach Earthwithin the hour.‘Sorry about that, Chris,’ grinned van der Berg. ‘I wanted to establish priority- amongst other things.’‘Unless you start talking soon, I’ll begin carving you up with one of thesepatent glass knives.’‘Glass, indeed! Well, the explanation can wait - it’s absolutely fascinating,but quite complicated. So I’ll give you the straight facts.‘Mount Zeus is a single diamond, approximate mass one million million tons. Or,if you prefer it that way, about two times ten to the seventeenth carats. But Ican’t guarantee that it’s all gem quality.’"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREEVIITHE GREAT WALL"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREE49"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREESHRINEAs they unloaded the equipment from Bill Tee and set it up on their littlegranite landing-pad, Chris Floyd found it hard to tear his eyes away from themountain looming above them. A single diamond - bigger than Everest! Why, thescattered fragments lying round the shuttle must be worth billions, rather thanmillions.On the other hand, they might be worth no more than - well, scraps of brokenglass. The value of diamonds had always been controlled by the dealers andproducers, but if a literal gem-mountain came suddenly on the market, priceswould obviously collapse completely. Now Floyd began to understand why so manyinterested parties had focused their attention upon Europa; the political andeconomic ramifications were endless.Now that he had at last proved his theory, van der Berg had become again thededicated and single-minded scientist, anxious to complete his experiment withno further distraction. With Floyd’s help - it was not easy to get some of thebulkier pieces of equipment out of Bill Tee’s cramped cabin - they first drilleda metre-long core with a portable electric drill, and carried it carefully backto the shuttle.Floyd would have had a different set of priorities, but he recognized that itmade sense to do the harder tasks first. Not until they had laid out aseismograph array and erected a panoramic TV camera on a low, heavy tripod didvan der Berg condescend to collect some of the incomputable riches lying allaround them.‘At the very least,’ he said, as he carefully selected some of the less lethalfragments, ‘they’ll make good souvenirs.’‘Unless Rosie’s friends murder us to get them.’Van der Berg looked sharply at his companion; he wondered how much Chris reallyknew - and how much, like all of them, he was guessing.‘Not worth their while, now that the secret’s out. In about an hour’s time, theStock Exchange computers will be going crazy.’‘You bastard!’ said Floyd, with admiration rather than rancour. ‘So that’s whatyour messsage was about.’‘There’s no law that says a scientist shouldn’t make a little profit on the side- but I’m leaving the sordid details to my friends on Earth. Honestly, I’m muchmore interested in the job we’re doing here. Let me have that wrench, please…’Three times before they had finished establishing Zeus Station they were almostknocked off their feet by quakes. They could feel them first as a vibrationunderfoot, then everything would start shaking - then there would be a horrible,long-drawn-out groaning sound that seemed to come from every direction. It waseven air-borne, which to Floyd seemed strangest of all. He could not quite getused to the fact that there was enough atmosphere around them to allowshort-range conversations without radio.Van der Berg kept assuring him that the quakes were still quite harmless, butFloyd had learned never to put too much trust in experts. True, the geologisthad just been proved spectacularly right; as he looked at Bill Tee heaving onits shock-absorbers like a storm-tossed ship, he hoped that Van’s luck wouldhold for at least a few more minutes.‘That seems to be it,’ said the scientist at last, to Floyd’s great relief.‘Ganymede’s getting good data on all channels. The batteries will last foryears, with the solar panel to keep recharging them.’‘If this gear is still standing a week from now, I’ll be very surprised. I’llswear that mountain’s moved since we landed - let’s get off before it falls ontop of us.’‘I’m more worried,’ laughed van der Berg, ‘that your jet-blast will undo all ourwork.’‘No risk of that - we’re well clear, and now we’ve offloaded so much junk we’llneed only half-power to lift. Unless you want to take aboard a few morebillions. Or trillions.’‘Let’s not be greedy. Anyway, I can’t even guess what this will be worth when weget it to Earth. The museums will grab most of it, of course. After that - whoknows?’Floyd’s fingers were flying over the control panel as he exchanged messages withGalaxy.‘First stage of mission completed. Bill Tee ready for take-off. Flight plan asagreed.’They were not surprised when Captain Laplace answered.‘You’re quite certain you want to go ahead? Remember, you have the finaldecision. I’ll back you up, whatever it is.’‘Yessir, we’re both happy. We understand how the crew feels. And the scientificpayoff could be enormous - we’re both very excited.’‘Just a minute - we’re still waiting for your report on Mount Zeus!’Floyd looked at van der Berg, who shrugged his shoulders and then took themicrophone.‘If we told you now, Captain, you’d think we were crazy - or pulling your leg.Please wait a couple of hours until we’re back - with the evidence.’‘Hm. Not much point giving you an order, is it? Anyway - good luck. And from theowner as well - he thinks going to Tsien is a splendid idea.’‘I knew Sir Lawrence would approve,’ Floyd remarked to his companion. ‘Andanyway - with Galaxy already a total loss, Bill Tee’s not much extra risk, isit?’Van der Berg could see his point of view, even though he did not entirelysubscribe to it. He had made his scientific reputation; but he still lookedforward to enjoying it.‘Oh - by the way,’ Floyd said. ‘Who was Lucy - anybody in particular?’‘Not as far as I know. We came across her in a computer search, and decided thename would make a good code word - everyone would assume it was something to dowith Lucifer, which is just enough of a half-truth to be beautifullymisleading….‘I’d never heard of them, but a hundred years ago there was a group of popularmusicians with a very strange name - the Beatles - spelled B-E-A-T-L-E-S, don’task me why. And they wrote a song with an equally strange title: “Lucy in theSky with Diamonds”. Weird, isn’t it? Almost as if they knew…’According to Ganymede radar, the wreck of the Tsien lay three hundred kilometreswest of Mount Zeus, towards the twilight zone and the cold lands beyond.Permanently cold they were, but not dark; half the time they were brilliantlylit by the distant Sun. However, even by the end of the long Europan solar day,the temperature was still far below freezing point. As liquid water could existonly on the hemisphere facing Lucifer, the intermediate region was a place ofcontinual storms, where rain and hail, sleet and snow contended for supremacy.During the half-century since Tsien’s disastrous landing, the ship had movedalmost a thousand kilometres. It must have drifted - like Galaxy - for severalyears on the newly created Sea of Galilee, before coming to rest on its bleaklyinhospitable shore.Floyd picked up the radar echo as soon as Bill Tee flattened out at the end ofits second leap across Europa. The signal was surprisingly weak for so large anobject; as soon as they broke through the clouds, they realized why.The wreck of the spaceship Tsien, first man-carrying vessel to land on asatellite of Jupiter, stood in the centre of a small, circular lake - obviouslyartificial, and connected by a canal to the sea, less than three kilometresaway. Only the skeleton was left, and not even all of that; the carcass had beenpicked clean.But by what? van der Berg asked. There was no sign of life there; the placelooked as if it had been deserted for years. Yet he had not the slightest doubtthat something had stripped the wreck, with deliberate and indeed almostsurgical precision.‘Obviously safe to land,’ said Floyd, waiting for a few seconds to get van derBerg’s almost absentminded nod of approval. The geologist was already videoingeverything in sight.Bill Tee settled down effortlessly by the side of the pool, and they lookedacross the cold, dark water at this monument to man’s exploring impulses. Thereseemed no convenient way of getting to the wreck, but that did not reallymatter.When they had suited up, they carried the wreath to the water’s edge, held itsolemnly for a moment in front of the camera, then tossed in this tribute fromGalaxy’s crew. It had been beautifully made; even though the only raw materialsavailable were metal foil, paper and plastic, one could easily believe that theflowers and leaves were real. Pinned all over them were notes and inscriptions,many written in the ancient but now officially obsolete script rather than Romancharacters.As they were walking back to the Bill Tee, Floyd said thoughtfully: ‘Did younotice - there was practically no metal left. Only glass, plastic, synthetics.’‘What about those ribs and supporting girders?’‘Composite - mostly carbon, boron. Someone round here is very hungry for metal -and knows it when it sees it. Interesting…’Very, thought van der Berg. On a world where fire could not exist, metals andalloys would be almost impossible to make, and as precious as - well, diamonds.When he had reported to base, and received a message of gratitude from SecondOfficer Chang and his colleagues, Floyd took the Bill Tee up to a thousandmetres and continued westward.‘Last lap,’ he said, ‘no point in going higher - we’ll be there in ten minutes.But I won’t land; if the Great Wall is what we think it is, I’d prefer not to.We’ll do a quick flyby and head for home. Get those cameras ready; this could beeven more important than Mount Zeus.’And, he added to himself, I may soon know what Grandfather Heywood felt, not sofar from here, fifty years ago. We’ll have a lot to talk about when we meet -less than a week from now, if all goes well."},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREE50"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREEOPEN CITYWhat a terrible place, thought Chris Floyd - nothing but driving sleet, flurriesof snow, occasional glimpses of landscapes streaked with ice - why, Haven was atropical paradise by comparison! Yet he knew that the nightside, only a fewhundred kilometres further on round the curve of Europa, was even worse.To his surprise, the weather cleared suddenly and completely just before theyreached their goal. The clouds lifted - and there ahead was an immense, blackwall, almost a kilometre high, lying directly across Bill Tee’s flight path. Itwas so huge that it was obviously creating its own microclimate; the prevailingwinds were being deflected around it, leaving a local, calm area in its lee.It was instantly recognizable as the Monolith, and sheltering at its foot werehundreds of hemispherical structures, gleaming a ghostly white in the rays ofthe low-hanging sun that had once been Jupiter. They looked, thought Floyd,exactly like old-style beehives made of snow; something in their appearanceevoked other memories of Earth. Van der Berg was one jump ahead of him.‘Igloos,’ he said. ‘Same problem - same solution. No other building materialaround here, except rock - which would be much harder to work. And the lowgravity must help - some of those domes are quite large. I wonder what lives inthem…’They were still too far away to see anything moving in the streets of thislittle city at the edge of the world. And as they came closer, they saw thatthere were no streets.‘It’s Venice, made of ice,’ said Floyd. ‘All igloos and canals.’‘Amphibians,’ answered van der Berg. ‘We should have expected it. I wonder wherethey are?’‘We may have scared them. Bill Tee’s much noisier outside than in.’For a moment, van der Berg was too busy filming and reporting to Galaxy toreply. Then he said: ‘We can’t possibly leave without making some contact.You’re right - this is far bigger than Mount Zeus.’‘And it could be more dangerous.’‘I don’t see any sign of advanced technology - correction, that looks like anold twentieth-century radar dish over there! Can you get closer?’‘And get shot at? No thanks. Besides, we’re using up our hover time. Onlyanother ten minutes - if you want to get home again.’‘Can we at least land and look around? There’s a patch of clear rock over there.Where the hell is everybody?’‘Scared, like me. Nine minutes. I’ll do one trip across town - film everythingyou can - yes, Galaxy - we’re OK - just rather busy at the moment - call youlater -’‘I’ve just realized - that’s not a radar dish, but something almost asinteresting. It’s pointing straight at Lucifer - it’s a solar furnace! Makes alot of sense in a place where the sun never moves - and you can’t light a fire.’‘Eight minutes. Too bad everyone’s hiding indoors.’‘Or back in the water. Can we look at that big building with the open spacearound it? I think it’s the town hall.’Van der Berg was pointing towards a structure much larger than all the others,and of quite different design; it was a collection of vertical cylinders, likeoversized organ-pipes. Moreover, it was not the featureless white of the igloos,but showed a complex mottling over its entire surface.‘Europan art!’ cried van der Berg. ‘That’s a mural of some kind! Closer, closer!We must get a record!’Obediently, Floyd dropped lower - and lower - and lower. He seemed to havecompletely forgotten all his earlier reservations about hover time; andsuddenly, with shocked incredulity, van der Berg realized that he was going toland.The scientist tore his eyes from the rapidly approaching ground, and glanced athis pilot. Though he was obviously still in full control of Bill Tee, Floydseemed to be hypnotized; he was staring at a fixed point straight ahead of thedescending shuttle.‘What’s the matter, Chris?’ van der Berg cried. ‘Do you know what you’re doing?’‘Of course. Can’t you see him?’‘See who?’‘That man, standing by the biggest cylinder. And he’s not wearing any breathinggear!’‘Don’t be an idiot, Chris: there’s no one there.’‘He’s looking up at us. He’s waving - I think I recog - Oh my God!’‘There’s no-one - no-one! Pull up!’Floyd ignored him completely. He was absolutely calm and professional as hebrought Bill Tee in to a perfect landing, and cut the motor at exactly the rightinstant before touchdown.Very thoroughly, he checked the instrument readings, and set the safetyswitches. Only when he had completed the landing sequence did he again look outof the observation window, with a puzzled but happy expression on his face.‘Hello, Grandfather,’ he said softly, to no-one at all that van der Berg couldsee."},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREE51"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREEPHANTOMEven in his most horrible nightmares, Dr van der Berg had never imagined beingstranded on a hostile world in a tiny space capsule, with only a madman forcompany. But at least Chris Floyd did not seem to be violent; perhaps he couldbe humoured into taking off again and flying them safely back to Galaxy…He was still staring at nothing, and from time to time his lips moved in silentconversation. The alien ‘town’ remained completely deserted, and one couldalmost imagine that it had been abandoned for centuries. Presently, however, vander Berg noticed some tell-tale signs of recent occupancy. Although Bill Tee’srockets had blasted away the thin layer of snow immediately around them, theremainder of the little square was still lightly powdered. It was a page tornfrom a book, covered with signs and hieroglyphics, some of which he could read.A heavy object had been dragged in that direction - or had made its way clumsilyunder its own power. Leading from the now closed entrance of one igloo was theunmistakable track of a wheeled vehicle. Too far away to make out details was asmall object that could have been a discarded container; perhaps Europans weresometimes as careless as humans…The presence of life was unmistakable, overwhelming. Van der Berg felt he wasbeing watched by a thousand eyes - or other senses - and there was no way ofguessing whether the minds behind them were friendly, or hostile. They mighteven be indifferent, merely waiting for the intruders to go away, so that theycould continue their interrupted and mysterious business.Then Chris Floyd spoke once again into the empty air.‘Goodbye, Grandfather,’ he said quietly, with just a trace of sadness. Turningtowards van der Berg he added in a normal conversational tone: ‘He says it’stime to leave. I guess you must think I’m crazy.’It was wisest, decided van der Berg, not to agree. In any event, he soon hadsomething else to worry about.Floyd was now staring anxiously at the read-outs that Bill Tee’s computer wasfeeding to him. Presently he said, in an understandable tone of apology:‘Sorry about this, Van. That landing used up more fuel than I’d intended. We’llhave to change the mission profile.’That, van der Berg thought bleakly, was a rather roundabout way of saying: ‘Wecan’t get back to Galaxy.’ With difficulty, he. managed to suppress a ‘Damn yourgrandfather!’ and merely asked: ‘So what do we do?’Floyd was studying the chart, and punching in more numbers.‘We can’t stay here -, (Why not? thought van der Berg. If we’re going to dieanyway, we might use our time learning as much as possible.) ‘ - so we shouldfind a place where the shuttle from Universe can pick us up easily.’Van der Berg breathed a huge mental sigh of relief. Stupid of him not to havethought of that; he felt like a man who had been reprieved just when he wasbeing taken to the gallows. Universe should reach Europa in less than four days;Bill Tee’s accommodation could hardly be called luxurious, but it was infinitelypreferable to most of the alternatives he could imagine.‘Away from this filthy weather - a stable, flat surface - closer to Galaxy,though I’m not sure if that helps much - shouldn’t be any problem. We’ve enoughfor five hundred kilometres - it’s just that we can’t risk the sea crossing.’For a moment, van der Berg thought wistfully of Mount Zeus; there was so muchthat could be done there. But the seismic disturbances - steadily getting worseas lo came into line with Lucifer - ruled that out completely. He wondered ifhis instruments were still working, and would check them again as soon as they’ddealt with the immediate problem.‘I’ll fly down the coast to the equator - best place to be anyway for a shuttlelanding - the radar map showed some smooth areas just inland round sixty west.’‘I know. The Masada Plateau.’ (And, van der Berg added to himself, perhaps achance for a little more exploring. Never miss an unexpected opportunity…)‘The Plateau it is. Goodbye, Venice. Goodbye, Grandfather…’* * *When the muted roar of the braking rockets had died away, Chris Floyd safetiedthe firing circuits for the last time, released his seat belt, and stretchedarms and legs as far as he could in Bill Tee’s confined quarters.‘Not such a bad view - for Europa,’ he said cheerfully. ‘Now we’ve four days tofind out if shuttle rations are as bad as they claim. So - which of us startstalking first?’"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREE52"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREEON THE COUCHI wish I’d studied some psychology, thought van der Berg; then I could explorethe parameters of his delusion. Yet now he seems completely sane - except onthat one subject.Though almost any seat was comfortable at one-sixth of a gravity, Floyd hadtilted his to the fully reclining position and had clasped his hands behind hishead. Van der Berg suddenly recalled that this was the classic position of apatient, in the days of the old and still not entirely discredited Freudiananalysis.He was glad to let the other talk first, partly out of sheer curiosity butchiefly because he hoped that the sooner Floyd got this nonsense out of hissystem, the sooner he would be cured - or, at least, harmless. But he did notfeel too optimistic: there must have been some serious, deep-seated problem inthe first place to trigger so powerful an illusion.It was very disconcerting to find that Floyd agreed with him completely, and hadalready made his own diagnosis.‘My crew psych rating is Al plus,’ he said, ‘which means that they’ll even letme look at my own files - only about ten per cent can do this. So I’m as baffledas you are - but I saw Grandfather, and he spoke to me. I’ve never believed inghosts - who does? - but this must mean that he’s dead. I wish I could have gotto know him better - I’d been looking forward to our meeting… Still, now I havesomething to remember…’Presently van der Berg asked: ‘Tell me exactly what he said.’Chris smiled a little wanly and answered: ‘I’ve never had one of those totalrecall memories, and I was so stunned by the whole thing that I can’t give youmany of the actual words.’ He paused, and a look of concentration appeared onhis face.‘That’s strange; now I look back, I don’t think we did use words.’Even worse, thought van der Berg; telepathy as well as survival after death. Buthe merely said:‘Well, give me the general gist of the - er -conversation. I never heard you sayanything remember.’‘Right. He said something like, “I wanted to see you again, and I’m very happy.I’m sure everything is going to work out well, and Universe will soon pick youup.”Typical bland spirit message, thought van der Berg. They never say anythinguseful or surprising - merely reflect the hopes and fears of the listener.Zero-information echoes from the subconscious.‘Go on.’‘Then I asked him where everyone was - why the place was deserted. He laughedand gave me an answer I still don’t understand. Something like: “I know youdidn’t intend any harm - when we saw you coming, we barely had time to give thewarning. All the - ” and here he used a word I couldn’t pronounce even if Icould remember it - “got into the water - they can move quite quickly when theyhave to! They won’t come out until you’ve left, and the wind has blown thepoison away.” What could he have meant by that? Our exhaust is nice, clean steam- and that’s what most of their atmosphere is, anyway.’Well, thought van der Berg, I suppose there’s no law that says a delusion - anymore than a dream - has to make logical sense. Perhaps the concept of ‘poison’symbolizes some deep-rooted fear that Chris, despite his excellent psych rating,is unable to face. Whatever it is, I doubt if it’s any concern of mine. Poison,indeed! Bill Tee’s propellant mass is pure, distilled water shipped up to orbitfrom Ganymede.But wait a minute. How hot is it when it comes out of the exhaust? Haven’t Iread somewhere… ?‘Chris,’ said van der Berg cautiously, ‘after the water’s gone through thereactor, does it all come out as steam?’‘What else could it do? Oh, if we run really hot, ten or fifteen per cent getscracked to hydrogen and oxygen.’Oxygen! Van der Berg felt a sudden chill, even though the shuttle was atcomfortable room temperature. It was most unlikely that Floyd understood theimplications of what he had just said; the knowledge was outside his normalsphere of expertise.‘Did you know, Chris, that to primitive organisms on Earth, and certainly tocreatures living in an atmosphere like Europa’s, oxygen is a deadly poison?’‘You’re joking.’‘I’m not: it’s even poisonous to us, at high pressure.’‘I did know that; we were taught it in our diving course.’‘Your - grandfather - was talking sense. It’s as if we’d sprayed that city withmustard gas. Well, not quite as bad as that - it would disperse very quickly.’‘So now you believe me.’‘I never said I didn’t.’‘You would have been crazy if you did!’That broke the tension, and they had a good laugh together.‘You never told me what he was wearing.’‘An old-fashioned dressing gown, just as I remembered when I was a boy. Lookedvery comfortable.’‘Any other details?’‘Now you mention it, he looked much younger, and had more hair than when I sawhim last. So I don’t think he was - what can I say? - real. Something like acomputer-generated image. Or a synthetic hologram.’‘The Monolith!’‘Yes - that’s what I thought. You remember how Dave Bowman appeared toGrandfather on Discovery? Perhaps it’s his turn now. But why? He didn’t give meany warning - not even any particular message. Just wanted to say goodbye andwish me well…’For a few embarrassing moments Floyd’s face began to crumple; then he regainedcontrol, and smiled at van der Berg.‘I’ve done enough talking. Now it’s your turn to explain just what amillion-million-ton diamond is doing - on a world made mostly of ice andsulphur. It had better be good.’‘It is,’ said Dr Rolf van der Berg."},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREE53"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREEPRESSURE COOKER‘When I was studying at Flagstaff,’ began van der Berg, ‘I came across an oldastronomy book that said: “The Solar System consists of the Sun, Jupiter - andassorted debris.” Puts Earth in its place, doesn’t it? And hardly fair toSaturn, Uranus and Neptune - the other three gas giants come to almost half asmuch as Jupiter.‘But I’d better start with Europa. As you know, it was flat ice before Luciferstarted warming it up - greatest elevation only a couple of hundred metres - andit wasn’t much different after the ice had melted and a lot of the water hadmigrated and frozen out on Farside. From 2015 - when our detailed observationsbegan - until ‘38, there was only one high point on the whole moon - and we knowwhat that was.’‘We certainly do. But even though I’ve seen it with my own eyes, I still can’tpicture the Monolith as a wall! I always visualize it as standing upright - orfloating freely in space.’‘I think we’ve learned that it can do anything it wants to - anything we canimagine - and a lot more.‘Well, something happened to Europa in ‘37, between one observation and thenext. Mount Zeus - all of ten kilometres high! - suddenly appeared.‘Volcanoes that big don’t pop up in a couple of weeks; besides, Europa’s nothinglike as active as Io.’‘It’s active enough for me,’ Floyd grumbled. ‘Did you feel that one?’‘Besides, if it had been a volcano, it would have spewed enormous amounts of gasinto the atmosphere; there were some changes, but nothing like enough to accountfor that explanation. It was all a complete mystery, and because we were scaredof getting too close - and were busy on our own projects - we didn’t do muchexcept spin fantastic theories. None of them, as it turned out, as fantastic asthe truth.‘I first suspected it from some chance observations in ‘57, but didn’t reallytake them seriously for a couple of years. Then the evidence became stronger;for anything less bizarre, it would have been completely convincing.‘But before I could believe that Mount Zeus was made of diamond, I had to findan explanation. To a good scientist - and I think I’m a good one - no fact isreally respectable until there’s a theory to account for it. The theory may turnout to be wrong - it usually is, in some details at least - but it must providea working hypothesis.‘And as you pointed out, a million-million-ton diamond on a world of ice andsulphur takes a little explaining. Of course, now it’s perfectly obvious and Ifeel a damn fool not to have seen the answer years ago. Might have saved a lotof trouble - and at least one life - if I had.’He paused thoughtfully, then suddenly asked Floyd:‘Anyone mention Dr Paul Kreuger to you?’‘No. Why should they? I’ve heard of him, of course.‘I just wondered. A lot of strange things have been going on, and I doubt ifwe’ll ever know all the answers.‘Anyway, it’s no secret now, so it doesn’t matter. Two years ago I sent aconfidential message to Paul - oh, sorry, I should have mentioned - he’s myuncle - with a summary of my findings. I asked if he could explain them - orrefute them.‘Didn’t take him long, with all the byte-bashing he’s got at his fingertips.Unfortunately, he was careless, or someone was monitoring his network - I’m sureyour friends, whoever they are, must have a good idea by now.‘In a couple of days, he dug up an eighty-year-old paper in the scientificjournal Nature - yes, it was still printed on paper back then! - which explainedeverything. Well, almost everything.‘It was written by a man working in one of the big labs in the United States -of America, of course - the USSA didn’t exist then. It was a place where theydesigned nuclear weapons, so they knew a few things about high temperatures andpressures.‘I don’t know if Dr Ross - that was his name -had anything to do with bombs, buthis background must have started him thinking about conditions deep down insidethe giant planets. In his 1984 - sorry, 1981 - paper - it’s less than a pagelong, by the way - he made some very interesting suggestions…‘He pointed out that there were gigantic quantities of carbon - in the form ofmethane, CH4 - in the gas giants. Up to seventeen per cent of the total mass! Hecalculated that at the pressures and temperatures in the cores - millions ofatmospheres - the carbon would separate out, sink down towards the centres and -you’ve guessed it - crystallize. It was a lovely theory: I don’t suppose he everdreamed that there would be a hope of testing it.‘So that’s part one of the story. In some ways, part two is even moreinteresting. What about some more of that coffee?’‘Here you are; and I think I’ve already guessed part two. Obviously something todo with the explosion of Jupiter.’‘Not explosion - implosion - Jupiter just collapsed on itself, then ignited. Insome ways, it was like the detonation of a nuclear bomb, except that the newstate was a stable one - in fact, a minisun.‘Now, very strange things happen during implosions; it’s almost as if pieces cango through each other, and come out on the other side. Whatever the mechanism, amountain-sized piece of the diamond core was shot into orbit.‘It must have made hundreds of revolutions - been perturbed by the gravitationalfields of all the satellites - before it ended up on Europa. And conditions musthave been exactly right - one body must have overtaken the other, so the impactvelocity was only a couple of kilometres a second. If they’d met head-on - well,there might not be a Europa now, let alone Mount Zeus! And I sometimes havenightmares, thinking that it could very well have come down on us…‘The new atmosphere may also have buffered the impact; even so, the shock musthave been appalling - I wonder what it did to our Europan friends? - itcertainly triggered a whole series of tectonic disturbances, which are stillcontinuing.’‘And,’ said Floyd, ‘political ones. I’m just beginning to appreciate some ofthem. No wonder the USSA was worried.’‘Amongst others.’‘But would anyone seriously imagine they could get at these diamonds?’‘We’ve not done so badly,’ answered van der Berg, gesturing towards the back ofthe shuttle. ‘In any case, the mere psychological effect on the industry wouldbe enormous. That’s why so many people were anxious to know whether it was trueor not.’‘And now they know. What next?’‘That’s not my problem, thank God. But I hope I’ve made a sizeable contributionto Ganymede’s science budget.’As well as my own, he added to himself."},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREE54"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREEREUNION‘Whatever made you think I was dead?’ cried Heywood Floyd. ‘I’ve not felt betterfor years!’Paralysed with astonishment, Chris Floyd stared at the speaker grille. He felt agreat lifting of his spirits - yet also a sense of indignation. Someone -something - had played a cruel practical joke on him; but for what conceivablereason?Fifty million kilometres away - and coming closer by several hundred everysecond - Heywood Floyd also sounded slightly indignant. But he also soundedvigorous and cheerful, and his voice radiated the happiness he obviously felt atknowing that Chris was safe.‘And I’ve got some more good news for you; the shuttle will pick you up first.It will drop some urgent medical supplies at Galaxy, then hop over to you, andbring you up to rendezvous with us on the next orbit. Universe will go down fiveorbits later; you’ll be able to greet your friends when they come aboard.‘No more now - except to say how much I’m looking forward to making up for losttime. Waiting for your answer in - let’s see - about three minutes…’For a moment, there was complete silence aboard Bill Tee; van der Berg dared notlook at his companion. Then Floyd keyed the microphone and said slowly: ‘Grandad- what a wonderful surprise - I’m still in a state of shock. But I know I metyou here on Europa - I know you said goodbye to me. I’m as certain of that, asI’m sure you were speaking to me just now…‘Well, we’ll have plenty of time to talk about it later. But remember how DaveBowman spoke to you, aboard Discovery? Perhaps it was something like that.‘Now we’ll just sit and wait here until the shuttle comes for us. We’re quitecomfortable - there’s an occasional quake, but nothing to worry about. Until wemeet, all my love.’He could not remember when he had last used that word to his grandfather.After the first day, the shuttle cabin began to smell. After the second, theydidn’t notice - but agreed that the food was no longer quite so tasty. They alsofound it hard to sleep, and there were even accusations of snoring.On day three, despite frequent bulletins from Universe, Galaxy and Earth itself,boredom was beginning to set in, and they had exhausted their supply of dirtystories.But that was the last day.

Do you wish to see it now?’‘Yes,’ answered Dr Paul Kreuger. ‘Speed ten times. No sound.’There would, he knew, be a lot of introductory material he could jump, and viewlater if he wished. He wanted to get to the action as quickly as possible.Credits flashed up, and there on the monitor was Victor Willis, somewhere onGanymede, gesticulating wildly in total silence. Dr Paul Kreuger, like manyworking scientists, took a somewhat jaundiced view of Willis, though he admittedthat he performed a useful function.Willis abruptly vanished, to be replaced by a less agitated subject - MountZeus. But that was much more active than any well-behaved mountain should be; DrKreuger was astonished to see how much it had changed since the lasttransmission from Europa.‘Real time,’ he ordered. ‘Sound.’‘…almost a hundred metres a day, and the tilt has increased fifteen degrees.Tectonic activity now violent - extensive lava flows around the base - I have Drvan der Berg with me - Van, what do you think?’My nephew looks in remarkably good shape, thought Dr Kreuger, considering whathe’s been through. Good stock, of course.‘The crust obviously never recovered from the original impact, and it’s givingway under the accumulated stresses. Mount Zeus has been slowly sinking eversince we discovered it, but the rate has speeded up enormously in the last fewweeks. You can see the movement from day to day.’‘How long before it disappears completely?’‘I can’t really believe that will happen…’There was a quick cut to another view of the mountain, with Victor Willisspeaking off camera.‘That was what Dr van der Berg said two days ago. Any comment now, Van?’‘Er - it looks as if I was mistaken. It’s going down - quite incredible - onlyhalf a kilometre left! I refuse to make any more predictions…’‘Very wise of you, Van - well, that was only yesterday. Now we’ll give you acontinuous time-lapse sequence, up to the moment we lost the camera…’Dr Paul Kreuger leaned forward in his seat, watching the final act of the longdrama in which he had played such a remote, yet vital role.There was no need to speed up the replay: he was already seeing it at almost ahundred times normal. An hour was compressed into a minute - a man’s lifetimeinto that of a butterfly.Before his eyes, Mount Zeus was sinking. Spurts of molten sulphur rocketedskywards around it at dazzling speed, forming parabolas of brilliant, electricblue. It was like a ship going down in a stormy sea, surrounded by St Elmo’sfire. Not even Io’s spectacular volcanoes could match this display of violence.‘The greatest treasure ever discovered - vanishing from sight,’ said Willis inhushed and reverential tones: ‘Unfortunately, we can’t show the finale. You’llsoon see why.’The action slowed down into real time. Only a few hundred metres of the mountainwere left, and the eruptions around it now moved at a more leisurely speed.Suddenly, the whole picture tilted; the camera’s image stabilizers, which hadbeen holding their own valiantly against the continuous trembling of the ground,gave up the unequal battle. For a moment it seemed as if the mountain was risingagain - but it was the camera tripod toppling over. The very last scene fromEuropa was a close-up of a glowing wave of molten sulphur, about to engulf theequipment.‘Gone for ever!’ lamented Willis. ‘Riches infinitely greater than all the wealththat Golconda or Kimberley ever produced! What a tragic, heartbreaking loss!’‘What a stupid idiot!’ spluttered Dr Kreuger. ‘Doesn’t he realize…’It was time for another letter to Nature. And this secret would be much too bigto hide."},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREE56"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREEPERTURBATION THEORYFrom: Professor Paul Kreuger, FRS, etc.To: The Editor, NATURE Data Bank (Public access)Subject: MOUNT ZEUS AND JOVIAN DIAMONDSAs is now well understood, the Europan formation known as ‘Mount Zeus’ wasoriginally part of Jupiter. The suggestion that the cores of the gas giantsmight consist of diamond was first made by Marvin Ross of the University ofCalifornia’s Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in a classic paper ‘The icelayer in Uranus and Neptune - diamonds in the sky?’ (Nature, Vol 292, No. 5822,pp. 435-6, 30 July 1981). Surprisingly, Ross did not extend his calculations toJupiter.The sinking of Mount Zeus has produced a veritable chorus of lamentations, allof which are totally ridiculous - for the reasons given below.Without going into details, which will be presented in a later communication, Iestimate that the diamond core of Jupiter must have had an original mass of atleast 10^28 grams. This is ten billion times that of Mount Zeus.Although much of this material would doubtless have been destroyed in thedetonation of the planet and the formation of the - apparently artificial - sunLucifer, it is inconceivable that Mount Zeus was the only fragment to survive.Although much would have fallen back on to Lucifer, a substantial percentagemust have gone into orbit - and must still be there. Elementary perturbationtheory shows that it will return periodically to its point of origin. It is not,of course, possible to make an exact calculation, but I estimate that at least amillion times the mass of Mount Zeus is still orbiting in the vicinity ofLucifer. The loss of one small fragment, in any case most inconveniently locatedon Europa, is therefore of virtually no importance. I propose the establishment,as soon as possible, of a dedicated space-radar system to search for thismaterial.Although extremely thin diamond film has been mass-produced since as long ago as1982, it has never been possible to make diamond in bulk. Its availability inmegaton quantities could totally transform many industries and create wholly newones. In particular, as was pointed out by Isaacs et al almost a hundred yearsago (see Science, 151, pp. 682-3, 1966) diamond is the only constructionmaterial which would make possible the so-called ‘Space elevator’, allowingtransportation away from Earth at negligible cost. The diamond mountains noworbiting among the satellites of Jupiter may open up the entire Solar System;how trivial, by comparison, appear all the ancient uses of thequartic-crystallized form of carbon!For completeness, I would like to mention another possible location for enormousquantities of diamond - a place, unfortunately, even more inaccessible than thecore of a giant planet…It has been suggested that the crusts of neutron stars may be largely composedof diamond. As the nearest known neutron star is fifteen light years away, andhas a surface gravity seventy thousand million times that of Earth, this canhardly be regarded as a plausible source of supply.But then - who could ever have imagined that one day we would be able to touchthe core of Jupiter?"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREE57"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREEINTERLUDE ON GANYMEDE‘These poor, primitive colonists!’ lamented Mihailovich. ‘I’m horrified -there’s not a single concert grand on the whole of Ganymede! Of course, thethimbleful of optronics in my synthesizer can reproduce any musical instrument.But a Steinway is still a Steinway - just as a Strad is still a Strad.’His complaints, though not altogether serious, had already aroused somecounter-reactions among the local intelligentsia. The popular Morning Medeprogramme had even commented maliciously: ‘By honouring us with their presence,our distinguished guests have - if only temporarily - raised the cultural levelof both worlds…’The attack was aimed chiefly at Willis, Mihailovich and M’Bala, who had been alittle too enthusiastic in bringing enlightenment to the backward natives.Maggie M had created quite a scandal with an uninhibited account ofZeus-Jupiter’s torrid love affairs with Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto.Appearing to the nymph Europa in the guise of a white bull was bad enough, andhis attempts to shield Io and Callisto from the understandable wrath of hisconsort Hera were frankly pathetic. But what upset many local residents was thenews that the mythological Ganymede was of quite the wrong gender.To do them justice, the intentions of the self-appointed cultural ambassadorswere completely praiseworthy, though not entirely disinterested. Knowing thatthey would be stranded on Ganymede for months, they recognized the danger ofboredom, after the novelty of the situation had worn off. And they also wishedto make the best possible use of their talents, for the benefit of everyonearound them. However, not everyone wished - or had time - to be benefited, outhere on the high-technology frontier of the Solar System.Yva Merlin, on the other hand, fitted in perfectly, and was thoroughly enjoyingherself. Despite her fame on Earth, few of the Medes had ever heard of her. Shecould wander around, in the public corridors and pressure domes of GanymedeCentral, without people turning their heads or exchanging excited whispers ofrecognition. True, she was recognized - but only as another of the visitors fromEarth.Greenburg, with his usual quietly efficient modesty, had fitted into theadministrative and technological structure of the satellite and was already onhalf a dozen advisory boards. His services were so well appreciated that he hadbeen warned he might not be allowed to leave.Heywood Floyd observed the activities of his shipmates with relaxed amusement,but took little part in them. His chief concern now was building bridges toChris, and helping his grandson plan his future. Now that Universe - with lessthan a hundred tons of propellant left in its tanks - was safely down onGanymede, there was much to be done.The gratitude that all aboard Galaxy felt towards their rescuers had made iteasy to merge the two crews; when repairs, overhaul and refuelling werecomplete, they would fly back to Earth together. Morale had already been given agreat boost by the news that Sir Lawrence was drawing up the contract for agreatly improved Galaxy II - though construction was not likely to begin untilhis lawyers had settled their dispute with Lloyd’s. The underwriters were stilltrying to claim that the novel crime of space hijacking was not covered by theirpolicy.As for that crime itself, no-one had been convicted, or even charged. Clearly,it had been planned, over a period of several years, by an efficient andwell-funded organization. The United States of Southern Africa loudly protestedinnocence, and said it welcomed an official enquiry. Der Bund also expressedindignation, and of course blamed SHAKA.Dr Kreuger was not surprised to find angry but anonymous messages in his mail,accusing him of being a traitor. They were usually in Afrikaans, but sometimescontained subtle mistakes in grammar or phraseology which made him suspect thatthey were part of a disinformation campaign.After some thought, he passed them onto ASTROPOL - which probably already hasthem, he told himself wryly. ASTROPOL thanked him, but, as he expected, made nocomments.At various times, Second Officers Floyd and Chang and other members of Galaxy’screw were treated to the best dinners on Ganymede by the two mysteriousout-wonders whom Floyd had already met. When the recipients of these (franklydisappointing) meals compared notes afterwards, they decided that their politeinterrogators were trying to build up a case against SHAKA, but were not gettingvery far.Dr van der Berg, who had started the whole thing - and had done very well out ofit, professionally and financially - was now wondering what to do with his newopportunities. He had received many attractive offers from Earth universitiesand scientific organizations - but, ironically, it was impossible to takeadvantage of them. He had now lived too long at Ganymede’s one-sixth of agravity, and had passed the medical point of no return.The Moon remained a possibility; so did Pasteur, as Heywood Floyd explained tohim.‘We’re trying to set up a space university there,’ he said, ’so thatoff-worlders who can’t tolerate one gee can still interact in real time withpeople on Earth. We’ll have lecture halls, conference rooms, labs - some of themwill only be computer-stored, but they’ll look so real you’d never know. Andyou’ll be able to go videoshopping on Earth, to make use of your ill-gottengains.’To his surprise, Floyd had not only rediscovered a grandson - he had adopted anephew; he was now linked to van der Berg as well as Chris by a unique mix ofshared experiences. Above all, there was the mystery of the apparition in thedeserted Europan city, beneath the looming presence of the Monolith.Chris had no doubts whatsoever. ‘I saw you, and heard you, as clearly as I donow,’ he told his grandfather. ‘But your lips never moved - and the strangething is that I didn’t feel that was strange - it seemed perfectly natural. Thewhole experience had a - relaxed feeling about it. A little sad - no, wistfulwould be a better word. Or maybe resigned.’‘We couldn’t help thinking of your encounter with Bowman, aboard Discovery,’added van der Berg.‘I tried to radio him before we landed on Europa. It seemed a naïve thing to do,but I couldn’t imagine any alternative. I felt sure he was there, in some formor other.’‘And you never had any kind of acknowledgement?’Floyd hesitated. The memory was fading fast, but he suddenly recalled that nightwhen the mini-monolith had appeared in his cabin.Nothing had happened, yet from that moment onwards he had felt that Chris wassafe, and that they would meet again.‘No,’ he said slowly. ‘I never had any reply.’ After all, it could only havebeen a dream."},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREEVIIITHE KINGDOM OF SULPHUR"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREE58"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREEFIRE AND ICEBefore the age of planetary exploration opened in the late twentieth century,few scientists would have believed that life could have flourished on a world sofan from the Sun. Yet for half a billion years, the hidden seas of Europa hadbeen at least as prolific as those of Earth.Before the ignition of Jupiter, a crust of ice had protected those oceans fromthe vacuum above. In most places the ice was kilometres thick, but there werelines of weakness where it had cracked open and torn apart. Then there had beena brief battle between two implacably hostile elements, which came into directcontact on no other world in the Solar System. The war between Sea and Spacealways ended in the same stalemate; the exposed water simultaneously boiled andfroze, repairing the armour of ice.The seas of Europa would have frozen completely solid long ago, without theinfluence of nearby Jupiter. Its gravity continually kneaded the core of thislittle world; the forces that convulsed Io were also working here, though withmuch less ferocity. The tug of war between planet and satellite caused continualsubmarine earthquakes, and avalanches which swept with amazing speed across theabyssal plains.Scattered across those plains were countless oases, each extending for a fewhundred metres around a cornucopia of mineral brines gushing from the interior.Depositing their chemicals in a tangled mass of pipes and chimneys, theysometimes created natural parodies of ruined castles or Gothic cathedrals, fromwhich black, scalding liquids pulsed in a slow rhythm, as if driven by thebeating of some mighty heart. And, like blood, they were the authentic sign oflife itself.The boiling fluids drove back the deadly cold leaking down from above, andformed islands of warmth on the seabed. Equally important, they brought fromEuropa’s interior all the chemicals of life. Here, in an environment which wouldotherwise be totally hostile, were abundant energy and food. Such geothermalvents had been discovered in Earth’s oceans, in the same decade that had givenmankind its first glimpse of the Galilean satellites.In the tropical zones close to the vents flourished myriads of delicate, spiderycreatures that were the analogues of plants, though almost all were capable ofmovement. Crawling among these were bizarre slugs and worms, some feeding on the‘plants’, others obtaining their food directly from the mineral-laden watersaround them, At greater distances from the source of heat - the submarine firearound which all these creatures warmed themselves - were sturdier, more robustorganisms, not unlike crabs or spiders.Armies of biologists could have spent lifetimes studying a single small oasis.Unlike the Palaeozoic terrestrial seas, Europa’s hidden ocean was not a stableenvironment, so evolution had progressed swiftly here, producing multitudes offantastic forms. And they were all under indefinite stay of execution; sooner orlater, each fountain of life would weaken and die, as the forces that powered itmoved their focus elsewhere. The abyss was littered with the evidence of suchtragedies - cemeteries holding skeletons and mineral-encrusted remains whereentire chapters had been deleted from the book of life.There were huge shells, looking like trumpets larger than a man. There wereclams of many shapes - bivalves, and even trivalves. And there were spiral stonepatterns, many metres across, which seemed an exact analogy of the beautifulammonites that disappeared so mysteriously from Earth’s oceans at the end of theCretaceous period.In many places, fires burned in the abyss, as rivers of incandescent lava flowedfor scores of kilometres along sunken valleys. The pressure at this depth was sogreat that the water in contact with the red-hot magma could not flash intosteam, and the two liquids co-existed in an uneasy truce.Here, on another world and with alien actors, something like the story of Egypthad been played long before the coming of man. As the Nile had brought life to anarrow ribbon of desert, so these rivers of warmth had vivified the Europandeep. Along their banks, in bands seldom more than a kilometre wide, speciesafter species had evolved and flourished and passed away. And some had leftmonuments behind, in the shape of rocks piled on top of each other, or curiouspatterns of trenches engraved in the seabed.Along the narrow bands of fertility in the deserts of the deep, whole culturesand primitive civilizations had risen and fallen. And the rest of their worldhad never known, for all these oases of warmth were as isolated from one anotheras the planets themselves. The creatures who basked in the glow of the lavariver, and fed around the hot vents, could not cross the hostile wildernessbetween their lonely islands. If they had ever produced historians andphilosophers, each culture would have been convinced that it was alone in theUniverse.And each was doomed. Not only were its energy sources sporadic and constantlyshifting, but the tidal forces that drove them were steadily weakening. Even ifthey developed true intelligence, the Europans must perish with the finalfreezing of their world.They were trapped between fire and ice - until Lucifer exploded in their sky,and opened up their universe.And a vast rectangular shape, as black as night, materialized near the coast ofa new-born continent."},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREE59"},{"pageContent":"2061: ODISSEY THREETRINITY‘That was well done.

I did not expect that we should meet again - especially in thisfashion. Echoing you was an interesting problem.’‘Echoing? Oh - I see. Why did you do it?’‘When we received your message, Hal and I knew that you could help us here.’‘Help - you?’‘Yes, though you may think it strange. You have much knowledge and experiencethat we lack. Call it wisdom.’‘Thank you. Was it wise of me to appear before my grandson?’‘No: it caused much inconvenience. But it was compassionate. These matters mustbe weighed against each other.’‘You said that you needed my help. For what purpose?’‘Despite all that we have learned, there is still much that eludes us. Hal hasbeen mapping the internal systems of the Monolith, and we can control some ofthe simpler ones. It is a tool, serving many purposes. Its prime functionappears to be as a catalyst of intelligence.’‘Yes - that had been suspected. But there was no proof.’‘There is, now that we can tap its memories - or some of them. In Africa, fourmillion years ago, it gave a tribe of starving apes the impetus that led to thehuman species. Now it has repeated the experiment here - but at an appallingcost.‘When Jupiter was converted into a sun, so that this world could realize itspotential, another biosphere was destroyed. Let me show it to you, as I once sawit…’Even as he fell through the roaring heart of the Great Red Spot, with thelightning of its continentwide thunderstorms detonating around him, he knew whyit had persisted for centuries, though it was made of gases far less substantialthan those that formed the hurricanes of Earth. The thin scream of hydrogen windfaded as he sank into the calmer depths, and a sleet of waxen snowflakes - somealready coalescing into barely palpable mountains of hydrocarbon foam -descended from the heights above, It was already warm enough for liquid water toexist, but there were no oceans here; this purely gaseous environment was tootenuous to support them.He descended through layer after layer of cloud, until he entered a region ofsuch clarity that even human vision could have scanned an area more than athousand kilometres across. It was only a minor eddy in the vaster gyre of theGreat Red Spot; and it held a secret that men had long guessed, but neverproved.Skirting the foothills of the drifting foam mountains were myriads of small,sharply defined clouds, all about the same size and patterned with similar redand brown mottlings. They were small only as compared with the inhuman scale oftheir surroundings; the very least would have covered a fair-sized city.They were clearly alive, for they were moving with slow deliberation along theflanks of the aerial mountains, browsing off their slopes like colossal sheep.And they were calling to each other in the metre band, their radio voices faintbut clear against the cracklings and concussions of Jupiter itself.Nothing less than living gasbags, they floated in the narrow zone betweenfreezing heights and scorching depths. Narrow, yes - but a domain far largerthan all the biosphere of Earth.They were not alone. Moving swiftly amongst them were other creatures, so smallthat they could easily have been overlooked. Some of them bore an almost uncannyresemblance to terrestrial aircraft, and were of about the same size. But theytoo were alive - perhaps predators, perhaps parasites, perhaps even herdsmen.And there were jet-propelled torpedoes like the squids of the terrestrialoceans, hunting and devouring the huge gasbags. But the balloons were notdefenceless; some of them fought back with electric thunderbolts and with clawedtentacles like kilometre-long chainsaws.There were even stranger shapes, exploiting almost every possibility of geometry- bizarre, translucent kites, tetrahedra, spheres, polyhedra, tangles of twistedribbons… The gigantic plankton of the Jovian atmosphere, they were designed tofloat like gossamer in the uprising currents, until they had lived long enoughto reproduce; then they would be swept down into the depths to be carbonized andrecycled in a new generation.He was searching a world more than a hundred times the area of Earth, and thoughhe saw many wonders, there was nothing here that hinted of intelligence. Theradio voices of the great balloons carried only simple messages of warning or offear. Even the hunters, who might have been expected to develop higher degreesof organization, were like the sharks in Earth’s oceans - mindless automata.And for all its breathtaking size and novelty, the biosphere of Jupiter was afragile world, a place of mists and foam, of delicate silken threads andpaper-thin tissues spun from the continual snowfall of petrochemicals formed bylightning in the upper atmosphere. Few of its constructs were more substantialthan soap bubbles; its most terrifying predators could be torn to shreds by eventhe feeblest of terrestrial carnivores.‘And all these wonders were destroyed - to create Lucifer?’‘Yes. The Jovians were weighed in the balance against the Europans - and foundwanting. Perhaps, in that gaseous environment, they could never have developedreal intelligence. Should that have doomed them? Hal and I are still trying toanswer this question; that is one of the reasons why we need your help.’‘But how can we match ourselves against the Monolith - the devourer of Jupiter?’‘It is only a tool: it has vast intelligence - but no consciousness. Despite allits powers - you, Hal and I are its superior.’‘I find that very hard to believe. In any event - something must have createdthe Monolith.’‘I met it once - or as much of it as I could face - when Discovery came toJupiter. It sent me back as I am now, to serve its purpose on these worlds. Ihave heard nothing of it since; now we are alone - at least for the present.’‘I find that reassuring. The Monolith is quite sufficient.’‘But now there is a greater problem. Something has gone wrong.’‘I did not think I could still experience fear…’‘When Mount Zeus fell, it could have destroyed this whole world. Its impact wasunplanned - indeed, unplannable. No calculations could have predicted such anevent. It devasted vast areas of the Europan seabed, wiping out whole species -including some for which we had high hopes. The Monolith itself was overturned.It may even have been damaged - its programs corrupted. Certainly they failed tocover all contingencies; how could they, in a Universe which is almost infinite,and where Chance can always undo the most careful planning?’‘That is true - for men and monoliths alike.’‘We three must be the administrators of the unforeseen, as well as the guardiansof this world. Already you have met the Amphibians; you have still to encounterthe Silicon-armoured tappers of the lava streams, and the Floaters who areharvesting the sea. Our task is to help them find their full potential - perhapshere, perhaps elsewhere.’‘And what of mankind?’‘There have been times when I was tempted to meddle in human affairs - but thewarning that was given to mankind applies also to me.’‘We have not obeyed it very well.’‘But well enough. Meanwhile there is much to do, before Europa’s brief summerends, and the long winter comes again.’‘How much time do we have?’‘Little enough; barely a thousand years.

They might, however, havebeen intrigued by the featureless black slab standing in the Plaza, almostmimicking the shape of the UN building itself. If - like everyone else - theyhad reached out to touch it - they would have been puzzled by the strange way inwhich their fingers skittered over its ebon surface.But they would have been far more puzzled - indeed, completely overawed - by thetransformation of the heavens.The last tourists had left an hour ago, and the Plaza was utterly deserted. Thesky was cloudless, and a few of the brighter stars were just visible; all thefainter ones had been routed by the tiny sun that could shine at midnight.The light of Lucifer gleamed not only on the black glass of the ancientbuilding, but also upon the narrow, silvery rainbow spanning the southern sky.Other lights moved along and around it, very slowly, as the commerce of theSolar System came and went between all the worlds of both its suns.And if one looked very carefully, it was just possible to make out the thinthread of the Panama Tower, one of the six umbilical cords of diamond linkingEarth and its scattered children, soaring twenty-six thousand kilometres up fromthe equator to meet the Ring around the World.Suddenly, almost as swiftly as if it had been born, Lucifer began to fade. Thenight that men had not known for thirty generations flooded back into the sky.The banished stars returned.And for the second time in four million years, the Monolith awoke."}]
