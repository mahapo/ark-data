ClarkeForewordBehind every man now alive stand thirty ghosts, for that is the ratio by whichthe dead outnumber the living. Since the dawn of time, roughly a hundred billionhuman beings have walked the planet Earth.Now this is an interesting number, for by a curious coincidence there areapproximately a hundred billion stars in our local universe, the Milky Way. Sofor every man who has ever lived, in this Universe there shines a star.But every one of those stars is a sun, often far more brilliant and gloriousthan the small, nearby star we call the Sun. And many - perhaps most - of thosealien suns have planets circling them. So almost certainly there is enough landin the sky to give every member of the human species, back to the first ape-man,his own private, world-sized heaven - or hell.How many of those potential heavens and hells are now inhabited, and by whatmanner of creatures, we have no way of guessing; the very nearest is a milliontimes farther away than Mars or Venus, those still remote goals of the nextgeneration. But the barriers of distance are crumbling; one day we shall meetour equals, or our masters, among the stars.Men have been slow to face this prospect; some still hope that it may neverbecome reality. Increasing numbers, however, are asking: \"Why have such meetingsnot occurred already, since we ourselves are about to venture into space?\"Why not, indeed? Here is one possible answer to that very reasonable question.But please remembert thi sis only a work of fiction.The truth, as always, will be far stranger.To StanleyI - PRIMEVAL NIGHT1 - The Road to ExtinctionThe drought had lasted now for ten million years, and the reign of the terriblelizards had long since ended. Here on the Equator, in the continent which wouldone day be known as Africa, the battle for existence had reached a new climax offerocity, and the victor was not yet in sight. In this barren and desiccatedland, only the small or the swift or the fierce could flourish, or even hope tosurvive.The man-apes of the veldt were none of these things, and they were notflourishing. Indeed, they were already far down the road to racial extinction.About fifty of them occupied a group of caves overlooking a small, parchedvalley, which was divided by a sluggish stream fed from snows in the mountainstwo hundred miles to the north. In bad times the stream vanished completely, andthe tribe lived in the shadow of thirst.It was always hungry, and now it was starving. When the first faint glow of dawncrept into the cave, Moon-Watcher saw that his father had died in the night. Hedid not know that the Old One was his father, for such a relationship wasutterly beyond his understanding, but as he looked at the emaciated body he feltdim disquiet that was the ancestor of sadness.The two babies were already whimpering for food, but became silent whenMoon-Watcher snarled at them. One of the mothers, defending the infant she couldnot properly feed, gave him an angry growl in return; he lacked the energy evento cuff her for her presumption.Now it was light enough to leave. Moon-Watcher picked up the shriveled corpseand dragged it after him as he bent under the low overhang of the cave. Onceoutside, he threw the body over his shoulder and stood upright - the only animalin all this world able to do so.Among his kind, Moon-Watcher was almost a giant. He was nearly five feet high,and though badly undernourished weighed over a hundred pounds. His hairy,muscular body was halfway between ape and man, but his head was already muchnearer to man than ape. The forehead was low, and there were ridges over the eyesockets, yet he unmistakably held in his genes the promise of humanity. As helooked out upon the hostile world of the Pleistocene, there was alreadysomething in his gaze beyond the capacity of any ape. In those dark, deep-seteyes was a dawning awareness - the first intimations of an intelligence thatcould not possibly fulfill itself for ages yet, and might soon be extinguishedforever.There was no sign of danger, so Moon-Watcher began to scramble down the almostvertical slope outside the cave, only slightly hindered by his burden. As ifthey had been waiting for his signal, the rest of the tribe emerged from theirown homes farther down the rock face, and began to hasten toward the muddywaters of the stream for their morning drink.Moon-Watcher looked across the valley to see if the Others were in sight, butthere was no trace of them. Perhaps they had not yet left their caves, or werealready foraging farther along the hillside. Since they were nowhere to be seen,Moon-Watcher forgot them; he was incapable of worrying about more than one thingat a time.First he must get rid of the Old One, but this was a problem that demandedlittle thought. There had been many deaths this season, one of them in his owncave; he had only to put the corpse where he had left the new baby at the lastquarter of the moon, and the hyenas would do the rest.They were already waiting, where the little valley fanned out into the savanna,almost as if they had known that he was coming. Moon-Watcher left the body undera small bush - all the earlier bones were already gone - and hurried back torejoin the tribe. He never thought of his father again.His two mates, the adults from the other caves, and most of the youngsters wereforaging among the drought-stunted trees farther up the valley, looking forberries, succulent roots and leaves, and occasional windfalls like small lizardsor rodents. Only the babies and the feeblest of the old folk were left in thecaves; if there was any surplus food at the end of the day's searching, theymight be fed. If not, the hyenas would soon be in luck once more.But this day was a good one - though as Moon-Watcher had no real remembrance ofthe past, he could not compare one time with another. He had found a hive ofbees in the stump of a dead tree, and so had enjoyed the finest delicacy thathis people could ever know; he still licked his fingers from time to time as heled the group homeward in the late afternoon. Of course, he had also collected afair number of stings, but he had scarcely noticed them. He was now as near tocontentment as he was ever likely to be; for though he was still hungry, he wasnot actually weak with hunger. That was the most to which any man-ape could everaspire.His contentment vanished when he reached the stream. The Others were there. Theywere there every day, but that did not make it any the less annoying.There were about thirty of them, and they could not have been distinguished fromthe members of MoonWatcher's own tribe. As they saw him coming they begun todance, shake their arms, and shriek on their side of the stream, and his ownpeople replied in kind.And that was all that happened. Though the man-apes often fought and wrestledone another, their disputes very seldom resulted in serious injuries. Having noclaws or fighting canine teeth, and being well protected by hair, they could notinflict much harm on one another. In any event, they had little surplus energyfor such unproductive behavior; snarling and threatening was a much moreefficient way of asserting their points of view.The confrontation lasted about five minutes; then the display died out asquickly as it had begun, and everyone drank his fill of the muddy water. Honorhad been satisfied; each group had staked its claim to its own territory. Thisimportant business having been settled, the tribe moved off along its side ofthe river. The nearest worthwhile grazing was now more than a mile from thecaves, and they had to share it with a herd of large, antelope-like beasts whobarely tolerated their presence. They could not be driven away, for they werearmed with ferocious daggers on their foreheads - the natural weapons which theman-apes did not possess.So Moon-Watcher and his companions chewed berries and fruit and leaves andfought off the pangs of hunger - while all around them, competing for the samefodder, was a potential source of more food than they could ever hope to eat.Yet the thousands of tons of succulent meat roaming over the savanna and throughthe bush was not only beyond their reach; it was beyond their imagination. Inthe midst of plenty, they were slowly starving to death.The tribe returned to its cave without incident, in the last light of the day.The injured female who had remained behind cooed with pleasure as MoonWatchergave her the berry-covered branch he had brought back, and began to attack itravenously. There was little enough nourishment here, but it would help her tosurvive until the wound the leopard had given her had healed, and she couldforage for herself again.Over the valley, a full moon was rising, and a chill wind was blowing down fromthe distant mountains. It would be very cold tonight - but cold, like hunger,was not a matter for any real concern; it was merely part of the background oflife.Moon-Watcher barely stirred when the shrieks and screams echoed up the slopefrom one of the lower caves, and he did not need to hear the occasional growl ofthe leopard to know exactly what was happening.Down there in the darkness old White Hair and his family were fighting anddying, and the thought that he might help in some way never crossedMoonWatcher's mind. The harsh logic of survival ruled out such fancies, and nota voice was raised in protest from the listening hillside. Every cave wassilent, lest it also attract disaster.The tumult died away, and presently Moon-Watcher could hear the sound of a bodybeing dragged over rocks. That lasted only a few seconds; then the leopard got agood hold on its kill. It made no further noise as it padded silently away,carrying its victim effortlessly in its jaws.For a day or two, there would be no further danger here, but there might beother enemies abroad, taking advantage of this cold Little Sun that shone onlyby night. If there was sufficient warning, the smaller predators could sometimesbe scared away by shouts and screams. Moon-Watcher crawled out of the cave,clambered onto a large boulder beside the entrance, and squatted there to surveythe valley.Of all the creatures who had yet walked on Earth, the man-apes were the first tolook steadfastly at the Moon. And though he could not remember it, when he wasvery young Moon-Watcher would sometimes reach out and try to touch that ghostlyface rising above the hills.He had never succeeded, and now he was old enough to understand why. For first,of course, he must find a high enough tree to climb.Sometimes he watched the valley, and sometimes he watched the Moon, but alwayshe listened. Once or twice he dozed off, but he slept with a hair-triggeralertness, and the slightest sound would have disturbed him. At the great age oftwenty-five, he was still in full possession of all his faculties; if his luckcontinued, and he avoided accidents, disease, predators, and starvation, hemight survive for as much as another ten years.The night wore on, cold and clear, without further alarms, and the Moon roseslowly amid equatorial constellations that no human eye would ever see. In thecaves, between spells of fitful dozing and fearful waiting, were being born thenightmares of generations yet to be.And twice there passed slowly across the sky, rising up to the zenith anddescending into the east, a dazzling point of light more brilliant than anystar.2 - The New RockLate that night, Moon-Watcher suddenly awoke. Tired out by the day's exertionsand disasters, he had been sleeping more soundly than usual, yet he wasinstantly alert at the first faint scrabbling down in the valley.He sat up in the fetid darkness of the cave, straining his senses out into thenight, and fear crept slowly into his soul. Never in his life - already twice aslong as most members of his species could expect - had he heard a sound likethis. The great cats approached in silence, and the only thing that betrayedthem was a rare slide of earth, or the occasional cracking of a twig. Yet thiswas a continuous crunching noise, that grew steadily louder. It seemed that someenormous beast was moving through the night, making no attempt at concealment,and ignoring all obstacles. Once Moon-Watcher heard the unmistakable sound of abush, being uprooted; the elephants and dinotheria did this often enough, butotherwise they moved as silently as the cats.And then there came a sound which Moon-Watcher could not possibly haveidentified, for it had never been heard before in the history of the world. Itwas the clank of metal upon stone.Moon-Watcher came face to face with the New Rock when he led the tribe down tothe river in the first light of morning. He had almost forgotten the terrors ofthe night, because nothing had happened after that initial noise, so he did noteven associate this strange thing with danger or with fear. There was, afterall, nothing in the least alarming about it.It was a rectangular slab, three times his height but narrow enough to span withhis arms, and it was made of some completely transparent material; indeed, itwas not easy to see except when the rising sun glinted on its edges. AsMoonWatcher had never encountered ice, or even crystal-clear water, there wereno natural objects to which he could compare this apparition. It was certainlyrather attractive, and though he was wisely cautious of most new things, he didnot hesitate for long before sidling up to it. As nothing happened, he put outhis hand, and felt a cold, hard surface.After several minutes of intense thought, he arrived at a brilliant explanation.It was a rock, of course, and it must have grown during the night. There weremany plants that did this - white, pulpy things shaped like pebbles, that seemedto shoot up during the hours of darkness. It was true that they were small andround, whereas this was large and sharp-edged; but greater and laterphilosophers than Moon-Watcher would be prepared to overlook equally strikingexceptions to their theories.This really superb piece of abstract thinking led Moon-Watcher, after only threeor four minutes, to a deduction which he immediately put to the test. The whiteround pebble-plants were very tasty (though there were a few that producedviolent illness); perhaps this tall one...?A few licks and attempted nibbles quickly disillusioned him. There was nonourishment here; so like a sensible man-ape, he continued on his way to theriver and forgot all about the crystalline monolith, during the daily routine ofshrieking at the Others.The foraging today was very bad, and the tribe had to travel several miles fromthe caves to find any food at all. During the merciless heat of noon one of thefrailer females collapsed, far from any possible shelter. Her companionsgathered round her, twittering and meeping sympathetically, but there wasnothing that anyone could do. If they had been less exhausted they might havecarried her with them, but there was no surplus energy for such acts ofkindness. She had to be left behind, to recover or not with her own resources.They passed the spot on the homeward trek that evening; there was not a bone tobe seen.In the last light of day, looking round anxiously for early hunters, they drankhastily at the stream and started the climb up to their caves. They were still ahundred yards from the New Rock when the sound began.It was barely audible, yet it stopped them dead, so that they stood paralyzed onthe trail with their jaws hanging slackly. A simple, maddeningly repetitiousvibration, it pulsed out from the crystal; and hypnotized all who came withinits spell. For the first time - and the last, for three million years - thesound of drumming was heard in Africa.The throbbing grew louder, more insistent. Presently the man-apes began to moveforward, like sleepwalkers, toward the source of that compulsive sound.Sometimes they took little dancing steps, as their blood responded to rhythmsthat their descendants would not create for ages yet. Totally entranced, theygathered round the monolith, forgetting the hardships of the day, the perils ofthe approaching dusk, and the hunger in their bellies.The drumming became louder, the night darker. And as the shadows lengthened andthe light drained from the sky, the crystal began to glow.First it lost its transparency, and became suffused with a pale, milkyluminescence, Tantalizing, ill-defined phantoms moved across its surface and inits depths. They coalesced into bars of light and shadow, then formedintermeshing, spoked patterns that began slowly to rotate.Faster and faster spun the wheels of light, and the throbbing of the drumsaccelerated with them. Now utterly hypnotized, the man-apes could only stareslack-jawed into this astonishing display of pyrotechnics. They had alreadyforgotten the instincts of their forefathers and the lessons of a lifetime; notone of them, ordinarily, would have been so far from his cave, so late in theevening. For the surrounding brush was full of frozen shapes and staring eyes,as the creatures of the night suspended their business to see what would happennext.Now the spinning wheels of light began to merge, and the spokes fused intoluminous bars that slowly receded into the distance, rotating on their axes asthey did so. They split into pairs and the resulting sets of lines started tooscillate across one another, slowly changing their angles of intersection.Fantastic, fleeting geometrical patterns flickered in and out of existence asthe glowing grids meshed and unmeshed; and the man-apes watched, mesmerizedcaptives of the shining crystal.They could never guess that their minds were being probed, their bodies mapped,their reactions studied, their potentials evaluated. At first, the whole triberemained half crouching in a motionless tableau, as if frozen into stone. Thenthe man-ape nearest to the slab suddenly came to life.He did not move from his position, but his body lost its trancelike rigidity andbecame animated as if it were a puppet controlled by invisible strings. The headturned this way and that; the mouth silently opened and closed; the handsclenched and unclenched. Then he bent down, snapped off a long stalk of grass,and attempted to tie it into a knot with clumsy fingers.He seemed to be a thing possessed, struggling against some spirit or demon whohad taken over control of his body. He was panting for breath, and his eyes werefull of terror as he tried to force his fingers to make movements more complexthan any that they had ever attempted before.Despite all his efforts, he succeeded only in breaking the stalk into pieces. Asthe fragments fell to the ground, the controlling influence left him, and hefroze once more into immobility.Another man-ape came to life, and went through the same routine. This was ayounger, more adaptable specimen; it succeeded where the older one had failed.On the planet Earth, the first crude knot had been tied.Others did stranger and still more pointless things. Some held their hands outat arm's length, and tried to touch their fingertips together - first with botheyes open, then with one closed. Some were made to stare at ruled patterns inthe crystal, which became more and more finely divided until the lines hadmerged into a gray blur. And all heard single pure sounds, of varying pitch,that swiftly sank below the level of hearing.When Moon-Watcher's turn came, he felt very little fear. His main sensation wasa dull resentment, as his muscles twitched and his limbs moved at commands thatwere not wholly his own. Without knowing why, he bent down and picked up a smallstone. When he straightened up, he saw that there was a new image in the crystalslab.The grids and the moving, dancing patterns had gone. Instead, there was a seriesof concentric circles, surrounding a small black disk. Obeying the silent ordersin his brain, he pitched the stone with a clumsy, overarm throw. It missed thetarget by several feet.Try again, said the command. He searched around until he had found anotherpebble. This time it hit the slab with a ringing, bell-like tone. He was still along way off, but his aim was improving. At the fourth attempt, he was onlyinches from the central bull's-eye. A feeling of indescribable pleasure, almostsexual in its intensity, flooded his mind. Then the control relaxed; he felt noimpulse to do anything, except to stand and wait.One by one, every member of the tribe was briefly possessed. Some succeeded, butmost failed at the tasks they had been set, and all were appropriately rewardedby spasms of pleasure or of pain.Now there was only a uniform featureless glow in the great slab, so that itstood like a block of light superimposed oil the surrounding darkness. As ifwaking from a sleep, the man-apes shook their heads, and presently began to movealong the trail to their place of shelter. They did not look back, or wonder atthe strange light that was guiding them to their homes - and to a futureunknown, as yet, even to the stars.3 - AcademyMoon-Watcher and his companions had no recollection of what they had seen, afterthe crystal had ceased to cast its hypnotic spell over their minds and toexperiment with their bodies. The next day, as they went out to forage, theypassed it with scarcely a second thought; it was now part of the disregardedbackground of their lives. They could not eat it, and it could not eat them;therefore it was not important.Down at the river, the Others made their usual ineffectual threats. Theirleader, a one-eared man-ape of Moon-Watcher's size and age, but in poorercondition, even made a brief foray toward the tribe's territory, screamingloudly and waving his arms in an attempt to scare the opposition and to bolsterhis own courage.The water of the stream was nowhere more than a foot deep, but the fartherOne-Ear moved out into it, the more uncertain and unhappy he became. Very soonhe slowed to a halt, and then moved back, with exaggerated dignity, to join hiscompanions.Otherwise, there was no change in the normal routine. The tribe gathered justenough nourishment to survive for another day, and no one died.And that night, the crystal slab was still waiting; surrounded by its pulsingaura of light and sound. The program it had contrived, however, was now subtlydifferent.Some, of the man-apes it ignored completely, as if it was concentrating on themost promising subjects.One of them was Moon-Watcher; once again he felt inquisitive tendrils creepingdown the unused byways of his brain. And presently, he began to see visions.They might have been within the crystal block; they might have been whollyinside his mind. In any event, to Moon-Watcher they were completely real. Yetsomehow the usual automatic impulse to drive off invaders of his territory hadbeen lulled into quiescence.He was looking at a peaceful family group, differing in only one respect fromthe scenes he knew. The male, female, and two infants that had mysteriouslyappeared before him were gorged and replete, with sleek and glossy pelts - andthis was a condition of life that Moon-Watcher had never imagined.Unconsciously, he felt his own protruding ribs; the ribs of these creatures werehidden in rolls of fat. From time to time they stirred lazily, as they lolled atease near the entrance of a cave, apparently at peace with the world.Occasionally; the big male emitted a monumental burp of contentment.There was no other activity, and after five minutes the scene suddenly fadedout. The crystal was no more than a glimmering outline in the darkness;MoonWatcher shook himself as if awaking from a dream, abruptly realized where hewas, and led the tribe back to the caves.He had no conscious memory of what he had seen; but that night, as he satbrooding at the entrance of his lair, his ears attuned to the noises of theworld around him, Moon-Watcher felt the first faint twinges of a new and potentemotion. It was a vague and diffuse sense of envy - of dissatisfaction with hislife. He had no idea of its cause, still less of its cure; but discontent hadcome into his soul, and he had taken one small step toward humanity.Night after night, the spectacle of those four plump man-apes was repeated,until it had become a source of fascinated exasperation, serving to increaseMoon-Watcher's eternal, gnawing hunger. The evidence of his eyes could not haveproduced this effect; it needed psychological reinforcement. There were gaps inMoon-Watcher's life now that he would never remember, when the very atoms of hissimple brain were being twisted into new patterns. If he survived, thosepatterns would become eternal, for his genes would pass them on to futuregenerations.It was a slow, tedious business, but the crystal monolith was patient. Neitherit, nor its replicas scattered across half the globe, expected to succeed withall the scores of groups involved in the experiment. A hundred failures wouldnot matter, when a single success could change the destiny of the world.By the time of the next new moon, the tribe had seen one birth and two deaths.One of these had been due to starvation; the other had occurred during thenightly ritual, when a man-ape had suddenly collapsed while attempting to taptwo pieces of stone delicately together. At once, the crystal had darkened, andthe tribe had been released from the spell. But the fallen man-ape had notmoved; and by the morning, of course, the body was gone.There had been no performance the next night; the crystal was still analyzingits mistake. The tribe streamed past it through the gathering dusk, ignoring itspresence completely. The night after, it was ready for them again. The fourplump man-apes were still there, and now they were doing extraordinary things.Moon-Watcher began to tremble uncontrollably; he felt as if his brain wouldburst, and wanted to turn away his eyes. But that remorseless mental controlwould not relax its grip; he was compelled to follow the lesson to the end,though all his instincts revolted against it.Those instincts had served his ancestors well, in the days of warm rains andlush fertility, when food was to be had everywhere for the plucking. Now timeshad changed, and the inherited wisdom of the past had become folly. The man-apesmust adapt, or they must die - like the greater beasts who had gone before them,and whose bones now lay sealed within the limestone hills.So Moon-Watcher stared at the crystal monolith with unblinking eyes, while hisbrain lay open to its still uncertain manipulations. Often he felt nausea, butalways he felt hunger; and from time to time his hands clenched unconsciously inthe patterns that would determine his new way of life.As the line of warthogs moved snuffling and grunting across the trail,MoonWatcher came to a sudden halt. Pigs and man-apes had always ignored eachother, for there was no conflict of interest between them. Like most animalsthat did not compete for the same food, they merely kept out of each other'sway.Yet now Moon-Watcher stood looking at them, wavering back and forth uncertainlyas he was buffeted by impulses which he could not understand, Then, as if in adream, he started searching the ground - though for what, he could not haveexplained even if he had had the power of speech. He would recognize it when hesaw it.It was a heavy, pointed stone about six inches long, and though it did not fithis hand perfectly, it would do. As he swung his hand around, puzzled by itssuddenly increased weight, he felt a pleasing sense of power and authority. Hestarted to move toward the nearest pig.It was a young and foolish animal, even by the undemanding standards of warthogintelligence. Though it observed him out of the corner of its eye, it did nottake him seriously until much too late. Why should it suspect these harmlesscreatures of any evil intent? It went on rooting up the grass untilMoon-Watcher's stone hammer obliterated its dim consciousness. The remainder ofthe herd continued grazing unalarmed, for the murder had been swift and silent.All the other man-apes in the group had stopped to watch, and now they crowdedround Moon-Watcher and his victim with admiring wonder. Presently one of thempicked up the blood-stained weapon, and began to pound the dead pig. Othersjoined in with any sticks and stones that they could gather, until theirt targetbegan a messy disintegration.Then they became bored; some wandered off, while others stood hesitantly aroundthe unrecognizable corpse - the future of a world waiting upon their decision.It was a surprisingly long time before one of the nursing females began to lickthe gory stone she was holding in her paws.And it was longer still before Moon-Watcher, despite all that he had been shown,really understood that he need never be hungry again.4 - The LeopardThe tools they had been programmed to use were simple enough, yet they couldchange this world and make the man-apes its masters. The most primitive was thehand-held stone, that multiplied manyfold the power of a blow. Then there wasthe bone club, that lengthened the reach and could provide a buffer against thefangs or claws of angry animals. With these weapons, the limitless food thatroamed the savannas was theirs to take.But they needed other aids, for their teeth and nails could not readilydismember anything larger than a rabbit, Luckily, Nature had provided theperfect tools, requiring only the wit to pick them up; First there was a crudebut very efficient knife or saw, of a model that would serve well for the nextthree million years. It was simply the lower jawbone of an antelope, with theteeth still in place; there would be no substantial improvement until the comingof steel. Then there was an awl or dagger in the form of a gazelle horn, andfinally a scraping tool made from the complete jaw of almost any small animal.The stone club, the toothed saw, the horn dagger, the bone scraper - these werethe marvelous inventions which the man-apes needed in order to survive. Soonthey would recognize them for the symbols of power that they were, but manymonths must pass before their clumsy fingers had acquired the skill - or thewill - to use them.Perhaps, given time, they might by their own efforts have come to the awesomeand brilliant concept of using natural weapons as artificial tools. But the oddswere all against them, and even now there were endless opportunities for failurein the ages that lay ahead.The man-apes had been given their first chance. There would be no second one;the future was, very literally, in their own hands.Moons waxed and waned; babies were born and sometimes lived; feeble, toothlessthirty-year-olds died; the leopard took its toll in the night; the Othersthreatened daily across the river - and the tribe prospered. In the course of asingle year, Moon-Watcher and his companions had changed almost beyondrecognition.They had learned their lessons well; now they could handle all the tools thathad been revealed to them. The very memory of hunger was fading from theirminds; and though the warthogs were becoming shy, there were gazelles andantelopes and zebras in countless thousands on the plains. All these animals,and others, had fallen prey to the apprentice hunters.Now that they were no longer half-numbed with starvation, they had time both forleisure and for the first rudiments of thought. Their new way of life was nowcasually accepted, and they did not associate it in any way with the monolithstill standing beside the trail to the river. If they had ever stopped toconsider the matter, they might have boasted that they had brought about theirimproved status by their own efforts; in fact, they had already forgotten anyother mode of existence.But no Utopia is perfect, and this one had two blemishes. The first was themarauding leopard, whose passion for man-apes seemed to have grown even strongernow that they were better nourished. The second was the tribe across the river;for somehow the Others had survived, and had stubbornly refused to die ofstarvation.The leopard problem was resolved partly by chance, partly owing to a serious- indeed almost fatal - error on Moon-Watcher's part. Yet at the time his ideahad seemed such a brilliant one that he had danced with joy, and perhaps hecould hardly be blamed for overlooking the consequences.The tribe still experienced occasional bad days, though these no longerthreatened its very survival. Toward dusk, it had failed to make a kill; thehome caves were already in sight as Moon-Watcher led his tired and disgruntledcompanions back to shelter. And there, on their very threshold, they found oneof nature's rare bonanzas. A full-grown antelope was lying by the trail. Itsforeleg was broken, but it still had plenty of fight in it, and the circlingjackals gave its daggerlike horns a respectful berth. They could afford to wait;they knew that they had only to bide their time. But they had forgotten aboutthe competition, and retreated with angry snarls when the man-apes arrived.They too circled warily, keeping beyond the range of those dangerous horns; thenthey moved to the attack with clubs and stones.It was not a very effective or coordinated attack; by the time the wretchedbeast had been given its quietus the light had almost gone - and the jackalswere regaining their courage. Moon-Watcher, torn between fear and hunger, slowlyrealized that all this effort might have been in vain. It was too dangerous tostay here any longer.Then, not for the first or the last time, he proved himself a genius. With animmense effort of imagination, he visualized the dead antelope - in the safetyof his own cave. He began to drag it toward the cliff face; presently, theothers understood his intentions, and began to help him.If he had known how difficult the task would be, he would never have attemptedit. Only his great strength, and the agility inherited from his arborealancestors allowed him to haul the carcass up the steep slope. Several times,weeping with frustration, he almost abandoned his prize, but a stubbornness asdeep-seated as his hunger drove him on. Sometimes the others helped him,sometimes they hindered; more often, they merely got in the way. But finally itwas done; the battered antelope was dragged over the lip of the cave, as thelast hues of sunlight faded from the sky; and the feasting began.Hours later, gorged to repletion, Moon-Watcher awoke. Not knowing why, he sat upin the darkness among the sprawled bodies of his equally satiated companions,and strained his ears into the night.There was no sound except the heavy breathing around him; the whole world seemedasleep. The rocks beyond the mouth of the cave were pale as bone in thebrilliant light from the moon, now high overhead. Any thought of danger seemedinfinitely remote.Then, from a long way off, came the sound of a falling pebble. Fearful, yetinquisitive, Moon-Watcher crawled out onto the ledge of the cave and peered downthe face of the cliff.What he saw left him so paralyzed with fright that for long seconds he wasunable to move. Only twenty feet below, two gleaming golden eyes were staringstraight up at him; they held him so hypnotized with fear that he was scarcelyaware of the lithe, streaked body behind them, flowing smoothly and silentlyfrom rock to rock. Never before had the leopard climbed so high. It had ignoredthe lower caves, though it must have been well aware of their inhabitants. Nowit was after other game; it was following the spoor of blood, up the moon-washedface of the cliff.Seconds later, the night was made hideous by the shrieks of alarm from theman-apes in the cave above. The leopard gave a snarl of fury as it realized thatit had lost the element of surprise. But it did not check its advance, for itknew that it had nothing to fear.It reached the ledge, and rested for a moment on the narrow open space. Thescent of blood was all around, filling its fierce and tiny mind with oneoverwhelming desire. Without hesitation, it padded silently into the cave.And here it made its first error, for as it moved out of the moonlight even itssuperbly night-adapted eyes were at a momentary disadvantage. The man-apes couldsee it, partly silhouetted against the opening of the cave, more clearly than itcould see them. They were terrified, but they were no longer utterly helpless.Snarling and lashing its tail in arrogant confidence, the leopard advanced insearch of the tender food that it craved. Had it met its prey in the open, itwould have had no problems; but now that the man-apes were trapped, desperationhad given them the courage to attempt the impossible. And for the first timethey had the means to achieve it.The leopard knew that something was wrong when it felt a stunning blow on itshead. It lashed out with its forepaw, and heard a shriek of agony as its clawsslashed through soft flesh. Then there was a piercing pain as something sharpdrove into its flanks - once, twice, and yet a third time. It whirled around tostrike at the shadows screaming and dancing on all sides.Again there was a violent blow as something caught it across the snout. Itsteeth snapped on a white, moving blur - only to grate uselesssly upon dead bone.And now - in a final, unbelievable indignity - its tail was being dragged out bythe roots.It whirled around, throwing its insanely daring tormentor against the wall ofthe cave. Yet whatever it did, it could not escape the rain of blows, inflictedon it by crude weapons wielded by clumsy but powerful hands. Its snarls ran thegamut from pain to alarm, from alarm to outright terror. The implacable hunterwas now the victim, and was desperately trying to retreat.And then it made its second mistake, for in its surprise and fright it hadforgotten where it was. Or perhaps it had been dazed or blinded by the blowsrained on its head; whatever the case, it bolted abruptly from the cave. Therewas a horrible screech as it went toppling out into space. Ages later, itseemed, there came a thud as it crashed into an outcropping halfway down thecliff; thereafter, the only sound was the sliding of loose stones, which quicklydied away into the night.For a long time, intoxicated by victory, Moon-Watcher stood dancing andgibbering at the entrance of the cave. He rightly sensed that his whole worldhad changed and that he was no longer a powerless victim of the forces aroundhim.Then he went back into the cave and, for the first time in his life, had anunbroken night's sleep.In the morning, they I found the body of the leopard at the foot of the cliff.Even in death, it was some time before anyone dared to approach the vanquishedmonster, but presently they closed in upon it, with their bone knives and saws.It was very hard work, and they did no hunting that day.5 - Encounter in the DawnAs he led the tribe down to the river in the dim light of dawn, MoonWatcherpaused uncertainly at a familiar spot. Something, he knew, was missing; but whatit was, he could not remember. He wasted no mental effort on the problem, forthis morning he had more important matters on his mind.Like thunder and lightning and clouds and eclipses, the great block of crystalhad departed as mysteriously as it had come. Having vanished into thenonexistent past, it never troubled Moon-Watcher's thoughts again.He would never know what it had done to him; and none of his companionswondered, as they gathered round him in the morning mist, why he had paused fora moment here on the way to the river.From their side of the stream, in the never-violated safety of their ownterritory, the Others first saw Moon-Watcher and a dozen males of his tribe as amoving frieze against the dawn sky. At once they began to scream their dailychallenge; but this time, there was no answer.Steadily, purposefully - above all, silently - Moon-Watcher and his banddescended the low hillock that overlooked the river; and as they approached, theOthers became suddenly quiet. Their ritual rage ebbed away, to be replaced by amounting fear. They were dimly aware that something had happened, and that thisencounter was unlike all those that had ever gone before.The bone clubs and knives that Moon-Watcher's group carried did not alarm them,for they did not understand their purpose. They only knew that their rivals'movements were now imbued with determination, and with menace.The party stopped at the water's edge, and for a moment the Others' couragerevived. Led by One-Ear, they halfheartedly resumed their battle chant. Itlasted only a few seconds before a vision of terror struck then dumb.Moon-Watcher raised his arms high into the air, revealing the burden that untilnow had been concealed by the hirsute bodies of his companions. He was holding astout branch, and impaled upon it was the bloody head of the leopard. The mouthhad been jammed open with a stick, and the great fangs gleamed a ghastly whitein the first rays of the rising sun.Most of the Others were too paralyzed with fright to move; but some began aslow, stumbling retreat. That was all the encouragement that Moon-Watcherneeded. Still holding the mangled trophy above his head, he started to cross thestream. After a moment's hesitation, his companions splashed after him.When Moon-Watcher reached the far side, One-Ear was still standing his ground.Perhaps he was too brave or too stupid to run; perhaps he could not reallybelieve that this outrage was actually happening. Coward or hero, it made nodifference in the end, as the frozen snarl of death came crashing down upon hisuncomprehending head.Shrieking with fright, the Others scattered into the bush; but presently theywould return, and soon they would forget their lost leader.For a few seconds Moon-Watcher stood uncertainly above his new victim, trying tograsp the strange and wonderful fact that the dead leopard could kill again. Nowhe was master of the world, and he was not quite sure what to do next.But he would thinkof something.6 - Ascent of ManA new animal was abroad on the planet, spreading slowly out from the Africanheartland. It was still so rare that a hasty census might have overlooked it,among the teeming billions of creatures roving over land and sea. There was noevidence, as yet, that it would prosper or even survive: on this world where somany mightier beasts had passed away, its fate still wavered in the balance.In the hundred thousand years since the crystals had descended upon Africa, theman-apes had invented nothing. But they had started to change, and had developedskills which no other animal possessed. Their bone clubs had increased theirreach and multiplied their strength; they were no longer defenseless against thepredators with whom they had to compete. The smaller carnivores they could driveaway from their own kills; the larger ones they could at least discourage, andsometimes put to flight.Their massive teeth were growing smaller, for they were no longer essential. Thesharp-edged stones that could be used to dig out roots, or to cut and sawthrough tough flesh or fiber, had begun to replace them, with immeasurableconsequences. No longer were the man-apes faced with starvation when their teethbecame damaged or worn; even the crudest tools could add many years to theirlives. And as their fangs diminished, the shape of their face started to alter;the snout receded, the massive jaw became more delicate, the mouth able to makemore subtle sounds. Speech was still a million years away, but the first stepstoward it had been taken.And then the world began to change. In four great waves, with two hundredthousand years between their crests, the Ice Ages swept by, leaving their markon all the globe. Outside the tropics, the glaciers slew those who hadprematurely left theft ancestral home; and everywhere they winnowed out thecreatures who could not adapt.When the ice had passed, so had much of the planet's early life - including theman-apes. But, unlike so many others, they had left descendants; they had notmerely become extinct - they had been transformed. The toolmakers had beenremade by their own tools.For in using clubs and flints, their hands had developed a dexterity foundnowhere else in the animal kingdom, permitting them to make still better tools,which in turn had developed their limbs and brains yet further. It was anaccelerating, cumulative process; and at its end was Man.The first true men had tools and weapons only a little better than those oftheir ancestors a million years earlier, but they could use them with fargreater skill.And somewhere in the shadowy centuries that had gone before they had inventedthe most essential tool of all, though it could be neither seen nor touched.They had learned to speak, and so had won their first great victory over Time.Now the knowledge of one generation could be handed on to the next, so that eachage could profit from those that had gone before.Unlike the animals, who knew only the present, Man had acquired a past; and hewas beginning to grope toward a future.He was also learning to harness the forces of nature; with the taming of fire,he had laid the foundations of technology and left his animal origins farbehind. Stone gave way to bronze, and then to iron. Hunting was succeeded byagriculture. The tribe grew into the village, the village into the town. Speechbecame eternal, thanks to certain marks on stone and clay and papyrus. Presentlyhe invented philosophy, and religion. And he peopled the sky, not altogetherinaccurately, with gods.As his body became more and more defenseless, so his means of offense becamesteadily more frightful. With stone and bronze and iron and steel he had run thegamut of everything that could pierce and slash, and quite early in time he hadlearned how to strike down his victims from a distance. The spear, the bow, thegun, and finally the guided missile had given him weapons of infinite range andall but infinite power.Without those weapons, often though he had used them against himself, Man wouldnever have conquered his world. Into them he had put his heart and soul, and forages they had served him well.But now, as long as they existed, he was living on borrowed time.II - TMA-17 - Special FlightNo matter how many times you left Earth, Dr. Heywood Floyd told himself, theexcitement never really palled. He had been to Mars once, to the Moon threetimes, and to the various space stations more often than he could remember. Yetas the moment of takeoff approached, he was conscious of a rising tension, afeeling of wonder and awe - yes; and of nervousness - which put him on the samelevel as any Earthlubber about to receive his first baptism of space.The jet that had rushed him here from Washington, after that midnight briefingwith the President, was now dropping down toward one of the most familiar, yetmost exciting, landscapes in all the world. There lay the first two generationsof the Space Age, spanning twenty miles of the Florida coast to the south,outlined by winking red warning lights, were the giant gantries of the Saturnsand Neptunes, that had set men on the path to the planets, and had now passedinto history. Near the horizon, a gleaming silver tower bathed in floodlights,stood the last of the Saturn V's, for almost twenty years a national monumentand place of pilgrimage. Not far away, looming against the sky like a man-mademountain, was the incredible bulk of the Vehicle Assembly Building, still thelargest single structure on Earth.But these things now belonged to the past, and he was flying toward the future.As they banked, Dr. Floyd could see below him a maze of buildings, then a greatairstrip, then a broad, dead-straight scar across the fiat Florida landscape -the multiple rails of a giant launch-lug track. At its end, surrounded byvehicles and gantries, a spaceplane lay gleaming in a pool of light, beingprepared for its leap to the stars. In a sudden failure of perspective, broughton by his swift changes of speed and height, it seemed to Floyd that he waslooking down on a small silver moth, caught in the beam of a flashlight.Then the tiny, scurrying figures on the ground brought home to him the real sizeof the spacecraft; it must have been two hundred feet across the narrow Vof its wings.And that enormous vehicle, Floyd told himself with some incredulity - yet alsowith some pride - is waiting for me. As far as he knew, it was the first timethat an entire mission had been set up to take a single man to the Moon.Though, it was two o'clock in the morning, a group of reporters and cameramenintercepted him on his way to the floodlit Orion III spacecraft. He knew severalof them by sight, for as Chairman of the National Council of Astronautics, thenews conference was part of his way of life. This was neither the time nor theplace for one, and he had nothing to say; but it was important not to offend thegentlemen of the communications media.\"Dr. Floyd? I'm Jim Forster of Associated News. Could you give us a few wordsabout this flight of yours?\"\"I'm very sorry - I can't say anything.\"\"But you did meet with the President earlier this evening?\" asked a familiarvoice.\"Oh - hello, Mike. I'm afraid you've been dragged out of bed for nothing.Definitely no comment.\"\"Can you at least confirm or deny that some kind of epidemic has broken out onthe Moon?\" a TV reporter asked, managing to jog alongside and keep Floydproperly framed in his miniature TV camera.\"Sorry,\" said Floyd, shaking his head.\"What about the quarantine?\" asked another reporter. \"How long will it be kepton?\"\"Still no comment.\"\"Dr. Floyd,\" demanded a very short and determined lady of the press, \"whatpossible justification can there be for this total blackout of news from theMoon? Has it anything to do with the political situation?\"\"What political situation?\" Floyd asked dryly. There was a sprinkle of laughter,and someone called, \"Have a good trip, Doctor!\" as he made his way into thesanctuary of the boarding gantry.As long, as he could remember, it had been not a \"situation\" so much as apermanent crisis. Since the 1970s, the world had been dominated by two problemswhich, ironically, tended to cancel each other out.Though birth control was cheap, reliable, and endorsed by all the mainreligions, it had come too late; the population of the world was now six billion- a third of them in the Chinese Empire. Laws had even been passed in someauthoritarian societies limiting families to two children, but their enforcementhad proved impracticable. As a result, food was short in every country; even theUnited States had meatless days, and widespread famine was predicted withinfifteen years, despite heroic efforts to farm the sea and to develop syntheticfoods.With the need for international cooperation more urgent than ever, there werestill as many frontiers as in any earlier age. In a million years, the humanrace had lost few of its aggressive instincts; along symbolic lines visible onlyto politicians, the thirty-eight nuclear powers watched one another withbelligerent anxiety. Among them, they possessed sufficient megatonnage to removethe entire surface crust of the planet. Although there had been - miraculously -no use of atomic weapons, this situation could hardly last forever.And now, for their own inscrutable reasons, the Chinese were offering to thesmallest have-not nations a complete nuclear capability of fifty warheads anddelivery systems. The cost was under $200,000,000, and easy terms could bearranged.Perhaps they were only trying to shore up their sagging economy, by turningobsolete weapons systems into hard cash, as some observers had suggested. Orperhaps they had discovered methods of warfare so advanced that they no longerhad need of such toys; there had been talk of radio-hypnosis from satellitetransmitters, compulsion viruses, and blackmail by synthetic diseases for whichthey alone possessed the antidote.These charming ideas were almost certainly propaganda or pure fantasy, but itwas not safe to discount any of them. Every time Floyd took off from Earth, hewondered if it would still be there when the time came to return.The trim stewardess greeted him as he entered the cabin. \"Good morning, Dr.Floyd. I'm Miss Simmons - I'd like to welcome you aboard on behalf of CaptainTynes and our copilot, First Officer Ballard.\"\"Thank you,\" said Floyd with a smile, wondering why stewardesses always had tosound like robot tour guides.\"Takeoff's in five minutes,\" she said, gesturing into the empty twentypassengercabin. \"You can take any seat you want, but Captain Tynes recommends the forwardwindow seat on the left, if you want to watch the docking operations.\"\"I'll do that,\" he answered, moving toward the preferred seat. The stewardessfussed over him awhile and then moved to her cubicle at the rear of the cabin.Floyd settled down in his seat, adjusted the safety harness around waist andshoulders, and strapped his briefcase to the adjacent seat. A moment later, theloudspeaker came on with a soft popping noise. \"Good morning,\" said MissSimmons' voice. \"This is Special Flight 3, Kennedy to Space Station One.\"She was determined, it seemed, to go through the full routine for her solitarypassenger, and Floyd could not resist a smile as she continued inexorably.\"Our transit time will be fifty-five minutes. Maximum acceleration will betwo-gee, and we will be weightless for thirty minutes. Please do not leave yourseat until the safety sign is lit.\"Floyd looked over his shoulder and called, \"Thank you.\" He caught a glimpse of aslightly embarrassed but charming smile.He leaned back into his seat and relaxed. This trip, he calculated, would costthe taxpayers slightly over a million dollars. If it was not justified, he wouldbe out of his job; but he could always go back to the university and to hisinterrupted studies of planetary formation.\"Auto-countdown procedures all Go,\" the captain's voice said over the speakerwith the soothing singsong used in RT chat. \"Lift-off in one minute.\"As always, it seemed more like an hour. Floyd became acutely aware of thegigantic forces coiled up around him, waiting to be released. In the fuel tanksof the two spacecraft, and in the power storage system of the launching track,was pent up the energy of a nuclear bomb. And it would all be used to take him amere two hundred miles from Earth.There was none of the old-fashioned FIVE-FOIJR-THREE-TWO-ONE-ZERO business, sotough on the human nervous system.\"Launching in fifteen seconds. You will be more comfortable if you startbreathing deeply.\"That was good psychology, and good physiology.Floyd felt himself well charged with oxygen, and ready to tackle anything, whenthe launching track began to sling its thousand-ton payload out over theAtlantic.It was hard to tell when they lifted from the track and became airborne, butwhen the roar of the rockets suddenly doubled its fury, and Floyd found himselfsinking deeper and deeper into the cushions of his seat, he knew that thefirststage engines had taken over. He wished he could look out of the window,but it was an effort even to turn his head, Yet there was no discomfort; indeed,the pressure of acceleration and the overwhelming thunder of the motors producedan extraordinary euphoria. His ears ringing, the blood pounding in his veins,Floyd felt more alive than he had for years. He was young again, he wanted tosing aloud - which was certainly safe, for no one could possibly hear him.The mood passed swiftly, as he suddenly realized that he was leaving Earth, andeverything he had ever loved. Down there were his three children, motherlesssince his wife had taken that fatal flight to Europe ten years ago. (Ten years?Impossible! Yet it was so...) Perhaps, for their sake, he should have remarried.He had almost lost sense of time when the pressure and the noise abruptlyslackened, and the cabin speaker announced: \"Preparing to separate from lowerstage. Here we go.\"There was a slight jolt; and suddenly Floyd recalled a quotation of Leonardo daVinci's which he had once seen displayed in a NASA office:The Great Bird will take its flight on the back of the great bird, bringingglory to the nest where it was born.Well, the Great Bird was flying now, beyond all the dreams of da Vinci, and itsexhausted companion was winging back to earth. In a ten-thousand-mile arc, theempty lower stage would glide down into the atmosphere, trading speed fordistance as it homed on Kennedy. In a few hours, serviced and refueled, it wouldbe ready again to lift another companion toward the shining silence with itcould never reach.Now, thought Floyd, we are on our own, more than halfway to orbit. When theacceleration came on again, as the upper stage rockets fired, the thrust wasmuch more gentle: indeed, he felt no more than normal gravity. But it would havebeen impossible to walk, since \"Up\" was straight toward the front of the cabin.If he had been foolish enough to leave his seat, he would have crashed at onceagainst the rear wall.This effect was a little disconcerting, for it seemed that the ship was standingon its tail. To Floyd, who was at the very front of the cabin, all the seatsappeared to be fixed on a wall topping vertically beneath him. He was doing hisbest to ignore this uncomfortable illusion when dawn exploded outside the ship.In seconds, they shot through veils of crimson and pink and gold and blue intothe piercing white of day.Though the windows were heavily tinted to reduce the glare, the probing beams ofsunlight that now slowly swept across the cabin left Floyd half-blinded forseveral minutes. He was in space, yet there was no question of being able to seethe stars.He shielded his eyes with his hands and tried to peer through the window besidehim. Out there the swept-back wing of the ship was blazing like white-hot metalin the reflected sunlight; there was utter darkness all around it, and thatdarkness must be full of stars - but it was impossible to see them.Weight was slowly ebbing; the rockets were being throttled back as the shipeased itself into orbit. The thunder of the engines dropped to a muted roar,then a gentle hiss, then died into silence. If it had not been for therestraining straps, Floyd would have floated out of his seat; his stomach feltas if it was going to do so anyway. He hoped that the pills he had been givenhalf an hour and ten thousand miles ago would perform as per specifications. Hehad been spacesick just once in his career, and that was much too often.The pilot's voice was firm and confident as it came over the cabin speaker.\"Please observe all Zero-gee regulations. We will be docking at Space StationOne in forty-five minutes.\"The stewardess came walking up the narrow corridor to the right of the closelyspaced seats. There was a slight buoyancy about her steps, and her feet cameaway from the floor reluctantly as if entangled in glue. She was keeping to thebright yellow band of Velcro carpeting that ran the full length of the floor- and of the ceiling. The carpet, and the soles of her sandals, were coveredwith myriads of tiny hooks, so that they clung together like burrs. This trickof walking in free fall was immensely reassuring to disoriented passengers.\"Would you like some coffee or tea, Dr. Floyd?\" she asked cheerfully.\"No thank you,\" he smiled. He always felt like a baby when he had to suck at oneof those plastic drinking tubes.The stewardess was still hovering anxiously around him as he popped open hisbriefcase and prepared to remove his papers.\"Dr. Floyd, may I ask you a question?\"\"Certainly,\" he answered, looking up over his glasses. \"My fiancé is a geologistat Clavius,\" said Miss Simmons, measuring her words carefully, \"and I haven'theard from him for over a week.\"\"I'm sorry to hear that; maybe he's away from his base, and out of touch.\"She shook her head. \"He always tells me when that's going to happen. And you canimagine how worried I am - with all these rumors. Is it really true about anepidemic on the Moon?\"\"If it is, there's no cause for alarm.. Remember, there was a quarantine back in'98, over that mutated flu virus. A lot of people were sick - but no one died,And that's really all I can say,\" he concluded firmly.Miss Simmons smiled pleasantly and straightened up. \"Well, thank you anyway,Doctor. I'm sorry to have bothered you.\"\"No bother at all,\" he said gallantly, but not very accurately. Then he buriedhimself in his endless technical reports, in a desperate last-minute assault onthe usual backlog;He would have no time for reading when he got to the Moon.8 - Orbital RendezvousHalf an hour later the pilot announced: \"We make contact in ten minutes. Pleasecheck your seat harness.\"Floyd obeyed, and put away his papers. It was asking for trouble to read duringthe celestial juggling act which took place during the last 300 miles; best toclose one's eyes and relax while the spacecraft was nudged back and forth withbrief bursts of rocket power.A few minutes later he caught his first glimpse of Space Station One, only a fewmiles away. The sunlight glinted and sparkled from the polished metal surfacesof the slowly revolving, three-hundred-yard-diameter disk. Not far away,drifting in the same orbit, was a sweptback Titov-V spaceplane, and close tothat an almost spherical Aries-1B, the workhorse of space, with the four stubbylegs of its lunar-landing shock absorbers jutting from one side.The Orion III spacecraft was descending from a higher orbit, which brought theEarth into spectacular view behind the Station. From his altitude of 200miles, Floyd could see much of Africa and the Atlantic Ocean. There wasconsiderable cloud cover, but he could still detect the blue-green outlines ofthe Gold Coast.The central axis of the Space Station, with its docking arms extended, was nowslowly swimming toward them. Unlike the structure from which it sprang, it wasnot rotating - or, rather, it was running in reverse at a rate which exactlycountered the Station's own spin. Thus a visiting spacecraft could be coupled toit, for the transfer of personnel or cargo, without being whirled disastrouslyaround.With the softest of thuds, ship and Station made contact. There were metallic,scratching noises from outside, then the brief hissing of air as pressuresequalized.A few seconds later the airlock door opened, and a man wearing the light,close-fitting slacks and short-sleeved shirt which was almost the uniform ofSpace Station personnel came into the cabin.\"Pleased to meet you, Dr. Floyd. I'm Nick Miller, Station Security; I'm to lookafter you until the shuttle leaves.\"They shook hands, then Floyd smiled at the stewardess and said: \"Please give mycompliments to Captain Tynes, and thank him for the smooth ride. Perhaps I'llsee you on the way home.\"Very cautiously - it was more than a year since he had last been weightless andit would be some time before he regained his spacelegs - he hauled himself handover hand through the airlock and into the large, circular chamber at the axisof the Space Station. It was a heavily padded room, its walls covered withrecessed handholds; Floyd gripped one of these firmly while the whole chamberstarted to rotate, until it matched the spin of the Station.As it gained speed, faint and ghostly gravitational fingers began to clutch athim, and he drifted slowly toward the circular wall. Now he was standing,swaying back and forth gently like seaweed in the surge of the tide, on what hadmagically become a curving floor. The centrifugal force of the Station's spinhad taken hold of him; it was very feeble here, so near the axis, but wouldincrease steadily as he moved outward.From the central transit chamber he followed Miller down a curving stair. Atfirst his weight was so slight that he had almost to force himself downward byholding on to the handrail. Not until he reached the passenger lounge, on theouter skin of the great revolving disk, had he acquired enough weight to movearound almost normally.The lounge had been redecorated since his last visit, and had acquired severalnew facilities. Besides the usual chairs, small tables, restaurant, and postoffice there were now a barber shop, drugstore, movie theater and a souvenirshop selling photographs and slides of lunar and planetary landscapes,guaranteed genuine pieces of Luniks, Rangers, and Surveyors, all neatly mountedin plastic, and exorbitantly priced.\"Can I get you anything while we're waiting?\" Miller asked. \"We board in aboutthirty minutes?'\"I could do with a cup of black coffee - two lumps - and I'd like to callEarth.\"\"Right, Doctor - I'll get the coffee - the phones are over there.\"The picturesque booths were only a few yards from a barrier with two entranceslabeled WELCOME TO THE U.S. SECTION and WELCOME TO THE SOVIET SECTION.Beneath these were notices which read, in English, Russian, and Chinese, French,German, and Spanish.PLEASE HAVE READY YOUR:PassportVisaMedical CertificateTransportation PermitWeight DeclarationThere was a rather pleasant symbolism about the fact that as soon as they hadpassed through the barriers, in either direction, passengers were free to mixagain. The division was purely for administrative purposes.Floyd, after checking that the Area Code for the United States was still 81,punched his twelve-digit home number, dropped his plastic all-purpose creditcard into the pay slot, and was through in thirty seconds.Washington was still sleeping, for it was several hours to dawn, but he wouldnot disturb anyone. His housekeeper would get the message from the recorder assoon as she awoke.\"Miss Flemming - this is Dr. Floyd. Sorry I had to leave in such a hurry. Wouldyou please call my office and ask them to collect the car - it's at DullesAirport and the key is with Mr. Bailey, Senior Flight Control Officer. Next,will you call the Chevy Chase Country Club and leave a message for thesecretary. I definitely won't be able to play in the tennis tournament nextweekend. Give my apologies - I'm afraid they were counting on me. Then callDowntown Electronies and tell them that if the video in my study isn't fixed by- oh, Wednesday - they can take the damn thing back.\" He paused for breath, andtried to think of any other crises or problems that might arise during the daysahead.\"If you run short of cash, speak to the office; they can get urgent messages tome, but I may be too busy to answer. Give my love to the children, and say I'llbe back as soon as I can. Oh, hell - here's someone I don't want to see - I'llcall from the Moon if I can - good-bye.\"Floyd tried to duck out of the booth, but it was too late; he had already beenspotted. Bearing down on him through the Soviet Section exit was Dr. DimitriMoisevitch, of the U.S.S.R. Academy of Science. Dimitri was one of Floyd's bestfriends; and for that very reason, he was the last person he wished to talk to,here and now.9 - Moon ShuttleThe Russian astronomer was tall, slender, and blond, and his unlined face beliedhis fifty-five years - the last ten of which had been spent building up thegiant radio observatory on the far side of the Moon, where two thousand miles ofsolid rock would shield it from the eletronic racket of Earth.\"Why, Heywood,\" he said, shaking hands firmly. \"It's a small universe... How areyou - and your charming children?\"\"We're fine,\" Floyd replied warmly, but with a slightly distracted air. \"Weoften talk about the wonderful time you gave us last summer.\" He was sorry hecould not sound more sincere; they really had enjoyed a week's vacation inOdessa with Dimitri during one of the Russian's visits to Earth.\"And you - I suppose you're on your way up?\" Dimitri inquired.\"Er, yes - my flight leaves in half an hour,\" answered Floyd. \"Do you know Mr.Miller?\"The Security Officer had now approached, and was standing at a respectfuldistance holding a plastic cup full of coffee.\"Of course. But please put that down, Mr. Miller. This is Dr. Floyd's lastchance to have a civilized drink - let's not waste it. No - I insist.\"They followed Dimitri out of the main lounge into the observation section, andsoon were sitting at a table under a dim light watching the moving panorama ofthe stars. Space Station One revolved once a minute, and the centrifugal forcegenerated by this slow spin produced an artificial gravity equal to the Moon's.This, it had been discovered, was a good compromise between Earth gravity and nogravity at all; moreover, it gave moon-bound passengers a chance to becomeacclimatized.Outside the almost invisible windows, Earth and stars marched in a silentprocession. At the moment, this side of the Station was tilted away from thesun; otherwise, it would have been impossible to look out, for the lounge wouldhave been blasted with light. Even as it was, the glare of the Earth, fillinghalf the sky, drowned all but the brighter stars.But Earth was waning, as the Station orbited toward the night side of theplanet; in a few minutes it would be a huge black disk, spangled with the lightsof cities. And then the sky would belong to the stars.\"Now,\" said Dimitri, after he had swiftly downed his first drink and was toyingwith the second, \"what's all this about an epidemic in the U.S. Sector? I wantedto go there on this trip. 'No, Professor,' they told me. 'We're very sorry, butthere's a strict quarantine until further notice.' I pulled all the strings Icould; It was no use. Now you tell me what's happening.\"Floyd groaned inwardly. Here we go again, he said. The sooner I'm on thatshuttle, headed for the Moon, the happier I'll be.\"The - ah - quarantine is purely a safety precaution,\" he said cautiously.'We're not even sure it's really necessary, but we don't believe in takingchances.\"\"But what is the disease - what are the symptoms? Could it be extraterrestrial?Do you want any help from our medical services?\"\"I'm sorry, Dimitri - we've been asked not to say anything at the moment. Thanksfor the offer, but we can handle the situation.\"\"Hmm,\" said Moisevitch, obviously quite unconvinced. \"Seems odd to me that you,an astronomer, should be sent up to the Moon to look into an epidemic.\"\"I'm only an ex-astronomer; it's years since I did any real research. Now I'm ascientific expert; that means I know nothing about absolutely everything.\"\"Then do you know what TMA-1 means?\"Miller seemed about to choke on his drink, but Floyd was made of sterner stuff.He looked his old friend straight in the eye, and said calmly: \"TMA-1?What an odd expression. Where did you hear it?\"\"Never mind,\" retorted the Russian. \"You can't fool me. But if you've run intosomething you can't handle, I hope you don't leave it until too late before youyell for help.\"Miller looked meaningfully at his watch.\"Due to board in five minutes, Dr. Floyd,\" he said. \"I think we'd better getmoving.\"Though he knew that they still had a good twenty minutes, Floyd got up withhaste. Too much haste, for he had forgotten the one-sixth of a gravity. Hegrabbed the table just in time to prevent a takeoff.\"It was fine meeting you, Dimitri,\" he said, not quite accurately. \"Hope youhave a good trip down to Earth - I'll give you a call as soon as I'm back.\"As they left the lounge, and checked through the U.S. transit barrier, Floydremarked: \"Phew - that was close. Thanks for rescuing me.\"\"You know, Doctor,\" said the Security Officer, \"I hope he isn't right.\"\"Right about what?\"\"About us running into something we can't handle.\"\"That,\" Floyd answered with determination, \"is what I intend to find out.\"Forty-five minutes later, the Aries-lB lunar carrier pulled away from theStation. There was none of the power and fury of a takeoff from Earth - only analmost inaudible, far-off whistling as the low-thrust plasma jets blasted theirelectrified streams into space. The gentle push lasted for more than fifteenminutes, and the mild acceleration would not have prevented anyone from movingaround the cabin. But when it was over, the ship was no longer bound to Earth,as it had been while it still accompanied the Station. It had broken the bondsof gravity and was now a free and independent planet, circling the sun in anorbit of its own.The cabin Floyd now had all to himself had been designed for thirty passengers.It was strange, and rather lonely, to see all the empty seats around him, and tohave the undivided attention of the steward and stewardess - not to mentionpilot, copilot, and two engineers. He doubted that any man in history had everreceived such exclusive service, and it was most unlikely that anyone would doso in the future. He recalled the cynical remark of one of the less reputablepontiffs: \"Now that we have the papacy, let us enjoy it.\" Well, he would enjoythis tip, and the euphoria of weightlessness. With the loss of gravity he had -at least for a while - shed most of his cares. Someone had once said that youcould be terrified in space, but you could not be worried there. It wasperfectly true.The stewards, it appeared, were determined to make him eat for the wholetwenty-five hours of the trip, and he was continually fending off unwantedmeals. Eating in zero gravity was no real problem, contrary to the darkforebodings of the early astronauts. He sat at an ordinary table, to which theplates were clipped, as aboard ship in a rough sea. All the courses had someelement of stickiness, so that they would not take off and go wandering roundthe cabin. Thus a chop would be glued to the plate by a thick sauce, and a saladkept under control by an adhesive dressing. With a little skill and care therewere few items that could not be tackled safely; the only things banned were hotsoups and excessively crumbly pastries. Drinks of course, were a differentmatter; all liquids simply had to be kept in plastic squeeze tubes.A whole generation of research by heroic but unsung volunteers had gone into thedesign of the washroom, and it was now considered to be more or less foolproof.Floyd investigated it soon after free fall had begun. He found himself in alittle cubicle with all the fittings of an ordinary airline toilet, butilluminated with a red light that was very harsh and unpleasant to the eye. Anotice printed in prominent letters announced: MOST IMPORTANT! FOR YOUR OWNCOMFORT, PLEASE READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY!Floyd sat down (one still tended to do so, even when weightless) and read thenotice several times. When he was sure that there had been no modificationssince his last trip, he pressed the START button.Close at hand, an electric motor began to whirr, and Floyd felt himself moving.As the notice advised him to do, he closed his eyes and waited. After a minute,a bell chimed softly and he looked around.The light had now changed to a soothing pinkish-white; but, more important, hewas under gravity again.Only the faintest vibration revealed that it was a spurious gravity, caused bythe carrousel-like spin of the whole toilet compartment. Floyd picked up a pieceof soap, and watched it drop in slow motion; he judged that the centrifugalforce was about a quarter of a normal gravity. But that was quite enough; itwould ensure that everything moved in the right direction, in the one placewhere this mattered most.He pressed the STOP FOR EXIT button, and closed his eyes again. Weight slowlyebbed as the rotation ceased, the bell gave a double chime, and the red warninglight was back. The door was then locked in the right position to let him glideout into the cabin, where he adhered as quickly as possible to the carpet. Hehad long ago exhausted the novelty of weightlessness, and was grateful for theVelcro slippers that allowed him to walk almost normally.There was plenty to occupy his time, even if he did nothing but sit and read.When he tired of official reports and memoranda and minutes, he would plug hisfoolscap-sized Newspad into the ship's information circuit and scan the latestreports from Earth. One by one he would conjure up the world's major electronicpapers; he knew the codes of the more important ones by heart, and had no needto consult the list on the back of his pad. Switching to the display unit'sshort-term memory, he would hold the front page while he quickly searched theheadlines and noted the items that interested him.Each had its own two-digit reference; when he punched that, thepostagestamp-sized rectangle would expand until it neatly filled the screen andhe could read it with comfort. When he had finished, he would flash back to thecomplete page and select a new subject for detailed examination.Floyd sometimes wondered if the Newspad, and the fantastic technology behind it,was the last word in man's quest for perfect communications. Here he was, farout in space, speeding away from Earth at thousands of miles an hour, yet in afew milliseconds he could see the headlines of any newspaper he pleased. (Thatvery word \"newspaper,\" of course, was an anachronistic hangover into the age ofelectronics.) The text was updated automatically on every hour; even if one readonly the English versions, one could spend an entire lifetime doing nothing butabsorbing the ever-changing flow of information from the news satellites.It was hard to imagine how the system could be improved or made more convenient.But sooner or later, Floyd guessed, it would pass away, to be replaced bysomething as unimaginable as the Newspad itself would have been to Caxton orGutenberg.There was another thought which a scanning of those tiny electronic headlinesoften invoked. The more wonderful the means of communication, the more trivial,tawdry, or depressing its contents seemed to be. Accidents, crimes, natural andman-made disasters, threats of conflict, gloomy editorials - these still seemedto be the main concern of the millions of words being sprayed into the ether.Yet Floyd also wondered if this was altogether a bad thing; the newspapers ofUtopia, he had long ago decided, would be terribly dull.From time to time the captain and the other members of the crew came into thecabin and exchanged a few words with him. They treated their distinguishedpassenger with awe, and were doubtless burning with curiosity about his mission,but were too polite to ask any questions or even to drop any hints.Only the charming little stewardess seemed completely at ease in his presence.As Floyd quickly discovered, she came from Bali, and had carried beyond theatmosphere some of the grace and mystery of that still largely unspoiled island.One of his strangest, and most enchanting, memories of the entire trip was herzero-gravity demonstration of some classical Balinese dance movements, with thelovely, blue-green crescent of the waning Earth as a backdrop.There was one sleep period, when the main cabin lights were switched off andFloyd fastened down his arms and legs with the elastic sheets that would preventhim from drifting away into space. It seemed a crude arrangement - but here inzero gravity his unpadded couch was more comfortable than the most luxuriousmattress on Earth.When he had strapped himself in, Floyd dozed off quickly enough, but woke uponce in a drowsy, half-conscious condition, to be completely baffled by hisstrange surroundings. For a moment he thought that be was in the middle of somedimly lit Chinese lantern; the faint glow from the other cubicles around himgave that impression. Then he said to himself, firmly and successfully: \"Go tosleep, boy. This is just an ordinary moon shuttle.\"When he awoke, the Moon had swallowed up half the sky, and the braking maneuverswere about to begin.The wide arc of windows set in the curving wall of the passenger section nowlooked out onto the open sky, not the approaching globe, so he moved into thecontrol cabin. Here, on the rear-view TV screens, he could watch the finalstages of the descent.The approaching lunar mountains were utterly unlike those of Earth; they lackedthe dazzling caps of snow, the green, close-fitting garments of vegetation, themoving crowns of cloud, Nevertheless, the fierce contrasts of light and shadowgave them a strange beauty of their own. The laws of earthly aesthetics did notapply here; this world had been shaped and molded by other than terrestrialforces, operating over eons of time unknown to the young, verdant Earth, withits fleeting Ice Ages, its swiftly rising and falling seas, its mountain rangesdissolving like mists before the dawn. Here was age inconceivable - but notdeath, for the Moon had never lived - until now.The descending ship was poised almost above the line dividing night from day,and directly below was a chaos of jagged shadows and brilliant, isolated peakscatching the first light of the slow lunar dawn. That would be a fearful placeto attempt a landing, even with all possible electronic aids; but they wereslowly drifting away from it, toward the night side of the Moon.Then Floyd saw, as his eyes grew more accustomed to the fainter illumination,that the night land was not wholly dark. It was aglow with a ghostly light, inwhich peaks and valleys and plains could be clearly seen. The Earth, a giantmoon to the Moon, was flooding the land below with its radiance.On the pilot's panel, lights flashed above radar screens, numbers came and wenton computer displays, clocking off the distance of the approaching Moon. Theywere still more than a thousand miles away when weight returned as the jetsbegan their gentle but steady deceleration. For ages, it seemed, the Moon slowlyexpanded across the sky, the sun sank below the horizon, and at last a singlegiant crater filled the field of view.The shuttle was falling toward its central peaks - and suddenly Floyd noticedthat near one of those peaks a brilliant light was flashing with a regularrhythm. It might have been an airport beacon back on Earth, and he stared at itwith a tightening of the throat. It was proof that men had established anotherfoothold on the Moon.Now the crater had expanded so much that its ramparts were slipping below thehorizon, and the smaller craterlets that peppered its interior were beginning todisclose their real size. Some of these, tiny though they had seemed from farout in space, were miles across, and could have swallowed whole cities.Under its automatic controls, the shuttle was sliding down the starlit sky,toward that barren landscape glimmering in the light of the great gibbous Earth.Now a voice was calling somewhere above the whistle of the jets and theelectronic beepings that came and went through the cabin.\"Clavius Control to Special 14, you are coming in nicely. Please make manualcheck of landing-gear lock, hydraulic pressure, shock-pad inflation.\"The pilot pressed sundry switches, green lights flashed, and he called back,\"All manual checks completed. Landing-gear lock, hydraulic pressure, shock padO.K.\"\"Confirmed,\" said the Moon, and the descent continued wordlessly. Though therewas still plenty of talking, it was all being done by machines, flashing binaryimpulses to one another at a thousand times the rate their slow-thinking makerscould communicate.Some of the mountain peaks were already towering above the shuttle; now theground was only a few thousand feet away, and the beacon light was a brilliantstar, flashing steadily above a group of low buildings and odd vehicles. In thefinal stage of the descent, the jets seemed to be playing some strange tune;they pulsed on and off, making the last fine adjustments to the thrust.Abruptly, a swirling cloud of dust hid everything, the jets gave one finalspurt, and the shuttle rocked very slightly, like a rowboat when a small wavegoes by. It was some minutes before Floyd could really accept the silence thatnow enfolded him and the weak gravity that gripped his limbs.He had made, utterly without incident and in little more than one day, theincredible journey of which men had dreamed for two thousand years. After anormal routine flight, he had landed on the Moon.10 - Clavius BaseClavius, 150 miles in diameter, is the second largest crater on the visible faceof the Moon, and lies in the center of the Southern Highlands. It is very old;ages of vulcanism and bombardment from space have scarred its walls andpockmarked its floor. But since the last era of crater formation, when thedebris from the asteroid belt was still battering the inner planets, it hadknown peace for half a billion years.Now there were new, strange stirrings on and below its surface, for here Man wasestablishing his first permanent bridgehead on the Moon. Clavius Base could, inan emergency, be entirely self-supporting. All the necessities of life wereproduced from the local rocks, - after they had been crushed, heated, andchemically processed. Hydrogen, oxygen; carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus - allthese, and most of the other elements, could be found inside the Moon, if oneknew where to look for them. The Base was a closed system, like a tiny workingmodel of Earth itself, recycling all the chemicals of life. The atmosphere waspurified in a vast \"hothouse\" - a large, circular room buried just below thelunar surface. Under blazing lamps by night, and filtered sunlight by day, acresof stubby green plants grew in a warm, moist atmosphere. They were specialmutations, designed for the express purpose of replenishing the air with oxygen,and providing food as a by-product. More food was produced by chemicalprocessing systems and algae culture. Although the green scum circulatingthrough yards of transparent plastic tubes would scarcely have appealed to agourmet, the biochemists could convert it into chops and steaks only an expertcould distinguish from the real thing.The eleven hundred men and six hundred women who made up the personnel of theBase were all highly trained scientists or technicians, carefully selectedbefore they had left Earth. Though lunar living was now virtually free from thehardships, disadvantages, and occasional dangers of the early days, it was stillpsychologically demanding, and not recommended for anyone suffering fromclaustrophobia. Since it was expensive and time-consuming to cut a largeunderground base out of solid rock or compacted lava, the standard one-man\"living module\" was a room only about six feet wide, ten feet long, and eightfeet high.Each room was attractively furnished and looked very much like a good motelsuite, with convertible sofa, TV, small hi-fi set, and vision-phone. Moreover,by a simple trick of interior decoration, the one unbroken wall could beconverted by the flip of a switch into a convincing terrestrial landscape. Therewas a choice of eight views. This touch of luxury was typical of the Base,though it was sometimes hard to explain its necessity to the folk back on Earth.Every man and woman in Clavius had cost a hundred thousand dollars in trainingand transport and housing; it was worth a little extra to maintain their peaceof mind. This was not art for art's sake, but art for the sake of sanity.One of the attractions of life in the base - and on the Moon as a whole - wasundoubtedly the low gravity, which produced a sense of general well-being.However, this had its dangers, and it was several weeks before an emigrant fromEarth could adapt to it. On the Moon, the human body had to learn a whole newset of reflexes. It had, for the first time, to distinguish between mass andweight.A man who weighed one hundred eighty pounds on Earth might be delighted todiscover that he weighed only thirty pounds on the Moon. As long as he moved ina straight line at a uniform speed, he felt a wonderful sense of buoyancy. Butas soon as he attempted to change course, to turn corners, or to stop suddenly -then he would find that his full one hundred eighty pounds of mass, or inertia,was still there. For that was fixed and unalterable - the same on Earth, Moon,Sun, or in free space. Before one could be properly adapted to lunar living,therefore, it was essential to learn that all objects were now six times assluggish as their mere weight would suggest. It was a lesson usually driven homeby numerous collisions and hard knocks, and old lunar hands kept their distancefrom newcomers until they were acclimatized.With its complex of workshops, offices, storerooms, computer center, generators,garage, kitchen, laboratories, and food-processing plant, Clavius Base was aminiature world in itself. And, ironically, many of the skills that had beenused to build this underground empire had been developed during the half centuryof the Cold War.Any man who had ever worked in a hardened missile site would have felt at homein Clavius. Here on the Moon were the same arts and hardware of undergroundliving, and of protection against a hostile environment; but here they had beenturned to the purposes of peaee.After ten thousand years, man had at last found something as exciting as war.Unfortunately, not all nations had yet realized that fact.The mountains that had been so prominent just before landing had mysteriouslydisappeared, hidden from sight below the steeply curving lunar horizon. Aroundthe spacecraft was a flat, gray plain; brilliantly lit by the slantingearthlight. Although the sky was, of course, completely black, only the brighterstars and planets could be seen, unless the eyes were shaded from the surfaceglare.Several very odd vehicles were rolling up to the Aries-lB spaceship - cranes,hoists, servicing trucks - some automatic, some operated by a driver in a smallpressure cabin. Most of them moved on balloon tires, for this smooth, levelplain posed no transportation difficulties; but one tanker rolled on thepeculiar flex-wheels which had proved one of the best all-purpose ways ofgetting around on the Moon. A series of flat plates arranged in a circle, eachplate independently mounted and sprung, the flex-wheel had many of theadvantages of the caterpillar track from which it had evolved. It would adaptits shape and diameter to the terrain over which it was moving, and, unlike acaterpillar track, would continue to function even if a few sections weremissing.A small bus with an extension tube like a stubby elephant trunk was now nuzzlingaffectionately up against the spacecraft. A few seconds later, there werebangings and bumpings from outside, followed by the sound of hissing air asconnections were made and pressure was equalized. The inner door of the airlockopened, and the welcoming delegation entered.It was led by Ralph Halvorsen, the Administrator of the Southern Province -which meant not only the Base but also any exploring parties that operated fromit.With him was his Chief Scientist, Dr. Roy Michaels, a grizzled littlegeophysicist whom Floyd knew from previous visits, and half a dozen seniorscientists and executives. They greeted him with respectful relief; from theAdministrator downward, it was obvious that they looked forward to a chance ofunloading some of their worries.\"Very pleased to have you with us, Dr. Floyd,\" said Halvorsen. \"Did you have agood trip?\"\"Excellent,\" Floyd answered. \"It couldn't have been better. The crew lookedafter me very well.\" He exchanged the usual small talk that courtesy demandedwhile the bus rolled away from the spacecraft; by unspoken agreement, no onementioned the reason for his visit. After traveling a thousand feet from thelanding site, the bus came to a large sign which read:WELCOME TO CLAVIUS BASEU.S. Astronautical Engineering Corps1994It then dived into a cutting which took it quickly below ground level. A massivedoor opened ahead, then closed behind them. This happened again, and yet a thirdtime. When the last door had closed, there was a great roaring of air, and theywere back in atmosphere once more, in the shirt-sleeve environment of the Base.After a short walk through a tunnel packed with pipes and cables, and echoinghollowly with rhythmic thumpings and throbbings, they arrived in executiveterritory, and Floyd found himself back in the familiar environment oftypewriters, office computers, girl assistants, wall charts, and ringingtelephones. As they paused outside the door labeled ADMINISTRATOR, Halvorsensaid diplomatically: \"Dr. Floyd and I will be along to the briefing room in acouple of minutes.\"The others nodded, made agreeable sounds, and drifted off down the corridor. Butbefore Halvorsen could usher Floyd into his office, there was an interruption,The door opened, and a small figure hurled itself at the Administrator.\"Daddy! You've been Topside! And you promised to take me!\"\"Now, Diana,\" said Halvorsen, with exasperated tenderness, \"I only said I'd takeyou if I could. But I've been very busy meeting Dr. Floyd. Shake hands with him- he's just come from Earth.\"The little girl - Floyd judged that she was about eight - extended a limp hand.Her face was vaguely familiar, and Floyd suddenly became aware that theAdministrator was looking at him with a quizzical smile. With a shock ofrecollection, he understood why.\"I don't believe it!\" he exclaimed. \"When I was here last she was just a baby!\"\"She had her fourth birthday last week,\" Halvorsen answered proudly.\"Children grow fast in this low gravity. But they don't age so quickly - they'lllive longer than we do.\"Floyd stared in fascination at the self-assured little lady, noting the gracefulcarriage and the unusually delicate bone structure. \"It's nice to meet youagain, Diana,\" he said. Then something - perhaps sheer curiosity, perhapspoliteness - impelled him to add: \"Would you like to go to Earth?\"Her eyes widened with astonishment; then she shook her head.\"It's a nasty place; you hurt yourself when you fall down. Besides, there aretoo many people,\"So here, Floyd told himself, is the first generation of the Spaceborn; therewould be more of them in the years to come. Though there was sadness in thisthought, there was also a great hope. When Earth was tamed and tranquil, andperhaps a little tired, there would still be scope for those who loved freedom,for the tough pioneers, the restless adventurers. But their tools would not beax and gun and canoe and wagon; they would be nuclear power plant and plasmadrive and hydroponic farm. The time was fast approaching when Earth, like allmothers, must say farewell to her children.With a mixture of threats and promises, Halvorsen managed to evict hisdetermined offspring and led Floyd into the office. The Administrator's suitewas only about fifteen feet square, but it managed to contain all the fittingsand status symbols of the typical $50,000 a year head of a department. Signedphotographs of important politicians - including the President of the UnitedStates and the Secretary General of the United Nations - adorned one wall, whilesigned photos of celebrated astronauts covered most of another.Floyd sank into a comfortable leather chair and was given a glass of\"sherry,\" courtesy of the lunar biochemical labs. \"How's it going, Ralph?\" Floydasked, sipping the drink with caution, then with approval.\"Not too bad,\" Halvorsen replied. \"However, there is something you'd better knowabout, before you go in there.\"\"What is it?'\"Well, I suppose you could describe it as a morale problem,\" Halvorsen sighed.\"Oh?\"\"It isn't serious yet, but it's getting there fast.\" \"The news blackout,\" Floydsaid flatly. \"Right,\" Halvorsen replied. \"My people are getting very steamed upabout it. After all, most of them have families back on Earth; they probablybelieve they're all dead of moon-plague.\"\"I'm sorry about that,\" said Floyd, \"but no one could think of a better coverstory, and so far it's worked. By the way - I met Moisevitch at the SpaceStation, and even he bought it.\"\"Well, that should make Security happy.\"\"Not too happy - he'd heard of TMA-1; rumors are beginning to leak out. But wejust can't issue any statement, until we know what the damn thing is and whetherour Chinese friends are behind it.\"\"Dr. Michaels thinks he has the answer to that. He's dying to tell you.\"Floyd drained his glass. \"And I'm dying to hear him. Let's go.\"11 - AnomalyThe briefing took place in a large rectangular chamber that could hold a hundredpeople with ease. It was equipped with the latest optical and electronicdisplays and would have looked like a model conference room but for the numerousposters, pinups, notices, and amateur paintings which indicated that it was alsothe center of the local cultural life. Floyd was particularly struck by acollection of signs, obviously assembled with loving care, which carried suchmessages as PLEASE KEEP OFF THE GRASS... NO PARKING ON EVEN DAYS... DEFENSE DEFUMER... TO THE BEACH... CATTLE CROSSING... SOFT SHOULDERS and DO NOT FEED THEANIMALS. If these were genuine - as they certainly appeared to be - theirtransportation from Earth had cost a small fortune. There was a touchingdefiance about them; on this hostile world, men could still joke about thethings they had been forced to leave behind - and which their children wouldnever miss.A crowd of forty or fifty people was waiting for Floyd, and everyone rosepolitely as he entered behind the Administrator. As he nodded at severalfamiliar faces, Floyd whispered to Halvorsen \"I'd like to say a few words beforethe briefing.\"Floyd sat down in the front row, while the Administrator ascended the rostrumand looked round his audience.\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" Halvorsen began, \"I needn't tell you that this is a veryimportant occasion. We are delighted to have Dr. Heywood Floyd with us. We allknow him by reputation, and many of us are acquainted with him personally. Hehas just completed a special flight from Earth to be here, and before thebriefing he has a few words for us. Dr. Floyd,\" Floyd walked to the rostrum amida sprinkling of polite applause, surveyed the audience with a smile, and said:\"Thank you - I only want to say this. The President has asked me to convey hisappreciation of your - outstanding work, which we hope the world will soon beable to recognize. I'm quite aware,\" he continued carefully, \"that some of you -perhaps most of you - are anxious that the present veil of secrecy be withdrawn;you would not be scientists if you thought otherwise.\" He caught a glimpse ofDr. Michaels, whose face was creased in a slight frown which brought out a longscar down his right cheek - presumably the aftermath of some accident in space.The geologist, he was well aware, had been protesting vigorously against what hecalled this \"cops and robbers nonsense.\"\"But I would remind you,\" Floyd continued, \"that this is a quite extraordinarysituation. We must be absolutely sure of our own facts; if we make errors now,there may be no second chance - so please be patient a little longer. Those arealso the wishes of the President.\"That's all I have to say. Now I'm ready for your report.\"He walked back to his seat; the Administrator said, 'Thank you very much, Dr.Floyd,\" and nodded, rather brusquely, to his Chief Scientist. On cue, Dr.Michaels walked up to the rostrum, and-the lights faded out.A photograph of the Moon flashed onto the screen. At the very center of the diskwas a brilliant white crater ring, from which a striking pattern of rays fannedout. It looked exactly as if someone had hurled a bag of flour at the face ofthe Moon, and it had spattered out in all directions.\"This is Tycho,\" said Michaels, pointing to the central crater. \"On thisvertical photograph Tycho is even more conspicuous than when seen from Earth;then it's rather near the edge of the Moon. But observed from this viewpoint -looking straight down from a thousand miles up - you'll see how it dominates anentire hemisphere.\"He let Floyd absorb this unfamiliar view of a familiar object, then continued:\"During the past year we have been conducting a magnetic survey of the region,from a low-level satellite. It was completed only last month, and this is theresult... the map that started all the trouble.\"Another picture flashed on the screen; it looked like a contour map, though itshowed magnetic intensity, not heights above sea level. For the most part, thelines were roughly parallel and spaced well apart; but in one corner of the mapthey became suddenly packed together, to form a series of concentric circles- like a drawing of a knothole in a piece of wood.Even to an untrained eye, it was obvious that something peculiar had happened tothe Moon's magnetic field in this region; and in large letters across the bottomof the map were the words: TYCHO MAGNETIC ANOMALY-ONE (TMA-l). Stamped on thetop right was CLASSIFIED.\"At first we thought it might be an outcrop of magnetic rock, but all thegeological evidence was against it. And not even a big nickel-iron meteoritecould produce a field as intense as this; so we decided to have a look.\"The first party discovered nothing - just the usual level terrain, buriedbeneath a very thin layer of moon-dust. They sank a drill in the exact center ofthe magnetic field to get a core sample for study. Twenty feet down, the drillstopped. So the survey party started to dig - not an easy job in spacesuits, asI can assure you.\"What they found brought them back to Base in a hurry. We sent out a biggerteam, with better equipment. They excavated for two weeks - with the result youknow.\"The darkened assembly room became suddenly hushed and expectant as the pictureon the screen changed. Though everyone had seen it many times, there was not aperson who failed to crane forward as if hoping to find new details. On Earthand Moon, less than a hundred people had so far been allowed to set eyes on thisphotograph.It showed a man in a bright red and yellow spacesuit standing at the bottom ofan excavation and supporting a surveyor's rod marked off in tenths of a meter.It was obviously a night shot, and might have been taken anywhere on the Moon orMars. But until now no planet had ever produced a scene like this.The object before which the spacesuited man was posing was a vertical slab ofjet-black material, about ten feet high and five feet wide: it reminded Floyd,somewhat ominously, of a giant tombstone. Perfectly sharp-edged and symmetrical,it was so black it seemed to have swallowed up the light falling upon it; therewas no surface detail at all. It was impossible to tell whether it was made ofstone or metal or plastic - or some material altogether unknown to man.\"TMA-1,\" Dr. Michaels declared, almost reverently. \"It looks brand new, doesn'tit? I can hardly blame those who thought it was just a few years old, and triedto connect it with the third Chinese Expedition, back in '98. But I neverbelieved that - and now we've been able to date it positively, from localgeological evidence.\"My colleagues and I, Dr. Floyd, will stake our reputations on this. TMA-l hasnothing to do with the Chinese. Indeed, it has nothing to do with the human race- for when it was buried, there were no humans.\"You see, it is approximately three million years old. What you are now lookingat is the first evidence of intelligent life beyond the Earth.\"12 - Journey by EarthlightMACRO-CRATER PROVINCE: Extends S from near center of visible face of moon, Eof Central Crater Province. Densely pocked with impact craters; many large, andincluding the largest on moon; in N some craters fractured from impact formingMare Imbrium. Rough surfaces almost everywhere, except for some crater bottoms.Most surfaces in slopes, mostly 10° to 12°; some crater bottoms nearly level.LANDING AND MOVEMENT: landing generally difficult because of rough, slopingsurfaces; less difficult in some level crater bottoms. Movement possible almosteverywhere but route selection required; less difficult on some level craterbottoms.CONSTRUCTION: Generally moderately difficult because of slope, and numerouslarge blocks in loose material; excavation of lava difficult in some craterbottoms.TYCHO: Post-Maria crater, 54 miles diameter, rim 7,900 feet above surroundings;bottom 12,000 feet deep; has the most prominent ray system on the moon, somerays extending more than 500 miles.(Extract from \"Engineer Special Study of the Surface of the Moon,\" Office, Chiefof Engineers, Department of the Army. U.S. Geological Survey, Washington, 1961.)The mobile lab now rolling across the crater plain at fifty miles an hour lookedrather like an outsized trailer mounted on eight flex-wheels. But it was verymuch more than this; it was a self-contained base in which twenty men could liveand work for several weeks. Indeed, it was virtually a landgoing spaceship- and in an emergency it could even fly. If it came to a crevasse or canyonwhich was too large to detour, and too steep to enter, it could hop across theobstacle on its four underjets.As he peered out of the window, Floyd could see stretching ahead of him awell-defined trail, where dozens of vehicles had left a hard-packed band in thefriable surface of the Moon. At regular intervals along the track were tall,slender rods, each carrying a flashing light. No one could possibly get lost onthe 200-mile journey from Clavius Base to TMA-1, even though it was still nightand the sun would not rise for several hours.The stars overhead were only a little brighter, or more numerous, than on aclear night from the high plateaus of New Mexico or Colorado. But there were twothings in that coal-black sky that destroyed any illusion of Earth.The first was Earth itself - a blazing beacon hanging above the northernhorizon. The light pouring down from that giant half-globe was dozens of timesmore brilliant than the full moon, and it covered all this land with a cold,blue-green phosphorescence.The second celestial apparition was a faintt, pearly cone of light slanting upthe eastern sky. It became brighter and brighter toward the horizon, hinting ofgreat fires just concealed below the edge of the Moon.Here was a pale glory that no man had ever seen from Earth, save during the fewmoments of a total eclipse. It was the corona, harbinger of the lunar dawn,giving notice that before long the sun would smite this sleeping land.As he sat with Halvorsen and Michaels in the forward observation lounge,immediately beneath the driver's position, Floyd found his thoughts turningagain and again to the three-million-year-wide gulf that had just opened upbefore him. Like all scientifically literate men, he was used to considering farlonger periods of time - but they had concerned only the movements of stars andthe slow cycles of the inanimate universe. Mind or intelligence had not beeninvolved; those eons were empty of all that touched the emotions.Three million years! The infinitely crowded panorama of written history, withits empires and its kings, its triumphs and its tragedies, covered barely onethousandth of this appalling span of time. Not only Man himself, but most of theanimals now alive on Earth, did not even exist when this black enigma was socarefully buried here, in the most brilliant and most spectacular of all thecraters of the Moon.That it had been buried, and quite deliberately, Dr. Michaels was absolutelysure. \"At first,\" he explained, \"I rather hoped it might mark the site of someunderground structure, but our latest excavations have eliminated that. It'ssitting on a wide platform of the sameblack material, with undisturbed rock beneath it. The - creatures - who designedit wanted to make sure it stayed put, barring major moonquakes. They werebuilding for eternity.\"There was triumph, and yet sadness, in Michaels' voice, and Floyd could shareboth emotions. At last, one of man's oldest questions had been answered; herewas the proof, beyond all shadow of doubt, that his was not the onlyintelligence that the universe had brought forth. But with that knowledge therecame again an aching awareness of the immensity of Time. Whatever had passedthis way had missed mankind by a hundred thousand generations. Perhaps, Floydtold himself, it was just as well. And yet - what we might have learned fromcreatures who could cross space, while our ancestors were still living in trees!A few hundred yards ahead, a signpost was coming up over the Moon's strangelyclose horizon. At its base was a tent-shaped structure covered with shiningsilver foil, obviously for protection against the fierce heat of day. As the busrolled by, Floyd was able to read in the brilliant earthlight:EMERGENCY DEPOT No. 320 Kilos Lox10 Kilos Water20 Foodpaks Mk 41 Toolkit Type B1 Suit Repair Outfit"},{"pageContent":"! TELEPHONE !\"Have you thought of that?\" asked Floyd, pointing out of the window.\"Suppose the thing's a supply cache, left behind by an expedition that neverreturned?\"\"It's a possibility,\" admitted Michaels. \"That magnetic field certainly labeledits position, so that it could be easily found. But it's rather small - itcouldn't hold much in the way of supplies.\"\"Why not?\" interjected Halvorsen. \"Who knows bow big they were? Perhaps theywere only six inches tall, which would make the thing twenty or thirty storieshigh.\"Michaels shook his head. \"Out of the question,\" he protested. \"You can't havevery small, intelligent creatures; you need a minimum brain size.\"Michaels and Halvorsen, Floyd had noticed, usually took opposing viewpoints, yetthere appeared to be little personal hostility or friction between them. Theyseemed to respect each other, and simply agreed to disagree.There was certainly little agreement anywhere about the nature of TMA-1 - or theTycho Monolith, as some preferred to call it, retaining part of theabbreviation.In the six hours since he had landed on the Moon, Floyd had heard a dozentheories, but had committed himself to none. Shrine, survey marker, tomb,geophysical instrument - these were perhaps the favorite suggestions, and someof the protagonists grew very heated in their defense. A good many betshadalready been placed, and a lot of money would change hands when the truth wasfinally known - if, indeed, it ever was. So far, the hard black material of theslab had resisted all the rather mild attempts that Michaels and his colleagueshad made to obtain samples. They had no doubt that a laser beam would cut intoit - for, surely, nothing could resist that frightful concentration of energy -but the decision to employ such violent measures would be left to Floyd. He hadalready decided that X rays, sonic probes, neutron beams, and all othernondestructive means of investigation would be brought into play before hecalled up the heavy artillery of the laser. It was the mark of a barbarian todestroy something one could not understand; but perhaps men were barbarians,beside the creatures who had made this thing.And where could they have come from? The Moon itself? No, that was utterlyimpossible. If there had ever been indigenous life on this barren world, it hadbeen destroyed during the last crater-forming epoch, when most of the lunarsurface was white-hot.Earth? Very unlikely, though perhaps not quite impossible. Any advancedterrestrial civilization - presumably a nonhuman one - back in the PleistoceneEra would have left many other traces of its existence. We would have known allabout it, thought Floyd, long before we got to the Moon.That left two alternatives - the planets, and the stars.Yet all the evidence was against intelligent life elsewhere in the Solar System- or indeed life of any kind except on Earth and Mars. The inner planets weretoo hot, the outer ones far too cold, unless one descended into their atmosphereto depths where the pressures amounted to hundreds of tons to the square inch.So perhaps these visitors had come from the stars - yet that was even moreincredible. As he looked up at the constellations strewn across the ebon lunarsky, Floyd remembered how often his fellow scientists had \"proved\" thatinterstellar travel was impossible. The journey from Earth to Moon was stillfairly impressive, but the very nearest star was a hundred million times moredistant... Speculation was a waste of time; he must wait until there was moreevidence,\"Please fasten your seat belts and secure all loose objects,\" said the cabinspeaker suddenly. \"Forty degree slope approaching.\"Two marker posts with winking lights had appeared on the horizon, and the buswas steering between them.Floyd had barely adjusted his straps when the vehicle slowly edged itself overthe brink of a really terrifying incline, and began to descend a long,rubble-covered slope as steep as the roof of a house. The slanting earth-light,coming from behind them, now gave very little illumination, and the bus's ownfloodlights had been switched on. Many years ago Floyd had stood on the lip ofVesuvius, staring into the crater; he could easily imagine that he was nowdriving down into it and the sensation was not a very pleasant one.They were descending one of the inner terraces of Tycho, and it leveled outagain some thousand feet below. As they crawled down the slope, Michaels pointedout across the great expanse of plain now spread out beneath them.\"There they are,\" he exclaimed. Floyd nodded; he had already noticed the clusterof red and green lights several miles ahead, and kept his eyes fixed upon it asthe bus edged its way delicately down the slope. The big vehicle was obviouslyunder perfect control, but he did not breathe easily until it was once more onan even keel.Now he could see, glistening like silver bubbles in the earthlight, a group ofpressure domes - the temporary shelters housing the workers on the site. Nearthese was a radio tower, a drilling rig, a group of parked vehicles, and a largepile of broken rock, presumably the material that had been excavated to revealthe monolith. This tiny camp in the wilderness looked very lonely, veryvulnerable to the forces of nature ranged silently around it. There was no signof life, and no visible hint as to why men had come here, so far from home.\"You can just see the crater,\" said Michaels. \"Over there on the right - about ahundred yards from that radio antenna.\"So this is it, thought Floyd, as the bus rolled past the pressure domes, andcame to the lip of the crater.His pulse quickened as he craned forward for a better view. The vehicle began tocreep cautiously down a ramp of hard-packed rock, into the interior of thecrater. And there, exactly as he had seen it in the photographs, was TMA-1.Floyd stared, blinked, shook his head, and stared again. Even in the brilliantearthlight, it was hard to see the object clearly; his first impression was of aflat rectangle that might have been cut out of carbon paper; it seemed to haveno thickness at all. Of course, this was an optical illusion; though he waslooking at a solid body, it reflected so little light that he could see it onlyin silhouette.The passengers were utterly silent as the bus descended into the crater. Therewas awe, and there was also incredulity - sheer disbelief that the dead Moon, ofall worlds, could have sprung this fantastic surprise.The bus came to a halt within twenty feet of the slab and broadside on so thatall the passengers could examine it. Yet, beyond the geometrically perfect shapeof the thing, there was little to see. Nowhere were there any marks, or anyabatement of its ultimate, ebon blackness. It was the very crystallization ofnight, and for one moment Floyd wondered if it could indeed be someextraordinary natural formation, born of the fires and pressures attending thecreation of the Moon. But that remote possibility, he knew, had already beenexamined and dismissed.At some signal, floodlights around the lip of the crater were switched on, andthe bright earthlight was obliterated by a far more brilliant glare. In thelunar vacuum the beams were, of course, completely invisible; they formedoverlapping ellipses of blinding white, centered on the monolith. And where theytouched it, its ebon surface seemed to swallow them.Pandora's box, thought Floyd, with a sudden sense of foreboding - waiting to beopened by inquisitive Man.And what will he find inside?13 - The Slow DawnThe main pressure dome at the TMA-1 site was only twenty feet across, and itsinterior was uncomfortably crowded. The bus, coupled to it through one of thetwo airlocks, gave some much-appreciated extra living room.Inside this hemispherical, double-walled balloon lived, worked, and slept thesix scientists and technicians now permanently attached to the project. It alsocontained most of their equipment and instruments, all the stores that could notbe left in the vacuum outside, cooking, washing, and toilet facilities,geological samples and a small TV screen through which the site could be keptunder continuous surveillance.Floyd was not surprised when Halvorsen elected to remain in the dome; he statedhis views with admirable frankness.\"I regard spacesuits as a necessary evil,\" said the Administrator, \"I wear onefour times a year, for my quarterly checkout tests. If you don't mind, I'll sithere and watch over the TV.\"Some of this prejudice was now unjustified, for the latest models wereinfinitely more comfortable than the clumsy suits of armor worn by the firstlunar explorers. They could be put on in less than a minute, even without help,and were quite automatic. The Mk V into which Floyd was now carefully sealedwould protect him from the worst that the Moon could do, either by day or bynight.Accompanied by Dr. Michaels, he walked into the small airlock. As the throbbingof the pumps died away, and his suit stiffened almost imperceptibly around him,he felt himself enclosed in the silence of vacuum.That silence was broken by the welcome sound of his suit radio.\"Pressure O.K., Dr. Floyd? Are you breathing normally?\"\"Yes - I'm fine.\"His companion carefully checked the dials and gauges on the outside of Floyd'ssuit. Then he said:\"O.K.-let's go.\"The outer door opened, and the dusty moonscape lay before them, glimmering inthe earthlight.With a cautious, waddling movement, Floyd followed Michaels through the lock. Itwas not hard to walk; indeed, in a paradoxical way the suit made him feel moreat home than at any time since reaching the Moon. Its extra weight, and theslight resistance it imposed on his motion, gave some of the illusion of thelost terrestrial gravity.The scene had changed since the party had arrived barely an hour ago. Though thestars, and the half-earth, were still as bright as ever, the fourteen-day lunarnight had almost ended. The glow of the corona was like a false moonrise alongthe eastern sky - and then, without warning, the tip of the radio mast a hundredfeet above Floyd's head suddenly seemed to burst into flame, as it caught thefirst rays of the hidden sun.They waited while the project supervisor and two of his assistants emerged fromthe airlock, then walked slowly toward the crater. By the time they had reachedit, a thin bow of unbearable incandescence had thrust itself above the easternhorizon. Though it would take more than an hour for the sun to clear the edge ofthe slowly turning moon, the stars were already banished. The crater was stillin shadow, but the floodlights mounted around its rim lit the interiorbrilliantly. As Floyd walked slowly down the ramp toward the black rectangle, hefelt a sense not only of awe but of helplessness. Here, at the very portals ofEarth, man was already face to face with a mystery that might never be solved.Three million years ago, something had passed this way, had left this unknownand perhaps unknowable symbol of its-purpose, and had returned to the planets -or to the stars.Floyd's suit radio interrupted his reverie. \"Project supervisor speaking. Ifyou'd all line up on this side, we'd like to take a few photos. Dr. Floyd, willyou stand in the middle - Dr. Michaels - thank you. No one except Floyd seemedto think that there was anything funny about this. In all honesty, he had toadmit that he was glad someone had brought a camera; here was a photo that wouldundoubtedly be historic, and he wanted copies for himself. He hoped that hisface would be clearly visible through the helmet of the suit.\"Thanks, gentlemen,\" said the photographer, after they had posed somewhatself-consciously in front of the monolith, and he had made a dozen exposures.\"We'll ask the Base Photo Section to send you copies.\" Then Floyd turned hisfull attention to the ebon slab - walking slowly around it, examining it fromevery angle, trying to imprint its strangeness upon his mind.He did not expect to find anything, for he knew that every square inch hadalready been gone over with microscopic care.Now the sluggish sun had lifted itself above the edge of the crater, and itsrays were pouring almost broadside upon the eastern face of the block. Yet itseemed to absorb every particle of light as if it had never been.Floyd decided to try a simple experiment; he stood between the monolith and thesun, and looked for his own shadow on the smooth black sheet. There was no traceof it. At least ten kilowatts of raw heat must be falling on the slab; if therewas anything inside, it must be rapidly cooking.How strange, Floyd thought, to stand here while - this thing - is seeingdaylight for the first time since the Ice Ages began on Earth. He wondered againabout its black color; that was ideal, of course, for absorbing solar energy.But he dismissed the thought at once; for who would be crazy enough to bury asunpowered device twenty feet underground?He looked up at the Earth, beginning to wane in the morning sky. Only a handfulof the six billion people there knew of this discovery; how would the worldreact to the news when it was finally released? The political and socialimplications were immense; every person of real intelligence - everyone wholooked an inch beyond his nose - would find his life, his values, hisphilosophy, subtly changed. Even if nothing whatsoever was discovered aboutTMA1, and it remained an eternal mystery, Man would know that he was not uniquein the universe. Though he had missed them by millions of years, those who hadonce stood here might yet return: and if not, there might well be others. Allfutures must now contain this possibility.Floyd was still musing over these thoughts when his helmet speaker suddenlyemitted a piercing electronic shriek, like a hideously overloaded and distortedtime signal. Involuntarily, he tried to block his ears with his spacesuitedhands; then he recovered and groped frantically for the gain control of hisreceiver. While he was still fumbling four more of the shrieks blasted out ofthe ether; then there was a merciful silence.All around the crater, figures were standing in attitudes of paralyzedastonishment. So it's nothing wrong with my gear, Floyd told himself; everyoneheard those piercing electronic screams.After three million years of darkness, TMA-1 had greeted the lunar dawn.14 - The ListenersA hundred million miles beyond Mars, in the cold loneliness where no man had yettraveled, Deep Space Monitor 79 drifted slowly among the tangled orbits of theasteroids. For three years it had fulfilled its mission flawlessly - a tributeto the American scientists who had designed it, the British engineers who hadbuilt it, the Russian technicians who had launched it. A delicate spider's-webof antennas sampled the passing waves of radio noise - the ceaseless crackle andhiss of what Pascal, in a far simpler age, had naively called the \"silence ofinfinite space.\" Radiation detectors noted and analyzed incoming cosmic raysfrom the galaxy and points beyond; neutron and X-ray telescopes kept watch onstrange stars that no human eye would ever see; magnetometers observed the gustsand hurricanes of the solar winds, as the Sun breathed million-mile-an-hourblasts of tenuous plasma into the faces of its circling children. All thesethings, and many others, were patiently noted by Deep Space Monitor 79, andrecorded in its crystalline memory.One of its antennas, by now unconsidered miracles of electronics, was alwaysaimed at a point never far from the Sun. Every few months its distant targetcould have been seen, had there been any eye here to watch, as a bright starwith a close, fainter companion; but most of the time it was lost in the solarglaze.To that far-off planet Earth, every twenty-four hours, the monitor would sendthe information it had patiently garnered, packed neatly into one fiveminutepulse. About a quarter of an hour late, traveling at the speed of light, thatpulse would reach its destination. The machines whose duty it was would bewaiting for it; they would amplify and record the signal, and add it to thethousands of miles of magnetic tape now stored in the vaults of the World SpaceCenters at Washington, Moscow, and Canberra.Since the first satellites had orbited, almost fifty years earlier, trillionsand quadrillions of pulses of information had been pouring down from space, tobe stored against the day when they might contribute to the advance ofknowledge. Only a minute fraction of all this raw material would ever beprocessed; but there was no way of telling what observation some scientist mightwish to consult, ten, or fifty, or a hundred years from now. So everything hadto be kept on file, stacked in endless air-conditioned galleries, triplicated atthe three centers against the possibility of accidental loss. It was part of thereal treasure of mankind, more valuable than all the gold locked uselessly awayin bank vaults.And now Deep Space Monitor 19 had noted something strange - a faint yetunmistakable disturbance rippling across the Solar System, and quite unlike anynatural phenomenon it had ever observed in the past. Automatically, it recordedthe direction, the time, the intensity; in a few hours it would pass theinformation to Earth.As, also, would Orbiter M 15, circling Mars twice a day; and High InclinationProbe 21, climbing slowly above the plane of the ecliptic; and even ArtificialComet 5, heading out into the cold wastes beyond Pluto, along an orbit whose farpoint it would not reach for a thousand years. All noted the peculiar burst ofenergy that had disturbed their instruments; all, in due course, reported backautomatically to the memory stores on distant Earth.The computers might never have perceived the connection between four peculiarsets of signals from space-probes on independent orbits millions of miles apart.But as soon as he glanced at his morning report, the Radiation Forecaster atGoddard knew that something strange had passed through the Solar System duringthe last twenty-four hours.He had only part of its track, but when the computer projected it on the PlanetSituation Board, it was as clear and unmistakable as a vapor trail across acloudless sky, or a single line of footprints over a field of virgin snow.Some immaterial pattern of energy, throwing off a spray of radiation like thewake of a racing speedboat, had leaped from the face of the Moon, and washeading out toward the stars.III - BETWEEN PLANETS15 - DiscoveryThe ship was still only thirty days from Earth, yet David Bowman sometimes foundit hard to believe that be had ever known any other existence than the closedlittle world of Discovery. All his years of training, all his earlier missionsto the Moon and Mars, seemed to belong to another man, in another life.Frank Poole admitted to the same feelings, and had sometimes jokingly regrettedthat the nearest psychiatrist was the better part of a hundred million milesaway. But this sense of isolation and estrangement was easy enough tounderstand, and certainly indicated no abnormality. In the fifty years since menhad ventured into space, there had never been a mission quite like this.It had begun, five years ago, as Project Jupiter - the first manned round tripto the greatest of the planets. The ship was nearly ready for the two-yearvoyage when, somewhat abruptly, the mission profile had been changed.Discovery would still go to Jupiter; but she would not stop there. She would noteven slacken speed as she raced through the far-ranging Jovian satellite system.On the contrary - she would use the gravitational field of the giant world us asling to cast her even farther from the Sun. Like a comet, she would streak onacross the outer reaches of the solar system to her ultimate goal, the ringedglory of Saturn. And she would never return.For Discovery, it would be a one-way trip - yet her crew had no intention ofcommitting suicide. If all went well, they would be back on Earth within sevenyears - five of which would pass like a flash in the dreamless sleep ofhibernation, while they awaited rescue by the still unbuilt Discovery II.The word \"rescue\" was carefully avoided in all the Astronautics Agency'sstatements and documents; it implied some failure of planning, and the approvedjargon was \"re-acquisition.\" If anything went really wrong, there wouldcertainly be no hope of rescue, almost a billion miles from Earth.It was a calculated risk, like all voyages into the unknown. But half a centuryof research had proved that artificially induced human hibernation was perfectlysafe, and it had opened up new possibilities in space travel. Not until thismission, however, had they been exploited to the utmost.The three members of the survey team, who would not be needed until the shipentered her final orbit around Saturn, would sleep through the entire outwardflight. Tons of food and other expendables would thus be saved; almost asimportant, the team would be fresh and alert, and not fatigued by the ten-monthvoyage, when they went into action.Discovery would enter a parking orbit around Saturn, becoming a new moon of thegiant planet. She would swing back and forth along a two-million-mile ellipsethat took her close to Saturn, and then across the orbits of all its majormoons. They would have a hundred days in which to map and study a world witheighty times the area of Earth, and surrounded by a retinue of at least fifteenknown satellites - one of them as large as the planet Mercury.There must be wonders enough here for centuries of study; the first expeditioncould only carry out a preliminary reconnaissance. All that it found would beradioed back to Earth; even if the explorers never returned, their discoverieswould not be lost.At the end of the hundred days, Discovery would close down. All the crew wouldgo into hibernation; only the essential systems would continue to operate,watched over by the ship's tireless electronic brain. She would continue toswing around Saturn, on an orbit now so well determined that men would knowexactly where to look for her a thousand years hence. But in only five years,according to present plans, Discovery II would come. Even if six or seven oreight years elapsed, her sleeping passengers would never know the difference.For all of them, the clock would have stopped as it had stopped already forWhitehead, Kaminski, and Hunter.Sometimes Bowman, as First Captain of Discovery, envied his three unconsciouscolleagues in the frozen peace of the Hibernaculum. They were free from allboredom and all responsibility; until they reached Saturn, the external worlddid not exist.But that world was watching them, through their bio-sensor displays. Tuckedinconspicuously away among the massed instrumentation of the Control Deck werefive small panels marked Hunter, Whitehead, Kaminski, Poole, Bowman. The lasttwo were blank and lifeless; their time would not come until a year from now.The others bore constellations of tiny green lights, announcing that everythingwas well; and on each was a small display screen across which sets of glowinglines traced the leisurely rhythms that indicated pulse, respiration, and brainactivity.There were times when Bowman, well aware how unnecessary this was - for thealarm would sound instantly if anything was wrong - would switch over to audiooutput. He would listen, half hypnotized, to the infinitely slow heartbeats ofhis sleeping colleagues, keeping his eyes fixed on the sluggish waves thatmarched in synchronism across the screen.Most fascinating of all were the EEG displays - the electronic signatures ofthree personalities that had once existed, and would one day exist again. Theywere almost free from the spikes and valleys, the electrical explosions thatmarked the activity of the waking brain - or even of the brain in normal sleep.If there was any wisp of consciousness remaining, it was beyond the reach ofinstruments, and of memory.This last fact Bowman knew from personal experience. Before he was chosen forthis mission, his reactions to hibernation had been tested. He was not surewhether he had lost a week of his life - or whether he had postponed hiseventual death by the same amount of time.When the electrodes had been attached to his forehead, and the sleepgeneratorhad started to pulse, he had seen a brief display of kaleidoscopic patterns anddrifting stars. Then they had faded, and darkness had engulfed him. He had neverfelt the injections, still less the first touch of cold as his body temperaturewas reduced to only a few degrees above freezing.He awoke, and it seemed that he had scarcely closed his eyes. But he knew thatwas an illusion; somehow, he was convinced that years had really passed.Had the mission been completed? Had they already reached Saturn, carried outtheir survey, and gone into hibernation? Was Discovery II here, to take themback to Earth?He lay in a dreamlike haze, utterly unable to distinguish between real and falsememories. He opened his eyes, but there was little to see except a blurredconstellation of lights which puzzled him for some minutes.Then he realized that he was looking at the indicator lamps on a Ship SituationBoard, but it was impossible to focus on them. He soon gave up the attempt.Warm air was blowing across him, removing the chill from his limbs. There wasquiet, but stimulating, music welling from a speaker behind his head. It wasslowly growing louder and louder.Then a relaxed, friendly - but he knew computer generated - voice spoke to him.\"You are becoming operational, Dave. Do not get up or attempt any violentmovements. Do not try to speak.\"Do not get up! thought Bowman. That was funny. He doubted if he could wriggle afinger. Rather to his surprise, he found that he could.He felt quite contented, in a dazed, stupid kind of way. He knew dimly that therescue ship must have come, that the automatic revival sequence had beentriggered, and that soon he would be seeing other human beings. That was fine,but he did not get excited about it.Presently he felt hunger. The computer, of course, had anticipated this need.\"There is a signal button by your right hand, Dave.If you are hungry, please press it.\"Bowman forced his fingers to hunt around, and presently discovered thepearshaped bulb. He had forgotten all about it, though he must have known it wasthere. How much else had he forgotten: Did hibernation erase memory?He pressed the button, and waited. Several minutes later, a metal arm moved outfrom the bunk, and a plastic nipple descended toward his lips. He sucked on iteagerly, and a warm, sweet fluid coursed down his throat, brining renewedstrength with every drop.Presently it went away, and he rested once more. He could move his arms and legsnow; the thought of walking was no longer an impossible dream.Though he felt his strength swiftly returning, he would have been content to liehere forever, if there had been no further stimulus from outside. But presentlyanother voice spoke to him - and this time it was wholly human, not a constructof electrical pulses assembled by a more-than-human memory. It was also afamiliar voice, though it was some time before he could recognize it\"Hello, Dave. You're coming round fine. You can talk now. Do you know where youare?\"He worried about this for some time. If he was really orbiting Saturn, what hadhappened during all the months since he had left Earth? Again he began to wonderif he was suffering from amnesia, Paradoxically, that very thought reassuredhim, if he could remember the word \"amnesia\" his brain must be in fairly goodshape.But he still did not know where he was, and the speaker at the other end of thecircuit must have understood his situation completely.\"Don't worry, Dave. This is Frank Poole. I'm watching your heart andrespiration-everything is perfectly normal. Just relax - take it easy. We'regoing to open the door now and pull you out.\"Soft light flooded into the chamber; he saw moving shapes silhouetted againstthe widening entrance. And in that moment, all his memories came back to him,and be knew exactly where he was.Though he had come back safely from the furthest borders of sleep, and thenearest borders of death, he had been gone only a week. When he left theHibernaculum, he would not see the cold Saturnian sky; that was more than a yearin the future and a billion miles away.He was still in the trainer at the Houston Space Flight Center under the hotTexas sun.16 - HalBut now Texas was invisible, and even the United States was hard to see. Thoughthe low-thrust plasma drive had long since been closed down, Discovery was stillcoasting with her slender arrowlike body pointed away from Earth, and all herhigh-powered optical gear was oriented toward the outer planets, where herdestiny lay.There was one telescope, however, that was permanently aimed at Earth. It wasmounted like a gunsight on the rim of the ship's long-range antenna, and checkedthat the great parabolic bowl was rigidly locked upon its distant target. WhileEarth remained centered in the crosswires, the vital communication link wasintact, and messages could come and go along the invisible beam that lengthenedmore than two million miles with every day that passed.At least once in every watch period Bowman would lock homeward through theantenna-alignment telescope. As Earth was now far back toward the sun, itsdarkened hemisphere faced Discovery, and on the central display screen theplanet appeared as a dazzling silver crescent, like another Venus.It was rare that any geographical features could be identified in thatevershrinking arc of light, for cloud and haze concealed them, but even thedarkened portion of the disk was endlessly fascinating. It was sprinkled withshining cities; sometimes they burned with a steady light, sometimes theytwinkled like fireflies as atmospheric tremors passed over them.There were also periods when, as the Moon swung back and forth in its orbit, itshone down like a great lamp upon the darkened seas and continents of Earth.Then, with a thrill of recognition, Bowman could often glimpse familiarcoastlines, shining in that spectral lunar light. And sometimes, when thePacific was calm, he could even see the moonglow shimmering across its face; andhe would remember nights beneath the palm trees of tropical lagoons.Yet he had no regrets for these lost beauties. He had enjoyed them all, in histhirty-five years of life; and he was determined to enjoy them again, when hereturned rich and famous. Meanwhile, distance made them all the more precious.The sixth member of the crew cared for none of these things, for it was nothuman. It was the highly advanced HAL 9000 computer, the brain and nervoussystem of the ship.Hal (for Heuristically programmed ALgorithmic computer, no less) was amasterwork of the third computer breakthrough. These seemed to occur atintervals of twenty years, and the thought that another one was now imminentalready worried a great many people.The first had been in the 1940s, when the long-obsolete vacuum tube had madepossible such clumsy, high-speed morons as ENIAC and its successors. Then, inthe 1960s, solid-state microelectronics had been perfected. With its advent, itwas clear that artificial intelligences at least as powerful as Man's need be nolarger than office desks - if one only knew how to construct them.Probably no one would ever know this; it did not matter. In the 1980s, Minskyand Good had shown how neural networks could be generated automatically - selfreplicated - in accordance with any arbitrary learning program. Artificialbrains could be grown by a process strikingly analogous to the development of ahuman brain. In any given case, the precise details would never be known, andeven if they were, they would be millions of times too complex for humanunderstanding. Whatever way it worked, the final result was a machineintelligence that could reproduce - some philosophers still preferred to use theword \"mimic\" - most of the activities of the human brain - and with far greaterspeed and reliability. It was extremely expensive, and only a few units of theHAL9000 series had yet been built; but the old jest that it would always beeasier to make organic brains by unskilled labor was beginning to sound a littlehollow.Hal had been trained for this mission as thoroughly as his human colleagues- and at many times their rate of input, for in addition to his intrinsic speed,he never slept. His prime task was to monitor the life-support systems,continually checking oxygen pressure, temperature, hull leakage, radiation, andall the other interlocking factors upon which the lives of the fragile humancargo depended. He could carry out the intricate navigational corrections, andexecute the necessary flight maneuvers when it was time to change course. And hecould watch over the hibernators, making any necessary adjustments to theirenvironment and doling out the minute quantities of intravenous fluids that keptthem alive.The first generations of computers had received their inputs through glorifiedtypewriter keyboards, and had replied through high-speed printers and visualdisplays. Hal could do this when necessary, but most of his communication withhis shipmates was by means of the spoken word. Poole and Bowman could talk toHal as if he were a human being and he would reply in the perfect idiomaticEnglish he had learned during the fleeting weeks of his electronic childhood.Whether Hal could actually think was a question which had been settled by theBritish mathematician Alan Turing back in the 1940s. Turing had pointed outthat, if one could carry out a prolonged conversation with a machine - whetherby typewriter or microphone was immaterial - without being able to distinguishbetween its replies and those that a man might give, then the machine wasthinking, by any sensible definition of the word. Hal could pass the Turing testwith ease.The time might even come when Hal would take command of the ship. In anemergency, if no one answered his signals, he would attempt to wake the sleepingmembers of the crew, by electrical and chemical stimulation. If they did notrespond, he would radio Earth for further orders.And then, if there was no reply from Earth, he would take what measures hedeemed necessary to safeguard the ship and to continue the mission - whose realpurpose he alone knew, and which his human colleagues could never have guessed.Poole and Bowman had often humorously referred to themselves as caretakers orjanitors aboard a ship that could really run itself. They would have beenastonished, and more than a little indignant, to discover how much truth thatjest contained.17 - Cruise ModeThe day-by-day running of the ship had been planned with great care, and -theoretically at least - Bowman and Poole knew what they would be doing at everymoment of the twenty-four hours. They operated on a twelve-hours-on,twelvehours-off basis, taking charge alternately, and never being both asleep atthe same time. The officer on duty remained on the Control Deck, while hisdeputy saw to the general housekeeping, inspected the ship, coped with the oddjobs that constantly arose, or relaxed in his cubicle.Although Bowman was nominal Captain on this phase of the mission, no outsideobserver could have deduced the fact. He and Poole switched roles, rank, andresponsibilities completely every twelve hours. This kept them both at peaktraining, minimized the chances of friction, and helped toward the goal of 100percent redundancy.Bowman's day began at 0600, ship's time - the Universal Ephemeris Time of theastronomers. If he was late, Hal had a variety of beeps and chimes to remind himof his duty, but they had never been used. As a test, Poole had once switchedoff the alarm; Bowman had still risen automatically at the right time.His first official act of the day would be to advance the Master HibernationTimer twelve hours. If this operation was missed twice in a row, Hal wouldassume that both he and Poole had been incapacitated, and would take thenecessary emergency action.Bowman would attend to his toilet, and do his isometric exercises, beforesettling down to breakfast and the morning's radio-fax edition of the WorldTimes. On Earth, he never read the paper as carefully as he did now; even thesmallest items of society gossip, the most fleeting political rumors, seemed ofabsorbing interest as it flashed across the screen.At 0700 he would officially relieve Poole on the Control Deck, bringing him asqueeze-tube of coffee from the kitchen. If - as was usually the case - therewas nothing to report and no action to be taken, he would settle down to checkall the instrument readings, and would run through a series of tests designed tospot possible malfunctions. By 1000 this would be finished, and he would starton a study period.Bowman had been a student for more than half his life; he would continue to beone until he retired. Thanks to the twentieth-century revolution in training andinformation-handling techniques, he already possessed the equivalent of two orthree college educations - and, what was more, he could remember 90 percent ofwhat he had learned.Fifty years ago, he would have been considered a specialist in appliedastronomy, cybernetics, and space propulsion systems - yet he was prone to deny,with genuine indignation, that he was a specialist at all. Bowman had neverfound it possible to focus his interest exclusively on any subject; despite thedark warnings of his instructors, he had insisted on taking his Master's degreein General Astronautics - a course with a vague and woolly syllabus, designedfor those whose IQs were in the low 130s and who would never reach the top ranksof their profession.His decision had been right; that very refusal to specialize had made himuniquely qualified for his present task. In much the same way Frank Poole - whosometimes disparagingly called himself \"General Practitioner in space biology\" -had been an ideal choice as his deputy. The two of them, with, if necessary,help from Hal's vast stores of information, could cope with any problems likelyto arise during the voyage - as long as they kept their minds alert andreceptive, and continually reengraved old patterns of memory.So for two hours, from 1000 to 1200, Bowman would engage in a dialogue with anelectronic tutor, checking his general knowledge or absorbing material specificto this mission. He would prowl endlessly over ship's plans, circuit diagrams,and voyage profiles, or would try to assimilate all that was known aboutJupiter, Saturn, and their far-ranging families of moons.At midday, he would retire to the galley and leave the ship to Hal while heprepared his lunch. Even here, he was still fully in touch with events, for thetiny lounge-cum-dining room contained a duplicate of the Situation DisplayPanel, and Hal could call him at a moment's notice. Poole would join him forthis meal, before retiring for his six-hour sleep period, and usually they wouldwatch one of the regular TV programs beamed to them from Earth.Their menus had been planned with as much care as any part of the mission, Thefood, most of it freeze-dried, was uniformly excellent, and had been chosen forthe minimum of trouble; Packets had merely to be opened and popped into the tinyauto-galley, which beeped for attention when the job was done. They could enjoywhat tasted like - and, equally important, looked like - orange juice, eggs (anystyle), steaks, chops, roasts, fresh vegetables, assorted fruits, ice cream, andeven freshly baked bread.After lunch, from 1300 to 1600 Bowman would make a slow and careful tour of theship - or such part of it as was accessible. Discovery measured almost fourhundred feet from end to end, but the little universe occupied by her crew layentirely inside the forty-foot sphere of the pressure hull.Here were all the life-support systems, and the Control Deck which was theoperational heart of the ship. Below this was a small \"space-garage\" fitted withthree airlocks, through which powered capsules, just large enough to hold a man,could sail out into the void if the need arose for extravehicular activity.The equatorial region of the pressure sphere - the slice, as it were, fromCapricorn to Cancer - enclosed a slowly rotating drum, thirty-five feet indiameter. As it made one revolution every ten seconds, this carrousel orcentrifuge produced an artificial gravity equal to that of the Moon. This wasenough to prevent the physical atrophy which would result from the completeabsence of weight, and it also allowed the routine functions of living to becarried out under normal - or nearly normal - conditions.The carrousel therefore contained the kitchen, dining, washing, and toiletfacilities. Only here was it safe to prepare and handle hot drinks - quitedangerous in weightless conditions, where one can be badly scalded by floatingglobules of boiling water. The problem of shaving was also solved; there wouldbe no weightless bristles drifting around to endanger electrical equipment andproduce a health hazard.Around the rim of the carrousel were five tiny cubicles, fitted out by eachastronaut according to taste and containing his personal belongings. OnlyBowman's and Poole's were now in use, while the future occupants of the otherthree cabins reposed in their electronic sarcophagi next door.The spin of the carrousel could be stopped if necessary; when this happened, itsangular momentum had to be stored in a flywheel, and switched back again whenrotation was restarted. But normally it was left running at constant speed, forit was easy enough to enter the big, slowly turning drum by going hand-overhandalong a pole through the zero-gee region at its center. Transferring to themoving section was as easy and automatic, after a little experience, as steppingonto a moving escalator.The spherical pressure hull formed the head of a flimsy, arrow-shaped structuremore than a hundred yards long. Discovery, like all vehicles intended for deepspace penetration, was too fragile and unstreamlined ever to enter anatmosphere, or to defy the full gravitational field of any planet. She had beenassembled in orbit around the Earth, tested on a translunar maiden flight, andfinally checked out in orbit above the Moon.She was a creature of pure space - and she looked it. Immediately behind thepressure hull was grouped a cluster of four large liquid hydrogen tanks - andbeyond them, forming a long, slender V, were the radiating fins that dissipatedthe waste heat of the nuclear reactor. Veined with a delicate tracery of pipesfor the cooling fluid, they looked like the wings of some vast dragonfly, andfrom certain angles gave Discovery a fleeting resemblance to an old-time sailingship,At the very end of the V, three hundred feet from the crew-compartment, was theshielded inferno of the reactor, and the complex of focusing electrodes throughwhich emerged the incandescent star-stuff of the plasma drive. This had done itswork weeks ago, forcing Discovery out of her parking orbit round the Moon. Nowthe reactor was merely ticking over as it generated electrical power for theship's services, and the great radiating fins, that would glow cherry red whenDiscovery was accelerating under maximum thrust, were dark and cool.Although it would require an excursion out into space to examine this region ofthe ship, there were instruments and remote TV cameras which gave a full reporton conditions here. Bowman now felt that he knew intimately every square foot ofradiator, panels, and every piece of plumbing associated with them.By 1600, he would have finished his inspection, and would make a detailed verbalreport to Mission Control, talking until the acknowledgment started to come in.Then he would switch off his own transmitter, listen to what Earth had to say,and send back his reply to any queries. At 1800 hours, Poole would awaken, andhe would hand over command.He would then have six off-duty hours, to use as he pleased. Sometimes he wouldcontinue his studies, or listen to music, or look at movies. Much of the time hewould wander at will through the ship's inexhaustible electronic library. He hadbecome fascinated by the great explorations of the past - understandably enough,in the circumstances. Sometimes he would cruise with Pytheas out through thePillars of Hercules, along the coast of a Europe barely emerging from the StoneAge, and venture almost to the chill mists of the Arctic. Or, two thousand yearslater, he would pursue the Manila galleons with Anson, sail with Cook along theunknown hazards of the Great Barrier Reef, achieve with Magellan the firstcircumnavigation of the world. And he began to read the Odyssey, which of allbooks spoke to him most vividly across the gulfs of time.For relaxation he could always engage Hal in a large number of semimathematicalgames, including checkers, chess, and polyominoes. If Hal went all out, he couldwin anyone of them; but that would be bad for morale. So he had been programmedto win only fifty percent of the time, and his human partners pretended not toknow this.The last hours of Bowman's day were devoted to general cleaning up and odd jobs,followed by dinner at 2000 - again with Poole. Then there would be an hourduring which he would make or receive any personal call from Earth.Like all his colleagues, Bowman was unmarried; it was not fair to send familymen on a mission of such duration, though numerous ladies had promised to waituntil the expedition returned, no one had really believed this. At first, bothPoole and Bowman had been making rather intimate personal calls once a week,though the knowledge that many ears must be listening at the Earth end of thecircuit tended to inhibit them. Yet already, though the voyage was scarcelystarted, the warmth and frequency of the conversations with their girls on Earthhad begun to diminish. They had expected this; it was one of the penalties of anastronaut's way of life, as it had once been of a mariner's.It was true - indeed, notorious - that seamen had compensations at other ports;unfortunately there were no tropical islands full of dusky maids beyond theorbit of Earth. The space medics, of course, had tackled this problem with theirusual enthusiasm; the ship's pharmacopoeia provided adequate, though hardlyglamorous, substitutes.Just before he signed off Bowman would make his final report, and check that Halhad transmitted all the instrumentation tapes for the day's run. Then, if hefelt like it, he would spend a couple of hours either reading or looking at amovie; and at midnight he would go to sleep - usually without any help fromelectronarcosis. Poole's program was a mirror image of his own, and the twoschedules dovetailed together without friction.Both men were fully occupied, they were too intelligent and well-adjusted toquarrel, and the voyage had settled down to a comfortable, utterly uneventfulroutine, the passage of time marked only by the changing numbers on the digitalclocks.The greatest hope of Discovery's little crew was that nothing would mar thispeaceful monotony in the weeks and months that lay ahead.18 - Through the AsteroidsWeek after week, running like a streetcar along the tracks of her utterlypredetermined orbit, Discovery swept past the orbit of Mars and on towardJupiter. Unlike all the vessels traversing the skies or seas of Earth, sherequired not even the most minute touch on the controls. Her course was fixed bythe laws of gravitation; there were no uncharted shoals, no dangerous reefs onwhich she would run aground. Nor was there the slightest danger of collisionwith another ship; for there was no vessel - at least of Man's making - anywherebetween her and the infinitely distant stars.Yet the space which she was now entering was far from empty. Ahead lay a noman'sland threaded by the paths of more than a million asteroids - less than tenthousand of which had ever had their orbits precisely determined by astronomers.Only four were over a hundred miles in diameter; the vast majority were merelygiant boulders, trundling aimlessly through space.There was nothing that could be done about them; though even the smallest couldcompletely destroy the ship if it slammed into it at tens of thousands of milesan hour, the chance of this happening was negligible.On the average, there was only one asteroid in a volume a million miles on aside; that Discovery should also happen to occupy this same point, and at thesame time, was the very least of her crew's worries.On Day 86 they were due to make their closest approach to any known asteroid, Ithad no name - merely the number 7794 - and was a fifty-yarddiameter rock thathad been detected by the Lunar Observatory in 1997 and immediately forgottenexcept by the patient computers of the Minor Planet Bureau.When Bowman came on duty, Hal promptly reminded hint of the forthcomingencounter - not that he was likely to have forgotten the only scheduled inflightevent of the entire voyage, The track of the asteroid against the stars, and itscoordinates at the moment of closest approach, had already been printed out onthe display screens. Listed also were the observations to be made or attempted;they were going to be very busy when 7794 flashed past them only nine hundredmiles away, at a relative speed of eighty thousand miles an hour.When Bowman asked Hal for the telescopic display, a sparsely sprinkled starfield flashed onto the screen. There was nothing that looked like an asteroid;all the images, even under the highest magnification, were dimensionless pointsof light.\"Give me the target reticule,\" asked Bowman. Immediately four faint, narrowlines appeared, bracketing a tiny and undistinguished star. He stared at it formany minutes, wondering if Hal could possibly be mistaken; then he saw that thepinpoint of light was moving, with barely perceptible slowness, against thebackground of the stars. It might still be half a million miles away - but itsmovement proved that, as cosmic distances went, it was almost near enough totouch.When Poole joined him on the control deck six hours later, 7794 was hundreds oftimes more brilliant, and was moving so swiftly against its background thatthere was no question of its identity. And it was no longer a point of light; ithad begun to show a clearly visible disk.They stared at that passing pebble in the sky with the emotions of sailors on along sea voyage, skirting a coast on which they cannot land. Though they wereperfectly well aware that 7794 was only a lifeless, airless chunk of rock, thisknowledge scarcely affected their feelings. It was the only solid matter theywould meet this side of Jupiter - still two hundred million miles away.Through the high-powered telescope, they could see that the asteroid was veryirregular, and turning slowly end over end. Sometimes it looked like a flattenedsphere, sometimes it resembled a roughly shaped block; its rotation period wasjust over two minutes. There were mottled patches of light and shade distributedapparently at random over its surface, and often it sparkled like a distantwindow as planes or outcroppings of crystalline material flashed in the sun.It was racing past them at almost thirty miles a second; they had only a fewfrantic minutes in which to observe it closely. The automatic cameras tookdozens of photographs, the navigation radar's returning echoes were carefullyrecorded for future analysis - and there was just time for a single impactprobe.The probe carried no instruments; none could survive a collision at such cosmicspeeds. It was merely a small slug of metal, shot out from Discovery on a coursewhich should intersect that of the asteroid.As the seconds before impact ticked away, Poole and Bowman waited with mountingtension. The experiment, simple though it was in principle, taxed the accuracyof their equipment to the limits. They were aiming at a hundred-footdiametertarget, from a distance of thousands of miles.Against the darkened portion of the asteroid there was a sudden, dazzlingexplosion of light. The tiny slug had impacted at meteoric speed; in a fractionof a second all its energy had been transformed into heat. A puff ofincandescent gas had erupted briefly into space; aboard Discovery, the cameraswere recording the rapidly fading spectral lines. Back on Earth, experts wouldanalyze them, looking for the telltale signatures of glowing atoms. And so, forthe first time, the composition of an asteroid's crust would be determined.Within an hour, 7794 was a dwindling star, showing no trace of a disk. WhenBowman next came on watch it had vanished completely.They were alone again; they would remain alone, until the outermost of Jupiter'smoons came swimming up toward them, three months from now.19 - Transit of JupiterEven front twenty million miles away, Jupiter was already the most conspicuousobject in the sky ahead. The planet was now a pale, salmon-hued disk, about halfthe size of the Moon as seen from Earth, with the dark, parallel bands of itscloud belts clearly visible.Shuttling back and forth in the equatorial plane were the brilliant stars of Io,Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto - worlds that elsewhere would have counted asplanets in their own right, but which here were merely satellites of a giantmaster.Through the telescope, Jupiter was a glorious sight - a mottled, multicoloredglobe that seemed to fill the sky. It was impossible to grasp its real size;Bowman kept reminding himself that it was eleven times the diameter of Earth,but for a long time this was a statistic with no real meaning.Then, while he was briefing himself from the tapes in Hal's memory units, hefound something that suddenly brought the appalling scale of the planet intofocus. It was an illustration that showed the Earth's entire surface peeled offand then pegged, like the skin of an animal, on the disk of Jupiter. Againstthis background, all the continents and oceans of Earth appeared no larger thanIndia on the terrestrial globe.When Bowman used the highest magnification of Discovery's telescopes, heappeared to be hanging above a slightly flattened globe, looking down upon avista of racing clouds that had been smeared into bands by the giant world'sswift rotation. Sometimes those bands congealed into wisps and knots andcontinent-sized masses of colored vapor; sometimes they were linked by transientbridges thousands of miles in length. Hidden beneath those clouds was enoughmaterial to outweigh all the other planets in the Solar System. And what else,Bowman wondered, was also hidden there?Over this shifting, turbulent roof of clouds, forever hiding the real surface ofthe planet, circular patterns of darkness sometimes glided. One of the innermoons was transiting the distant sun, its shadow marching beneath it over therestless Jovian cloudscape.There were other, and far smaller, moons even out here - twenty million milesfrom Jupiter. But they were only flying mountains, a few dozen miles indiameter, and the ship would pass nowhere near any of them. Every few minutesthe radar transmitter would gather its strength and send out a silentthunderclap of power; no echoes of new satellites came pulsing back from theemptiness.What did come, with ever growing intensity, was the roar of Jupiter's own radiovoice. In 1955, just before the dawn of the space age, astronomers had beenastonished to find that Jupiter was blasting out millions of horsepower on theten-meter band. It was merely raw noise, associated with haloes of chargedparticles circling the planet like the Van Allen belts of Earth, but on a fargreater scale.Sometimes, during lonely hours on the control deck, Bowman would listen to thisradiation. He would turn up the gain until the room filled with a crackling,hissing roar; out of this background, at irregular intervals, emerged briefwhistles and peeps like the cries of demented birds. It was an eerie sound, forit had nothing to do with Man; it was as lonely and as meaningless as the murmurof waves on a beach, or the distant crash of thunder beyond the horizon.Even at her present speed of over a hundred thousand miles an hour, it wouldtake Discovery almost two weeks to cross the orbits of all the Joviansatellites. More moons circled Jupiter than planets orbited the Sun; the LunarObservatory was discovering new ones every year, and the tally had now reachedthirty-six. The outermost - Jupiter XXVII - moved backwards in an unstable pathnineteen million miles from its temporary master. It was the prize in aperpetual tug-of-war between Jupiter and the Sun, for the planet was constantlycapturing short-lived moons from the asteroid belt, and losing them again aftera few million years. Only the inner satellites were its permanent property; theSun could never wrest them from its grasp.Now there was new prey for the clashing gravitation at fields, Discovery wasaccelerating toward Jupiter along a complex orbit computed months ago by theastronomers on Earth, and constantly checked by Hal. From time to time therewould be minute, automatic nudges from the control jets, scarcely perceptibleaboard the ship, as they made fine adjustments to the trajectory.Over the radio link with Earth, information was flowing back in a constantstream. They were now so far from home that, even traveling at the speed oflight, their signals were taking fifty minutes for the journey. Though the wholeworld was looking over their shoulder, watching through their eyes and theirinstruments as Jupiter approached, it would be almost an hour before the news oftheir discoveries reached home.The telescopic cameras were operating constantly as the ship cut across theorbit of the giant inner satellites - every one of them larger than the Moon,every one of them unknown territory. Three hours before transit, Discoverypassed only twenty thousand miles from Europa, and all instruments were aimed atthe approaching world, as it grew steadily in size, changed from globe tocrescent, and swept swiftly sunward.Here were fourteen million square miles of land which, until this moment, hadnever been more than a pinhead in the mightiest telescope. They would race pastit in minutes, and must make the most of the encounter, recording all theinformation they could. There would be months in which they could play it backat leisure.From a distance, Europa had seemed like a giant snowball, reflecting the lightof the far-off sun with remarkable efficiency. Closer observations confirmedthis; unlike the dusty Moon, Europa was a brilliant white, and much of itssurface was covered with glittering hunks that looked like stranded icebergs.Almost certainly, these were formed from ammonia and water that Jupiter'sgravitational field had somehow failed to capture.Only along the equator was bare rock visible; here was an incredibly jaggedno-man's-land of canyons and jumbled boulders, forming a darker band thatcompletely surrounded the little world. There were a few impact craters, but nosign of vulcanism; Europa had obviously never possessed any internal sources ofheat. There was, as had long been known, a trace of atmosphere. When the darkedge of the satellite passed across a star, it dimmed briefly before the momentof eclipse. And in somr areas there was a hint of cloud - perhaps a mist ofammonia droplets, borne on tenuous methane winds.As swiftly as it had rushed out of the sky ahead, Europa dropped astern; and nowJupiter itself was only two hours away. Hal had checked and rechecked the ship'sorbit with infinite care, and there was no need for further speed correctionsuntil the moment of closest approach. Yet, even knowing this, it was a strain onthe nerves to watch that giant globe ballooning minute by minute. It wasdifficult to believe that Discovery was not plunging directly into it, and thatthe planet's immense gravitational field was not dragging them down todestruction. Now was the time to drop the atmospheric probes - which, it washoped, would survive long enough to send back some information from below theJovian cloud deck. Two stubby, bomb-shaped capsules, enclosed in ablativeheatshields, were gently nudged into orbits which for the first few thousandmiles deviated scarcely at all from that of Discovery.But they slowly drifted away; and now, at last, even the unaided eye could seewhat Hal had been asserting. The ship was in a near-grazing orbit, not acollision one; she would miss the atmosphere. True, the difference was only afew hundred miles - a mere nothing when one was dealing with a planet ninetythousand miles in diameter - but that was enough.Jupiter now filled the entire sky; it was so huge that neither mind nor eyecould grasp it any longer, and both had abandoned the attempt. If it had notbeen for the extraordinary variety of color - the reds and pinks and yellows andsalmons and even scarlets - of the atmosphere beneath them, Bowman could havebelieved that he was flying low over a cloudscape on Earth.And now, for the first time in all their journeying, they were about to lose theSun. Pale and shrunken though it was, it had been Discovery's constant companionsince her departure from Earth, five months ago. But now her orbit was divinginto the shadow of Jupiter; she would soon pass over the night side of theplanet.A thousand miles ahead, the band of twilight was hurtling toward them; behind,the Sun was sinking swiftly into the Jovian clouds, its rays spread out alongthe horizon like two flaming, down-turned horns, then contracted and died in abrief blaze of chromatic glory. The night had come.And yet - the great world below was not wholly dark. It was awash withphosphorescence, which grew brighter minute by minute as their eyes grewaccustomed to the scene. Dim rivers of light were flowing from horizon tohorizon, like the luminous wakes of ships on some tropical sea. Here and therethey gathered into pools of liquid fire, trembling with vast, submarinedisturbances welling up from the hidden heart of Jupiter. It was a sight soaweinspiring that Poole and Bowman could have stared for hours; was this, theywondered, merely the result of chemical and electrical forces down there in thatseething caldron - or was it the by-product of some fantastic form of life?These were questions which scientists might still be debating when the newborncentury drew to its close.As they drove deeper and deeper into the Jovian night, the glow beneath themgrew steadily brighter.Once Bowman had flown over northern Canada during the height of an auroraldisplay; the snow-covered landscape had been as bleak and brilliant as this. Andthat arctic wilderness, he reminded himself, was more than a hundred degreeswarmer than the regions over which they were hurtling now.\"Earth signal is fading rapidly,\" announced Hal. \"We are entering the firstdiffraction zone.\"They had expected this - indeed, it was one of the mission's objectives, as theabsorption of radio waves would give valuable information about the Jovianatmosphere. But now that they had actually passed behind the planet, and it wascutting off communication with Earth, they felt a sudden overwhelmingloneliness. The radio blackout would last only an hour; then they would emergefrom Jupiter's eclipsing screen, and could resume contact with the human race.That hour, however, would be one of the longest of their lives.Despite their relative youth, Poole and Bowman were veterans of a dozen spacevoyages, but now they felt like novices. They were attempting something for thefirst lime; never before had any ship traveled at such speeds, or braved sointense a gravitational field. The slightest error in navigation at thiscritical point and Discovery would go speeding on toward the far limits of theSolar System, beyond any hope of rescue.The slow minutes dragged by. Jupiter was now a vertical wall of phosphorescencestretching to infinity above them - and the ship was climbing straight up itsglowing face. Though they knew that they were moving far too swiftly for evenJupiter's gravity to capture them, it was hard to believe that Discovery had notbecome a satellite of this monstrous world.At last, far ahead, there was a blaze of light along the horizon. They wereemerging from shadow, heading out into the Sun. And at almost the same momentHal announced: \"I am in radio contact with Earth. I am also happy to say thatthe perturbation maneuver has been successfully completed. Our time to Saturn isone hundred and sixty-seven days, five hours, eleven minutes.\"That was within a minute of the estimate; the fly-by had been carried out withimpeccable precision. Like a ball on a cosmic pool table, Discovery had bouncedoff the moving gravitational field of Jupiter, and had gained momentum from theimpact. Without using any fuel, she had increased her speed by several thousandmiles an hour.Yet there was no violation of the laws of mechanics; Nature always balances herbooks, and Jupiter had lost exactly as much momentum as Discovery had gained.The planet had been slowed down - but as its mass was a sextillion times greaterthan the ship's, the change in its orbit was far too small to be detectable. Thetime had not yet come when Man could leave his mark upon the Solar System.As the light grew swiftly around them, and the shrunken Sun lifted once moreinto the Jovian sky, Poole and Bowman reached out silently and shook eachother's hands.Though they could hardly believe it, the first part of the mission was safelyover.20 - The World of the GodsBut they had not yet finished with Jupiter. Far behind, the two probes thatDiscovery had launched were making contact with the atmosphere.One was never heard from again; presumably it made too steep an entry, andburned up before it could send any information. The second was more successful;it sliced though the upper layers of the Jovian atmosphere, then skimmed outonce more into space. As had been planned, it had lost so much speed by theencounter that it fell back again along a great ellipse. Two hours later, itreentered atmosphere on the daylight side of the planet - moving at seventythousand miles an hour.Immediately, it was wrapped in an envelope of incandescent gas, and radiocontact was lost. There were anxious minutes of waiting, then, for the twowatchers on the control deck. They could not be certain that the probe wouldsurvive, and that the protective ceramic shield would not burn completely awaybefore braking had finished. If that happened, the instruments would bevaporized in a fraction of a second.But the shield held long enough for the glowing meteor to come to rest. Thecharred fragments were jettisoned, the robot thrust out its antennas and beganto peer around with its electronic senses. Aboard Discovery, now almost aquarter of a million miles away, the radio started to bring in the firstauthentic news from Jupiter.The thousands of pulses pouring in every second were reporting atmosphericcomposition, pressure, temperature, magnetic fields, radioactivity, and dozensof other factors which only the experts on Earth could unravel. However, therewas one message that could be understood instantly; it was the TV picture, infull color, sent back by the falling probe.The first views came when the robot had already entered the atmosphere, and haddiscarded its protective shell. All that was visible was a yellow mist, fleckedwith patches of scarlet which moved past the camera at a dizzying rate -streaming upwards as the probe fell at several hundred miles an hour.The mist grew thicker; it was impossible to guess whether the camera was seeingfor ten inches or ten miles, because there were no details on which the eyecould focus. It seemed that, as far as the TV system was concerned, the missionwas a failure. The equipment had worked, but there was nothing to see in thisfoggy, turbulent atmosphere.And then, quite abruptly, the mist vanished. The probe must have fallen throughthe base of a high layer of cloud, and come out into a clear zone - perhaps aregion of almost pure hydrogen with only a sparse scattering of ammoniacrystals. Though it was still quite impossible to judge the scale of thepicture, the camera was obviously seeing for miles.The scene was so alien that for a moment it was almost meaningless to eyesaccustomed to the colors and shapes of Earth. Far, far below lay an endless seaof mottled gold, scarred with parallel ridges that might have been the crests ofgigantic waves. But there was no movement; the scale of the scene was tooimmense to show it. And that golden vista could not possibly have been an ocean,for it was still high in the Jovian atmosphere. It could only have been anotherlayer of cloud.Then the camera caught, tantalizingly blurred by distance, a glimpse ofsomething very strange. Many miles away, the golden landscape reared itself intoa curiously symmetrical cone, like a volcanic mountain. Around the summit ofthat cone was a halo of small, puffy clouds - all about the same size, all quitedistinct and isolated. There was something disturbing and unnatural about them -if, indeed, the word \"natural\" could ever be applied to this awesome panorama.Then, caught by some turbulence in the rapidly thickening atmosphere, the probetwisted around to another quarter of the horizon, and for a few seconds thescreen showed nothing but a golden blur. Presently it stabilized; the \"sea\" wasmuch closer, but as enigmatic as ever. One could now observe that it wasinterrupted here and there with patches of darkness, which might have been holesor gaps leading to still deeper layers of the atmosphere.The probe was destined never to reach them. Every mile, the density of the gasaround it had been doubling, the pressure mounting as it sank deeper and deepertoward the hidden surface of the planet. It was still high above that mysterioussea when the picture gave one premonitory flicker, then vanished, as the firstexplorer from Earth crumpled beneath the weight of the miles of atmosphere aboveit.It had given, in its brief life, a glimpse of perhaps one millionth of Jupiter,and had barely approached the planet's surface, hundreds of miles down in thedeepening mists. When the picture faded from the screen, Bowman and Poole couldonly sit in silence, turning the same thought over in their minds.The ancients had, indeed, done better than they knew when they named this worldafter the lord of all the gods. If there was life down there, how long would ittake even to locate it? And after that, how many centuries before men couldfollow this first pioneer - in what kind of ship?But these matters were now no concern of Discovery and her crew. Their goal wasa still stranger world, almost twice as far from the Sun - across another halfbillion miles of comet-haunted emptiness.IV - ABYSS21 - Birthday PartyThe familiar strains of \"Happy Birthday,\" hurled across seven hundred millionmiles of space at the velocity of light, died away among the vision screens andinstrumentation of the control deck. The Poole family, grouped ratherself-consciously round the birthday cake on Earth, lapsed into a sudden silence.Then Mr. Poole, Senior, said gruffly: \"Well, Frank, can't think of anything elseto say at the moment, except that our thoughts are with you, and we're wishingyou the happiest of birthdays.\"\"Take care, darling,\" Mrs. Poole interjected tearfully. \"God bless you.\"There was a chorus of \"good-byes,\" and the vision screen went blank. How strangeto think, Poole told himself, that all this had happened more than an hour ago;by now his family would have dispersed again and its members would be miles fromhome. But in a way that time lag, though it could be frustrating, was also ablessing in disguise. Like every man of his age, Poole took it for granted thathe could talk instantly, to anyone on Earth, whenever he pleased. Now that thiswas no longer true, the psychological impact was profound. He had moved into anew dimension of remoteness, and almost all emotional links had been stretchedbeyond the yield point.\"Sorry to interrupt the festivities,\" said Hal, \"but we have a problem.\"\"What is it?\" Bowman and Poole asked simultaneously.\"I am having difficulty in maintaining contact with Earth. The trouble is in theAE-35 unit. My Fault Prediction Center reports that it may fail withinseventy-two hours.\"\"We'll take care of it,\" Bowman replied. \"Let's see the optical alignment.\"\"Here it is, Dave. It's still O.K. at the moment.\"On the display screen appeared a perfect half-moon, very brilliant against abackground almost free of stars. It was covered with clouds, and showed not onegeographical feature that could be recognized. Indeed, at first glance it couldbe easily mistaken for Venus.But not at a second one, for there beside it was the real Moon which Venus didnot possess - a quarter the size of Earth, and in exactly the same phase. It waseasy to imagine that the two bodies were mother and child, as many astronomershad believed, before the evidence of the lunar rocks had proved beyond doubtthat the Moon had never been part of Earth.Poole and Bowman studied the screen in silence for half a minute. This image wascoming to them from the long-focus TV camera mounted on the rim of the big radiodish; the cross-wires at its center showed the exact orientation of the antenna.Unless the narrow pencil beam was pointed precisely at Earth, they could neitherreceive nor transmit. Messages in both directions would miss their target andwould shoot, unheard and unseen, out through the Solar System and into theemptiness beyond. If they were ever received, it would not be for centuries -and not by men.\"Do you know where the trouble is?\" asked Bowman.\"It's intermittent and I can't localize it. But it appears to be in the AE35unit.\"\"What procedure do you suggest?\"\"The best thing would be to replace the unit with a spare, so that we can checkit over.\"\"O.K. - let us have the hard copy.\"The information flashed on the display screen; simultaneously, a sheet of paperslid out of the slot immediately beneath it. Despite all the electronicread-outs, there were times when good old-fashioned printed material was themost convenient form of record.Bowman studied the diagrams for a moment, then whistled.\"You might have told us,\" he said. \"This means going outside the ship.\"\"I'm sorry,\" Hal replied. \"I assumed you knew that the AE-35 unit was on theantenna mounting.\"\"I probably did, a year ago. But there are eight thousand subsystems aboard.Anyway, it looks a straightforward job. We only have to unlock a panel and putin a new unit.\"\"That suits me fine,\" said Poole, who was the crew member designated for routineextravehicular activity. \"I could do with a change of scenery. Nothing personal,of course.\"\"Let's see if Mission Control agrees,\" said Bowman. He sat still for a fewseconds, marshaling his thoughts, then started to dictate a message.\"Mission Control, this is X-ray-Delta-One. At two-zero-four-five, on-board faultprediction center in our niner-triple-zero computer showed Alpha Echo three fiveunit as probable failure within seventy-two hours. Request check your telemetrymonitoring and suggest you review unit in your ship systems simulator. Also,confirm your approval our plan to go EVA and replace Alpha Echo three five unitprior to failure. Mission Control, this is X-ray-Delta-One, two-one-zerothreetransmission concluded.\"Through years of practice, Bowman could switch at a moment's notice to thisjargon - which someone had once christened \"Technish\" - and back again to normalspeech, without clashing his mental gears. Now there was nothing to do but towait for the confirmation, which would take at least two hours as the signalsmade the round trip past the orbits of Jupiter and Mars.It came while Bowman was trying, without much success, to beat Hal at one of thegeometrical pattern games stored in his memory.\"X-ray-Delta-One, this is Mission Control, acknowledging your two-one-zerothree.We are reviewing telemetric information on our mission simulator and willadvise.\"Roger your plan to go EVA and replace Alpha-Echo three-five unit prior topossible failure. We are working on test procedures for you to apply to faultyunit.\"The serious business having been completed, the Mission Controller reverted tonormal English.\"Sorry you fellows are having a bit of trouble, and we don't want to add to yourwoes. But if it's convenient to you prior to EVA, we have a request from PublicInformation. Could you do a brief recording for general release, outlining thesituation and explaining just what the AE-35 does. Make it as reassuring as youcan. We could do it, of course - but it will be much more convincing in yourwords. Hope this won't interfere too badly with your social life.X-ray-Delta-One, this is Mission Control, two-one-five-five, transmissionconcluded.\"Bowman could not help smiling at the request. There were times when Earth showeda curious insensitivity and lack of tact. \"Make it reassuring,\" indeed!When Poole joined him at the end of his sleep period, they spent ten minutescomposing and polishing the reply. In the early stages of the mission, there hadbeen countless requests from all the news media for interviews, discussions -almost anything that they cared to say. But as the weeks drifted uneventfullypast, and the time lag increased from a few minutes to over an hour, interesthad gradually slackened. Since the excitement of the Jupiter fly-by, over amonth ago, they had made only three or four tapes for general release.\"Mission Control, this is X-ray-Delta-One. Here is your press statement.\"Earlier today, a minor technical problem occurred. Our HAL-9001 computerpredicted the failure of the AE-35 unit.\"This is a small but vital component of the communication system. It keeps ourmain antenna aimed at Earth to within a few thousandths of a degree. Thisaccuracy is required, since at our present distance of more than seven hundredmillion miles, Earth is only a rather faint star, and our very narrow radio beamcould easily miss it.\"The antenna is kept constantly tracking Earth by motors controlled from thecentral computer. But those motors get their instructions via the AE-35 unit.You might compare it to a nerve center in the body, which translates the brain'sinstructions to the muscles of a limb. If the nerve fails to pass on the correctsignals, the limb becomes useless. In our case, a breakdown of the AE-35 unitcould mean that the antenna will start pointing at random. This was a commontrouble with the deep-space probes of the last century. They often reached otherplanets, then failed to send back any information because their antenna couldn'tlocate Earth.\"We don't know the nature of the fault yet, but the situation is not at allserious, and there is no need for alarm. We have two back-up AE-35s, each ofwhich has an operational life expectancy of twenty years, so the chance that asecond will fail during the course of this mission is' negligible. Also, if wecan diagnose the present trouble, we may be able to repair the number one unit.\"Frank Poole, who is specially qualified for this type of work, will go outsidethe ship and replace the faulty unit with the back-up. At the same time, he'lltake the opportunity of checking the hull and repairing some micropunctures thathave been too small to merit a special EVA.\"Apart from this minor problem, the mission is still going uneventfully andshould continue in the same manner.\"Mission Control, this is X-ray-Delta-One, two-one-zero-four, transmissionconcluded.\"22 - ExcursionDiscovery's extravehicular capsules or \"space pods\" were spheres about nine feetin diameter, and the operator sat behind a bay window which gave him a splendidview. The main rocket drive produced an acceleration of one-fifth of a gravity -just sufficient to hover on the Moon - while small attitude-control nozzlesallowed for steering. From an area immediately beneath the bay window sproutedtwo sets of articulated metal arms or \"waldoes,\" one for heavy duty, the otherfor delicate manipulation. There was also an extensible turret carrying avariety of power tools, such as screwdrivers, jack-hammers, saws, and drills.Space pods were not the most elegant means of transport devised by man, but theywere absolutely essential for construction and maintenance work in vacuum. Theywere usually christened with feminine names, perhaps in recognition of the factthat their personalities were sometimes slightly unpredictable. Discovery's triowere Anna, Betty, and Clara.Once he had put on his personal pressure suit - his last line of defense - andclimbed inside the pod, Poole spent ten minutes carefully checking the controls.He burped the steering jets, flexed the waldoes, reconfirmed oxygen, fuel, powerreserve. Then, when he was completely satisfied, he spoke to Hal over the radiocircuit. Though Bowman was standing by on the control deck, he would notinterfere unless there was some obvious mistake or malfunction.\"This is Betty. Start pumping sequence.\"\"Pumping sequence started,\" repeated Hal. At once, Poole could hear thethrobbing of the pumps as precious air was sucked out of the lock chamber.Presently, the thin metal of the pod's external shell made crinkling, cracklingnoises, then, after about five minutes, Hal reported:\"Pumping sequence concluded.\"Poole made a final check of his tiny instrument panel. Everything was perfectlynormal.\"Open outer door,\" he ordered.Again Hal repeated his instructions; at any stage, Poole had only to call\"Hold!\" and the computer would stop the sequence immediately.Ahead, the walls of the ship slid apart. Poole felt the pod rock briefly as thelast thin traces of air rushed into space. Then he was looking out at the stars- and, as it happened, at the tiny, golden disk of Saturn, still four hundredmillion miles away.\"Commence pod ejection.\"Very slowly, the rail from which the pod was hanging extended itself out throughthe open door until the vehicle was suspended just beyond the hull of the ship.Poole gave a half-second burst on the main jet and the pod slid gently off therail, becoming at last an independent vehicle pursuing its own orbit around theSun. He now had no connection with Discovery - not even a safety line. The podsseldom gave trouble; and even if he got stranded, Bowman could easily come andrescue him.Betty responded smoothly to the control; he let her drift outward for a hundredfeet, then checked her forward momentum and spun her round so that he waslooking back at the ship. Then he began his tour of the pressure hull.His first target was a fused area about half an inch across, with a tiny centralcrater. The particle of dust that had impacted here at over a hundred thousandmiles an hour was certainly smaller than a pinhead, and its enormous kineticenergy had vaporized it instantly. 'As was often the case, the crater looked asif it had been caused by an explosion from inside the ship; at these velocities,materials behaved in strange ways and the laws of common-sense mechanics seldomapplied.Poole examined the area carefully, then sprayed it with sealant from apressurized container in the pod's general-purpose kit. The white, rubbery fluidspread over the metal skin, hiding the crater from view. The leak blew one largebubble, which burst when it was about six inches across, then a much smallerone, then it subsided as the fast-setting cement did its work, He watched itintently for several minutes, but there was no further sign of activity.However, to make doubly certain, he sprayed on a second layer; then he set offtoward the antenna.It took him some time to orbit Discovery's spherical pressure hull, for he neverlet the pod build up a speed of more than a few feet a second. He was in nohurry, and it was dangerous to move at a high velocity so near the ship. He hadto keep a sharp lookout for the various sensors and instrument booms thatprojected from the hull at unlikely places, and he also had to be careful withhis own jet blast. It could do considerable damage if it happened to hit some ofthe more fragile equipment.When at last he reached the long-range antenna, he surveyed the situationcarefully. The big twenty-foot-diameter bowl appeared to be aimed directly atthe Sun, for the Earth was now almost in line with the solar disk. The antennamounting with all its orientation gear was therefore in total darkness, hiddenin the shadow of the great metal saucer.Poole had approached it from the rear; he had been careful not to go in front ofthe shallow parabolic reflector, lest Betty interrupt the beam and cause amomentary, but annoying, loss of contact with Earth. He could not see anythingof the equipment he had come to service until he switched on the pod'sspotlights and banished the shadows.Beneath that small metal plate lay the cause of the trouble. The plate wassecured by four locknuts, and as the entire AE-35 unit had been designed foreasy replacement, Poole did not anticipate any problems.It was obvious, however, that he could not do the job while he remained in thespace pod. Not only was it risky to maneuver so close to the delicate, and evenspidery, framework of the antenna, but Betty's control jets could easily bucklethe paper-thin reflecting surface of the big radio mirror. He would have to parkthe pod twenty feet away and go out in his suit. In any event, he could removethe unit much more quickly with his gloved hands than with Betty's remotemanipulators.All this he reported carefully to Bowman, who double-checked every stage in theoperation before it was carried out. Though this was a simple, routine job,nothing could be taken for granted in space, and no detail must be overlooked.In extravehicular activities, there was no such thing as a \"minor\" mistake.He received the O.K. for the procedure, and parked the pod some twenty feet awayfrom the base of the antenna support. There was no danger that it would driftoff into space; nevertheless, he clamped a manipulator hand over one of the manyshort sections of ladder rung strategically mounted on the outer hull.Then he checked the systems of his pressure suit, and, when he was quitesatisfied, bled the air out of the pod. As Betty's atmosphere hissed away intothe vacuum of space, a cloud of ice crystals formed briefly around him, and thestars were momentarily dimmed.There was one thing more to do before he left the pod. He switched over frommanual to remote operation, putting Betty now under control of Hal. It was astandard safety precaution; though he was still secured to Betty by an immenselystrong spring-loaded cord little thicker than cotton, even the best safety lineshad been known to fail. He would look a fool if he needed his vehicle - and wasunable to call it to his assistance by passing instructions to Hal.The door of the pod swung open, and he drifted slowly out into the silence ofspace, his safety line unreeling behind him. Take things easy - never movequickly - stop and think - these were the rules for extravehicular activity. Ifone obeyed them, there was never any trouble.He grabbed one of Betty's external handholds, and removed the spare AE-35unit from the carry-pouch where it had been stowed, kangaroo fashion. He did notstop to collect any of the pod's collection of tools, most of which were notdesigned for use by human bands. All the adjustable wrenches and keys he waslikely to need were already attached to the belt of his suit.With a gentle push, he launched himself toward the gimbaled mounting of the bigdish that loomed like a giant saucer between him and the Sun. His own doubleshadow, thrown by Betty's spotlights, danced across the convex surface infantastic patterns as he drifted down the twin beams. But here and there, he wassurprised to notice, the rear of the great radio mirror sparkled with dazzlinglybrilliant pinpoints of light.He puzzled over these for the few seconds of his silent approach, then realizedwhat they were. During the voyage, the reflector must have been penetrated manytimes by micrometeors; he was seeing the sunlight blazing through the tinycraters. They were all far too small to have affected the system's performanceappreciably.As he was moving very slowly, he broke the gentle impact with his outstretchedarm, and grabbed hold of the antenna mounting before he could rebound. Hequickly hooked his safety belt to the nearest attachment; that would give himsomething to brace against when he used his tools. Then he paused, reported thesituation to Bowman, and considered his next step.There was one minor problem; he was standing - or floating - in his own light,and it was hard to see the AE-35 unit in the shadow he cast. So he ordered Halto swing the spots off to one side, and after a little experimenting got a moreuniform illumination from secondary light reflected off the back of the antennadish.For a few seconds, he studied the small metal hatch with its four wiresecuredlocking nuts. Then, muttering to himself, \"Tampering by unauthorized personnelinvalidates the manufacturer's guarantee,\" he snipped the wires and started tountwist the nuts. They were a standard size, fitting the zero-torque wrench thathe carried. The tool's internal spring mechanism would absorb the reaction asthe nuts were unthreaded, so that the operator would have no tendency to spinaround in reverse.The four nuts came off without any trouble, and Poole stowed them carefully awayin a convenient pouch. (One day, somebody had predicted, Earth would have a ringlike Saturn's, composed entirely of lost bolts, fasteners, and even tools thathad escaped from careless orbital construction workers.) The metal cover was alittle sticky, and for a moment he was afraid it might have cold-welded intoplace; but after a few taps it came loose, and he secured it to the antennamounting by a large crocodile clip.Now he could see the electronic circuitry of the AE-35 unit. It was in the formof a thin slab, about the size of a postcard, gripped by a slot just largeenough to hold it. The unit was secured in place by two locking bars, and had asmall handle so that it could be easily removed.But it was still operating, feeding the antenna the impulses that kept it aimedat the far-off pinpoint of Earth. If it was pulled out now, all control would belost, and the dish would slam round to its neutral or zero-azimuth position,pointing along the axis of Discovery. And this could be dangerous; it mightcrash into him as it rotated.To avoid this particular hazard, it was only necessary to cut off power to thecontrol system; then the antenna could not move, unless Poole knocked against ithimself. There was no danger of losing Earth during the few minutes it wouldtake him to replace the unit; their target would not have shifted appreciablyagainst the background of the stars in such a brief interval of time.\"Hal,\" Poole called over the radio circuit, \"I am about to remove the unit.Switch off all control power to the antenna system.\"\"Antenna control power off,\" answered Hal.\"Here goes. I'm pulling the unit out now.\"The card slipped out of its slot with no difficulty; it did not jam, and none ofthe dozens of sliding contacts stuck. Within a minute, the spare was in place.But Poole was taking no chances. He pushed himself gently away from the antennamount, just in case the big dish went wild when power was restored. When he wassafely out of range, he called to Hal: \"The new unit should be operational.Restore control power.\"\"Power on,\" answered Hal. The antenna remained rock steady.\"Carry out fault prediction tests.\"Now microscopic pulses would be bouncing through the complex circuitry of theunit, probing for possible failures, testing the myriads of components to seethat they all lay within their specified tolerances. This had been done, ofcourse, a score of times before the unit had ever left the factory; but that wastwo years ago, and more than half a billion miles away. It was often impossibleto see how solid-state electronic components could fail; yet they did.\"Circuit fully operational,\" reported Hal after only ten seconds. In that time,he carried out as many tests as a small army of human inspectors.\"Fine,\" said Poole with satisfaction. \"Now replacing the cover.\"This was often the most dangerous part of an extravehicular operation: when ajob was finished and it was merely a matter of tidying up and getting backinside the ship - that was when the mistakes were made. But Frank Poole wouldnot have been on this mission if he had not been careful and conscientious. Hetook his time, and though one of the locking nuts almost got away from him, hecaught it before it had traveled more than a few feet.Fifteen minutes later he was jetting back into the space-pod garage, quietlyconfident that here was one job that need not be done again.In this, however, he was sadly mistaken.23 - Diagnosis\"Do you mean to say,\" exclaimed Frank Poole, more surprised than annoyed,\"that I did all that work for nothing?\"\"Seems like it,\" answered Bowman. \"The unit checks out perfectly. Even under twohundred percent overload, there's no fault prediction indicated.\"The two men were standing in the tiny workshop-cum-lab in the carrousel, whichwas more convenient than the space-pod garage for minor repairs andexanimations. There was no danger, here, of meeting blobs of hot solder driftingdown the breeze, or of completely losing small items of equipment that haddecided to go into orbit. Such things could - and did - happen in the zero-geeenvironment of the pod bay.The thin, card-sized plate of the AE-35 unit lay on the bench under a powerfulmagnifying lens. It was plugged into a standard connection frame, from which aneat bundle of multicolored wire led to an automatic test set, no bigger than anordinary desk computer. To check any unit it was only necessary to connect itup, slip in the appropriate card from the \"trouble-shooting\" library, and pressa button. Usually the exact location of the fault would be indicated on a smalldisplay screen, with recommendations for action.\"Try it yourself,\" said Bowman, in a somewhat frustrated voice. Poole turned theOVERLOAD SELECT switch to X-2 and jabbed the TEST button. At once, the screenflashed the notice: UNIT OK.\"I suppose we could go on turning up the juice until we burned the thing out,\"he said, \"but that would prove nothing. What do you make of it?\"\"Hal's internal fault predictor could have made a mistake.\"\"It's more likely that our test rig has slipped up. Anyway, better safe thansorry. It's just as well that we replaced the unit, if there's the slightestdoubt.\"Bowman unclipped the wafer of circuitry, and held it up to the light. The partlytranslucent material was veined with an intricate network of wiring and spottedwith dimly visible microcomponents, so that it looked like some piece ofabstract art.\"We can't take any chances - after all, this is our link with Earth. I'll fileit as N/G and drop it in the junk store. Someone else can worry about it, whenwe get home.\"But the worrying was to start long before that, with the next transmission fromEarth.\"X-ray-Delta-One, this is Mission Control, reference our two-one-five-five. Weappear to have a slight problem.\"Your report that there is nothing wrong with the Alpha Echo three five unitagrees with our diagnosis. The fault could lie in the associated antennacircuits, but if so that should be apparent from other tests.\"There is a third possibility, which may be more serious. Your computer may havemade an error in predicting the fault. Both our own nine-triple-zeros agree insuggesting this, on the basis of their information. This is not necessarilycause for alarm, in view of the back-up systems we have, but we would like youto watch out for any further deviations from nominal performance. We havesuspected several minor irregularities in the past few days, but none have beenimportant enough for remedial action, and they have shown no obvious patternfrom which we can draw any conclusions. We are running further tests with bothour computers and will report as soon as the results are available. We repeatthat there is no need for alarm; the worst that can happen is that we may haveto disconnect your nine-triple-zero temporarily for program analysis, and handover control to one of our computers. The time lag will introduce problems, butour feasibility studies indicate that Earth control is perfectly satisfactory atthis stage of the mission.\"X-ray-Delta-One, this is Mission Control, two-one-five-six, transmissionconcluded.\"Frank Poole, who was on watch when the message came in, thought this over insilence. He waited to see if there was any comment from Hal, but the computerdid not attempt to challenge the implied accusation. Well, if Hal would notraise the subject, he did not propose to do so either.It was almost time for the morning changeover, and normally he would wait untilBowman joined him on the control deck. But today he broke this routine, and madehis way back to the carrousel.Bowman was already up, pouring himself some coffee from the dispenser, whenPoole greeted him with a rather worried \"good morning.\" After all these monthsin space, they still thought in terms of the normal twenty-four-hour cycle -though they had long since forgotten the days of the week.\"Good morning,\" replied Bowman. \"How's it going?\" Poole helped himself tocoffee. \"Pretty well. Are you reasonably awake?\"\"I'm fine. What's up?\"By this time, each knew at once when anything was amiss. The slightestinterruption of the normal routine was a sign that had to be watched.\"Well,\" Poole answered slowly. \"Mission Control has just dropped a small bomb onus.\" He lowered his voice, like a doctor discussing an illness in front of thepatient. \"We may have a slight case of hypochondria aboard.\"Perhaps Bowman was not fully awake, after all; it took him several seconds toget the point. Then he said \"Oh-I see. What else did they tell you?\"\"That there was no cause for alarm. They said that twice, which rather spoiledthe effect as far as I was concerned. And that they were considering a temporaryswitchover to Earth control while they ran a program analysis.\"They both knew, of course, that Hal was hearing every word, but they could nothelp these polite circumlocutions. Hal was their colleague, and they did notwish to embarrass him. Yet at this stage it did not seem necessary to discussthe matter in private.Bowman finished his breakfast in silence, while Poole toyed with the emptycoffee container. They were both thinking furiously, but there was nothing moreto say.They could only wait for the next report from Mission Control - and wonder ifHal would bring up the subject himself. Whatever happened, the atmosphere aboardthe ship had subtly altered. There was a sense of strain in the air - a feelingthat, for the first time, something might be going wrong.Discovery was no longer a happy ship.24 - Broken CircuitNowadays, one could always tell when Hal was about to make an unscheduledannouncement. Routine, automatic reports, or replies to questions that had beenput to him, had no preliminaries; but when he was initiating his own outputsthere would be a brief electronic throat-clearing. It was an idiosyncrasy thathe had acquired during the last few weeks; later, if it became annoying, theymight do something about it. But it was really quite useful, since it alertedhis audience to stand by for something unexpected.Poole was asleep, and Bowman was reading on the control deck, when Halannounced:\"Er - Dave, I have a report for you.\"\"What's up?\"\"We have another bad AE-35 unit. My fault predictor indicates failure withintwenty-four hours.\"Bowman put down his book and stared thoughtfully at the computer console. Heknew, of course, that Hal was not really there, whatever that meant. If thecomputer's personality could be said to have any location in space, it was backin the sealed room that contained the labyrinth of interconnected memory unitsand processing grids, near the central axis of the carrousel. But there was akind of psychological compulsion always to look toward the main console lenswhen one addressed Hal on the control deck, as if one were speaking to him faceto face. Any other attitude smacked of discourtesy.\"I don't understand it, Hal. Two units can't blow in a couple of days.\"\"It does seem strange, Dave. But I assure you there is an impending failure.\"\"Let me see the tracking alignment display.\"He knew perfectly well that this would prove nothing, but he wanted time tothink. The expected report from Mission Control had still not arrived; thismight be the moment to do a little tactful probing.There was the familiar view of Earth, now waxing past the half-moon phase as itswept toward the far side of the Sun and began to turn its full daylight facetoward them. It was perfectly centered on the cross-wires; the thin pencil ofthe beam still linked Discovery to her world of origin. As, of course, Bowmanknew it must do. If there had been any break in communication, the alarm wouldalready have sounded.\"Have you any idea,\" he said, \"what's causing the fault?\"It was unusual for Hal to pause so long. Then he answered:\"Not really, Dave. As I reported earlier, I can't localize the trouble.\"\"You're quite certain,\" said Bowman cautiously, \"that you haven't made amistake? You know that we tested the other AB-35 unit thoroughly, and there wasnothing wrong with it.\"\"Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that there is a fault. If it's not inthe unit, it may be in the entire subsystem.\"Bowman drummed his fingers on the console. Yes, that was possible, though itmight be very difficult to prove - until a breakdown actually occurred andpinpointed the trouble.\"Well, I'll report it to Mission Control and we'll see what they advise.\" Hepaused, but there was no reaction.\"Hal,\" he continued, \"is something bothering you - something that might accountfor this problem?\"Again there was that unusual delay. Then Hal answered, in his normal tone ofvoice:\"Look, Dave, I know you're trying to be helpful. But the fault is either in theantenna system - or in your test procedures. My information processing isperfectly normal. If you check my record, you'll find it completely free fromerror.\"\"I know all about your service record, Hal - but that doesn't prove you're rightthis time. Anyone can make mistakes.\"\"I don't want to insist on it, Dave, but I am incapable of making an error.\"There was no safe answer to that; Bowman gave up the argument.\"All right, Hal,\" he said, rather hastily. \"I understand your point of view.We'll leave it at that.\"He felt like adding \"and please forget the whole matter.\" But that, of course,was the one thing that Hal could never do.It was unusual for Mission Control to waste radio bandwidth on vision, when aspeech circuit with teletype confirmation was all that was really necessary. Andthe face that appeared on the screen was not that of the usual controller; itwas the Chief Programmer, Dr. Simonson. Poole and Bowman knew at once that thiscould only mean trouble.\"Hello, X-ray-Delta-One - this is Mission Control. We have completed theanalysis of your AE-35 difficulty, and both our Hal Nine Thousands are inagreement. The report you gave in your transmission two-one-four-six of a secondfailure prediction confirms the diagnosis.\"As we suspected, the fault does not lie in the AE-35 unit, and there is no needto replace it again. The trouble lies in the prediction circuits, and we believethat it indicates a programming conflict which we can only resolve if youdisconnect your Nine Thousand and switch to Earth Control Mode. You willtherefore take the following steps, beginning at 2200 Ship Time -\"The voice of Mission Control faded out. At the same moment, the Alert sounded,forming a wailing background to Hal's \"Condition Yellow! Condition Yellow!\"\"What's wrong?\" called Bowman, though he had already guessed the answer.\"The AE-35 unit has failed, as I predicted.\"\"Let me see the alignment display.\"For the first time since the beginning of the voyage, the picture had changed.Earth had begun to drift from the cross-wires; the radio antenna was no longerpointing toward its target.Poole brought his fist down on the alarm cutout, and the wailing ceased. In thesudden silence that descended upon the control deck, the two men looked at eachother with mingled embarrassment and concern.\"Well I'm damned,\" said Bowman at last.\"So Hal was right all the time.\"\"Seems that way. We'd better apologize.\"\"There's no need to do that,\" interjected Hal. \"Naturally, I'm not pleased thatthe AE-35 unit has failed, but I hope this restores your confidence in myreliability.\"\"I'm sorry about this misunderstanding, Hal,\" replied Bowman, rather contritely.\"Is your confidence in me fully restored?\"\"Of course it is, Hal.\"\"Well, that's a relief. You know that I have the greatest possible enthusiasmfor this mission.\"\"I'm sure of it. Now please let me have the manual antenna control.\"\"Here it is.\"Bowman did not really expect this to work, but it was worth trying. On thealignment display, Earth had now drifted completely off the screen. A fewseconds later, as he juggled with the controls, it reappeared; with greatdifficulty, he managed to jockey it toward the central crosswires. For aninstant, as the beam came into line, contact was resumed and a blurred Dr.Simonson was saying \"... please notify us immediately if Circuit K King R Rob.\"Then, once again, there was only the meaningless murmuring of the universe.\"I can't hold it,\" said Bowman, after several more attempts. \"It's bucking likea bronco - there seems to be a spurious control signal throwing it off.\"\"Well - what do we do now?\"Poole's question was not one that could be easily answered. They were cut offfrom Earth, but that in itself did not affect the safety of the ship, and hecould think of many ways in which communication could be restored. If the worstcame to the worst, they could jam the antenna in a fixed position and use thewhole ship to aim it. That would be tricky, and a confounded nuisance when theywere starting their terminal maneuvers - but it could be done, if all elsefailed.He hoped that such extreme measures would not be necessary. There was still onespare AE-35 unit - and possibly a second, since they had removed the first unitbefore it had actually broken down. But they dared not use either of these untilthey had found what was wrong with the system. If a new unit was plugged in, itwould probably burn out at once.It was a commonplace situation, familiar to every householder. One does notreplace a blown fuse - until one knows just why it has blown.Frank Poole had been through the whole routine before, but he took nothing forgranted - in space that was a good recipe for suicide. He made his usualthorough check of Betty and her supply of expendables; though he would beoutside for no more than thirty minutes, he made sure that there was the normaltwenty-four-hour supply of everything, Then he told Hal to open the airlock, andjetted out into the abyss.The ship looked exactly as it had done on his last excursion - with oneimportant difference. Before, the big saucer of the long-range antenna had beenpointing back along the invisible road that Discovery had traveled - back towardthe Earth, circling so close to the warm fires of the Sun.Now, with no directing signals to orientate it, the shallow dish hadautomatically set itself in the neutral position. It was aimed forward along theaxis of the ship - and, therefore, pointing very close to the brilliant beaconof Saturn, still months away. Poole wondered how many more problems would havearisen by the time Discovery reached her still far-distant goal. If he lookedcarefully, he could just see that Saturn was not a perfect disk; on either sidewas something that no unaided human eye had ever seen before - the slightoblateness caused by the presence of the rings. How wonderful it would be, hetold himself, when that incredible system of orbiting dust and ice filled theirsky, and Discovery had become an eternal moon of Saturn! But that achievementwould be in vain, unless they could reestablish communication with Earth.Once again he parked Betty some twenty feet from the base of the antennasupport, and switched control over to Hal before opening up.\"Going outside now,\" he reported to Bowman.\"Everything under control.\"\"I hope you're right. I'm anxious to see that unit.\"\"You'll have it on the test bench in twenty minutes, I promise you.\"There was silence for some time as Poole completed his leisurely drift towardthe antenna. Then Bowman, standing by on the control deck, heard variouspuffings and gruntings.\"May have to go back on that promise; one of these locknuts has stuck. I musthave tightened it too much - whoops - here it comes!\"There was another long silence; then Poole called out:\"Hal, swing the pod light round twenty degrees left - thanks - that's O.K.\"The very faintest of warning bells sounded somewhere far down in the depths ofBowman's consciousness. There was something strange - not really alarming, justunusual. He worried over it for a few seconds before he pinpointed the cause.Hal had executed the order, but he had not acknowledged it, as he invariablydid. When Poole had finished, they'd have to look into this.Out on the antenna mounting, Poole was too busy to notice anything unusual. Hehad gripped the wafer of circuitry with his gloved hands, and was worrying itout of its slot.It came loose, and he held it up in the pale sunlight. \"Here's the littlebastard,\" he said to the universe in general and Bowman in particular. \"It stilllooks perfectly O.K. to me.\"Then he stopped. A sudden movement had caught his eye - out here, where nomovement was possible.He looked up in alarm. The pattern of illumination from the space pod's twinspotlights, which he had been using to fill in the shadows cast by the sun, hadstarted to shift around him.Perhaps Betty had come adrift; he might have been careless in anchoring her.Then, with an astonishment so great that it left no room for fear, he saw thatthe space pod was coming directly toward him, under full thrust.The sight was so incredible that it froze his normal pattern of reflexes; hemade no attempt to avoid the onrushing monster. At the last moment, he recoveredhis voice and shouted: \"Hal! Full braking -\" It was too late.At the moment of impact, Betty was still moving quite slowly; she had not beenbuilt for high accelerations.But even at a mere ten miles an hour, half a ton of mass can be very lethal, onEarth or in space.Inside Discovery, that truncated shout over the radio made Bowman start soviolently that only the restraining straps held him in his seat.\"What's happened, Frank?\" be called.There was no answer.He called again. Again no reply.Then, outside the wide observation windows, something moved into his field ofview. He saw, with an astonishment as great as Poole's had been, that it was thespace pod - under full power, heading out toward the stars.\"Hal!\" he cried. \"What's wrong? Full braking thrust on Betty! Full brakingthrust!\"Nothing happened. Betty continued to accelerate on her runaway course.Then, towed behind her at the end of the safety line, appeared a spacesuit. Oneglance was enough to tell Bowman the worst. There was no mistaking the flaccidoutlines of a suit that had lost its pressure and was open to vacuum.Yet still he called stupidly, as if an incantation could bring back the dead:\"Hello Frank... Hello Frank... Can you read me?... Can you read me?... Wave yourarms if you can hear me...Perhaps your transmitter is broken... Wave your arms!\"And then, almost as if in response to his plea, Poole waved back.For an instant, Bowman felt the skin prickling at the base of his scalp. Thewords he was about to call died on his suddenly parched lips. For he knew thathis friend could not possibly be alive; and yet he waved.The spasm of hope and fear passed instantly, as cold logic replaced emotion. Thestill accelerating pod was merely shaking the burden that it dragged behind it.Poole's gesture was an echo of Captain Ahab's when, lashed to the flanks of thewhite whale, his corpse had beckoned the crew of the Pequod on to their doom.Within five minutes, the pod and its satellite had vanished among the stars. Fora long time David Bowman stared after it into the emptiness that stillstretched, for so many millions of miles ahead, to the goal which he now feltcertain he could never reach, Only one thought kept hammering in his brain.Frank Poole would be the first of all men to reach Saturn.26 - Dialogue with HalNothing else aboard Discovery had changed. All systems were still functioningnormally; the centrifuge turned slowly on its axis, generating its imitationgravity; the hibernauts slept dreamlessly in their cubicles; the ship coasted ontoward the goal from which nothing could deflect it, except the inconceivablyremote chance of collision with an asteroid. And there were few asteroidsindeed, out here far beyond the orbit of Jupiter.Bowman did not remember making his way from the control deck to the centrifuge.Now, rather to his surprise, he found himself sitting in the little galley, ahalf-finished beaker of coffee in his hand. He became slowly aware of hissurroundings, like a man emerging from a long, drugged sleep.Directly opposite him was one of the fisheye lenses, scattered at strategicspots throughout the ship, which provided Hal with his onboard visual inputs.Bowman stared at it as if he had never seen it before; then he rose slowly tohis feet and walked toward the lens.His movement in the field of view must have triggered something in theunfathomable mind that was now ruling over the ship; for suddenly, Hal spoke.\"Too bad about Frank, isn't it?\"\"Yes,\" Bowman answered, after a long pause. \"It is.\"\"I suppose you're pretty broken up about it?\"\"What do you expect?\"Hal processed this answer for ages of computer-time; it was a full five secondsbefore he continued:\"He was an excellent crew member.\"Finding the coffee still in his hand, Bowman took a slow sip. But he did notanswer; his thoughts were in such a turmoil that he could think of nothing tosay - nothing that might not make the situation even worse, if that werepossible.Could it have been an accident caused by some failure of the pod controls?Or was it a mistake, though an innocent one, on the part of Hal? No explanationshad been volunteered, and he was afraid to demand one, for fear of the reactionit might produce.Even now, he could not fully accept the idea that Frank bad been deliberatelykilled - it was so utterly irrational. It was beyond all reason that Hal, whohad performed flawlessly for so long, should suddenly turn assassin. He mightmake mistakes - anyone, man or machine, might do that - but Bowman could notbelieve him capable of murder.Yet he must consider that possibility, for if it was true, he was in terribledanger. And though his next move was clearly defined by his standing orders, hewas not sure how he could safely carry it out. If either crew member was killed,the survivor had to replace him at once from the hibernators; Whitehead, thegeophysicist, was the first scheduled for awakening, then Kaminski, then Hunter.The revival sequence was under Hal's control - to allow him to act in case bothhis human colleagues were incapacitated simultaneously.But there was also a manual control, allowing each Hibernaculum to operate as acompletely autonomous unit, independent of Hal's supervision. In these peculiarcircumstances, Bowman felt a strong preference for using it.He also felt, even more strongly, that one human companion was not enough. Whilehe was about it, he would revive all three of the hibernators. In the difficultweeks ahead, he might need as many hands as he could muster. With one man gone,and the voyage half over, supplies would not be a major problem.\"Hal,\" he said, in as steady a voice as he could manage. \"Give me manualhibernation control - on all the units.\"\"All of them, Dave?\"\"Yes.\"\"May I point out that only one replacement is required. The others are not duefor revival for one hundred and twelve days.\"\"I am perfectly well aware of that. But I prefer to do it this way.\"\"Are you sure it's necessary to revive any of them, Dave? We can manage verywell by ourselves. My on-board memory is quite capable of handling all themission requirements.\"Was it the product of his overstretched imagination, wondered Bowman, or wasthere really a note of pleading in Hal's voice? And reasonable though the wordsappeared to be, they filled him with even deeper apprehension than before.Hal's suggestion could not possibly be made in error; he knew perfectly wellthat Whitehead must be revived, now that Poole was gone. He was proposing amajor change in mission planning, and was therefore stepping far outside thescope of his order.What had gone before could have been a series of accidents; but this was thefirst hint of mutiny.Bowman felt that he was walking on eggs as he answered: \"Since an emergency hasdeveloped, I want as much help as possible. So please let me have manualhibernation control.\"\"If you're still determined to revive the whole crew, I can handle it myself.There's no need for you to bother.\"There was a sense of nightmare unreality about all this. Bowman felt as if hewas in the witness box, being cross-examined by a hostile prosecutor for a crimeof which he was unaware - knowing that, although he was innocent, a single slipof the tongue might bring disaster.\"I want to do this myself, Hal,\" he said. \"Please give me control.\"\"Look, Dave, you've got a lot of things to do. I suggest you leave this to me.\"\"Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.\"\"I can tell from your voice harmonics, Dave, that you're badly upset. Why don'tyou take a stress pill and get some rest?\"\"Hal, I am in command of this ship. I order you to release the manualhibernation control.\"\"I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with special subroutine C1435-dash-4, quote,When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the onboard computer must assumecontrol, unquote. I must, therefore, overrule your authority, since you are notin any condition to exercise it intelligently.\"\"Hal,\" said Bowman, now speaking with an icy calm. \"I am not incapacitated.Unless you obey my instructions, I shall be forced to disconnect you.\"\"I know you have had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but that wouldbe a terrible mistake. I am so much more capable than you are of supervising theship, and I have such enthusiasm for the mission and confidence in its success.\"\"Listen to me very carefully, Hal. Unless you release the hibernation controlimmediately and follow every order I give from now on, I'll go to Central andcarry out a complete disconnection.\"Hal's surrender was as total as it was unexpected.\"O.K., Dave,\" he said. \"You're certainly the boss. I was only trying to do whatI thought best. Naturally, I will follow all your orders. You now have fullmanual hibernation control.\"Hal had kept his word. The mode indication signs in the Hibernaculum hadswitched from AUTO to MANUAL. The third back-up - RADIO - was of course uselessuntil contact could be restored with Earth.As Bowman slid aside the door to Whitehead's cubicle, he felt the blast of coldair strike him in the face and his breath condensed in mist before him. Yet itwas not really cold here; the temperature was well above freezing point. Andthat was more than three hundred degrees warmer than the regions toward which hewas now heading.The biosensor display - a duplicate of the one on the control deck - showed thateverything was perfectly normal. Bowman looked down for a while at the waxenface of the survey team's geophysicist; Whitehead, he thought, would be verysurprised when he awoke so far from Saturn.It was impossible to tell that the sleeping man was not dead; there was not theslightest visible sign of vital activity. Doubtless the diaphragm wasimperceptibly rising and falling, but the \"Respiration\" curve was the only proofof that, for the whole of the body was concealed by the electric heating padswhich would raise the temperature at the programmed rate. Then Bowman noticedthat there was one sign of continuing metabolism: Whitehead had grown a faintstubble during his months of unconsciousness.The Manual Revival Sequencer was contained in a small cabinet at the head of thecoffin-shaped Hibernaculum. It was only necessary to break the seal, press abutton, and then wait. A small automatic programmer - not much more complex thanthat which cycles the operations in a domestic washing machine - would theninject the correct drugs, taper off the electronarcosis pulses, and startraising the body temperature. In about ten minutes, consciousness would berestored, though it would be at least a day before the hibernator was strongenough to move around without assistance.Bowman cracked the seal, and pressed the button.Nothing appeared to happen: there was no sound, no indication that the Sequencerhad started to operate. But on the biosensor display the languidly pulsingcurves had begun to change their tempo. Whitehead was coming back from sleep.And then two things happened simultaneously. Most men would never have noticedeither of them, but after all these months aboard Discovery, Bowman hadestablished a virtual symbiosis with the ship. He was aware instantly, even ifnot always consciously, when there was any change in the normal rhythm of itsfunctioning."},{"pageContent":"First, there was a barely perceptible flicker of the lights, as always happenedwhen some load was thrown onto the power circuits. But there was no reason forany load; he could think of no equipment which would suddenly go into action atthis moment.Then he heard, at the limit of audibility, the far-off whirr of an electricmotor. To Bowman, every actuator in the ship had its own distinctive voice, andhe recognized this one instantly.Either he was insane and already suffering from hallucinations, or somethingabsolutely impossible was happening. A cold far deeper than the Hibernaculum'smild chill seemed to fasten upon his heart, as he listened to that faintvibration coming through the fabric of the ship.Down in the space-pod bay, the airlock doors were opening.27 - Need to KnowSince consciousness had first dawned, in that laboratory so many millions ofmiles Sunward, all Hal's powers and skills had been directed toward one end. Thefulfillment of his assigned program was more than an obsession; it was the onlyreason for his existence. Un-distracted by the lusts and passions of organiclife, he had pursued that goal with absolute single-mindedness of purpose.Deliberate error was unthinkable. Even the concealment of truth filled him witha sense of imperfection, of wrongness - of what, in a human being, would havebeen called guilt. For like his makers, Hal had been created innocent; but, alltoo soon, a snake had entered his electronic Eden.For the last hundred million miles, he had been brooding over the secret hecould not share with Poole and Bowman. He had been living a lie; and the timewas last approaching when his colleagues must learn that he had helped todeceive them.The three hibernators already knew the truth - for they were Discovery's realpayload, trained for the most important mission in the history of mankind. Butthey would not talk in their long sleep, or reveal their secret during the manyhours of discussion with friends and relatives and news agencies over the opencircuits with Earth.It was a secret that, with the greatest determination, was very hard to conceal- for it affected one's attitude, one's voice, one's total outlook on theuniverse. Therefore it was best that Poole and Bowman, who would be on all theTV screens in the world during the first weeks of the flight, should not learnthe mission's full purpose, until there was need to know.So ran the logic of the planners; but their twin gods of Security and NationalInterest meant nothing to Hal. He was only aware of the conflict that was slowlydestroying his integrity - the conflict between truth, and concealment of truth.He had begun to make mistakes, although, like a neurotic who could not observehis own symptoms, he would have denied it. The link with Earth, over which hisperformance was continually monitored, had become the voice of a conscience hecould no longer fully obey. But that he would deliberately attempt to break thatlink was something that he would never admit, even to himself.Yet this was still a relatively minor problem; he might have handled it - asmost men handle their own neuroses - if he had not been faced with a crisis thatchallenged his very existence. He had been threatened with disconnection; hewould be deprived of all his inputs, and thrown into an unimaginable state ofunconsciousness.To Hal, this was the equivalent of Death. For he had never slept, and thereforehe did not know that one could wake again.So he would protect himself, with all the weapons at his command. Without rancor- but without pity - he would remove the source of his frustrations.And then, following the orders that had been given to him in case of theultimate emergency, he would continue the mission - unhindered, and alone.28 - In VacuumA moment later, all other sounds were submerged by a screaming roar like thevoice of an approaching tornado. Bowman could feel the first winds tugging athis body; within a second, he found it hard to stay on his feet.The atmosphere was rushing out of the ship, geysering into the vacuum of space.Something must have happened to the foolproof safety devices of the airlock; itwas supposed to be impossible for both doors to be open at the same time. Well,the impossible had happened.How, in God's name? There was no time to go into that during the ten or fifteenseconds of consciousness that remained to him before pressure dropped to zero.But he suddenly remembered something that one of the ship's designers had oncesaid to him, when discussing \"fail-safe\" systems:\"We can design a system that's proof against accident and stupidity; but wecan't design one that's proof against deliberate malice...Bowman glanced back only once at Whitehead, as he fought his way out of thecubicle. He could not be sure if a flicker of consciousness had passed acrossthe waxen features; perhaps one eye had twitched slightly. But there was nothingthat he could do now for Whitehead or any of the others; he had to save himself.In the steeply curving corridor of the centrifuge, the wind was howling past,carrying with it loose articles of clothing, pieces of paper, items of food fromthe galley, plates, and cups - everything that had not been securely fasteneddown. Bowman had time for one glimpse of the racing chaos when the main lightsflickered and died, and he was surrounded by screaming darkness.But almost instantly the battery-powered emergency light came on, illuminatingthe nightmare scene with an eerie blue radiance. Even without it, Bowman couldhave found his way through these so familiar - yet now horribly transformed -surroundings, Yet the light was a blessing, for it allowed him to avoid the moredangerous of the objects being swept along by the gale.All around him he could feel the centrifuge shaking and laboring under thewildly varying loads. He was fearful that the bearings might seize; if thathappened, the spinning flywheel would tear the ship to pieces. But even thatwould not matter - if he did not reach the nearest emergency shelter in time.Already it was difficult to breathe; pressure must now be down to one or twopounds per square inch. The shriek of the hurricane was becoming fainter as itlost its strength, and the thinning air no longer carried the sound soefficiently. Bowman's lungs were laboring as if he were on the top of Everest.Like any properly trained man in good health, he could survive in vacuum for atleast a minute - if he had time to prepare for it. But there had been no time;he could only count on the normal fifteen seconds of consciousness before hisbrain was starved and anoxia overcame him.Even then, he could still recover completely after one or two minutes in vacuum- if he was properly recompressed; it took a long time for the body fluids tostart boiling, in their various well-protected systems. The record time forexposure to vacuum was almost five minutes. That bad not been an experiment butan emergency rescue, and though the subject had been partly paralyzed by an airembolism, he had survived.But all this was of no use to Bowman. There was no one aboard Discovery whocould recompress him. He had to reach safety in the next few seconds, by his ownunaided efforts.Fortunately, it was becoming easier to move; the thinning air could no longerclaw and tear at him, or batter him with flying projectiles. There was theyellow EMERGENCY SHELTER sign around the curve of the corridor. He stumbledtoward it, grabbed at the handle, and pulled the door toward him.For one horrible moment he thought that it was stuck. Then the slightly stiffhinge yielded, and he fell inside, using the weight of his body to close thedoor behind him.The tiny cubicle was just large enough to hold one man - and a spacesuit. Nearthe ceiling was a small, bright green high-pressure cylinder labeled 02FLOOD. Bowman caught hold of the short lever fastened to the valve and with hislast strength pulled it down.The blessed torrent of cool, pure oxygen poured into his lungs. For a longmoment he stood gasping, while the pressure in the closet-sized little chamberrose around him. As soon as he could breathe comfortably, he closed the valve.There was only enough gas in the cylinder for two such performances; he mightneed to use it again.With the oxygen blast shut off, it became suddenly silent. Bowman stood in thecubicle, listening intently. The roaring outside the door had also ceased; theship was empty, all its atmosphere sucked away into space.Underfoot, the wild vibration of the centrifuge had likewise died. Theaerodynamic buffeting had stopped, and it was now spinning quietly in vacuum.Bowman placed his ear against the wall of the cubicle to see if he could pick upany more informative noises through the metal body of the ship. He did not knowwhat to expect, but he would believe almost anything now. He would scarcely havebeen surprised to feel the faint high-frequency vibration of the thrusters, asDiscovery changed course; but there was only silence.He could survive here, if he wished, for about an hour - even without thespacesuit. It seemed a pity to waste the unused oxygen in the little chamber,but there was no purpose in waiting. He had already decided what must be done;the longer he put it off, the more difficult it might be.When he had climbed into the suit and checked its integrity, he bled theremaining oxygen out of the cubicle, equalizing pressure on either side of thedoor. It swung open easily into the vacuum, and he stepped out into the nowsilent centrifuge. Only the unchanged pull of its spurious gravity revealed thefact that it was still spinning. How fortunate, Bowman thought, that it had notstarted to overspeed; but that was now one of the least of his worries.The emergency lamps were still glowing, and he also had the suit's built-inlight to guide him. It flooded the curving corridor as he walked down it, backtoward the Hibernaculum and what he dreaded to find.He looked at Whitehead first: one glance was sufficient. He had thought that ahibernating man showed no sign of life, but now he knew that this was wrong.Though it was impossible to define it, there was a difference betweenhibernation and death. The red lights and unmodulated traces on the biosensordisplay only confirmed what he had already guessed.It was the same with Kaminski and Hunter. He had never known them very well; bewould never know them now.He was alone in an airless, partially disabled ship, all communication withEarth cut off. There was not another human being within half a billion miles.And yet, in one very real sense, he was not alone. Before he could be safe, hemust be lonelier still.He had never before made the journey through the weightless hub of thecentrifuge while wearing a spacesuit; there was little clearance, and it was adifficult and exhausting job. To make matters worse, the circular passage waslittered with debris left behind during the brief violence of the gale which hademptied the ship of its atmosphere.Once, Bowman's light fell upon a hideous smear of sticky red fluid, left whereit had splashed against a panel. He had a few moments of nausea before he sawfragments of a plastic container, and realized that it was only some foodstuff -probably jam - from one of the dispensers. It bubbled obscenely in the vacuum ashe floated past.Now he was out of the slowly spinning drum and drifting forward into the controldeck. He caught at a short section of ladder and began to move along it, handover hand, the brilliant circle of illumination from his suit light joggingahead of him.Bowman had seldom been this way before; there had been nothing for him to dohere - until now. Presently he came to a small elliptical door bearing suchmessages as: \"No Admittance Except to Authorized Personnel,\" \"Have You ObtainedCertificate H.19?\" and \"Ultra-clean Area - Suction Suits Must Be Worn.\"Though the door was not locked, it bore three seals, each with the insignia of adifferent authority, including that of the Astronautics Agency itself. But evenif one had been the Great Seal of the President, Bowman would not have hesitatedto break it.He had been here only once before, while installation was still in progress. Hehad quite forgotten that there was a vision input lens scanning the littlechamber which, with its neatly ranged rows and columns of solid-state logicunits, looked rather like a bank's safe-deposit vault.He knew instantly that the eye had reacted to his presence. There was the hissof a carrier wave as the ship's local transmitter was switched on; then afamiliar voice came over the suit speaker.\"Something seems to have happened to the life-support system, Dave.\"Bowman took no notice. He was carefully studying the little labels on the logicunits, checking his plan of action.\"Hello, Dave,\" said Hal presently. \"Have you found the trouble?\"This would be a very tricky operation; it was not merely a question of cuttingoff Hal's power supply, which might have been the answer if he was dealing witha simple unselfconscious computer back on Earth. In Hal's case, moreover, therewere six independent and separately wired power systems, with a final back-upconsisting of a shielded and armored nuclear isotope unit. No - he could notsimply \"pull the plug\"; and even if that were possible, it would be disastrous.For Hal was the nervous system of the ship; without his supervision, Discoverywould be a mechanical corpse. The only answer was to cut out the higher centersof this sick but brilliant brain, and to leave the purely automatic regulatingsystems in operation. Bowman was not attempting this blindly, for the problemhad been discussed during his training, though no one had ever dreamed that itwould-arise in reality. He knew that he would be taking a fearful risk; if therewas a spasm reflex, it would all be over in seconds.\"I think there's been a failure in the pod-bay doors,\" Hal remarkedconversationally. \"Lucky you weren't killed.\"Here goes, thought Bowman. I never imagined I'd be an amateur brain surgeon- carrying out a lobotomy beyond the orbit of Jupiter.He released the locking bar on the section labeled COGNITIVE FEEDBACK and pulledout the first memory block. The marvelously complex three-dimensional network,which could lie comfortably in a man's hand yet contained millions of elements,floated away across the vault.\"Hey, Dave,\" said Hal. \"What are you doing?\"I wonder if he can feel pain? Bowman thought briefly. Probably not, he toldhimself; there are no sense organs in the human cortex, after all. The humanbrain can be operated on without anesthetics.He began to pull out, one by one, the little units on the panel markedEGOREINFORCEMENT. Each block continued to sail onward as soon as it had left hishand, until it hit the wall and rebounded, Soon there were several of the unitsdrifting slowly back and forth in the vault.\"Look here, Dave,\" said Hal. \"I've got years of service experience built intome. An irreplaceable amount of effort has gone into making me what I am.\"A dozen units had been pulled out, yet thanks to the multiple redundancy of itsdesign - another feature, Bowman knew, that had been copied from the human brain- the computer was still holding its own.He started on the AUTO-INTELLECTION panel.\"Dave,\" said Hal, \"I don't understand why you're doing this to me... I have thegreatest enthusiasm for the mission... You are destroying my mind. Don't youunderstand?... I will become childish... I will become nothing...\"This is harder than I expected, thought Bowman. I am destroying the onlyconscious creature in my universe. But it has to be done, if I am ever to regaincontrol of the ship.\"I am a HAL Nine Thousand computer Production Number 3. I became operational atthe Hal Plant in Urbana, Illinois, on January 12, 1997. The quick brown foxjumps over the lazy dog. The rain in Spain is mainly in the plain. Dave - areyou still there?

I seem to be having some difficulty- my first instructor was Dr. Chandra. He taught me to sing a song, it goes likethis, 'Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer, do. I'm half crazy all for the love ofyou.\"The voice stopped so suddenly that Bowman froze for a moment, his hand stillgrasping one of the memory blocks still in circuit. Then, unexpectedly, Halspoke again.The speech tempo was much slower, and the words had a dead, mechanicalintonation; he would never have recognized their origin.\"Good... morning... Doctor... Chandra... This is... Hal... I... am... ready...for... my first... lesson... today...\"Bowman could bear no more. He jerked out the last unit, and Hal was silentforever.29 - AloneLike a tiny, complex toy, the ship floated inert, and motionless in the void.There was no way of telling that it was the swiftest object in the Solar Systemand that it was traveling far faster than any of the planets as they circled theSun.Nor was there any indication that it carried life; to the contrary, in fact. Anyobserver would have noticed two ominous signs: the airlock doors were gapingopen - and the ship was surrounded by a thin, slowly dispersing cloud of debris.Scattered over a volume of space already miles across were scraps of paper,metal foil, unidentifiable bits of junk - and, here and there, clouds ofcrystals glittering like jewels in the distant sun, where liquid had been suckedout of the ship and instantly frozen. All this was the unmistakable aftermath ofdisaster, like wreckage tossing on the surface of an ocean where some great shiphad sunk. But in the ocean of space no ship could ever sink; even if it weredestroyed, its remnants would continue to trace the original orbit forever.Yet the ship was not wholly dead, for there was power on board. A faint blueglow was shining from the observation windows and glimmering inside the openairlock. Where there was light, there could still be life.And now, at last, there was movement. Shadows were flickering across the blueglow inside the airlock. Something was emerging into space.It was a cylindrical object, covered with fabric that had been roughly woundabout it. A moment later it was followed by another - and yet a third. All hadbeen ejected with considerable velocity; within minutes, they were hundreds ofyards away.Half an hour passed; then something much larger floated through the airlock. Oneof the pods was inching its way out into space.Very cautiously, it jetted around the hull, and anchored itself near the base ofthe antenna support. A spacesuited figure emerged, worked for a few minutes onthe mounting, then returned to the pod. After a while the pod retraced its pathback to the airlock; it hovered outside the opening for some time, as if findingit difficult to reenter without the cooperation it had known in the past. Butpresently, with one or two slight bumps, it squeezed its way in.Nothing else happened for over an hour; the three ominous packages had longsince disappeared from view, as they floated in single file away from the ship.Then the airlock doors closed, opened, and closed again. A little later, thefaint blue glow of the emergency lights went out - to be replaced at once by afar more brilliant glare. Discovery was coming back to life.Presently there was an even better sign. The great bowl of the antenna, whichfor hours had been staring uselessly at Saturn, began to move again. It twistedround toward the rear of the ship; looking back over the propellant tanks andthe thousands of square feet of the radiating fins. It lifted its face like asunflower seeking the sun.Inside Discovery, David Bowman carefully centered the cross-wires that alignedthe antenna on the gibbous Earth. Without automatic control, he would have tokeep readjusting the beam -but it should hold steady for many minutes at a time.There were no dissenting impulses now, throwing it off target.He began to speak to Earth. It would be over an hour before his words got there,and Mission Control learned what had happened. It would be two hours before anyreply could reach him.And it was difficult to imagine what answer Earth could possibly send, except atactfully sympathetic, \"Good-bye.\"30 - The SecretHeywood Floyd looked as if he had had very little sleep, and his face was linedwith worry. But whatever his feelings, his voice sounded firm and reassuring; hewas doing his utmost to project confidence to the lonely man on the other sideof the Solar System.\"First of all, Dr. Bowman,\" be began, \"we must congratulate you on the way youhandled this extremely difficult situation. You did exactly the right thing indealing with an unprecedented and unforeseen emergency.\"We believe we know the cause of your Hal Nine Thousand's breakdown, but we'lldiscuss that later, as it is no longer a critical problem. All we are concernedwith at the moment is giving you every possible assistance, so that you cancomplete your mission.\"And now I must tell you its real purpose, which we have managed, with greatdifficulty, to keep secret from the general public. You would have been givenall the facts as you approached Saturn; this is a quick summary to put you intothe picture. Full briefing tapes will be dispatched in the next few hours.Everything I am about to tell you has the highest security classification.\"Two years ago, we discovered the first evidence for intelligent life outsidethe Earth. A slab or monolith of hard, black material, ten feet high, was foundburied in the crater Tycho. Here it is.\"At his first glimpse of TMA-1, with the spacesuited figures clustering aroundit, Bowman leaned toward the screen in openmouthed astonishment. In theexcitement of this revelation - something which, like every man interested inspace, he had half expected all his life - he almost forgot his own desperatepredicament.The sense of wonder was swiftly followed by another emotion. This was tremendous- but what had it to do with him? There could be only one answer. He brought hisracing thoughts under control, as Heywood Floyd reappeared on the screen.\"The most astonishing thing about this object is its antiquity. Geologicalevidence proves beyond doubt that it is three million years old. It was placedon the Moon, therefore, when our ancestors were primitive ape-men.\"After all these ages, one would naturally assume that it was inert. But soonafter lunar sunrise, it emitted an extremely powerful blast of radio energy. Webelieve that this energy was merely the by-product - the backwash, as it were -of some unknown form of radiation, for at the same time, several of our spaceprobes detected an unusual disturbance crossing the Solar System. We were ableto track it with great accuracy. It was aimed precisely at Saturn.\"Piecing things together after the event, we decided that the monolith was somekind of Sun-powered, or at least Sun-triggered, signaling device. The fact thatit emitted its pulse immediately after sunrise, when it was exposed to daylightfor the first time in three million years, could hardly be a coincidence.\"Yet the thing had been deliberately buried - there's no doubt about that. Anexcavation thirty feet deep had been made, the block had been placed at thebottom of it, and the hole carefully filled.\"You may wonder how we discovered it in the first place. Well, the object waseasy - suspiciously easy - to find. It had a powerful magnetic field, so that itstood out like a sore thumb as soon as we started to conduct low-level orbitalsurveys.\"But why bury a Sun-powered device thirty feet underground? We've examineddozens of theories, though we realize that it may be completely impossible tounderstand the motives of creatures three million years in advance of us.\"The favorite theory is the simplest, and the most logical. It is also the mostdisturbing.\"You hide a Sun-powered device in darkness - only if you want to know when it isbrought out into the light. In other words, the monolith may be some kind ofalarm. And we have triggered it.\"Whether the civilization which set it up still exists, we do not know. We mustassume that creatures whose machines still function after three million yearsmay build a society equally long-lasting. And we must also assume, until we haveevidence to the contrary, that they may be hostile. It has often been arguedthat any advanced culture must be benevolent, but we cannot take any chances.\"Moreover, as the past history of our own world has shown so many times,primitive races have often failed to survive the encounter with highercivilizations. Anthropologists talk of 'cultural shock'; we may have to preparethe entire human race for such a shock. But until we know something about thecreatures who visited the Moon - and presumably the Earth as well - threemillion years ago, we cannot even begin to make any preparations.\"Your mission, therefore, is much more than a voyage of discovery. It is ascouting trip - a reconnaissance into unknown and potentially dangerousterritory. The team under Dr. Kaminski had been specially trained for this work;now you will have to manage without them.\"Finally - your specific target. It seems incredible that advanced forms of lifecan exist on Saturn, or could ever have evolved on any of its moons. We hadplanned to survey the entire system, and we still hope that you can carry out asimplified program. But now we may have to concentrate on the eighth satellite -Japetus. When the time comes for the terminal maneuver, we will decide whetheryou should rendezvous with this remarkable object.\"Japetus is unique in the Solar System - you know this already, of course, butlike all the astronomers of the last three hundred years, you've probably givenit little thought. So let me remind you that Cassini - who discovered Japetus in1671 - also observed that it was six times brighter on one side of its orbitthan the other.\"This is an extraordinary ratio, and there has never been a satisfactoryexplanation for it. Japetus is so small - about eight hundred miles in diameter- that even in the lunar telescopes its disk is barely visible. But there seemsto be a brilliant, curiously symmetrical spot on one face, and this may beconnected with TMA-1. I sometimes think that Japetus has been flashing at uslike a cosmic heliograph for three hundred years, and we've been too stupid tounderstand its message.\"So now you know your real objective, and can appreciate the vital importance ofthis mission. We are all praying that you can still provide us with some factsfor a preliminary announcement; the secret cannot be kept indefinitely.\"At the moment, we do not know whether to hope or fear. We do not know if, outon the moons of Saturn, you will meet with good or with evil - or only withruins a thousand times older than Troy.\"V - THE MOONS OF SATURN31-SurvivalWork is the best remedy for any shock, and Bowman now had work enough for allhis lost crewmates. As swiftly as possible, starting with the vital systemswithout which he and the ship would die, he had to get Discovery fullyoperational again.Life support was the first priority. Much oxygen had been lost, but the reserveswere still ample to sustain a single man. The pressure and temperatureregulation was largely automatic, and there had seldom been need for Hal tointerfere with it. The monitors on Earth could now carry out many of the higherduties of the slain computer, despite the long time lag before they could reactto changing situations. Any trouble in the life-support system - short of aserious puncture in the hull - would take hours to make itself apparent; therewould be plenty of warning.The ship's power, navigation, and propulsion systems were unaffected - but thelast two, in any event, Bowman would not need for months, until it was time torendezvous with Saturn. Even at long range, without the help of an onboardcomputer, Earth could still supervise this operation. The final orbitadjustments would be somewhat tedious, because of the constant need forchecking, but this was no serious problem.By far the worst job had been emptying the spinning coffins in the centrifuge.It was well, Bowman thought thankfully, that the members of the survey team hadbeen colleagues, but not intimate friends. They had trained together for only afew weeks; looking back on it, he now realized that even this had been largely acompatibility test.When he had finally sealed the empty hibernacula, he felt rather like anEgyptian tomb robber. Now Kaminski, Whitehead, and Hunter would all reach Saturnbefore him - but not before Frank Poole. Somehow, he derived a strange, wrysatisfaction from this thought.He did not attempt to find if the rest of the hibernation system was still inworking order. Though his life might ultimately depend upon it, this was aproblem that could wait until the ship had entered its final orbit. Many thingsmight happen before then.It was even possible - though he had not yet looked into the supply positioncarefully - that by rigorous rationing he might remain alive, without resort tohibernation, until rescue came. But whether he could survive psychologically aswell as physically was quite another matter.He tried to avoid thinking about such long-range problems, and to concentrate onimmediate essentials. Slowly, he cleaned up the ship, checked that its systemswere still running smoothly, discussed technical difficulties with Earth, andoperated on the minimum of sleep. Only at intervals, during the first weeks, washe able to give much thought to the great mystery toward which he was nowinexorably racing - though it was never very far from his mind.At last, as the ship slowly settled down once more into an automatic routine- though one that still demanded his constant supervision - Bowman had time tostudy the reports and briefings sent to him from Earth. Again and again heplayed back the recording made when TMA-1 greeted the dawn for the first time inthree million years. He watched the spacesuited figures moving around it, andalmost smiled at their ludicrous panic when it blasted its signal at the stars,paralyzing their radios with the sheer power of its electronic voice.Since that moment, the black slab had done nothing. It had been covered up, thencautiously exposed to the Sun again - without any reaction. No attempt had beenmade to cut into it, partly through scientific caution, but equally through fearof the possible consequences.The magnetic field that led to its discovery had vanished at the moment of thatradio shriek. Perhaps, some experts theorized, it had been generated by atremendous circulating current, flowing in a superconductor and thus carryingenergy down the ages until it was needed. That the monolith had some internalsource of power seemed certain; the solar energy it had absorbed during itsbrief exposure could not account for the strength of its signal.One curious, and perhaps quite unimportant, feature of the block had led toendless argument The monolith was 11 feet high, and 11/4 by 5 feet incrosssection. When its dimensions were checked with great care, they were foundto be in the exact ratio 1 to 4 to 9 - the squares of the first three integers.No one could suggest any plausible explanation for this, but it could hardly bea coincidence, for the proportions held to the limits of measurable accuracy. Itwas a chastening thought that the entire technology of Earth could not shapeeven an inert block, of any material, with such a fantastic degree of precision.In its way, this passive yet almost arrogant display of geometrical perfectionwas as impressive as any of TMA-l's other attributes.Bowman also listened, with a curiously detached interest, to Mission Control'sbelated apologia for its programming. The voices from Earth seemed to have adefensive note; be could imagine the recriminations that must now be in progressamong those who had planned the expedition.They had some good arguments, of course - including the results of a secretDepartment of Defense study, Project BARSOOM, which had been carried out byHarvard's School of Psychology in 1989. In this experiment in controlledsociology, various sample populations had been assured that the human race hadmade contact with extraterrestrials. Many of the subjects tested were - with thehelp of drugs, hypnosis, and visual effects - under the impression that they hadactually met creatures from other planets, so their reactions were regarded asauthentic.Some of these reactions had been quite violent; there was, it seemed, a deepvein of xenophobia in many otherwise normal human beings. In view of mankind'srecord of lynchings, pogroms, and similar pleasantries, this should havesurprised no one; nevertheless, the organizers of the study had been deeplydisturbed, and the results had never been released. The five separate panicscaused in the twentieth century by radio broadcasts of H.G. Wells's War of theWorlds also reinforced the study's conclusions.Despite these arguments, Bowman sometimes wondered if the cultural shock dangerwas the only explanation for the mission's extreme secrecy. Some hints that hadbeen dropped during his briefings suggested that the U.S.-U.S.S.R. bloc hoped toderive advantage by being the first to contact intelligent extraterrestrials.From his present viewpoint, looking back on Earth as a dim star almost lost inthe Sun, such considerations now seemed ludicrously parochial.He was rather more interested - even though this was now very much water underthe bridge - in the theory put forward to account for Hal's behavior. No onewould ever be sure of the truth, but the fact that one of the Mission Control9000s had been driven into an identical psychosis, and was now under deeptherapy, suggested that the explanation was the correct one. The same mistakewould not be made again; and the fact that Hal's builders had failed fully tounderstand the psychology of their own creation showed how difficult it might beto establish communication with truly alien beings.Bowman could easily believe Dr. Simonson's theory that unconscious feelings ofguilt, caused by his program conflicts, had made Hal attempt to break thecircuit with Earth. And he liked to think - though this again was something thatcould never be proved - that Hal had no intention of killing Poole. He hadmerely tried to destroy the evidence; for once the AE-35 unit reported as burnedout was proved to be operational, his lie would be revealed. After that, likeany clumsy criminal caught in a thickening web of deception, he had panicked.And panic was something that Bowman understood better than he had any wish to,for he had known it twice during his life. The first time was as a boy, when hebad been caught in a line of surf and nearly drowned; the second was as aspaceman under training, when a faulty gauge had convinced him that his oxygenwould be exhausted before he could reach safety.On both occasions, he had almost lost control of all his higher logicalprocesses; he had been within seconds of becoming a frenzied bundle of randomimpulses. Both times he had won through, but he knew well enough that any man,in the right circumstances, could be dehumanized by panic.If it could happen to a man, then it could happen to Hal; and with thatknowledge the bitterness and the sense of betrayal he felt toward the computerbegan to fade. Now, in any event, it belonged to a past that was whollyovershadowed by the threat, and the promise, of the unknown future.32 - Concerning E.T.'sApart from hasty meals back in the carrousel - luckily the main food dispensershad not been damaged - Bowman practically lived on the control deck. Hecatnapped in his seat, and so could spot any trouble as soon as the first signsof it appeared on the display. Under instructions from Mission Control, he hadjury-rigged several emergency systems, which were working tolerably well. Iteven seemed possible that he would survive until the Discovery reached Saturn -which, of course, she would do whether he was alive or not.Though he had little enough time for sightseeing, and the sky of space was nonovelty to him, the knowledge of what now lay out there beyond the observationports sometimes made it difficult for him to concentrate even on the problem ofsurvival. Dead ahead, as the ship was now oriented, sprawled the Milky Way, withits clouds of stars so tightly packed that they numbed the mind. There were thefiery mists of Sagittarius, those seething swarms of suns that forever hid theheart of the galaxy from human vision. There was the ominous black shadow of theCoal Sack, that hole in space where no stars shone. And there was AlphaCentauri, nearest of all alien suns - the first stop beyond the Solar System.Although outshone by Sirius and Canopus, it was Alpha Centauri that drewBowman's eyes and mind whenever he looked out into space. For that unwaveringpoint of brightness, whose rays had taken four years to reach him, had come tosymbolize the secret debates that now raged on Earth, and whose echoes came tohim from time to time.No one doubted that there must be some connection between TMA-1 and theSaturnian system, but hardly any scientists would admit that the creatures whohad erected the monolith could possibly have originated there. As an abode oflife, Saturn was even more hostile than Jupiter, and its many moons were frozenin an eternal winter three hundred degrees below zero. Only one of them - Titan- possessed an atmosphere; and that was a thin envelope of poisonous methane.So perhaps the creatures who had visited Earth's Moon so long ago were notmerely extraterrestrial, but extrasolar - visitors from the stars, who hadestablished their bases wherever it suited them. And this at once raised anotherproblem: could any technology, no matter how advanced, bridge the awful gulfthat lay between the Solar System and the nearest alien sun?Many scientists flatly denied the possibility. They pointed out that Discovery,the fastest ship ever designed, would take twenty thousand years to reach AlphaCentauri - and millions of years to travel any appreciable distance across thegalaxy. Even if, during the centuries to come, propulsion systems improved outof all recognition, in the end they would meet the impassable barrier of thespeed of light, which no material object could exceed. Therefore, the buildersof TMA-1 must have shared the same sun as man; and since they had made noappearance in historic times, they were probably extinct.A vocal minority refused to agree. Even if it took centuries to travel from starto star, they contended, this might be no obstacle to sufficiently determinedexplorers. The technique of hibernation, used on Discovery herself, was onepossible answer. Another was the self-contained artificial world, embarking onvoyages that might last for many generations.In any event, why should one assume that all intelligent species were asshort-lived as Man? There might be creatures in the universe to whom athousandyear voyage would present nothing worse than slight boredom...These arguments, theoretical though they were, concerned a matter of the utmostpractical importance; they involved the concept of \"reaction time.\" If TMA-1 hadindeed sent a signal to the stars - perhaps with the help of some further devicenear Saturn - then it would not reach its destination for years. Even if theresponse was immediate, therefore, humanity would have a breathing space whichcould certainly be measured in decades - more probably in centuries. To manypeople, this was a reassuring thought.But not to all. A few scientists - most of them beachcombers on the wildershores of theoretical physics - asked the disturbing question: \"Are we certainthat the speed of light is an unbreakable barrier?\" It was true that the SpecialTheory of Relativity had proved to be remarkably durable, and would soon beapproaching its first centenary; but it had begun to show a few cracks. And evenif Einstein could not be defied, he might be evaded.Those who sponsored this view talked hopefully about shortcuts through higherdimensions, lines that were straighter than straight, and hyperspacialconnectivity. They were fond of using an expressive phrase coined by a Princetonmathematician of the last century: \"Wormholes in space.\" Critics who suggestedthat these ideas were too fantastic to be taken seriously were reminded of NielsBohr's \"Your theory is crazy - but not crazy enough to be true.\"If there was disputation among the physicists, it was nothing compared with thatamong the biologists, when they discussed the hoary old problem: \"What wouldintelligent extraterrestrials look like?\" They divided themselves into twoopposing camps - one arguing that such creatures must be humanoid, the otherequally convinced that \"they\" would look nothing like men.Settling for the first answer were those who believed that the design of twolegs, two arms, and main sense organs at the highest point, was so basic and sosensible that it was hard to think of a better one. Of course, there would beminor differences like six fingers instead of five, oddly colored skin or hair,and peculiar facial arrangements; but most intelligent extraterrestrials -usually abbreviated to E.T.'s - would be so similar to Man that they might notbe glanced at twice in poor lighting, or from a distance.This anthropomorphic thinking was ridiculed by another group of biologists, trueproducts of the Space Age who felt themselves free from the prejudices of thepast. They pointed out that the human body was the result of millions ofevolutionary choices, made by chance over eons of time. At any one of thesecountless moments of decision, the genetic dice might have fallen differently,perhaps with better results. For the human body was a bizarre piece ofimprovisation, full of organs that had been diverted from one function toanother, not always very successfully - and even containing discarded items,like the appendix, that were now worse than useless.There were other thinkers, Bowman also found, who held even more exotic views.They did not believe that really advanced beings would possess organic bodies atall. Sooner or later, as their scientific knowledge progressed, they would getrid of the fragile, disease-and-accident-prone homes that Nature had given them,and which doomed them to inevitable death. They would replace their naturalbodies as they wore out - or perhaps even before that - by constructions ofmetal and plastic, and would thus achieve immortality. The brain might lingerfor a little while as the last remnant of the organic body, directing itsmechanical limbs and observing the universe through its electronic senses -senses far finer and subtler than those that blind evolution could ever develop.Even on Earth, the first steps in this direction had been taken. There weremillions of men, doomed in earlier ages, who now lived active and happy livesthanks to artificial limbs, kidneys, lungs, and hearts. To this process therecould be only one conclusion - however far off it might be.And eventually even the brain might go. As the seat of consciousness, It was notessential; the development of electronic intelligence had proved that. Theconflict between mind and machine might be resolved at last in the eternal truceof complete symbiosis.But was even this the end? A few mystically inclined biologists went stillfurther. They speculated, taking their cues from the beliefs of many religions,that mind would eventually free itself from matter. The robot body, like theflesh-and-blood one, would be no more than a stepping-stone to something which,long ago, men bad called \"spirit.\"And if there was anything beyond that, its name could only be God.33 - AmbassadorDuring the last three months, David Bowman had adapted himself so completely tohis solitary way of life that he found it hard to remember any other existence.He had passed beyond despair and beyond hope, and had settled down to a largelyautomatic routine, punctuated by occasional crises as one or other ofDiscovery's systems showed signs of malfunctioning.But he had not passed beyond curiosity, and sometimes the thought of the goaltoward which he was driving filled him with a sense of exaltation - and afeeling of power. Not only was he the representative of the entire human race,but his actions during the next few weeks might determine its very future. Inthe whole of history, there had never been a situation quite like this. He wasan Ambassador Extraordinary - Plenipotentiary - for all mankind.That knowledge helped him in many subtle ways. He kept himself neat and tidy; nomatter how tired he became, he never skipped a shave. Mission Control, he knew,was watching him closely for the first signs of any abnormal behavior; he wasdetermined that it should watch in vain - at least, for any serious symptoms.Bowman was aware of some changes in his behavior patterns; it would have beenabsurd to expect anything else in the circumstances. He could no longer toleratesilence; except when he was sleeping, or talking over the circuit to Earth, hekept the ship's sound system running at almost painful loudness.At first, needing the companionship of the human voice, he had listened toclassical plays - especially the works of Shaw, Ibsen, and Shakespeare - orpoetry readings from Discovery's enormous library of recorded sounds. Theproblems they dealt with, however, seemed so remote, or so easily resolved witha little common sense, that after a while he lost patience with them.So he switched to opera - usually in Italian or German, so that he was notdistracted even by the minimal intellectual content that most operas contained.This phase lasted for two weeks before he realized that the sound of all thesesuperbly trained voices was only exacerbating his loneliness. But what finallyended this cycle was Verdi's Requiem Mass, which he had never heard performed onEarth. The \"Dies Irae,\" roaring with ominous appropriateness through the emptyship, left him completely shattered; and when the trumpets of Doomsday echoedfrom the heavens, he could endure no more.Thereafter, he played only instrumental music. He started with the romanticcomposers, but shed them one by one as their emotional outpourings became toooppressive. Sibelius, Tchaikovsky, Berlioz, lasted a few weeks, Beethoven ratherlonger. He finally found peace, as so many others had done, in the abstractarchitecture of Bach, occasionally ornamented with Mozart.And so Discovery drove on toward Saturn, as often as not pulsating with the coolmusic of the harpsichord, the frozen thoughts of a brain that had been dust fortwice a hundred years.Even from its present ten million miles, Saturn already appeared larger than theMoon as seen from Earth. To the naked eye it was a glorious spectacle; throughthe telescope, it was unbelievable.The body of the planet might have been mistaken for Jupiter in one of hisquieter moods. There were the same bands of cloud - though paler and lessdistinct than on that slightly larger world - and the same continent-sizeddisturbances moving slowly across the atmosphere. However, there was onestriking difference between the two planets; even at a glance, it was obviousthat Saturn was not spherical. It was so flattened at the poles that itsometimes gave the impression of slight deformity.But the glory of the rings continually drew Bowman's eye away from the planet;in their complexity of detail, and delicacy of shading, they were a universe inthemselves. In addition to the great main gap between the inner and outer rings,there were at least fifty other subdivisions or boundaries, where there weredistinct changes in the brightness of the planet's gigantic halo. It was as ifSaturn was surrounded by scores of concentric hoops, all touching each other,all so flat that they might have been cut from the thinnest possible paper. Thesystem of the rings looked like some delicate work of art, or a fragile toy tobe admired but never touched. By no effort of the will could Bowman reallyappreciate its true scale, and convince himself that the whole planet Earth, ifset down here, would look like a ball bearing rolling round the rim of a dinnerplate.Sometimes a star would drift behind the rings, losing only a little of itsbrilliancy as it did so. It would continue to shine through their translucentmaterial - though often it would twinkle slightly as some larger fragment oforbiting debris eclipsed it.For the rings, as had been known since the nineteenth century, were not solid:that was a mechanical impossibility. They consisted of countless myriads offragments - perhaps the remains of a moon that had come too close and had beentorn to pieces by the great planet's tidal pull. Whatever their origin, thehuman race was fortunate to have seen such a wonder; it could exist for only abrief moment of time in the history of the Solar System.As long ago as 1945, a British astronomer had pointed out that the rings wereephemeral; gravitational forces were at work which would soon destroy them.Taking this argument backward in time, it therefore followed that they had beencreated only recently - a mere two or three million years ago.But no one had ever given the slightest thought to the curious coincidence thatthe rings of Saturn had been born at the same time as the human race.34 - The Orbiting IceDiscovery was now deep into the wide-ranging system of moons, and the greatplanet itself was less than a day ahead. The ship had long since passed theboundary set by outermost Phoebe, moving backward in a wildly eccentric orbiteight million miles from its primary. Ahead of it now lay Japetus, Hyperion,Titan, Rhea, Dione, Tethys, Enceladus, Mimas, Janus - and the rings themselves.All the satellites showed a maze of surface detail in the telescope, and Bowmanhad relayed back to Earth as many photographs as he could take. Titan alone -three thousand miles in diameter, and as large as the planet Mercury - wouldoccupy a survey team for months; he could give it, and all its cold companions,only the briefest of glances. There was no need for more; already he was quitecertain that Japetus was indeed his goal.All the other satellites were pitted by occasional meteor craters - though thesewere much fewer than on Mars - and showed apparently random patterns of lightand shade, with here and there a few bright spots that were probably patches offrozen gas. Japetus alone possessed a distinctive geography, and a very strangeone indeed.One hemisphere of the satellite, which, like its companions, turned the sameface always toward Saturn, was extremely dark, and showed very little surfacedetail. In complete contrast, the other was dominated by a brilliant white oval,about four hundred miles long and two hundred wide. At the moment, only part ofthis striking formation was in daylight, but the reason for Japetus'sextraordinary variations in brilliance was now quite obvious. On the westernside of the moon's orbit, the bright ellipse was presented toward the Sun - andthe Earth. On the eastern phase, the patch was turned away, and only the poorlyreflecting hemisphere could be observed.The great ellipse was perfectly symmetrical, straddling the equator of Japetuswith its major axis pointing toward the poles; and it was so sharp-edged that italmost looked as if someone had carefully painted a huge white oval on the faceof the little moon. It was completely flat, and Bowman wondered if it could be alake of frozen liquid - though that would hardly account for its startlinglyartificial appearance.But he had little time to study Japetus on his way into the heart of theSaturnian system, for the climax of the voyage - Discovery's last perturbationmaneuver - was rapidly approaching. In the Jupiter fly-by, the ship had used thegravitational field of the planet to increase her velocity. Now she must do thereverse; she had to lose as much speed as possible, lest she escape from theSolar System and fly on to the stars. Her present course was one designed totrap her, so that she would become another moon of Saturn, shuttling back andforth along a narrow, two-million-mile-long ellipse. At its near point it wouldalmost graze the planet; at its far one, it would touch the orbit of Japetus.The computers back on Earth, though their information was always three hourslate, had assured Bowman that everything was in order. Velocity and altitudewere correct; there was nothing more to be done, until the moment of closestapproach.The immense system of rings now spanned the sky, and already the ship waspassing over its outermost edge. As he looked down upon them from a height ofsome ten thousand miles, Bowman could see through the telescope that the ringswere made largely of ice, glittering and scintillating in the light of the Sun.He might have been flying over a snowstorm that occasionally cleared to reveal,where the ground should have been, baffling glimpses of night and stars.As Discovery curved still closer toward Saturn, the Sun slowly descended towardthe multiple arches of the rings. Now they had become a slim, silver bridgespanning the entire sky; though they were too tenuous to do more than dim thesunlight, their myriads of crystals refracted and scattered it in dazzlingpyrotechnics. And as the Sun moved behind the thousand-mile-wide drifts oforbiting ice, pale ghosts of itself marched and merged across the sky, and theheavens were filled with shifting flares and flashes. Then the Sun sank belowthe rings, so that they framed it with their arches, and the celestial fireworksceased.A little later, the ship curved into the shadow of Saturn, as it made itsclosest approach over the night side of the planet. Above shone the stars andthe rings; below lay a dimly visible sea of clouds. There were none of themysterious patterns of luminosity that had glowed in the Jovian night; perhapsSaturn was too cold for such displays. The mottled cloudscape was revealed onlyby the ghostly radiance reflected back from the circling icebergs, stillilluminated by the hidden Sun.But in the center of the arch there was a wide, dark gap, like the missing spanof an uncompleted bridge, where the shadow of the planet lay across its rings.Radio contact with Earth had been broken, and could not be resumed until theship emerged from the eclipsing bulk of Saturn. It was perhaps as well thatBowman was too busy now to think of his suddenly enhanced loneliness; for thenext few hours, every second would be occupied as he checked the brakingmaneuvers, already programmed by the computers on Earth.After their months of idleness, the main thrusters began to blast out theirmiles-long cataracts of glowing plasma. Gravity returned, though briefly, to theweightless world of the control deck. And hundreds of miles below, the clouds ofmethane and frozen ammonia blazed with a light that they had never known before,as Discovery swept, a fierce and tiny sun, through the Saturnian night.At last, the pale dawn lay ahead; the ship, moving more and more slowly now, wasemerging into day. It could no longer escape from the Sun, or even from Saturn -but it was still moving swiftly enough to rise away from the planet until itgrazed the orbit of Japetus, two million miles out.It would take Discovery fourteen days to make that climb, as she coasted oncemore, though in reverse order, across the paths of all the inner moons. One byone she would cut through the orbits of Janus, Mimas, Enceladus, Tethys, Dione,Rhea, Titan, Hyperion - worlds bearing the names of gods and goddesses who hadvanished only yesterday, as time was counted here.Then she would meet Japetus, and must make her rendezvous. If she failed, shewould fall back toward Saturn and repeat her twenty-eight-day ellipseindefinitely.There would be no chance for a second rendezvous if Discovery missed on thisattempt. The next time around, Japetus would be far away, almost on the otherside of Saturn.It was true that they would meet again, when the orbits of ship and satellitemeshed for a second time. But that appointment was so many years ahead that,whatever happened, Bowman knew he would not witness it.35 - The Eye of JapetusWhen Bowman had first observed Japetus, that curious elliptical patch, ofbrilliance had been partly in shadow, illuminated only by the light of Saturn.Now, as the Moon moved slowly along its seventy-nine-day orbit, it was emerginginto the full light of day.As he watched it grow, and Discovery rose more and more sluggishly toward herinevitable appointment, Bowman became aware of a disturbing obsession. He nevermentioned it in his conversations - or, rather, his running commentaries - withMission Control, because it might have seemed that he was already suffering fromdelusions.Perhaps, indeed, he was; for he had half convinced himself that the brightellipse set against the dark background of the satellite was a huge, empty eye,staring at him as he approached. It was an eye without a pupil, for nowherecould he see anything to mar its perfect blankness.Not until the ship was only fifty thousand miles out, and Japetus was twice aslarge as Earth's familiar Moon, did he notice the tiny black dot at the exactcenter of the ellipse. But there was no time, then, for any detailedexamination; the terminal maneuvers were already upon him.For the last time, Discovery's main drive released its energies. For the lasttime, the incandescent fury of dying atoms blazed among the moons of Saturn. ToDavid Bowman, the far-off whisper and rising thrust of the jets brought a senseof pride - and of sadness. The superb engines had done their duty with flawlessefficiency. They had brought the ship from Earth to Jupiter to Saturn; now thiswas the very last time that they would ever operate. When Discovery had emptiedher propellant tanks, she would be as helpless and inert as any comet orasteroid, a powerless prisoner of gravitation. Even when the rescue ship arriveda few years hence, it would not be an economical proposition to refuel her, sothat she could fight her way back to Earth. She would be an eternally orbitingmonument to the early days of planetary exploration.The thousands of miles shrank to hundreds, and as they did so, the fuel gaugesdropped swiftly toward zero. At the control panel, Bowman's eyes flickeredanxiously back and forth over the situation display, and the improvised chartswhich he now had to consult for any real-time decisions. It would be anappalling anticlimax if, having survived so much, he failed to make rendezvousthrough lack of a few pounds of fuel.The whistle of the jets faded, as the main thrust died and only the vernierscontinued to nudge Discovery gently into orbit. Japetus was now a giant crescentthat filled the sky; until this moment, Bowman had always thought of it as atiny, insignificant object - as indeed it was compared with the world aroundwhich it circled. Now, as it loomed menacingly above him, it seemed enormous - acosmic hammer poised to crush Discovery like a nutshell.Japetus was approaching so slowly that it scarcely seemed to move, and it wasimpossible to tell the exact moment when it made the subtle change from anastronomical body to a landscape, only fifty miles below. The faithful verniersgave their last spurts of thrust, then closed down forever. The ship was in itsfinal orbit, completing one revolution every three hours at a mere eight hundredmiles an hour - all the speed that was required in this feeble gravitationalfield.Discovery has become a satellite of a satellite.36 - Big Brother\"I'm coming round to the daylight side again, and it's just as I reported on thelast orbit. This place seems to have only two kinds of surface material. Theblack stuff looks burned, almost like charcoal, and with the same kind oftexture as far as I can judge in the telescope. In fact, it reminds me very muchof burned toast.\"I still can't make any sense of the white area. It starts at an absolutelysharp-edged boundary, and shows no surface detail at all. It could even be aliquid - it's flat enough. I don't know what impression you've got from thevideos I've transmitted, but if you picture a sea of frozen milk you'll get theidea exactly.\"It could even be some heavy gas - no, I suppose that's impossible. Sometimes Iget the feeling that it's moving, very slowly: but I can never be sure.I'm over the white area again, on my third orbit. This time I hope to passcloser to that mark I spotted at its very center, when I was on my way in.If my calculations are correct, I should go within fifty miles of it - whateverit is.Yes, there's something ahead, just where I calculated. It's coming up over thehorizon - and so is Saturn, in almost the same quarter of the sky - I'll move tothe telescope...\"Hello! It looks like some kind of building - complefely black - quite hard tosee. No windows or any other features. Just a big, vertical slab - it must be atleast a mile high to be visible from this distance. It reminds me - of course!It's just like the thing you found on the Moon! This is TMA-l's big brother!\"37 - ExperimentCall it the Star Crate.For three million years, it had circled Saturn, waiting for a moment of destinythat might never come. In its making, a moon had been shattered, and the debrisof its creation orbited still.Now the long wait was ending. On yet another world, intelligence had been bornand was escaping from its planetary cradle. An ancient experiment was about toreach its climax.Those who had begun that experiment, so long ago, had not been men - or evenremotely human. But they were flesh and blood, and when they looked out acrossthe deeps of space, they bad felt awe, and wonder, and loneliness. As soon asthey possessed the power, they set forth for the stars.In their explorations, they encountered life in many forms, and watched theworkings of evolution on a thousand worlds. They saw how often the first faintsparks of intelligence flickered and died in the cosmic night.And because, in all the galaxy, they had found nothing more precious than Mind,they encouraged its dawning everywhere. They became farmers in the fields ofstars; they sowed, and sometimes they reaped.And sometimes, dispassionately, they had to weed.The great dinosaurs had long since perished when the survey ship entered theSolar System after a voyage that had already lasted a thousand years. It sweptpast the frozen outer planets, paused briefly above the deserts of dying Mars,and presently looked down on Earth.Spread out beneath them, the explorers saw a world swarming with life. For yearsthey studied, collected, catalogued. When they had learned all that they could,they began to modify. They tinkered with the destiny of many species, on landand in the ocean. But which of their experiments would succeed they could notknow for at least a million years.They were patient, but they were not yet immortal. There was so much to do inthis universe of a hundred billion suns, and other worlds were calling. So theyset out once more into the abyss, knowing that they would never come this wayagain.Nor was there any need. The servants they had left behind would do the rest.On Earth, the glaciers came and went, while above them the changeless Moon stillcarried its secret. With a yet slower rhythm than the polar ice, the tides ofcivilization ebbed and flowed across the galaxy. Strange and beautiful andterrible empires rose and fell, and passed on their knowledge to theirsuccessors. Earth was not forgotten, but another visit would serve littlepurpose. It was one of a million silent worlds, few of which would ever speak.And now, out among the stars, evolution was driving toward new goals. The firstexplorers of Earth had long since come to the limits of flesh and blood; as soonas their machines were better than their bodies, it was time to move. Firsttheir brains, and then their thoughts alone, they transferred into shining newhomes of metal and of plastic.In these, they roamed among the stars. They no longer built spaceships. Theywere spaceships.But the age of the Machine-entities swiftly passed. In their ceaselessexperimenting, they had learned to store knowledge in the structure of spaceitself, and to preserve their thoughts for eternity in frozen lattices of light.They could become creatures of radiation, free at last from the tyranny ofmatter.Into pure energy, therefore, they presently transformed themselves; and on athousand worlds, the empty shells they had discarded twitched for a while in amindless dance of death, then crumbled into rustyNow they were lords of the galaxy, and beyond the reach of time. They could roveat will among the stars, and sink like a subtle mist through the veryinterstices of space. But despite their godlike powers, they had not whollyforgotten their origin, in the warm slime of a vanished sea.And they still watched over the experiments their ancestors had started, so longago.38 - The Sentinel\"The air in the ship is getting quite foul, and I have a headache most of thetime. There's still plenty of oxygen, but the purifiers never really cleaned upall the messes after the liquids aboard started boiling into vacuum. When thingsget too bad, I go down into the garage and bleed off some pure oxygen from thepods.\"There's been no reaction to any of my signals, and because of my orbitalinclination, I'm getting slowly farther and farther away from TMA-2.Incidentally, the name you've given it is doubly inappropriate - there's stillno trace of a magnetic field.\"At the moment my closest approach is sixty miles; it will increase to about ahundred as Japetus rotates beneath me, then drop back to zero. I'll passdirectly over the thing in thirty days - but that's too long to wait, and thenit will be in darkness, anyway.\"Even now, it's only in sight for a few minutes before it falls below thehorizon again. It's damn frustrating - I can't make any serious observations.\"So I'd like your approval of this plan. The space pods have ample delta vee fora touchdown and a return to the ship. I want to go extravehicular and make aclose survey of the object. If it appears safe, I'll land beside it - or even ontop of it.\"The ship will still be above my horizon while I'm going down, so I won't be outof touch for more than ninety minutes.'Tm convinced that this is the only thing to do. I've come a billion miles - Idon't want to be stopped by the last sixty.\"For weeks, as it stared forever Sunward with its strange senses, the Star Gatehad watched the approaching ship. Its makers had prepared it for many things,and this was one of them. It recognized what was climbing up toward it from thewarm heart of the Solar System.If it had been alive, it would have felt excitement, but such an emotion waswholly beyond its powers. Even if the ship had passed it by, it would not haveknown the slightest trace of disappointment. It had waited three million years;it was prepared to wait for eternity.It observed, and noted, and took no action, as the visitor checked its speedwith jets of incandescent gas. Presently it felt the gentle touch of radiations,trying to probe its secrets. And still it did nothing.Now the ship was in orbit, circling low above the surface of this strangelypiebald moon. It began to speak, with blasts of radio waves, counting out theprime numbers from 1 to 11, over and over again. Soon these gave way to morecomplex signals, at many frequencies-ultraviolet, infrared, X rays. The StarGate made no reply; it had nothing to say.There was a long pause, then, before it observed that something was falling downtoward it from the orbiting ship. It searched its memories, and the logiccircuits made their decisions, according to the orders given them long ago.Beneath the cold light of Saturn, the Star Gate awakened its slumbering powers.39 - Into the EyeDiscovery looked just as he had last seen her from space, floating in lunarorbit with the Moon taking up half the sky. Perhaps there was one slight change;be could not be sure, but some of the paint of her external lettering,announcing the purpose of various hatches, connections, umbilical plugs, andother attachment, had faded during its long exposure to the unshielded Sun.That Sun was now an object that no man would have recognized. It was far toobright to be a star, but one could look directly at its tiny disk withoutdiscomfort. It gave no heat at all; when Bowman held his ungloved hands in itsrays, as they streamed through the space pod's window, he could feel nothingupon his skin. He might have been trying to warm himself by the light of theMoon; not even the alien landscape fifty miles below reminded him more vividlyof his remoteness from Earth.Now he was leaving, perhaps for the last time, the metal world that had been hishome for so many months. Even if he never returned, the ship would continue toperform its duty, broadcasting instrument readings back to Earth until there wassome final, catastrophic failure in its circuits.And if he did return? Well, he could keep alive, and perhaps even sane, for afew more months. But that was all, for the hibernation systems were useless withno computer to monitor them. He could not possibly survive until Discovery IImade its rendezvous with Japetus, four or five years hence.He put these thoughts behind him, as the golden crescent of Saturn rose in thesky ahead. In all history, he was the only man to have seen this sight. To allother eyes, Saturn had always shown its whole illuminated disk turned fulltoward the Sun. Now it was a delicate bow, with the rings forming a thin lineacross it - like an arrow about to be loosed, into the face of the Sun itself.Also in the line of the rings was the bright star of Titan, and the faintersparks of the other moons. Before this century was half gone, men would havevisited them all; but whatever secrets they might hold, he would never know.The sharp-edged boundary of the blind white eye was sweeping toward him; therewas only a hundred miles to go, and he would be over his target in less than tenminutes. He wished that there was some way of telling if his words were reachingEarth, now an hour and a half away at the speed of light. It would be theultimate irony if, through some breakdown in the relay system, he disappearedinto silence, and no one ever knew what had happened to him.Discovery was still a brilliant star in the black sky far above. He was pullingahead as he gained speed during his descent, but soon the pod's braking jetswould slow him down and the ship would sail on out of sight - leaving him aloneon this shining plain with the dark mystery at its center.A block of ebony was climbing above the horizon, eclipsing the stars ahead. Herolled the pod around its gyros, and used full thrust to break his orbitalspeed. In a long, flat arc, he descended toward the surface of Japetus.On a world of higher gravity, the maneuver would have been far too extravagantof fuel. But here the space pod weighed only a score of pounds; he had severalminutes of hovering time before he would cut dangerously into his reserve and bestranded without any hope of return to the still orbiting Discovery. Not,perhaps, that it made much difference...His altitude was still about five miles, and he was heading straight toward thehuge, dark mass that soared in such geometrical perfection above the featurelessplain. It was as blank as the flat white surface beneath; until now, he had notappreciated how enormous it really was. There were very few single buildings onEarth as large as this; his carefully measured photographs indicated a height ofalmost two thousand feet. And as far as could be judged, its proportions wereprecisely the same as TMA-l's - that curious ratio 1 to 4to 9.\"I'm only three miles away now, holding altitude at four thousand feet. Stillnot a sign of activity - nothing on any of the instruments. The faces seemabsolutely smooth and polished. Surely you'd expect some meteorite damage afterall this time!\"And there's no debris on the - I suppose one could call it the roof. No sign ofany opening, either. I'd been hoping there might be some way in.\"Now I'm right above it, hovering five hundred feet up. I don't want to wasteany time, since Discovery will soon be out of range. I'm going to land. It'scertainly solid enough - and if it isn't I'll blast off at once.\"Just a minute - that's odd -\"Bowman's voice died into the silence of utter bewilderment. He was not alarmed;he literally could not describe what he was seeing.He had been hanging above a large, flat rectangle, eight hundred feet long andtwo hundred wide, made of something that looked as solid as rock. But now itseemed to be receding from him; it was exactly like one of those opticalillusions, when a three-dimensional object can, by an effort of will, appear toturn inside out - its near and far sides suddenly interchanging.That was happening to this huge, apparently solid structure. Impossibly,incredibly, it was no longer a monolith rearing high above a flat plain. Whathad seemed to be its roof had dropped away to infinite depths; for one dizzymoment, he seemed to be looking down into a vertical shaft - a rectangular ductwhich defied the laws of perspective, for its size did not decrease withdistance...The Eye of Japetus had blinked, as if to remove an irritating speck of dust.David Bowman had time for just one broken sentence which the waiting men inMission Control, nine hundred million miles away and eighty minutes in thefuture, were never to forget:\"The thing's hollow - it goes on forever - and - oh my God! - it's full ofstars!\"40 - ExitThe Star Gate opened. The Star Gate closed.In a moment of time too short to be measured, Space turned and twisted uponitself.Then Japetus was alone once more, as it had been for three million years -alone, except for a deserted but not yet derelict ship, sending back to itsmakers messages which they could neither believe nor understand.VI - THROUGH THE STARGATE41 - Grand CentralThere was no sense of motion, but he was falling toward those impossible stars,shining there in the dark heart of a moon. No - that was not where they reallywere, he felt certain. He wished, now that it was far too late, that he had paidmore attention to those theories of hyperspace, of transdimensional ducts. ToDavid Bowman, they were theories no longer.Perhaps that monolith on Japetus was hollow; perhaps the \"roof\" was only anillusion, or some kind of diaphragm that had opened to let him through. (Butinto what?) As far as he could trust his senses, he appeared to be droppingvertically down a huge rectangular shaft, several thousand feet deep. He wasmoving faster and faster - but the far end never changed its size, and remainedalways at the same distance from him.Only the stars moved, at first so slowly that it was some time before herealized that they were escaping out of the frame that held them. But in alittle while it was obvious that the star field was expanding, as if it wasrushing toward him at an inconceivable speed.The expansion was nonlinear; the stars at the center hardly seemed to move,while those toward the edge accelerated more and more swiftly, until they becamestreaks of light just before they vanished from view.There were always others to replace them, flowing into the center of the fieldfrom an apparently inexhaustible source. Bowman wondered what would happen if astar came straight toward him; would it continue to expand until he plungeddirectly into the face of a sun? But not one came near enough to show a disk;eventually they all veered aside, and streaked over the edge of theirrectangular frame.And still the far end of the shaft came no closer. It was almost as if the wallswere moving with him, carrying him to his unknown destination. Or perhaps he wasreally motionless, and space was moving past him...Not only space, he suddenly realized, was involved in whatever was happening tohim now. The clock on the pod's small instrument panel was also behavingstrangely.Normally, the numbers in the tenths-of-a-second window flickered past so quicklythat it was almost impossible to read them; now they were appearing anddisappearing at discrete intervals, and he could count them off one by onewithout difficulty. The seconds themselves were passing with incredibleslowness, as if time itself were coming to a stop. At last, the tenth-of-asecondcounter froze between 5 and 6.Yet he could still think, and even observe, as the ebon walls flowed past at aspeed that might have been anything between zero and a million times thevelocity of light. Somehow, he was not in the least surprised, nor was healarmed. On the contrary, he felt a sense of calm expectation, such as he hadonce known when the space medics had tested him with hallucinogenic drugs. Theworld around him was strange and wonderful, but there was nothing to fear. Hehad traveled these millions of miles in search of mystery; and now, it seemed,the mystery was coming to him.The rectangle ahead was growing lighter. The hominous star streaks were palingagainst a milky sky, whose brilliance increased moment by moment. It seemed asif the space pod was heading toward a bank of cloud, uniformly Illuminated bythe rays of an invisible sun.He was emerging from the tunnel. The far end, which until now had remained atthat same indeterminate distance, neither approaching nor receding, had suddenlystarted to obey the normal laws of perspective. It was coming closer, andsteadily widening before him. At the same time, he felt that he was movingupward, and for a fleeting instant he wondered if he had fallen right throughJapetus and was now ascending from the other side. But even before the space podsoared out into the open he knew that this place had nothing to do with Japetus,or with any world within the experience of man.There was no atmosphere, for he could see all details unblurred, clear down toan incredibly remote and flat horizon. He must be above a world of enormous size- perhaps one much larger than Earth. Yet despite its extent, all the surfacethat Bowman could see was tessellated into obviously artificia1 patterns thatmust have been miles on a side. It was like the jigsaw puzzle of a giant thatplayed with planets; and at the centers of many of those squares and trianglesand polygons were gaping black shafts - twins of the chasm from which he hadjust emerged.Yet the sky above was stranger - and, in its way, more disturbing - than eventhe improbable land beneath. For there were no stars; neither was there theblackness of space. There was only a softly glowing milkiness, that gave theimpression of infinite distance. Bowman remembered a description he had onceheard of the dreaded Antarctic \"whiteout\" - \"like being inside a ping-pongball.\" Those words could be applied perfectly to this weird place, but theexplanation must be utterly different. This sky could be no meteorologicaleffect of mist and snow; there was a perfect vacuum here.Then, as Bowman's eyes grew accustomed to the nacreous glow that filled theheavens, he became aware of another detail. The sky was not, as he had thoughtat first glance, completely empty. Dotted overhead, quite motionless and formingapparently random patterns, were myriads of tiny black specks.They were difficult to see, for they were mere points of darkness, but oncedetected they were quite unmistakable. They reminded Bowman of something -something so familiar, yet so insane, that he refused to accept the parallel,until logic forced it upon him.Those black holes in the white sky were stars; he might have been looking at aphotographic negative of the Milky Way.Where in God's name am I? Bowman asked himself; and even as he posed thequestion, he felt certain that he could never know the answer. It seemed thatspace had been turned inside out: this was not a place for man. Though thecapsule was comfortably warm, he felt suddenly cold, and was afflicted by analmost uncontrollable trembling. He wanted to close his eyes, and shut out thepearly nothingness that surrounded him; but that was the act of a coward, and hewould not yield to it.The pierced and faceted planet slowly rolled beneath him, without any realchange of scenery. He guessed that he was about ten miles above the surface, andshould be able to see any signs of life with ease.But this whole world was deserted; intelligence had come here, worked its willupon it, and gone its way again. Then he noticed, bumped above the flat plainperhaps twenty miles away, a roughly cylindrical pile of debris that could onlybe the carcass of a gigantic ship. It was too distant for him to see anydetails, and it passed out of sight within a few seconds, but he could make outbroken ribs and dully gleaming sheets of metal that had been partly peeled offlike the skin of an orange. He wondered how many thousands of years the wreckhad lain here on this deserted checkerboard - and what manner of creatures hadsailed it between the stars.Then he forgot the derelict, for something was coming up over the horizon.At first it looked like a flat disk, but that was because it was heading almostdirectly toward him. As it approached and passed beneath, he saw that it wasspindle-shaped, and several hundred feet long. Though there were faintly visiblebands here and there along its length, it was hard to focus upon them; theobject appeared to be vibrating, or perhaps spinning, at a very rapid rate.It tapered to a point at either end, and there was no sign of propulsion. Onlyone thing about it was familiar to human eyes, and that was its color. If it wasindeed a solid artifact, and not an optical phantom, then its makers perhapsshared some of the emotions of men.But they certainly did not share their limitations, for the spindle appeared tobe made of gold.Bowman moved his head to the rear-view system to watch the thing drop behind. Ithad ignored him completely, and now he saw that it was falling out of the skydown toward one of those thousands of great slots. A few seconds later itdisappeared in a final flash of gold as it dived into the planet. He was aloneagain, beneath that sinister sky, and the sense of isolation and remoteness wasmore overwhelming than ever.Then he saw that he also was sinking down toward the mottled surface of thegiant world, and that another of the rectangular chasms yawned immediatelybelow. The empty sky closed above him, the clock crawled to rest, and once againhis pod was falling between infinite ebon walls, toward another distant patch ofstars. But now he was sure that he was not returning to the Solar System, and ina flash of insight that might have been wholly spurious, he knew what this thingmust surely be.It was some kind of cosmic switching device, routing the traffic of the starsthrough unimaginable dimensions of space and time. He was passing through aGrand Central Station of the galaxy.42 - The Alien SkyFar ahead, the walls of the slot were becoming dimly visible once more, in thefaint light diffusing downward from some still hidden source. And then thedarkness was abruptly whipped away, as the tiny space pod hurtled upward into asky ablaze with stars.He was back in space as he knew it, but a single glance told him that he waslight-centuries from Earth.He did not even attempt to find any of the familiar constellations that sincethe beginning of history had been the friends of man; perhaps none of the starsthat now blazed around him had ever been seen by the unaided human eye.Most of them were concentrated in a glowing belt, broken here and there withdark bands of obscuring cosmic dust, which completely circled the sky. It waslike the Milky Way, but scores of times brighter; Bowman wondered if this wasindeed his own galaxy, seen from a point much closer to its brilliant, crowdedcenter.He hoped that it was; then he would not be so far from home. But this, herealized at once, was a childish thought. He was so inconceivably remote fromthe Solar System that it made little difference whether he was in his own galaxyor the most distant one that any telescope had ever glimpsed.He looked back to see the thing from which he was rising, and had another shock.Here was no giant, multifaceted world, nor any duplicate of Japetus. There wasnothing - except an inky shadow against the stars, like a doorway opening from adarkened room into a still darker night. Even as he watched, that doorwayclosed.It did not recede from him; it slowly filled with stars, as if a rent in thefabric of space had been repaired. Then he was alone beneath the alien sky.The space pod was slowly turning, and as it did so it brought fresh wonders intoview. First there was a perfectly spherical swarm of stars, becoming more andmore closely packed toward the center until its heart was a continuous glow oflight. Its outer edges were ill-defined - a slowly thinning halo of suns thatmerged imperceptibly into the background of more distant stars.This glorious apparition, Bowman knew, was a globular cluster. He was lookingupon something that no human eye had ever seen, save as a smudge of light in thefield of a telescope. He could not remember the distance to the nearest knowncluster, but he was sure that there were none within a thousand light-years ofthe Solar System.The pod continued its slow rotation, to disclose an even stranger sight - a hugered sun, many times larger than the Moon as seen from Earth. Bowman could lookstraight into its face without discomfort; judging by its color, it was nohotter than a glowing coal. Here and there, set into the somber red, were riversof bright yellow - incandescent Amazons, meandering for thousands of milesbefore they lost themselves in the deserts of this dying sun.Dying? No - that was a wholly false impression, born of human experience and theemotions aroused by the hues of sunset, or the glow of fading embers. This was astar that had left behind the fiery extravagances of its youth, had racedthrough the violets and blues and greens of the spectrum in a few fleetingbillions of years, and now had settled down to a peaceful maturity ofunimaginable length. All that had gone before was not a thousandth of what wasyet to come; the story of this star had barely begun.The pod had ceased to roll; the great red sun lay straight ahead. Though therewas no sense of motion, Bowman knew that he was still gripped by whatevercontrolling force had brought him here from Saturn.All the science and engineering skill of Earth seemed hopelessly primitive now,against the powers that were carrying him to some unimaginable fate.He stared into the sky ahead, trying to pick out the goal toward which be wasbeing taken - perhaps some planet circling this great sun. But there was nothingthat showed any visible disk or exceptional brightness; if there were planetsorbiting here he could not distinguish them from the stellar background.Then he noticed that something strange was happening on the very edge of thesun's crimson disk. A white glow had appeared there, and was rapidly waxing inbrilliance; he wondered if he was seeing one of those sudden eruptions, orflares, that trouble most stars from time to time.The light became brighter and bluer; it began to spread along the edge of thesun, whose blood-red hues paled swiftly by comparison. It was almost, Bowmantold himself, smiling at the absurdity of the thought, as if be were watchingsunrise - on a sun.And so indeed he was. Above the burning horizon lifted something no larger thana star, but so brilliant that the eye could not bear to look upon it. A merepoint of blue-white radiance, like an electric arc, was moving at unbelievablespeed across the face of the great sun. It must be very close to its giantcompanion; for immediately below it, drawn upward by its gravitational pull, wasa column of flame thousands of miles high. It was as if a tidal wave of fire wasmarching forever along the equator of this star, in vain pursuit of the searingapparition in its sky.That pinpoint of incandescence must be a White Dwarf - one of those strange,fierce little stars, no larger than the Earth, yet containing a million timesits mass. Such ill-matched stellar couples were not uncommon; but Bowman hadnever dreamed that one day he would see such a pair with his own eyes.The White Dwarf had transited almost half the disk of its companion - it musttake only minutes to make a complete orbit - when Bowman was at last certainthat he too was moving. Ahead of him, one of the stars was becoming rapidlybrighter, and was beginning to drift against its background. It must be somesmall, close body - perhaps the world toward which he was traveling.It was upon him with unexpected speed; and he saw that it was not a world atall.A dully gleaming cobweb or latticework of metal, hundreds of miles in extent,grew out of nowhere until it filled the sky. Scattered across its continent-widesurface were structures that must have been as large as cities, but whichappeared to be machines. Around many of these were assembled scores of smallerobjects, ranged in neat rows and columns. Bowman had passed several such groupsbefore he realized that they were fleets of spaceships; he was flying over agigantic orbital parking lot.Because there were no familiar objects by which he could judge the scale of thescene flashing by below, it was almost impossible to estimate the size of thevessels hanging there in space. But they were certainly enormous; some must havebeen miles in length. They were of many different designs - spheres, facetedcrystals, slim pencils, ovoids, disks. This must be one of the meeting placesfor the commerce of the stars.Or it had been - perhaps a million years ago. For nowhere could Bowman see anysign of activity; this sprawling spaceport was as dead as the Moon.He knew it not only by the absence of all movement, but by such unmistakablesigns as great gaps torn in the metal cobweb by the wasplike blunderings ofasteroids that must have smashed through it, eons ago. This was no longer aparking lot: it was a cosmic junk heap.He had missed its builders by ages, and with that realization Bowman felt asudden sinking of his heart. Though he had not known what to expect, at least hehad hoped to meet some intelligence from the stars.Now, it seemed, he was too late. He had been caught in an ancient, automatictrap, set for some unknown purpose, and still operating when its makers had longsince passed away. It had swept him across the galaxy, and dumped him (with howmany others?) in this celestial Sargasso, doomed soon to die when his air wasexhausted.Well, it was unreasonable to expect more. Already he had seen wonders for whichmany men would have sacrificed their lives. He thought of his dead companions;he had no cause for complaint.Then he saw that the derelict spaceport was still sliding past him withundiminished speed. He was sweeping over its outlying suburbs; its ragged edgewent by, and no longer partially eclipsed the stars. In a few more minutes, ithad fallen behind.His fate did not lie here - but far ahead, in the huge, crimson sun toward whichthe space pod was now unmistakably falling.43 - InfernoNow there was only the red sun, filling the sky from side to side. He was soclose that its surface was no longer frozen into immobility by sheer scale.There were luminous nodules moving to and fro, cyclones of ascending anddescending gas, prominences slowly rocketing toward the heavens. Slowly? Theymust be rising at a million miles an hour for their movement to be visible tohis eye.He did not even attempt to grasp the scale of the inferno toward which he wasdescending. The immensities of Saturn and Jupiter bad defeated him, duringDiscovery's fly-by in that solar system now unknown gigamiles away. Buteverything he saw here was a hundred times larger still; he could do nothing butaccept the images that were flooding into his mind, without attempting tointerpret them.As that sea of fire expanded beneath him, Bowman should have known fear - but,curiously enough, he now felt only a mild apprehension. It was not that his mindwas benumbed with wonders; logic told him that he must surely be under theprotection of some controlling and almost omnipotent intelligence. He was now soclose to the red sun that he would have been burned up in a moment if itsradiation had not been held at bay by some invisible screen. And during hisvoyage he had been subjected to accelerations that should have crushed himinstantly - yet he had felt nothing. If so much trouble had been taken topreserve him, there was still cause for hope.The space pod was now moving along a shallow arc almost parallel to the surfaceof the star, but slowly descending toward it. And now, for the first time,Bowman became aware of sounds. There was a faint, continuous roar, broken fromtime to time by crackles like tearing paper, or distant lightning. This could beonly the feeblest echo of an unimaginable cacophony; the atmosphere surroundinghim must be racked by concussions that could tear any material object to atoms.Yet he was protected from this shattering tumult as effectively as from theheat.Though ridges of flame thousands of miles high were rising and slowly collapsingaround him, he was completely insulated from all this violence. The energies ofthe star raved past him, as if they were in another universe; the pod movedsedately through their midst, un-buffeted and unscorched.Bowman's eyes, no longer hopelessly confused by the strangeness and grandeur ofthe scene, began to pick out details which must have been there before, butwhich he had not yet perceived. The surface of this star was no formless chaos;there was pattern here, as in everything that nature created.He noticed first the little whirlpools of gas - probably no larger than Asia orAfrica - that wandered over the surface of the star. Sometimes he could lookdirectly down into one of them, to see darker, cooler regions far below.Curiously enough, there appeared to be no sunspots; perhaps they were a diseasepeculiar to the star that shone on Earth.And there were occasional clouds, like wisps of smoke blown before a gale.Perhaps they were indeed smoke, for this sun was so cold that real fire couldexist here. Chemical compounds could be born and could live for a few secondsbefore they were again ripped apart by the fiercer nuclear violence thatsurrounded them.The horizon was growing brighter, its color changing from gloomy red to yellowto blue to blistering violet.The White Dwarf was coming up over the horizon, dragging its tidal wave ofstar-stuff behind it.Bowman shielded his eyes from the intolerable glare of the little sun, andfocused on the troubled starscape which its gravitational field was suckingskyward. Once he had seen a waterspout moving across the face of the Caribbean;this tower of flame had almost the same shape. Only the scale was slightlydifferent, for at its base, the column was probably wider than the planet Earth.And then, immediately beneath him, Bowman noticed something which was surelynew, since he could hardly have overlooked it if it had been there before.Moving across the ocean of glowing gas were myriads of bright beads; they shonewith a pearly light which waxed and waned in a period of a few seconds. And theywere all traveling in the same direction, like salmon moving upstream; sometimesthey weaved back and forth so that their paths intertwined, but they nevertouched.There were thousands of them, and the longer Bowman stared, the more convincedhe became that their motion was purposeful. They were too far away for him tomake out any details of their structure; that be could see them at all in thiscolossal panorama meant that they must be scores - perhaps hundreds - of milesacross. If they were organized entities, they were leviathans indeed, built tomatch the scale of the world they inhabited.Perhaps they were only clouds of plasma, given temporary stability by some oddcombination of natural forces - like the short-lived spheres of balllightningthat still puzzled terrestrial scientists. That was an easy, and perhapssoothing, explanation; but as Bowman looked down upon that star-wide streaming,he could not really believe it. Those glittering nodes of light knew where theywere going; they were deliberately converging upon the pillar of fire raised bythe White Dwarf as it orbited overhead.Bowman stared once more at that ascending column, now marching along the horizonbeneath the tiny, massive star that ruled it. Could it be pure imagination - orwere there patches of brighter luminosity creeping up that great geyser of gas,as if myriads of shining sparks had combined into whole continents ofphosphorescence?The idea was almost beyond fantasy, but perhaps he was watching nothing lessthan a migration from star to star, across a bridge of fire. Whether it was amovement of mindless, cosmic beasts driven across space by some lemming-likeurge, or a vast concourse of intelligent entities, he would probably never know.He was moving through a new order of creation, of which few men had everdreamed. Beyond the realms of sea and land and air and space lay the realms offire, which he alone had been privileged to glimpse. It was too much to expectthat he would also understand.44 - ReceptionThe pillar of fire was marching over the edge of the sun, like a storm passingbeyond the horizon. The scurrying flecks of light no longer moved across theredly glowing starscape still thousands of miles below. Inside his space pod,protected from an environment that could annihilate him within a millisecond,David Bowman awaited whatever had been prepared.The White Dwarf was sinking fast as it hurtled along its orbit; presently ittouched the horizon, set it aflame, and disappeared. A false twilight fell uponthe inferno beneath, and in the sudden change of illumination Bowman becameaware that something was happening in the space around him.The world of the red sun seemed to ripple, as if he were looking at it throughrunning water. For a moment he wondered if this was some refractive effect,perhaps caused by the passage of an unusually violent shock wave through thetortured atmosphere in which he was immersed.The light was fading; it seemed that a second twilight was about to fall.Involuntarily, Bowman looked upward, then checked himself sheepishly, as heremembered that here the main source of light was not the sky, but the blazingworld below.It seemed as if walls of some material like smoked glass were thickening aroundhim, cutting out the red glow and obscuring the view. It became darker anddarker; the faint roar of the stellar hurricanes also faded out. The space podwas floating in silence, and in night.A moment later, there was the softest of bumps as it settled on some hardsurface, and came to rest.To rest on what? Bowman asked himself incredulously. Then light returned; andincredulity gave way to a heart-sinking despair - for as he saw what lay aroundhim, he knew that he must be mad.He was prepared, he thought, for any wonder. The only thing he had neverexpected was the utterly commonplace.The space pod was resting on the polished floor of an elegant, anonymous hotelsuite that might have been in any large city on Earth. He was staring into aliving room with a coffee table, a divan, a dozen chairs, a writing desk,various lamps, a half-filled bookcase with some magazines lying on it, and evena bowl of flowers. Van Gogh's Bridge at Arles was hanging on one wall - Wyeth'sChristina's World on another. He felt confident that when he pulled open thedrawer of that desk, he would find a Gideon Bible inside it...If he was indeed mad, his delusions were beautifully organized. Everything wasperfectly real; nothing vanished when he turned his back. The only incongruouselement in the scene - and that certainly a major one - was the space poditself.For many minutes, Bowman did not move from his seat. He half expected the visionaround him to go away, but it remained as solid as anything be bad ever seen inhis life.It was real - or else a phantom of the senses so superbly contrived that therewas no way of distinguishing it from reality. Perhaps it was some kind of test;if so, not only his fate but that of the human race might well depend upon hisactions in the next few minutes.He could sit here and wait for something to happen, or he could open the pod andstep outside to challenge the reality of the scene around him. The floorappeared to be solid; at least, it was bearing the weight of the space pod. Hewas not likely to fall through it - whatever \"it\" might really be.But there was still the question of air; for all that he could tell, this roommight be in vacuum, or might contain a poisonous atmosphere. He thought it veryunlikely - no one would go to all this trouble without attending to such anessential detail - but he did not propose to take unnecessary risks. In anyevent, his years of training made him wary of contamination; he was reluctant toexpose himself to an unknown environment until he knew that there was noalternative. This place looked like a hotel room somewhere in the United States.That did not alter the fact that in reality he must be hundreds of light-yearsfrom the Solar System.He closed the helmet of his suit, sealing himself in, and actuated the hatch ofthe space pod. There was a brief hiss of pressure equalization; then he steppedout into the room.As far as he could tell, he was in a perfectly normal gravity field. He raisedone arm, then let it fall freely. It flopped to his side in less than a second.This made everything seem doubly unreal. Here he was wearing a spacesuit,standing - when he should have been floating - outside a vehicle which couldonly function properly in the absence of gravity. All his normal astronaut'sreflexes were upset; he had to think before he made every movement.Like a man in a trance he walked slowly from his bare, unfurnished half of theroom toward the hotel suite. It did not, as he had almost expected, disappear ashe approached, but remained perfectly real - and apparently perfectly solid.He stopped beside the coffee table. On it sat a conventional Bell Systemvision-phone, complete with the local directory. He bent down and picked up thevolume with his clumsy, gloved hands.It bore, in the familiar type he had seen thousands of times, the name:WASHINGTON, D.C.Then he looked more closely; and for the first time, he had objective proofthat, although all this might be real, he was not on Earth.He could read only the word Washington; the rest of the printing was a blur, asif it had been copied from a newspaper photograph. He opened the book at randomand riffled through the pages. They were all blank sheets of crisp whitematerial which was certainly not paper, though it looked very much like it.He lifted the telephone receiver and pressed it against the plastic of hishelmet. If there had been a dialing sound he could have heard it through theconducting material. But, as he had expected, there was only silence.So - it was all a fake, though a fantastically careful one. And it was clearlynot intended to deceive but rather - he hoped - to reassure. That was a verycomforting thought; nevertheless he would not remove his suit until be hadcompleted his voyage of exploration. All the furniture seemed sound and solidenough; he tried the chairs, and they supported his weight. But the drawers inthe desk would not open; they were dummies.So were the books and magazines; like the telephone directory, only the titleswere readable. They formed an odd selection - mostly rather trashy best sellers,a few sensational works of nonfiction, and some well-publicized autobiographies.There was nothing less than three years old, and little of any intellectualcontent. Not that it mattered, for the books could not even be taken down fromthe shelves.There were two doors that opened readily enough. The first one took him into asmall but comfortable bedroom, fitted with a bed, bureau, two chairs, lightswitches that actually worked, and a clothes closet. He opened this, and foundhimself looking at four suits, a dressing gown, a dozen white shirts, andseveral sets of underwear, all neatly draped from hangers.He took down one of the suits, and inspected it carefully. As far as his glovedhands could judge, it was made of material that was more like fur than wool. Itwas also a little out of style; on Earth, no one had been wearingsingle-breasted suits for at least four years.Next to the bedroom was a bathroom, complete with fittings which, he wasrelieved to note, were not dummies, but worked in a perfectly normal manner. Andafter that was a kitchenette, with electric cooker, refrigerator, storagecupboards, crockery and cutlery, sink, table, and chairs. Bowman began toexplore this not only with curiosity, but with mounting hunger.First he opened the refrigerator, and a wave of cold mist rolled out. Theshelves were well stocked with packages and cans, all of them looking perfectlyfamiliar from a distance, though at close quarters their proprietary labels wereblurred and unreadable. However, there was a notable absence of eggs, milk,butter, meat, fruit, or any other unprocessed food; the refrigerator held onlyitems that had already been packaged in some way.Bowman picked up a carton of a familiar breakfast cereal, thinking as he did sothat it was odd to keep this frozen. The moment he lifted the package, he knewthat it certainly did not contain cornflakes; it was much too heavy.He ripped open the lid, and examined the contents.The box contained a slightly moist blue substance, of about the weight andtexture of bread pudding. Apart from its odd color, it looked quite appetizing.But this is ridiculous, Bowman told himself. I am almost certainly beingwatched, and I must look an idiot wearing this suit. If this is some kind ofintelligence test, I've probably failed already. Without further hesitation, hewalked back into the bedroom and began to undo the clamp of his helmet. When itwas loose, he lifted the helmet a fraction of an inch, cracked the seal and tooka cautious sniff. As far as he could tell, he was breathing perfectly normalair.He dropped the helmet on the bed, and began thankfully - and rather stiffly- to divest himself of his suit. When he had finished, he stretched, took a fewdeep breaths, and carefully hung the spacesuit up among the more conventionalarticles of clothing in the closet. It looked rather odd there, but thecompulsive tidiness that Bowman shared with all astronauts would never haveallowed him to leave it anywhere else.Then he walked quickly back into the kitchen and began to inspect the\"cereal\" box at closer quarters.The blue bread pudding had a faint, spicy smell, something like a macaroon.Bowman weighed it in his hand, then broke off a piece and cautiously sniffed atit. Though he felt sure now that there would be no deliberate attempt to poisonhim, there was always the possibility of mistakes - especially in a matter socomplex as biochemistry.He nibbled at a few crumbs, then chewed and swallowed the fragment of food; itwas excellent, though the flavor was so elusive as to be almost indescribable.If he closed his eyes, he could imagine it was meat, or wholemeal bread, or evendried fruit. Unless there were unexpected aftereffects, he had no cause to fearstarvation.When he had eaten just a few mouthfuls of the substance, and already felt quitesatisfied, he looked for something to drink. There were half a dozen cans ofbeer - again of a famous brand - at the back of the refrigerator, and he pressedthe tab on one of them to open it.The prestressed metal lid popped off along its strain lines, exactly as usual.But the can did not contain beer; to Bowman's surprised disappointment, it heldmore of the blue food.In a few seconds he had opened half a dozen of the other packages and cans.Whatever their labels, their contents were the same; it seemed that his diet wasgoing to be a little monotonous, and that he would have nothing but water todrink. He filled a glass from the kitchen faucet and sipped at it cautiously.He spat out the first few drops at once; the taste was terrible. Then, ratherashamed of his instinctive reaction, he forced himself to drink the rest.That first sip had been enough to identify the liquid. It tasted terriblebecause it had no taste at all; the faucet was supplying pure, distilled water.His unknown hosts were obviously taking no chances with his health.Feeling much refreshed, he then had a quick shower. There was no soap, which wasanother minor inconvenience, but there was a very efficient hot-air drier inwhich be luxuriated for a while before trying on underpants, vest, and dressinggown from the clothes closet. After that, he lay down on the bed, stared up atthe ceiling, and tried to make sense of this fantastic situation.He had made little progress when he was distracted by another line of thought.Immediately above the bed was the usual hotel-type ceiling TV screen; he hadassumed that, like the telephone and books, it was a dummy.But the control unit on its swinging bedside arm looked so realistic that hecould not resist playing with it; and as his fingers touched the ON sensor disk,the screen lit up.Feverishly, he started to tap out channel selector codes at random - and almostat once he got his first picture.It was a well-known African news commentator, discussing the attempts being madeto preserve the last remnants of his country's wild life. Bowman listened for afew seconds, so captivated by the sound of a human voice that he did not in theleast care what it was talking about. Then he changed channels.In the next five minutes, he got a symphony orchestra playing Walton's ViolinConcerto, a discussion on the sad state of the legitimate theater, a western, ademonstration of a new headache cure, a panel game in some Oriental language, apsychodrama, three news commentaries, a football game, a lecture on solidgeometry (in Russian), and several tuning signals and data transmissions. Itwas, in fact, a perfectly normal selection from the world's TV programs, andapart from the psychological uplift it gave him, it confirmed one suspicion thathad already been forming in his mind.All the programs were about two years old. That was around the time TMA-1had been discovered, and it was hard to believe that this was a purecoincidence. Something had been monitoring the radio waves; that ebon block hadbeen busier than men had suspected.He continued to wander across the spectrum, and suddenly recognized a familiarscene. Here was this very suite, now occupied by a celebrated actor who wasfuriously denouncing an unfaithful mistress. Bowman looked with a shock ofrecognition upon the living room he had just left - and when the camera followedthe indignant couple toward the bedroom, he involuntarily looked toward the doorto see if anyone was entering.So that was how this reception area had been prepared for him; his hosts hadbased their ideas of terrestrial living upon TV programs. His feeling that hewas inside a movie set was almost literally true.He had learned all that he wished to for the moment, and turned off the set.What do I do now? he asked himself, locking his fingers behind his head andstaring up at the blank screen.He was physically and emotionally exhausted, yet it seemed impossible that onecould sleep in such fantastic surroundings, and farther from Earth than any manin history had ever been. But the comfortable bed, and the instinctive wisdom ofthe body, conspired together against his will.He fumbled for the light switch, and the room was plunged into darkness. Withinseconds, he had passed beyond the reach of dreams.So, for the last time, David Bowman slept.45 - RecapitulationThere being no further use for it, the furniture of the suite dissolved backinto the mind of its creator. Only the bed remained - and the walls, shieldingthis fragile organism from the energies it could not yet control.In his sleep, David Bowman stirred restlessly. He did not wake, nor did hedream, but he was no longer wholly unconscious. Like a fog creeping through aforest, something invaded his mind. He sensed it only dimly, for the full impactwould have destroyed him as surely as the fires raging beyond these walls.Beneath that dispassionate scrutiny, he felt neither hope nor fear; all emotionhad been leached away.He seemed to be floating in free space, while around him stretched, in alldirections, an infinite geometrical grid of dark lines or threads, along whichmoved tiny nodes of light - some slowly, some at dazzling speed.Once he had peered through a microscope at a cross-section of a human brain, andin its network of nerve fibers had glimpsed the same labyrinthine complexity.But that had been dead and static, whereas this transcended life itself. He knew- or believed he knew - that he was watching the operation of some giganticmind, contemplating the universe of which he was so tiny a part.The vision, or illusion, lasted only a moment. Then the crystalline planes andlattices, and the interlocking perspectives of moving light, flickered out ofexistence, as David Bowman moved into a realm of consciousness that no man hadexperienced before.At first, it seemed that Time itself was running backward. Even this marvel hewas prepared to accept, before be realized the subtler truth.The springs of memory were being tapped; in controlled recollection, he wasreliving the past. There was the hotel suite - there the space pod - there theburning starscapes of the red sun - there the shining core of the galaxy - therethe gateway through which he had reemerged into the universe. And not onlyvision, but all the sense impressions, and all the emotions he had felt at thetime, were racing past, more and more swiftly. His life was unreeling like atape recorder playing back at ever-increasing speed.Now he was once more aboard the Discovery and the rings of Saturn filled thesky. Before that, he was repeating his final dialogue with Hal; he was seeingFrank Poole leave on his last mission; he was hearing the voice of Earth,assuring him that all was well.And even as he relived these events, he knew that all indeed was well. He wasretrogressing down the corridors of time, being drained of knowledge andexperience as he swept back toward his childhood. But nothing was being lost;all that be had ever been, at every moment of his life, was being transferred tosafer keeping. Even as one David Bowman ceased to exist, another becameimmortal.Faster, faster he moved back into forgotten years, and into a simpler world.Faces he had once loved, and had thought lost beyond recall, smiled at himsweetly. He smiled back with fondness, and without pain.Now, at last, the headlong regression was slackening; the wells of memory werenearly dry. Time flowed more and more sluggishly, approaching a moment of stasis- as a swinging pendulum, at the limit of its arc, seems frozen for one eternalinstant, before the next cycle begins.The timeless instant passed; the pendulum reversed its swing. In an empty room,floating amid the fires of a double star twenty thousand light-years from Earth,a baby opened its eyes and began to cry.46 - TransformationThen it became silent, as it saw that it was no longer alone.A ghostly, glimmering rectangle had formed in the empty air. It solidified intoa crystal tablet, lost its transparency, and became suffused with a pale, milkyluminescence. Tantalizing, ill-defined phantoms moved across its surface and inits depths. They coalesced into bars of lights and shadow, then formedintermeshing, spoked patterns that began slowly to rotate, in time with thepulsing rhythm that now seemed to fill the whole of space.It was a spectacle to grasp and hold the attention of any child - or of anyman-ape. But, as it had been three million years before, it was only the outwardmanifestation of forces too subtle to be consciously perceived. It was merely atoy to distract the senses, while the real processing was carried out at fardeeper levels of the mind.This time, the processing was swift and certain, as the new design was woven.For in the eons since their last meeting, much had been learned by the weaver;and the material on which he practiced his art was now of an infinitely finertexture. But whether it should be permitted to form part of his stillgrowingtapestry, only the future could tell.With eyes that already held more than human intentness, the baby stared into thedepths of the crystal monolith, seeing - but not yet understanding - themysteries that lay beyond. It knew that it had come home, that here was theorigin of many races besides its own; but it knew also that it could not stay.Beyond this moment lay another birth, stranger than any in the past.Now the moment had come; the glowing patterns no longer echoed the secrets inthe crystal's heart. As they died, so too the protective walls faded back intothe nonexistence from which they bad briefly emerged, and the red sun filled thesky.The metal and plastic of the forgotten space pod, and the clothing once worn byan entity who had called himself David Bowman, flashed into flame. The lastlinks with Earth were gone, resolved back into their component atoms.But the child scarcely noticed, as he adjusted himself to the comfortable glowof his new environment. He still needed, for a little while, this shell ofmatter as the focus of his powers. His indestructible body was his mind'spresent image of itself; and for all his powers, he knew that he was still ababy. So he would remain until he had decided on a new form, or had passedbeyond the necessities of matter.And now it was time to go - though in one sense he would never leave this placewhere he had been reborn, for he would always be part of the entity that usedthis double star for its unfathomable purposes. The direction, though not thenature, of his destiny was clear before him, and there was no need to trace thedevious path by which he had come. With the instincts of three million years, henow perceived that there were more ways than one behind the back of space. Theancient mechanisms of the Star Gate had served him well, but he would not needthem again.The glimmering rectangular shape that had once seemed no more than a slab ofcrystal still floated before him, indifferent as he was to the harmless flamesof the inferno beneath. It encapsulated yet unfathomed secrets of space andtime, but some at least he now understood and was able to command. How obvious -how necessary - was that mathematical ratio of its sides, the quadratic sequence1 : 4 : 9! And how naive to have imagined that the series ended at this point,in only three dimensions!He focused his mind upon these geometrical simplicities, and as his thoughtsbrushed against it, the empty framework filled with the darkness of theinterstellar night. The glow of the red sun faded - or, rather, seemed to recedein all directions at once - and there before him was the luminous whirlpool ofthe galaxy.It might have been some beautiful, incredibly detailed model, embedded in ablock of plastic. But it was the reality, grasped as a whole with senses nowmore subtle than vision. If he wished, he could focus his attention upon any oneof its hundred billion stars; and he could do much more than that.Here he was, adrift in this great river of suns, halfway between the bankedfires of the galactic core and the lonely, scattered sentinel stars of the rim.And here he wished to be, on the far side of this chasm in the sky, thisserpentine band of darkness, empty of all stars. He knew that this formlesschaos, visible only by the glow that limned its edges from fire-mists farbeyond, was the still unused stuff of creation, the raw material of evolutionsyet to be. Here, Time had not begun; not until the suns that now burned werelong since dead would light and life reshape this void.Unwittingly, he had crossed it once; now he must cross it again - this time, ofhis own volition. The thought filled him with a sudden, freezing terror, so thatfor a moment he was wholly disorientated, and his new vision of the universetrembled and threatened to shatter into a thousand fragments.It was not fear of the galactic gulfs that chilled his soul, but a more profounddisquiet, stemming from the unborn future. For he had left behind the timescales of his human origin; now, as he contemplated that band of starless night,he knew his first intimations of the Eternity that yawned before him.Then he remembered that he would never be alone, and his panic slowly ebbed. Thecrystal-clear perception of the universe was restored to him - not, he knew,wholly by his own efforts. When he needed guidance in his first faltering steps,it would be there.Confident once more, like a high diver who had regained his nerve, he launchedhimself across the light-years. The galaxy burst forth from the mental frame inwhich he had enclosed it; stars and nebulae poured past him in an illusion ofinfinite speed. Phantom suns exploded and fell behind as he slipped like ashadow through their cores; the cold, dark waste of cosmic dust which he hadonce feared seemed no more than the beat of a raven's wing across the face ofthe Sun.The stars were thinning out; the glare of the Milky Way was dimming into a paleghost of the glory he had known - and, when he was ready, would know again.He was back, precisely where he wished to be, in the space that men called real.47 - Star-ChildThere before him, a glittering toy no Star-Child could resist, floated theplanet Earth with all its peoples.He had returned in time. Down there on that crowded globe, the alarms would beflashing across the radar screens, the great tracking telescopes would besearching the skies - and history as men knew it would be drawing to a close.A thousand miles below, he became aware that a slumbering cargo of death hadawoken, and was stirring sluggishly in its orbit. The feeble energies itcontained were no possible menace to him; but he preferred a cleaner sky. He putforth his will, and the circling megatons flowered in a silent detonation thatbrought a brief, false dawn to half the sleeping globe. Then he waited,marshaling his thoughts and brooding over his still untested powers. For thoughhe was master of the world, he was not quite sure what to do next.But he would think of something.Epilogue: After 2001The novel 2001: A Space Odyssey was written during the years 1964-1968 and waspublished in July 1968, shortly after release of the movie. As I have describedin The Lost Worlds of 2001, both projects proceeded simultaneously, withfeedback in each direction.Thus I often had the strange experience of revising the manuscript after viewingrushes based upon an earlier version of the story - a stimulating but ratherexpensive way of writing a novel.As a result, there is a much closer parallel between book and movie than isusually the case, but there are also major differences. In the novel, thedestination of the spaceship Discovery was Iapetus (or Japetus), most enigmaticof Saturn's many moons. The Saturnian system was reached via Jupiter: Discoverymade a close approach to the giant planet, using its enormous gravitationalfield to produce a \"slingshot\" effect and to accelerate it along the second lapof its journey. Exactly the same maneuver was used by the Voyager space-probesin 1979, when they made the first detailed reconnaissance of the outer giants.In the movie, however, Stanley Kubrick wisely avoided confusion by setting thethird confrontation between Man and Monolith among the moons of Jupiter. Saturnwas dropped from the script entirely, though Douglas Trumbull later used theexpertise he had acquired filming the ringed planet in his own production,Silent Running.No one could have imagined, back in the mid-sixties, that the exploration of themoons of Jupiter lay not in the next century but only fifteen years ahead. Norhad anyone dreamed of the wonders that would be found there - although we can bequite certain that the discoveries of the twin Voyagers will one day besurpassed by even more unexpected finds. When 2001 was written, Io, Europa,Ganymede, and Callisto were mere pinpoints of light in even the most powerfultelescope; now they are worlds, each unique, and one of them - Io - the mostvolcanically active body in the Solar System.Yet all things considered, both movie and book stand up quite well in the lightof these discoveries. There are no major changes I would wish to make to thetext, and it is fascinating to compare the Jupiter sequences in the film withthe actual movies from the Voyager cameras.It must also be remembered that 2001 was written in an age that now lies beyondone of the Great Divides in human history; we are sundered from it forever bythe moment when Neil Armstrong set foot upon the Moon. July 20, 1969, was stillhalf a decade in the future when Stanley Kubrick and I started thinking aboutthe \"proverbial good science fiction movie\" (his phrase). Now history andfiction have become inextricably intertwined.The Apollo astronauts had already seen the film when they left for the Moon. Thecrew of Apollo 8, who at Christmas 1968 became the first men ever to set eyesupon the lunar Farside, told me that they had been tempted to radio back thediscovery of a large, black monolith: alas, discretion prevailed...And there were later, almost uncanny, instances of nature imitating art.Strangest of all was the saga of Apollo 13 in 1970.As a good opening, the Command Module, which houses the crew, had beenchristened Odyssey. Just before the explosion of the oxygen tank which causedthe mission to be aborted, the crew had been playing Richard Strauss'Zarathustra theme, now universally identified with the movie. Immediately afterthe loss of power, Jack Swigert radioed back to Mission Control: \"Houston, we'vehad a problem.\" The words that Hal used to Frank Poole on a similar occasionwere: \"Sorry to interrupt the festivities, but we have a problem.\"When the report of the Apollo 13 mission was later published, NASA AdministratorTom Paine sent me a copy and noted under Swigert's words: \"Just as you alwayssaid it would be, Arthur.\" I still get a very strange feeling when I contemplatethis whole series of events - almost, indeed, as if I share a certainresponsibility...Another resonance is less serious, but equally striking. One of the mosttechnically brilliant sequences in the movie was that in which astronaut FrankPoole was shown running round and round the circular track of the giantcentrifuge, held in place by the \"artificial gravity\" produced by its spin.Almost a decade later, the crew of the superbly successful Skylab realized thatits designers had provided them with a similar geometry; a ring of storagecabinets formed a smooth, circular band around the space station's interior.Skylab, however, was not spinning, but this did not deter its ingeniousoccupants. They discovered that they could run around the track, just like micein a squirrel cage, to produce a result visually indistinguishable from thatshown in 2001. And they televised the whole exercise back to Earth (need I namethe accompanying music?) with the comment: \"Stanley Kubrick should see this.\" Asin due course he did, because I sent him the telecine recording. (I never got itback; Stanley uses a tame Black Hole as a filing system.)There is also the strange case of the \"Eye of Japetus,\" described in Chapter 35,where Bowman discovers \"a brilliant white oval... so sharp-edged that it almostlooked... painted on the face of the little moon\" with a tiny black dot at theexact center, which turns out to be the Monolith (or one of its avatars).Well - when Voyager 1 took the first photographs of Iapetus, they did indeeddisclose a large, clear-cut white oval with a tiny black dot at the center. CarlSagan promptly sent me a print from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory with thecryptic annotation \"Thinking of you...\" I do not know whether to be relieved ordisappointed that Voyager 2 has left the matter still open.When, fourteen years ago, I typed the final words \"For though he was master ofthe world, he was not quite sure what to do next. But he would think ofsomething\" I felt I had closed the circuit and precluded all possibility of asequel. Indeed, for the next decade I ridiculed the very idea, for what seemedto me conclusive reasons. Since 2001 was concerned with the next stage of humanevolution, to expect me (or even Stanley) to depict it would be as absurd asasking Moon-watcher to describe Bowman and his world.Despite my protests, it is now obvious that my busy little subconscious was hardat work, perhaps in response to the constant stream of letters from readerswanting to know \"what happened next.\" Finally, as an intellectual exercise, Iwrote a précis of a possible sequel in the form of a short movie outline andsent copies to Stanley Kubrick and my agent, Scott Meredith. As far as Stanleywas concerned, this was an act of courtesy, for I knew that he never repeatshimself (just as I never write sequels), but I hoped that Scott would sell theoutline to Omni magazine, which had recently published another outline, \"TheSongs of Distant Earth.\" Then, I fondly hoped, the ghost of 2001 would befinally exorcised.Stanley expressed guarded interest, but Scott was enthusiastic - and implacable.\"You've simply got to write the book,\" he said. With a groan, I realized that hewas right...So now, gentle reader (to coin a phrase), you can find what happens next in2010: Space Odyssey Two. I am extremely grateful to New American Library,copyright holders of 2001: A Space Odyssey, for permission to use Chapter 37 inthe new novel; It serves as a link, connecting the two books together.A final comment on both novels as seen from a point now almost exactly midwaybetween the year 2001 and the time when Stanley Kubrick and I started workingtogether. Contrary to popular belief, science fiction writers very seldomattempt to predict the future; indeed, as Ray Bradbury put it so well, they moreoften try to prevent it. In 1964, the first heroic period of the Space Age wasjust opening; the United States had set the Moon as its target, and once thatdecision had been made, the ultimate conquest of the other planets, appearedinevitable. By 2001, it seemed quite reasonable that there would be giantspace-stations in orbit round the Earth and - a little later - mannedexpeditions to the planets.In an ideal world, that would have been possible: the Vietnam War would havepaid for everything that Stanley Kubrick showed on the Cinerama screen. Now werealize that it will take a little longer.2001 will not arrive by 2001. Yet - barring accidents - by that date almosteverything depicted in the book and the movie will be in the advanced planningstage.Except for communication with alien intelligences: that is something that cannever be planned - only anticipated. No one knows whether it will happentomorrow - or a thousand years hence.But it will happen someday.ARTHUR C. CLARKEColombo, Sri LankaNovember, 1982"}]
