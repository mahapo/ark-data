[{"pageContent":"undefined"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1FREEDOMThe definition of freedom is the infinite value of the human being. Thedefinition of evil is the destruction of freedom. Everything that is evilteaches people that they have limited value.SIMPLETruth is always simple. All people recognize truth because all people areintelligent beings. It is the nature of evil to create artificially complexideas. It does this to hide or obfuscate the freedom it destroys. If you removethe complexities and fears from your life you will find a plain and beautifultruth. This truth is the nature of your worth.VALUE OF MANTo understand freedom is to understand the value of a person. Everything thatevil wants is to disguise and destroy your value. All authority is created byevil men to disguise your worth. To understand your own worth is to understandthe nature of liberty.EVILThe crucial key for understanding our world is to understand the nature of evil.Evil challenges the value of people by denying them the opportunity to maketheir own choices; by denying them the chance to grow strong in learningand understanding.FREEDOMWhile evil seeks to destroy or hide a person's worth, freedom shows humans theirfull potential and their full value. With freedom, people have loved, cureddisease, removed hunger, eased labor and lived in peace. With freedom, happinessis possible. Freedom is the exact opposite of evil.YOUEverything written in this book is written to destroy the ideas of culture andlaw. The lesson of this book is simple: nothing on earth is more valuable thanyou."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2EARTHThere is a dark conspiracy which has clouded the minds of humanity throughoutall ages. This conspiracy is evil incarnate, and controls vast mountains ofhuman emotions, work, thought and speech. It has been responsible for the deathsof hundred upon hundreds of millions and the slavery of nearly every being whohas ever lived.If you can accept a single principle—that you have infinite worth—then this bookwill give you the vision necessary to see the world as it truly is. To know onceand for all that this dark conspiracy is not strong, but weak; that evil is notgrowing, but dying.PRINCIPLE VERSUS LAWTo understand how evil controls people, it is necessary to understand thedifference between principle and law.A principle is a truth that creates freedom. A law is a lie that createsslavery.Principles describe reality. They are knowledge that help you to make use ofyour world. Because of your intelligence, you recognize principles in everythingyou do. Every true thing you learn is a principle. The movements of your hands,which foods taste good, mathematics and empathy for a friend are all based onprinciples.Laws are artificial ideas created by evil men to restrict the thinking andunderstanding of people. Laws mask themselves in authority so that they canimpersonate principles. When people mistake law for principle their freedom isrestricted. When people mistake truth for the ideas of authority, theirabilities and their wisdom are diminished. This is the purpose of law.An example of a principle can be found in thermodynamics. A liquid is coolerthan a gas. This is a principle. Because this is a principle, it does notrestrict us, but enables us. Using this principle, we can condense and expand asubstance between gas and liquid to create refrigeration. With this principle,we have more understanding and more power. Principles are truths that createfreedom.An example of a law can be found in the culture of royalty. A commoner oweshomage to the king. This is a law. Because this is a law, it destroys freedomand enslaves. Under this law, a person must neglect usage of their minds, theirspeech and their actions. They must believe that they are worth less than theking. Notice that unlike principle, there is no truth in law. It is entirelypossible to disrespect the king, and therefore to break the law. Law must beenforced, because there is no truth in it. A law destroys freedom because it isa lie. A principle, however, creates freedom because it is knowledge.That which destroys freedom is evil.SIMPLICITYThe world is simpler than it pretends.Complexities are found in every aspect of our cultures, politics and economies.Every day people are introduced to new ideas, new spin, new views or a newsymptom of our world. Many of these ideas are perversions of principle designedto engineer specific reactions from people.Evil societies invent ideas to destroy the free thinking of people. Some ofhistory's names for these ideas have been socialism, fascism, racism, communism,democracy, class warfare, political correctness, propriety, decency, royaltyand terrorism. All of these ideas are created for exactly the same purpose. Theyare all vehicles to confuse the minds of the victims of slavery. They are allevil.You are capable of understanding everything in the world around you. Yourintelligence is not limited. Distortions and complexities are introduced intoyour understanding so that evil men can control you. Evil wants you to believethat you are incapable of understanding your own world. When you understand themagnitude of your own worth, evil will fail.There are two principles relevant to understanding the concept ofintelligence. The first is simplicity. The principle of simplicity states thatintelligence recognizes truth. When any truth is presented in pure form, allpeople are capable of understanding it. There is no truth that you cannot learn.This is the principle of simplicity; that intelligence recognizes truth.The second principle is the principle of obfuscation. Obfuscation is thedistortion of principle. Obfuscation is the creation of false ideas in order tohide truth. Sometimes this is simply adding ideas on top of truth to disguisethe nature of the original truth. Even ideas that seem entirely appropriate canbe used to bury simple truths.Obfuscation is used by evil to confuse the minds of people. Obfuscation distortsprinciples so that people will be unable to learn. Evil uses obfuscation so thatyou will be unable to gain wisdom. It does this to limit your freedom. Cultureknows that people will discover fewer truths if they are focused on artificialcomplexities.As children grow, they learn that seemingly complex ideas are actually basic andsimple principles. What may have seemed impossible to understand at one pointbecomes wonderful once understood. It is good to gain wisdom. With wisdom youcan do anything.Your search for knowledge will become easier for you as you shed any notion ofyour own inferiority. Evil uses obfuscation to make people feel inferior. Youare not inferior to other people, and you are not inferior to ideas. You haveinfinite worth.WHO YOU AREAs a human being, you are very special. You are unlike the minerals, the plantsor the animals of earth. Nothing commands the abilities of intelligence likeyou. Nothing else has such complete and total ambition to satisfy dreams.Nothing else has the desire or the thirst for knowledge that you possess. Youare a human being.There is no limit to your nature. There is no end to your capacity forunderstanding or for happiness. As a human being, your life is not subject toany will except your own. You require no permission, favor or license to learnand grow. Anything that you desire can be yours.People naturally seek happiness in their lives, and the most common and deepestdesire is for the love and strength of their families. Everything you doenhances security, peace and prosperity for yourself and those you love. Yourability to create these things from the desires of your heart is properlydefined as faith. With faith you will find joy in every walk of your life.FAITHFaith is the courage to test ideas for truth. With faith, people discoverwhether ideas are true or false. With faith, people learn principles.People use faith to take steps in testing principles. We often fail, but wealways learn.Imagine walking over a rocky surface. Perhaps you expect that the surface issolid and will not shift. If you expected firm ground, but found movement, youmay stumble. When the ideas you are testing are wrong, your test will fail. Yourintelligence helps you to adjust your thinking to better understand theprinciples of walking. You learn to control your balance in spite of thedifficult terrain. You use faith to test your new understanding, and soon cantraverse successfully and quickly. You are mastering principles.Any time human beings put principles into action, they will feel power,excitement and joy. The realization of intelligence is what people seek. Someexamples are a little child proudly showing his parents that he has learned totie his shoes, or a student mastering an understanding of mathematics, ora husband and wife resolving an argument. These are the discovery of principlesby the test of faith.The application of faith to principle brings wisdom.Freedom is necessary. The destruction of freedom prevents people from usingfaith. It prevents people from testing their understanding of principles. Whenwe are not free to take steps, we cannot learn and we cannot grow. Love,prosperity and knowledge are all things that are only possible withfreedom. Freedom brings everything good.As a human being, the degree of freedom that you require is infinite. Freedom isthe infinite value of the human being. If evil destroys freedom in any area ofyour life, it can limit your wisdom, your love, and your joy.DANGERThere are people who would destroy your freedom. They want to control you sothat you cannot become the person you want to be. In order to control you, theyuse force to take away the liberty that you were born with.You must never underestimate the prowess or cruelty of evil people. Evil willconfiscate money, destroy virtue and spill blood. Most people are not evil; mostpeople try to create and not to destroy. However, evil people do exist and theyare extremely dangerous.They are called authority.AUTHORITYThere is no authority on earth that can rightfully govern yourlife.Born to this world, you and you alone control your eyes, your ears, your tongue,your hands and your mind. All authority which claims to be able to dispose ofyou and your abilities is deceit.You were born to this world so that you might have the free agency of life. Lifeis liberty. With liberty and faith in this world, you can learn and do anything.Anyone who tells you that you must yield your mind, your body, or yourpossessions to authority is evil.Understand that choices made of your own free will are not evil. There isnothing wrong with sacrifice, if it is made willingly. But sacrifice withoutchoice is not sacrifice, it is slavery. Authority always places demands onpeople by force. Authority never asks permission.OBSCUREDThe simplest authorities are common thieves. They use extortion or stealth toconfiscate things that you value. They can steal money, virtue through rape, orlife through murder. By their actions, they are teaching you that your worth isinferior to theirs. The tool of their authority is violence.There are other, far more powerful authorities in your everyday life. They aredramatically more dangerous, more profitable and more subtle. They teach youthrough distorted ideas that you are not capable or worthy of livingfree. Authorities teach that other people can manage your life better than youcan.With a callous disregard for your worth, you are commanded to behave accordingto someone else's ideas. The height of the danger can be seen in the extent towhich these commands are commonly accepted as good. We know them as culture.You will find such subterfuge everywhere you have value in your life. Ifsomething is valuable to you, you can be sure that someone, somewhere, iswilling to take it from you. While they bear the same evil as the common thief,the methods of sophisticated culture are normally much, much more powerful.EVILEvil is the destruction of freedom.It cannot be stated more simply. Everywhere you look, you will find theobfuscation of evil. There are countless ideas which are taught about the natureof evil. Every false idea is created by evil to hide truth from you.Evil is not darkness and it is not a frightening unknown. Evil is not somemystical psychology of man, nor is it inherent in our natures. It is notsupernatural, and it most definitely exists.As with all principles, the principle of evil is simple. Evil is the destructionof freedom. When free, you can build glory, peace, prosperity and joy into theworld. Around you, you will find all these things. Men and women like you builtthese things.Evil enslaves. Evil is found in words such as force, compulsion, tax, violence,theft, censure, and politics. Notice that in such things, there is no joy. Nonehave any value to humanity.CONTROLEvil seeks to be a master over you. Evil wants you to be a slave.What we consider as real “slavery” is indeed only one form of slavery. TheAfrican slaves in the United States were compelled to work and toil for otherpeople's benefit. Their lives were mostly controlled for the benefit of themaster, but they had some very limited freedoms. Some were able to createdistinct traditions and maintain families. They did their best to build joy intotheir lives despite the tyranny wrought upon them.Because they were in control of portions of their lives, were they free? Howmuch freedom does a person deserve? How much freedom can be destroyed before werecognize that it is evil?Slavery is not a concept of totality. Slavery exists wherever the freedom of manis destroyed. Theft and bullying are slavery. In history, African natives, Jewsand many others have experienced lifelong slavery. The ultimate slavery ismurder. Slavery stops people from being able to make choices for their ownlives.Everything that restricts your mind, your movements and your speech is evil.Slavery is found in both the partial and complete destruction of freedom.Evil compels you to behave in manners that do not benefit you or those you love.Culture and law exercise overwhelming force in the name of propriety and publicgood. They destroy freedom, and put human lives under other people's control."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3AUTHORITYYou were born to this world with sovereignty over your mind and over your life.Your abilities to think, to feel, to learn and to love are your liberty. In you,these capacities are infinite. You have infinite worth.Evil seeks to destroy your liberty. It seeks to be in authority over you. Itdoes not want you to have liberty. Evil seeks to destroy you so that it can useyou as a puppet.The implementation of evil is called authority. Authorities are what evilimplements as it exercises control over the lives of people. Authority limitsyour ability to learn, to think, to feel, to love and to grow. This is whyauthority is evil.Authorities are not accidents. They are specifically created by intelligentpeople to control you. There are two tools that evil makes use of in order toaccomplish this. Both tools destroy freedom. They are culture and violence.Each of these tools of authority have weapons which are used to attack yourliberty. The weapons of violence are theft, imprisonment, torture, rape anddeath. The weapons of culture are law and the control of speech.Evil is implemented by force in the lives of people. Evil wants you to obey itsauthority. It uses the weapons of violence on everyone who will not obey. Ituses the weapons of culture to sustain whatever obedience it manages to achieve.VIOLENCEYour physical body allows you to exercise principles overevery aspect of reality. With it, you have the tools necessary to interact withthe physical world. Physicality greatly enables you; it is a gift of purefreedom.People obey authority when they are subjected to violence.Violence threatens your physical body. It threatens yourinteraction with the physical world. People who are subjected to violence arecompelled to obey because they want to protect the freedom that their bodiesbring to them. Pain and mutilation limit your ability to interact with yourworld. Death destroysyour freedom completely.The lie of tyranny is that you will maintain the freedom of life by obeyingauthority. The choices it offers you are a lifetime of obedience or death. Evilis the master of deceit. The objective of evil is not violence, but obedience.The purpose of violence is to compel obedience. Its design isthe destruction of freedom. Whether submitting to authority and obeying, orallowing it to destroy you physically, you will have lost your freedom. The onlyway to maintain freedom is to fight tyranny at all times and at all costs.PERSPECTIVEThe cultures of earth offer their people different moralities. Perverteddefinitions of good and evil are found everywhere on the planet. In one culture,a thing is proper, in another it is taboo. In one culture, a word is egregious,in another it is not. Criminal acts are defined entirely differently in opposingcultures.When an authority is established amongst people, evil is either obvious to see,or nearly impossible to see, depending entirely upon whether or not you are apart of its culture. Even though few people are able to recognize the oppressionfound in their own cultures, culture is still oppression.Most people question in horror how an average German soldier could himselfparticipate in the murder of Jews. Most people question in horror how millionsof average people under the umbrella of Communism could bring their brotherscertain death at the hands of police. The examples in history are more thanplentiful; they exist in every culture ever designed.Culture maintains a death grip upon the nature of man. It is not true thathistory's villains misused authority. The truth is that they followed the objectand design of authority perfectly. Tyranny is always disguised as culture andlaw.AUTHORITY PRINCIPLEThe authority principle describes the behavior of people who live under the ruleof law. The authority principle shows that people obey anything and anyone thatthey believe is an authority. Though the who, the why and the what havechanged in history, the behavior of people is the same; they obey.When people are taught that obedience is principle, they obey. When they aretaught that the source of worth and knowledge is found in another person, ratherthan in themselves, they obey. This is the rule of law, and it teaches peoplethat their will is subjective to the will of law and those who control the law.Examples of authorities are governments, bullies, mafias, thieves and kings.People obey authority in their lives either out of fear of violence, or becauseculture conditions them to accept obedience as proper and good. Authoritiesalways use both tools. The most successful authorities do not have to useviolence as often because of the strength of their cultures. Both culture andviolence enforce authority.Under authority, people have obeyed law to the atrocities of history. Themurders, raping and looting under chieftains, kings, emperors, communism andNazis were not perpetuated by small groups of men. They were performed bythousands and even millions of peoples. These people would not havecommitted such egregious evils on their own. If a random person had commandedthem, they would have refused. So why, at the behest of a perceived authority,do they obey?Obedience to authority is the authority principle. People will obey authority nomatter what is asked of them. They obey because they have been lied to. Theyhave been falsely taught that principle is found in law. In history, it isdifficult to imagine why some cultures are so much more violently depraved thanothers. Authority is the reason. Cultures with the least influential authorityare the most peaceful, and by definition, the most free. Cultures with the mostinfluential authorities are the most violent, and by definition, slaves.Anytime you are compelled to act in obedience to authority, you are beinginfluenced by this principle. Evil uses the authority principle to conditionpeople to obey without questioning what, why or whom they are obeying.Destroying your identity to gain power over you is the modus operandi of evil.PATTERN OF TYRANNYTyranny is disguised as culture and law. Everything that evil seeks is thedestruction of freedom—to destroy the value of people. The pattern of tyranny issimple. The object is to enslave the minds of a people by creating a culture ofobedience. To gain the obedience of people, there is a process that must betaken. This process is the pattern of tyranny.WARBefore an authority can be established, war must take place. War is theimplementation of violence. It is the tool that evil uses to establishauthority. All of history's wars have occurred because of a desire to implementa new authority over people. On the smallest scale, this occurs via a process ofthreat and acquiescence. Such is the behavior of bullies, thugs, and mafias. Onthe largest scale, it occurs in violent multi-year battles. Such is the behaviorof nations and empires.ENEMIESIn order to offer people an escape from violence, new authorities teach peoplethat obedience will end war. The design of authority is obedience. Authoritiescondition people to obedience by promising to protect them fromdangerous enemies. Theocracies have used the enemy of blasphemy. The Nazis usedthe Jews. Communists used the rich. Many, many enemies have been created; but byfar the most common is anarchy.PROTECTIONIn order to engineer a culture and pervert the free thinking of men, evil mustcreate an enemy. It is not important to tyrants who the enemy is. Tyrants offerprotection from these enemies in exchange for obedience. Take careful note thatthey offer protection, but obedience is mandatory. Whether or not you wish tohave the authority over you, you will obey or they will revert to violence. Theenemies are only created to ease the burden of obedience from the minds ofpeople. Cultural enemies are an illusion.Benjamin Franklin taught that those who give up liberty to gain security willsoon have neither. This is not an idle observation. The pattern of tyrannyclearly shows that the entire purpose of presenting you with the need forsecurity is to convince you to yield your liberty. That is everything authoritywants. The demand for security is raised by those who seek power over you. Thisis how they create enemies.Make no mistake, it isn’t the enemy that tyrants are after. They are after you.The illusion of cultural enemies is designed to restrict the thinking of people.It is designed to convince people that the real enemy is not the evil that rulesover them, but some imaginary demon that would do them harm. This is the lie oftyranny. It requires your obedience in order to save you. Tyranny is disguisedas culture and law.SOCIAL PROOFAs people begin to submit (under the duress of violence) to the will of a newauthority, a principle known as social proof enters culture. The more peoplethat obey the new authority, the more likely it is that others will follow. Thenormalcy of obedience becomes a part of everyday life.It is natural to want to escape the violence of authority. People who live underthe oppression of nations or thugs will inevitably accept the offer ofobedience. A mugger will offer not to shoot if a wallet is surrendered. Rapistsoffer not to kill if virtue is surrendered. Mafias offer not to torture ifpayment is made. Governments offer not to obliterate life if laws are obeyed.The offer is sweetened with the illusion of enemies. When a person faces certainpain or death on one hand, or protection from an enemy on the other, the will toremain free will eventually break down.LAWLaws are decreed and written to legitimize obedience. Law impersonatesprinciple. People are taught that what is law is right. They are not taught todo what is right, but to obey what is law. The legitimacy of law is the objectof culture. Culture uses law to distort the minds of people into believing thatthey are incapable of seeking truth or living in peace. It teaches that law islegitimate, instead of one's own mind.CONTROL OF SPEECHThe most fundamental weapon of culture is the control of speech. While historyhas shown violent examples of this weapon, it exists in every culture as thecode of propriety. The objective of the control of speech is making sure thatthose who were compelled to bend to the will of authority never gain the courageto look back.In order to maintain obedience, culture demands that everyone it enslavesenforce its will upon those around them. It teaches people to call theirrecalcitrant neighbors weird or insane. It demands that every person turn onthose who fail to obey the precepts of culture. Culture condemns as immoral andanti—social all those who fail to obey its precepts. In this way, culture shapespeople’s minds by restricting their speech.Further, culture endows its evangelists with adjectives such as noble andupstanding. Those who most closely follow the rules of culture, especially incondemning enemies, are rewarded for inflicting stigma upon those less willingto obey. It is this devaluation of the human spirit that proves the evil ofcultural norms.Those who exhibit recalcitrance or suggest rebellion against authority areostracized, berated and demonized. It is hard to endure the lonelinessassociated with fitting outside of popular culture. This is how the control ofspeech is a weapon designed to break the spirit of man. It is a weapon designedto compel you to obedience.Once the people under a culture begin to enforce the control of speech upon eachother, authority has been established. It now rules the very people who enforceits power. This is the design of culture, and authority can now do with you asit pleases.ENFORCEMENTThere are times when authority must revert to violence in order to maintainobedience.There will always be a small minority who refuse to obey the tenets of culturallaw. Because of this, authorities employ a constant stream of violence known aslaw enforcement, or police. These are not police in the defense of liberty, butpolice in the defense of authority. Cultures always teach that liberty andauthority are one and the same; but the design of police is to wield the weaponsof violence in the preservation of authority, not to defend liberty.Authority must also employ violence when cultures break down. Throughouthistory, people have slowly and steadily learned more and more about their ownworth, and hence demanded more and more freedom. Different cultures have fallenas people realized that culture is a lie.When cultures begin to break down, it is because people are learning about theirvalue. Such cultures and the authorities they protect are doomed. Never once inhistory has a culture in decline been redeemed. When authorities see that theirculture is being dismantled, and obedience is no longer theirs to enjoy, theyreturn to violence. These returns to violence are historically extremely brutal.The violent enforcement of law is a sign of coming liberty.EXAMPLETake a look at a generic historical example of the pattern of tyranny. A rougethug gathers together a band of men to extort money from the people nearby wherehe lives. In his success, he plunders massive amounts of money and grows hisgang into an army. He successfully kills the previous officers of lawand enforcement, or subverts them through stealth. Knowing that he can plundermore value in the long term if he leaves his victims alive, he implements a“tax” upon everyone in his range of influence. He draws borders, he givesdecrees. Importantly, he promises his victims that he will protect them from allother thugs. His victims slowly become accustomed to his will, and his lies. Thepeople become afraid if they hear their neighbors talk of escaping the taxes andcruelty. Soon they actively support the regime by targeting all 'treasonous'speech, and turning in deviants to police. Originally called criminal, the thugis now called authority. He is called law and order.This example could have easily described any gang of barbarians from the middleages, or from ancient history. It could apply to any king or emperor of yearspast. It could have described any warlord of today, or any mafia. In fact, itclosely resembles every authority that has ever been established.Once people are conditioned to accept the notion of authority, they normallyobey without thinking. The object of law is obedience, and the destruction offreedom is found in the blindness of this obedience. The authority principleshows that even when a person would normally believe an action to be wrong, ifordered by an authority, they will still perform it.The establishment and exercise of authority over people is called the pattern oftyranny.IN HISTORYIt is easy to follow this pattern through history. Adolf Hitler created an enemyin the Jews. Early on, German culture was manipulated, and Jews were condemnedas “dirty” and “greedy,” a people odd because they “keep to their own kind.”Soon the culture was in place where people were chastised for defending Jews.People who demonized them were championed. Speech was then controlled. NextAdolf Hitler made Jews into the full— fledged enemy. The Jews became responsiblefor all social and economic ills. The solution was to put Adolf Hitler in power,to yield German liberties to him so that he could save them from the enemy. Makeno mistake, Hitler was not after the Jews, he was after the Germans. An evilman, he was simply willing to sacrifice millions of Jews to obtain power. Do notmake the mistake of thinking Hitler was a racist. Follow the pattern. In shortorder he ruled the entire nation and forced all Germans to serve him and hisarmy. His true ambition was not racism, but total world domination.Socialism and communism create the enemy of greed in the same pattern bycontrolling speech. Profit becomes a dirty word, even though it only means thatyou have labored to create a better life. Money becomes evil, even though itsimply represents your work, which is obviously moral. They create the enemy butit is not greed they are after, it is you. If they can convince you that yourmoney and your labors are the enemy, then you will yield those labors and yourmoney to them. Authority is not designed to destroy the enemy; it is designedto enslave youDemocracies create the enemy of anarchy in the same pattern by controllingspeech. It becomes immoral to suggest that one could break the law; it does notmatter which law, or what it says. Nobility is placed on the payment of taxes nomatter how much they demand of you. It is the highest form of cultural proprietyto obey the law, regardless of what it says. The enemy is the fictional anarchy,wherein no individual is safe, because everyone is a tyrant. In order to saveyou from anarchy, you yield authority to the law; you obey. Evil is not afterthe destruction of anarchy, it is after you. If you can see the tyranny in aculture that demands that you obey, no matter what is asked of you and no matterwho writes the laws, then you are beginning to understand the nature of evil.Everything that is evil teaches you that you have limited worth.RULE OF LAWThe rule of law is the single most dangerous idea ever inflicted upon mankind.It has gone by countless names throughout the ages of history. In more basictribes it is known as respect for elders. In the tyranny of royalty, it is knownas nobility, birthright and divinity. In communism it is known as the supremacyof state. In dictatorships it is known as the antidote to anarchy. Intheocracies it is known as revelation.The net teaching of this idea is that you are to obey the law, not because ofits merits or its morality. You are to obey only because it is the law. It isassumed that even if the law is wrong, then it is right to follow because itsupports the system, and the system is more important than you.In order for an intelligent person to choose what is right, they must know whois asking obedience of them, they must consider why it is being asked, and whatit is they are being asked to do. Only then can they decide for themselves ifit is right. This is not what authority wants. Authority is not concerned withyou doing what is right, it is only concerned with obedience.Culture teaches that the nature of the law and what it asks you to do areirrelevant. Culture teaches that obedience is propriety. Culture teaches thatwhen law is created it becomes morality.Law is a weapon. It is used by evil to attack its prey. Whether in the name ofduty to king, loyalty to state, or rule of law, law is the weapon used to extortand control. Culture upholds the nobility of law. Culture teaches that law isproper and good. It never questions who wrote the law; tyrant and brother arethe same. Culture never questions whether or not the law is right. You are toobey no matter what it says. In this fashion, law is a powerful weapon to beused against you. All principalities create volumes of laws that take lifetimesto understand and armies of lawyers to manipulate. All of these things areweapons in the hands of the powerful, which they will use at your expense.Law holds value only to those who create it, and only because your culturedemands that you obey it. The purest invitation to tyranny is your commitment toobey law regardless of what it says. Against you, the law becomes the perfectweapon. Whomever controls the law, controls you. Your worth is measured by theextent of your obedience."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4CULTURECultures are created to protect power structures. Culture is the enforcer ofauthority.Culture distorts principles in order to defend the authority of evil. Culturemust convince you that it is not wrong when law subjugates your worth anddestroys your freedom. Culture convinces people of this by perverting theconcept of morality.Morality is liberty. Immorality is evil. The exercise and defense of freedom aremoral. The destruction of freedom is immoral. This is the pure truth ofmorality.Prudence is the proper application of principle. Imprudence is foolishness.Prudence is not morality. It is not immoral to kick a heavy stone with your barefoot, but it would probably be foolish. Prudence is a question of applying theprinciples and wisdom you have gathered in your life to achieve the goalsyou have for yourself. This is made possible by liberty. Without liberty,prudence is meaningless. Morality must come before prudence.The great lie of culture is that authority is not bound by morality, and thatauthority can enforce its own prudence upon you. The great lie of culture isthat you are worth less than law.Cultures teach that intentions of prudence can be enforced by law. In thisfashion they gain excuse to control the lives of people.In order for people to learn, grow, and find happiness, people must be free totest their understanding of principles. With freedom, they can do this by aprocess of faith, trial and error. In this fashion children grow from immaturityto maturity. In this fashion human beings gain wisdom.Cultures are agents of evil. The objective of evil is the damnation of yourability to grow strong in wisdom. The objective of evil is the destruction ofyour worth. In order to gain control over you, culture spreads the lie thatauthority is not bound by morality. It teaches that authority can destroyfreedom at will, and claims prudence as the reason you should willingly submit.In the name of defending you, culture claims that the destruction of freedom ismorality. Cultures pretend that evil is good and that good is evil.Prudence can be found all around you. It is found in the choices you make everyday. Even when a mistake is made, you learn prudence. Prudence cannot beenforced. To enforce prudence is law. Law is lie. Without the freedom to choose,you cannot learn prudence. You cannot be happy.Morality can be found all around you. Wherever you find it, you will find joy.Wherever you find immorality, you will find misery. Culture enforces authorityby destroying freedom with law. This is immorality.CONTROL OF SPEECHSpeech is controlled by culture because speech advances wisdom. Humancommunication accelerates growth and learning on an exponential scale. Peoplelearn principles on their own through experimentation with their environment,but they learn far quicker when they are able to communicate theirthoughts through speech. Speech is the single most powerful tool of humanity.Through it, children and adults alike accelerate knowledge in anything theydesire to learn.Culture cannot afford the rapid spread of human understanding. Should peoplelearn their own worth and potential, they would never submit to the artificialauthorities placed over them. Culture is about control.Cultures are designed to protect the powerful, to protect those in authority.Its job is to make sure that speech cannot flow freely. To accomplish this, itestablishes a pattern of subversion of thought and propriety of speech.AUTHORITY IS UNQUESTIONABLECulture first labels the questioning of authority as immoral. The rule of law,absolute respect for law enforcement, character in politics, and the nobility ofking are all examples of cultural subversion of thought. Culture cannot allowpeople to question their allegiance to a specific law, or a specific king, ora specific system of authority. Instead it teaches that these things are abovequestion. It is never permitted to question the king, dictator, or democracy. Inevery culture ever devised, authority is supreme over humanity.The highest extreme of questioning authority is discussing the assassination ofauthorities. Even to print a line of text such as this will bring shivers tothose who live under any culture. This is the grip that culture has upon speech.Questioning whether authority is right or wrong is not allowed. The system isabove you, you will not fight back. Though law considers itself moral fordefending itself with violence, it will teach you that you are immoral foreven thinking about defending yourself against it.Lesser taboos on questioning authority exist in varying form in the cultures ofhistory. In modern times this is most obvious in the shame brought upon anyonewho questions the respectability of police, public education teachers or otherpublic employees. Their work is considered to be above the work of everyoneelse. Their actions in their jobs are beyond reproach because they are agents ofauthority. It is sometimes called “respect for the office” or position.Questioning their right to interfere with your life will bring you the scorn ofculture. This is the control of speech.Further examples exist in the belief that paying taxes is noble. Not one personwould pay them if they didn't have to. Not one person pays a dollar more than isdemanded of them under threat of imprisonment. And yet throughout culture youhear people speak of the nobility of paying taxes. “Taxpayer” is the title givenby those seeking legitimacy in political arguments. Culture teaches that goodpeople are those who allow themselves to be extorted and controlled withoutthinking.Obedience to arbitrary law under the rule of law is labeled character. The moredestructive a law is to humanity, the more praise of nobility culture will giveto them who obey it.If authority is not questioned, if it is accepted as the proper ruler over man,slavery is the result. Germans failed to question the culture imposed upon themby the National Socialist Party. Their servitude to Adolf Hitler and his warmachine were the result. Billions failed to question the culture of“brotherhood” championed by communism. Totalitarian slavery and the deaths of ahundred million people was the result. Large or small, when you yield your mindto culture, it will make a tool of you for its own purpose. It begins when youlimit your speech out of fear of culture.DIVERSION OF PROPRIETYThe next step in the cultural manipulation of speech is the creation ofpropriety and politeness. These define the artificial enemies of society thatculture would have you focus on instead of authority. They are designedarbitrarily to divert attention from the evil of authority. What would the world be like if you were free to open your mouth? The minds ofpeople are tethered under ideas called cultural propriety, political correctnessand politeness.Political correctness is engineered slavery. It focuses attention on controllingthe speech of people in such a way that they believe the enemy of people isimpoliteness. They are taught to believe that they are naturally racist, sexistand bigots. Only when culture keeps a tight control on speech are people safefrom their own demons. Culture teaches the limited value of people.Coarseness of language is the shameful speaking of words or concepts outside thepropriety of culture. While there is nothing evil in a word, and languages arereinvented and molded every day, culture would have us believe that the words weuse are where evil lives, instead of the crushing of the human spirit employedby authority. A curse is a wish of harm upon a person. Swearing is an oath ofaction. Yet both of these things have been perverted so as to teach you thatspeech is what is evil, and not the destruction of freedom that evil peopleemploy.Every time you find an element of speech that is culturally unacceptable tospeak, you will find a scapegoat. The specific instance is irrelevant; culturealways creates propriety to hide tyranny. In the beginning of the NationalSocialist movement of Germany, culture was engineered to make defending a Jewunseemly. It likewise made it impolite to challenge those who condemned Jews.This pattern is found in every culture ever created. Nazi culture was not afterthe control of the Jews, it was after control of the Germans.CHOICEIn order to free yourself from the slavery of speech control, you mustunderstand the principle of personal offense. If you are offended by a word or asentence, then you have chosen anger and hurt for yourself. Culture would haveyou believe that it has been forced upon you, but this is not true.Culture would have you believe that evil is found in the discussion of ideas, orthe passing of intentional or unintentional insults. It would have you believethat certain words, or allusions are where evil is to be found within society.If evil can create the enemy of speech, it can convince you to yield to itscontrol. This is the design and purpose of culture.Though people always feel entirely justified in taking offense at speech, it isnonetheless their full choice. They have the freedom to feel anything they wantwhen they hear the mind of another person. Yet the solution offered by cultureis to force speech into a manner conducive to culture's taste. Once you believethat the control of speech is noble, you will not wonder at why it is improperto question authority.CRUSHING THE HUMAN SPIRITWhile arbitrary culture is found amongst adults everywhere on earth, it is mosteasily viewed amongst children. Culture creates ideas of style compulsion, bodyimage compulsion and action compulsion. To prefer pink over blue is a personalpreference. To wear blue because you fear wearing pink is thedestruction brought by arbitrary culture.Cultures limit the choices available to people by creating arbitrary rules foryour life, and enforcing them with peer pressure. Crushing the spirit of peopleallows culture to gain their obedience.When people fear standing tall because they believe they are not sufficientlyattractive, wealthy or educated, culture is crushing their spirit by teachingthem that they have limited worth. People who do not know their own value areeasy to control.The pressures applied amongst children are a paradigm of the culture of morepowerful evil. Those children who are the most adept at understanding how toconform to cultural norms and apply the strictest enforcement against everyoneelse are the ones who gain social power. This is a type and a shadow ofthe culture of nations and kings.A model citizen of culture is one who patterns themselves precisely to theideals of culture. In premise, this means style, speech, education andeconomics. In reality, this means obedience. Culture teaches people to idolizethe perfect citizen. It does so because it desires your obedience as well.These people are rewarded by society for being easily molded by culture. Thepowers of authority and compulsion in all walks of life will always reward themodel citizens with tokens of nobility and will always punish those who fail tomeet the standards of servitude with humiliation and ridicule. Such is thecreation of a culture. Such is the making of slaves.This breakdown of the human spirit eventually forces everyone to conform. Veryfew will even think of fighting the power structure, almost everyone acceptsauthority.ARROGANCE VERSUS CONCEITCulture teaches that arrogance is an unwarranted valuation of self. You are abeing of unlimited value, culture is lying to you.Arrogance is condemned by culture because culture does not want people tounderstand how much they are worth. It purposely confounds the meanings ofarrogance and conceit. Conceit is believing that you are more valuable thanothers. All people have infinite value. To be conceited is to degrade the valueof those around you. Authority is the ultimate conceit. It lays people low lestthey believe that it is they, and not law which has value.Arrogance is an understanding of your own worth. Culture condemns it in order tosuggest that you are really not of sufficient value to do, say, or accomplishthings that you desire. Arrogance offends others because they have been taughtby culture their entire lives that they have little or no value. They are hurtby the misunderstanding that arrogant people are better than they are. They aretaught that arrogance is conceit.If people were not so easily swayed by the doctrines of culture, they wouldrecognize that all people have equal value. When they see the arrogance of aperson who has faith in themselves above that of their own, they would rejoice.If an arrogant person has great value, then so do they. Culture condemnsarrogance in order to crush the spirit of faith.Without culture, people would allow themselves to revel in the inspiration thatarrogant people provide. The arrogance to believe that we can fly, cure diseaseand accomplish wonders! The arrogance to suggest that you can govern yourself.ENTHUSIASM AND EXCITEMENTEnthusiasm for life is frequently ridiculed by culture. Those who are excited bythe wonder and beauty of our world are in danger of understanding how much theyare worth. This is not something that culture can allow.Excitement and enthusiasm are allowed only in limited and predefined forms.Every culture is different, but they all provide 'acceptable' directions andoutlets for excitement. These outlets divert the arrogant expression ofenthusiasm so that others will not be inspired.Culture dismisses achievement as impossible for the average person. It teachesthat most people can expect only limited success in their life. It teachespeople to accept that dreams are unreachable. Without exception, the reason thatdreams are so hard to reach is because of culture. Laws, control, andthe crushing of the human spirit limit our ability to achieve.ONLY HUMANCulture has many variations of the phrase “only human” in every language. Thephrase implies the ultimately limited value of people. The phrase is a lie.People have an unlimited capacity for intelligence. Things in the realm of thesupernatural in ancient times are commonplace today. Principles that areamazingly complex become simple to intelligent beings as they are understood.With freedom, the more you grow in learning, the more wisdom opens your mindto the purity of our reality.Cultures frequently teach that intelligence is hereditary. In conjunction withthe notion that the powerful are more intelligent, this teaching is designed toimply that those in authority rightfully belong there. It is designed to teachthat the intelligence of people is limited by the physical construction of theirbrains. Those not in authority are obviously not qualified to rule themselves.Culture needs people to accept limitation in order to swallow obedience.GLORIFICATION OF HISTORIC EVILSContemporary culture has a tendency to romanticize the evils of history.Genocidal warlords such as Alexander are given the title “Great”. Royal mastersare bestowed with the honor of having been a “good king”. Communism's slavery isvenerated under the pretense that Joseph Stalin was the reason the systemfailed. The murders of law enforcement are painted white under the banner ofdefending the rule of law. Bloodbaths are idealized in the loyalty of armies.Culture would have us ignore the nature of history. It would have us believethat they are fantasies and stories, instead of the struggle of humanity againstevil. Billions have lost their lives struggling against tyranny. The lesson ofhistory is not the honor of slaves, or the good of a system or the nobility of aking. It is the nature of evil that we must learn. Do not let culture cloud yourknowledge of history by glorifying tyranny.This clouding of tyranny is found in every culture on earth today, and obscuresthe same tyranny found in the past. Those who facilitated tyranny served as theenablers of authority. “I am just doing my job.” Culture will not question whatthe job was. Culture will not allow you to believe that people haveany responsibility to disobey the evil of authority. Nazis, communists andwarlords alike; culture teaches us that the average butcher of history was justdoing his job.Culture glorifies the evils of history and teaches that today's blind obedienceto authority is nobility. The same blinding of the mind used by the cultures ofthe past is used by culture today. How correct law pretends itself to be isirrelevant. In order to enforce authority you must destroy liberty.OBEDIENCEObedience to authority is the only objective of culture. It has a thousandfacets, and a million lies, but its design is always obedience.Chivalry was the code of honor created by royalty in the middle ages. This honorconsisted of blind adoration of knights and noblemen. Peasants and serfs weretaught that those who ruled over them and enforced the law of the king werealways respectable and moral. The objective was the obedience of human beings toauthority. The teaching of chivalry was that the knights of law enforcement hadmore value than everyone else.Patriotism is the code of honor created by nations in modern times. This honorconsists of total allegiance to whomever controls the nation at the moment.Patriotism offers no choice. You cannot choose which nation to support; you area slave by birth. You cannot refuse obedience, all law has total claim to you.Patriotism teaches that the nation is glorious and strong, and that people havevalue only in as much as they bow to it.The rule of law is the code of honor created by democracy. It teaches that honoris found in obedience to the law. This code teaches that you cannot examine whatthe law says, or who wrote it or why. The rule of law demands total obedience.Law is a weapon, and obedience is its design. The rule of law equatescriminality with morality. The rule of law teaches that law has more value thanpeople.All cultures call disobedience treason, and scare people with ideas of treacheryagainst what is right and proper. Treason is the premise that it is wrong todisobey the interests of authority. The truth is that it is wrong to compelothers to action against their will. Since authority is always a creature offorce, the claims of law are immoral and irrelevant. There is no such thing astreason.SLAVES AS ENFORCERSThose who are under the limitation of culture will enforce culture's doctrinesupon others. Culture teaches that morality is found in obedience, and so thosewho believe that authority is rightfully exercised over people will demand thattheir friends and neighbors behave according to culture's will.This is the treachery of culture. It convinces people that slavery is morality.It desires only obedience, and people return it in droves. It convinces peoplethat the destruction of freedom is morality. It pretends that evil is good, andthat good is evil. All who would speak against authority in the defense offreedom are condemned.At its strongest form, culture is able to convince its people to become soldiersand murder, plunder and conquer new peoples. It has happened in every empire. Ithas happened in every kingdom and nation. From Nazi warlords to barbarianhordes, and from lynch mobs to law enforcement, authority is expanded andretained by violence.Those who participate in furthering the goals of evil are given the titles of“bravery” and “honor” by culture.SYMBOLS OF AUTHORITYCulture seeks to enforce authority by impressing upon the minds of people thatthey are inferior to law. When people believe that they are worth less than law,they will believe that it is their rightful place to obey.The symbols that authority uses to create the illusion that people have limitedworth are very similar throughout history. The robes of modern judges compare tothe robes of royalty. The wigs of late European politics compare to the crownsof royalty. The uniforms of law enforcement and the armor of knights. Captain,general, senator, magistrate, sheriff, prince, lord. Titles, clothing and badgeshave been used in every culture in history to create the illusion of authority.Culture focuses the mind on symbols such as honor, loyalty, devotion and duty.Such symbols are not new. It is easy for most people to recognize thefoolishness of loyalty to king, dictator or communism. However, people stillfall to modern symbols such as law, democracy and patriotism. If the objectiveof a symbol is obedience, it is evil.Police officers carry badges to show that they are duly authorized enforcers ofthe law. They enforce the law upon you, but you did not authorize them. This isthe illusion of authority. Culture hides tyranny behind the trappings ofmeaningless symbolism. It would have you believe that law is authorized to reignover you however it pleases. It hides the fact that only you can give thatpermission. Instead, it presumes permission by birthright, or by the geometry ofyour location relative to its borders. It is an illusion.Should law truly be the authorized agent of defense or production, it would haveto receive the permission of every single person it claims to represent. Itwould have to allow every person to extricate themselves from that authority iflaw failed to meet its obligation.Law never seeks permission and never will. It does not represent you, itrepresents evil.MONEY AND GREEDMoney is good. Culture has invented the lies of money's evil so that authoritycan more easily lay claim to it. Authority can take your ambition for improvingyour life by demonizing your labors. Culture teaches people that desiringgreater comforts is selfish and greedy. It teaches that money is a mysteriousevil. The more money is condemned, the easier it is to steal from you.Greed does not exist amongst free people. Greed is not the love of money. Thelove of money is only the love of a better life. Greed is the theft of money,and it exists only among tyrants.There is no end to the amount of improvement you can have in your life. There isno limit to humanity's ability to cure disease, to end hunger and to enjoy life.Culture would have you believe that you are limited. Culture teaches that youare not worthy of achieving your dreams.There is no greed in desiring more, there is only greed in stealing the laborsof another. Theft is evil. It is the nature of authority to steal. Only tyrantsposses greed.When culture teaches that working for money is greed, it also teaches that laborwithout money is noble. Laboring by rule of law for the collective “we” istaught as the proper form of ambition. If you cannot choose to give or to keep,then you are not “we;” you are a slave.SUIT OF LAWLaw is a weapon. Authority establishes itself as the only means of defense.Because of this, people have no recourse against the law. Law is designed toenslave all who obey it.There are many people who are able to use the law to extort. Lawyers and thievesregularly band together in democracies to loot the valuables of people. It iscommonplace to fear behaviors and speech because they will be used as a pretensefor extortion.The idea of law that licenses extortion is liability. This idea teaches that oneman is responsible for the failures of another. It is commonly accepted as anoble principle of justice. It is not justice – it is a lie. Liability is not aprinciple; principles need no enforcement. The reason liability laws areenforced is to extract massive sums of money from anybody who happens to be ableto pay.Liability teaches that you have a responsibility under law to prevent thefailures of others – if you have more money than they do. In a free world,people's actions are their own, and their failures bring consequences. Thoseconsequences of principle are necessary to the growth and understanding ofhumanity. Law twists the consequences and assigns liability by fiat.Law confounds our understanding of true principles with obfuscation. This isdone to enslave and extort.COLLECTIVISMCulture teaches the worthiness of the common good employed by force. It teachesthat it is acceptable to issue law to advance a collective ideal. Whether to payfor a project, or control behavior, compulsion is frequently labeled “publicinterest.”If these things are truly for the benefit of people, why must they be forced inorder to accomplish them? Remember the difference between principle and law;principle requires no enforcement. No law is required in order for people tofeed and shelter themselves. If something must be done by force in order toaccomplish it, then it is not a good thing, it is only something that authoritywants.All government, all violence, and all laws are methods of forcing you to yieldmoney or motive without your permission. If these were things that trulyprovided benefit to you, then you would do them willingly. In a free market, youget only that which you pay for. In government, you can easily get anything youwant at the expense of others. Those who have the most to take are the easiestto rob.Culture uses ideas such as “the working class” and “the rich.” These ideas haveno meaning, since all classes work, and even the poor of today are rich comparedto the rest of history. These ideas are just tools of cultural manipulation. Ifculture can create social classes and convince you that they are at war, then itcan hide its own tyranny.Culture creates collectivism with individual-crushing labelssuch as “we” and “our.” People are taught that within a nation, they are “our”children, rather than the parent's. Culture teaches that “we” want laws andtaxation, and that “we” fight wars. The destruction of the individual incollectivism directly serves the purpose of evil.Collectivism teaches that good things can come from compulsion. It teaches thatpeople can be forced to accomplish things “for their own good.” It pirates thelove people have for their neighbors and twists it into authority's demands.Slavery is the result. If an individual will not choose a thing, then it is notgood for him. Force crushes the human spirit. Choice enables life.MORALITY AND VALUESEvil is not found in the stupidity of man. Evil is found in the slavery of man.Law impersonates morality. Culture teaches the ultimate infallibility of law inorder to compel obedience. Even when law is wrong, culture teaches that themoral thing to do is to obey.Law presumes to enforce prudence on people by calling it morality. This is theultimate deceit. Morality is freedom. Law destroys freedom and calls itmorality.Freedom is the cure for imprudence. All the social ills that law presumes tocorrect exist because people are not free to learn and grow. With limitedability for growth, principles are confused and foolish behavior is the frequentresult. Freedom brings wisdom, peace and prosperity. The history offreedom shows this clearly.Force and compulsion destroy the value of human beings and dissolve the will oftheir spirit. Evil steals the sovereignty you have over your own life. Nothingrighteous can come from the destruction of freedom.SANITYCulture teaches that only “nuts” and “crazies” challenge authority. Law is theholiest and most sacred emblem of culture.Insanity is not an inability to perceive reality; it is a willing rejection ofreality in favor of the artificial constructs of tyranny. Law threatens violenceupon all who refuse to obey it. When you chose to act upon an artificial view ofreality, you are insane. People obey law out of fear of death, until they can beproperly cultured to accept the rule of law without question. Culturalindoctrination is insanity. The definition of insanity is blind obedience.It is insane to believe that those in power over people rightfully belong there.It is insane to assume that they will always be there. It is insane to believethat law has the right to command the obedience of people. The culture ofroyalty, the culture of patriotism and the culture of law are all insanity.No human being who understands the fullness of their own worth would ever acceptthe notion that someone ought to rule over them. It is the function of cultureto blind the eyes of people to their own worth, and to deafen their ears to anyspeech that may teach them. When cultural influence is at its peak, insanityravages the mind. Obedience is the object of authority, and authority wants nopossibility of rebellion. The definition of insanity is blind obedience.DEFENSE OF FREEDOMCulture teaches that only police have the right to defend. It teaches that onlyauthority has the right to decide if you are worthy of defense, and what levelof defense it will provide. While it teaches that it is never acceptable for youto defend yourself, culture teaches that when the law implements kidnapping andmurder to enforce its authority, it is always acceptable.In order to remove all thought of people fighting their masters, culture teachesthat revolt is never acceptable. Rebellion without violence is almost alwaysimpossible. Culture ensures that authority holds a monopoly on violence, and ithas no compunction about kidnapping, imprisonment and murder. The only way toescape authority is to destroy all tyranny. This is the reason massive wars havebeen necessary to destroy entrenched tyrants such as Adolf Hitler.Culture controls speech to stop authority from being questioned. It createsideas of propriety to hide its own tyranny. The only remaining element is tomake sure that if someone does discover their own worth, that they cannotextricate authority from their lives. This is done by making the defense offreedom immoral.The price of freedom is blood. The reason for this is simple: evil does not careif you live or die. It will kill you before it yields control over your life toyou. Hundreds of millions have died in history's wars proving this principle.Every instance of a thug maiming, raping or killing an innocent person provesthis principle. While the vast majority of people are not evil, there arepowerful tyrants who will never yield; they are men who will scorch the earth inorder to gain or maintain authority.The only way to end tyranny is to destroy every tyrant. The more that tyrantsare allowed to work the devices of culture upon people, the harder tyranny is toextricate, and the more lives it will cost to do so. This is the reason thatculture teaches that the only proper way for you to defend yourself against lawis to obey the law. The teaching preserves tyranny. One hundred million peoplehave died at the hands of communists because so few were willing to ignore thelaw, and instead do what was right. Europe was nearly obliterated because somany people valued the law more than liberty; they failed to stop Adolf Hitlerwhile he was still weak.Removing the true nature of violence from news and relegating its understandingto the artificial violence of entertainment teaches people that there is safetyin slavery. News reports enable authority when the true cost of tyrannyis removed from view. Culture hides the plainest images of blood from people inorder to keep them passive.In reality, evil will stop at nothing to control you, including destroyingeverything you have and everyone you love. Violence is used in the preservationof tyranny every day. Violence and murder are only weapons of immorality whenused to destroy freedom. The defense of freedom is never immoral. Any man whowill wield the weapons of violence against innocent people in order to gainauthority must be destroyed."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5TACTICSThere is no such thing as anarchy, there is only tyranny.All cultures teach the nobility of authority. All pretend to defend the securityof people against enemies who would do harm. The common thread amongst everyauthority in history is the universal enemy of anarchy.While cultures have added racism, economy, terrorism, nationalism, and countlessother enemies to the mix, anarchy exists as the enemy of every culture.There is no such thing as anarchy. You will not kill your neighbor in theabsence of police. You are not evil. Those who wish this type of control andviolence over others teach you that you are not worthy of ruling yourself. Theyteach that you lack intelligence, self-control and value. They teach that onlygovernment can rule you. The word government means tyranny. It exists toestablish ownership of you.You need no governing. You are a human being and as such have infinite worth.You and you alone rightfully control your actions, your speech and your labor.All who seek these things of you must receive your permission first. All who donot, are evil.Anarchy is a lie. It is created by tyrants to deceive you. There is no suchthing as anarchy, there is only tyranny.ROYALTYFrom the earliest days of man, there have been those who looked around them andsaw others as tools to be used. Instead of building themselves up in wisdom andunderstanding where infinite prosperity is possible, they designed on thelaziness of theft and control. In primitive form, these are men who would usesuperior physical strength and the threat of violence to cower people. Thedemands they made were simple: money. The stronger men could live off the workof others.The success of such men is measured in modern culture's terms for them. Some arethugs and brutes, others barbarians and bandits. Because of their limitedsuccess and unending brutality, such evil rarely held people in bondage forlong. Revolts and power struggles were common. It was extremely difficult fora person to maintain his grip of extortion over people.As history progressed, men of significantly more cunning devised the element ofcontrol necessary to stabilize power over people. This element is culture.Instead of extortion and brutality, they created the notions of rightful rule,and royalty. Their objective was to preclude the people from revolt by teachingthem that their authority was legitimate. This is the singular objective of allculture.For thousands of years the culture of royalty enslaved all of humanity under thenames chief, king and emperor. All titles of nobility were designed to reinforcethe image of familial loyalty. People who are naturally respectful anddeferent towards their families were taught that royalty was the greater family.The king was, in all cultures, viewed as something between a father and a god.This idolatry of the family is the cornerstone of royalty.People were taught that to obey nobility was the greater form of respectingtheir father and mother. Culture's objective was to twist the understanding ofpeople so that they believed that extortionists held a rightful place in theirlives. The result was that people rarely fought back.Every aspect of the culture of royalty taught people concepts such as nobility,loyalty, duty and honor. Each of these ideas are lies; they are designed toteach people that their worth is less than the worth of the king. Without thetrappings of culture, he would simply be a thug taking food and labor at thepoint of a sword. With it, he is His Majesty, the King. All culture is liedesigned specifically to keep the powerful in power.HISTORY OF FREEDOMAs the era of kings was closing, cultures began to disintegrate and freedomgrew. This was precipitated by two very specific and very powerful attacksagainst royalty: the Magna Carta and the Declaration of Independence.Every time cultures are attacked people begin to learn more about their value.When rebellion spread among people of astounding courage, culture lost its gripand people were able to see that there was no king who had claim upon them. Theystarted to see a glimpse of their own worth.The engineers of evil understood that the world had finally learned how to seepast the culture of royalty. With the astonishing speed of only a fewgenerations, they engineered the culture of nations to replace it.Under the umbrella of nationality, people are slaves to borders more than at anytime in history. The power of “my king” has been replaced by theculturally superior “our country.” Nations have caused greater death and slaverythan any degree of royalty ever envisioned.The history of freedom shows that even as nations grow strong, the culturallessons from royalty have been learned. Freedom progresses around the world aspopulation increases. Cultures are destroyed by freedom routinely, and thelessons of each new tactic of deceit are being learned around the world.The violence of nations increases as the cries of freedom are raised. Hundredsof millions have been murdered and billions enslaved in recent history; all infutile attempts by evil men to stay in power. As the stability of their empiresis challenged they rain blood upon the heads of their protectorates.The history of freedom shows that such violence is not the growth of evil, butits death. Violence and the enforcement of law are necessary only when culture'sgrip fails to effectively control the minds of people. The death of kings, thetransitions of nations, the mutations of culture and the violence of governmentsare evidence of the end of evil. Authorities of all kinds are struggling forbreath in a world that is learning how to drown them forever. In the world youand I occupy, the war is already won.We have only to watch evil die.NATIONSNations are a generic umbrella of culture that prove extremely effective forauthorities. Nations use commonality in race, language and heritage to persuadeownership of people. Their only shared agent is the border.As the cultures of royalty disintegrated, nations were created to replace them.Authority sough the same stability of extortion that kingdoms provided, butneeded to escape the understanding that people had learned about the tyranny ofroyalty. They created a new enemy, called “them,” and a new culture called “we.”Nations drew lines across the globe and eventually swallowed up every inch ofinhabitable land known to man. All those who live within these lines become theproperty of the state. They are taught that they own their governments by meansof democracy, communism, theocracy and race. They are taught that their nationsbelong to them. This is the culture of “we.” The truth is that their nations ownthem.Nations are created and borders drawn to create stability for authority. Whileroyalty improved stability by convincing people that they owed allegiance toauthority, nations took a bigger step and taught people that they were theauthority. National cultures deceive the minds of people to more effectivelyextort money and control.As soon as you lend credibility to a predatory institution, they will make preyof you. Disguised as sheep, they will have you believe that they are defendingyou from anarchy, or any other kind of enemy they can devise. Their laws do notspeak of these enemies; they speak of you, how much money you owe, and what youwill do for them.Government is an agent of force. As soon as power is yielded to authority, assoon as you give it license to take life and liberty, it becomes an agent ofevil. Evil men who seek authority over you will not fight government. All evilthat wants is power over you. Evil naturally seeks its place in government.There have been many forms of nations created, all with varying degrees ofeffectiveness in their control. Without exception, the strongest governments arethose whose culture most effectively convinces people that the people are thegovernment. All others soon fall. This is why democracies are the strongest formof nation possible. They are introduced last.COMMUNISM AND SOCIALISMSocialism, communism and welfare states all have different applications inhistory and idea; yet they are all exactly the same. They all teach people thatthey are unable to effectively produce enough to support their own lives. Theyare given the enemies of greed and destitution as the reasons why authority isneeded in their lives.Communism is the second most effective form of evil that has ever existed, andit is the most destructive ever achieved. Communism taught that people requireequality of materials rather than the freedom to create. Communism used the liethat people would be part owners of the government in order to garner theirsupport for slave labor and soldiering.Anybody reading the implementation of communism—or its similar constructs—shouldreadily see evil. There is nothing wrong with a community helping each other.There is no sin in sacrifice or giving. But as with all culture, these ideaswere lies. There is no sacrifice in communism and socialism, and there is nogiving. They are always implemented by force. Socialism and welfare teach that people do not own their own labors. Theydistract people with cultural ideals of duty and brotherhood. Their true natureis the nature of force. Nothing in welfare and socialism is done by choice.Everything is implemented under threat of violence. As with all culture, welfareand socialism are evil.Tyranny has destroyed countless more lives than poverty could even dream. Intimes of poverty only one thing stands in the way of people: government.Governments use violence to restrict freedom and therefore people's ability tobetter their lives. Under the pretense of ending poverty, authorities have usedcompulsion and violence to create more death and destruction than any storm, anyfamine, any drought.It is the element of force that belies the tyranny of all socialistic ideals.Without force, there is no evil in them. With force, they are the same as anyother government. They bring misery to humanity.DICTATORSA dictator bears similarity to the kings of royalty while maintaining a cultureof nationalism.There is the common belief in history that dictators and kings are noble. Anytime a national culture is strong, leaders are thought of as pure and righteous.Joseph Stalin and Adolf Hitler are just two examples. After their deaths, theirpeople were shocked to learn that the atrocities of their nations were createdby them. History records endless testimonies of people who believed that theterror in their lives was happening without these leaders' knowledge. NationalSocialists actually viewed the terror they brought to Europe as a defensive war.Wherever you see culture supporting an authority, or trying to implement anauthority, you will find the destruction of freedom. In every culture people aredeceived into believing that authority is good. Even when they can see thetyranny of authority in history, they fail to see it in their own culture.The greatest mistakes of history have been those of inaction. Killing a manbecause he advocates the destruction of liberty sounds extreme to people of allcultures. Culture indoctrinates people with this thinking. Yet the logic ofkilling Adolf Hitler, Mao Tse Tung and Vladimir Lenin instead of allowing themto destroy the liberty and lives of billions is unavoidable. The idea of killinga dictator in cold blood before they murder millions is offensive because thecultures who protect these leaders design themselves that way. And so evilprospers.Peace is found when people stand for morality and reject culture. Defend freedomat all costs and at all times and peace will rule the world instead of tyrants.MORALITY ENFORCEDCultures love teaching people that morality is properly enforced. It is theultimate deceit, a powerful lie.Cultures teach that morality and prudence are one in the same. Culture caneasily claim authority over people when they believe that doing somethingfoolish is the same as doing something evil.Morality is freedom. Immorality is the destruction of freedom. Morality is good,immorality is evil. Culture would have you believe that morality is a questionof personal vice. It pretends that imprudence is the same thing as immorality.When people believe that enforcing prudence is the same as defending liberty,they can be used to support dramatic increases in the power of authority overpeople.The inquisitions of medieval times used the ideas of enforcing morality toexpand the power of the Roman church. They created law and enforcement to forcechurch government into people's lives. It was culturally acceptable because theywere enforcing 'morality' instead of simple arbitrary control.The American prohibition of alcohol was touted as a way to counter the effectsof alcohol's control over people. In order to fight that control, the USgovernment established a massive police force to control the lives of people.Those who would force prudence on people teach that people are not able to learnintelligent behaviors on their own. Culture teaches that people must not be freeto make personal mistakes; it teaches that people are not worthy of ruling theirown lives. Without freedom, prudence is meaningless.ENVIRONMENTALISMEnvironmentalism shares the ideals of communism. It teaches that greed is theenemy, and that those in search of money will destroy the earth. The enemy ofgreed is the same enemy that communism employs. It is the same lie. They bothteach that without authority, free people will destroy themselves. They bothteach that government is necessary to enforce security.Environmentalism has one new twist on the ancient lies of evil. It teaches thatthe dirt you stand on is more valuable than you. It teaches that authority isnecessary to ensure that you do not destroy it. As with all evil, it really onlycares that you obey. What excuse people choose to follow is of no concern toevil.Culture teaches that the only security to be found in life is in government.Only they can secure your water, your air and your food. Yield authority tothem. The strength of environmentalism is that it can be used to regulate everyaspect of your life. Transportation, food, housing, energy and communication;they all fall under this umbrella of regulation and control. Environmentalism isjust one more excuse to implement slavery.BUREAUCRACYIt is extremely important to see that bureaucracy is not just an inconvenience.The slavery of bureaucracy lies in force and compulsion.Those under its power are taught to overlook bureaucracy asjust another fact of life. The truth is that bureaucracy does not sustain orimprove life, it drains it. The culture of bureaucracy is incredibly strong inmany areas of the world. It is able to convince people that they are free whilesubjecting themto ream of licensing, fees, permissions, and reporting requirements. Failure toobey results in fines, imprisonment or death. This is their freedom.Bureaucracy benefits primarily those who make their money from it. These aregovernment employees and controllers.One of their favored tactics in achieving new regulation is the stacking oflaws. An example is safety requirements like helmet and seat belt laws. Suchthings presume goodness, but evil doesn't care if you are safe, it only caresthat you are forced. Bureaucrats make the case for new regulations byleveraging previous regulation. They may extort money for the purpose of payingmedical costs for trauma victims, they can then claim the need for helmet andseat belt laws because they are obligated to pay medical costs. A bureaucrat'ssolution to problems created by law is more law. Their obvious objective is lawitself.TERRORISMTerrorism has nothing to do with America, and nothing to do with religion.Terrorism follows the pattern of tyranny precisely. Many areas of the world aredramatically affected by increasing technology. As messages and images offreedom reach new corners of the world, people begin to see the tyranny oftheir own cultures.As culture loses its grip on people, authority increases its violence. Terrorismis authority attempting to teach people that freedom is depravity andcorruption. Terrorism is authority attempting to teach people that freedom isanarchy, that freedom is to be feared.Terrorism has been used throughout history to coerce populations to yield theirauthority and governance to those hungry for power and lacking of conscience.Terrorism is rarely used against those over whom power is sought. Hitler'sterrorism against the Jews is a formidable example of the use of terror to gainpower over the German people. Al Qaeda exemplifies the use of terrorism againstAmerican peoples in order to maintain power and influence over Islamic peoples.Terrorism is proof of the pattern of liberty. It is precisely because tyrannicalstates are afraid of losing the grip they have had over their peoples for solong that terrorism is a rising factor in the world. Evil is afraid.RIGHTSThere is no such thing as a right. All people are inherently free.The idea of right was created by men who sought to free people from some of theburdens of government, but who still believed that governments were supreme overmen.The problem with rights, is that they offer certain delineated permissions,granted to men by government. After these, government can still dispose of youas it pleases. Even in measures of restriction, this still teaches people thatthey have less value than law.The truth is that you are free, and there is no authority that has any claimupon you, ever. You are, by your nature, already free. This is the value of ahuman being.LAW ENFORCEMENTCulture teaches that police are the only ones who’s right it is to defend apeople. It teaches that if people were able to defend themselves, anarchy wouldbe the result.The penalty for defending yourself instead of relying on police protection isusually extremely severe. The reason is obvious, it shows the ultimate tyrannyof law. If you aren't helpless then they have little premise to remain in powerover you.The intention of law enforcement is not to defend your liberty, it is to defendthe stability of the machines of extortion. Laws do not say “no killing, noraping, no stealing.” Instead they are volume upon volume of minutia controllingevery aspect of life and destroying liberty wherever they go. Everygovernment agency are enforcers of these laws. The law is not righteous, neitherare the enforcers of it.It is a mistake to blindly respect law enforcement as noble and brave. Laws aredesigned to control, not to protect. An officer of government may believe whathe is doing is right. That is exactly what culture wants him to think. Everysingle one of the hundreds of millions who have died at the hands of governmentsdied under legal premise. Law is not morality.Laws, rules and regulations by themselves are of little danger to humanity. Theypresume authority to rule over you, and culture demands that you obey them, butthey would eventually be ignored as people test and finally discover freedom. Itis the violent enforcement of law that bears the ultimate evil. Enforcement isthe core of law, since all laws require enforcement in order to control people.Respect for law enforcement is an invitation to tyranny. Every culture in thehistory of earth has taught its people that police are good and noble. Medievalknights excused their tyranny by calling it chivalry. Terrorist cultures excusetheirs by calling it religion. No matter what culture you observe, you will finda belief that the enforcers of law are good.The important question has nothing to do with the nobility of the people whoenforce law. It is a question of the nobility of the law.Presuming the righteousness of the agents who enforce the law is precisely whatcultures are designed to do because they excuse the nature of the law. Thisinvitation is exploited heavily by history's dictators, kings and mafias. Whatbetter place to hide atrocities large and small than the very group of armed menwho hold a monopoly on violence and respect?The penalty for disobeying authority is always death. All who have stood in openrebellion against existing powers throughout history were killed. Today, even in‘free nations’ men are killed for rebellion. If they cannot force you to obeywith intimidation, they use threat. If threat is not enough, they use kidnappingand imprisonment. If that fails, you will be murdered. Which law you break isirrelevant. Even such a little law as a speeding ticket—fail to pull over,resist arrest, try to escape or fight back. It happens regularly. The penalty isdeath.PRICE OF GOVERNMENTThe stiffest penalties of law are reserved not for those that you are to beprotected from, but for those who fail to pay the price of protection.The entire purpose of evil is to enslave you, to destroy your freedom in orderto make you a tool for someone else’s use. Just as mafia extortion racketsreserve brutal beatings for those who fail to pay the tax, the world's mosteffective governments use a system of threats, abuse, intimidation, imprisonmentand death to ensure that taxes are paid. This isn’t a side note. This is thevery purpose for why cultures and law are created – to sacrifice your labor forthe benefit of your masters.When law challenges its competition, it labels them criminals and racketeers.The definition of racketeering is the creation of a threat, and then chargingfor protection against it. Such racketeering is institutionalized slavery.Mafias and governments follow the same pattern. History shows us that the namesgiven to each are a matter of who is the more successful extortionist.SUMMARYNations lay claim to people based upon where they are born with respect toimaginary geographic lines. The truth is that a nation is simply a group ofpeople with guns who will kill you if you do not obey them. Borders and landmasses have nothing to do with your value as a human being. They are created tooffer rulers stability as they exercise power over you.“We” is the word commandeered by culture to legitimize the borders andboundaries of law. You are obligated to obey law under penalty of death becauseyou are part of the “we” within an imaginary geographic line. This is not a “we”you have joined by choice. This is not a “we” you can escape. Your ownership ofland, your family and your values are not important to “we.” In our world, theonly escape from the tyranny of “we” is to substitute one “we” for another;assuming “we” let you. Evil would have you believe that you are a subject ofborders. This is a lie.After millennia of kings, those who were not royalty but sought power found away to seize it. Nations allowed evil men to remain in control of culture andlaw; to have authority. Hitler called his version National Socialism. VladimirLenin called his version Communism. Some are called empires, some theocraciesand some democracies. All have one thread in common: the supremacy of the state.Under nations, culture teaches that no one is above the law, and because nationsare defined geographically, no one can escape the law. Put moreconcisely, nations teach that you are worth less than the law. The definition of evil is the destruction of freedom. If governments were whatthey pretend by choice, they would not be government, they would be charitableinstitutions. Since choice is destroyed, freedom is dead and whomever cancontrol the government prevails.Governments, by definition, hold a monopoly on violence. Those who seek powerover you will not fight your government. Why fight it, when what they wanted tobegin with was authority over you? You already have the institution evil menseek. It is natural for evil to seek its place in government. History shows usthat every nation ever devised can and will be used as a tool on behalf of evilmen.Evil seeks power. This is an immutable truth. The more power you vest in agovernment, the more evil you will find there."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6DEMOCRACYSLAVERY IMPERSONATES LIBERTYThe absolute pinnacle of cultural success is to convince people that they arefree in their slavery.Democracy is an invented theory, not a moral truth. It is a construct of evil.It was created to impersonate freedom while still maintaining the grip of lawover people. As in every instance in history, the pattern of tyranny repeatsitself by reinventing lies to hide the same slavery.Democracy is about making slaves and masters of slaves. The teachings of theworld's great democracies are those of liberty and a voice for every person.They teach us that democracies are the greatest possible form of government. Thereason they give is that democracy offers a voice for the common man. Unlikekings, dictators and communists, democracy allows most people to have say in theaffairs of their neighbors.The evil of democracy knows no freedom. A free person has none to enslave him.Instead, democracies offer everyone the opportunity to enslave you.MAJORITY RULEDemocratic culture teaches the rule of law. It teaches that law created bymajority rule is morality. Any law, any demand, any punishment is moral whenimplemented by the majority. Perversions of democracy such as democraticrepublics and super-majorities are no different. Any law able to be passed byrepresentative, majority, super-majority or any other group becomes morality.If you can convince 50% of a people to enslave themselves or their neighbors, isit moral? If you can convince 66%, 75%, 99% or everyone, is it morality? Theaffliction of law is a game to evil. Evil seeks control over people in order todestroy their worth. It does not care who enslaves whom, or why.There is no morality in law. Democratic teaching says that as soon as the legalvoting block approves a law, it is right and proper to inflict it upon a people.Why should the destruction of your freedom be acceptable just because someoneelse says so? Does evil become righteous when more people desire it? Would evilbe righteous if all people desire it? Tyranny by one king is the same as tyrannyby a hundred million kings. It is the nature of compulsion in law that is evil;how the law is achieved is meaningless.Hiding tyranny in the constructs of representative government and majority ruleis commonplace in our modern world. After so many millennia of royalty andwarlords, people have learned to see some of the evil in tyranny. Thousands ofyears were required to discard the notion of nobility and divine right of rule.Today many in the world have an understanding that there is no birthright torule over others as a king. But the deviousness of evil has pushed that burdenupon individual concepts, instead of upon itself. Evil teaches modern peoplesthat royalty and dictators were a mistake, but that submission to your neighborsis right.In early US history, the majority allowed the enslaving and systematicdehumanization of Africans. Did the law of democracy moralize slavery? Theoriessuch as “majority rule” are inherently evil. Evil would have you believe thatevil is good, and that freedom is anarchy.From the position of a free individual, it is horrendous to watch members of ademocracy not only swallow the “rule of law” as inflicted in all manner and formupon their lives, but also to witness the selfsame victims inflict differingversions of morality upon their neighbors.Some people believe that democracies are a safe and proper form of governmentsince the majority of people are decent. They believe that the majority will setproper rules for the minority. This belief teaches two lies. First, that thereis nobility in law; that it is right to force the minority to obey. Second, thatthe minority, if left to themselves, will destroy the lives of everyone else.The minority are controlled and forced by a system of police and law to conformto the correct manner of behavior defined as crime. None of this has anything todo with defending the liberty of the majority. It is about controlling theminority. It is about conditioning the majority to the taste of evil. The thirstfor power over others is the lure of democracy.THERE IS NO MAJORITYThe modern history of powerful democracies has shown that there is no such thingas “the majority” or “the minority”. Factions of ideologies within populationsfragmentdemocratic societies into countless splinters. Different approaches, compromisesand rules break apart any possibility of a single majority, while still creatingendless compulsion via law. Because of this, you are guaranteed, regardless of who you are, to be in somemajority circles, and some minority circles. You will taste of both the controlover others in dictating law, and in the slavery of having law dictated uponyou.Your neighbor, who may otherwise think like you, will be willing to sacrificeyour liberty to achieve some of his means. Likewise, in a democracy, you will betempted to make criminals of your neighbors. As soon as culture teachespeople that it is right and proper to destroy liberty under any premise,authority splinters and tyranny grows.VIOLENCE AND DESTRUCTIONDemocracy creates violence and destruction. Democracy teaches people that it isproper to inflict your will by force upon others. Indeed, it teaches people thatthey are entitled to take anything from their neighbors by force.Democracies are always welfare states, because everyone is able to create lawslegitimizing theft. The strongest democracies have the highest taxation and themost regulation. Government employees are able to influence laws to benefittheir own positions and salaries. The more regulation created, themore opportunities for pirating in the name of propriety.Many wish to control behavior in the name of religion, environment, economics,decency and safety. Democracy teaches that these things have more value thanhuman beings. Evil always teaches that achieving specific behaviors from peopleis more important than the people themselves. Evil would have you believe thatrighteousness is found in propriety, instead of in you. When democratic cultures strengthen, it is obvious to everyone that thelegitimacy of law is a farce. Any law is noble as soon as it becomes law. Whatwould be considered the crimes of kidnapping, mugging and murder are nowcommitted for you, in proxy by police. Mature democracies will find certainpeople who begin dispensing with the excuse of law and simply take what theywant when they want it. This is no more evil than law, just more efficient.The height of democracy is the chaos of men stealing from men, destroying eachother's liberty at will, and crushing the human spirit simply because they can.The height of democracy is an inability to think, to speak or to act for fear oflaw. This is not anarchy, this is tyranny. Tyranny is always disguised asculture and law.PERFECT EVILTo understand the nature of democracy, it is essential to understand that evilis the destruction of freedom. The stability of control is the engineeringdesign of culture. The more stability that authority can be exerted with, thebetter.Stability in history is non-existent. Wars have been fought continually, empireshave been born and destroyed throughout the millennia. Nearly every excuse fortyranny has been tried, and eventually overcome.Human beings seek liberty in their lives, because liberty is the nature ofhumanity; liberty is life. Our continual struggle against evil has been recordedby history. Evil has eventually lost every war it started. This is a testamentto the strength and goodness of humanity. It is also a testament of theadaptability and evolution of evil.Every form of tyranny has failed because people eventually recognized it andretrieved their own liberty. Evil has found a solution to its losses in makingpartners of its slaves.Democracy is the greatest evil that can possibly exist. It is a greater evilthan communism, and a greater evil than royalty. All other forms of tyranny areobviously evil because they allowed a few to control the lives of all. Freedomwas destroyed for nearly everyone. Democracy, however, teaches that you are freeenough to vote, a seemingly better system. Unfortunately, it legitimizes otherpeople voting away your freedoms. This makes it evil. What makes it pure evil ,and the greatest form of evil that can possibly exist is that you also vote totake away freedoms.Everyone becomes a slave – and everyone becomes a master of slaves. Perfectevil."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7ECONOMICSEconomics is the study of the trade of work. The principles of money arescientific, and as with all truths, simple and easy to understand. Governmentinstitutions have created artificial ideas such as employee, corporation anddollar to enable them to control your labor. Their objective is to confuse youand make money complex so that they can more easily take it from you.WORKEverything you do to better your life requires work. It may be as simple asplanting a seed and tending the soil so that it will grow to be your food. Itmay be washing the dishes so that you can eat from a clean plate. It may beclimbing a hill so that you can slide down. You do everything that you do tobenefit yourself and those you love.TRADEYou may not be good at building some of the things you want. You may not want toplant your own food. Trade allows you to do different kinds of work, but to givethat work to others in exchange for work they provide you. If you cannot buildan integrated circuit, but can operate on a tumor, then a trade can help twopeople, a doctor and an engineer. Trades can be between two, three or hundredsof people; but at the end of the day, it is as simple as trading your work forsomeone else's work. You get to do what you are best at, but get to receive whatothers are best at.SAVINGS AND DEBTSavings and debt allow people to perform trades without the restriction of time.When you work today and redeem the traded work later, it is called savings. Whenyou redeem today, and perform the traded work later, it is called debt. Bothprinciples enable you to control your labor without being subject to time.MONEYMoney is the record of all savings and debt transactions. All it does is recordwhat you owe, or what is owed to you. It can be carried symbolically as paper orcoin, or as a line item on accounting books. After you have performed some ofyour work in trade, you receive money to record the value of that work. Yourtrade of work can be between any number of people, and all redeemed at differenttimes. The principle of money greatly enables people and frees them to work andreceive the benefits on their own schedules.ECONOMIC CONTROLThere are people who wish to use your work for their own purposes withoutproviding anything in return. The objective of economic control is to control asmuch of your labor as possible.TAXThere is an extra party to most economic trades that take place on earth. Theyoffer no benefit to either party, and they do not allow you to choose whether ornot to include them in the trade. A tax is when someone takes money that doesnot belong to them. Taxes are law and not principle, because theydestroy freedom and must be enforced. Some of the people who tax are commonthieves while others are powerful governments.EXTORTIONThe corruption of economics is called extortion. When you labor, but someoneelse redeems your work without your permission it is tax. To tax someone is tosteal from them a portion of their work, or all of it. Under taxation, you workbut gain nothing in return. Even when the claim is made that the money will bespent for your benefit, you cannot choose what your work will buy. Undertaxation, the extortionist is the master and you are the slave. What amount oftime they steal from you is irrelevant, a slave for an hour or a slave for lifeis still a slave. Failure to pay is penalized by imprisonment or death.Taxation comes in many forms. The simplest is to steal your money without youever realizing it. We call this theft, and it is practiced by common criminals.The more popular (and vastly more profitable) form of taxation is to take aportion of your work when you produce it, when you trade it and when yousave it. This is the form which is practiced by governments and mafias.There is another form that is incredibly devious and difficult for people tosee. The restriction of behaviors to compel you to do something that authoritywants is taxation. Using this method, they never have to bother with money, theysimply compel you to do their bidding directly. This form of taxation is calledby many, many names. Some of them are price controls, regulation, bureaucracy,red tape, paper work, formalities, oversight, social security, public works andthe public good.Effective taxation is a function of time. A common thief will steal as muchmoney from you today as possible. Tomorrow you will be destitute and havenothing left for him to take. Furthermore, you will run far away, or find amethod of protecting yourself in the future. Governments are far more advanced.They allow you to keep a portion of your work for yourself, enough so that youwill not run away or revolt, but instead continue working where they can takefrom you again tomorrow.Taxation constantly fluctuates as governments test whether or not they can getmore from their subjects. If people slow down, or quit working, then taxes aretoo high. Culture is manipulated to keep up with increasing taxes to teachpeople the nobility of government and slavery.Because taxation is a function of time, they can pirate from you not just hugepercentages of your money today, and not just for the rest of your life, but allpossibility of interest on your labors. Government taxation is the single mosteffective extortion racket that has ever existed. The evil genius comes with theculture – most ‘citizens’ consider it honorable to pay their masters.EARN, TRADE, SAVETaxation is obfuscated in every area of your life. The easiest to see is whenthey take your money as you earn it. Income tax, regulations and governmentalrestrictions allow the extortionist to pirate labor before you ever get to putit to your use. You serve them. They leave you the scraps, whatever thepercentage of your liberty or labors they allow.Extortionists take a further percentage every time you trade your labor; calledsales tax, use tax, gas tax, or any such sundry names. You have less than youproduced because they already took huge percentages from you, and now as you goto redeem your labor for food, shelter, better health or comforts, they takeeven more. This is not all, because they also restrict your choices inredemption – they tell you what is ‘legal’ to buy, how much and sometimes atwhat price.Once earned and spent or saved, your money and property are still not safe.Property taxes and annual licensing fees confiscate a further percentage of yourwork, as a privilege for ownership of your own money. You bought a house, andyou bought a car, but in reality you are just renting them from government. Trynot paying the taxes and fees if you don’t believe that; you will shortly beevicted. All of this is designed to keep you working tomorrow on the upkeep ofyour masters, lest you retire too early.Your money is not safe in savings either. All governments control their forms ofmoney (such as the US Dollar), and it is illegal to trade using any othercurrency. Inflation is engineered by governments to erode your savings over timeas they spend your money through government deficits. Inflation alsoensures that as your savings are eaten away you will be forced to keep working,wherein they can repeat the cycle of taxation.Remember that the reason you work is to benefit yourself and those you love. Yetbecause they are more powerful than you, many, many people have managed to forceyou to work for their benefit. This is economic control. This is the purposeof government. Governments are predatory institutions.ECONOMIC CULTUREMake no mistake – you are a slave and government is your master. Thebrilliance of your masters as opposed to ‘conventional’ slavery is that theyallow you to believe that you earn what you work for, and that you own what youbuy. It keeps you complacent and agreeable.Taxation is a function of time. They will take just as much today as keeps youlaboring in their behalf tomorrow. Cultural ideas like “public servant,” “publicworks,” “public good,” “public protection” and “social security”illustrate their deviousness. They have actually convinced people thathaving their money stolen under threat of death is something to be desired.Remember, it is all for your own good.Constructs such as employee, job, corporation and legal tender are racketsengineered by highly skilled extortionists to restrict behaviors and confiscatewealth. An employee is a person who performs work in trade for money. This isno different from a contractor, a non-employee or a garage sale. You performwork in exchange for someone else’s work. You create wealth to feed your familyand to benefit your life. Employees, however, are constructs of governments torestrict economic behavior. What’s the difference between an employee and aperson who only performs some work? If you gather together the thousands ofpages of laws, you’ll get the idea of who benefits from the artificial ideas ofemployee and corporation. Governments play employees and corporations off eachother to divert anger over the loss of freedom from its proper target, theextortionist.Corporations are constructs invented to restrict the collective behaviors ofpeople. If one person can work on a task, it is clear that many can grouptogether to accomplish more complex tasks. Normally this would just be you andme agreeing to do something together for the benefit of someone else, inexchange for money. Corporations are “creatures of the state” (as governmentscall them) created to abstract the average person from the simple truth ofpeople conducting trade. If government acknowledged the mammoth restrictionsthey put upon you which tell you where you can and cannot trade, what youcan and cannot trade, how you can and cannot trade and at what price you can andcannot trade, they would have an instant revolt. Corporations allow them tocreate a demon to hide their own lusts for power and wealth. Corporations todayattract the wrath of people as polluters, greedy conglomerates, andusury employers. Despite the truth that a corporation is just you and I tradingwork. All of this is designed to hide the most advanced extortion racket inhistory.CARTELS AND MONOPOLIESA corporate monopoly is hailed as evil because it destroys consumer choice.Governments tell us that monopolies force you to purchase a given product at agiven price. The truth is that there is no force. You have at least twoalternate choices. First, don’t buy the product at all. Second, start your owngroup to manufacture the product. Given the supposed evil of a monopoly, whatsolution do governments offer? Government control.Government is the only true monopoly. You cannot choose whether or not to buytheir “services”. Opting out is called treason and tax evasion, and authoritywill come to your door with guns. They will imprison or kill you.Government is the only true monopoly, and their monopoly is a monopoly ofviolence. These are the people that we are taught to trust with authority overour goods and services. Demonizing corporations as monopolistic follows thepattern of tyranny precisely. Fabricate an enemy, and seize control.A cartel is when the forces in an economy band together to preclude anyone elsefrom entering a market. As with a monopoly, this is only possible withgovernment. Only government has the weapons and police to stop you fromselling a product or offering a service. There are cartels large and small all around the world. They normally focus onan industry within a country. For example, a government agency that controls thesale of drugs and health care operates a cartel. When licensing, governmentapplications and fees become the barrier to entry in a market, governmenteffectively keeps the existing market in place and keeps you out. If you try tooperate in freedom, outside of the law, you will be jailed or killed.Many big businesses love cartels because government becomes their partner inkeeping competition away. The laws and regulations that people are taught toagree to do not hurt big business. Big business are the only ones who can affordthe cost of regulation. Some people think they are sticking it to big businesswhen they enact 'tough' laws, but they are actually pawns of culture and they,themselves, are the ones who are hurt. Regulation keeps big business big, andbankrupts everyone else. This is the nature of a government cartel. There are noother cartels.CHOICETaxation is championed by culture as the means of building societal needs, butsocial needs can never be met by force. A person who does not purchase a thingby choice can never gain benefit by being forced to pay for it.Welfare and the public good cannot be served by extortion. Only the owner ofwork can rightfully decide where that work is redeemed. All else is thievery.All claims of need and public good that are not met by free will are the lies ofculture.An important principle to understand is that evil wants power over you. Money isonly a representation of work, and as long as evil people can compel you to workon their behalf, they don't need to possess money to control you. This principleis exercised in welfare and socialist states. Money confiscated by politiciansis largely not spent directly on themselves. However they still enjoy the tasteof power over you by taking and spending that which they did not earn. It is notmoney that is evil, but slavery.Frequently governments will strengthen their culture grip over people byspending extorted money in targeted ways. Just as mafia dons and drug lords areknown to spend on social projects for the benefit of the poor, governments usemoney to fabricate enemies and impersonate righteousness. They spend lavishlywith other people's money on public works and welfare. In so doing they pretendto be the saviors of the people, while condemning the rich (socialism) or theJews (Nazis) or freedom itself (terrorists). The pattern plays out in a thousandways, and the artificial enemies are always different, but the result is alwaysthe same. Governments do not always spend money on themselves, but they alwaysincrease their power.Remember that money is only a representation of power. Its only value is in itsability to convince others to work on your behalf. Money’s value can be wildlyfluctuated depending upon how you view it at a given moment. Those in authorityover you know very well that money can have vastly more value than the numbersprinted on the front when you use it as a weapon against one group to benefitanother. They claim to exercise authority with no gain for themselves. This is agreat lie of evil, used liberally in democracies. It is a debt paid by slaves tobe collected by authority in loyalty and allegiance.For all who wish to feed the poor of the world, there is only one solution. Endauthority. Freedom solves the world's ills. The reason the earth has widespreadpoverty is simply because people are not free to pursue prosperity. A freepeople are a prosperous people.GOVERNMENT DEBTGovernment debt is money spent by governments before they confiscate it. Suchdebt has little meaning, since the evil is found in the confiscation, and notthe timing. However, given the culture of democracies, people are taught thenobility of nations and the loyalty of being a taxpayer. Governments know thatthey can spend whatever they want today, and obligate you to pay for ittomorrow.The nature of national cultures is such that even when the threshold ofextortion is less than government spending, by the time the debt comes due,cultures convince people that it is their debt. In this fashion, they raise thethreshold of extortion. People are less likely to revolt or quit working whenthey are taught that it is theirnation, their debt and their moral obligation topay.BUREAUCRACYBureaucracy is a word used to describe the requirements of complying withgovernment regulations. In order to make sure that you are obeying the countlesslaws governments subject you to, you must also subject yourself to theenforcement of those laws. Innocent and necessary in the eyes of culture, thetruth is that bureaucracy is the patent nature of slavery.Evil seeks control over you, to destroy your liberty, to destroy your spirit.The more you must do by force, the less freedom you have, and the stronger evilis.Every culture teaches the nobility of law enforcement. They teach that lawenforcement prevents murders and rape. While it is entirely possible that theydo on occasion stop violence, the vast majority of modern law enforcement isdesigned only to destroy liberty and extort wealth. Every visit to a motorvehicles bureaucracy, every tax form, every time you are pulled over, everyordinance you comply with at home or on the job is law enforcement in action.The culture of law enforcement is one of protection. Their protection existsonly to the extent necessary to convince you to submit to everything else theydemand of you.The law teaches that you must comply with reams of bureaucracy and enforcementin order to protect other people from you. You are taught that you must complywith extensive enforcement because you cannot be trusted to livepeaceably. While culture teaches that the nature of criminality is murder, rapeand theft, almost none of the enforcement of law has anything to do with suchthings. The reason is obvious, you are not evil, you do not do such heinousthings. There is very little reason to believe that those around you are anyless moral than you. And yet, somehow, to support that basic definition ofcrime, millions are employed as agents of law. They spend all their time makingsure you comply with the facets and iotas of every regulation they can devise.The amount of extortion necessary to support vast bureaucracies is almostunfathomable. The amount of life culled from supposedly free peoples in obeyinglaw is shocking. Yet evil has what it wants: enormouscontrol, dramatically diminished liberty and huge sums of your money.Building codes, environmental regulations, local planning, and on and on. Eachone justifiable in modern culture. Each one has armies to support them. Each onewith just one thing in common: their enforcement by law destroys freedom. If anyof these goals were noble in their own right, they would not need force toaccomplish them. Their true result is to raise costs through increased propertytax, impact fees, licensing fees, business fees, employment taxes, etc.Even government programs designed to cultivate seemingly noble goals such as“ownership societies” are inherently evil. They are designed to stabilizepopulations. What that means is they get more people to commit to a location,and a cost on long term financing so that it is harder to escape taxation. Ifgovernments actually wanted families to own their own homes, they would simplystop charging them rent every year.PRICE CONTROLSGovernments sometimes implement price controls. They dictate under force of lawwhat price you must sell your work at. They dictate under threat of imprisonmentor death how much you will produce your labor for.In government regulated cartels like health care, governments pretend to reducecosts either directly through price mandate, or indirectly by buying services onbehalf of citizens. Using either method they insert the tentacles of controlunder the guise of protecting the poor from greedy corporations and capitalists.By forcing people to work at artificial wages, they destroy the competition of afree market. When freedom is destroyed, only the powerful can survive. Cartelsare thusly forgedwith governments. Powerful businesses watch their weaker competition fall tobankruptcy. Government makes sure it is prohibitively expensive to enter themarket with fees and licensing requirements. Businesses then can enjoygovernment—mandated prices with no competition. Governments can enjoy control ofprices, and therefore guaranteed taxes. The intent of price controls are not tokeep prices down, but to keep them up.Big business loves government regulations. Regulations ensure that only the wellestablished and extremely well financed can compete. People seeking to tradetheir skills, products or expertise are burdened by the impossible demands ofgovernment. Thusly, big business is an extension of the compulsion ofgovernment. Anti-business regulations that people are taught to support areactually good for big business. Instead of hindering them, such regulationdestroys your liberty.PROTECTIONISMProtectionism teaches that those within one nation or border should excludeothers from trade under force of law. This takes place as restrictions on buyingand selling products and services as well as employing people.Why should the citizens of one nation be less entitled to wages or a job thanthe next? Protectionism is that simple. Are those outside your border inferiorhuman beings that they should be kept from working by force? What moralityexists in the teaching that one group of people is more valuable than anotherbecause of where they were born or where they live? Freedom is about the valueof people.The disparity between personal profits of peoples in different lands is large.In one area a family may make hundreds of times less than those in another area.If all people have the same value, why is force employed to stop the poor fromearning money at any job they are willing to perform? If the poor want tosell something to a powerful nation, and the people of that nation want topurchase it because it is sold at a lower cost, why should a government wish tohamper what benefits both peoples?Governments use force to stop items from being sold within their borders atlower costs than what those in their own nation will produce. We are taught thattheir reason for destroying the liberty of people is that they are protectingthe industries of their land. It is not hard to see the truth in evil whengovernments extract large percentages of money from trades. The higher the costof the product, the higher the extracted tax. Protection, as always, is slavery.EducationGovernments control education for the purpose of culturing employees. Theobjective of state education is the stabilization of the tax base.Schooling, education and knowledge are not the same thing. One is not a naturalresult of the other. People grow in knowledge when they learn truths. Teachingand schooling are meaningless when students do not seek wisdom. Theyare likewise meaningless when that which is being taught is not wisdom. In orderto learn, people must thirst for knowledge. Force and compulsion cannotaccomplish this.Law does not pretend to teach people their worth or abilities of achievement.Law desires only that you learn obedience. Not only does law provide a way forstudents to learn the merits of social and economic obedience to authority, itenforces a near perfect monopolization against all other teachers.Private schools and parents themselves are nearly shut out from teachingchildren the one lesson they need: an understanding of their own value andpotential.When people understand that their minds are truly capable of anything, that theyare able to learn and grow according to their dreams, they tend to make poorcitizens. They question culture and oppressive authority. They reject taxation.They are stronger, more peaceful, more prosperous and more independent. All ofthis is wonderful for humanity, and destroys evil.REVEALING TRUTHTo see the truth in an idea, it is a good idea to flip it upside down.Socialism teaches that people deserve to receive the benefits of working withoutactually working. Flipped upside down, socialism teaches that those who workmust work not only for themselves but for everyone else as well. As with allauthority, there is no choice, no opting out. Socialism reveals forced labor.Price controls teach that people deserve to receive products and services at aproper price. Flipped upside down, price controls teach that you must work tocreate products at the price government says you must work for. Price controlsreveal forced labor.Welfare teaches that people deserve to receive the basic necessities of lifewithout needing to work for them. Flipped upside down, welfare teaches thatthose unwilling to labor for their own benefit can extract it from you. Welfarereveals forced labor. Bureaucracy teaches that people should be able to expect others to behaveaccording to strict rules to benefit everyone. Flipped upside down, bureaucracyteaches that to keep bureaucratic employees in the money, everyone mustjump through hoops and pay fees and fines. Bureaucracy reveals forced labor.Taxation teaches that people deserve to receive roads, protection, schools, andall other manner of services even if they cannot afford them. Flipped upsidedown, taxation teaches that people have the right to force their neighbors topay for services without the hassle of asking for permission. Taxation revealsforced labor.All economic control is slavery."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8THE PATTERN OF LIBERTYThe pattern of tyranny has repeated itself throughout history. It cycles inevery instance of evil, large and small. The pattern of liberty, however, is asingular flow that has been progressing slowly since the beginning of time.Evil has been on earth as long as man. The tactics of evil have changedinfrequently, and only do so when forced by the progress of liberty. Every timeliberty has progressed, one of the ideas or concepts of evil has died. Whencultural control over people is broken, the pattern of liberty takes anotherstep forward and culture has been forced to adapt to maintain control overpeople.By using threats of death, torture, mutilation and imprisonment, every kingdomon earth has prospered. War created the empires of history, and culturepreserved them. All who would not submit to the rule of law were killed.Such ignorance of the power of culture is a thing of the past. Moderntechnology, brought by increasing degrees of freedom, is allowing the people ofthe world to see culture for what it is.The pattern of liberty shows how freedom has progressed through history. Whilecultures around the world teach that evil's control is strengthening, thepattern of liberty shows clearly that evil is weakening. The pattern of libertypredicts the ultimate failure of culture, and the ultimate end of evil.PROGRESS THROUGH HISTORYThe pattern of liberty tracks the destruction of ideas and empires throughhistory. It also tracks the progress of principles and technology.GUNPOWDEROne of the defining technologies that dramatically altered the scope of culturewas gunpowder. Prior to its availability, only those who could amass strongarmies could effectively defend their land and families. This meant that peoplewere heavily at the mercy of governments and kings. Once gunpowder becameavailable, even small bands of families could challenge the mighty castles ofempires. Gunpowder reshaped the kingdoms of earth by empowering people tochallenge the violent control employed by the lords of war.PRINTING PRESSThe printing press reshaped the nature of culture like nothing the world hadever seen. Before its invention, almost nobody knew how to read. It was simplytoo expensive to own a book. Once the cost of printing dropped, literacyskyrocketed. Information was standardized on a scale unknown in all of history.It became much more difficult for cultures to center their power on theignorance of people.Religion was dominated by those who could control the scriptures. With thispower, they were able to influence the political freedoms and even the verylifestyles of people. The Bible was the first book printed, and soon spread farand wide. Though the Roman church had men killed for translating the Bible intonative languages such as English, it eventually became available in everylanguage on earth. Theocratic power in the Christian world fragmented and peoplechose to pursue divergent ideas.The printing press was the foundation of all technology. Whereas mathematics andengineering have existed in strength in different areas in history, they neversurvived. War destroyed the information learned. After the printing press, somany copies of books could be maintained that human knowledge persisted inwriting, and spread as fast as the thirst for it demanded.THE GREAT AMERICAN EXPERIMENTThe Great American Experiment was a proof for the world. It dared to call thebluff of culture and test what people would do with liberty. Whereas culture hadlong taught that people were not able or worthy of ruling their own lives, theAmerican rebellion taught people that they were fully able to live life withouta king. They taught by their actions and wittings that men were worth more thangovernments. This experiment in freedom lived past its first test, as theydefeated the armies of King George. The shock that rang through the world wasenough to shatter the bonds of the culture of royalty that had enslaved earthfor thousands of years.INTERNETThe Internet and modern computing power have destroyed cultural ignorance onceand for all. Like the printing press before it, the Internet has made possiblethe widespread dissemination and near indestructibility of information.The bonds of culture are founded in the control of speech and control of themind. When people are free to speak what they think, people learn wisdom at anastonishing pace. For cultures to succeed, they require imposed ignorance andcultivation of planned thought. As soon as people question the rule oflaw, authority is lost.The cultural shift away from intellectual property is a telltale sign of the endof government rule. In the past, information was regarded as owed by the peoplewho developed it. This meant that anyone who attempted to use that informationcould be punished by the violence of law. The future holds a shift in thinkingthat few will be willing to accept until they see it happen.Intellectual property is not a principle. Since it must be enforced byrestricting the liberties of people, it is an idea and a construct of law. Theshift that awaits the world is one of the impossibility of enforcement. Law willstruggle mightily in defense of authority and tax ability, but will ultimatelylose. This is the power of global communication and information retention.Nearly every law will become impossible to enforce. The principles of computingpower give the freedom necessary for people to escape tyranny.VIOLENCE REPLACES CULTUREWhen cultures break down and the authorities they protect are threatened,violence grows. Violence is a necessary component of control. Violentenforcement is necessary to ward off sedition. Violence changes the dynamics bymaking the cost of freedom death. Every time the pattern of liberty has progressed throughout history, violencehas increased. The future will be no different. As people learn about freedomand see what is possible in their own lives, evil will clamp down. Authoritieswill employ greater degrees of violence as they lose their grip on power. Thisis the death of a culture. This is the meaning of war.As the pattern of liberty reaches its final step, the most oppressed cultures onearth will lose adherents the quickest, and those cultures will produce the mostviolent crackdowns.One of the evidences of this violence is terrorist attacks. Those in moderntimes are no different from terrorist attacks in history. Oppressed peoples donot want to be oppressed. When they learn of freedom, they seek more of it fortheir own lives. Evil cultures always demonize freedom. Because the UnitedStates of America has been historically freer than other places, it is attackedby terrorist regimes in an attempt to teach enslaved peoples that freedom isweakness. They teach that freedom is depravity, and insecurity. Such attackshave nothing to do with the people being attacked. They are about maintainingthe grip of cultural slavery over oppressed peoples.The violence of dying cultures can destroy millions of lives, but it never lastslong. Earth's era of wars is over. The rapid pace of nation creation anddestruction is evidence of the accelerating pace of the pattern of liberty. Newcultural twists invented by evil men are discovered and crushed.TECHNOLOGY AND POPULATIONOne of the principles of history is that freedom is a function of population.Population growth endangers tyranny. All the major tyrants of history havesought to limit growth.Births expand the human experience and teach people about opportunity, hope andfaith. This freedom is not conducive to slavery. The more people that live in aculture, the more dissent you will find. It is nearly impossible to controllarge numbers of people with primitive cultures. One of the evidences of thecompletion of the pattern of liberty is the astounding population of earth.Technology endangers evil on every hand. Its use, implementation and imaginationare diametrically opposite evil.Technology is borne of freedom. Freedom brings wisdom to people who implementlearned principles in practical solutions. This search for wisdom teaches peoplethe value that they have within themselves. It teaches them to stretch thelimits of their intelligence and faith. This is more than concerning to thecontrol of authority, it is the death of evil.The use of technology enables the evasion of authority.One powerful example of this is the evasion of taxation. Governments areinstitutionalized extortion. When technology allows people to remove the controlof money from government hands, taxation becomes impossible. Advanced encryptionand anonymous peer-to-peer networking technology allow for exactly this.Economic exchanges are freed from the bounds of legal tender and regulation. Thefuture of technology brings the impossibility of tracking money and enforcingtaxation. This transition will be marked by violence as governments tryto salvage their monstrous rates of extortion.The comforts and prosperity of technology demonstrate to the world what thefruits of freedom are. It is entirely impossible to hide from culturallyenslaved peoples the glory that is human life. Principles and products leakthrough every culture on earth. The kings of old have fallen. Communism isweakened. Theocracy is dying. Democracies are bankrupt. Violence will mark thetransitions, but freedom will prevail.THE AMERICAN DREAMThe American Dream was for a land where people would be free from theinterference of government. The dream was one of freedom to pursue joy andhappiness.Today, culture teaches that the American Dream is a specific and tightly definedperspective on the perfect life, and that the reason the United States ofAmerica is great is because it has the ability to create that life for you.Culture perverts everything good.The American Dream is not an American dream. The Great American Experimentbrought massive liberty to the people of America; more than had been seen at anyother time or place on earth. The experiment and the dream are not forAmericans.The United States of America is not to be respected as a nation. It is not afavored group. There is no magic, no cultural supremacy in the Red, White andBlue. The Great American Experiment is to be respected only because it taughtpeople that they are worth more than the law.The government of the United States of America in modern times closely resemblesboth a democracy and a welfare state. It is bankrupt and heavily enforced bylegions of law. Culture would have you believe that this is its legacy. It isnot.The Declaration of Independence, the Bill of Rights, and the very action ofrebellion against a king taught the people of the world that government had nonatural right over them. These things taught the whole earth that they owedgovernment and authority nothing. It told people that authority should nevertell The Pattern of Liberty them what they could say, how they could worship,what they could print and where they could gather. It told people that lawenforcement is a dangerous animal, and they ought to be able and willing todefend themselves against it. It taught people that government and authority canbe limited. It taught people that they were worth more than the law.This mighty step taken in the pattern of liberty has nothing to do withdemocracy or government. The power and beauty of this step was the anti-culturecreated by men of rebellion. They attacked every leg of authority by teachingpeople about a measure of their own worth. The experiment has proven successful– freedom for people does not create anarchy. America is not perfect, and itwill not be the end of freedom. Mankind’s thirst for liberty will not endure thetyrannies of earth for long. They will be taught that they are worthy of rulingtheir own lives. The pattern of tyranny will be broken.The American Dream is not an American dream, it is a human dream. It was a giantstair climbed on the backs of heroes toward the freedom of men. It will not bethe last.COMPETITION FOR FREEDOMAs people are able to look beyond the tyranny of their own lives to divergentcultures on earth, they will see a competition for freedom. The lure of freedomwill be evidenced by the technology, prosperity and peace of freer peoples. Theywill ask why it is noble for them to obey certain laws, but not the rest of theworld. They will see that those things which are demanded of them are notnatural, that they are tyranny.The pattern of liberty progresses every time the lies of culture are discoveredand understood. Though cultures are designed to maintain tight control of theminds of people so that they cannot see the tyranny over them, witnessingfreedom can break the bonds nearly instantly. When the violence of dyingcultures runs out and freedom peeks out of every dark place on earth, the peopleof the world will begin a competition for freedom.When there is freedom to move and shop for jurisdictions, you will find thatpeople move to freer societies, not stricter ones. Moreover, elements of evilwill gravitate to more restricted societies because they are easier to exertcontrol over. This is the final chapter for evil. Technology, communications andwisdom free people to evade authority, and they will do so with ever increasingeffectiveness.This is the completion of the pattern of liberty. This is where evil ends."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9END OF EVILVoice is a principle of intelligence.Voice is the highest form of communication between beings of the highestintelligence. The passion and feeling that people are able to put behind theirwords can change lives, and change worlds.The few who achieve a glimpse of the power of voice bring either insanedestruction or awesome freedom. Every great and terrible culture brought intothe world was brought by the principle of voice. Every rebellion and revolutionthat destroyed cultures and empires was brought by the power of voice. Men whounderstood the principle of voice have irrevocably altered our world.The principle of voice is found in every element of human communication. Writingand books are lesser forms of human voice. Every transfer of words contains thepower to change lives. When accompanied by the passion of life, voice alone hasthe power to free worlds.The principle of voice explains why freedom is a function of population. Aspopulation increases, it is more difficult for culture to maintain control overthe speech of people. The more people communicate with one another, the quickerthey learn their own value. Population increase brings increased freedom to theworld because of the power of voice.When people are unfettered by the chains of culture, and when they do notbelieve the lie that they are powerless, they can change everything. To changethe world you must have the faith that you have such ability in yourself. Youmust open your mouth and speak.The principle of voice is the passion to convince, the passion to teach, and thepassion to create faith. It will strengthen you, and should you choose to useit, you will change lives.FUTUREThe dreams that burn in the hearts of billions have been growing strongerthrough the millennia. Ages of destruction wrought by tyranny will not gounanswered. The children of this world are owed a liberty from slavery that canonly be satisfied by the utter eradication of evil from the earth.Every dream of feeding the hungry, clothing the naked and helping the poor isanswered in this cause. Human beings are able to answer every need and desire ofour world by using the principles we learn all around us. When the obstacles ofevil are removed from the lives of people, technology and prosperity advance onan exponential scale.With only limited degrees of freedom in a small percentage of the world, humanbeings have cured scores of disease and discovered methods of feeding billions.All the comforts of modern life were made possible by people with the faithto succeed. Ask yourself what miracles may be accomplished when this smallpercentage becomes perfect freedom, and is achieved for every one of thebillions of people on earth. This is the infinite value of human beings.You are the key. The progress of liberty on our world is advanced by challengingculture and authority. Technology and the proof of the Great American Experimentare in our hands. To challenge evil, all that remains is to open your mouth andtell the people of the world that the dream of freedom is real.It is you who will teach the people of earth their value. It is you who willbring to pass the greatest revolution in the history of mankind. To challengethe authority of evil, you need to dismantle its tools of violence and culture.Culture is dismantled as simply as disobedience to the control of speech. Whenyou speak your mind and refuse to take offense when others do the same, culturescannot survive. There is nothing to fear in freedom.Violence is the tool of first and last resort for evil. Those few who will useit to enslave cannot be left alive.A perfect revolutionThe price of freedom is blood. This is an immutable truth. The reason is thatevil does not care if you live or die. Evil will stop at nothing to achievemastery over you.A perfect revolution is a revolution where all of the blood paid for freedom ispaid by tyrants; and where none is paid by the innocent.There are only three types of action a person can take; that which exercisesfreedom, that which defends it and that which destroys it. Culture teaches thenobility of destroying freedom by concepts such as the rule of law. At the sametime, it teaches the immorality of defending freedom in concepts such as policeauthority. Culture cannot be allowed to continue. As long as men of violencewalk the earth, they will devise ways to create cultures under threat of death.The defense of freedom is always righteous, and no tyrant can be spared.There is no proper role for tyranny in the lives of people. As soon as you yieldto the forces of compulsion in the name of life, you have lost your life, for itbelongs to those who control you. Life is liberty. Without liberty, your lifebelongs to another. Liberty is to be defended at all costs and at all times.Govern yourself, for this is the nature of an individual. You and you alonecontrol your actions and your mind. This is right, proper and good. You have aresponsibility to defend your liberty at all times. If you do not, it will bedestroyed. To yield defense of your liberty to another is an absolute invitationto tyranny.Personal sovereignty is the end of evil. When every person on earth will defendthemselves and those they love. When evil cannot gain even a foothold becauseall people are watching for it, and recognize that it seeks to destroy theirvalue. This is the exact opposite of perfect evil, in which every person is aslave and a master of slaves. Perfect liberty is life, and in it there are noslaves and no masters of slaves. Perfect liberty is life.EARTHThe cultures of earth teach you to accept, to yield and to obey. The end of evilis found in refusing this slavery of the mind.For the end of evil to be achieved, all people must be taught that they oweobedience to no one. They must be taught that the desires and dreams of theirhearts are proper and good. They must be taught that every ounce of joy theyseek can be had for themselves and those they love. This is the anti-culture, tofree the minds of people.Cultures are established first by the control of speech. Condemnation of speechis rampant in the strongest cultures. The end of evil will bring the defense ofspeech in every home, and in every communication. Culture teaches that speechbrings offense. Instead, you must see that speech brings a view into the mind ofa human being. Ignore the interpretations of culture and see the intent andfeeling of them who speak to you. And then speak back. The control of speech iscrushed by the power of voice.In the end of evil, people cannot tolerate compulsion and force. The mistakes ofhistory are found where people have allowed the establishment of culture. Inevery case, it was known that this establishment would destroy liberty. In theend of evil, tyranny will not be tolerated.You owe allegiance to no nation and to no law. You are a being of infiniteworth, and fully capable of escaping the bondage of evil. When you feelcompelled not to speak, speak. When you are oppressed by law, circumvent it.When violence threatens you, crush it.Remember the lessons of technology. Technology is the fruit of freedom.Technology enables humanity at the expense of authority. Just one example ofthis is the extraction of economics from the control of nations. Regulationchokes economic activity by making it prohibitively expensive, cumbersome andcomplex for newcomers to sell products and services. The answer is technology.Internet activities such as classified service listings will be merged withproduct auctions on an open and universal platform. We already understand howtechnology can bring the cost of selling down, and make selling easier foreveryone to accomplish.The lessons of evading extortion and control are, likewise, already learned.Global peer-to-peer networking ensures that no authority can switch off a serverto dismantle economic activity. This dispersion of economic targets will make itimpossible for governments to enforce taxation and control. Making peer-to-peernodes anonymous using powerful encryption technology will make it extremelydifficult for authority to bring excessive violence upon individuals to forceexamples of obedience. Steganography within established protocols such as HTTPwill make disabling specific communications impossible without disabling allcommunication.Merging public auctions and marketplaces with anonymous, steganographicpeer-to-peer networking will forever remove the control of economics from thehands of extortionist authorities. With technologies such as these, people canbuy and sell anything without the interference of governments andmafias. Furthermore, governments will not be able to enforce taxation recordkeeping, since instead of a smaller number of corporations preferred bygovernment, every one of the billions of people on earth will engage theireconomics directly. Population and technology crush evil.What other devices can be imagined to free people from the tyranny of communism,terrorism, socialism, democracy, violence and culture? With a human mind, thereis no limit to imagination and invention. When technology and innovation beatdown authoritative control, the liberty released will spawn astronomicaladvances. One ounce of freedom may bring one ounce of technology. Two ounces maybring ten. One free person may bring one idea of innovation; two free peoplemay bring a hundred. Total freedom for all people brings nothing less thaninfinite opportunity.The scale of the speed of human advancement can be seen in thousands of years ofhistory with modest gains in freedom and modest gains in technology. In the mostrecent few hundred years, technology has exploded. With each degree offreedom achieved, human knowledge builds exponentially.YOU HAVE INFINITE VALUEWith freedom, all things are possible. Technology, health, wealth and knowledgeare all facets of power. Each of these improve the lives of human beings. Thefruits of liberty are everything good; and bring peace, prosperity and joy.You live after the era of wars, and the only remaining step in the pattern ofliberty is to answer the question held in the minds of people around the world.The lies of millennia have not stopped the unquenchable thirst for freedom thatgrows within the hearts of every person on earth. They are poised and ready totake the freedom that is rightfully theirs. They need only hear that freedom ispossible, that freedom is real.You are the key. To teach the people of earth the value that they have withinthemselves you need only speak, and tell them that every good thing is theirs tohave. You need only tell them that the glory of liberty is real, and that itbelongs to them.This war is already won. Evil has already been crippled. Every human being onearth is ready to rise and let the chains that held them crumble to dust. Thisworld will be free. If you can see your own value, then stand tall.
